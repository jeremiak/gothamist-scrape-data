<p>The most telling moment of Saturday night&apos;s Red Bulls 2-1 win over the New England Revolution wasn&apos;t a particular goal, or a great save, or a blown call. It wasn&apos;t even when the ball was in play.</p>

<p>It came during halftime, three minutes before the second half was set to kick off. Fans were still buying concessions. The grounds crew was still running the sprinklers. The Revolution were still in their locker room. And yet, the Red Bulls stood on the field, already back from the locker room.</p>

<p>One might&apos;ve expected them to be less jazzed after a horror show first half. No shots on goal. A too-easily conceded goal from Charlie Davies handing the visitors the lead. Perhaps most fatally, a rough challenge from NY defender Matt Miazga saw a straight red card, reducing the Red Bulls to 10 men in the second half. Boos rained down in Harrison as the team left the field, as fans felt like another home game was ready to slip away.</p>

<p>&quot;I cannot remember a worse performance of a first half that I&#x2019;ve ever seen&#x2026; aside from my six-year-old&#x2019;s team to be quite honest, to be very blunt,&quot; groused coach Mike Petke after the match.</p>

<p>From terrible to terrific. The Red Bulls ran the field the second half, dominating the Revs and finding two goals to secure their first come-from-behind victory of the year. </p>

<p>The first goal came just minutes into the half, when Dax McCarty decided to go for a chip that floated just over New England goalkeeper Bobby Shuttleworth.</p>

<p>Fifteen minutes later, New York&apos;s most lethal goalscorer would get on the board. Lloyd Sam fed a ball forward to Bradley Wright-Phillips, who cut the ball back and curled a perfect ball into the far post for his 18th goal of the season. BWP is almost guaranteed to break the club&apos;s single season goal scoring record of 19, and needs 10 goals in 12 remaining games to break the all-time league record.</p>

<p>Despite their man advantage, the Revolution were unable to capitalize, earning a ninth loss in their last ten games. They have not won on the road to New York since 2007.</p>

<p>&quot;The second half tonight was perhaps - and this is saying a lot, because of our success last year - perhaps the best half in my time as a head coach, and we were a man down,&quot; said Petke. &quot;The &apos;tale of two halves&apos; has never been more of an accurate statement in the history of sports than us tonight.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I thought for 30 minutes in the second half we were brilliant, almost unplayable,&quot; offered Dax McCarty after the match.  &quot;With 10 men, especially, that&apos;s something that shows you how good of a team we can be. I don&#x2019;t know why this season we&#x2019;ve been very inconsistent, you know we just haven&#x2019;t shown the fight and the same character and that leadership and  that&#x2019;s on everyone. It hasn&#x2019;t been good enough this season. We didn&#x2019;t want to be sitting here at the end of the game saying the same exact thing over and over and over again, and that&#x2019;s that we&#x2019;re better than what we showed on the pitch.&quot;</p>
