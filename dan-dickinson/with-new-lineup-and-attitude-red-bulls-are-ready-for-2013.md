</div></div>					<p>Monday at Pier 59 Studios, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111644/http://gothamist.com/tags/redbulls">New York Red Bulls</a> passed their first challenge of the season: their annual media day gauntlet.  As the team unveiled <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111644/http://www.mlssoccer.com/news/article/2013/02/25/jersey-week-ny-red-bulls-get-new-lightweight-primary-kit-13">new 2013 home jerseys</a>, we spoke with players, coaches, and staff to get their take on a turbulent off-season, the new attitude for the club, and expectations for the coming campaign.</p>

<p><strong>What did you take away from the 2012 season?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Midfielder/Defender Connor Lade:</strong> I think it was a pretty good first year.  As a team we wanted to do better, but I was able to get a lot of playing time, and see what the ins and outs of the league were. I&apos;m just trying to improve on my performance from the first year, and be a consistent starter. Whether that&apos;s in the start or I have to work my way back in, I&apos;m definitely comfortable with trying to prove to the staff I can start and affect the team positively.</p>

<p><strong>Defender Brandon Barklage:</strong> Personally, I&apos;d give myself a C+. It was good to finally get back onto the field, it was good to play right back.  I feel more and more comfortable playing at that position every game. I&apos;d like to stay healthy for all 34 games this year.</p>

<p><strong>Defender Markus Holgersson:</strong> It was a little disappointing to get out against DC United. We had a lot of good opportunities to break them down, but we couldn&apos;t finish it, and in the last moment, yeah. We can ride on that, we did a really good end and we have a strong team this year also. If we can get it together, we can go a long way.</p>

<p><strong>Goalkeeper Ryan Meara:</strong> I had so much fun with everything.  Everything was new to me.  Something about playing and starting every game on a team where we were winning a lot of games. It&apos;s a lot of fun, and we have a great group of guys. I thought we were real close to being that team to either be in the final or win it last year.  We&apos;re all hoping this is the year.</p>

<p><strong>The biggest news during the offseason was the departure of Rafael Marquez, who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111644/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/13/this_week_in_soccer_rafa_marquez_le.php">returned to Mexico</a> after two and a half controversial years with RBNY. How do you feel about Rafa&apos;s departure?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Striker Thierry Henry:</strong> [We&apos;re] losing a great guy and a great teammate.</p>

<p><strong>Lade:</strong> He&apos;s been a top pro at the top level for such a long time. I think that people view him differently. It&apos;s different having him in there every day. He&apos;s actually a very knowledgable guy, and he  helped everyone a lot with how he played and how he trained with us. You can learn a lot from him. I think it was unfortunate sometime the criticism he received, but to each their own, and I learned a lot from him.</p>

<p><strong>Holgersson:</strong> (laughs) No, that&apos;s good.  I have nothing to say about that.</p>
