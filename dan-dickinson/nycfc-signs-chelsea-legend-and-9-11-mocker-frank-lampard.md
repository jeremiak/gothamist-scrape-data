<p>Still half a year from taking the field, the new Major League Soccer team <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428110821/http://gothamist.com/tags/nycfc">NYCFC</a> has added a second big name to their roster to join <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428110821/http://gothamist.com/2014/06/02/nycfc_sign_david_villa_as_their_fir.php">David Villa</a>. Frank Lampard was unveiled as the club&apos;s newest signing this morning, bringing the Chelsea FC legend to New York. If only he didn&apos;t have that unfortunate 9/11 baggage!</p>

<p>After coming through the youth system and going pro at West Ham United, Lampard joined Chelsea FC in 2001 and became eternally linked with its rise to becoming a &quot;super club&quot;. He&apos;s won it all: three Premier League titles, four FA Cups, two League Cups, one UEFA Champions League title, and one Europa League Championship. He holds the club&apos;s all-time scoring record with 211 goals, and also has 106 caps for the English national team.</p>

<p>In a statement released by the club, Lampard hit the usual pleasantries for any sports signing: &quot;I am really excited about joining New York City FC and helping to play a real part in building something special in one of the sporting capitals of the world. The passion of the nation&#x2019;s fans at the World Cup was second to none and I am looking forward to meeting New Yorkers and tapping into their love of the game. It is a privilege to be able to help make history here in New York City&#x2014;I just can&#x2019;t wait to get started and be part of it.&quot;</p>

<p>Head coach Jason Kreis was also pleased: &quot;I am really looking forward to working with Frank. His leadership, maturity and experience are perfect characteristics for a new Club like ours. He is a rare talent, one that scores a lot of goals from midfield, yet is also a disciplined defender and someone who reads the game brilliantly. A gift for a coach.&quot;</p>

<p>Lampard&apos;s move to NYCFC is getting extra scrutiny not because of his age (he&apos;s 36) or his salary (rumored to be around $8 million a year, extremely high for MLS), but because of 9/11! Famously, Frank&apos;s only bit of truly bad behavior came on September 12th, 2001, where he and other Chelsea players were seen drunkenly harassing grieving American tourists at a Heathrow airport hotel. Lampard reportedly stripped naked, swore at the tourists, and vomited during the incident&#x2014;so he&apos;s basically a shoo-in to lead SantaCon this year. At the time, he was fined two weeks wages by Chelsea.</p>

<p>Lampard is the fourth player on the NYCFC roster, joining David Villa, MLS journeyman Jeb Brovsky, and former LA Galaxy goalkeeper Josh Saunders.</p>
