<p>In a shocker of a trade, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428112024/http://gothamist.com/tags/redbulls">New York Red Bulls</a> today <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428112024/http://www.newyorkredbulls.com/news/2012/05/new-york-acquires-us-national-team-defender-heath-pearce">announced a deal</a> that will send 18-year-old US soccer star Juan Agudelo west to Chivas USA, in exchange for veteran defender Heath Pearce.</p>

<p>Agudelo joined the Red Bulls from their academy in March 2010, and made two appearances towards the end of the season. He would make a name for himself that winter, scoring the lone goal in a international friendly against South Africa, making him the youngest scorer in US senior team history.  He drifted in and out of the starting lineup in 2011 due to international call-ups and competition with Luke Rodgers, finding only 12 starts in 27 appearances and scoring 6 goals.  </p>

<p>Heath Pearce has played for Chivas USA and FC Dallas before them, making 30 appearances last year and being named to the MLS All Star Team.  The deal also includes multiple other unspecified sweeteners, including allocation money and future considerations.  RBNY GM Erik Soler explained the trade in a team statement:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;To obtain someone of Heath&#x2019;s pedigree and gain substantial financial considerations, we had to trade Juan - an exciting player with potential. In our discussions with Juan, he voiced that he wanted to have more time playing first team soccer and even explore the option of moving to another team. We wanted to help him achieve this goal and further develop his career. It has been rewarding to watch Juan develop both as a player and a person within our Academy and First Team and we think that playing for Chivas USA will be a great new opportunity for his career. We wish him the best of luck in the future.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>It&apos;s a hard trade to declare a victor for.  While Agudelo was considered one of the brightest stars in the league in 2011, there were frequent whispers that his work ethic for his team didn&apos;t match his interest in playing for his country.  Chivas has been lacking in offensive firepower in 2012, with a league low of 6 goals scored after 10 games; RBNY still needed help shoring their defense, having given up 16 goals in 11 games.  Soler&apos;s comment about &quot;substantial financial considerations&quot; lend credence to rumors of some big signings this summer&#x2014;but if Agudelo goes hot with his new team, New York may again be left ruing this move.</p>

<p>Agudelo won&apos;t have to wait long to make a statement against his former team, as he will return to Red Bull Arena on May 23rd for the only game between these two sides this season.  The match could also mark the long awaited return of former NY legend Juan Pablo Angel, who was dumped from the roster at the end of 2010.  Chivas shocked RBNY at home last year, and with two former strikers ready to line up against Metro, only one question remains: is revenge coming for Hans Backe?</p>
