<p>The World Cup is nearly two weeks away, and there&apos;s a lot of soccer news!</p>

<p><strong>NYCFC</strong> today <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111111/http://www.nycfc.com/Season-Tickets">unveiled their season ticket prices</a> for the upcoming 2015 season. While season ticket deposits have been taken since the announcement they&apos;d be playing in Yankee Stadium, this is the first time the full package price has been available. </p>

<p>Compared to other NYC sports options, the ticket prices are reasonable. Comparing like-for-like sections at Red Bull Arena, the prices are generally on the same level, if not cheaper. Non-club per game season ticket prices range from $18-52, with single match tickets ranging from $25-65. It&apos;s smart pricing to build the fan base for the new team.</p>

<p>If there&apos;s one complaint, it&apos;s that the Supporters Section, a standing only area for fans who want to chant for the whole match, spans sections 235 to 238. That puts a section (and the visitor&apos;s bullpen) between them and the field, which is an interesting design choice.</p>

<p>NYCFC begin play in March 2015.</p>

<p>The <strong>New York Red Bulls</strong> spent Tuesday night on the road, playing to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111111/http://golazo.mlssoccer.com/matchcenter/2014-05-27-sporting-kansas-city-vs-new-york-red-bulls/recap">a tough 1-1 draw</a> at Sporting Kansas City. </p>

<p>Coming off short rest having just played Saturday, it was a bit optimistic to hope they would come out strong. Instead, New York turned in a performance Mike Petke labeled &quot;perhaps our worst start of the season&quot;. Goal line clearances and being saved by the crossbar could only hold off Sporting for so long, with Toni Dovale scoring in the ninth minute. </p>

<p>It looked like a long night ahead, but as Sporting eased off the gas, the Red Bulls came out strong in the second half. A beautiful through ball from Thierry Henry set up Bradley Wright-Phillips for his league leading 11th goal of the season. The draw ends New York&apos;s losing streak, converting it into a still-troubling-but-less-fatal four game winless streak.</p>

<p>The Red Bulls won&apos;t play again until June 7th at the East&apos;s hottest team, New England, where they haven&apos;t won in over a decade. They&apos;ll need to put in a complete performance for a change if they&apos;re going to find a result in their last match before the World Cup break.</p>

<p>Speaking of the World Cup, the <strong>US Men&apos;s National Team</strong> played the first of their three-game sendoff series in San Francisco, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111111/http://www.ussoccer.com/stories/2014/05/27/18/31/140527-mntvaze-live">defeating Azerbaijan 2-0</a>. Mix Diskerud and Aron Johansson both came off the bench to score both goals in the second half, in a performance that didn&apos;t do much to calm down concerns about the team&apos;s readiness for Brazil.</p>

<p>The USMNT roll into NYC next, and US Soccer has planned a number of events for fans who want to connect with the team before they head to Brazil. On Friday, members of the team will appear on Good Morning America. A &quot;fan fest&quot; will be held in Times Square from 1PM-5PM, and members of both the 2014 squad and legendary 1994 squad will take part in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111111/http://thetownhall.org/event/551-men-in-blazers-live-on-broadway">Men In Blazers On Broadway</a> show at Town Hall. </p>

<p>There will be a free public training session at Red Bull Arena on Saturday from 11-12:30, all leading up to the US taking on Turkey Sunday afternoon at 2PM. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111111/https://tickets.newyorkredbulls.com/Online/default.asp?doWork::WScontent::loadArticle=Load&amp;BOparam::WScontent::loadArticle::article_id=4D0EB542-B512-497B-8067-57FBABE4B1BD&amp;sessionlanguage=&amp;SessionSecurity::linkName=">Limited tickets are still available</a>; the game will also be televised on ESPN2.</p>
