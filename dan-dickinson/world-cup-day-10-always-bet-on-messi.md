										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="2014_06_messi2.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144835im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2014_06_messi2.jpg" width="640" height="411"> <br> <i> Lionel Messi, left, celebrates after scoring against Iran (AP)</i></div> Saturday&apos;s World Cup action brought us another chapter in the legend of Leo Messi, the World Cup scoring record being tied, shameful refereeing, and Rihanna talking that talk.<p></p>

<p><em>Last Night&apos;s Action</em></p>

<p><strong>Argentina 1, Iran 0</strong> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144835/http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/videos/highlights/match=300186466/index.html">HIGHLIGHTS</a>) For 90 minutes, it appeared that Iran was going to pull off another World Cup shock. The Iranians not only held their own with Argentina, they looked sharper in the attack and could easily have had a penalty kick. With the clock ticking into stoppage time and with Iran putting all eleven players behind the ball to hold on for the draw, it appeared the group favorites would be stunned. </p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="2014_06_messi3.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144835im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2014_06_messi3.jpg" width="640" height="430"> <br> <i> Iran&apos;s goalkeeper Rahman Ahmadi tries to stop a goal by Argentina&apos;s Lionel Messi (AP)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>But Lionel Messi restored the balance to the universe, driving an 20+ yard shot into the far corner for his second game-winning goal of the tournament. The result secures Argentina&apos;s place in the Round of 16.</p>

<p><strong>Germany 2, Ghana 2</strong> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144835/http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/videos/highlights/match=300186493/index.html">HIGHLIGHTS</a>) In a tournament full of memorable games, Germany and Ghana went full throttle to produce another classic. Mario G&#xF6;tze nodded the ball into his knee to give Germany the initial lead, but Ghana would quickly bounce back with goals from Andr&#xE9; Ayew and Asamoah Gyan. Germany were rescued by Miroslav Klose off the bench, who tapped home the tying goal just two minutes after entering the game. It was Klose&apos;s 15th World Cup goal, which leaves him tied for the all-time record with Brazil&apos;s Ronaldo.</p>

<p><strong>Nigeria 1, Bosnia-Herzegovina 0</strong> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144835/http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/videos/highlights/match=300186511/index.html">HIGHLIGHTS</a>) Justifiable rage from the Bosnians, who are eliminated from the tournament thanks to two controversial plays just minutes apart. Edin Dzeko was incorrectly ruled offside to deny Bosnia the opening goal in the 21st minute. Eight minutes later Emmanuel Emenike appeared to foul Emir Spahic, but the referee allowed play to continue, allowing Peter Odemwingie to slot home the winning goal from close range.</p>

<p><em>Today&apos;s Matches</em></p>

<p><strong>Belgium vs. Russia</strong> (12PM ET, ABC) The two European favorites from Group H get the early game. Belgium needed a late surge to win their opener against Algeria, while Russia will be hoping their goalkeeping is less suspect than it was against South Korea. Belgium can secure a spot in the Round of 16 with a win.</p>

<p><strong>South Korea vs. Algeria</strong> (3PM ET, ABC) Both teams will see this as winnable, but the pressure is on Algeria more than on South Korea, as they could be eliminated with another loss. </p>

<p><strong>USA vs. Portugal</strong> (6PM ET, ESPN) Thank you, FIFA, for saving the best for last before we go to four days of simultaneous group games. The USMNT will be looking to silence their doubters and earn their place in the next round with a win. Portugal desperately need a result after getting thrashed by Germany in the opener; a loss here would eliminate them. And yes, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144835/http://gothamist.com/2014/06/20/usmnt_feeling_cristiano_ronaldo_ove.php">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> is expected to start. We&apos;ll have a full preview from team camp later this morning.</p>

<p><em>What Else Is Going On?</em></p>

<p>Who was most happy about Messi&apos;s goal? A bettor in Vegas <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144835/http://www.espnfc.us/fifa-world-cup/story/1901797/lionel-messi-goal-in-argentina-world-cup-win-over-iran-saves-las-vegas-gambler-$350,000">put $350,000 on Argentina</a> to win over Iran.</p>

<p>Edin Dzeko called the referee in Bosnia&apos;s match with Nigeria <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144835/http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jun/22/world-cup-2014-bosnia-herzegovina-nigeria-edin-dzeko-shameful-referee">&quot;shameful&quot;</a>.</p>

<p>US Women&apos;s National Team goalkeeper Hope Solo was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144835/http://www.soccerbyives.net/2014/06/arrested-domestic-incident.html">arrested Saturday morning</a> on two counts of fourth-degree assault.</p>

<p>Senator Bob Casey of Pennsylvania has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144835/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/06/20/bob-casey-qatar-world-cup_n_5512565.html">formally asked FIFA</a> to revoke Qatar&apos;s hosting rights for the 2022 World Cup. We hope he sent it in a large plain envelope with &quot;ATTN: CASH INSIDE&quot; written on it, as otherwise FIFA isn&apos;t going to open it.</p>
