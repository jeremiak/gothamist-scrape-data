(New York Red Bulls)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>Week in and week out, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428112017/http://gothamist.com/tags/redbulls">New York Red Bulls</a> face adversity and pull out unlikely results. Saturday night&apos;s trip to Montreal saw them overcome injuries, terrible officiating, and a red card in a come-from-behind 2-1 win.</p>

<p>Hans Backe was forced to reconfigure his 4-1-4-1 lineup in light of some peculiar circumstances in the trip to Canada. In addition to the rest of the injury list, Rafa Marquez did not make the lineup due to what was described as an achilles injury on Friday.  Mehdi Ballouchy, who has been featuring regularly for New York, remains unable to leave the US due to his green card process.  With Heath Pearce joining the back line for his first RBNY game, Connor Lade and Victor Palsson were given starts in the midfield.</p>

<p>It is impossible to discuss the match without focusing on referee Ismail Elfath, who was officiating his first career MLS match.  During what looked like a routine challenge for a cross in RBNY&apos;s penalty area, Elfath blew his whistle and quickly awarded a penalty to Montreal in the 22nd minute.  Replays show that the ball may have slightly brushed the back of Markus Holgersson&apos;s arm, but as he was facing away from the ball such contact would&apos;ve been unintentional. Montreal capitalized on the bad call with Bernardo Corradi slotting the spot kick past Ryan Meara.</p>

<p>A quarter hour later, the Red Bulls would get a penalty of their own. Dane Richards knocked the ball into the outstretched hand of a sliding Tyson Wahl, and the assistant referee awarded a penalty.  Kenny Cooper would step up and convert for his 10th of the season, leveling the game 1-1 in the 37th minute.</p>

<p>The second half saw New York&apos;s Victor Palsson sent off after a second yellow card, leaving New York down a man for over half an hour of play.  Montreal would dominate the game, holding over 60% of possession and keeping Ryan Meara busy with 20 attempts on goal.  While bunkering to escape with a draw would&apos;ve been reasonable, all three points went to RBNY after Dane Richards scored his first of the season.  On a counter-attack, a Roy Miller cross was parried away by keeper Donovan Ricketts, but the onrushing Jamaican winger was in good position and drove the ball into the roof of the net.</p>

<p>The win brings the Red Bulls&apos; win streak to 5 straight - the first time the team has done so since May of 2003.  With much of the rest of the league tying yesterday, New York retains their grip on 1st in the Eastern Conference, and is now a single point back from Real Salt Lake in the race for the Supporter&apos;s Shield.</p>

<p>Can the Red Bulls hit six straight wins for the first time in franchise history?  That streak - as well as their unbeaten home run - will be on the line Wednesday night, as the team faces a Chivas USA side with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428112017/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/17/red_bulls_send_juan_agudelo_to_chiv.php">some familiar faces</a>.  Thierry Henry and Wilman Conde are both expected to return to the lineup after their injuries.  It is the team&apos;s last league match before a three week break for FIFA dates, and the last league home match until June 24th.</p>
