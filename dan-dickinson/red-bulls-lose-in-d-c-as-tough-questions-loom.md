title: Red Bulls Lose In D.C. As Tough Questions Loom

<p>Six games into the 2014 MLS season, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111155/http://gothamist.com/tags/redbulls">New York Red Bulls</a> find themselves suffering from cognitive dissonance.  Saturday&apos;s 1-0 road loss to rival D.C. United saw a NY performance that was either &quot;played the way football should be played&quot; (per Thierry Henry) or &quot;absolute garbage&quot; (per RBNY fans).  From either perspective, the Red Bulls fell to 0-2-4, and remain looking for their first win of the season.</p>

<p><strong>FULL HIGHLIGHTS</strong></p>

<p><strong>MATCH NOTES</strong></p>

<p><em>Another game to chase.</em>  It took just four minutes for the goal to come.  A poorly defended corner kick saw the ball skipped over to Davy Arnaud, who easily put it away from close range.</p>

<p>As usual, the Red Bulls found themselves in a hole; as usual, that seemed to wake them up.  If only they could start a game without being asleep!</p>

<p><em>The offense was full of quantity, but not quality.</em>  The Red Bulls attack, lead by Thierry Henry and Peguy Luyindula, tried to hammer the DC goal.  Nineteen attempts on the evening should have given New York at least a goal, but only three were on target, all saved by Andrew Dykstra.</p>

<p>The attack misfired so much, the league helpfully put together <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111155/http://www.mlssoccer.com/video/2014/04/12/new-york-red-bulls-finishing-woes-vs-dc-united">a highlight package</a> of all the missed shots.  (It&apos;ll be helpful for those who want to learn how to not win a soccer match.)</p>

<p><em>Some perplexing substitutions.</em>  Looking back over the sub sheet, it&apos;s hard to understand quite what Mike Petke was striving for.</p>

<p>NY clearly needy an extra force on attack; Peguy Luyindula has traditionally thrived in the central attacking midfield position, and Eric Alexander had been struggling much of the match.  Do you sub out Alexander for a striker, and push Peguy back?  No; instead Jonny Steele, who was putting in a good performance on the left midfield, was sacrificied to make way for Bradley Wright-Phillips.  Do you make this change at halftime, and come out of the locker room with a new strategy?  No, you wait 25 minutes into the second half.</p>

<p>Alternately, consider Ruben Bover, who had shown a spark during pre-season.  He was only brought in during the 90th minute, giving him just three minutes of stoppage time to make a difference.  His contribution to the stat sheet: a single completed pass.</p>

<p>Hans Backe, the team&apos;s head coach from 2010-2012, used to talk about not making subs when he felt the players on the field were in control of the match.  It seems that Mike Petke is following that same pattern, failing to put on fresh legs when it could help turn a match because he thinks the goal is going to come.  Hopefully Mike won&apos;t suffer the same fate as the last time RBNY lost 1-0 to DC - Backe&apos;s last game - and lose his job.</p>

<p><em>Is &quot;continuity&quot; not worth it?</em>  The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111155/http://gothamist.com/2014/03/06/with_challenging_2014_ahead_red_bul.php">story of the off-season</a> from the Red Bulls was that they weren&apos;t gutting the roster, and that they were going to stick with their core players that succeeded in 2013.  But with six winless results, it&apos;s fair to ask if the &quot;consistency&quot; of keeping the same roster was actually what the team needed.</p>

<p>It also just so happened that the MLS Player&apos;s Union did their routine release of salary data last week, and there&apos;s a few whoppers on NY&apos;s books.  MLS pundits will warn not to put too much stock in the numbers because there are plenty of loopholes in building a team roster.  That may be, but there&apos;s no escaping that Bradley Wright-Phillips appears to have had a severely back-loaded contract, getting a 660% salary raise for 2014.  There&apos;s question marks around the value of dumping Brandon Barklage ($65k) for Richard Eckersley ($255k), even if Toronto is rumored to be picking up part of Eckersley&apos;s contract.</p>

<p>With the offense misfiring and the defense leaking goals during what was supposed to be the easy part of the season, some new blood would have probably been welcome.  It&apos;s anyone&apos;s guess as to what will happen when the schedule congestion truly begins this summer.  It doesn&apos;t appear that the Red Bulls have much cap room to acquire depth - and the bench is looking mighty thin, even if everyone was healthy.</p>

<p><strong>LOOKING AHEAD</strong></p>

<p>Perhaps some home cooking will help.  The Red Bulls start a two game home stand on Wednesday, first facing the maybe-kind-of-sort-of-a-rival Philadelphia Union.  The Union were lauded during the offseason for making smart roster choices, but have a penchant for letting games slip thanks to stupid defensive mistakes. (Sound familiar?)  In his tactical analysis this weekend, Matt Doyle dubbed the Union &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111155/http://www.mlssoccer.com/news/article/2014/04/12/armchair-analyst-how-philadelphia-union-have-become-most-frustrating-team-ml">the most frustrating team in MLS</a>&quot;.  We&apos;ll see if the Red Bulls can avoid making that title their own on Wednesday night.</p>

<p><strong>POST-MATCH REACTIONS</strong></p>

<p><strong>Coach Mike Petke on the match:</strong> &quot;Hats off to them, however, at the end of the day, we were the better team tonight, but the better team doesn&#x2019;t always win. I am very optimistic and very excited about a lot that I saw out of my players, but at the end of the day, we&#x2019;re in a results business and we didn&#x2019;t get the results...There were a ton of positives to take out of this game. For me, on one hand a lot more positives than negatives, but on the other hand, negative because we lost. It&#x2019;s a very jagged pill to swallow.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Thierry Henry on the performance:</strong> &quot;Today we played the way football should be played, but we didn&#x2019;t score. I&#x2019;m pretty positive about the way we can rectify that and continue to play the way we did in the second half.&quot;</p>
