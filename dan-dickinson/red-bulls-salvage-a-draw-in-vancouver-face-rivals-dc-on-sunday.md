<p>In their final trip to the west coast of the 2012 season, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111954/http://gothamist.com/tags/redbulls">New York Red Bulls</a> fought to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111954/http://www.mlssoccer.com/matchcenter/2012-06-20-van-v-ny">a tight 1-1 draw</a> against the Vancouver Whitecaps late Wednesday night.  Vancouver broke the deadlock in the 75th minute thanks to a Martin Bonjour goal, but NY&apos;s Heath Pearce would salvage a critical road point with a header off a short corner.</p>

<p>The Red Bulls mostly looked in better form than <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111954/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/18/red_bulls_still_cant_win_in_chicago.php">Sunday&apos;s horror show performance</a> against Chicago.  The defense managed to hold Vancouver to just a single shot on target, while the offense kept Joe Cannon busy and forced five saves.  One key downside to the game: Jamaican winger Dane Richards picked up his fifth yellow card of the season, forcing him to sit out the next game due with an automatic suspension.</p>

<p>That next game comes on Sunday evening, as the Red Bulls (8-4-3) host hated rivals DC United (9-4-3) who currently sit three points ahead of RBNY at the top of the Eastern Conference.  With sixteen years of bad blood between these teams and supporters again celebrating &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111954/https://twitter.com/#!/search/realtime/%23HateDCweek">Hate DC Week</a>&quot;, a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111954/http://www.bigapplesoccer.com/teams/redbulls2.php?article_id=30607">sold-out crowd is expected</a> for the derby.  With a six point swing on the line, a win could bring NY into a dead heat for first place, while a loss would have NY facing a 9 point gap to regain control of the conference.  Thierry Henry and Rafa Marquez, who didn&apos;t travel for the two-game road trip, are both expected back for the match.</p>
