A lone Thierry Henry goal was the difference maker, allowing New York to deal a serious blow to Houston&apos;s post-season hopes. </p>

<p><strong>FULL HIGHLIGHTS</strong></p>

<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="//web.archive.org/web/20150428110731if_/http://www.youtube.com/embed/KjPKY4_IQws" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p><strong>MATCH NOTES</strong></p>

<p><em>First half: lots of attack with nothing to show.</em>  An early goal would not come, as the combination of Houston defending, blown chances from New York&apos;s attackers, and hitting the woodwork would keep the score sheet 0-0 for the first half. Bradley Wright-Phillips continued his fight to claim the league&apos;s goalscoring record, but of his seven attempts, only one was on target.</p>

<p><em>Richard Eckersley came in from the cold.</em> &quot;It&#x2019;s soccer, you&#x2019;ve got to deal with and take the rough with the smooth and it makes you a better player, a better person as well because you&#x2019;ve had to come back from a setback.&quot;</p>

<p>So reflected Richard Eckersley, the English right-back who hadn&apos;t started for New York since the end of March. Largely out of favor, Eckersley was called into play because of what coach Mike Petke described as a mutual decision that rookie Chris Duvall needed a break &quot;both mentally and physically&quot;. And despite widespread doubts, &quot;Ecks&quot; played a strong game, providing fine defending and helping to bomb forward to contribute to the attack.</p>

<p>Teammate Dax McCarty heaped kudos on his mentality after the match: &quot;He came into the team, he&#x2019;s been patient and I thought he played with a real positive attacking intent and I thought he tried to link up and play forward. When you&#x2019;re out of the team for that long it can get tough, it can get mentally frustrating and I know he was frustrated but the opportunity presented itself and I think he deserved the opportunity and that&#x2019;s what staying patient is all about.&quot;</p>

<p><em>Henry broke the stalemate and continued his strong season.</em> The goal came shortly after the second half kickoff. Eckersley fed a ball forward to Lloyd Sam, who streaked down the right wing and worked into the box. A low cross was converged on by BWP and two Houston players, and rebounded right into the path of Thierry Henry, who cooly finished the ball.</p>

<p>Henry is now on double digits for both goals (10) and assists (13) in 2014. The rumor mill regarding his much-speculated retirement took a strange turn on Saturday morning as Red Bull Global Director of Football Gerard Houllier <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428110731/http://www.mlssoccer.com/news/article/2014/10/04/report-thierry-henry-could-extend-his-stay-new-york-red-bulls-gerard-houllie">walked back his comments</a> claiming he was leaving, with the same report indicating a one-year extension may be in the works.</p>

<p><em>Tim Cahill&apos;s situation gets weirder.</em> If there was one narrative that wouldn&apos;t die, it&apos;s the strange situation with Tim Cahill. It appeared that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428110731/http://www.empireofsoccer.com/sources-benching-country-29197/">Cahill might be benched</a> for Saturday&apos;s game, and his strongly worded comments to the media about playing for his country being a top priority caused chattered that he might be benched for accepting a call-up next week, in the middle of the playoff push.</p>

<p>Cahill was benched, but Petke lambasted the suggestion it was related to the call-up. &quot;To suggest that a player was not in the lineup because of an international call-up is both ridiculous and laughable. We had four games left, three now, that are huge. To suggest that we would leave a player who we think could help us out because he&#x2019;s going to the national team&#x2026;We&#x2019;re proud of him, we&#x2019;re proud of Roy [Miller], we&#x2019;re proud of [Ambroise] Oyongo for going to the national team.&quot;</p>

<p>So then why would the high-priced Australian attacker start the game on the bench? Again, we go to Petke: &quot;The selection process for tonight&#x2019;s game went as this: I wanted to put the 11 players out that I felt could get us a result and we got a result.&quot;</p>

<p>So while Petke did not feel Cahill could get the team a result, he did call on him late in the game. Cahill subbed in for a cramped-up Eric Alexander in the 85th minute. Three minutes later, Cahill went in hard on a challenge on Houston&apos;s Boniek Garc&#xED;a, and referee Jair Maruffo showed a straight red card.</p>

<p>Perhaps the entire situation over the past few days had impacted Cahill&apos;s mentality and lead to a stupid challenge. Perhaps he was fully in control and just had bad luck with his typically physical play. Either way, it doesn&apos;t help his case with the team: Cahill can&apos;t serve his mandatory suspension while on international duty next week, so he will miss both of the remaining home games in the RBNY regular season.</p>

<p><strong>LOOKING AHEAD</strong></p>

<p>Michael Bradley, Jermain Defoe, and the rest of Toronto FC return to town hungry for a victory. Toronto fell 3-0 to the rampant Los Angeles Galaxy last night, in a match coach Greg Vanney said &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428110731/http://www.mlssoccer.com/news/article/2014/10/05/games-hand-toronto-fc-coach-greg-vanney-says-match-la-galaxy-wasnt-must-win">wasn&apos;t a must-win</a>&quot;. Rest assured their game against the Red Bulls will be: Toronto sits three points below the red line. Toronto has the upper hand in the series this year, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428110731/http://gothamist.com/2014/05/18/beatdown_at_bmo_toronto_fc_2_red_bu.php">winning at home</a> in May and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428110731/http://gothamist.com/2014/06/28/mls_resumes_as_red_bulls_chase_toro.php">forcing a road draw</a> in June. It&apos;s certainly must-win for New York: a full three points will cement their playoff hopes, and almost completely shut Toronto out of the playoffs for the eighth time in their eight year history.</p>

<p><em>Next Match: Saturday, October 11th 7:00 PM, vs. Toronto (TV: MSG)</em></p>
