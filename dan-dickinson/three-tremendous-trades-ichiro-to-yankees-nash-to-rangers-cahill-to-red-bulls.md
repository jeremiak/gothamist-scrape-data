The Yankees <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111845/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/24/sports/baseball/ichiro-suzuki-acquired-by-yankees-in-trade-with-mariners.html">traded for Ichiro Suzuki</a>, the Rangers finally <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111845/http://sports.yahoo.com/news/jackets-trade-rick-nash-rangers-193006498--nhl.html">landed Rick Nash</a>, and Everton agreed to terms to send Tim Cahill to the New York Red Bulls.</p>

<p>Ichiro, dubbed &quot;one of the best pure hitters of our generation&quot; by ESPN, comes to NY from Seattle in exchange for pitching prospects D.J. Mitchell and Danny Farquhar, as well as some cash considerations.  The 38-year-old left fielder has only ever played for Seattle, where he accumulated 2,533 hits in 12 seasons.  </p>

<p>His 2012 has not been great&#x2014;managing only a .261 batting average&#x2014;leading to questions about his future with the Mariners.  But Ichiro will have a chance to silence his doubters tonight, as he&apos;s eligible to play when the Yankees face Seattle later tonight.</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2012_07_rnash.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111845im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2012_07_rnash.jpg" width="250" height="181" class="image-left"> </span>The Rangers completed a deal they had been chasing back in February, acquiring left wing Rick Nash from the Columbus Blue Jackets.  The Rangers gave up plenty in exchange, sending Brandon Dubinsky, Artem Anisimov, and Tim Erixon as well as a first-round draft pick in 2013 the other way.  </p>

<p>Nash had explicitly requested a trade and had eyes for the Rangers, telling ESPN &quot;In finding a team, I just thought the Rangers were perfect...Last season they were obviously one of the best teams and I think it was just a great fit for my style and for me to play there.&quot;</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2012_07_tcahill.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111845im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2012_07_tcahill.jpg" width="250" height="182" class="image-right"> </span>Lastly, in a move that may finally fill the Red Bulls third designated player spot, Everton FC <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111845/http://www.evertonfc.com/news/archive/2012/07/23/blues-agree-cahill-deal">announced they had reached terms</a> with the Red Bulls to send Australian Tim Cahill to MLS.  Cahill joined the Toffees in 2004 and became known for his aerial ability,  scoring 56 goals in 226 appearances.  </p>

<p>The deal won&apos;t be completed until personal terms are reached and a physical is completed; the Red Bulls <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111845/http://www.newyorkredbulls.com/news/2012/07/red-bulls-release-statement-tim-cahill-1">issued a statement</a> that acknowledged Everton&apos;s statement but refused to comment.</p>
