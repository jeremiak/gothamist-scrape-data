</div></div>					<p>For many, the five-game unbeaten streak of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111531/http://gothamist.com/tags/redbulls">New York Red Bulls</a> was enough evidence that the team was &quot;for real&quot;.  But some wanted a statement win&#x2014;and pointed that Sunday&apos;s game against the MLS champion LA Galaxy as the statement that needed to be made.  Late heroics were the order of the day again, as Tim Cahill headed home a game winner in the closing minutes to give New York a 1-0 victory.</p>

<p><strong>FULL HIGHLIGHTS</strong></p>

<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111531if_/http://www.youtube.com/embed/PCqYbd4uEVQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p><strong>THE GOOD</strong></p>

<p><em>Tim Cahill.</em> The Australian was ever-present throughout the game, filling in the box-to-box role that Dax McCarty typically plays.  He lead the team with 46 passes, he mopped up on defense, and he fought forward into the box to create chances.</p>

<p>And yes, he found the back of the net - his fourth goal in five games, and his third game winning goal this year.  Juninho&apos;s long range free kick in stoppage time found Cahill&apos;s head, allowing him to skim the ball past a statuesque Carlo Cudicini to snatch a win out of what looked like a draw.  It&apos;s those </p>

<p><em>The defense.</em>  LA&apos;s occasionally fearsome offense, who had no problem putting four past Philadelphia in a mid-week game, looked out of sorts at Red Bull Arena.  Were they fatigued?  Sure.  But don&apos;t take anything away from New York&apos;s defense.  32 interceptions, 33 recoveries, five clearances, and five blocks across the starting four is a big part of what kept LA off the score sheet today.  Luis Robles did well too, making a few clutch saves to deny LA in one-on-one situations.</p>

<p><em>RBNY leading the form table.</em>  There is no team hotter in MLS right now than the New York Red Bulls.  With 19 points out of their last 24 (6-1-1), they are tied for top of the overall table with FC Dallas.  More importantly, they continue to push for points as teams with games in hand start to lose pace.  On a points-per-game basis, they are now ranked 3rd in the league with 1.71 - behind FC Dallas and Montreal, who both are averaging 2.</p>

<p><strong>THE BAD</strong></p>

<p><em>Henry held shotless (again).</em>  For the second time this year, Thierry Henry didn&apos;t get a single shot off - and this time it was at home.  Have MLS defenders figured out how to box Henry out of games?</p>

<p><em>The quality of play.</em>  Blame it on the weird misting rain coming down at the stadium, but it was a sloppy sort of game.  Strangely parallel comments from players in both locker rooms indicated that neither team believed either team played particularly well.</p>

<p><strong>THE UGLY</strong></p>

<p><em>The reaction to the &quot;US Reject&quot; chant aimed at Landon Donovan.</em>  The South Ward - Red Bull Arena&apos;s three sections of supporters - have a habit of trying to get under opposing players&apos; skins.  From chanting &quot;BRIDGET NIELSEN&quot; at SKC goalkeeper Jimmy Nielsen, to &quot;FEED YOUR WIFE, BECKHAM&quot; chants, to signs imploring Charlie Davies not to drink and drive after an accident nearly ended his career/life, New York&apos;s supporters have a reputation for creatively cruel chants.</p>

<p>In the second half of the match, Landon Donovan was greeted with &quot;US REJECT&quot; chant.  With Donovan <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111531/http://articles.latimes.com/2013/may/17/sports/la-sp-usa-world-cup-20130517">not called up to the national team camp</a> this month, it was considered fair game - especially with some fans considering that he &quot;abandoned&quot; the USMNT with his sabbatical.  Regardless of the reason, reaction by ESPN&apos;s commentary team and from Twitter pundits was swift.</p>

<p>The South Ward is unlikely to be swayed by accusations of classlessness.  But for the critics, it&apos;s worth remembering that no matter how accomplished you might be for your country, a club match doesn&apos;t guarantee you deference or honor from opposing fans.</p>

<p><strong>LOOKING AHEAD</strong></p>

<p>The Columbus Crew returns to Red Bull Arena next Sunday.  When they met just a few weeks ago, Cahill&apos;s late goal stole a similar 1-0 result.  Last year when they came to town, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111531/http://gothamist.com/2012/09/16/unbelievable_henry_goal_powers_red.php">Thierry Henry put on a show</a>. With the Crew not living up to expectations, chances are good that the Red Bulls can keep rolling for another week.</p>

<p><strong>POST-MATCH REACTIONS</strong></p>

<p><strong>Coach Mike Petke on the win:</strong> &quot;It&#x2019;s a huge win for us and the organization. It&#x2019;s a quality team. I thought they had the better of us for sure in the first half. I thought we had very good moments in the first half, but I thought that they had the better play. It&#x2019;s a team that&#x2019;s won two championships, playing the same style that they&#x2019;ve had enough time to perfect it and make it their own in a way. I thought the second half we came out with a better understanding of what we wanted to do, some bite and took it to &#x2018;em with it.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Forward Thierry Henry on lessons learned:</strong> &quot;I don&#x2019;t think we played well today, I don&#x2019;t think that LA deserved to lose. I actually thought they way they were playing, especially at the end that they deserved to win the game, but since I&#x2019;ve been here I think we would have lost that game before. The thing that I learned today is that we can win these types of games...I will agree with you, we are playing well and we won the game. We also learned that if we maybe meet them later, we have to be a bit better.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Tim Cahill on whether the team is different than the start of the season:</strong> &quot;Our team different? No it&#x2019;s not different. I just think we were unlucky. You know when you start with new staff and new players, it takes time for the ingredients to actually mix together and become something special. Still at the moment, we are still working on it. It was a period we had of understanding each other and the main thing is with football, you have to concentrate on the team ethic, not individuals, nothing like that. You have to make sure everyone knows their job. You might not be playing but you might have to come up for ten minutes at the end. When Dax came on, I told him that&#x2019;s what it&#x2019;s all about. It&#x2019;s about integrating players, understanding your jobs, understanding this is a long season and we have to play for each other and not as individuals.&quot;</p>
