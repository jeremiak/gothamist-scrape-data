<p>The curse of Toyota Park continues.  Since the Chicago Fire&apos;s stadium opened in 2006, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111959/http://gothamist.com/tags/redbulls&quot;">New York Red Bulls</a> have never been able to walk out of the Windy City with a win.  Despite being fresh and rested from a three week international break, a three point result eluded them again, as the team (and their six game unbeaten streak) fell 3-1 Sunday in a match that&apos;s sure to once again ignite calls for goal-line technology.</p>

<p>The international break ending allowed New York to field a mostly regular lineup, but both Thierry Henry and Rafa Marquez missed the road trip due to reported injury.  Chicago leapt to a lead in just the fourth minute as Patrick Nyarko eluded Roy Miller and knocked home a  header.  The Red Bulls would not find much to work with in the first half, but came out swinging in the second half and was rewarded when a corner kick found Dax McCarty who headed home the tying goal.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later, Fire fans were infuriated by a goal that wasn&apos;t awarded.  Dominic Oduro attempted a shot from the top of the box, and Ryan Meara&apos;s save wasn&apos;t enough to divert the ball from the path towards the goal.  Wilman Conde rushed in to clear the ball, but was unable to do so before the ball completely crossed the goal line.  It was a clear goal, but neither referee Baldomero Toledo, nor the assistant referee, made the call and the game played on.</p>

<p>Fueled by being denied the go-ahead goal, Chicago took it to the Red Bulls.  Gonzalo Segares would score from close range three minutes later in a goal widely described as &quot;justice&quot;, and Chris Rolfe would notch a third ten minutes from full time.  New York looked gassed in the hot weather, and left the field with their heads down and their six-game undefeated streak snapped.</p>

<p>Now in third place with an 8-4-2 record, the Red Bulls travel straight to Vancouver to take on the Whitecaps on Wednesday, then return home for a critical Sunday night clash against Eastern Conference leaders DC United.  With memories of last year&apos;s summer slump fresh in many fan&apos;s minds, NY will have to find some points in a difficult week if they are to avoid slipping down the table.</p>

<p><em>Next match: Wednesday June 20 11PM ET, at Vancouver (TV: MSG+)</em></p>
