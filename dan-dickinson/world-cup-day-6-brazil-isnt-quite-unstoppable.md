<p>Tuesday&apos;s World Cup action taught us not to count out Belgium, to believe in the power of Mexican goalkeeping (but not Russians), and that yes, they do have players who can kick the ball with both feet.</p>

<p><em>Last Night&apos;s Action</em></p>

<p><strong>Belgium 2, Algeria 1</strong> (HIGHLIGHTS) Algeria was the latest team to suffer the curse of scoring first. Goals from substitutes Marouane Fellaini and Dries Mertens erased an Algerian first-half penalty kick goal and gave Belgium the full three points to take the lead in Group H.</p>

<p><strong>Mexico 0, Brazil 0</strong> (HIGHLIGHTS) Turns out Brazil isn&apos;t quite unstoppable. Mexican goalkeeper Guillermo Ochoa stood on his head, making incredible save after incredible save to deny the hosts a goal. The result leaves both teams even on four points (with Brazil holding the edge in goal differential) going into the final match of group play.</p>

<p><strong>Russia 1, South Korea 1</strong> (HIGHLIGHTS) Ochoa&apos;s performance against Brazil drained the tournament of any lingering skill, as Russian goalkeeper Igor Akinfeev bungled an easily saved shot into his own net to give the South Koreans the lead. Russia would later equalize during chaos in front of the South Korean box, with Alexandr Kerzhakov pinging the ball in to salvage the result.</p>

<p><em>The Play To Watch</em></p>

<p>We&apos;ve been so focused on goal scorers with these highlights, but Tuesday thankfully let us remember the difference between good goalkeeping:</p>

<p>And bad goalkeeping:</p>

<p><em>Today&apos;s Matches</em></p>

<p><strong>Australia vs. Netherlands</strong> (12PM ET, ESPN) If Australia are going to find their way to the Round of 16, they&apos;ll need to overcome the Dutch side that shocked Spain in the opener. Another resounding victory for the Dutch would almost assuredly put them through to the next round.</p>

<p><strong>Spain vs. Chile</strong> (3PM ET, ESPN) The current champions will need a full three points (and a multi-goal margin of victory wouldn&apos;t hurt) if they&apos;re to avoid crashing out of the tournament early. For Chile, even a draw would be a statement result.</p>

<p><strong>Cameroon vs. Croatia</strong> (6PM ET, ESPN) Croatia will be looking to avenge what they felt was an unfair result against the hosts in the opening match of the tournament. Cameroon will want to get anything they can out of this match. A loss for either team would make them the first ones from Group A to be eliminated from the tournament. </p>

<p><em>What Else Is Going On?</em></p>

<p>Twenty-one people <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428110957/http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/18/nigeria-world-cup-bomb-boko-haram">were killed in an explosion</a> at a Nigerian World Cup viewing center, in an attack that&apos;s being attributed to Boko Haram militants.</p>

The German coach could not understand why Bryant still received huge contract extensions while his best days are behind him.</p>

<p>Mike Francesa finally broke his self-imposed &quot;I&apos;m not talking about soccer&quot; rule to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428110957/http://deadspin.com/mike-francesa-has-a-lot-of-dumb-questions-about-soccer-1592143944">ask a lot of dumb questions about soccer</a>.

<p>The US victory also got the Taiwanese Animation treatment:</p>
