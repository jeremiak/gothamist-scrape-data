title: Red Bulls Defy The Odds With 1-0 Win In Los Angeles

(New YorkRed Bulls)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>No one expected much out of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428112040/http://gothamist.com/tags/redbulls">New York Red Bulls</a> in their only 2012 league match against 2011 MLS Cup champions LA Galaxy.  On paper, a full strength LA and a depleted Red Bulls sounded less like the &quot;1 Percent Derby&quot; and more like the 1% hosting the 99%.  But even without its highest paid players, the Metro side made waves with a defensive 1-0 win at the Home Depot Center.</p>

<p>With team captain and leading scorer Thierry Henry out for a month with the hamstring strain, Hans Backe shifted to a 4-1-4-1 lineup.  The same inexperienced defensive line that posted <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428112040/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/29/red_bulls_post_a_costly_shutout_win.php">the team&apos;s unexpected first shutout</a> again saw the field, with Dax McCarty providing coverage above them.  Jan Gunnar Solli returned from his calf injury and saw a start in midfield with Lindpere, Richards, and Ballouchy.  Kenny Cooper served as a lone striker.   </p>

<p>Team stalwart Joel Lindpere knocked in the only goal of the match in the 19th minute, his long-awaited first of the season.  Jan Gunnar Solli found him in the box, and with Beckham chasing in and defenders closing rapidly, Lindpere cooly cut the ball through traffic and past goalkeeper Bill Gaudette.  It would be New York&apos;s only attempt on target of the night, as LA would dominate the game and hold 63% of possession.</p>

<p>The youthful defense came up big against LA&apos;s expensive and high powered attack.  Markus Holgersson made a goal-line save to deny Robbie Keane, reminiscent of Tim Ream&apos;s denial of Landon Donovan in the same matchup last year.  Ryan Meara continued to impress, playing his heart out and making five huge saves, including a beautiful tip over the crossbar to deny a swerving long-range shot from Juninho late.</p>

<p>The 5-3-1 Red Bulls remain in third place in the Eastern Conference, and face a quick turnaround with a battle at home against Houston awaiting on Wednesday night.  The LA Galaxy meanwhile remain stuck near the bottom of the Western Conference, having managed only one point out of nine over the last week.</p>

<p><strong>POST-MATCH REACTIONS</strong></p>

<p>Coach Hans Backe, on the team&apos;s defensive performance: &#x201C;It&#x2019;s such an un-experienced back four, I think they have 20 games together, and it is their second clean sheet. The whole team just worked their ass off. Normally when you have so many starters out you are forced to defend and they did in phenomenally. It was a definite team effort. They were under pressure but didn&#x2019;t allow them a real opportunity, a lot of crosses and half chances, and Ryan once again was phenomenal.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Midfielder Joel Lindpere, on his goal: &quot;I actually don&#x2019;t really remember, I think I passed it to Solli and he has some space, I ran with him and he passed it back to me. I took the first touch and a little bit unlucky second touch, I had to make it quick because I saw players coming so I tried to chip it in. It was too many touches in a short time but that is what it&#x2019;s all about, being ready to use these chances against good teams. It was a great attack and a good finish.&#x201D;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428112040/http://twitter.com/#!/petkemike/status/198967668336898048">Assistant Coach Mike Petke</a>: &quot;Proud as hell but my anxiety level is still thru the roof. Great job tonight Bulls. Now on to the next 1 wednesday&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428112040/http://twitter.com/#!/Truthven/status/198977309280182272">Defender Tyler Ruthven</a>: &quot;To everyone who thought we would get routed tonight...ah thank you ;)&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428112040/http://twitter.com/#!/RMeara_18/status/198991212693291008">Goalkeeper Ryan Meara</a>: &quot;Another great performance and 3points. I could get used to this shutout thing.&quot;</p>

<p>LA Midfielder David Beckham, on the loss: &#x201C;It&#x2019;s getting even more frustrating week after week. New York came here they worked hard, they came here to get us on the break, and then defend with all of their players. It was successful for them tonight. Sometimes it&#x2019;s not the prettiest way of playing but it can be effective. We tried to break them down, we had our chances, we didn&#x2019;t finish the chances we had and we got sloppy in defense with a couple of plays.&#x201D;</p>
