In a city full of bars showing the games, where do you go to watch the games? Perhaps you want a raucus soccer pub or a giant beer garden. Maybe you&apos;d rather visit a nice restaurant or cocktail bar that has the games on. Or it could just be that you&apos;re looking for the places that will give you free drinks when a particular team scores.</p>
