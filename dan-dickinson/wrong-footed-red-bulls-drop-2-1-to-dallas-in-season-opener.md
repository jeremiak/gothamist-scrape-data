<p>2012 was supposed to be a fresh start for the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428112136/http://gothamist.com/tags/redbulls">New York Red Bulls</a>, one where the team will make a serious run at the MLS Cup or Supporter&apos;s Shield.  But fans can already be heard muttering &quot;Same Old Metro&quot; as the team <a hef="http://www.mlssoccer.com/matchcenter/2012-03-11-dal-v-ny/recap">dropped a 2-1 result</a> at FC Dallas Stadium to start the 2012 season yesterday.</p>

<p>With Luke Rodgers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428112136/http://www.newyorkredbulls.com/news/2012/03/statement-luke-rodgers">still trying to get his visa renewed</a> with the State Department, coach Hans Backe paired Thierry Henry with Juan Agudelo.  Rafael Marquez&apos;s suspension from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428112136/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/31/red_bulls_lose_0-1_to_la_in_first_s.php">last season&apos;s fracas with LA</a> gave Dax McCarty a start in midfield.  In defense, Stephen Keel stepped in for an injured Wiman Conde in the back line to pair with Markus Holgersson, and Fordham rookie Ryan Meara earned his first start between the posts. </p>

<p>Dallas took an early lead in the 11th minute after the Red Bulls back line failed twice to clear the ball from danger. Dallas won the ball back and fed the ball to defender Zach Loyd. With Ryan Meara unable to get a good look at the ball, Loyd slotted the ball into the far post and forced NY to chase the remainder of the game.</p>

<p>New York wouldn&apos;t get a sniff at the goal until the 43rd minute, when a quick Thierry Henry free kick pinged off the woodwork. With New York starting to look hungry in the second half, an equalizer seemed possible, but another defensive miscue deflated the team.  After a misplaced pass from Roy Miller, FCD striker Ricardo Villar broke free in the box and chipped Meara to extend Dallas&apos; lead.</p>

<p>For the majority of the match, New York looked much as they did last year - lacking a creative force in midfield, holding 63% of the possession but having little to show for it.  Hope of a comeback entered the game with Kenny Cooper&apos;s substitution for Dane Richards in the 63rd minute. It only took 15 minutes for him to strike a <em>golazo</em> against his former club.  Thierry Henry sent a prefect lobbed ball into the box and found Cooper, who chipped the ball high over an onrushing Kevin Hartman and in.  Despite surging late, RBNY was unable to find an equalizer, leaving them empty handed after ninety minutes.</p>

<p>It was the team&apos;s first loss to Dallas since July 4th, 2009.  The Red Bulls will hope to end a losing streak of their own next Saturday when they battle away at Real Salt Lake, where they have yet to win in regular season play.  While it is still early in the season, the pressure on Coach Backe and GM Erik Soler will continue to increase to show results before it is too late.</p>
