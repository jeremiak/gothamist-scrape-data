<p>They&apos;re still a year away from joining MLS, but New York City FC made a splash this morning by unveiling the two final design options for their new team badge.  Fans can vote on either badge today through Thursday; the final badge will be unveiled in an event on March 20th.</p>

<p>A press release from the club explained the foundation of the badge designs, both of which were designed by Rafael Esquer of Alfalfa Studios:</p>

<blockquote>Urban artifacts like subway tokens and architectural details found throughout the city also serves as inspiration for both designs. The two badges feature the typeface Gotham, a wholly American font inspired by the City&#x2019;s signage. Born out of an in-depth study of building lettering in New York City, the monogram reflects the rich graphic language that is so much a signature of the five boroughs. The colors navy blue, white and orange are drawn from the New York City flag.</blockquote>

<p>The first badge borrows the Shield iconography from the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430035315/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seal_of_New_York_City">Seal of New York City</a>.  The club provided this justification:</p>

<blockquote>The shield is the result of extensive research into global soccer. Seeking to give the Club a unique and distinctive character within MLS, we examined badges from every professional soccer team in the world. In the end, we found the answer right here at home. This design features the historic shield of the official Seal of New York City - a mark that signifies the pioneering spirit of the early settlers, which in the modern era, has fueled America&#x2019;s undoubted move onto the world soccer stage. It is a classic and dignified badge, meant to be worn with sincerity, ambition, determination and pride.</blockquote>

<p>The second badge was inspired by the subway token, and features a fair amount of that famous Manchester City sky blue. More justification!</p>

<blockquote>The circular badge is inspired by the old New York City Subway Token, created by the Transit Authority in 1953 and used for 50 years as the standard fare for a ride. The last version of the token had a cut out pentagon in the center representing the five boroughs, similar to what appears on either side of the monogram, to reinforce the Club&#x2019;s connection to entire city. The circle is also a symbol of unity, wholeness and infinity, and is often associated with potential and the number one. This is a modern and confident badge that clearly speaks to New York City&#x2019;s status as a leading city.</blockquote>

<p>If you feel strongly about either (or just like voting on things), you can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430035315/http://nycfc.com/vote">vote now through Thursday</a> for your favorite.</p>
