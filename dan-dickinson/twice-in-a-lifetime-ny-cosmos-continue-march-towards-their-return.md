<p>When we last checked in on the New York Cosmos, they had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111652/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/16/goal_cosmos_want_to_build_a_stadium.php">a $400M stadium proposal</a>, one coach, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111652/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/13/this_week_in_soccer_rafa_marquez_le.php">one player</a> on the roster.  A return to the field still felt very far off&#x2014;but with a constant flow of new player and coaching signings, the Cosmos are making steady progress towards their return to the field after nearly 30 years this August.</p>

<p>Let&apos;s start on the field.  The Cosmos have signed an additional six players&#x2014;largely young players with MLS or international experience&#x2014;to join the already signed Carlos Mendes.  Kyle Reynish, who spent six years in Real Salt Lake as a backup to Nick Rimando, was signed as the team&apos;s first goalkeeper.  Hunter Freeman and Korey Veeder will join the defensive line, Dane Murphy while Stefan Dimitrov is the team&apos;s lone forward at the current time.</p>

<p>The most intriguing signing thus far is that of Ayoze Garcia, a 27 year old Spanish left winger who arrives at the Cosmos directly from the Spanish first division La Liga.  Ayoze had spent two years at Sporting Gijon; their relegation at the end of the 2011/2012 season triggered a release clause in his contract.  Going from one of the top leagues in the world to the second division in the US seems like a strange jump, but the history of the Cosmos and the opportunity to play in a city like New York were key attractors.</p>

<p>But it may not just be the appeal of the team&apos;s history that are drawing players in.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111652/http://www.empireofsoccer.com/hunter-freeman-cosmos-offered-a-better-deal-than-revolution/">Speaking to Empire of Soccer</a> shortly after he signed, Hunter Freeman said that the Cosmos offer &quot;was right on par, maybe even a little bit better&quot; than a competing offer from the New England Revolution.  He added, &quot;I was really impressed not only with the professionalism of the club already but the vision they have. I think it shows the aspirations of the club and what they want to do.&quot;</p>

<p>That vision has been supplemented not only with players, but with additional coaches.  Carlos Llamosa and Alecko Eskandrian both have joined the team as assistant coaches.  Llamosa spent four years as an assistant coach to Chivas USA after retiring from play, while Eskandrian briefly served as the Philadelphia Union youth technical director.  (Eskandrian has a family connection with the club; his father Andranik was a defender for the club in their heyday.)  The Cosmos also plucked Seton Hall goalkeeping coach Guillermo &quot;Memo&quot; Valencia to round out the coaching staff.</p>

<p>With the pieces coming together, all that remained was the day of their return.  That day will be August 3rd, which will see the Cosmos host the Fort Lauderdale Strikers at James M. Shuart Stadium in Hempstead.  The match against their longtime rivals will open their three-month, fourteen-game Fall NASL season.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111652/http://nycosmos.com/tickets">Season tickets are available now</a>.</p>
