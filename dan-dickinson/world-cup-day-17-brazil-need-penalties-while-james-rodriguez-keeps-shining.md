<p>Saturdays&apos;s World Cup action brought us Brazil squeaking by Chile on penalties, a new candidate for best goal of the tournament, Astoria in celebration, and explanations that what looks like biting may just be falling into someone teeth first.</p>

<p><em>Last Night&apos;s Action</em></p>

<p><strong>Brazil 1, Chile 1 (Brazil wins 3:2 on penalties)</strong> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428110914/http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/videos/highlights/match=300186487/index.html">HIGHLIGHTS</a>) What a start to the knockout round! Brazil took an early lead in the 18th minute, off what was officially ruled as David Luiz&apos;s first ever international goal (it looked like it could&apos;ve easily been a Gonzolo Jara own goal). Chile would not collapse, taking the match to the hosts and equalizing in the 32nd on an Alexis Sanchez finish. </p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="2014_06_hulk.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428110914im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2014_06_hulk.jpg" width="640" height="426"> <br> <i> HULK LIKE WIN (AP)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>Ninety minutes turned to 120, and it looked like Chile had it in them to upset Brazil, but after being denied by the crossbar in the dying moments, the match would go to nail-biting penalties. Brazilian goalkeeper Julio Cesar would make two big saves, but in the end it was the woodwork that would end Chile&apos;s tournament, as Jara&apos;s final penalty pinged off the post and out.</p>

<p><strong>Colombia 2, Uruguay 0</strong> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428110914/http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/videos/highlights/match=300186491/index.html">HIGHLIGHTS</a>) Easily a game that symbolized the state of both teams. Uruguay looked distracted and frustrated by the Luis Suarez circus, and their physical play tried to disrupt the flow of the match. But Colombia, who has looked fantastic this tournament, danced their way through to the quarterfinals thanks to two more quality goals from 22-year-old James Rodriguez. Rodriguez scored an unreal individual goal to open the match (see below), and tapped home a headed ball from Juan Cuadrado for the insurance goal. It&apos;s the first time Colombia has ever advanced beyond the Round of 16 in tournament history.</p>

<p><em>The Plays To Watch</em></p>

<p>For the moment, there&apos;s only one King James that matters. James Rodriguez scored both of the goals in Colombia&apos;s win over Uruguay, and the first - a chested ball that he struck on the volley while turning from 25 yards - is one of the best goals of the tournament.</p>

<p>And here&apos;s Chile&apos;s World Cup dreams being ended by the woodwork during the penalty shootout:</p>

<p><em>Today&apos;s Matches</em></p>

<p><strong>Netherlands vs. Mexico</strong> (12PM ET, ESPN) </p>

<p>A tough test for both teams. The Dutch blitzed through Group B with offense, scoring 10 goals (including five against Spain) in three games. Mexico rode their defense to escape Group A, allowing only a single goal and shutting out Brazil. Strong traveling support for both teams should make this fun. More than anything else, we just want to see <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428110914/http://www.cbc.ca/sports/soccer/brazil2014/miguel-herrera-mexican-coach-becomes-internet-star-1.2690870">Miguel Herrera do his thing</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Costa Rica vs. Greece</strong> (4PM ET, ESPN) </p>

<p>Costa Rica shocked Group D: perceived as the easily brushed aside underdogs in a tough group, they not only helped to knock out Italy and England, they won the group. Greece left very few impressed with their performance in Group C, advancing with a -2 goal differential and having scored only twice. Both teams are looking to advance to the Quarterfinals for the first time in history.</p>

<p><em>What Else Is Going On?</em></p>

<p>It&apos;s no surprise that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428110914/http://gothamist.com/2014/06/28/video_astoria_erupts_in_huge_celebr.php">Astoria was feeling celebratory</a> after the Brazil and Colombia wins.</p>

<p>Before he was banned, Luis Suarez testified to FIFA that he didn&apos;t bite Giorgio Chiellini: he merely <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428110914/http://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/28069689">lost his balance and fell into him teeth-first</a>.</p>

<p>In other biting news (<em>how is it that we have other biting news?</em>), authorities are trying to seek an English football fan who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428110914/http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jun/28/england-fan-ear-bitten-off-world-cup-brazil">bit part of the ear</a> off another English fan. The incident happened at the Uruguay-England match, days before Suarez&apos;s bite.</p>

<p>Lebron James approves of James Rodriguez&apos;s performance:</p>
