<p>Number one at last! The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428112028/http://gothamist.com/tags/redbulls">New York Red Bulls</a> continue their perfect run in May, picking up <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428112028/http://www.mlssoccer.com/matchcenter/2012-05-13-phi-v-ny/recap">a comeback road win</a> in a Mother&apos;s Day grudge match over the Philadelphia Union.  With their fourth straight win, they now sit on top of the Eastern Conference for the first time this season.</p>

<p>In their third game in a week, the Red Bulls saw the return of two starters: Roy Miller, back at left back from his knee effusion, and Rafa Marquez, back from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428112028/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/19/again_rafa_marquez_suspended_three.php">his suspension</a> (and soft injury) in midfield.  While the Union controlled the game early, the Red Bulls struck first, with Joel Lindpere collecting Mehdi Ballouchy&apos;s pass to blast a shot past Zac MacMath after 17 minutes.</p>

<p>Philly would answer back later in the half, as Freddy Adu crossed the ball to an unmarked Lionard Pajoy to level the game.  The goal was the first RBNY had given up in 324 minutes of play, earning Ryan Meara the fifth best in team history and the record for an MLS rookie goalkeeper.</p>

<p>Right before the end of the first half, the complexion of the game changed radically. Freddy Adu, in the middle of his best effort since joining the Union last year, went down without any contact in the box.  Referee Jorge Gonzalez reacted harshly, issuing a yellow card to Adu for diving&#x2014;and with Adu already on a yellow for a rough tackle earlier in the game, he was sent off.  Debate rages on as to whether it was a dive or merely Adu losing his balance, and whether or not the card was justified.</p>

<p>While New York started the second half with a man advantage, the Union refused to lie down, and Pajoy found his second goal just 22 seconds after kickoff.  While defender Markus Holgersson was largely at fault for giving up the goal, he made amends deeper into the half, leveling the game by heading home a corner kick for his first goal of the season.  Ten minutes later, Kenny Cooper silenced the Sons of Ben by rounding past MacMath and scoring a tight angle go-ahead goal&#x2014;his ninth tally of the season.</p>

<p>Rather than focusing on defense after losing Adu, Union boss Peter Nowak used all his substitutions for attacking players, determined to continue to press the game.  The Union should have equalized or won the match, but will be left ruing moments like Michael Farfan missing an open net from 2 yards out.  Ryan Meara continued to shine (even with his &quot;rookie hazing&quot; buzzcut hairdo), notching four big saves and keeping New York alive in the face of 21 attempts from Philadelphia.</p>

<p>The win marks the first points RBNY have earned at PPL Park since the Union joined the league in 2010.  The 7-3-1 Red Bulls now hold the top spot in the East, with a single point lead over Sporting Kansas City (who have a game in hand).  New York will get to rest and recuperate most of the week before heading north for their second match of the season against newcomer side Montreal.  The Impact (3-5-3) will be looking for revenge after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428112028/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/01/thierry_henry_makes_an_impact_in_5-.php">receiving a 5-2 thrashing</a> at Red Bull Arena last month.</p>

<p>The Red Bulls also received troubling news on Saturday as injured Colombian defender Wilman Conde was arrested and charged with aggravated assault on a police officer.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428112028/http://www.northjersey.com/fortlee/Fort_Lee_police_Red_Bulls_player_charged_in_aggravated_assault.html">According to NorthJersey.com</a>, police officers responded to a 5:30 a.m. noise complaint at a Fort Lee apartment where Conde was present.  When officers attempted to identify a female guest, Conde allegedly became aggressive and pushed one of the officers.</p>

<p>Conde was released on his own recognizance pending a court date.  The team will investigate the matter on Monday and disciplinary action is likely, with Hans Backe <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428112028/http://www.nypost.com/p/blogs/soccerblog/red_bulls_likely_speak_with_arrested_UfYRNRfiqDzCkv7Qc9sxXL">telling the Post</a> &quot;Something will of course happen. I don&apos;t know if the league will step in, but the team will.&quot;</p>

<p><em>Next Match: Saturday May 19 7:30 PM, At Montreal Impact (TV: MSG)</em></p>
