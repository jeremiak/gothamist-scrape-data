<p>If there&apos;s one thing Red Bulls and DC United fans might agree on&#x2014;emphasis on <em>might</em>&#x2014;it&apos;s that the league has screwed them both.  Wednesday&apos;s second leg of the playoff series between the rivals was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111711/http://www.mlssoccer.com/news/article/2012/11/07/ny-dc-postponed-until-thursday-due-blizzard-conditions-red-bull-arena">postponed to Thursday</a> - but only after fans from both teams had slogged through <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111711/http://gothamist.com/2012/11/08/heavy_rain_and_snow_takes_power_fro.php">Winter Storm Athena</a> to get there.</p>

<p>The storm&apos;s arrival came as no surprise: Coach Hans Backe had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111711/http://www.nypost.com/p/blogs/soccerblog/tomorrow_backe_says_playoff_tilt_3yK1E0gqoYpw1NnWhHPdTL">expressed concern on Tuesday</a> that the game might have to be postponed. Despite all common logic, all signs were go for the game to proceed, even as local governments were instructing people to stay off the roads.  But after fans had arrived and an hour of futility trying to keep the field clear, MLS SVP of Competition Nelson Rodriguez announced the postponement and spoke to the media:</p>

<blockquote>The original forecast for the nor&#x2019;easter was really heavy winds and some rain. We were very mindful of what the impact of this nor&#x2019;easter could be. We were also very mindful of the trauma that has been experienced by the region from Hurricane Sandy. In the end, we felt that making an attempt to play today gave us the best chance to get this game in. Normally, had it not been for the events of last week and the devastation caused by Hurricane Sandy there wouldn&#x2019;t have been a consideration to move the game in advance. We did consider that. We considered an earlier start time, we considered postponing to tomorrow, yesterday. We even had discussions as early as this morning. But we felt that the forecast was one that gave us a window and an opportunity to play the game, to play it safely and to cause the least disruption to the overall playoff schedule. Unfortunately, nature has a funny way of playing tricks on people and we just couldn&#x2019;t keep up with it.</blockquote>

<p>DCist&apos;s Pablo Maurer was at the arena and easily <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111711/http://dcist.com/2012/11/snowblown_united_match_postponed_ti.php">drove home the issue</a> with the cancellation from the DC perspective:</p>

<blockquote>Maybe calling the game was the right decision given the conditions. The timing, though, was the problem. The hundreds of United fans that made the trek north were left with the prospect of coming home and trying to make time&#x2014;and the excuses&#x2014;to leave work early and make the trip a second time. Had the decision been made earlier in the day&#x2014;or week&#x2014;then maybe those fans&apos; travails could have been spared.</blockquote>

<p>NY fans were perhaps more inconvenienced. Between the storm, gas shortages, and continuing power outages, getting to Harrison was a fool&apos;s errand.  Feeling slighted, fans from both sides took to Twitter to complain directly to the league:</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111711/http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/more-sports/bondy-red-bulls-fans-snowed-article-1.1198543#ixzz2BeC4xBlZ">Daily News&apos; Filip Bondy wrote</a>, &quot;If it weren&#x2019;t for the NHL lockout, then MLS would have been the dumbest sports league in America on Wednesday.&quot;</p>

<p>The stakes for Thursday&apos;s game are now even higher, as two other playoff series ended and saw <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111711/http://www.mlssoccer.com/news/article/2012/11/08/kick-galaxy-houston-oust-top-seeds-mls-playoffs">both of the top conference seeds</a> get knocked off.  With DC and NY as the next two highest seeds left in the playoffs, should either team advance past Houston in the Conference Final, they would host the MLS Cup match on December 1st.</p>

<p>One New York fan summed up everything that&apos;s riding on tonight:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>Playing for pride, CCL berth, the right to host MLS Cup, &amp; Sandy victims, against a rival.

<p>As the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111711/http://vikingarmy.com/">Viking Army</a> says - victory or valhalla.  The gut check begins at 7:30 PM - the game will (again) be broadcast on NBC Sports Network.</p>
