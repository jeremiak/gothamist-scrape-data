(New York Red Bulls)</i> </div><p></p>

<p>If there was going to be a hero in Sunday night&apos;s grudge match between <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111950/http://gothamist.com/tags/redbulls">New York Red Bulls</a> and DC United, few expected it to be Brandon Barklage.  Cut by DC after three seasons, the 26 year old defender wrote his name into the history of the rivalry with a two goal performance, leading the Red Bulls to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111950/http://www.mlssoccer.com/matchcenter/2012-06-24-ny-v-dc/recap">a 3-2 victory</a> in front of an electric sold out crowd in Harrison.</p>

<p>DC managed to get on the scoreboard before many fans had made it into their seats.  On the first attack of the game, Danny Cruz found Chris Pontius who headed in a goal just 28 seconds into the match, a record for the DC franchise.  RBNY came charging back, coming close on many chances.  Joel Lindpere&apos;s corner in the 20th minute was met by an onrushing Barklage, who burned past Dwayne DeRosario and smashed the ball with a kung-fu kick past goalkeeper Bill Hamid.</p>

<p>For much of the first half, the Red Bulls dominated the game; DCist&apos;s Pablo Maurer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111950/http://twitter.com/#!/DCist_Pablo/status/217046737557262338">asked on Twitter</a> &quot;Hey - it&apos;s been lonely down here at Meara&apos;s end. Did #DCU show up tonight?&quot;  The scoreline remained level until just before the halftime whistle, when Barklage notched his second of the match.  Recovering a deflected free kick, he struck a sensational volley from the top of the penalty area, rocketing to the far post and in.</p>

<p>The second half saw Jan Gunnar Solli finally score his first MLS goal, pouncing on a rebound that Hamid could not get under control.  The 3-1 lead seemed insurmountable, but Chris Pontius again played spoiler, scoring a 1-on-1 goal in the 66th minute to bring DC back to a one goal margin.  DC was resurgent in the second half, as the fatigue of NY&apos;s two game road trip had set in, but the Red Bulls held on to notch the win and snap DC&apos;s four-game win streak.</p>

<p>The Red Bulls are now 9-4-3 and tied with DC for top of the Eastern Conference (behind on goal differential, but with a game in hand).  New York will next head to Canada for their first match of the season against beleaguered Toronto FC.  Toronto famously started the season with a nine game losing streak, but with their fortunes recently changing, the Red Bulls will have to avoid what could easily become a trap game.</p>

<p><strong>POST-MATCH REACTIONS</strong></p>

<p>Coach Hans Backe: &quot;I would say the first 55 minutes is probably the most complete we have ever played.  Absolutely phenomenal in the first half...when Barklage and Solli scores, you have to win.  Brandon has been phenomenal in the beginning.  It looked like a couple of weeks ago, he was going to have a dip or something like that.  He had a rough game against Chicago, bounced back against Vancouver, and played even in defense very good today.&quot;</p>

<p>Brandon Barklage on playing his old team: &quot;This is the date I had definitely circled on the calendar...it took four years [to get the first career goal], but it feels unbelievable. To do it against a team that told me at the end of the year last year that I couldn&apos;t cut it there, it feels unbelievable...I&apos;m just so thankful I&apos;m here and getting opportunities.&quot;</p>

<p>Thierry Henry, on Brandon Barklage: &quot;What an example.  The guy at the beginning wasn&apos;t a starter, but I can tell you he was in training working hard.  Like I always say, when you work hard you get what you deserve, so I was happy for him, especially because he used to play for them before.&quot;</p>

<p>Thierry Henry on the atmosphere: &quot;I&apos;m going to have to mention the fans tonight.  They were outstanding.  Sometimes we&apos;re sad when they don&apos;t come, you know, but tonight we needed that.  Especially at the end, they tried to get us that extra push, to make sure we could keep the win.  They were outstanding.&quot;</p>

<p>Ryan Meara, on the development of the younger players: &quot;It&apos;s funny, [Connor Lade and Brandon Barklage] are probably two of my closer friends on the team.  We&apos;re some of the youngest guys coming through...I&apos;m enjoying it, I think we&apos;re all enjoying it, especially we&apos;re in first place.  I think those two guys have done great, and they&apos;re going to be big players for the rest of the season.&quot;</p>

<p>Dax McCarty on the atmosphere: &quot;The atmosphere tonight was the best I&apos;ve ever been involved in in the league.  Better than Seattle, better than Portland.  Tonight was great - the fans were amazing, you could hear them all game long.&quot;</p>

<p>Dax McCarty on not getting nominated for the MLS All-Star Game: &quot;Obviously, these are things that are just extra accolades on the side, so what matters to me most is that we&apos;re winning and the team is doing well.  But I&apos;d be lying to you if I said it didn&apos;t sting a little bit...this is my seventh year in the league, I&apos;m getting older now, starting to get in my late twenties.  You always want to be recognized for your play.  I&apos;ve not an individual player, never have been, never will be.  If that stuff comes along, great, I&apos;ll be happy, but...yeah, I was a little surprised.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111950/http://dcist.com/2012/06/bulldozed_dc_united_drop_crucial_ma.php#photo-1">Pablo Maurer, DCist</a>: &quot;God, I hate losing to New York. I really do. I can&apos;t find a flowery, eloquent way to say it: losing to the Red Bulls just sucks. This loss in particular, in front of 25,187 fans at a sold-out Red Bull Arena, really left a bitter taste in my mouth. I don&apos;t know&#x2014;maybe it was just the complimentary Red Bull.&quot;</p>

<p><em>Next game: Saturday June 30, 7PM ET, At Toronto (TV: Galavision, MSG)</em></p>
