<p>Coming off last Saturday&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428112237/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/25/rbny_downs_portland_without_rafa_ma.php">disappointing 1-1 draw in Toronto</a>, the New York Red Bulls hosted the league-leading LA Galaxy in a match postponed by Hurricane Irene.  With the competition for playoff spots building, New York would need a full three points to pull themselves to higher ground.</p>

<p>LA lacked both USMNT star Landon Donovan (injured) and Irish striker Robbie Keane  (international call-ups).  After much back and forth from both teams to start the game, Luke Rodgers broke the deadlock just over half an hour in by knocking in a loose ball on a corner kick.  Thierry Henry floated in an insurance goal over LA keeper Donovan Ricketts at the hour mark, and nearly doubled late in the game but sent a one-on-one shot off the post.  Goalkeeper Frank Rost made three saves for his fourth clean sheet since joining the team in July.</p>

<p>The win moves the Red Bulls into 4th place in the East and up into the third wildcard spot.  The final two games of the season will see New York battle Kansas City (currently 1st in the East) away and heated rivals Philadelphia (currently 2nd in the East) at home.  Wins over both could catapult New York to finish as conference leaders for a second straight year, while losses could quickly end the team&apos;s dream of their first MLS Cup.</p>
