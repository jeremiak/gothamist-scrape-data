Now, after just half a season in NASL, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111302/http://gothamist.com/tags/nycosmos">New York Cosmos</a> have been named champions once more.  The Cosmos earned their sixth NASL Soccer Bowl title Saturday night, defeating the Atlanta Silverbacks 1-0.</p>

<p>The only goal of the night came from (who else?) Marcos Senna, who looped a gorgeous chip in from the top of the box near the start of the second half.  Atlanta would press hard in search of an equalizing goal, but NASL Golden Glove winner Kyle Rennish would do well to preserve the clean sheet.</p>

<p>Here&apos;s video of the goal, courtesy Soccer LI Magazine:</p>

<p>And here&apos;s the team celebrating with fans following the final whistle-we particularly like the guy in the Jack Wilshire Arsenal jersey! </p>

<p>&quot;It&apos;s an exciting day for sure,&quot; reflected coach Giovanni Savarese after the match. &quot;The New York Cosmos are back, we worked very hard this season to play in the NASL. We had to come in in the second part, the fall season, so we didn&apos;t have that much time to work. We are very proud, very proud of the players, because they accomplished great things.  Week in, week out they were able to do very well, and tonight to bring a championship back to New York, something that hasn&apos;t happened since 1982 is a proud moment for us.&quot;</p>

<p>The Cosmos will take their victory lap this coming week. Savarese&apos;s squad will now travel to Spain for a tribute match for Marcos Senna on Wednesday against Villarreal CF.  The 37-year-old Spanish international spent 11 seasons with &quot;El Submarino Amarillo&quot; and leads the club in all-time appearances.</p>

<p>The Cosmos will return to NASL play the weekend of April 5th, when the 10-game 2014 Spring Championship gets underway.</p>
