<p>The wheels are starting to turn for a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111403/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/13/bronx_bp_diaz_lobbies_for_nyc_fc_st.php">potential home in the Bronx</a> for the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111403/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/21/major_league_soccer_makes_it_offici.php">newest MLS team, NYC FC</a>.  Both the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111403/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/30/nyregion/soccer-clubs-latest-stadium-proposal-would-give-the-yankees-a-new-neighbor.html?smid=tw-share&amp;_r=0">New York Times</a> and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111403/http://on.wsj.com/170klFf">Wall Street Journal</a> are reporting that the team is in early discussions regarding a lot just south of Yankee Stadium.</p>

<p>The identified space, located between the Major Deegan and East 153rd Street, currently houses an underperforming parking garage and a 100,000 square foot factory.  The garage is one of five lots in the area owned by the Bronx Parking Development Company.  The cash strapped non-profit (created in 2007 as part of the new Yankee Stadium deal) defaulted on a $237M tax-exempt bond last year and has been working with bankruptcy attourneys; with this particular garage not even half full on Yankee game days, alternative uses for the land would help correct their fortunes.</p>

<p>The factory may prove a little trickier, as it houses GAL Manufacturing, an elevator parts company that employs 225.  Per the Times, an unnamed source indicated the soccer club has offered to build the company a new factory elsewhere in the Bronx.</p>

<p>The total size of the lot is reportedly nine acres with a proposed stadium capacity of 25,000-30,000.  (For comparison, Red Bull Arena is located on 12.34 acres and houses 25,000.)  Yankee&apos;s President Randy Levine said the site is one of two being looked at in the Bronx, and one of four or five city-wide sites being considered, but cautioned &#x201C;It&#x2019;s all at this point very preliminary.&#x201D;</p>
