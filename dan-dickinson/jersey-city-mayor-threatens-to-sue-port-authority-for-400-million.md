(Facebook)</i></div> Oh Port Authority, can you do anything right? You <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111257/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/08/port_authority_sold_rights_to_world.php">lowball rights to the World Trade Center</a>, the decade-old AirTrain <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111257/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/06/airtrain_service_will_start_getting.php">needed extensive repairs</a>, and the PATH has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111257/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/08/what_to_do_when_the_escaltor_goes_t.php">psychotic escalators</a>.  And now, newly elected Jersey City mayor Steven Fulop announced plans to sue you (<a herf="http://www.cityofjerseycity.com/uploadedFiles/Public_Notices/Press_Releases/Port%20Authority%20Press%20Release.pdf">PDF</a>) for $400 million in &quot;missed tax payments &amp; undue economic harm&quot;!<p></p>

<p>Fulop&apos;s beef relates to tax alternatives agreed to when the Port Authority acquired land in Jersey City, known as PILOT agreements.  With the rates paid set in the distant past-some as far back as 1967&#x2014;Jersey City is arguing that the $2.1 million in annual PILOT payments they receive every year pales in comparison to the $13.4 million they could be receiving under a more current tax assessment.  Stretch this out over nearly fifty years, add in 24 more plots that don&apos;t have PILOT agreements at all, and you&apos;ve got quite the bill.</p>

<p>&quot;This legal action is the result of economic damages caused by the Port Authority&apos;s unfair and outdated tax agreements with the City that has resulted in the loss of hundreds of millions of tax dollars over several decades,&quot; Fulop said in a press release. &quot;The Port Authority has repeatedly failed to fulfill their legal obligations which has caused a severe negative impact on the Jersey City taxpayers.&quot;<br>
 <br>
Fulop isn&apos;t only taking the Port Authority to task over the tax payments, but also their complete unresponsiveness when he tried to reach out about the issue.  Prepare yourself for a POWERPOINT BURN:</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="fullop-communicationburn.png" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111257im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/Dan Dickinson/fullop-communicationburn.png" width="640" height="454" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>Fulop explained: &quot;Since taking office, I have reached out to officials at the Port Authority both formally and informally numerous times which has been documented, yet they have failed to respond. As they have been completely unresponsive, we have no other option but to act on the behalf of our residents.&quot;  (You can grab the whole presentation <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111257/http://www.cityofjerseycity.com/uploadedFiles/Homepage/Port%20Authority%20Discussion%20Document%20vF(1).pdf">from the Jersey City website</a>.)</p>

<p>Who will defend the poor, obviously innocent Port Authority? None other than Republican state senator Michael Doherty, who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111257/http://www.politickernj.com/69521/doherty-jersey-city-threatening-port-authority-suit-over-pilots-hypocrisy">called the suit hypocritical</a> because of Jersey City&apos;s tax abatements and the city not conducting a property tax reevaluation since 1988. &quot;The hypocrisy is off the charts,&#x2019;&#x2019; Doherty told PolitickerNJ.  &#x201C;It sticks it to the county taxpayers because it&#x2019;s off the books. It sticks it to the local school districts because they can&#x2019;t collect taxes on those properties.  It&#x2019;s an incredible double standard. That&#x2019;s $120 million they could be collecting every year.&#x2019;&#x2019;</p>

<p>Fulop took to Twitter this morning to strike back, calling Doherty an &quot;republican extremist&quot; and even busting out a #teaparty hashtag!</p>
