<p>For the first time in history, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428112148/http://www.ussoccer.com/Teams/US-Men.aspx">US Men&apos;s National Team</a> (ranked #31) defeated Italy (ranked #8), in a friendly played this afternoon in Genoa.</p>

<p>Clint Dempsey, who has been in top class form at Fulham FC since the turn of the year, notched the only goal of the match in the 55th minute.  Collecting a ball from Joze Altidore, Dempsey managed to find the bottom left corner of the net through traffic from the top of the box.  Goalkeeper Tim Howard made seven saves to keep the Azzurri at bay.</p>

<p>USMNT midfielder Landon Donovan withdrew from the match earlier this week due to bronchitis. Manchester City striker (and man of legend) Mario Balotelli was not selected for the Italian side, possibly as part of coach Cesare Prandelli <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428112148/http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/sns-rt-uk-soccer-friendly-italytre81q1fn-20120227,0,2337430.story">sending a message</a> about his behavior as of late.</p>
