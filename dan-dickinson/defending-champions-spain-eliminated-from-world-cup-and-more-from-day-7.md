<p>One week into the month-long tournament, Wednesday brought the first eliminations of the 2014 World Cup: Australia, Cameroon, and 2010 champions Spain.</p>

<p><em>Last Night&apos;s Action</em></p>

<p><strong>Australia 2, Netherlands 3</strong> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428110954/http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/videos/highlights/match=300186478/index.html">HIGHLIGHTS</a>) It wasn&apos;t as easy as their romp over Spain, but the Oranje prevailed in a back and forth match over the feisty Socceroos. Arjen Robben would open the scoring, but Tim Cahill scored a fantastic volley a minute later to level the game. The Australians would gain the lead briefly on a dubious handball penalty, but Robin Van Persie again equalized moments later. Australia had a great attack broken up and then was crushed on a counter-attack. Memphis Depay bounced a long range shot past Matthew Ryan to send the Dutch to the Round of 16 and end Australia&apos;s World Cup campaign.</p>

<p><strong>Spain 0, Chile 2</strong> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428110954/http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/videos/highlights/match=300186498/index.html">HIGHLIGHTS</a>) It may be the end of an era for the defending champions, as their dreams of a repeat end after just two games. Eduardo Vargas put in the game-winner after just 20 minutes, while Charles Aranguiz knocked home the insurance goal just before the half-time whistle. Spain&apos;s best chance came just into the second half as Sergio Busquets had a clear shot just yards from the goal mouth which he could only put wide. Spain becomes just the fifth defending champion to fail during the group stage, and third of the last four, while Chile advance to the Round of 16 for the second straight tournament.</p>

<p><strong>Cameroon 0, Croatia 4</strong> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428110954/http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/videos/highlights/match=300186453/index.html">HIGHLIGHTS</a>) The same Cameroon side <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428110954/http://af.reuters.com/article/cameroonNews/idAFL5N0OU3SB20140613">who refused to leave for the tournament</a> were destroyed by a four goal Croatian masterclass. Mario Mandzukic contributed two goals. Cameroon&apos;s most notable moment was either Alex Song earning a idiotic straight red for punching Mandzukic in the back, or Benoit Assou-Ekotto headbutting his own teammate late in the match. The loss eliminates Cameroon, but Croatia will almost certainly need a win over Mexico in their final group match to advance.</p>

<p><em>The Play To Watch</em></p>

<p>Tim Cahill&apos;s one-time volley is an easy pick for the goal of the day:</p>

<p>And Alex Song gets no points for subtlety in picking up his red card:</p>

<p><em>Today&apos;s Matches</em></p>

<p><strong>Colombia vs. Ivory Coast</strong> (12PM ET, ESPN) Both of the winners from Group C face off, and should either get a win they&apos;ll advance out of the group stage. Colombia looked great over a lackluster Greece, while Ivory Coast battled back to topple Japan. Ivory Coast will be missing striker Didier Ya Konan, so Didier Drogba could start for <em>Les Elephants</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Uruguay vs. England</strong> (3PM ET, ESPN) The desperation factor in this one could be high, as both teams will need some points to keep hope alive in their group. Wayne Rooney may get to play in his usual position, while Uruguay will be hoping that their star striker Luis Suarez can return to fitness and make the starting XI. Uruguayan captain Diego Lugano was ruled out of the match with a knee injury.</p>

<p><strong>Japan vs. Greece</strong> (6PM ET, ESPN) Another potential elimination scenario, as Group C&apos;s opening match losers battle in the late match. Greece opted to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428110954/http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jun/15/fernando-santos-konstantinos-katsouranis-greece-colombia">start pointing at fingers at each other</a> after losing to Colombia, while Japan seemed better at taking the loss as a team. Bouncing back is critical: should Colombia and Ivory Coast draw, the loser here would be eliminated.</p>

<p><em>What Else Is Going On?</em></p>

<p>Cristiano Ronaldo may keep saying he&apos;s fully fit, but he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428110954/http://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/27914694">limped out of training</a> again on Wednesday. Portugal play the USA on Sunday.</p>

<p>The Maracan&#xE3;, which hosted the Chile/Spain match, saw <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428110954/http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jun/18/world-cup-2014-chile-fans-maracana-spain">100 supporters break through security</a> and damage the stadium&apos;s media center.</p>

<p>Uruguay&apos;s goalkeeper thought he had ants in his bed. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428110954/http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/soccer-dirty-tackle/termites-found-in-uruguay-goalkeeper-s-bed--police-suspect-foul-play-144722200.html">Turns out they&apos;re termites</a>. Policy believe it may be foul play.</p>

<p>Ghana wants you to know everything is fine and there&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428110954/http://soccer.si.com/soccer/planet-futbol/2014/06/18/ghana-fa-denies-player-revolt-world-cup">no player revolt</a> in their camp.</p>
