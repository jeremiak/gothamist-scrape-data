<p>The biggest lingering question after the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111508/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/21/major_league_soccer_makes_it_offici.php">NYC FC announcement</a> was where the team would make their home.  After a solid year of handwringing and community uproar about the Flushing Meadows Corona Park stadium plan, the league seemed to indicate that it was willing to consider other options.  Now Bronx Borough President Ruben Diaz Jr. has stepped up, issuing a letter to MLS commissioner Don Garber urging the league to consider his borough instead.</p>

<p>Diaz expressed his desire to &quot;cement the new reputation of the Bronx as a sports mecca&quot;, and cited the recent Spain/Ireland friendly at Yankee stadium as drawing fans from all over the area.  He also didn&apos;t hesitate to put the boots to the reaction to the Queens plan, bluntly stating &quot;<strong>It would appear that there is little enthusiasm for world class soccer in Queens.</strong>&quot;  Ooh, borough fight!  (Here&apos;s a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111508/http://bronxboropres.nyc.gov/pdf/2013-06-13-letter-mls.pdf">PDF of the letter</a>.)</p>

<p>With the offer to assist in the stadium planning now extended to Major League Soccer, we&apos;ll have to wait and see if this finally kills the &quot;MLS to Queens&quot; movement.  We reached out to the league for comment and will update if we get one.</p>

<p><strong>RED BULLS BLOWN OUT OF US OPEN CUP</strong></p>

<p>For the third year in a row, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111508/http://gothamist.com/tags/redbulls">New York Red Bulls</a> lost their second game in the US Open Cup, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111508/http://www.newyorkredbulls.com/news/2013/06/red-bulls-eliminated-us-open-cup-falling-4-2-new-england">falling 4-2 to the New England Revolution</a> in Boston.</p>

<p>The Red Bulls never held the lead, falling behind just after four minutes on a Kelyn Rowe goal that by all accounts should have been saved by Ryan Meara.  New York would pull the game level fifteen minutes before halftime as Fabian Espindola pounced on a poor back pass, but went into the locker room down 2-1 after Rowe found his second.  Goals were traded early in the second half with Jonny Steele scoring for NY, and it looked like the Red Bulls might have been able to force the game to overtime - but a dagger goal from Chris Tierney put the margin at two goals just minutes before full time.</p>

<p>Coach Mike Petke was blunt about his feelings on the team&apos;s performance: <strong>&quot;We lost to a mediocre team because we were way less than mediocre.&quot;</strong></p>

<p>The Red Bulls return to league play June 23rd at Philadelphia.</p>

<p><strong>COSMOS SIGN SENNA AND KASHIWASE, LAND TV DEAL</strong></p>
