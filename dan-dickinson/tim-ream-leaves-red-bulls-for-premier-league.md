(Gothamist)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>After weeks of speculation, negotiation, and work visa appeals, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428112202/http://gothamist.com/tags/redbulls">New York Red Bulls</a> have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428112202/http://www.newyorkredbulls.com/news/2012/01/new-york-mls-agree-transfer-fee-bolton-wanderers-fc-defender-tim-ream">agreed to terms</a> to send defender Tim Ream to Premier League side Bolton Wanderers F.C.</p>

<p>In a statement released by the team, Sporting Director and GM Erik Soler discussed the deal: &quot;We are extremely happy for Tim. He has worked very hard since he joined Major League Soccer and became a Red Bull and we firmly believe that this opportunity will be beneficial to him and the Red Bulls.&quot;  Tim Ream added, &quot;This was a hard decision for me considering the fact that I enjoyed playing for the Red Bulls and was looking forward to the upcoming MLS season. However, after consulting with those closest to me, I decided that this was a once in a lifetime chance that I could not pass up.&quot;  Wanderers boss Owen Coyle told the team&apos;s news site, &quot;Tim is everything that we want in the players we are bringing to the club when we spend in the transfer market. He is young, has a tremendous attitude and a winning mentality.&quot;</p>

<p>While terms of the three and a half year deal were not discussed, rumors put the transfer fee in the neighborhood of $3M, which would be the largest in the history of Major League Soccer for a defender.  Under league rules, the Red Bulls would receive approximately  $2M of the transfer fee.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428112202/http://www.nypost.com/p/blogs/soccerblog/red_bulls_explore_residence_academy_CXCOtYR9x1F4Sza1KCUMaI">Speaking to the NY Post&apos;s Brian Lewis</a>, Soler indicated that the team may be interested in pouring some of that money into a European-style residence academy.</p>

<p>Ream joined the Red Bulls in 2010 as their second round draft pick, playing every minute of every game that season and was named a finalist for the league&apos;s Rookie Of The Year.  His 2011 season ran both hot (like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428112202/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NebkoD3GFw">his unforgettable goal-line clearance</a> against LA) and cold (his gifting of a goal to the Philadelphia Union).  Ream joins a legendary list of former NY players who have gone on to Europe, including current USMNT keeper Tim Howard, striker Joze Altidore, and midfielder Michael Bradley.</p>
