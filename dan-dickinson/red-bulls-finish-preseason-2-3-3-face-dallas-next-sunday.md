<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428112144/http://gothamist.com/tags/redbulls">New York Red Bulls</a> may finally be finding their rhythm, even if the results are eluding them.  The team wrapped up their pre-season in Arizona this week by beating the LA Galaxy 2-1 on Tuesday, then falling again to Real Salt Lake 1-0 in the consolation match.</p>

<p>RBNY was missing a handful of key players for the match Wednesday against Los Angeles due to international call ups, but the team showed signs of cohesion as they largely bossed around the 2011 champions.  Kenny Cooper scored his third goal of the preseason after Conner Lade found him at the top of the box and LA gave him plenty of space to rifle a shot into the lower corner.  Thierry Henry doubled the lead on a beautiful one-two combination with Dane Richards.  New York&apos;s woes on set pieces continued as LA&apos;s Marcelo Sarvas knocked in a consolation goal off a late free kick.  The 2-1 result sent LA to the Desert Diamond Cup final on goal differential, leaving New York to play Real Salt Lake once more.</p>

<p>Saturday&apos;s 1-0 loss to RSL was a story of missed opportunities for the Red Bulls, who saw plenty of chances go to waste at the hands of goalkeeper Nick Rimando.  Defender Chris Wingert notched Salt Lake&apos;s only goal midway through the first half.  New York&apos;s best chances to tie both came from the feet of Roy Miller, who went just wide of the goal twice in the dying minutes.</p>

<p>The Red Bulls end their preseason 2-3-3, and somewhat worse for the wear as two players picked up injuries during the LA tilt.  Wilman Conde was taken off the field after 20 minutes with a strained thigh, and is expected to miss the next two to three weeks.  Goalkeeper Ryan Meara suffered a broken nose, although the injury is not expected to prevent him from being ready for the regular season next Sunday at Dallas.</p>

<p>Beyond final preparations for the season, the Red Bulls are expected to make a decision on a number of trialists and guest players who have been with the team during the preseason.  One who appears to already have a deal in place is defender Tyler Ruthven, who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428112144/https://twitter.com/#!/Truthven/status/175791563400679427">tweeted on Friday</a> &quot;Let&apos;s make it official. Just put pen to paper with the New York Red Bulls. Happy to be here!&quot;  The Red Bulls officially only have 21 out of a possible 30 roster spots filled.  Lastly, the fate of Luke Rodgers season will be determined this week, as a visa hearing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428112144/http://www.mlssoccer.com/news/article/2012/03/01/decision-rodgers-visa-issue-come-next-week">will be held on March 8th</a>.</p>

<p><em>Next Match: Away at FC Dallas, 3/11 3PM ET (NBC Sports Network)</em></p>
