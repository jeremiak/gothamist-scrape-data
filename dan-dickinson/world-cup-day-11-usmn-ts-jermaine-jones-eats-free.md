<p>Sunday&apos;s World Cup action brought us a snoozer from Belgium, a flood of Algerian goals, another match fixing scandal, and free food for life at Momofuku.</p>

<p><em>Last Night&apos;s Action</em></p>

<p><strong>Belgium 1, Russia 0</strong> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429163940/http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/videos/highlights/match=300186481/index.html">HIGHLIGHTS</a>) A largely forgettable match, where the deadlock was only broken in the closing minutes thanks to 19-year-old Divock Origi. Origi turned in a nice ball from Eden Hazard to send Belgium through to the Round of 16.</p>

<p><strong>South Korea 2, Algeria 4</strong> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429163940/http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/videos/highlights/match=300186495/index.html">HIGHLIGHTS</a>) A proper thrashing by Algeria saw them put the game out of reach before South Korea could even get a shot on target. Islam Slimani opened the scoring by shrugging off two defenders to chip a long ball past goalkeeper Jung Sung-Ryong. Goals from Rafik Halliche and Abdelmoumene Djabou would make it 3-0 going into half time. South Korea showed signs of life when Heung-Min Son put South Korea on the score sheet with a shot right through the legs of Algeria&apos;s Rais M&apos;Bolhi, but an insurance goal from Yacine Brahimi squelched those hopes quickly. </p>

<p><strong>USA 2, Portugal 2</strong> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429163940/http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/videos/highlights/match=300186483/index.html">HIGHLIGHTS</a>) Mixed feelings about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429163940/http://gothamist.com/2014/06/22/world_cup_usa_and_portugal_battle_t.php">this one</a> the morning after. Yes, the game slipped away in the final thirty seconds because of a bad Michael Bradley giveaway. Yes, Geoff Cameron was at fault on both goals. But had you offered four points from two games before the tournament started, most would&apos;ve been fine with that. Charles Boehm will be back with reactions from camp later today.</p>

<p><em>The Play To Watch</em></p>

<p>Just because we enjoy a good nutmeg, here&apos;s Heung-Min Son taking advantage of some wide legs from Algeria&apos;s goalkeeper:</p>

<p>Tim Howard had an excellent game for the US, including this reaction palm save:</p>

<p>And because it was the most spectacular goal on the day, here&apos;s Jermaine Jones again:</p>

<p><em>Today&apos;s Matches</em></p>

<p><strong>Netherlands vs. Chile</strong> (12PM ET, ESPN) <br>
<strong>Australia vs. Spain</strong> (12PM ET, ESPN2) </p>

<p>Group B gets the honor of finishing their group play first, with almost nothing at stake. Netherlands and Chile have already advanced, but both will want to top the group to avoid a likely face off with Brazil in the Round of 16. In the other match, Australia and Spain have both already been eliminated, so both sides are only playing for pride rather than any chance of continuing onward.</p>

<p><strong>Croatia vs. Mexico</strong> (4PM ET, ESPN) <br>
<strong>Cameroon vs. Brazil</strong> (4PM ET, ESPN2)</p>

<p>Croatia and Mexico will be the one to watch, with both sides trying to send the other home. Brazil are virtually guaranteed passage to the Round of 16, unless Cameroon manages to shock the hosts and Mexico-Croatia goes to a draw. Those are long odds given how wretched Cameroon have looked, but stranger things have happened this tournament.</p>

<p><em>What Else Is Going On?</em></p>
