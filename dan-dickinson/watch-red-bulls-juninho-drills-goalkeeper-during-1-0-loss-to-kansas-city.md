<p>For the second straight year, Sporting Kansas City handed the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111558/http://gothamist.com/tags/redbulls">New York Red Bulls</a> their first home loss of the season.  A 13th minute goal from Aurelien Collin was all that would separate the sides in a frustrating match that saw New York&apos;s frustrations boil over into a straight red card for Brazilian midfielder Juninho.</p>

<p><strong>FULL HIGHLIGHTS</strong></p>

<p><strong>THE GOOD</strong></p>

<p><em>Roy Miller.</em>  It&apos;s barely been a month since <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111558/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/11/red_bulls_nearly_win_at_san_jose_bu.php">&quot;Miller Time&quot; became a thing</a>, but the Costa Rican defender quietly snuck back into the lineup last weekend in DC. Whatever steps he took to clear his head seem to have worked&#x2014;he did strong work on the flank, getting the ball forward and overlapping well with Tim Cahill.  A blown cross or two shouldn&apos;t negate an overall strong performance&#x2014;but maybe it&apos;s time to start him as a midfielder rather than a defender?</p>

<p><em>Aurelien Collin</em> The Sporting Kansas City defender showed why he&apos;s so highly regarded in the league&#x2014;not only for shutting down Henry and the rest of the RBNY attack time and time again, but for scoring the game winner early on a Graham Zusi corner kick.</p>

<p><strong>THE BAD</strong></p>

<p><em>A lack of consistency and cohesion from Mike Petke&apos;s side.</em> It&apos;s still difficult to predict exactly what you&apos;re going to see on the pitch. The team&apos;s formation is fluid almost to a fault, but most attacks devolve to &quot;get Henry the ball and hope he scores&quot;. The off-the-ball movement and midfield control was great in DC but non-existent versus SKC. After an off-season that blew up the roster, we knew this team needed time to gel, but with a quarter of the season gone, there&apos;s no real sign that this team has figured itself out, let alone any opponent.</p>

<p><em>Jamison Olave getting injured.</em>  It was bad enough when the defender got burned on the only goal of the game&#x2014;but when he pulled up hurt, the Red Bulls were forced to play down a man for at least five minutes while medical checked on him and prepared an unexpected sub.  Hopefully the knock won&apos;t be too serious, as a quick turnaround has the team playing again on Saturday.</p>

<p><strong>THE UGLY</strong></p>

<p><em>Juninho getting sent off.</em>  Are you Rafa Marquez in disguise?  Late in the game, Sporting Kansas City&#x2014;knowing that they are facing LA away on Saturday and wanting to kill off the game&#x2014;were eating time off the clock anywhere they can.  With referee Allen Chapman not doing much to ask SKC to speed it along, the Brazilian midfielder took matters into his own hands, drilling goalkeeper Jimmy Nielsen with a shot from close range after the play was dead.</p>

<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111558if_/http://www.youtube.com/embed/fF-oOxP0Aas?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>Of course, if you&apos;re going to take a shot at someone who was already time wasting, it&apos;s no surprise that Nielsen opted to milk it for all it was worth.  It wouldn&apos;t make a difference in the result, but the incident epitomized a frustrating night.</p>

<p><strong>LOOKING AHEAD</strong></p>

<p>The New England Revolution come to town.  While the Revs have been pretty lackluster to start the year&#x2014;one goal in five games&#x2014;it&apos;s hard not to expect them to want to come out and make a statement after the tragedy in Boston this week. NY gets all of three days to recover and prepare, and some lineup rotation will likely be necessary to get a result at home.</p>

<p><strong>POST-MATCH REACTIONS</strong></p>

<p><strong>Coach Mike Petke on the match:</strong> &quot;That&#x2019;s a good team we played. Kansas City&#x2019;s a very good team, on both ends of the ball. We knew it wasn&#x2019;t going to be an easy game. I wasn&#x2019;t happy with the first half. I thought we were stepping too late to almost every play defensively, and I thought we were trying to do way too much offensively when we were on the ball. Trying to make that perfect pass every time we went, trying to slide it through two players and then it&#x2019;d get picked off and we&#x2019;d be right back on the defensive again. Second half I thought it was a good response. We had some tired guys out there that fought till the end. We had some opportunities to go up. Overall it&#x2019;s an uneasy feeling for me.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Juninho on his red card:</strong> &quot;The communication I have had with the refs has been a little bit difficult because of the language barrier. I feel the refs have been a little bit tougher on the players that have a little bit more name just trying to impose themselves on certain players. I was very frustrated with the goalkeeper who was delaying the game a lot and I tried to rush him a little bit but I also feel that the goalkeeper exaggerated a lot and the ball didn&#x2019;t hit near his face.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Thierry Henry on why Sporting won:</strong> &quot;They&#x2019;re a team. It&#x2019;s as simple as that. You have to give them credit&#x2014;they played really well, came with a game plan and scored on a set piece. We could have done better on that but great header from (Aurelien) Collin. They missed a one against one in the second half that Luis (Robles) actually made a great save. Then I had one, I think that was the only opportunity in the game, but overall, that wasn&#x2019;t enough. I thought today that the best team won.&quot;</p>
