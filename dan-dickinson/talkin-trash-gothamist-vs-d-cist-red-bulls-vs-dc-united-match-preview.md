<p><em>The oldest rivalry in Major League Soccer fires up again this Saturday as the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111630/http://gothamist.com/tags/redbulls">New York Red Bulls</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111630/http://dcist.com/tags/dcunited">DC United</a> face off at Red Bull Arena.  With the battle on the field approaching, we couldn&apos;t resist revisiting the battle of words between myself and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111630/http://dcist.com/">DCist</a> resident soccer reporter Pablo Maurer.  Not just a match preview: find out which one of us slept on a hotel floor in Newark, defended a player from their team headbutting someone, and is terrible at FIFA 13. (Spoilers: it&apos;s Pablo!)</em></p>

<p><strong>Dan Dickinson, Gothamist:</strong> Here we are again, Pabs, staring down the face of the 60th regular season meeting between NY and DC, in what the league has helpfully dubbed &quot;Rivalry Week&quot; (otherwise people might be confused).  It feels like just yesterday I was watching your team flip out about not being able to play in snowstorm that had crippled the area not even a week after Sandy, hearing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111630/http://gothamist.com/2012/11/01/hurricane_sandy_forces_mls_playoff.php">your fans scream about conspiracy theories</a> that they got &quot;screwed&quot; when the game got pushed back all of one day, and watching Bill Hamid flip out so much for being sent off that he called NBC&apos;s Kyle Martino &quot;Kyle Martini&quot; on Twitter.  For the team that won, you DC boys sure were angry about the whole thing. How&apos;s the anger management working out for the Barra Brava?</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="Pablo Maurer, DCist" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111630im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/Dan Dickinson/pablo.png" width="131" height="173" class="image-left"> </span></p>

<p><strong>Pablo Maurer, DCist:</strong> As someone who was once told by a Red Bulls supporter that they &quot;hope RFK crumbles to the ground and crushes all you a**holes,&quot; I&apos;m not so sure La Barra are the guys who need anger management. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111630/http://dcist.com/2012/11/snowblown_united_match_postponed_ti.php">That snowstorm</a> is still fresh on my mind, Daniel. You see, I hadn&apos;t anticipated the cowardice of your home team - I never bothered to make overnight accommodations in Harrison, NJ, as I&apos;d intended to shoot the game and then catch the express train out of Syringe Valley that very same night. But after the Red Bulls refused to take the pitch, I was forced to make other arrangements - I ended up sleeping on the floor of a hotel room in Newark, NJ. I can&apos;t undo that, Dan. To this very day, if someone were to hit me with some luminol and shine a blacklight in my general direction, I&apos;d light up like the sun.</p>

<p>Speaking of that cancellation, things sure changed pretty drastically in Harrison after Nick DeLeon shattered the hopes and dreams of the 5,000 or so fans who bothered to show up the next night. Uncle Hans is long gone, replaced by Mike Petke (who at least had the balls to admit that you guys <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111630/http://www.msg.com/content/msgsite/en/videos.html#video.2338848276">weren&apos;t even mentally ready</a> to win that series) and the axe came down on quite a few guys on the field as well. How are you feeling about your chances 2 games into 2013?</p>

<p><strong>Dickinson:</strong> That floor in Newark probably gave you super powers, my friend.  You probably have super strength that will prevent RFK from crushing you when it does finally collapse.  You&apos;ll be THANKING the Newark Hobo-tel or wherever the hell you &quot;stayed&quot;. </p>

<p>As for the shakeup: it was coming, as it comes every offseason for this club. If DeLeon wants to take credit for costing Backe and Marquez their jobs, he&apos;s automatically my favorite player on DC. As for our chances, I feel as good as anyone can after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111630/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/11/red_bulls_nearly_win_at_san_jose_bu.php">Miller Time in San Jose</a>.  Outside of Precious Roy, I like the squad - the RSL additions have already made their presence felt and that&apos;s a step up over last year. Everything needs more time to &quot;gel&quot; but RBNY comes out big for RBA home openers - ask Chicago, Seattle, and Colorado. How about your first two - thrashed again by Houston and then Pajoy <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111630/http://dcist.com/2013/03/united_vs_real_salt_lake.php#photo-1">with hero and goat honors</a> against RSL. Consistency isn&apos;t your thing either, is it?</p>

<p><strong>Maurer:</strong> Eh, our fans tend to panic, just like yours. I nearly lost the plot last year after opening losses to SKC and LA, but the guys righted the ship eventually. I will say that Thorrington&apos;s knock has me worried, as does our lack of direction up top (though Pajoy is <em>starting</em> to win me over.) I&apos;m truly interested to see how this team performs under some newly heightened expectations - I feel like last years squad played the underdog card a lot, and it fit them well. It&apos;s too early to form any real judgements on this season, but talk to me in a month or so. Hopefully you won&apos;t have to pull me away from the ledge.</p>

<p><strong>Dickinson:</strong> While we&apos;re on rosters: what the hell is going on with yours? Pajoy is the definition of &quot;Philly reject&quot;, and now he&apos;s core to your offense. You sign a youth DP no one had ever heard of.  Your Indonesian owner seemed remarkably happy when the team suddenly took on a loan of an Indonesian player no one had ever heard of. Who are all these guys, and should I be frightened of any of them other than my ongoing fear of Pontius putting three past Robles?</p>

<p><strong>Maurer:</strong> I think you&apos;ve got me beat here. I think United made some quality additions in the offseason - but none of them are known threats. Rafael has a huge upside, should he pan out - he&apos;s young and the club obviously has the option to make a permanent move at the end of his loan. Thorrington was (and will be in 3 months) an upgrade over Saragosa, and James Riley has looked solid enough in the back - save the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111630/http://www.mlssoccer.com/video/2013/03/02/own-goal-riley-heads-past-his-own-keeper">own goal</a> against Houston. But I must concede: New York has addressed almost all of their needs in the off-season. They picked up a set-piece specialist and finally have a coach with some grit and character - though let&apos;s see if he can command respect from players like Juninho and Thierry Henry. Advantage, Bulls.</p>

<p>Speaking of trades, it&apos;s been almost 2 full years since you guys gave up on Dwayne De Rosario for Dax McCarty. Let&apos;s take a moment and talk about how that&apos;s panned out for our respective clubs.</p>

<p><strong>Dickinson:</strong> If we were just looking at 2011, sure, DeRo lit it up, no question.  But since then, Dax McCarty has become the player the Red Bulls sorely needed.  So good in the CDM role, able to help track back to mop up the defense, and venture forward to help build an attack.  Fantastic passer, managed to score a couple last season, and maybe most importantly - guy&apos;s got the right attitude.  He was my MVP last year, and already this year he&apos;s been vital to keep not great results from turning tragic.  Given that Mr. Knee Injury managed to get <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111630/http://www.blackandredunited.com/d-c-united-2013-season/2013/3/1/4043122/dc-united-vs-houston-dynamo-dwayne-de-rosario-suspension-tchub">suspended for two games for headbutting a guy</a> in preseason - possibly the classiest move since he wrote an invisible check in the air to demand a raise from TFC - can you honestly say you won out on this trade?</p>

<p><strong>Maurer:</strong> Is this a joke? I love Dax. Seriously. I was honestly sad to see him go. Great locker room guy, highly quotable, full of good energy - the &#x201C;right attitude&#x201D; for sure. And I&apos;m happy he was &quot;your MVP&quot; last year - but I&apos;ll take DeRo any day of the week. Aside from the obvious &apos;11 MVP and Best XI awards, he had 12 assists and a handful of goals in 2012 - an &quot;off&quot; year for him - despite being injured for much of the campaign. And who cares if the guy headbutted Danny Cruz. Sorry. He partied. It happens. That&apos;s what happens when you care about things in life, right? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111630/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITdPTKpGHuI">You get angry and you headbutt people</a>. I&apos;ve been living my life by the &quot;DeRo code&quot; for years, I guess (sans the vegan diet.)</p>

<p><strong>Dickinson:</strong> Typical DC - &quot;who cares about a headbutt?&quot; if it&apos;s anyone not in a RBNY jersey.  Anyhow, let&apos;s talk predictions.  The last two results say I should be pessimistic - but I felt that way last year, when the team had dropped the first two games on the road as well, and they still came out and thrashed Colorado. Our backline still isn&apos;t settled, but neither is your offense - so put me down for a 4-2 result to New York and at least forty tweets commenting on what Mike Petke is wearing.  Seeing as you&apos;re trailing me by something like 230 goals in the Istaverse FIFA 13 Cup, I&apos;ll let you have the last word.</p>

<p><strong>Maurer:</strong> Well, let&apos;s look at the forecast - mid 30&apos;s, precipitation - are you guys actually gonna play this one? I&apos;m not sure I can handle another evening in Newark, so please: no cancellations.</p>

<p>Assuming the game goes on as planned - I think United pulls out a 2-1 victory. Unless Roy Miller <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111630/http://www.mlssoccer.com/news/article/2013/03/13/new-york-red-bulls-defender-roy-miller-says-pk-encroachment-was-intentional">goes full-on &quot;Precious Roy&quot;</a> again, in which case I think we&apos;re looking at more of a 3 or 4 goal affair for the black and red. I&apos;ll also be shooting photos directly in front of your supporters groups at the south end of Red Bull Arena while the black and red attack that goal - maybe this time I won&apos;t get multiple beers thrown on me! Not holding my breath.</p>
