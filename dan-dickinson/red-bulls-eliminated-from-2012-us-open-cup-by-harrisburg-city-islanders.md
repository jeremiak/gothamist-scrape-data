<p>The New York Red Bulls&apos; dreams of filling their empty trophy case with a US Open Cup will have to wait another year.  Despite giving their all for 120 minutes, New York was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428112002/http://www.newyorkredbulls.com/news/2012/06/red-bulls-fall-extra-time-3-1-harrisburg">eliminated 3-1 in the Fourth Round</a> by the Harrisburg City Islanders, who knocked off their second MLS team in as many weeks.</p>

<p>With ten players missing due to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428112002/http://www.newyorkredbulls.com/news/2012/05/four-red-bulls-called-international-duty">international duty</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428112002/http://www.newyorkredbulls.com/news/2012/06/usoc-henrys-status-unclear-ahead-tuesdays-match">injury</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428112002/http://www.nypost.com/p/blogs/soccerblog/red_bulls_tyler_ruthven_steammed_QpdVYKBVXVemCZd6xwMwLI">suspension</a>, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428112002/http://www.newyorkredbulls.com/news/2012/05/new-york-loans-forward-corey-hertzog-wilmington-hammerheads">loan</a>, Hans Backe named each of the remaining fifteen players to either the field or the bench.  Early play favored the Red Bulls, but a (possibly offside) Harrisburg goal by Sainey Touray threw off the rhythm and left the team struggling to find an attacking flow.</p>

<p>The Red Bulls would regroup in the second half and string together chances, finally finding the back of the net thanks to Connor Lade.  The game proceeded into extra time, and again Sainey Touray proved the villain as he broke free and chipped a goal past Ryan Meara to put the hosts up 2-1.</p>

<p>Controversy with the officials reared its ugly head again in the second period of extra time, as referee Robert Sibiga failed to call deliberate handball by Harriburg&apos;s Jason Pelletier on the goal line.  The potential penalty kick and red card would&apos;ve offered New York a chance to tie the game, but despite endless appeals nothing was given.  Harrisburg would punch their ticket to the quarterfinals minutes later on a goal from Lucky Mkosana, sending nearly 100 traveling RBNY supporters home in disgust.  </p>

<p>The Red Bulls, though smarting over the loss, thanked their fans:</p>
