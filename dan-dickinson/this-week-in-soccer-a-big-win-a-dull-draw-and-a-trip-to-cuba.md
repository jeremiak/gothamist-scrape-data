<p>What did you miss over the last week in soccer? The Red Bulls beat back their rivals and rumors of their demise, NYCFC couldn&apos;t do much in Colorado, and the Cosmos are trying their hand at diplomacy.</p>

<p><strong>RED BULLS 2, DC UNITED 0</strong></p>

<p>Those who had written off the Red Bulls in 2015 got a reality check Sunday, as the club opened at home with a emphatic 2-0 win over their oldest rivals, DC United.</p>

<p>A metaphorical cloud loomed over Red Bull Arena as the team kicked off at home for the first time without beloved head coach Mike Petke. In the South Ward, the Empire Supporters Club spent the first twelve minutes of the match singing pro-Petke chants and displaying a simply stated sign: &quot;LEGENDS DESERVE BETTER&quot;.</p>

<p>That tension was relieved as a familiar goal scorer opened his account for the season. Bradley Wright-Phillips skillfully brought down a long ball in the box from Dax McCarty and fired home to the far post. Perhaps DC&#x2019;s defenders bought into the &#x201C;he&#x2019;ll never score without Henry&#x201D; narrative?</p>

<center><script src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429101649js_/http://player.espn.com/player.js?playerBrandingId=7f85f640d356489798d964a67a833280&amp;adSetCode=5d80a8f4a1f545b0944606ef39cf05e2&amp;pcode=B4a3E63GKeEtO92XK7NI067ak980&amp;width=576&amp;height=324&amp;externalId=intl:2362388&amp;thruParam_espn-ui[autoPlay]=false&amp;thruParam_espn-ui[playRelatedExternally]=true"></script></center>

<p>The passing and attacking movement from Jesse Marsch&#x2019;s side was a bit more fluid than in years past, and a makeshift defensive line (injuries kept Roy Miller and Ronald Zubar out of the lineup) held strong. United didn&apos;t look engaged in the match until the second half, but even then, New York was the better side. A turnover from Davy Arnaud would allow BWP to feed Lloyd Sam on the quick counter, who tallied his second for the insurance goal.</p>

<p>The shutout looked in danger late, with the Red Bulls giving up a penalty in the dying moments. But Chris &quot;Party Boy&quot; Pontius left a smile on many faces when he shanked the spot kick.</p>

<p>&quot;I know that if we get this team right then everyone will follow,&#x201D; reflected coach Jesse Marsch after the match. &quot;I hope that, again, the fans, whether in the stands or at home, are getting a sense for what this team will be and that despite all the talk about this team &apos;having a down year&apos; and &apos;having a rebuilding year&apos; and everything else that this is a pretty good team.&#x201D;</p>

<p>&quot;It&apos;s a bullshit first half from us,&#x201D; fumed DC coach Ben Olsen. &quot;I don&apos;t know what we think we&apos;ve earned or what gives us the right to step on the field in the first half with that type of mentality, but that will change, I know that.&quot;</p>

<p>If Ben Olsen is pissed off, Jesse Marsch must be doing something right. The Red Bulls travel to Columbus next week (Saturday, March 28th, 7:30 PM, MSG2).</p>

<p><strong>COLORADO 0, NYCFC 0</strong></p>

<p>Jason Kreis may have earned plenty of results against the Rapids from his Salt Lake days, but his new squad&apos;s first trip to Commerce City resulted in a dull scoreless draw.</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="2015_03_nycfc3023.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429101649im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2015_03_nycfc3023.jpg" width="640" height="466"> <br> <i> Ned Grabavoy on the ground in pain (NYCFC)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>There&apos;s not much to write home about for this one. Shay Facey earned the club&apos;s first red card, continuing the pattern of someone getting sent off in every NYCFC game to date. Josh Saunders was kept busy, making 7 saves to keep the clean sheet. And David Villa valiantly tried to find a goal, but his most notable moment was this botched free kick:</p>

<p>NYCFC returns home next Saturday to host Sporting Kansas City (7:00 PM, YES).</p>

<p><strong>COSMOS TO CUBA</strong></p>

<p>Early in the week, the Cosmos announced their contribution to diplomacy through sport. Giovanni Savarese&apos;s side will take on the Cuban National Team on June 2nd in Havana.</p>

<p>The match is the latest in a long history of Cosmos playing national teams on foreign soil, and will make them the first professional sports team since the Orioles in 1999 to play on Cuban soil. (We&#x2019;ll ignore that the US Men&#x2019;s National Team played there in 2008 for the sake of the word &#x201C;historic&#x201D;.)</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="2015_03_charliecosmos.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429101649im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2015_03_charliecosmos.jpg" width="640" height="426"> <br> <i> Congressmen Gregory Meeks and Charlie Rangel get honorary jerseys (Cosmos)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>Congressman Rangel spoke at the press conference in Times Square last Monday about the importance of the match. &quot;Soccer is the global sport that unites the international community. It is only natural that a soccer match would be among the first steps in helping to rebuild our ties with Cuba. I am proud to congratulate the New York Cosmos soccer team in representing the United States in this historic first soccer match in Cuba.&#x201D;</p>

<p>The match falls during a bye week in the NASL Spring Season, which the Cosmos kick off on April 11th at Indianapolis (7:30 PM, ONE World Sports).</p>
