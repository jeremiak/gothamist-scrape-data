<p>It&apos;s been nine months since <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111622/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/27/mls_stadium_proposal_flushing_meadows.php">details first came to light</a> about Major League Soccer&apos;s push to put a soccer stadium in Flushing Meadows Park.  But months after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111622/http://gothamist.com/2012/08/13/queens_mls_soccer_stadium_talks_clo.php">talks seemed nearly done</a>, no deal is in place&#x2014;and the league&apos;s focus on &quot;NY2&quot; may be getting diverted to Florida!</p>

<p>Speaking to the media at halftime during <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111622/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/17/rbny_0_dcu_0.php">the Red Bulls&apos; home opener</a> on Saturday, MLS Commissioner Don Garber expressed for the first time that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111622/http://www.soccerbyives.net/2013/03/becoming-expansion-priority.html">Florida may take priority</a> if the details didn&apos;t fall into place soon:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;It needs to get done so that we can move on with our expansion plans. <strong>I&apos;m not going to put any timing on that but we&apos;ve got to finalize our expansion plan.</strong> There&apos;s a lot of activity in Orlando and we have got to figure out where that fits in with our expansion timing....We are focused with Florida more so than we&apos;ve ever been in the past. There are about 80 million people in that part of the country and we don&apos;t have any representation lower than D.C., so Florida has become a bit more of a priority.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>&quot;The Don&quot; did talk up the progress on the Queens project - talks with the City are occurring regularly, meetings with the community are ongoing, and Garber remains confident they will complete the project.  But acknowledging Florida&apos;s movement (Orlando has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111622/http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2013-02-17/news/os-orlando-soccer-stadium-20130217_1_soccer-stadium-orlando-city-soccer-club-soccer-franchise">been moving rapidly</a> towards a stadium for third-division side Orlando City SC) is a big change in the league&apos;s party line that New York City would be the next expansion site.</p>

<p>Even if they do complete the stadium plan, don&apos;t hold your breath that the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111622/http://gothamist.com/tags/cosmos">New York Cosmos</a> to be the ones filling it.  In response to questions about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111622/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/16/goal_cosmos_want_to_build_a_stadium.php">their proposed stadium</a> at Belmont, Garber dismissed the idea they&apos;d join Major League Soccer: &quot;<strong>We&apos;re not at all focused on them or what they&apos;re doing</strong>...they&apos;ve made the decision, as I&apos;ve said many times, to go the NASL route. We support the lower divisions.&quot;</p>
