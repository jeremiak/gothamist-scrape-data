<p>It is once again <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111609/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhibition_game">soccer friendly</a> season.  Following success with last year&apos;s two matches at Yankee Stadium, a number of teams announced today that they will be visiting The House That Derek Built, booking two friendly matches for the end of spring.</p>

<p>First on the schedule is the Battle of the Blues: Chelsea vs. Manchester City, scheduled for May 25th, all of one week after the end of the Premier League.  The teams currently sit in 2nd (MCFC) and 3rd (Chelsea) place in England and feature the likes of Fernando Torres, Frank Lampard, Sergio Aguero, and Joe Hart. Whether or not Rafa &quot;Interim&quot; Benitez or Roberto Mancini will remain as managers for the tour may depend on the next month of play.</p>

<p>The second match up is more international, with Spain taking on Ireland on June 11th.  Spain&apos;s credentials are unmatched in world soccer: ranked #1 in the world, holding the current World Cup title and the last two European championships.  Ireland haven&apos;t had as much luck lately, with a weak showing at Euro 2012 and narrowly missing out on qualifying for the last World Cup.</p>

<p>Tickets go on sale Wednesday at 10AM ET for the general public at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111609/http://yankees.com/soccer">yankees.com/soccer</a>.  Yankees season ticket licensees have access to a pre-sale starting tomorrow. Tickets to both games will only be available in a bundle at first - with the cheapest bundle in the &quot;Terrace/Grandstand&quot; level coming in at $112.50.  Those with a taste for prawn sandwiches (we&apos;ve been told they&apos;re a staple of the Chelsea game day experience!) may choose to cough up for one of the Legends Club bundles, which top out at $829 a person.</p>
