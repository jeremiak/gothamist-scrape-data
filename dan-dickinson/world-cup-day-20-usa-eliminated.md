<p>Tuesday&apos;s World Cup action brought us heartbreak, despair, frustration, anguish, and Argentina advancing past Switzerland.</p>

<p><em>Last Night&apos;s Action</em></p>

<p><strong>Argentina 1, Switzerland 0</strong> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428110900/http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/videos/highlights/match=300186503/index.html">HIGHLIGHTS</a>) Despite a blistering attack from Argentina, the Albiceleste could not break down the Swiss in regulation, requiring extra time to secure Angel Di Maria&apos;s game-winning goal. The Swiss nearly took the game to penalties, as Blerim Dzemaili hit the post and then had the ball come right back to him on rebound. The ball hit his knee just yards in front of the goalmouth, sending it just outside the post. Argentina advances to the quarterfinals to face...</p>

<p><strong>Belgium 2, USA 1 </strong> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428110900/http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/videos/highlights/match=300186497/index.html">HIGHLIGHTS</a>) After withstanding 90 minutes of Belgium&apos;s attack to send the game to extra time, hope persisted for the USA. After the first 15 minutes of extra time saw both Kevin De Bruyne and Romelu Lukaku score to give Belgium a 2-0 lead, all seemed lost. And then 19-year-old Julian Green (it had to be him, right?) came off the bench and scored in the opening minutes of the second extra time interval, it was cause to believe all over again. But the US could not find that equalizing goal as they swarmed the Belgium goal. The final 2-1 scoreline sends them home from the Round of 16 for the second straight World Cup.</p>

<p>Heroes? There were a few. Man of the match honors easily went to Tim Howard, who put in the performance of a lifetime with 16 saves, the most of any goalkeeper in a World Cup game in the last 50 years. Much work was done by the outside backs, with DaMarcus Beasley and DeAndre Yedlin providing what limited attacking spark the USA could find. And Julian Green quieted the doubters (including us) a little with his goal.</p>

<p>Goats? Chris Wondolowski may never forgive himself for skying a perfect opportunity from six yards out that could&apos;ve spared the US the loss. Clint Dempsey could&apos;ve sent the match to penalties when a well choreographed free kick sequence fell right to him, but his first touch gave Thibaut Courtois just enough time to get well positioned and smother the shot. And it&apos;s fair to wonder why Jurgen Klinsmann waited until the second extra time period to bring on his last sub, when that attacking spark was needed sooner.</p>

<p>Oh well. We&apos;ll get them next...<em>what do you mean, four years?!</em></p>

<p><em>The Plays To Watch</em></p>

<p>Messi sets up Di Maria, who sweeps it home to win the match for Argentina:</p>

<p>Dzemaili&apos;s golden chance for Switzerland goes wide:</p>

<p>As painful as it is to watch, Kevin De Bruyne&apos;s goal featured a pretty skillful dribble: </p>

<p>And Julian Green&apos;s first touch was good: </p>

<p><em>Today&apos;s Matches</em></p>

<p>To provide a proper period of mournful reflection now that the USMNT have been eliminated, there are no World Cup games today or Thursday. The quarter final fixtures will resume on Friday. (We&apos;ll be taking tomorrow off from World Cup coverage so Pablo can photoshop more crying eagles.)</p>
