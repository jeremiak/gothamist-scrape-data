title: Red Bulls Held To A Draw In Toronto

										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="2012_06_redbulls21.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111913im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2012_06_redbulls21.jpg" width="640" height="361"> <br> <i> via NY Red Bulls</i></div> <p></p>

<p>Week in and week out, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111913/http://gothamist.com/tags/redbulls">New York Red Bulls</a> observers are left wondering: which team will we see on the field?  Will it be the free-flowing, attacking offense that ran up huge victories in April?  The gritty, determined defense that pulled off a solid shutout streak in May?  Or the inconsistent, uncoordinated side that occasionally rears its head in games that should be cakewalks?  Unfortunately, it was the latter that traveled to Toronto on Saturday, where the Red Bulls managed to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111913/http://www.mlssoccer.com/matchcenter/2012-06-30-tor-v-ny/">escape with a 1-1 draw</a> that almost slipped away.</p>

<p>Jan Gunnar Solli, having finally opened his scoring account last week against DC United, struck early, volleying home a cross from defender Brandon Barklage just four minutes into the game.  But Toronto - who&apos;s form had recovered from their historically awful 0-9-0 start to the season - answered back just two minutes later, with Danny Koevermans beating Solli to heading home a corner kick.</p>

<p>The remainder of the game was back and forth but with Toronto looking the better of the two sides.  Toronto&apos;s defense managed to hold New York to just that single shot on goal, with Kenny Cooper being unable to break his now four game goalless streak.  TFC nearly walked away with a win were it not for the heroics of Stephen Keel, who cleared a potential scoring opportunity off the goal line.  RBNY took another hit in the dying moments as Heath Pearce looked to have sustained a hamstring injury.</p>

<p>While the conventional wisdom is that a point on the road is always a good result (and some of the team seemed okay with the result), DC United&apos;s win over Montreal leaves the Red Bulls back in second place in the east.  New York will have much of the week to prepare for a trip to Gillette Stadium to face the New England Revolution.  RBNY has not won in Foxboro since July 15th of 2000.  With the Revs having only lost at home once this season, and Thierry Henry&apos;s allergy to turf liable to flair up at any minute, we won&apos;t be holding our breath that the streak will end this year.</p>
