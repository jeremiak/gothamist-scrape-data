<p>The World Cup is finally here. 64 games involving 32 countries over 31 days. There&#x2019;s only one game to start us off, but perhaps that&#x2019;s for the best. We wouldn&apos;t want anyone to be over-stimulated on the first day.  </p>

<p><strong>Today&#x2019;s Matches</strong></p>

<p><strong>Brazil vs. Croatia</strong> (4PM ET, ESPN) For the hosts, it&#x2019;s a chance to start off their first tournament on home soil since 1950 on the right foot, and overcome what&#x2019;s likely the toughest challenge in their group. For Croatia, it&#x2019;s a statement game: hold Brazil to a draw, or better yet pull out a victory, and all those precious narratives change. It&#x2019;s probably the best game Group A will see, so it&#x2019;s a fine chance to duck out from work early and down your first caipirinha of the tournament.

<p><strong>What Else Is Going On?</strong></p>

<p>Patchy turf at the stadium in Manaus <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111041/http://www.bigstory.ap.org/article/patchy-turf-causing-concern-amazonian-cup-venue">is the latest</a> in a long line of issues about Brazil&#x2019;s readiness. The groundskeeping crew are executing &#x201C;emergency plans&#x201D; but it is not expected to be in good condition by the Group D match there between Italy and England on Saturday. The US is scheduled to play Portugal there on June 22nd.</p>

<p>The US and Belgium were scheduled for a closed-door friendly on Thursday, but it was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111041/http://www.sportingnews.com/soccer/story/2014-06-11/world-cup-2014-us-soccer-usa-friendly-belgium-canceled-jurgen-klinsmann">scratched off the schedule</a> Wednesday afternoon. The cause: Belgium coach Marc Wilmots didn&#x2019;t want to risk getting stuck in traffic on the way to Sao Paulo.</p>

<p>Landon Donovan was added to a World Cup roster on Wednesday, but unfortunately, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111041/http://espnmediazone.com/us/press-releases/2014/06/espn-adds-landon-donovan-to-2014-fifa-world-cup-roster/">it was just ESPN&#x2019;s</a>. Donovan will make studio appearances for all the US games, which will get super awkward if Klinsmann&#x2019;s choice to leave him home backfires. </p>

<p>Landon also wants you to remember your priorities during the World Cup:</p>

<p>The Onion helpfully put together <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111041/http://www.theonion.com/articles/world-cup-teams-to-watch,36253/">a team guide</a> if you&#x2019;re still on the fence about who to support.</p>

<p>And because only FIFA can be more ridiculous than The Onion: FIFA president Sepp Blatter deftly sidestepped concerns about bribery, racism, and term limits when he suggested <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111041/http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/sepp-blatter-brushes-corruption-proposes-3678200">an intergalactic football competition</a>. Oh Sepp, never change!</p>
