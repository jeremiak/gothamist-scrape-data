<p><strong>LIVERPOOL BEATS MANCHESTER CITY ON PENALTIES</strong></p>

<p>Yankee Stadium hosted its only soccer event of the summer on Wednesday, with Liverpool and Manchester City battling as part of the International Challenge Cup. We&apos;ll spare you trying to find something nice to say about the dull first half, but play picked up in the second half. Manchester City would twice take the lead thanks to Liverpool&apos;s defensive slips, but Liverpool would find goals from Jordan Henderson and Raheem Sterling to level the scoreline.</p>

<p>Most summer friendlies, not meaning much of anything, are willing to end in a draw, but not the ICC! Penalties were called for to declare a victor, and after a number of poor attempts, Liverpool were able to emerge victorious 3-1.</p>

<p>Two things in particular struck us at the friendly. First, that the announced attendance -  49,653 - was higher than any Yankees home game to date in 2014. Take that, baseball! But second, despite all the Manchester City/NYCFC corporate synergy going on (both David Villa and Frank Lampard were in attendance), the crowd was predominantly Liverpool fans in full voice. </p>

<p>For the evening at least, Yankee Stadium was red. Speaking of red...</p>

<p><strong>RED BULLS DRAW IN SALT LAKE, REPORTEDLY IN TALKS WITH  RONALDINHO</strong></p>

<p>The Red Bulls were on the road Wednesday night, traveling to Rio Tinto Stadium in Sandy, Utah for a league match with Real Salt Lake. What looked like a typically dire Metro performance, including conceding an early goal from Joao Plata, was rescued by Thierry Henry, who again made a ridiculous goal look easy. Henry took a lay-off from Tim Cahill and casually placed a twenty yard post far post to secure a 1-1 draw.</p>

<p>The team was blas&#xE9; about getting a road point. &quot;Overall, we are close to the point in the season where you have to stop saying a point&#x2019;s good on the road,&quot; said Coach Mike Petke, &quot;but tonight, it&#x2019;s a good point. We haven&#x2019;t won here since 2008, and I think the guys did enough to win tonight, but we&#x2019;ll take a point.&#x201D;</p>

<p>With the MLS summer transfer window deadline looming, Red Bulls fans have been wringing their hands as to whether their club would bring in a third Designated Player, largely to counteract the perceived momentum of NYCFC&apos;s signings. Right on cue, Brazilian media are filing multiple reports that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428110805/http://esporte.uol.com.br/futebol/ultimas-noticias/2014/07/31/ronaldinho-esta-perto-de-assinar-com-ny-red-bulls-mas-irmao-mantem-sigilo.htm">Ronaldinho is in talks to join to squad</a>. A Brazilian attacker well known for his skillful tricks and flicks, Ronaldinho recently left Atletico Mineiro in Brazil. A move to the Red Bulls would re-unite him with his former Barcelona teammate Thierry Henry, and could give the Red Bulls a creative spark that the team has been lacking for years.</p>

<p>The Red Bulls face the New England Revolution on Saturday at home.</p>

<p><strong>BAYERN MUNICH DEFEATS CD GUADALAJARA</strong></p>

<p>As the opening salvo in their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428110805/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/01/sports/soccer/bayern-munich-looks-to-build-its-brand-in-the-united-states.html?ref=soccer">US brand-building exercise</a>, Bayern Munich took to the field at Red Bull Arena on Thursday, defeating CD Guadalajara 1-0 in what was dubbed the &quot;Audi Football Summit&quot;. The loan goal came from Peruvian forward Claudio Pizarro, who nodded home a corner kick in the 10th minute.</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="2014_07_baryenr.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428110805im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2014_07_baryenr.jpg" width="640" height="523"> <br> <i> Chivas&apos; Patricio Araujo, left, and Bayern Munich&apos;s Robert Lewandowski compete for the ball (AP)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>Despite being in pre-season form and having just gotten off the plane the night before, Bayern were enjoyable to watch, with creative attacks and movement throughout the match. USMNT prodigy Julian Green did not dress, having suffered what coach Pep Guardiola characterized as a knee injury.</p>

<p>We are also required to note (it&apos;s in the Sports Cliche Style Guide) that despite being a friendly, the game didn&apos;t seem very friendly. Thirty fouls and five yellow cards added up to a pretty physical night for what was ultimately an exhibition match.</p>
