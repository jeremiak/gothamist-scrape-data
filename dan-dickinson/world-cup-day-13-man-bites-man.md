<p>Tuesday&apos;s World Cup action brought us the bite heard around the world, a late winner for Greece, Colombian dominance, and the curse of Mick Jagger.</p>

<p><em>Last Night&apos;s Action</em></p>

<p><strong>Costa Rica 0, England 0</strong> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428110928/http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/videos/highlights/match=300186484/index.html">HIGHLIGHTS</a>) With nothing on the line for England&apos;s last match, it was little surprise that basically nothing happened. The match saw just three shots on goal total as Costa Rica put out a defensive line-up and soaked up England&apos;s attack. Roy Hodgson made nine changes to the lineup to give some of the younger kids minutes. England go home with a single point out of nine possible, while Costa Rica win the group.</p>

<p><strong>Italy 0, Uruguay 1</strong> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428110928/http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/videos/highlights/match=300186465/index.html">HIGHLIGHTS</a>) This, too, looked like a snoozer, with both Uruguay and Italy gumming up the midfield and little quality attacking. Even a 59th minute red card to Claudio Marchisio that forced Italy to close out the match with 10 men didn&apos;t liven things up. But then, our boredom was rescued by none other than Luis Suarez, injecting the entire tournament with a healthy dose of complete insanity.</p>

<p>Suarez appeared to headbutt Giorgio Chiellini&apos;s shoulder in an off the ball incident just 12 minutes from the end of the match. Then a creeping sense of deja vu washed over global soccer fans. Why is Suarez, a man who notoriously earned bans in both the Dutch Eredivisie and the English Premier League for biting opponents, holding his teeth in pain? Why is Chiellini holding his shoulder and screaming at the referee? DID HE SERIOUSLY JUST BITE SOMEONE FOR A THIRD TIME? </p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="2014_06_suarez2.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428110928im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2014_06_suarez2.jpg" width="640" height="545"> <br> <i> Giorgio Chiellini shows his shoulder (AP)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>It certainly appeared that way, especially when Chiellini pulled down his jersey to SHOW THE REFEREE BITE MARKS ON HIS SHOULDER. Italy went into full protest mode, outraged that none of the officiating staff had seen the incident or cared about some very clear evidence that a player had been bitten. Perhaps it was all just a clever ploy: just a minute later, Uruguay&apos;s Diego Godin would score off a corner, and end Italy&apos;s tournament with teeth marks as the only souvenir.</p>

<p><strong>Japan 1, Colombia 4</strong> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428110928/http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/videos/highlights/match=300186457/index.html">HIGHLIGHTS</a>) Japan had the faintest glimmer of hope when they leveled the match 1-1 at the end of the first half, but Colombia would not be denied a perfect record in group play. James Rodriguez continues to be the star of the tournament, notching one goal and two assists.</p>

<p><strong>Ivory Coast 1, Greece 2</strong> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428110928/http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/videos/highlights/match=300186455/index.html">HIGHLIGHTS</a> It&apos;s a cruel sport sometimes. Ivory Coast only needed a draw to advance, and they looked secure with a 1-1 score line. With the clock ticking deep into stoppage time, Greece drew a penalty when Georgios Samaras was tripped up in the box. Samaras calmly stepped up and smashed home the spot kick, improbably sending Greece on to the Round of 16 and sending Les Elephants packing.</p>

<p><em>A Play To Watch That Didn&apos;t Involve Cannibalism</em></p>

<p>A sweet juke and chipped goal from Colombia&apos;s James Rodriguez:</p>

<p><em>Today&apos;s Matches</em></p>

<p><strong>Bosnia-Herzegovina vs. Iran</strong> (12PM ET, ESPN2) <br>
<strong>Nigeria vs. Argentina</strong> (12PM ET, ESPN) </p>

<p>Bosnia is already out, and Argentina is already through, so it&apos;s down to Nigeria and Iran for the remaining spot in the group. Nigeria only need a point to secure their passage to the Round of 16, and Iran has yet to score a goal at the tournament. </p>

<p><strong>Ecuador vs. France</strong> (4PM ET, ESPN) <br>
<strong>Honduras vs. Switzerland</strong> (4PM ET, ESPN2)</p>

<p>France has been quite fun to watch, scoring eight goals in two games, so they&apos;re practically guaranteed the top spot in the group barring a massive goal swing. Ecuador and Switzerland will both be striving for the second spot, with Ecuador holding the edge in goal differential should they remain tied on points. Honduras, despite looking wretched, could still qualify with a huge performance over Switzerland and some help from the French.</p>
