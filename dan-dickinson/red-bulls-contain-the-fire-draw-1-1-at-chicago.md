<p>It&apos;s slowly starting to come together for the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111209/http://gothamist.com/tags/redbulls">New York Red Bulls</a>.  The team looked in control for the first time this season, putting in a solid performance at Chicago to bring home a 1-1 draw thanks to a Dax McCarty goal.</p>

<p><strong>FULL HIGHLIGHTS</strong></p>

<p><strong>MATCH NOTES</strong></p>

<p><em>Dax saves the day.</em>  After conceding a goal early&#x2014;a free header for Chicago&apos;s Jeff Larentowicz on a corner kick&#x2014;the Red Bulls seemed fast on their way to another shellacking in Bridgeview.  But a quarter of an hour later, Dax McCarty would find his first goal of the season, striking home a ball that had caromed around Chicago&apos;s penalty area on a NY corner kick.  It would be enough to allow New York to hold the draw for the road point.</p>

<p><em>Not quite a complete performance, but getting there.</em>  Having gone from &quot;played off the field&quot; in Week 1 to &quot;not looking sure of themselves&quot; in Week 2, it was a relief to see New York move to &quot;the better team for most of the game&quot; in Week 3.  The defense was calm, and the midfield held control of the game.  The attackers had opportunities, but seemed to spend much of the game looking for the perfect final touch rather than trying to challenge Sean Johnson.  With the attack only averaging about three shots on goal per game in 2014, more needs to be done to generate goals.</p>

<p><em>Peguy Luyindula made quite the insertion.</em>  Many fans lamented that a week after calling for more creativity in the attack, Peguy Luyindula would be left on the bench in favor of Eric Alexander for the central midfield role.  But Peguy&apos;s eventual substitution in the 72nd minute would help create some solid late chances...as well as this one:</p>

<p><em>Some players still seem stuck in pre-season.</em>  No one seems yet to be able to answer the question of what Richard Eckersley offers that Brandon Barklage didn&apos;t (and probably at less salary).  Neither Bobby Convey nor Eric Alexander have yet to stake their claim to earning a starting spot.  And Tim Cahill seems to be struggling to find his form, having only had one shot  despite playing every minute of the season so far.</p>

<p><strong>LOOKING AHEAD</strong></p>

<p>The Red Bulls host Chivas USA for the last time ever.  Yes, lowly Chivas USA, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111209/http://www.sbnation.com/soccer/2014/2/24/5441624/Chivas-USA-sold-jorge-vergara-legacy">a decade-long blight on MLS</a>, will no longer be Chivas USA after 2014.  The league bought out owner Jorge Vergara during the off-season and plan on finding a new owner&#x2014;or at least a new name&#x2014;for 2015.  So come enjoy the Goats one final time, and rest assured knowing that if Erick &quot;Cubo&quot; Torres scores, he&apos;ll do <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111209/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6gIrl4r3R0">a really terrible robot celebration</a>.  (New York hasn&apos;t fared well against Chivas USA lately; their last win against the Goats came in 2010.)</p>

<p><strong>POST-MATCH REACTIONS</strong></p>

<p><strong>Coach Mike Petke on the performance:</strong> &quot;I was very, very happy.  Very happy and satisfied with our effort and the way we started the game and played throughout, to be honest with you.  It&#x2019;s something we really haven&#x2019;t seen over the last few games...The biggest thing for me was our balance today.  It&#x2019;s what we haven&#x2019;t seen a lot from preseason until now; we seem like one team from front to back instead of a group of six and a group of four.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Dax McCarty on scoring another set piece goal:</strong> &quot;It&#x2019;s funny, I don&#x2019;t know, I&#x2019;m not one the biggest guys on the field, but it&#x2019;s just a mentality.  You just want to have to attack the ball; you have to want to score goals.  Luckily my coaches have faith in me to put me in the box in those situations and I&#x2019;m just going to try and keep being a pest and being dangerous on set pieces.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Luis Robles on what changed going in to Chicago:</strong> &quot;I think what [Petke] said before the game was important.  He said certain things we can&#x2019;t control like the weather and the field, and not necessarily the other team.  The things that we can control, we did, and we kept our defensive shape well enough, except for the free kick, corner kick goal.  But some of the things we&#x2019;ve been working on we&#x2019;re starting to see improvement.  Our defensive shape I thought, as difficult as the field was today, the guys in the back did a great job.&quot;</p>
