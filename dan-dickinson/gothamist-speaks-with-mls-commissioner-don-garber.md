<p><em>At today&apos;s Bloomberg Sports Business Summit in Chelsea, MLS Commissioner Don Garber and US Soccer Federation President Sunil Gulati spoke about the state of soccer in the US following the 2014 World Cup. We had the opportunity to speak with MLS Commissioner Don Garber shortly after his talk on a variety of topics impacting MLS, including league expansion, the sale of a struggling franchise in Los Angeles, and whether or not a player acquisition method that happens over Skype is a &quot;blind draw&quot;.</em></p>

<p><strong>In July 2013, Major League Soccer declared that the league would expand to 24 teams by 2020. Where does the league&apos;s expansion plans stand?</strong></p>

<p>Don Garber: You know there&#x2019;s more interest than ever before in investing in Major League Soccer, and I think that&#x2019;s a function of the sport just becoming more and more popular. The league beginning to show that it&#x2019;s a good, long term investment, although we have like a lot of new businesses, no shortage of short term issues. We&#x2019;re excited about New York and Orlando coming in, both seem to be having a reasonably good launch of its season tickets and driving commercial revenues. There are challenges in facilities in many markets, challenges in New York. We&#x2019;re in discussions in Las Vegas, discussions in Sacramento, discussions in Minneapolis, discussions here in El Paso, and it&#x2019;s all very positive.</p>

<p><strong>How do the smaller markets, like Salt Lake and Kansas City, play into the league&apos;s expansion plans?</strong></p>

<p>DG: Yesterday we had the owner of Real Salt Lake in. He should be really, really congratulated on doing a terrific job with that club. You can count them, but they&#x2019;ve been selling out all of their games. They&#x2019;ve got a real deep connection in the community, their commercial revenue is growing, they&#x2019;ve got a terrific team on the field and have for many years. Kansas City is another smaller market that has done extremely well. It seems that when you&#x2019;re in a smaller market and you have the right ownership group and the right stadium plan, it&#x2019;s a pretty good formula for success. There&#x2019;s less competition, and you can be more focused. In some of our larger markets where there&#x2019;s more competition, we have had struggles, going into our 20th year, that&#x2019;s just some of the lessons that we&#x2019;ve learned, and now we can address some of those issues and try to improve.</p>

<p><strong>The league had been pushing many years for teams to have a &quot;soccer specific stadium&quot; of around 20,000 seats to house the team. There&apos;s been some variance as of late, with Atlanta playing in a new downtown stadium that will also house the Falcons, and NYCFC playing in Yankee Stadium. Has the thinking changed?</strong></p>

<p>DG: You know, hindsight&#x2019;s 20/20, and you make decisions today that you hope will last long enough to be able to pay off whatever investment the investor&#x2014;and if it&#x2019;s a public partnership, the taxpayer&#x2014;can have on participating on the stadium. There&#x2019;s no doubt that the stadium location is key, and we&#x2019;ve seen tremendous success in downtown stadiums, even if they&#x2019;re large like in the case of Seattle. We&#x2019;ve made a commitment in Atlanta where it&#x2019;s a downtown stadium, it&#x2019;s gonna be brand new stadium. So the best thing to say is, we need to have our owners own and operate their facility, we need to have it centrally located, and we need to be in a situation where it is effectively able to deliver on the expectations of fans. And as the league continues to grow, some of our thinking has evolved, and it might be different 20 years from now. You think of the move that the NFL has had over the last generation of building stadiums. They&#x2019;ve changed their views. Stadium location has been key, some of them have roofs on them, some of them have downsized. So this is a process that&#x2019;s a long term project, and times&#x2014;over certain periods of time you&#x2019;re thinking changes.</p>

<p><strong>Where does the proposed franchise in Miami, to be partially owned by David Beckham, stand with their search for a stadium?</strong></p>

<p>DG: They are still David and Simon Fuller, and his partners are very focused on putting together a stadium plan so that they could execute on their expansion option. They&#x2019;ve hit a number of obstacles, it&#x2019;s been very difficult to get anything done there, but I&#x2019;m not sure Miami is much different than any other large market where the urban core has been fairly developed. They&#x2019;re going to continue to do everything they can to try to get a stadium deal done, and hopefully if they do, they&#x2019;ll be able to execute their option and they can join the league.</p>

<p><strong>Has there been any movement with the sale of Chivas USA after the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428110751/http://www.mlssoccer.com/news/article/2014/02/20/major-league-soccer-purchases-chivas-usa">league bought out previous ownership</a> at the end of 2013?</strong></p>

<p>DG: We&#x2019;re making a lot of progress with the sale of our second team in LA. A lot of progress.</p>

<p><strong>Do you still expect the purchase to complete by the end of this season?</strong></p>

<p>DG: I do.</p>

<p><strong>Is there a plan B in case it doesn&#x2019;t? Do you continue on as Chivas for another year?</strong></p>

<p>DG: Our plan B is&#x2014;</p>

<p><strong>To finish the sale?</strong></p>

<p>DG: To finish the sale [laughs]. You finished a good quote for me.</p>

<p><strong>Were you surprised that the reaction of the signing of Jermaine Jones to New England was more about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428110751/http://www.espnfc.com/major-league-soccer/19/blog/post/2002173/jermaine-jones-deal-shows-need-for-mls-transparency">the method of allocation</a> rather than that Jermaine Jones was coming to MLS?</strong></p>

<p>DG: You know, nothing surprises me anymore, because our fan base gets more sophisticated and gets more deeply engaged in the inner workings of the league, like they are in other leagues. Combined with the fact that there&#x2019;s more media that&#x2019;s interested in the inner workings of the league. It&#x2019;s to be expected. That was a situation we never faced before. We had a player that was a free agent coming into the league, coming at a salary level that put him at a different category than others, and we had two teams that desperately wanted to have him, willing to make that investment. We had no way to allocate or assign that player based on the rules that we had in the league. So we had a draw&#x2014;it wasn&#x2019;t a blind draw by the way&#x2014;it was via Skype, and two teams participated, and I think it was a little unfair to call it a blind draw.</p>

<p>But you know, you have to live and learn by these things. We clearly need to look, as we go through our new collective bargaining agreement, to have more transparent rules. To have our fans, who are very committed to our league, understand them more. And probably be a lot more transparent about how we&#x2019;re making decisions than we&#x2019;ve made in the past. You can&#x2019;t change midstream, because we&#x2019;ve had rules in place, but we&#x2019;re certainly looking, continually looking at ways that we can be more transparent. Good question.</p>

<p><strong>Are you sad to see longtime MLS executive Tim Leiweke leave Toronto FC?</strong></p>

<p>DG: Well, you know I was sad to see Tim leave LA. I&#x2019;m sad to see him leave Toronto. But he loves this game, it&#x2019;s in his blood, and I wouldn&#x2019;t be surprised if somehow he gets back in. You know, Tim&#x2019;s a very good friend of mine, and I&#x2019;ll always be very close to him.</p>

<p><strong>Adam Silver spoke earlier at the event about gambling, and how he didn&#x2019;t see it as a moral issue, but more of something that could be about the revenue stream and a way to increase engagement for the NBA. Has there been any consideration of legalized gaming for MLS?</strong></p>

<p>DG: Well, I&#x2019;ve always believed that&#x2014;and perhaps more so than most&#x2014;that there&#x2019;s so much gambling that takes place on games, to pretend that it doesn&#x2019;t exist is na&#xEF;ve. And I think the question is: how do you have the proper checks and balances in place to make sure that you don&#x2019;t have any of the negativity associated with things that can provide improper incentives. Gambling is an integral part of the game overseas, it&#x2019;s not an integral part of the game here in the United States, and that&#x2019;s okay for now, but I don&#x2019;t know what it will look like in the future. Certainly, it&#x2019;s something that anything we can do, that can be controlled, that would increase fan connection and engagement with Major League Soccer is a net positive.</p>
