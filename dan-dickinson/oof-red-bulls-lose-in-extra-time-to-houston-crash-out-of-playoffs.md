<p>It&apos;s an unfortunately familiar scene in the MLS playoffs.  Few teams in MLS can match New York&apos;s ability to reach the post season, having qualified for the post-season 14 times in 18 seasons.  But few also match New York&apos;s inability to advance, having failed to move beyond the Conference Semifinal (or Quarterfinals, in the earlier days) 12 out of those 14 tries.  This year, it was a 2-1 defeat at the hands of the Houston Dynamo, who came to Harrison after a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111308/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/04/red_bulls_send_playoffs_back_home_w.php">2-2 draw</a> in the leg at BBVA Compass Stadium on Sunday.</p>

<p>The first half was marked with two goals that could charitably be called &quot;bloopers.&quot; The Red Bulls would draw first blood thanks to Houston goalkeeper Tally Hall spilling a cross, allowing Bradley Wright-Phillips to tap in the loose ball.  The Red Bulls would gift Houston a goal of their own shortly after when NY defender Ibrahim Sekagya cleared the ball straight to Houston&apos;s Brad Davis&#x2014;who was unmarked at the top of the box. Davis easily put a shot past Luis Robles, and the game went into half-time level.</p>

<p>The second half&#x2014;and for that matter most of extra time, as the series was drawn on aggregate at the end of regulation&#x2014;was a show of domination by the Red Bulls, bombing the Houston goal with shot after shot.  Some came close&#x2014;an Henry bicycle kick, a crafty deflection off Cahill, a header off the crossbar.  But the chances would not get past Tally Hall or Houston&apos;s defense as the clock ticked on.</p>

<p>When you can&apos;t score, all it takes is one moment for the match to swing away from you.  That one moment came in the first half of extra time, as Omar Cummings would get his foot just enough on a ball pinging around the box.  While Robles made a diving save to try and keep it out, it was ruled to have fully crossed the line by the officiating team.  New York would keep trying, but with tiring legs and a bunkering Houston, the final whistle would blow and end their hopes of winning a first MLS Cup to go with their first Supporters Shield.</p>

<p>The result is a tough pill to swallow after what was widely considered a great season, and one that leaves us with a few questions:</p>

<p><strong>I am angry/upset/despondent. Who can I blame for this collapse?</strong></p>

<p>It would be easy to try and pin this on the defense. Two blown clearances leading to two goals in two matches (Carney on Sunday, Sekagya on Wednesday) helped swing the aggregate Houston&apos;s way, and Olave&apos;s red card took an experienced defender out of contention for the second leg.  But that may be unfair&#x2014;beyond those momentary blips, the defense generally stood strong, even without Olave in the second leg.</p>

<p>Alternately, you could consider the offense, which was largely held out of the game in the first leg and ineffective in the second.  Thierry Henry contributed 9 shots during the home leg, but only 2 were on target.  Bradley Wright-Phillips found NY&apos;s only goal, but otherwise didn&apos;t generate much.  And so on down the lineup - leading to frustrating moments where no one on the team seemed to be clear on who should be taking a shot or how to work the ball to that person.  Better finishing and this game is a different story.</p>

<p>In a pinch, you could always grumble about referee Silviu Petrescu, who constantly blew his whistle late, awarded fouls in the wrong direction, and kept his cards in his pocket as the game grew increasingly physical.</p>

<p><strong>How did Mike Petke do as a head coach, and will he be back?</strong></p>

<p>For a coach with no head coaching experience at <em>any</em> level (six years at Akron and coaching the Olympic team means Caleb Porter is not a rookie head coach, folks), Petke&apos;s regular season triumph speaks volumes.  This isn&apos;t to say he can&apos;t improve&#x2014;Mike could be well served with some additional tactical classes or going for a formal coaching license.  But as a leader, he instilled the team with a passion and a drive that took them far.</p>

<p>As for his return&#x2014;signs point to yes, but the picture is murky.  There&apos;s been some conflicting reports on Petke&apos;s official status with the team, with ESPN&apos;s Taylor Twellman reporting last week he was on a 1 year contract with no option.  Red Bull Global Director of Football Gerard Houlier disputed this before the match, telling KickTV that Petke had a three year deal.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111308/http://nypost.com/2013/11/07/no-new-deal-yet-for-red-bulls-coach/">Brian Lewis from the Post inquired after the match</a> to find Petke deny signing an extension, while GM Jerome de Bontin instead said Petke was on a two-year deal.</p>

<p>So he&apos;s either on a one year deal, or a two year deal, or a three year deal - pretty clear.  Hopefully Houlier&apos;s broader statement - &quot;we will take care of Mike&quot; - is enough of a sign that even if his deal is not totally locked down, Red Bull ownership values his leadership enough to fix his deal.</p>

<p><strong>How much rebuilding does this team do in the offseason?</strong></p>

<p>Probably not as much as in past years.  Beyond the seemingly traditional yearly release of players who didn&apos;t feature much, there are a couple areas to keep an eye on.</p>

<p>A new strike partner for Thierry Henry may again be a target.  While Fabian Espindola did deliver nine regular season goals, he never seemed to develop a real partnership with Henry and ended up on the bench later in the season. Peguy Luyindula ended up being a terrible forward (but a remarkable creative attacking midfielder), so he&apos;s out of the striker pool.  Bradley Wright-Phillips has shown spark but his sample size at this point is too small.  With Henry&apos;s production starting to taper off as he goes later into his career, the team may look for more firepower up front.</p>

<p>Additionally, the defense should get some scrutiny.  There&apos;s no denying Jamison Olave was a huge addition and Markus Holgersson had his best year since joining the club. But constant rotation to the fullbacks and sporadic injury problems meant the defense was getting shuffled repeatedly and occasionally lacked depth.  The team&apos;s 41 goals allowed during the regular season was high in comparison to clubs like Kansas City or Portland.  Tightening that up may be key for next year.</p>

<p><strong>Can you call the 2013 Red Bulls season a success?</strong></p>

<p>Unquestionably, yes.  Even with the annual failure in the playoffs, the team finally shook their history off and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111308/https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BYHNMKjIEAAoLga.jpg">won a trophy</a>, posting the best regular season record of any MLS team.  CONCACAF Champions League soccer awaits next fall.  Just as importantly, they found a team identity (credit to Petke) and a work ethic (credit to Cahill) that had been missing for so many years.</p>

<p><strong>POST-MATCH REACTIONS</strong></p>

<p><strong>Mike Petke on what went wrong:</strong> &quot;Well, what went wrong tonight? Besides them scoring more goals? We didn&#x2019;t finish. I think we were a bit off on our crossing, on our passing. I think we were a bit too urgent for most of the night instead of calming the match down. Yeah, at the end of the day they did what they had to do to come in here and get a result. Hats off to Houston.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Thierry Henry on 2013:</strong> &quot;At the end of the day, we&#x2019;re going to have to sleep on it and reflect on it. You lose and you win as a team. Not long ago, we were celebrating against Chicago, the Supporters&#x2019; Shield, and at the end of the day, like I said, it&#x2019;s great for the club but we didn&#x2019;t manage to go where we wanted to go. You can&#x2019;t point fingers at a couple of mistakes. We lost as a team.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Tim Cahill on Houston&apos;s play:</strong> &quot;No, they didn&#x2019;t create hardly anything I think. We gifted them goals away from home and then at home. Nothing much to say except they took their chances, their very few chances of what they had and they&#x2019;re an ugly team to play against. Basically destroy the game and they pressed us so high and turned it into one of them games, but you also have to give credit to them because to come here and beat us on our own turf and come back from one nil down. They&#x2019;re a decent team, but from a standard of what we&#x2019;ve been showing all season, we&#x2019;ve given a gift tonight.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Markus Holgersson:</strong> &quot;I am so disappointed and empty, and yeah, it&#x2019;s hard...This team is one of the most talented teams I&#x2019;ve played for and it&#x2019;s an amazing team, we have amazing players, but we couldn&#x2019;t score today and then they scored. Of four goals we gave them three, it&#x2019;s not good enough.&quot;</p>
