<p>The floodgates are open again with news relating to Major League Soccer&apos;s desires for a stadium at Flushing Meadows Corona Park.  Now ten months since <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111550/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/27/mls_stadium_proposal_flushing_meadows.php">word of it first came to light</a>, and one month after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111550/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/18/is_time_running_out_on_the_queens_m.php">the league expressed frustration at the process</a>, it seems that an expansion announcement is imminent&#x2014;but may now be complicated with other construction on the same location.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111550/http://www.bigapplesoccer.com/leagues/mls2.php?article_id=33374">proclamation from the league</a> came Wednesday night, with MLS Commissioner Don Garber spoke to reporters in Toronto.  &quot;We are deeply engaged with potential ownership groups,&quot; said Garber, &quot;and we&apos;re hopeful to be able to announce a 20th team within the next [four to six weeks].&quot;  Garber also indicated that it&apos;s Flushing Meadows or bust: &quot;If we get this done, it will be in Flushing Meadow Park. There is no Plan B.&quot;</p>

<p>If you were hoping that the New York Cosmos would abandon <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111550/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/16/goal_cosmos_want_to_build_a_stadium.php">their own stadium plan</a> and come to terms with the league, prepare for disappointment.  Garber emphatically ruled out the Cosmos as being considered for NY2&#x2014;and this shouldn&apos;t come as a surprise, as the Cosmos have indicated they&apos;re happy in NASL due to differences in how the league is structured.  It doesn&apos;t seem that MLS wants them either, with the Garber reportedly snarking, &quot;Pele is not playing for them anymore. Neither is Frank Beckenbauer.&quot;  (We&apos;re unclear on whether Garber or the AP wire botched the name of German legend Franz Beckenbauer.)</p>

<p>If not the Cosmos, then who?  The league has spoken in the past that &quot;multiple ownership groups&quot; were interested, and one name has returned to the forefront: Manchester City.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111550/http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/thegoalkeeper/Manchester-City-takes-lead-to-buy-New-York-MLS-expansion-team-but-theres-no-deal-yet.html">Jonathan Tannenwald of Philly.com</a> has reported that multiple sources are confirming that City&apos;s ownership group, led by Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan, are &quot;in the lead&quot; in discussions for what would be the 20th MLS franchise.  It&apos;s hard not to notice that City would be visiting NYC right in the middle of that four to six week period for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111550/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/08/soccer_returns_to_yankee_stadium_ch.php">their friendly with Chelsea</a> at Yankee Stadium.</p>

<p>Even if City&apos;s management group is lined up, there&apos;s still the looming issue that the stadium deal flat out isn&apos;t done, and the plan may need to get done by the end of the year.  Mayor Bloomberg may feel strongly enough about it to make it one of his &quot;legacy projects&quot;, but nine mayoral candidates <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111550/http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/politics/2013/04/8529329/mayoral-candidates-mls-stadium-queens-meh">gave the plan a collective &quot;meh&quot;</a> during a mayoral forum.  No candidate indicated they were solidly for or against the stadium.  (Is there a sadder question in the world than Brian Lehrer asking &quot;John Liu, you want to talk about your ambivalence here?&quot;?)  Without a clear sign that the next mayor will back the project as strongly as Bloomberg, MLS may be rushing to close the deal before he leaves Gracie Mansion.</p>

<p>It somehow gets even better: Construction has already begun at Flushing Meadows Corona Park, in almost the exact spot where the stadium is supposed to go.  But the construction isn&apos;t for the stadium&#x2014;it&apos;s an alleged $2.8 million renovation of the community soccer fields already there!  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111550/http://www.timesledger.com/stories/2013/17/parkconstruction_all_2013_04_26_q.html">Joe Anuta of the Times Ledger reported</a> that the Parks Department has begun work on an improvement plan approved by City Councilperson Julissa Ferreras.  From the looks of it, the city is pumping millions of dollars into improving an area that might soon be demolished for a new stadium.  We&apos;re not sure if this is a Hail Mary to stop the stadium plan or a potentially multi-million dollar mistake, but either way, it&apos;s sure to throw a wrench into the discussions.  (We reached out to Councilperson Ferreras for comment but did not receive a response.)</p>
