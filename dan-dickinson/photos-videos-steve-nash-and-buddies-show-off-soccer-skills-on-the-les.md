</div></div>					<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111921/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/26/soccer_in_the_city_steve_nash_throw.php">Steve Nash Showdown returned</a> to the Lower East Side on Wednesday night, with stars of the NBA and international soccer running wild in an 8v8 soccer match at Sara D. Roosevelt Park.</p>

<p>Defying all conventional logic, the opening goal was scored by none other than ESPN senior NBA reporter Marc Stein. Media dominance continued as NBA analyst Simone Sandri found the back of the net, but before long Salomon Kalou reminded the crowd that there were actual athletes on the field with a lovely finish.  The game was a constant back-and-forth battle, with Steve Nash getting assists, Elton Brand whiffing on multiple shots, and some impressive goalkeeping.  Due to a handful of stars not being able to play, one notably strange addition to the night was RBNY midfielder Mehdi Ballouchy, who put on a clinic of back-passing and strange giveaways.</p>

<p>All told, the fundraiser seemed like another rousing success, with the crowd tightly packed against the length of the fence.  If you missed out, be sure to follow the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111921/http://twitter.com/SteveNashFdn">Steve Nash Foundation on Twitter</a>, as next year&apos;s Showdown will be here before you know it.</p>
