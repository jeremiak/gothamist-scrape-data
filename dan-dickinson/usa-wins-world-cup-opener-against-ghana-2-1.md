</div></div>					<p>Heading into the 2014 World Cup, the United States were largely an unknown, a squad who strung together a series of underwhelming performances and seemed to lack the hype of previous US sides. Drawn into the &#x201C;group of death&#x201D; alongside world powerhouses Portugal and Germany, many pundits and observers alike suggested that the US would be hard pressed to win a game - or even score a goal.</p>

<p>It took precisely 33 seconds for the latter of those predictions to fall by the wayside. </p>

<p>Clint Dempsey scored a first minute stunner and John Anthony Brooks contributed an improbable 87th minute game-winner, enough to lead the US to a 2-1 win against group G competitor Ghana.</p>

<p>The opening goal was beautifully executed. Midfielder Jermaine Jones collected a throw-in on the left flank and fed a streaking Dempsey, who cut sharply around Ghanian defender John Boye at the top of the penalty area. The US captain struck a perfectly placed shot past goalkeeper Adam Larsen Kwarasey, pinging off the far post and into the back of the net. Dempsey&apos;s strike ranks as the fifth fastest in the history of the World Cup.</p>

<p>The USMNT looked sharp if not dangerous after their opener, moving the ball at ease through a shell-shocked Ghanian midfield. Ghana&#x2019;s best chance to equalize in the opening 45 came near the half-hour mark, when forward Asamoah Gyan galloped confidently around US midfielder Michael Bradley and struck a venomous shot towards goal from 20 yards out. US keeper Tim Howard was up to the task, parrying the strike over the end line.</p>

<p>Ghana opened the game up in the second half and nearly pulled level on a pair of chances centering around midfielder Sulley Muntari. In the 55th minute, Muntari struck a shot from 25 yards out that narrowly missed goal; just a minute later the midfielder played a beautiful ball in to Gyan, who headed the ball just inches wide of the target. Unexpectedly handed the responsibility of defending a lead, the US seemed content to sit back and defend under heavy pressure.</p>

<p>Ghana&#x2019;s equalizer was a long time coming, and they&#x2019;d get it in the 82nd minute. Gyan played a cheeky back heel in the area which was met by an onrushing Andre Ayew, who hammered the shot home to equalize the match.</p>

<p>Just five minutes later, the US would get their winner. Second half substitute Graham Zusi would swing a bending corner kick into the area - fellow substitute Brooks found himself perfectly positioned to power a thunderous header home, sending the estimated 20,000 US fans in attendance into delirium. Brooks&#x2019; winner was the first goal-ever-by a US substitute in any World Cup.</p>

<p>It wasn&#x2019;t all good news for the US. Jozy Altidore left the game in the 22nd minute with what looked like a fairly serious hamstring injury. He was joined by defender Matt Besler at halftime, who left the match with a similar ailment.  Clint Dempsey looked to have possibly broken his nose in the 34th minute, bloodied by a kick to the face. </p>

<p>Still, the result was better than many had expected: a dream start against a respectable foe. It also puts the US into a strong position to advance out of the group. The US will next face Portugal (Sunday June 22nd, 6PM ET), a squad short on confidence after a 4-0 drubbing at the hands of Germany that saw them lose defender Pepe to a red card and Fabio Coentrao to a hamstring injury. Should the US get a win, and Germany prevail over Ghana, the US would be through to the knockout round after just two matches.</p>
