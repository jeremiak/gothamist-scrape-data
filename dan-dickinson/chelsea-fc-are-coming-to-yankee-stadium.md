<p>Fresh off their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428112037/http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/17878435">2-1 victory over Liverpool</a> to clench the FA Cup, Chelsea FC <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428112037/http://www.chelseafc.com/page/LatestNews/0,,10268~2762724,00.html">today announced</a> they have added a stop in NYC to their summer US tour.  The Blues will face French Ligue 1 side Paris Saint-Germain on Sunday, July 22nd, in the first soccer match to be played at the new Yankee Stadium.</p>

<p>Chelsea have not played a friendly in New York City since 1954, when they played three games at Randalls Island and one in Harrison.  The team currently features the likes of Didier Drogba, Fernando Torres, Petr Cech, and Frank Lampard.  The 2011/12 season has been tumultuous for the West London side, with mixed results and locker room squabbles dooming new manager Andr&#xE9; Villas-Boas. After his firing in March, just nine months after taking the job, the team saw a resurgence under caretaker manager Roberto Di Matteo.  The team won their seventh FA Cup this past Saturday and toppled Barcelona to earn a place in the Champions League final on May 19th.</p>

<p>Paris Saint-Germain currently holds the most expensively assembled team in French soccer, spending a record &#x20AC;108 million in the transfer market this past season.  Adding a bit of spice to the matchup, PSG is currently managed by Carlo Ancelotti, who was unceremoniously sacked by Chelsea as their head manager the end of the 2010/11 season.</p>

<p>Tickets to the match will go on sale to the general public on May 16th; Yankees season ticket licensees will be able to take part in a special pre-sale before that date.  More information is available <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428112037/http://www.yankees.com/soccer">on the Yankees official site</a>.</p>
