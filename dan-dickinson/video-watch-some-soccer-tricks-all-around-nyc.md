<p>As our <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111232/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/21/photos_polar_vortex_2_is_snowing_up.php#photo-1">Polar Vortex 2</a> keeps its tight grip on us, even something as simple as a video of someone playing with a ball may remind us of happier, warmer times.  So when our friends at KickTV tipped us off to their latest video, in which Finnish goalkeeper <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111232/https://twitter.com/LassiHurskainen">Lassi Hurskainen</a> performs tricks all over Manhattan and Brooklyn, all we could think was &quot;That looks comparatively warm.&quot;</p>

<p>Besides getting in a trick contest with US midfielder <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111232/https://twitter.com/MixDiskerud">Mix Diskerud</a> at Pier 40, he dribbles around Times Square costumed performers, juggles with a stranger on the Bryant Park subway platform, and gives a police officer a yellow card.  Give it a watch&#x2014;you can pretend it counts as exercise before you go back to binge watching Netflix as you &quot;work from home&quot;.</p>
