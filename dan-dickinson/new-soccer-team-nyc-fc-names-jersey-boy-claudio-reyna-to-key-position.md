										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="2013_05_claudio.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504204104im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2013_05_claudio.jpg" width="640" height="384"> <br> <i> It&apos;s Claudio! (Via Major League Soccer)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>After yesterday&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504204104/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/21/major_league_soccer_makes_it_offici.php">&quot;transformative announcement&quot; that New York City FC</a> would join Major League Soccer in 2015, the full party was held today.  In a celebratory press conference today at PS 72, the team announced their first hire: Claudio Reyna as the Director of Football.</p>

<p>Reyna is a smart hire for the club, although not without a heavy heaping of irony, given that the team has emphasized going New York City. (Maybe they mean New York City metro area?)  A native of Livingston, <em>New Jersey</em>, the former US Men&apos;s National Team captain played for St. Benedict&apos;s (in <em>New Jersey</em>) before attending UVA.  Reyna spent most of his playing career in Europe: Bayer Leverkusen in Germany, Rangers in Scotland, and a long stint at Manchester City.  </p>

<p>When he finally returned home to Major League Soccer, he spent an injury-plagued year with the New York Red Bulls (who, we were helpfully reminded during the press conference, play in <em>New Jersey</em>) before retiring, taking a job as the US Soccer Youth Football Director in 2010.  Reyna is well liked and well respected by the global soccer community, and while he has no formal experience running a top-flight club, he should grow into the role quickly.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, reactions to yesterday&apos;s NYC FC announcement were plentiful.  Here&apos;s a sampling of some we received and read:</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504204104/http://www.newyorkredbulls.com/news/2013/05/red-bulls-release-statement-regarding-mls-expansion-announcement">New York Red Bulls&apos; General Manager Jerome de Bontin:</a></p>

<blockquote>&#x201C;We are supportive of MLS expansion, as it illustrates the growing interest of soccer in North America. We also want to congratulate MLS and the League&#x2019;s new ownership group, which is injecting additional resources to help develop our sport across the country. Today&#x2019;s announcement is one of many steps in the exciting and challenging process of building a competitive MLS club.

<p>Our club&#x2019;s energy is focused on winning a championship for the League&#x2019;s most loyal and passionate fans, many of whom have steadfastly backed this organization and MLS since its inception and come from all over the tri-state area. We are committed to continue to build an organization that is the flagship club for Major League Soccer around the world and a club that soccer fans across the region can be proud to support.&#x201D;</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504204104/http://www.soccerbyives.net/2013/05/petke-welcome-smashing.html">Red Bulls Coach Mike Petke</a>:</p>

<blockquote>It&#x2019;s good to have a true derby, a true rivalry. I think it&#x2019;s good for the league to grow and all that.  In the flip-side of that, we have a history here. They&#x2019;re the new guys coming in and I&#x2019;m looking forward to smashing them in 2015 to be honest with you...I don&#x2019;t have any love for (them just) because it&#x2019;s a new team in the league. I love this league, and I think expansion is (a good) thing, but now they&#x2019;ve come in where we are. We&#x2019;ll welcome them, hopefully, with a smashing the first time we see them.</blockquote>

<p>New York Cosmos COO Erik Stover:</p>

<blockquote>We&apos;ve known about Manchester City and Major League Soccer&#x2019;s plans for many months. We believe any investment in soccer in North America is great for the sport. We remain focused on our home opener on Aug. 3 and our plans to build a stadium at Belmont Park. As a storied New York club we welcome another rival in New York.</blockquote>

<p>The board of the Empire Supporters Club, the longest running MetroStars/Red Bulls supporters group:</p>

<blockquote>The Empire Supporters Club is surprised and frankly disappointed that Major League Soccer would choose to do business with Sheikh Mansour, the deputy prime minister and member of the ruling family of the United Arab Emirates, a nation where homosexuality is viewed as a crime punishable by death. After many years of good work done by the league to eradicate homophobia from the stands and the field, it seems like a massive step back to welcome homophobia to the owner&apos;s box, but it appears Major League Soccer will ignore its own &quot;Don&apos;t Cross the Line&quot; initiative if the price is right.

<p>The Empire Supporters Club has been around since well before NYCFC was even a concept, and we&apos;ll be here well after they&apos;re gone. First. Last. Forever.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<blockquote>We were here first. Did you hear that, NYCFC? We were here first, in Jersey, where we have basically owned the game of soccer since the first time a ball was kicked on these shores. So, even with your Manchester City and New York Yankee owners, you don&apos;t frighten us, not even a little.

<p>We welcome you to MLS, you and your five initials. You and your &quot;Football.&quot; You and your &quot;Club.&quot; You and what we&apos;re sure is going to be a bunch of splashy signings and, surely, hip celebrity fans. Welcome to the league.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504204104/http://espnfc.com/blog/_/name/soccerusa/id/2441?cc=5901">ESPN writer Jeff Carlisle</a>:</p>

<blockquote>It&apos;s not Sheikh Mansour&apos;s wealth that is problematic, especially now that MLS and NYC FC appear to be backing away from a proposal to build a 25,000-seat soccer stadium in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park. Rather, it&apos;s the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504204104/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/30/queens_soccer_stadium_critics_uae_s.php">human rights record in the UAE</a>. The U.S. State Department&apos;s 2012 Report on Human Rights Practices detailed how the country makes arbitrary arrests and criminalizes same-sex activity. </blockquote>

<p>Fairness Coalition of Queens:</p>

<blockquote>We welcome Major League Soccer to New York City. We are pleased with their new willingness to consider other sites in New York. The proposal for a stadium inside the heart of Flushing Meadows-Corona Park is deeply flawed and would irrevocably damage a vital community resource.

<p>We look forward to finding a more appropriate home for the team that does not sacrifice public parkland and that does not giveaway parkland to a documented human rights abuser. Lets make this a development that all New Yorkers can be excited about.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>New Yorkers for Parks:</p>

<blockquote>New Yorkers for Parks welcomes today&apos;s announcement and is particularly pleased that Major League Soccer and the New York City Football Club are open to exploring alternative sites for a stadium outside the heart of Flushing Meadows Corona Park - Queens&#x2019; most heavily used public space. We look forward to continuing to work with the Bloomberg Administration, MLS and the team to find a more appropriate location for NYCFC&apos;s permanent home.</blockquote>
