<p>With just over two weeks until the MLS preseason camps open, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428112215/http://gothamist.com/tags/redbulls">New York Red Bulls</a> have been relatively quiet on the transfer market, with more players heading out the door than coming in.</p>

<p>The big news out of London today is that striker Thierry Henry appears <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428112215/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/16361067.stm">&quot;certain&quot; to re-join Arsenal</a> on a two-month loan stint.  A deal has been rumored for much of the last month, but Gunners boss Arsene Wenger <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428112215/http://www.arsenal.com/news/news-archive/-we-must-show-respect-with-henry-deal-">spoke about the deal</a> at a media briefing this morning, indicating that only paperwork remained. The loan will see Henry return to the club where he made his name, and where a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428112215/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2072146/Arsenal-statues-unveiled-Thierry-Henry-tears.html">statue in his honor was recently unveiled</a> outside Emirates Stadium as part of the club&apos;s 125th anniversary celebration.  </p>

<p>If the agreement is reached, Titi&apos;s first match could be a third-round FA Cup match against Leeds, and he will likely feature in high profile matches against Manchester United as well as North London archrival Spurs.  While Arsenal fans worldwide are undoubtedly rejoicing at the news, New York fans will likely be hoping that the two months go by without the striker picking up an injury, as happened with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428112215/http://www.aolnews.com/2010/03/14/david-beckham-injured-in-ac-milan-win/">David Beckham&apos;s loan to AC Milan in 2010</a>.</p>

<p>In the English midlands, Bolton Wanderers are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428112215/http://www.thevipersnest.com/2011/12/is-tim-ream-bolton-bound.html">reportedly ready to make an offer</a> to sign NY defender Tim Ream to a contract.  Rumblings indicate the deal would be just north of 3 million dollars.  Bolton are struggling to escape the relegation zone this season and are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428112215/http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2011/dec/30/chelsea-sign-gary-cahill-bolton">losing center back Gary Cahill to Chelsea</a>.  Even with Ream&apos;s sophomore slump (which earned him the league&apos;s unofficial <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428112215/http://www.mlssoccer.com/bestof/2011/news/article/2011/12/29/best-2011-reams-giveaway-gaffe-year">&quot;Gaffe Of The Year&quot; award</a>), a move to Bolton could give him a chance to advance his game - but are the Red Bulls willing to let him go?</p>

<p>And what of beleagered Mexican captain Rafa Marquez, who caused waves by claiming his teammates &quot;weren&apos;t on his level&quot; mid-season?  Murmurs began almost as soon as NY fell out of the playoffs that he was unhappy in NYC, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428112215/http://www.empireofsoccer.com/rafa-marquez-on-espn-i-am-open-to-any-offers-that-are-worth-it/">recently told ESPN Deportes</a> &quot;I am open to any offer that is worth it.&quot;.  He has been linked to both <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428112215/http://www.mlssoccer.com/news/article/2011/11/07/atlas-rumors-swirl-m%C3%A1rquez-not-ruling-out-anything">his boyhood team Club Atlas</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428112215/http://www.goal.com/en-us/news/69/transfer-zone/2011/12/14/2802730/flamengo-targets-new-york-red-bulls-defender-rafa-marquez">Brazilian club Flamengo</a> as a transfer target, but  RBNY Sporting Director Erik Soler <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428112215/http://www.nypost.com/p/blogs/soccerblog/red_bull_gm_erik_soler_talks_offseason_m72xuHdzaMbaXAQrYCxGDL">continues to assert</a> that everything is copacetic: &quot;I had a long chat with Rafa; he&apos;s not going anywhere, or asked to go anywhere. He&apos;s coming back to start the season on Jan. 16.&quot;</p>

<p>Soler has mostly been busy swinging the axe in December, releasing a total of eleven players across multiple moves and drafts.  Veteran defender Carlos Mendes <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428112215/http://www.thecrew.com/news/2011/12/mendes-excited-opportunity-competitive-crew">went to Columbus in the Re-Entry Draft</a>, while Chris Albright and Bouna Coundoul were not picked up by other teams.  Six reserve players, include John &quot;Best Rooney Ever&quot; Rooney, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428112215/http://www.socceramerica.com/article/44778/john-rooney-among-31-players-waived.html">were waived</a> following the end of the season.  Stephane Auvray, who joined the team in August from Kansas City, did not have his option picked up, and backup goalkeeper Greg Sutton <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428112215/http://www.mlssoccer.com/news/article/2011/12/09/sutton-brings-expansion-experience-impact-2012">formally moved</a> to expansion side Montreal Impact, where he was already on loan.</p>

<p>The only inbound player has been St. Johns defender and Red Bull Academy product <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428112215/http://www.newyorkredbulls.com/news/2011/12/red-bulls-sign-home-grown-defender-connor-lade">Connor Lade</a>, who has the odd distinction of being a defender while also only being 5&apos;6&quot;.  Team stalwart Joel Lindpere has also had his option picked up, even though he too is reportedly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428112215/http://fotball.itromso.no/england/article217415.ece">receiving interest from Europe</a>.</p>

<p>With only twenty players listed on the roster, New York&apos;s front office has a lot of work to do in the upcoming transfer window.  The Red Bulls 2012 campaign begins on March 11th away against FC Dallas.  The home opener will be on March 25th against an opponent to be named.</p>
