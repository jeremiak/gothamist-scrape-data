<p>Saturday&apos;s World Cup action saw the dangers of scoring too early, Costa Rica upsetting Uruguay, a drone scandal, and a broken ankle.</p>

<p><em>Last Night&apos;s Action</em></p>

<p><strong>Colombia 3, Greece 0:</strong> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111026/http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/videos/highlights/match=300186471/index.html">HIGHLIGHTS</a>) The least shocking of Saturday&apos;s results, Colombia lived up to expectations as they dismantled the Greeks. A deflected Pablo Armero goal after just five minutes would&apos;ve been enough to seal the result, but Teofilo Gutierrez and James Rodriguez added goals in the second half to run up the scoreline. Juan Cuadrado provided two assists.</p>

<p><strong>Uruguay 1, Costa Rica 3:</strong> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111026/http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/videos/highlights/match=300186489/index.html">HIGHLIGHTS</a>) We said yesterday Costa Rica was long odds, but they managed to pull off a huge upset and change expectations in Group C. Uruguay went up on a first half penalty kick by Edinson Cavani, but a second half rally with two goals inside of four minutes saw the plucky Ticos go top of the group. Uruguay&apos;s Maximiliano Pereira earned the dubious honor of the first red card of this year&apos;s tournament.</p>

<p><strong>England 1, Italy 2:</strong> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111026/http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/videos/highlights/match=300186513/index.html">HIGHLIGHTS</a>) A good back-and-forth match, but no shocks as England again can&apos;t live up to expectations. A beautiful long range goal from Claudio Marchisio gave first blood to the Italians, but Daniel Sturridge found an equalizer almost immediately to level the score. Mario Balotelli (why always him?) headed home the game winner in the 50th minute. It&apos;s not that England looked particularly bad, but as they like to say, they just weren&apos;t good enough on the day. Expect all your English fans to be wringing their hands despondently over brunch this morning.</p>

<p><strong>Ivory Coast 2, Japan 1:</strong> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111026/http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/videos/highlights/match=300186507/index.html">HIGHLIGHTS</a>) You may detect a pattern here: Japan gets the early goal, but Ivory Coast battles back to earn the victory. (The lesson of the World Cup so far is &quot;maybe don&apos;t score first&quot;.) Keisuke Honda scored an excellent left footed goal for Japan&apos;s opener, but <em>Les Elephants</em> roared back in the second half, with Serge Aurier providing two identical crosses to set up two headed goals inside of two minutes.</p>

<p><em>The Play To Watch</em></p>

<p>Italy&apos;s opening goal is notable for two things: a picture perfect dummy from Andrea Pirlo, and a 24-yard shot rifled through four English players and goalkeeper Joe Hart by Claudio Marchisio.</p>

<p><em>Today&apos;s Matches</em></p>

<p><strong>Switzerland vs. Ecuador</strong> (12PM ET, ABC) Switzerland remains a bit of an enigma. Despite not being known as a soccer powerhouse, they have a youthful, talented group with a lot of dual-nationals, and have only lost one in their last eighteen international matches. For Ecuador, that record is flipped: only one win in their last seven.</p>

<p><strong>France vs. Honduras</strong> (3PM ET, ABC) France will be doing everything they can to put the memories of 2010 behind them. But any attempts by <em>Les Bleus</em> to play flowing attacking football will run into Honduras&apos; tendency to play gritty, physical soccer. Count on this one to get scrappy.</p>

<p><strong>Argentina vs. Bosnia-Herzegovina</strong> (6PM ET, ESPN) Yes, it&apos;s your first chance to see if Leo Messi can finally live up to expectations to perform on the biggest stage. But it&apos;s also the first World Cup appearance for Bosnia-Herzegovina since gaining independence from Yugoslavia. Argentina are certainly the favorites, but don&apos;t count the debutants (which includes the excellent Edin Dzeko) out.</p>

<p><em>What Else Is Going On?</em></p>

<p>The referee for Ghana-USA <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111026/http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/news/y=2014/m=6/news=referee-designations-for-matches-12-14-2370909.html">was announced Saturday</a>. 40-year-old Swedish referee Jonas Eriksson will handle the match duties on Monday in Natal, where <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111026/http://msn.foxsports.com/soccer/story/team-usa-frets-over-ghana-match-as-rain-threatens-world-cup-plans-061414">it&apos;s been pouring since Friday</a>. We&apos;ll have a full preview of USA vs. Ghana later today.</p>

<p>Physio, heal thyself. Gary Lewin, England&apos;s physiotherapist, got so excited during England&apos;s equalizing goal that he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111026/http://www.espnfc.us/england/story/1882455/physio-gary-lewin-back-to-england-after-breaking-ankle">fractured and dislocated his ankle celebrating</a>. He had to be stretchered off the field and is now returning to England.</p>

<p>In local soccer, it may be time to paint NYC green. In the first ever meeting between the Cosmos and the Red Bulls in the US Open Cup, it was complete dominance by the Cosmos. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111026/http://www.empireofsoccer.com/cosmos-bulls-advance-26613/">3-0 blowout victory</a> gives them full bragging rights over their cross-city-two-rivers-and-a-state-line neighbors. Cosmos fans will either travel to Philadelphia or host Harrisburg in the fifth round; for Red Bulls fans, it&apos;s time for a heavy sigh, an indifferent shrug, and yet another stiff drink.</p>
