<p>It&apos;s a World Cup year, and soccer fever will again sweep the city this summer&#x2014;and with soccer fever comes soccer friendlies.  With a slate of both club friendlies and international tune-ups announced, here&apos;s what you can look forward to around the NYC area this summer.</p>

<p><strong>NEW YORK RED BULLS VS. ARSENAL</strong></p>

<p>Just announced Thursday morning, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111205/http://www.newyorkredbulls.com/news/2014/03/new-york-red-bulls-host-english-club-arsenal-fc-july-26-red-bull-arena">New York Red Bulls will host Arsenal F.C.</a>, one of the most storied clubs in England, on July 26th.  While many English sites routinely tour America every summer, it will be Arsenal&apos;s first trip to the US since 1989.  It will also be Arsenal&apos;s only stop on this side of the Atlantic, so Arsenal fans from across the country are already making travel plans.</p>

<p>Thierry Henry, who has played for the Red Bulls since 2010 and is Arsenal&apos;s all-time leading scorer (he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111205/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2072146/Arsenal-statues-unveiled-Thierry-Henry-tears.html">even has a statue</a> outside their stadium), is clearly excited: &quot;It goes without saying that hosting Arsenal at Red Bull Arena will be a special moment for me both on a professional and personal level. As I have said before, the club is in my heart and this will be another terrific chapter in my relationship with Arsenal Football Club. Along with my teammates, I am excited to host Arsenal in New York - one of the greatest cities in the world - and hope that Red Bulls and Arsenal fans will be able to enjoy the match.&quot;  (No word on if Henry will switch jerseys at halftime, Pele-style, and play for both teams.)</p>

<p>For the time being, tickets are only available to Red Bulls season ticket holders, who get one ticket in their plans and a pre-sale opportunity in the coming days.  General public ticket details will be released at a future date.</p>

<p><strong>INTERNATIONAL CHAMPIONS CUP RETURNS</strong></p>

<p>The International Champions Cup - a tournament of friendlies with eight European clubs - returns to the NYC area for the second straight year, bringing two matches.  Italian side AC Milan will take on the current Greek Superleague champions Olympiakos at Citi Field on July 24th.  A clash between Manchester City and Liverpool, both currently battling for the English Premier League title, will be at Yankee Stadium on July 30th.  Tickets for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111205/http://internationalchampionscup.com/schedule/sch/">both matches are available</a>.</p>

<p><strong>US MEN VS. TURKEY</strong></p>

<p>As part of the &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111205/http://www.ussoccer.com/news/mens-national-team/2014/03/140306-mnt-sendoff-series.aspx">Send-Off Series</a>&quot; before the 2014 World Cup, the US Men&apos;s National Team will play a tune-up against Turkey at Red Bull Arena on Sunday, June 1st.  Other matches in the series include Azerbaijan in San Francisco, and Nigeria in Jacksonville.  Ticket details are not yet available for the match, but should be within the next few weeks.  With the complete US World Cup squad playing less than two weeks before they head to Brazil, it may be your best chance to see Jurgen Klinsmann&apos;s squad without a ticket to South America.</p>
