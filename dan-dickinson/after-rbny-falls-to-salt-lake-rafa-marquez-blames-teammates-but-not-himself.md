<p>With only five games left to play, the New York Red Bulls&apos; post-season dreams are looking shaky.</p>

<p>With an almost fully healthy starting eleven, and coming off a tight 1-0 victory away at Dallas last week, the Harrison side looked ready to provide a strong challenge as they hosted Real Salt Lake Wednesday night.  But within 20 minutes, the Harrison side found themselves down three goals.  Alvaro Saborio went unmarked on a corner to start the scoring in the 9th minute, RBNY defender Tim Ream gifted Fabian Espindola just two minutes later, and Espindola struck again in the 21st minute.  A second half found the Red Bulls dominating the attack, but Salt Lake&apos;s strong back line only allowed NY one goal, as Joel Lindpere converted a scissor kick for his 7th of the season.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428112245/http://www.newyorkredbulls.com/news/2011/09/recap-rsl-down-red-bulls-3-1">3-1 defeat drops the Red Bulls to 7-7-15</a>, and are now a single point outside of the last wildcard spot behind the Portland Timbers, who will visit Red Bull Arena this Saturday night.</p>

<p>If a 3-1 rout wasn&apos;t bad enough, beleaguered coach Hans Backe now has to deal with potential lockerroom drama.  Defender Rafa Marquez <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428112245/http://www.nydailynews.com/blogs/the_beautiful_blog/2011/09/red-bulls-rafa-marquez-goes-after-teammates-says-theyre-not-on-his-level">told the media after the game</a> <strong>&quot;I think this is a team game and unfortunately there isn&apos;t an equal level between my teammates and I</strong>.&quot;  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428112245/http://espn.go.com/sports/soccer/news/_/columnist/carlisle_jeff/id/6999453/mls-ny-red-bulls-consider-dropping-rafa-marquez-jeff-carlisle-soccer">Ongoing criticism</a> of Marquez&apos;s performances has heated up over recent weeks, and with NY fans booing his every touch last night, his comments are surely not going to win him additional fans.</p>
