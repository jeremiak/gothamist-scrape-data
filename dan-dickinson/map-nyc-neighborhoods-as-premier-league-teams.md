<p>The best/worst part about soccer is that, as a global sport, it NEVER ends.  The Premier League is kicking off against next weekend, and our own Tien Mao <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429064824/https://twitter.com/tienmao/status/365842237151645698">spotted the above ad</a> from NBC Sports, urging all passersby to &quot;Keep Calm and Pick A Side&quot;.  They divided up a map of NYC into the twenty <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429064824/http://www.premierleague.com/en-gb.html">Premier League</a> sides, but made some pretty strange neighborhood-team associations.</p>

<p>Let&apos;s start with the Manchester clubs: Manchester United as the Upper East Side, while &quot;noisy neighbors&quot; Manchester City as Midtown/Times Square. Yet &quot;Citeh&quot; are the ones with all the abundant spending&#x2014;and United are the team where all the people who want to be at the center of the universe flock to.  United should be Times Square instead, no question.</p>

<p>On to the big London clubs. First, shame on NBC Sports for missing the very obvious connection of putting Chelsea FC in Chelsea, possibly a bigger miss than <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429064824/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11AtDY3PIAw">anything Fernando Torres has managed</a>.  Instead, they&apos;re down in Battery Park and the Financial District&#x2014;which makes sense for the outlandish spending, if nothing else.  But bitter rivals Arsenal in the West Village and Spurs in the East Village?  We&apos;re talking years of antagonism and hatred.  There&apos;s only one place in NYC they should be: Queens and Brooklyn.</p>

<p>We could go on.  Storied, globally supported Liverpool as the pricy Upper West Side?  The only place you&apos;ll never walk alone is Fairway.  With them being less than a mile from their rival Everton, move both of them down to the Village instead.  Industrial, chip-on-their-shoulder West Ham as a tiny slice of Turtle Bay? They should be be the Bronx, not Sunderland.</p>

<p>We will concede one assignment as being perfect, though: Staten Island as Newcastle, solely on the Jersey Shore-<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429064824/http://www.mtv.co.uk/shows/geordie-shore">Geordie Shore</a> connection.</p>
