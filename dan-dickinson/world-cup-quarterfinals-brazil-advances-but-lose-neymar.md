<p>Friday&apos;s World Cup action brought us Germany dispatching France, Brazil paying a heavy price as they edged past Colombia, movie deals, and giant insects.</p>

<p><em>Last Night&apos;s Action</em></p>

<p><strong>France 0, Germany 1</strong> A strangely uneventful game. Mats Hummels scored the only goal of the match, heading home a free kick in the 12th minute. Germany was content to play defensively, and France played with surprisingly little urgency, making what could&apos;ve been a classic rather dull. The result makes Germany the first country to appear in four straight World Cup semi-final rounds.</p>

<p><strong>Brazil 2, Colombia 1</strong> Yes, the hosts won - Thiago Silva pounced on a corner kick to open the scoring early, and David Luiz would score a beautiful free kick from 35 yards - but the real story here is the injury to Neymar. The Brazillian superstar took a jumping knee in the back from Juan Zuniga, breaking a vertebra and ruling him out for the remainder of the tournament. James Rodriguez scored a penalty to get Colombia back into the game ten minutes from the end of regulation, but Los Cafeteros could not find an equalizer.</p>

<p><em>The Play To Watch</em></p>

<p>David Luiz&apos;s free kick was a swerving beauty:</p>

<p>And his celebration wasn&apos;t bad either:</p>

<p><em>Today&apos;s Matches</em></p>

<p><strong>Argentina vs. Belgium</strong> (12PM ET, ABC) Everyone is now clear on Belgium being quite good. Conversely, Argentina have Leo Messi, who&apos;s occasionally moments of brilliance have carried La Albiceleste through the tournament so far. The question on everyone&apos;s lips: can Messi do it again and bring his country to their first semi-finals since 1990? Or will Belgium live up to their dark horse billing and force their way to the final four?</p>

<p><strong>Netherlands vs. Costa Rica</strong> (4PM ET, ESPN) Costa Rica, as the last remaining country from CONCACAF alive in the tournament, will have a true test for their fairy tale dreams with the Netherlands. The Dutch are stacked with talent, but as Italy, England, and Uruguay learned, thinking Los Ticos will be a cakewalk is foolish. </p>

<p>Liverpool is reportedly interested in US defender DeAndre Yedlin, and have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428110852/http://metro.co.uk/2014/07/04/liverpool-step-up-interest-in-seattle-sounders-defender-deandre-yedlin-4787470/">invited him for a pre-season trial</a>.</p>

<p>Ghana&apos;s drama-filled disaster of a World Cup campaign will be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428110852/http://www.thewrap.com/ghanas-world-cup-story-inspires-soccer-themed-thriller-wall-pass/">turned into a movie</a>.</p>

<p>Lastly: James Rodriguez was so happy to score for Colombia, he didn&apos;t notice that a giant bug had hitched a ride on his jersey:</p>
