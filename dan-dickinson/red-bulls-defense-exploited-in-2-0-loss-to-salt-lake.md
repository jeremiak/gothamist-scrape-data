<p>Expectations were low as the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428112132/http://gothamist.com/tags/redbulls">New York Red Bulls</a> traveled to battle Real Salt Lake on Saturday night.  Thierry Henry called the Utah side &quot;the best team in the league by a distance&quot;.  New York had been unable to win&#x2014;or even score a single goal&#x2014;at Rio Tinto Stadium since 2008.  And their fortunes would not change in 2012, as two more defensive mistakes culminated in a 2-0 defeat.</p>

<p>With Juan Agudelo away with the U-23 Olympic Qualifying team, many expected to see Kenny Cooper paired at forward with Thierry Henry.  Coach Hans Backe decided to focus instead on defense in hopes of containing RSL, experimenting with a 4-5-1 formation instead of the traditional 4-4-2 form.  Henry was used as a lone striker, with Victor Palsson being added to the midfield.  Salt Lake started the same starting XI they used in their 3-1 victory over LA Galaxy the week before.</p>

<p>The teams battled back and and forth for the first 30 minutes, but New York&apos;s defensive focus started to show holes as the back line continued to track forward to try and create attacks.  In the 39th minute, Roy Miller kept Fabian Espindola onside with no defenders near him.  He streaked up the wing and nutmegged Ryan Meara for RSL&apos;s first goal.</p>

<p>Having failed to contain RSL in the first half, Backe reverted to a 4-4-2, with Kenny Cooper replacing Palsson.  Mehdi Ballouchy replaced Teemu Tainio, who picked up a right ankle contusion early in the first half.  The changes succeeding in bringing more offense, but did nothing to shore up the defense, and Salt Lake would strike again in the 58th minute.  This time, Sebastian Velasquez  was left alone in the box, who fed the ball to an unmarked Espindola. His blast was stopped by Meara, but the ball fell to Luis Gil, who quickly slammed it into the back of the net as defenders looked on to make it 2-0.</p>

<p>Hans Backe tried to find positives after the game in conversation with the MSG broadcast team, stating &quot;We played our best game by far in two years against Salt Lake, so it&apos;s very frustrating to go down 2-0.&quot;  With Rafa Marquez coming off of suspension and Wilman Conde potentially returning from injury, Backe will hope to snap a four game losing streak in the home opener next weekend against Colorado.</p>
