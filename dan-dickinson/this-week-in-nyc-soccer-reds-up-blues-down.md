<p>This week: Red Bulls keep rolling on the road, NYCFC suffers a historic first loss, and SKC fans think jokes about burning NYC to the ground are timely.</p>

<p><strong>RED BULLS KNOCK OFF COLUMBUS CREW 2-1 ON THE ROAD</strong></p>

<p>Marsch Madness continues! The Red Bulls took their new style on the road and came up big, earning a 2-1 road win against Columbus.</p>

<p>The teams traded goals in the second half, with Bradley Wright-Phillips converting a penalty before former Red Bull Tony Tchani slammed home an equalizer on a corner. The unlikely hero was Mike &quot;Macklemore&quot; Grella, who minutes after subbing in, lobbed home an audacious chip from distance:</p>

<p>Grella&apos;s goal did more than just earn the win: it was the 1,000th goal across all competitions in MetroStars/Red Bull history.</p>

<p>&quot;I think that it&#x2019;s important to continue to validate how we&#x2019;re doing and what we&#x2019;re doing,&quot; said head coach Jesse Marsch after the match. &quot;It&#x2019;s not just the win, but it&#x2019;s how we played; I think that&#x2019;s what&#x2019;s important. It&#x2019;s that we continue to try and move ourselves along and honor the process and keep pushing, and we&#x2019;re being rewarded for it right now. But right now it&#x2019;s still key though to keep our heads and keep pushing everyday.&quot;</p>

<p>It&apos;s only the third time in club history the team has taken seven points from their opening three games. The win has them sitting undefeated on top of the Eastern Conference. That really doesn&apos;t mean much this early in the season, but for a team that had been so uniformly written off, is worth noting.</p>

<p>The Red Bulls have another bye week this coming weekend, before making their only trip of the season down to RFK to try and take more points off DC United (4/11, 7:00 PM, MSG2).</p>

<p><strong>NYCFC SUFFER FIRST EVER DEFEAT TO KANSAS CITY</strong></p>

<p>In the Bronx, the party atmosphere took a slight hit as NYCFC took a 1-0 loss at the hands of Sporting Kansas City in front of a sold-out crowd.</p>

<p>Jason Kreis was forced to shuffle the lineup heavily, with injuries, international call-ups, and suspensions removing a number of expected starters from the available pool. The team as a whole played well, but Kansas City exploited the narrow field at Yankee Stadium, bombing in a long throw to the head of Ike Opara who scored the only goal of the match.</p>

<p>(Fun fact: Ike Opara is now the first MLS player to score on both NY clubs in a single season.)</p>

<p>NYCFC out-possessed, out-passed, and outshot SKC, but an equalizing goal would not come. It briefly appeared the club had earned a penalty kick in the second half, but referee Edvin Jurisevic reversed the call after conferring with his linesman, and instead played a drop ball in the penalty area.</p>

<p>Defender Jason Hernandez thought the team deserved at least a point, but acknowledges that&apos;s not how the game works. &quot;The game is cruel, the game is misleading. I thought the effort tonight deserved something.&#x201D;</p>

<p>The traveling Sporting Kansas City fans had a message for NYCFC after the loss, which in the aftermath of the 2nd Avenue fire...TOO SOON. WAY TOO SOON.</p>
