										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="2013_06_bronxyankee.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111154im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2013_06_bronxyankee.jpg" width="640" height="426"> <br> <i> Yankee Stadium during a friendly last summer. (AP)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>File this under &quot;no surprise&quot;: The NY Times <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111154/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/15/sports/soccer/new-york-city-fc-to-play-at-yankee-stadium-for-three-years.html">reported Monday night</a> that forthcoming soccer team <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111154/http://gothamist.com/tags/nycfc">New York City FC</a> will spend the first three years of their MLS existence playing in Yankee Stadium. A formal announcement from the team is expected next week.</p>

<p>The news won&apos;t surprise those who have even been partially aware of the team&apos;s plans&#x2014;at this point, where else could they go? The team&apos;s central pitch was that the team would play inside the five boroughs, so rumors of a temporary stadium in Westchester seemed out of the question, as is the occasional suggestion that they share Red Bull Arena in Harrison, New Jersey.  Within the five boroughs, there aren&apos;t a lot of venues that would support a soccer field, so Yankee Stadium (remember, the Yankees are minority owners of NYC FC) easily wins by default.</p>

<p>Don&apos;t worry, sports fans&#x2014;there&apos;s <em>plenty</em> to grumble about. Yankees fans can look forward to the field undergoing the conversion to and from a soccer venue at least 17 times each season, and additional wear and tear on the outfield. NYC FC fans can look forward to questionable sight lines, an extremely narrow field, and that empty feeling of being a stadium tenant (just ask the New England Revolution fans <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111154/http://www.bostonmagazine.com/news/article/2014/03/25/bob-kraft-worst-owner-new-england-revolution/">how that feels</a>). And everyone can look forward to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111154/http://deadspin.com/mike-francesa-really-could-not-give-less-of-a-shit-abou-509330285">more soccer ranting</a> from Mike Francesa!</p>

<p>What&apos;s more worrying is that almost two years have passed since <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111154/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/27/mls_stadium_proposal_flushing_meadows.php">the first rumblings</a> regarding a soccer stadium in the five boroughs.  &quot;MLS To Queens&quot; has come and gone, and a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111154/http://gothamist.com/2013/12/11/this_week_in_soccer_a_chat_with_rbn.php">Bronx stadium may still be in the works</a> if <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111154/http://gothamist.com/2013/12/12/de_blasio_soccer_stadium.php">de Blasio can be convinced</a>. But as we approach the one year anniversary of the NYC FC announcement, there&apos;s still no permanent location named, no land acquisition deal reached, and no shovels in the ground.</p>

<p>NYC FC are expected to start playing in the 2015 MLS season, which begins next March. No word yet on whether or not there will be a soccer ball version of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111154/http://gothamist.com/2014/04/14/yankees_nacho_helmet.php">$20 nacho helmets</a>.</p>
