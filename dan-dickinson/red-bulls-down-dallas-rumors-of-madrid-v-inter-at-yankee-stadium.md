(New York Red Bulls)</i></div><p></p>

<p>After a week of training in Mexico, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428112159/http://gothamist.com/tags/redbulls">New York Red Bulls</a> held their first pre-season match of 2012 against FC Dallas on Tuesday.  Despite missing strikers Thierry Henry (loan), Luke Rodgers (visa), and Juan Agudelo (injury), the Bulls <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428112159/http://www.newyorkredbulls.com/news/2012/02/red-bulls-top-fc-dallas-preseason-opener-2-0">came away with a sound 2-0 victory</a> in Cancun.</p>

<p>The first half saw both teams play nearly full-strength lineups, with the recently signed Ryan Meara starting at goalkeeper for New York.  New York struck first in the 33rd minute, as Kenny Cooper knocked a Dane Richards pass into the far post.  The second half brought on a full change for both teams, and Corey Hertzog converted a penalty kick in the dying minutes to seal the victory.  Dallas was unable to finish any of their chances, striking the woodwork three times over the course of the match.</p>

<p>The match did not feature Colombian defender Wilman Conde, who the team acquired on January 30th and who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428112159/http://www.newyorkredbulls.com/blog/post/2012/02/06/mexico-day-8-wilman-conde-joins-team">arrived in camp late on Sunday</a>.  Conde&apos;s rights were acquired from the Chicago Fire, where he was named to the MLS Best XI in 2009.  GM Erik Soler rates Conde highly, describing him as &quot;strong, physical and experienced and he will be a tremendous addition to our club.&quot;</p>

<p>Supporters also breathed a sigh of relief last week as the team announced that it had signed 2010 team MVP Joel Lindpere to a new multi-year contract.  Lindpere had reportedly been eyeing a move to Europe, but appears happy to be staying put.  The Estonian midfielder had seven goals and seven assists in the 2011 season, setting club records in games (34) and minutes (3,048) played.</p>

<p>In London, Thierry Henry notched the final goal in Arsenal&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428112159/http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/16779019">7-1 romp</a> over Blackburn Rovers.  While Henry is scheduled to rejoin the team mid-February, Gunners boss Arsene Wenger hinted that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428112159/http://espn.go.com/sports/soccer/story/_/id/7540265/arsenal-try-extend-thierry-henry-major-league-soccer-loan">he may try to extend the loan</a> for an additional two weeks.</p>

<p>Finally, soccer may return to Yankee Stadium for the first time since 1976 this summer.  Michael Lewis of Big Apple Soccer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428112159/http://www.bigapplesoccer.com/article.php?article_id=29723">broke the story</a> that organizers are negotiating a potentially massive friendly in the Bronx between Real Madrid and Inter Milan.</p>
