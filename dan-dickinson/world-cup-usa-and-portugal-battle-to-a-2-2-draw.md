<p>In a tournament full of shock finishes and amazing goals, the US National Team and Portgual fought to a riveting 2-2 finish, with Portugal sealing the draw on the last attack of the match. Jermaine Jones and Clint Dempsey scored for the USMNT.</p>

<p>It all got off to a nightmare start for the USA, as Portugal were given a gift of a goal just five minutes in. Geoff Cameron&apos;s attempt to clear the ball out of the penalty area was mishead, slicing right into the path of Nani. Nani was able to slide the ball forward, and roofed the ball over Tim Howard with the very first shot of the match.</p>

<p>The USA had more of the attack in the first half, almost a flip from the Ghana game. But their attacks were wasteful, largely coming from outside the box and heading wide. Michael Bradley nearly had an equalizer in the 56th minute, sending hearts into mouths across the nation. A cross caught goalkeeper Beto out, but Bradley put the ball right at Ricardo Costa for an easy goal-line clearance.</p>

<p>Still, the US pressed on, and their pressure was rewarded with a beautiful equalizer from Jermaine Jones in the 64th minute. Not unlike Leo Messi&apos;s goal over Iran, Jones blasted a far post shot from nearly 30 yards out, leaving Beto rooted so that he could only watch it fly by him.</p>

<p>The US continued to press, and in the 81st minute, the US found the lead thanks to Clint Dempsey. After the ball pinged around inside Portugal&apos;s penalty area, Graham Zusi played a cross back to Dempsey, who was just a hair onside. Dempsey played the ball off his abs into the net past Beto for his second of the tournament, and the goal that looked like it would send the US through and knock Portugal out of the tournament.</p>

<p>But on the last play of the game, it would be Cristiano Ronaldo who kept Portugal&apos;s hopes alive, with a perfect cross to the head of Silvestre Varela, who headed the ball home from close range to end the match 2-2.</p>

<p>The US will face Germany on Thursday at noon Eastern, a match that occurs simultaneously as Portugal takes on Ghana. A Portugal-Ghana tie would guarantee the US passage regardless of the result against Germany. If there&apos;s a winner in that match, the US will either need a point, or for the victor to not pass them on goal differential.</p>
