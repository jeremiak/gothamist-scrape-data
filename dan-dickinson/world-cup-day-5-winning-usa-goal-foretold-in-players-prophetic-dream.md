<p>Monday&apos;s World Cup round brought us German firepower, Portuguese self-destruction, the first draw of the tournament, Joe Biden, and a premonition about a goal.</p>

<p><em>Last Night&apos;s Action</em></p>

<p><strong>Germany 4, Portugal 0</strong> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111001/http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/videos/highlights/match=300186475/index.html">HIGHLIGHTS</a>) Germany looked fantastic, surprising basically no one. Not only did their attack thrive with a Thomas M&#xFC;ller hat trick, but Manuel Neuer made nine saves to deny Portugal any consolation goal. Portugal suffered from injuries both self-inflected and otherwise: Pepe played his typical villain role, earning a red card for a head but, while Joao Moutinho left the game with a hamstring strain.</p>

<p><strong>Nigeria 0, Iran 0</strong> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111001/http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/videos/highlights/match=300186505/index.html">HIGHLIGHTS</a>) The tournament had gone 12 matches without a draw, let alone a scoreless one, but Nigeria and Iran ended that streak with a stalemate. Nigeria looked the better side but failed to convert any of their chances.</p>

<p><strong>Ghana 1, USA 2</strong> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111001/http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/videos/highlights/match=300186512/index.html">HIGHLIGHTS</a>) Have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111001/http://gothamist.com/2014/06/16/usa_wins_world_cup_opener_against_g.php">we mentioned that the US won</a>? The victory was the first ever over Ghana, who knocked the US out of the previous two World Cups.</p>

<p><em>The Play To Watch</em></p>

<p>John Anthony Brooks, take a bow. The 21-year-old got on the end for a Graham Zusi free kick for a snap-down header that would win the game.</p>

<p>Brooks hardly knew what to do after he scored, and opted for a celebration that involved going to his safe place:</p>

<p><em>Today&apos;s Matches</em></p>

<p><strong>Belgium vs Algeria</strong> (12PM ET, ESPN) Belgium&apos;s respectable attacking talents will try to break down a defensive Algeria side that hasn&apos;t won a World Cup match since 1982.</p>

<p><strong>Mexico vs Brazil</strong> (3PM ET, ESPN) The hosts get their second match of the group stage, hosting a Mexican side that clicked well against Cameroon. Brazil remains the favorites, but do El Tri have it in them to upset Brazil in front of a home crowd?</p>

<p><strong>Russia vs South Korea</strong> (6PM, ESPN) One more toss-up from Group H, as the final two teams get their first matches in. Expect Russia to try to work the ball up the middle, while Korea tries to exploit Russia&apos;s weaknesses out wide.</p>

<p><em>What Else Is Going On?</em></p>

<p>Reaction videos to John Brooks&apos;s late winner have been flooding in; The Guardian has a fine roundup. We&apos;re also partial to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111001/http://cartodb.com/v/worldcup/match/?vis=59670c48-f5ab-11e3-a176-0e230854a1cb&amp;h=t&amp;t=USA,5CA2D1%7CGhana,F84F40&amp;m=6%2F16%2F2014%2019:00:00%20GMT,6%2F16%2F2014%2021:58:00GMT&amp;g=1,94%7C90#/3/35.53/-87.19/0">visualization of Twitter activity</a> during the game.</p>

<p>Brooks told reporters <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111001/http://soccer.si.com/soccer/planet-futbol/2014/06/16/john-brooks-usa-world-cup-ghana-winning-goal-dream">he had a dream</a> that he would score in the 80th minute. </p>

<p>Mario Balotelli&apos;s Panini page for Italy is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111001/http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jun/16/mario-balotelli-panini-italy-facebook-world-cup">about as awesome</a> as you might expect.</p>

<p>Veep in the house! Joe Biden was on hand for the game in Natal and visited the locker room after the game:</p>
