<p>It&apos;s going to be a busy summer for soccer. AC Milan director Umberto Gandini <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428112013/http://twitter.com/#!/UmbertoGandini/status/205249212198305792">broke news on Twitter today</a> that the storied Italian club will face Real Madrid in a friendly match at Yankee Stadium on August 8th.</p>

<p>The two clubs need barely an introduction to anyone who follows soccer.  Milan holds 18 domestic league and 7 Champions League titles.  Real Madrid are no slouch, holding 32 La Liga titles (including the just completed 2011-12 season) and 9 Champions League titles.  Milan brings talents like Zlatan Ibrahimovic (who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428112013/http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/i-am-zlatan/id499373930?mt=8">has his own biography iPad app</a>!) and Robinho, while Madrid is home to superstars like Cristiano Ronaldo and Iker Casillas.  (We can only hope that NYC will be treated to Ronaldo <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428112013/http://www.balls.ie/2012/04/12/ronaldo-praises-his-thigh-again-after-golazo/">pointing to his thigh</a>.)</p>

<p>The match will be the second at Yankee Stadium this summer, following the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428112013/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/07/chelsea_fc_are_coming_to_yankee_sta.php">Chelsea v PSG match</a> on July 22nd.  Red Bull Arena is hosting two international match-ups as well: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428112013/http://www.newyorkredbulls.com/news/2012/03/new-york-host-tottenham-hotspur-inaugural-new-york-invitational-cup-july-31">RBNY and Tottenham Hotspur</a> square off in a friendly on July 31st, while the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428112013/http://www.newyorkredbulls.com/news/2012/04/trophee-des-champions-be-played-united-states-first-time-history-red-bull-arena-saturda">Trophee Des Champions</a>  - a battle for the French Super Cup between Montpellier and Lyon - will be held on July 28th.</p>
