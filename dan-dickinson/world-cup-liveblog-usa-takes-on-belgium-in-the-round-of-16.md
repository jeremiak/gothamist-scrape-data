<p>It&apos;s do or die time for the USA.</p>

<p>At 4 PM ET, the US will take on Belgium in Salvador in the final Round of 16 at the 2014 World Cup. A win will move them through to the quarterfinals for only the second time in the modern format. A loss will eliminate them entirely from the tournament, and force a nation of sports fans back into baseball&apos;s loving arms.</p>

<p>The odds aren&apos;t in their favor: Belgium finished atop Group H with a perfect record, while the USMNT went 1-1-1 to escape Group G in second place. In five meetings between the countries, the US only won the first in 1930. The most recent match was a 2013 4-2 pasting in Cleveland. But with Jozy Altidore reportedly available for the match, and the US having a penchant for dramatics, anything could happen. (Or so we&apos;ve been told.)</p>
