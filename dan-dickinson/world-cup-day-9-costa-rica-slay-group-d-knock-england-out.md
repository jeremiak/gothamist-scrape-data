<p>Friday&apos;s World Cup action brought us a giant narrative flip as Costa Rica advance, seven goals in one match, and a Clint Dempsey photobomb.</p>

<p><em>Last Night&apos;s Action</em></p>

<p><strong>Italy 0, Costa Rica 1</strong> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428110945/http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/videos/highlights/match=300186500/index.html">HIGHLIGHTS</a>) In a group with three previous World Cup winners, <em>Los Ticos</em> have cemented their legend as giant killers, earning their second win and sending them through to the Round of 16. </p>

<p>Costa Rica outplayed a lackluster Italy by shutting down Andrea Pirlo and playing a high defensive line. Costa Rica were cruelly denied a legitimate penalty near the end of the first half, but no matter: Bryan Ruiz drilled home a header off the cross-bar a minute later for the game winner.</p>

<p><strong>Switzerland 2, France 5</strong> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428110945/http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/videos/highlights/match=300186514/index.html">HIGHLIGHTS</a>) France continued their scoring blitz, putting five past the top seed in the group to practically guarantee their tournament will continue. Five different goal scorers for <em>Les Bleus</em> were enough to have pundits everywhere making &quot;swiss cheese defense&quot; jokes, especially after France&apos;s second goal came seconds after their first. Switzerland pulled back two goals in the final ten minutes to make the scoreline look less lopsided.</p>

<p><strong>Honduras 1, Ecuador 2</strong> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428110945/http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/videos/highlights/match=300186463/index.html">HIGHLIGHTS</a>) Honduras had hope in this one as Carlo Costly scored the team&apos;s first World Cup goal since 1982. But two goals from Enner Valencia gave Ecuador the come-from-behind win, leaving Honduras hanging by a thread in the group.</p>

<p><em>The Play To Watch</em></p>

<p>Here&apos;s Bryan Ruiz shocking Italy and the world with the goal that sent Costa Rica through to the next round:</p>

<p>And here&apos;s France&apos;s second goal, which came just seconds after they scored their first:</p>

<p><em>Today&apos;s Matches</em></p>

<p><strong>Argentina vs. Iran</strong> (12PM ET, ESPN) Hard to think Iran will give Argentina much trouble in today&apos;s early match, but given how bizarrely results have gone in this World Cup, who knows anymore? Argentina can secure their place in the Round of 16 with a win today.</p>

<p><strong>Germany vs. Ghana</strong> (3PM ET, ESPN) One to watch for US fans, as there are implications for the USMNT. A Germany win would give the US the chance to clinch a spot in the next round tomorrow against Portugal, while a Ghana upset could throw the group into chaos. Rumors are still swirling that Ghana&apos;s camp is in revolt, but may be bolstered by Michael Essien returning to full training.</p>

<p><strong>Nigeria vs. Bosnia-Herzegovina</strong> (6PM ET, ESPN) Bosnia will almost certainly need a result over the Nigeria if they are to avoid elimination. The Super Eagles have not just their tournament hopes to play for, but to help their country heal after a terrorist attack at a World Cup watch party killed 21 people.</p>

<p><em>What Else Is Going On?</em></p>

<p>Thanks to the Costa Rica result, England were eliminated from the tournament. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428110945/http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jun/21/wayne-rooney-apology-england-world-cup-exit">Wayne Rooney has apologized</a> to fans, while coach Roy Hodgson - who has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428110945/http://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/27951796">no regrets about his strategy</a> - will <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428110945/http://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/27945473">not be sacked</a>.</p>

<p>From the training field, Argentina&apos;s Leo Messi and Sergio Aguero confirm what we already know: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428110945/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpzsVB2f8Vw">they are terrifyingly good</a>.</p>

<p>As countries are eliminated one by one, you might need something to drown your sorrows in. NYXI has helpfully paired cocktails with each team&apos;s unique misery in their new YouTube series <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428110945/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1qLkT_Z57oQ&amp;list=PLOqzXxEatk4tAMY60T5nqJvI1GGK-hXK0&amp;feature=share">Taste of Defeat</a>.</p>

<p>In NYC and feeling the urge to play some street soccer? Nike opened their &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428110945/http://www.nikesoccer-nyc.com/">Hall of Phenomenal</a>&quot; pop-up venue last night, featuring a futsal court that looks out onto the West Side Highway for a &quot;Winner Stays On&quot; tournament. It&apos;s open from 12 to 6 daily during the remainder of the Group Stage.</p>

<p>Finally: Clint Dempsey isn&apos;t just scoring goals in Brazil, he&apos;s also upping his photobomb game:</p>
