<p>You&apos;d be hard pressed to call the third match of the year &quot;must win&quot; for any team in any sport, but after the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428112116/http://gothamist.com/redbulls">New York Red Bulls</a> 0-2-0 start, it certainly felt like one.  Never has a high-pressure home opener looked so easy: in front of a raucus crowd, the Red Bulls made a statement and decimating a depleted Colorado Rapids 4-1 for their first win of the season.</p>

<p>New York&apos;s dominance was bolstered by four key changes in the lineup across both teams.  Rafa Marquez finally returned from his suspension dating back to the 2011 playoffs, and joined Dax McCarty in midfield (Teemu Tainio was out with an ankle contusion).  Wilman Conde also made his much awaited debut appearance in the back line, after suffering an injury during the pre-season.  On the other side of the pitch, Colorado sorely missed two strong midfielders - Jeff Larentowicz (suspended for a red card against Philly), and captain Pablo Mastroeni (injured).</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right" style=" width:300px; "> <img alt="2012_02_thierry2012.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428112116im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2012_02_thierry2012.jpg" width="300" height="320"> <br> <i>Thierry Henry and Colorado Rapids defender Marvell Wynne fight for the ball (AP)</i></div> It didn&apos;t take long for New York to jump into the lead.  Thierry Henry opened the scoring in just the third minute, leaping on an errant pass from Colorado defender Ross LaBauex, and drilling a shot to the near post past keeper Matt Pickens.  Just three minutes later, Henry floated a long pass to Kenny Cooper, who nearly lost control of it before slotting in a tight angle low shot to the far post.<p></p>

<p>Throughout the match, the Red Bulls looked fired up, chasing every ball and playing with an energy fans had yet to see this year.  Rafa Marquez played box-to-box and could be seen smiling as he constantly battled the hapless Colorado midfield for possession.  In the back, Wilman Conde&apos;s return looked like the missing piece of the puzzle, not only playing a hand in shutting down multiple attacks, but barking orders and organizing a defense that had looked hapless in the previous two matches.</p>

<p>The second half saw both sides grind out with some physical play, and both Henry and Cooper found second goals.  Henry picked up a long free kick from Conde and again beat Pickens in the 52nd minute.  Colorado finally got on the board in the 77th minute, after a Rafa Marquez slip gave the ball away and Omar Cummings nailed a beautiful curling ball past Ryan Meara. Colorado continued to press hoping to make up the remaining goals, but Kenny Cooper poached his second from close range in the 89th to pad NY&apos;s lead.</p>

<p>The 4-1 result is NY&apos;s largest win margin over Colorado in league play since August of 1998.</p>

<p>While he wasn&apos;t expected for the match due to his involvement in Olympic qualification, Juan Agudelo was present for the match.  Agudelo suffered a meniscus tear in his left knee prior to the US&apos;s shock 2-0 loss to Canada, and had returned to NYC for evaluation and surgery.  Speaking to reporters about the Canada match, the young striker said &quot;It was tough to watch, definitely just wanting to be out there and wanting to help your team qualify. My teammates were so upset after the game, we just want to go London.&quot;  The US faces El Salvador tonight (9PM ET, Universal Sports) in a game where anything but a win will eliminate the US from competing in London this summer.</p>

<p><strong>POST-MATCH COMMENTS</strong></p>

<p>Coach Hans Backe: &quot;I think everyone is aware now, this is the way we just need to dig in every game and step up for each other...you can see the players - how focused they are and they were definitely more focused on key moments in this game.  You could see a difference.&quot;</p>

<p>Midfielder Dax McCarty: &quot;Today, I think we played with a fire we don&apos;t show enough.  We do have a fire within our team that comes out when we&apos;re kind of challenges, and I think that fire should be shown no matter what the game.&quot;</p>

<p>Striker Kenny Cooper: &quot;As a striker, it feels great to have so much confidence in the guys around me, and I certainly feel that.  It&apos;s an incredibly talented group, and I feel very privileged to be here.&quot;</p>

<p>Midfielder Rafa Marquez: &quot;It&apos;s for me to do what I did today, to leave everything on the field.  I did have a mistake during the game, but the main point is to leave 100% on the field.&quot;</p>

<p>Striker Thierry Henry: &quot;I think if you come with the right state of mind and the way we came in the first half, in the first minutes, trying to put pressure and get the crowd going, and obviously scoring goals does help.  We need to every time start to do that and even if we don&apos;t, make it like a fortress.  I know it&apos;s not easy to say right now but it&apos;s going to have to be the case.&quot;</p>
