Now featuring video playback functionality, the device brings new questions to the thought of owning and using an iPod in NYC.  I recently got my hands on one, and after smudging it with my fingerprints, I think I can answer a few.</p>

<p>I don&apos;t intend to do a full-blown review of every last details of the new iPod; if you&apos;re looking for something like that, you can read the reviews in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428112250/http://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/18/technology/circuits/19web-pogue.html">the Times</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428112250/http://online.wsj.com/public/article/SB112967377359572414-4j7zOUjbOjQdxG7_kC_cAFgA4VM_20061019.html?mod=blogs">the WSJ</a>, or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428112250/http://arstechnica.com/reviews/hardware/video-ipod.ars">Ars Technica</a>.</p>

<p>The 5G iPod comes in four configurations, with two hard drive sizes (30GB / 60GB) and two case colors (black / white).  The 30GB configuration retails for $299, while the 60GB retails for $399.  It should be noted that students or educators can receive a discount by showing their ID while purchasing at the Apple Store. These prices match the previous generation, so the new functionality does not add a further premium to the price, which is a big plus for me. <br clear="all"></p>
