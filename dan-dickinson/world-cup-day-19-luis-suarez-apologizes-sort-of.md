<p>Monday&apos;s World Cup action brought us France sliding by Nigeria, Germany struggling to beat Algeria, an apology from Luis Suarez, and candy throwing as a sign of disrespect.</p>

<p><em>Last Night&apos;s Action</em></p>

<p><strong>France 2, Nigeria 0</strong> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428110907/http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/videos/highlights/match=300186462/index.html">HIGHLIGHTS</a>) France used a pair of second half goals to lay waste to Nigeria and advance to the quarterfinals for the first time since 2006. Nigerian goalkeeper Vincent Enyeama kept Nigeria in contention, but was squarely at fault for France&#x2019;s opener in the 79th minute. He did poorly on an attempted clearance, deflecting the ball directly to Juventus midfielder Paul Pogba, who easily nodded it goalwards. To make matters worse, Enyeama was done in by his own teammate in stoppage time when Nigerian defender Joseph Yobo deflected a French effort into his own net, sealing his side&#x2019;s fate. </p>

<p><strong>Germany 2, Algeria 1 </strong> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428110907/http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/videos/highlights/match=300186460/index.html">HIGHLIGHTS</a>) Germany put together their first underwhelming performance of the tournament - but it didn&#x2019;t matter, they still advanced. Such is the gulf in talent between the Germans and all of their opponents to date.</p>

<p>Neither team seemed to have the finishing touch in a fairly uneventful opening ninety, though extra time proved the remedy for those doldrums. Just two minutes into the first half of ET, Andre Sch&#xFC;rrle put Die Mannschaft on the board, using a cheeky bit of skill to redirect a cross into the back of the net. Mesut &#xD6;zil doubled their lead just a minute from the death, making Algerian midfielder Abdelmoumene Djabou&#x2019;s 121st minute strike irrelevant. </p>

<p><em>The Plays To Watch</em></p>

<p>Germany waited until extra time to score both of their goals against Algeria:</p>

<p>Algeria did pull one back late with this nice volley:</p>

<p>Algeria also did plenty of strong defensive work, including a double save and a goal-line clearance:</p>

<p><em>Today&apos;s Matches</em></p>

<p><strong>Argentina vs. Switzerland</strong> (12PM ET, ESPN) You probably know who Lionel Messi is. You&#x2019;ve probably seen him on the cover of that one soccer video game or seen some dude in a Barcelona jersey with his name on it. But you probably don&#x2019;t know who Xherdan Shaqiri is, and that&#x2019;s a shame. Shaquiri - the prolific Swiss forward who plies his trade in Germany and has recently been linked with a move to the English Premiere League - came alive in Switzerland&#x2019;s final group stage match, lighting up lowly Honduras for a hat trick. </p>

<p>Both strikers will look to put their stamp on the round of 16: while Argentina are the clear favorites in this match, the Swiss are no pushovers and have played an entertaining brand of football, a far cry from the dull, lifeless soccer they played in the 2010 World Cup. </p>

<p><strong>Belgium vs. USA</strong> (4PM ET, ESPN) The Belgians are everybody&#x2019;s dark horse to make a deep run in this tournament, which we&apos;d argue doesn&#x2019;t really make them a dark horse at all. They&#x2019;re an organized outfit with a dozen players who ply their trade in the EPL, they&#x2019;ve yet to lose a match at the World Cup and they beat the US convincingly 4-2 in a friendly last year.</p>

<p>The USA, of course, are playing on house money at this point. Few people expected them to emerge from the &#x201C;group of death,&#x201D; and even fewer expect them to advance to the quarterfinals. But there&#x2019;s a wrinkle here: the Yanks are playing with a bit of swagger, and sorely-missed forward Jozy Altidore is available for selection today (our guess however is that he won&#x2019;t play.) And there are other variables as well: Belgian standout and captain Vincent Kompany is battling injury and may miss the match, opening up a bit more space for the US attack.</p>

<p>Oh, and we&#x2019;re America. Perhaps this whole match-up is best summed up in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428110907/https://twitter.com/WaffleHouse/statuses/483594118741123072">this grammatically incorrect tweet</a> from one of our most treasured national institutions: </p>

He said that his &#x201C;colleague&#x201D; suffered &#x201C;the physical result of a bite in his collision with me&#x201D; which is sort of like saying &#x201C;I&#x2019;m sorry your fist ran into my face in that fight.&#x201D; Oh well, better than nothing:</p>

<p>US coach Jurgen Klinsmann <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428110907/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/01/sports/worldcup/world-cup-2014-before-usa-belgium-jurgen-klinsmann-works-the-referee.html">has some issues</a> with the referee selected to officiate today&#x2019;s USA/Belgium match. Namely that he&#x2019;s Algerian (the US eliminated Algeria from the World cup in 2010) and that he speaks french (the Belgians speak this language of course while the Yanks don&#x2019;t.) &quot;Is it a good feeling? No,&quot; Klinsmann said on Monday, displaying the maximum amount of emotion allowable for a person of German descent: </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428110907/http://www.google.com/trends/worldcup">Google released some trend data</a> for searches during the World Cup. Mexico searched for memes more often than goal highlights, and the Netherlands appear confused about the difference between Chile and chili.</p>

<p>BREAKING (NOT BREAKING): A story about shady behavior amongst members of an African team. This one, though is a bit more insane. &#x201C;Seven bad apples&#x201D; are accused of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428110907/http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jul/01/world-cup-2014-cameroon-investigate-match-fixing-claims">possibly throwing Cameroon&#x2019;s group stage match</a> against Croatia.</p>

<p>Need to get pumped for today&apos;s USMNT match? This US-themed hype video is basically 1/4th Point Break, 1/4th Walker Texas Ranger, 1/4th Charlie Kelly, 1/4th Attention Deficit Disorder, 1/4th wet t-shirt contest, 1/4th anabolic steroids and 1/4th&#x2026; ah, I screwed the math up. (Oh well, we&#x2019;ve never been much for math in this country.)</p>
