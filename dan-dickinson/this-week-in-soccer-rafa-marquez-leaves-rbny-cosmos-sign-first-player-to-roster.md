<p>Christmas has come early for Major League Soccer fans.  After days of speculation triggered by reports in the Mexican media, the New York Red Bulls <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111701/http://www.newyorkredbulls.com/news/2012/12/defender-rafa-marquez-released-new-york-red-bulls">announced this morning</a> that controversial defender Rafa Marquez had left the club by a mutual release agreement.</p>

<p>Let&apos;s dispense with the pleasantries: &quot;controversial&quot; doesn&apos;t fairly represent the reaction to Marquez over his 2.5 years with the club and the league.  He has worn labels like &quot;toxic&quot;,  &quot;a cancer&quot;, &quot;a disaster&quot;, and &quot;an abomination&quot; given by media and fans alike.  He leaves MLS at a time when he was the second highest paid player in the league (behind only Thierry Henry), having made an estimated $2,923 <em>per minute</em> he spent on the field.</p>

<p>Initial hopes during his 2010 debut turned to disappointment as he became frequently injured and unreliable.  The disappointment would turn into hatred in the fall of 2011, as after a particular poor performance, Marquez famously <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111701/http://www.empireofsoccer.com/rafa-marquez-teammates-not-on-my-level/">threw his teammates under the bus</a>, saying they were not &quot;on his level&quot;.  He again made headlines during the playoffs by triggering <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111701/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/31/red_bulls_lose_0-1_to_la_in_first_s.php">a post-match brawl</a> with the LA Galaxy that saw him simulate contact when a punch was thrown at him.  (It spoke volumes to the type of player that Rafa Marquez is that even during a brawl, he&apos;s willing to flop on the pitch.)</p>

<p>2012 was to be the rebirth of Marquez, with Coach Backe telling media &quot;You will see a totally different player this year&quot;.  But his age forced him to miss many games with injuries - and when he wasn&apos;t injured, he was facing suspension for classy moves like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111701/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/19/again_rafa_marquez_suspended_three.php">breaking a player&apos;s clavicle</a>.  He only saw the field in 15 regular season matches this season, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111701/http://gothamist.com/2012/11/09/17_years_no_cups_dc_united_steals_i.php">yet again got sent off</a> in the playoffs.</p>

<p>Marquez is expected to make a move to Club Leon in LigaMX to finish off his career.  Based on the reaction on Twitter this morning, he won&apos;t be missed.</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="2012_11_mednes.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111701im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2012_11_mednes.jpg" width="640" height="427"> <br> <i> Head Coach Giovanni Savarese, Carlos Mendes, and GM Erik Stover ( NY Cosmos)</i></div> <p></p>

<p><strong>Cosmos Sign Local MLS Veteran Carlos Mendes As First Player</strong></p>

<p>The Cosmos took a large first step towards their preparation for the 2013 NASL season by signing the first player to their roster&#x2014;and he&apos;s one that will be familiar to NYC-area soccer fans.  Carlos Mendes, the Long Island native and 6-year MetroStar and Red Bull defender, signed with the club on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Mendes will wear the number 4 jersey for the club - <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111701/http://nycosmos.com/news/4-4-werner-roth-cosmos-and-carlos-mendes">the same</a> as former club captain Werner Roth.  When we spoke to Mendes and coach Giovanni Savarese on Tuesday, they were both elated with the announcement.  Why move to the Cosmos?  &quot;There&apos;s so many things.  The name, the history behind this club, the players who have played...to come back home.  I&apos;m a local guy, grew up in New York.  To play again in front of my family and friends...from the staff here, Gio to Eric, I have so much respect for them.  It was just too much to pass up really.&quot;</p>

<p>Mendes didn&apos;t get a lot of playing time in 2012 due to injury when he was with Columbus.  Savarese indicated that the club was making plans to help bolster Mendes&apos; fitness in advance of their first season.  &quot;We are looking to make sure Carlos continues playing, that he stays in shape when we are going to start the season somewhere around the end of May...so we&apos;re looking for some possibilities for him to be loaned and continue playing, so that when he comes back he&apos;ll be 100% to enter into the preseason.&quot;</p>

<p>With all the recent hirings being familiar faces to area soccer fans, we asked if the intention was to focus on the area to build the roster.  &quot;I think the most important the thing is that the Cosmos is open for everybody,&quot; said Savarese.  &quot;We are looking for players overseas, domestic players outside New York...but we are definitely for talent in New York.  We respect the talent in the area.  We want to form a team that people can identify themselves with.  Definitely, Carlos is one of them, and we&apos;re looking for more talent in the area.&quot;</p>

<p>And as for when will the Cosmos have the rest of their roster?  &quot;If it was up to me, hopefully by tomorrow,&quot; joked Savarese.  &quot;I think the full roster will come into completion hopefully by the end of May or June.  The most important thing is to have a full squad and a strong team for our first match when we play in August.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Short Corners</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>The Red Bulls also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111701/http://www.newyorkredbulls.com/news/2012/12/new-york-signs-red-bulls-academy-players-santiago-castano-and-armando-moreno">signed two academy products</a> this week.  Goalkeeper Santiago Castano and forward Amando Moreno will join the senior squad in the 2013 season.  The signing brings the total number of academy players signed to 7 - although only Connor Lade remains with the team.</li>
<li>The Cosmos are getting ready to begin offering season tickets.  Beginning Friday at 10 a.m., fans will be able to place deposits for 2013 season tickets <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111701/http://nycosmos.com/">on the club&apos;s website</a>.  Doing so offers priority benefits such as preferred seat selection and purchase access before the general public sale.</li>
<li>Thierry Henry is reportedly angling for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111701/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2245529/Thierry-Henry-make-Arsenal-debut-FA-Cup.html">another offseason loan to Arsenal</a>.</li>
