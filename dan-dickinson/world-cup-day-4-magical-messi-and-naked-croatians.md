<p>Sunday in the World Cup: Switzerland left it for late, Honduras collapsed, and the Japanese are too polite.</p>

<p><em>Last Night&apos;s Action</em></p>

<p><strong>Switzerland 2, Ecuador 1</strong> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111021/http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/videos/highlights/match=300186494/index.html">HIGHLIGHTS</a>) Switzerland needed the latest goal in World Cup group stage history to notch the win. Falling behind after 20 minutes to a Enner Valencia header, Switzerland clawed their way back into the game with a header of their own from Admir Mehmedi. The Swiss would&apos;ve felt hard done with a draw, as they incorrectly had a goal chalked off as offside, but the 93rd minute tap-in goal from Haris Seferovic gave <em>La Nati</em> the full three points. </p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="2014_06_france110.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111021im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2014_06_france110.jpg" width="640" height="459"> <br> <i> France&apos;s Karim Benzema, second from left, scores his side&apos;s third goal over Honduras (AP)</i></div> <p></p>

<p><strong>France 3, Honduras 0</strong> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111021/http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/videos/highlights/match=300186496/index.html">HIGHLIGHTS</a>) France&apos;s ghosts of 2010 were erased as they thoroughly trounced Honduras. Karim Benzema should&apos;ve been credited with a hat trick, but the second goal-which required the first use of goal line technology to make the correct call-was credited as an own goal when goalkeeper Noel Valladares appeared to push a rebound shot over the goal line. Just two goals for Benzema, then.</p>

<p><strong>Argentina 2, Bosnia-Herzegovina 1</strong> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111021/http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/videos/highlights/match=300186477/index.html">HIGHLIGHTS</a>) Despite going up 1-0 on a third minute own goal, Argentina was struggling for most of this match, as Bosnia pressed hard and constantly broke up the Argentine attack. In the end, it felt written in the stars that Lionel Messi, who has been under endless scrutiny for not being able to single-handedly win Argentina the World Cup, beautifully scored the eventual game winner. Vedad Ibisevic, who grew up in St. Louis, scored Bosnia&apos;s first ever goal in the World Cup by nutmegging goalkeeper Sergio Romero.</p>

<p><em>The Play To Watch</em></p>

<p>Lots to choose from, but we&apos;re going with Leo Messi&apos;s bit of brilliance because, well, it&apos;s Messi. A long run, a quick give and go pass, dancing around defenders, and pinging a shot perfectly off the post is about as stereotypically Messi as one can get.</p>

<p><em>Today&apos;s Matches</em></p>

<p><strong>Germany vs. Portugal</strong> (12PM, ESPN) Germany is ranked second in the world. Portugal is ranked fourth. This is as strong a matchup as you&apos;re going to see in the group stage. Cristiano Ronaldo says he&apos;s healthy and ready to go for Portugal, and his fitness will be key if Portugal is going to break down the German defense.</p>

<p><strong>Iran vs. Nigeria</strong> (3PM, ESPN) We feel bad, because with Germany-Portugal before it, and Ghana-USA after it, it&apos;s hard to feel much emotion at all for Iran and Nigeria squaring off. Nigeria are favorites here, but neither seem to have much of a chance of getting out of the group consider that Argentina and Bosnia-Herzegovina are also in their group. If there&apos;s no strong statement from either team here, group F might as well be locked up.</p>

<p><strong>Ghana vs. USA</strong> (6PM, ESPN) Finally, the USMNT kick off their group play against the thorn in their sides for the last two tournaments, the Black Stars of Ghana.  The US will be looking not just for revenge but for a critical three points, as they&apos;ll need every result to go their way if they&apos;re going to escape the group. Ghana won&apos;t be pushovers though, and remain confident they can dispatch the US for a third straight tournament. Watch for our match preview from the US training camp, running later today.</p>

<p><em>What Else Is Going On?</em></p>

<p>In case you missed it over the weekend, our own Charles Boehm is down in Brazil during the World Cup and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111021/http://gothamist.com/2014/06/15/brazils_conflicted_confused_world_c.php">wrote about the strange duality</a> of Brazil being both an excited and frustrated host country.</p>

<p>ESPN&apos;s Doug McIntyre was present when US midfielder Jermaine Jones <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111021/http://www.espnfc.us/team/united-states/660/blog/post/1874261/this-land-is-my-land">met his estranged father</a> in Miami after twenty years apart.</p>

<p>Croatia&apos;s players are refusing to speak to the media after two photographers hid in the bushes near the team swimming pool and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111021/http://www.24sata.hr/show/poslastica-za-nase-navijacice-lovren-srna-i-decki-skroz-goli-371495">snapped the team swimming nude</a>.
