<p>They&apos;ve only just returned to professional soccer, but the New York Cosmos have already secured their first title.  With a 2-1 win on the road at San Antonio, the Cosmos secured enough points to clinch the NASL 2013 Fall Season.  They will take on Spring Season winners Atlanta in the NASL Soccer Bowl (yes, <em>really</em>) on November 9th.</p>

<p>The game got off on the wrong foot, with San Antonio getting on the board thanks to Tomasz Zahorski after just three minutes.  But two second-half goals in two minutes - one from Marcos Senna, and one from Stefan Dimitrov - put the Cosmos out in front for most of the second half.  The Cosmos battled through a twisted ankle forcing Senna off the field, and a red card reducing them to 10 men, to notch the victory. The result guarantees they can&apos;t be overtaken on points in the final weekend, ensuring them the honors in the 14-match Fall season.</p>

<p>&quot;This is something the players deserve,&quot; said Cosmos head coach Giovanni Savarese, who recently signed a multi-year contract extension. &quot;They&apos;ve been working extremely hard and have had a great season, playing one game at a time. Now, after tonight, we&apos;ll immediately start to focus and prepare for our next match.&quot;</p>

<p>The Cosmos will now start looking towards the Soccer Bowl, NASL&apos;s primary championship for the season.   The game will be hosted by the Atlanta Silverbacks, the NASL 2013 Spring Season winners, on November 9th (the game will air on ESPN Deportes and ESPN 3).  The Silverbacks have met one time so far this season, a 1-1 draw at Hofstra in early September; the return leg will come next weekend, so expect it to be an early preview of what the Cosmos may be up against in the championship match.</p>
