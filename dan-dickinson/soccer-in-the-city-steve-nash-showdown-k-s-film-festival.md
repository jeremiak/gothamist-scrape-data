<p>Watching every match of Euro 2012 from your desk at work not enough?  Still haven&apos;t had your fill of soccer even after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111947/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/25/barklage_and_red_bulls_get_revenge.php">RBNY thrashed DC United</a>?  Don&apos;t worry: two classic NYC soccer events return tomorrow night to fill that 4-4-2-shaped hole in your heart.</p>

<p>Now in it&apos;s fifth year, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111947/http://stevenash.org/showdown/">Steve Nash Showdown</a> returns tomorrow night.  The yearly &quot;pro-amateurial&quot; charity match at Sara D. Roosevelt Park pits stars of international soccer and the NBA to raise funds for the Steve Nash Foundation, which helps unprivileged children around the world. While final rosters won&apos;t be set until tomorrow night, we&apos;ve been told that Thierry Henry, Salomon Kalou, Maurice Edu and Grant Hill are all confirmed for the match tomorrow.  The match kicks off at 6:30 and is free to the public (first come, first served); tickets are still available to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111947/https://stevenash.org/make-an-assist/store/showdown/afterparty-for-one">afterparty at Penny Farthing</a>.  We&apos;ll be back with a full match report on Thursday, but here&apos;s footage from last year:</p>

<p>Rather be inside?  The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428111947/http://www.kickingandscreening.com/">Kicking &amp; Screening Film Festival</a> also gets underway Wednesday night at Tribeca Cinemas.  The international festival enters its fourth year with ten films about the beautiful game, many making their premiere.  While some of the big name films are already sold out (such as the US vs. Mexico documentary <em>Gringos At The Gate</em> and the fiery <em>El Cl&#xE1;sico: More Than a Game</em>), tickets are still available for Friday and Saturday night.  Film and soccer fans alike should not miss this festival.</p>
