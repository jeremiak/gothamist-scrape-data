<p>You won&apos;t have to wait for the official weekend to get your brunch on&#x2014;well, to get your egg on at least. The Southside Supper Club is throwing a <strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140424020345/http://thesouthsidesupperclub.com/">Brunch Dinner</a></strong> tonight at 7 p.m. and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140424020345/http://gothamist.com/2014/02/01/fred_hua_interview.php">Chef Fred</a> is doing a lot more than just plates of Eggs Benedict. The four course meal centers around three eggs, three ways. First up, an ostrich egg frittata with veggies and asiago; then a deviled duck egg with chili; and finally a poached chicken egg with monkfish liver, goat cheese and spinach on toast. Oh, and fried apple pie for dessert, natch. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140424020345/http://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/590326">Tickets are $35 per person</a> and the event is BYOB.</p>

<p>If you can&apos;t wait until Monday to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140424020345/http://gothamist.com/2014/02/27/chipotle_tofu_finally_arrives_in_ny.php#photo-1">stuff your face with tofu</a>, head on over to this weekend&apos;s <strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140424020345/http://gothamist.com/2014/02/03/vegetarian_food_festival.php">Vegetarian Food Festival</a></strong>. The annual meat free celebration takes over the Metropolitan Pavilion on Saturday and Sunday, with vendors peddling goods like vegan nut cheeses, baked goods, granolas and grain mixes. Panels on budgeting for a vegan lifestyle and other veg topics are on the lineup, plus some standup comedy to lighten the mood. Single day tickets are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140424020345/https://2014nycvegfoodfest.chirrpy.com/">available now</a> for $30 each or buy a weekend pass for $50.</p>

<p>Meatlovers should head over to Barcade for the <strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140424020345/http://barcadebrooklyn.com/special-events/b-r-u-c-e/">B.R.ooklyn U.nderground C.hili E.xtravaganza</a></strong> on Sunday from 4 p.m. to 7 p.m. Folks&apos;ll be bringing crock pots of their own chili creations, like last year&apos;s winners who created the &quot;Ollie Ollie Ox &apos;n&apos; Fritos.&quot; There&apos;s judgement, of course, but more importantly there is chili to be consumed once a winner is crowned. There aren&apos;t any stipulations about what goes into the chili, though organizers do note that seasonings of the marijuana variety will not be accepted. Squares.</p>

<p>Those gigantic wine bottles that sometimes adorn Italian restaurant bars are more than just fun decor&#x2014;they are also filled with delicious wines, of course. This Sunday the Farm on Adderley <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140424020345/http://thefarmonadderleyevents.com/index.php/fe_news/news_item/natural-winemakers-dinner/">hosts a dinner</a> with a few vineyards in conjunction with <strong>Natural Winemakers Week</strong>. In addition to the aforementioned magnums, they&apos;ll also be pouring some vintages from jerobaums, which are <em>four foot tall bottles of wine</em>. They&apos;re offering a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140424020345/http://www.thefarmonadderleyevents.com/-/uploads/Jenny__Francois_2014.pdf">four course dinner</a> with the vino, including dishes like Salt-Baked Celery Root with harissa and Braised Beef Shoulder with yams and miso butter. The dinner begins at 8 p.m.; reserve a $75 seat by emailing thefarmonadderleyevents@gmail.com.</p>
