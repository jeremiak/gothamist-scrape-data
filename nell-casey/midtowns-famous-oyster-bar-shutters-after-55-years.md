<p>Red sauce seafood joint The Famous Oyster Bar has sunk. The funky little spot served its last plate of surf and turf last evening after 55 years on the corner of 7th Avenue at 54th Street. A longtime hostess at the restaurant <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140321070805/http://vanishingnewyork.blogspot.com/2014/01/famous-oyster-bar.html">told Jeremiah Moss</a> that the same Greek family had operated out of the space without issue since it opened in 1959; now it appears the landlord&apos;s daughter ousted them by refusing to renew their lease. A sign at the restaurant blames an &quot;exorbitant rent increase&quot; for the shutter.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140321070805/http://www.yelp.com/biz/famous-oyster-bar-new-york">The restaurant</a> wasn&apos;t much to speak of food-wise, but classic neon sign helped it stand out on the featureless block. The decor inside the restaurant was unique, to say the least, including a 20-foot oil painting of Greece and a &quot;hand carved display of 1912 Titanic.&quot; There will be an auction of all the tchotchkes, decorations, and equipment held at the restaurant today at noon, if chintzy nautical knick knacks fit your design plans.</p>
