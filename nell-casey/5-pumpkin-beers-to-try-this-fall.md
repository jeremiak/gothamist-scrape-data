<p>We&apos;re about to get swept up in &quot;Put Pumpkin In Everything&quot; season and that includes our favorite autumn-themed beverage: pumpkin beer. We&apos;ve been known to toss back a few gourd-flavored brews when they&apos;re in season&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203074756/http://instagram.com/p/ei5xbBH6FD/">cinnamon rim</a> optional&#x2014;but we asked beer expert Ben Wiley for his opinion about the best pumpkin offerings out there. As the man behind <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203074756/http://www.bargreatharry.com/blog/">Bar Great Harry</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203074756/http://theowlfarmbar.com/blog/">The Owl Farm</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203074756/http://missiondoloresbar.com/blog/">Mission Dolores</a> and then just opened <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203074756/http://502franklinbar.com/">Glorietta Baldy</a>, Wiley and his brother Mike definitely know their stuff when it comes to beer. Here are his recommendations for brews to seek out this season, including a very special alternative gourd option.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203074756/http://cartonbrewing.com/#!/pumpkin-cream-ale">Carton Pumpkin Cream Imperial, 9% ABV</a></strong> Wiley recommends all the beers from this NJ-based brewery, declaring them &quot;awesome across the board.&quot; Their seasonal pumpkin offering has some &quot;orange and ginger flavor&quot; for some extra zing with your gourd. You can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203074756/http://cartonbrewing.com/#!/find-our-beer">find the brew</a> all over NJ but you&apos;ll have to commit to a keg from <a her="http://www.americanbeerbuzz.com/">American Beer Distribution Company</a> in Carroll Gardens if you want some in the city.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203074756/http://flyingdogales.com/beers/the-fear/">Flying Dog The Fear, 9.0% ABV</a></strong>: &quot;The name! How could you not have this around this time? I&#x2019;ll be honest, it&#x2019;s a very straight forward pumpkin ale. But this brewery is awesome for all their beers, and they&#x2019;re heavily Hunter S. Thompson-influenced so I&#x2019;m buying. The people behind the beer are awesome, too.&quot; It&apos;s on the darker side of the pumpkin family with a nice malty flavor. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203074756/http://www.rattlenhumbarnyc.com/newsite/">Rattle N Hum</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203074756/http://bedstuybeer.com/">Bed-Stuy Beer Works</a> and lots of other bars and grocery stores are carrying it.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203074756/http://anthonymartin.be/en/our-beers/timmermans/-3-/">Timmermans Pumpkin Lambicus, 4% ABV</a></strong>: For 300 years Timmermans has brewed lambic-style beers so they&apos;re an obvious choice for something as unique as a pumpkin lambic. Wiley points to the &quot;sour, or oddball note&quot; common in this style of beers with the &quot;pumpkin-ness that we&apos;re used to.&quot; It&apos;s a rare combination&#x2014;and also rare on the shelves&#x2014;but its worth seeking out if you&apos;re looking for something different in the pumpkin beer family.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203074756/http://weyerbacher.com/blog/2012/10/imperial-pumpkin-ale/">Weyerbacher Imperial Pumpkin, 8.0% ABV</a></strong>: &quot;These guys have been making hardcore, high ABV beer since before it were cool. They&#x2019;re from PA which is always a plus since there ain&#x2019;t much good outta there! It&#x2019;s got all the standard autumn flavors of cinnamon, all spice, cardamom, nutmeg, etc.&quot; Find the brew at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203074756/http://ryansnyc.com/">Ryan&apos;s Irish Pub</a> in the East Village, at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203074756/http://www.sunswick3535bar.com/">Sunswick</a> in Astoria and at Whole Foods in Chelsea, Columbus Circle and East 57th Street.</p>
