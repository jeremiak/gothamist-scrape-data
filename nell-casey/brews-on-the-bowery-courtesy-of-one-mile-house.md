</div></div><p>The Lower East Side is getting a taste of the &apos;20s thanks to newcomer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120325234412/http://www.onemilehousenyc.com/">One Mile House</a>, which recently opened on Delancey Street. The name comes from an 1800s watering hole one mile from City Hall&#x2014; city politicians who wanted to booze while they &quot;governed&quot; could walk there and imbibe on the clock. This new incarnation keeps the spirit of the past alive with antique subway tiles, tin ceilings and bathroom walls adorned with newspaper clippings from the &apos;20s and &apos;30s. The spacious bar area has large windows that bring in plenty of sunlight during the day; candles and orb-shaped light fixtures create an intimate atmosphere at night. </p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120325234412/http://www.onemilehousenyc.com/menu.html">menu</a> features inspired twists on classic pub fare like the &quot;almost famous&quot; Hot Legs, a take on buffalo wings that trades out the poultry for crispy, fried frog&apos;s legs. Burgers come accompanied by Wisconsin cheddar or &quot;angry&quot;-style with Frank&apos;s hot sauce, Maytag blue cheese and red onions. The bar also serves up unusual pizza creations like a pie topped with Boursin, mashed potatoes, fried shallots and bacon, which pretty much guarantees you&apos;ll have to undo your top button after consuming. </p>

<p>Beer nerds will enjoy the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120325234412/http://www.onemilehousenyc.com/cocktails.html">constantly rotating tap list</a> with familiar offerings from Ommegang, Brooklyn Brewery and Victory and a smattering of less often seen selections like a hemp ale from Nectar Ales and a Founders porter. In addition, once a month breweries come in for a &quot;Tap Takeover&quot; and offer a variety of their brews for sampling. For the stronger stuff, the delightfully named cocktails&#x2014;Giggle Juice or Aspirin Alley, anyone?&#x2014;are sure to please your inner drunk, in particular their &quot;Baby&apos;s Got Temper,&quot; a Don Julio tequila-infused take on a classic michelada.</p>
