<p>On Wednesday, the first Manhattan offshoot of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021113306/http://gothamist.com/2014/09/18/best_pizza_nyc_guide.php">outstanding Staten Island pizzeria</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021113306/http://deninosgreenwichvillage.com/">Denino&apos;s</a> will open on MacDougal Street, nearly a year after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021113306/http://gothamist.com/2015/08/12/deninos_manhattan.php">the family revealed</a> the new franchise location. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021113306/https://www.facebook.com/deninosnyc/photos/a.1614531235523692.1073741828.1594495324193950/1614535212189961/?type=3&amp;theater">grand opening celebrations</a> begin on July 13th and run until Saturday, July 16th, when a new borough learns the excellence of one of the restaurant&apos;s savory thin crust pies.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021113306/http://deninosgreenwichvillage.com/menu.html">menu</a> at the new Denino&apos;s features all the favorites from the Port Richmond original, like the Garbage Pie loaded up with sausage, meatballs, pepperoni, mushrooms and onions and apps like fried calamari and garlic bread (pro tip: order it with cheese). One big difference with the new restaurant is the addition of pasta to the menu, with offerings like penne vodka, orecchiette and a special broccoli rabe ravioli filled with sun-dried tomato, crumbled sausage and broccoli rabe in a white wine, garlic and oil sauce.<br>
 <br>
Denino&apos;s at 93 MacDougal Street will be open for lunch and dinner daily, and though this may be an easier spot for many to get to, a pilgrimage to the original is definitely <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021113306/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/24/50_reasons_why_staten_island_deserv.php">worth the free ferry ride</a>.</p>
