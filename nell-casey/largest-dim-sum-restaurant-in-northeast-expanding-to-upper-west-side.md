<p>Chinatown&apos;s enormous dim sum palace <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171015114441/http://jingfongny.com/">Jing Fong</a> will open a satellite restaurant this summer on the Upper West Side. </p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171015114441/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/11/dining/yellow-magnolia-cafe-opens-at-brooklyn-botanic-garden.html">Times reports</a> that the restaurant will take over a former Planet Sushi space on Amsterdam between 78th and 79th, bringing steaming baskets of dumplings and chicken feet to the neighborhood. There will be a mere 100 seats at the new outpost&#x2014;down from 800 in the Manhattan Chinatown original&#x2014;but 40 of those will be outside, a feature unique to the new location.</p>

<p>Jing Fong specializes in dim sum of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171015114441/http://gothamist.com/2016/12/08/dim_sum_how_to_nyc.php">many, many varieties</a> served from rattling carts, but they also offer a full menu of Cantonese food ordered off menus from their kitchens. Both will be available at the UWS location, so take the next two months before they open to bone up on your bao.</p>
