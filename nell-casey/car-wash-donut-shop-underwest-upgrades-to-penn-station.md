<p>Penn Station&apos;s rebranding into a yuppified transportation hub slash <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161130151314/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/22/the_pennsy_yes_pennsy.php">destination dining spot</a> (egads) continues with the opening of its newest NYC-based food option this week: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161130151314/http://www.underwestdonuts.com/">Underwest Donuts</a>. The donut shop has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161130151314/http://gothamist.com/2015/02/11/underwest_donuts_car_wash.php#photo-1">migrated from the car wash</a> to the famed train station complex (upgrade?) for its second location, occupying a new space at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161130151314/http://www.underwestdonuts.com/location/2-penn-plaza/?mc_cid=9f0070dd22&amp;mc_eid=c889fa0c04">2 Penn Plaza</a> beginning December 1st. </p>

<p>Scott Levine&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161130151314/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/06/best_doughnut_shops_nyc.php">much-praised donuts</a> like Lemon Poppy and Maple Waffle will be served alongside Joe Coffee offerings. They&apos;ll also be debuting a brand-new flavor, Banana Milk, with the opening of the new shop.</p>

<p>Though not technically in the much-maligned fast food corridor (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161130151314/http://gothamist.com/2015/01/17/penn_station_ousted_slew_of_fast_fo.php">RIP</a>), this follows a general shift away from national brands towards local, artisanal food purveyors in the area. Naturally, Shake Shack is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161130151314/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/07/shake_shack_penn_station.php"><strike>coming next year</strike></a> opening December 3rd. </p>

<p>Local &gt; big box any day, but if the Port Authority <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161130151314/http://gothamist.com/2016/09/23/port_authority_bus_terminal_future.php#photo-1">murders</a> my outlet for Auntie Anne&apos;s pretzels, there will be a reckoning. </p>
