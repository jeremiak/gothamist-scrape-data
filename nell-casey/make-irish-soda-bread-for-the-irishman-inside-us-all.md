<p>If you don&apos;t already have the date marked in kelly green shamrocks on your calendar, St. Patrick&apos;s Day quickly approaches, threatening <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422204453/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/17/videos_crazy_times_square_mcdonalds.php">all kinds of shenanigans</a> to foul up your workday. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422204453/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/16/celebrate_st_patrick_with_a_game_of_1.php">Everybody&apos;s Irish</a> on Monday, March 17th but instead of (in addition to?) &quot;celebrating&quot; with 18 shots of Jameson, why not bake up some sweet and homey Irish Soda Bread, as befits tradition.</p>

<p>It&apos;s a patently Irish food that&apos;s equally enjoyable for anytime of the year. Serve it up at breakfast with butter and jam or toasted along with a cup of afternoon tea.</p>

<p><strong>Skillet Irish Soda Bread</strong><br>
 <br>
</p><ul><br>
<li>Butter for greasing pan plus 1/4 cup unsalted butter, melted</li><br>
<li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li><br>
<li>2/3 cup sugar</li><br>
<li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li><br>
<li>1 1/2 teaspoons salt</li><br>
<li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li><br>
<li>1 3/4 cups buttermilk</li><br>
<li>2 eggs, well beaten</li><br>
<li>1 1/2 cups raisins</li><br>
</ul><br>
 <br>
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Grease a 10-inch oven-proof skillet and line with parchment or waxed paper.<br>
 <br>
In a bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt and baking soda. In a separate bowl, combine the buttermilk, eggs and 2 tablespoons melted butter. Add wet ingredients to dry and stir until just combined. Do not overmix. Stir in the raisins.<br>
 <br>
Pour batter into skillet and brush top with remaining butter. Bake until golden and firm to touch, about 1 hour. Cool 10 minutes before slicing and serve.<br>
 <br>
Store leftovers in plastic once completely cooled.<p></p>
