<p>The MTA knows there&apos;s always money in the banana stand, to the tune of $26 million if it&apos;s on a coveted SoHo corner. According to the Washington Square Journal, real estate investment firm Madison Capital <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928023501/http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2013/07/24/mta-selling-small-soho-lot-for-nearly-26-million/?mod=WSJBlog">purchased the 6,190-square foot plot of land</a> on the south east side of Houston and Broadway on Monday. &#x201C;We had not predicted anything like this kind of money for this &#x2026; somewhat oddly shaped triangular parcel down in Soho,&#x201D; revealed MTA director of real estate Jeffrey Rosen. &#x201C;This is a splendid result.&#x201D;</p>

<p>The lot at 19 East Houston currently houses a small fruit stand, which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928023501/http://gothamist.com/tags/askanativenewyorker">some locals</a> deemed &quot;sketchy and dirty.&quot; The MTA also uses the strip of pavement as a staging area for trucks during subway emergencies, which makes us wonder how we&apos;ll be rescued in the future. Madison Capital plans to bring an &quot;exciting commercial development&quot; to the spot, which in their vernacular probably means get ready for a really exciting hybrid 7-Eleven/bank vestibule!</p>

<p>The MTA also gets a parking lot on East 20th Street as part of the deal, which Madison Capital will purchase for $13 million and then hand off so the MTA can store trucks in it. This brings the MTA&apos;s bounty to nearly $40 million in cash and gained property value, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928023501/http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2013/07/24/mta-selling-small-soho-lot-for-nearly-26-million/?mod=WSJBlog">the WSJ notes</a> that the agency won&apos;t get to keep all of the $26 million check. The city could take some of it as part of the terms of its $250 million pledge to the MTA&apos;s capital spending plan. Either way, the transit agency can always make a few extra bucks by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928023501/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/20/mta_open_to_selling_subway_station.php">renaming the Broadway-Lafayette</a> station for Capital One.</p>
