<p>We&apos;ve seen <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025112648/http://gothamist.com/2015/02/27/weekend_food_roundup.php">breakfast pasta before</a> but the new brunch menu at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025112648/http://larinabk.com/">LaRina Pastificio &amp; Vino</a> is doing <strong>breakfast ravioli</strong>, which is an upgrade to the category to be sure. Starting this weekend, swing by for an entire section devoted to breakfast pastas, including the Black Pepper Raviolone ($15) with bacon and a poached egg or Smoked Spaghetti Carbonara, an eggy and bacon-y dish in its own right. They&apos;ll have plenty of other egg-type dishes, plus sandwiches, pancakes and healthful fruit bowls and chia puddings. </p>
