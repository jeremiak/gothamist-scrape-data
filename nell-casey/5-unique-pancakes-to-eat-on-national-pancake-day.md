<p><strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150305055034/http://www.sonsofessexnyc.com/">EGGS BENEDICTOWITZ FROM SONS OF ESSEX</a></strong>: Eggs Benedict and potato pancakes are great on their own but when the two join forces they become greater than the sum of their parts. Sons of Essex&apos;s food philosophy combines all the different immigrants who&apos;ve called the LES home over the decades. This gut-busting brunch dish uses thick potato pancakes in lieu of a flimsy English Muffin and tops them with fresh smoked salmon, a poached egg and tops it off with plenty of lemony hollandaise. Make time for a post-meal nap.</p>
