<p>The gluten-free diet has been en vogue for years now, replacing the more generalized anti-carb revolution and specifically targeting the pesky protein found in everything from breads and pastas to soy sauce. But for the estimated 3 million Americans who suffer from celiac disease&#x2014;a truly terrible affliction where antibodies attack the lining of the small intestine&#x2014;and more still who are categorized as gluten sensitive, it can be a tricky business dining out without risking <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140205204611/http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/celiac-disease/DS00319/DSECTION=symptoms">terrible symptoms</a> of gluten ingestion. </p>

<p>Restaurants have been trying to keep up with the dietary trend, with everyone from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140205204611/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/07/dominos_now_making_a_gluten-free_pi.php">Domino&apos;s Pizza</a> to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140205204611/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/12/del_posto_now_serving_gluten-free_p.php">Del Posto</a> offering up gluten-free dishes. But guaranteeing a 100% gluten-free environment has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140205204611/http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304579404579234201223974792">proven to be very difficult</a>, reports the WSJ.</p>

<p>Following complaints after the launch of its initial gluten-free crust, the California Pizza Kitchen chain has doubled down, using pre-stretched dough in sealed bags and requiring a manager be present for each gluten-free order. Further, the restaurant uses rice flour for stretching its traditional crusts, eliminating the possibility of cross-contamination, and uses designated tools to ensure there&apos;s no contact with gluten items. &quot;It&apos;s a pretty intense process,&quot; explained senior vice president of culinary development Brian Sullivan. In the case of Domino&apos;s, the chain offers a gluten-free crust but cautions that the dough is prepared alongside regular crust pizzas and therefore may not be safe for celiac sufferers. What&apos;s the point?</p>

<p>Next year a new <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140205204611/https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2013/08/05/2013-18813/food-labeling-gluten-free-labeling-of-foods">regulation from the FDA</a> requires any food labeled gluten-free to contain fewer than <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140205204611/http://www.fda.gov/ForConsumers/ConsumerUpdates/ucm363069.htm">20 parts per million of the protein</a>. The labeling will be helpful for navigating the grocery store aisles but won&apos;t necessarily protect from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140205204611/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/31/chef_proudly_admits_lying_to_gluten.php">unscrupulous chefs</a> who poo-poo what they feel is a bogus disease&#x2014;despite <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140205204611/http://celiacdisease.about.com/b/2011/03/14/dr-fasano-different-processes-involved-in-celiac-gluten-sensitivity.htm">medical acknowledgement</a>. The chefs aren&apos;t totally wrong to be skeptical about gluten sensitivity claims; market research from NPD Group, Inc. showed that 25.5% more Americans are avoiding gluten than they were three years ago while only about 1% of the population suffers from some form of celiac disease. </p>
