title: Bad Restaurant Letter Grades Are Almost Never Overturned

<p>It&apos;s easier to get away with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508162622/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/02/cabbie_who_maimed_tourist_gets_his.php">running over a tourist</a> than it is to fight a bad grade from the Health Department. The Post <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508162622/http://nypost.com/2013/12/16/nearly-impossible-to-get-a-sanitary-restaurant-violation-overturned/">takes a look at the numbers</a> today, revealing that 97.2% of restaurant violation cases that come before an administrative court are upheld, leaving a scant 2.8% that were dismissed. Of the upheld cases, which are run by an independent health tribunal, 61.1 were sustained outright and 36.1 were settlements.</p>

<p>&quot;It&apos;s a complex inspection system,&quot; says Andrew Rigie of the New York City Hospitality Alliance. &quot;Plus the city incentivizes business owners to settle cases for reduced fines instead of going through the inconvenient tribunal process.&quot; Though the system underwent a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508162622/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/19/restaurant_fines.php">major overhaul</a> this year, which included drastic reductions of certain violations, the restaurant industry still feels it&apos;s being unfairly targeted by the revenue-hungry city agency; Health Department officials disagree. &quot;Restaurants are cleaner since letter grading went into effect,&quot; says spokesman Levi Fishman. &quot;The number of violations issued in the last two years has dropped nearly 20 percent, which has led to a fall in restaurant fines collected.&quot;</p>

<p>Compared with other city enterprises, restaurants take a markedly larger hit when it comes to the appeals process. Taxi and Limousine cases were upheld 67% of the time while agencies like Sanitation and Buildings clock in at around 57%. While some violations are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508162622/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/02/doh_shutters_mission_chinese_for_se.php">definitely warranted</a>, restaurateurs claim that most violations stem from non-critical things like a non-working lightbulb or a hole in the ceiling. Business owners are hoping they&apos;ll have an advocate in City Hall come next year, as the Bloomberg Administration proved it was out for blood, nearly doubling fines in the last decade. It&apos;s just so hard to live up to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508162622/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/24/bloomberg_says_not_to_eat_at_restau.php">Nanny Bloomberg&apos;s standards</a>. </p>
