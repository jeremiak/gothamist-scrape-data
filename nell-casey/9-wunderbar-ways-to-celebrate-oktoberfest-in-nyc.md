<p><em>The annual celebration of all things German and beer-related kicks off in the father land this weekend, and biergartens and beer bars are following suit across the pond, offering everything from all-you-can-drink specials to quiet, comfortable sit down meals. From the 100-year-old beer gardens in Queens to the bro-d out Midtown joints, there&apos;s all sorts of Oktoberfest fun to be had. Take your pick:</em></p>

<p><strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140227101118/http://kg-ny.com/blaue-gans">Blaue Gans</a></strong>: Starting tonight and continuing each Friday through October 6th, this Tribeca restaurant offers unlimited food and tap beer from 4 p.m. to 8 p.m. for $47. You&apos;ll get as many orders of Bratwurst, Weisswurst and other traditional sausages as you want, plus pretzels, donuts and strudel. They&apos;re also doing two Oktoberfest brunches on September 28th and October 5th from 12 - 4 p.m., so you can enjoy all the delicious German fare and still have the evening free to keep drinking!</p>

<p><em>139 Duane Street between Church and West Broadway, (212) 571-8880</em></p>

<p><strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140227101118/http://bierhausnyc.com/events/">Bierhaus</a></strong>: It&apos;s practically Oktoberfest year-round at this Midtown beer hall, which pours brews exclusively from Munich&apos;s Hofbrau. Starting tomorrow they&apos;re upping the ante, bringing in more live music and a traditional keg tapping of Hofbrau&apos;s Oktoberfest beer. The main event of their &apos;fest takes places on Saturday, October 26th, when national recognized competitive eaters chow down at the 2nd annual Bratwurst Eating Competition. The competition begins at 3 p.m. with more music, drinking and feasting for the audience. If you think you&apos;ve got the gut to compete, the top eater waddles away with $750 and a trophy, but you&apos;ll have to beat out Jamie &quot;The Bear&quot; McDonald to get the big prize.</p>
