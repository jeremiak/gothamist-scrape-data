<p><strong>[Update below]</strong> Perhaps inspired by our <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507080120/http://gothamist.com/2014/02/20/bottomless_brunch.php">glorious profile</a> of the city&apos;s best and worst bottomless boozy brunch deals, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507080120/http://www.thenycalliance.org/index.php">NYC Hospitality Alliance</a> would like to make clear that you are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507080120/http://www.thenycalliance.org/press-release-detail.php?id=90">partaking in an illegal activity</a> when your brunch has no bottom. Turns out the State Liquor Authority has a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507080120/https://www.sla.ny.gov/unlimited-drink-specials">law on the books</a> that prohibits bars and restaurants from &quot;selling, serving, delivering or offering to patrons an unlimited number of drinks during any set period of time for a fixed price.&quot; Welp, there goes Drunch.</p>

<p>Considering how many spots brazenly promote some form of unlimited boozing, it seems like the SLA hasn&apos;t made draining the Mimosa trough a priority. Maybe they&apos;re too busy <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507080120/http://gothamist.com/2014/02/25/chumleys_vs_nimbys.php">battling NIMBY neighbors</a>? We emailed the SLA for exact numbers, if they exist, and we&apos;ll update when we hear back. </p>

<p>Luckily, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507080120/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/27/the_10_best_happy_hours_in_nyc.php">happy hour</a> and other discounted and two-for-one deals are permitted; cities like Chicago <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507080120/http://chicagoist.com/2013/03/27/chicagoists_best_happy_hour_spots.php">are not so lucky</a>. </p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Just kidding everyone! Your boozy brunches are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507080120/http://gothamist.com/2014/02/27/rejoice_bottomless_brunches_are_tot.php">legal after all</a>. </p>
