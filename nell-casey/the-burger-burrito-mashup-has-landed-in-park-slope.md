<p>Hold on to your waistbands: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170124183233/http://www.burgritos.com/">Burgrito&apos;s</a>, the Long Island transplant <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170124183233/http://gothamist.com/2016/12/03/burgito_time.php">making a burger/burrito mashup</a>, has opened in Park Slope. There&apos;s nowhere to run, people. The Burgrito will find you.</p>

<p>&quot;This enticing creation consists of a juicy burger with American cheese, bacon, french fries, chipotle sauce, lettuce, tomato and onions wrapped in a flour tortilla,&quot; according to owners Lawrence and Darin Laby. They also make a vegetarian version with a veggie burger and a vegan chipotle sauce.</p>

<p>Burgers and burritos, separated as the universe first dictated, can also be ordered in combinations like the Avocado Burger with bacon, cheese and sliced avocado and a Chipotle Fish Burrito with fried flounder and all the usual fixings. </p>

<p>We&apos;ve all been through a lot since Friday morning, but if you feel that further punishment is necessary, head over to Burgrito&apos;s new home at 173 4th Avenue.</p>
