But great smartphone power does not automatically come with great smartphone photography, as evidenced by the laughable struggle plates we\'ve witnessed by trawling Yelp\'s user-submitted photography sections. Don\'t worry Martha, you\'re \<a href=\"http://sfist.com/2013/11/18/martha_stewart_made_a_dish_at_ateli.php\"\>not alone anymore\<\/a\>.\r\n\<br\>\<br\>\r\nWe wondered whether this phenomenon was limited to \<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/brother-jimmys-bbq-new-york-5?select=_5M1DzyxZgVwn2Ag1BgwFg#lWCxQAgbsuv84e0UH5KbgA\"\>(possibly) drunken nacho documentation\<\/a\> or if top tier restaurants were prone to the same kind of unappetizing photography. A peek around the thousands of photos tagged at \<a href=\"http://gothamist.com/2013/12/30/restaurant_map.php\"\>our top three NYC eateries\<\/a\>&mdash;Le Bernadin, Eleven Madison Park and Per Se&mdash;gave us the answer, and it\'s not pretty.\r\n\<br\>\<br\>\r\nIt should be noted that by and large, NYC\'s more upscale (read: expensive) restaurants have more photogenic food, and even amateurs can be proficient at capturing a well-composed plate. You\'ll likely have better luck photographing an \<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/per-se-new-york?select=0nV47p7WsQ1H4Rc_0RLqJQ#Mt9wRN7XM1EZbIu0jrKvmw\"\>artfully arranged scallop dish\<\/a\> than you will a \<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/alta-new-york?select=rPn0fM7g5olp73Nyd0fzGQ#0Lp6L6wdIBcVYt9Iu5ASAA\"\>pile of Brussel\'s sprouts\<\/a\>. That said, poor lighting, an unsteady hand and a general lack of awareness on how to operate one\'s phone camera can make even a $500 meal look like crap.\r\n\<br\>\<br\>\r\nThe percentage of beautiful food porn was much higher than the duds, luckily, but it makes you wonder: why put these bad photos up at all? Is it simple ignorance to the photo\'s quality? A desire to show the world you\'ve \"made it\" by dining at a pricey eatery? Regardless the reasoning, it brings us endless joy and laughter. And for that, we thank you. \r\n\<br\>\<br\>\r\nAnd now, it\'s time to publicly point and laugh, for which the internet was created. We\'ve focused on just food shots here, though there were plenty of \<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/per-se-new-york?select=0nV47p7WsQ1H4Rc_0RLqJQ#8SdKd047f334cd53fmg-IQ\"\>bizarre portraits\<\/a\> and a \<a href=\"https://twitter.com/nellcasey/status/438423046895177728\"\>startling collection of bathroom shots\<\/a\> that could have been included.
