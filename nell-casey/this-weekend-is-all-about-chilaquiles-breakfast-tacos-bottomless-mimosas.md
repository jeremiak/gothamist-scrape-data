<p>Having just been voted <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170109171623/http://gothamist.com/2016/12/20/best_new_bites_of_2016.php">best new restaurant</a> by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170109171623/http://gothamist.com/tags/quickbites">Quick Bites</a> critic Scott Lynch, now might be tough time to visit <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170109171623/http://lalo.nyc/">Lalo</a>, Chef Gerardo Gonzalez&apos;s new Chinatown restaurant. But brunch could be an easier get&#x2014;til it catches on&#x2014;when you can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170109171623/http://gothamist.com/2017/01/05/best_hangover_foods_nyc.php">cure a hangover</a> with dishes including Chilaquiles Breakfast Tacos on house-made flour tortillas, Vegan Cashew Grits with braised turnips, and Jasmine Donuts with salty chocolate. They&apos;re also doing brunch-type cocktails including a vegetal Green Eye Mimosa with cucumber, celery, serrano chili, lime, pineapple and cava, a Spanish wine.</p>

<p>Brunchy cocktails aren&apos;t limited to just the weekends, though, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170109171623/http://seabirdny.com/">Seabird</a> in the West Village now caters to those with non-traditional work weeks with bottomless brunch seven days a week. From 11 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., $17 buys you 1.5 hours to drink as many mimosas as you&apos;d like, including flavored iterations like peach, pomegranate and pineapple. Soak up all the champagne with hearty seafood dishes including Lobster Grilled Cheese, Short Rib Hash or a Crispy Fish Burger.</p>

<p>On Sunday, SoHo&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170109171623/http://gothamist.com/2016/12/22/best_new_restaurants_2016.php">outstanding</a> new restaurant <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170109171623/http://www.altroparadiso.com/">Cafe Altro Paradiso</a> takes part in Bon App&#xE9;tit&apos;s &quot;Family Meal&quot; fundraising series. Named for the meal shared by restaurant staff prior to opening for the day, this weekend&apos;s series benefits the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170109171623/http://justicecorps.org/">Immigrant Justice Corps</a>, a group that provides legal services to those seeking citizenship or fighting deportation. Chef Ignacio Mattos will be putting on a &quot;Standing Cocktail Party with Latin Brunch&quot; from noon until 2 p.m.; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170109171623/https://www.eventbrite.com/e/family-meal-a-fundraising-event-series-with-bon-appetit-tickets-29488429687#tickets">tickets $80</a>.</p>
