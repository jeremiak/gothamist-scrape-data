<p>The singing telegram industry is alive and well in New York City, proof of the timeless joy of embarrassing a friend, family member or colleague. A search of companies operating locally brought us to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108031433/http://www.bigapplesingingtelegrams.com/">Big Apple Singing Telegrams</a>, a business that&apos;s been delivering personalized &apos;grams since the late &apos;70s. The company has been under the auspices of Jon Shipley since 2000, where it&apos;s grown to include dozens of different costumes, songs and performers, many of whom have been in the business for several decades.  </p>
