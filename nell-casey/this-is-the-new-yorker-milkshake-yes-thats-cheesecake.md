<p>Take a look at The New Yorker Shake, a strawberry &quot;Crazy Shake&quot;&#x2014;the parlance they use to describe...<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171015144913/https://www.instagram.com/p/BPyLVtjFlNE/?taken-by=blacktapnyc&amp;hl=en">stuff like this</a>&#x2014;rimmed with vanilla frosting and graham crackers and capped off with a slice of Junior&apos;s Strawberry Cheesecake and a jaunty dollop of whipped cream. Is it still a milkshake when you need to employ a fork to eat said milkshake? Questions for future generations. </p>

<p>During the first weekend of March (3/3/-3/5), all locations of Black Tap and two Junior&apos;s locations in NYC (the Brooklyn flagship and Times Square) will offer the shake. If you can agree to part with $19 (a regular slice at Junior&apos;s is about $8, for reference), this sip and slice of future heart disease can be <em>yours. </em></p>
