<p>The Stanley Tucci film <em>Big Night</em> put timpano, an elaborate baked pasta dish, on the map and now <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171015141741/http://www.leftbanknewyork.com/">Left Bank</a> in the West Village is putting it on your plate. The restaurant begins a Sunday Timpano Supper series next weekend, offering up a previously private menu item for the populace.</p>

<p>For the uninitiated, watch this scene from the 1996 food film classic to get you up to speed. I&apos;ll wait.</p>

<p>Left Bank&apos;s version, which they&apos;ve been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171015141741/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/06/enjoy_some_end_of_the_world_timpano.php">offering on a limited basis</a> for years, includes fresh garganelli, meatballs, pork sausage, spinach, broccoli rabe, prosciutto cottoo, sopressata, mozzarella, fresh ricotta, aged provolone, hardboiled eggs, and tomato sauce. That whole mess of ingredients is encased in pasta, baked in a cast iron enameled &quot;basin&quot; and then sliced like a cake. </p>
