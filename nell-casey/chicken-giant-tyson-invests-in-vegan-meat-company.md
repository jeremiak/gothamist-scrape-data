<p>Soy-based products mimicking the texture and flavor of meat&#x2014;even going so far <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170324214511/http://gothamist.com/2016/07/26/david_chang_bloody_veg_burger.php">as to &quot;bleed&quot;</a>&#x2014;are a booming business and traditional meat companies want a piece. Yesterday, Tyson Foods Inc., known primarily as a chicken producer, bought a small stake in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170324214511/http://beyondmeat.com/">Beyond Meat</a>, which makes the plant-based &quot;Beyond Burger&quot; in addition to other vegan faux meat products.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170324214511/http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-tysons-beyond-meat-20161010-snap-story.html">Los Angeles Times</a> reports that Tyson bought a 5% share in the company, whose products are distributed in over 7,500 stores across the United States. &quot;I&apos;m pleased to welcome Tyson as an investor and look forward to leveraging this support to broaden availability of plant protein choices to consumers,&quot; Beyond Meat founder Ethan Brown said in a statement. </p>

<p>While this small stake means Beyond Meat remains predominantly independent, it could equal a big new market for the California-based company with a name like Tyson behind it. For Tyson, it&apos;s an opportunity to cash in on a market that&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170324214511/http://www.foodnavigator-usa.com/Markets/Vegan-is-going-mainstream-trend-data-suggests">seeing a big boost</a> as consumers shift their diets to include less meat&#x2014;at least <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170324214511/http://gothamist.com/tags/vegan">in major cities</a>. The Plant Based Foods Association noted <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170324214511/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/11/business/tyson-foods-a-meat-leader-invests-in-protein-alternatives.html?_r=0">$4.9 billion in sales</a> for its members from 2015-2016. </p>

<p>And apparently, watching the sausage get made looks the same whether it&apos;s meat or soy: &quot;The similarity between what we were doing and they were doing in making sausage was eye-opening,&quot; Brown says of a visit to Hillshire, which is owned by Tyson. &#x201C;It could have easily been our fat and our protein moving through that system with little distinction that a consumer would see.&quot;</p>
