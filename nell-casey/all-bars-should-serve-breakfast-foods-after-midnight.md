<p>Breakfast: either the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016144826/http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/magazine/2014/10/why-eating-the-right-breakfast-is-so-important/index.htm">most important</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016144826/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/08/10/the-science-of-skipping-breakfast-how-government-nutritionists-may-have-gotten-it-wrong/">least important</a> but arguably most delicious meal of the day&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016144826/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/25/breakfast_saved_mcdonalds.php">whenever that may be</a>. Post-college, breakfast foods were the go-to drunchie satisfier at the diner&#x2014;and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016144826/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/11/brunch_was_once_a_belittled_word.php">certainly the next morning</a>&#x2014;so <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016144826/http://www.boilermakernyc.com/">Boilermaker</a>, the East Village spot <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016144826/http://gothamist.com/2014/09/24/boilermaker_east_village.php#photo-1">rocking shots and beers</a> are adding breakfast dishes to their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016144826/http://gothamist.com/2014/12/11/best_new_bars_2014_nyc.php">food and drink lineup</a> with a Midnight Pancake program launching week after next. </p>

<p>It&apos;s a great innovation for those of us who can stay up past midnight (just wait, youngin&apos;s): get your drunk food fix while keeping the night going. The Boilermaker kitchen&apos;ll be griddling up pancakes that go beyond traditional diner offerings, like three-stacks of Red Velvet, S&apos;mores and Apple Pie (all $10) and a savory Potato ($10) topped with sour cream, in addition to a traditional Buttermilk ($8). All the sweet ones come up maple syrup or house-made butterscotch sauce, plus whipped cream for two more quarters.</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="060216boilermaker2.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016144826im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_nellcasey/060216boilermaker2.jpeg" width="640" height="427"> <br> <i> (Paul Wagtouicz)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>They&apos;re already doing a superlative burger, so post-midnights now include a different kind of sandwich on a potato bun: an Egg Sandwich (with any style of eggs) with truffle aioli for just $5. Add on cheese or bacon ($1) or sausage ($2), or get meats as a side ($4 and $5, respectively). One can also get a jump on brunch by ordering a House Mimosa ($11) with sparkling wine, OJ, curacao, grapefruit bitters and Citadelle London Dry Gin. Or just more shots and beers&#x2014;save the relief cocktails <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016144826/http://gothamist.com/2016/05/19/sunday_morning_drinking.php">for when you really need them</a>.</p>
