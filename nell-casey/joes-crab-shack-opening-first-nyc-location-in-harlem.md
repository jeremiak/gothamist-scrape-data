<p>Another national chain claws its way into the NYC market next week when <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928011923/http://joesseafoodshack.com/">Joe&apos;s Crab Shack</a> opens its doors on Frederick Douglass Boulevard and 125th Street. It&apos;s the first location of the Texas-based seafood chain to arrive in the city, bringing its signature Steampots and other crustaceous crocks of questionable freshness. </p>

<p>The 10,000-square foot restaurant opens on Tuesday at 11 a.m. with special deals for first-day diners. The first 100 people in line get vouchers redeemable for a free Snow Crab Bucket every month for a year and everyone who Eats At Joe&apos;s on opening day can enter to win free crab for LIFE. Just think how popular that would make you when Aunt Margene comes to town! The grand opening also doubles as a fundraiser for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928011923/http://www.autismspeaks.org/">Autism Speaks</a>, where donations are rewarded with coupons for Crab Nachos and Key Lime Pie. </p>

<p>So Harlem&apos;s transformation into Times Square II continues full steam ahead. That <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928011923/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/09/red_lobster_stretching_its_claws_to.php">long-rumored Red Lobster</a> still might <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928011923/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/uptown/joe-crab-shack-open-harlem-article-1.1406735">open up next door</a> to Harlem&apos;s famed Apollo Theater, so Joe&apos;s will have a little competition in the tank. But at least nobody is resorting to tasteless commercials to draw in customers. </p>
