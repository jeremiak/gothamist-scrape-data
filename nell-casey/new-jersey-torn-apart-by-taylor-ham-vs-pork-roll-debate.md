<p>New Jersey&apos;s a fascinating place, full of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110102614/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/26/christie_demon-free_3_hours.php">fascinating people</a> who argue over <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110102614/http://gothamist.com/2015/11/29/man_allegedly_assaulted_roommate_fo.php">fascinating things</a>. The latest state debate? What the processed, pork-based breakfast meat popular on egg sandwiches should be called: Taylor ham or pork roll. </p>

<p>The deliberations began in the Legislature, who were trying to determine the state&apos;s official sandwich, an egg and cheese sandwich with either pork roll or Taylor ham. &quot;In the north, people call it Taylor ham. Pork roll is the more generic name for it. We are voting for what to pick,&quot; Assemblyman Tim Eustace, the man pushing for the BEC designation, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110102614/http://www.wsj.com/articles/new-jersey-is-in-a-pickle-over-pork-sandwich-1462576656">explained to the Wall Street Journal</a>. Eustace has since <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110102614/https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1WoaMnuR5QwvOeeXsscd1aKbKXh3LyOOhGtoksUNzrgM/viewform?c=0&amp;w=1">launched an online survey</a> so NJ residents can weigh in on their desired method of sodium and cholesterol consumption. God, at least it&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110102614/http://gothamist.com/2014/10/15/yogurt_is_not_a_snack.php">not fucking yogurt</a>. </p>

<p>In the 1850s, a state senator, John Taylor, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110102614/http://www.nj.com/mercer/index.ssf/2016/05/salty_pork_roll_vs_taylor_ham_debate_may_rest_in_p.html#incart_most-comments">created Taylor&apos;s Prepared Ham</a>, which was later forced to change its name for not meeting the definition of ham as outlined by the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906. A butcher named George Washington Case put together his own version of the pork product in the 1870s, later becoming the Case Pork Roll Co. </p>

<p>&quot;It&#x2019;s fierce and filthy,&quot; another pork roll company owner said of the name rivalry. &quot;If there&apos;s going to be a state sandwich, it should absolutely be pork roll,&quot; Kate Kelly posited. &quot;But I wouldn&#x2019;t want to see a lot of debating or taxpayer money wasted on this.&quot; Time to bring in an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110102614/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/01/and_yr_picinik_basket.php">impartial arbiter</a>. </p>
