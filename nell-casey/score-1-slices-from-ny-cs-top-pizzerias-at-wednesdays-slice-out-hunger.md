The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171015170500/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/08/waiting_for_pizzagodot.php#photo-9">super popular</a> annual pizza party brings together a Who&apos;s Who list of the NYC pizza scene&#x2014;there are 56 pizzerias participating this year&#x2014;who sell slices of their cheesy, carby gold for just $1 each. In turn, all the money collected from the event benefits <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171015170500/https://www.cityharvest.org/">City Harvest</a> and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171015170500/http://www.foodbanknyc.org/">Food Band for New York City</a>. </p>

<p>The event&apos;s thrown by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171015170500/http://gothamist.com/2014/12/02/scott_wiener_pizza_expert.php">pizza expert</a> and founder of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171015170500/http://www.scottspizzatours.com/">Scott&apos;s Pizza Tours</a> Scott Wiener.

<p>Lines start to form around the block prior to the 6 p.m. opening, so it&apos;s always advisable to negotiate early release from work for 9 to 5ers or tap a ringer in your friend group to post up early. Upon entry, purchase $1 tickets (cash only), choose red tickets (slices; limit of 10) or blue tickets (drinks, desserts and raffle), pick up your special pizza box, and begin to work your way through the line. You can only get a single slice from each pizzeria, so plan accordingly or sharpen your bargaining skills now.</p>

<p><em>St. Anthony&apos;s Church, 155 Sullivan Street. Free to enter or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171015170500/https://secure.squarespace.com/commerce/donate?donatePageId=55e71a17e4b08a87a1930f63">purchase</a> a VIP ticket ($100) that enables you and a friend to skip the line</em></p>
