<p>The raw cheese recall tied to a listeria outbreak that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170318143552/http://gothamist.com/2017/03/09/vulto_creamery_listeria.php">killed two people</a> has been expanded. On Saturday Vulto Creamery&#x2014;whose Ouleout cheese was found to be the source of the outbreak&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170318143552/https://www.fda.gov/Safety/Recalls/ucm546133.htm">voluntarily expanded</a> the recall to include four additional cheeses: Andes, Blue Blais, Hamden and Walton Umber. This brings the total recall number up to eight cheeses. In response to the updated recall, Whole Foods also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170318143552/https://www.fda.gov/Safety/Recalls/ucm546358.htm">expanded its recall</a> of the cheeses from stores in New York, New Jersey and Massachusetts. </p>

<p>At least one lawsuit has been filed so far, after a Vermont man died from eating the contaminated cheese. The widow of Richard Friedman, who died of a stroke in November of last year, has sued Vulto Creamery for alleged wrongful death in addition to emotional and financial damage following the death of her husband. </p>

<p>&quot;People think of food poisoning as inconvenient rather than really dangerous,&quot; Bill Marler, a food safety attorney representing Mrs. Friedman, said in a statement. &quot;But the reality is that what you eat can seriously damage or even kill you. Food providers have a responsibility to protect the lives of their customers, especially when producing raw milk products, which pose a higher risk to consumers.&quot;</p>

<p>Ouleout is a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170318143552/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/14/american_cheeses.php">popular selection</a> among cheese cognoscenti, and has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170318143552/http://www.grubstreet.com/2017/03/whole-foods-recalls-more-jos-vulto-raw-cheeses.html">appeared on the menu</a> at lauded restaurants including Gramercy Tavern. </p>
