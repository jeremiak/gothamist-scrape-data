<p>Midtown&apos;s excellent ramen spot <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171010182014/http://www.hidechanramen.nyc/#about-marquee">Hide-Chan</a> appears to be doubling its NYC presence with a second location opening this spring in Hell&apos;s Kitchen. The noodle pushers are bringing their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171010182014/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/31/ramen_war_who_makes_the_ultimate_bo.php">excellent Hakata kuro ramen</a> and the rest to 53rd between 8th and 9th, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171010182014/https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20160126/hells-kitchen-clinton/totto-ramen-owner-is-bringing-new-noodle-joint-hells-kitchen">reports DNAinfo</a>, and the restaurant has appealed for a liquor license with the community board and SLA. </p>

<p>Owner Bobby Munekata also operates several outposts of Totto Ramen, one of which is directly underneath the east side Hide-Chan. Upstairs, the Spicy Garlic Ramen ($12) draws crowds&#x2014;there&apos;s almost always a line of people waiting on the stairs&#x2014;for the black slick of charred black garlic oil atop a bowl of milky, porky tonkotsu broth. Hide-Chan offers the ability to customize both noodle firmness and the intensity of the broth itself; if you go full &quot;rich,&quot; be prepared to wear a layer of pork fat lipstick the rest of the night. </p>

<p>There are half a dozen other ramen options, plus appetizers including bao, takoyaki, fried chicken and dumplings. If the fat content of the ramen isn&apos;t high enough, indulge in their ridiculous (but delicious) Cheese Gyoza, where the tiny pork purses are coated in a thick layer of broiled cheese.</p>
