<p>Tonight&#x2014;you either already know or really don&apos;t care to know&#x2014;the Kansas Jayhawks take on the Kentucky Wildcats in the NCAA Championship game. And if you can stay up late enough (tip off is at 9:23 p.m.) there are a few spots around town offering deals to hoops fans. Lost all your money on a bracket with LIU Brooklyn going <em>all the way</em>? A boozehound on a budget? Head to one of these spots for some treats on the cheap.</p>

<p>Park Slope pup purveyor <a href="barkhotdogs.com">Bark Hot Dogs</a> forgoes the frankfurter and offers a $2 Bark Burger (normally $6.25) to anyone who mentions &quot;Bark Madness.&quot; And if basketball puts you in a fowl mood, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120403103219/http://lansdowneroadnyc.com/">Lansdowne Road</a> and the East Village outpost of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120403103219/http://downtownnyc.villagepourhouse.com/">Village Pourhouse</a> are both frying up $.50 hot wings, as well as deals on America&apos;s &quot;finest&quot; brew: Bud Lite. The sudsy swill will set you back $4 a pint at Lansdowne and $12 a pitcher at the Pourhouse. </p>

<p>And finally, if you&apos;re just looking to get buzzed on the cheap, Midtown pub <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120403103219/http://jackdemseys.com/index.html">Jack Demsey&apos;s</a>&#x2014;the self-proclaimed home of the Kentucky Wildcats&#x2014;will pour $10 pitchers of beer in their upstairs bar area. </p>
