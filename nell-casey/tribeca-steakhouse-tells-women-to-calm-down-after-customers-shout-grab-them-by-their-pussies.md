<p>Three women walking past the Tribeca location of Wolfgang&apos;s Steakhouse say they were verbally harassed with President-elect Trump&apos;s (that&apos;s not getting any easier!) infamous &quot;grab them by the pussies&quot; statement by three men smoking outside the restaurant. Lindsay Means <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021221531/https://twitter.com/lindsaymeans/status/797450202923708420">recounted the incident on Twitter</a> Saturday morning, revealing that following the men&apos;s outburst, staff at the restaurant told Means and her friends to &quot;calm down&quot; because these were &quot;good guys.&quot;</p>

<p>One of the smoking dudes even called her &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021221531/https://twitter.com/lindsaymeans/status/797450202923708420">darling</a>.&quot; Ugh.</p>

<p>Means told Tribeca Citizen, which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021221531/http://tribecacitizen.com/2016/11/12/yes-it-can-happen-here/">first reported the story</a>, that she eventually received a response from the restaurant&apos;s manager, who apologized, explaining the patrons were &quot;drunk out of their minds&quot; but admitted that was &quot;not an excuse.&quot; The manager also offered Means and her friends a complimentary meal or gift certificate, which Means turned down.</p>

<p>The restaurant finally publicly responded to the event last night:</p>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We&#x2019;ve reviewed what occurred Friday night at our TriBeCa location and spent today internally addressing how it was handled by our team.</p>&#x2014; WOLFGANGS STEAKHOUSE (@Wolfgangssteak) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021221531/https://twitter.com/Wolfgangssteak/status/798345248917295104">November 15, 2016</a></blockquote>

On Saturday night, a woman was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021221531/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/14/bar_tabac_trump_supporter_attack.php">punched in the face</a> by a Trump supporter at a Brooklyn restaurant. </p>
