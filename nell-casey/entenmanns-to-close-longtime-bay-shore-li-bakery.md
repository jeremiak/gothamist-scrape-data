<p>Supermarket baked goods masters Entenmenn&apos;s have announced they will <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150409131421/http://www.newsday.com/business/entenmann-s-closing-bay-shore-bakery-cutting-178-jobs-1.7523696">close their longtime Bay Shore bakery</a> on Long Island, according to a release by parent company Bimbo Bakeries USA. Sales and distribution operations will continue at the site but 178 of the facility&apos;s 265 will lose their jobs with the bakery closure, according to Newsday</p>

<p>&quot;This was a difficult decision because of the highly engaged team of associates at this bakery,&quot; explained vice president of metro area operations Rod Cunha. &quot;However, after a critical assessment, it was apparent that the facility, first opened in 1961, cannot operate efficiently on a cost competitive basis with the other bakeries in our system.&quot;</p>

<p>The plant has operated out of the Bay Shore area since 1905, eventually expanding to the current 14-acre plant on Fifth Avenue. The original bakery was started in Brooklyn in 1895 by William Entenmann, who had emigrated from Germany. The company <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150409131421/https://www.facebook.com/Entenmanns/posts/10152255506245155?stream_ref=10">posted a message on Facebook</a> announcing the closure, insisting there would be &quot;no interruption to the availability, quality or freshness of the Entenmann&#x2019;s products you know and love.&quot; Local fans expressed sadness over the news, with one expressing sadness on the loss of a &quot;true symbol and smell.&quot;</p>
