<p>Like that one friend whose parents let you drink in their basement, a turkey farmer from New Hampshire lets his flock binge drink on lager. Joe Morette, a poultry man from <strike>Heineken</strike> Henniker, NH discovered his fowl&apos;s predilection for beer when a clumsy bird knocked over a can of suds he and his workers were enjoying on a hot July evening. The bird eagerly lapped up the cool brew and the rest, as they say, is tipsy turkey history.</p>

<p>Morette began the brewski diet back in 1993, serving the birds Coors before switching up to a heartier lager. Besides the supposed enjoyment the turkeys get tying one on each day, Morette claims the resulting meat has more flavor. &quot;Oh, yeah, it&apos;s noticeable,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131111050758/http://www.greenwichcitizen.com/news/us/article/Tipsy-turkeys-NH-birds-fed-beer-for-flavor-size-4966388.php#photo-5433758">he told the Associated Press</a>. &quot;It&apos;s not a strong, gamey flavor, it&apos;s a nice turkey flavor.&quot; Longtime customers like Dan Bourque agree: &quot;We find the gravy is much darker, and much tastier,&quot; he said. &quot;The bird overall has a slightly different taste that is very appealing.&quot;</p>

<p>An all-beer diet sounds pretty great to us, but can it really be healthy for the birdies? Predictably, PETA isn&apos;t down with the drunk turkey diet, but a field specialist in food and agriculture with the University of New Hampshire Cooperative Extension has a more relaxed outlook. &quot;I imagine it&apos;s not enough to really make &apos;em tipsy or anything like that,&quot; opines cool dude Carl Majewski. &quot;It&apos;s just enjoying a beer with their meal. Why not?&quot; Kathi Brock, national director of farm animal welfare group Humane Heartland, says an avian vet told her &quot;hops could be beneficial for the intestinal tract.&quot; Beer: the Activia for turkeys.</p>

<p>This year, Morette has about 50 tippling turkeys bound for the Thanksgiving table in a few weeks. So is the farm like a frat house during rush week? &quot;Turkeys don&apos;t seem to be the brightest,&quot; explains Morette. &quot;So they could stumble and you wouldn&apos;t know if they drank too much or not.&quot; Go home turkeys, you&apos;re drunk.</p>
