										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="080813ramenburger.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509193801im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_nellcasey/080813ramenburger.jpg" width="640" height="479"> <br> <i> <span class="photo_caption">(<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509193801/http://www.flickr.com/photos/scottlynchnyc/">Scott Lynch</a> / Gothamist)</span></i></div> <p></p>

<p>Following the success of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509193801/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/04/photos_ramen_burgers_with_secret_sa.php#photo-1">last weekend&apos;s debut</a>, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509193801/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/01/100_ramen_burgers_coming_to_smorgas.php">Ramen Burger</a> makes a triumphant return to Smorgasburg this weekend and this time there&apos;s double the amount of noodly goodness. Burger innovator Keizo Shimamoto <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509193801/http://www.goramen.com/2013/08/smorgasburg-week-2-shoyu-ramen-burger.html">promises 300 burgers</a> at this Saturday&apos;s event.</p>

<p>Despite intermittent rain showers that lasted until midday, hundreds of people lined up to the debut burgers, though only 150 actually succeeded. Among them was photographer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509193801/http://www.flickr.com/photos/scottlynchnyc/">Scott Lynch</a>, who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509193801/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/04/photos_ramen_burgers_with_secret_sa.php#photo-1">enjoyed the burger</a> though thought he could use a little more heat.</p>

<p>Lynch also described the cramped cooking area, which only permitted two burgers worth of ramen &quot;buns&quot; to be cooked at one time. Hopefully Shimamoto has figured out an implementation plan for the increased burger output. Either way, expect another big line; at least it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509193801/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/07/sticky_showery_weather_for_the_rest.php">probably won&apos;t be raining</a> this time.</p>
