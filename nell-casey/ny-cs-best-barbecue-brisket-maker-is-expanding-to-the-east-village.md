										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="052715_brisket.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170625145953im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_rebeccaf/052715_brisket.jpg" width="640" height="427"> <br> <i> (Courtesy Matthew Kanbergs/Brisketlab)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>Though he&apos;s known for his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170625145953/http://gothamist.com/2015/05/28/best_bbq_nyc.php">exemplary manipulation of brisket</a>, Daniel Delaney of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170625145953/http://www.delaneybbq.com/">BrisketTown</a> spent much of last year (and undoubtably years before planning) the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170625145953/http://gothamist.com/2015/09/23/delaney_chicken_urbanspace_vanderbi.php">debut of his fried chicken concept</a>, Delaney Chicken, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170625145953/http://gothamist.com/2015/09/18/urbanspace_vanderbilt_food_hall.php#photo-1">inside UrbanSpace Vanderbilt</a>, the fancy new food hall outside Grand Central Terminal. But is the barbecue master returning to the meat of his origins? If some papers filed with the East Village&apos;s Community Board 3 are to be trusted, it appears so.</p>

<p>Next week, Delaney will appear before CB 3&apos;s liquor license committee to plead his case for a new concept he&apos;s looking to debut at 167 1st Avenue. Eater <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170625145953/http://ny.eater.com/2016/3/7/11175844/daniel-delaney-east-village-bbq">got hold of the filing</a> and spoke with Delaney, who demurred, saying the final menu might be different than what&apos;s in the hands of the Community Board.</p>

<p>The sample menu for the new spot is identical to the Williamsburg original in both items and pricing; of course, Delaney&apos;s brisket&#x2014;which I can vouch for wholeheartedly following a repeat visit a few weeks back&#x2014;is the star. </p>

<p>If he does debut the second BrisketTown in Manhattan, there&apos;ll be a bit of a BBQ rivalry going on. Mighty Quinn&apos;s, they of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170625145953/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/26/smorgasburg_vendor_denies_customers.php">Smorgasburg insanity</a>, among other things, operate a satellite location a few blocks away on 2nd Avenue. The MQ also does a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170625145953/http://gothamist.com/2015/08/05/mighty_quinns_fried_chicken_sandwic.php">fried chicken sandwich</a>, so if Delaney shifts gears towards poultry, he&apos;ll have both them and Fuku with which to contend.</p>
