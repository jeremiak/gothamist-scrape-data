</div></div><p>Greenpoint will get some irresistibly flaky confections when pie makers Cheryl Perry and Felipa Lopez plant their roots on Driggs Avenue this summer, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120517160312/http://greenpointers.com/2012/05/16/pie-corps-is-coming-to-town/">reports Greepointers</a>. The popular <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120517160312/http://www.piecorps.com/">Pie Corps</a> has already been peddling their pastries on Saturdays and Sundays at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120517160312/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/15/the_hester_street_fair_brings_twili.php">Hester Street Fair</a> and <a href="www.newamsterdammarket.org">New Amsterdam Market</a>, respectively, but this will be their first brick-and-mortar outpost. The ladies took to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120517160312/http://www.luckyant.com/">Lucky Ant</a>, a crowdfunding site not unlike Kickstarter, to gather donations to fund the move and also purchase a new oven to increase their pie making abilities. The campaign worked and now they are almost ready to open their bakeshop and cafe.</p>

<p>Pies will come in a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120517160312/http://www.piecorps.com/shop">variety of sweet and savory options</a> with ingredients sourced from a multitude of New York farms. Some classics get an update, like a traditional apple crumb pie with a sweet whiskey sauce and chocolate pudding pie with a rosemary caramel. You can also channel your camping days with s&apos;mores pie or snack on whimsical &quot;Pie Pops&quot; on a stick for an on-the-go option. Don&apos;t worry if you don&apos;t have a sweet tooth, you can also fill up on horseradish beet galette or a caramelized onion and goat cheese hand pie instead. If you simply cannot wait until June to stuff your pie hole&#x2014;or don&apos;t like fighting the crowds at food markets&#x2014;Pie Corps will deliver anywhere in the five boroughs for orders over $75. </p>

<p>It&apos;s great to see local businesses succeed through support from their neighbors and know that these types of crowdfunding campaigns work&#x2014;next up, let&apos;s focus our efforts on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120517160312/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/09/artisan_anchovy_makers_bonchovie_ne.php">Bon Chovie anchovies!</a></p>
