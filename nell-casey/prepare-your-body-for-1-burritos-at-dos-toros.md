<p>Knowing that what the city needs right now is a cheap burrito baby to call its very own, there&apos;s an opportunity for $1 burritos happening next Tuesday. Dos Toros continues their tradition of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170307101515/http://gothamist.com/2015/05/05/dos_toros_1_burritos.php">cheap food for new locations</a> March 7th, offering the buck burritos all day at their new Flatiron restaurant at 668 6th Avenue from 1:30-2:30 p.m. and again from 5 - 8 p.m.</p>

<p>The location serves as a test kitchen of sorts for the chain, too, where they&apos;ll serve proprietary new options to determine what ends up on the menu at the rest of the locations. This includes more vegetarian items, we&apos;re told. Is it finally <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170307101515/http://gothamist.com/2014/02/27/chipotle_tofu_finally_arrives_in_ny.php#photo-1">Tofu Time</a> for Dos Toros?</p>
