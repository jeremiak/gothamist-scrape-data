<p>Popular outdoor food market <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131001224743/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/16/hester_street_fair_back_in_action_s.php#photo-1">Hester Street Fair</a> has found a permanent <em>indoor</em> home inside the New Museum on the Bowery. The Hester Street Cafe opens tomorrow inside the swanky contemporary art museum and will serve selections from its curated list of small businesses that operate inside the LES park during the warmer months.</p>

<p>The menu shifts with the seasons but count on coffee from Intelligentsia and baked goods from Cafe Grumpy. Duck&apos;s Eatery came up with the opening menu, which includes a vegetable heavy &quot;Market&quot; sandwich with zucchini, tomato, mushrooms and Marscarpone and other baguette sandwiches. A kale salad with roasted cauliflower and hazelnut and a simple cafe salad round out the savory options. Melt Bakery also provides two of their tasty ice cream sandwiches. </p>

<p><em>The Hester Street Caf&#xE9; at the New Museum is open Wednesday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. and Thursdays from 11 a.m. to 9 p.m.</em></p>
