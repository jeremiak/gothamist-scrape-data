<p>Chef Grant Achatz and Nick Kokonas are bringing their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170308225057/http://chicagoist.com/2014/07/20/its_official_chicago_has_the_best_n.php">award-winning</a> cocktail concept out of Chicago and into NYC. The Alinea Group will <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170308225057/http://www.mandarinoriental.com/media/press-releases/new-york-aviary-nyc-announcement.aspx">open another location</a> of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170308225057/http://www.aviarynyc.com/">The Aviary</a> inside the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170308225057/http://www.mandarinoriental.com/">Mandarin Oriental</a> on the hotel&apos;s 35th floor. This will likely be the toughest reservation since...<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170308225057/http://gothamist.com/2012/08/29/reservations_for_647_dinner_by_chic.php">Achatz and co. were last in NYC</a>.</p>

<p>This is also the first time I&apos;ve seen a &quot;Coming Soon: Bar&quot; trailer, so there&apos;s that.</p>

<p>&quot;The planning has taken over three years,&quot; Kokonas <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170308225057/http://www.chicagotribune.com/dining/ct-aviary-bar-new-york-city-alinea-group-story.html">told the Chicago Tribue</a>. &quot;It&apos;s very challenging to redesign such a space and, further, to do the construction while the hotel continues to operate.&quot;</p>

<p>Expect some <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170308225057/https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-aviary-chicago-2?select_video=1fSdlZCeTZfKaMTTv4yASw">serious cocktail wizardry</a>&#x2014;along with dope views into Central Park&#x2014;and Achatz&apos;s food. The Chicago version <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170308225057/http://chicagoist.com/2013/11/07/the_aviary_starts_ticket_sales_and.php">employs a ticketing system</a> (they still take walk-ins) so maybe they&apos;ll do the same here, though it&apos;s not mentioned in the current information available to press. They&apos;ll definitely be operating The Office, an exclusive bar-within-the-bar speakeasy that requires a key.</p>
