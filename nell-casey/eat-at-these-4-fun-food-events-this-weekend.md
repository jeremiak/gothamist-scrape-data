<p>Have a nose for rose? Can you pick a pinot just by taste? Find out at the <strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150409131424/http://www.craftrestaurantsinc.com/craft-new-york/news/blind-wine-tasting-dinner-march-28/">Craft Blind Wine Dinner</a></strong>, where the wine director at Craft restaurant&apos;s private dining room (47 East 19th Street) tests your knowledge of vino with a blind taste test. Diners sip eight wines while also enjoying a four-course meal with dishes like agnolotti with ricotta cheese and ramps (!) and spring lamb with asparagus and morels. The two diners who identify the most wines win an as-yet-unnamed prize. Check out wine director Greg Majors on Twitter (@GregDMajors) for some clues before the event. The dinner begins Friday night at 7 p.m.; email Mejken Poore (mpoore@craftrestaurant.com) to secure your $125 seat.</p>
