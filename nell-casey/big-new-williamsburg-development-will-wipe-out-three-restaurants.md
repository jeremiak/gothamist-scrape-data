<p>Thor Equities, perhaps most notable for bringing their hammer down <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160803050428/http://gothamist.com/tags/thorequities">on Coney Island</a>, are eliminating three Williamsburg restaurants in one fell swoop with the introduction of a new mixed-use building opening in the ever condo-fied neighborhood. A new residential and retail building will be popping up at North 6th and Berry Street sometime in the near future, razing Baoburg, Ramen Yebisu and Chai Thai in the process. All three restaurants are currently still open, but the developers have seen fit to completely obscure them behind a sad plywood-and-metal sidewalk shed prison in advance of their demise.</p>

<p>Representatives for Thor declined to discuss the development, but renderings on-site reveal a glass monstrosity that&apos;ll totally gel with Berry Street&apos;s low skyline and mostly modest storefronts. They&apos;re currently in search of retail or restaurant clients to fill the space when it&apos;s built, though those plans do not seem to include any of the restaurants currently occupying the site.</p>

<p>Ramen Yebisu already operates a Park Slope location, so their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160803050428/https://www.instagram.com/p/2rwqxOEoNO/?taken-by=nellcasey">excellent Miso Ramen</a> won&apos;t be gone completely, and there&apos;s a Chai Thai in midtown. Baoburg is also currently working on a Greenpoint location on Manhattan Avenue, which they say will focus on noodle soups, dumplings and different types of buns in an Asian-Spanish fusion. Their new space will also boast a backyard. </p>
