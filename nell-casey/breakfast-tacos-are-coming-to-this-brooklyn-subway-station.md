<p>We have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110095137/http://gothamist.com/2015/07/30/the_best_tacos_in_nyc_1.php">traditional tacos</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110095137/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/02/secret_korean_tacos_nyc.php">secret tacos</a> and even <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110095137/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/07/hard_shell_tacos_nyc_1.php">crunchy tacos</a> but NYC has an appalling dearth of breakfast tacos, the Texas hangover staple. A few places have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110095137/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/16/whirlybird_brings_breakfast_tacos_t.php#photo-1">made a go of it</a> but there&apos;s a full-time breakfast taco situation unfolding over in Brooklyn Heights, where <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110095137/http://www.jalapajar.com/">Jalapa Jar</a> is nearly ready to start selling the egg vehicles in a kiosk inside the Clark Street subway 2/3 station. This is the most exciting food story to come out of a subway station since the Pizza Rat <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110095137/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/07/journalism.php">hoax</a>.</p>

<p>Cousins Steve Smith and Tommy Byrnes began what&apos;s actually a salsa company last year and have been selling both their jarred salsas and breakfast tacos at Smorgasburg since October, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110095137/http://brooklynheightsblog.com/archives/79871">they told the Brooklyn Heights Blog</a>. Following some successful <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110095137/http://www.jalapajar.com/index.php/locating-the-jalapa/">pop-up trials</a>, the duo&#x2014;along with two Texas-based business partners&#x2014;will open up a breakfast taco stand at 100 Henry Street in Brooklyn Heights, in a kiosk just outside the turnstiles. </p>

They&apos;ll be doing true Tex-Mex tacos at the kiosk, starting with a base of eggs and other additional toppings like bacon, cheese, chorizo, refried beans and even garlic mashed potatoes. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s all about the mush,&#x201D; Byrnes <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110095137/http://www.bkmag.com/2016/06/06/breakfast-taco-texan-obsession-comes-brooklyn/">explained to Brooklyn Magazine</a>, describing the soft texture they&apos;re looking for with each taco. Once again, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110095137/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/08/mothership_meat_company_astoria.php">avert your gaze</a>, true Texans, as the team&apos;s using softly fried <em>corn</em> tortillas for their tacos instead of the more traditional flour. <em>(Edit: Byrnes tells us they&apos;ll be using flour tortillas, too!)</em>
<br><br>
In addition to the savory tacos, there&apos;s something called &quot;Sweet Sticks&quot; in the works, which are mashed plantains with jalapenos rolled into a tortilla and topped with brown sugar and maple syrup. The kiosk will also offer coffee from Austin-based Summer Moon, who roast their beans over an oak wood fire. And if they <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110095137/https://www.instagram.com/p/BFom-4SO7i4/?taken-by=jalapajar">serve this queso</a> I will scream. 
<br><br>
Byrnes tells us they hope to soft open at the end of the month&#x2014;construction began on the 120-square-foot space this week. The kiosk will be in the arcade underneath the St. George Hotel that also doubles as an entrance to the subway. To start, they&apos;ll be open 6 a.m. to 7 p.m., with expanded late-night hours possibly debuting in the fall.
