<p>Cocktails like the Aviation (pictured) start at $18 and run up to $25 with the John Campbell&apos;s Martini, made with Stoli Elit&#x2014;a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170615190928/http://www.complex.com/pop-culture/2012/11/most-expensive-vodkas/stoli-elit">$3,000 bottle of vodka</a>&#x2014;Carpano dry vermouth and olives. They&apos;ll also serve an $85 &quot;Rare&quot; Old Fashioned, made with Macallan &quot;Rare Cask&quot; Single Malt Scotch Whisky alongside other interpretations of classic cocktails including mules and negronis.</p>

<p>A limited menu of finger foods also debuts with the revamped bar. Snacks include Deviled Eggs ($12) and Spiced Roasted Nuts ($11), with more substantial offerings&#x2014;but still just &quot;a little bit more&quot;&#x2014;include Crispy Tuna Tartare Tacos ($18) and Mini Lobster Rolls ($23). </p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170615190928/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/10/campbell_apartment_grand_central.php#photo-1">historic space</a> was once the office of John W. Campbell and after his death went through many iterations that included a gun storage facility and a jail. Its contemporary history as a bar began in the late &apos;90s when it was reopened by Mark Grossich.
