<p>Feeling a little sluggish from <em>all this weather</em> we have going on? Good news: it&apos;s not only Friday, but it&apos;s National Coffee Day, and area chain restaurants are eager to give you a little pick me up, on them.</p><ul><li>If you don&apos;t mind smelling like fryer grease for the next few hours, <strong>McDonalds</strong> is giving away <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150720034905/https://twitter.com/McDNYTriState/status/251648872848424961">free, small &quot;Premium Roast&quot; coffees</a> all day. <br>
</li><li>While it&apos;s not exactly free, you can print out <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150720034905/https://www.dunkindonuts.com/content/dunkindonuts/en/dunkin_offers/dunkin_offers_4.html">this <strong>Dunkin Donuts</strong> coupon</a> and snag a small hot or iced Pumpkin Latte for just under a buck.</li><br>
<li>And if you&apos;re nearby one of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150720034905/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/23/7-eleven_aggressively_expanding_in.php">growing number</a> of <strong>7-Eleven</strong> stores around the city, they&apos;re offering a free large coffee to customers who mention the &quot;holiday.&quot; The deal was only supposed to last until 10 a.m. but a call to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150720034905/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/14/7_eleven_to_open_on_st_marks.php">St. Mark&apos;s location</a> revealed they&apos;ll keep it going &quot;a little while longer.&quot;</li><br>
</ul>In case you were wondering, Starbucks won&apos;t be celebrating the buzz today, so you&apos;ll have to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150720034905/http://gothamist.com/2012/08/08/starbucks_partners_with_mobile_paym.php">pay for your Venti Skinny Sugar Free Vanilla latte on your own</a>.<p></p>
