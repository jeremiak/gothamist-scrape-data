<p>Say goodbye to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427144844/http://gothamist.com/2013/12/26/we_leave_the_year_of_the_cronut_wit.php">peanut butter Cronut</a> and feast your eyes on the brand new beautiful raspberry-lychee February 2014 model, Dominique Ansel&apos;s offering come next month. The bakery tells us the pastry is stuffed with both raspberry confiture and lychee ganache and the glaze has freeze-dried raspberry bits mixed with lemon juice and dusted with lemon zest sugar. Sounds perfect for the year&apos;s most saccharine love-themed holiday! </p>

<p>Speaking of which, we&apos;re told that each Valentine&apos;s Day the bakery stocks its case with all pink pastries like grapefruit tarts, strawberry pavlovas and rose religieuse. It turns out that pink is Ansel&apos;s favorite color&#x2014;he&apos;s been known to rock pink socks on the regular&#x2014;so he goes all out for lover&apos;s day, including scattering pink rose petals around the bakery and cranking up love songs on the speaker system. Just remember: it&apos;s not true love unless they wait on line for the Cronut.</p>
