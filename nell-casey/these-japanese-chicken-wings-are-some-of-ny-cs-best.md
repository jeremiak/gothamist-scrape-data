<p>Like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016135723/http://gothamist.com/2015/06/23/actor_ate_something.php">Patrick Stewart</a>, chicken wings have usually been a source of confusion for me. I like chicken, I like spicy food, I like fried food, but undercooked skin and bone gristle have often put me off the cut and thus, they&apos;re not my <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016135723/http://gothamist.com/2014/04/14/yankees_nacho_helmet.php">go-to</a> pub grub order. But I&apos;ll usually make an exception for chicken wings of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016135723/http://gothamist.com/2015/07/01/chomp_chomp_singaporean_hawker_food.php#photo-1">Singaporean</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016135723/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/21/first_taste_of_whiskey_soda_lounge.php#photo-1">Thai</a> variety, and now, I&apos;ll make an exception for the Japanese variety, too.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016135723/http://www.mokumokubk.com/">Moku Moku</a> opened last summer in a conjoined twin relationship with its sister restaurant Momo Sushi Shack on Bushwick&apos;s Bogart Street. It&apos;s mainly a yakitori spot and the skewered meats and vegetables are good, if on the simpler side. It&apos;s in the chicken wings ($7) where the kitchen really shines, however, from the crunchy exterior to the sweet-and-salty glaze. Most importantly, at least for me, the chicken is cooked in such a way that the end bits are tender and fall off the bone without the delicate interior meat being desiccated by the hot oil.</p>

<p>Joshua Neiderer, General Manager of Moku Moku and Momo Sushi Shack, tells me a lot of the wings&apos; deliciousness begins with the sourcing. &quot;All of our chicken comes from heritage foods and hit all the key words you can think of (except vegan),&quot; he explains. &quot;They&apos;re hormone-free, humanely raised and slaughtered, and organic. We use primarily la belle rouge chickens, but will use other heritage breeds if sourcing becomes an issue.&quot;</p>

<p>From there, the wings and brined, then dredged in low-protein, instant Wondra flour and potato starch, both of which create a pebbly exterior with the crisp chicken skin and light batter. The finishing touch: a soy, sesame, garlic, mirin and sake sauce and a bed of crunchy cabbage to soak everything up. </p>
