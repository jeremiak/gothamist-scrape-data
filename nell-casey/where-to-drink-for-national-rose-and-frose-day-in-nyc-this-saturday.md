<p><em>Just in time to get unreasonably tipsy on a weekend comes <strong>National Ros&#xE9; Day</strong> on Saturday, June 10th. Personally, we&apos;ll be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170610160741/http://gothamist.com/2014/07/23/the_best_rose_for_your_buck_comes_i.php">bringing a box</a> to our nearest backyard and camping out, but some local bars and restaurants are also offering some deals for those interested. Here&apos;s where to get your ros&#xE9; (and fros&#xE9;) on this weekend.</em></p>

<p><strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170610160741/http://www.extrafancybklyn.com/">Extra Fancy</a></strong> in Williamsburg has a highbrow cocktail program for a place that channels a New England seafood shack, including their popular Froz&#xE9;monade, which they serve all year long. As the name might suggest, this is a ros&#xE9;-based offering, combined with lemonade and whipped into a frothy, frozen treat. It&apos;s tart, refreshing and disturbingly easy to drink, especially in their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170610160741/http://gothamist.com/2016/05/10/extra_fancy_outdoor_bar.php#photo-1">backyard bar</a>. <em>302 Metropolitan Avenue, Williamsburg</em></p>

<p>The Lower East Side location of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170610160741/http://pizzabeachclub.com/"><strong>Pizza Beach</strong></a> will be running a very special buy two get one free special that involves their version of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170610160741/https://www.instagram.com/p/BUUop_ElZ-b/?taken-by=pizzabeach&amp;hl=en">fros&#xE9;</a>. Stop by anytime during Saturday&apos;s celebrations and snag a free margherita pizza with the purchase of two frosty chalices of fros&#xE9;. <em>167 Orchard Street, LES</em></p>

<p>Chill Bed-Stuy bar <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170610160741/http://chilosbk.com/"><strong>Chilo&apos;s</strong></a> has a permanent taco truck attached to it, always a good thing, and two frozen drink machines constantly turning for the season. There are margaritas, of course, but they also do a tasty version of Froz&#xE9;, made with ros&#xE9; wine, fresh grapefruit, white rum and honey. Park yourself at a picnic bench out back and order up some huilacotche tacos, which we&apos;re told are some of the city&apos;s best. <em>323 Franklin Avenue, Bed-Stuy</em></p>

<p>Recently named one of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170610160741/http://www.playboy.com/articles/americas-top-bartenders-share-the-perfect-cocktails-for-day-drinking">best cocktails for day drinking</a>, the Strawberry Letter at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170610160741/https://www.thebennettbar.com/"><strong>The Bennett</strong></a> in Tribeca combines a shrub (strawberries, raspberry vinegar and sugar) with Aperol and ros&#xE9; vinho verde plus a splash of club soda for effervescence. It&apos;s as pretty as it is light, refreshing, tart and sweet. <em>134 West Broadway, Tribeca</em> </p>

<p>Little Italy&apos;s cocktail spot <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170610160741/https://mulberryproject.com/"><strong>Mulberry Project</strong></a> will be doing BOGO on fros&#xE9; beginning at 1 p.m. on Saturday. Purchase one glass of fros&#xE9; and they&apos;ll give you the next one on the house (remember to tip on both!). And with seasonal temperatures <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170610160741/http://gothamist.com/2017/06/08/summer_allegedly_here.php">finally arriving</a>, it&apos;s a great opportunity to chill in the bar&apos;s pretty backyard. <em>149 Mulberry Street, Little Italy</em></p>
