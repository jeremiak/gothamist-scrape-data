<p>If the name Marco Canora isn&apos;t immediately familiar to you, perhaps you know him better by the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108042921/http://gothamist.com/2014/10/31/east_village_broth_window.php">&quot;bone broth&quot; sensation</a> that sparked a nationwide movement into sippable animal juice. Though Canora&apos;s legacy will no doubt be intrinsically linked to his rebranding of stock, the chef&apos;s restaurants&#x2014;including the brodo incubator <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108042921/http://www.restauranthearth.com/">Hearth</a>&#x2014;have been destination spots all their own, which will no doubt apply to his latest venture, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108042921/http://www.zadiesoysterroom.com/">Zadie&apos;s Oyster Room</a>.</p>

<p>Zadie&apos;s is actually a rebrand and refocus of Canora&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108042921/http://gothamist.com/2015/02/19/fifty_paces_lamb_sausage.php#photo-1">Fifty Paces wine bar</a>, which was itself a retooling of Canora&apos;s Terroir on East 12th. In his third time&apos;s the charm effort, Canora&apos;s kicking it old school with one of NYC&apos;s most historic critters: the oyster.</p>

<p>The small food menu&#x2014;which is dwarfed by a much larger wine and beer list&#x2014;offers the bivalves in myriad states, from the rote raw form popular with happy hour goers to more eclectic preparations like pickled and poached. A baked version ($9.75) is fortified with ham, egg, leeks and seaweed butter with the fried option ($9.75) is flavored with fennel, dulse, garlic and lemon. </p>

<p>A small list of &quot;Other Bites&quot; includes other sea faring dishes like Brown Bread with anchovy butter ($3.50), Baked Top Neck Cams with red pepper and chili ($9) and a Kelp Cole slaw ($7). </p>
