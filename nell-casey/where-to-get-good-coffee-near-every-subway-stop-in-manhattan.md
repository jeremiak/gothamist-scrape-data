<p>We&apos;re <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501173801/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/17/interactive_map_here_are_all_the_st.php">never far</a> from from chain brand java in times of desperation, but there are always better options if you know where to look. To that end, app company <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501173801/https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Butterfruit+Labs&amp;hl=en">Butterfruit Labs</a> put together a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501173801/http://i.imgur.com/Kn8Ds5f.jpg?1">coffee shop map</a> that name drops the best coffee shop by subway stop.</p>

<p>The majority of the shops are independent, though apparently the 2/3 stop at 110th Street is a caffeine dead zone. It would be even more helpful if there were addresses associated with each coffee house&#x2014;you&apos;ll have to wait for that feature on your phone, Android users. </p>

<p>Differences of opinion are inevitable&#x2014;I&apos;m partial to the potent Mudshop for my Astor Place fix and prefer DTUT over Effy&apos;s on the UES&#x2014;but it&apos;s a good starting point if you&apos;re in a fix. </p>
