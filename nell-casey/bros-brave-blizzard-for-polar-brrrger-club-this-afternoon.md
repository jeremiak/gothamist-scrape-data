<p>Neither snow nor wind nor <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429160247/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/21/listen_up_for_thundersnow.php">THUNDARSNORTEX</a> stays the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429160247/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/07/shake_shack_polar_brrrger_club_will.php">Polar Brrrger Club</a> from tucking into a meaty burger; in fact, they wouldn&apos;t have it any other way. The patty fanatics have been gathering on the snowiest days of the year since 2010 to gorge on burgers and the like in the arctic conditions. For 2014, that day would be today, when the crew will gather in the Financial District to nosh on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429160247/http://burgerburgerny.com/burger_burger_ny/Burger_Burger_ny.html">Burger Burger</a>.</p>

<p>&quot;New Yorkers are a tough bunch and we aren&apos;t going to let a couple of snowflakes get in the way of our need for Burgers,&#x201D; boasts founder and organizer Rev Ciancio. &quot;Have fun waiting in line at your local grocery store so you can stockpile water and bread, the rest of us will be crushing life by eating a fresh Certified Angus Beef burger downtown at Burger Burger.&quot; Feisty!</p>

<p>If you&apos;re also into <em>crushing life</em>, don your &quot;best Hawaiian shirts and sunglasses&quot;&#x2014;not technically required but come on bro&#x2014;and check out the event for yourself beginning at 1 p.m. The first 10 brave souls on line get gratis grub and everyone participating receives a can of soda from the restaurant. Make sure you say what&apos;s up to the Rev, who&apos;ll be sporting a &quot;black jacket, Hawaiian shirt, gray hat and sunglasses.&quot; </p>
