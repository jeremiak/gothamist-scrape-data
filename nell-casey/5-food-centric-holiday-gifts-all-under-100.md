<p><strong>Cheese Fanatic: Beecher&apos;s Box</strong> The dairy fanatics at this Flatiron cheese emporium turn out some seriously delicious cheese made on premises in their two-story shop and restaurant. Having <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140205210145/http://instagram.com/p/fq3_ARkoDJ/">seen the action</a> personally and tasted their fresh curds, I know the quality of the product matches any of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140205210145/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/04/the_best_cheese_shops_in_nyc.php">big names in cheese</a> but with the bonus of being made locally right here in NYC. The shop sends out <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140205210145/http://store.beechershandmadecheese.com/c-1-gift-collections.aspx">all kinds of cheese boxes</a> but I&apos;m partial to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140205210145/http://store.beechershandmadecheese.com/p-156-just-add-wine.aspx">Just Add Wine</a> collection, which boasts six different blocks of Beecher&apos;s in half pound wedges plus fruit spread, crackers and bread. As the name suggests, it&apos;s a great pre-assembled party kit, ideal for hosting one of the ubiquitous parties that roll around this time of the year. And if someone doesn&apos;t thank you for sending them a huge box of cheese feel free to rob them and rescind your friendship. </p>

<p><strong>Home Cook 2.0: Cast Iron Skillet</strong> For those who&apos;ve mastered basics like boiling water and cooking eggs, the cast iron skillet should be at the top of the list for taking their cooking to the next level. This versatile cookware can run the gamut from searing to frying to baking and can be used on all manner of cooking surfaces, including <em>the open flame</em>. These essentially indestructible skillets are sometimes passed down through the generations, but if you aren&apos;t fortunate enough to inherit Grammy&apos;s well-seasoned one, you&apos;d do well to grab one from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140205210145/http://www.lodgemfg.com/">Lodge cast iron</a>. The company is well-known for their pre-seasoned cast iron cookware; for newbies, go for the 10 1/4&quot; model, which should fit most apartment-sized stovetops without much overhang. When it comes to cast iron maintenance, the company <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140205210145/http://www.lodgemfg.com/useandcare/seasoned-cast-iron">offers some great tips</a>; as for me, I scrape off food bits with some kosher salt, wipe with vegetable oil and call it a day. </p>

<p><strong>Gourmet Parents: Adopt An Olive Tree</strong> To truly trust your olive oil you should <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140205210145/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/08/warning_your_olive_oil_isnt_what_yo.php">know its provenance</a>, which should be easy if you have your own olive tree! Italian company <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140205210145/http://www.nudoadopt.com/italia">Nudo</a> let&apos;s you <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140205210145/http://www.nudoadopt.com/olivetree">adopt a tree</a> and reap the bounty in the form of olive oil shipped to your giftee of choice. It&apos;s a great choice for parents who either love great food, love Italy or like the idea of food sourced from small farms instead of Big Olive Oil.

<p><strong>DIY Sweet Tooth: Make-Your-Own Macaron Kit</strong> Exalted pastry chef <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140205210145/http://gothamist.com/tags/francoispayard">Francois Payard</a> has mastered the delicate macaron, a sweet cookie sandwich made with egg whites and filled with luscious ganache. Without decades of experience, crafting the delicate cookie pieces could prove difficult, especially when egg whites threaten to deflate with even the slightest of breezes or over-harden with an inexperienced hand. Payard created DIY &quot;Makecaron&quot; boxes, which contain 40 cookie shells in chocolate, raspberry and vanilla flavors. Also included is a recipe booklet with four ganache recipes&#x2014;though nobody would judge if you filled the cookies with Nutella or whipped cream! </p>

<p><strong>Book Worm: Food History Of The LES</strong> Literary-minded foodies can get a taste of the city&apos;s historic eateries through their minds even if they can&apos;t visit the Big Apple. Last year, LES institution Russ &amp; Daughters was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140205210145/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/01/lox_of_love.php">immortalized in book form</a> courtesy of a lovely memoir from fourth-generation co-owner Niki Russ Federman titled <em><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140205210145/http://www.mcnallyjackson.com/book/9780805242942">Russ &amp; Daughters: Reflections and Recipes From the House That Herring Built</a></em>. Inside, Federman illuminates the history of the beloved smoked fish house and shares recipes for classic deli dishes. </p>

<p>Not to be outdone by their neighbor, similarly venerable LES eatery Katz&apos;s Delicatessen released a gorgeous photography book filled to the gills&#x2014;just like their sandwiches&#x2014;of scenes and eats from everyday life in the Houston street restaurant. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140205210145/http://baueranddean.com/katz.php">Katz&apos;s: Autobiography of a Delicatessen</a> showcases longtime employees, done-up diners and hundreds of shots of the institutions gut-busting fare. </p>
