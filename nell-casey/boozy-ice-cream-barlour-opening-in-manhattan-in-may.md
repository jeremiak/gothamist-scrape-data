<p>Drowning your sorrows in a pint of ice cream seems a whole lot better when you&apos;ll get a buzz at the end of it, too, which has been the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171015120237/http://gothamist.com/2015/05/26/drunk_desserts_roundup.php">mission</a> of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171015120237/http://www.tipsyscoop.com/">Tipsy Scoop</a> since the boozy ice cream company was founded three years ago. In May, the company expands from the freezer case into a storefront in Kips Bay, opening its first &quot;barlour,&quot; a combination bar and ice cream counter.</p>

<p>Located at 217 East 26th Street, the barlour will serve scoops of flavors including Spiked Hazelnut Coffee (coffee ice cream infused with hazelnut liqueur and Cafe Patron) and Cake Batter Vodka Martini (ice cream infused with cake vodka, amaretto and white chocolate liqueur). There will be a base of 15 different flavors, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171015120237/https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20170413/kips-bay/tipsy-scoop-booze-liquor-ice-cream-kips-bay">DNAinfo reports</a>, in addition to some seasonal options.</p>

<p>&quot;Ice cream flights of four flavors served in chocolate and sprinkes-rimmed shot glasses&quot; will also be on offer, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171015120237/http://www.amny.com/eat-and-drink/tipsy-scoop-s-ice-cream-barlour-heading-to-26th-street-1.13478669">according to AM New York</a>. </p>

<p>The barlour opens on May 7th&#x2014;noon to 9 p.m.&#x2014;with $1 scoops for the first 25 customers on opening day. <br>
