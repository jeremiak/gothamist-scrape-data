The New York Botanical Garden and the now year-old <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429111149/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/31/the_bronx_is_brewing.php">Bronx Brewery</a> have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429111149/http://www.nybg.org/plant-talk/2012/06/garden-programming/a-true-bronx-brew/?utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_source=twitterfeed">begun growing hops in NYC</a> with the goal of incorporating the plants into a new NYC brew called Urban Hop. Over 120 Cascade hop plants were planted this spring in community gardens all over the Bronx and inside the New York Botanical Garden itself, with a harvest date sometime later in the fall.<p></p>

<p>New York State&apos;s history with hops is a long one and was especially prominent in the late 19th century when the state provided nearly all the hops for the rest of the country. This collaboration joins other farms across the state who are reviving the crop and adds another layer to New York City&apos;s booming brewing and locavore culture. &#x201C;I think a key part of the ethos of a craft brewer is to use the highest quality and most local raw materials available in producing a beer,&quot; explains Damian Brown, Master Brewer for The Bronx Brewery. &quot;It&#x2019;s a pretty natural instinct for a brewer to want to imbue the beer with as much local character, participation, and flavor as possible.&quot; </p>

<p>No word yet on exactly when you&apos;ll be able to sample the first batch, but when the time comes proceeds from the brew sales will benefit the Bronx Green-Up program, a initiative that supports Bronx community gardens with materials and growing support, making it go down even smoother.</p>
