<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170424013634/http://gothamist.com/2014/12/09/dumpling_galaxy_flushing.php">Dozens</a> of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170424013634/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/29/momos_himalayan_yak.php#photo-1">dumplings</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170424013634/http://gothamist.com/2014/02/13/photos_how_to_hot_pot.php#photo-1">bubbling hot pots</a> and wheel upon wheel of delicious cheese flock to Flushing next Saturday for the 2nd annual <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170424013634/https://www.facebook.com/events/167426303698772/">Great Northeast Cheese Fest</a>, an evening of dairy-induced food coma courtesy of local chefs and some dope fromage talent from NY and the Northeast. Last year&apos;s inaugural event included a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170424013634/http://gothamist.com/2015/05/29/raclette_east_village.php">raclette service</a> of melted cheese that was worth the price of admission alone.</p>

<p>Returning this year: chef Will Horowitz of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170424013634/http://gothamist.com/2015/09/08/pastrami_perfection_at_harry_and_id.php#photo-1">Harry &amp; Ida&apos;s/Duck&apos;s</a>&#x2014;last year he made an incredible cheese and goat soup&#x2014;and M. Well&apos;s proprietor Hugue Dufour. Joining them are chef Alfonso Zhicay (Casa del Chef Bistro), Chef Humberto Guallpa (Calle Dao), and Chef Brian Hayford (Favela Cubana). </p>

<p>Equally important to the chefs are the cheese makers and creameries bringing samples of their goodies (over 75 different cheese will be on offer). Jasper Hill Farm, who make the award-winning Harbison cheese pictured above (it&apos;s like fondue in a rind) will be on hand, as will Blue Valley Gourmet, Cowbella Diary Products, Meier&apos;s Artisan Cheese and Vulto Creamery, all based out of New York. </p>

<p>Samples of cheese and chef&apos;s creations are unlimited with a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170424013634/https://www.eventbrite.com/e/the-great-northeast-cheese-dairy-fest-tickets-27644816390?aff=erelexpmlt">$60 ticket</a>, as are beer, wine and ciders for pairing. </p>
