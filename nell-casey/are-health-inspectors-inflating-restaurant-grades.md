<p><strong>[Update below]</strong> New York&apos;s restaurant inspection system has been criticized for being <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508162324/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/09/restaurant_letter_grades.php">unfairly punitive</a> since its controversial inception under the Bloomberg administration. Even though fines have been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508162324/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/19/restaurant_fines.php">dramatically reduced</a> and the system altered to be more equitable, restaurant owners are still <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508162324/http://gothamist.com/2013/12/16/bad_restaurant_letter_grades_are_al.php">struggling with poor grades</a>, which can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508162324/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/24/bloomberg_says_not_to_eat_at_restau.php">severely impact their business</a>.</p>

<p>That&apos;s why it&apos;s surprising to learn that city health inspectors seem to rather give a restaurant an &quot;A&quot; grade if the score hovers close to the 13 points or less needed to obtain that letter. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508162324/http://iquantny.tumblr.com/">On his data-heavy blog</a>, Pratt City &amp; Regional Planning <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508162324/http://www.pratt.edu/academics/architecture/city_planning/faculty_and_staff/bio/?id=bwelling">faculty member Ben Wellington</a> studies grading data since the program&apos;s beginnings in 2010 and finds that three times as many restaurants received a score of 13 than a score of 14, which would have earned them a &quot;B&quot; grade. Wellington surmises that inspectors must be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508162324/http://iquantny.tumblr.com/post/76928412519/think-nyc-restaurant-grading-is-flawed-heres-the">using &quot;discretion&quot;</a> when issuing their final tally of violations. </p>

<p>Much like a teacher might boost a student&apos;s final grade when taking other factors (attendance, participation, effort, etc.) into consideration, Wellington believes inspectors are &quot;turning a blind eye towards that last violation that would put a restaurant over the edge.&quot; He also provides some compelling data that shows how often this appears to happen.</p>

<blockquote>To determine how often scores seem to be adjusted,  I assumed that if all were fair there should be a fairly flat count between 12 and 16, namely about 7,200 inspections should fall within each of these score buckets.  (7,200 was chosen based on drawing a smooth curve in the histogram.)  If that&#x2019;s the case, there should be about 21,600 inspections graded B in that range , split between 14,15 and 16. (7,200 x 3).  In fact, there were only 13,029, about 40% lower count than expected.  And we can see <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508162324/http://iquantny.tumblr.com/post/76928412519/think-nyc-restaurant-grading-is-flawed-heres-the">on the graph</a> exactly where those restaurants ended up: They are A&#x2019;s with 12 and 13.</blockquote>

<p>Businesses have bad days from time to time and if an inspection happens to occur when a restaurant fridge has just conked out, for example, shouldn&apos;t there be some leniency instead of slapping them with a failing grade on the spot? Wellington suggests that in that case, grading should be easier across the board and that inspections should be standardized such that there&apos;s no &quot;randomness in the process.&quot; </p>

<p>Almost half of NYC restaurants <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508162324/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/03/almost_half_of_nyc_restaurants_now.php">earned an &quot;A&quot; grade</a> last year and under the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508162324/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/19/restaurant_fines.php">DOH&apos;s new guidelines</a>, restaurants scoring an &quot;A&quot; on their initial inspections don&apos;t have to pay fees associated with violations. This means the agency could be missing out on big bucks if inspectors are letting violations slip for the sake of a good grade.</p>

<p>We reached out to the Department of Health to ask whether inspectors were instructed to offer leniency on a case-by-case basis and if they have the discretion to award a restaurant a &quot;better&quot; grade if violations are considered less egregious. We&apos;ll update when we hear back. </p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> The Health Department responded to our request for comment with the following statement:</p>

<blockquote>The Health Department&#x2019;s restaurant grading program was designed to improve sanitary conditions and food safety practices, reduce illnesses associated with dining out, and inform the public about a restaurant&#x2019;s inspection results. Inspectors are not instructed to offer leniency, just to cite what they see. The final score is based on the extent of the violations that the inspector observes.</blockquote>
