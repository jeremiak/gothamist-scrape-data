<p>This weekend, the inaugural <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171030133615/http://themeadowsnyc.com/">Meadows Music Festival</a> storms into <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171030133615/http://gothamist.com/2016/08/01/festival_truthing.php">the parking lot</a> outside Citi Field for two days of performances from the likes of Kanye, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171030133615/http://www.stereogum.com/1900696/the-meadows-replaces-the-weeknd-with-j-cole/news/">The Weeknd</a>, Grimes, Chance the Rapper and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171030133615/http://themeadowsnyc.com/music/#!programmation=artists$">quite a few others</a>. As has become <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171030133615/http://gothamist.com/2016/07/15/panorama_festival_food.php">expected</a> in the era of artisanal street foods, the festival&apos;s packing in a dope roster of local food talent to feed attendees, with a special focus on Queens-based vendors repping their home borough.</p>

<p>Organizers tapped local Queens food hero and blogger <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171030133615/http://gothamist.com/tags/joedistefano">Joe DiStefano</a> to curate the tight lineup of hyper local food spots. On board for the weekend is the legendary <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171030133615/http://gothamist.com/tags/arepalady">Arepa Lady</a> of Jackson Heights and nearby Dhaulagiri Kitchen serving Nepalese momos and La Esquina Del Cameron Mexicano, serving Mexican ceviche. Pata Paplean, serving Thai noodle soups out of Elmhurst, and Tortas Neza, serving Mexican mini-pork tacos out of Corona, round out the offerings from the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171030133615/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/queens/new-signs-people-queens-world-borough-article-1.1975761">World&apos;s Borough</a>.</p>

<p>The food options are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171030133615/http://themeadowsnyc.com/food-cocktails/">pretty extensive</a>, but you&apos;ll still get some classics like fries, of course (Friterie), classic fair foods (Jalapeno Corndog Concessions), pizza (Pizza Nova), not processed chicken products (The Nugget Spot), lots of tacos (Taqueria Diana, Korilla) and ice cream products (Davey&apos;s Ice Cream, Coolhaus). If you have time between eating, check out some of the music.</p>

<p>Sunday&apos;s GA admission is sold out (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171030133615/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/06/video_kanye_west_asked_de_blasio_to.php">thanks, Kanye</a>), but tickets for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171030133615/http://themeadowsnyc.com/tickets/">Saturday GA ($115)</a>, two day GA and all the VIP options are still available.</p>
