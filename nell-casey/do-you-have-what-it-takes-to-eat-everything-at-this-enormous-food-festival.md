<p>We&apos;re now deep into February, a time when gym cards dangle uselessly on keychains, yoga mats collect dust in the front door and new sneakers bear nary a scuff from regular usage. All is where it should be. Which is good news because it&apos;s time yet again for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160723181741/http://choiceeats.villagevoice.com/2016/">Choice Eats</a>, the Village Voice-curated all-you-can-stuff-in-your-mouthhole food festival designed to test the limits of your Zubaz. It&apos;s back at the Metropolitan Pavilion this year on March 11th; in recent years the feeding frenzy has wisely moved its operations to a Friday night, as the resulting food-and-alcohol hangovers have the tendency to be beastly.</p>

<p>As always, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160723181741/http://choiceeats.villagevoice.com/2016/restaurants.php">restaurant lineup</a> features some interesting newcomers, among them the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160723181741/http://gothamist.com/2015/05/29/raclette_east_village.php">cheese coma pushers</a> at Raclette; the old-is-new-again <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160723181741/http://gothamist.com/2015/08/31/schallers_stube_ues.php">wurst sandwiches</a> from Schaller&apos;s Stube; and the grand debut (unless the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160723181741/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/02/emmy_squared_williamsburg.php">brick and mortar opens first</a>) of Emmy Squared, the Detroit-style pie venture from the team at Emily. Inevitably, the line will be the longest at Luke&apos;s Lobster, even though their namesake crustaceans won&apos;t even be served. </p>

<p>With that insider&apos;s hot tip&#x2014;plus getting on line early, saving the booze for last and seeking out non-&quot;name&quot; restaurants for the best bites&#x2014;you&apos;ll be in good shape to make the most of your <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160723181741/https://www.ticketfly.com/purchase/event/1048991">$70 admission fee</a>, which includes <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160723181741/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFUHMjZDgs">everything the light touches</a>: savory bites, desserts and all the booze you can use. </p>
