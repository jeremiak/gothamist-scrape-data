<p>Worrying about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151031153738/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/11/fradulant_fishes_found_fooling_nyc.php">diarrhea-inducing mislabeled fish</a> was enough to keep us from our local sushi joint and that was before we found out the fraud was liquidating our wallets, too. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151031153738/http://oceana.org/en/news-media/publications/reports/seafood-sticker-shock-why-you-may-be-paying-too-much-for-your-fish">latest report from Oceana</a> exposes the financial burden on consumers who are victims of food fraud, revealing that &quot;commonly swapped species can cost up to twice as much as their cheaper counterparts.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Swapping a lower cost fish for a higher value one is like ordering a filet mignon and getting a hamburger instead,&quot; quips Margot Stiles, author of the report and Oceana senior scientist. &quot;If a consumer eats mislabeled fish even just once a week, they could be losing up to hundreds of dollars each year due to seafood fraud.&quot; For example, ordering what&apos;s labeled as grouper at a restaurant but is actually tilapia means customers are paying upwards of $12 for a cheaper variety of fish without realizing it.</p>

<p>Oceana&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151031153738/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/22/somethings_fishy_nyc_still_a_hotbed.php">previous study</a> found that one third of seafood in the U.S. was mislabeled at both grocery stores and at restaurants, so accept the fact that we&apos;ve all been victim of this crime. To combat the rampant fraud, Congress <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151031153738/http://oceana.org/en/news-media/press-center/press-releases/senate-introduces-bill-to-fight-seafood-fraud-after-oceana-study">introduced a bill</a> more strict traceability for seafood sold in the U.S. &#x201C;Consumers deserve to know their seafood is safe, legally caught and honestly labeled, including information like where, when and how it was taken out of the ocean,&quot; Stiles says. &quot;The more information that follows the fish, the harder it will be for fraudsters to rip off American consumers.&quot;</p>

<p>We&apos;re all for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151031153738/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/03/rat_meat_sold_as_lamb_at_chinese_fa.php">more transparency</a>. </p>
