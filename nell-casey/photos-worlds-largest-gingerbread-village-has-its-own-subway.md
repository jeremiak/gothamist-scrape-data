                            <p>Our <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140227095149/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/05/we_win_everything_nyc_is_the_most_c.php">competitive spirit</a> has won us yet another accolade, this time in the form of a gigantic edible gingerbread construction. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140227095149/http://www.nysci.org/">New York Hall of Science&apos;s</a> enormous <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140227095149/http://www.nysci.org/event/gingerbread-lane/">GingerBread</a> Lane has been officially dubbed the world&apos;s largest edible gingerbread village by the minutiae masters at the Guinness Book of World Records. Clocking in at 1.5 tons, the 300-square foot village was constructed entirely out of gingerbread and thick royal icing, garnished with thousands of candies from Life Saver roofing shingles to Cadbury Chocolate cobblestones. </p>

<p>It took creator Chef Jon Lovitch <em>an entire year</em> from design to decoration to complete his sugary masterpiece. Within the Lane you&apos;ll find 152 gingerbread houses&#x2014;plus a candy store, an ice skating rink and some sky scrapers&#x2014;65 icing trees plus more made from candy. The village also boasts several modes of rail transportation, including four cable cars, five train cars and even an underground subway station. </p>

<p>The confectionary municipality will be on display at the museum until January 12th, when it will be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140227095149/http://www.nysci.org/event/gingerbread-lane-house-giveaway/">dismantled and given away</a> to whoever wants to wait on line at 10 a.m. While you&apos;re already out there you should also visit the nearby Queens Museum of Art and check out their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140227095149/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/01/the_giant_nyc_panorama_is_getting_a.php#photo-1">dope panorama</a>. You can&apos;t eat it but you might be able to point to your apartment building!</p>
