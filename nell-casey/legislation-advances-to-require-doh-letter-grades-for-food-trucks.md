<p>Like brick-and-mortar restaurants before them, food trucks and food carts may soon be displaying the letter grade results of Health Department inspections alongside the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170615174655/http://gothamist.com/2015/05/22/ripoff_hot_dog_vendor_fired.php">price for hot dogs</a>. </p>

<p>On Tuesday, legislation <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170615174655/https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2017/s592/amendment/b">introduced by Queens State Senator Jose Peralta</a> passed in the Senate that would require inspection results to be publicly posted, with the City Council&apos;s Health Committee <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170615174655/http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2017/05/24/food-cart-letter-grades-.html">approving a similar bill</a> that would require both receiving and displaying letter grades issued by the DOH. Hopefully mobile vendors are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170615174655/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/01/now_this_is_how_you_hide_a_restaura.php">as artistically-minded</a> as their restaurant counterparts.</p>

<p>The initiative has support not only from pols but from some operators of the carts themselves, who see the grades as an opportunity to prove they are clean, well-run businesses, in addition to setting themselves apart from other vendors. </p>

<p>&quot;It&apos;s great for my business because I expect to get an A, and customers will want to buy from me because I got the A,&quot; cart owner Abdelalim Abdelbaky&#x2014;whose cart was embroiled in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170615174655/http://gothamist.com/2015/05/22/ripoff_hot_dog_vendor_fired.php">$30 hot dog scandal</a>&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170615174655/http://nypost.com/2017/05/23/food-carts-may-soon-get-a-letter-grade/">told the Post</a>. </p>

<p>Industry advocates also approve of the proposed measure, provided it also addresses other issues faced by street vendors, including <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170615174655/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/08/mobile_street_food_vendors.php#photo-1">strict city rules</a> regarding who can operate a mobile food business and how. </p>

<p>&quot;At the New York Food Truck Association (NYFTA), we think food trucks should be held to the same food safety regulations as brick-and-mortar restaurants, not only including letter grades, but also addressing the onerous food safety permitting process for food truck employees,&quot; Ben Goldberg, Founder and CEO New York Food Truck Association, said in a statement.</p>

<p>While the legislation passed 57 to 5 in the Senate, it still faces a journey through the Assembly before advancing any further towards the Governor. Opponents are saying the state bill doesn&apos;t do enough to address issues including <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170615174655/http://gothamist.com/2016/12/02/street_meat_environmental_hazard.php">air and noise pollution</a> from trucks and carts, while others think this should be a matter best left with the city and not the state, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170615174655/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/manhattan/manhattan-top-borough-dirty-food-trucks-article-1.3190359">the Daily News reports</a>. </p>

<p>Peralta&apos;s been working on this issue <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170615174655/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/27/state_sen_will_propose_food_cart_le.php">since at least 2011</a> and recently <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170615174655/https://www.nysenate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/jeffrey-d-klein/senator-peralta-idc-issues-report-dirtiest-pushcarts-new">released inspection data</a> from mobile food operators in the five boroughs. One vendor in Manhattan&#x2014;the borough with the most food trucks and the highest rate of violations&#x2014;racked up 52 violation points during one inspection. Meh. Is it really a dirty water dog without an element of danger?</p>
