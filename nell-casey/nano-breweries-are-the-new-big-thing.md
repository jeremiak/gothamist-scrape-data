<p>If you thought drinking the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130821214920/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/19/taste_new_brooklyn_brewery_beer_mad.php">latest Brooklyn Brewery creation</a> meant you were <em>so clued in</em> about drinking local, craft beer, think again. Today <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130821214920/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/17/dining/breweries-not-too-big-for-their-barrels.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;_r=0">the <em>Times</em></a> dives into the world of &quot;nanobreweries,&quot; the next step up from homebrewing, with operations sized between single barrel and seven-barrel systems. Nearly a dozen of these &quot;nanos&quot; have opened in or around New York City in recent years, with over 200 opening nationwide. Get ready for the nano invasion!</p>

<p>Over in Queens we have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130821214920/http://www.bridgeandtunnelbrewery.com/">Bridge and Tunnel Brewery</a>, which Rich Castagna operates out of his one-car garage behind the family home. His one-barrel system can crank out 45 gallons per batch, which Castagna sells to local bars and restaurants. Other nanos are slightly larger, like the seven-barrel system used by Long Island&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130821214920/http://www.portjeffbrewing.com/main.htm">Port Jeff Brewing Company</a>, which can produce a higher volume of product. Either way, the nanos are big hit with consumers, who are always looking for things to be more local, more artisan. &quot;The best beer is coming out of these small breweries,&quot; Jimmy Carbone, owner of beer mecca Jimmy&apos;s No. 43, explained to the Times. &quot;They have the passion.&quot;</p>

<p>Despite the passion, it&apos;s difficult to turn a profit with a tiny output, which means many nanos hope to expand if their brews catch on. A nano today could be an Anheuser-Busch tomorrow, so jump on the bandwagon soon to maintain that indie cred. Although, if there&apos;s already a Times trendpiece, maybe we&apos;ve all missed the boat.</p>
