<p>The year&apos;s second most viral food mashup <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429072537/http://gothamist.com/tags/ramenburger">Ramen Burger</a> has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429072537/https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=809394455752686&amp;set=a.486796468012488.131524.486780641347404&amp;type=1&amp;theater">landed a full time</a> gig at Carroll Garden&apos;s unique noodle shop <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429072537/http://dassara.com/index.html">Dassara Ramen</a>. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429072537/http://www.timeout.com/newyork/things-to-do/brooklyns-dassara-is-serving-the-ramen-burger-from-now-on">Time Out</a> learned that the burger would be a staple on the menu following a successful month-long run back in mid-September.

If you happen to miss out, Shiamoto still shows up at Smorgasburg each weekend and now he&apos;s got a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429072537/http://gothamist.com/2013/12/01/photos_inside_the_new_indoor_smorga.php#photo-5">new chashu ramen burger</a> on the menu as well.<br>
