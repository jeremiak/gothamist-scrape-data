<p>Midtown gets a little dose of the Lower East Side on Thursdays with the return of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130601152220/http://www.hesterstreetfair.com/#!hester-nights/c7h0">Hester Nights</a>, the all-food weeknight extension of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130601152220/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/16/hester_street_fair_back_in_action_s.php#photo-1">Hester Street Fair</a>. Starting this Thursday, May 2nd and continuing every Thursday from 5 p.m. to 10 p.m., the market takes over the plaza of the Hotel Eventi, with food and beverage purveyors from the weekend fair making the trek uptown to serve office drones looking for an al fresco evening. </p>

<p>Snack on Thai street food from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130601152220/https://www.facebook.com/KhaoManGaiNY?ref=stream">Khao Man Gai NY</a>, Umami Burgers from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130601152220/https://www.facebook.com/DeviantFoodCorp">Deviant Chef</a> or made-to-order pies from Ludlow Pizza, cooked on-site in a wood fire oven. Those on specific diets aren&apos;t forgotten: gluten-free folks can chow down on mac-and-cheese from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130601152220/https://www.facebook.com/pages/Good-Eats-to-Go-Gluten-Free-Wheat-Free/224446597643137">Good Eats to Go</a> and vegans get a sweet treat with cake truffles from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130601152220/http://www.cakebitesnyc.com/">Cake Bites NYC</a>. Sip on a fresh squeezed juice from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130601152220/http://www.lizzmonade.com/">Lizzmonade</a> or down a few beers and cocktails from the Hotel Eventi bar.</p>

<p>In addition to movies on the big screen, Hester Nights has partnered with The Blue Note Jazz Festival to bring two nights of free jazz to the market. June 6th brings the cuisine and tunes of New Orleans to the space and on June 13th the event will focus on Latin Jazz.</p>

<p><em>Hotel Eventi Open Air Plaza, 851 6th Avenue; Thursdays, 5 p.m. to 10 p.m., May 2nd through September 26th</em></p>
