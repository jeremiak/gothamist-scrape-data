<p>Both the Jones and Uch&#x16B; concepts are owned by Derek Feldman, who&apos;d originally <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170615204847/http://www.boweryboogie.com/2016/05/sushi-dojo-vet-david-bouhadana-angling-open-nishiwak-eldridge-street/">partnered with Sushi Dojo vet David Bouhadana</a> on the projects; Bouhadana instead went on to open Sushi By Bou, another <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170615204847/http://gothamist.com/2017/05/10/david_bouhadana_sushi_by_bou.php">quick omakase-style restaurant</a> inside the Gansevoort Market. Instead, Sam Clonts will operate the food and Frank Cisneros will helm the bar. </p>

<p>The tiny Bar at Uch&#x16B; only has eight seats, at which diners will be served both Japanese whiskies, as well as a kaiseki-style tasting menu that will change frequently. Each night there will be two seatings available for the multi-course meal, ingredients of which will be sourced from Uch&#x16B;&apos;s rooftop garden whenever possible. Reservations for the meals ($200) will be available beginning June 13th.</p>

<p>Exactly a month later, on July 13th, reservations will open for Uch&#x16B;, serving an omakase-style meal, the details of which have not yet been released.</p>

<p>Though neither the bar nor the restaurant have officially opened yet, some folks got an early peek and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170615204847/https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/uchu-new-york?select=cyoCxyw-FA3I9c4AvoeKYA">posted a menu</a> and some photos to Yelp. The elegant dishes included a Jidori Egg with white asparagus and trout roe, squab with foie gras and flowering onion, and Hokkaido Abalone Donabe with rice and mushrooms. </p>

<p><em>A previous version of this article included two photos of the forthcoming Uch&#x16B; restaurant, which were sent in error by the restaurant&apos;s publicity team and have since been removed.</em></p>
