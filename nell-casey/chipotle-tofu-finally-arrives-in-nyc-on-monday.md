</div></div>					<p>It&apos;s been a long wait for vegetarians who enviously watched as West Coasters tucked into hearty Chipotle burritos stuffed with the chain&apos;s new tofu offering, dubbed sofritas. But the wait is almost over, folks, because the new meat-free protein offering drops next Monday, March 3rd in NYC markets, and boy oh boy was it worth the wait.</p>

<p>Watery, chalky supermarket tofu this is not. The chain sources their product from Oakland-based <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427201140/http://hodosoy.com/">Hodo Soy</a>, which crafts artisanal tofu with beans sourced from organic, sustainable farms across the country. The partnership reflects the company&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427201140/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/14/there_arent_enough_naturally_raised.php">commitment to natural products</a>, as well as the desire for the best-tasting product they can find. The quality stands out, both in the tofu&apos;s slightly chewy texture and the subtle nutty flavor. </p>

<p>To create the sofritas, the tofu gets seared and then ground into crumbles similar to the chorizo bits you might find in a taco. The tofu is also braised with chipotle chilies, roasted poblanos and lots of spices, in a treatment similar to the ones given to other protein offerings. The resulting product has a deep, earthy flavor with bright notes of cumin and lots of heat from the peppers. </p>

<p>Tofuphobes will have a hard time defending their positions after trying it, especially wrapped in one of Chipotle&apos;s big burritos. The decision to crumble the tofu, as opposed to cubing it, is part of the dish&apos;s success. They&apos;ve managed to avoid the unpleasant, overly chewy chunks of flavorless soy product that can derail even the most well-intentioned dish. </p>

<p>Like all their other proteins, the sofritas will be available in burritos, tacos, salads and bowls with whatever fixins you want. And don&apos;t worry, those pinto beans are now <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427201140/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/18/fyi_chipotles_pinto_beans_are_in_no.php">100% vegetarian</a>. </p>
