<p>Despite <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170310060615/http://mastbrothers.com/pages/press">protestations to the contrary</a>, the Mast Brothers are finally coming clean about their use of industrial chocolate in the early days of their operation. Days after being <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170310060615/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/18/mast_brothers_fraudsters.php">very publicly outed</a>, the brothers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170310060615/http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/21/nyregion/unwrapping-mast-brothers-chocolatier-mythos.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;_r=0">admitted to the Times</a> that they remelted chocolate &quot;in some of their early creations,&quot; during a time they call &quot;a fun experimental year.&quot; Rick Mast adds that they said as much &quot;to anyone that asked.&quot;</p>

<p>With the chocolate industry&apos;s &quot;open secret&quot; now made public, it now comes down to whether or not shoppers care about the past obfuscation or whether that fancy packaging will still persuade them to drop $10 on a candy bar. </p>

<p>As for the rest of the industry, many have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170310060615/http://gothamist.com/2015/03/16/mast_brothers_hipster_backlash.php">already made up their minds</a> about the &quot;inedible&quot; product. </p>

<p>Guardian &quot;Food Snob&quot; Dave Bry has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170310060615/http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/dec/20/mast-brothers-chocolate-bars-scandal">also penned a lengthy takedown</a> of the Mast Brothers&apos; chocolate. Bry taste-tested three Mast offerings alongside two other craft chocolate offerings and a bar of Hershey&apos;s Special Dark. </p>

<blockquote>All the Mast bars were far too chalky and bitter. The almond one tasted like bark. Or, I guess, the shells of cacao beans. The not-quite-finely-ground-enough shells of cacao beans? Is that what kept catching in my throat as I swallowed? Whatever it was, it kinda hurt.
<br><br>
Goat&#x2019;s milk chocolate, meanwhile, tasted like cheese. The funky, distinctly mature taste of a product made out of protein that comes from a barnyard animal. It had that funk, that sweaty-gym-sock sourness that we who like funky cheese appreciate very much in a cheese. I like that always-sort-of-disgusting taste a lot! I am an adventurous eater!
</blockquote>

<p>Admittedly, Bry isn&apos;t a fan of one of the alternate craft offerings, calling it &quot;intensely acidic,&quot; but enjoyed the second, proving not all craft chocolate has to be off-putting. At the end, Hershey&apos;s wins for him, despite its sweet, vaguely chemical taste; it&apos;s &quot;a balm for a throat scraped raw by jagged shards of cacao bean shells.&quot; </p>
