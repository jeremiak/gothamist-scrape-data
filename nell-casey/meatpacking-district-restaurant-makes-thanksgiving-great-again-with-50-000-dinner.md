<p>There&apos;ll be no use for savings accounts, IRAs and 401Ks <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170921181215/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/09/arrival_of_cheeto_fuhrer.php">in the future</a> so lets instead blow $50,000 on Thanksgiving dinner. Longtime Meatpacking District restaurant Old Homestead <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170921181215/http://gothamist.com/2014/11/22/lets_all_celebrate_thanksgiving_wit.php">never skimps</a> when it comes to dishing up &quot;more opulence and decadence than the lobby in Trump Tower,&quot; offering millionaires the chance to...do what they&apos;re probably already doing on weekly basis: spend lots of money on food, wine, luxury products, and experiences to fill the insatiable inner void created by a lifestyle of self-serving greed.</p>

<p>For this year&apos;s fete, the restaurant&apos;s got a specialty item-laden spread that makes sense only if you&apos;re a person who, say, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170921181215/http://gothamist.com/2014/12/08/worlds_largest_truffle.php">uses truffles</a> as a pumice stone or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170921181215/http://gothamist.com/2009/09/26/bloomberg_defends_helicopter_jaunt.php">needs a helicopter</a> to fly from Manhattan a few miles away to NJ. </p>

<p>On the menu:<br>
</p><ul><br>
<li>A &quot;20-lb roasted free-range, organically raised $85/lb turkeys, seasoned with a proprietary exotic spice mix of spices imported from the Middle East, basted with imported $17/oz extra-virgin olive oil from Italy.&quot;</li><br>
<li>&quot;A rich stuffing - the operative word is rich because it consists of $465/lb imported Japanese prized Wagyu beef, $54/lb foie gras, and $46/loaf sourdough bread imported from the U.K.&quot;</li><br>
<li>&quot;Whipped sweet potatoes topped with $1,600/oz caviar from Caspian Sea.&quot;</li><br>
<li>&quot;Green beans not exactly like the ones the first Pilgrims and Native Americans shared - these are prepared with chunks of imported $90/lb ham from pigs fed a special root diet.&quot;</li><br>
<li>&quot;Homemade pumpkin ice cream with $4,200/bottle rum-infused eggnog sauce.&quot;</li><br>
</ul><p></p>

<p>And that&apos;s just the abridged list.</p>

<p>But the restaurant&apos;s pricey Thanksgiving experience isn&apos;t limited to just food. </p>

<p>Purchasers of this Thanksgiving experience also receive, among other things, four tickets to an upcoming Giants game (valued at $10,000); one night at the Waldorf with room service and breakfast in bed (valued at $5,000); limousine transportation while in NYC (around $2,000); and a Fifth Avenue shopping spree (totaling $7,500). You&apos;ll also be able to <strike>punch a carriage horse in the face</strike> take a horse-drawn carriage ride through Central Park (which is practically the same thing). </p>

<p>A spokesperson for the restaurant says they haven&apos;t sold any seats just yet&#x2014;and they&apos;ve only made enough foie gras and Wagyu stuffing for three parties of eight&#x2014;but last year they sold all available seats and the previous year filled up with two parties of ten.</p>

<p>Those who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170921181215/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/09/getting_involved_organize.php">spent their money elsewhere</a> can still eat off of Olde Homestead&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170921181215/http://www.theoldhomesteadsteakhouse.com/?q=menus">plain old Thanksgiving menu </a>for $85 a person ($65 if you skimp on the filet).</p>
