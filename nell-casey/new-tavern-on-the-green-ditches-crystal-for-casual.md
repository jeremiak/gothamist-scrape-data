<p>The new version of the historic Tavern on the Green restaurant won&apos;t be dishing out the hoity-toity (and widely disliked) fare of its past. Chef Katy Sparks, who was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420054418/http://gothamist.com/2012/08/16/katy_sparks_to_be_chef_at_new_taver.php">tapped to run the restaurant</a>, has revealed some of the dishes she expects to serve once the doors open in April&#x2014;or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420054418/http://gothamist.com/2013/12/14/tavern_on_the_green_opening_pushed.php">whenever</a>.</p>

<p>The chef shared her &quot;urban-farmhouse&quot; eats <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420054418/http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/eats/new-plan-tavern-green-better-food-hold-glitz-article-1.1617667#ixzz2thLZ0MaJ">with the Daily News</a>, including &quot;roasted duck breast with farro, prunes and almonds in verjuice sauce; roasted Japanese eggplant with pomegranate, sheep-milk yogurt and fresh-torn herbs; and Serrano ham on cave-aged Gruyere sage toast with anchovy sauce.&quot; Befitting the current locavore movement, products like fish from Russ &amp; Daughters and chocolate from Mast Brothers will feature prominently on the menu.</p>

<p>Additionally, the two Philadelphia restaurateurs who are helping Sparks decided to trim down the expansive space by two-thirds, reducing the dining area to 11,000 square feet. They&apos;re also opening a takeout window for on-the-go fare like sandwiches and other snacks; hopefully the Community Board can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420054418/http://gothamist.com/2010/10/16/tavern_on_the_green_food_trucks_out.php#photo-1">handle it</a>. </p>
