Danny Meyer&apos;s Union Square Hospitality Group will reportedly give sky high dining a try with a new restaurant atop commercial office building &quot;28 Liberty,&quot; located at that address in the Financial District. The former One Chase Manhattan Plaza skyscraper will house an untitled (so far) venture, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170307021940/http://nypost.com/2017/03/01/danny-meyer-launching-30m-restaurant-bar/">according to the NY Post</a>, taking over the 60th floor for a bar, restaurant and ballroom. <p></p>

<p>We reached out to Meyer&apos;s group for confirmation and will update if we hear back.</p>

<p>The sprawling 38,000-square-foot venue will offer 360-degree views, including the one northeast seen above. A third of that space will reportedly be a restaurant, while the rest will be a multi-use events space wayyyy up at 880 feet. </p>

<p>The Post claims it&apos;s the city&apos;s highest ballroom, but it will also be one of the city&apos;s highest restaurants, coming in under places like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170307021940/http://gothamist.com/2014/09/30/rainbow_room_reopens_photos.php">Rainbow Room</a> (65th floor) and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170307021940/https://oneworldobservatory.com/restaurant/">One Dine</a> at the top of One World Trade Center (101st floor). No chef names have been dropped yet, but it stands to reason that what Meyer lacks here in height, he more than makes up for in food quality and hospitality. </p>
