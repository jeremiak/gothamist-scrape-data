<p>Next month the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406115229/http://tribecafilm.com/festival">Tribeca Film Festival</a> kicks off with <em>Time is Illmatic</em>, a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406115229/http://gothamist.com/2014/02/19/nas_documentary_time_is_illmatic_wi.php">documentary about Nas</a> and the beginning of his career. Also joining this year&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406115229/http://tribecafilm.com/filmguide?film_type=Documentary">excellent documentary lineup</a> are two subjects near and dear to New Yorker&apos;s hearts: hot dogs and Chinese food.</p>

<p>First up, a look at the most iconic of NYC dogs in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406115229/http://tribecafilm.com/filmguide/53208a86c07f5df7d20005c8-famous-nathan"><em>Famous Nathan</em></a>, which looks at the nearly 100-year-old Coney Island institution Nathan&apos;s Famous. Filmmaker Lloyd Handwerker&#x2014;grandson to Nathan and Ida Handwerker, who began the business in 1916&#x2014;weaves together old family movies and photographs, interviews with longtime employees and a rare interview with Nathan himself to paint a picture of how one frankfurter took over the world. </p>

<p>The documentary makes its world premiere at the TFF. </p>

<p>On nearly every menu at Chinese restaurants across the country you&apos;ll find a version of the sticky, sweet, fried poultry known as General Tso&apos;s chicken. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406115229/http://tribecafilm.com/filmguide/53208ae0c07f5df7d2000729-search-for-general-tso"><em>The Search For General Tso</em></a> chronicles the history of the ubiquitous dish and seeks to find out just who <em>was</em> that chicken-loving general. Red Farm maestro <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406115229/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/09/chinese_food_expert_ed_schoenfeld_o.php">Ed Schoenfeld</a> serves as one talking head on the journey, which visits both China and America in its search for answers. </p>
