<p>Everyone headed to next weekend&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021111544/http://www.panorama.nyc/">Panorama Festival</a> on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021111544/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/03/randalls_island_guide_2016.php">Randall&apos;s Island</a> take note: come hungry. The Coachella spawn features an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021111544/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/01/panorama_festival_lineup.php">impressive lineup of musical acts</a>&#x2014;LCD Soundsystem, Arcade Fire, Kendrick Lamar, The National, and many more will headline&#x2014;and an impressive roster of NYC eateries to boot. As long as they don&apos;t <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021111544/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/21/was_extra_mooga_worth_250.php">Mooga it up</a>, attendees should be well sated in spirit and stomach.</p>

<p>The full vendor lineup is below for completists, but there are a few standouts worth highlighting. First up, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021111544/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/04/nix_vegetarian_greenwich_village.php">outstanding new vegetarian restaurant</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021111544/http://www.nixny.com/">Nix</a> will be serving PCP: a Pita Chili Pie with vegan chili, grated cheddar, sour cream and scallion and other meat-free goodies. Vegans are well looked after too by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021111544/http://www.monksmeats.com/">Monks Meats</a>, serving BBQ Seitan Sandwiches and Batter Fried Mushrooms.</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="071516contra.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021111544im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_nellcasey/071516contra.jpg" width="640" height="485"> <br> <i> (Contra / Wildair)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>The dynamic duo <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021111544/http://contranyc.com/">Contra</a> and Wildair throw off their set menu/<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021111544/http://gothamist.com/2015/11/24/best_wine_bars_nyc.php">wine bar</a> formats for the festival life, serving Fried Soft Shell Crab and a Peach &amp; Burrata Salad. Typical fest fare, ya know how it goes. There&apos;ll be a lot of tacos on site, but head to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021111544/http://www.jalapajar.com/">Jalapa Jar</a> for a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021111544/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/08/omfg_breakfast_tacos.php">breakfast taco fix</a>.</p>

<p>We&apos;d need a nap after eating the fully loaded fries from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021111544/http://elpasony.com/">El Paso</a>, which come with Mexican brisket, chipotle aioli, grilled onions and cheddar cheese. Same with the gut-busting offerings from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021111544/http://www.loosierouge.com/">Loosie Rouge</a>, which include a collaboration with LES institution for the Katz&apos;s Pastrami Ruben Po-Boy.</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="071516eggloo.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021111544im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_nellcasey/071516eggloo.jpg" width="640" height="427"> <br> <i> (Eggloo)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>The bulbous, puffy waffles from Eggloo will be on site with more waffling from Waffle de Lys, as well as Ice &amp; Vice, Oddfellows and La Newyorkina for a sugar fix. </p>

<p>No doubt there&apos;ll be lots of booze flying around, but non-alcoholic options abound, too. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021111544/http://www.brooklynsodaworks.com/">Brooklyn Soda Works</a> will be dispensing blueberry and lemon sparkling juice, plus fresh sodas and seltzers. Snag a Nitro Cold Brew or draft latte from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021111544/https://www.championcoffee.com/">Champion Coffee</a>, and Ice Almond Milk Matcha Latte served in a pineapple from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021111544/http://www.mamannyc.com/">Maman</a>, or some bubble tea from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021111544/http://teaandmilk.com/">Tea and Milk</a>.</p>
