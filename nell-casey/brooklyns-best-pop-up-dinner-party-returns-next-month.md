<p>Last year, a pop-up restaurant started by Restaurant Daniel alum Nico Russell and some of his colleagues enjoyed a sold-out run at two different Brooklyn locations. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170114145240/http://www.oxalisnyc.com/">Oxalis</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170114145240/http://www.bkmag.com/2016/06/21/look-oxalis-roving-restaurant-pop-daniel-alums/">began last summer at Fitzcarraldo</a>, eventually moving west to Williamsburg&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170114145240/http://www.eggrestaurant.com/">Egg Restaurant</a>, serving multi-course, alcohol-paired dinners that were quite a bit different from the eggs and biscuits slung in the space during the day. </p>

<p>At the end of October, it seemed Oxalis would be put on temporary hiatus; luckily, the approachable but refined dinners have returned, with their next date set for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170114145240/https://www.facebook.com/events/954281984672852/">February 28th</a>. </p>

<p>&quot;Originally we had considered taking a break from pop-ups but there has been so much demand that we feel that it&apos;s important keep the pop-ups going,&quot; explained Steve Wong, the team&apos;s spokesperson. &quot;The pop-ups through last year have shown us that the tasting-menu part of our concept worked. By creating a set menu that&apos;s fairly vegetable focused and not too heavy, we&apos;ve managed to really control our costs and tune our service model where everything feels both natural, comfortable, and well-paced (we hate long drawn out tasting menus!).&quot;</p>

<p>Their approach to fine dining and tasting menus definitely differs from the traditional format. Anyone who&apos;s attempted a tasting menu in NYC knows to expect many courses over many hours, costing major damage to one&apos;s credit card. At Oxalis, attendees enjoy around 10 courses&#x2014;each paired with a cocktail or specially-selected wine&#x2014;for $85, though reservations are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170114145240/https://squareup.com/store/oxalis/item/tuesday-february-th">sold in pairs for $170</a>, so solo dining&apos;s not really encouraged.</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="011117oxalis2.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170114145240im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_nellcasey/011117oxalis2.jpg" width="640" height="427"> <br> <i> (Photo by Louise Palmberg courtesy Oxalis)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>Russell&apos;s background&#x2014;which also includes a stint at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170114145240/http://www.theworlds50best.com/list/1-50-winners/Mirazur">Mirazur</a>, a two Michelin-starred restaurant in France&#x2014;isn&apos;t as common in the pop-up world, which tends to focus on quick service-type operations centering on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170114145240/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/23/mr_bing_pop-up.php">a particular dish</a>, for example. </p>

<p>In general, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170114145240/https://schott.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/04/26/tweezer-food/?_r=0">tweezer food</a> doesn&apos;t lend itself to the transient nature of the roving kitchen, though supper clubs&#x2014;where patrons buy into private dining experiences through a membership&#x2014;tend to be more fine dining-oriented. That&apos;s part of what makes the Oxalis experience unique: haute meals made more egalitarian through public access and an approachable setting like Egg&apos;s cozy back dining room. </p>

<p>Though it changes every time, meals might begin with a few amuse bouche, little dishes meant to be eaten in one pop. During the October iteration, this was accompanied by a bottled cocktail one team member warned was &quot;pretty strong&quot;; would that I&apos;d listened to his warning, especially multiple glasses of wine later. From there, beautifully-plated and (blessedly) reasonably-sized dishes like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170114145240/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/08/chicken_economics.php">trendy Sasso chicken</a> with rainbow chard and Atlantic tilefish with potato and leek. Raw herbs and edible flavors are used to great effect.</p>

<p>Ultimately, Oxalis hopes for more than a nomadic existence. &quot;Our goal is to open a brick and mortar as soon as possible,&quot; Wong tells us. &quot;We now have proof that it&#x2019;s profitable for investors, and more importantly, that New Yorkers are ready for the same casual but thoughtful neo-bistro dining that is really exploding across Paris/France (and Europe, really) right now.&quot;</p>
