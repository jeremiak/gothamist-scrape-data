<p><strong>I&apos;m Here For The Commercials: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406143515/http://www.nitehawkcinema.com/">Nitehawk</a></strong> Without the deafening screams of amped up bros you&apos;ll be able to easily watch the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406143515/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/16/video_jerry_seinfeld_jason_alexande.php">ridiculous commercials</a> everyone will be Tweeting and talking about Monday morning. The Williamsburg cinema throws <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406143515/http://www.nitehawkcinema.com/movie/the-big-game-2014/">The Big Game 2014</a> up on their main screen beginning at 6 p.m., where you can relax in big, comfy movie theater seats to catch all the action. They&apos;ll be serving up House Made Hot Wings tableside, as always, in addition to beer specials on brews local to Seattle and Denver. And don&apos;t worry about missing the day&apos;s <em>other</em> big event; they&apos;ll be screening the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406143515/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/07/puppy_bowl_x_line-up_announced_pupp.php#photo-1">Puppy Bowl and Halftime Kitten Show</a> in the lobby. <em>136 Metropolitan Avenue, (718) 782-8370; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406143515/http://348.formovietickets.com/Tickets.ASP?WCI=buyticket&amp;Page=PickTickets&amp;SHOWID=5225">Tickets $25</a></em></p>

<p><strong>Super Ball-Ers: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406143515/http://standardhotels.com/high-line/food-drink/biergarten">The Standard Biergarten</a></strong> If you&apos;ve got the scratch, this luxe beer hall beneath the High Line has a few posh <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406143515/https://www.facebook.com/events/359559077517783/?ref_newsfeed_story_type=regular">Super Bowl celebrations</a> that include an overnight in the hotel, should you so desire. First up, their Tailgate party from noon to 4:45 p.m., which includes a table for up to eight people with pretzels, sausages and a cooler of brewskies for the budget-friendly price of $250. To stay for the game, be prepared to shell out a minimum of $500 (including the Tailgate party, if you want) and watch the action on the bar&apos;s two 80&quot; TVs. Finally, if money is no object, book a two-night stay starting at $1,375 per night that includes a party for 10 with all the beer, food and gratuity included. <em>848 Washington Street, (212) 645-4100</em></p>

<p><strong>Football Phobe: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406143515/http://break-ny.com/">Break Bar</a></strong> Sure, you could always stay home, but you have an excuse for a Monday hangover; why would you want to pass that up? While your friends are glued to the game, slide up to one of the many billiards tables at this Queens spot or challenge your roommate to a rousing game of ping pong. You&apos;ll still be present for the halftime show, should you chose to engage, but you&apos;re not stuck staring at the TV wondering what in the hell encroachment means. Be sure to throw in a few orders of nachos, jalapeno bottle caps and Brooklyn Lager&apos;s, for tradition&apos;s sake. <em>32-04 Broadway, Astoria, (718) 777-5400</em></p>

<p><strong>It&apos;s Called Soccer: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406143515/http://www.ribaltapizzarestaurant.com/">Ribalta</a></strong> Italy isn&apos;t known as an American football-loving place but with a &quot;16-foot HD mega-screen projector&quot; this Greenwich Village eatery is doing its best to fake it. Don&apos;t expect a rowdy crowd of hooligans; instead, prepare your stomach for giant heros stuffed with prosciutto cotto, American cheese, lettuce, tomato, avocado and mayo served on their wood-fired pizza dough. Think of it like the classy European version of the 6-foot sub you&apos;ll find at most tailgate parties around the country. They&apos;re also serving up their version of wings, sauced in citrusy limoncello sauce for $8. If this is all sounding to hoity toity for you, remember this is also the home of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406143515/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/13/hot_dogs_and_french_fries_top_new_p.php">famed hot dog and french fry pizza</a>; it doesn&apos;t get much more American than that. <em>48 East 12th Street, 212) 777-7781</em></p>
