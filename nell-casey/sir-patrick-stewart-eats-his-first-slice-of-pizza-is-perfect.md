<p>Congratulations, Sir Patrick Stewart, for today is the day you have become a true New Yorker. It wasn&apos;t enough that you bought that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150530191524/http://ny.curbed.com/archives/2012/10/02/actor_patrick_stewart_drops_25m_on_park_slope_duplex.php">fancy duplex in Park Slope</a>, or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150530191524/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/19/extra_extra_patrick_stewart_needs_h.php">tried to save that bird</a> or even that you <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150530191524/http://gothamist.com/2012/09/14/even_patrick_stewart_cant_get_time.php">voiced our collective angst for the city&apos;s most notorious ripoff</a>. No, it was today: the day you ate your first &quot;slice&quot; of New York corner pizzeria pizza.</p>

<p>Look at that form! A more perfect New York fold the city has never seen. More points awarded for the red pepper flakes, a tribute to your daring, your exquisite taste, your lust for life. The Mayor should personally offer you a key to the city for your child-sized, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150530191524/http://gothamist.com/tags/sodaban">Hizzoner-approved</a> soda cup. </p>

<p>You also set the scene perfectly, choosing a pizzeria close to home&#x2014;we hope Park Slope&apos;s Smiling Pizza welcomed you in a manner befitting your Captain&apos;s rank. Today&apos;s New York <em>Times</em> casually resting beneath your arm, perhaps for your post-pizza perch on a sun-drenched bench in Prospect Park. </p>

<p>You even dressed for the occasion, donning the New York City staple, the black t-shirt, perfect for hiding errant grease stains and looking svelte after consuming a day&apos;s worth of calories on cheese and bread. But come now&#x2014;you live in Brooklyn! Time to replace that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150530191524/http://canadiens.nhl.com/">Canadiens hat</a> with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150530191524/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/03/brooklyn_starbucks_employees_forced.php">something a little closer to home</a>. We <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150530191524/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/26/extra_extra_2417.php">know you want to</a>!</p>
