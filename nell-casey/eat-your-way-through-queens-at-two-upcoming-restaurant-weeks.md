<p>Restaurant weeks have become the de facto marketing tactic for neighborhoods trying to increase their foot traffic, and while it&apos;s not the sexiest of events it&apos;s certainly the most cost-effective way to get a feel for a new neighborhood. Despite its status as the most ethnically diverse of our boroughs, Queens gets a bit of a raw deal when it comes to attracting outsiders, especially since Brooklyn&apos;s overpowering ego outshines even Manhattan these days. But two Queens neighborhoods are hoping that some killer deals on lunch and dinner will bring in a few curious eaters while also serving up great options to locals looking to save a few bucks.</p>

<p>The charming enclave of Sunnyside hosts a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131128061748/http://www.sunnysideshines.org/sunnyside-restaurant-week">restaurant week</a> from November 4th through November 8th, with deals on dinner from Turkish, Irish, Thai, Nepalese and other ethnic restaurants for just $25. Choose from a huge menu of Turkish treats at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131128061748/http://www.sunnysideshines.org/sites/default/files/turkish_grill_dinner.pdf">Turkish Grill</a>, including creamy babaganush, doner kebab (ground lamb) or falafel. Some restaurants offer $10 lunch deals, like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131128061748/http://www.sunnysideshines.org/sites/default/files/arriba_arriba_restaurant_week_lunch_menu_2013.pdf">Ariba Ariba</a>, where you can choose from Mexican standbys like tacos, burritos and flautas and enjoy two complimentary drinks (sangria, frozen margaritas, wine or soda) with your meal. Check out <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131128061748/http://www.sunnysideshines.org/sunnyside-restaurant-week">all 17 participating restaurants</a> and be sure to also look for art work by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131128061748/http://www.nolongerempty.org/nc/home/events/event/performances-conveying-the-invisible/">No Longer Empty</a>, who&apos;ve set up installations at a few of the area eateries.</p>
