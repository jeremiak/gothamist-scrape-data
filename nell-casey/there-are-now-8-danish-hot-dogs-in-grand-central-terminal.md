<p>Claus Meyer, the godfather of the New Nordic Cuisine movement who&apos;s taking over Grand Central Terminal <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170917185111/http://gothamist.com/2014/06/21/grand_central_terminal_food_hall.php">in a big way</a>, has opened another avenue in his fleet of new eateries at the historic transportation hub. The gist: he&apos;s hawking $8 hot dogs at a walk-up stand adjacent to his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170917185111/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/25/agern_grand_central_terminal.php#photo-1">new fine dining restaurant Agern</a> next to Vanderbilt Hall. </p>

<p>The dogs are custom-made sausages cooked on a griddle, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170917185111/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/11/dining/hot-dogs-grand-central-terminal-danish.html?rref=collection%2Fcolumn%2Ffront-burner&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=dining&amp;region=stream&amp;module=stream_unit&amp;version=latest&amp;contentPlacement=3&amp;pgtype=collection&amp;_r=0">according to the Times</a>, served on whole grain buns with lots of toppings. The cheapest <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170917185111/http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/agern-danish-dogs-new-york?select=ArimJKk6mi3a-y7N9qLc7A&amp;reviewid=ha5dwC4tvxxtI5nW8JiniA">option</a>, by $1, is the Great Dane ($7), a pork-and-beef hot dog topped with spiced ketchup, remoulade, mustard, white onion, pickled cucumber and crispy shallots. There&apos;s another made with chicken (Hen Hound, $8), topped with tarragon mayo, apple-horseradish ketchup, green tomato relish, white cabbage and watercress. </p>

<p>The dogs sound even more overwrought than Crif Dogs&apos;s most bonkers creation. Eater&apos;s senior critic Robert Sietsema <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170917185111/http://ny.eater.com/2016/5/9/11643528/claus-meyer-grand-central-danish-dogs">didn&apos;t find much to love</a> aside from some interesting toppings combinations. &quot;How did the pig skin get so white? And how did all the toppings manage to resolve themselves into a squishy white mass nearly devoid of flavor?&quot; he questions of one creation. &quot;The sausage, too, is unyielding and rubbery. Still, as a failed experiment in taste and texture, this heap of ingredients holds some interest.&quot;</p>
