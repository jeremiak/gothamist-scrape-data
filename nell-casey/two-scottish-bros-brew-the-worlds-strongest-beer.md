Clocking in at an alarming 67.5% ABV, the appropriately-named &quot;Snake Venom&quot; comes from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141023023108/http://www.brewmeister.co.uk/#/snake-venom/4580369643">Brewmeister</a> in Keith, Scotland, where buddies Lewis Shand and John McKenzie have been diligently working to top their &quot;Armageddon&quot; brew from last year, which boasted a very respectable 65% ABV. <p></p>

<p>&quot;Snake Venom is definitely sharper in taste,&quot; Shand <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141023023108/http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/scots-pals-who-brewed-worlds-2485696">explained to the Daily Record</a>. &quot;With Armageddon, we actually tried to disguise the taste by making it quite oily. We thought if it was too strong, people wouldn&#x2019;t like it.&quot; The duo says hardcore imbibers doubted the brew&apos;s high intensity booze factor because they couldn&apos;t taste the alcohol. Undiscouraged, they went back to the drawing board for another go. &quot;We were too nice last time,&quot; Shand declared ominously.</p>

<p>The nine month-long process involved &quot;smoked peat malt and two types of yeast: beer yeast and champagne yeast,&quot; according to the brewery&apos;s website. A warning label attached to the bottle&apos;s neck warns would-be drinkers of the potent potable within, advising that no more than 35ml should be consumed in one sitting. &quot;It should Be poured like it&#x2019;s whisky,&quot; Shand explains. Let&apos;s not <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141023023108/http://gothamist.com/2010/06/09/icing.php">get any ideas</a>, brahs. </p>

<p>Daring drinkers take note: a 275ml bottle can be yours for just <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141023023108/http://www.therealalecompany.co.uk/snake-venom-the-world-s-strongest-beer-67-5-1-x-275ml-bottles-brewmeister.html">just around $80</a>. </p>
