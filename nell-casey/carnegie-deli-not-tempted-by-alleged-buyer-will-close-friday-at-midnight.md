<p>At midnight on Friday night, the iconic Carnegie Deli bids farewell after almost eight decades in Midtown. All week, loyal customers have been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170102065023/http://gothamist.com/2016/12/28/rip_carnegie_deli_1.php#photo-1">making the pilgrimage</a> to 854 Seventh Avenue for one last pastrami on rye before the lights go out.</p>

<p>Today, second-generation owner Marian Harper-Levine released a statement addressing customers and issuing one final farewell:</p>

<blockquote>Along with my daughter Sarri and in honor of my late father Milton, I would like to sincerely thank all of our loyal patrons&#x2014;tourists, dignitaries, and New Yorkers alike&#x2014;who have visited Carnegie Deli over the past 80 years. Since my father took over the Deli in 1976, this has been a second home to me and it has been a true privilege and an honor to serve you. Although this has been an incredibly difficult decision to officially close Carnegie Deli New York  tonight at midnight, we thank you for your letters, notes, visits and sharing your stories.</blockquote>

<p>On Thursday, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170102065023/http://pagesix.com/2016/12/29/restauranteur-offers-10m-to-save-carnegie-deli/?_ga=1.139507125.729017374.1480337807">Post reported</a> that a former dishwasher at Carnegie turned restaurateur had doubled his offer to purchase the deli. Sammy Musovic, a Yugoslavian immigrant who owns Sojourn, Vero and Selena Rosa, allegedly offered Harper-Levine $10 million to purchase Carnegie Deli. </p>

<p>This morning spokesperson Cristyne Nicholas reiterated that the Deli is not for sale: &quot;They are not considering any publicity inspired offers to buy the Carnegie Deli on 7th Avenue.&quot;</p>

<p>The family still owns other local outposts including one inside Madison Square Garden and a seasonal stand during the US Open, plus two casino restaurants and a meat processing facility and bakery in New Jersey.</p>
