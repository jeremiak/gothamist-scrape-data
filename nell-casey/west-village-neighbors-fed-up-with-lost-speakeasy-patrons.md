<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427163415/http://hudsonclearwater.com/">Hudson Clearwater</a>, a West Village restaurant with a hidden entrance, is once again in hot water with neighbors who claim bar patrons are constantly knocking on their doors looking for the &quot;secret&quot; entrance. Besides having no visible sign advertising the space, the restaurant also conceals its proper entrance at night, meaning would-be patrons must make their way to the side door and through a garden to enter the bar. Unfortunately, befuddled customers can mistake apartment buildings for the restaurant, which residents say happens<em> all the time. </em>&#x201C;When I&#x2019;m outside having a cigarette, people come to the door and think it&#x2019;s Clearwater,&quot; explained local Mike Duffy. &quot;It&#x2019;s probably happened 15 to 20 times.&quot; </p>

<p>According to Yelpers, finding the restaurant can indeed be difficult. Joanie K. called the restaurant &quot;genius&quot; but noted that &quot;google maps will FAIL you. You will wander. Back &amp; forth trying to find the entrance. You will look like an idiot. Consider it an induction  (urban daddy language style).&quot; Others had a little more luck: &quot;Um...good luck finding this place!&quot; says Jo. T &quot;We hopped out of our cab and wandered the streets in the freezing cold trying to find the front door. A nice guy driving by saw us wandering and pointed us to a door around the side of the building.&quot; Well at least one local doesn&apos;t seem peeved to be acting as a tour guide!</p>

It&apos;s a familiar song and dance for the restaurant, which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427163415/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20121019/west-village/secret-restaurant-hudson-clearwater-hit-with-cb2-liquor-license-denial?utm_content=johnd%40gothamist.com&amp;utm_source=VerticalResponse&amp;utm_medium=Email&amp;utm_term=%27Secret%20Restaurant%27%20Hudson%20Clearwater%20Hit%20with%20CB2%20Liquor%20License%20Denial&amp;utm_campaign=Court%20Puts%20Brakes%20On%20Massive%20%27Broadway%20Bomb%27%20Skateboard%20Racecontent">faced similar problems last year</a> when Community Board 2 recommended that the SLA reject their initial application. Obviously, the neighborhood lost that particular fight, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427163415/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/12/why_do_neighbor-hated_bars_keep_get.php">given the SLA&apos;s stance</a> on license renewal, the neighborhood may need to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427163415/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/07/east_9th_street_residents_declare_w.php">kick this up a notch</a>.</p>
