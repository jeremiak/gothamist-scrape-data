<p>The Food and Drug Administration has started an initiative to curb the use of antibiotics in livestock destined for our dinner plates. Hoping to slow down the progress of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140330035157/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/06/nightmare_bacteria_resistant_to_ant.php">terrifying antibiotic-resistant bacteria</a>, the agency <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140330035157/http://www.fda.gov/ForConsumers/ConsumerUpdates/ucm378100.htm">implemented a set of voluntary guidelines</a> for animal pharmaceutical companies to remove antibiotics used for growth enhancement and feed efficiency and reserve their use only when medically necessary for an animal.</p>

<p>Drugs previously available over-the-counter would also be reclassified under the Veterinary Feed Directives (VFD), which would require authorization from a licensed veterinarian for use on livestock.</p>

<p>These so-called &quot;medically important&quot; antibiotics have been used in animal feed and drinking water for decades to make livestock grow faster, a result that the FDA admits it does not fully understand. Because of this overuse, bacterium have developed a resistance, creating the superbugs that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140330035157/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/02/usda_warns_of_antibiotic-resistant.php">make their way into our food</a>. Humans also develop a kind of immunity to antibiotics when they eat the drugged-up animal flesh, meaning it&apos;ll be even harder to cure your strep throat in the decades to come. </p>

<p>&#x201C;We need to be selective about the drugs we use in animals and when we use them,&#x201D; says William Flynn, DVM, MS, deputy director for science policy at FDA&#x2019;s Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM). &#x201C;Antimicrobial resistance may not be completely preventable, but we need to do what we can to slow it down.&#x201D; </p>

<p>Pharmaceutical companies have three months to state their intent to the agency and then three years to fully implement the new changes. Detractors say the guidelines <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140330035157/http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303932504579252062767154136">should have been made mandatory</a>, but the agency believes the voluntary program will be faster and more efficient than a compulsory ban on this type of antibiotic use. &quot;Based on our outreach, we have every reason to believe that animal pharmaceutical companies will support us in this effort,&quot; says Michael R. Taylor, FDA&apos;s deputy commissioner for foods and veterinary medicine. Indeed, many already have, with major meat companies like Smithfield, Cargill and Tyson already releasing lines of antibiotic-free meat. Hopefully that label carries more weight than <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140330035157/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/11/study_organic_label_automatically_m.php">other non-regulated buzzwords</a>.</p>
