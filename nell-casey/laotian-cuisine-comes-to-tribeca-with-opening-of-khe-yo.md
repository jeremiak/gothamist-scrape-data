</div></div>					<p>Considering all the Thai and Vietnamese restaurants the city boasts, it&apos;s curious that a Laotian-focused spot hasn&apos;t come on the scene until now. On Monday Chef Marc Forgione and longtime kitchen partner Chef Soulayphet Schwader opened <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405024015/http://kheyo.com/">Khe-Yo</a>, a new restaurant serving Laotian-inspired cuisine on Duane Street in Tribeca. Taking inspiration from its namesake, which means &quot;green&quot; in Laotian, the menu focuses on local, seasonal cuisine with an emphasis as strong on succulent meats as it is on raw herbs and vegetables. </p>

<p>Dishes are served family style, with diners encouraged to forgo utensils and use sticky rice as their food vehicle. Dunk the white jewels into Chef Schwader&apos;s <em>jaews</em>, or dipping sauces, like his signature Bang Bang Sauce, which accompanies every meal. Start with smokey, spicy Creekstone Farms Sesame Beef Jerky ($12) and Pork Belly &amp; Shrimp Crispy Rolls ($9), composed with Bibb lettuce, perilla and sweet corn. Meaty entrees include Lemongrass Bekshire Spare Ribs ($23) with a side of smashed long bean and Whole Grilled Black Bass ($31) in a green mango and tamarind peanut sauce. </p>

<p>The intimate, teak-heavy interior has an industrial chic kind of vibe, with a large elephant mural echoing Laos&apos; title as Land of a Million Elephants. The restaurant offers only dinner for now but plans to expand to lunch soon, serving a rotating menu of Bahn Mi sandwiches. </p>

<p><em>157 Duane Street, Tribeca, (212) 587-1089, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405024015/http://kheyo.com/">kheyo.com</a>. Open Monday - Saturday from 5:30 p.m. to 11 p.m.</em><br>
