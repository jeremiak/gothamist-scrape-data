<p>The observance of Sunday Funday has been constricted for <em>too long</em> by archaic blue laws that prohibit the sale of alcohol in bars and restaurants until noon, forcing would-be parishioners the indignity of pre-gaming cloistered in their apartments. Luckily, a panel appointed by the governor agrees, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161007072501/https://www.governor.ny.gov/sites/governor.ny.gov/files/atoms/files/reportfinal41316.pdf">releasing a report</a> that calls for lifting the ban on restaurant booze sales between 4 a.m. and noon on Sundays. Think of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161007072501/http://gothamist.com/2014/08/25/video_supercut_of_belligerent_brunc.php">possibilities</a>.</p>

<p>While the city&apos;s tradition of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161007072501/http://gothamist.com/2014/02/20/bottomless_brunch.php">boozed up brunches</a> was mentioned by the panel, their main argument for increased alcohol flow centered on sporting events, specifically special American football games played abroad (and broadcast on Sunday mornings in the States) and European soccer games being broadcast live from their respective countries. The report specifically points to a Buffalo Bills game broadcast from London at 9:30 a.m. in New York and the upcoming New York Giants game that&apos;ll be played in London and similarly broadcast in New York before noon on Sunday. </p>

<blockquote>The Working Group recommends that the ABCL be amended to allow on-premises licensees to serve alcoholic beverages earlier on Sundays. The Working Group proposes two options: changing the end of prohibited hours from noon to 8 am for all on-premises licenses; or creating a permit system that would allow on-premises licenses to serve earlier on Sundays. Such a permit could be issued either for specific events or on a calendar year basis, or both.</blockquote>

<p>&quot;This administration has taken important steps to cut red tape, roll back burdensome recommendations and help this industry continue to grow,&quot; Cuomo <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161007072501/http://nypost.com/2016/04/14/your-boozy-brunches-might-get-even-boozier/">said in a statement</a>. The administration approved legislation that instituted a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161007072501/http://gothamist.com/2014/02/14/nine_pin_cider_named_new_yorks_firs.php">new license program for farm cideries</a>, among other moves to support the booze industry in the state. It also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161007072501/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/27/dogs_have_their_day.php">approved canine companions</a> in outdoor bars and restaurants, so there&apos;s a healthy amount of optimism that booze hounds will be thrown a similar bone.</p>
