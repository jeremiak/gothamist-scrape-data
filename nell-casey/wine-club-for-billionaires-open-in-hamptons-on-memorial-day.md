<p>If you&apos;ve run out of room in your <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130520014733/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/01/wine_cellar_accused_of_hoarding_ric.php">climate-controlled cellar</a> and need more space to store your <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130520014733/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/20/stock_up_on_your_911_memorial_winef.php">commemorative vino</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130520014733/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/31/dr_ruth_wine_will_get_you_drunk_but.php">sex wine</a>, you&apos;re in luck! The Post reports that super-exclusive wine club <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130520014733/http://societeduvin.com/">Societe du Vin</a> will <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130520014733/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/that_bored_dough_0vk5IoHbZVcgcVonpeqhyJ?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Local">open its doors this Memorial Day</a>, offering privileged members a secure spot to store their Shiraz. Criteria for membership include being one of Houston Rockets owner Leslie Alexander&apos;s 75 BFFs and the cash flow to drop $50,000 on a membership fee. Oh, and $8,000 in annual dues. </p>

<p>The club <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130520014733/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/10/dining/lavish-wine-storage-at-societe-du-vin-in-bridgehampton-ny.html?_r=1&amp;">opened last year</a>, though the facility itself is not open year-round. But for the nine months the club remains open, members can visit their wines &quot;almost around the clock,&quot; Alexander told the Times. The 10,000 square foot space, which was formerly a potato barn, will offer storage for members to house their personal wine collections, a salon room for tastings and entertaining and a catering kitchen where members can <strike>sup on world class fare</strike> bring in their own personal chefs to make food. </p>

<p>The &quot;extravagant dark faux leather, wood and stone decor&quot; was designed by Hollywood set designer/<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130520014733/http://newyork.grubstreet.com/2013/04/societe-du-vin-leslie-alexander.html">ghost hunter</a> Elvis Restaino, who also designed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130520014733/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/12/video_gerard_butler_and_oasis.php">Oasis fan Gerard Butler&apos;s</a> loft. Sounds like the appropriately manly environment to grab your billionaire bros and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130520014733/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/25/sledgehammer_wine_for_men.php">cork a bottle of Cabernet</a>.</p>
