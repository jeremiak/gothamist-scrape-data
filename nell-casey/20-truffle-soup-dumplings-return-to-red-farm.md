<p>If you have a few dollars left over from your <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141227064406/http://gothamist.com/2013/12/30/times_square_applebees_offering_375.php">extravagant New Year&apos;s Eve celebration</a> there&apos;s a pricey dumpling deal that might be of interest. The Black Truffle and Chicken Dumplings have returned to Ed Schoenfeld and Joe Ng&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141227064406/http://redfarmnyc.com/">RedFarm</a> just in time for your resolution to stop blowing all your money on trendy foodstuffs. </p>

<p>An order of the xiao long bao includes two truffle and chicken broth-filled dough parcels, each topped with an additional shaving of black truffles. Cost for said tantalizing bites? A cool $20. That&apos;s $2 more <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141227064406/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/19/red_farm_charging_18_for_two_truffl.php">than last year</a>! For comparison, one can procure four lobster dumplings for just a dollar less or four cute Pac-Man shrimp dumplings for $12.50&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141227064406/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/07/first_taste_of_new_uws_red_farm_now.php#photo-5">toddlers love &apos;em</a>!</p>

<p>Both locations are serving up the dainty treats for a limited time. After that it&apos;s back to your regularly scheduled diet of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141227064406/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/29/the_10_best_cheap_eats_in_nyc.php">dollar dumplings</a>.</p>
