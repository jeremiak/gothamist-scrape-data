</div></div><p>New Yorkers now have another reason to travel to Newark besides <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120509160613/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/20/video_stephen_colbert_names_firefig.php">superhero mayor Cory Booker</a>: true-blue BBQ favorite <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120509160613/http://www.dinobbq.com./">Dinosaur Bar-B-Que</a> has officially opened its doors across the Hudson. The popular BBQ restaurant&#x2014;whose Harlem location almost always has a long wait to get in&#x2014;has taken over a massive turn-of-the-20th-century warehouse space downtown. The restaurant pays homage to the building&apos;s history&#x2014;the space has housed a haberdashery, a lighting plant and Newark&apos;s first spirit and wine bottler, among other things&#x2014;with original mosaic floors and a bar counter made from wooden beams recovered during construction. Salvaged wood on the walls and table lends a rustic, homey feel to the space, while lampshades made of tin cutouts of pigs add <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120509160613/http://suicidefood.blogspot.com/">a touch of suicide food</a>.</p>

<p>Dino&apos;s addictive BBQ Chicken Wings are still on the menu, along with St. Louis style pork ribs, brisket and succulent pulled pork. They&apos;ve added an intriguing BBQ Jerked Lamb Steak, which comes with Honey Hush Cornbread, as well as Korean Style Beef Ribs and a Pecan-Crusted Jerk Salmon if you&apos;re not in the mood for meat. The 19 beer draft list draws heavily from local New Jersey breweries like River Horse and Cricket Hill and they can pour a pint of Boylan&apos;s root beer, which is also available on tap. </p>

<p>Don&apos;t let the New Jersey address dissuade you! Hop a NJ Transit train at Penn Station and you can be gorging yourself on delicious smoked meat in under 20 minutes&#x2014;probably in less time than you&apos;ll spend on line at the Harlem location. </p>
