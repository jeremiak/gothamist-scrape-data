<p>If you&apos;re taking a break from your summer diet this weekend, you can do some serious damage at Smorgasburg on Saturday, when <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110101120/http://www.kimchismoke.com/">Kimchi Smoke</a> makes its grand debut at the outdoor market. Robert Austin Cho, who&apos;s been doing pop-ups including a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110101120/http://gothamist.com/2015/07/12/ribs_ramen_and_the_chonut_all_big_h.php#photo-1">stint at Smorgasburg Queens</a>, brings his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110101120/http://gothamist.com/2015/01/15/smoked_kimchis_korean_bbq.php">gut-busting creations</a> to Williamsburg starting this weekend. Bring napkins and extra elastic waistbands.</p>

<p>Cho will be serving a XXX version of his namesake Chonut with smoked pork belly, Bourbon Chipotle Sauce, smoked kimchi and applewood smoked bacon, piled atop a doughnut with red, white, and blue sprinkles. #America</p>

<p>If that&apos;s not enough punishment, try an order of the Cholander Fries, with pulled pork shoulder, smoked kimchi, cheese and more of that BCS. </p>

<p>A brick-and-mortar version of Kimchi Smoke opened up in Bergenfield, NJ earlier this year.</p>
