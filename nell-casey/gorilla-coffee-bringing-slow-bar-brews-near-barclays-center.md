</div></div>					<p>The key to success in our frenzied metropolis is in keeping well-caffeinated, which shouldn&apos;t be difficult considering the number of coffee houses per square mile. Park Slope&apos;s popular coffee bar <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429064007/http://gorillacoffee.com/">Gorilla Coffee</a> raises our coffee community by one this week with the opening of their second location near the Barclays Center today. Like its predecessor, the new shop will offer traceably-sourced, single-origin coffees, roasted out of their Gowanus facility. </p>

<p>But where the original has a more casual coffee shop vibe, the new spot aims to educate drinkers not only about the source of their roast but also how each beverage comes to be. Hand-poured brews are created at the &quot;slow bar&quot; into glass jars so customers can watch the liquid get stronger. Unique espresso machines&#x2014;called modular-brewing systems&#x2014;eschew the bulky boxes in favor of smaller fixtures so customers have full view as their drinks are created. </p>

<p>Education is all well and good but we&apos;re also a people on a time crunch. If you&apos;re tight for time, the front bar offers traditional drip coffees as well as Gorilla&apos;s tasty cold brew so you can caffeinate on the go. </p>

<p><em>472 Bergen Street between Fifth and Flatbush; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429064007/http://gorillacoffee.com/">gorillacoffee.com</a></em> </p>
