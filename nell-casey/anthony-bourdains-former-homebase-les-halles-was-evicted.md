<p>Park Avenue French brasserie Les Halles, which once counted Anthony Bourdain as its captain, suddenly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161007080445/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/27/les_halles_anthony_bourdains_former.php">shuttered last week</a>, with manager Yvonne Lantidua citing a vague &quot;rent issue&quot; for the closure. Now <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161007080445/http://ny.eater.com/2016/3/30/11327338/les-halles-eviction">Eater dropped a report</a> revealing the eatery was actually in the process of being evicted by its landlord going back as far as December, following the end of their lease in November. Restaurant employees also say they had difficulty getting paid and even staged a Friday night walk-out to protest their lack of compensation.</p>

<p>The restaurant&apos;s rent had been $43,000 through November, but the landlord was allegedly asking for a higher figure, which ranged between $65,000 and $80,000, depending on which party was asked. Negotiations with the restaurant&apos;s landlord allowed Les Halles to remain open through the end of April, but the process was moved up after the restaurant failed to pay its March rent. At the time, they were agreeing to pay $52,000 plus another $10,000 for taxes and water.</p>

<p>Despite the eviction, walk-outs, and disgruntled employees, the reaction from Les Halles owner Philippe Lajaunie sounds rather bizarre. He told Eater that eviction cases were &quot;very normal&quot; for restaurants and he seems unconcerned to the point of blas&#xE9; about the restaurant&apos;s future, noting he&apos;s hoping to open up another Les Halles somewhere else (there&apos;s still a Les Halles in the Financial District). The site even describes him as &quot;chipper.&quot; </p>
