<p>Sandy&apos;s wrath is being felt all over the city, from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150414101531/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/30/gorgeous_photos_of_greenpoint_durin.php#photo-1">massive flooding</a> to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150414101531/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/30/50_homes_destroyed_in_6-alarm_breez.php">devastating fires on Breezy Point</a>. With <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150414101531/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/30/con_ed_may_take_a_week_to_restore_p.php">news about power outages</a> looking bleak, local shelters will be filling up with evacuees seeking refuge from damaged homes. Organizations across the city and state are seeking volunteers to aid in shelters and are beseeching people to donate money to relief funds. If you are able to leave your home safely and want to help, here are options for volunteering your time as well as some options for donations:</p>

<p><strong>New York Cares</strong> is accepting volunteer applications <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150414101531/http://newyorkcares.org/volunteer/disaster/">through their website</a>, especially if you&apos;ve attended a New York Care orientation sometime in the recent past. Updates about where to volunteer will be updated throughout the day but for now potential volunteers should <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150414101531/http://newyorkcares.org/users/create_account.php">create an account</a> so they can be contacted if they are needed.</p>

<p><strong>John Jay High School</strong> in Park Slope, which was set up as an evacuation shelter, is looking for volunteers to work six to eight hour shifts helping out. They are also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150414101531/https://twitter.com/frogpajamas/status/263291909412368384">seeking belts and clothing</a> for men and children.</p>

<p><strong>The Red Cross</strong> is looking for volunteers to assist in shelters throughout the region. Shifts are 12-hours and volunteers work over multiple days. Training will be afforded to those without experience. Sign up by <a href="www.nyredcross.org/?nd=intake&amp;logout=1&amp;keeppage=1&amp;ep=10650">filling out an online application here</a>. At this time, individual donations or collections are <strong>not accepted</strong>. Per the Red Cross: &quot;The cost to sort, package and distribute these types of donations to disaster victims is usually greater than the cost of purchasing the items locally, and it is logistically impossible to distribute a wide variety of individual items in a meaningful and equitable way.&quot; Instead, make a financial gift via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150414101531/http://www.redcross.org/">www.redcross.org</a>, 1-800-RED-CROSS (1-800-733-2767) or text the word REDCROSS to 90999 to make a $10 donation.</p>

<p><strong>Team Rubicon</strong> has initiated <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150414101531/http://teamrubiconusa.org/breaking-news-team-rubicon-picks-a-fight-with-sandy/">&quot;Operation Greased Lightning&quot;</a> and has dispatched response teams all over Sandy&apos;s path to help with removing debris. They are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150414101531/https://fundraise.teamrubiconusa.org/checkout/donation?cid=5643">asking for donations</a> to purchase supplies like chainsaws and gasoline. </p>

<p>The <strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150414101531/http://gothamist.com/www.foodbanknyc.org/">Food Bank For New York City</a></strong> has different ways for you to get involved: You can donate by texting FBNYC to 50555&#x2014;or you can see if your local pantry or kitchen can use volunteers by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150414101531/http://www.foodbanknyc.org/our-programs/our-food-program-network/food-program-locator">going to the locator</a>.<br>

<p>And finally, from the Mayor:</p>
