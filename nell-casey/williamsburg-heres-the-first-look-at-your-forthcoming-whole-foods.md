<p>Williamsburg&apos;s yuppification train picks up speed today with the first look at look at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509205556/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/14/the_inevitable_whole_foods_williams.php">the Whole Foods</a> that&apos;s coming to Bedford Avenue. This thing looks&#x2026;bright! The pricey grocer has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509205556/http://www.rew-online.com/2013/10/02/meridian-inks-45m-deal-to-build-williambsurgs-first-whole-foods/">secured a loan</a> to the tune of $45 million to develop the property at 240 Bedford Avenue, which will contain the Whole Foods, luxury rental apartments and a New York Sports Club. </p>

<p>The enormous 150,000 square foot complex will engulf the entire block from Bedford to Berry at North 4th Street, the current site of a long-stalled construction project. Kitty-cornered <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509205556/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/04/the_best_cheese_shops_in_nyc.php">Bedford Cheese Shop</a> probably isn&apos;t too thrilled with its impending neighbors.</p>

<p>Meanwhile in Gowanus, Whole Foods <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509205556/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/23/whole_foods_gowanus_site_no_longer.php">first Brooklyn store</a> is being erected at breakneck speed. A drive by the site yesterday revealed most of the structure already intact, right on time for their opening in December.
