<p>It&apos;s official: the Metro-North bar cars are back! Connecticut Governor Dan Malloy confirmed the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170516204958/http://gothamist.com/2016/09/12/metro-north_bar_cars.php">rumors</a> of the cars&apos; return today at a press conference to announce <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170516204958/http://portal.ct.gov/Departments_and_Agencies/Office_of_the_Governor/Press_Room/Press_Releases/2016/09-2016/Gov__Malloy_Announces_Decision_to_Purchase_60_Additional_Rail_Cars_for_Expanded_Capacity_on_the_New_Haven_Line/">added rail cars</a> on the New Haven line. Of the 60 new rail cars being added to the fleet, 10 will be &quot;cafe cars&#x2014;popularly known as bar cars.&quot;</p>

<p>Along with the announcement came preliminary renderings of said cafe cars, revealing a more modern and, sadly, charmless update to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170516204958/http://gothamist.com/2014/05/10/photos_video_farewell_metro-norths.php#photo-5">retro cars</a>. What we&apos;re seeing: a lot of coat hooks and counters, not enough faux wood paneling and &apos;70s color schemes. At first glance it looks like a boring ass space ship or a prison cell with coat racks, but hey, look at all those handholds, baby! </p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="091316barcars2.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170516204958im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_nellcasey/091316barcars2.jpg" width="640" height="336"> <br> <i> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170516204958/https://www.flickr.com/photos/governordanmalloy/29032043574/in/photostream/">Flickr</a>)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>The Governor has stressed that these renderings are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170516204958/https://twitter.com/GovMalloyOffice/status/775750151155617792">PRELIMINARY</a> and the design could change when the fleet actually rolls out, meaning maybe we&apos;ll some <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170516204958/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/27/poetry_in_motion_is_coming_back_to.php">poetry in motion</a> at least. A timeline for the rollout hasn&apos;t been announced yet, so we&apos;ll be brown bagging it for the near future.</p>
