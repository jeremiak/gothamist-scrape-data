<p>Staten Island&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160628083142/http://theflagshipbrewery.com/">Flagship Brewing Company</a> debuts their <strong>first food pop-up today in their festive taproom</strong>. Bay Ridge transplant Ho&apos; Brah, which moved into the borough last year, will be swinging by the St. George brewery bringing their flavorful tacos and Tex-Mex cuisine beginning at 6 p.m. this evening. The brewery will also be hosting some local musicians beginning at 8 p.m. and naturally, it&apos;s also an excellent opportunity to sample their lineup of beers made on-premises. It&apos;s just a short walk from the ferry.</p>

<p>Over in Williamsburg&apos;s Southside, casual soccer bar <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160628083142/http://banterbrooklyn.com/">Banter</a> is celebrating five years slinging brews and whiskies on Havemeyer Street. They&apos;re doing an <strong>all NYC tap takeover</strong> with over 20 offerings from Other Half, Gun Hill, Singlecut and beyond, including some &quot;rare&quot; varieties. Beers are just $3 tonight from 7 p.m. to 10 p.m., with $4 shots of Tullamore Dew available for the entire weekend. If you miss the festivities, they&apos;ll still be offering $7 flights from the NYC lineup all month. </p>
