	<p>The Lower East Side&apos;s popular weekend market destination triumphantly returns for its fourth year at Seward Park at the end of this month. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130520020019/http://www.hesterstreetfair.com/">Hester Street Fair</a>, which operates on the site of a historical pushcart market, combines a flea market with a food market, selling goods for your home, wardrobe and body, as well as a curated list of artisanal food and beverage vendors.</p>

<p>All told there will be 22 food vendors this year, a marked increase from previous incarnations. Enduring favorites like Luke&apos;s Lobster, La Newyorkina and Daisy Dukes are all back for another year. Newcomers this year are Deviant Chef, offering burgers and short rib/kimchi risotto balls; Khao Man Gai, serving traditional Thai street food; and Chinese Mirch, a fusion Indian, Canonese, Hakka and Szechuan vendor. Thirst quenchers from Bubbly Tea, Lizzmonade and Heartbeet Juicery will also be on hand and farm fresh produce can also be purchased from Rachel Mae&apos;s Farmstand should you want to create your own vegetal masterpiece at home.</p>

<p>The fair runs every Saturday from April 27th through September 26th from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130520020019/http://www.hesterstreetfair.com/#!hester-nights/c7h0">Hester Nights</a>, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130520020019/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/15/the_hester_street_fair_brings_twili.php">twilight food festival</a> at the Eventi Hotel plaza, begins May 2nd and runs every Thursday until September 26th.
