The midtown institution celebrated its 100th anniversary this year, and is just now expanding across the East River (there are also two Japanese franchises and a small outpost in Newark airport).</p>

<p>The new restaurant channels some of its predecessor, with inlaid brick archways mimicking the GCT location&apos;s signature arches. Charming ring-shaped chandeliers sport models of different kinds of boats; in a separate dining room, a lacquered fish keeps watch over space-age white chairs and tables. There is also seating at both the raw bar and some stools that peek into the restaurant&apos;s kitchen, were you&apos;ll have a front row seat as chef&apos;s assemble Oyster Bar favorites like their comforting pan roasts and freshly-shucked oysters.</p>

<p>The Brooklyn outpost won&apos;t have quite the same dizzying array of seafood and clam shack specials, but they&apos;ll still offer Bluepoint, Wellfleet and Paradise Island oysters plus Littleneck clams, live lobsters and a catch-of-the-day from their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507113544/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/29/brooklyn_2.php">onsite fish market</a>. Classic dishes like the Pan Roasts, Oysters Rockefeller, Clams Casino and Shrimp Cocktail will be on offer aside more humble dishes like crab cake sandwiches, fried clams and New England and Manhattan-style clam chowders.</p>

<p>For the first few weeks expect a paired down menu of &quot;light fare&quot; like the raw oysters, smoked salmon, fried calamari, fish tacos and lobster rolls as the kitchen gets in full swing. The restaurant opens this Wednesday, December 18th and will serve lunch and dinner seven days a week plus brunch on Sundays.</p>
