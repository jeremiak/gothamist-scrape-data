					<p>The city of Montreal offers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171008125103/http://gothamist.com/2014/12/12/a_300_weekend_in_montreal.php">many lovely reasons to visit</a>, including excellent cycling infrastructure, a robust craft beer scene, and  Quebecoise cuisine, including its famous entry into the french fry oeuvre: poutine, the messy french fries/cheese curds/gravy dish beloved by buzzed Montrealers. While a trip to Canada should be part of everyone&apos;s <strike>escape plan</strike> travel goal, a G train ride to Greenpoint now brings you pretty close from a culinary perspective, with a new restaurant called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171008125103/https://gentrybistro.com/password">The Gentry</a> bringing the cuisines of our northerly neighbors within subway shot.</p>

<p>The Gentry opened mid-March on Manhattan Avenue, a stretch known more for its pierogies than its poutine. The team&#x2014;a burgeoning restaurant group that calls itself United Restaurant Group&#x2014;interviewed over 200 chefs before connecting with Gillian Clark, a chef with a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171008125103/http://dcist.com/2011/01/chef_gillian_clark_reenacts.php">history in DC</a>, as well as a record of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171008125103/http://dcist.com/2010/12/bobby_flay_to_throwdown_with_chef_g.php">beating Bobby Flay</a> in a fried chicken throwdown. </p>

<p>Taste a version of Clark&apos;s triumphant fried chicken, which she&apos;s reimagined with French flair in the Coq Frit au Vin ($24), lightly battered fried chicken served over polenta in a red wine sauce. Ratatouille ($15), Bavette Frites (a sirloin steak, $32), and a Ham &amp; Gruyere Napoleon ($13) are all Francophone classics, but Clark has some fun with Wings &amp; Raclette ($15), a riff on a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171008125103/http://gothamist.com/2015/05/29/raclette_east_village.php">traditional melted cheese service</a> with roasted chicken wings soaking up the rich dairy sauce.</p>

<p>If you&apos;ve made it this far, you&apos;re to be rewarded with poutine riches the likes of which Brooklyn <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171008125103/http://gothamist.com/2017/02/09/poutine_week_mile_end_2017.php">rarely</a> sees. Clark has created 13 different riffs on the drunk person&apos;s saving grace, with inspirations from New Orleans, Korea and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171008125103/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/03/lobster_bisque_fries_is_poutine_for.php#photo-1">points closer</a>. Look for &quot;A L&apos;Orange&quot; ($16) made with duck confit, orange glaze and balls of fried mascarpone cheese for a very French version, or &quot;The Colonel&quot; ($14) with chicken nuggets, gravy, grilled corn and ricotta for a very American one. Finally, an ode to the neighborhood with the &quot;Manhattan Avenue&quot; ($13), fries topped with kielbasa, sauekraut and pepper jack cheese. </p>
