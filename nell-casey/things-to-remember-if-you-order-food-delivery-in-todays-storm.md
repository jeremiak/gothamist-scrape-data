<p>Remember yesterday&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170211151859/http://gothamist.com/2017/02/08/anthropocene_style.php#photo-1">soulful early spring</a>? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170211151859/http://gothamist.com/2017/02/09/winter_storm_snow_nyc.php#photo-1">LOL</a>. </p>

<p>Today, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170211151859/http://gothamist.com/2017/02/08/snow_day_nyc_schools_closed_thursda.php">schools</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170211151859/http://gothamist.com/2017/02/09/snow_flights_canceled.php">most of the airports</a> are closed, people <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170211151859/https://twitter.com/DianaOlick/status/829670153445048320">aren&apos;t leaving their homes</a>, and snow&apos;s accumulating faster than rats in the new Second Avenue Subway.</p>

<p>Time for delivery!</p>

<p>If you&apos;re choosing to make another human being traverse the frozen wasteland for your lunch or dinner today, here are a few things to keep in mind:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Throw money at delivery folks.</strong> Not literally, of course, but you&apos;re paying for the <em>incredible convenience</em> of not having to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170211151859/http://gothamist.com/2010/12/28/williamsburg_becomes_ice_planet_hot.php">venture into Hoth</a>. Calculate the amount for a proper 20% tip&#x2014;then add on multiple extra dollars.</li>
<li><strong>Tip in cash.</strong> Damn <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170211151859/https://www.irs.gov/">The Man</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170211151859/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pAII6UO810">save the empire</a>!</li>
<li><strong>Have a little&#x2014;nay, a lot of&#x2014;patience.</strong> It&apos;s not just that the entire city will be Thinking Delivery, they don&apos;t make chains for bicycle tires, meaning some serious leg work involved to clear a path. It&apos;s gonna take a lot longer than usual. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170211151859/http://giphy.com/gifs/guy-deal-with-it-uY0lFjVSvHPeU">Deal with it</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Tolerate the tepid soup.</strong> On that patience point, did you notice that with the piles of fluffy white stuff also comes frigid temps? If your food arrives cold, chillax. That&apos;s why baby Jesus gave us microwaves.</li>
<li><strong>Consider meeting them at your building&apos;s front door.</strong> Time = money, and the time spent hauling stuff up your fifth floor walkup could be better spent on their way to the next drop off. Plus, bike parking can be tough <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170211151859/http://gothamist.com/2017/02/09/winter_storm_snow_nyc.php#photo-1">in a foot high snowdrift</a>. Do these folks, and yourself, a favor by going downstairs to meet them. The city is your gym!</li>
</ul>

<p>And remember to say thank you. It&apos;s not as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170211151859/http://gothamist.com/2017/02/08/go_hug_this_dog_right_now.php#photo-1">good as a hug</a>, but a sincere thank you should be part of your repertoire regardless of the weather.</p>
