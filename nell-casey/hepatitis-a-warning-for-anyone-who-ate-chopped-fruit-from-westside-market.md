<p>If you enjoyed some chopped, ready-to-eat watermelon, pineapple or coconut from the UWS outpost of Westside Market this month you may have been exposed to Hepatitis A. The Health Department is warning customers that chopped fruit sold in the store or offered via catering or delivery from August 9th to August 22nd may have been contaminated with Hepatitis A. Anyone who may have come in contact with the tainted fruit to get vaccinated immediately.</p>

<p>Hepatitis A is spread by ingesting food that&apos;s been contaminated by traces of fecal matter from an infected person&#x2014;gag. A male worker at the market was recently diagnosed with the disease; after the discovery, the market thoroughly cleaned its facility and asked any workers who may have been exposed to get vaccinated and take a small leave of absence. So far no customers have reported illness, but symptoms include jaundice (yellowing of eyes and skin), fatigue, abdominal pain, nausea, and diarrhea.</p>

<p>The Health Department is offering free hepatitis A vaccinations starting today at MS 258: Community Action School located at 154 West 93rd Street at the following times:<br>
 <br>
Today, August 23: 2 p.m. - 8 p.m.<br>
Saturday, August 24:  10 a.m. - 2 p.m.<br>
Sunday, August 25:  2 p.m. - 6 p.m.<br>
Monday, August 26:  2 p.m. - 8 p.m.</p>
