<p>Avert your gaze, vegetarians, because the city&apos;s biggest celebration of all things pork returns to Manhattan January 24th and it wants to get us drunk&#x2014;on bacon and bourbon. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160630072007/http://cochon555.com/">Cochon 555</a> serves as both a competition for chefs but, more importantly for us, an opportunity to devour the fruits of their labor, which center around the meat from a heritage breed pig. Oh and they ply you with alcohol (and cheese and oysters and, this year, ramen) so don&apos;t expect Monday to be a party for your stomach or your head.</p>

<p>The main attraction are stations devoted to five chefs, each of whom is tasked with breaking down and manipulating one locally-raised, heritage breed pig each into a maximum of six dishes. I remember a particularly good fried rice dish from last year, but undoubtably <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160630072007/http://cochon555.com/2016-tour/new-porc-city/">this year&apos;s competitors</a> will bring their own unique vision. As has been the trend, female chefs are well-represented here, including Angie Mar (The Beatrice Inn) and Hillary Sterling (Vic&#x2019;s); Erika Nakamura (The Breslin) will also be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160630072007/http://gothamist.com/2015/01/05/cochon_555_1.php">reprising her role</a> as the event&apos;s on-site butcher. </p>

<p>The sexy but cramped hallways of last year&apos;s hotel venue have been replaced with the stately <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160630072007/http://www.weylinbseymours.com/">Weylin B. Seymour&apos;s</a>, formerly known as the Williamsburgh Savings Bank. Inside, the 36 dishes&#x2014;and 2,000 pounds of pork&#x2014;prepared by the chefs; multiple bars serving bourbon, wine, cider and other hooch; plus seafood, cheese and Prosciutto di Parma stations. Tickets are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160630072007/http://events.cochon555.com/new_york_city_2016">$125 GA</a> for an all-you-can-eat-and-drink free-for-all from 5 p.m. to 8 p.m., meaning you&apos;ll be home in time to drunk watch <em>Downton Abbey</em>.</p>

<p><em>This post has been updated to reflect a change in venue.</em></p>
