<p>Following an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130609233440/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/01/east_village_smac_shuttered_by_heal.php">embarrassing closure by the Department of Health</a>, S&apos;Mac&apos;s East Village location has officially reopened its doors this week. The restaurant was shuttered last week after racking up an impressive 71 violation points for various offenses, including evidence of mice and soiled wiping cloths. After taking some time to make &quot;emergency repairs,&quot; owner Caesar Ekya is eager to put the troubling ordeal behind him:</p>

<blockquote>In the 7 years that we have been at this location this is the first time we have had an inspection go this bad, and we want to make sure this is the last time it ever happens. &#xA0;It was a shock to all of us last week and led us to make some personnel and training changes so this shouldn&apos;t happen again.</blockquote>

<p>The restaurant was reinspected on Monday and earned a very respectable score of 3 points, though they won&apos;t receive a letter grade until a followup visit in a few weeks. The website hasn&apos;t been updated to reflect it, but they&apos;re back baking up their delicious crocks of molten cheese pasta <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130609233440/http://www.smacnyc.com/where.html">during regular business hours</a>. </p>
