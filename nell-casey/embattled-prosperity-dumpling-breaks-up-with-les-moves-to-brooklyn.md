<p>Like so many <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016134149/http://gothamist.com/2016/05/17/missing_columbia_student_in_brooklyn.php">before them</a>, Prosperity Dumpling is fleeing their Manhattan home on the Lower East Side for a fresh start in Brooklyn. The embattled dumpling shop will be reopening in Bensonhurst, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016134149/http://www.boweryboogie.com/2016/06/prosperity-dumpling-gives-les-ships-brooklyn-instead/">reports Bowery Boogie</a>, abandoning the bad vibes on Eldridge Street for less <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016134149/http://gothamist.com/2015/08/26/prosperity_dumpling_uh_oh.php">rat-filled alleys</a> on 86th Street. </p>

<p>Word earlier this year indicated the dollar dumpling spot would <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016134149/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/21/prosperity_dumpling_lives.php">stay in the neighborhood</a>, but a rep for the restaurant now says they&apos;ll be opening up at 2369 86th Street&#x2014;a whole borough away. The restaurant&apos;s likely hoping denizens of the neighborhood <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016134149/http://gothamist.com/2015/08/31/prosperity_dumpling_doh_report_car.php">don&apos;t follow local news</a>. </p>

<p>Sadly, Prosperity&apos;s Clinton Street location <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016134149/http://www.boweryboogie.com/2016/05/cc-prosperity-dumpling-offshoot-likewise-closes-shop-clinton-street/">also shut down</a>, but both will live on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016134149/http://gothamist.com/2015/09/02/prosperity_phil.php">in our hearts</a> until their triumphant return off the D line.</p>
