<p>It may look like a mound of sweet frosting, but don&apos;t let these beautiful cupcakes deceive you: that&apos;s a scoop of ice cream on top. </p>

<p>The treats are a creation of Judy Lai at her Forest Hills bakery <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170615182521/https://www.silkcakes.com/">Silk Cakes</a>, which has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170615182521/https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/wVoDRk9IRSK78fZuXbzF">regularly</a> turned out fluffy frosting-topped cupcakes <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170615182521/https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20140127/forest-hills/silk-cakes-opens-takeout-store-forest-hills">since opening a retail shop</a> in 2014. Recently, Lai&#x2014;who was the former cake chef at the International Culinary Center in Manhattan before opening her first boutique cake enterprise on the LES&#x2014;decided to switch things up and combine a favorite summertime treat with something baked.</p>

<p>&quot;I wanted to come up with a summer offering and decided to take two very popular desserts that we grew up eating (ice cream and cupcakes) and combined them into one perfect summer treat!&quot; Lai tells us. She began selling the cupcakes <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170615182521/http://www.amny.com/eat-and-drink/nyc-ice-cream-the-most-indulgent-desserts-to-eat-now-1.11830110">briefly last summer</a>, but this year she&apos;s expanded the number of offerings with some new flavor combinations.  </p>

<p>&quot;When we were brainstorming flavors for the ice cream cupcakes, we knew vanilla and chocolate were the most popular ice cream flavors but wanted an Asian-inspired twist to them,&quot; Lai explains. &quot;We came up with pandan, as it is deemed the southeast Asian vanilla and pairs perfectly with coconut and a vanilla cupcake base. The chocolate needed an Asian twist too, so we put nama chocolate bits into the ice cream and paired it with a chocolate cupcake. &apos;Nama&apos; is a very decadent type of chocolate that was invented in Japan. It has a really high percentage of cream that results in an indulgent melt-in-your-mouth texture.&quot;</p>

<p>For the third new flavor, Lai wanted to explore fruit flavors and mined ingredients from across Asia. What she came up with was the yuzu with lychee ice cream and kalamansi glaze, with nods to lychee&apos;s long cultivation history in China; the popularity of kalamansi, a lime-like citrus fruit from the Philippines; and yuzu, a common citrus ingredient in Japanese cuisine.</p>

<p>&quot;I am a first-generation Chinese Americas who grew up on the Lower East Side,&quot; Lai says. &quot;There&apos;s a tension of identity that comes with being a first generation Asian American and I created Silk Cakes to bridge my American and Asian identities by creating desserts that are western in format but Asian in flavor.&quot;</p>

<p>To that end, she embraces the &quot;foods masquerading as other foods&quot; idea that&apos;s been a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170615182521/http://gothamist.com/2015/06/15/sushi_burrito_fine_whatever.php">pervasive</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170615182521/http://gothamist.com/tags/ramenburger">trend</a> in recent years. &quot;Hybrid trends are a true reflection of the melting pot in America,&quot; Lai concludes. &quot;The desserts we create identify who we are as Asian Americans.&quot;</p>

<p>Lai&apos;s new cupcakes will set you back $5 a pop.</p>
