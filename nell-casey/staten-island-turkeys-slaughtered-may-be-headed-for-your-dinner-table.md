<p>A day of reckoning has come for some of Staten Island&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150227030450/http://gothamist.com/2010/11/10/staten_island_locals_fear_wild_turk.php">roving gangs</a> of wild turkeys. Starting yesterday, the USDA began rounding up the rogue birds that have been chilling on the lawn of the South Beach Psychiatric Center, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150227030450/http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2013/08/feds_round_up_wild_turkeys_on.html">according to the Staten Island <em>Advance</em></a>. The &quot;capture removal&quot; operation will transport the birds to a slaughterhouse; relocation wasn&apos;t an option, as the flock contains &quot;hybrid turkeys.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150227030450/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVspqShcXSA">Turkey Turf Troubles</a>?</p>

<p>According to a psychiatric center worker, USDA officials &quot;were picking the turkeys up by their necks and feet, and throwing them into plastic crates.&quot; USDA spokeswoman Carol Bannerman puts it a bit more gently, explaining that turkeys are herded into temporary corrals made of netting, hand-captured, and placed in poultry crates.&quot; From there, the doomed fowl head to a processing facility where their meat will be tested for &quot;suitability for donation for human consumption.&quot;</p>

<p>Officials cite &quot;excessive feces&quot; and general turkey aggression as reason for the culling. Some locals, many <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150227030450/http://gothamist.com/2010/12/14/wild_turkey.php"><em>fearing for their lives</em></a>, have wanted the birds removed; others enjoy <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150227030450/http://instagram.com/p/ay9mGWr0WG/">Instagramming them</a>; and still others enjoy <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150227030450/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/09/free_turkeys_in_staten_island_if_yo.php">illegally eating them</a>. If the meat passes inspection, some lucky (?) folks will get to taste true Staten Island terroir, and it&apos;s probably better than <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150227030450/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/22/staten_island_dump_hires_goat_herd.php">dump goat</a>!</p>
