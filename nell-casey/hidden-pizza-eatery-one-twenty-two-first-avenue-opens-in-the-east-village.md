                            <p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130807030316/http://www.southbrooklynpizza.com/">South Brooklyn Pizza</a>, the casual slice joint in the East Village, has a new addition to its space on 1st Avenue near St. Mark&apos;s Place. Starting tomorrow, pizzeria owner James McGown will also operate <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130807030316/http://www.122firstavenue.com/">One Twenty-Two First Avenue</a>, a combination outdoor bar and Italian-heavy eatery serving al fresco cocktails and inventive pizzas in a space that surrounds the small pizza parlor. </p>

<p>The front bar of the new venture opens directly onto First Avenue, without any kind of door separating the sidewalk from the drinking area. There you can sip on a glass of beer or wine or one of the cocktails by Stanton Social and Beauty &amp; Essexy alum Michelle Morgan like the Bramble Mojito and Bitter Irishman. A narrow passage past the bar takes you to a small dining area with working fireplaces when the weather turns chilly again. Continue on and you&apos;ll discover another hidden rear dining room with a cozy brick floor, a smattering of rustic wooden tables and enormous windows that look out onto an as-yet-opened outdoor atrium. </p>

<p>McGown tapped Chef Samm Dimakis, formerly of Dos Caminos, to create a menu that evoked the neighborhood&apos;s Italian-American heritage and other groups who once populated the area. Caesar Salad ($9) comes topped with lots of fresh white anchovies and Meatballs ($7) are swimming in a spicy tomato bath with basil and grana padano. The chef cranks out ten original, personal-sized pizza pies from a traditional Margherita ($12) to the Bacon &amp; Blue ($15) with Gorgonzola, bacon and burnt cherry tomato and the L.E.S pizza ($14) with piles of fresh smoked salmon, shaved red onion and arugula on a base of caper cream. Two different lasagnas, a baked manchego cheese dish and a roasted garlic bulb served with bread, cheese and butter also make use of the pizza oven.</p>

<p><em>122&#xA0;1st Avenue near St. Mark&#x2019;s, 212-533-2809. Open daily 5 p.m. to 2 a.m. with daytime and brunch hours to come.</em></p>
