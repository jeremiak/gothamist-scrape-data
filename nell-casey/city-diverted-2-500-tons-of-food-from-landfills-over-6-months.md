<p>A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150303144731/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/14/waste_not_bloomberg_wants_nyers_to.php">composting pilot program</a> that began earlier this year has hit its stride at the six month mark. The Mayor&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150303144731/http://www.nyc.gov/html/planyc2030/html/theplan/solid-waste.shtml">Food Waste Challenge</a>, which seeks to reduce food products in our landfills, announced that 2,500 tons of food have been saved from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150303144731/http://gothamist.com/tags/statenislanddump">banishment to the outer boroughs</a>. </p>

<p>Each year, 1.2 million tons of food waste end up in landfills at a price of nearly $80 per ton. In an effort to reduce greenhouse-gas producing landfill waste, the city partnered with over 100 restaurants, who agreed to alter their food disposal system so that unused food could either be donated to non-profits and food banks or turned into <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150303144731/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/02/no_backyard_you_too_can_compost_her.php#photo-1">nutrient-rich, organic fertilizer</a>. Though restaurants are the biggest culprits in food waste, similar programs like the Department of Sanitation&apos;s organic waste collection take compostable items from homes and schools, adding to the overall total.</p>

<p>The FWC is part of the city&apos;s larger initiative, PlaNYC, which seeks to divert 75% of all waste from landfills by 2030. It&apos;s a tall order, considering New Yorkers generate 14 millions tons of waste each year; half gets recycled, a quarter comes from civilians and the other quarter from businesses, offices and manufacturing. Together with programs like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150303144731/http://www.nyc.gov/html/greenyc/html/home/home.shtml">GreeNYC</a> and the increase of online tools that reduce the need for printed paper, the plan is on track to meet its goal. Regardless, let&apos;s hope we <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150303144731/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/22/staten_island_dump_hires_goat_herd.php">keep the cute goats</a>. </p>
