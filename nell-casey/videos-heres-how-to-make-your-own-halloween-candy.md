<p>For most of us, the days of the big Halloween candy haul are over, unless you&apos;re a monster who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422205030/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/03/video_sorry_kids_we_ate_all_your_ha.php">eats all your kid&apos;s crap</a>. But still, the candy worms its way into our homes and offices, and, let&apos;s face it, a lot of it is sort of disgusting. So instead of eating those sad leftover gummy worms no one wants, here&apos;s how you can whip up some sugary sweets on your own. Plus, if you&apos;re sourcing your ingredients locally <em>like the good yupster you are</em>, you avoid the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422205030/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/29/halloween-candy-ingredients_n_2012051.html#slide=1682483">terrifying additives</a> that make your favorite candy &quot;shelf stable.&quot; SpoooOOOOoooky!</p>

<p>We found some informative and fun videos that teach you how to make your All Hallows Eve favs in case you <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422205030/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/24/weekend_food_events_2.php">can&apos;t find anything else to do this weekend</a>.</p>

<p><strong>CANDY CORN</strong></p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="102513candycorn.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422205030im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_nellcasey/102513candycorn.jpg" width="640" height="314" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>For some reason this saccharine treat gets a bad rap among certain sugar addicts while other can&apos;t get enough of the melt-in-your-mouth corn syrup goodness. If you fall into the latter camp, the brainiacs at Harvard came up with a simple recipe for constructing your own wedge-shaped candies that you can make in a snap. (Recipe via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422205030/http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2010/10/31/dough-sugar-each-one/">Harvard Crimson Flyby</a>)</p>

<ul>
<li>2 1/2 cups confectioners&apos; sugar</li>
<li>1/4 cup dry powdered milk</li>
<li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
<li>1 cup sugar</li>
<li>2/3 cup corn syrup</li>
<li>1/3 cup unsalted butter</li>
<li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
<li>Food coloring</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>SNICKERS</strong></p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="102513snickers.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422205030im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_nellcasey/102513snickers.jpg" width="640" height="328" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>The rich caramel, the melty chocolate, the salty peanuts&#x2014;all of the things that make a Snickers bar so satisfying. YouTube&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422205030/http://www.youtube.com/user/CookingwithKarma?feature=watch">Cooking With Karma</a> has a simple and fun to make recipe for the popular candy with a dope Aussie accent to boot. </p>

<ul>
<li>4 1/2 cups milk chocolate, melted</li>
<li>6 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
<li>1 cup of superfine sugar (you can also use a blender/food processor to grind regular sugar)</li>
<li>1/4 cup and 1/3 cup evaporated milk</li>
<li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
<li>1/2 cup smooth peanut butter</li>
<li>2 cups marshmallows</li>
<li>1 1/2 cups salted roasted peanuts, chopped</li>
<li>1 1/2 cups soft caramels</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>PEANUT BUTTER CUPS</strong></p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="102513pbcups.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422205030im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_nellcasey/102513pbcups.jpg" width="640" height="458" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>The greatest of all the Halloween candies&#x2014;there I said it! These bad boys were never part of the post-haul barter system set up after each Trick or Treating run because they are simply too precious to trade away for three Tootsie rolls and a Butterfinger. Instead of making <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422205030/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gUETGGipkas">dainty individual cups</a>, take after these bros and make one <em>giant</em> peanut butter cup to rule them all!</p>

<ul>
<li>A boatload of milk chocolate, chopped</li>
<li>A crapload of confectioners sugar</li>
<li>A big &apos;ole Costco-sized jar of smooth peanut butter</li>
<li>Salt</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>&quot;COVER ANYTHING IN CHOCOLATE&quot; CANDY</strong></p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="102513choco_candy.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422205030im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_nellcasey/102513choco_candy.jpg" width="640" height="427"> <br> <i> <span class="photo_caption">(<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422205030/http://www.shutterstock.com/gallery-523849p1.html">ninikas</a>/<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422205030/http://www.shutterstock.com/index-in.mhtml">Shutterstock</a>)</span></i></div> <p></p>

<p>We&apos;re certainly not implying that candy-making is easy but there&apos;s an inherent truth that everything tastes good covered in chocolate. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422205030/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/15/photos_cricket_canapes_cookies_and.php#photo-13">Everything</a>. So when it comes to making quick, easy, no-muss candy to stuff in your face, all you need are a few ingredients:</p>

<p></p><li>Milk/Dark/Semi-sweet/White chocolate, chopped</li><br>
<li>Cereal, dried fruit, nuts, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422205030/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vD0_eTHQJlU">a friend</a>, pretzels, whatever</li><br>
<li>A pinch of salt (everything also tastes better with salt)</li><br>
<p></p>

<p>Melt the chocolate bits in a double boiler (fine, fine, slowly in the microwave). </p>

<p>Meanwhile, break up your desired filling into chunks/bits and arrange on a parchment-lined cookie sheet. </p>

<p>Once the chocolate is melted, either drizzle the chocolate over the clusters of filling or dip them into the molten mess using a spoon. Sprinkle each nest with a pinch of salt and set on the parchment until set.</p>

<p>Eat.</p>
