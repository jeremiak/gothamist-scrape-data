(<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170228104408/https://www.facebook.com/nycbeerweek/photos/a.10154030303857136.1073741827.29980712135/10154030305152136/?type=3&amp;theater">Facebook</a>)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>Here&apos;s another reason to drink this weekend: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170228104408/http://nycbeerweek.com/">New York City Beer Week</a> begins its 11-day (that&apos;s more like two weeks, people) run on Friday night, with the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170228104408/http://www.openingbash.com/">official kick off party</a> on Saturday in Greenpoint. Over the course of the hoppy celebration, dozens of breweries, beer bars and restaurants, and beer-related venues host tap takeovers, dinners, tastings, tours and even beer-related trivia events across the five boroughs. </p>

<p>To go <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170228104408/http://nycbeerweek.com/2017-beer-week/">check off everything on the list</a> would be extreme, but the NYC Brewers Guild, who organize the annual event, have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170228104408/http://nycbeerweek.com/featured-events/">featured events</a> like the opening bash, the all-inclusive tasting event <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170228104408/http://nycbrewerschoice.com/">NYC Brewer&apos;s Choice</a>, and beer adjacent activities like the first annual <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170228104408/http://nycfermentationfestival.com/">NYC Fermentation Festival</a>.</p>

<p>Many of the smaller events combine food with beer, like a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170228104408/http://nycbeerweek.com/2017-beer-week/ny-beer-cheese-pairing-class/">beer and cheese pairing class</a> at The Wine Lab, while others latch on to more esoteric adventures like the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170228104408/http://nycbeerweek.com/2017-beer-week/swedes-singing-for-beer/">Swedes Singing For Beer</a> event, a combination bar crawl and sing-along. Peep the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170228104408/http://nycbeerweek.com/2017-beer-week/">full lineup here</a> and remember to eat something before drinking and wear a jacket. Love, Mom.</p>
