You can never have too much of a good thing&#x2014;at least, that&apos;s what we tell ourselves after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426151158/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/04/you_should_be_eating_these_4_new_da.php">eating <em>all</em> the cheese</a>&#x2014;so let&apos;s welcome the newest addition to our local griddled sandwich obsession: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426151158/http://thepullmankitchen.com/">The Pullman Kitchen</a>. Opening today on a restaurant-dense stretch of 2nd Avenue in Midtown, the new restaurant offers a relaxed environment to enjoy a sandwich and a microbrew or two. They&apos;ve brought aboard <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426151158/http://gothamist.com/2008/11/24/buttermilk_channel_set_to_open_tomo.php#photo-1">Buttermilk Channel</a> alum Bruce Dillon to help with the menu, which includes 10 different grilled cheese sandwiches, a handful of starters, salads and soup and a curated selection of craft beers and cocktails.</p>

<p>It almost goes without saying at this point that any new restaurant will offer &quot;locally made cheeses, artisanal breads, cured meats, specialty spreads and seasonal produce.&quot; There&apos;s the Pullman Classic ($7.95), the basic offering with NY Sharp Cheddar and Beefsteak Tomatoes on Pullman Bread&#x2014;add Nueske bacon for an extra $3. </p>

<p>From there, things get a little zanier, like the Pullman Pierogi Melt ($11.95) with Spinach &amp; Potato Pierogi, NY Cheddar and Vodka Kraut melted between two slices of sourdough and Chicken &amp; Waffles ($12.95) with Buttermilk Fried Chicken, Pepperjack Cheese and Vermont Maple on Cornbread Waffles. Finally, the knife-and-fork-required Sunday Supper ($12.95), a Sloppy Joe-esque sammy with Slow-Cooked Pork and Beef Bolognese, Housemade Ricotta, Lioni Fresh Mozzarella on Pullman Bread.</p>

<p>There&apos;s a Creamy Tomato Soup ($4.95) on the menu, natch, plus House Made Pickles ($4.95) and a Farro &amp; Kale salad ($10.95) if you simply must be healthful about it. They&apos;re doing up the beer list right&#x2014;the owners also run two nearby bars&#x2014;with local New York beers like the seasonal Southern Tier Pumking ($8), Captain Lawrence Freshchester Pale Ale ($7) and the latest <em>Game of Thrones</em>-inspired Ommegang brew <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426151158/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/18/ommegang_reveals_second_game_of_thr.php">Take The Black Stout</a>.</p>

<p><em>The Pullman Kitchen is located at 959 Second Avenue between 51st and 52nd Streets, 212-888- 7404; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426151158/http://thepullmankitchen.com/">thepullmankitchen.com</a>.
