<p>Looks like a road trip to Connecticut will be in order this spring when Hollywood&apos;s famed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420053333/http://www.pinkshollywood.com/index.html">Pink&apos;s Hot Dogs</a> makes its big <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420053333/http://www.nbcconnecticut.com/entertainment/the-scene/Pinks-Hollywood-Hot-Dogs-Coming-to-Lake-Compounce-248992461.html">East Coast debut</a>. The legendary hot dog stand turned tubular empire opens inside <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420053333/http://www.lakecompounce.com/">Lake Compounce</a> amusement park on Saturday, May 17th, bringing their beloved chili dogs and celeb-themed hot dogs to a salivating fanbase on this side of the country.</p>

<p>Paul and Betty Pink <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420053333/http://laist.com/2010/06/20/meet_the_family_behind_pinks_hot_do.php">began their hot dog operation</a> as a pushcart in 1939 but have since expanded to include multiple locations in California and Las Vegas. Until now, they&apos;ve only ventured as far east as Ohio. The new vendor stand will operate across from the family-friendly park&apos;s carousel&#x2014;a far cry from the late-night revelers who line up for the restaurant&apos;s LA offerings. </p>

<p>The Bristol, CT amusement park is a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420053333/http://www.lakecompounce.com/hours-and-directions/directions">quick two-hour drive</a> from Manhattan and worth a visit even without hot dogs. It&apos;s the oldest continually-operating amusement park in North America&#x2014;it opened in 1846&#x2014;and has a top-rated wooden roller coaster that tops out at 60 miles per hour. Best to get that in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420053333/http://www.pinkshollywood.com/menu/marthastewartdog.html">pre-Martha Stewart dog</a>.</p>
