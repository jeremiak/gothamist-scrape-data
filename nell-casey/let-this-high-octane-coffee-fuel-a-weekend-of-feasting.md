<p>Celebrating 85 years of cheap hot dogs and fruity smoothies, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170307123017/http://www.papayaking.com/">Papaya King</a> rolls back (way back) prices today and Saturday at their two NYC locations. The restaurants will be selling hot dogs and the brand&apos;s Papaya Tropical Drinks for just 32 cents. Dogs can be topped with kraut, NY onions or relish without adding any pennies, but those curly fries are gonna cost you 2017 prices.</p>
