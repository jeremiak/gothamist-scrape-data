</div></div>					<p>If a croissant and an empanada coupled up they&apos;d produce something along the lines of the Thai puff pastries being served at Hell&apos;s Kitchen newcomer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150409131406/https://www.facebook.com/puffchanyc">Puff Cha</a>. They&apos;re flaky on the outside, tender on the inside, and filled with either sweet or savory concoctions. If you&apos;ve ever had a Thai Curry Puff, you&apos;ll know what you&apos;re in for.</p>

<p>Thai BBQ Red Pork and Spinach Cheese skew more into empanada territory, with just enough buttery grease to make it decadent&#x2014;plus the deep fryer treatment of course. More dessert-type puffs include Sweet Taro with coconut milk, Green Tea made with matcha powder and a Banana Choco with banana, cream and chocolate. They&apos;re also offering special puffs like the Stella&apos;s Omele with egg, spinach, ham and cheddar cheese, a good snack to fuel a work day or kill a hangover. A single puff sets you back $2.49 or snag a dozen for $23.79.</p>

<p>Some tea might help offset all the buttery deliciousness and the shop offers lovely clear pots that can be filled with over 40 varieties of the stuff. The teas are as beautiful on the palate as they are in the pot, where some of the different components bloom when steeped in the hot water. Oolong, Pu-Erh and Jasmine-style teas are available, as are green teas from Japan and beyond. Also look out for fruit flavors like Peach Fairies and floral types like Rosebud and Lavendar. They&apos;ll also make all kinds of iced drinks like Thai Iced Tea, chai and matcha-based drinks. </p>

<p>Finally, though the puff-and-tea operation remains their primary focus, the cute cafe also does bowls of noodle soups and rice dishes. The Kao Moo Dang comes with roasted pork and a sweet sauce over Jasmine rice; the Pork Rib Noodle, served with the broth on the side, comes with roasted pork and garlic in a black sauce. </p>
