<p>It&apos;s time to briefly pretend to care about horse racing again! This Saturday is the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428203319/http://www.kentuckyderby.com/">Kentucky Derby</a>, which New Yorkers tend to observe with a surprising degree of enthusiasm, perhaps because it gives everyone a chance to dress up and day-drink a ridiculous quantity of Mint Juleps. The fanciest party for the past five years has gone down at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428203319/http://elevenmadisonpark.com/">Eleven Madison Park</a>, where the Juleps come in pewter cups, Nat Sherman hands out cigars, and your seersucker pants rim at the seams from all the Derby-inspired food long before the bugler in equestrian attire plays &#x201C;The Call&#x201D; to start the race. Unfortunately, that decadent bash is already sold out. But here are some more fun Derby parties that seem worth checking out. </p>
