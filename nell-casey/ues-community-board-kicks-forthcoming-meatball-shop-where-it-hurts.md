<p>An Upper East Side Community Board wants to put Meatball Shop&apos;s boozy balls in a vice, so to speak. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130512023257/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/18/photos_meatball_shop_opens_chelsea.php#photo-1">expanding chain</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130512023257/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20130307/upper-east-side/meatball-shop-will-draw-sauced-crowds-residents-worry">appealed to Community Board 8&apos;s Street Life Subcommittee</a> this week for approval to serve their savory balls and accompanying alcoholic beverages until 4 a.m. But they were met with contention from local residents who claim the late hours would lead to drunken carousing, disturbing the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130512023257/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/21/second_avenue_subway_blasting_still.php">tranquil thoroughfare</a> that is Second Avenue.</p>

<p>Proclaimed meatball lover and UES resident Steve Harris <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130512023257/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20130307/upper-east-side/meatball-shop-will-draw-sauced-crowds-residents-worry#ixzz2Ms8smbPq">told DNAinfo</a> he was &quot;okay&quot; with the restaurant opening but &quot;the only thing that sent shock waves was [the serving time].&quot; &quot;Four a.m., for a meatball shop?&quot; questioned another local. But Michael Chernow, co-owner of Meatball Shop, explained that &quot;people tend to eat meatballs at 12 p.m. and at 3 a.m.&quot; and stressed that Meatball Shop is first and foremost a restaurant, not a bar or nightclub. In the end, the subcommittee approved a 2 a.m. cut-off. Baltz &amp; Co., the publicist for The Meatball Shop, did not respond to our request for comment.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130512023257/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20130307/upper-east-side/meatball-shop-will-draw-sauced-crowds-residents-worry">Residents point</a> to nearby booze hall The Stumble Inn as the culprit for the neighborhood&apos;s late night shenanigans, but the nearby Brother Jimmy&apos;s BBQ up the block probably doesn&apos;t help either. Really, though, the neighborhood should be excited to welcome more refined eateries like The Meatball Shop and similar gastropubs like The Penrose and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130512023257/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/17/new_restaurants_20.php#photo-3">Jones Wood Foundry</a>. If the Upper East Side is ever going to (bar) crawl its way out from underneath its image of frat boys and preppy douches&#x2014;and as a longtime resident, I would just like to say that the UES has plenty of non-pod people, too&#x2014;it&apos;s paramount to welcome new businesses like these into the area. And remember, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130512023257/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/19/hells_kitchen_goes_to_hell_in_a_han.php">it could always be worse</a>.</p>
