<p>For one Manhattan dad, a trip to the Golden Arches will never be the same again. It goes like this: David Evan Schorr just wanted a nice one-on-one meal with his 5-year-old son, whom he sired with his now ex-wife, Bari Yunis Schorr, vice president of fancy members-only shopping site Rue La La. Schorr wanted to treat his son at their &quot;usual restaurant&quot; on October 30th, but the tyke &quot;demanded to be taken to McDonald&apos;s,&quot; a request denied by a health-conscious father who thought his son was &quot;eating too much junk food.&quot; And then, the discipline quandary faced by all parents: kowtow to a screaming brat or stick to your guns. Schorr chose the latter, to his peril, as it would turn out. </p>

According to a lawsuit filed by Schorr, the shrink declared him &quot;wholly incapable of taking care of his son&quot; and suggested he should be stripped of his weekend visitations. Schorr&apos;s lawsuit seeks a refund on the $2,750 spent on the allegedly bogus evaluation; neither Schiller nor Mrs. Schorr&apos;s attorney would comment on the burger blowup. </p>

<p>The Schorr&apos;s custody trial resumes in December and judging by recent events it&apos;s sure to be a whopper. Besides Dr. Schiller&apos;s report, Mrs. Schorr recently filed motions against her ex-husband, alleging that he disregarded court orders and didn&apos;t pay child support. In the meantime, won&apos;t someone think of little baby Schorr? Someone get that kid a Happy Meal; he should take the happy wherever he can get it.</p>
