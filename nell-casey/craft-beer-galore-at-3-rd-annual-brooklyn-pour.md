<p>The Village Voice&apos;s third annual <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130824135043/http://microapp.villagevoice.com/brooklyn-pour/2013/">Brooklyn Pour</a> returns for another round of craft beer drinking in the daytime. On Saturday, October 12th a slew of breweries both large and small take over the space at Skylight One Hanson inside the old Williamsburgh Savings Bank Clocktower. Then you&#x2014;armed with your tiny tasting glass&#x2014;shuffle from one booth to the next, sampling as many suds as possible in the three hour time slot. Trust us: it will be a lot.</p>

<p>So far 18 brewers have confirmed their attendance and organizers expect many more to be added as the event draw near. Heavy hitters like Victory Brewing Company, Brewery Ommegang and Dogfish Head Brewery set up right alongside hyper local breweries like Astoria&apos;s SingleCut Beersmiths, The Bronx Brewery and Rockaway Brewing Company. Besides beer, look out for a few ciders, wines and even spirits&#x2014;though be forewarned that mixing all three will only worsen your inevitable hangover.</p>

<p>We were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130824135043/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/08/our_5_takeaways_from_this_years_bro.php">on hand getting day drunk</a> at last year&apos;s fete and had a blast. They&apos;re back to one time slot this year after trying out two time slots last year, so expect to throw an elbow or two once things really get moving. Your best bet: either throw down the extra $30 on VIP or get in line really early.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130824135043/http://microapp.villagevoice.com/brooklyn-pour/2013/tickets.php">Tickets go on sale tomorrow at noon</a>, with GA running $50 and VIP $80. For the latter, you get an extra hour to booze before the everyone else floods in, plus free food, a swanky gift bag and access to the mezzanine, where you can peer down at the plebes below. Sales from tickets benefit arts initiative <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130824135043/http://bricartsmedia.org/">BRIC</a>, in case you needed further incentive to blow up your paycheck.</p>
