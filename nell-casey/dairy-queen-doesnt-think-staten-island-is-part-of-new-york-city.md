<p>How many slights can one borough endure? When it comes to Staten Island, the answer nears the thousands, with the latest coming from soft serve and burger factory <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429214343/http://gothamist.com/tags/dairyqueen">Dairy Queen</a>. In a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429214343/http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20140325006168/en/Start-Spreading-News-Dairy-Queen%C2%AE-System-Open#.UzGqja1dUoZ">press release</a> announcing their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429214343/http://gothamist.com/2013/12/05/dairy_queen.php">forthcoming Manhattan outpost</a>, the chain heralded their &quot;official entry into New York City&quot;...conveniently forgetting they <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429214343/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/11/dairy_queen_will_land_in_nyc_by_mem.php">opened a store on Staten Island</a> last year. Careful DQ, you don&apos;t want to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429214343/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/30/rep_grimm_says_he_wasnt_drinking_wh.php">mess with Staten Island</a>.</p>

<p>To shed light on the SI snub we reached out to the brand&apos;s publicist, who patted our hand and gently explained to us that this new location will be the first in &quot;<em><strong>actual Manhattan</strong></em>.&quot; Ahh that&apos;s right because New York City = Manhattan DUH how could we possibly have forgotten? When pressed to expound on this mystical land of actual Manhattan we received an apology, an affirmation of our correct geography and a clarification that this is the &quot;first DQ in Manhattan&quot; (54 West 14th Street between 5th and 6th Avenues). Well why didn&apos;t you say that in the first place?</p>

<p>We contacted Staten Island Borough President James Oddo&apos;s office for comment on whether he&apos;ll be heading to DQ HQ to make them answer for their disrespect and we&apos;ll update if we hear back. In the meantime, New Yorkers can go back to ribbing their fist pumping brethren to the south because that&apos;s just what older siblings do. But outsiders should think twice before messing with any part of our fearsome fivesome lest they <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429214343/http://gothamist.com/2014/03/25/staten_island_clown_probably_just_m.php">suffer the consequences</a>. </p>
