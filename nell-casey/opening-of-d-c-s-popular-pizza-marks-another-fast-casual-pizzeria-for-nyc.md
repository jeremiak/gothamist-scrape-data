<p>Fast casual pizza chains are invading NYC. Two California-based companies are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170619203430/https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20170509/new-dorp/blaze-pizza-2590-hylan-blvd-hylan-plaza">opening outlets</a> in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170619203430/http://gothamist.com/2017/04/13/the_chipotle_of_pizza_is_opening_in.php">multiple boroughs</a> and now D.C.-originated <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170619203430/https://andpizza.com/nyc/">&amp;pizza;</a>&#x2014;yes, the ampersand is intentional&#x2014;debuts Tuesday in NoMad. </p>

<p>The brand, which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170619203430/http://dcist.com/2014/09/theres_probably_an_pizza_opening_ne.php">boasts 21 shops</a> in DC, Baltimore and Philadelphia, has several hallmarks that set it apart from other Chipotle-esque chains. First, their pies are oblong instead of a circle or a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170619203430/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/29/pizza_brooklyn_ops_review.php">square</a>, similar to the Pie By The Pound method, but here you get the whole pizza. Second, they offer unlimited toppings if you&apos;re going the DIY route, from a roster that includes the expected to the unusual, like spicy chickpeas, shrimp, lemon, and vegan beef.</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="061917pizza2.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170619203430im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_nellcasey/061917pizza2.jpg" width="640" height="427"> <br> <i> (Scott Suchman)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>Founder Michael Lastoria embraces the street art vibe of NYC with the shop&apos;s design, employing muralist Tony Rubin and graffiti artist Bisco Smith to create signature pieces that make up the decor for the restaurant. Lingering is encouraged, even though pies only take a few minutes to bake. </p>

<p>Lastoria has made it a point to pay workers above the minimum wage, which for fast food workers is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170619203430/https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/02/nyregion/new-yorks-path-to-15-minimum-wage-uneven-and-bumpy.html?mcubz=0">currently $12 in NYC</a>, and encourage the &quot;Tribe&quot; to work full time and work their way through the ranks. &amp;pizza;&apos;s NYC employees will be making around $13 per hour to work at &amp;pizza; with a plan to increase to $15 per hour in the next few years, in advance of the state&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170619203430/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/04/cuomo_officially_signs_15_minimum_w.php">forthcoming</a> $15 minimum for fast food workers (Lastoria&apos;s an active member of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170619203430/http://fightfor15.org/">Fight for $15</a> movement). </p>

<p>The pizzerias have been a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170619203430/http://dcist.com/2013/09/the_best_pizzas_in_dc.php">big hit in D.C.</a>, so much so that people are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170619203430/http://dcist.com/2017/02/more_than_50_couples_have_already_s.php">even getting hitched there</a>.</p>
