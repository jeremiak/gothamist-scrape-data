title: 5 Places To Get Boozy Bowls Of Punch In NYC
---

	
										<p><em>New Yorkers can be prickly about sharing things like subway seats and sidewalk space but everyone can get behind communing over a giant bowl of chilled punch. And were not talking the stuff ladeled out during the post-church hour; we&apos;re talking the delicious nectar filled with all kinds of lovely alcohol products. Gather up ye boozing comrades and drink up ye hearties, yo ho!</em></p>

<p><strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502122715/http://www.deadrabbitnyc.com/">DEAD RABBIT</a></strong>: With its exhaustive cocktail menu receiving top honors both locally and nationally, this Financial District gem won&apos;t disappoint regardless of your predilection. But if a frothy bowl of communal punch is your aim, the bar&apos;s Parlor area offers six different flavors to please everyone in your party, ladled out of beautiful bowls into charming tea cups. They&apos;ve got versions with rum, if that&apos;s too your taste, or concoctions made with whiskey and other spirits for something a little less sweet. </p>

<p>Bowls serve four ($55), six ($75) or eight ($90) but if you can&apos;t scrounge up a group, don&apos;t worry! They&apos;ve also got punch available by the glass ($11) or flagon ($60) in the Tap Room, with combos to please all kinds of palates. They&apos;ve also been known to give out a gratis cup of punch just for walking through the door.</p>

<p><em>The Dead Rabbit is located at 30 Water Street, 646-422-7906; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502122715/http://www.deadrabbitnyc.com/">deadrabbitnyc.com</a></em></p>

<p><strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502122715/http://thedrinkbrooklyn.com/">THE DRINK</a></strong>: Though they serve other cocktails and booze, this Williamsburg joint specializes in spiced punches, which they conveniently offer by the bowl ($43) or by the glass ($5) with one of their rotating specials. There are lots of rum and bourbon-based offerings, like The Coxswain with Barbancourt Rum, lime, sorrel flower, ginger and tiki bitters. For a less traditional concoction try Smoke on the Water, a bracing mixture of Pueblo Viejo tequila, Sandeman&#x2019;s Tawny Port, lapsang suchong smoked green tea, lime and xocolatl mole bitters. The old timey Maritime decor is fun but it&apos;s the backyard area that really sells this spot in the summertime. </p>

<p><strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502122715/http://www.cienfuegosny.com/Cienfuegos.html">CIENFUEGOS</a></strong>: This East Village Cuban restaurant scores big points for its serious dedication to rum, which can be found in all ages and styles in one of their 12 different punches. For heat seekers, try the Por Avion (Barbancourt Blanc, jalapeno, honey, lime and champagne); if you like it sweet, opt for the Anchor Punch with spiced rum, guava, ginger, lime and apricot liqueur. The restaurant offers a few different sizes for convenience: Con un Amigo bowls ($38) service two to three drinkers up to The Royal ($114) which serves nine to 10. No trip would be complete with an order of their Crispy Avocado ($8), a kind of avocado tempura; you&apos;ll need something to soak up all the booze. </p>

<p><strong>ZOMBIE HUT</strong>: While not punch in the strictest sense of the word, we&apos;d argue that the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502122715/http://gothamist.com/2014/02/15/still_got_it_zombie_hut.php">potent Scorpion Bowls</a> ($26) at this Carroll Gardens tiki hut satisfy the major components: fruity, voluminous and served in a fancy vessel. Plus <em>fire</em>! No fancy bitters or artisan tinctures here; just brandy, juice and enough high octane Bacardi 151 to put down even the most seasoned boozer. Sometimes you just need lowbrow, ya know? Pair that with the bars <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502122715/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/08/the_best_bars_with_outdoor_oases_in.php">killer outdoor space</a> and you&apos;ll be ready for a night you&apos;ll never remember!</p>

Order up a brunch entree like Egg&apos;s Benedict ($14), Brioche French Toast ($12) or Slow Roast Duck &amp; Beans ($14) and you&apos;ll be treated to glasses of sweet and tangy punch for the duration of your meal. </p>
