<p>We had warnings that poke would dominate in 2016 and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170105200841/http://gothamist.com/tags/poke">did it ever</a>. We were also told to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170105200841/http://gothamist.com/2015/11/04/uhoh_spaghettios.php">bid farewell to pasta</a>, as the gluten-free movement looked poised to replace traditional noodles with those made out of vegetables. Luckily, many restaurants ignored the predictions, and pasta enjoyed a bountiful year in NYC 2016. </p>

<p>Inklings of the pasta resurgence began in 2015, with spots like <strong>Faro</strong>, <strong>Upland</strong> and <strong>L&apos;Amico</strong> leading the charge. Flours <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170105200841/http://gothamist.com/2015/06/15/bushwick_faro_grains.php#photo-1">milled in house</a> became increasingly the norm for restaurants specializing in pastas, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170105200841/http://gothamist.com/2015/07/31/bruno_pizza_east_village.php#photo-1">pizza</a> and other flour-based dishes, a movement likely to continue as carbs come back into the spotlight (it was also a great year for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170105200841/http://gothamist.com/tags/pizza">pizza</a>).</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="010316apicii.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170105200841im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_nellcasey/010316apicii.jpg" width="640" height="426"> <br> <i> Casa Apicii (Quentin Bacon)</i></div>  <p></p>

<p>It helped that 2016 was also a banner year for new Italian restaurants, with places like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170105200841/http://casaapicii.com/"><strong>Casa Apicii</strong></a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170105200841/http://lasirena-nyc.com/"><strong>La Sirena</strong></a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170105200841/https://covinanyc.com/"><strong>Covina</strong></a> making the case for approachable, familiar Italian foods with gourmet flair. La Sirena&apos;s offering a bechamel and potato version of lasagna, which hopefully means more layered/baked pastas coming soon.</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="010316lilia.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170105200841im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_nellcasey/010316lilia.jpg" width="640" height="426"> <br> <i> Lilia (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170105200841/http://www.evansung.com/">Evan Sung</a>)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>Williamsburg alone saw the opening of three new restaurants with strong pasta programs, all of which also helped to usher in a new era of fine dining in the historical bohemian neighborhood. Missy Robbins&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170105200841/http://www.lilianewyork.com/"><strong>Lilia</strong></a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170105200841/http://www.baranobk.com/"><strong>Barano</strong></a> on the south side, and Andrew Carmellini&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170105200841/http://www.thewilliamvale.com/dining/leuca/"><strong>Leuca</strong></a> at the William Vale all employ the pasta-making machine to great success.</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="010316larina.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170105200841im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_nellcasey/010316larina.jpg" width="640" height="416"> <br> <i> LaRina Pastificio e Vino (Michael Tulipan)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>Elsewhere in Brooklyn, two other new eateries make the case for al fresco pasta, debuting <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170105200841/http://gothamist.com/2016/08/10/larina_pastificio_vino_fort_greene.php#photo-5">charming</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170105200841/http://gothamist.com/2016/09/09/faun_prospect_heights.php">new backyards</a> to reconsider for spring. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170105200841/http://larinabk.com/"><strong>LaRina Pastificio e Vino</strong></a> in Fort Greene specializes in surprising noodle options like cocoa tagliatelle and rye bucatini, for winter, while <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170105200841/http://faun.nyc/"><strong>Faun</strong></a> in Prospect Heights is doing cozy comfort food pastas like a pumpkin tortelli with sage and spaccatelli alla carbonara.</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="010316ladys.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170105200841im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_nellcasey/010316ladys.jpg" width="640" height="426"> <br> <i> Lady&apos;s (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170105200841/http://www.paulcrispin.com/">Paul Quitoriano</a>)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>Two late-breaking 2016 additions also showcase pasta, indicating the trend&apos;s likely to go strong into this new year. Chef Aaron Harsha&apos;s turning out handmade pastas at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170105200841/https://ladysnyc.com/"><strong>Lady&apos;s</strong></a> in Fort Greene, including ricotta-stuffed Cappelletti with a ragu made from aged meat and confit tomatoes and purses of Casoncele stuffed with short ribs with roasted sunchokes in a wine and bone marrow sauce. Dan Kluger&apos;s much anticipated <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170105200841/http://www.loringplacenyc.com/"><strong>Loring Place</strong></a> also saves room for a few pastas on the menu, like tubes of paccheri with romanesco, goat cheese and garlic crumbs.</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="101216pasta1.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170105200841im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_nellcasey/101216pasta1.jpg" width="640" height="427"> <br> <i> (Altamarea Group)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>Finally, pasta&apos;s most exciting trend takes out the traditional restaurant format. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170105200841/http://www.spaghetti-and-meatballs.com/pasta-omakase"><strong>Pasta Omakase</strong></a> enjoyed a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170105200841/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/31/pasta_omakase.php#photo-1">sell out run</a> of its pop-up pasta dinners, which featured an almost exclusively pasta menu. Chef Michael White&apos;s Altamarea Group debuted a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170105200841/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/12/pasta_delivery_michael_white.php"><strong>pasta delivery service</strong></a> geared towards making the difficult-to-transport dishes takeout box-friendly. And finally, Del Posto chef Mark Ladner left the relative safety of the traditional kitchen to venture into fast casual territory, debuting an &quot;upscale fast food with a quick-serve restaurant, <strong>Pasta Flyer</strong>, that he hopes to develop into a chain&quot; sometime later this year.</p>
