<p>Maple, the David Chang-backed delivery service that planned to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170616020807/http://gothamist.com/2014/11/05/momofuku_chef_plans_food_delivery_i.php">revolutionize home food delivery</a>, has ceased operations after two years in business. The service <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170616020807/https://twitter.com/maple/status/861637655934664710">sent word to customers</a> this afternoon that they were closing down citing &quot;many challenges to overcome.&quot; </p>

<p>Founders Caleb Merkl and Akshay Navle sought to reinvent the delivery wheel by cutting out restaurants all together and creating their own travel-friendly meals from a special kitchen. The service was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170616020807/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/20/david_chang_maple_lunch_deliver.php#photo-1">positively received</a>, but the founders said that over time &quot;the more evident it became that of all the paths we had contemplated, the most compelling next step in Maple&apos;s story involved a shift from our current approach.&quot; </p>

<p>Some employees will move on to London-based Deliveroo and Maple&apos;s proprietary technology &quot;will be used to help accelerate growth and efficiency across the platform.&quot;</p>

<p>While that&apos;s the official line from the founders, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170616020807/https://qz.com/972859/inside-maples-improbable-dream-of-delivering-a-better-office-lunch/">Quartz reported</a> that the company has been in trouble financially, including a possible debt of $10 million and a record of falling sales in the past year. </p>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Yeah, I could see why that was disappointing to customers. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170616020807/https://t.co/T30GzUAbSk">https://t.co/T30GzUAbSk</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170616020807/https://t.co/ljw8I6lPoD">pic.twitter.com/ljw8I6lPoD</a></p>&#x2014; Joe Weisenthal (@TheStalwart) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170616020807/https://twitter.com/TheStalwart/status/861639307752353793">May 8, 2017</a></blockquote>

<p>Financial problems appear to stem from well-intentioned roots. Food costs soared to 63% of gross revenue in 2015, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170616020807/https://www.recode.net/2016/12/23/14055132/maple-delivery-app-leaked-financial-documents">according to Recode</a>, thanks in large part to the company&apos;s commitment to only buying antibiotic-free meats and sustainable products. Plus, nearly half of the price of each meal went towards labor costs, specifically offering its employees living wages and health benefits, a rarity for delivery personnel and restaurant workers generally. </p>

<p>And then there&apos;s the Chang angle. Last year he launched Ando, an equivalent delivery-only service offering Momofuku-type dishes&#x2014;sometimes even including a free cookie. Ando has since <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170616020807/http://gothamist.com/2017/04/24/ando_downtown_david_chang.php">expanded operations</a> through more of Manhattan with the power of the Momofuku brand and Chang&apos;s popularity in food-obsessed communities behind it. Perhaps a few cheesesteak and fried chicken offerings could&apos;ve helped Maple, too. </p>
