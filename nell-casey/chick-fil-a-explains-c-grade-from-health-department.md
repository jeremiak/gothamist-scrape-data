<p>The gnarly Health Department inspection that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170429093249/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/03/chick-fil-a_closed_doh.php">shuttered NYC&apos;s fully operational</a> Chick-Fil-A continues to tarnish the fried chicken brand&apos;s reputation with the C grading it received as a result of that inspection. As it&apos;s required to do, the restaurant displays its dishonorable grade in the front window, accompanied by a note from the restaurant&apos;s franchisee, Oscar Fittipaldi, explaining the unfortunate circumstances. Come on Oscar, that&apos;s nothing a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170429093249/http://gothamist.com/2015/09/21/more_like_doh_jo.php">well-placed flag</a> can&apos;t fix.</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="30716chick3.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170429093249im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_nellcasey/30716chick3.jpeg" width="640" height="480"> <br> <i> (Christopher Robbins/Gothamist)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>&quot;The Grade C posted here is representative of an inspection from December 24th, 2015,&quot; the note explains. &quot;We voluntarily closed our doors after the inspection to address the citations and make restaurant improvements. We passed a subsequent inspection on January 13th: however, this grade will stand until the health department conducts its next graded inspection.&quot; </p>

<p>Information on the DOH&apos;s website confirms Fittipaldi&apos;s statements, showing that the restaurant only received two violation points during the January inspection; the DOH did not immediately return requests for comment on any other inspection-related findings. Fittipaldi did not immediately respond to our emailed questions either.</p>

<p>Despite the crummy grade, the restaurant was packed with sandwich seekers this afternoon. &quot;I heard that if you get a B, it means that people aren&apos;t properly trained or don&apos;t have their food handlers certificate, so for them to get a C, that&apos;s pretty shitty,&quot; customer Frank Spaulding-Bey said. Pressed for whether he&apos;d still grab his lunch there despite the bad grade: &quot;Oh yeah, I love Chik Fil A, and they&apos;re open for business, so.&quot;</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="030716chick2.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170429093249im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_nellcasey/030716chick2.jpeg" width="640" height="480"> <br> <i> (Christopher Robbins/Gothamist)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>When asked if the grade bothered her, Kyra, who declined to give her last name, said, &quot;Somewhat, but it&apos;s Chik Fil A!&quot; Loyalty to the restaurant apparently eclipses any negative perception the letter grade might offer. If the chain&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170429093249/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/02/chick-fil-as_charitable_foundation.php">abysmal stance on LGBTQ rights</a> won&apos;t turn people off, apparently some filth flies won&apos;t, either. </p>
