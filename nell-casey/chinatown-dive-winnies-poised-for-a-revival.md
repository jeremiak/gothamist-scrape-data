<p>It may still look as though Chinatown dive bar Winnie&apos;s still exists on Bayard Street, as the new tenant of the space&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170128173125/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/22/chef_gerardo_gonzalez_soars_at_the.php#photo-1">hip SoCal spot Lalo</a>&#x2014;retained the wind-worn exterior and signage when they took over. But make no mistake: Winnie&apos;s is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170128173125/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/28/rip_bars_restaurants_2015.php">gone, gone gone</a>...or is it?</p>

<p>An encouraging report <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170128173125/http://www.boweryboogie.com/2017/01/classic-chinatown-dive-winnies-revived-east-broadway-comeback/">by Bowery Boogie</a> indicates that Winnie&apos;s may be staging a triumphant return to the neighborhood, with possible plans to reopen at 58 East Broadway. Winnie&apos;s owner&apos;s application for a full liquor license will go before Community Board 3&apos;s SLA subcommittee later this month. Start warming up now!</p>

<p>As with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170128173125/http://gothamist.com/2015/03/17/subway_inn_is_back.php#photo-1">most reboots</a>, the original flavor is often lost in replication. Not much of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170128173125/http://imgur.com/a/B9yFl">fixtures</a> would be replanted on East Broadway, which Bowery Boogies notes is a commercial stretch of shops and markets, compared to the homier digs across from Columbus Park back on Bayard. </p>

<p>Winnie&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170128173125/http://gothamist.com/2015/02/24/chinatown_winnies_rip.php">closed two years ago</a> due to an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170128173125/http://vanishingnewyork.blogspot.com/2015/02/winnies-bar.html">&quot;inability to attain a lease from the landlord.&quot;</a></p>
