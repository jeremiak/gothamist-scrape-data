<p>Turducken, a thing that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161122083608/http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/paula-deen/turducken-recipe.html">really shouldn&apos;t exist</a>, has been given the okay to fly domestically this Thanksgiving. Hand lotion and children: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161122083608/http://gothamist.com/2010/01/14/8-year-old_boy_cant_get_name_off_ai.php">definitely not</a>. The world&apos;s most fowl holiday dinner entree: hope you&apos;re sharing with the crew!</p>

<p>The TSA&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161122083608/http://blog.tsa.gov/2016/11/lets-talk-turkey-tsa-thanksgiving-2016.html">Let&#x2019;s Talk Turkey: TSA Thanksgiving 2016 Travel Tips</a> were released yesterday, addressing topics like wrapped gifts (allowed but not recommended) and E-Cigs (okay in your carry on but you&apos;re still a douche), and offering &quot;Tips for Pilgrims&quot; (ugh), noting that &quot;large buckles can set off our metal detectors and your blunderbuss must be packed in checked bags according to our packing guidelines.&quot; At least the TSA is enjoying Thanksgiving this year!</p>

<p>But on the subject of the Turducken&#x2014;to which the agency has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161122083608/https://apps.tsa.dhs.gov/mytsa/cib_results.aspx?search=turducken">devoted an entire page</a>&#x2014;they offer the following statement:</p>

<blockquote>Turduckens can be packed in dry ice for carry-on and checked bags. If you pack your turducken in regular ice, remember that the ice must be completely frozen when going through the checkpoint in order to adhere to the 3-1-1 rules for liquids, gels and aerosols. And last but not least, odds are a turducken in a cooler (or shipping box) might exceed your airline&apos;s carry-on size allowance, so make sure you check with them before you go to the airport. 
<br><br>
Even if an item is generally permitted, it may be subject to additional screening or not allowed through the checkpoint if it triggers an alarm during the screening process, appears to have been tampered with, or poses other security concerns. The final decision rests with TSA on whether to allow any items on the plane.</blockquote>

<p>So, there you have it, a government agency taking some valuable time out of its mission of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161122083608/http://gothamist.com/2012/08/17/tsa_half-year_review.php">groping your junk</a> to add a bit of levity to world that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161122083608/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/17/guy_fieri_bar_crawl_midtown.php">supports a Guy Fieri bar crawl</a>. </p>
