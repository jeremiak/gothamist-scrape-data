<p>New Yorkers are no doubt <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150923182339/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/24/bloomberg_says_not_to_eat_at_restau.php">dutifully following the mayor&apos;s advice</a> and eschewing eateries without perfect A grades and one Harlem eatery won&apos;t sit idly by and see their patronage drop. Astor Row Cafe, located on Lenox Avenue at 130th Street, found a way to both disguise their B grading while simultaneously advertising their Sunday brunch. </p>

<p>It&apos;s not uncommon for restaurants to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150923182339/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/24/restaurants_are_still_hiding_their.php">camouflage their less-than-perfect grades</a> but this one-two &quot;hidden promotion&quot; takes the prize for most creative law bending. Guess we know where they stand on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150923182339/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/25/a_love_song_for_brunchy_long_workin.php">the greatest debate of our time</a>.</p>
