<p>In the not-so-distant future, every neighborhood in the city will have its own Shake Shack. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150206200224/http://gothamist.com/tags/shakeshack">rapidly expanding</a> burger chain announced a new DUMBO location on their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150206200224/https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153138348205182&amp;set=a.501838315181.394648.124653650181&amp;type=1&amp;permPage=1">Facebook page</a> this morning, revealing they&apos;ll take over the space at One Old Fulton Street sometime mid-2014. </p>

This new DUMBO spot is just down the block from Grimaldi&apos;s and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150206200224/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/14/patsy_grimaldi_returns_julianas_piz.php#photo-1">Juliana&apos;s</a>, so prepare for the sidewalks to be perpetually clogged with hungry tourists. </p>
