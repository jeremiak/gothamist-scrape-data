<p>When you find your true calling you won&apos;t let anything get in the way of achieving your dreams&#x2014;not even 400 summonses from the Department of Health. That&apos;s the true story of hot dog vendor Ehab Elsayed, who&apos;s profiled <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508162325/http://nypost.com/2014/02/07/you-dirty-dog-hunt-on-for-renegade-food-vendor/">in the Post</a> for his nefarious dealings with dirty water dogs. Elsayed allegedly racked up $330,000 in unpaid fines from the agency and had his licenses revoked four times between 2005 and 2012.</p>

<p>How was Elsayed (or is it Mohamed Elkholy? Mohamed Elsayed?) permitted to continue this reign of terror? It appears that he was adept at obfuscating his identity, creating false names and Social Security numbers to obtain new licenses. He was finally nabbed by the NYPD in 2012 and charged with felony forgery and tampering with public records in addition to other charges. Strangely, his felony charge was reduced, his record sealed and he was cut loose...only to pick up his wiener game once more, where he was subsequently arrested for vending without a license in January of last year.</p>

<p>Now it seems he&apos;s vanished like so many alcohol-fueled hot dogs. A warrant was issued after he failed to show for a court appearance last June, according to a court clerk, though the NYPD couldn&apos;t confirm. Perhaps its best to leave the corner carts to the tourists and get your tubular meat fix in a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508162325/http://gothamist.com/2014/02/07/greenwich_villages_dogmatic_redefin.php">more official capacity</a>.</p>
