<p>Forget Bone and Eggshell business cards; anyone who&apos;s anyone knows that to make a real impression you need something different, something remarkable, something made from dried animal flesh. That&apos;s why Philadelphian meatrepreneur Chris Thompson created <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140210112659/http://meatcards.com/">Meat Cards</a>, a service that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140210112659/http://meatcards.com/post/64056924003/etching-meatcards-for-noah">laser etches</a> all your details onto strips of beef jerky. </p>

<p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s tricky because jerky is not the best medium,&#x201D; Thompson <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140210112659/http://newsfeed.time.com/2013/12/03/nice-to-eat-you-introducing-beef-jerky-business-cards/?utm_content=bufferae307&amp;utm_source=buffer&amp;utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=Buffer">explained to Time</a>, because it&apos;s &quot;full of holes and it falls apart.&quot; That hasn&apos;t stopped savvy folks from procuring the cards; Thompson has sold them to small businesses, bands and other carnivorous professionals.</p>

<p>Snap into your own meaty cards by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140210112659/http://meatcards.com/contact">contacting Thompson</a>; currently, four cards set you back $25. So what happens if your new networking connection gets a bit peckish? &#x201C;The jerky is not intended to be eaten,&quot; explains Thompson. &quot;It&#x2019;s a novelty.&quot; Just take &apos;em to Dorsia first. </p>
