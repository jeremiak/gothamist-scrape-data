Fridays beginning today and running through September, they&apos;ll be doing <strong>$1 oysters and $10 sushi rolls</strong> beginning at 2 p.m. for the early crowd and ending at 11 p.m. for anyone chained to their desks through happy hour. They&apos;re also pouring $10 classes of Veuve Clicquot or Moet Imperial champagne and they&apos;ll offer one special cocktail each Friday for $10 also. </p>
