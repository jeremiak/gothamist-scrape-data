<p>Welsh-focused bar <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150721052012/http://longbownyc.com/wordpress/">Longbow Pub</a> got into hot water last year after posting a Craiglist job ad stating that &#x201C;Being British definitely works in your favor,&quot; if you&apos;re applying for a bartending position. This didn&apos;t fly with the city&apos;s Commission on Human Rights, who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150721052012/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/04/british_bar_in_trouble_with_city_af.php">fined owners Jennifer and Michael Colbert $2,500</a> for violating a discrimination law by &quot;giving a preference to employment applicants based on their national origin.&quot; Instead of ponying up the cash, the Colbert&apos;s are fighting the city, and have a &quot;conciliation meeting&quot; next month that will either see them victorious or owing as much as $7,500 instead of settling.</p>

<p>In a phone call with Jennifer Colbert this afternoon, the frustrated bar owner said she understands that the city has to pursue discrimination cases, but countered that the ad didn&apos;t say they would <em>only</em> hire Brits. Further, their business model relies on barkeeps who are from, or at least familiar with, British culture:</p>

<blockquote> We&apos;re a small place, chemistry is very important. If a British person walks in and the girl behind the bar is pretending to be British and doesn&apos;t actually know anything about Britain that&apos;s really not giving him a piece of home is it? British culture is distinct from American culture; they have their own lingo, their own television programs, their own pop music. It&apos;s two different things. <strong>Just because we speak English doesn&apos;t make us interchangeable.</strong></blockquote>

<p>The city, however, doesn&apos;t believe the Colbert&apos;s defense holds water. Clifford Mulqueen, Deputy Commissioner at the Commission on Human Rights, concedes that in some cases, &quot;there&apos;s room for a legitimate business reasons to look for one type of person or another,&quot; but says &quot;those instances are pretty rare.&quot; If the bar had simply looked for employees who were knowledgeable about British culture then the city wouldn&apos;t have taken umbrage with the job posting. &quot;But to say &apos;Preference for British nationals,&apos; that crosses the line.&quot;</p>

<p>And so it will come down to the conciliation meeting, where the Colberts admit they&apos;re at a &quot;significant disadvantage&quot; when it comes to fighting the city. But though they may lack the legal and financial resources, the Colberts are resolute that they have done nothing wrong. &quot;To me, you&apos;re applying this very specific letter of one little piece of law without looking at law in general and the bigger picture, the principle of the matter,&quot; Ms. Colbert explained. &quot;We&apos;re not looking to discriminate based on national origin.&quot; Best of British to them!</p>
