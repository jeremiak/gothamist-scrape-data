<p>This past spring, an arctic blast that chilled the city also threatened to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016123742/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/11/arctic_spring_apples_peaches.php">wipe out the apple population</a> at Hudson Valley farms, with farmers worried an entire season&apos;s worth of crops could be lost. As it turns out, farmers were justifiably concerned, with some farms reporting a significant loss to their apple crops and a devastating loss to stone fruit trees. </p>

<p>&quot;Almost as bad as we feared, worse than we hoped,&quot; Josh Morgenthau of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016123742/http://www.fishkillfarms.com/">Fishkill Farms</a> in Hopewell Junction, NY told us about the outcome to the trees. Morgenthau says he&apos;s looking at a loss between 50 and 60% to the farm&apos;s apple crop and peaches and nectarines were less than 5% of a normal crop. &quot;I&apos;m happy that we have fruit on the trees&#x2014;and we did pick a lot of apples and it wasn&apos;t a total wipeout&#x2014;but it was as much of our crop as we&apos;ve seen lost to this type of event in recent years.&quot;</p>

<p>Morgenthau says it wasn&apos;t just the arctic blast that did in the fruit trees. Extreme drought over the summer and a difficult year for insect pests further plagued the already damaged trees, resulting in a bigger loss. </p>

<p>Fred Wiklow of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016123742/http://www.wilkloworchards.com/">Wiklow Orchards</a>, about 45 minutes north of Fishkill, had a similarly bad outcome to his trees. &quot;Apples did better than we expected,&quot; he told us. &quot;I think we&apos;ve got maybe 60 - 70% of the crops, so more than we thought that we were going to get in the spring.&quot; There was a 100% loss on peaches, however, and only one variety of plums managed to make it through.</p>

<p>&quot;It&apos;s not only the cold weather during bloom, but also during bloom we had several days of cold, rainy weather and the bees won&apos;t work in that weather,&quot; Wiklow explained. &quot;The blossoms are only viable for a certain amount of time, so if they go too long without the bees having the opportunity to pollinate, you don&apos;t get any apples.&quot;</p>

<p>Both Wiklow and Morgenthau expect crops to return to normal for next season&#x2014;and by taking the opportunity to aggressively prune trees, there&apos;s even hope for a bumper crop&#x2014;but not before revenue takes a dip.</p>

<p>&quot;In terms of our total revenue, it&apos;s not devastating, although it&apos;s a big hit,&quot; Morgenthau said. &quot;But compared to a farm that only grows peaches or apples, let&apos;s say...the bottom line is that our fruit production income is going to be 50% of what it was last year and that&apos;s a big part of our business.&quot;</p>

<p>There&apos;s also concern about these types of events repeating themselves, especially in the new, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016123742/http://gothamist.com/2016/09/22/coffee_climate_change.php">more volatile weather conditions</a> brought on by climate change. &quot;We had a very bad crop year with spring frosts in 2012 and both in 2012 and this year, people were saying this is a one in 20 year, one in 30 year occurrence,&quot; Morgenthau recalled. &quot;So I&apos;m not convinced that it&apos;s now not a one in four year occurrence.&quot;</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there&apos;s not much of anything either farm can do to protect itself against future crop failure events. &quot;There&apos;s not a lot we can do on the fruit production side, but that is why we&apos;ve chosen to become more diverse in terms of what we&apos;re growing and how we&apos;re creating revenue,&quot; Morgenthau explained. </p>

<p>Pick &apos;em <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016123742/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/16/apple_picking_nyc.php">while you can</a>.</p>
