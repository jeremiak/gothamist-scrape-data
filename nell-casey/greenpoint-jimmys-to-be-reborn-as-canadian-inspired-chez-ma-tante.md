<p>Jimmy&apos;s, the Greenpoint offshoot of Williamsburg&apos;s popular Jimmy&apos;s Diner, closed at the end of last year, but the space already has a new tenant and a talented chef ready to take the helm. Chef Aidan O&apos;Neal has plans to turn the space into a new restaurant serving French and British food sometime in early spring. </p>

<p>O&apos;Neal, a native of Vancouver who spent five years in Montreal prior to moving to NYC, paid <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170119052058/https://www.yelp.com/biz/chez-ma-tante-montreal-nord">homage to a restaurant he loved in Montreal</a>, naming this new restaurant Chez Ma Tante (&quot;at my aunt&apos;s&quot;). </p>

<p>O&apos;Neal worked as head chef with fellow Canadians at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170119052058/http://gothamist.com/2015/01/28/m_wells_spaghetti_sandwich.php">M. Wells restaurants</a>, and late last year, he left a job at celebrated Cafe Altro Paradiso, where he&apos;d been chef de cuisine since the restaurant <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170119052058/http://gothamist.com/2016/12/22/best_new_restaurants_2016.php">opened in early 2016</a>. This is the first restaurant where he&apos;ll be the master of his domain and he&apos;s partnering with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170119052058/http://gothamist.com/2016/07/29/l_train_fear_loathing_panic.php">prolific restaurateur</a> Josh Cohen to transform the former Jimmy&apos;s into his vision.</p>

<p>&quot;It&apos;s more of underselling and over-delivering,&quot; he says to describe what he&apos;s aiming for. &quot;It&apos;s taking a reference point from humble French and English food and trying to elevate it a little bit.&quot; </p>

<p>A bit of raw bar, some smaller plates and salads and between five or six entrees a night is the plan right now. Classic dishes like terrines and sausages are also part of O&apos;Neal&apos;s vision. </p>

<p>&quot;I want the menu to be very accessible and easy to read,&quot; O&apos;Neal says. &quot;I&apos;d like it to be a place where people go to have dinner with their friends as opposed to having dinner with the restaurant. We won&apos;t be too intrusive.&quot;</p>

<p>French influences joining O&apos;Neal&apos;s Canadian heritage, essentially. &quot;There&apos;ll be maple syrup everywhere,&quot; he promises. </p>
