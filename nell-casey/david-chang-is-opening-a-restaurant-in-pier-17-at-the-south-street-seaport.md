<p>A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171015235104/http://nypost.com/2016/03/23/david-chang-will-be-serving-up-the-south-street-seaport/">New York Post &quot;exclusive&quot;</a> brings word that super chef David Chang has signed a lease to be a restaurant tenant in the newly redesigned <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171015235104/http://gothamist.com/tags/pier17">Pier 17</a> at the South Street Seaport.
