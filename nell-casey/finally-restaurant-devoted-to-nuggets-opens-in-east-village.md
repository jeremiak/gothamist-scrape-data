</div></div>					<p>Everyone&apos;s favorite <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150722235220/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/03/did_you_know_the_chicken_nugget_was.php">Ivy League creation</a> has a new single-focus restaurant to call home. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150722235220/http://www.thenuggetspot.com/">The Nugget Spot</a> opened in October along 14th street in the East Village, offering a variety of deep-fried meats and cheeses in bite-sized form. It&apos;s like a combination of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150722235220/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/22/stickys_finger_joint_opening.php#photo-1">Sticky Fingers</a>, the chicken finger joint that debuted last year, and Pomme Frites, which take classic fast food items, class &apos;em up and skew the flavors and ingredients to an adult palate. </p>

<p>Unlike their terrifyingly manufactured forbears, the nuggets here are actually whole pieces of hormone-free meat, cut into hunks for easy dipping. Customers choose their protein (chicken, pork, catfish or mozzarella; $7 for eight), then select one of the coatings, which include a traditional panko breading, coconut, pretzel and even pulverized cheese crackers. The nuggets are deep fried then served with the customer&apos;s choice of dipping sauce. Nostalgia seekers might opt for honey mustard or bbq, but they&apos;re also mixing up spicy tomato, nacho-queso and roasted pepper ranch dipping sauces for the more adventurous palate.</p>

<p>Troubled decision-makers can try a signature creation, like the &quot;Secret Coded&quot; (cheese cracker crust with hot <small></small>sauce), Katsu (Panko crusting with wasabi mayonnaise) or the Tso-Tswag (General Tso style crust with Mumbo Sauce). On the side they&apos;ve got some veggies like Brussels spouts and slaw, but for the full fast food formula you&apos;ve gotta go with french fries or perhaps a biscuit. According to their Instagram, nugget sandwiches have started popping up on the menu, just in time to compete with the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150722235220/http://gothamist.com/tags/empirebiscuit">newly opened biscuit haven</a> just a few blocks away.</p>

<p><em>230 East 14th Street between 2nd and 3rd Avenues, (646) 422-7346; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150722235220/http://www.thenuggetspot.com/">thenuggetspot.com</a>.
