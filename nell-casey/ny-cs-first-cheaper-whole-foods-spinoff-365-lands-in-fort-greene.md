<p>Whole Foods&apos; new line of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170122153348/http://gothamist.com/2015/05/07/whole_foods_to_launch_cheaper_store.php">millennial-baiting</a> stores will open its first NYC location in Fort Greene next year, as an anchor tenant inside a new development by the prolific Two Trees Management company. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170122153348/https://www.365bywholefoods.com/about">365 by Whole Foods</a> is set to debut inside 300 Ashland, a 35-story residential building that will also be home to &quot;four BAM Cinema screens, a branch of the Brooklyn Public Library, and cultural space for 651 ARTS and the Museum of Contemporary African Diasporan Arts (MoCADA).&quot; Some low-priced kale should fit in quite nicely.</p>

<p>Named for the in-house food brand currently sold at Whole Foods, the 365 stores offer lower priced food items than its mothership. That includes ready-to-eat items, too, and the 365 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170122153348/http://laist.com/2016/05/24/whole_foods_365.php#photo-9">in Los Angeles</a> features goodies from vegan entrepreneur Chloe Coscarelli at a mini restaurant within the store. </p>

<p>The new stores also employ iPads like this one, which is used for making instant recommendations on the alcohol selection. Since you can&apos;t sell spirits or wine inside a grocery store in NYC, they&apos;ll have to imagine other ways to integrate technology that lets shoppers look up from their phones long enough to interact with another mini computer.</p>

<p>The new store won&apos;t open until early 2018, so satisfy your curiosity with a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170122153348/http://laist.com/2016/05/24/whole_foods_365.php#photo-1">tour of the California version</a>.</p>
