<p>Only if you can you tell your pork and chives dumplings from your lamb and green squash dumplings are you competent enough to compete in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170615194323/https://www.facebook.com/events/295327707558470/">Dumpling Galaxy Tasting Contest</a>, the newest dumpling-centric event from the mind behind the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170615194323/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/01/momo_crawl_queens_2016.php#photo-1">Momo Crawl</a>. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170615194323/https://twitter.com/jefforlick">Jeff Orlick</a>, along with food tour guide <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170615194323/https://www.infoodwetrust.nyc/">Angelis Nannos</a>, host this dumpling identifying challenge at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170615194323/http://www.dumplinggalaxy.com/">Dumpling Galaxy</a>, home to Helen You&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170615194323/http://www.dumplinggalaxy.com/menu.html#dumplings">myriad dumpling creations</a>. If you can guess &apos;em, you can win &apos;em.</p>

<p>Competitors&#x2014;you can enter as an individual or as a team of up to six&#x2014;are tasked with guessing the ingredients in each of You&apos;s dumplings. Participants are given a master list of potential ingredients and must identify the three that are in each dumplings. It&apos;s like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170615194323/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/30/best_trivia_nights_nyc.php">pub quiz</a> but with delicious dumplings instead of nerdy pop culture questions. You&apos;s dumplings come in many, many different varieties, with fillings including shrimp, corn, celery, fish, mushrooms, asparagus, lotus root, Chinese yam, dried octopus, crab, lamb, beef... In other words: good luck!</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="050917dumplings1.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170615194323im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_nellcasey/050917dumplings1.jpg" width="640" height="480"> <br> <i> Dozens of dumplings (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170615194323/https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/dumpling-galaxy-flushing?start=30&amp;tab=food">Yelp</a>)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>There will be three rounds of play with five different types of dumplings for identification in each round. Each team gets two bite-sized dumplings per type of dumplings for a total of 30 dumplings over the course of play. Orlick says each table also gets a &quot;palate cleansing dish&quot; in-between rounds and a beer, tea or other beverage to start. </p>

<p>The team to correctly identify the most dumplings wins...more dumplings! The grand prize is a &quot;Night of 1,000 Dumplings&quot; at Dumpling Galaxy, a chance for up to four people to eat as many dumplings (up to 1,000) as they can in a two hour period. Any of You&apos;s dumplings are game&#x2014;including pan fried dumplings, steamed shumai, and pork soup dumplings. First place gets a copy of You&apos;s and Max Falkowitz&apos;s <em>The Dumpling Galaxy Cookbook</em> and 2nd place gets &quot;an envelope full of cash&quot; that Orlick says is a &quot;surprise amount&quot; (though the ticketing link says it&apos;s $5).  </p>

<p>The competition goes down on Sunday, May 21st from 3 p.m. to 5 p.m. and if you want to participate you&apos;ll need to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170615194323/http://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/2939353">register</a> ($35) in advance. </p>
