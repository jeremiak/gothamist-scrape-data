<p>David Chang&apos;s delivery-only &quot;restaurant&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170714175958/https://order.andofood.com/">Ando</a> initiated its next major expansion Monday, debuting delivery of Chang&apos;s cheesesteaks and fried chicken to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170714175958/https://twitter.com/andofood/status/856488663487836160">downtown audiences</a>.</p>

<p>Ando <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170714175958/http://gothamist.com/2016/05/16/momofuku_ando_david_chang.php">began in Midtown East</a> last spring, eventually expanding to service parts of the Upper East Side and Midtown West. The new downtown Ando marks the first major leap in Manhattan&#x2014;and it looks like NYU students are going to be pretty pleased.</p>

<p>The Hozon Cheesesteak and the brand new Cutlet Supreme&#x2014;Chang&apos;s take on a chicken parm hero&#x2014;are the &quot;new versions of old favorites&quot; found in the sandwich section. Salads and bowls are less likely to lead to afternoon food coma, but the same can&apos;t be said of the fried chicken and cheesesteak egg rolls. Luckily, Ando delivers Stumptown Cold Brew (and pamplemousse LaCroix).</p>

<p>Interested parties can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170714175958/https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ando-momofukus-delivery-only/id1104421020?mt=8">download the app</a> to get on the downtown lunch and dinner train from 11 a.m. to 10 p.m.</p>
