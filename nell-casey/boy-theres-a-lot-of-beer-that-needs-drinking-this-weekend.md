Sixpoint Brewery has tapped over 20 collaborators for the event, including breweries, venues and food makers (like the Mexican Chocolate Stout with Ample Hills Creamery). Each has come up with a one-time-only beer created specifically for the event; once the keg&apos;s kicked, it&apos;s all over. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161017172555/https://www.eventbrite.com/e/beer-for-beasts-tickets-26972875597?aff=facebook">Tickets $70</a>.</p>
