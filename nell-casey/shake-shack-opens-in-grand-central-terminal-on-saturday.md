<p>It may have taken two years but Shake Shack&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407150031/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/08/shake_shack_finally_opening_in_gran.php">long-planned Grand Central Terminal</a> outpost finally starts slinging Shackburgers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407150031/http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20131001/RETAIL_APPAREL/131009991">this Saturday</a>. The new burger mecca takes over the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407150031/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/21/grand_central_terminal_shake_shack.php">former Zocalo space</a> in the lower level dining concourse, joining eateries like Magnolia Bakery, Junior&apos;s Restaurant and Zaro&apos;s Bakery that cater to the commuting set.</p>

<p>As they&apos;ve done with previous openings, the new iteration offers a signature concrete flavor called the GCT Crunch-stellation, which mixes malt, Valrhona chocolate crunchies and chocolate toffee piece with vanilla frozen custard. They&apos;ll also offer bottles of ShackMeister Ale to go for folks running to catch trains, which would be convenient if not for the burger spot&apos;s notorious lines. And the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407150031/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/30/metro-north_new_haven_service_is_no.php">notorious trains</a>. </p>
