</div></div>					<p>What began as a weekend setup at the Dekalb Market has turned into a full-fledged restaurant for sandwich company <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151031120717/http://mayhemandstout.yolasite.com/about.php">Mayhem &amp; Stout</a>. On August 16th, the sandwich makers open their first brick-and-mortar shop in Murray Hill, offering a constantly changing menu of braised meat sandwiches and house-made condiments. </p>

<p>High School friends Jay Brown and Steve Applegate have been braising up a storm since 2011, experimenting with flavors, cuts and whatever the season brings. They&apos;ve sold sandwiches all over the city at food fests like Madison Square Eats and at holiday markets and perfected their recipes doing lots of catering. Using local ingredients as much as they can, the duo have created over 50 homemade sauces and toppings for their sandwiches, like Blueberry Sriracha, Tahini Aioli and Caramelized Butternut Squash Mustard.</p>

<p>At the Mayem &amp; Stout storefront, expect a revolving menu of braised meats from short rib to lamb shoulder with accompanying toppings. One day could be Short Rib, Horseradish Creme and Onion Confit; the next, Braised Pulled Chicken, Buffalo Vin, Bleu Cheese Aioli and Pickled Celery. Though they specialize in meat, the owners claim it&apos;s not a &quot;dictatorship,&quot; so look over for some vegetarian options as well. They&apos;ll serve each sandwich creation on bread from Brooklyn&apos;s Caputo Bakery. </p>
