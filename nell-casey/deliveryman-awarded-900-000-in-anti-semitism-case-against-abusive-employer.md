<p>A deliveryman for a midtown restaurant won big in a lawsuit against his anti-Semitic former supervisors. Adam Wiercinski, who worked for lunch spot Mangia 57, was awarded $900,000 by a jury as compensation for years of abuse at the hand of his bosses. According to testimony, three of the restaurant&apos;s supervisors repeatedly directed anti-Semitic comments at Wiercinski, calling him a &quot;dirty Jew&quot; and a &quot;Jewish pederast.&quot; They also denied him tip money by throwing pennies at him, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141230200117/http://nypost.com/2013/10/28/anti-jewish-jokes-about-nazi-death-gas-nets-man-900k/">according to the Post</a>.</p>

<p>Things didn&apos;t stop with the derogatory comments. Night-shift manager Artur Zbozien frequently &quot;passed wind, loudly&quot; in front of Wiercinski, joking that his noxious farts were Zyklon B, the gas used by Nazis in concentration camps during the second World War. &quot;Everybody laughed, and then he said, &apos;See, this is your Zyklon B, you stupid Jew,&apos;&quot; revealed Wiercinski. &quot;My father had six siblings. Only two of them survived in what is now the Ukraine.&quot; Apparently, Wiercinski was compelled to explain the usage and meaning of the toxic gas to the jury &quot;because they were very young; they do not know.&quot; </p>

<p>Members of the jury heard testimony last week, which included statements from co-workers who were witness to the abuse. After four hours of deliberation, they decided in favor of Wiercinski, awarding him the substantial sum. &quot;He&apos;s in shock,&quot; said Wiercinski&apos;s lawyer Matthew Blit. &quot;He was so happy. It&apos;s a moral victory for him.&quot; The restaurant denies any wrongdoing and will likely seek to have the verdict overturned.</p>
