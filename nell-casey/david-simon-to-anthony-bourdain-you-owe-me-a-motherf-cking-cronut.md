                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="2013_06_cronutbourdain.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928035059im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_nellcasey/2013_06_cronutbourdain.jpg" width="640" height="485"> <br> <i> <span class="photo_caption">An artist&apos;s rendering of Bourdain hoarding a Cronut</span></i></div> <p></p>

<p>In this <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928035059/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/03/the_longest_ever_cronut_line_in_the.php">Cronut-obsessed town</a>, promising the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928035059/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/26/i_waited_on_line_for_cronuts_and_ha.php">mind-altering pastry</a> and failing to deliver is akin to the most egregious etiquette violations, like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928035059/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/15/etiquette_week_subway.php#photo-6">hogging the subway pole</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928035059/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/28/memorable_photo_sleepy_man_hangs_br.php">exposing your pole on the subway</a>. It seems <em>The Wire</em> creator David Simon was the victim of this cruel fate just yesterday and has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928035059/http://davidsimon.com/betrayal-thy-name-is-bourdain/">taken to his blog</a> to call out the perpetrators of this most heinous betrayal. </p>

<p>It goes like this: Bourdain asked Simon and the <em>Times</em> David Carr to appear on a segment of <em>Piers Morgan Live</em> in which Bourdain was subbing for Mr. Morgan. Bourdain promised &quot;cronuts!&quot; as part of the deal, a promise that became the deciding factor for both men to appear on the show. What happened next will live on in the sugar-induced fever dreams of Cronut-addicts for years to come:</p>

<blockquote>Well, let it be known that Dave Carr and I were escorted off-stage a couple hours ago, after the taping, only to be handed &#xA0;a wet-wipe each for the makeup.<br><br>
&#x201C;Where are the cronuts?&#x201D; asked the redoubtable Mr. Carr.<br><br>
&#x201C;<strong>The problem is we think we only have enough for the audience</strong>,&#x201D; he was told.<br><br>
Me? &#xA0;I&#x2019;m from Baltimore. &#xA0;I&#x2019;m used to coming to New York and having this happen. &#xA0;So I manage little more than a pout at this point. Mr. Carr, however, relentless Timesman that he is, puts up the good fight: &#xA0;&#x201D;My agent negotiated a cronut. &#xA0;<strong>I say this with all sincerity: &#xA0;I am here for the cronut.</strong>&#x201D;<br><br>
&#x201C;Me, too,&#x201D; I echo pathetically.<br><br></blockquote>

<p>Handlers were dispatched, returning with &quot;perhaps a quarter of a cronut on a plate, cut in half.&quot; Simon and Carr shared the pastry pittance, leaving the plate &quot;bare-ass naked&quot; in mere seconds.</p>

<p> A &quot;Semi-Apologetic Producer&quot; commented on Simon&apos;s blog after he released his rant, claiming that if the writer had &quot;stayed an extra 5 minutes and had not left so hurriedly in your bitter huff&quot; he could have ingested Bourdain&apos;s leftovers, as it turns out he &quot;did not finish eating his own cronut.&quot; Bourdain, for his part, blames the show for the mishap:</p>

<p>Simon should try to get on Jerry Seinfeld&apos;s new series. Apparently he can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928035059/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/22/video_jerry_seinfeld_is_the_devil_w.php">deliver the goods</a>.</p>
