<p>The collective sigh of rapture you just heard echoing through Dumbo? A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150527004716/http://www.pinkberry.com/">Pinkberry</a> location is coming to the nabe this fall. The popular fro-yo purveyor will open on Front Street, which houses other lunchtime mainstays Foragers and Peas &amp; Pickles. It will be operated by Dumbo real estate giant <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150527004716/http://twotreesny.com/">Two Trees Management Company</a>, which owns 13 buildings in the neighborhood. While there are already over a dozen locations in Manhattan, this will only be the chain&apos;s second foray into the outer boroughs after the Park Slope location opened this past summer.</p>

<p>The store opens sometime in October, dishing out a rotating selection of frozen yogurts (pomegranate, mango and their original flavor, among others), toppings, smoothies and other sweet-centric treats. Given the neighborhood&apos;s limited storefront food offerings&#x2014;food trucks make a killing here&#x2014;this will certainly be a popular dining option for the many offices that call Dumbo home. Now if only someone would open a Chipotle...</p>
