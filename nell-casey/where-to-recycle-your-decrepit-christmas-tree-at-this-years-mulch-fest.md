<p>When the city sidewalks are transformed into fragrant fir graveyards it can mean but one thing: the holidays are really, truly over and it&apos;s time to chuck out that withered <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422151346/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/20/video_fdny_reminds_you_that_christm.php">fire trap</a> that not even the cat will <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422151346/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/02/christmas_trees_and_your_pet.php">attempt to climb</a> anymore. This year, as in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422151346/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/11/time_to_get_rid_of_the_chirstmas_tr.php">previous years</a>, the city offers a few easy ways to discard your yuletide remnant, including their annual tree grinding festival <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422151346/http://www.nycgovparks.org/highlights/festivals/mulchfest">MulchFest</a>, where your precious pine will be converted into much-needed wooden blankets for the city&apos;s many street and park trees. </p>

<p>Because <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422151346/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/08/there_was_a_christmas_tree_fire_in.php#photo-1">Viking funerals</a> are not permitted, you&apos;ll have to discard your tree a more humane way. Here, let <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422151346/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/03/birdie_staycation.php#photo-1">our friend Birdie</a> show you how it&apos;s done:</p>

<p>Bring your naked tree to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422151346/http://www.nycgovparks.org/highlights/festivals/mulchfest">one of the chipping sites</a> if you want to preserve the remains for your Christmas Urn&#x2014;or to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422151346/http://www.milliontreesnyc.org/html/programs/stewardship_corps.shtml">winterize a street tree</a>&#x2014;on Saturday, January 11th or Sunday, January 12th from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. If you&apos;re lucky, you&apos;ll have a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422151346/http://www.nyc.gov/html/greenyc/html/home/home.shtml">Birdie sighting</a>! Otherwise, drop off your fir friend <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422151346/http://www.nycgovparks.org/highlights/festivals/mulchfest">at designated sites</a> throughout the boroughs now through Sunday and bid adieu to your tree skeleton. </p>
