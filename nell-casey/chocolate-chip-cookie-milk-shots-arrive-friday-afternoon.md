<p>Like many good things that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420053350/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/11/shiner_beer_finally_coming_to_new_y.php">began in Texas</a>, the Chocolate Chip Cookie Milk shots are set to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420053350/http://gothamist.com/2014/03/07/cronut_cookie_shot.php">make their debut in New York City</a>. Set your alarms for Friday at 3 p.m. when Cronut creator Dominique Ansel unleashes his latest viral confection upon us all. </p>

<p>A limited number will be made available for the big premiere, and good little pastry-loving boys and girls are encouraged to arrive early to secure a spot in the line. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420053350/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/03/cronut_line_blizzard.php">You know the drill</a>. The cookie shots go for $3, which can be procured two-per-customer or in a box of eight for $25. For individual orders, organic, Tahitian vanilla-infused Swede Farm milk gets added to order; for the take-home boxes, small glass bottles of the special cow juice can be had for $3. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420053350/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/18/you_can_now_pre-order_your_cronut_o.php">Unlike the Cronut</a>, the shots can&apos;t be preordered at this time. </p>

<p>Fun fact: Dominique Ansel hadn&apos;t tried an Oreo until a few weeks ago and the experience inspired his newest creation. The humble Oreo, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420053350/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/30/food_art_oreo_cameos_condiment_wall.php#photo-1">inspiring art</a> wherever it goes. </p>
