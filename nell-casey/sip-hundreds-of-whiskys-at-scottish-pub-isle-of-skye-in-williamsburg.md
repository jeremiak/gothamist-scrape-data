</div></div>					<p>Though Irish pubs dominate the bar landscape in this city, especially in the wastelands of Midtown Manhattan, bars dedicated to the drinking culture of Scotland are not as common. Here to rectify that is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151020001830/http://www.isleofskyepub.com/index.html">Isle of Skye</a>, a new Scottish pub that opened in Williamsburg this month serving up hundreds of whiskys in a subterranean space on Driggs Avenue. The space could not look less like that yogurt shop that used to inhabit it; the transformation into a Scottish castle is a complete one, with stone walls, large wooden tables, a faux fireplace, and huge leather sofas for curling up with a strong drink. </p>

<p>The menu of whiskys is extensive, with selections from five different regions of Scottland&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151020001830/http://www.isleofskyepub.com/Highlands-.html">Highlands</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151020001830/http://www.isleofskyepub.com/Lowlands.html">Lowlands</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151020001830/http://www.isleofskyepub.com/Islay.html">Islay</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151020001830/http://www.isleofskyepub.com/Speyside.html">Speyside</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151020001830/http://www.isleofskyepub.com/Islands.html">Island</a>&#x2014;plus a variety of blends, Irish whiskys, American bourbons and a few bottles from Japan and other lesser known distilling countries. If you&apos;re not hip to the peat, bartenders will happily recommend something&#x2014;be sure to ask Scott behind the bar for his picks. And though some might call it blasphemous, the pub uses a few in their vast collection of whiskys to mix up <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151020001830/http://www.isleofskyepub.com/CocktailsMenu.html">cocktails</a> ($10) like the Islay Old Fashioned with Bowmore Legend and the tart Laphraoig Project with Laphroaig 10 Year, Chartreuse, Luxardo Marashino, lemon juice and peach bitters. </p>

<p>If beer is more your speed, opt for one of the Scottish brews on draught like an Innis &amp; Gunn (12 oz, $7) or one of the Belhaven beers ($7), which are served in large 20 ounce tumblers. They also have a decent selection of craft beers in bottles, from the more common Duvel and Chimay varieties to Froach Heather Ale ($8) and a few ciders to boot. </p>
