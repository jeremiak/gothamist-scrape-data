Class, please give a warm welcome to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507223558/http://www.treathouse.com/">Treat House</a>, a &quot;gourmet crisped rice emporium&quot; that opened today on Amsterdam Avenue on the Upper West Side. </p>

<p>Inspired by a children&apos;s bake sale (not a joke), Treat House offers up squares of gooey crisped rice and marshmallow in a variety of flavors that go far beyond the margarine and Rice Krispies mess your teenaged babysitter made after school. Bubble Gum, Birthday Cake and S&apos;Mores appeal to the elementary schooler inside us, while Caramel Fleur de Sel, Dark Chocolate Chili and Yuzu Lemon appeal to more grown up sensibilities. Besides the Treats, the shop makes TreatPops, Ice Cream Bars and homemade flavored marshmallows. </p>

<p>Food allergy sufferers and folks on special diets should be happy to know that the marshmallows contain fish gelatin&#x2014;no hooves here!&#x2014;and all the rice treats are Kosher, gluten-free, dairy-free and, in many cases, nut- free. They&apos;ll serve Stumptown Coffee and some health food-centered Breakfast Bars to anyone not ready for an insane blood sugar spike. In addition to serving our desire for nostalgia, Treat House also plans to donate ten cents from every treat sold to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507223558/http://www.foodbanknyc.org/">Food Bank For New York City</a>. Now please excuse us while we make our Ants On A Log food truck dreams come true. </p>

<p><em>452 Amsterdam Avenue (between 81st and 82nd street) // Open Monday- Friday from 7 a.m. - 9 p.m. and weekends 8 a.m. - 10 p.m.</em></p>
