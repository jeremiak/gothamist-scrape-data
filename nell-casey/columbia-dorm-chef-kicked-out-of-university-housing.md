<p>Jonah Reider, the Columbia senior who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170321220435/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/07/columbia_dorm_dinner.php">started a restaurant in his dorm room</a>, has been asked to leave university housing. Reider has been living in a university-owned apartment for professors, but received a letter from his landlord saying he&apos;d have to leave by the end of the month, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170321220435/http://www.wsj.com/articles/columbia-student-cant-keep-running-restaurant-in-university-housing-1462486779">reports the Wall Street Journal</a>. Well, at least he gets to stay until after graduation.</p>

<p>The letter from the landlord said that &quot;ongoing issues that have been relayed to me by the university have made this necessary.&quot; Reider says he&apos;s received both praise and critique from university officials about his restaurant, which has become so popular there&apos;s a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170321220435/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/30/there_is_a_900-person_waiting_list.php">waiting list 1,000 people long</a> to attend. &quot;I had university administrators on my wait list that were totally trying to come through,&quot; he revealed. &quot;They&apos;d also be, like, please find a new place.&quot; The Health Department was also on his case for, ya know, operating a restaurant out of a dorm kitchen.</p>

<p>Reider had planned to stay in the apartment through August, when his sublease ended, but now will obviously have to find another place to live and work. &quot;It would be amazing to find an investor so that I could open up a music venue and snack bar, to have more people,&quot; Reider told us last fall. </p>

<p>His ambitions have yet to be tempered, as the WSJ notes: &quot;He hopes to move into a large New York City apartment that is &apos;underutilized,&apos; like a pied-a-terre, and work as a chef instead of paying full rent. He hasn&#x2019;t found such a patron yet.&quot;</p>

<p>Keep <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170321220435/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/08/ask_a_native_new_yorker_5.php">dreaming that dream</a>, Jonah. </p>
