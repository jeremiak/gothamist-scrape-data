<p>New York City&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160708072039/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/23/nyc_chain_stores.php">most ubiquitous chain</a> has found itself in hot water for allegedly overcharging its customers around 70% of the time. Two lawsuits filed in New York and New Jersey claim that stores in both states erroneously charged customers state sales tax on items that weren&apos;t subject to those types of taxes. Two NJ customers claim to have been charged the state&apos;s 7% sales tax on bottled water and ground coffee, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160708072039/http://nypost.com/2016/02/08/dunkin-donuts-stores-accused-of-overcharging-customers/">reports the Post</a>, while customers in New York were charged sales tax for ground coffee (bottled water is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160708072039/https://www.tax.ny.gov/pubs_and_bulls/tg_bulletins/st/listings_of_taxable_and_exempt_food.htm">subject to tax</a> in New York State). </p>

<p>Small percentages can add up to huge numbers, though, and according to the suits, Dunkin Donuts made $4 million off New Jersey customers and a whopping <em>$10 million</em> off of customers in New York. A spokesperson for the Dunkin Donuts corporate office said it&apos;s looking into the allegations; next, we demand an explanation for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160708072039/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/12/the_sad_reality_behind_dunkin_donut.php">this other assault on our intelligence</a>. </p>
