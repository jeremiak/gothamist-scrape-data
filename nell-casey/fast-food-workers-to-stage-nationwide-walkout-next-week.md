<p>Fast food workers in eight cities around the country are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508124041/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/fast-food-workers-call-nationawide-strike-labor-day-article-1.1431116">preparing a massive walkout</a> next week to demand better pay and the right to unionize. Just before Labor Day on August 29th, workers from McDonald&apos;s, Burger King, Wendy&apos;s, and KFC will leave their posts and take to the streets to call attention to their situation. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508124041/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/30/i_make_a_smile_why_cant_i_get_to_sm.php">Similar protests</a> have been unfolding throughout this year as workers fight to receive a living wage.</p>

<p>Most workers at fast food restaurants make around $7.25 per hour; workers are aiming for an increased wage of $15 per hour, a figure actually capable of sort of sustaining a meager existence. &#x201C;Fifteen an hour I think is more than fair. We should ask for more, but we&#x2019;re being nice,&quot; KFC shift supervisor Shenita Simon explained to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508124041/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/fast-food-workers-call-nationwide-strike-labor-day-article-1.1431116#ixzz2cWK9AY86">Daily News</a>. &quot;They are building the company on our backs.&#x201D;</p>

<p>There&apos;s no doubt it&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508124041/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/16/mcdonalds_helpfully_illustrates_tha.php">impossible to live</a> on a fast food salary&#x2014;and that&apos;s even if your boss isn&apos;t <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508124041/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/16/new_york_city_fast_food_workers_exp.php">robbing you</a>. Workers hope these demonstrations will cause widespread change in a system that doesn&apos;t seem to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508124041/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/19/washington_heights_mcdonalds_employ.php">care about its workers</a>. </p>
