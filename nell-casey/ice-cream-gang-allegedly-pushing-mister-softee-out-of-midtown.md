<p>The maddening jingle of the Mister Softee fleet is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161017162203/http://gothamist.com/2014/07/06/mr_softee_schadenfreude.php">everywhere</a> during the warmer months&#x2014;except Midtown, apparently. It seems a gang-like turf war has erupted in the cluttered swath of Manhattan, where competing ice cream empire New York Ice Cream is using intimidation tactics to keep would-be soft serve hawkers out of its territory. &quot;You will never see a Mister Softee truck in Midtown,&quot; one vendor <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161017162203/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/31/nyregion/a-king-of-ice-cream-a-renegade-upstart-and-a-simmering-turf-war.html?_r=0">revealed to the Times</a>. &quot;If you do, there will be problems, and you won&apos;t see him there very long.&quot;</p>

<p>New York Ice Cream, which started out as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161017162203/http://gothamist.com/2014/06/10/mister_softee_impersonator.php">Mister Softee imposter &quot;Master Softee,&quot;</a> has declared that &quot;from 34th to 60th Street, river to river, that&#x2019;s ours,&quot; and won&apos;t allow other rival vendors to cross those boarders. &quot;If one of my drivers goes to Midtown, they&apos;ll bring their trucks in and surround them&#x2014;a bunch of guys,&quot; according to Peter Bouziotis, the man who runs a Mister Softee depot. &quot;They&apos;ll start banging on the windows.&quot; </p>

<p>Turf wars between competing businesses <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161017162203/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/15/mister_softee_truck_yogo_truck_enga.php">aren&apos;t uncommon</a> and physical intimidation can also be expected in some form or another. Mister Softee drivers carry bats in all of their trucks, apparently, to ward off rivals. </p>

<p>But the street skirmishes are just one part of a larger war. Mister Softee has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161017162203/http://gothamist.com/2015/01/27/buh_buy_fake_mr_softee.php">won several</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161017162203/http://gothamist.com/2015/08/17/mister_softee_sues_for_illegal_use.php">legal battles</a> against New York Ice Cream, and one federal judge has ordered owner Dimitrios Tsirkos to pay Mister Softee $287,858.44 for legal fees on top of the nearly $500,000 he already owes. There&apos;s at least one New Yorker <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161017162203/http://gothamist.com/2016/05/25/hot_humid_hell_alert.php">cheering for climate change</a>.</p>

<p>Of course, the Ice Cream Turf Wars are well-documented; here&apos;s our look into an earlier skirmish:</p>
