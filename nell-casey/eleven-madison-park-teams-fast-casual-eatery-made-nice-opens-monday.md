					<p>On Monday, chef Daniel Humm and restaurateur Will Guidara of Eleven Madison Park fame open <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171011214806/http://www.madenicenyc.com/">Made Nice</a>, their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171011214806/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/08/eleven_madison_park_fast_casual.php">fast casual eatery</a> centered on salads and the power bowls that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171011214806/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/10/how_to_power_bowl_in_nyc.php">show no sign of slowing</a>. The duo have been working to open the restaurant since at least 2015, and now the opening will be timed with the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171011214806/http://gothamist.com/2017/02/21/eleven_madison_park_revamp.php">overhaul of Eleven Madison Park</a> and a seasonal Hamptons restaurant opening in late June. No rest for the well-fed.</p>

<p>Made Nice looks a lot like traditional fast casual eateries; Chipotle if Chipotle weren&apos;t super depressing. The notable differences are evident in the kitchen, however, which doesn&apos;t look dissimilar from a true restaurant kitchen where food is actually cooked, not just reheated. You may recognize Jon Batiste from the lively photo hanging in the back&#x2014;Humm and Guidara said they were inspired by the jazz musician&apos;s &quot;idea of &apos;social music,&apos;&quot; and &quot;creating community&quot; by making music (or in this case food) more accessible to more people without losing the technical complexities that make it great.&quot;</p>

<p>To that end, expect the grain bowls coming out to look more elegant and likely taste a lot better than the grab-and-go options at your local Pret. Dishes include a Cod Provencal ($15) with chickpea puree; Salmon Rosti ($15) with smoked salmon, soft boiled egg and &quot;potato croutons,&quot; which look like little hash brown nuggets; and the Quinoa Falafel ($11) with pickled beets and yogurt-marinated cucumber. </p>

<p>Humm and Guidara are the next in an increasing number of chefs who are trying out the Danny Meyer angle to success. Marc Forgione is an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171011214806/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/22/taquitoria.php#photo-1">investor in Taquitoria</a> and All&apos;onda&apos;s Chris Jaeckle is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171011214806/http://gothamist.com/2015/06/15/sushi_burrito_fine_whatever.php">does his sushi burrito thing</a> at Uma Temakeria and Mark Landner left Del Posto to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171011214806/http://gothamist.com/2016/12/24/chef_mark_ladner_is_leaving_del_pos.php">make pasta pronto</a>. They&apos;ll have to sell a boatload of grain bowls to  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171011214806/http://gothamist.com/2014/12/29/shake_shack_ipo.php">mimic Meyer&apos;s success</a>, so luckily they&apos;ve got the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171011214806/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/01/2016_michelin_winners.php">power of Michelin</a> behind them. </p>
