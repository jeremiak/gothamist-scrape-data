</div></div>					<p>Since <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504172510/http://gothamist.com/2010/11/09/its_official_a_shake_shack_for_the.php#photo-1">last November</a> we&apos;ve been hotly anticipating the first Brooklyn outpost of Danny Meyer&apos;s cult burger joint Shake Shack, and today, <em>at last</em>, the waiting is over... and the waiting on line begins! As we <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504172510/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/16/photos_a_sneak_peek_at_brooklyns_fi.php#photo-1">reported on Friday</a>, starting at 11:00 a.m. today you can gorge yourself on Shack and &apos;Shroom Burgers, not to mention the three Brooklyn-centric Concretes created specifically for the new location. </p>

<p>In keeping with tradition, the Brooklyn Shack&apos;s custom Concretes ($6.50 each) give a nod to the borough&apos;s unique culinary scene. Playing off Brooklyn&apos;s most famous tagline, the &quot;Fudge-eddaboutit&quot; uses a specially made, single-origin chocolate from local boys <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504172510/http://mastbrothers.com/">Mast Bros.</a> with chocolate custard and cinnamon fudge sauce. &quot;We wanted something with peaks and valleys,&quot; says Culinary Manager Mark Rosati of the custom chocolate creation, &quot;but with the full flavor of chocolate.&quot; The resulting flavors strike a luscious balance between sugary and bitter, while the &quot;Urban LumberShack&quot; blends vanilla custard with fried Belgian waffles, bananas and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504172510/http://www.theredheadnyc.com/">The Redhead</a>&apos;s bacon peanut brittle. The creamy banana paired with the crunchy, salty brittle and crisp waffles made for a nice contrast, but we would reserve this flavor only for the diehard sweet tooths. </p>

<p>Finally our favorite new Concrete&#x2014;and perhaps a nod to local politician and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504172510/http://gothamist.com/2010/11/09/its_official_a_shake_shack_for_the.php#photo-1">burger enthusiast Marty Markowitz</a> (whose offices are across the street)&#x2014;the appropriately punny &quot;Borough Precedent,&quot; combines crunchy <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504172510/http://www.earlybirdfoods.com/">Early Bird</a> granola with a burst of seasonal fruit (for now a delightfully tart cranberry and orange compote) all whipped together in vanilla custard. Marty himself&#x2014;who will join Mayor Bloomberg at the grand opening today&#x2014;was thrilled that the Shack had &quot;finally hit the big time in Brooklyn&quot; and offered &quot;kudos to Danny for really &#x2018;shaking up&#x2019; the Downtown Brooklyn food scene!&#x201D;&#x202C;&#x202A; </p>

<p>The rest of the menu will be familiar to Shack enthusiasts, with the exception of the hot dogs, where Rosati has created a customized &quot;Mutt Menu&quot; where dog diners can pick and choose their toppings. The newest addition are spicy, tomato-simmered onions that top the &quot;Frisky Dog,&quot; providing a nice element of heat, and can also be applied to gooey cheese fries for added zing.</p>

<p>The interior is reminiscent of other recent Shack outlets, playing on the industrial motif with a gray/green color scheme and sturdy metal chairs. As with the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504172510/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/12/shake_shack_1.php#photo-13">Theater District outpost</a>, reclaimed wood from a former bowling alley was used to decorate the walls and create tables. &quot;We aimed to take the Madison Square Park location and put it inside,&quot; explains Rosati and indeed you feel as though you&apos;re outside with the floor-to-ceiling windows, which make up three of the restaurant&apos;s four walls. In a delightful twist of fate&#x2014;or was it just clever marketing?&#x2014;the Shack Shake shares a building with another giant of ground meat sandwiches: Burger King.</p>

<p>At this morning&apos;s ribbon-cutting, Mayor Bloomberg said, &quot;Putting New Yorkers to work is our top priority - and the workers we place in jobs at this new Shake Shack are just some of the 32,500 New Yorkers whom we have helped find employment. So today&#x2019;s news isn&#x2019;t only good for the Brooklynites who will get to enjoy this delicious food, it&#x2019;s great news for our City&#x2019;s economy and the revitalization of downtown Brooklyn.&quot; </p>

<p><em>The Brooklyn <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504172510/http://www.shakeshack.com/">Shake Shack</a>, located at 409 Fulton Street between Willoughby &amp; Adams, is open seven days a week from 11 a.m. to 11 p.m. (718) 307-7590</em></p>
