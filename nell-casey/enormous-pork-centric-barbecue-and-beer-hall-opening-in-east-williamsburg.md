<p>There&apos;ll be another addition to our growing barbecue scene come this summer when pig man Tyson Ho opens his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140624121745/http://newyork.seriouseats.com/2014/02/tyson-ho-arrogant-swine-barbecue-opening-brooklyn.html?ref=title">whole hog and beer hall</a> in East Williamsburg. The Flushing-born pit master&#x2014;who trained with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140624121745/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/30/pitmaster_ed_mitchell_talks_big_app.php">lauded NC master Ed Mitchell</a>&#x2014;brings his pop-up pork feasts <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140624121745/http://newyork.seriouseats.com/2013/06/the-hog-days-of-summer-event-recap.html">Hot Days Of Summer</a> into a more permanent format with a new venture at 173 Morgan Avenue, according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140624121745/http://newyork.seriouseats.com/2014/02/tyson-ho-arrogant-swine-barbecue-opening-brooklyn.html?ref=title">Serious Eats</a>.</p>

<p>The enormous, 5,000 square foot indoor/outdoor space will specialize in communal pig picking-style dining with swine they&apos;ll smoke on-site. &quot;That&apos;s the thing about North Carolina barbecue: pig picking is a party,&quot; Ho tells the blog. Hopefully this means lots of beer-fueled hands-in-the-piggy kinds of evenings. In addition to the big pigs, Ho and crew are bringing in country hams from around the country for a fully fleshed porcine experience.</p>
