<p>Longtime Williamsburg dive bar <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161208121407/http://www.daddysbarbrooklyn.com/">Daddy&apos;s</a> will close at the end of December, ownership <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161208121407/https://www.instagram.com/p/BNpaZJNhX9u/?taken-by=daddysbrooklyn">announced on Instagram today</a>. &quot;15 years ago we started Daddy&apos;s on a wing and a prayer,&quot; the post reads. &quot;We nickel and dimed ourselves a space, a labor of love, for our community: friends, neighbors, strangers... we would be nothing without you. You made the place home.&quot;</p>

<p>An explicit reason for the shutter hasn&apos;t yet been discussed, but the posting offers a hint: &quot;Times change, neighborhoods change, and this is our time to move on to other achievements.&quot; Nearby chill drinks spot Over The Eight is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161208121407/http://www.brooklynvegan.com/over-the-eight-closing-in-december/">also closing in December</a>. </p>

<p>The Graham Avenue watering hole, with its unique horseshoe-shaped bar, warmed up the neighborhood with a regulars-heavy scene and their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161208121407/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/20/the_best_fireplace_bars_in_nyc.php">toasty fireplace</a>. They&apos;re also a go-to spot for cheap hot dogs alongside (comparably) cheap cocktails or beers. </p>

<p>To end its long reign, the bar will be hosting a closing night party on December 30th that&apos;s open to anyone wanting to pay their respects. The final night, New Year&apos;s Eve, will be reserved just for friends and family. </p>
