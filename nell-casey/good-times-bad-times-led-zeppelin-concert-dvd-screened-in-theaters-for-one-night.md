<p>When news broke that Led Zeppelin would reunite for a one-night-only tribute show at London&apos;s O2 arena, we&#x2014;along with 20 million other eager fans&#x2014;obsessively refreshed our browsers in the hopes of scoring a ticket in the lottery. Suffice it to say, we did not find ourselves jetting off to England and were forced to watch crappy bootlegs on YouTube that were taken down as quickly as they showed up. But now we&apos;ll be able to experience the epic event as if we <em>had</em> bought those $3,495 bootleg tickets on eBay&#x2014;sort of. The concert DVD <em>Led Zeppelin: Celebration Day</em> is coming to movie theaters Wednesday, October 17th for one night only.</p>

<p>In December of 2007, Plant, Page and Paul Jones reunited and were joined by the late John Bonham&apos;s son, Jason Bonham, for a two hour plus show in front of 18,000 fans to pay tribute to Atlantic Records co-founder <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422220203/http://gothamist.com/2006/12/15/ahmet_ertegun_1.php">Ahmet Ertegun</a>. The set covered all the Zep favorites&#x2014;&quot;Black Dog,&quot; &quot;Dazed and Confused,&quot; &quot;Stairway To Heaven,&quot; etc&#x2014;plus a nice mid-set meander through some &quot;deeper cuts&quot; like &quot;For Your Life&quot; and &quot;Nobody&apos;s Fault But Mine.&quot; See the full set list below.</p>

<p>So if watching aging rock gods gyrate on screen while you sit in a climate-controlled movie theater sounds like a good time, grab yourself tickets at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422220203/http://www.ledzeppelin.com/celebrationday/o2_listings.html">one of the participating cinemas</a> and get ready to Rock And Roll. And don&apos;t worry, this time it won&apos;t be delayed because Jimmy Page <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422220203/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/led-zeppelin-reunion-concert-postponed-due-to-fractured-finger-20071101">fell down in his garden and broke his finger</a>. If you&apos;d prefer to air guitar in the comfort of your own apartment, the concert will be available for purchase in audio/video forms on November 19th. </p>
