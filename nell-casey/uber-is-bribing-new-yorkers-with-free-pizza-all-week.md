<p>Hard to believe it&apos;s been five years since <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110091053/http://gothamist.com/2012/11/04/uber.php">surge pricing</a> became a fixture of the local lexicon, but Uber&apos;s part of our world now and they&apos;re thanking our half decade of patronage with the promise of free food. For the next five days, the company&apos;s sponsoring an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110091053/https://www.uber.com/info/nyc-5-year/">#UberPizzaParty</a> promotion that includes free slices from pizzerias around the five boroughs. Each day, a different borough gets the gratis grub; all you have to do is show the Uber app on your phone to get the hookup. </p>
