<p>We&apos;re truly #blessed to live in a place where just about anything can be delivered to us, at more or less any time of the day. This #blessing now includes that time of the day (i.e. NOW) when our bodies cry out for delicious noodles. Michael White, whose Altamarea Group runs some very pasta-friendly restaurants, has answered New York City&apos;s call for more carbs with a new &quot;Pasta On Demand&quot; service through <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170120121903/https://ubereats.com/nyc/">UberEATS</a>. This is the best delivery innovation <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170120121903/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/09/boom_burritos_delivers.php">since that burrito operation</a>.</p>

<p>White&apos;s restaurant Ristorante Morini serves as the delivery point, executing a menu of six pastas. &quot;We aimed to create a menu that captures some of Altamarea&apos;s signature pastas,&quot; White said in the announcement. &quot;We curated dishes that can be delivered to users&apos; doorsteps in a timely manner, while still providing the same high-quality and consistency we offer in our restaurants.&quot;</p>

<p>Among the selections are a simple rigatoni in a tomato and basil sauce ($14) to the more adventurous creste pasta (curly &quot;rooster&apos;s crest&quot; shape) made with squid ink and tossed with a shrimp and calamari ragu with breadcrumbs. Additionally, they&apos;ll deliver a handful of salads (guilt assuagers) and desserts (the opposite).</p>

<p>Delivery&apos;s only available in Manhattan but the range spans from 26th Street to 135th Street. </p>
