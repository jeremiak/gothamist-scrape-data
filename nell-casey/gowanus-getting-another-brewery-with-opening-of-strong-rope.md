<p>A new brewery with a hyper-local focus is going to be bringing some new suds to Gowanus when it opens on President Street on Thursday. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170130015817/http://strongropebrewery.com/">Strong Rope Brewery</a> is using local produce, herbs and spices from New York State to develop unique beers that will only be available out of the brewery&apos;s small tap room, which will operate on limited days in the evening. Owner and head brewer Jason Sahler will be pouring eight of his own beers in the 30-seat space with an additional two tap lines with offerings from other breweries. </p>

<p>&#x201C;This is a place focused on beer, on people coming and enjoying and talking about beer,&#x201D; Sahler <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170130015817/http://www.brooklynpaper.com/stories/38/51/24-strong-rope-brewery-2015-12-18-bk.html?utm_source=20151215&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=storylink&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter">explained to Brooklyn Paper</a>. &#x201C;We&#x2019;re really trying to push all the different things we can do with beer like tastings, pairings, talks, competitions The idea is to have a super beer-centric place.&#x201D; The brewery&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170130015817/http://strongropebrewery.com/main-line/">Main Line</a> of brews includes a cream ale, an American Amber ale and an American Brown Ale, plus high ABV &quot;Reserve&quot; brews and the possibility of cask and other &quot;living ales&quot; in the future. Sahler says his focus on &quot;American and British beer styles&quot; will set him apart from nearby Threes Brewing and Other Half.</p>

<p>To celebrate the opening, Strong Rope is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170130015817/http://strongropebrewery.com/upcoming-events/">throwing a party</a> in their new taproom on Thursday from 5 p.m. to 10 p.m. They&apos;ll have their brews, naturally, plus some music to soundtrack the drinking.</p>

<p><em>574A President Street, Gowanus; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170130015817/http://strongropebrewery.com/">website</a>. Open 5 p.m. to 10 p.m. Thursday and Friday, 3 p.m. to 10 p.m. Saturday and Sunday</em></p>
