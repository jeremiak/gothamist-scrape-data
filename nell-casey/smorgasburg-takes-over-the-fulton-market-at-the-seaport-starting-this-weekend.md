<p>For several years there&apos;s been some kind of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170401033204/http://www.smorgasburg.com/">Smorgasburg</a> encampment at the South Street Seaport and this season they&apos;re moving into the Fulton Market Building, part of the big new development coming to Pier 17 and the surrounding area. Historically, the market has operated outdoors, but this year they&apos;ll be indoors while operating a bar outdoors. There&apos;ll be both indoor and outdoor seating available at the space. </p>

<p>Cemitas El Tigre, Landhaus, Red Hook Lobster Pound and Lumpia Shack are all making return appearances at the Seaport market. They&apos;re joined by newcomers Home Frite, serving Belgian fries, and Wowfulls, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170401033204/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/31/big_mozz_sticks_chicago_beef_sandwi.php#photo-4">Hong Kong egg waffles</a> you probably saw on Instagram. On Sundays, an outdoor marketplace selling food from local purveyors, in addition to specialty goods, operates nearby at the Fulton Stall Market.</p>

<p>The Seaport Smorg debuts today for Memorial Day Weekend, then continues operations daily Monday - Thursday from 11 a.m. - 9 p.m., Friday from 11 a.m. - 11 PM, Saturday from 10 a.m. - 11 p.m. and Sundays from 11 a.m. to 9 p.m.</p>
