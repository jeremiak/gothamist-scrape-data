<p>The Fatty Crew arrives on the Lower East Side with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151007012031/http://pigandkhao.com/">Pig &amp; Khao</a>, a collaboration with <em>Top Chef</em> alum Leah Cohen serving shared plates that riff off traditional Southeast Asian cuisine. The restaurant officially opens tonight in the former Falai space, serving a lunch and dinner menu focusing primarily on Filipino and Thai flavors with notes from other regional cuisines. </p>

<p>The pork-heavy menu promises an intriguing blend of spices, herbs and textures. A crispy pata (pork leg) and picked mango salad comes with soy-sauce/five spice cooked pork shank and coriander and crispy garlic gets dipped in a &quot;secret family recipe&quot; of sweet and sour liver. The grilled pork neck and watermelon salad is served over toasted rice with a zesty chili lime fish sauce, shallot, chicharon and herbs. Finally, if you&apos;re not in a porcine mood, (deep breath) try the crispy quail adobo with Szechuan peppercorn, coconut vinegar, soy sauce, bay leaves, crispy garlic, scallion and a soft-boiled quail egg. A nice selection of canned beers, punch, wines and shojis will quench your thirst, but it&apos;s the &quot;self-serve bottomless tap&quot; serving seasonal beer in the backyard that really got our motor running. </p>

<p>The design fuses odes to the Lower East Side&apos;s 19th century past with elements of Southeast Asian design&#x2014;a dragon-headed, hand-carved Filipino bicycle adorns a bright green accent wall, while Edison bulb light fixtures hang down from the copper ceilings. The cozy, 1,000 square foot dining area features a long row of tables and the chef&apos;s bar, where chef Cohen will nightly prepare her signature dishes. While the weather is on your side, wander out back and you&apos;ll find a few tables under trellises in the backyard garden, as well as that alluring self-serve tap (tappable for $15).</p>
