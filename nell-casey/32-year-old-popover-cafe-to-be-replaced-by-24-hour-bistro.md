<p>After 32 years, much loved Upper West Side eatery <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429075429/http://www.popovercafe.com/">Popover Cafe</a> will raise its final roll on January 5th. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429075429/http://www.westsiderag.com/2013/12/04/popover-cafe-closing-after-losing-lease">West Side Rag</a> broke the news yesterday, reporting that signage in the window indicated the restaurant had lost its lease and would shutter just after the new years.</p>

<p>Opened as a tiny eight-table, no-oven operation in 1981 by founder Carol Baer, the restaurant served neighborhood folk looking for a simple meal made with care. Eventually, the restaurant grew to seat 100 and locals and visitors alike returned often for the lovingly made dishes and airy popovers served alongside. </p>

<p>The restaurant had been a holdout in the increasing chain invasion currently unfolding in the neighborhood, which recently claimed the lives of institutions like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429075429/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/28/farewell_big_nicks_uws_pizza_joint.php">Big Nicks</a>. Despite rising costs, things seemed sturdy. Unfortunately, Baer and her husband had the great misfortunate to trust in swindler Bernie Madoff, who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429075429/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/12/nyregion/12bigcity.html?scp=2&amp;sq=carol%20baer,%20dominus&amp;st=cse">robbed them of their life savings</a>. </p>

<p>We spoke with Baer this afternoon, who revealed she&apos;d actually been looking for a buyer so she could retire sometime in the near future when the troubles unfolded. &quot;We had a six month process that was very, very close to closing&#x2014;within days&#x2014;within days&#x2014;and the buyer backed out saying that the landlord was too difficult to deal with,&quot; she explained. &quot;It was such an onerous process.&quot; Ideally, she&apos;s hoping someone will stand up and decide they want to continue the cafe, if only in name. &quot;Even small Popover Cafes all over the country would be great, that&apos;s always been my dream.&quot;</p>

<p>Baer also revealed the new tenant who&apos;ll take over the space when she vacates next year. &quot;It&apos;s going to be a 24-hour, round the clock bakery and bistro.&quot; Hmm, where have we <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429075429/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/24/big_nicks_will_become_a_patisserie.php">heard that before</a>? &quot;Wait until the co-op hears about that, it&apos;s going to be a shitstorm,&quot; Baer mused. &quot;But that&apos;s not my problem anymore!&quot; </p>
