<p>Enjoying a cocktail at the balcony bar overlooking the Metropolitan Museum of Art&apos;s expansive Great Hall is one of the best &quot;secrets&quot; of the legendary art space, especially since imbibers are serenaded by a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144716/http://www.metmuseum.org/events/programs/concerts-and-performances/ethel">hip string quartet</a> while they drink. Now, in conjunction with the current artist in residence program, the Met has created a new line of cocktails inspired by their partnership with the group of artists known as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144716/http://www.alarmwillsound.com/">Alarm Will Sound</a>.</p>

<p>Taking a cue from the 20-member group&apos;s adventurous and ambitious pieces, which seamlessly merge classical pieces with contemporary flair, the Museum concocted four new cocktails that represent both the venerable institution&apos;s history, as well as its place as an arbiter of modern taste. The resulting cocktails&#x2014;named <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144716/http://www.metmuseum.org/visit/plan-your-visit/dining-at-the-museum/aws-cocktail-menu">The Permanent Collection</a> in reference to Alarm Will Sound&apos;s first performance piece at the Met&#x2014;are riffs on classic drinks, at once accessible and familiar but with new flavors that morph them into something new.</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="101013metcocktails3.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144716im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_nellcasey/101013metcocktails3.jpg" width="640" height="427"> <br> <i> <span class="photo_caption">&quot;Blood Orange Manhattan&quot; (Nell Casey/Gothamist)</span></i></div> <p></p>

<p>For the Blood Orange Manhattan, Beverage Manager Robert Burbano soaks wedges of blood orange in Maker&apos;s Mark, giving the bourbon both sweetness and a zesty citrus note. The cocktail&apos;s fruit notes give it almost an Old Fashioned-like flavor, especially with the sweet brandied cherries as garnish. It&apos;s the strongest of the bunch and ideal for imbibers who aren&apos;t into too much fussing with their drinks.</p>

<p>The Museum&apos;s award winning pastry chef Randy Eastman whips up an airy lemon foam for The Gin and Apple Tonic (picture at top), which elevates the simple cocktail into highbrow territory. It&apos;s an effervescent and refreshing drink, with lots of apple flavor courtesy of Finger Lakes orchard <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144716/http://www.redjacketorchards.com/">Red Jacket</a>&apos;s crisp apple juice. </p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="101013metcocktails1.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144716im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_nellcasey/101013metcocktails1.jpg" width="640" height="427"> <br> <i> <span class="photo_caption">Pomegranate Margarita (Nell Casey/Gothamist)</span></i></div> <p></p>

<p>Pomegranate juice adds a tangy sourness to the special Margarita, which uses an anejo tequila for extra oak flavor. Chef Eastman also contributes a lemon confit to the Vodka Collins, which subs out the gin in the quintessential sweet-and-sour drink.</p>

<p>On the day of each Alarm Will Sound performance, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144716/http://www.metmuseum.org/visit/plan-your-visit/dining-at-the-museum/great-hall-balcony-bar">Great Hall Balcony Bar</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144716/http://www.metmuseum.org/visit/plan-your-visit/dining-at-the-museum/petrie-court-cafe-and-wine-bar">Petrie Court Cafe</a> will offer the special cocktails for $12 a pop. Tomorrow marks the debut performance of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144716/http://www.metmuseum.org/events/programs/concerts-and-performances/aws-1-permanent-collection?eid=4157"><em>The Permanent Collection</em></a>, which the ensemble created as a musical version of the museum&apos;s pieces.
