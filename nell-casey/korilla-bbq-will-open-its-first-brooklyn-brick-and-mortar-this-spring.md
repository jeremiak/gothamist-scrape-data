<p>The distinctive orange tiger stripes of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170202110758/http://korillabbq.com/">Korilla BBQ</a> crew will soon be emblazoned on 2 MetroTech. The Korean barbecue-inspired food business, which began as a food truck in 2010, will open inside the Forest City Ratner Companies building in Downtown Brooklyn sometime in late spring or early summer. It&apos;s their first Brooklyn outpost that isn&apos;t on four wheels.</p>

<p>Korilla, which serves delicious burritos and rice bowls topped with things like bulgogi and organic tofu, opened their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170202110758/http://gothamist.com/2014/08/11/korilla_bbq_plants_roots_near_astor.php">first brick-and-mortar</a> near Astor Place in 2014. The crew also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170202110758/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/25/solber_pupusas_take_top_vendys_hono.php#photo-1">won a Vendy Award</a> as Rookie of the Year in 2011 and they&apos;re certainly one of the stalwarts still trucking after the big food truck boom.</p>

<p>&quot;As Downtown Brooklyn continues to grow and expand, so is Korilla,&quot; owner Edward Song said in a statement. &quot;We want to bring a fresh, new concept for our Brooklynites to enjoy. We&apos;re ready to bring the neighborhood the best version of Korilla yet. Brooklyn, you ready?&quot;</p>
