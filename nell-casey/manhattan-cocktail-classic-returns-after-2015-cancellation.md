<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170308104615/http://www.manhattancocktailclassic.com/">Manhattan Cocktail Classic</a> has lain dormant for the past two years, but a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170308104615/http://marketwatchmag.com/manhattan-cocktail-classic-returns-to-new-york-city/">new report out of Market Watch</a> reveals that the fancy tippling event will be returning this spring for a full week between May 11th and May 17th. At the helm sits a new captain, James Moreland, who&apos;s been tasked with resurrecting the eight-year-old event that was last produced in NYC <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170308104615/http://gothamist.com/2014/05/11/photos_nypd_gala_manhattan_cocktail.php#photo-3">in 2014</a>.</p>

<p>The festival&apos;s signature Gala event has undergone a transformation under Moreland, who&apos;s reducing the attendance capacity and also limiting the big sponsorship to two brands, one white spirit and one brown spirit. &quot;It allows for a better return on investment for the big brands&#x2014;they&apos;re not fighting for the spotlight,&quot; Moreland told Market Watch. &quot;I think a lot of the brands, big and small, complained about that problem during the last Classic.&quot;</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170308104615/http://gothamist.com/2015/03/25/manhattan_cocktail_classic_1.php">2015 Classic</a> was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170308104615/http://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/2015/04/manhattan-cocktail-classic-2015-cancelled/">canceled</a> because the &quot;production of the event had a late start resulting in many brands not being able to participate.&quot; </p>

<p>The 2017 event reportedly moves to The New Yorker Hotel, and the Gala will be held at the Loeb Central Park Boathouse instead of the New York Public Library, where it&apos;s been held in prior years. Smaller events will happen in conjunction with the bookend opening and closing parties, including seminars and additional parties, plus industry-only education sessions. </p>

<p>Tickets are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170308104615/http://www.manhattancocktailclassic.com/">not yet on sale</a> but spots to the opening Gala will run about $275 per person for GA and $350 for VIP.</p>
