title: The 7 Best Places To Get A Grilled Cheese Sandwich In NYC
---

	
										<p><em>Whether stuffed with imported French fromage or plastic-wrapped cheese product, we are true gluttons for grilled cheese. Luckily, we&apos;re not the only ones, as the city has seen a handful of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429090758/http://gothamist.com/tags/grilledcheese">grilled cheese joints</a> open in the last year, offering decadent dairy fillings between two slices of buttery bread. And while we still cringe when forking over $13 for what we can make at home for under a buck, there&apos;s no denying that we have some exemplary options when it comes to cheesy carb cravings. Below, a few of our favorite places to get our grilled cheese on; as always, leave yours in the comments.</em></p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="101713littlemuenster.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429090758im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_nellcasey/101713littlemuenster.jpg" width="640" height="480"> <br> <i> <span class="photo_caption">Little Muenster (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429090758/http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/little-muenster-manhattan?select=_Kk1c6h_ZAaORJdge8pIAA#7Tmh39qv8JgY9DTpqYxbgA">Michelle Y.</a>/Yelp)</span></i></div> <p></p>

<p><strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429090758/http://littlemuenster.com/">LITTLE MUENSTER</a></strong>: With a menu made up entirely of grilled cheese concoctions and the soups and sides that complement them, this Lower East Side eatery is a one-stop shopping for all your cheesy cravings. Proprietors and real-life couple Vanessa Palazio and Adam Schneider opened their Muenster mecca in 2011, followed shortly thereafter by a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429090758/http://gothamist.com/2012/09/18/fancy_grilled_cheese_no_frills_at_d.php#photo-1">satellite shop in Dumbo</a>, which serves a smaller selection of the original&apos;s signature sandwiches. </p>

<p>Right now both shops are offering the Autumn ($8.75) and the Veggie ($9), which we can attest are both out of this world. Butternut squash, sage brown butter, nutty asiago and muenster make up the seasonally-inspired sandwich; sharp white cheddar gets some added creaminess from ripe avocado, with lemon and herbs adding zest and zing to the latter. They&apos;re also doing a killer Pig Belly ($11) with gouda and caramelized onions and a Chicken Mole ($9) with longhorn cheddar, sour cream and cilantro if you&apos;re in the market for something more substantial. </p>

<p><em>Little Muenster has two locations: 100 Stanton Street between Ludlow and Orchard Streets, (212) 203-7197 and 145 Front Street between Jay and Pearl Streets, (646) 499-4331; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429090758/http://littlemuenster.com/">littlemuenster.com</a>.</em></p>

<p><strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429090758/http://www.earlsny.com/">EARL&apos;S BEER &amp; CHEESE</a></strong>: We&apos;ve already called out this tiny dairy-obsessed joint for their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429090758/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/12/where_to_find_the_best_beer_cheese.php">transcendent beer cheese</a> but their killer grilled cheese sandwiches are also well deserving of praise. Come with a big appetite for their NY State Cheddar-based sammie ($8), which packs in pork belly, kimchi and a fried egg between two thick slices of sourdough bread. As soon as you bite in, the runny egg oozes into the rest of the sandwich, coating everything in luscious yellow goodness that, while delicious, requires extensive napkin use, so be forewarned. They&apos;re also griddling up a Double-Cream Brie on brioche ($6) with sweet-and-spicy blackberry mostarda and a Calabro Mozzarella ($6) with miso mayo, potato chips and dill pickles on an English Muffin. Order up a bowl of the Spicy Tomato Soup ($7), as tradition dictates, and prepare for the cheese coma.</p>

<p><em>Earl&apos;s Beer &amp; Cheese is located at 1259 Park Avenue between 97th and 98th Streets, (212) 289-1581; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429090758/http://www.earlsny.com/">earlsny.com</a></em></p>

<p><strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429090758/http://noormanskil.com/">NOORMAN&apos;S KIL</a></strong>: Whiskey and grilled cheese, ain&apos;t nothin&apos; wrong with that. This Williamsburg whiskey haven rocks a killer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429090758/http://noormanskil.com/whiskey">400 whiskies</a> from all over the world and they also happen to whip up some truly decadent and delicious grilled cheese sandwiches to boot. You can keep it simple with the Jane ($5)&#x2014;NY Sharp Cheddar and My Friend&apos;s Mustard on sourdough&#x2014;grab a little sweet-and-savory action with the Betsy ($6)&#x2014;Vermont Chevre, apricot jam, honey and thyme on ciabatta&#x2014;or truly indulge with the decadent Karen ($7), which packs in Fromage Blanc, Gruyere, NY Sharp Cheddar and Havarti between two slices of sourdough. </p>

<p>For our money, we dig on the Maefred ($6): Double Creme Brie, local mushrooms, diced onions and rosemarry on crusty ciabatta. The brie melts into all the nooks and crannies of the bread, binding together the tender mushrooms and sweet onions, while the rosemary adds a lovely woodsy balance to the rich sandwich. Order up a glass of Redemption Rye and you have yourself a perfect meal on a chilly evening.</p>

This Queens joint likes to have fun with its food, pairing delicious dairy with interesting and unexpected flavor combinations. Their Manchego &amp; Ricotta ($9) creation includes minted eggplant and capers while the Gouda ($10) is accompanied by black bean hummus, guava jam and pickled jalapenos. </p>

<p>With the exception of their classic Cheddar &amp; Mozzarella, which comes with the traditional cup of tomato soup, all of their sandwiches are accompanied by a special green salad; we hear cheese calories don&apos;t count when accompanied by vegetables. They offer a limited menu of their grilled cheeses at dinnertime, so swing by for a weekend lunch to get the full experience.</p>
