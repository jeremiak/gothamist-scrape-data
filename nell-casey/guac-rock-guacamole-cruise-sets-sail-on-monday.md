<p>All aboard, avocado addicts, for the 4th annual <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408141516/http://nachosny.com/2013/07/guac-rock-is-august-19/">Guac Rock</a> cruise/concert/guacamole-eating festival! Next Monday, August 19th, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408141516/http://oncruises.com/cruises/nyc/jewel-yacht.php">Jewel yacht</a> sets sail from Kips Bay for a three-hour tour around the East River, featuring live music from three New York-based bands, plenty of beer and a &quot;significant amount of guacamole.&quot; </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408141516/http://nachosny.com/about/">Nachos NY</a>, a nacho blog-turned-book, organizes the annual event, bringing along winners of their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408141516/http://nachosny.com/2013/05/the-winners-of-guactacular-2013/">Guactacular</a> contest as well as some surprise avocado mashers and alumni from previous competitions. They&apos;ll provide plenty of chips for dipping, though no judgement if you prefer to spoon the green goodness directly into your mouth.</p>

<p>The Fine Machines, Beverly and Joywave are scheduled to perform on the cruise, plus the boat affords beautiful sunset views of the Manhattan and Brooklyn coastlines. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408141516/http://www.ticketweb.com/t3/sale/SaleEventDetail?dispatch=loadSelectionData&amp;eventId=3743964&amp;pl=rocksoff">Tickets go for $18</a> and include as much guac as you can shovel in until the bowls are dipped clean. A cash bar on board pours beers priced in the $5 range and a bit of sweetness in ice pop form can be procured from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408141516/http://lanewyorkina.com/Home.html">la Newyorkina</a> for a few bucks. </p>
