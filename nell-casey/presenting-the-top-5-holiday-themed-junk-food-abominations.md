Quite frankly those Gingerbread men look like some creepy Hansel & Gretel nightmare just waiting for you to fall asleep so they can take a butcher knife to your throat then ride away on their satanic chocolate marshmellow reindeer.

So here comes Target with a line of \"Holiday Milks\" and, lo and behold, a Red Velvet Chocolate offering joins Egg Nog and Chocolate Mint to help pad your holiday calorie count. The milk itself is more viscous than regular milk and an unsettling shade of pink we like to call \"Pepto Bismol: Dark.\" Need an increased sense of self loathing?
