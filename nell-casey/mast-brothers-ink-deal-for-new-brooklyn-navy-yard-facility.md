<p>A melted industrial chocolate scandal can&apos;t keep a good beard down if those beards belong to the Mast Brothers, who&apos;ve put a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170112091619/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/18/mast_brothers_fraudsters.php">craft chocolate brouhaha</a> behind them and sealed a new multi-million dollar deal in Brooklyn. Rick and Michael Mast are the latest local food makers to sign a deal at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170112091619/http://www.grubstreet.com/2016/04/mast-brothers-navy-yard.html?mid=twitter_grubst">reports GrubStreet</a>, inking a lease on a new facility. Santa Claus must not have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170112091619/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/22/mast_bros_dark_christmas.php">stuffed their stockings</a> entirely full of coal after all.</p>

<p>The 65,000-square-foot space will be inside the Green Manufacturing Center and employ over 100 people. There, workers will toil away on the brothers&apos; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170112091619/http://gothamist.com/2015/03/16/mast_brothers_hipster_backlash.php">polarizing chocolate bars</a> in addition to brewing chocolate &quot;beer,&quot; which unfortunately contains no alcohol. </p>

<p><em>This post has been updated to correct a previous error regarding the terms of the new facility. The Green Manufacturing Center inside the Brooklyn Navy Yard is worth $68 million, not the deal signed by the Mast Brothers.</em></p>
