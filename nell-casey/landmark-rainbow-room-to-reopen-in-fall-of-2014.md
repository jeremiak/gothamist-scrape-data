<p>The famed Rainbow Room atop 30 Rockefeller Center get on a new lease on life today just one year after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130922053353/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/16/the_rainbow_room_is_now_officially.php">receiving landmark status</a>. Tishman Speyer, the group that operates Rockefeller Center, announced that the iconic restaurant and ballroom would triumphantly reopen in the fall of 2014 after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130922053353/http://gothamist.com/2009/01/10/rainbow_appears_to_be_fading_with_c.php">four years of inoperation</a>. </p>

<p>The 65th Floor space will operate as multiple venues from a private, catered event space to a public restaurant. The restaurant will operate with group dining five days a week, as well as a Sunday brunch and at least one night per week for public dining. An outdoor terrace also serves as a bar and lounge, which will be open to the public at least five days per week, offering cocktails and snacks. </p>

<p>Restaurant development group Blau + Associates has been tapped to manage the reopening process and Gabellini Sheppard Architects&#x2014;who designed Top of the Rock&#x2014;will design all the public spaces. Details about an executive chef are to be announced in the coming months. </p>
