<p>Even if you&apos;ve got <em>Cafe Bustelo 4evr</em> tattooed on your eyelids, take a day to embrace the finer side of caffeination at the <strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108043223/http://www.coffeeandteafestival.com/nyc/">NYC Coffee and Tea Festival</a></strong> this Saturday and Sunday. From pour-overs to cold brews, aeropress to percolators, just about every style of brewed coffee will be served up and sipped thanks to 60+ vendors. As you make your way through the crowd, admiring the subtle blueberry undertones of a biodynamic Colombian roast, there will also be seminars on everything from tea blending to Turkish coffee, and a latte art throwdown amongst some of the best baristas from across the country. The two-day extravaganza is expecting thousands of attendees, but if you&apos;ve only got an hour or two, consider getting a &quot;rush hour&quot; ticket to get in, get buzzed, and get out in record time. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108043223/http://www.coffeeandteafestival.com/nyc/tickets.html">Tickets $10 - $35</a>. <em>(Scott Heins)</em></p>

<p>A Korean take on chicken and waffles is popping up at Williamsburg&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108043223/http://www.reclamationbarbrooklyn.com/">Reclamation Bar</a> on Saturday evening. Irene Yoo of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108043223/http://www.yooeating.com/">Yooeating</a> takes inspiration from LA institution Roscoe&apos;s Chicken N&apos; Waffles, making a <strong>Pork N&apos; Waffles</strong> with fried pork cutlet on kimchi scallion waffles. &quot;Donkatsu is one of my dad&apos;s favorite dishes&#x2014;a Korean adaptation of the Japanese tonkatsu, a kind of schnitzel that&apos;s usually served with rice and a sweet and tangy brown gravy,&quot; Yoo says. She&apos;s serving her version with donkatsu sauce and sambal maple syrup, plus sides including Korean chive &quot;coleslaw&quot;, soy pickled jalapenos, and kkadugi (radish kimchi). The pop-up runs from 6 p.m. until 9p.m.; cash only.</p>
