<p>We&apos;ve seen a lot of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150218013930/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/04/pizza_hut_introduces_big_pizza_slid.php">silly</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150218013930/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/02/pizza_hutlittle_caesars.php">horrifying</a> pizza creations cross our screens, so it takes a particularly zany pie topper to get our attention. Greenwich Village pizzeria <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150218013930/http://www.ribaltapizzarestaurant.com/">Ribalta</a> had debuted a new &quot;Americana&quot; pizza ($16) that sounds like a children&apos;s birthday party all in one dish: a pie topped with mozzarella, hot dogs and french fries. Does it come with a ketchup dipping sauce?</p>

<p>We spoke with Ribalta owner Rosario Procino, who tells us the unusual pie is actually common where he&apos;s from in Naples, and contrary to popular opinion, &quot;there&apos;s a lot of creativity going on in Neopolitan pizza.&quot; As for why he selected these particular ingredients to represent the States, Procino explained, &quot;Fries and hot dogs in the Italian conception is always something seen as American. We saw it as a tribute to New York and America, blending the tradition of Naples with America, which is where we are; honoring the country that&apos;s hosting us.&quot; The restaurant sources its hot dogs from Hebrew National, and though they&apos;re buying their french fries elsewhere for now, Procino reveals they&apos;re thinking of making their own.</p>

<p>What they do make, however, is their own is their crust, which Procino is quick to point out follows traditional dough-making practices of his homeland, including a special kind of yeast not used by other Neopolitan pizzerias stateside. Though you can chose one of the restaurant&apos;s suggested pies, Ribalta is also launching a &quot;Make Your Own Pizza&quot; menu today, where you can call the topping&apos;s shots with things like Sicilian capers, eggplant, shrimp, boiled eggs and, of course, hot dogs and french fries. With all those options, you could almost recreate <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150218013930/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/12/taste_testing_pizza_huts_chinese_to.php">the most epic pizza of our time</a>.</p>
