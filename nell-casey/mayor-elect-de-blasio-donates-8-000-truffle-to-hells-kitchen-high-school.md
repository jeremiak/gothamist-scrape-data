<p>Mayor elect Bill de Blasio hasn&apos;t even been inaugurated yet and already the perks have come flooding in, most notably an $8,000 Alba truffle an &quot;anonymous fan&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131118061716/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/de-blasio-admirer-buys-8k-truffle-nyc-mayor-elect-article-1.1513604">bought at a charity auction</a> as a gift to the recently elected politico. De Blasio&apos;s Italian-American heritage, which has attracted <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131118061716/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/15/nyregion/his-roots-in-italy-de-blasio-now-has-fans-there.html?_r=0">fans in the land of his ancestors</a>, prompted the generous truffle-lover to give the soon-to-be mayor a taste of his home country. Unfortunately, the price limit for gifts for public officials is $50&#x2014;so what happened to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131118061716/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/14/truffles.php">funky fungi</a>?</p>

<p>That&apos;s a question for the lucky students at the Food and Finance High School (yes, that&apos;s a real school), who were the recipients of the prized foodstuff yesterday. &#x201C;I was really overwhelmed,&#x201D; principal Roger Turgeon <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131118061716/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/de-blasio-donates-8g-italian-truffle-school-article-1.1518047#ixzz2kk4E39hw">told the Daily News</a>. &#x201C;Being offered a white truffle is not an everyday event.&#x201D; Teachers at the school plan to serve the truffle at a meal for the school&apos;s 480 students and staff members on Tuesday. Teenagers aren&apos;t known for their discerning palates, but at least one 16-year-old student from Queens is keeping an open mind: &quot;I usually don&#x2019;t like mushroom, but I would try it.&quot; You&apos;re way ahead of some adults we know, Jamila Mills. </p>
