<p>McDonald&apos;s has awakened from its p.r. stupor and killed its hilariously tone-deaf employee resources website, which had been widely lambasted for doling out head-scratching advice to employees. It was fun while it lasted, guys! The chain finally (<em>finally</em>) wised up and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507233735/http://www.foxnews.com/health/2013/12/26/mcdonald-shuts-down-employee-site-following-postings-that-told-workers-to-avoid/">shut down the site</a> after a posting this week <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507233735/http://www.nbcnews.com/business/mcdonalds-employee-site-bashes-fast-food-2D11792135">cautioning workers against a fast food diet</a> went viral. </p>

<p>&quot;A combination of factors has led us to re-evaluate, and we&apos;ve directed the vendor to take down the website,&quot; explained McDonald&apos;s spokeswoman Lisa McComb in a statement. &quot;Between links to irrelevant or outdated information, along with outside groups taking elements out of context, this created unwarranted scrutiny and inappropriate commentary.&quot; </p>

<p>Trouble began this summer when the McResources website provided a sample budget that clearly illustrated workers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507233735/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/16/mcdonalds_helpfully_illustrates_tha.php">can&apos;t survive on a McDonald&apos;s salary</a>. The fun continued in November when the site advised employees to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507233735/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/19/mcdonalds_continues_tone_deaf_emplo.php">sell their unopened Christmas gifts</a> to bring in extra cash. The chain had whined earlier this fall that their well-meaning advice was just <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507233735/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/24/mcdonalds_says_clueless_mcresource.php">taken out of context</a> and twisted to fit an anti-McDonald&apos;s agenda. </p>

<p>A visit to the resources website <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507233735/http://www.cnn.com/2013/12/25/living/mcdonalds-employee-site/">reveals a message</a> about maintenance and upgrades and says it will be &quot;back soon!&quot; In the meantime, the chain will keep its phone-based resource line active so employees can <strike>negotiate better pay</strike> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507233735/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/24/mcdonalds_advice_to_underpaid_worke.php">get information about food stamps</a>. </p>
