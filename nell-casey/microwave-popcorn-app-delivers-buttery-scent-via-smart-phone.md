<p>Evil geniuses have found a way to harness the delicious scent of microwaved popcorn and deliver it to your nose via your smart phone. The butter bringers at PopSecret unleashed the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140227101300/http://popsecret.com/poptopia/#popdongle">PopDongle</a>, an iPhone attachment connected to their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140227101300/https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/poptopia-by-pop-secret/id688491722?ls=1&amp;mt=8">Poptopia</a> app, a game that seemingly revolves around shooting popped kernels into a giant digital mouth. The more you play the game, the more <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140227101300/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/08/woman_sues_over_popcorn_lung.php">biacetyl-scented</a> odor spews from the attachment, teasing your nostrils with delicious buttery scent. </p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="120913popcorn1.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20140227101300im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_nellcasey/120913popcorn1.jpg" width="640" height="480"> <br> <i> <span class="photo_caption">The happiest little trans fat molecules in the world!</span></i></div> <p></p>

<p>Popcorn-minded folks can procure the app for free on iTunes but that little knob of olfactory butter substitute won&apos;t come cheap. Interested parties can bid on the accessory  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140227101300/http://www.ebay.com/itm/-/221330298315">on ebay</a>, with the current bidding price hovering at $150. Bidding for the doohickey ends December 13th, with 100% of the final sale price benefitting the American Red Cross; not the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140227101300/http://gothamist.com/2012/08/13/microwave_popcorn_butter_flavor_has.php">Alzheimer&apos;s Foundation</a>? </p>

<p>Or you could just, ya know, pop a bag of popcorn. </p>
