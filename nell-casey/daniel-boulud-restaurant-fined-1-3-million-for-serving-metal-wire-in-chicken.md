<p>Celebrated chef Daniel Boulud&apos;s restaurant db Bistro Moderne has been ordered to pay $1.3 million to a diner who nearly died after eating a metal wire in his dinner. Yesterday, a Manhattan jury passed down the pricey judgement, awarding victim Barry Brett $300,000 plus an addition $1 million as a &quot;warning&quot; to the restaurant and other eateries to prevent the situation from happening again, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161031192348/http://nypost.com/2016/10/27/celeb-chef-hit-with-1-3m-fine-for-serving-metal-wire-in-dinner/">the Post reports</a>.</p>

<p>In February of last year, Brett was dining at the Midtown restaurant when he swallowed a metal bristle that had come from a wire cleaning brush. The brush had been purchased at a local hardware store and not from a restaurant supplier. </p>

<p>Executive chef Kendall Linhart, who was present when the incident occurred, said he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161031192348/http://nypost.com/2016/10/25/celeb-chef-says-he-has-no-idea-how-metal-wire-ended-up-in-chicken-dish/">had no explanation</a> as to how the wire ended up in Brett&apos;s Coq au Vin. &quot;You can&#x2019;t always see objects in the food,&quot; Linhart testified.</p>

<p>The restaurant&apos;s attorney says they plan to fight the verdict, saying that Brett shouldn&apos;t have waited several days before going to the hospital.</p>

<p>Let this serve as an off-season reminder that you should <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161031192348/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/05/bbq_tip_how_to_avoid_getting_a_meta.php">never ever <em>ever</em></a> use a metal wire brush to clean a grill. </p>
