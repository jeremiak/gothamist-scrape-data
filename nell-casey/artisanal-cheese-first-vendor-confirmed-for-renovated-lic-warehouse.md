<p>The waterfront neighborhood of Long Island City may very well be a breakout star in the search for next hot &apos;hood for foodies. Earlier this year the nabe got a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509140005/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/13/outdoor_lic_flea_food_market_begins_1.php">new outdoor flea and food market</a> and now news comes through the wire that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509140005/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/04/the_best_cheese_shops_in_nyc.php">Artisanal Cheese</a> will open a second NYC location inside the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509140005/http://www.falchibuilding.com/#/">Falchi Building</a> on 47th Avenue in Queens. </p>

<p>While its predecessor on Park Avenue has more of a restaurant focus, the new Artisanal Cheese space will be dedicated to selling a wide variety of artisanal (duh) and farmstead fromage. They&apos;ll also have cheese aging caves on site, as well as production facilities and offices. </p>

<p>Artisanal is the first confirmed tenant for the refurbished warehouse, which was built in 1922 and formerly served as a distribution facility for Gimbels department store until the retail giant <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509140005/http://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/19/nyregion/thecity/19gimb.html?_r=0">closed in 1986</a>. Jamestown Properties, which purchased the space last year, touts the building as a &quot;lower cost alternative to Manhattan for companies seeking large format or creative office space with distribution capabilities.&quot; The site boasts 657,660-square-feet of mixed-use space and recently underwent a multi-million dollar capital improvement program which included upgrades to the facade and lobby.</p>

<p>Contrary to a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509140005/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/queens/queens-chelsea-market-article-1.1475790">report in the Daily News</a>, a spokesperson for Jamestown insists the property will not be a new &quot;Chelsea Market East,&quot; though the company does also operate the popular mixed-use market-and-office space in Manhattan. Jamestown hasn&apos;t yet released details about other tenants for the Falchi Building but plans to have information available in the near future.</p>
