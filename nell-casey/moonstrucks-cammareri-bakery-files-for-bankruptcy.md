<p>&quot;What is life? They say bread is life.&quot; And for one longstanding Brooklyn bakery, that life may be coming to an end. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160329080330/http://www.cammareribrothers.com/">Cammareri Bakery</a>, whose fiery oven provided a plot setting for Cher and Nic Cage&apos;s 1987 film <em>Moonstruck</em>, has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160329080330/http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20131022/RETAIL_APPAREL/131029982">Crains reports</a> that the company &quot;owes money to fewer than 50 creditors,&quot; with assets of $126,000 and liabilities at $500,000. </p>

<p>The bakery closed its 80-year-old  retail outlet in 1998 and then <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160329080330/http://gothamist.com/2007/01/30/mc.php">merged with Carroll Gardens&apos; Monteleone</a>. As it stands now, Cammareri operates a wholesale bread and pastry business that services restaurants throughout New York City, in addition to a Fort Greene eatery called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160329080330/http://cammarericaffe.com/">Cammareri Caffe</a>. </p>

<p>If the bakery can&apos;t pull itself out of the fire and back on its feet, we all know who to blame.</p>
