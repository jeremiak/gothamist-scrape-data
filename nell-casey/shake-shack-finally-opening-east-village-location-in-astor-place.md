<p>Brace yourself, East Village, because we&apos;ve got a new Shake Shack alert! Looks like the Shack is going to be arriving in Astor Place this summer. Remember when there were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170616160825/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/09/starbucks_ubiquitous.php">three Starbucks</a> in Astor Place? Just saying there are an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170616160825/http://gothamist.com/tags/shakeshack/">awful lot of Shake Shacks now</a> and there&apos;s a precedent. </p>

<p>This is refreshing new territory for Shake Shack, which operates a serious dearth of burger joints in this part of Manhattan. Between the Battery and 23rd Street there are just <em>two</em> Shake Shacks: the Madison Square Park original and the one in the Fulton Center. Danny Meyer&apos;s just giving the people what they want: the opportunity to avoid the Chop&#x2019;t also operating at 51 Astor Place in favor of cheese fries and a concrete. #Hero</p>

<p>Expect some &quot;cool features&quot; at this location, a spokesperson told Gothamist in confirming the new location, which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170616160825/https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20170525/east-village/shake-shack-opening-east-village-astor-place-fall">DNAinfo reports</a> has a 15-year lease.</p>
