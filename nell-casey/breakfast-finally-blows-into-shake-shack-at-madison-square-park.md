<p>Shake Shack&apos;s original location in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170616011419/https://www.shakeshack.com/location/madison-square-park/">Madison Square Park</a> is the site of the burger chain&apos;s latest breakfast debut, the first time a location outside of a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170616011419/http://gothamist.com/2014/12/09/shake_shack_breakfast_gct.php">transit hub</a> will serve BECs&#x2014;unless you believe those <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170616011419/http://www.nyctastes.com/2013/06/shack-shake-breakfast.html">long ago rumors</a>. The Shack announced that beginning Monday, May 22nd, the 23rd Street stand will offer breakfast daily beginning at 7:30 a.m. on the weekdays and 8:30 a.m. on the weekends, until 10:30 a.m. </p>

<p>Anchoring the menu are the breakfast sandwiches that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170616011419/http://gothamist.com/2014/05/04/airport_tip_theres_a_breakfast_sand.php">first debuted</a> at JFK. The Sausage, Egg N&apos; Cheese ($4.79), Bacon, Egg N&apos; Cheese ($4.79) and Egg N&apos; Cheese ($3.79) all come with American cheese on a toasted potato bun and are the most burger-like options in the morning.</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="051517shack2.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170616011419im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_nellcasey/051517shack2.jpg" width="640" height="427"> <br> <i> Coffee Cake (Evan Sung)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>Unique to this location: a Seasonal Coffee Cake from Danny Meyer&apos;s latest, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170616011419/http://www.ushgnyc.com/location/daily-provisions/">Daily Provisions</a>, an all-day cafe near Union Square. Chefs at Daily Provisions prepare the sour cream coffee cake with oat and cornmeal crumble&#x2014;and, for now, strawberries&#x2014;each morning in small batches, which will make their way over to Madison Square Park. There will also be Shack Apple Turnovers ($3.49), a partnership with Four &amp; Twenty Blackbirds.</p>

<p>All those calories first thing require some caffeine to ward off desk naps. They&apos;ll offer Stumptown Coffee Roasters brews in drip and cold brew form (make it a Float with a scoop of vanilla custard for $5.79) and the coffee will be free with any breakfast purchase on opening day through May 28th. </p>
