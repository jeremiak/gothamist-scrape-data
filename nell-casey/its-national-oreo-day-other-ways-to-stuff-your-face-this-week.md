<p>Because <strong>National Oreo Day</strong> is a thing, perhaps you&apos;ll want to pick up a pack from your local bodega. Or you can head to Midtown West today, where <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170308225122/http://www.thewayfarernyc.com/">The Wayfarer</a> kitchen will offer you their own house-made version instead. But if flapjacks are more to your taste, get ready for <strong>National Pancake Day</strong> on Tuesday with the Brooklyn Heights outpost of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170308225122/http://friendofafarmer.com/brooklyn.html">Friend of a Farmer</a>. For lunch, they&apos;re offering pancake creations like Old Fashion Pumpkin Pancakes with toasted walnuts ($14) and Weston&#x2019;s Blueberry Buttermilk Pancakes ($15) beginning at 11:30 a.m.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, donate your money and your stomach at <strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170308225122/http://www.hungrymktg.com/brooklyn-feeds/">Brooklyn Feeds</a></strong>, a fundraiser for CHiPs and Neighbors Together, working towards fighting food insecurity and hunger in the borough. Over 20 restaurants will be donating a portion of the day&apos;s earnings, including Franny&apos;s, Chip Shop, Taco Dumbo and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170308225122/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/19/ode_to_applebees.php">my beloved Applebee&apos;s</a>.</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="030617kickshaw.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170308225122im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_nellcasey/030617kickshaw.jpg" width="640" height="479"> <br> <i> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170308225122/https://www.facebook.com/thequeenskickshaw/photos/a.177630532257665.34475.173880455966006/1347477031939670/?type=3&amp;theater">Facebook</a>)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>All month, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170308225122/http://thequeenskickshaw.com/">The Queens Kickshaw</a> will be <strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170308225122/http://thequeenskickshaw.com/womensmarch">honoring International Women&apos;s Day</a></strong> with a series of fundraising events at their Astoria restaurant. On Wednesdays, they&apos;ll dedicate the sales from a selected draft line, donate 25% of all the bar sales, and on Thursdays they&apos;ll have female DJs in house. This Wednesday, they&apos;re also a stop on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170308225122/https://www.facebook.com/AstoriaMarch/">Astoria March</a>, a crawl of female-owned businesses in the area, and they&apos;ll be serving a special cocktail and beer for the evening. </p>

<p>Many will be eschewing meat during Lent, so allow some local restaurants to pick up the protein slack with special fish-centered Friday night meals. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170308225122/https://delfriscos.com/steakhouse/new-york">Del Frisco&#x2019;s Double Eagle Steak House New York</a> is doing a five-course feast this Friday ($150 plus tax and gratuity) at 7:30 p.m. with dishes like Achiote Charred Octopus, Alaskan King Crab and Bone-in Swordfish with charred tomato jus, salsa verde and marianted jicama. For dessert: Nutella Bread Pudding, because a little sin isn&apos;t a bad thing.</p>
