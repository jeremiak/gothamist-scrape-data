</div></div>					<p>Another comfort food eatery inspired by regional American fare was bestowed upon us last week when <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426154547/http://www.bleeckerkitchen.com/">Bleecker Kitchen &amp; Co.</a> opened on the bustling stretch of Broadway just north of Houston. The restaurant took over the coveted corner at Bleecker Street when The Corner Shop/<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426154547/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/01/inside_the_vault_at_pfaffs_the_19th.php#photo-1">The Vault At Pfaffs</a> bit the dust <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426154547/http://ny.eater.com/archives/2013/05/the_shutter_309.php">earlier this year</a>; NYC students and tourists who stopped by for the homey eats won&apos;t be disappointed with the new restaurant, which offers down-home fare similar to its predecessor.</p>

<p>Chef Steven Ferdinand, who most recently cooked at gut-busting UWS joint <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426154547/http://gothamist.com/2012/08/15/heres_sugar_and_plumm_a_new_place_t.php">Sugar &amp; Plumm</a>, offers a menu of small and large plates including dishes taken from kitchens across the country. As with so many comfort food spots, there&apos;s a heavy reliance on Southern fare like Shrimp &amp; Grits ($11), BBQ Pork Buns ($5) and Crispy Chicken &amp; Waffles ($16). We take a brief sojourn up to New England with a Maine Lobster Roll, which would alarm anyone from Vacationland with its $24 price tag. Pan Roasted Chicken Breast ($21), a 10 ounce NY Strip ($29) and the more budget-friendly Bleecker Burger ($14) round out the hearty menu.</p>

<p>There are 60 seats at which to perch, including the white tiled bar that boasts a mural constructed from a vintage basketball court. Cocktails ($13) riff on classics, like the Cacao Manhattan with cynar amaro and cacao; New York Sour made with bourbon, lemon juice, sugar and mulled wine; and the Concord Mule with vodka, Meyer lemon, grapes, ginger and thyme. Beers are priced a little higher than average; you can get a $7 Brooklyn Lager and, inexplicably, Original Sin Apple Cider for $8. They&apos;re also doing alcoholic coffee beverages, which will come in handy when they launch brunch on the weekends.</p>
