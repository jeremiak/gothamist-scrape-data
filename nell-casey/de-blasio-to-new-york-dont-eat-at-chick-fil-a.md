<p>Chick-fil-A got <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016145814/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/04/bad_chicken_protesters_picket_outsi.php">plenty of pushback</a> when it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016145814/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/01/inside_chickfila_nyc.php">dipped its toes</a> in the New York City market, but despite the opposition, the chicken chain has had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016145814/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/03/the_chick-fil-a_first_100_sleep_ove.php">no problem</a> attracting diners, and their plans for local domination are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016145814/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/12/chick-fil-a_everywhere.php">in full swing</a>. In fact, plans to open the chain&apos;s first Queens location are underway, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016145814/https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20160504/elmhurst/chick-fil-a-boycott-planned-for-new-queens-location-officials-say">DNAinfo reports</a> that city politicians are speaking out against the chain, notably Mayor de Blasio, who thinks <em>real</em> New Yorkers should steer clear of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016145814/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/02/chick-fil-as_charitable_foundation.php">bigoted</a> chain.</p>

<p>&quot;What the ownership of Chick-fil-A has said is wrong,&quot; the mayor said at a press conference last night. &quot;I&apos;m certainly not going to patronize them and I wouldn&apos;t urge any other New Yorker to patronize them. But they do have a legal right.&quot; </p>

<p>The mayor was joined in sentiment by City Councilman Daniel Dromm, who represents the Elmhurst neighborhood where the new restaurant will open this fall. &quot;This group imparts a strong anti-LGBT message by forcing their employees and volunteers to adhere to a policy that prohibits same-sex love,&quot; the councilman said in a statement. &quot;It is outrageous that Chick-fil-A is quietly spreading its message of hate by funding these types of organizations.&quot;</p>

<p>During his tenure as mayor, Michael Bloomberg said he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016145814/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/27/bloomberg_says_chick-fil-a_ban_not.php">wouldn&apos;t try to ban Chick-fil-A</a> from NYC, because it was a question of free speech. &quot;You can&apos;t have a test for what the owners&apos; personal views are before you decide to give a permit to do something in the city,&quot; he said. &quot;You really don&apos;t want to ask political beliefs or religious beliefs before you issue a permit, that&apos;s just not government&apos;s job.&quot; Regulating the beverage consumption of your citizens though? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016145814/http://gothamist.com/2014/10/16/de_blasio_soda_ban.php">Totally fair game</a>. </p>
