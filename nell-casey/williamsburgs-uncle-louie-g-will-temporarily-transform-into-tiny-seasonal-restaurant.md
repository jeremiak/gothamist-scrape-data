<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021194646/http://humboldtandjackson.com/">Humboldt &amp; Jackson</a> isn&apos;t a typical restaurant. The space regularly hosts outside restaurants <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021194646/http://gothamist.com/2015/11/09/robertas_square_pizza_pop-up.php#photo-1">trying out new concepts</a> or gives street and market vendors a temporary roof and a new audience to showcase their foods. And this winter, they&apos;ll be doing much of the same but on a much smaller stage when they take over the Graham Avenue location of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021194646/http://unclelouiegee.com/">Uncle Louie G</a>, the ice cream and Italian ice purveyor with locations all over New York.</p>

<p>By phone this morning, Events Manager Bill Reed revealed the H&amp;J; team will be taking over the ice cream shop beginning the weekend after Thanksgiving. On Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays, the space will serve a more set menu of favorites from the mothership a few blocks away, including house-made pickles and their Beer Mac &amp; Cheese, which they&apos;ll be slapping between slices of Texas toast with the voluntary inclusion of bacon. </p>

<p>As has been their ethos since day one, they&apos;ll also be partnering with other local business, including some hot dog collaborations with Brooklyn Hot Dog Company and Yeah Dawg, who make vegan hot dogs. They&apos;re promising lots of vegetarian options, including a vegan chili they&apos;ll use on the vegan hot dog offering.</p>

<p>On Sundays, they&apos;ll have a rotating cast of chefs, restaurants and other food businesses taking over the kitchen entirely. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021194646/https://www.facebook.com/RangoonNoodleLab/?fref=ts">Rangoon NoodleLab</a>&#x2014;who&apos;ll be popping up at the original space <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021194646/http://humboldtandjackson.com/hj-event/rangoon-noodlelab-burmese-noodle-kitchen-takeover-2-2/">this weekend</a>&#x2014;will have a weekend serving Burmese noodles. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021194646/http://www.sweetchilinyc.com/">Sweet Chili</a> food truck will also be swinging by, as will a DJ Dallas Green&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021194646/http://www.madefromscratchgourmet.com/about">Made From Scratch Company</a>. Even showy <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021194646/http://gothamist.com/tags/blacktap">Black Tap</a> will be bringing burgers and their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021194646/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/27/black_tap_milkshake_insanity.php">ridiculous milk shakes</a> to the space.</p>

<p>Don&apos;t worry about ole Louie G, though, as the tiny shop&apos;s five most popular ice cream flavors will still be available during the off-season, in addition to things like a Mast Brothers hot cocoa collaboration and another with Red Jacket Orchards. There&apos;s no booze, but Reed hopes they&apos;ll be a destination for local bar hoppers after other nearby food options have shuttered for the evening, and they&apos;ll also offer a free beer taste at the proper restaurant with a receipt from the pop-up.</p>

<p>When they debut in late November, they&apos;ll have made room for about 12 people to sit and eat with more room for standing. They&apos;ll open at 6 p.m. to catch people leaving from work and close at 1 a.m. (midnight on Sundays), just before things get sloppy.</p>
