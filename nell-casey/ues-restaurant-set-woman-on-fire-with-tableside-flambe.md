<p>A fancy Upper East Side Italian eatery has been named in a lawsuit filed by a mother and daughter who were victims of a tableside flamb&#xE9; presentation gone terribly wrong. According to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160507204933/http://pospislaw.com/2016/01/01/flambe-burn-lawsuit-against-bocca-east-restaurant/">lawsuit</a> filed just before the new year, plaintiffs Judith Katz and daughter Laura Katz were dining at Bocca East in November of 2013 when Laura was &quot;dowsed [sic] in flames, lit on fire, engulfed in flames and severely burned by...employees who were in the process of flamb&#xE9;eing a dish in the crowded dining room.&quot; </p>

<p>Laura was burned on her &quot;head, neck, face, lips, hand, hair and ears;&quot; her mother was also injured trying to extinguish her daughter, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160507204933/http://nypost.com/2016/01/03/mom-daughter-burned-in-flambe-accident-at-ues-restaurant/">according to the Post</a>. </p>

<p>Bocca East owner Thomas Vita Bifulco and partner Tarek Alam are named in the suit, which seeks unspecified damages for the injuries, &quot;shock, fright and emotional distress&quot; and &quot;wanton disregard for the life, health and safety.&quot; The restaurant is under new ownership as of six months ago. </p>

<p>The lawsuit doesn&apos;t specify what dish caused the incident&#x2014;and there is no longer a flamb&#xE9; presentation listed on the menu&#x2014;but there&apos;s a least one other record of the incident. &quot;this is the worst place in the wolrd [sic]!!!!! the food is horrible. the service is terrible. i watched someones hair catch on fire. an ambulance had to come and take them away. it was due to negligence on their part,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160507204933/http://www.yelp.com/biz/bocca-east-new-york?q=ambulance">one Yelper wrote</a>. &quot;i personally signed up for yelp today just to be able to tell other people not to ever go.&quot; The restaurant can now also be blamed for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160507204933/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/15/south_park_yelp_video.php">creating another Yelper</a>. </p>
