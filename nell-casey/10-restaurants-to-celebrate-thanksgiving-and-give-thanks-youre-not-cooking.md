<p>Cooking an elaborate holiday meal means stress, buying a million ingredients and washing dishes; lots and lots and lots of dishes. Give your mind and sink a break this year and let someone else&#x2014;and, let&apos;s be frank, someone more capable&#x2014;handle all the muss and fuss. Here are a few spots to spend this Thanksgiving, from the $135 prix fixe blowouts to the humble but equally flavorful a la carte eateries.</p>

<p><strong>$75 AND OVER</strong></p>

<p><strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131117054810/http://www.thenomadhotel.com/#!/dining">The NoMad</a></strong> We&apos;re big fans of this next-level hotel restaurant, even though scoring a meal might mean <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131117054810/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/30/the_best_places_to_splurge_in_nyc.php">not paying your rent</a>.

They&apos;re offering a $135 ($65 for the kiddos) meal with dishes like Foie Gras with pear, licorice and red wine; white truffle and parmesan risotto; bone marrow encrusted beef; and, best of all, their decadent, lust-worthy Chicken with Black Truffle, Brioche and Foie Gras Stuffing. Oh, and turkey. <em>1170 Broadway; reservations (347) 472-5660. Seatings from noon to 9 p.m.</em></p>

<p><strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131117054810/http://www.themarrownyc.com/">The Marrow</a></strong> <em>Top Chef</em> alum Harold Dieterle opened this, his second restaurant, earlier this year and though the menu skews German-Italian, that hasn&apos;t stopped the chef from offering the restaurant&apos;s first foray into Thanksgiving fare. The $65 prix fixe takes diners through three courses, starting with your choice of Ribollita Soup, Duck-broccoli sausage rigatoni or namesake The Bone Marrow, with sea urchin, fried potatoes and meyer lemon aioli plus three other choices. You&apos;ll have a choice of six entrees as well, including a Roasted Local Turkey with pretzel stuffing, Pan-Fried Duck Schnitzel or a Roasted Whole Hen of the Woods Mushroom.

<p><strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131117054810/http://www.pippalinyc.com/">Pippali</a></strong> This recently-opened Indian restaurant from Tamarind Tribeca alum Peter Beck offers the rare a la carte Thanksgiving feast for curry fanatics. You&apos;ll find turkey on the menu, of course, but dressed up in a very different kind of gravy. Start with Turkey Pantra ($9): sliced turkey sauteed with curry leaves, ginger, garlic and coconut in a rice crepe with orange and horseradish chutney; or Turkey Sikandri Kabab, which sees the bird marinated in spices and grilled tandoori-style with a cranberry chutney. Masala Kotfa ($15), or spiced turkey meatballs, and Dum Pukht ($17), roasted turkey in a yogurt marinade stand in for the traditional bird. Finish the meal with Sultani ($9), a bread pudding with dried fruits that&apos;s glazed with a rum and apricot syrup. <em>129 East 27th Street; reservations call (212) 689-1999.

<p><strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131117054810/http://www.joneswoodfoundry.com/">Jones Wood Foundry</a></strong> Though centered on cuisine from our friends across the pond, this Upper East Side eatery co-opts the most American of holiday&apos;s this year, with a three course, prix fixe menu for $39. The meal starts out with the English-America fusion butternut squash ravioli with split pea and smoked ham hock before continuing in a more traditional direction with a roast turkey and &quot;all the trimmings.&quot; Finish up with a slice of pumpkin pie, as tradition dictates, then throw back a few pints; our forefather&apos;s would want it that way. If you want to pass of their home cooking as your own, the Foundry also offers the meal to-go: all the same dishes at $25 per person with a $100 minimum. <em>401 East 76th Street; call (212) 249-2700 for reservations and take out info.

Entrees include the requisite turkey with trimmings, wild salmon wellington or a filet mignon. You can also swap in the restaurant&apos;s iconic Lobster Newberg for just an extra $12.
