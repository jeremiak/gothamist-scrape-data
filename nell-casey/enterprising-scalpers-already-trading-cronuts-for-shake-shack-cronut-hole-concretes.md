<p>Yeah so this is happening. Tipster and Cronut aficionado Vernon B. emailed the above photo of an apparent Cronut-For-Cronut-Hole-Concrete trade that went town in this morning&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508161206/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/17/post_164.php">Shake Shack shitshow</a>. &quot;Basically this one guy was on line and he&apos;s like, &apos;Who wants to do an exchange? I&apos;ve got an extra Cronut,&apos;&quot; Vernon recalls. &quot;This one woman just literally jumped and was like, &apos;I&apos;ll take it!&apos;&quot; Gotta get on those hot deals FAST! </p>

<p>By the looks of things, the Cronut line was practically a ghost town this morning, a fact which our shrewd scalper was no doubt aware.</p>

Happy Tuesday. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508161206/https://twitter.com/search?q=%23cronut&amp;src=hash">#cronut</a></p>&#x2014; Kathleen Purvis (@kathleenpurvis) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508161206/https://twitter.com/kathleenpurvis/statuses/379939545300877312">September 17, 2013</a></blockquote>

<p>Vernon&#x2014;who&apos;d been on line since about 9 a.m. and got his Concrete in about an hour and 40 minutes&#x2014;revealed he&apos;s &quot;had [the Cronut] since June&quot; and &quot;usually goes once a month.&quot; As an expert, which line was worse? </p>

<blockquote> I&apos;d have to say the Concrete, but if this was in the summer people would literally be there overnight. But it was cold this morning. I was checking <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508161206/http://gothamist.com/2006/04/18/breaking_shake.php">the camera</a> at 5 a.m. and I went back to sleep. I see people but I&apos;m like, &quot;No&#x2026;I can get there later.&quot; I was pretty sure I was gonna get one. I&apos;ve never seen a Shack Shake line this insane but it&apos;s moving pretty fast. If you got on line at 10 a.m. you were pretty sure you were gonna get one.</blockquote>

<p>So far as he saw, only one guy attempted to make a swap, but who knows what kind of back door dealings have transpired over the course of the morning. To be sure, these kinds of shady dealings <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508161206/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/15/foodie_human_centipede_cronut_meets.php">aren&apos;t unique</a> and even Vernon could be tempted to take the easy road out,  &quot;I would have made a trade in a heartbeat if someone had the Ramen Burger.&quot;</p>
