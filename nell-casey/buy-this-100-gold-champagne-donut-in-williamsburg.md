										<p>The humble doughnut can be the canvas for greatness, whether it&apos;s just <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161221021043/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/06/the_best_doughnuts_in_nyc.php">perfectly-executed</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161221021043/https://www.facebook.com/TheCinnamonSnail/photos/pb.274860809366.-2207520000.1383669268./10151816405344367/?type=3&amp;theater">bizarrely-named</a> or stuffed with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161221021043/http://gothamist.com/2011/07/10/do_or_dine_does_their_doughnuts_wit.php">luxury items like foie gras</a>. Or Cristal. Or 24-karat cold. Or both!</p>

<p>Behold the Golden Cristal Ube Donut, Williamsburg&apos;s answer to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161221021043/http://gothamist.com/2008/05/20/175_hamburger_o.php">gold leaf burger</a>. It&apos;s not enough that dining in the borough will <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161221021043/http://gothamist.com/2014/07/17/brooklyn_fried.php">lead to an early coronary</a>; one has to flaunt their status while the EMTs begin chest compressions. </p>

In a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161221021043/http://firstwefeast.com/eat/crazy-expensive-doughnut-gold-cristal/">conversation with First We Feast</a>, Bj&#xF6;rn DelaCruz, the doughnut creator and owner of Hope Street newcomer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161221021043/http://www.manilasocialclub.com/">Manilla Social Club</a>, insists the creation isn&apos;t some kind of gimmick. &quot; I cook with [those ingredients] because I think they taste good,&quot; he says. &quot;For what I wanted to do, Cristal was the perfect match. To me, I think this tastes really amazing. It&#x2019;s not just about the shock value, it&#x2019;s a combination of it all.&quot; That combination includes the &quot;honey&quot; notes of Cristal complementing the ube, purple yam, which is the base of the doughnut.
<br><br>
The golden champagne donut began as a one-off, part of the Filipino restaurant&apos;s Friday donut program, but it&apos;s likely to stick around given its popularity. &quot;I didn&apos;t know people would go and order a dozen [of these] at a time!&quot; he reveals. &quot;But then again, it is New York, and there are people willing to put down a grand for a dozen doughnuts.&quot; Just a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161221021043/http://gothamist.com/2014/12/08/worlds_largest_truffle.php">drop in the bucket</a>.
<br><br>
Reached by phone today, Samuel DelaCruz&#x2014;Bj&#xF6;rn&apos;s brother and co-owner of the restaurant along with their sister&#x2014;confirmed that people have been ordering the donuts by the dozen. After the donut took off on social media, they&apos;ve received numerous requests for a dozen donuts, which they&apos;ll sell at a reduced price of 12 for $1,000. A member of the family&#x2014;or at the very least someone closely involved with the restaurant&amp;mdahs;will even hand-deliver your feast if you live in the tri-state area.
