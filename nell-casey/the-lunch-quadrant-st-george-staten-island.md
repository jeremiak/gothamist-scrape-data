Last week we <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130729120458/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/19/the_lunch_quadrant_wall_street_and.php#photo-1">went to Wall Street</a> and now we&apos;re taking it nautical with a quick ferry trip across the narrows to Staten Island. The Forgotten Borough doesn&apos;t always <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130729120458/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/31/si_sex_scandal.php">get</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130729120458/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/10/four_charged_with_hate_crime_in_sta.php">the</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130729120458/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/01/baby_crawls_into_traffic_because_mo.php">best</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130729120458/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/29/si_man_smears_burning_poop_on_his_b.php">press</a> but that doesn&apos;t mean you can&apos;t find a delicious lunch! St. George, right off the ferry or the SIR, has lots of tasty eats (and great views). Got love for Shaolin? Give us your picks in the comments!</em></p>
