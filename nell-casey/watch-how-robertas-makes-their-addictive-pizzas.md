<p>Bushwick destination pizza spot <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150530210656/http://www.robertaspizza.com/">Roberta&apos;s</a> draws big crowds for its <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150530210656/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/18/the_best_pizza_in_nyc.php">deliciously inventive pies</a>, which they make on average 750 times a day. That&apos;s just one of the things we learned from their latest video, which takes us behind the scenes of their pizza creation from dough to cheese to table. </p>

<p>The team dubs the dough paramount in making their pies successful, specifically the method by which the dough is mixed and proofed. The team also makes their mozzarella in-house, explaining that &quot;there&apos;s nothing like the mozzarella that&apos;s made hours ago.&quot; Then it&apos;s a matter of balancing the moisture content and making sure the pies don&apos;t get incinerated in the 900 - 1,000 degree oven.</p>

<p>&quot;Everyone knows perfection is impossible to attain,&quot; muses Roberta&apos;s President and Co-Founder Chris Parachini. &quot;But good things come from the pursuit of it.&quot;</p>

<p>Learn all the things you want from the five minute vid or just watch for the pizza porn. No judgements. </p>
