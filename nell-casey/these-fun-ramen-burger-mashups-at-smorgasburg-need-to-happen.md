</div></div>					<p>It may not have reached the same overhyped pinnacle as the Cronut, but for my taste buds, the Ramen Burger was definitely the more exciting food &quot;sensation&quot; of 2013. Creator Keizo Shimamoto has continued to expand upon his initial idea, first creating a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509140845/http://gothamist.com/2013/12/01/photos_inside_the_new_indoor_smorga.php#photo-5">Beef Chashu Ramen Burger</a>&#x2014;a kind of marinated shredded beef&#x2014;and this weekend he had some fun with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509140845/http://gothamist.com/2013/12/01/photos_inside_the_new_indoor_smorga.php#photo-1">fellow Smorgasburg vendors</a>, creating some even more tantalizing sandwiches between two noodle buns.</p>

<p>Yesterday <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509140845/http://www.goramen.com/2014/01/mashups.html">on his blog</a>, Shimamoto revealed three ramen-y sammies he made with two other Smorgasburg staples. First up, a pork belly filling from Filipino-inspired <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509140845/http://adoboshack.com/">Adobo Shack</a>, made with heritage breed pork braised in a soy sauce/vinegar mixture. Next, a little barbecue interpretation from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509140845/http://www.lonestarempirenyc.com/">Lonestar Empire</a>, with moist brisket, pickles and a tangy sauce. </p>

<p>Shimamoto also produced his own gluttonous breakfast version oozing with cheese, runny egg and sausage links. Looks like just the thing to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509140845/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/01/the_best_hangover_foods_in_nyc.php">cure a Saturday/Sunday morning hangover</a>.
