<p>We all bemoan the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508223741/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/17/chain_reaction_chains_keep_coming_t.php">chain store onslaught</a> for destroying the unique character of NYC, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508223741/http://redfame.com/journal/index.php/ijsss/article/view/200/177">a recent study</a> reveals that while they may be bland, chain establishments can actually provide a better sense of community than their locally-owned counterparts. Anthropologists from the University of West Virginia studied three local Boston coffee shops and three Starbucks outlets in an attempt to determine which type of store offered a better social environment. The team used five criteria for their study, including how welcoming the store was, available amenities and the general atmosphere. Their somewhat surprising conclusion: in almost all areas, Starbucks beat out the independent coffee shops.  </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508223741/http://redfame.com/journal/index.php/ijsss/article/view/200/177">The study notes</a> that &quot;baristas and staff at independent cafes were not as friendly as those at Starbucks.&quot; Staffers at the chain knew regulars by name and anticipated their orders; at the independent shops, baristas were &quot;more aloof&quot; and didn&apos;t assist customers as much as their green-clad counterparts. Additionally, Starbucks offered more in the way of amenities, including ample and conveniently-arranged seating options, plus availability of power sources and free Wi-Fi. As we know, independent coffee shops in the city can be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508223741/http://gothamist.com/2008/11/29/coffeeshop_charging_for_use_of_its.php">more conservative</a> with their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508223741/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/21/one_drink_for_one_hour_of_free_wi-f.php">amenities</a>.</p>

<p>Shades of grey exist within these types of studies&#x2014;nobody would deny that sometimes Starbucks <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508223741/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/16/deaf_starbucks_customers_accuse_emp.php">isn&apos;t the most welcoming place</a>. Then again, we&apos;ve all been on the receiving end of a condescending stare from an all-knowing bearded barista. Plus it makes sense that Starbucks offers increased amenities considering the money at their disposal; locally-owned shops don&apos;t have the corporate dollars to underwrite your Netflix obsession. It really comes down to what&apos;s more important to you: cheerful service in a well-stocked but sterile environment? Or an offbeat vibe but with indifferent service and rules about your laptop? Or maybe it&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508223741/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/05/taste_test_starbucks_new_caramel_ri.php">all about the product</a>.</p>
