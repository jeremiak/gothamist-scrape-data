<p>Dumbo has been a hotspot for mobile food vendors since the big movement began, seeing as many as five trucks set up in the tiny &apos;hood to serve lunch to the many office buildings. Now <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130527061729/http://newyorkstreetfood.com/41318/new-food-truck-lot-coming-to-dumbo/">New York Street Food gave word</a> that the owners of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130527061729/https://twitter.com/biandangnyc">Bian Dang</a> truck, which dishes out delicious Taiwanese food, has signed a lease to occupy the tiny lot on the corner of Jay and Water Streets that&apos;s often filled with livery cars. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130527061729/http://dumbonyc.com/2013/04/19/food-truck-coop-leases-lot-in-dumbo-at-jay-and-water-streets/">DumboNYC spoke to the truck owners</a> who said that while they liked the area, police had been &quot;shooing [them] away,&quot; prompting them to seek a solution. The lot should fit about four trucks and will operate weekly from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. with the possibility of a nighttime residence if the neighborhood calls for it. Bian Dang will be joined by a rotating lineup that includes <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130527061729/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/24/these_japanese_nacho_tots_are.php">addictive Japanese Nacho Tots</a> from Domo Taco, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130527061729/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/09/cool_down_with_these_five_unique_ic.php#photo-6">ice cream cookies sandwiches</a> from Cool Haus and grilled cheese from Milk Truck, among others. The trucks could set up shop as early as next week.</p>

<p>It&apos;s great to get more food options, especially since there are a few more months to wait for the (hopefully!) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130527061729/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/19/finally_dumbo_gets_some_more_food_o.php">return of Brooklyn Flea under the archway</a>. It&apos;s also nice to see mobile vendors creating sustainable solutions for their operation, considering <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130527061729/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/18/city_council_ramps_up_restrictions.php">the battle they&apos;re getting ready to face</a>.</p>
