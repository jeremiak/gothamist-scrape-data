They&apos;re erecting a 20-foot seafood market in front of the open kitchen, which will sell all manner of sea fare from crustaceans to fresh fish. Expect oysters, mussels and clams in addition to seasonal treats like stone crabs and bay scallops. They&apos;re also installing a lobster tank so you can pick out the feistiest of the spiny fellows for your stock pot at home.</p>

<p>The market will reflect what seafood is fresh and in season, and chefs at the restaurant will follow suit, changing up the menu with the same offerings being sold for retail. The large, three-storefront space houses a restaurant and bar in addition to the retail outlet; they&apos;ll all be open seven days a week for lunch, dinner and Sunday brunch starting next month. </p>
