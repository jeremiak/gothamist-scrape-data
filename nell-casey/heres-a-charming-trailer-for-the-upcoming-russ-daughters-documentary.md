<p>The iconic Lower East Side shop Russ &amp; Daughters celebrates its 100th birthday this year, and the long pickling documentary about the legendary store released its trailer. Julie Cohen&apos;s film <em><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150604092343/http://thesturgeonqueens.com/">Sturgeon Queens</a></em>, which is slated for release at some point this year, explores the history of the store from its humble beginnings to the future of the Russ &amp; Daughters name, which will soon include a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150604092343/http://ny.eater.com/archives/2013/09/russ_daughters_really_is_opening_a_cafe.php">cafe outpost on Orchard Street</a>.</p>

<p>You&apos;ll hear delightful memories from Hattie and Anne, two of the three surviving Russ daughters, as well as feelings of joy and trepidation of expansion from current, fourth generation owners Niki Russ Federman and her cousin Josh Russ Tupper. Interspersed with celebrity anecdotes from Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Morley Safer are lovely photographs of the shop&apos;s early days, as well as the many faces of the Russ family behind the shop&apos;s storied counter. </p>

<p>Look out for screenings later in the spring, including a May 20th event at the JCC CineMatters festival. If you can&apos;t wait, third generation owner Mark Russ Federman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150604092343/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/01/lox_of_love.php">wrote a lovely book</a> about his family&apos;s business that also includes many a mouth-watering photo of smoked fish.
