<p>Looks like the FDA can&apos;t wait for Arrested Development&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141227064401/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/25/netflix_will_only_produce_one_seaso.php">imminent return to our TV screens</a> either. Bumble Bee Foods <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141227064401/http://www.fda.gov/Safety/Recalls/ucm342592.htm">released a chuckle-inducing recall</a> of some of their tuna products yesterday. &quot;Loose seals or seams could result in product contamination by spoilage organisms or pathogens and lead to illness if consumed.&quot; They can also cause amputation when accidentally discovered in the wild!</p>

<p>5-ounce cans of Chunk White Albacore and Chunk Light Tuna distributed between January 17th and February 28th of this year are being recalled because of inadequate seal tightness. You can tell if your can is affected by <strike>the yellow bow-tie</strike> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141227064401/http://www.fda.gov/Safety/Recalls/ucm342592.htm">checking the product codes here</a>. </p>
