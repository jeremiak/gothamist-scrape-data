</div></div>					<p>It&apos;s not uncommon to find the Gothamist HQ fridge stocked with several varieties of hummus, so we were extra excited when <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429062118/http://eatwell-enjoylife.com/">Eat Well Enjoy Life</a> delivered a startling amount of their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429062118/http://eatwell-enjoylife.com/greek-yogurt/">new low-fat hummus</a> to our office last week. We like to keep an open mind about things&#x2014;especially when it comes to free food&#x2014;but we&apos;re typically skeptical about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429062118/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/02/170-calorie_pizza_whats_the_point.php">low calorie food substitutes</a> that claim to taste as good as the real thing. But guys, we&apos;re here to tell you: this hummus is the real deal.</p>

<p>Low fat hummus typically means gritty, flavorless gruel filled with water that makes your taste buds scream <em>DIET PRODUCT</em>. Instead of completely eliminating the olive oil and tahini that give the hummus its texture and flavor, EWEL substitutes some of it for Greek yogurt (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429062118/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/24/greek_yogurt_so_hot_right_now.php">so hot right now</a>), which helps maintain that lusciously creamy and silky texture while simultaneously keeping the calories down. We sampled five flavors&#x2014;classic, roasted red pepper, roasted garlic, spicy and roasted pine nuts&#x2014;and in all of them the chickpea and sesame flavors shine through, as does a distinct tang from the yogurt. The garlic and spicy varieties were staff favorites, adding a nice punch of flavor while still maintaining that nutty base, but all five tubs were almost completely empty by the time the feeding frenzy ended.</p>

<p>Hummus in any form certainly isn&apos;t &quot;bad&quot; for you&#x2014;we&apos;re looking at you, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429062118/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/12/taste_testing_pizza_huts_chinese_to.php">freaky pizza</a>&#x2014;but it&apos;s not exactly diet-friendly when you&apos;re eating it by the tub. We&apos;re not saying EWEL&apos;s hummus will reveal your hidden six pack, but with 50 calories and 2.5 grams of fat per two tablespoon serving&#x2014;about 1/2 the fat and 1/3 fewer calories than traditional store-bought hummus&#x2014;it softens the blow of hummus overindulgence. So if you want to look svelte <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429062118/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/09/it_happened_to_me_i_wore_meggings_a.php#photo-1">in your meggings</a> by the time spring rolls around, this is certainly a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429062118/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/13/lean_cuisine_mushroom_ravioli_recal.php">safer way to do it</a>.</p>

<p><em>You can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429062118/http://eatwell-enjoylife.com/where-to-buy/">find EWEL&apos;s hummus</a> at lots of grocery stores, including Morton Williams, Food Emporium and Zabar&apos;s.</em></p>
