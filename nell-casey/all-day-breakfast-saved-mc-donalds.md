<p>The Millennials <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170214020420/http://gothamist.com/2014/08/25/millennials_mcdonalds_lol.php">gave it a decent effort</a>, but it appears that McDonald&apos;s won&apos;t be dying anytime soon thanks to people who eat Egg McMuffins for dinner. The burger chain&apos;s fourth quarter revenue was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170214020420/http://www.wsj.com/articles/mcdonalds-earnings-climb-on-u-s-strength-1453727578">the best in four years</a>, thanks in no small part to the rollout of all-day breakfast in October. </p>

<p>Analysts anticipated 2.7% growth for the fourth quarter in U.S. restaurants, but the chain exceeded that prediction at 5.7%. The large growth has the Golden Arches <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170214020420/http://money.cnn.com/2016/01/25/investing/mcdonalds-earnings/index.html?sr=twCNN012516/mcdonalds-earnings0207PMStoryLink&amp;linkId=20642136">outperforming other chains</a> including both Burger King and Chipotle, the latter of which had been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170214020420/http://gothamist.com/2015/06/18/mcdonalds_not_expanding.php">connected with the decline</a> of traditional fast food.</p>

<p>Much of the turnaround is being credited to Steve Easterbrook, who became Chief Executive  at McDonald&apos;s last March. In addition to the all-day breakfast move, he&apos;s responsible for other moves&#x2014;including a new McPick 2 program of two items for $2&#x2014;that have contributed to the chain&apos;s recent success. Franchisee&apos;s may have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170214020420/http://nypost.com/2015/10/15/mcdonalds-all-day-breakfast-has-been-a-disaster/">been resistant</a>, but anytime <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170214020420/http://www.brandeating.com/2016/01/fast-food-hack-mcdonalds-sausage-hash-brown-sandwich.html">Sausage Hash Brown Sandwiches</a> aren&apos;t going anywhere soon. </p>
