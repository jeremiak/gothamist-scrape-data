<p>Korean BBQ is one of the most fun and delicious communal dining experiences one can have, but for a newbie who doesn&apos;t know their banchan from their bulgogi, or their soju and their ssambap, it can be a little intimidating the first time. For starters, what type of meat should I order, and how much? What&apos;s the deal with all those plates of food I didn&apos;t order that the server just dropped at my table? What the hell do I do with that basket of lettuce?</p>
