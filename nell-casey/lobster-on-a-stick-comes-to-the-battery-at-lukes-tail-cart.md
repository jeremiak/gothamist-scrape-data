<p>In a twist from their traditional lobster and seafood rolls, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025111833/http://lukeslobster.com/">Luke&apos;s Lobster</a> has debuted the latest of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025111833/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/12/lobster_mac_n_cheese_debuts_on_luke.php">crustacean innovations</a> with the launch of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025111833/http://lukeslobster.com/lukes-tail-cart/">Luke&apos;s Tail Cart</a>, a new kiosk that&apos;s officially open in The Battery. Instead of lobster-stuffed bread, the stall will offer a singular snack: lobster on a stick.</p>

<p>More specifically, lobster tails skewered and grilled over some fire. The tails are split down the middle for cooking&#x2014;and ease of shell extraction&#x2014;and served with either a warm drawn butter scented with lemon or a blueberry balsamic made with berries from Maine (when in season). Regular grilled lobster tails (5 ounces) go for $6 for one skewer (the full tail) or $11 for two skewers (two tails), while the large tails (8 ounces) go for $10 and $19. By comparison, the lobster rolls at their other locations go for $16. </p>

<p>The cart&apos;ll be open daily from 11:30 a.m. to 7 p.m. and it&apos;ll also serve some seasonal drinks and small desserts. Since the tails are super portable thanks to the sticks, you can take them on a ride on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025111833/http://gothamist.com/2015/08/19/seaglass_carousel_battery.php#photo-1">Seaglass Carousel</a>, which is right next door.</p>
