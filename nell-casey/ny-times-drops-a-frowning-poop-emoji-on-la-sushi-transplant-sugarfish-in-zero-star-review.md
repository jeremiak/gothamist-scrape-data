<p>It&apos;s Tuesday and Pete Wells has dropped his latest review, tackling <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170324030614/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/05/sugarfish_sushi_nyc.php#photo-1">LA transplant Sugarfish</a> and...totally poop Emoji&apos;ing all over it. In his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170324030614/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/21/dining/sugarfish-by-sushi-nozawa-review.html">zero star review</a>, Wells craps on nearly every part of the restaurant, from the wait times&#x2014;the restaurant has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170324030614/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/beloved-la-sugarfish-makes-a-huge-splash-nyc-opens-four-hour-wait-947445">drawn four-hour lines</a> since opening&#x2014;to the food. </p>

<p>Wells&apos;s claims of overly-vinegared rice and fish that didn&apos;t &quot;[taste] much like fish&quot; are tame compared to his complaints about the restaurant&apos;s wasabi:</p>

<blockquote>Fresh wasabi may be too much to ask at Sugarfish&apos;s prices, but there is no wasabi at all under the fish. This is weird. Where sushi is concerned, wasabi isn&apos;t just a condiment. It&apos;s the air in the tires. <strong>Sugarfish lets you apply your own from some concentric bloops of stuff that tastes like watery horseradish and looks like a green version of the poop emoji, without the smile</strong>.</blockquote>

<p><em>Burn</em>, though not as scathing as the Per Se bong rip <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170324030614/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/12/per_nay_jose.php">heard &apos;round the world</a>, which was still a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170324030614/https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/13/dining/pete-wells-per-se-review.html?smid=tw-nytfood&amp;smtyp=cur&amp;_r=0">two star review</a>!</p>

<p>Last month, Wells addressed complaints about his ratings and their seeming bias towards two stars, indicating that he had plenty of fodder for &quot;bad&quot; reviews but arguing that they&apos;re <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170324030614/https://twitter.com/pete_wells/status/836709604352528390">&quot;not bad enough to trash.&quot;</a> </p>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I remain mystified by people who complain I write too many two star reviews. You want to read about more one stars? I&apos;ve got plenty of them.</p>&#x2014; Pete Wells (@pete_wells) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170324030614/https://twitter.com/pete_wells/status/836708052640411648">February 28, 2017</a></blockquote>

<p>Wells issued another zero star review in January for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170324030614/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/03/dining/locol-review-oakland-california-pete-wells.html">Roi Choi&apos;s LA restaurant Locol</a>, which was met with the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170324030614/http://www.eater.com/2017/1/4/14166654/nyt-restaurant-review-locol-zero-stars">internet&apos;s own mixed reviews</a> of the review.
