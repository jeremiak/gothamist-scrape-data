<p>Chef April Bloomfield brought her charming Birmingham accent and a full burger-cooking set up to <em>Late Night</em> last week, where she schooled Seth Meyers and guest Aidy Bryant on proper burger-cooking techniques and how to chug beer straight from the growler. The prolific chef and restaurateur was on the show to promote Salvation Burger, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160821045546/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/10/salvation_burger_april_bloomfield.php">latest in her NYC fleet</a>, which is grilling up burgers, hot dogs, fried pies and boozy shakes in Midtown&apos;s Pod 51 hotel. </p>

<p>Bloomfield demonstrated how to make the restaurant&apos;s Classic Burger, a double-patty affair with cheese, pickles and a special sauce. She debunked a classic burger faux-pas&#x2014;pressing the burger while cooking&#x2014;explaining that all the juice from the meat then gets squeezed out of the patty. &quot;Well, I lost that one,&quot; Meyers quipped about disagreeing with his wife on the method.</p>
