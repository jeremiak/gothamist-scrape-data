<p>The Williamsburg restaurant now known as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171013210622/http://thechineseclubnyc.com/">Chinese Club</a> has reinvented itself from a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171013210622/http://gothamist.com/2014/12/18/best_restaurants_nyc_2014.php">Malaysian eatery</a> to an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171013210622/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/20/chinese_club_indian_vegetarian.php">Indian-Chinese spot</a> and are now channeling Tibet for their latest special. The restaurant now serves a Momo Burger, inspired by the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171013210622/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/29/momos_himalayan_yak.php#photo-1">Tibetan and Nepalese dumplings called momos</a>.</p>

<p>The restaurant&apos;s making momos with beef cheeks and oxtail broth, but for their burger they&apos;re using chicken to form the meatball part of the dumpling. Like any regular burger, they&apos;re topping the dumplings with cheese, a spicy mayonnaise and lettuce on a fluffy bun. The dumplings stand in for the beef patty here, so expect it to be a more carbohydrate-centered burger than we&apos;re accustomed to. Burgers are $8.95. </p>

<p>The restaurant also recently <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171013210622/http://thechineseclubnyc.com/the-chinese-club-lunch-menu.pdf">launched lunch</a> with two set menus, with a choice of either noodles or fried rice with an appetizer ($7.95) or a choice of sauce/protein with rice ($8.95) Monday to Friday from noon til 3 p.m. </p>
