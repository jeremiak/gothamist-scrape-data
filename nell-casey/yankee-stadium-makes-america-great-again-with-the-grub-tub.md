<p>New York City baseball stadiums don&apos;t get the kind of wackadoodle concession items as other arenas, like the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028103204/http://www.cnbc.com/2016/04/01/2016s-craziest-new-mlb-stadium-foods.html?slide=4">Burgerizza</a> in Atlanta or even <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028103204/http://gothamist.com/2015/09/11/jets_food_poison_early_grave.php">this insane crap</a> you can get at MetLife in New Jersey. But what our MLB teams lack in culinary creativity, they make up with in inventive food vessels. Case in point: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028103204/http://www.rpandassociates.com/other-products/grub-tub-grab-go-upseller">the Grub Tub</a>. I haven&apos;t been this excited to watch turncoat Jacoby Ellsbury weakly ground out with runners in scoring position since the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028103204/http://gothamist.com/2014/04/14/yankees_nacho_helmet.php">Nacho Helmet</a>.</p>

<p>A friend of Gothamist&apos;s shared with us this meal delivery innovation, which is essentially an inverse, oversized beverage lid fashioned into a bowl to store food. The straw pokes up through the chicken fingers (or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028103204/https://www.facebook.com/RPAssociatesInc/photos/pb.134626323258703.-2207520000.1463407866./1015700385151288/?type=3&amp;theater">whatever</a>) so you can access your Big Gulp-sized carbonated sugar water without removing the lid. An entire meal you can hold with one hand, or stash in the cup holder, or place in a child&apos;s lap. It&apos;s brilliant, it&apos;s beautiful, it&apos;s going to make America great again. Look at these satisfied <strike>customers</strike> actors!</p>

<p>Truly, this is brilliant. Anyone who frequents sporting events knows the trauma of balancing those flimsy paper trays in one hand while attempting to cheer&#x2014;or drink a beer&#x2014;with the other. A Grub Tub of chicken fingers, fries and a large drink sets you back $18.50, according to our tipster, and the tubs can fit cups of varying sizes (and bottles), according to the website. </p>

<p>If the inventors at RP &amp; Associates know their market, they&apos;ll give the fans what they really want next season: the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028103204/https://snapasnack.wordpress.com/2014/06/16/ny-yankees-bucket-o-chicken/">Grub Tub Chicken Bucket</a>.</p>
