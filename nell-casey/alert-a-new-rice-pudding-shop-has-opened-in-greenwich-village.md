<p>Has it truly been 13 years since the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160720211759/http://gothamist.com/2003/04/05/rice_to_riches_reviewed.php">debut of Rice To Riches</a>? My fellow NYU freshmen were very excited about it, that much I recall. If there&apos;s been a challenger to the original in the interim, it&apos;s lost to me like many a Friday night in college. Either way, there&apos;s a new rice pudding destination in the city, with the opening of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160720211759/http://www.ricecreamshoppe.com/">Rice Cream Shoppe</a>, located in a different section of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160720211759/http://www.nyu.edu/library/bobst/research/arch/175/pages/mascot.htm">Bobcat territory</a> on Bleecker Street. </p>

<p>The Shoppe scoops up 20 different flavors of pudding, 15 of which will be staple creations and five more seasonal. Rum Raisin, S&apos;Mores, Banana Toffee and Dulce de Leche are some of the tempting rice-based creations, plus a traditional Indian Kheer flavor made with cardamom, currants and nuts. If they offered a version with rose water they&apos;d endear themselves to me forever.</p>

<p>They&apos;ll be offering vegan flavors as well, plus others that are low-fat and gluten-free. The puddings come in three sizes: 8 ounces for $7, 12 ounces for $8.75 and a quart for $20 with any toppings or service in a waffle bowl an extra buck. Those of us with no qualms about additional calories can get a whipped cream topper free of charge. </p>
