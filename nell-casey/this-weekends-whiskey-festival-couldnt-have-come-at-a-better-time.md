<p>The <strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161123132549/http://www.ridgewoodmarket.com/food-fest/">Ridgewood Food Festival</a></strong> brings a bunch of area restaurants to one place on Saturday at the neighborhood&apos;s venue <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161123132549/http://www.thefootlightbar.nyc/">The Footlight</a>. Between noon and 6 p.m., eateries including Gyro World, Sweet Dreams by Jen (cupcakes, cookies, pies), I Like Food (pernil sandwiches and vegan sloppy joes) and Quetzal Ceja (tamales served with homemade salsa) will be serving up ready-made foods alongside folks selling things like jarred spice blends and other goods that could double as holiday gifts. </p>

<p>Drink away 2016 on Saturday at the <strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161123132549/https://www.facebook.com/events/1147927631921004/">NYC Whiskey Fest</a></strong>, unfolding at various times throughout the day in Greenpoint.

<p>West Village restaurant <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161123132549/http://chompchompnyc.com/#welcome"><strong>Chomp Chomp</strong></a>&#x2014;which was just <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161123132549/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/11/michelin_bib_gourmand_2016.php">awarded the Bib Gourmand distinction</a>&#x2014;recently debuted a <strong>brunch program</strong> that employs Chef Simpson Wong&apos;s Singapore hawker-style food. Wong&apos;s an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161123132549/http://gothamist.com/2015/07/01/chomp_chomp_singaporean_hawker_food.php#photo-1">expert with fried chicken</a>, so the Ayam Masak Mereh (fried chicken in a chili and tomato sauce) is a must-order; the Chili Crab Cheese Fries don&apos;t sound too bad, either. Lighter fare includes a Hainanese Chicken Salad with seasonal greens and a Market Vegetables Omelet (butternut squash, kale, Swiss chard and sambal sauce).</p>

<p>You can also funnel all of your fears and frustrations into the competitive arena at the <strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161123132549/http://thetakedowns.com/bkchilitakedown2016/">Brooklyn Chili Takedown</a></strong> at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161123132549/http://www.royalpalmsshuffle.com/">Royal Palms Shuffleboard Club</a> on Sunday. The competition begins at noon for those who bring their crocks of chili; everyone else just gets to eat and pass judgement. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161123132549/http://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/2708868/">Tickets are $20</a> for chili samples and another opportunity to vote :( </p>
