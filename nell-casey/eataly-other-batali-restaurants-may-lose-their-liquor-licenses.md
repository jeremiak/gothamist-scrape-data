<p>A few items on the agenda of an upcoming State Liquor Authority meeting could spell the end of an afternoon glass of rose at one of the Batali empire restaurants&#x2014;at least for the next six months. Wine website Dr. Vino <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407121707/http://www.drvino.com/2014/03/20/batali-bastianich-group-wine-suspension/">discovered some interesting items</a> relating to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407121707/http://bandbhg.com/">Batali and Bastianich Hospitality Group</a>, which operate Eataly, Babbo, Del Posto and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407121707/http://bandbhg.com/our_restaurants.cfm">other notable restaurants</a> in NYC and beyond. According to the agenda [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407121707/http://www.sla.ny.gov/system/files/3-25-2014_-_Compliance.PDF">pdf</a>], the restaurants are charged with &quot;interlocking interest&quot; and &quot;false material statement&quot; by the agency. If the charges are sustained, it could lead to a suspension of the group&apos;s liquor licenses.</p>

<p>SLA documents call for a &quot;global settlement&quot; that includes a $500,000 civil penalty and a six month suspension of Eataly Wine LLC. It also calls for Joe Bastianich&apos;s mother, Lidia, to be removed as principal of the company. The agency refers to these terms as an &quot;offer,&quot; presumably giving the restaurant group an opportunity to counter or fight the charges completely. We reached out to the SLA for clarification and we&apos;ll update if we hear back.</p>

<p>Both Dr. Vino and Eater point to Joe Bastianich&apos;s business <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407121707/http://ny.eater.com/archives/2014/03/batali_bastianichs_group_might_temporarily_lose_booze.php">importing wines</a> to the restaurants and his store as a possible motivation behind the charges, though &quot;insiders&quot; say this could be the SLA flexing its muscles or changing a previous position regarding cross holdings and interlocking ownerships. If the charges hold up, however, it&apos;s going to put a serious damper on our <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407121707/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/26/check_out_eatalys_new_rooftop_beer.php">summer rooftop drinking</a>.</p>

<p>A Batali spokesperson declined to comment.</p>
