title: Stephen Colbert Schools Hillary Clinton On Eating Cheesecake
---

	
										<p>During a visit to famed cheesecake spot Junior&apos;s last week, Hillary Clinton <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021133514/https://twitter.com/eorden/status/718911983601496064?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">pined for</a> but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021133514/https://twitter.com/danmericaCNN/status/718894188289462272">refused to eat a bite</a> of the restaurant&apos;s signature dessert offering. Her rationale? The press would find some way to make her look foolish while eating. Whatever <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021133514/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/10/honeymoons_over_de_blasio_spotted_e.php">could she mean</a>? </p>

<p>Last night, Stephen Colbert took an opportunity to interview Secretary Clinton at Midtown&apos;s Carnegie Deli, where the two discussed the election and Colbert showed Clinton how she <em>should</em> have eaten that cheese cake. Other things we learned from the interview: Bill&apos;s not a &quot;smug vegan,&quot; Hillary loves meat on a stick, both are &quot;subversive&quot; grandparents and...never let Colbert out of your sight when the bill arrives.</p>

<p>See John Kasich? Forks are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021133514/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/17/pickles_pastrami_pandering_nyc_has.php">never required in NYC</a>. </p>
