<p>Murray Hill&apos;s beloved meat mecca <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150924194637/http://www.sargesdeli.com/">Sarge&apos;s Deli</a> triumphantly reopens today after a year and a half restoration following a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150924194637/http://gothamist.com/2012/11/26/beloved_sarges_deli_ravaged_by_3_al.php">massive fire</a> in 2012. They&apos;ll begin service starting at 11 a.m. today, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150924194637/http://blogs.villagevoice.com/forkintheroad/2014/03/sarges_deli_reopening.php">reports Fork in the Road</a>, dishing out their classic pastrami and corned beef sandwiches, potato pancakes and gut-busting egg dishes.</p>

<p>Sarge&apos;s owner Andrew Wengrover tells FITR that all the fan favorite menu items will be available, including The Monster, an insanely large sandwich stuffed with corned beef, pastrami, roast beef, turkey, salami, tomato, lettuce, slaw and Russian dressing. New additions include some fruit compotes for their popular blintzes.</p>

<p>The restaurant looks a little spiffier than it did pre-fire but the homey framed photographs and mismatched stained glass light fixtures remain the same. In its former life, the restaurant operated on a 24-hour basis, bolstering the bellies of late-night revelers. We reached out to confirm it&apos;ll be back in the night owl game but nobody answered the phone. Probably too busy prepping for the onslaught; can&apos;t blame &apos;em! </p>
