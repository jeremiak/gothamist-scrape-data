<p>That infernal prognosticating rodent <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420053949/http://gothamist.com/2014/02/02/staten_island_chuck_doesnt_bite_de.php">predicts more chilly weather</a> in our near future and it looks like the Staten Island native <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420053949/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/31/weekend_weather_mild_milquetoast_an.php">may be correct</a>. Luckily, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420053949/http://www.thecitybakery.com/">City Bakery&apos;s</a> annual <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420053949/http://www.thecitybakery.com/hot-chocolate">Hot Chocolate Festival</a> began on Saturday, so at least we have some fun molten chocolate to keep our spirits up until milder weather prevails.</p>

<p>Now in its 22nd year, the festival brings a daily hot chocolate flavor to the bakery&apos;s flagship location on 18th Street. Combinations range from traditional (Espresso, Cinnamon and Caramel) to daring (Ginger, Chili Pepper and Banana Peel) to more esoteric (Sunken Treasure, Ode to the Polar Bear and French Follies). They&apos;re not <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420053949/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/06/put_red_wine_in_your_hot_chocolate.php">using red wine</a>, but there are Bourbon and Rum Raisin flavors to look forward to, plus the intriguing Happy variety. </p>
