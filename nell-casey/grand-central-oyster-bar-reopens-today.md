<p>Following an almost three month renovation, iconic restaurant Grand Central Oyster Bar reopens to the public today. The old gal, who turned 100 last year, was in need of a little nip-and-tuck, so to speak, and temporarily shut her doors at the beginning of the year.</p>

<p>As part of the facelift, the restaurant&apos;s gorgeous landmarked arch-tile ceilings by Valencian architect Rafael Guastavino were restored and the white lounge area chairs and counters were given a sprucing up. Behind the scenes, the large kitchen area was also renovated.</p>

<p>&#x201C;After 100 years, the Oyster Bar&#x2019;s restoration is well-deserved and much needed,&#x201D; said President Janet Poccia and Vice President Mohammed Lawal in a joint statement. &#x201C;After all, such masterpieces as Michaelangelo&#x2019;s Pieta and Sistine Chapel were restored; the Oyster Bar is part of New York City&#x2019;s fabric and culture, and is worthy of the same.&quot; The team also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422144625/http://gothamist.com/2013/12/17/oyster_bar_brooklyn.php#photo-1">opened a Park Slope outpost</a> last December that sought to mimic the original&apos;s delightful decor. </p>

<p>&#x201C;The seemingly ageless queen of New York dining will still serve its 5 million plus oysters this year, just after a two-month hiatus,&#x201D; assured the owners. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422144625/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/18/how_to_become_an_oyster_snob_withou.php">Bring it on</a>.</p>
