<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170913081527/http://www.stayclassynewyork.com/">Stay Classy</a>, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170913081527/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/10/photos_will_ferrell-themed_bar_stay.php#photo-1">Will Ferrell tribute bar</a> on the Lower East Side, will sign off the air this week. The bar, which opened in October of last year, will throw a few final parties before closing, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170913081527/http://www.thelodownny.com/leslog/2016/12/stay-classy-bar-on-rivington-street-is-closing-this-week.html">The Lo-Down reports</a>.</p>

<p>The concept&apos;s doing well as a pop-up, however, recently <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170913081527/http://laist.com/2016/11/30/stay_classy_bar.php">mixing Smelly Pirate Hooker cocktails</a> in Los Angeles, with future pop-ups planned for Boston, Miami and Philly, according to the owners. They&apos;re also planning future NYC iterations of Stay Classy and promise something &quot;so awesome&quot; is coming to the 174 Rivington Street space. Co-owner Zach Neil tells us the new project, opening in February, will &quot;pay tribute a time period in the coolest way possible!&quot;</p>

<p>Neil and co-owner Brian Link&apos;s other themed bar&#x2014;an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170913081527/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/21/tim_burton_bar_east_village.php">ode to director Tim Burton</a>&#x2014;appears to still be in working order. </p>
