<p>In April, chef Wylie Dufresne <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170613174756/http://gothamist.com/2017/04/21/dus_donuts_wylie_dufresne.php#photo-1">debuted his new donut operation</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170613174756/https://www.dusdonuts.com/">Du&apos;s Donuts</a>, as part of Williamsburg&apos;s William Vale Hotel&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170613174756/http://gothamist.com/2016/12/16/leuca_william_vale_williamsburg.php#photo-1">dining options</a>. It was just the donuts to start&#x2014;in flavors like Coffee Malt and Pomegranate Tahini&#x2014;but now Dufresne is tackling the other big day starter: the breakfast sandwich.</p>

<p>Beginning today, Du&apos;s will serve a cross between a classic BEC and a grilled cheese. Two slices of Martin&apos;s potato bread hold soft scrambled eggs with bacon bits, cream cheese and Land O&apos; Lakes American cheese. </p>

<p>Dufresne <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170613174756/http://www.grubstreet.com/2017/06/wylie-dufresne-debuts-egg-sandwich-at-dus-donuts-and-coffee.html">tells Grub Street</a> the sandwich is inspired by meals at Joe Jr., but it&apos;s doubtful the Gramercy diner is scrambling their eggs, spreading them on a sheet tray and then slicing squares of the cooled egg mixture to fit the bread, as Dufresne is doing here. The sandwich is finished on the flattop, just like a grilled cheese sandwich <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170613174756/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/22/you_and_i_have_a_problem.php">should be</a>. </p>

<p>Dufresne&apos;s obsession with eggs is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170613174756/http://nymag.com/restaurants/features/30007/">well documented</a>, from his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170613174756/https://www.eater.com/2015/1/14/7533485/wd50-eggs-benedict-wylie-dufresne-eater-elements">&quot;iconic&quot; rendition to Eggs Benedict</a> to his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170613174756/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/01/t-magazine/wylie-dufresne-dus-donuts-food-diary.html">obsession with the bodega egg and cheese</a>. This isn&apos;t even Dufresne&apos;s first crack at the BEC market: he collaborated with Dominique &quot;Mr. Cronut&quot; Ansel to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170613174756/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/14/ansel_dufresne_breakfast_sandwich.php">create a $20 egg sandwich</a> last year.</p>

<p>Mercifully, the offering at Du&apos;s only costs $4.75 (or $4.25 for a vegetarian version). The sandwich will only be available Monday through Friday from  8:30 a.m. - 11:30 a.m. or while supplies last. </p>
