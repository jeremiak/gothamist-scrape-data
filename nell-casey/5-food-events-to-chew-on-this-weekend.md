<p>Chef Ryan Schmidtberger and the lovely ladies behind Kips Bay&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131207091820/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/20/grace_1.php">newest cocktail bar Grace</a> launch <strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131207091820/http://www.gracebarnyc.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Grace-Specials.pdf">Sunday Roasts</a></strong> this week, a new weekly dinner series that harkens back to the good old days when families would actually acknowledge each other at meals. Beginning at 5 p.m., the pub offers $29 meals consisting of prime rib, roasted potatoes, Brussels sprouts and made-to-order Yorkshire pudding. Schmidtberger roasts the boneless rib eyes for seven hours and makes his beef-and-Parmesan flavored puddings in tiny cast iron pans when you order them to prevent the souffle-like dish from deflating. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131207091820/http://www.gracebarnyc.com/">Make a reservation</a>, especially if you&apos;re coming with a group; the chef will even give you a whole roast if your party is big enough.</p>
