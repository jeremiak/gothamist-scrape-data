<p>What began as a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170111162102/http://gothamist.com/2015/03/05/black_tap_soho.php#photo-1">casual burger joint</a> in SoHo has morphed into an Instagram factory for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170111162102/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/27/black_tap_milkshake_insanity.php">crazy ass milkshakes</a>, with new locations for dessert paparazzi springing up all over the place. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170111162102/https://blacktapnyc.com/">Black Tap Craft Burgers &amp; Beer</a> will be springing up in DUMBO next year, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170111162102/http://nypost.com/2016/12/26/black-tap-to-take-cult-eatery-to-brooklyn-lower-east-side/">the Post announced</a>, inhabiting a space inside the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170111162102/http://gothamist.com/2016/12/02/photos_empire_stores_dumbo.php#photo-1">Empire Stores development</a> that&apos;s transforming a large swath of Brooklyn Bridge Park.</p>

<p>This spring, Black Tap opens at 55 Water Street, part of the Civil War-era warehouse&apos;s rebranding as a hip retail outlet. It&apos;s worth noting that Shake Shack&apos;s DUMBO location is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170111162102/http://gothamist.com/2014/06/17/dumbo_shake_shack_open.php">just around the corner</a>. Prior to this, Black Tap had expanded to a much larger and flashier spot in the Meatpacking District, and there are apparently plans for another location on the Lower East Side by summer 2017. </p>

<p>While the milkshakes have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170111162102/http://gothamist.com/2016/09/22/by_chloe_black_tap_vegan.php">eclipsed the namesake burger</a>, their patty offering is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170111162102/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/01/best_burgers_nyc.php">worth a visit</a> in its own right&#x2014;if you can stomach the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170111162102/https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/blacktap/?hl=en">photoshoot</a> at the next table. </p>
