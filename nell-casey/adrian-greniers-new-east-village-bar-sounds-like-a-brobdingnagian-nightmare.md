<p>Things that are bad: </p>

<ul>
<li>Tepid <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170309042335/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/22/is_scorseses_vinyl_good_yet.php">portrayals of the &apos;70s</a>.</li>
<li>Businesses that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170309042335/http://gothamist.com/2014/02/13/dont_patronize_me_with_your_silly_p.php">promote gender stereotypes</a>.</li>
<li>Candied Bacon Quinoa Sushi.</li>
<li>Co-opting <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170309042335/https://www.instagram.com/p/BJQqepHhtKm/">David Bowie</a> for marketing.</li>
<li>The phrase &quot;table-side mixologist.&quot;</li>
</ul>

<p>Things you&apos;ll find at the forthcoming &quot;house of cocktails&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170309042335/http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/eats/eats-beat-adrian-grenier-behind-new-70-inspired-bar-vnyl-article-1.2720196?cid=bitly">backed by Adrian Grenier</a> on Third Ave between 12th and 13th Streets:<br>
</p><ul><li>All of the above.</li></ul><p></p>

<p>The tri-level space that houses Nevada Smiths, which was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170309042335/http://evgrieve.com/2015/09/the-marshal-seizes-nevada-smiths-on-3rd.html">seized by the City Marshal last year</a>, is about to reopen as The VNYL, a collaboration between The Late Late bar owner James Morrissey and Grenier. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170309042335/https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20160818/east-village/glam-1970s-inspired-bar-restaurant-opening-east-village">DNAinfo got some details</a> and ::whistles:: hoo boy there&apos;s a lot to unpack here. </p>

<p>Starting with schtick: &quot;a residence from the 1970s&quot; complete with a record store, a &quot;Black Rose Room,&quot; a &quot;Champagne Garden&quot; complete with indoor rope swing, and a &quot;gentlemen&apos;s lounge,&quot; ya know, just for the dudez. As we all know, you have to be a man to enjoy things like whiskey and draft beer. They&apos;re also going to have something called &quot;sports&quot; on &quot;TVs,&quot; too, but as I am not a man, I don&apos;t know what these words mean. These complicated concepts have to be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170309042335/http://gothamist.com/2014/02/13/dont_patronize_me_with_your_silly_p.php">written in pink</a> for my dainty female brain to comprehend. </p>

<p>I&apos;m still not entirely sure the &quot;California-esque&quot; dishes being touted aren&apos;t a joke. &quot;Candied Bacon Quinoa Sushi with avocado creme&quot; sounds like what a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170309042335/http://gothamist.com/2015/09/03/brooklyn_menu_generator.php">menu generator</a> might spit out if it could only populate using hackneyed food trends from the last decade. For some contemporary flair: a Salmon Poke Bowl. </p>

David Bowie&apos;s <em>Aladdin Sane</em> album cover is one of the most iconic in rock&#x2014;nay, in music. Subtle <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170309042335/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/29/david_bowie_tribute_nyc.php">tributes</a> to the late legend are great. Emblazoning his symbol onto the face of a supermodel to promote your business feels exploitative. It hasn&apos;t even <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170309042335/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/11/remembering_david_bowie.php">been a year yet</a>; we&apos;re still healing, and probably will be for the foreseeable future. Just don&apos;t.
<br><br>
The term mixologist gets thrown around a lot, usually as a nickname for an unbearably serious bartender (with some exceptions). At The VNYL, there&apos;ll be no escape at the mezzanine level, where, confusingly, bottle service comes with someone to mix drinks for the group. It&apos;s been years since I set foot in a place boasting this kind of service, but isn&apos;t the point that you get to make your own drink and drain the bottle of overpriced Grey Goose before someone else in your party?
<br><br> 
Anyway, this thing is opening on September 9th and sounds worse than Nevada Smiths, which is truly an accomplishment. If you need more convincing, look at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170309042335/https://www.instagram.com/thevnyl/">supermodel and nipple-strewn Instagram</a>. Congrats, Vince.
