<p>Money can&apos;t buy you happiness but it <em>can</em> buy you a pseudo-&quot;celebrity&quot; chef&apos;s friendship for a day&#x2014;if you&apos;re a hedge-fund billionaire with a lust for donkey sauce, that is. In his-soon-to-be-released memoir <em>From Scratch: Inside The Food Network</em> journalist Allen Salkin reveals that Steve Cohen paid the Mayor of Flavortown to &quot;reenact a fantasy episode of <em>Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives</em>,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131022021727/http://pagesix.com/2013/10/21/he-paid-100k-to-become-guy-fieris-friend-for-a-day/?_ga=1.69295122.349300054.1312455005">according to Page Six</a>. The price for this most dudetacular outing? A cool $100,000. </p>

<p>A rep for Cohen claims the story &quot;is false,&quot; but admits the duo do know each other, a fact confirmed by an episode of the spiky-haired host&apos;s show:</p>

<p>Alex (Cohen&apos;s wife) and Steve are alluded to in the episode, which sees his broness eating chili dogs from Super Duper Weenie in Fairfield, CT, where the couple lives. </p>

<p>It&apos;s comforting to know the billionaire&#x2014;whose hedge fund SAC Capital will <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131022021727/http://www.forbes.com/sites/afontevecchia/2013/10/17/steve-cohens-sac-capital-to-settle-criminal-insider-trading-case-for-over-1b-wsj/">settle a billion dollar insider trading suit</a> this week&#x2014;will have support from loyal friend$ during these trying times. And with Fieri&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131022021727/http://gothamist.com/2012/09/12/guy_fieris_times_square_restaurant.php#photo-1">successful Times Square salt emporium</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131022021727/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/19/take_that_pete_wells_guy_fieri_gets.php">newly crowned heart attack trigger</a>, it looks like Cohen made a very wise friendship investment indeed. </p>
