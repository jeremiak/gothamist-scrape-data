<p>This city just can&apos;t get enough of its <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130827045756/http://gothamist.com/tags/cocktails">mixology</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130827045756/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/17/the_10_best_cocktail_bars_in_nyc.php">cocktail dens</a>&#x2014;or maybe we just have a collective alcohol problem. Either way, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130827045756/http://brooklynexposed.com/food-drink/entry/brooklyn-exposed-second-annual-shaken-and-stirred-event/">Brooklyn Shaken &amp; Stirred</a> taps into your enjoyment of mixed drinks, presenting an evening of imbibing specialty cocktails by some of the borough&apos;s big cocktail bars. It&apos;s part boozefest, part competition, with each bar tasked with creating a specialty cocktail in the hopes of winning some promotion on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130827045756/http://www.brooklynexposed.com/">Brooklyn Exposed</a>, who is hosting the event. Not the sexiest of prizes&#x2014;for attendees, anyway&#x2014;but we&apos;re there to get buzzed, so let&apos;s talk specifics.</p>

<p>Six bars are participating in the event, including Huckleberry Bar, Tooker Alley and Vodou Bar. Also on hand, small-batch booze from Brooklyn, like Brooklyn Gin, Van Brunt Stillhouse, which makes grappa and moonshine, Brooklyn Oenology and others. With all the boozing, organizers have thoughtfully included food options as well, including smoked meats from Dinosaur Bar-B-Que and Fort Reno, Pilar Cuban Eatery, Sembrado and The Chocolate Room.</p>

<p>Until August 31st, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130827045756/https://bkshakenstirred2013.eventbrite.com/?ref=etckt">tickets go for $50</a>, then rise to $55 until the event on October 8th. Unfortunately, the event falls on a Tuesday, but get there by 6 p.m. when doors open and out by 9 p.m. when the shakers fall silent and you might just spare yourself a work day hangover. </p>
