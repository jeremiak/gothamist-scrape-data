<p>It&apos;s a known fact that workers in low-wage fast food jobs can&apos;t live on their pittance of a salary alone&#x2014;heck, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508124039/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/16/mcdonalds_helpfully_illustrates_tha.php">even their employers know it</a>! But two new studies reveal that the burden falls squarely on taxpayers to help support workers who can&apos;t make enough money on their own. In New York State, taxpayers dish out to the tune of $708 million a year in public assistance. That&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508124039/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/06/taste_test_taco_bell_cool_ranch_dor.php">a lotta loco tacos</a>. </p>

<p>According to a study by the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508124039/http://laborcenter.berkeley.edu/publiccosts/fastfoodpovertywages.shtml">UC Berkeley Labor Center</a>, 60% of families in New York who rely on a fast food salary must use public assistance programs to supplement their meager income. The study also concludes that 67% of &quot;core front-line fast-food workers&quot; are adults over the age of 20, debunking the myth perpetuated by fast food companies that most of their workers are teens cutting their teeth in the food industry.</p>

<p>A separate report by the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508124039/http://www.nelp.org/page/-/rtmw/NELP-Fast-Food-Super-Sizing-Public-Costs.pdf?nocdn=1">National Employment Law Project</a> further breaks down the low-wage fast food/taxpayer burden scenario, revealing that McDonald&apos;s leaves taxpayers responsible for $1.2 billion annually (on a national scale) with YUM! Brands (KFC, Taco Bell, etc.) costing taxpayers $648 million annually. Even more staggering, the McDonald&apos;s corporation raked in $5.46 billion last year in profits with an extra $5.5 billion in dividends and stock buyback; they also pay their CEO Donald Thompson $13.7 million per year.</p>

<p>Fast food workers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508124039/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/20/fast_food_workers_to_stage_nationwi.php">nationally</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508124039/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/30/i_make_a_smile_why_cant_i_get_to_sm.php">locally</a> have staged walkouts demanding a living wage in addition to better working conditions. With one in five families trying to survive on a fast-food salary living below the poverty line&#x2014;with 43% with incomes two times the federal poverty level or less&#x2014;activists say it&apos;s vitally important to address the current federal minimum wage, especially since the Affordable Care Act has officially become law. </p>
