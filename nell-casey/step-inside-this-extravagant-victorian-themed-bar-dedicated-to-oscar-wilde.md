					<p>Opulent light fixtures, custom marble, antique fireplaces, scores of paintings and photographs, and two statues of Oscar Wilde are what await at a new bar in NoMad named for and dedicated to the Irish writer. Tommy Burke and Frank McCole, who run the similarly-decorated duo of Lillie&apos;s bars&#x2014;named for Wilde&apos;s longtime friend, actress Lillie Langtry&#x2014;are behind this new space, which will open in late June on West 27th Street.</p>

<p>&quot;Coming from County Mayo and County Monaghan in Ireland, we grew up reading Oscar Wilde and studying his literature,&quot; Burke and McCole say of their inspiration. &quot;We want the bar to celebrate his legacy and become an inclusive destination for all.&quot;</p>

<p>The two men spent a considerable amount of time and money renovating the space, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170616005700/http://daytoninmanhattan.blogspot.com/2014/02/prohibition-headquarters-nos-45-47-west.html">which was home</a> to the city&apos;s Prohibition Enforcement Headquarters in a previous life. They spent <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170616005700/https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/15/nyregion/oscar-wilde-bar-manhattan.html">$4 million</a> acquiring all of the many, <em>many</em> design features, including the hand-carved marble imported from Vietnam, Milanese painted glass from the 1800s, and lots of clocks.</p>

<p>&quot;The standing clock from England dating from the 1880&apos;s is our favorite design piece. We will set the time on all the clocks to 1:50 pm, which is the time of Oscar&apos;s final act,&quot; Burke and McCole tell Gothamist. &quot;We have one grandfather clock from England and other 24 small time pieces from the British Isles.&quot;</p>

<p>Then there&apos;s the enormous bar, which they&apos;re claiming will be the city&apos;s longest at 118.5 feet. </p>

<p>The author can be seen drinking a Guinness at one end of said bar; the iconic Irish beer is also a key ingredient in the bar&apos;s signature cocktail, the &quot;Oscar Wilde&apos;s Potent Elixir,&quot; made with cognac, gin, Guinness, cassis, lavender, champagne and orange zest. Mixologist Johnny Swet will channel both Prohibition-era cocktails in addition to Victorian sensibilities and what Wilde himself liked to drink, including champagne and absinthe. </p>

<p>When they eventually open there&apos;ll be food, too, including &quot;gastropub&quot;-type dishes like cottage pie and a bacon cheeseburger. </p>
