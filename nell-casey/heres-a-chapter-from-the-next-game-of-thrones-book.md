<p>If you&apos;re worried <em>Game of Thrones</em> creator George R. R. Martin might not make it to the end of his epic fantasy novels, at least we&apos;ll have a few snippets to...give us more questions. The author recently <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504233504/http://www.georgerrmartin.com/excerpt-from-the-winds-of-winter/">released an excerpt</a> <strong>[SPOILERS EVERYWHERE OBVIOUSLY</strong>] from <em>Winds of Winter</em>, the sixth novel in his <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> series. </p>

<p>Don&apos;t be fooled by the date on the post, the author says he wrote the chapter years ago and is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504233504/http://grrm.livejournal.com/361577.html">just now releasing it</a>. All we&apos;ll say is that the chapter is titled &quot;Mercy,&quot; which readers know means that&apos;s the character whose perspective we&apos;ll be exploring. </p>

<p>Once again, <strong>SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS</strong>, but readers who <em>just can&apos;t wait</em> for more from Martin&apos;s world will enjoy catching up with some familiar...<em>faces</em>. Note that the HBO series hasn&apos;t yet caught up with the novels, so if you haven&apos;t read the books...do not read this. You have been warned.
