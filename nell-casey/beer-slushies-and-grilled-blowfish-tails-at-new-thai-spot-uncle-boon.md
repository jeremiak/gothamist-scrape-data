</div></div>					<p>Husband and wife team Matt Danzer and Ann Redding, who met while they were cooking at Per Se, have opened a new Thai restaurant in Nolita cooking up traditional Thai food. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160522162005/http://uncleboons.com/">Uncle Boons</a>&#x2014;named for Redding&apos;s uncle&#x2014;serves dishes inspired by Redding&apos;s childhood in Thailand, where multiple members of her family were involved in the culinary industry in some way. </p>

<p>Enter into the pub room, which features a 10-seat bar with views of the rotisserie and charcoal grill. There&apos;s a lot of eye candy on the exposed brick walls, which are full of framed prints and photographs illuminated by mismatched chandeliers. A second dining area in the back&#x2014;named the Sanuk Sanuk room, which means &quot;fun&quot; in Thai&#x2014;channels the &apos;60s and &apos;70s with wood paneled walls and a mirrored ceiling plus views of the outdoor garden in the back. </p>

<p>Specialties of the house include a selection of grilled items, like the Pak Pau (blowfish tails, $14), and Koong (head-on prawns, $16), which both come with lime, garlic and chile dipping sauce. You&apos;ll definitely want the rotisserie chicken (Kai Yang Muay Thai, $22) after you&apos;ve watched and smelled the slow roasted hens on the spit. If you&apos;re just stopping in for drinks and a few bites, grab a Singha Beer Slushie ($7) or Tamarind Shandy ($10) with tamarind, Pomelo Bitters and Barrier Brew Pilsner and order a bunch of small plates to split among the group. </p>

<p><em>7 Spring Street, 646-370-6650. Open Monday through Thursday 5:30 p.m. to 11 p.m.; Friday through Saturday 5:30 p.m. to 12 a.m.; Sunday 5:30 p.m. to 10 p.m.</em></p>
