<p>There&apos;s a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422205006/http://gothamist.com/tags/empirebiscuit">biscuit mania</a> gripping the city at the moment and with good reason: biscuits are freaking delicious. Comforting, hearty, buttery, fluffy&#x2014;what&apos;s not to like about these beautiful, golden rounds of dough? While heeding the call of the biscuit at 3 a.m. would be better suited to an on-the-go eatery, baking biscuits at home means you&apos;re rewarded with not only some melt-in-your-mouth baked goods whenever you want them but also the satisfaction of making something with your own two hands. Pillsbury, schmillsbury!</p>

<p>With a few basic ingredients&#x2014;most of which you likely already have in your pantry&#x2014;and some equally basic kitchen supplies&#x2014;mostly your hands&#x2014;you can whip up a batch of homey biscuits in just about 30 minutes, about the same amount of time you&apos;d spend waiting on line at a certain recently opened downtown eatery. </p>

<p>Stay tuned tomorrow and Friday for how to make your own Sausage Gravy plus fruit jams and cheese spreads. </p>

<p>Now let&apos;s get baked.</p>

<p><strong>Biscuit Ingredients</strong> (Not pictured because whoopsie I was working fast and forgot!)</p>

<ul>
<li>2 cups all purpose flour</li>
<li>4 tablespoons baking powder</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
<li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
<li>4 tablespoons butter, cubed and chilled</li>
<li>2 tablespoons shortening, chilled (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422205006/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/07/fda_ban_trans_fats.php">trans fat-free</a> because ew yeah. Use a brand like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422205006/http://www.spectrumorganics.com/?id=87">Spectrum</a>)</li>
<li>1 cup buttermilk (yes, regular milk works too), chilled</li>
</ul>

<p>Preheat oven to 450 degrees. In my parent&apos;s super-fancy-oh-wait-is-this-actually-a-space-ship? oven this took about five minutes; I&apos;m guessing the dust-and-dirty-dish-filled model you&apos;re rocking might take a little longer, so plan accordingly. </p>

<p>It&apos;s time to start on the biscuits. Now, let me be very clear: I am not from the South. My mama didn&apos;t bake fresh biscuits in her seasoned cast-iron pan; I didn&apos;t grow up eating Chicken Biscuits with my friends after school; and I certainly don&apos;t claim to know &quot;the right way&quot; to make biscuits, if such a thing even exists. What I do know is that biscuits are delicious, easy to make and&#x2014;provided you follow a few guildelines&#x2014;difficult to fuck up.</p>

<p>One of those guidelines has to do with the temperature of the fat, i.e. the butter and shortening. Look at any recipe for biscuits/pastry and they&apos;ll all say the same thing: keep your fat as cold as possible and work the dough quickly and as little as possible so the fat remains solid. I&apos;m not Alton Brown so I can&apos;t/won&apos;t give you a science lesson here (that&apos;s what Google is for) so you&apos;re just going to have to take this lesson at face value. </p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="111113biscuit_cutter.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422205006im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_nellcasey/111113biscuit_cutter.jpg" width="640" height="427"> <br> <i> <span class="photo_caption">The best part about your parent&apos;s kitchen: obscure gadgets (Nell Casey/Gothamist)</span></i></div> <p></p>

<p>Mix all the dry ingredients in a large bowl then add the cold butter and shortening. Working quickly, gently start to break apart the chunks of fat into the flour with your fingers. If you&apos;re lucky, you have terrible circulation or a drafty apartment and your fingers will be ice cold, preventing the butter from warming too quickly. If your landlord doesn&apos;t hold the heat hostage, you&apos;ll want to to think about using a pastry blender (as seen above). At last resort&#x2014;because you are old-school and don&apos;t need fancy gadgets!&#x2014;you may use your food processor; make sure to pulse lightly so not to over mix.</p>

<p>Whatever your method, work the dough lightly and quickly until it&apos;s mostly incorporated and resembles little crumbles. Ideally, those crumbles are composed of delicious orbs of butter and shortening, which will make your biscuits fluffy and buttery and delicious.</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="111113biscuit_ball.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422205006im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_nellcasey/111113biscuit_ball.jpg" width="640" height="427"> <br> <i> <span class="photo_caption">Wanna Whole Ballo Love (Nell Casey/Gothamist)</span></i></div> <p></p>

<p>Make a little well/hole/space in the center of your biscuit mix and pour in half of the buttermilk. Gently start folding and stirring, adding more buttermilk, until the mixture comes together to form a loose mass. Dump the biscuit mixture on a clean surface&#x2014;LIKE REALLY, REALLY CLEAN PLEASE WASH YOUR COUNTER&#x2014;with lots of flour. Bring the biscuit mixture together with your hands, then fold the dough over on itself a few times so it&apos;s more cohesive. Gently smoosh (technical term) the dough out with your fingers until it&apos;s about one inch thick.</p>

<p>Using a biscuit cutter...what&apos;s that? You don&apos;t have a <em>biscuit cutter</em>?!? You knew you were making biscuits, friend, don&apos;t tell me you&apos;re unprepared! Fine, fine, fine. In lieu of the proper cutting utensils, a clean, empty soup can works just fine so long as it&apos;s well floured so the biscuits pop out easily. </p>

<p>Okay back to the task at hand: cut out as many biscuits as you can from your initial circle. Place them on a lightly greased cookie sheet with enough space between them for maximum puffage (technical term). Recombine the scraps from the first round of cutting, reform into a circle and cut out as many as you can. The subsequent rounds of biscuits won&apos;t be quite as fluffy but you&apos;re going to be drowning them in butter and gravy and shoving them in your mouth hole not parading them in front of Dominique Ansel so just relax.</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="111113biscuit_cut.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422205006im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_nellcasey/111113biscuit_cut.jpg" width="640" height="427"> <br> <i> <span class="photo_caption">Soon...sooooon (Nell Casey/Gothamist)</span></i></div> <p></p>

<p>Lovingly place your biscuits into the oven and bake for 10 to 15 minutes until they&apos;ve puffed up and developed a beautiful golden color. Evacuate and serve immediately with one&#x2014;or all!&#x2014;of the toppings featured in tomorrow&apos;s post. Although, just slathering with more butter wouldn&apos;t be a terrible option either.</p>
