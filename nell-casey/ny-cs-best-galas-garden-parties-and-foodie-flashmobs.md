title: NYC's Best Galas, Garden Parties And Foodie Flashmobs
---

	
										<p><em>NYC has a surfeit of phenomenal cultural events happening every day, from impromptu musical performances in Union Square to legendary performances at Carnegie Hall. We also know how to party. So when you want to appreciate elegant art dressed in your finest duds or drink artfully crafted cocktails in a well-appointed venue, look no further than these annual parties and galas. Unlike <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508173429/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/08/stars_sparkle_at_the_2012_met_gala.php#photo-1">the Metropolitan Museum&apos;s Costume Gala</a>, you can actually get into these without being a celebrity or going completely bankrupt.</em></p>

<p><strong>MoMA GARDEN PARTY</strong>: Once a year, MoMA&apos;s minimalist sculpture garden is transformed into &quot;Party in the Garden,&quot; a glittering affair to benefit the museum&apos;s general operating fund. It&apos;s a party we <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508173429/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/23/inside_momas_annual_garden_party_fe.php#photo-6">look forward to every year</a>, not only because of the top shelf open bar but also the killer live performances&#x2014;Santigold last year, Kanye West the year before. The admission price isn&apos;t cheap (last year it was $150), but considering you get to hobnob with some of the art world&apos;s biggest names in a spectacular location and drink unlimited booze for four hours, it&apos;s worth it. This year&apos;s party takes place on Tuesday, May 21st; announcements about this year&apos;s performers will be made sometime in March. &#x2014; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508173429/https://twitter.com/nellcasey"><em>Nell Casey</em></a></p>

<p><b>CHAPLIN AWARD GALA AT FILM SOCIETY OF LINCOLN CENTER</b>: Each year, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508173429/http://filmlinc.com/">Film Society of Lincoln Center</a> selects a filmmaker or actor to honor with the Charlie Chaplin Award (named after Chaplin, who was the first honoree back in 1972). The galas are star-studded events and, this year, the Film Society is paying tribute to Brooklyn native Barbra Streisand for her &quot;long career of incomparable achievements,&quot; most notably her work on <em>Yentl</em>, the first first full-length feature directed, acted, written and produced by an American woman.</p>

<p>The gala is Monday, April 22, 2013, and you <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508173429/https://secure.filmlinc.com/page/signup/40th-chaplin-award-gala-signup">can sign up for ticket info here</a>. Last year, tickets for the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508173429/http://www.filmlinc.com/blog/entry/last-night-at-the-film-society-catherine-deneuve-at-the-chaplin-award">Catherine Deneuve tribute</a> were $175 and $325, as well as more expensive tickets that include a gala dinner. &#x2014; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508173429/https://twitter.com/jenchung"><em>Jen Chung</em></a></p>

<p><strong>MANHATTAN COCKTAIL CLASSIC OPENING NIGHT GALA</strong>: New York City is full of places to sip alcoholic beverages in, but few as grand as the main branch of the New York Public Library. Add dozens of mixologists at the top of their game and hundreds of swells dressed to the nines and you have one of our favorite events of the year. Each year the Classic kicks off by filling the library with entertainment, tasty eats and, of course, custom bars chock full of cocktails. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508173429/http://www.manhattancocktailclassic.com/events_and_tickets.html">Classic</a> runs May 17-21 this year and though tickets prices have not been announced yet, in previous years they have been around $150&#x2014;which seems pricey until you factor in that it&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508173429/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/15/no_one_fell_down_the_stairs_and_bro.php">four hours of open bar, plus other excitement</a>, in a stately setting where for once you won&apos;t be hushed. Trust us! &#x2014; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508173429/https://twitter.com/garthj"><em>Garth Johnston</em></a></p>

<p><em>The Manhattan Cocktail Classic Gala takes place at the Main Branch of the New York Public Library, which is located at 11 W 40th Street.</em></p>

<p><strong>THE MOTH BALL</strong>: Every year The Moth podcast we listen to religiously jumps out of our earbuds, and their reading series takes a break from its typically humble stages to dress up for the night. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508173429/http://gothamist.com/tags/themothball">The annual Moth Ball</a>, held by the non-profit storytelling organization The Moth, has been called &quot;the hippest literary gala&quot;&#x2014;and it is, in the best way possible. The Ball is usually held at Capitale on the Bowery, and each year dons a new theme, and invites new storytellers, new honorees (last year was Martin Scorsese), and a bunch of big names in the music, film, and literary world. There are two ticket prices: for the Gala Dinner and party it costs $350, and for the Gala Party and Show it costs $195&#x2014;open bars will be enjoyed with each. &#x2014; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508173429/https://twitter.com/jenist"><em>Jen Carlson</em></a></p>

<p><strong>DINER EN BLANC</strong>: </p>

<p>New York has its share of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508173429/http://gothamist.com/tags/santacon">low-brow,</a> mass displays of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508173429/http://gothamist.com/tags/nopantssubwayride">debauched conformity,</a> but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508173429/http://newyork.dinerenblanc.info/">Diner En Blanc</a> is exceptional for its elegance and genuine element of surprise. Diners register for a space, wait for the date of the event to arrive, and are only told where they&apos;ll be eating with 3,400 other friends 30 minutes prior to dinner time. Everyone agrees to wear white so that the shared public space (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508173429/http://gothamist.com/2012/08/21/photos_diner_en_blanc_1.php#photo-1">last year</a> it was the Lincoln Center, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508173429/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/26/photos_diner_en_blanc.php#photo-1">the year before,</a> Battery Park City) is thoroughly transformed. You&apos;ll need to bring your own food&#x2014;this is a picnic, after all&#x2014;but alcohol is provided for purchase (a bottle of wine will run you $18) and musical performances accompany the meal. By the end of the evening, you&apos;ll have kicked off your white shoes and sung &quot;New York, New York&quot; with the nice group who shared their olives and Manchego with you. &#x2014; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508173429/https://twitter.com/christrobbins"><em>Chris Robbins</em></a></p>
