<p>One fateful night, a woman named Teressa Bellissimo deep fried some chicken wings, slathered them in hot sauce and served them to a group of hungry young men when they&apos;d come back from the bar. Or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150530045732/https://www.anchorbar.com/original.php">so the legend goes</a> at Buffalo&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150530045732/https://www.anchorbar.com/">Anchor Bar</a>, which has been credited with inventing the bar staple Buffalo Chicken Wings. </p>

<p>These fiery fried flappers celebrate their 50th birthday today, and what better way to pay tribute than to eat some of your own. Traveling to Buffalo this late in the game would be tricky, but here are a few time-tested options to get your wing fix:</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150530045732/http://www.thewingbar.com/">The Wing Bar</a></strong>: The name says it all, but more specifically: snag 10 mild, medium or hot wings for $9. &apos;Nuff said. <em>275 Smith Street, 718-237-2728</em></p>

<p><strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150530045732/http://www.lansdowneroadnyc.com/">Lansdowne Road</a></strong>: Hell&apos;s Kitchen&apos;s large bar population means Buffalo wings on every corner, but Lansdowne wins <em>hands down</em> for their spicy, salty offerings. Wings run $10 for 10, $19 for 20 in traditional mild, medium and hot varieties. <em>599 10th Avenue, 212-239-8020</em></p>

<p><strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150530045732/http://www.rathbonesnyc.com/">Rathbones Pub</a></strong>: For a bar with sawdust on the floor, this Upper East Side fixture turns out some ridiculous good pub grub. Namely, their popular Buffalo Wings, which come in large ($9.95) and small ($6.95) sizes depending on one&apos;s appetite. It won&apos;t help you for tonight, but swing by on Wednesdays when wings are just $.25 and cheap Coors Light flows freely. <em>1702 2nd Avenue, 212-369-7361</em></p>
