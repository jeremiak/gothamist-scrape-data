<p>After 16 years on Lafayette Street, Irish stalwart Puck Fair in SoHo will pouring its final pint at the end of the month. A tipster with inside information told Gothamist that the bar &quot;received word that the time has come&quot; and they&apos;d be forced to shut their doors after service on March 27th following an obligatory 45 day warning period that the bar received from the building&apos;s owner. The building, of course, will be demolished&#x2014;gotta make more room for those <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021104344/http://gothamist.com/2015/08/21/ball_pit_germ_pool.php#photo-1">artisanal ball pits</a>!</p>

<p>The tipster tells us that the bar has been operating on a month-to-month lease for the past two years and that the ousting is &quot;not really a huge surprise.&quot; Puck Fair, along with the neighboring BP gas station that was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021104344/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/11/apparently_sohos_bp_gas_station.php">marked for demolition</a> in 2013, will be torn down to make way for seven stories&apos; worth of office and retail space. The owners, who also run bars including nearby Swift and Ulysses in the Financial District, may open another Puck Fair location in the future.</p>

<p>The bar is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021104344/https://www.facebook.com/events/837011989755016/">throwing a goodbye party</a> on Friday, March 25th.</p>
