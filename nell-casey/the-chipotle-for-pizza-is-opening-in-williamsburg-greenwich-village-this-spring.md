<p>This isn&apos;t the ideal time to compare oneself to a struggling business dealing with the fallout of a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170420091409/http://gothamist.com/2016/09/10/chipotles_spent_the_past_6_months_s.php">large public health crisis</a>, but a California pizza chain that dubs itself the &quot;Chipotle for pizza&quot; has signed leases for two NYC locations to open this spring. Granted, they&apos;re referring more to the &quot;quick yet not crappy&quot; model of nouveau fast food&#x2014;not the food-borne illness that sickened people across the country&#x2014;but still.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170420091409/http://www.pieology.com/">Pieology</a> will open restaurants in Williamsburg and Greenwich Village, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170420091409/https://therealdeal.com/2017/04/12/custom-pizza-chain-pieology-signs-for-first-two-nyc-shops/">according to the Real Deal</a>. The &quot;fast-bake&quot; chain, which has 135 stores across the United States, will open first in a retail condo at 168 Bleecker Street, followed by a location inside a brand new rental unit at 285 Broadway in Williamsburg. </p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="041317pie2.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170420091409im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_nellcasey/041317pie2.jpg" width="640" height="480"> <br> <i> A Pieology in Raleigh, NC (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170420091409/https://www.yelp.com/biz/pieology-pizzeria-raleigh-3">Yelp</a>)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>In addition to baking up the pies quick, damn quick, the chain employs the choose-your-own-adventure model of modern dining. Diners design their own pies&#x2014;including the type of crust and sauce&#x2014;from a selection of 40 different cheeses, meats and veggies and &quot;after bakes,&quot; sauces like pesto and bbq that are applied after the oven. There are also pre-designed pizzas that range from simple mozzarella to &quot;Alfredo&apos;s Alfredo&quot; with a whopping 10 ingredients. </p>

<p>On first glance, the pies seem to have a lot in common with the &quot;bar pie,&quot; with thin, crisp crusts about the size for one person to devour easily in one sitting. (I&apos;m so, so sorry, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170420091409/http://gothamist.com/2014/08/21/bar_pies_adam_kuban.php">Adam Kuban</a>.) Prices in other parts of the country hover around $9 for a customized pizza.</p>

<p>In 2015, Pieology was declared the &quot;fastest-growing restaurant in America&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170420091409/http://www.businessinsider.com/pieology-pizza-business-story-and-expansion-2015-6">by Business Insider</a>, and founder Carl Chang has grown the business more than two-fold in the intervening years, with plans for 70 more locations to open in 2017 alone. </p>

<p>Chang, who has either never set foot in New York City or is willfully ignorant about our pizza practices here, declared that &quot;pizza for us was somewhat broken...[it] used to be a celebration when you were with family and friends ... now it somewhat has become a bit more [of a] convenience food or a coupon food if you will.&quot;</p>

<p>There&apos;s nothing wrong with a little <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170420091409/http://gothamist.com/2017/03/09/best_frozen_pizza_2017.php">convenience pizza</a>, but be careful throwing around the word &quot;broken&quot; now that you&apos;re <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170420091409/http://gothamist.com/tags/pizza/">entering the NYC pizza gauntlet</a>. </p>
