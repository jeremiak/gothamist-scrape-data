<p>Exercise: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110105132/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/02/new_trend_exercise_is_destroying_ma.php">bad for your marriage</a>, great for your drinking problem! It&apos;s looking like hitting up the treadmill for a few hours each week has health benefits that include eliminating an increased cancer risk for people who drink alcohol. Time to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110105132/http://gothamist.com/2015/11/17/crunning_down_a_dream.php">take up Crunning</a>.</p>

<p>An <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110105132/http://bjsm.bmj.com/content/early/2016/07/04/bjsports-2016-096194">observational study</a> by the British Journal of Sports Medicine found that exercising the recommended 150 minutes per week &quot;appeared to wipe off completely&quot; the increased cancer death risk that&apos;s associated with alcohol consumption. &quot;Similar physical activity also offset the increased risk of all-cause mortality linked to drinking,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110105132/http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/07/health/exercise-alcohol-and-death-risk/index.html">according to CNN</a>. &quot;Exercising more provided slightly better results.&quot;</p>

<p>The study tracked individuals classified as &quot;hazardous&quot; drinkers; women who drank between 8 and 20 alcoholic beverages and men who drank 21 to 49 per week. Unfortunately, those who drank more than that did not see the same benefits from exercise. </p>

<p>As the study&apos;s an &quot;observational&quot; one that did not take into account factors like other lifestyle choices and medications, researchers can only &quot;suggest a relationship&quot; between alcohol and exercise. But it&apos;s not like exercise doesn&apos;t have a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110105132/http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/fitness/in-depth/exercise/art-20048389">million other benefits</a> so <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110105132/http://gothamist.com/2014/09/07/video_woman_performs_subway_calisth.php">employ your preferred method</a> of physical activity and maybe <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110105132/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/19/coffee_alcoholics_liver_yay.php">chug a few cups of coffee</a> for good measure.</p>
