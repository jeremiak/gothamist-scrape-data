<p>Since foods with a high glycemic index may <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171101223221/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/08/all_those_bagels_might_be_giving_yo.php">up your chances for lung cancer</a>, among many other ailments, perhaps it&apos;s finally time to think a little bit more critically about that Pepsi-a-day habit. At least that&apos;s part of the thinking by one city council member, who has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171101223221/http://www.capitalnewyork.com/sites/default/files/DOC001.PDF">proposed warning posters</a> at restaurants that would explain the dangers of high sugar and carbohydrate content in dishes. Because this type of signage has been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171101223221/http://gothamist.com/2015/11/04/numbers_are_theoretical_anyway.php">so successful in the past</a>...</p>

<p>The proposed legislation comes from Inez Barron, a Brooklyn Democrat, who explains that the city has an &quot;obligation&quot; to tell city residents about hidden food dangers, &quot;just as we know that when people see calorie counts they have the ability to make an informed decision,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171101223221/http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/city-hall/2016/03/8593104/council-bill-would-require-restaurant-warnings-sugar-and-carbs">she told Politico New York</a>. The city Health Department says it&apos;s mulling over the move, pointing to stats that show that one-in-five New Yorkers are pre-diabetic and an estimated 700,000 currently have diabetes. </p>

<p>Of course, there&apos;s already uproar from the National Restaurant Association, among others, who&apos;ve already <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171101223221/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/01/salt_wars.php">fought hard</a> against similar proposals regarding salt content. &quot;New York City has changed nanny state from a noun to a verb,&quot; NRA spokesperson Christin Fernandez told Politico. &quot;This is &apos;nanny stating&apos; at its very worst...a poster on a wall is no way to improve public health.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171101223221/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/20/guerilla_subway_etiquette_posters_d.php">Ain&apos;t that the truth</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong> The Health Department issued the following statement regarding the proposed legislation: &quot;As diabetes is a growing concern in New York City, especially in communities of color, Council Member Barron&#x2019;s concern is admirable. We are currently reviewing the bill.&quot;</p>
