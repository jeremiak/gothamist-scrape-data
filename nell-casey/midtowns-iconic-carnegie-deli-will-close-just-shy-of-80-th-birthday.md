<p>The recently embattled Carnegie Deli will <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108043641/http://gothamist.com/2016/09/11/carnegie_deli_challenges_models_to.php">retire its monstrous sandwiches</a> and close at the end of the year, just shy of the iconic eatery&apos;s 80th birthday. The shutter, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108043641/http://nypost.com/2016/09/30/carnegie-deli-will-close-at-end-of-2016/">first reported by the NY Post</a>, comes after a tumultuous couple of years at the restaurant that included a divorce, lawsuits and a temporary shutter following an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108043641/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/03/carnegie_deli_vows_return_following.php">illegal gas hookup</a>. </p>

<p>&quot;At this stage of my life, the early mornings to late nights have taken a toll, along with my sleepless nights and grueling hours that come with operating a restaurant business,&quot; Marian Harper Levine, whose family has owned the business since 1976, told the Post. </p>

<p>The restaurant&apos;s 60 employees were allegedly informed just this morning about the closure. &quot;They called us all in, but not everyone showed,&quot; a porter <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108043641/https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20160930/midtown/carnegie-deli-close-at-end-of-year-employees-say">told DNAinfo</a>. &quot;They just said they were gonna close Dec. 31. They didn&#x2019;t give us a reason.&quot;</p>

<p>Though Levine owns the building that&apos;s housed the restaurant since 1937, it&apos;s likely financial burden from recent legal entanglements played a role in the shutter. Multiple <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108043641/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/18/carnegie_deli_owner_suing_husband_o.php">lawsuits</a> had been filed regarding wage theft, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108043641/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/18/theft_accusations_pile_on_adulterou.php">recipe theft</a>, and ultimately a divorce from Levine&apos;s husband Sandy, who had allegedly been having an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108043641/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/18/theft_accusations_pile_on_adulterou.php">affair with a waitress</a> at the restaurant. </p>

<p>In the spring of 2015, Con Edison inspectors discovered <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108043641/http://gothamist.com/2015/04/25/carnegie_deli_shuttered_over_allege.php">improper gas piping</a> installed in the Midtown eatery&apos;s basement, which closed Carnegie down for nine months and left residents in the building without heat and gas for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108043641/https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20160105/times-square-theater-district/carnegie-deli-upstairs-tenats-finally-get-heat-hot-water-restored">nearly as long</a>. </p>

<p>In the future, Hillary Clinton would have to travel to the Las Vegas or Pennsylvania outposts of Carnegie, which will remain open, to watch Stephen Colbert <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108043641/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/19/colbert_clinton_cheesecake.php">eat cheesecake</a>. Others in search of mediocre, overpriced and overrated food will have to look elsewhere in midtown. </p>
