<p>While many of our <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171101071327/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/24/fairway_closing_long_island.php">home-grown grocers</a> are scaling back their operations, Trader Joe&apos;s and its <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171101071327/http://gothamist.com/2014/10/01/pumpkin_trader_joes.php#photo-1">global</a> and reasonably-priced foods are in the midst of an expansion, including a new LES location set to open in 2018. The store will touch down at 145 Clinton Street, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171101071327/http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20161004/REAL_ESTATE/161009962/trader-joes-is-coming-to-the-lower-east-side-in-2018">Crains reports</a>, taking up valuable retail space inside the Essex Crossing project, slated for the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171101071327/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/02/extell_tower_les_chinatown.php">south side of Delancey</a>. </p>

<p>The arrival of the store will bring <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171101071327/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/02/extell_tower_les_chinatown.php">a much-needed supermarket</a> to the nearby Two Bridges neighborhood, one of many <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171101071327/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/11/mobile_produce_trucks_roll_into_cit.php#photo-1">food deserts</a> in the city. Additionally, half of the 211 apartments in the Clinton Street building will be dedicated to affordable housing, as will half of the complete Essex Crossing project.</p>

<p>When City Point finally debuts, Downtown Brooklyn will <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171101071327/http://gothamist.com/2015/09/17/trader_joes_downtown_brooklyn.php">have a Trader Joe&apos;s</a>, too, as will the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171101071327/http://gothamist.com/2016/05/28/uwsers_rejoice_second_trader_joes_w.php">Upper West Side</a> sometime in 2017 and Williamsburg <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171101071327/http://gothamist.com/2015/07/09/trader_joes_williamsburg.php">sometime in the future</a>. Crains notes there are 11 different Trader Joe&apos;s entities&#x2014;including grocery stores and wine shops&#x2014;slated for NYC in the coming years. Get ready for a lot of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171101071327/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/21/grandma_sues_trader_joes_after_gett.php">screaming banshees</a>. </p>
