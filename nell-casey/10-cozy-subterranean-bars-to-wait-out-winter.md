---

	
										<p><em>The winds are howling, the mercury has dipped below freezing and the thought of venturing outside fills you with dread. Instead of hibernating in your apartment, hunker down where the winds can&apos;t reach you in one of the city&apos;s cute underground watering holes. From intimate and romantic to divey and boisterous, these subterranean sanctuaries offer refuge from the frigid winter weather for whatever suits your mood. This is just a start; let us know your favs in the comments.</em> </p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="010214tradingpost7.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429122225im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_nellcasey/010214tradingpost7.jpg" width="640" height="426"> <br> <i> <span class="photo_caption">Downstairs at Trading Post (Courtesy of the restaurant)</span></i></div> <p></p>

<p><strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429122225/http://www.tradingpostnyc.com/">Trading Post</a></strong>: The Seaport struggled post-Sandy, with many of the neighborhood&apos;s bars and restaurants shuttered in the wake of the storm. Luckily, a handsome new bar and restaurant called Trading Post <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429122225/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/03/inside_trading_post_a_beautiful_new.php#photo-3">opened this summer</a>, offering working stiffs and locals a nice watering hold to relax in. The upstairs restaurant is lovely, but it&apos;s the dark, sexy, below ground bar that sings during this time of year. It&apos;s a great place to take advantage of the bar&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429122225/http://www.tradingpostnyc.com/#!menus/c14zr">sizable whiskey selection</a> while you sit on one of the sleek leather chairs. They offer upscale pub grub down there too, like Flatbreads ($14) topped with sausage, broccoli rabe and garlic or spicy shrimp with tomatillo, avocado and cilantro. </p>

<p><em>Trading Post is located at 170 John Street between Front and South Streets, (646) 370-3337; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429122225/http://www.tradingpostnyc.com/">tradingpostnyc.com</a></em></p>

<p><strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429122225/http://www.sakebardecibel.com/">Sake Bar Decibel</a></strong>: For over 20 years this divey sake bar has held court in the East Village, drawing crowds for its unpretentious atmosphere to sip sake and shochu. It&apos;s tiny, meaning you should expect to feel a little packed in on busy nights, but that&apos;s exactly what makes it so cozy in the first place. The decor toes the line between authentic Japanese watering hole and grungy graffiti-flecked alley; just try to find a clean inch of wall space that hasn&apos;t been tagged up. They&apos;re known for the sake selection, natch, but if you&apos;re not down with fermented rice they also offer Japanese beers, cocktails like lychee martinis and even some Japanese whiskies. </p>

Pull back the velvet curtain and descend into a 16th-century style British pub decked out in tons of wood, a cozy low ceiling and a mock fireplace. Drinks center around British brews, including 15 beers on tap and 3 cask ales from top producers across the pond; the pub snacks are top notch, especially the Pumpkin on toast with English cheddar and fish and chips. If you&apos;re lucky, you&apos;ll score a seat in the Snug: a private booth just off the bar with a convenient window to order more drinks and grub. </p>
