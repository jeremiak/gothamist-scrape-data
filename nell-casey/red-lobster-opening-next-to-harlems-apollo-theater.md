<p>Earlier this year Harlem <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203074605/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/25/joes_crab_shack_opening_first_nyc_l.php">got crabs</a>, and now the neighborhood welcomes another crustacean crazy chain restaurant to the tank with the opening of a new Red Lobster directly next door to the &apos;hood&apos;s hallowed Apollo Theater. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203074605/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/uptown/red-lobster-set-harlem-debut-apollo-theater-article-1.1477264">The Daily News reports</a> that fishing season begins November 11th at the new 125th Street eatery, which takes over an enormous three-story space to serve its Admiral&apos;s Feast and other seafood-centric dishes. </p>

<p>But not everybody is ready to see food differently. &#x201C;Twenty years ago, this was Black Harlem. Now they&#x2019;re raising the rent in Harlem so people can&#x2019;t afford it,&#x201D; bemoans local Mohamad Pullum. &quot;We made Harlem, and now it is being taken over by corporate companies like Red Lobster, Gap, Starbucks.&quot; Other chains like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203074605/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/09/midnight_in_pancakes_harlem_ihop_op.php">iHop</a> and Duane Reade also occupy prime real estate on the famed street, which has begun to resemble Times Square more and more in the past decade. </p>

<p>Regardless of your <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203074605/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/23/ask_a_native_new_yorker_how_guilty.php">position on gentrification</a>, nobody except the invasive chains and lazy tourists celebrate the homogenization of our historic neighborhoods. Luckily, if you&apos;re willing to leave the main drag, there are still <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203074605/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/24/a_food_drink_tour_of_harlem.php#photo-1">plenty of independently-owned restaurants</a> and other shops bucking the corporate trend. That said, those Cheddar Bay Biscuits are pretty dope.</p>
