title: Watch Out For Flying Debris: High Wind Warning Issued For NYC
---

	
										<p>Mother Nature&apos;s feeling spicy today and has weaponized the air to tear chunks out of glass buildings and topple roofs at gas stations. A high wind watch issued yesterday has just been upgraded to a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170216002500/http://www1.nyc.gov/site/em/resources/notify_nyc/weather-20.page">High Wind Warning</a>, with potential wind gusts reaching 60 miles per hour and sustained winds between 25 and 35 mph through 6 p.m. this evening. </p>

<p>Earlier today, the canopy at a Queens Gulf gas station collapsed, apparently after being levitated by a strong blast of wind. </p>

<p>And in the Financial District this morning, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170216002500/https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20170213/financial-district/falling-glass-hilton-hotel-church-street">glass rained down</a> from the Millennium Hilton onto Church Street below, possibly after an airborne object struck the building. </p>

<p>&quot;During periods of high winds, residents should use caution when walking or driving profile vehicles,&quot; the city&apos;s notification email warns. &quot;Winds at these speeds can cause flying debris, turn unsecured objects into projectiles, and cause power outages.&quot;</p>

<p>Construction sites can be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170216002500/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/03/high_wind_warning.php">particularly vulnerable</a> in high wind incidents&#x2014;the DOB has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170216002500/http://www1.nyc.gov/site/buildings/about/pr-weather-advisory-021217.page">issued warnings</a> contractors and crane operators&#x2014;and local airports are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170216002500/http://nypost.com/2017/02/13/massive-wind-gusts-will-turn-nyc-into-the-windy-city/">experiencing intermittent delays</a> due<small></small> to the strong winds. </p>

<p>Anything can become a projectile under these conditions; something to keep in mind as you pass your local <strike>rat cafe</strike> trash can.</p>
