<p>It seems there are a few more restaurant obituaries to write in the dregs of 2016, the latest of which, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170911210727/http://dasilvano.com/">Da Silvano</a>, served its last meal yesterday evening in Greenwich Village. The celebrity hotspot and longtime Italian favorite closed last night, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170911210727/http://nypost.com/2016/12/21/legendary-eatery-da-silvano-closed-forever/">the Post reports</a>, with owner Silvano Marchetto blaming rising operating costs including rent that&apos;d risen from $500 a month when the eatery opened in 1975 to $41,000 a month today. </p>

<p>At last year&apos;s 40th birthday celebration, Marchetto noted the dramatic rent increase, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170911210727/http://www.wsj.com/articles/new-yorks-da-silvano-restaurant-celebrates-40-years-1430701284">told the Wall Street Journal</a> he&apos;d &quot;be here all [his] life.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Da Silvano, which received two stars in The New York Times from Ruth Reichl in 1998, has been around for more than three decades,&quot; wrote <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170911210727/http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/27/dining/reviews/27rest.html">Frank Bruni in a 2006 review</a>. &quot;Over that time it has evolved from a trailblazing showcase for unadorned Tuscan cooking to something of a downtown Elaine&apos;s, with a proprietor, Silvano Marchetto, practiced at coddling stars and manufacturing his own luster.&quot;</p>

<p>In addition to being a well-loved <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170911210727/https://twitter.com/RihannaReplay/status/807879655042781184">hangout for celebrities</a>, the restaurant garnered a fair bit of controversy, from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170911210727/http://gothamist.com/2015/06/06/waiters_at_da_silvano_suing_owner_o.php">recent wage theft allegations</a>, to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170911210727/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/19/da_silvano_owner_accused_of_repeate.php">sexual assault lawsuits</a> against Marchetto that were ultimately <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170911210727/http://nypost.com/2013/09/16/famed-da-silvano-eatery-owner-settles-sex-harass-suit/">settled out of court</a>. </p>
