<p>Sandwiches&#x2014;aren&apos;t they just <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140209095605/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/13/word_to_the_wise_plane.php">the bomb</a>? Filmmaker and food fanatic <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140209095605/http://cargocollective.com/serrini">Roberto Serrini</a> thinks so, and he&apos;s created a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140209095605/https://vimeo.com/channels/mmas/videos">series of videos</a> of NYC chefs casually making sandwiches in their kitchens to prove it. </p>

<p>Watch as the crew behind Jeepney makes a Filipino-style banh mi; Joe Dobias of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140209095605/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/20/joe_missesdoe.php#photo-1">Joe and Misses Doe</a> assembles his version of a Cubano; and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140209095605/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/22/new_italian_pantry.php">Sara Jenkins</a> does her classic Porchetta sandwich. We also learn that Jeremy Spector&#x2014;Brindle Room chef and co-partner of the series&#x2014;eats Everything Bagel Grilled Cheese sandwiches for breakfast; sadly, he has yet to make a How To video.</p>

<p>But there are plenty of other creative sandwiches on hand, plus some insight into why the humble sandwich is so beloved. Many of the chefs say sandwiches are their main source of sustenance due to their portability and ease of construction during hectic shifts in the kitchen. Others cite childhood memories as reasons for returning to the sandwich time and again. Either way, the end results and delicious and after watching a few of these videos you&apos;ll be hungry for a second lunch.</p>

<p>We reached out to Serrini to ask what prompted this devotion to stackable foods and his favorite from the ongoing series: </p>

<p><strong>What prompted you to begin this series?</strong> I live in the East Village, and I had done a film about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140209095605/https://vimeo.com/channels/seriouseats">Jeremy Spector&apos;s Brindle Room</a> because it&apos;s one of my favorite places to eat, and their hamburger is hands down the best in the world. Period. Jeremy and I became good friends and one night over some awesome Chicken Sandwich he whipped up we came up with the idea to just go around to places we liked, and chefs we knew, and ask them to make us a sandwich. Simple as that.</p>

<p><strong>Why sandwiches?</strong> Sandwiches are like puppies; everyone likes them. It&apos;s universal, and it&apos;s something that I think isn&apos;t really explored as much as it could be. Every culture has it&apos;s own sandwich, and every person has their favorite one. It&apos;s as personal and as simple really as &quot;what&apos;s your favorite color&quot; but to me it is a lot more telling. Also, I wanted to know what chefs were eating at home. What their favorite sandwich was to make, not necessarily what is on the menu at their restaurant. It&apos;s deliciously personal on some level.</p>

<p><strong>Were there any sandwiches in the series that really surprised you?</strong> Sure. I mean a Falafulnutter&apos;? C&apos;mon&#x2026; where you gonna see that anywhere?</p>

<p><strong>What&apos;s your go-to sandwich to make for yourself?</strong> Now you&apos;re getting personal. When I think sandwiches, I always think of my ma and pop, who every time I leave make me 2-3  prosciutto &amp; mozzarella jobs with mayo to take on the plane home. Being Italian it&apos;s hard to sway from the classics, and the nostalgia is also very tasty. </p>

<p><strong>Which sandwich in the series was your favorite?</strong> Sandwiches are like children, they are all my favorite. That being said Wade Mose&apos;s Sausage Destroyer was kinda epic.</p>

<p><strong>Do you have any plans to make more videos with different chefs? </strong> You can&apos;t stop the Sandwich Train. You can&apos;t. It&apos;s a lot of fun to do, and the Chef&apos;s like it because it&apos;s easy to shoot and they get to show a side of them I think is not often seen. Our method is to film in their real kitchens and capturing whatever happens. This is not reality television; there&apos;s no lighting set-ups or scripts, and coming from a commercial production background it&apos;s refreshing to shoot this way. But we have our scopes set for the stars. I mean, what&apos;s a sandwich without an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140209095605/http://thebrewhahashow.com/">amazing craft beer</a>.</p>

<p>Check out the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140209095605/https://vimeo.com/channels/mmas/videos">rest of the sandwich videos here</a> and get a little inspiration for tomorrow&apos;s brown bag.</p>
