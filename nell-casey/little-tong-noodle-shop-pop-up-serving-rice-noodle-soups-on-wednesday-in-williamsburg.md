<p>Before she opens her Little Tong restaurant next month in the East Village, chef Simone Tong hosts the last in a series of four pop-up dinners this Wednesday in Williamsburg. At the meal, Tong will serve Yunnan-style rice noodles (mixian) in a variety of broths, in addition to &quot;little eats&quot; and &quot;little sweets.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;It&apos;s a little bit special because it&apos;s rice noodles,&quot; Tong <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170910063846/https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20170210/east-village/little-tong-noodle-shop-pop-up-restaurant-opening">explained to DNAInfo</a>. &quot;When people think of noodles, it&apos;s usually wheat based&#x2014;it&apos;s not so popular in New York yet, but it&apos;s old-school and very popular in China.&quot;</p>
