title: Truffle Madness Has Begun! Here's Where To Get Them
---

	
										<p><em>Now that you <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150328133336/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/14/truffles.php">know what you&apos;re getting yourself into</a>, it&apos;s time to get out there and enjoy the season&apos;s most decadent food enhancer: the truffle. This season&apos;s bounty far exceeds <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150328133336/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/15/truffle_season_arrives_at_nycs_top.php">last year&apos;s small harvest</a>, meaning there are a multitude of restaurants offering dishes of all flavors and price points featuring the fragrant fungi.</em></p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="101413truffle_main.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150328133336im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_nellcasey/101413truffle_main.jpg" width="640" height="426"> <br> <i> <span class="photo_caption">Truffle Burger from B&amp;B;</span></i></div> <p></p>

<p>To experience a truffle umami bomb look no further than <strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150328133336/http://www.burgerandbarrel.com/">B&amp;B;</a></strong>, where chef Josh Capon truly gilds the lilly with his white truffle burger ($56): a juicy patty comes topped with gooey Robiola cheese, a thick slathering of truffle aioli and then a heavy shaving of white truffles. The restaurant also offers shaved white truffles atop their steak tartare, raviolo with a soft egg and spinach and ricotta &amp; homemade gnocchi with mushrooms for an additional supplement. </p>

<p>The Batali empire wouldn&apos;t ever miss out on the season and the chef offers a number of delicious dishes at his restaurants. Over at <strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150328133336/http://www.delposto.com/">Del Posto</a></strong>, white truffles come atop the beef Carne Gruda, Ricotta Gnudi and Luna Piena. At <strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150328133336/http://www.babbonyc.com/">Babbo</a></strong>, white truffle shavings can be supplemented on any dish or you can find them in the Duck Egg Sunny-Side Up ($80) with Guanciale and White Truffles or the Pappardelle ($120) with White Truffles and Parmigiano. Finally, you can order up a decadent White Truffle Pizza at <strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150328133336/http://www.ottopizzeria.com/home.cfm">Otto</a></strong>.</p>

<p>Chef Jesse Schenker of <strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150328133336/http://recettenyc.com/">Recette</a></strong> keeps things simple, shaving 4 grams of fresh white truffles atop Fresh Cut Spaghetti with butter and parmesan for $60. This decadent offering rings in lower than lots of other options around town, so it&apos;s a great bet for first timers or the budget-conscious. </p>

<p>At his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150328133336/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/21/a_look_at_chef_shaun_hergatts_imagi.php">newly opened</a> restaurant <strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150328133336/http://www.juninyc.com/">Juni</a></strong>, chef Shaun Hergatt dishes out a creamy Pommes Puree with gold potato crisps and Black Salsify Agnolotto in a parmesan cream sauce both topped with shaved white truffles for $90. </p>

<p><strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150328133336/http://www.avocerestaurant.com/columbus/">A Voce Columbus&apos;</a></strong> unaffected Italian fare meshes perfectly with truffles, which are best when left as close to their natural state as possible. For $85 you can get a generous shaving of white truffles atop on any of the dishes, but the chef recommends either the Fettucine with butter and cracked pepper, a side of creamy polenta ($9) or any of the restaurant&apos;s steaks.</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="101513sirio.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150328133336im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_arts_john/101513sirio.jpeg" width="640" height="426"> <br> <i> The risotto with shaved black truffles at Sirio.</i></div> <p></p>

<p><strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150328133336/http://siriony.com/menu/">Sirio</a></strong>, the tranquil mod restaurant in the luxuriant Pierre Hotel, has a new fall menu from their new talented new Executive Chef, Massimo Bebber. This place is<em> not cheap</em>, but it&apos;s about what you&apos;d expect to find in the rarefied stratosphere of Fifth Avenue across the street from Central Park. Bebber recently invited Gothamist to a press preview of his new fall menu, and we were particularly impressed with the Capesante con Funghi: Seared Maine sea scallops, chanterelles pur&#xE9;e, roasted wild mushrooms, black truffle sauce. Obviously that&apos;s a fresh &amp; real black truffle sauce, not some <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150328133336/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/14/truffles.php">ersatz truffle oil</a> simulacrum, which, for $39, it better be. The sauce is a rich but not overpowering compliment to the scallops, which are fat and fresh and succulent. </p>

<p>There is also a deliciously smooth Saffron Risotto with shrimp, spinach, green Peas, and tomato concass&#xE9;e&#x2014;if your sugar daddy or rich uncle happens to be feeling flush, Chef Bebber will emerge from the kitchen and personally shave white truffles on top to the tune of $150. Yes, $150 is the total price for the dish with the white truffle shavings, but if you want to slum it with black truffles it&apos;s just $55! Please note the &quot;Madness&quot; in the headline of this post and decide how craaaaazy you or your benefactors really are. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, Laurent Tourondel&apos;s UES hybrid sushi and steakhouse <strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150328133336/http://arlingtonclubny.com/">Arlington Club</a></strong> shaves up truffles tableside atop his Truffled Cauliflower &amp; Fontina Pot Pie ($75). Servers crack the puff pastry dome and shave the white truffles into the steaming insides to gently warm through.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150328133336/http://www.rougetomatenyc.com/">Rouge Tomate&apos;s</a></strong> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150328133336/http://gothamist.com/2008/10/30/rouge_tomate.php#photo-1">beautifully designed</a> dining space is second only to their beautifully crafted and delicious food, especially when it&apos;s topped with freshly shaved truffles. This season the UES restaurant offers Cow&apos;s Milk Ricotta Gnudi ($22), doughy pillows swimming in a fragrant mushroom broth with chanterelles, truffle and wax beans. The dish gets finished with a dusting of truffle and parmesan shavings.</p>

<p>Through October 30th, experience a truffle tasting menu inside the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150328133336/http://gothamist.com/2010/12/15/asellina_gansevoort_park_hotel.php#photo-1">Gansevoort&apos;s Park Avenue restaurant</a> <strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150328133336/http://togrp.com/togrp-asellina/">Asellina</a></strong>. For a very reasonable $55 you get three truffle-infused courses, including seared scallops with winter truffle and a truffle risotto with porcini and sottocenere. </p>

<p>Scrambled eggs and truffles are a match made in taste bud heaven and chef David Bouley offers the duo at his eponymous <strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150328133336/http://www.davidbouley.com/">Bouley</a></strong>, folding in the creamy eggs with Comte cheese and topping them with shaved black truffles (MP). He&apos;s also offering a savory Porcini Flan with black truffles (MP) and at sister restaurant <strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150328133336/http://www.davidbouley.com/brushstroke-main/">Brushstroke</a></strong>, Executive Chef Isao Yamada dishes up his version of truffle-and-egg with a Shimeji Mushroom Chawan-mushi Egg Custard with Truffle Ankake Sauce and Provence black truffle slices.</p>

<p>At Midtown&apos;s expansive yet homey <strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150328133336/http://www.e2hospitality.com/casa-nonna/">Casa Nonna</a></strong> they&apos;re bringing the highbrow lowbrow, topping a thin-crust buffalo mozzarella cheese pizza with house-made (read: <em>real</em>) truffle oil, finished off with sliced Burgundy truffles from Northern Italy when the Black Truffle Pizza ($44) leaves the oven. They&apos;re also offering a Tajarin al Tartufo ($46)&#x2014;egg tagliolini pasta with truffle butter, parmesan and shaved black truffles&#x2014;and Finocchio Risotto ($48), made with fennel, chanterelles and finished with shaved black truffles.</p>

<p>The BLT empire enters the truffle game at their Gramercy outpost <strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150328133336/http://www.e2hospitality.com/blt-prime-new-york/">BLT Prime</a></strong>, where they&apos;re offering a 5-course prix fixe menu ($200) loaded with the fragrant fungi. Start with White Bruschetta with savory mangalitsa lardo, fontina and garlic confit and a 62.7 Degree Farm Egg, served atop potato gnocchi with a crisp parmesan tulie. For the main course, Black Sea Bass gets prepared en papillote, with local cauliflower, young leeks and albufera sauce while Wild Scottish Partridge gets autumnally-flavored with pancetta, savoy cabbage chips and apple cider jus. Finish the meal with Fried Ice Cream &quot;Truffles&quot; with dulce de leche, sea salt and corn flakes. </p>
