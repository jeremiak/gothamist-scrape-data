<p>More details have been announced for Smogasburg/Brooklyn Flea&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509140856/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/03/smorgasburg.php">new winter residence</a> in Williamsburg. Instead of wintering over at Skylight One Hanson as in previous years, the growing market takes over a 50,000 square foot warehouse space at 80 North 5th Street at Wythe. Lots of the mainstays will be on hand for the indoor iteration, including Red Hook Lobster Pound, who&apos;ve added a Lobster BLT and Maine Blueberry Pancakes to the menu; Landhaus with a braised shortrib sandwich; and Ramen Burger, with creator Keizo Shiamoto adding some beef chashu along with his popular burger.</p>

<p>Due to smoke and ventilation restrictions imposed by the space, there won&apos;t be any deep frying on hand, so vendors like Bon Chovie had to get creative. Instead of their rocking fried anchovies, the duo will be baking up sweet treats as Sugar Daddy&apos;s Cinnamon Buns. Same goes for Beehive Oven, who trade in the fried chicken for holiday-appropriate turkey and cranberry sandwich on a pumpkin biscuit. </p>

<p>Some new faces debut alongside the new digs, including a retail outlet from meat master Pat La Frieda, where he&apos;ll be selling &quot;holiday roasts and steaks&quot; in addition to his special burger blend; the stand sets up for the next four weekends. Also making its Smorg debut: The Bruffin. It&apos;s the latest hybrid/Frankenpastry to hit the city&#x2014;recently popping up at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509140856/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/13/outdoor_lic_flea_food_market_begins_1.php">the LIC Flea</a>&#x2014;and this time an unholy mix of a muffin and brioche. The stall offers three fillings for your dining pleasure: Spanish (chorizo and manchego), American (buffalo chicken and blue cheese) and French (brie, herbs de provence and gruyere). </p>

<p>The new location debuts this weekend from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. on both Saturdays and Sundays. All told, the Flea/Burg has 200 vendors, including 75 dedicated food stalls selling the above prepared eats plus packaged foods from Granola Lab, McClure&apos;s, pies from Butter &amp; Scotch and dozens more. Plenty of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509140856/http://www.brooklynflea.com/vendors/">flea favs</a> will be selling all the homegoods, vintage nick-nacks, beauty products and clothing you need to stock up for your holiday gift list.</p>
