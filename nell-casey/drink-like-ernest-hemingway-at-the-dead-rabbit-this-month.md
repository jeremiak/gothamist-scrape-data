If you can get through <em>The Sun Also Rises</em> without cracking a bottle of wine then you&apos;re a stronger person than we are. To honor Hemingway&apos;s contribution to the worlds of prose and booze, atavistic cocktail den <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130529005431/http://www.deadrabbitnyc.com/">The Dead Rabbit</a>&#x2014;which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130529005431/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/02/inside_the_dead_rabbit_now_serving.php#photo-1">opened in January in the Financial District</a>&#x2014;kicks off their public event series with two evenings dedicated to cocktails the Lost Generation author would have enjoyed in his time.</p>

<p>Philip Green, co-founder of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130529005431/http://www.museumoftheamericancocktail.org/">Museum of the American Cocktail</a> and author of <em>To Have and Have Another,&quot;</em> a guide to Hemingway&apos;s life and work illustrated through alcohol, will lead a Hemingway-centric discussion at each event. During the talk, noted mixologist and &quot;King Cocktail&quot; Dale DeGroff will recreate four cocktails found in Hemingway&apos;s works.</p>

<p>On April 27th the event focuses on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130529005431/http://www.deadrabbitnyc.com/ai1ec_event/hemingway-in-havana/?instance_id=29767">Hemingway&apos;s time in Havana</a>, where the author spent nearly two decades of his life, so expect lots of rum-centric beverages. The following night, explore <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130529005431/http://www.deadrabbitnyc.com/ai1ec_event/hemingway-in-paris/?instance_id=29766">Hemingway&apos;s life in Paris</a>, where he palled around with F. Scott Fitzgerald and other Lost Generation authors in the city&apos;s many cafes and bars. </p>

<p><em>Tickets to &quot;Hemingway in Havana&quot; (April 27th; 7 p.m.) and &quot;Hemingway in Paris&quot; (April 28th; 7 p.m.) cost $60 and include four cocktails. You can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130529005431/http://www.deadrabbitnyc.com/product-category/event/">purchase them on the bar&apos;s website</a>.</em></p>
