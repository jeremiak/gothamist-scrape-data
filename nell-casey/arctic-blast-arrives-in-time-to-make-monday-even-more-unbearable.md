<p>Happy New Year! Did you enjoy your time off coddled in the warm caress of caloric excess and conspicuous consumption? May those memories sustain you tomorrow, when you&apos;ll be greeted by a blast of frigid air to the face during the Back To Work commute. </p>

<p>Christmas&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160504072222/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/26/warmest_christmas_ever.php">swimsuit weather</a> will be but a bleak mid-winter memory come tomorrow, as winter makes her first meaningful push for relevance&#x2014;we&apos;ll forget that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160504072222/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/28/winter_is_that_you.php">pathetic snow attempt</a> ever happened. An arctic air mass will bring bone-chilling cold to the city beginning tomorrow, resulting in temperatures in the lower 30s through Tuesday. </p>

<p>This will be the coldest air of the season so far, with temperatures five to 10 degrees below normal. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160504072222/http://www.accuweather.com/en/weather-news/nyc-coldest-air-of-the-season/54578200">According to Accuweather</a>, &quot;the last time Central Park recorded high temperatures in the lower 30s was March 1.&quot; Farewell, eternal <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160504072222/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/09/long_hot_eternal_summer.php">summer</a>. </p>

<p>This blast of arctic air will be hastened along by northerly winds, which will result in dreaded &quot;Feels Like&quot; predictions between 10 and 20 degrees. Overnight temps will drop into the teens on Monday night and middle 20s on Tuesday night thanks to a high pressure system promoting dry weather. RIP our extremities.</p>

<p>Gothamist&apos;s weather expert Joe Schumacher gives cause for hope, with a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160504072222/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/01/new_weather_for_a_new_year.php">prediction</a> of temps in the 40s later in the week as the jet stream pushes the colder air away. And all that freezing wind means sunny skies, all the better for examining our frostbitten fingers.  </p>
