<p>The third location of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108035942/http://www.stickys.com/">Sticky&apos;s Finger Joint</a>, the uncomfortably-named chicken finger operation, opens their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108035942/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/22/stickys_finger_joint_opening.php#photo-3">third outpost</a> in Hell&apos;s Kitchen on Thursday this week on 9th Avenue at 43rd Street. This&apos;ll be the largest of the Stickys, with 1,400-square-feet of space for blasting through a basket of their fried goods. It&apos;s also the only location (so far) to serve alcohol, with both tap and canned craft beers and an unfiltered hard cider.</p>

<p>They&apos;re debuting some new finger innovations, including new chicken finger wraps&#x2014;the Spicy Classic has greens, tomatoes, cheese and chipotle mayo on a whole wheat wrap&#x2014;and a new signature chicken dish, a &quot;hybrid between southern hot fried chicken and Szechuan style spicy chicken.&quot; From 4 p.m. to 7 p.m. on opening day, they&apos;ll also be selling baskets of their classic Fingers and Poppers (chicken nugget-type balls) for $1. Shout about it on social media <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108035942/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/25/check_out_this_awesome_twitter_figh_1.php">if you dare</a>.</p>
