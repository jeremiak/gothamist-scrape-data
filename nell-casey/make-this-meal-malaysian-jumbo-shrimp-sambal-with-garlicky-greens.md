<p>We&apos;ve recently become <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422204500/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/08/rasa_1.php#photo-1">obsessed with Malaysian cuisine</a>, thanks in no small part to a delicious, home-cooked meal by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422204500/http://auriasmalaysiankitchen.com/">Auria Abraham</a>, who introduced us to the spicy, fishy, garlicky and all around delicious cuisine of her home country. Seeing a gap in the city&apos;s Malaysian offerings, Abraham has been lighting up food events like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422204500/http://gothamist.com/2013/12/23/photos_so_so_glos_and_other_bands_r.php#photo-1">Brooklyn Night Bazaar</a> and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422204500/http://auriasmalaysiankitchen.com/aurias-malaysian-kitchen-over-2000-served/">Malaysian Winter Market</a> in Bryant Park, where she served over 2,000 people her Beef Rendang Sliders and Sweet &amp; Spicy Ilkan Bilis.</p>

<p>Besides her market appearances, Abraham makes a version of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422204500/http://auriasmalaysiankitchen.com/delicious/sambal/">hot chilli sambal</a>, which she sells to vendors and individuals across the country looking for a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422204500/http://beta.gothamist.com/entry.php?category=Food&amp;id=588275">unique hot sauce</a> to add to their collections. Being devotees of spicy foods, we asked Abraham to share an easy-to-make recipe with us that would serve as an introduction to Malaysian flavors. She obliged, providing us with the details on how to make succulent Jumbo Shrimp Sambal with some ridiculously garlicky greens on the side.</p>

<p><strong>Auria&apos;s Jumbo Shrimp Sambal</strong></p>

<p>Ingredients:</p>

<ul>
<li>1.5 lbs shell-on jumbo shrimp</li>
<li>2 teaspoons dried shrimp (optional but recommended)</li>
<li>2 tablespoons sunflower seed oil (or other neutral oil)</li>
<li>5 cloves garlic, minced</li>
<li>1 small Vidalia onion, sliced into chunks</li>
<li>2 teaspoons Auria&#x2019;s Malaysian Kitchen Hot Chilli Sambal</li>
<li>Salt to taste</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="030514driedshrimp.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422204500im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_nellcasey/030514driedshrimp.jpg" width="640" height="478"> <br> <i> <span class="photo_caption">(photo courtesy Auria&apos;s Malaysian Kitchen)</span></i></div> <p></p>

<p>If using, soak the dried shrimp in half a cup of boiling water for 30 mins. Drain and grind in a mortar and pestle or a food processor. </p>

<p>Abraham likes to leave the shells on the shrimp, as that&apos;s how shrimp is served in Malaysia and makes for a more interesting dining experience. Using a pair of kitchen shears, snip off the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422204500/http://fishcooking.about.com/od/shrimpcrablobster/ss/How-To-Head-Fresh-Shrimp-A-Step-By-Step-Guide-To-Removing-The-Heads-From-Shrimp_2.htm">sharp rostrum</a> on the top of the head of each shrimp. &quot;There&apos;s nothing worse than scraping your lip as you&apos;re sucking the sambal off the head of the shrimp,&quot; Abraham explains. Feel free to use peeled shrimp if you prefer.</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="030514wok.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422204500im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_nellcasey/030514wok.jpg" width="640" height="478"> <br> <i> <span class="photo_caption">(photo courtesy Auria&apos;s Malaysian Kitchen)</span></i></div> <p></p>

<p>Heat the oil in a wok or Dutch oven over high heat. Add the garlic and onions, cooking until fragrant. Add the ground dried shrimp and cook for two minutes, stirring and scraping to avoid sticking, then add the Hot Chilli Sambal.</p>

<p>Add the shrimp and stir to combine. Cook until shrimp is done, about 5 to 6 minutes; or, rather than going by the amount of time, learn to tell when shrimp is done by how it looks. Abraham explains: &quot;The shells turn pink and each shrimp curls up. I like to take them off the heat before they curl up too tightly&#x2014;once they&#x2019;ve done that, they&#x2019;re overcooked and tough. Keep stirring the entire time, moving the cooked shrimp from the bottom of the wok up to the top, and moving the uncooked shrimp down to the bottom. This way, you&#x2019;re giving them all a chance to cook evenly.&quot;</p>

<p>Garnish the shrimp mixture with sliced scallions and serve over rice.</p>

<p>Your mama always told you to eat your vegetables and so we&apos;re telling you to do the same here! Garlic makes everything better, which is the method employed by Abraham in this simple recipe for sauteed greens. She <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422204500/http://auriasmalaysiankitchen.com/2-easy-ways-to-love-your-chinese-greens/#lightbox[gallery]/8/">uses baby bok choy</a> here but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422204500/http://gothamist.com/2014/02/17/meet_the_greens_5_leafy_veggies_tha.php">any leafy green</a> would work here. </p>

<p>Ingredients:</p>

<ul>
<li>1 pound Chinese greens  (baby bok choy or another)</li>
<li>3 tablespoons peanut oil</li>
<li>8 cloves of garlic, minced or sliced thinly into garlic chips</li>
<li>Vietnamese fish sauce, oyster sauce or soy sauce (optional)</li>
<li>Salt to taste</li>
</ul>

<p>Slice bok choy lengthwise and quickly blanch until they&apos;ve just turned bright green, remove them from the water and set aside. </p>

<p>Heat the oil over high heat in a wok or saute pan. Add the garlic plus half a teaspoon of salt and turn the heat down to medium. Continuously stir the garlic until it achieves a dark, nutty brown color. Be extra careful it doesn&apos;t burn, as it will develop a bitter flavor.</p>

<p>Add additional seasonings, if using, and stir to combine. Pour the oil and garlic mixture over the greens and serve immediately. </p>
