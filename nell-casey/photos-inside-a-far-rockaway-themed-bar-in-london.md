</div></div>					<p>Everyone wants a taste of NYC, especially if they aren&apos;t living here. First we heard about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406144649/http://gothamist.com/2014/02/14/bedford-stuyvesant_cafe_opensin_ams.php">Bed-Stuy in Amsterdam</a> and now there&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406144649/http://rockawayist.com/2014/03/09/rockaway-arrives-in-london/">Far Rockaway in London</a> (we choose to ignore <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406144649/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/21/sbarro_expands_brand_with_brooklyn.php">Brooklyn in Ohio</a>). The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406144649/http://rockawayist.com/">Rockawayist</a> blog&#x2014;not affiliated, but we dig the name&#x2014;turned us on to this Queens-inspired bar that opened in the Shoreditch section of London in October of last year. The restaurant and bar, called simply <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406144649/http://www.farrockaway.co.uk/index.html">Far Rockaway</a>, is &quot;inspired by urban street art and culture,&quot; especially the Rockaway Surf Club, the area&apos;s storied surf spot that&apos;s now a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406144649/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/07/hipsters_now_ruining_surfing_at_roc.php">hipster enclave</a>. </p>

<p>The space itself is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406144649/http://www.farrockaway.co.uk/gallery.html">actually pretty sweet</a>, even if it looks a little more Coney Island than Queens. It&apos;s got all the requisite Cool Kid touches like a ceiling constructed from skateboards (not surfboards?), tattoo-like wall art, a book-lined den area with couches and a DJ booth constructed from boomboxes. The pastiche aims to look casual, but it&apos;s clear the owners are looking to attract a more high-end clientele than the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406144649/http://gothamist.com/2014/03/05/best_dive_bars_nyc.php">crusty dives</a> favored by our hipster hordes. It&apos;s got that Brooklyn Bowl sheen about it.</p>

<p>The proprietors get big ups for trying to keep it authentic when it comes to the food, especially with their pizza. Their menu advertises &quot;Staten Island Pizza&quot; and apparently the whole staff took a journey to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406144649/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/18/the_best_pizza_in_nyc.php">Denino&apos;s</a> to learn how the real deal gets made. Rockawayist says the pizza is &quot;moderately thin and easy to fold in half without collapsing, but lacks a good char.&quot; The rest of the menu boasts &quot;American-style&quot; eats like wings, chicken parmesan, burgers and...mac n cheese spring rolls. Sigh. And yes, mate: they have Brooklyn Brewery beers. </p>
