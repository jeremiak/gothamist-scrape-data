<p>After years of wandering and eating and drinking...<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171015130713/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/19/watch_anthony_bourdain_and_eric_rip.php">and more drinking</a>...Anthony Bourdain has racked up one hell of a global travel portfolio. Field notes and tips from his years hosting his CNN show <em>Parts Unknown</em> (among others) are now being made available on a newly-launched companion website, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171015130713/https://explorepartsunknown.com/">Explore Parts Unknown</a>, a multimedia-driven upgrade to the show&apos;s previous online component.</p>

<p>The site launched Wednesday with guides to cities including Rome, Istanbul, Senegal, Manila, Las Vegas and Buenos Aires. Each section includes an introduction from Bourdain&#x2014;a staple from the show&apos;s previous website&#x2014;in addition to video clips from the episode(s), and personal photo essays from contributors about their experiences in these cities and countries. </p>

<p>On the practical side, each entry features a &quot;Fact Sheet&quot; that outlines important things to know for travelers, like where to eat and drink, and other tidbits of info including local lingo and other fun facts. </p>

<p>The site launched in collaboration with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171015130713/http://roadsandkingdoms.com/">Roads &amp; Kingdoms</a>, an independent travel journal and culture site that releases its own guides and features. Bourdain&apos;s site will <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171015130713/http://www.travelandleisure.com/travel-tips/celebrity-travel/anthony-bourdain-parts-unknown-travel-guides?utm_campaign=&amp;utm_content=58e62a3e04d3013fa6cbc50d&amp;utm_medium=&amp;utm_source=&amp;xid=TrueAnthem_Twitter">update every Thursday</a> before new episodes of <em>Parts Unknown</em> air on Sundays, with new episodes arriving later in April.</p>

<p>With Bourdain&apos;s much-hyped NYC food market seemingly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171015130713/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/22/bourdain_market_update.php">decades away from opening</a>, this is the closest we&apos;ll get to Tony&apos;s Travel Tips for now. </p>
