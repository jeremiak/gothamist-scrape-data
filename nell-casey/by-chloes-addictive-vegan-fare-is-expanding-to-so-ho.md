<p>Since opening <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160505194836/http://gothamist.com/2015/07/28/by_chloe_vegan_west_village.php#photo-1">over the summer</a>, gourmet fast food vegan spot <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160505194836/http://www.bychefchloe.com/">by Chloe</a> has been perennially mobbed, proof of its status as one of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160505194836/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/15/best_bites_of_2015.php">best new restaurants</a> to open this year.
