<p>When you have a last name like Cumming, the only thing you can do is lean in&#x2014;and Alan Cumming has always leaned in with gusto. Which is why it&apos;s delightfully on brand that he&apos;s opening up a new East Village bar called Club Cumming this fall.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170419145435/http://pagesix.com/2017/04/10/alan-opening-club-cumming-on-the-lower-east-side/">Page Six reports</a> that the actor will partner with Eastern Bloc owners Benjamin Maisani and Darren Dryden, along with promoter Daniel Nardicio. The quartet will close Eastern Bloc in August to revamp, with plans to reopen in September. </p>

<p>A rep says the club will be &quot;as eclectic and unexpected as Alan himself&quot; and that it&apos;ll be a &quot;home for everyone of all ages, all genders, all sexualities, who all enjoy letting go and making some mischief. No judgments, no attitude, no rules, except kindness, acceptance and fun.&quot;</p>

<p>And double entendre. So much double entendre. </p>
