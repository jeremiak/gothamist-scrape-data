<p>Lawsuits brought by several employees of popular Avenue A restaurant Babu Ji have led to the closure of the restaurant for the foreseeable future. The two lawsuits&#x2014;filed in as many years as the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171006044801/http://gothamist.com/2015/06/09/babu_ji_indian_alphabet_city.php#photo-1">restaurant has been open</a>&#x2014;have both centered on wage theft accusations against owners Jessi and Jennifer Singh, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171006044801/http://ny.eater.com/2017/3/2/14789116/babu-ji-closing-labor-lawsuits-threats">Eater reports</a>, with new allegations about verbal abuse tacked on to a recent amendment of the second lawsuit, which was filed in September of last year.</p>

<p>According to the suits, employees routinely worked between 42 and 60 hours per week and never received the commensurate time and a half overtime pay for said hours over 40. Instead, employees were allegedly &quot;compensated a flat rate of $600 per week, regardless of the amount of hours they worked.&quot; Further, ownership is accused of not distributing credit card tips to employees and &quot;routinely pocket[ing] cash tips&quot; while also paying employees at tipped minimum wage, which is significantly less than the federal minimum wage. </p>

<p>To make matters worse, owner Jessi Singh has been accused of using abusive and threatening language toward employees who spoke up about the wage violations. He&apos;s quoted as allegedly using phrases including, &quot;If you&#x2019;re fucking my family I&#x2019;m going to fuck you up. I&#x2019;m going to fuck your family&quot; and calling one employee a &quot;sisterfucker&quot; while threatening to countersue. </p>

<p>Eater uploaded <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171006044801/https://www.scribd.com/document/340719997/Babu-Ji?content=10079&amp;campaign=Skimbit%2C%20Ltd.&amp;ad_group=&amp;keyword=ft500noi&amp;source=impactradius&amp;medium=affiliate&amp;irgwc=1">the amended charges</a> that were filed in February of this year, which bring a more serious case against the Singhs. To date, they&apos;ve denied all wrongdoing despite paying out $95,000 in response to the first lawsuit, which was brought in July of 2016. We&apos;ve reached out to a representative for the restaurant and we&apos;ll update if they have additional comment.</p>

<p>Joining other critics who went nuts for Babu Ji&apos;s food, our own Scott Lynch was impressed by the restaurant&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171006044801/http://gothamist.com/2015/09/22/babu_ji_ave_b_review.php#photo-1">&quot;outstanding...Indian food ecstasy.&quot;</a></p>
