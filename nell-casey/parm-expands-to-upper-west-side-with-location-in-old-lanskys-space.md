<p>The dudes behind retro Italian spot Parm are once again expanding their perennially packed red sauce joint, this time to the Upper West Side. Rich Torrisi, Mario Carbone and Jeff Zalaznick will take over the Columbus Avenue space that once housed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430034005/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/26/lanskys_closes.php">gut-busting deli Lansky&apos;s</a>, which shuttered a year ago this month. The team looks to open their latest outpost in the 2,800 square foot space at 235 Columbus Avenue in the next six months, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430034005/http://nypost.com/2014/02/24/parm-heads-to-upper-west-side-for-summer-launch/">according to the Post</a>.</p>

<p>In addition to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430034005/http://www.majorfood.com/">Major Food Group&apos;s</a> other eateries Carbone, Torrisi Italian Specialities and ZZ&apos;s Clam Bar, the team operates a Parm offshoot <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430034005/http://gothamist.com/2011/07/21/torrisi_guys_are_opening_a_sandwich.php">inside Yankee Stadium</a> and their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430034005/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/03/italian_soul_food_at_torrisis_new_d.php">original Nolita location</a>, which opened in 2011. In December, news broke that they would <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430034005/http://gothamist.com/2013/12/10/williamsburg_restos.php">expand the Parm brand</a> into Williamsburg, in addition to a Battery Park City location as well.</p>
