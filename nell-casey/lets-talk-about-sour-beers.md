<p>There&apos;s a kind of sour beer renaissance taking place in the city&apos;s craft watering holes and no, we&apos;re not talking about the skunked cans of Bud you &quot;discovered&quot; in the back of your fridge. Some seriously funky and fun brews have been delighting beer geeks, who until the past few years didn&apos;t enjoy the same kind of access to these somewhat fickle, hard-to-find beers. The rest of the city caught on in the past year, with lots of folks chronicling the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502122537/http://www.npr.org/blogs/thesalt/2013/10/15/234914933/pucker-up-america-beers-are-going-sour">rise in popularity nationwide</a> of these beers and their connection to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502122537/http://www.businessinsider.com/sour-beer-trend-2014-2">craft beer boom</a> in general.</p>

<p>But what is a sour beer? The <em>New Yorker</em> as a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502122537/http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/culture/2013/07/sour-beer-cantillon-a-brief-history.html">wonderful primer</a> on the history, production and current surge in popularity of these tart tinctures, which are said to be the oldest style of beer in the world. The tl;dr version is that in the pre-refrigeration days, some badass bacterium infected the beers, giving them a sour flavor. Modern brewers are now purposefully infecting their brews with these party animals&#x2014;wild yeasts or certain bacterias mostly&#x2014;in the hopes of creating a pleasing product. Unfortunately, it&apos;s not always a home run. Sometimes the resulting beers are imbued with flavors of leather, smoke and &quot;horse blanket;&quot; other times, it&apos;s nail polish remover, rotten apple and &quot;baby diaper.&quot; </p>

<p>We reached out to Ben Wiley, bar owner and knower of beer things, for his take on the sour beer boom, which he attributes to the general movement towards small batch, artisanal food making. &quot;People enjoy re-discovering older methods of doing things&#x2014;you see this in pickles, fermented foods (which beer is!) like sour kraut and kimchi, artisanaly made anything, etc.,&quot; he told us. &quot;And I think beer in general&#x2014;but especially a style like sours where I believe the entire origin of the genre is just naturally occurring things&#x2014;fits right in the whole movement.&quot;</p>
