<p>With temperatures expected to reach a balmy 48 degrees tomorrow, it&apos;s a great time to indulge in some free ice cream at a <strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140205204321/http://store.wired.com/display_events">Ben &amp; Jerry&apos;s Ice Cream Social</a></strong> at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140205204321/http://store.wired.com/shop">Wired Store</a> on 14th Street. It&apos;s the second ice cream happy hour this month, running from 4:30 p.m. to 7 p.m.; score gratis icy treats, of course, and play some vintage video games just like you used to after school. There&apos;s also a chance to win a year&apos;s worth of free Ben &amp; Jerry&apos;s; Merry Christmas to you!</p>
