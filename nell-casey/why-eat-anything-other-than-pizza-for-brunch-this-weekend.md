<p>Pizza in the morning, pizza in the evening, pizza at bruuuunch time...over at Park Slope&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170624090552/http://www.gristmillbk.com/"><strong>Gristmill</strong></a>, where they&apos;re slinging pies weekend days as part of their <strong>new brunch program</strong>. In addition to Smoked Salmon pies and one with potato and bacon, they&apos;re also serving up other bready creations including a selection of toasts (everything bagel and lox, for example), biscuits and gravy and their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170624090552/http://gothamist.com/2016/07/14/gristmill_park_slope.php#photo-1">special garlic knots</a> in everything or cacio e pepe coatings. </p>

<p>If the weekend brings you to the <strong>Met Breuer museum</strong> on the Upper East Side, take note that the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170624090552/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/12/flora_bar_met_breuer.php#photo-1">new restaurant inside</a> now offers <strong>midday meals on Fridays through Sundays</strong>. They&apos;re calling it lunch, but possible dishes include an Omelette with paddlefish and trout roe and a Potato and Onion Galette with sour cream and parsley, in addition to dishes like Lamb Ribs with yogurt and steak with potatoes. Maybe it&apos;s museum first, lunch and nap later. </p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="120216lasirena.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170624090552im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_nellcasey/120216lasirena.jpg" width="640" height="480"> <br> <i> Insert Santa here (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170624090552/https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-sirena-ristorante-new-york-3?select=uyU32S2fFK4dr6l2rQkClQ">Yelp</a>)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>The patio at Chelsea&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170624090552/http://lasirena-nyc.com/">La Sirena</a> will be transformed from a breezy dining spot into the <strong>Holiday Village at La Sirena</strong> beginning this Saturday. From 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. on the weekends, the patio will be decked out with dozens of Christmas trees decorated and illuminated. Santa himself will be posing for photo opps with anyone who asks and there&apos;ll be cocktails (like the Naughty or Nice with Sailor Jerry Spiced Rum, Lairds Apple Brandy, demerara syrup and apple cider) and a special brunch menu of Italian specialties, too. </p>

<p>Also in the Italian vein, teen chef Flynn McGarry&apos;s Sunday night edition of his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170624090552/http://gothamist.com/2015/09/01/teen_chef_west_village.php">pop-up restaurant Eureka</a> transforms into <strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170624090552/http://www.eurekanyc.com/">Pasta Sundays</a></strong> beginning this weekend. The traditional weekend meal includes a pasta dish, garlic bread, sides and a glass of wine for each diner for $50, with seatings available at 6 p.m. and 8 p.m. Old Italian movies playing in the background are also lined up for the event. </p>
