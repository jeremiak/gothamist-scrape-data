					<p>Imagine Don Draper downing cocktails in a rural Washington state cabin and you&apos;ll have a pretty good idea of the vibe at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170326163055/https://www.thelatelybar.com/">The Lately</a>, LDV Hospitality and Den Hospitality&apos;s newest venture that opens tonight in Chelsea. Said originally to have been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170326163055/http://gothamist.com/2017/02/08/twin_peaks_mad_men_restaurant.php">inspired by <em>Mad Men</em> and <em>Twin Peaks</em></a>, the large bi-level bar goes for an &quot;upstate cabin of yore&quot; vibe that&apos;s <strike>the perfect setting for a murder</strike> palpable without being overly twee. Plus: mallards. Did Agent Cooper grow up to be Trey MacDougal? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170326163055/http://ew.com/article/2000/07/21/sex-and-citys-kyle-maclachlan/">Yes</a>. </p>

<p>Den&apos;s Grant Wheeler designed the cocktails, some of which strive for a &quot;deeper exploration of our favorite classics&quot; including The Jaguar Shark ($17, strawberry-infused gin, aquavit, aveze, lacusta rojo and celery shrub), while others &quot;[push] the borders of flavor and recognition to the source&quot; like a Jack Daniels, Punt e Mes, spiced kola cordial and lemon ditty called Lemmy Lives ($16). But they&apos;ll also mix you up a Manhattan ($14) if you&apos;re into the whole brevity thing. </p>

<p>LDV&apos;s responsible for the food, which are more bar bites than sit-down fare. Munch on curried chicken skewers ($9), quinoa hush puppies ($6) or a jambon buerre sandwich ($12) made with Dickinson&apos;s Farmstand smoked ham and butter. In true bar snacks fashion they&apos;re offering &quot;Shaken Popcorn&quot; ($4), which can be ordered in sriracha, dill pickle, white cheddar and black pepper/asiago flavors. </p>
