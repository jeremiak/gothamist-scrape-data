<p>A group of <strike>Thanksgiving haters</strike> concerned citizens on Staten Island are rallying to save the turkeys who were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130827045245/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/13/staten_island_turkeys_2.php">scheduled for execution</a> earlier this week. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130827045245/http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2013/08/staten_islanders_rally_to_save.html#incart_m-rpt-2">Starting on Wednesday</a>, a group of 50 people gathered near the South Beach Psychiatric Center, the site where a large flock of wild turkeys has been camped out for years. The group hopes to protect any future bird-napping from the area and gathered to express their outrage that no prior notice was given to the community that the birds would be removed.</p>

<p>&quot;It was really sneaky the way they did this,&quot; Leigh Shea <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130827045245/http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2013/08/staten_islanders_rally_to_save.html#incart_m-rpt-2">lamented to SI Live</a>. &quot;These turkeys have been here for years.&quot; The watch continued on Thursday, where residents adopted a phone relay system to notify protestors if the USDA returns. &#x201C;We&#x2019;re just trying to keep this from happening,&#x201D; Elisa DiSimone <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130827045245/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20130816/ocean-breeze/residents-plan-24-hour-watch-save-si-turkeys-from-slaughterhouse">explained to DNAinfo</a>. &#x201C;We&apos;re really trying save this piece of Staten Island history.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Monday morning the USDA began removing the birds from the lawn outside the hospital, citing turkey aggression and &quot;excessive feces.&quot; The agency claims the birds can&apos;t simply be relocated because of the &quot;hybrid turkeys&quot; that are part of the flock, but opponents aren&apos;t buying it. &quot;It&apos;s crazy,&quot; said professor Irving Robbins. &quot;There are hundreds of acres of woods on the South Shore where they could be relocated. Why kill them?&quot; </p>
