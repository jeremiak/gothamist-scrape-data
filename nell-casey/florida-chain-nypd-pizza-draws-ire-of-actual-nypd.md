<p>Using New York City to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505142700/http://gothamist.com/2014/02/14/bedford-stuyvesant_cafe_opensin_ams.php">promote your business</a> has become the hot new trend for businesses not fortunate enough to actually reside in the Big Apple. An enterprising gent in Florida took that idea a step further when he opened his pizza chain modeled after NYC&apos;s most beloved agency: the NYPD. Unfortunately for pizzaiolo Paul Russo, the department wasn&apos;t thrilled with his co-opting of their signature brand and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505142700/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-attorneys-nypd-pizza-chain-florida-article-1.1622057">took legal action against the chain</a> for using their logo without expressly stating that the NYPD wasn&apos;t involved in making the pies. And you thought <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505142700/http://gothamist.com/tags/forkgate">using a fork</a> was a big deal.</p>

<p>Under the terms of a 2008 settlement, the chain was required to have disclaimers anywhere they were using their version of the NYPD&apos;s blue and gold shield. City attorneys claimed Russo violated their terms of agreement by making the disclaimers &quot;too small, too light and virtually invisible when put up against a darker color.&quot; Russo agreed to amend his website to meet their demands; &quot;when you already developed the name and the brand, you have to,&quot; he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505142700/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-attorneys-nypd-pizza-chain-florida-article-1.1622057">explained to the Daily News</a>.</p>

<p>Though the native New Yorker has never been a member of the NYPD himself, Russo claims to have many relatives who work for the department. And while naming your eatery after one of the country&apos;s most criticized agencies seems odd, things are definitely <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505142700/http://www.salon.com/2013/07/26/5_reasons_why_florida_is_the_weirdest_state_ever_partner/">&quot;different&quot;</a> down in Florida. Be on the lookout for the chain of El Bloomberg Cantinas to open next.</p>
