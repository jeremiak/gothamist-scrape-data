</div></div>					<p>This burger-obsessed town got another meaty addition last week when <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429160452/http://www.facebook.com/bluecollargoodjob">Blue Collar</a>, a small burger-and-dog shop, opened on Havemeyer Street. The restaurant comes from Gavin Compton and Jeff Slagg, the fellas behind <a href="millerstavernbrooklyn.com/">Miller&apos;s Tavern</a>, but you won&apos;t find any Duck Rillettes or artisanal cheeses plates here. Their new venture harkens back to the roadside burger shacks of yore, with a kind of &quot;keep it simple, stupid&quot; menu of well-prepared comfort foods.</p>

<p>Burgers ($4) get a nice sear on the flat top before being topped with the requisite raw veggies and a special sauce, with the option to add to cheese or an additional patty if you&apos;re into that kind of thing. And while it&apos;s difficult to talk about bargain burgers in this town without thinking of that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429160452/http://gothamist.com/tags/shakeshack">little empire starter over in Madison Square Park</a>, the comparison here is well-deserved, as Blue Collar griddles up tender, juicy burgers to rival any available around town. The menu rounds out with an all-beef hot dog served up with tangy kraut ($2.75) and fries that ($2.25/$3/25) come generously salt and peppered, with cheese and/or chili additions available for a few pennies more. The classic milkshake gets a turn in the blender with flavor options spanning from vanilla and chocolate to peanut butter and cookies &amp; cream. And rest easy, boozehounds: a beer and wine list is currently in the works. </p>

<p>When all&apos;s said and done, nothing on the menu costs more than $6.25, and for that, our wallets and bellies are eternally grateful.</p>

<p><em>160 Havemeyer Street, Store # 2, Williamsburg; 347-725-3837</em></p>
