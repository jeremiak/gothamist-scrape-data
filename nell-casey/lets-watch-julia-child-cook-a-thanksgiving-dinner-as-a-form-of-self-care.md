<p>Look guys, I&apos;m not going to tell you tomorrow&apos;s going to be easy. Historically, Thanksgiving&apos;s the time for alcohol-fueled arguments with your racist uncle and this year...well, has been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161126094511/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/23/trump_family_thanksgiving.php">this year</a>. And all of that&apos;s before someone overcooks the mashed potatoes or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161126094511/http://gothamist.com/2012/11/21/5_classic_videos_to_remind_you_why.php">sets the turkey on fire</a>. </p>

<p>Before we face potential anxiety tomorrow, let&apos;s live inside a world of calm and confident cooking with America&apos;s most darling culinary grandparents: Julia Child and Jacques Pepin. </p>

<p>In their classic 1999 Thanksgiving edition of <em>Julia and Jacques: Cooking at Home</em>, the duo hack apart a turkey with a meat cleaver (very satisfying!) in what was more or less an improvised scene that could only be pulled off by professionals like these two.</p>

<p>&quot;We had talked about how to do the turkey a day before we shot that show,&quot; Pepin recalled in a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161126094511/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/11/17/AR2009111700746.html">conversation with the Washington Post</a>. &quot;Julia had said, &apos;Let&apos;s try to bone it and stuff it.&apos; I had never done a turkey that way before. What you see on camera is the first time, with no recipe, even different than what we had discussed.&quot;</p>

<p>While most of our Thanksgiving tables aren&apos;t going to employ this level of culinary finesse, Child stresses that improvisation and flexibility are at the heart of cooking, and should theoretically make the experience less intimidating. &quot;As we say, recipes are not written in stone, they&apos;re just to give you an idea of what to do and then you go on,&quot; she says.</p>

<p>But cooking a high-pressure meal can come with a huge amount of anxiety; luckily, Julia was there to help until her death in 2004. Child &quot;embraced the role of national Thanksgiving commander in chief&quot; as outlined in a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161126094511/http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/18/dining/julia-child-thanksgiving.html">lovely profile by the Times</a> about the cook&apos;s tradition of leaving her home number listed for nervous strangers to call with any Thanksgiving crisis. </p>

<p>If Pepin and Child&apos;s masterpiece meal doesn&apos;t make you feel hugged by a warm blanket of comfort then perhaps Pepin&apos;s suggestion to drink &quot;a lot of wine&quot; might help.</p>

<p>Recreate Jacques and Julia&apos;s meal <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161126094511/https://www.washingtonpost.com/recipes/julia-and-jacquess-deconstructed-turkey-with-corn-bread-stuffing-and-gravy/11042/">here</a>, though be forewarned it&apos;s not for the faint of heart (or anyone not confident wielding a sharp knife). </p>
