					<p>It&apos;s been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170629190339/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/27/circa_tabac_celebrates_10-year-anni.php">over a decade</a> since New Yorkers could spark one inside their local watering hole&#x2014;cigarettes, friends, though wouldn&apos;t that have been a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170629190339/http://gothamist.com/2017/04/20/420_broad_city_video.php">beautiful world</a>? There are still a handful of places where smoking is legally allowed indoors, including <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170629190339/http://sugareast.com/">Sugar East</a>, a new &quot;speakeasy&quot; that replaces Merchants NY Cigar Bar. The space has a coveted, grandfathered tobacco license, which the Merchants Hospitality group will continue to lure in nicotine fiends and those who don&apos;t mind airing out their clothes in the shower after a night out drinking.</p>

<p>&quot;We created a space with a mid-century modern feel, hearkening back to the decadent Havana high life where one might feel like a cigarette after a few cocktails,&quot; owner Abraham Merchant <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170629190339/https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20170405/upper-east-side/sugar-east-lounge-speakeasy-bar-smoking">explained to DNAinfo</a>. Who among us... It&apos;s also a warning to the smoke-averse that perhaps they should find <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170629190339/http://gothamist.com/tags/speakeasy">a different speakeasy</a> (so-called here since guests descend some stairs to find the joint).</p>

<p>The smokiness extends to the cocktails created by Jeremy Strawn, formerly of Mulberry Project. There&apos;s a charred lemon garnish to the cocktail ($16) of the same name, which features Elijah Craig bourbon, absinthe and honey, and the Coconut cocktail ($18)&#x2014;served in an actual coconut&#x2014;comes with a singed cinnamon stick for a garnish.</p>

<p>The Havana theme continues with a Cuban Sandwich ($11) and a Grilled Vegetables platter ($12) that includes plantain chips; there are Mexican influences, too, including a Flat Bread ($12) with Oaxacan cheese, huitlacoche and cilantro, and a taste of Venezuela in the Lobster Arepa ($14). </p>
