Just kidding, we&apos;ll never drink like that and neither will you, probably, unless you&apos;re capable of paying a $15,000 annual membership fee or masochistic enough to spend a week&apos;s pay on a single drink. That&apos;s the story behind Rarities, an exclusive club that opened inside the New York Palace Hotel last November following their $140 million renovation. It&apos;s the kind of place that caters to businessmen who ink $250 million dollar deals over glasses of scotch, if <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160117203231/http://nypost.com/2014/03/12/palace-hotels-rarities-is-secret-spot-for-one-percent-to-drink/">the Post&apos;s profile</a> accurately reflects the scene.</p>

<p>And it&apos;s quite a scene. Walls decked out in lush purple fabric, arched stained glass windows, dark wood and leather chairs and an original fireplace. Opulent decor also includes the jewel of the bar&apos;s collection: its booze. Curated rare scotches are presented in an &quot;illuminated, custom-made glass vitrine,&quot; which looks like something the Met would use to house its artifacts. </p>

<p>They serve Pappy Van Winkle, naturally, and a &quot;bottle of early-20th-century rye whiskey discovered in a Colorado crypt&quot; that sells for $175 a glass. If a single glass won&apos;t quench your expensive thirst, a bottle of 1985 Romanee-Conti Grand Cru&#x2014;that would be wine&#x2014;can be had for a mere $27,000. <strike>Reasonable people</strike> skinflints can opt for a $25 glass of 15-year-old Gordon &amp; MacPhail Linkwood scotch served atop a linen coaster with a custom ice cube, should you so desire. Sorry, no beer; you&apos;ll have to settle for a glass of Louis XIII de R&#xE9;my Martin Rare Cask cognac for $3,120.</p>

<p>Sugar babies and expense account junkies can secure a reservation by calling the hotel, but membership holders and guests in the hotel&apos;s Tower suites are given preference for the 25 seats. Ordinary slobs who wouldn&apos;t spend $3K for a glass of cognac can visit <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160117203231/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/26/troubles_trust.php#photo-1">the hotel&apos;s other bar</a> for a downmarket $19 whiskey cocktail.</p>
