<p>Fleet Week is officially underway, people! Right this moment ships are arriving at Pier 90 and parts of Staten Island, and the sailors and their pristinely pressed uniforms are getting ready to descend upon our fair city. If you&apos;re on the west side before 1 p.m. today you can check out the Parade of Ships floating up the Hudson&#x2014;including tall ships, guided-missile destroyers like the USS Roosevelt, and other Navy and Coast Guard ships and planes. Air demonstrations will be happening all over New York City this weekend and many ships will be open to the public for tours. You can check out the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524084701/http://www.fleetweeknewyork.com/events.html">full schedule of official events here</a>. </p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524084701/http://www.livestream.com/usnavy">Navy is also livestreaming</a> the festivities&#x2014;which includes a Blue Angels flyover above the Statue of Liberty at 11:22 a.m.</p>

<p>Lots of unofficial happenings are also sure to be taking place&#x2014;you can probably get details from promotional postcards being handed out in Times Square or, better yet, just ask someone in uniform! And with thousands of sailors hitting the streets we don&apos;t think it will be difficult to find a date for the evening&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120524084701/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/02/will_this_years_fleet_week_be_the_g.php">especially for the city&apos;s gay population</a>!</p>
