<p>A group of enterprising young folks are capitalizing on three of the most <strike>loathed</strike> <strike>lauded</strike> commonly bandied around B-words in New York City lexicon: Brooklyn, bicycles and brunch. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130727021401/http://www.getupandride.com/bike-tours/">Get Up and Ride</a>, a year-old group of four BK-based cyclists, begins their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130727021401/http://www.getupandride.com/bike-tours/">&quot;Brunch in Brooklyn Bike Tour&quot;</a> this weekend, offering up a chance to &quot;sample North Brooklyn&#x2019;s best spots for innovative brunch bites, while riding through scenic areas learning about Brooklyn&#x2019;s history.&quot; </p>

<p>So what does this &quot;foodie&quot; emphasized, $65, 2.5 hour tour include?</p>

<ul>
<li>Bike Rental</li>
<li>Helmet (that&apos;s at least one advantage over <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130727021401/http://gothamist.com/tags/citibike">Citi Bike</a>)</li>
<li>Bike Lock (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130727021401/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/15/basic_bike_lock_etiquette_and_safet.php">Needed!</a>)</li>
<li>&quot;CV&quot; Radio (You don&apos;t want to miss the guide pointing out <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130727021401/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/02/ny_times_how_i_became_a_hipster_con.php">authentic hipsters</a>)</li>
<li>&quot;Your choice of beverage from a tiny cafe hidden from the typical tourist path&quot; (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130727021401/http://www.cuponnorman.com/">Cup</a>)</li>
<li>&quot;A selection of pastries from a local baker who&#x2019;s flavor combinations are unrivaled&quot; (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130727021401/http://oven.ly/">Ovenly</a>)</li>
<li>&quot;Breakfast Tacos and fresh Orange Juice from a local musician&quot; (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130727021401/http://www.whirlybirdbrooklyn.com/">Whirlybird</a>)</li>
<li>&quot;Sample of chocolate at Brooklyn&#x2019;s premier chocolate factory&quot; (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130727021401/http://www.mastbrothers.com/">Mast Brothers</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>The tour concludes with an optional, &quot;discounted&quot; Mimosa at a &quot;Local Cafe.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I created the brunch in Brooklyn tour because there&apos;s nothing more New York than brunch,&quot; company founder Felipe Lavalle <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130727021401/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20130619/williamsburg/brooklyn-bike-company-starts-brunch-and-ride-tour#slideshow_modal_slot_1">told DNAinfo</a>. &quot;North Brooklyn has so many great places to check out.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130727021401/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/30/a_food_drink_tour_of_greenpoint.php#photo-1">Indeed it does</a>! </p>

<p>The tour starts at the very un-hangover-friendly-so-not-really-brunch-hour of 10 a.m. on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, a time better reserved for the tourists we imagine most likely to actually go on this kind of tour. The tour bills itself as a &quot;casual ride with your cool local friend&quot; taking you to &quot;off the beaten path locations that only locals know about,&quot; so read that as you will. With the cool kid scene moving onto nabes like Bushwick and beyond, that &quot;cool local friend&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130727021401/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/06/prime_williamsburg_rents_1600_highe.php">might be open to interpretation</a>. </p>
