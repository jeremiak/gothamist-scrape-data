<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422204635/http://www.huyfong.com/">Huy Fong Foods</a>, the company that produces the ridiculously popular sriracha hot sauce, recently came under fire from residents of Irwindale, California who claim noxious aromas from the plant have caused them great sinus stress. Despite measures to correct the problem, inspectors <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422204635/http://www.pasadenastarnews.com/environment-and-nature/20131114/smell-from-sriracha-hot-sauce-factory-detected-by-air-quality-inspectors">recently found fumes</a> emanating from the facility and the city will appear in Superior Court on November 22nd to proceed with a lawsuit against the fiery food company. </p>

<p>If the fear mongering reports about sriracha shortages and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422204635/http://laist.com/2013/10/29/sriracha_ceo_warns_price_will_go_up.php">rising costs</a> are to be believed, we may soon be facing a kind of piquant panic the world has never seen.</p>
