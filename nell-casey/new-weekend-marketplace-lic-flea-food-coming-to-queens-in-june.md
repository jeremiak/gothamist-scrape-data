<p>Someday in the not-too-distant future New York City&apos;s vending landscape will consist solely of open air food stalls and weekend pop-up markets peddling all the artisanal, bespoke, buzzwordy products we could ever want. So you won&apos;t be surprised to learn that a new market arrives on the scene this summer: The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509135817/http://www.licflea.com/">LIC Flea &amp; Food market</a> opens for business starting on June 15th. Welcome to Brooklyn, Long Island City!</p>

<p>The new marketplace occupies a 24,000 square foot lot on the corner of 5th Street and 46th Avenue, a current parking lot directly across from the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509135817/http://gothamist.com/2007/02/10/love_or_hate_th.php">iconic Pepsi-Cola sign</a> in the heart of Long Island City. Organizers are aiming to have around 100 vendors setting up each Saturday and Sunday but have only released the names of three confirmed vendors for the weekend marketplace. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509135817/http://www.malulic.com/">Malu Ice Cream</a>, an LIC-based ice cream, chocolate and candy store, will definitely be on hand, as will <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509135817/http://www.manducatisrustica.com/manducatisrustica.com/Main.html">Manducatis Rustica</a>, another LIC restaurant, which specializes in Italian dishes and pizza. Besides food, home furnishings and giftware shop <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509135817/http://www.matted-lic.com/">Matted LIC</a> will also open a retail outpost.</p>

<p>Some of the details have yet to be released&#x2014;like what hours the market will operate&#x2014;but we know it will be open Saturdays and Sundays at least through the summer, after which organizers may decide to keep it open longer. Getting to the site shouldn&apos;t be too complicated with the Long Island City stop on the East River Ferry and the 7, E and G trains all stopping nearby. Stay tuned to the LIC Flea &amp; Food&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509135817/https://www.facebook.com/LICFlea">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509135817/https://twitter.com/licflea">Twitter</a> for vendor updates and more details as they emerge. </p>

<p><em>LIC Flea &amp; Food will operate Saturdays and Sunday in a parking lot on the corner of 46th Avenue 5th Street in Long Island City. Contact info@LICflea.com or (718) 866-8089 for more information.</em></p>
