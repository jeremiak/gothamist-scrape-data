<p>If you&apos;ve got an appetite and some money to burn this weekend, why not eat your way through the neighborhood at the 6th annual <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130619003456/http://www.newtasteuws.com/index.html">New Taste of the Upper West Side</a>. Two nights of bacchanalian revelry unfold under an enormous tent on Columbus Avenue, with a dizzying selection of interesting bites from some of the area&apos;s celebrated chefs with some new talent mixed in. There&apos;s also a ridiculous amount of booze, if you&apos;re into that kind of thing.</p>

<p>Tonight, Travel Channel&apos;s competitive eater Adam Richman hosts <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130619003456/http://www.newtasteuws.com/comfort.html">Comfort Classics</a>, which boasts 40 UWS chefs preparing &quot;soul-satisfying classics&quot; and some riffs on traditional comfort food. It all leads up to the big show on Saturday night, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130619003456/http://www.newtasteuws.com/best.html">Best of the West</a>, hosted by <em>Top Chef</em> judge Gail Simmons. Unhampered by any themes, chefs get free reign to present inspired fare to &quot;tantalize, stimulate and motivate even the most discerning palates.&quot;  Basically, both nights are an opportunity to test the limits of your pants buttons.</p>

<p>Both nights also include some musical entertainment, with the 17-piece New York Big Band showing up Saturday to soundtrack your drunken escapades. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130619003456/http://www.newtasteuws.com/tickets.html">Tickets for tonight&apos;s raucous soiree</a> go for $105 and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130619003456/http://www.newtasteuws.com/tickets.html">tickets for Saturday&apos;s feeding frenzy</a> for $135. Before you cry price gouging, your ticket is all inclusive, plus net proceeds from all the festivities benefit <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130619003456/http://www.newtasteuws.com/beneficiaries.html">the Columbus Avenue Streetscape Project</a>, which seeks to beautify Columbus between 76th and 77th.</p>
