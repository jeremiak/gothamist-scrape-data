<p>Bad breath ranks high in the list of personal hygiene crimes but it hasn&apos;t been an offense worthy of arrest until now. In a move of breathtaking stupidity, cops <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502102543/http://nypost.com/2013/12/03/cops-mistake-mans-breath-mints-for-ecstasy-pills-suit/">arrested a Brooklyn man</a> on suspicion that the white breath mints in his pocket were actually ecstasy. Mint-scented MDMA, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502102543/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/18/brooklyn_man_arrested_for_jolly_ran.php">methamphetamine hard candies</a>; what&apos;s next, dime bags of dank oregano mistaken for reefer?</p>

<p>In April, 46-year-old Ron Hankins was strolling on Herkimer Avenue when officers stopped him and demanded to search him, according to a complaint filed in Brooklyn federal court. In his pockets they found several loose <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502102543/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3SGnpTDHkk">&quot;Pow!&quot; brand energy breath mints</a> and, being thorough members of the NYPD, inquired about the pills&apos; provenance. &#x201C;Mr. Hankins explained to the officers that what they had found were mints and not drugs and asked the officers look at and smell them to confirm,&#x201D; according to the suit. &#x201C;He told them to break them up, to sniff them, to do whatever they had to do,&#x201D; Gabriel Harvis, attorney for Mr. Hankins, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502102543/http://nypost.com/2013/12/03/cops-mistake-mans-breath-mints-for-ecstasy-pills-suit/">explained to the Post</a>. &quot;But they didn&apos;t.&quot; </p>

<p>Cops turned down Hankins&apos;s offer, choosing instead to arrest him and throw him in the slammer for 30 hours. Charges were eventually dropped in October, but Hankins and his team won&apos;t let the case rest on principle. &#x201C;There are groups of people in this city who can carry as many breath mints as they want without being interrogated and arrested,&#x201D; declared Harvis. &quot;Fresh breath is not a crime.&quot; Not yet, but Bloomberg still has a few more weeks.</p>
