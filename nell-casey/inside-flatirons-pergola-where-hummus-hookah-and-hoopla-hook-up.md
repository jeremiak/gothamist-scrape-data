</div></div>					<p>I wasn&apos;t sure what to expect when I walked through the doors of Flatiron&apos;s newest restaurant/hookah lounge <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508080749/http://pergolanewyork.com/">Pergola</a>, but I can tell you a live electric violin performance of &quot;The Final Countdown&quot; was the furthest thing from my mind. But that&apos;s what I got at their opening party, along with a surprisingly tasty spread of Mediterranean fare and an out-of-place but much welcome hot toddy. Pergola bills itself as a &quot;dining and entertainment experience,&quot; and judging by the wailing violin strings&#x2014;ferociously strummed and plucked by a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508080749/http://instagram.com/p/jDLmQWEoPM/">bedazzled beauty</a>, I might add&#x2014;deafening DJ, and plumes of fragrant hookah smoke, it seems they certainly have the experience element down. </p>

<p>Confronted with this flashy, circus-like atmosphere I was dubious about the quality of the meal but never judge a kitchen by its club-like enclosure. The food, turned out by Executive Chef Nestor Moina, certainly exceeded my expectations, especially the wonderful Mezze Platter ($12), which came accompanied by traditional baked pita as well as a crisp fried version to scoop up the hummus, babaganoush and kalamata tapanade. Also a hit were the warm Stuffed Grape Leaves served with a delectable whipped tzatsiki sauce. They&apos;re smaller than some of the versions I&apos;ve seen before, the tender casings filled with just enough well-seasoned ground beef and tomato-flavored rice. I greedily eyed the Feta Tasting ($12) at the table next to mine; I&apos;ll save it for the return trip. </p>

<p>The entrees we sampled didn&apos;t quite rival the first course, though it&apos;s possible we were just full from eating every last drop of hummus. A gargantuan portion of Schwarma ($18) didn&apos;t have that melt-in-your-mouth texture I associate with long hours spent on a rotating spit, but the lamb was still tender and had a hint of smokiness offset by a drizzle of nutty tahini. The meat smorgasbord called the Pergola Mixed Grill ($25) offered five different types of flesh, including a tender lamb chop lollipop and <em>kofta</em>, which could best be described as a cigar-shaped meatball. The meats were all well-cooked and flavorful, but the dish itself wouldn&apos;t be something I&apos;d travel for.</p>

<p>A simmering head cold kept me away from the hookah offerings ($20), of which there are 20 in flavors both traditional (apple, orange, vanilla) and somewhat more elusive (blue mist, cocktail). But a hot toddy&#x2014;which may have already been stricken from the menu, a shame&#x2014;was a welcome mug of sweet booze, as was the Perfect Gentleman, a robust mix of bourbon, sweet vermouth and a cucumber and rose-infused dry vermouth. Mulberry Project alum Scott Fitzgerald is behind the cocktails, creating twists on daquiris, fizzes, martinis and collins with popular mixology additions like tarragon, agave and lavender-violet liqueur. </p>

<p>The bi-level space formerly housed a flower shop and touches of nature still linger in the many wall-mounted window boxes filled with ferns and dangling plants and the handsome wall of greenery on the second floor. The bar and dining area below invite guests looking for a meal but beware late-night seatings, where it seems the restaurant caters more to the club crowd with the aforementioned entertainment. A second floor lounge area looks to offer a less frenzied environment for hookah smoking and cocktail sipping; it&apos;s also where the coat check lives, which should give you an indication of the type of spot you&apos;re visiting.  </p>

<p>I felt underdressed on my visit, upstaged by a sea of tiny black dresses teetering on five-inch stilettos, so be forewarned this isn&apos;t the kind of place for an impromptu plate of kabobs following a jog in the park. It&apos;s also not really &quot;my kind of place,&quot; with its curtains and low couches and Top 40 soundtrack; but it&apos;s certainly worth throwing on a pair of heels for Happy Hour on weeknights from 5 p.m. to 8 p.m., where the hummus and feta olive samplers go for just $6, glasses of wine for $6 and hookah for $15. If you&apos;re lucky, the fashionistas won&apos;t arrive until you&apos;re pleasantly sated and ready to roll.</p>
