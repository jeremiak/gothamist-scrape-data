<p>Regardless of which side of the BQE you find yourself, Grand Street in Williamsburg packs a powerful culinary punch, where dozens of restaurants and bars of all types of cuisines are represented. Next week, some eateries who reside in the eastern section of the stretch are throwing a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170214020838/http://gothamist.com/2014/02/17/restaurant_week_highlights_diverse.php">now annual</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170214020838/http://grandstbklyn.com/wordpress/?p=6554">Grand Street Restaurant Week</a> to highlight some delicious local businesses, with low-priced lunches and dinners on offer from February 22nd through February 28th. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170214020838/http://mashaandthebear.nyc/">Masha &amp; the Bear&apos;s</a> tasty pelmeni, pictured above, are one option for the restaurant&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170214020838/http://grandstbklyn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Masha-Lunch-Menu.pdf">$10, two-course lunch</a>; at dinner, it&apos;s $30 for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170214020838/http://grandstbklyn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Masha-Dinner-Menu.pdf">three courses</a> of dishes spanning nearly the entire menu. Grand Morelos Diner &amp; Bakery will keep you plied with guacamole, flautas or burritos for even less, with a two-course lunch for $8.95 and a three-course dinner for $18.95. </p>
