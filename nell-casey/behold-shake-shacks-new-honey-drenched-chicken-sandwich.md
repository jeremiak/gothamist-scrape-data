<p>Last summer, Danny Meyer&apos;s unstoppable burger chain Shake Shack debuted their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110102432/http://gothamist.com/2015/07/07/shake_shack_chicken.php">first fried chicken sandwich</a>, a staple in the fast food lexicon. It was a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110102432/http://gothamist.com/2015/07/07/shake_shack_chicken_post_mortem.php#photo-1">game-changing addition</a> to the menu and the team&apos;s now seeking to hit the jackpot another time with the introduction of their second chicken offering beginning today at Brooklyn Shacks.</p>

<p>Salt &amp; Pepper Honey Chick&#x2019;n ($6.29) isn&apos;t so much a completely new sandwich as it is their original chicken offering slathered in a salted honey sauce with ground black pepper. But the sweet/salty combo&apos;s a proven performer, given honey&apos;s long, fruitful collaboration with fried chicken. If only they served it on a biscuit and they&apos;d be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110102432/http://whataburger.com/food/item/honey-butter-chicken-biscuit">closer to perfection</a>.</p>

<p>It only took two days last time for the public to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110102432/http://gothamist.com/2015/07/09/shake_shack_chicken_sold_out.php">decimate the supply</a> of chicken sandwiches. Good luck out there.</p>
