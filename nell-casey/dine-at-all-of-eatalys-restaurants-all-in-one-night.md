<p>Visiting Eataly can be an overwhelming experience. The tourist-mobbed aisles aside&#x2014;the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108044332/http://gothamist.com/2016/08/02/eataly_wtc_carbs_bread.php#photo-1">new FiDi location</a> should help with that&#x2014;there are decisions about where to go and what to eat, between the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108044332/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/11/eataly_tuscan_takeover.php">many different restaurants</a> featured under the Eataly umbrella. But in October, for one night only, you can eat at just about all of them&#x2014;one course at a time.</p>

<p>This fall marks the return of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108044332/http://www.identitagolose.com/">Identit&#xE0; Golose</a>, a days-long celebration in October of contemporary Italian cuisine that brings celebrated chefs from Italy and pairs them with their contemporaries in the United States. Now in its 7th year at Eataly, the culinary event features master classes and dinners, which are not nearly as stuffy&#x2014;the wine is VERY free-flowing&#x2014;as they might sound.</p>

<p>There&apos;s a bit of a break with tradition this year, however, as the gala dinners have been replaced by a one-night, dine-around event that unfolds course by course across six Eataly restaurants. At each, either a NYC or an abroad-based chef prepares one dish, including vegan hotspot 00 + Co.&apos;s Matthew Kenny; Massimo Bottura, considered one of the world&apos;s best chefs; and Alex Atala, a Sao Paolo-based chef one might recognize from <em>Mind of a Chef</em>. All the courses come with a wine pairing, too.</p>

<p>Tickets to the October 6th dinner are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108044332/https://www.eataly.com/us_en/classes-and-events/new-york/nyc-special-events">$190 per person</a> and sessions begin at 5 p.m. and every 45 minutes following &apos;til 9 p.m. Identit&#xE0; Golose also offers seminars by the participating chefs, like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108044332/https://www.eataly.com/us_en/classes-and-events/new-york/nyc-special-events/identita-golose-seminar-with-franco-pepe-lidia-bastianich-2016-10-04-1891">making pizza</a> with Lidia Bastianich and Franco Pepe. </p>
