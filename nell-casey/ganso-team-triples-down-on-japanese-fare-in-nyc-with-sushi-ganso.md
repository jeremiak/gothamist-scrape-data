<p>The duo behind the growing fleet of Ganso restaurants debuted their third Japanese eatery with last night&apos;s opening of Sushi Ganso, serving sushi and sashimi adjacent to their izakaya-style restaurant Ganso Yaki. Fish sourced from both the United States and Japan is the main thrust, of course, including sashimi, Makimono (&quot;classic rolls&quot;) and Chirashi ($29), a raw fish dish from Osaka that&apos;s served over seasoned rice. This <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160710155331/http://nypost.com/2016/02/17/hot-skinny-people-are-ditching-salads-for-power-bowls/">pre-dates the &quot;bowl&quot; trend</a>, guys.</p>

<p>Tokyo-trained Sushi Chef Tomo Hayashi decides the selections in the 11 course Omakase ($48), which includes 10 pieces of sushi plus one roll. A la carte selections include individual portions of sushi or sashimi, from uni ($6) to ika ($3, Yari squid), hamachi ($4, yellowtail) to hotate ($4, sea scallop). Rolls and hand rolls eschew anything flashy for more simple preparations of Negi Hamachi ($7, yellowtail and scallion) and Saba Gari ($6, mackerel and ginger). </p>

<p>Partners Harris Salat and Tadashi Ono also run Ganso Ramen, a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160710155331/http://gothamist.com/2015/09/24/michelin_bib_gourmand_nyc_2015.php">Michelin-recommended</a> ramen restaurant in Downtown Brooklyn.</p>
