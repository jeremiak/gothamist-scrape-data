<p>Ladieeees! Are you tired of sneaking booze into stadiums and concerts in a boring old flask? Worried your <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507003335/http://www.amazon.com/The-WineRack-200-008-Wine-Medium/dp/B001FYZZI2">wine bra</a> will explode all over your new blouse? Well say goodbye to fear and hello to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507003335/http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DOA3FYQ/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00DOA3FYQ&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=f0fccd-20">Tampon Stealth Flasks</a>, the classiest new way to conceal your <strike>alcoholism</strike> thriftiness.</p>

<p>Each order contains five plastic vials concealed inside plastic wrappers that are made to look like feminine products. The genius innovators at SmuggleYourBooze.com also sell <strike>colostomy bags</strike> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507003335/http://smuggleyourbooze.com/buy.php">Boobie Bags</a> and fake sunscreen bottles if the idea of booze tampons turns you off. Hey, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507003335/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/22/shameless_blogger_actually_does_tha.php">it could be worse</a>!</p>

<p>The set retails for $14.59 (available on Prime!) or save money and buy a used tampon (I&apos;m so sorry) for just $9.99. Dudes might feel awkward asking their gal pals to borrow a tampon&#x2014;this is how the other half lives, boys!&#x2014;but it&apos;s a hell of a lot less painful than <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507003335/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/27/vodka_eyeballing_trend_jumps_the_po.php">eyedrops</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507003335/http://gothamist.com/2012/09/26/tomorrows_hot_new_alcohol_trend_tod.php">enemas</a>. </p>
