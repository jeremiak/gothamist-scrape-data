					<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170615214713/http://gothamist.com/tags/hudsonyards">Hudson Yards</a> mega-development has lost a Meyer but gained a Momofuku, plus a slew of other celebrity chefs and a giant food hall dedicated to the cuisines of Spain. Dining plans for three of the 18 million square foot &quot;new neighborhood,&quot; as it&apos;s being called by developers Related Companies and Oxford Properties Group, will include many big name restaurateurs to anchor the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170615214713/http://www.hudsonyardsnewyork.com/fine-dining-nyc/">dining and nightlife amenities</a>.</p>

<p>Danny Meyer was originally slated to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170615214713/http://gothamist.com/2015/05/19/danny_meyer_food_hall_hudson_yards.php">open a food hall concept</a>, but he&apos;s been replaced by chef Jos&#xE9; Andr&#xE9;s, who&apos;ll operate what <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170615214713/http://nypost.com/2017/05/08/celeb-chef-jose-andres-opening-spanish-eataly-at-hudson-yards/">the Post is calling</a> the &quot;Spanish Eataly.&quot; Press materials for the forthcoming concept&#x2014;which will be located inside 10 Hudson Yards under the High Line&#x2014;refer to it as &quot;a sprawling 35,000-square-foot space that will be the ultimate gathering place celebrating all things Espa&#xF1;a&quot; and a &quot;Spanish culinary extravaganza...a dynamic, all-day, indoor-outdoor destination for Spanish food, drink and culture.&quot; </p>

<p>Acclaimed Spanish chefs Ferran and Albert Adri&#xE0; will also be part of the food hall, which will include a &quot;world-class tapas bar&quot; in addition to imported items including Spanish jamon and olive oils. </p>

<p>The prolific chef and his company, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170615214713/http://www.thinkfoodgroup.com/">ThinkFoodGroup</a>&#x2014;which will operate the food hall&#x2014;appear to be doing well after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170615214713/http://dcist.com/2017/04/trump_settles_with_jose_andres.php">settling lawsuits</a> with the Trump Organization after Andr&#xE9;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170615214713/http://dcist.com/2015/07/jose_andres_is_backing_out_of_trump.php">pulled the plug</a> on a planned Spanish restaurant in a forthcoming Trump-owned hotel in DC, calling it &quot;impossible&quot; to be affiliated with Trump.</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="050916hudson2.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170615214713im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_nellcasey/050916hudson2.jpg" width="640" height="348"> <br> <i> (courtesy Related-Oxford)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>David Chang also has plans to open a large new entry into his Momofuku fleet inside the development. There are plans for an over 5,000-square-foot new restaurant with globally-inspired cuisine from the United States, Japan and Korea. The restaurant is slated to include both a sit-down restaurant and a &quot;new takeaway concept&quot; that could piggyback on the success of Chang&apos;s fast casual <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170615214713/http://gothamist.com/tags/fuku">fried chicken fleet Fuku</a> and his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170615214713/http://gothamist.com/2017/04/24/ando_downtown_david_chang.php">burgeoning delivery-only service Ando</a>. &quot;It won&#x2019;t be like my other restaurants,&quot; Chang <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170615214713/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/09/dining/hudson-yards-restaurants.html">promised the Times</a>. </p>

<p>Chef Thomas Keller (Per Se), Chef Michael Lomonaco (Porter House Bar and Grill), Chef Costas Spiliadis (Estiatorio Milos), a &quot;modern brasserie concept from D&amp;D; London,&quot; and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170615214713/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/09/dining/hudson-yards-restaurants.html">other sit-down restaurants</a> are also planned for 55 Hudson Yards, 50 Hudson Yards, 10 Hudson Yards and the pavilion in the Public Square and Gardens, along with Bouchon Bakery and Jack&apos;s Stir Brew Coffee outlets. </p>
