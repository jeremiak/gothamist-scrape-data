<p>After <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151031153350/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/09/inside_tobys_estate_coffee_big_new.php#photo-5">conquering the coffee connoisseurs in Williamsburg</a>, Australian company <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151031153350/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/09/inside_tobys_estate_coffee_big_new.php#photo-5">Toby&apos;s Estate</a> takes on Manhattan with a new espresso bar on 5th Avenue in the Flatiron District. Unlike its giant predecessor in Brooklyn&#x2014;which tripled as a roasting space and coffee school&#x2014;the new bar operates inside the Club Monaco flagship store, so if you&apos;re in the market for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151031153350/http://www.clubmonaco.com/product/index.jsp?productId=24789786&amp;cp=12243590.12243597.23316166&amp;ab=ln_women_thelatest_newarrivals">$200 overalls</a>, this is one-stop shopping.</p>

<p>The company sources beans from sustainable farms in Honduras, Ethiopia, Colombia and beyond, which they&apos;ll roast in Brooklyn to transport to the new outlet. Beverages are created using a specialty Strada coffee machine, customized to the exacting standards of the owners, who went so far as to disassemble the machine and rebuild it to their specifications. Visitors can order a variety of espresso drinks&#x2014;made with their new custom &quot;Flatiron Espresso Blend&quot; and others&#x2014;in addition to pour over coffees. If you&apos;re looking for a little more than a shot for the road, the bar also offers house-made sandwiches and bakery items from local establishments.</p>

<p>Inside the cafe, the loft-like Brooklyn vibe is replaced with a more neighborhood appropriate recreation of a Gilded Age shop, with lots of marble, tile and pressed tin. Still, they haven&apos;t left their roots behind completely: the space also features handmade glass pendant lighting, antique mirror tiles and even a &quot;vintage trash can.&quot;</p>
