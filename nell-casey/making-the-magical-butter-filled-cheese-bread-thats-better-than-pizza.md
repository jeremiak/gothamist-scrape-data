<p>Cheese, butter, bread and egg, the four simple components used to make one of the world&apos;s most delicious, totally guilt-free dishes: adjaruli khachapuri. It&apos;s a dish <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108030548/http://gothamist.com/2014/04/29/khachapuri.php">common to the city&apos;s Georgian restaurants</a>, many of which are clustered in neighborhoods including Brighton Beach and Sheepshead Bay. But there&apos;s an outpost of Eurasian flair in the East Village at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108030548/http://odahouse.com/">Oda House</a> that&apos;ll save Metrocard fare for those of us not lucky enough to live in the khachapuri-saturated neighborhoods of southern Brooklyn&#x2014;though the extra travel exercise wouldn&apos;t be the worst thing.</p>
