<p>The forthcoming Gowanus Whole Foods already has plans for a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508154509/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/01/gowanus_whole_foods_will_have_20000.php">giant rooftop farm</a> taking up 20,000 square feet, and now the fancy grocer says it will open a new top floor beer bar called, well, The Roof. The store will maintain an indoor bar on the top floor as well as an additional outside rooftop deck, which will operate during the more temperate months with heat lamps on snappy spring and fall evenings. Can&apos;t beat <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508154509/http://gothamist.com/tags/gowanuscanal">that view</a>!</p>

<p>The bar will offer a &quot;local and exclusive&quot; selection of 16 tap beers that will be rotated throughout the seasons, in addition to canned and bottled beers. For the opening lineup the grocer will be pouring brews from Evil Twin, Sixpoint, Captain Lawrence, Stillwater and Westbrook Brewing, though specific varieties have yet to be decided. Similar to their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508154509/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/10/smorgasburg_and_whole_foods_sitting.php">local partnerships at other stores</a>, The Roof will offer a food menu with eats from Brooklyn Brine, Brooklyn Cured and other borough-based eateries, with bites like cheeses, burgers and baked goods on the lineup as well as offerings for the vegan and vegetarian set.</p>
