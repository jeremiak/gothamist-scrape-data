(NY1)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>Gothamist&apos;s devotion to Canadian son Pat Kiernan is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160325054519/http://gothamist.com/tags/patkiernan">well documented</a>, but it was fellow NY1 reporter Roger Clark who shredded his way into the spotlight this morning. In a segment about tonight&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160325054519/http://www.boweryballroom.com/event/261053-us-air-guitar-semifinals-new-york">US Air Guitar Semifinals</a> at the Bowery Ballroom, Clark showcased some&#x2026;enthusiastic!&#x2026;air guitar skills at local bar <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160325054519/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/25/one_mile_house_again.php#photo-1">One Mile House</a>. Look out for Kiernan&apos;s complete loss for words around the 30 second mark:</p>

<p>Clark got a lot of buzz for his energetic performance, earning him some new fans, no doubt. But guys, Roger Clark has always been awesome, like the time he attempted to breakdance:</p>

<p>His <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160325054519/https://twitter.com/RogerClark41">Twitter feed</a> is also glorious, regularly Tweeting things like music recommendations:</p>

<p>Basically, Roger Clark is exactly the kind of guy you want dishing out your news on air guitar championships and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160325054519/https://twitter.com/RogerClark41/status/339343118631596033">dressing up as corn</a>. </p>

<p>Bonus: Clark also rocked out to some Kansas this morning and couldn&apos;t resist singing along, which it turns out isn&apos;t <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160325054519/http://usairguitar.com/rules-2/">against the rules</a>!</p>
