<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509140900/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/17/brooklyn_flea_opening_seaport_food.php">constantly expanding</a> Smorgasburg artisanal food encampment is trading its <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509140900/http://gothamist.com/2012/08/29/smorgasburg_coming_to_dumbo_sundays.php">home of one year</a> at the Tobacco Warehouse for a prime spot at Brooklyn Bridge Park&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509140900/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/13/photos_pier_5_opens_in_brooklyn_bri.php#photo-11">revamped Pier 5</a>. Starting this weekend, vendors set up in the much larger waterfront spot, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509140900/http://www.grubstreet.com/2013/10/smorgasburg-fall-season.html">GrubStreet reports</a>. &quot;It will be almost as big as the Williamsburg location,&quot; reveals Brooklyn Flea co-founder Eric Demby. This means more vendors for the Sunday setup, including Keizo Shiamamoto and his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509140900/http://gothamist.com/tags/ramenburger">Ramen Burger</a>.</p>

<p>The Saturday iteration of Smorgasburg/Brooklyn Feal also moves&#x2014;for the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509140900/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/01/smorgasburg_returns_to_williamsburg.php">second time this year</a>&#x2014;into a second floor space at 185 Wythe Street. The market  typically occupies One Hanson, but starting November 30th will make the move, bringing 60 of their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509140900/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/09/photos_what_to_eat_and_drink_at_smo.php#photo-1">great food vendors</a> and 90 Flea vendors to the Williamsburg space. </p>

<p>Completing the Brooklyn trifecta, Brooklyn Flea&apos;s weekend market in Park Slope tapped Roberto Santibanez of Fonda to be the lone food vendor. He&apos;s expected to offer a selection of tortas and Mexican sodas at the outpost at P.S. 321 on Seventh Avenue. </p>
