<p>We were content to let Patrick Stewart&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150601001927/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/31/you_can_all_stop_trying_patrick_ste.php">adorable lobster costume</a> stand without context&#x2014;why <em>wouldn&apos;t</em> a grown man don a lobster costume and sit in a bathtub? But the venerable actor revealed to the <em>Daily Show</em> last night that his lobster impersonation <em>almost didn&apos;t happen</em> because he&apos;s worn out from his career of wearing costumes. </p>

<p>&quot;I&apos;m an actor, we don&apos;t put on costumes,&quot; Sir Patrick had told his wife. &quot;We leave that to civilians because we spends our days wearing costumes. No! No costume!&quot; Stewart&apos;s wife, singer Sunny Ozell, knew better than to listen to him; she found the costume online and ordered it. As soon as it came out of the box &quot;I had to put it on!&quot; Stewart exclaimed.</p>

<p>Costume backstory aside, the laugh-filled interview boils down to one quote about Stewart&apos;s philosophy regarding his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150601001927/http://gothamist.com/tags/patrickstewart">social media precense</a>: &quot;We have fun with this and if it makes us laugh then we like to share it with the world.&quot; And for that, we thank you Professor. </p>
