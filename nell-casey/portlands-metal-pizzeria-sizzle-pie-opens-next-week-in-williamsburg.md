					<p>Their motto is &quot;Death To False Pizza&quot;&#x2014;that&apos;s how you know <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170128194503/https://sizzlepie.pizza/">Sizzle Pie</a> doesn&apos;t fuck around.</p>

<p>The Portland-born pizzeria moves into Williamsburg next Monday, transforming the former Grandma Rose&apos;s pizzeria into a pie slinging joint that&apos;d send most grannies <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170128194503/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86URGgqONvA">running to the hills</a>. </p>

<p>&quot;There was a zine in the &apos;80s called <em>Death To False Metal</em>; very short lived, very small thing, but very impactful to the music scene. It was one of the first times there was a metal zine,&quot; explains Sizzle Pie owner Mikey McKennedy. &quot;It&apos;s really just something stupid that I said one night and my business partner was like, &apos;Dude&#x2014;that&apos;s it!&apos;&quot;</p>

<p>Oregonians know Sizzle Pie as much for its rockin&apos; pizza as they do its metal-minded aesthetic. &quot;A lot of the stuff that comprises our brand that people will point to as these decisions we made were just extensions of our personality at the beginning,&quot; McKennedy admits. &quot;We just weren&apos;t that talented or smart to really think of a &apos;brand idea.&apos;&quot;</p>

<p>Be that as it may, the restaurants are known for supporting artists through <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170128194503/https://sizzlepie.pizza/sizzle-pie-art-shows/">regular shows</a>, and McKennedy&apos;s responsible for the artwork that adorns the walls of his restaurants. They&apos;re also infusing their pizza and their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170128194503/https://www.instagram.com/sizzlepie/">Instagram page</a> with metal, movie memes, and inside jokes. </p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="012517sizzle1.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170128194503im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_nellcasey/012517sizzle1.jpg" width="640" height="427"> <br> <i> (Scott Heins/Gothamist)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>&quot;All the menu items that I name are usually kind of sarcastic, to say the least, or witty, or band references,&quot; McKennedy says. &quot;It&apos;s usually stuff that I think is so dumb sounding it&apos;s funny and makes me chuckle and it goes from there.&quot;</p>

<p>That&apos;s how you get pies like 6 Degrees Of Kevin Bacon (Canadian bacon and pineappe); It&apos;s Always Sunny In Portland (shaved beef steak, green peppers, white onions and Italian provolone); Vegan Angel Of Doom (vegan mozzarella, jalapenos, pineapple, shaved almonds and cilantro); and their signature pie, The Ol&apos; Dirty (salami, ricotta, olive oil and pepperoncinis). </p>

<p>&quot;Our meat-eating population is diehard,&quot; McKennedy says, but the pizzeria&apos;s a well-known vegan destination (McKennedy himself is now vegan) even in places like Portland where almost everywhere offers vegan foods. &quot;It&apos;s just something we did. A lot of people from the beginning were like, &apos;You&apos;re gonna lose your asses on money and food costs&apos; and we just said, &apos;I don&apos;t think so.&apos; It is more expensive, but the return is we make good vegan food.&quot; </p>

<p>Their vegan ranch for the salads has even become one of their most popular menu items.  </p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="012517sizzle2.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170128194503im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_nellcasey/012517sizzle2.jpg" width="640" height="427"> <br> <i> Evil Never Dies: Spicy Aardvark Blended Red Sauce, Tofu Cheese, Seitan Chorizo, Tomato, Jalapeno, Red Onion, and Fresh Cilantro (vegan) (Scott Heins/Gothamist)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>Whether or not they make quality vegan food will be moot to most New Yorkers if the pizza itself doesn&apos;t live up to the city&apos;s exacting standards. </p>

<p>Sizzle cooks their pizzas in a gas oven, but McKennedy keeps mum on the flour they&apos;re using, letting slip only that it&apos;s a local equivalent to what they&apos;re using in the Northwest. McKennedy says he modeled his pies after the ones coming out of Brooklyn in both the crust and the sauce styles. </p>

<p>&quot;But we&apos;re sensitive to saying that because you see crazy shit on the west coast that you don&apos;t see on the east coast. Then they&apos;re like, &quot;New York-style pizza!&apos; and you&apos;re like, &apos;No, that&apos;s not, that&apos;s not.&apos; McKennedy laughs. &quot;We like to say we&apos;re east-meets-west.&quot; </p>

<p>Sizzle Pie&apos;s dropping this first location in Williamsburg, followed by another on the neighborhood&apos;s southside and a third location in Bushwick, so they&apos;re already banking on finding some love in NYC.</p>

<p>&quot;We haven&apos;t had any discussions like, &quot;Okay, what&apos;re we gonna do to impress New York?&apos; We know our food is good,&quot; McKennedy states. &quot;We are going to be very humble and just try to appreciate the fact that we&apos;re in this amazing neighborhood and that&apos;s the thing. We&apos;re gonna go in here, do what we do, and just kinda be quiet and try not to come across like assholes.&quot;</p>
