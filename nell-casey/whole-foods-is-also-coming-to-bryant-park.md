<p>If this morning&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508154453/http://gothamist.com/2013/12/17/brooklyn_herd_stampedes_into_whole.php">Greatest Supermarket Opening Of Our Time</a> wasn&apos;t enough for you, get ready for more Whole Foods in your face. The luxury grocer has announced plans for <em>yet another</em> pricey market, this time in Midtown <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508154453/http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304858104579262212530432216">right next to Bryant Park</a>. The WSJ reports that the grocer has inked a deal for a 32,000, two-floor space at 1095 Sixth Avenue between 41st and 42nd Streets; it will be the one of four new stores planned for the city, including outlets in Harlem and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508154453/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/03/whole_foods_williamsburg.php">Williamsburg</a>.</p>

<p>Unlike their other NYC markets, the Midtown offering will skew more towards prepared foods to entice lunchtime visits from area workers and picnic-ers in the park. &quot;It&apos;s a different take for them,&quot; Faith Hope Consolo, chairman of Douglas Elliman&apos;s retail group, told the WSJ. &quot;They&apos;ve always plopped themselves in a big residential, mostly residential [area].&quot; The chain has been doing more restaurant-style offerings in recent years, like the multi-store collaboration with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508154453/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/13/yuji_ramen_evil_twin_brewing_coming.php">Yuji Ramen</a>, among others. Hopefully that means less risk of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508154453/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/10/oops_whole_foods_labeled_real_chick.php">accidental meat ingestion</a>. </p>
