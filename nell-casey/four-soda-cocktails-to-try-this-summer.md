<p>Rumor has it soda cocktails are <em>all the rage</em> this summer with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151018170637/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/22/demi_mondes_housemade_soda_cocktail.php#photo-1">Demi Monde mixing up their own versions</a> with their house-made &quot;custom soda carbonation system.&quot; That&apos;s all well and good when you&apos;re in the mood to feel fancy but summer is also about kicking back and keeping it casual, <em>man</em>, and you don&apos;t need no fancy carbonation system to add some bubbly to your booze. If you&apos;ve ever mixed soda into your Carlo Rossi you know what we&apos;re talking about. So, let&apos;s look at some grown-up versions of the Soda Rossi, even if <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151018170637/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/30/bloomberg_wants_to_ban_sugary_drink.php">Mayor Bloomberg might frown upon it</a>.</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="cokewine05.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20151018170637im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/cokewine05.jpeg" width="224" height="279" class="image-right"> </span><strong>KALIMOTXO</strong>&#x2014;or Calimocho as we knew it in college&#x2014;combines red wine, cola and ice for a sweet yet tangy flavor. A bold Shiraz or Cab would go well with a plain variety cola, but combine more delicate Merlots with your favorite fizzy flavors for something a little different. Even though it sounds strange, we think diet cola tastes the best and has the added value of being significantly less caloric. You win this round, Bloomie.</p>

<p>The Brits really know how to tie one on so it makes perfect sense that the <strong>SHANDY</strong> originated in the UK. The traditional application involves lager and lemon-lime flavored soda, but this drink can come together any way your imagination and taste buds can think of. We&apos;ve tried Blue Moon and Sprite, pale ales with ginger ale, and even porters with root beer. You could also try the Snakebite by substituting hard cider (it&apos;s like boozy soda anyway) for the pop.</p>

<p>And finally, channel your inner 57-year-old woman with a refreshing <strong>WINE SPRITZERS</strong> [ed. note: I would like to point out that wine spritzers aren&apos;t just for your quirky Aunt Sheila anymore. It is PERFECTLY ACCEPTABLE to order these at bars, no matter what age. &#x2014; Carlson]. The basic recipe calls for crisp white wine combined with citrus soda or seltzer, if you&apos;re keeping it simple. But jazzing it up with your favorite frozen fruit adds extra flavor and looks pretty to boot (we recommend <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151018170637/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/25/its_national_wine_day.php">raspberries and lemons</a>). Off-beat soda flavors&#x2014;strawberry, peach, grapefruit&#x2014;are also fun to try, as are adding fruit juices, bitters, simple syrups, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151018170637/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/20/magazine/its-time-to-update-the-wine-spritzer.html">other spirits</a> and fresh herbs like mint and basil. Don&apos;t be afraid to try something new, it&apos;s liberating, isn&apos;t it?</p>

<p>Speaking of bitters, <strong>FERNET BRANCA</strong> is a type of bitter (which contains 45% alcohol by volume) that pairs up well with Coke, served either at room temperature or on the rocks. But be warned: the flavor has been described as &quot;black licorice-flavored Listerine&quot; and &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151018170637/http://www.fromargentinawithlove.typepad.com/from_argentina_with_love/2009/07/argentinean-mixology-fernet-and-coke.html">medicinal</a>,&quot; so it may be an acquired taste.</p>
