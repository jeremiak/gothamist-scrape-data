<p>America&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505135441/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/01/cruelest_april_fools_joke_so_far_in.php#photo-1">cult-like devotion</a> to regional fast food chains <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505135441/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/28/bad_deal_website_charging_56_for_tw.php">gets a little ridiculous</a> sometimes, but fans of a certain North Carolina-based biscuit joint won&apos;t need to travel south of the Mason Dixon line for their fluffy breakfast breads anymore. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505135441/http://www.hardees.com/">Hardee&apos;s</a> biscuit and burger chain announced plans today to open 200 new restaurants in the Northeast in the next five years, starting in New York and New Jersey, and to ultimately open 1,000 new restaurants in the region. </p>

<p>Hardee&apos;s had operated restaurants in the region but they all closed by the &apos;90s when they were bought by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505135441/http://www.ckr.com/index.html">CKE Restaurants</a>, which also operates sister brand Carl&apos;s Jr. No specifics yet about where and when the restaurants will open, but a press release gives a timeline of 12 to 18 months before we&apos;ll be gorging on Thickburgers&#xAE;.</p>

<p>The chain first opened in the 1960 in Greenville, NC, serving &quot;charco-broiled&quot; hamburgers but they&apos;re best loved for their Made from Scratch&#x2122; biscuits, which they top with all manner of breakfast meats&#x2014;including <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505135441/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMmttUwuvW0"><em>fried bologna</em></a>!&#x2014;on their delicious breakfast menu. They also fry up some decent fast food chicken for tenders and sandwiches plus hand scooped shakes and malts. </p>

<p>Hopefully they&apos;ll bring back the old commercials for their Cinnamon &apos;N&apos; Raisin biscuit; the world is such a sad place without these Motown raisins. </p>
