<p>Two visitors to an upstate Mexican eatery this weekend just wanted to exercise their right to eat enchiladas, but were allegedly told to leave the restaurant for being Trump supporters. Esther Levy and dining companion Alvin Goldstein claim that a waitress at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021111432/http://www.cancuninnrestaurant.com/">Cancun Inn Restaurant</a> in Sugar Loaf, NY told them they needed to go shortly after ordering a round of sangrias, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021111432/http://nypost.com/2016/07/05/trump-supporter-says-mexican-restaurant-refused-to-serve-her/">the Post reports</a>. Levy claims her &quot;Make America Great Again&quot; hat and Donald Trump button attire precipitated the ousting.</p>

<p>&quot;On the way out, the co-owner decided to yell at me and humiliate me,&quot; Levy told the tabloid. &quot;He said, &apos;We don&apos;t serve Trump supporters here. Get out of here and never come back.&apos;&quot; Goldstein further claims that he and the unnamed co-owner exchanged verbal spars over who would win the election in November. &quot;I certainly won&#x2019;t be back there,&quot; he promised. &quot;It was horrific what happened. I&#x2019;m not used to being thrown out of restaurants.&quot;</p>

<p>The restaurant paints a very different picture of the alleged incident. In a posting <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021111432/https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=1114110632016469&amp;id=139562686137940">on their Facebook page</a>, a man claiming to be the son of one of the owners posted a statement claiming the would-be diners were asked to leave because &quot;they were being rude to the staff and rowdy due to intoxication.&quot; The restaurant says they&apos;ve never discriminated against anyone and that they&apos;ll be looking into the incident further.</p>

<p>Naturally, both the restaurant&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021111432/https://www.facebook.com/Cancun-Inn-Restaurant-139562686137940/?fref=nf">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021111432/http://www.yelp.com/biz/cancun-inn-sugar-loaf">Yelp</a> pages have devolved into a stream of posts by Trump supporters&#x2014;with a few anti-Trump sentiments mixed in&#x2014;blasting the restaurant with one star reviews. Levy, who claims to have visited the restaurant for the past 25 years, looks to be one of many Trump fans who will be boycotting the restaurant. Trump Tower Grill serves <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021111432/http://gothamist.com/2016/05/05/picture_trumps_lower_intestine.php">the best taco salads</a> anyway.</p>
