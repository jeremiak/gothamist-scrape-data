<p>The burger gods smiled down upon us today with news that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130918042054/http://gothamist.com/tags/shakeshack">Shake Shack</a> finally <em>finally</em> <strong><em>FINALLY</em></strong> took the hint that the frozen crinkle-cut potato product they were passing off as french fries wasn&apos;t going to fly in this town. The chain <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130918042054/http://www.shakeshack.com/2013/08/06/fresh-cut-fries-debut-at-ues-shake-shack/">announced the switch</a> today, effective immediately at their Upper East Side outpost only&#x2014;at least for the time being. CEO Randy Garutti <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130918042054/http://aht.seriouseats.com/archives/2013/08/shake-shack-to-premiere-fresh-cut-fries-at-ues-location-today.html?ref=title">told Serious Eats</a> all new Shake Shacks will serve the fresh fries and current kitchens will be remodeled to accommodate the new machinery. </p>

<p>Idaho Russet potatoes make up the new fries, which will be hand-cut, skin-on, twice-cooked and probably-delicious. Hopefully this means we get to update our <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130918042054/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/30/the_best_french_fries_in_new_york_c.php">best french fries list</a> soon.</p>
