<p>On-again, off-again East Village biscuit shop Empire Biscuit has officially bit the dust. EV Grieve&apos;s been tracking the shop&apos;s erratic schedule over the past year&#x2014;noting it was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171015140446/http://evgrieve.com/2016/01/empire-biscuit-is-taking-some-time-for.html">barely open in 2016</a>&#x2014;and now reports that a &quot;for rent&quot; sign has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171015140446/http://evgrieve.com/2017/02/the-empire-has-officially-fallen-former.html">arrived on the front window</a>, indicating there&apos;ll be no more drunken biscuit-eating at the location anytime in the near future (the sign says no bars or restaurants).</p>

<p>If paperwork that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171015140446/http://evgrieve.com/2016/10/empire-biscuit-has-until-tuesday-to-pay.html">appeared at the space</a> in October is gospel, the shop owed quite a bit in rent. We&apos;ve reached out to owners Jonathan and Yonadav for comment and we&apos;ll update if we hear back. </p>

<p>In November, a new <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171015140446/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/30/post_biscuit_east_village.php">biscuit eatery</a> opened on Avenue B to fill the hole. You can also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171015140446/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/14/skip_the_hype_and_make_your_own_dam.php">make your own damn biscuits</a>.</p>
