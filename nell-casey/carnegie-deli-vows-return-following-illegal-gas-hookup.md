<p>Touristy pastrami palace Carnegie Deli is still closed nine months after Con Edison inspectors <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160611041126/http://gothamist.com/2015/04/25/carnegie_deli_shuttered_over_allege.php">found improper gas piping</a> installed in the Midtown eatery&apos;s basement. The discovery led to a stop work order by the Department of Buildings that has remained in place despite <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160611041126/http://gothamist.com/2015/11/08/carnegie_deli_limbo.php">repairs by the ownership</a> to get the building up to code. In light of the longtime closure, the 79-year-old deli has vowed that it will reopen.</p>

<p>A note <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160611041126/http://vanishingnewyork.blogspot.com/2016/02/carnegie-deli-comeback.html">shared with Jeremiah&apos;s Vanishing New York</a> insists that the deli &quot;will re-open in 2016...we are ONLY temporarily closed.&quot; The note gives no further indication of when exactly they&apos;ll start serving their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160611041126/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/24/carnegie_deli_giving_tim_tebow_his.php">coronary-inducing sandwiches</a>, but at least tenants in the deli&apos;s building have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160611041126/https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20160105/times-square-theater-district/carnegie-deli-upstairs-tenats-finally-get-heat-hot-water-restored">finally gotten their heat turned on</a>, so things appear to be moving in a positive direction.</p>

<p>The troubled eatery isn&apos;t just dealing with Con Ed and the city. At the time of the illegal gas hookup discovery, owner Harper Levine was embroiled in a messy divorce with husband Sanford Levine, who was responsible for a multi-million dollar wage theft settlement the restaurant paid its workers and accused of adultery and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160611041126/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/18/theft_accusations_pile_on_adulterou.php">recipe theft</a> to start a rival business. </p>
