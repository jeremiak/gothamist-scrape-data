<p>Village clubstaurant <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171015105931/http://www.theanthonynyc.com/">The Anthony</a> launches a <strong>decadent-sounding brunch</strong> this weekend. Indulge in Lobster Benedict ($22) on a cheddar biscuit, French Onion Fondue ($14) with vegetable crudite, Breakfast Mac &amp; Cheese ($13) with chicharrones and a fried egg, and the Duck Waffle Sandwich ($22, pictured above), to which you can add an egg for $2. <br>

On Friday and Saturday evening, East Williamsburg&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171015105931/http://www.thewellbrooklyn.com/">The Well</a> will be transformed into <strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171015105931/http://brooklynbrewerymash.com/brooklyn">Beer Mansion</a></strong>, a beer playground organized by Brooklyn Brewery where each room of the venue is themed to different categories of beer. Explore the &quot;Tart of the Tropics&quot; (Sour ales, crisp pilsners and citrus-forward IPAs) or spend some time in &quot;The Darkness&quot; (Porters, stouts and Oktoberfests), just two of the five themed rooms. Beer samples are unlimited, but there will also be food on offer for purchase from Roberta&apos;s, Bunker and Frankel&apos;s. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171015105931/https://www.eventbrite.com/e/beer-mansion-brooklyn-tickets-32608943227">Tickets $65</a>.</p>
