<p>Telephobics rejoice: you&apos;ll no longer have to speak to a human being on the phone to secure an advance Cronut. Dominique Ansel <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160807033701/https://twitter.com/DominiqueAnsel/status/402467787236327424">announced</a> his new <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160807033701/http://cronutpreorder.com/products-page/cronuts/cronut/">online Cronut&#x2122; Preorder system</a>, which allows you to book your pastries two weeks in advance. Oh, and that means no line waiting, either.</p>

<p>Like the phone system that&apos;s already in place, the online system &quot;opens&quot; each Monday at 11 a.m. and allows you to &quot;reserve&quot; up to six Cronuts for pickup two weeks from the preorder date. Then you just show up to the bakery&#x2014;making sure to turn down your nose at the peons waiting on line&#x2014;stroll directly to the cashier and pick up your pastry. </p>

<p>The bakery releases a new Cronut flavor each month&#x2014;we were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160807033701/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/30/cronut_1.php">blessed with Salted Dulce de Leche in November</a>&#x2014;and have yet to announce the flavor for December. At press time there were only 12 Cronuts remaining to be preordered and they&apos;re guaranteed to be sold out by the end of the day. If you miss out this round, console yourself with a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160807033701/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/26/dominique_ansel_introduces_gorgeous.php#photo-1">nutmeg and ginger pinecone</a>, no preordering required. </p>
