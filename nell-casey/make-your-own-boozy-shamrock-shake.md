<p>Each year the hype machine cranks into full gear for the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508124212/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/15/shamrock_shakes_return.php">return of the Shamrock Shake</a>. We too are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508124212/http://gothamist.com/tags/shamrockshake">annually seduced</a> by the Kelly Green drink, which has been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508124212/https://twitter.com/RolandoPujol/status/442401006144741376">spotted in the wild recently</a> in advance of St. Patrick&apos;s Day. But given McDonald&apos;s consistently <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508124212/http://gothamist.com/2013/12/05/photos_videos_fast_food_workers_pro.php">bad</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508124212/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/19/mcdonalds_continues_tone_deaf_emplo.php">behavior</a>, maybe it&apos;s time to ditch the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508124212/http://www.mcdonalds.com/us/en/food/product_nutrition.mccafe.793.793.html?%20%20itemName=Shamrock-McCafe-Shake-12-fl-oz-cup.html">preservative-packed</a> fast food milkshake in favor of something homemade&#x2014;you can even add hooch to it! The best part though: it&apos;s available all year long.</p>

<p><strong>Boozy Minty Milkshake</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>2 large scoops vanilla ice cream (more on this below)</li>
<li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
<li>1/4 cup peppermint schnapps or liquer (more on this below)
</li><li>splash of milk</li>
<li>whipped cream (optional)</li>
<li>maraschino cherry (optional)
</li></ul>

<p>A note on ice cream: fast food shakes have an airier texture than soda fountain shakes so to mimic that consistency at home you&apos;ll want to use an ice cream that&apos;s naturally softer and more aerated. Brands like Breyer&apos;s have a more whipped texture than the premium brands like H&#xE4;agen-Dazs. Flavor-wise it doesn&apos;t matter much, but if you want a more &quot;authentic&quot; Shamrock Shake knockoff it&apos;s best to source your ice cream carefully.</p>

<p>A note on the booze: most peppermint schnapps brands are clear in color so if you&apos;re using one of those varieties you&apos;ll either have to live with a white milkshake (boring) or add a few drops of green food coloring. You can combine those steps by opting for peppermint liqueur or creme de menthe instead, which often comes pre-colored to a satisfying shade of green. Flavor-wise they&apos;re about equal.</p>

<p>To make the shake: combine the ice cream, vanilla extract, peppermint hooch and milk in a blender then whip until smooth. Pour the contents into the vessel of your choice then top with whipped cream and cherry, if using. Drink immediately.
