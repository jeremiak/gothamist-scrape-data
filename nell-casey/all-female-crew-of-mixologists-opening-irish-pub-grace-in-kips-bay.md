<p>In an industry dominated by men, it&apos;s refreshing to see a new venture on the nightlife scene inspired by and created by powerful women. Enter <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150916001334/http://www.gracebarnyc.com/">Grace</a>, a new Irish pub and restaurant opening Labor Day weekend in Kips Bay. The bar takes its name from Ireland&apos;s 16th century &quot;Pirate Queen&quot; Grace O&apos;Malley, a maiden of the high seas who commanded her own fleet that took on the Royal Navy. She&apos;s a symbol of national pride in Ireland, as well as a paragon of female empowerment, thus an excellent namesake for an establishment with such heavy hitting lady mixologists. </p>

<p>The crew consists of Eryn Reece (Death &amp; Co.), Ivy Mix (Clover Club, Speed Rack), Jane Danger (The NoMad), Ms. Franky Marshall (The Dead Rabbit) and a slew of other cocktail slinging ladies known for their prowess with a bottle of hooch. The women created a cocktail list that &quot;tells the story of Grace O&apos;Malley and her accomplishments and incorporates flavors that express her domain.&quot; While we don&apos;t know what exactly that means just yet, expect &quot;spirits of the Elizabethan era&quot; like gin, brandy and sherry, among others.</p>

<p>Craft beer, wine and a &quot;formidable&quot; list of Irish whiskeys can also be procured; in keeping with pirate tradition, keep a look out for aged rum as well. No specifics about the food menu just yet but seafood will obviously play a large role. </p>
