<p>There&apos;ll be no deciding between the light and the dark for the time being as McSorley&apos;s has been temporarily shuttered by the Health Department for &quot;rat activity.&quot; A tipster <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161118235358/http://evgrieve.com/2016/11/doh-temporarily-closes-mcsorleys.html">sent pics to EV Grieve</a> with the DOH&apos;s signature yellow notices adorning the bar&apos;s front window. </p>

<p>The Health Department&apos;s inspection yesterday revealed several critical health hazards, including evidence of rat activity, food held at the wrong temperature, and conditions conducive to vermin and pest activity. Guess they shouldn&apos;t have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161118235358/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/07/doh_bans_minnie_the_cat_from_mcsorl.php">banned Minnie</a> after all!</p>

<p>The 162-year-old bar&apos;s second most recent inspection in May yielded only two violation points regarding an improperly constructed non-food surface. </p>

<p>Previously, the bar has been &quot;strongly, strongly, encouraged&quot; to remove or clean the wishbones above the chandelier (&quot;to avoid the dust from falling into the drinks of their bar patrons&quot;). </p>
