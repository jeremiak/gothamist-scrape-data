<p>New York&apos;s big moment in the sports spotlight won&apos;t be filled with nachos and chicken wings; we&apos;re going to give the people what they <em>really</em> want: KALE. The Post <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405020551/http://nypost.com/2014/01/27/veggie-fav-kale-will-be-served-at-super-bowl/">chatted with Super Bowl Chef Eric Borgia</a>, who created a chicken-sausage and Tuscan kale sandwich for the big game. &quot;Kale is so trendy right now,&quot; he explains. &quot;Every book you open up, it&apos;s all about kale and kale chips. And it&apos;s good for you.&quot; Remember when kale was cool?</p>

<p>Borgia created his &quot;Home Food Advantage&quot; menu for the big game, with dishes inspired by the boroughs (sorry Staten Island, you didn&apos;t make the cut) and the Jersey Shore. The kale creation supposedly channels Manhattan, though it&apos;d just as well stand in for the green market-obsessed population in Brooklyn. Instead, the nabe gets a nod to its Italian roots with rice balls stuffed with eggplant, tomato and ricotta salata. A grilled chicken hoagie with broccoli rabe and provolone reps the Bronx, pork and chicken steam buns nod to Queens and the Jersey Shore appears as a Philly cheesesteak. </p>

<p>Fine America, you can have kale, we&apos;ve already moved on to less mainstream leafy greens like Swiss Chard and chicory anyway. Just stay the f*ck away from our <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405020551/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/31/your_love_of_ramps_is_killing_ramps.php">ramps</a>.</p>
