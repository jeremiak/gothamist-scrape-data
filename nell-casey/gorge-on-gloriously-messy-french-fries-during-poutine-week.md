<p>French fries alone are one of the greatest foods on Earth, and when topped with cheese curds and gravy, they&apos;re practically a religious experience. We can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171007091621/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/24/weekend_food_roundup_73.php">blame Canada</a> for bringing poutine&#x2014;Montreal&apos;s official dish for stoners and drunks&#x2014;to the world, and next week, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171007091621/http://www.mileenddeli.com/">Mile End Deli</a> puts on their annual Poutine Week, offering five extra poutines to their regular offerings for our gut-busting pleasure.</p>

<p>Monday, February 13th through Sunday, February 19th, both Manhattan and Brooklyn locations will be testing the capacity of our intestines with huge platters of meaty, messy french fries&#x2014;with one vegetarian offering as well. By comparison, tomato sauce and mozzarella sounds downright calorically-friendly.</p>

<p>All the poutines are $18; here&apos;s the full lineup:</p>

<p><strong>Corn Dog Poutine</strong>: Sliced Corn Dogs, Cheese, Curds, Gravy, Fries </p>

<p><strong>Bratwurst Poutine </strong>: Beer Cheese Gravy, Bratwurst, Tater Tots </p>

<p><strong>Meatlovers Poutine</strong>: Brisket, Smoked Meat, Corned Beef, Hot Dogs, Salami, Bacon, Cheese Curds, Gravy Fries </p>

<p><strong>Duck Confit </strong>: Poutine Duck Confit Cheese Curds Gravy Fries </p>

<p><strong>Caprese Poutine</strong>: Spicy Tomato Sauce, Seared Cherry Tomatoes, Fresh Mozzarella, Garlic Oregano Fries </p>

<p><em><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171007091621/http://www.mileenddeli.com/">All three locations</a> of Mile End will participate in Poutine Week, but the kiosk in Urbanspace Vanderbilt will only be serving the Corn Dog Poutine (for now).</em></p>
