                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="081613nycfoodvideo.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20131006153232im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_nellcasey/081613nycfoodvideo.jpg" width="640" height="357"> <br> <i> <span class="photo_caption">That&apos;s foie gras paste he&apos;s squirting into his mouth</span></i></div> <p></p>

<p>Roberta&apos;s, Arthur Avenue, bagels, Elaine Kaufman, Smorgasburg, health inspectors; those are just a few of the people, places and plates called out in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131006153232/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWSqjTYJzVU">Empire Plates of Mine</a>, a new foodie-inspired spoof video about the NYC culinary scene. Look out for the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131006153232/http://gothamist.com/tags/justinwarner">Justin Warner</a> cameo and watch him squirt <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131006153232/http://gothamist.com/2011/07/10/do_or_dine_does_their_doughnuts_wit.php">foie gras paste</a> into his mouth!</p>

<p>For a spoof video, it&apos;s got an undeniable sincerity. That&apos;s likely from creator Brian Hoffman, who in addition to making videos, also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131006153232/http://www.eatthisny.com/">runs a food blog</a>. </p>

<p>But Brian! Brian, Brian Brian&#x2026;we can forgive the use of an overplayed, four-year-old song&#x2014;that&apos;s now stuck in our head, thanks buddy!&#x2014;but we can&apos;t forgive a food video claiming to have &quot;all the food options - old and new&quot; but doesn&apos;t include anything from Staten Island. Beyond its <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131006153232/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/24/50_reasons_why_staten_island_deserv.php#photo-3">ridiculously good pizza</a>, the borough&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131006153232/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/26/staten_islands_2.php">strong ethnic populations</a> also turn out some incredible eats well worth the <em>free ride</em> to the borough.</p>

<p>We get that you haven&apos;t been yet, but come on, man! <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131006153232/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/31/the_6_best_unique_dates_in_nyc.php">Grab yourself a date</a> and get over there!
