<p>Danny Bowien&apos;s powerhouse restaurant <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150310070108/http://gothamist.com/tags/missionchinese">Mission Chinese</a> has more to worry about than <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150310070108/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/14/mission_chinese_is_astoundingly_awf.php">terrible reviews</a>: the DOH shut down the restaurant last night citing a &quot;severe mouse infestation.&quot; </p>

<p>From the Health Department: </p>

<blockquote>Mission Chinese was closed by the Department of Health because of a public health hazard that could not be corrected at the time of the inspection. In this case, the restaurant had a <strong>severe mouse infestation that required professional pest control services</strong>.</blockquote>

We reached out the restaurant for an explanation but nobody picked up.</p>

<p>The restaurant received an A on its last inspection in March and with any luck will have foodiots lining up in no time. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150310070108/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/03/rat_meat_sold_as_lamb_at_chinese_fa.php">Try the lamb</a>!</p>
