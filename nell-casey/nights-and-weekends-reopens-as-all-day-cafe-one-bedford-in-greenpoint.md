					<p>The wedge of land between Nassau and Bedford in Greenpoint that was formerly home to Nights and Weekends reopens tomorrow as One Bedford, an all-day cafe and reboot by owner Alexandra Siwiec. Last year, brunch destination Five Leaves <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170318230129/http://ny.eater.com/2016/11/7/13551052/five-leaves-expansion">parted ways with Siwiec</a> as part of their nationwide expansion plans; Siwiec also runs The Good Room and forthcoming spot The Gentry. </p>

<p>One Bedford opens daily at 7 a.m. for Devocion espresso and Italian pastries like Cornetti Al Mascarpone ($3.75), flaky, croissant-like treats filled with whipped mascarpone cheese and glazed in raspberry orange blossom and other sweet lacquers. Beginning at 5 p.m. is a bistro menu including Tomato Spaghetti ($15) with fresh basil and shaved parmesan, Rustic Chicken ($19) with mushrooms and polenta, and two different types of burgers including one made with a beef and chorizo patty.</p>

<p>Stumblers from nearby bars like Berry Park or Sprizenhaus can sponge up the evening&apos;s alcohol intake with a late night menu that includes breakfast-type dishes like Eggs Florentine and an Open-Face Coque Monsieur, plus a francophile riff on chicken and waffles, Pain Perdue (French toast) et Poulet, until 3 a.m.</p>
