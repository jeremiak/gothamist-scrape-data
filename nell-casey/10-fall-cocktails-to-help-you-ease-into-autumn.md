<p>Temperatures may still be hovering in the 70s but make no mistake: autumn is <strike>coming</strike> here. And there are few things better than cuddling up and sipping a fall-themed cocktail to warm your insides on a chilly evening. Whether cupping a piping hot toddy or feeling the firewater heat you from within, there&apos;s no denying that the flavors of fall hold a special place in our booze-loving hearts. </p>

<p>Around town, mixologists are ready to tap into your foliage-induced hysteria with inventive beverages for the season. Here are ten of our favorites:</p>

<p>Lots of restaurants are taking advantage of apple season and infusing the sweet and tart flavors into their cocktails. At <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151031171856/http://www.perillanyc.com/">Perilla</a>, opt for the <strong>91 North</strong> ($14, pictured above), which gives you apple two ways: first with a healthy dose of calvados, which is stirred over ice with chai-infused sweet vermouth, a few dashes of old fashioned bitters, then strained into a glass and finished with apple cider. If you&apos;re really serious about apples, the <strong>Adam and Veev</strong> ($18) at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151031171856/http://jezebelnyc.com/">Jezebel</a> is your best bet. Fresh apples are muddled with Veev A&#xE7;a&#xED; spirit (a slightly bitter a&#xE7;a&#xED; berry-distilled liquor), apple jack and lemon juice.</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left"> <img alt="092612huckleberry.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20151031171856im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_nellcasey/092612huckleberry.jpg" width="175" height="184"> <br> <i style=" width:175px; ;display:block"> <span class="photo_caption">&quot;Mother Teresa&quot; at Huckleberry Bar</span></i></div> Its big brother may get all the credit, but the crabapple deserves some praise too and the folks at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151031171856/http://www.cravefishbar.com/">Crave Fishbar</a> are here to sing it. The <strong>Crabhattan</strong> ($13) riffs on a classic Manhattan with Rittenhouse Rye, Carpano Antica sweet vermouth, herbaceous Amarno Nonino and Angostura Bitters, sweetened with local apple cider and garnished with a dehydrated crab apple.<p></p>

<p>Geoff Grassau at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151031171856/http://www.huckleberrybar.com/">Huckleberry Bar</a> created the <strong>Mother Teresa</strong> ($10)&#x2014;named for his mom, <em>aww!</em>&#x2014;which pairs Denizen white rum and dry Fino Sherry with Velvet Falernum (an alcoholic sugar cane-based liqueur with notes of lime and almond) and orange bitters. </p>

<p>The quince, another under-utilized fruit, makes an appearance in the <strong>LI Fizz</strong> at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151031171856/http://www.macaonyc.com/">Macao Trading Co.</a>: Quince Jam syrip and pear puree are livened up with a squeeze of fresh lemon juice then shaken over ice and topped with Appleton rum and spicy ginger beer. Bonus: all the fruit is locally-sourced. </p>

<p>Darker liquors may be more common in the colder months, but this year gin makes a play for spirit of the season. Over at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151031171856/http://www.ltburger.com/bryant-park/">LT Burger</a>, Beefeater Gin&apos;s herby notes get amplified with Aperol and Carpano Antica with the <strong>Dangerous Liaison</strong> ($11, pictured left). At <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151031171856/http://backfortynyc.com/locations/back-forty-west-soho/">Back Forty West</a>, we have the <strong>Little Jack Horner</strong> ($13, pictured right), where Averell Damson Plum Gin gets a more mellow, fruity treatment with Solerno Blood Orange Liqueur, fresh lime juice and honey simple syrup, garnished with a festive sprig of thyme.</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right"> <img alt="092612smokesignal.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20151031171856im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_nellcasey/092612smokesignal.jpg" width="300" height="300"> <br> <i style=" width:300px; ;display:block"> <span class="photo_caption">&quot;Smoke Signal&quot; at Ember Room</span></i></div> While the <strong>Smoke Signal</strong> ($14) at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151031171856/http://www.emberroom.com/">Ember Room</a> has a similar flavor profile to the LJH (gin, muddled orange, lemon/lime juice and honey), mixologist Joseph Boroski elevated this cocktail to another level with the addition of muddled blueberries and <em>actual smoke</em>. To create this unique element, Maplewood chips are ignited in a hand-hand smoker and the resulting smoke is captured inside the glass.<p></p>

<p>Because a cold-weather cocktails list wouldn&apos;t be complete without something served hot, enter the <strong>Ruby Sipper</strong> at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151031171856/http://marblelane.com/#/marble/">Marble Lane</a>. Bourbon and Ruby Port get a hot and spicy kick with cinnamon tea; just <em>try</em> to feel the cold after two or three of those!</p>

<p>The massive bar at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151031171856/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/30/inside_raymi_the_beautiful_new_mode.php#photo-1">Raymi</a>, the excellent Peruvian restaurant from Richard Sandoval (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151031171856/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/26/30_house-infused_tequilas_to_choose.php">Maya</a>), puts Pisco front and center, with over 30 exotic house-infused Piscos including Lemongrass, Purple Corn, Jasmine Tea, Tangerine, and Apricot. It&apos;s true that the colorless or (yellowish-to-amber colored) grape brandy may not be the first thing you think of for a fall cocktail, but the restaurant&apos;s namesake drink, <strong>The Raymi, </strong>is a sweet and rich companion to an early autumn evening. The cocktail, created by Piero Rodriguez, is made with the new premium Pisco spirit <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151031171856/http://piscoporton.com/home">Port&#xF3;n</a>, Aji Amarillo, Mango Passion Fruit, Lime, and Pisco Sour Foam. Here she is:</p>
