<p>Earlier this year, NY Times food critic Pete Wells dropped the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161113153413/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/12/per_nay_jose.php">bong water review</a> heard round the world of chef Thomas Keller&apos;s stately Columbus Circle restaurant Per Se. Wells slammed the restaurant&apos;s &quot;mangled&quot; food and &quot;sleepwalking&quot; service, ultimately calling the restaurant &quot;among the worst food deals in New York,&quot; stripping it down two stars and comparing a mushroom broth to &quot;bong water.&quot; At the time, Keller penned <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161113153413/http://www.thomaskeller.com/messagetoourguests">an apology</a> to his guests, but hasn&apos;t spoken out publicly until an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161113153413/http://www.townandcountrymag.com/leisure/arts-and-culture/a7685/thomas-keller-per-se-new-york-times-review/">interview with Town &amp; Country</a> in which he admits the review was &quot;devastating.&quot;</p>

<p>Unlike David Chang&#x2014;who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161113153413/http://gothamist.com/2016/09/05/pete_wells_says_his_review_of_guys.php">hasn&apos;t held back his ire</a> following Wells&apos; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161113153413/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/18/dining/momofuku-nishi-review.html?_r=0">tepid review</a> of his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161113153413/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/08/david_chang_momofuku_nishi.php">latest Momofuku entry</a>&#x2014;Keller has adopted (on paper, anyway) a more amicable viewpoint on the situation. </p>

<blockquote>Six months after Wells&apos;s review, Keller tells me he has a strong sense that the critic wasn&apos;t out for blood. &quot;Maybe we were complacent,&quot; he says. &quot;I learned that, maybe, as a team we were a little bit too arrogant, our egos too exposed.&quot; Despite his winking cuisine and insistence on pleasing every guest, Keller has sometimes&#x2014;as have other chefs of his caliber&#x2014;been accused of pedantry. Wells, for one, claimed that &quot;servers sometimes give you the feeling that you work for them, and your job is to feel lucky to receive whatever you get.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>Immediately following the review, Keller visited each of his restaurants, reassuring his staff of 1,029 that the world wasn&apos;t ending. &quot;We make mistakes all the time,&quot; he told the magazine. &quot;And a mistake is a missed opportunity. We don&apos;t have to totally rethink what we are doing, because we believe in what we do.&quot; As Per Se chef de cuisine Eli Kaimeh put it: &quot;You may not realize it when it happens, but a kick in the teeth may be the best thing in the world for you.&quot;</p>

<p>Coincidentally, the New Yorker <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161113153413/http://gothamist.com/2016/09/05/pete_wells_says_his_review_of_guys.php">published a lengthy profile</a> of Wells this week, in which we learn how the food critic sausage gets made, one borrowed Gandalf robe and Senor Frogs conga line at at time. </p>
