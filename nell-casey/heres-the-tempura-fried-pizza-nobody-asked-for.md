title: Here's The Tempura Fried Pizza Nobody Asked For
---

	
										<p>The national cholesterol act of 2016 dictates that if something can be fried, it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110093329/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/28/where_to_find_the_citys_best_and_we.php#photo-1"><em>will</em> be fried</a>. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110093329/http://gothamist.com/2014/09/15/minnesota_state_fair_photos.php#photo-14">Candy bars</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110093329/http://gothamist.com/2014/07/17/brooklyn_fried.php">bologna</a> and even <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110093329/http://gothamist.com/2011/07/11/vegan_fried_kool-aid_comes_to_the_e.php">sugary sodas</a> have taken an oil bath, so why not pizza? You heard me: deep fried pizza.</p>

This curse on our arteries comes to us via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110093329/http://www.hagi46.com/">Sake Bar Hagi 46</a>, a casual Japanese eatery slinging cheap beer and stomach-filling dishes including lots of deep fried delights. One of those is Pizza Tempura, a slice of pizza battered and tossed in some hot oil. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110093329/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/26/cold_cheese_slice_little_vincents.php">Cold Cheese Slice</a> is starting to seem much less deadly! Let&apos;s take another look:

<br><br>
Still horrifying! But kinda looks better than <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110093329/http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-atlantic-chipshop-brooklyn?select=uRTJHbf0dFt97FG1ukwFxA&amp;reviewid=WjQpP0uzP4J4VBZkDf0dJQ">what the Chip Shop was doing</a>?

Really. I swear,&quot; he insists. &quot;Everyone at the table made fun of me for ordering it, but when they got a taste, they devoured it. And ordered another one!&quot; Et tu, Cebulski?

We reached out to Sake Bar Hagi 46 for more intel but they&apos;ve yet to return our requests for more information. Staff at the restaurant were coy with Cebulski, too, who couldn&apos;t get anyone to tell him from where the pizza was sourced. There are several slice joints within a block of the restaurant; any one of them could be the traitor.
<br><br>
Questions of decency and respect to New York&apos;s great culinary traditions aside, there&apos;s also the matter of price. The Pizza Tempura <strong>costs $6</strong>. For a slice of pizza...fried in oil. You&apos;ve gotta <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110093329/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/28/the_pizza_principle_is_alive_and_we.php">respect the pizza principle</a>, folks.
<br><br>
Now please excuse us, our <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110093329/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/03/deep_fried_bagel_cream_cheese.php">deep fried bagel</a> is getting cold.
