<p>Like a high schooler hiding that C+ in algebra from mom and dad, many of the city&apos;s restaurants are concealing their Health Department grade from would-be diners. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150923182334/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/1-000-plus-eateries-fined-hiding-grades-article-1.1380550?localLinksEnabled=false">Daily News reveals</a> that 1,356 restaurants were fined over the past year by the Health Department for camouflaging or not displaying their inspection grades. Of the deceptive dining spots, 745 had received &quot;C&quot; grades and 581 received &quot;B&quot; grades, leaving 30 over-achievers hiding their &quot;A&quot; grades... presumably because they thought they deserved an A+?</p>

<p>Knowing that some diners might pass by an establishment with a poor grade, some restaurants take the risk of fine over the potential loss of a customer. &#x201C;I&#x2019;d rather take the fine than place (the C) up there.&#x201D; explained Thomas Mak, manager of Williamburg&apos;s Juniper. &quot;It would have ruined my business.&quot; Other restaurants cited more dog-ate-my-homework excuses, like letter grades getting lost in the mail or patrons pilfering the grades from out of the windows. </p>

<p>Still others refused to display their grades as a kind of protest against the grading system in general. &#x201C;There are many business owners who don&#x2019;t like the stigma associated with letter grades, period,&quot; head of New York City Hospitality Alliance Andrew Regie told the News. </p>

<p>Restaurants have been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150923182334/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/13/c-graded_restaurants_think_c_stands.php">hiding their bad grades</a> pretty much from the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150923182334/http://gothamist.com/2010/06/15/health_department_finalizes_restaur.php">beginning of the program</a>, despite potential fines of $1,000. Eating in a clean establishment is nice, but isn&apos;t it sometimes better just <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150923182334/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/01/east_village_smac_shuttered_by_heal.php">not to know</a>? </p>
