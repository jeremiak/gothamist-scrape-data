<p>Mayor Bloomberg still has a few more weeks of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140219101945/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/06/bloomberg_meets_with_de_blasio_at_c.php">awkward arm crossing</a> before handing over the reigns to our <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140219101945/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/04/ny_post_goes_full_archie_bunker_on.php">new communist crime-lover</a>. In advance of Hizzoner&apos;s final days at City Hall, the <em>New Yorker</em> took a nostalgic turn for their latest cover, &quot;The Last Straw,&quot; imaging the mayor gazing wistfully upon his former empire as he descends into the subway, Big Gulp in hand.</p>

<p>&quot;I remember eating lunch at the taco kiosk near City Hall, and I had this vision of Bloomberg leaving the building for the last time and getting on the subway,&quot; artist Adrian Tomine <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140219101945/http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/culture/2013/11/cover-story-adrian-tomine-last-straw.html?utm_source=tny&amp;utm_campaign=generalsocial&amp;utm_medium=facebook#slide_ss_0=1">explained to the magazine</a>. &quot;I know that won&apos;t actually happen &apos;til January but it just seemed like such a turning point, a poignant moment for a guy who basically changed the rules so that he could stay in office longer.&quot;</p>

<p>The autumnal scene also depicts the mayor sipping a giant soda, a nod to his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140219101945/http://gothamist.com/tags/sodaban">greatest nannying failure</a>&#x2014;though de Blasio has said he&apos;ll <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140219101945/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/19/bill_de_blasio_says_he_will_totally.php">continue where Bloomberg left off on that issue</a>. The illustration evokes a softer side of Bloomberg, one we don&apos;t often see between the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140219101945/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/19/crotchety_mayor_bloomberg_reaches_p.php">grouchy retorts</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140219101945/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/10/bloomberg_pledges_smooth_transition.php">dogmatic devotion to stop and frisk</a>. Will Bloomberg emerge from his post-mayoral stint as the gentler, more thoughtful old man depicted here? Let&apos;s not <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140219101945/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/22/bloomberg_threatens_to_kill_taxi.php">get carried away</a>.</p>
