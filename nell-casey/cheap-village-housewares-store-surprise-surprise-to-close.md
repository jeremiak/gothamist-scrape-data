<p>Inexpensive housewares emporium <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140410040051/http://www.surprisesurprise.com/">Surprise! Surprise!</a>, a staple for NYU kids looking to bulk up their dorms on the cheap, will close at the end of April. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140410040051/http://evgrieve.com/2014/02/surprise-surprise-will-close-at-end-of.html">EV Grieve</a> reports that a store employee confirmed the 25-year-old store will leave due to rising rents, surprising no one. At least it wasn&apos;t a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140410040051/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/08/judge_blocks_nyu_expansion_plan.php">hostile takeover</a>?</p>

<p>The store was known for its reasonably-priced shower curtains, furniture and household knick knacks. This author purchased her very first wine glasses at the store when she was a resident of a nearby NYU residence hall. Sniff. Goods at the shop will be reduced by 20% through the end of April, so now&apos;s the time to stock up on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140410040051/http://surprisesurprise.com/index.php/default/american-flag-magnet-1.html">Michael Jackson magnets</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140410040051/http://surprisesurprise.com/index.php/default/home-ware/magazine-racks/honey-color-hamper.html">wicker laundry hampers</a>. </p>

<p>The once folksy (by 2010&apos;s standards) stretch of Third Avenue has slowly devolved into a mass market wasteland dotted with Capital One banks and chain restaurants. Other college student staples like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140410040051/http://evgrieve.com/2012/12/fern-cliff-delicatessen-is-closing-on.html">Fern Cliff deli</a> (buttered bagels forever) and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140410040051/http://evgrieve.com/2010/05/cosmic-cantina-is-closing.html">Cosmic Cantina</a> (cheap sangria forever) have closed in recent years, with restaurants like 5 Napkin Burger and other bank outlets opening up. Lucky for the world, Bar None still appears to be going strong.<br>
