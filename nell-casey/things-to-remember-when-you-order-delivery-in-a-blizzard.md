<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160723075602/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/21/mitch_snow_weather_king.php">great and powerful Mitch</a> has spoken, and on Saturday New York City will be blanketed in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160723075602/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/21/de_blasio_de_blizzard_2016.php">8-12&quot;</a> or perhaps <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160723075602/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/21/watch_this_blizzard_closely.php">24&quot;</a> or even <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160723075602/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/19/blizzard_2016_thundersnow.php">36 inches</a> of fluffy, white snow. Or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160723075602/http://gothamist.com/2015/01/28/video_jon_stewart_reviews_the_media.php">not</a>!</p>

<p>Regardless the outcome, if plans for hunkering down on Saturday include relying on the services of your local restaurants, it&apos;s important to keep in mind the brave souls without the luxury of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160723075602/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/19/making_a_murderer_ken_kratz.php">binge-watching <em>Making A Murderer</em></a>. Namely, the delivery persons who brave Mother Nature&apos;s wrath as she flings sleet, snow, gale force winds, and refuse at them. It should go without saying that if you&apos;re ordering delivery during this blizzard, it&apos;s only fair that you pay a laziness tax by generously tipping the workers who delivered it.</p>

<p>Here&apos;s how to avoid being a Blizzard Blockhead during tomorrow&apos;s storm:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Throw money at delivery folks.</strong> Not literally, of course, but you&apos;re paying for the <em>incredible convenience</em> of not having to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160723075602/http://gothamist.com/2010/12/28/williamsburg_becomes_ice_planet_hot.php">venture into Hoth</a>. Calculate the amount for a proper 20% tip&#x2014;then add on multiple extra dollars.</li>
<li><strong>Tip in cash.</strong> Damn <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160723075602/https://www.irs.gov/">The Man</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160723075602/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pAII6UO810">save the empire</a>!</li>
<li><strong>Have a little&#x2014;nay, a lot of&#x2014;patience.</strong> It&apos;s not just that the entire city will be Thinking Delivery, they don&apos;t make make chains for bicycles, meaning some serious leg work involved to clear a path. It&apos;s gonna take a lot longer than usual. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160723075602/http://giphy.com/gifs/guy-deal-with-it-uY0lFjVSvHPeU">Deal with it</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Consider meeting them downstairs.</strong> Live on a fifth floor walkup? You&apos;ve been doing nothing all day but laugh at <em><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160723075602/http://gothamist.com/2014/12/22/bojack_horseman_what.php">BoJack Horseman</a> </em>and sip margaritas in your TITAN TI-7800 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160723075602/http://www.titanchair.com/products/massage-chairs/titan/titan-ti-7800/316,1?gclid=CjwKEAiAw4e1BRDfi7vghaWU9jESJACzo9jucv7Oxp2aB--S7Wh_bOaa-ZnEvzQUvJ3qDvYZSaCEdBoCFDrw_wcB">massage chair</a>. (Buying those little umbrella picks for the margaritas was <em>masterful.</em>) Do these guys, and yourself, a favor by going downstairs to meet them. Let&apos;s face it, you could use the exercise anyway.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you&apos;re willing to venture out, may we suggest <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160723075602/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/21/best_all_you_can_eat_nyc.php">testing the limits of your stomach</a>? We hear calories help keep you warm.</p>
