<p>In what might be the greatest plug of all time for the forgotten borough, <em>Game of Thrones</em> author Geroge R.R. Martin revealed that Staten Island played a role in his creation of Westeros, one of the central locations in his ridiculously popular books. The author appeared on <em>Conan</em> last Wednesday to discuss his novels and the series&#x2014;especially <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509165914/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/03/game_of_thrones_power_rankings_rain.php">last week&apos;s dramatic episode</a>&#x2014;when the host asked him how he came up with such a rich, fantastical world when he&apos;d grown up in Bayonne, New Jersey. Martin then united fanboys and guidos forever, explaining:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;It was imagination. I come from a Blue Collar family, my father was a longshoreman. We lived in the projects on First Street in Bayonne, which has a deep water channel in front of it&#x2014;the Kill Van Kull&#x2014;connects New York Bay and Newark Bay and Staten Island across the way. We never went anywhere. My world was five blocks long, I hardly ever got beyond those five blocks except in my imagination. 
<br><br>
I would sit in my living room windows looking out at the big ships going up and down the Kill Van Kull with all the flags of the different countries of the world. <strong>And the lights of Staten Island across the way&#x2014;where we never even went&#x2014;wondering what exotic mysteries and wonders lurked on Staten Island</strong>. Would I ever see them?&quot;</blockquote>

<p>The author reveals that he did eventually make it to Status Island, quipping,&quot; I have to say, it was kind of disappointing.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509165914/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/24/50_reasons_why_staten_island_deserv.php">Come on now, George</a>!  </p>

<p>So if Staten Island truly was the model for Martin&apos;s fictional land, does that mean the King&apos;s Road represents Hylan Boulevard?  Is Fresh Kills Park the Riverlands? Was the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509165914/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/28/sit_on_the_iron_throne_at_game_of_t.php#photo-15">Battle of the Blackwater</a> inspired by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509165914/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/03/staten_islands_graveyard_of_ships.php#photo-1">a real life ship graveyard</a>? Is the Jersey Shore crew Dornish? Can we declare <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509165914/http://gothamist.com/tags/statenislandchuck">Staten Island Chuck</a> the Warden of the North?</p>

<p>And to think we <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509165914/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/01/map_imagines_nyc_as_game_of_thrones.php">had it wrong all this time</a>.</p>
