<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406162636/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/18/city_council_ramps_up_restrictions.php">Put down the pitchforks</a>, restaurants; a new study proves you have nothing to fear from the city&apos;s proliferation of food trucks. Global information company NPD Group <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406162636/https://www.npd.com/wps/portal/npd/us/news/press-releases/food-trucks-primarily-replace-a-quick-service-restaurant-visit-says-npd/">conducted a survey</a> addressing awareness of respondents to mobile food options and also determined where people would eat if not at a food truck. Turns out that quick service restaurants like McDonald&apos;s or a local deli have more to fear from the mobile invasion than your corner bistro. </p>

<p>About 50% of respondents claimed they would have ordered from a fast food restaurant if a food truck had not been in the area; another 20% said they would skip a meal altogether if a food truck were not available. The study discovered that consumers were visiting food trucks for the same reasons they were visiting QSR restaurants: &quot;availability of &apos;interesting&apos; foods and convenience.&quot; While that may strike fear in the heart of a franchise owner, NPD also reveals that &quot;many [regular users] make purchases from food trucks only very occasionally.&quot;</p>

<p>New York City likely lands us on the heavy end of the spectrum when it comes to food truck saturation, especially in densely-populated working neighborhoods like Midtown Manhattan and parts of the Financial District. Food trucks aren&apos;t a direct threat to restaurants in those areas, but &quot;QSR operators may wish to take note of the benefits food trucks offer, such as different and fresh food, especially as a means to build their snack business and/or protect lunch traffic,&#x201D; according to NPD restaurant industry analyst Bonnie Riggs. Your move, Pret A Manger!</p>
