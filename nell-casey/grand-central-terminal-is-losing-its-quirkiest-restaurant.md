										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="011116twoboots.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160605060958im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_nellcasey/011116twoboots.jpg" width="640" height="427"> <br> <i> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160605060958/http://www.navidbaraty.com/">Navid Baraty</a> / Gothamist</i></div> <p></p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160605060958/http://gothamist.com/2014/06/16/where_to_eat_grand_central.php#photo-8">delightfully funky</a> Two Boots Pizzeria in Grand Central Terminal will be no more by the month&apos;s end. The colorful pizzeria and bar will be vacating its corner spot in the Dining Concourse to make room for celebrity chef Donatella Arpaia&apos;s Prova Pizzabar, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160605060958/http://ny.eater.com/2016/1/11/10748178/donatella-arpaia-reveals-details-about-prova-pizzabar">reports Eater</a>. The original <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160605060958/http://gothamist.com/2015/02/13/prova_pizza_chelsea.php#photo-4">Chelsea location of Prova</a> closed in November of last year. </p>

<p>Pies will be baked in ovens that have been imported from Italy and the crusts will be made with &quot;long maturation dough,&quot; which all sounds like a far cry from Two Boots wacky cajun and bbq pizzas. Judging by the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160605060958/http://gothamist.com/2015/02/13/prova_pizza_chelsea.php#photo-4">subdued decor</a> of Prova&apos;s original location, the cheery red booths currently holding court at the GCT space aren&apos;t likely long for this world.</p>

<p>The GCT Two Boots served as the chainlet&apos;s flagship location when it opened in 2000 as part of the Terminal&apos;s big restoration. The space, which also featured a slice takeout counter&#x2014;Prova will sell square slices from that space&#x2014;and a bar, featured over 50 painted panels by street artist <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160605060958/http://www.nicolinaart.com/">Nicolina</a>. </p>

<p>The bar always had some red faced dudes throwing a few back before a train to CT and the old school bartenders were delightfully gruff and no nonsense. It was the perfect spot to get an incognito cocktail in a Pepsi cup for transportation to the train&#x2014;or the sidewalk&#x2014;and it&apos;s damn shame that it&apos;s almost gone.</p>
