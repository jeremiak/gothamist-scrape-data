<p>A trip out to Long Island may not have been on everyone&apos;s agenda this weekend, but it might be time, since it&apos;s where you&apos;ll be able to eat a piece of pizza innovation beyond our wildest dreams: the Cold Cheese Slice. Little Vincent&#x2019;s Pizza in Huntington, LI plucks a regular cheese slice from the oven and then tops it with a handful of cold, shredded mozzarella. It&apos;s so simple, it&apos;s so beautiful, it&apos;s so what I want to shove in my mouth hole right now.</p>

<p>The Cold Cheese Slice isn&apos;t a newfangled idea the pizzeria came up with to court Instagram fame. Little Vincent&apos;s has been slinging the slices since the late &apos;80s, inspired by an upstate pizzeria that was doing the same. It&apos;s an inspired creation for several reasons <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031150339/http://www.thedailymeal.com/little-vincents-cold-cheese-slice">outlined by the Daily Meal</a> during a visit in 2010:</p>

<blockquote>First, more is better. Second, oil usually removed by holding your slice tip-down, disappears&#x2014; absorbed by cold cheese. Third, the introduction of cold cheese to the residual heat of a piping hot slice creates taste and texture nuances not usually experienced. There isn&#x2019;t enough heat in even the freshest slice to melt all the extra cheese. But it does introduce three cheese stages to the eating experience: melted, beginning to melt, and cold cheese.</blockquote>

<p>Sold.</p>

<p>It&apos;s a well-known special among the pizza cognoscenti, including Adam Kuban, the pizza expert and maker of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031150339/http://gothamist.com/2014/08/21/bar_pies_adam_kuban.php">excellent bar pies</a> with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031150339/http://margotspizza.com/">Margot&apos;s Pizza</a>. It looks like Kuban&apos;s even doing a pizza inspired by the Cold Cheese Slice at his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031150339/http://margotspizza.com/#schedule">occasional pop-ups</a> at Emily Pizza in Clinton Hill. </p>
