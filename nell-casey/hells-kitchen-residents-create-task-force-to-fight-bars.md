<p>Exhausted by the relentless proliferation of bars and clubs, a group of Hell&apos;s Kitchen residents have united to fight nightlife establishments in their neighborhood. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140210111106/http://hknanyc.org/index.php">Hell&apos;s Kitchen Neighborhood Task Force to Fight Bars</a>, lead by Kathleen Treat, a 25-year resident and public member of Community Board 4&apos;s Quality of Life Committee, wants to further educate the community board about the way residents feel about their neighborhood being turned into a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140210111106/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/19/hells_kitchen_goes_to_hell_in_a_han.php">raucous frat house</a>. &quot;The issue is what&apos;s called over-saturation of liquor-serving establishments, that&apos;s the Albany phrase,&quot; explained Treat. &quot;We just have way too many bars here.&quot;</p>

<p>Despite <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140210111106/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/12/why_do_neighbor-hated_bars_keep_get.php">reports to the contrary</a>, Treat insists that if the Community Board were more proactive in voicing their concerns and not recommending licenses, that the State Liquor Authority would concede to their requests. &quot;There&apos;s a misunderstanding floating around for many years that the SLA blanketly okays everything, no matter what the CB says, and that&apos;s not really true,&quot; says Treat. &quot;The SLA does listen to Community Boards and if the Community Board says, &apos;No, we don&apos;t want a bar,&apos; chances are the SLA will take that seriously.&quot; </p>

<p>Case in point, CB 4 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140210111106/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/06/hells_kitchen_battles_boxers_a_gay.php">aggressively battled against</a> a license for the gay sports bar Boxers and the SLA <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140210111106/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20120229/chelsea-hells-kitchen/boxers-denied-liquor-license-for-hells-kitchen-location">ultimately sided with the community</a>. However, there are 453 &quot;On-Premises&quot; licenses issued in the 10019 zip code and another 454 in the 10036 zip code, the two zip codes that cover the neighborhood. </p>

<p>Some of these establishments include sit down restaurants and corner pizza parlors, but given the high numbers it&apos;s clear the area is awash with booze. By comparison, the 10028 zip code, which covers the bar-dense UES in the 80s and 90s, has just 106 &quot;On-Premises&quot; licenses. We reached out to the State Liquor Authority for their take on the SLA/CB relationship but have yet to hear back.</p>

<p>For Treat, the root of the problem is the neighborhood&apos;s landlords, who she says prefer renting to boozy establishments because they&apos;re able to afford rising rent rates. &quot;There&apos;s a bar around the corner from me, Dalton&apos;s, I think they pay $40,000 per month rent,&quot; a sum Treat says couldn&apos;t possibly be met by a Mom-and-Pop establishment. &quot;[Landlords] never have the community&apos;s interest at heart; none of them live here, they don&apos;t give a damn,&quot; seethed Treat. &quot;They live in Westchester, Florida. They don&apos;t care about the neighborhood.&quot; </p>

<p>The Task Force hopes that by convincing the Community Board not to recommend renewals or new licenses, that landlords will do right by the community&apos;s wishes. &quot;It&apos;s a long shot,&quot; Treat concedes. &quot;But it&apos;s become such an issue that we&apos;re willing to work.&quot;</p>

<p>Long shot puts it mildly. Rents in both Manhattan and Brooklyn have been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140210111106/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/08/skyrocketing_brooklyn_rents_close_i.php">rapidly increasing</a>, especially in trendier and up-and-coming neighborhoods that attract younger tenants with money to burn. In turn, the establishments willing to shell out big bucks tend to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140210111106/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/17/interactive_map_here_are_all_the_st.php">skew towards chains</a> or, as Treat points out, high revenue establishments like bars and clubs. By and large, Manhattan&apos;s landlords aren&apos;t the types to miss out on the dollar signs flashing before their eyes, despite yearning from folks who miss the good/bad &apos;ole days before the city became the homogeneous stew it is now. </p>

<p>For any interested parties, the Task Force has their first meeting today at 4 p.m. Contact information@hknanyc.org for more info.</p>
