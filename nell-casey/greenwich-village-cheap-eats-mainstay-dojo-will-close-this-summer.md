<p>The collective student body at NYU is about to have a major freakout: West Fourth Street cheap eats mecca <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717094030/http://www.dojorestaurant.com/">Dojo</a> is closing. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717094030/http://vanishingnewyork.blogspot.com/2013/05/dojos.html">Jeremiah&apos;s Vanishing New York</a> gets <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717094030/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/10/mozzarella_institution_joes_dairy_c.php">another scoop</a> from Ken at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717094030/http://greenwichvillagenydailyphoto.blogspot.com/">Greenwich Village Daily Photo</a>, who got word that a rent increase&#x2014;uuuuuuuugh&#x2014;would push out the longtime restaurant at some point this summer. </p>

<p>The inexpensive, no-frills restaurant has been a favorite of NYU students&#x2014;and frugal diners&#x2014;since it opened in 1991, especially after the original sister location on St. Marks closed in 2007. The menu is kind of Japanese&#x2026;but kind of not, with lots of options for both vegetarians and omnivores. They serve their burgers in pita pockets, a quirk that confused me at first but that I ultimately came to love. And there&apos;s no denying the carrot-ginger dressing&#x2014;which the restaurant <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717094030/http://www.dojorestaurant.com/history/">claims it made popular</a>&#x2014;makes even plain steamed veggies seem like not just rabbit food.</p>

<p>The location is prime real estate so it&apos;s not especially surprising that an eager landlord would want to capitalize on all the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717094030/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/15/lots_of_nyu_students_are_sugar_babi.php">rich NYU kids</a>. There&apos;s already a Duane Reade on the block and a Starbucks a block in the other direction so that leaves either bank, froyo depot or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717094030/http://gothamist.com/tags/chains">something equally boring</a>. Sigh.</p>
