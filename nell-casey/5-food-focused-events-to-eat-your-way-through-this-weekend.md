<p>For the past four years, a large section of Smith Street in Cobble Hill gets shut down to vehicular traffic for the <strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203062017/http://pardonmeforasking.blogspot.com/2013/10/smith-street-getting-ready-for-4th.html">Festivale Des Soupes</a></strong>, which returns to the nabe this Saturday. Dozens of restaurants along the thoroughfare cook up great crocks of delicious shops in veggie, meat and fish/seafood categories and they&apos;re all for the sampling. The lineup this year boasts some big names like Dassara Ramen, Seersucker, and even offerings from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203062017/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/04/the_best_cheese_shops_in_nyc.php">cheese shop extraordinaire</a> Stinky Bklyn. Judges will be doling out prizes to their favorite soups but the casual soup-lover can indulge in 4 oz. samples for very low prices: $5 buys you five tastings, $10 gets you 12 and series soup addicts (read: families and groups) can get a whopping 25 for just $20. The slurping goes down from 1 p.m. to 4 p.m., with free entry if you just like to watch. </p>

<p>If giant animals roasting over coals sounds more up your alley, check out the <strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203062017/http://gourmeet.com/party/23">Fritanga</a></strong>, an old-fashioned Mexican pig roast put on by the folks at B&apos;klyn Burro. Saturday from 4 p.m. to 8 p.m. they&apos;ll be sweating the swine and then serving up the succulent meat along with tacos, salsa and chili brews. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203062017/http://gourmeet.com/party/23">A $25 ticket</a> gets you <em>all you can eat</em> chicharrones (fried pork rinds), carnitas (roast pork) and buche (pork sweetbreads) plus the aforementioned grub. The roasting goes down at Williamsburg&apos;s Havemeyer Park, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203062017/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/11/williamsburg_vacant_lot_transformed.php#photo-1">interim community space</a> at the Domino Sugar Refinery site. </p>
