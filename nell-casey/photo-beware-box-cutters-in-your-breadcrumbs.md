They&apos;re really getting edgy with these toy prizes these days.<p></p>

<p>Toler-Stoute says the package appeared unmolested when she purchased it back in December and the metal seal was still intact just before she made the startling discovery.

Both companies have also launched investigations into the incident to determine the origin of the stray object. </p>
