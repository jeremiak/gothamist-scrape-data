<p>As we&apos;ve been told time and again, you&apos;re <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509040615/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/24/this_nyc_rat_map_will_show_you_wher.php">never far</a> from the city&apos;s energetic rodent population, and that includes <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509040615/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/02/doh_shutters_mission_chinese_for_se.php">when you&apos;re eating out</a>. The latest edition of our <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509040615/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/02/have_you_become_complacent_to_the_r.php">obsessive rat documentation</a> takes a sobering look inside the city&apos;s many eateries and their respective citations for rodent appearances. </p>

<p>To create this appetizing map, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509040615/https://twitter.com/smelendez">Steven Melendez</a> took the restaurant inspection data from the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509040615/https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/Restaurant-Inspection-Results/4vkw-7nck">Health Department</a> and looked at all the inspections since Jan. 1, 2013. Then he counted the total number of inspected restaurants and number of restaurants that received citations for &quot;evidence of mice or live mice&quot; or &quot;evidence of rats or live rats&quot; in that time period for each zip code. Then, for each zip code, he added to the info window any restaurant that currently has a C grade and was cited for mice and/or rats in its most recent graded inspection.</p>

<p>While some neighborhoods came out critter-free&#x2014;you go, Roosevelt Island!&#x2014;others had some pretty nauseating stats. Take the Queens Village/Bellaire section of the borough: of the neighborhood&apos;s 23 restaurants, 14 were cited for rats or mice, an alarming 60.9 percent. The 10128 zip on the Upper East Side&#x2014;where 2nd Avenue Subway construction has been most involved&#x2014;clocks in with 50% of the area&apos;s 154 restaurants cited for rodents; the 11218 zip southwest of Greenwood Cemetery boasts 52% rodent saturation of the area&apos;s 138 eateries. </p>
