<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161203153815/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/16/michelin_guide_nyc_2017.php">Michelin</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161203153815/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/26/zagat_rankings_2017.php">Zagat</a>, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161203153815/http://gothamist.com/2016/09/08/thomas_keller_per_se_review_respons.php">New York Times</a>: all venerable sources for finding a city&apos;s &quot;best&quot; restaurant. But with the rise of social media and peer review sites, spots like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161203153815/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/29/yelp_top_restaurants_brooklyn.php">Yelp</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161203153815/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/16/best_restaurant_nyc.php">Trip Advisor</a> and even OpenTable now release their own top restaurant lists, with the latter debuting their 2016 list yesterday.</p>

<p>OpenTable&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161203153815/http://www.opentable.com/m/best-restaurants-in-america-for-2016/">100 Best Restaurants in America for 2016</a>, as voted on by verified diners who employ the reservation system, combed over 10,000,000 reviews of restaurants nationwide. Organized by state&#x2014;though not every state gets a ranking, sorry Alaska and Rhode Island, among others&#x2014;the list narrows down the best out of more than 24,000 restaurants where diners made reservations in the past year.</p>

<p>New York State gets a respectable 13 nods (we beat the state with the second most notable restaurants, California, by one restaurant) with eight in New York City proper. </p>

<p>Distinguished if staid spots like Daniel, Gramercy Tavern and The Modern made the cut, as did Per <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161203153815/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/12/per_nay_jose.php">&quot;Bong Water&quot;</a> Se. Sushi Nakazawa, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161203153815/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/15/sushi_nakazawa.php#photo-1">celebrate sushi spot</a> that&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161203153815/http://dcist.com/2016/11/owner_of_sushi_restaurant_coming_to.php">expanding to a Trump property in DC</a>, also made the list, as did the (ironically Boston-born) o ya Japanese restaurant. </p>

<p>Le Coucou, the brand new, upscale French restaurant that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161203153815/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/02/le_coucou_chinatown.php#photo-1">got a recent rave by the Times</a> was hip enough to make the cut, the irony being it&apos;ll be months before anyone can get a reservation there. Trattoria L&apos;incontro, an acclaimed Italian restaurant in Astoria, was the sole restaurant not based in Manhattan to make the list.</p>

<p>This list only looks at restaurants that are part of OpenTable&apos;s vast database of eateries, so if a business employes a competing operation like Resy, they&apos;re not making the list. Likewise if a restaurant <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161203153815/http://gothamist.com/2010/06/09/no_reservations_infuriating_new_tre.php">doesn&apos;t take reservations</a> at all, which may indicate why higher end restaurants are more likely to make a list of this kind as opposed to, say, a spot like Roberta&apos;s or one of many other mid-priced or inexpensive restaurants for which reservations don&apos;t apply or aren&apos;t accepted.</p>
