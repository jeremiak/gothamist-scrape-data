<p>Now wannabe hipsters won&apos;t even have to leave Ohio to get an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140321070002/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaKuT3dIwfc">authentic slice of NYC pizza</a>! Sbarro LLC announced their latest branding innovation: a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140321070002/http://www.bizjournals.com/columbus/blog/2013/10/sbarro-brooklyn-fresh-to-get-test-run.html">new line of fast-casual eateries</a> called Brooklyn Fresh. Slap &quot;Brooklyn&quot; on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140321070002/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/01/brooklyn_dirt.php">literally</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140321070002/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/26/brooklyn_branding_now_on_two_differ.php">anything</a> and <em>they will come</em>&#x2026;to Ohio. </p>

<p>The new concept will offer 10- and 13- inch made-to-order pizzas, pastas and salads and unlike its mall-based counter part, it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140321070002/http://nrn.com/fast-casual/sbarro-joins-fast-casual-pizza-race?page=1">won&apos;t offer slices</a>. Imagine <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140321070002/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/25/photos_inside_motorinos_new_home_in.php">Motorino</a> except not in Brooklyn and not, ya know, actually fresh. The new concept, which joins Sbarro&apos;s other new fast-casual expansion Pizza Cucinova, opens at some point next year in Columbus.</p>

<p>In all fairness to Sbarro&#x2014;who says we&apos;re not equitable?&#x2014;the brand has roots in Brooklyn, as the origins of the now ubiquitous pizza chain began with a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140321070002/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/09/carmela_mama_sbarro_pizza_making_ma.php">delicatessen in the borough</a>. And given their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140321070002/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/20/sbarro_has_found_a_qualified_suitor.php">recent financial troubles</a> it&apos;s not a surprise they&apos;re looking for ways to co-opt the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140321070002/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/16/ny_times_trolls_brooklyn_hipsters_w.php">Hipsturbia hysteria</a>. Go back to O...oh.</p>
