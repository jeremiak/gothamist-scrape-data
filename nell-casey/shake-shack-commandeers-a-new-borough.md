<p>Two iconic NYC fast food brands are now under one roof as Shake Shack joins Nathan&apos;s Famous with its <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160504073047/http://gothamist.com/2015/06/27/shake_shack_to_open_first_standalon.php">newest store</a> inside the Queens Center Mall in Elmhurst. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160504073047/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/01/best_burgers_nyc.php">burger behemoth</a> debuts its &quot;first ever Queens Shack&quot; (their words!) tomorrow, when it joins the satellite Citi Field and JFK operations in the borough. The Staten Island Mall is a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160504073047/http://gothamist.com/2015/11/10/mall_santa_long_island.php">cutting edge spot, too</a>&#x2014;just saying!</p>

<p>The Shack Act of 2001 requires all New Yorkers to know the menu by heart, so nothing new to report there. However, as tradition dictates, the Queens Center Shack will have some brand-new frozen custard concrete combinations: Chocolate Peanut Butter Crunchcrete (chocolate custard, peanut butter sauce, chocolate toffee and chocolate sprinkles), the World&#x2019;s Fare (vanilla custard, matcha, marshmallow sauce and crispy crunchies) and Banana Caramel Crisp (vanilla custard, banana, caramel sauce and crumbled sugar cone cookie). </p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160504073047/http://gothamist.com/2015/07/07/shake_shack_chicken.php">elusive ChickenShack</a>, however, remains elusive.</p>

<p>The new location opens tomorrow at 11 a.m., which gives gift returners a few precious hours before New Year&apos;s Resolutions kick in.</p>
