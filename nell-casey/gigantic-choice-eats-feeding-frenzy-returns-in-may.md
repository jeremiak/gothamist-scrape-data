<p>Each year for the past decade, The Village Voice has thrown a gigantic food festival cram jammed with local restaurants, booze pushers and the people who enjoy consuming the bounty of said purveyors past the point of common sense. Sometimes, it&apos;s an opportunity to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170420110244/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/12/photos_thousands_pig_out_at_choice.php#photo-10&quot;">get a sneak peek</a> of a hotly anticipated restaurant, but mostly it&apos;s a venue for pigging out on sample-sized portions of...probably just about anything you can imagine.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170420110244/http://sites.villagevoice.com/choice-eats">Choice Eats</a> returns on May 19th this year and two rounds of vendors have been announced in anticipation of the event. Round one included Ample Hills, The Handpulled Noodle, Rebelle, Schaller&apos;s Stube and Yemen Cafe, among others. Round two, released this week, includes Javelina Tex-Mex, Nom Wah Nolita, Obica Mozzarella Bar, Fletcher&apos;s Brooklyn Barbecue and Thai Rock. There will be around 50 participating restaurants at go-time. </p>

<p>Alcohol&apos;s usually supplied by sponsors, which this year include Asahi Beer and Rums of Puerto Rico, but count on more being announced closer to the date, along with more eats. </p>

<p>Tips for navigating the inevitable insanity of these events: get on line early, save the booze for last and seek out non-&quot;name&quot; restaurants for the best bites. That&apos;ll put you in good shape to make the most of your <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170420110244/https://www.eventbrite.com/e/the-village-voice-10th-annual-choice-eats-tasting-event-tickets-32122268570#tickets">$85 admission fee</a> (an extra hour of VIP goes for $135), which includes <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170420110244/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkFUHMjZDgs">everything the light touches</a>: savory bites, desserts and all the booze you can use.</p>
