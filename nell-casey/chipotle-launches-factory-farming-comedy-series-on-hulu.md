										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="012814chipotle.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508150716im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_nellcasey/012814chipotle.jpg" width="640" height="480" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>Chipotle has been a loud voice in the anti-factory farming movement, especially with its commitment to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508150716/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/14/there_arent_enough_naturally_raised.php">only use naturally raised beef</a>. Now the brand is taking its marketing techniques into new territory, launching a comedy series on Hulu that satirizes industrial agriculture and the lengths companies go to while trying to protect their image. The series, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508150716/http://farmedanddangerous.com/">&quot;Farmed and Dangerous,&quot;</a> stars actor Ray Wise&#x2014;aka Leland Palmer from <em>Twin Peaks</em>&#x2014;as an oily publicist for an industrial food production company suffering a PR crisis after a video of a cow exploding at their plant goes viral.</p>

<p>Though the company has produced the series and branded it a &quot;Chipotle original series,&quot; there&apos;s only one mention of the chain in the show itself, in relation to its former partnership with McDonalds. </p>

<p><strong>&#x201C;We think of &#x2018;Farmed and Dangerous&#x2019; as a values-integration rather than typical product-integration,&#x201D;</strong> explains Mark Crumpacker, chief marketing and development officer at Chipotle. &#x201C;The show addresses issues that we think are important&#x2014;albeit in a satirical way&#x2014;without being explicitly about Chipotle. This approach allows us to produce content that communicates our values and entertains people at the same time.&#x201C; </p>

<p>Daniel Rosenberg, whose company Piro helped produce the series, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508150716/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/27/business/media/chipotle-blurs-lines-with-a-satirical-series-about-industrial-farming.html?smid=tw-nytmedia&amp;seid=auto&amp;_r=1">told the <em>Times</em></a> the series was &quot;meant to strike large emotional chords&#x2014;it&apos;s not about selling burritos.&quot; Nonetheless, the show promotes the company&apos;s agenda. Hearts will be softened, and more burritos will be folded. </p>

<p>This isn&apos;t the company&apos;s first foray into new marketing techniques. Last year it released an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508150716/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUtnas5ScSE">excellent animated video</a> on the same topic that went viral, as well as a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508150716/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMfSGt6rHos">Willie Nelson-soundtracked video</a> in 2011. &quot;Farmed and Dangerous&quot; debuts February 17th on Hulu and Hulu Plus; there are four episodes in the first season with plans to make subsequent seasons if the show&apos;s delightful brand of &quot;values-integration&quot; really keeps you coming back for more. </p>
