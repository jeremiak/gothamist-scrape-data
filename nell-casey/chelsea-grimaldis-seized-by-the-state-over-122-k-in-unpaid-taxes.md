<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021125111/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/01/grimaldis_pizza_to_open_24_hour_joi.php">Chelsea offshoot</a> of legendary (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021125111/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/25/pizza_shocker_grimaldis_is_being_re.php">if in name only</a>) pizzeria <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021125111/http://www.grimaldis-pizza.com/">Grimaldi&apos;s</a> has been seized and shuttered by the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance. Notices appeared on the restaurant&apos;s 656 Avenue of the Americas storefront yesterday and the restaurant was closed for service last night and remained shuttered as of this morning. </p>

<p>James Gazzale, a spokesperson for the Department, confirmed that the restaurant currently has 10 open warrants for sales, with a warranted balance of $121,909.13 in unpaid sales tax plus penalties. &quot;The typical sales tax that you would pay at this restaurant, they collect that on our behalf, so the money doesn&apos;t necessarily belong to them,&quot; Gazzale explained. The restaurant then has to turn that money over to the state, which, in this case, didn&apos;t happen. </p>

<p>Phone calls to the restaurant went unanswered this morning, but a manager at the DUMBO location confirmed the closure and said the restaurant was working with the Department to correct the issue. &quot;The place was supposed to be busier than it is, it&apos;s not a busy store,&quot; DUMBO manager Gina Peluso said. &quot;They think Grimaldi&apos;s is doing a killer business, so they&apos;re trying to work out the issue with the taxes.&quot;</p>

<p>The tax man has had beef with Grimaldi&apos;s before, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021125111/http://ny.eater.com/2008/7/23/6790289/crimewatch-the-famous-grimaldis-seized">seizing the original location</a> in 2008 for unpaid state sales and withholding taxes. The issue was quickly resolved and the pizzeria reopened, so it&apos;s possible the Chelsea outlet will be back to slinging pies soon. Recently, buzzy Roberta&apos;s in Bushwick also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021125111/http://gothamist.com/2015/08/19/robertas_bushwick_taxes.php">ran into some trouble</a> over taxes, but now that there&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021125111/http://gothamist.com/2016/05/28/robertas_caching.php">a Tisch involved</a>, $480K here and there is a drop in the marinara sauce.</p>

<p>&quot;We in the neighborhood love Grimaldi&apos;s,&quot; tipster Mike Volchok told Gothamist following the shutter. &quot;Hope to see them back soon.&quot; </p>
