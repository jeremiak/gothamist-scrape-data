<p>Popular chainlet <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171104044154/http://handynasty.net/">Han Dynasty</a> will be expanding its NYC footprint with the forthcoming opening of a third restaurant, this time in Brooklyn. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171104044154/http://gothamist.com/2015/01/22/best_chinese_noodles_nyc.php">superb Sichuan spot</a>, which also has restaurants in Pennsylvania and New Jersey, will be opening a satellite shop inside <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171104044154/http://gothamist.com/tags/citypoint">City Point</a> in Downtown Brooklyn...whenever that megaproject <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171104044154/http://gothamist.com/2016/08/26/city_point_trader_joes_delayed_unti.php">actually ends up opening</a>. </p>

<p>The huge retail center, which&apos;ll have a Target, Katz&apos;s Delicatessen and Alamo Drafthouse among other companies, will have a 60,000-square-foot &quot;concourse-level dining experience&quot; where Han Dynasty will be located. Customers can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171104044154/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/23/cold_noodle_roundup_nyc.php">order their noodles</a> at an &quot;express kiosk&quot; located outside the restaurant, allowing for diners to eat wherever they&apos;d like. Or they can sit inside the 100-person dining room with a triangle-shaped bar. There&apos;ll also be a food hall adjacent to the restaurant offerings.</p>

<p>City Point&apos;s opening has been somewhat delayed, but we&apos;re told that the Century 21, Target and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171104044154/http://gothamist.com/2016/08/25/brooklyn_alamo_drafthouse.php">Alamo Drafthouse</a> will be opening in the next few weeks. The rest of the City Point operation is expected to open in early 2017.</p>
