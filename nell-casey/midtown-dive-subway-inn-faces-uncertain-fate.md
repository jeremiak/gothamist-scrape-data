<p>This morning EV Grieve nearly gave us a heart attack by rumormongering about the possible closure of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150307165631/http://evgrieve.com/2014/02/should-we-start-worrying-about-subway.html">gritty Midtown East oasis Subway Inn</a>. The blog points to World-Wide Group&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150307165631/http://therealdeal.com/blog/2014/02/11/world-wide-group-snags-bloomingdales-building-for-37m/">recent acquisition</a> of 155 East 60th Street, completing their ownership of a 200-foot stretch of storefront space on the block that includes the bar and its iconic neon sign. According to The Real Deal, the firm is &quot;active in the city,&quot; with two current construction projects active. OH GOD WHAT DOES IT MEAN?!?</p>

<p>We rang up the bar&#x2014;which opens at an alcoholic-friendly 10 a.m.&#x2014;to see whether the wrecking balls were already positioned outside. Steven S., who happens to be the son of the bar&apos;s owner, seemed unperturbed by the news. &quot;We&apos;re not worried about it anytime soon,&quot; he says. &quot;As far as we know, everything is good.&quot; Well that&apos;s encouraging! &quot;We&apos;re probably going to end up moving somewhere else pretty close in the area,&quot; he went on to say. Okay, less encouraging. &quot;But right now it&apos;s not a concern, so we&apos;re not looking right now.&quot; Hm. Let&apos;s order some shots while we process all this.</p>

<p>At least it looks like the bar won&apos;t <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150307165631/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/08/theres_only_one_grays_papaya_left_i.php">disappear without warning</a> and even if it does eventually close, we&apos;re glad there&apos;s a least the idea of a contingency plan. Subway Inn has operated out of its pee-stained digs at 143 East 60th since 1937, just across the way from tourist and shopaholic mecca Bloomingdales. It&apos;s a bastion of the city&apos;s working class history, these days frequented by union workers, off-duty suits and folks looking for an unpretentious break from the glitzy shopping area. </p>

<p>Please God, just let us keep <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150307165631/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/11/soho_dive_miladys_is_closing_on_sun.php">one good thing</a>.</p>
