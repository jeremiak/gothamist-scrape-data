<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151101133218/http://www.mofad.org/">Museum of Food and Drink</a> might not be quite ready to open, but it&apos;s already off to an incendiary start. Last week, members of the still-in-development museum dedicated to all things edible, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151101133218/http://www.popsci.com/technology/article/2013-06/exclusive-video-exploding-rice-puffs">tested out their grain-puffing cannon</a> in a warehouse in Brooklyn. The turn of the 20th century cannon, which made puffed cereals like Kix, will be the focal piece of the museum&apos;s Breakfast Cereal exhibit when the doors finally open.</p>

<p>Popular Science was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151101133218/http://www.popsci.com/technology/article/2013-06/exclusive-video-exploding-rice-puffs">on hand</a> for the inaugural cereal explosion, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151101133218/http://www.popsci.com/technology/gallery/2013-06/gallery-puffing-cannon">captured photos</a> and videos of the big moment. The process involves uncooked grains of rice, water, tons of steam pressure, and a very satisfying whack with a metal cudgel.</p>
