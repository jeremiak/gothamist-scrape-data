<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016134829/http://www.alidoronyc.com/">Alidoro</a>, makers of the city&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016134829/http://gothamist.com/2014/12/04/best_sandwiches_nyc.php">most delectable sandwiches</a>, have outdone themselves with their latest special: an Italian Cheesesteak. The shop <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016134829/https://www.instagram.com/p/BFEdLe5AMmL/?taken-by=alidoronyc">introduced the new sandwich</a> as a balm for the crummy weather we&apos;ve been experiencing, knowing that chanting the words &quot;truffle cream&quot; has been known to summon the sun. If never-ending rain brings inspiration like this, we&apos;re buying stock in Hunter boots ASAP.</p>

<p>The sandwich was born at the sandwich shop&apos;s Midtown location, which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016134829/http://gothamist.com/2014/10/30/alidoros_spectacular_sandwiches_arr.php#photo-1">opened on East 39th Street</a> in 2014 and began serving hot sandwiches at the start of this year. It features rosemary-braised, thinly sliced sirloin steak; a layer of imported provolone cheese; a truffle cream sauce; and garlic-sauteed mushrooms. It is ridiculous, it is delicious and it will cost you $14. </p>
