<p>With a soggy Friday dampening spirits, at least we have a fake food holiday to distract us from our weather misery. To celebrate National Doughnut Day, many of our fine doughnut purveyors&#x2014;and chain restaurants&#x2014;are offering gratis grub in the form of fried dough if you stop by their bakeries. While you likely won&apos;t get a free <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110095132/http://gothamist.com/2016/05/26/cinnamon_snail_inception_donut.php">Inception Donut</a> out of the deal, you can still stuff your face with sugar-soaked confectionaries at these generous bake shops:</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110095132/http://dunwelldoughnuts.com/">Dun-Well Doughnuts</a></strong> This vegan doughnuttery is offering one small cake doughnut to anyone who buys an espresso beverage at their Bushwick digs. It&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110095132/http://gothamist.com/2014/05/02/star_wars_doughnuts.php#photo-1">no Yoda head</a> but at least it&apos;s free. <em>222 Montrose Avenue</em> </p>

<p><strong>Dunkin Donuts</strong> The city&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110095132/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/23/nyc_chain_stores.php">most prolific chain</a> is honoring today&apos;s special holiday with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110095132/https://twitter.com/DunkinDonuts/status/738694220244979712">one free doughnut</a> with the purchase of any beverage. Frozen Dunkaccino with whipped cream and a Boston Creme on the side? We&apos;re not here to judge. <em>Multiple Locations</em></p>

<p><strong>Doughnut Project</strong> Pushers of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110095132/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/13/doughnut_project_meat_week.php">meat doughnuts</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110095132/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/23/doughnut_project_everything_doughnu.php">Everything Doughnuts</a>, this West Village shop is combining this doughy holiday with happy hour, debuting an Angry Fritter made with Angry Orchard hard apple cider. It&apos;s not free, but the $3.75 special is pretty darn good, if the buzz around the office can be trusted. <em>10 Morton Street</em></p>

<p><strong>Doughnut Plant</strong> Buy one doughnut at any of their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110095132/http://doughnutplant.com/contact/">locations</a> and you&apos;ll be handed a Carnival Sprinkles Mimi Cake Doughnut absolutely free.

It&apos;s like getting lunch and dessert all at once. <em>Multiple Locations</em></p>
