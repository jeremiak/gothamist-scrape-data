<p>Dominique Ansel Bakery&apos;s game-changing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428161216/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/18/you_can_now_pre-order_your_cronut_o.php">online ordering system</a> appears to be withering under the pressure of thousands of Cronut fanatics flooding the system. It&apos;s just the second week of the new system and it&apos;s still in BETA, but this morning the bakery assured us there were &quot;very few glitches&quot; last week and they expected smooth sailing. It seems they have underestimated the power of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428161216/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/25/new_cronut.php">champagne and chocolate</a>. </p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="112513cronut3.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428161216im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_nellcasey/112513cronut3.jpg" width="640" height="210"> <br> <i> <span class="photo_caption">LIES</span></i></div> <p></p>

<p>It appears that pastry-seekers were given false hope by the bakery&apos;s website, which dangled imaginary Cronuts that, in fact, had already been sold. People, naturally, are <em>pissed</em>:</p>

<p>Angry folks have begun a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428161216/https://www.facebook.com/pages/Dominique-Ansel-Bakery/293357170694083">comment thread on Facebook</a> to express their outrage, as well. &quot;Now this is what I call the hunger games,&quot; joked <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428161216/https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=717864544910008&amp;set=a.329787750384358.88240.293357170694083&amp;type=1&amp;comment_id=2379672&amp;offset=0&amp;total_comments=24">one user</a>; &quot;I think there is more chance of getting front row seats to a royal wedding then getting crounuts on pre order,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428161216/https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=717864544910008&amp;set=a.329787750384358.88240.293357170694083&amp;type=1&amp;comment_id=2379529&amp;offset=0&amp;total_comments=25">quipped another</a>. </p>

<p>A rep for the bakery blames the system crashes and false Cronut hopes their current server, which they plan to replace in advance of next week&apos;s preorder rush, as well as Paypal. The rep assures us it &quot;will get better! We promise! All technology needs time to test.&quot;</p>

<p>Test our patience, that is!</p>
