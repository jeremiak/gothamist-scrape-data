<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108041854/http://grandstreetbk.org/?p=6774">Grand Street Restaurant Week</a>, which highlights the diverse Brooklyn dining corridor east of the BQE, returns for a special summer edition next week. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108041854/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/18/williamsburg_grand_street_restauran.php">now biannual</a> event put on by the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108041854/http://grandstbklyn.com/wordpress/?p=6554">Grand Street BID</a> includes special prix fixe deals for dinner (and sometimes lunch, too) at 11 different restaurants, from Mexican to Japanese, Indian and Russian.</p>

<p>Like its <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108041854/http://gothamist.com/2016/07/12/restaurant_week_2016.php">much larger compatriot</a>, GSRW offers discounted meals, with prices and participation levels varying between restaurants. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108041854/http://www.ryujinramenbrooklyn.com/">Ryujin Ramen</a>, for example (a newcomer this year), is just doing a $20 dinner that includes a choice of appetizer (pork or shrimp buns, for example), plus a choice of ramen, and an ice cream for dessert. Indian Kitchen, on the other hand, is doing lunch or dinner for one person ($10), two people ($18) or three people ($28), with vegetable appetizers, an entree, naan and dessert for all.</p>

<p>Grand Street Restaurant Week runs August 8th - August 14th. All the participating restaurants and their prices/meals are listed below; you can peruse all of their special menus on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108041854/http://grandstreetbk.org/?p=6774">Grand Street BID&apos;s website</a>.</p>
