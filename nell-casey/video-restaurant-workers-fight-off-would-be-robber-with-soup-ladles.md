<p>Cooking gear can be intimidating if you don&apos;t know your microplane from your mortar&#x2014;or if it&apos;s being brandished as a defensive weapon, as was the case earlier this month at a Chinese restaurant in Canarsie.</p>

<p>A would-be robber threatened employees with a knife and attempted to jump over the counter at Chen&apos;s Garden on Flatlands Avenue on January 4th around 8:30 p.m., only to be stopped mid-leap by employees waving soup ladles and other kitchen utensils. One worker even takes up a stool to better intimidate the attacker.</p>

<p>Restaurant workers deserve these better wages, yo.</p>

<p>The suspect in the incident, &quot;last seen wearing a black mask, an orange hooded sweater, light colored jeans and orange work boots,&quot; according to the NYPD, is now wanted in connection with several other robberies that occurred on Flatlands Avenue.</p>

<p>Earlier on January 4th, police believe the same individual robbed a Baskin Robbins, making off with $533 from the cash register. On December 16th, the same individual allegedly passed a note demanding money to a Dunkin Donuts employee, who handed over $320. And on December 29th, it&apos;s thought this same person displayed a knife to a KFC/Taco Bell employee, who gave him $876 from the cash register.</p>

<p>No petty register cash is worth your life, but maybe it&apos;s time for fast food joints to start serving soup. </p>
