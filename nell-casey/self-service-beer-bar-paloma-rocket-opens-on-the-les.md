<p>It&apos;s a pour your own pint situation at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110091048/http://www.palomarocket.com/">Paloma Rocket</a>, a newly-debuted Lower East Side beer bar at 7 Clinton Street. The high tech new bar offers some 30 brews on tap, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110091048/http://bedfordandbowery.com/2016/04/rocket-paloma-a-self-serve-bar-is-the-16-handles-of-wackiest-beers/">reports Bedford and Bowery</a>, and customers can read all about them on screens atop each tap handle before pulling the lever and committing. And all the while, minimum human interaction. Bliss!</p>

<p>There are staff members (&quot;Beer Ambassadors&quot;), of course, there to help if need be and also to sell you a &quot;Beer 2 Go&quot; card, which you&apos;ll use to pay for the brews as you go. Pick from a pint up to a growler, with beers going between 40 cents and $1.20 per once, depending on what kind of beer you&apos;re going for. There are plans to expand the offerings in the future, too. &quot;Before you blink your eyes she will be running with Prosecco and wine on tap, an artisanal sausages and roasted veggie menu, sake/soju cocktails, a super fun beer program, a beer academy, and a sidewalk cafe...&quot; according to the website.</p>

<p>The bar&apos;s only in soft open mode at the moment, which means Fridays and Saturdays and the only time to stop by for a drink. But come May, expect full-time hours plus some of the above promises, perhaps. </p>
