<p>We&apos;ve seen <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150302042051/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/07/two_boots_combines_pizza_and_reuben.php">pizza with pastrami</a> and pizza with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150302042051/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/07/two_boots_combines_pizza_and_reuben.php">hot dogs and fries</a> and now it&apos;s time to welcome the latest pizza-hybrid: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150302042051/http://chopsticksandmarrow.com/2013/12/the-falafel-slice-at-benjys-is-a-marvelous-mashup/">falafel pizza</a>. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150302042051/https://twitter.com/joedistefano">Joe DiStefano</a>, the intrepid food adventurer behind <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150302042051/http://chopsticksandmarrow.com/">Chopsticks + Marrow</a>, found this beauty at (deep breath) Benjy&apos;s Kosher Pizza Dairy Restaurant &amp; Sushi Bar in Flushing, Queens. </p>

<p>The awkwardly-named restaurant offers a regular slice of pizza topped with six falafel balls for just $3.25. DiStefano ordered his with tahini and hot sauce, of course, and describes the creation as &quot;messy, salty, nutty, crunchy, cheesy and spicy: exactly what a mashup of Middle Eastern and New York City street food should be.&quot; Yelpers also note the joint does a french fries pizza as well.</p>

<p>DiStefano, who makes a habit of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150302042051/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/23/behold_the_tex-japanese_lobster_rol.php">finding unusual eats in Queens</a>, claims it&apos;s the best novely slice he&apos;s ever eaten. Macaulay Culkin is probably <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150302042051/http://gothamist.com/2013/12/14/scenes_from_macaulay_culkins_inaugu.php#photo-1">writing an ode to it</a> as we speak.</p>
