<p><strong>Oktoberfest at Watermark Bar on Pier 15</strong> This East River adjacent outdoor bar is going full party mode for their weekend Oktobefestivities. Stein holding competitions, cornhole, pongs of both the ping and beer variety are among the activities to keep drinkers entertained.

There&apos;s also the option for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027165820/http://www.eventbrite.com/e/oktoberfest-2016-nyc-tickets-22257700381">unlimited beer tastings ($60) </a> during two sessions on Saturdays and Sundays. <em>Through October 2nd. 78 South Street, (212) 742-8200; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027165820/http://watermarkny.com/">watermarkny.com</a></em></p>

<p><strong>Brooklyn Bavarian Biergarten</strong> The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027165820/http://gothamist.com/2015/07/23/grand_prospect_hall_beer_garden_1.php#photo-1">pretty beer garden</a> inside the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027165820/http://gothamist.com/2015/08/27/grand_prospect_hall_tour.php#photo-1">magnificent</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027165820/http://www.grandprospect.com/">Grand Prospect Hall</a> hosts their own mini Oktoberfest with plenty of beer and a lush setting in which to drink copious amounts of it. The Biergarten also promises live music performances featuring The Spitzbaum, games, Bavarian-inspired food like brats and soft pretzels and the chance to enjoy the outdoors for a few more days. <em>Through October 3rd. 265 Prospect Avenue, (718) 788-0400; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027165820/http://brooklynbavarianbiergarten.com/">brooklynbavarianbiergarten.com</a></em></p>

<p><strong>Shacktoberfest at Shake Shack</strong> NYC&apos;s homegrown burger chain celebrates the season each year with their limited time menu of Bavarian-inspired eats and drinks. As with previous iterations, they&apos;re launching their specialty beer option, the 25-ounce Shake Shack Bier Stein ($10) on Friday. Their new offering this year is a Bavarian-Style Soft Pretzel ($2.99) which can be supplemented with cheese sauce for an additional $1. <em>September 23rd through October 2nd. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027165820/https://www.shakeshack.com/">Multiple locations</a></em></p>

<p><strong>Blue Ribbon&apos;s Oktoberfest</strong> For a similarly low-key (and possibly bro-free) Oktobefest celebration, head over to either <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027165820/http://www.blueribbonrestaurants.com/restaurants/blue-ribbon-brasserie-brooklyn/">Blue Ribbon Brooklyn</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027165820/http://theribbonnyc.com/">The Ribbon</a> for house-made sausages and pretzels courtesy of Blue Ribbon&apos;s German chef Martin Brock. All the comforting favorites are on offer, like Bavarian Bratwurst with sauerkraut and tarragon mustard ($14), cheese spaetzle with caramelized onions ($12), and Pretzels with Bavarian beer cheese ($8) plus a more modern interpretation of Braised Pork belly with potato puree and Brussels sprouts ($19). <em>Through the end of October. 280 5th Avenue, Brooklyn, (718) 840-0404 // 20 West 72nd Street, (212) 787-5656</em></p>

<p><strong>Dirt Candy&apos;s Oktoberfest Dinner</strong> It&apos;s tough to be a vegetarian at most Oktoberfest celebrations, where you&apos;re lucky to get a pretzel and maybe some sauerkraut. But chef Amanda Cohen&apos;s changing the game at this completely <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027165820/http://gothamist.com:80/2016/09/21/oktoberfest_nyc_2016.php">vegetarian Oktoberfest dinner</a> on October 4th at her restaurant <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027165820/http://www.dirtcandynyc.com/">Dirt Candy</a>.

Each course is paired with a beer curated by Top Hops Beer Shop. Seatings begin at 5:30 p.m.; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027165820/http://dirtcandyoktoberfestdinner.brownpapertickets.com/">tickets $120</a> and include tip but not tax. <em>October 4th. 86 Allen Street, (212) 228-7732; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027165820/http://www.dirtcandynyc.com/">dirtcandynyc.com</a></em></p>

<p><strong>Reichenbach Hall</strong> Billed as NYC&apos;s largest German beer hall, this Midtown option&apos;s a good go-to for post-work raising of the steins and devouring of the schnitzels. They&apos;ve got an enormous menu of German eats beyond the expected sausages and pretzels, 14 German beers in 1/2 liter, liter and 2 liter boots, and they&apos;ll be doing live music select evenings through the end of October. <em>5 West 37th Street, (212) 302-7744; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027165820/http://reichenbachhall.com/">reichenbachhall.com</a></em></p>

<p><strong>Circle Line&apos;s Bear Mountain Cruise</strong> Or, you could just get the heck out of town. Look: once you&apos;ve seen one beer stein holding competition and plate of bratwurst, you&apos;ve seen &apos;em all, so you may as well be experiencing it beneath fall&apos;s lovely foliage and out on the open river. Saturdays and Sundays until November 6th and on Monday, October 10 (Columbus Day), hop aboard the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027165820/https://www.circleline42.com/cruises-and-schedules/bear-mountain-cruises/">Bear Mountain Cruise</a>, which sails up the Hudson to Bear Mountain State Park. The 2.5 hour cruise offers German food and beers for purchase, plus German Oom-pah &amp; Polka bands. They&apos;ll drop you at Bear Mountain where you can do some drunken hiking and enjoy the beer-enhanced nature. (Note that the annual <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027165820/http://visitbearmountain.com/special-events/oktoberfest/">Oktoberfest celebration</a> is unfortunately no longer at Bear Mountain Inn.) <em>Through November 4th, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027165820/https://www.circleline42.com/cruises-and-schedules/bear-mountain-cruises/">tickets $65</a>. Cruise launches from Pier 83 at West 42nd Street</em></p>
