<p>Last evening Guinness announced it would <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509170913/http://gothamist.com/2014/03/16/heineken_sam_adams_pull_out_of_st_p.php">join Heinekin and Samuel Adams</a> in pulling its sponsorship from today&apos;s St. Patrick&apos;s Day parade in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509170913/http://www.glaad.org/blog/guinness-drops-sponsorship-anti-lgbt-nyc-st-patricks-day-parade">support of New York&apos;s LGBT community</a>. Iconic gay rights bar Stonewall Inn had previously indicated it would not serve the stout in light of the company&apos;s continued participation in the parade; the bar has since restocked the beer in anticipation of crowds for today&apos;s celebration. </p>

<p>The move has drawn support from City Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito, who had joined fellow council members and Mayor de Blasio in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509170913/http://gothamist.com/2014/02/25/city_council_joins_boycott_of_st_pa.php">boycotting today&apos;s parade</a>, which would not allow gay marchers to identify as such. &quot;I want to commend Guinness, Sam Adams and Heineken for taking a stand on behalf of the LGBT community who should be able to march openly and proudly in the St. Patrick&apos;s Day Parade,&quot; she said in a statement. &quot;These businesses are sending a clear message that New York&apos;s St. Patrick&apos;s Day Parade needs to be inclusive to all New Yorkers.&quot; </p>

<p>GLAAD CEO and President Sarah Kate Ellis also championed the brand, saying the beer company had &quot;sent a strong message to its customers and employees: discrimination should never be celebrated.&quot; Others expressed support for the move, including John McGuire of Clifton, NJ. &quot;That&apos;s cool,&quot; he told us this morning at 7th Avenue&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509170913/http://www.theirishpubnyc.com/">The Irish Pub</a>. &quot;Everyone should be allowed to join the party.&quot;</p>

<p>Not everyone appreciated the spirit of inclusion, however. Irishman Ray Brophy criticized the beer company&apos;s actions, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509170913/http://nypost.com/2014/03/16/guinness-pulls-sponsorship-from-st-pattys-parade-over-lgbt-ban/">telling the Post</a>, &quot;Guinness should have just ignored them,&quot; referring to GLAAD&apos;s and other pro-gay outlet&apos;s calls for boycott. &quot;St. Patrick&apos;s Day isn&apos;t about gay or straight. It&apos;s about celebrating St. Patrick.&quot; Another Gothamist reader took it to the next level via email, promising she would &quot;use none of the products of the companies that withdrew their support of the NYC and Boston parades.&quot; </p>
