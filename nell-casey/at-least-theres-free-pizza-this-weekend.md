<p>If there&apos;s a single thing we can feel a scintilla of joy about this weekend, it&apos;s <strong>free pizza</strong>. On Saturday, because it&apos;s &quot;National Pizza Day&quot;&#x2014;this is a daily holiday in NYC, as far as we&apos;re concerned&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161114174245/http://www.rossonyc.com/#the-real-neapolitan-experience">Rossopomodoro</a> in the West Village will be giving away pizza portafoglio, a Neapolitan specialty that&apos;s an entire pie folded in quarters. Walk over to their back kitchen between 4 and 6 p.m. to get your pizza.</p>

<p>In Bushwick, the <strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161114174245/https://veganshopup.wordpress.com/">Vegan Shop Up!</a></strong> returns to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161114174245/http://www.pineboxrockshop.com/">Pine Box Rock Shop</a> on Saturday for an afternoon celebrating cruelty-free foods and goods. Beginning at noon, the Shop Up opens for grilled cheese, pizza, tacos, pumpkin pie, bbq seitan sandwiches, peanut butter cups and dozens of other options for eating your feelings. There&apos;ll also be animal product-free beauty supplies like vegan lipsticks and soaps. </p>

She&apos;ll be cooking up dishes including Kimchi Carbonara Ddukbokki and Korean Fried Rice Arancini, plus banchan/antipasti like Kabocha Squash Caponata and Puttanesca Lil&apos; Fishies. Cash only. </p>

The moon&apos;ll be the closest it&apos;s been to Earth since 1948, appearing 14% larger and 30% brighter than your average moon. In celebration, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161114174245/http://www.paulineandsharons.com/">Pauline &amp; Sharon&apos;s</a> in South Slope are baking up pizza pies that are 14% larger than their average large pie, topped with astrophysicist Neil Degrasse Tyson&apos;s favorite pizza toppings: pepperoni, garlic and mozzarella.
