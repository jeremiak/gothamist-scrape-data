<p>What should have been the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170616153124/http://gothamist.com/2017/03/04/manhattan_cocktail_classic_2017.php">triumphant return</a> of the glitzy <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170616153124/http://www.manhattancocktailclassic.com/">Manhattan Cocktail Classic</a> has seemingly devolved into a confused mess as ticket holders to Friday night&apos;s star-studded Gala were informed of its cancelation just over 24 hours before the event. </p>

<p>Ticket holders to the Gala, a cornerstone of the event since its inception that was advertised as a black-tie event <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170616153124/http://www.nydailynews.com/bill-murray-shake-manhattan-cocktail-classic-article-1.3052677?sdfosdhfosdh=/dfoshdfos">hosted by Bill Murray</a>, were informed by MCC management just before 3 p.m. on Wednesday that the event had been canceled &quot;due to circumstances beyond our control.&quot; It&apos;s not clear from the email whether tickets, which were priced at $275 per person for GA and $350 for VIP, were immediately refunded. </p>

<p>People who had purchased tickets through <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170616153124/https://pulsd.com/new-york">Pulsd</a>&#x2014;a Groupon-like service&#x2014;were also informed of the Gala cancelation and were offered an opportunity to buy tickets to an MCC-related event at the Highline Ballroom (along with another unrelated event), which Pulsd representatives were &quot;[assured]...will be taking place.&quot; This contradicts the email from MCC management, which indicated that &quot;all events associated&quot; with the Classic had been canceled. There&apos;s some confusion as to whether the Highline event is directly related to the MCC, but it&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170616153124/https://tickets.cocktailclassic.com/eventperformances.asp?evt=300">listed through the MCC website</a> [<strong>Update below</strong>]. Pulsd ticket buyers were issued immediate refunds for Gala purchases. </p>

<p>A publicist for the MCC was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170616153124/https://www.facebook.com/jamesamonahan/posts/10154984386962928">posting to social media</a> as recently as yesterday flaunting the Murray appearance and urging followers to purchase tickets. So far, there&apos;s been no public comment about the cancellation on social media or the MCC website by anyone directly related to the festival&apos;s planning and organization. </p>

<p>We&apos;ve reached out to representatives for the MCC, along with Central Park&apos;s Loeb Boathouse&#x2014;where the Gala was supposed to take place&#x2014;and we&apos;ll update when we hear back. If anyone knows Bill Murray&apos;s 1-800 number please <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170616153124/mailto:nell@gothamist.com">pass it along</a>.</p>

<p>The MCC had been on hiatus for the past two years following another messy <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170616153124/https://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/2015/04/manhattan-cocktail-classic-2015-cancelled/">cancelation</a> of the events in 2015. The 2017 was under the new direction of James Moreland, who&apos;d moved the Gala from the New York Public Library to Central Park, among other proposed changes. </p>

<p>Some in the NYC cocktail community have already made the most logical comparison:</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Producer Jonathan Pogash tells Gothamist &quot;our event &apos;A Decadent Afternoon of Chocolate, BBQ &amp; Cocktails&apos; is run independent of MCC and is 100% on for this Saturday, May 13th.&quot; You can purchase tickets <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170616153124/https://www.eventbrite.com/e/decadent-afternoon-of-chocolate-bbq-and-cocktails-tickets-34541058235">here</a>. </p>
