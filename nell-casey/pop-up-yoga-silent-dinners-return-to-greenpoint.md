<p>Greenpoint restaurant <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420054043/http://eatgreenpoint.com/">Eat</a> has been hosting silent Sunday night suppers for diners looking to escape chatty companions and enjoy a more focused, reflective eating experience. Recently they&apos;ve partnered with pop-up creators <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420054043/http://imaginationinspace.com/about/">Imagination in Space</a> to bring some physical focus into the mix, with combination yoga and silent dinner experiences. If you&apos;re thinking this might be the most Brooklyn thing ever, you&apos;re <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420054043/http://observer.com/2014/01/hush-little-burger-inside-the-mind-of-a-silent-dinner-survivor/">not far off</a>. </p>

<p>They&apos;ve got their next exercise/eating combo coming up next Monday, February 24th. The evening begins with a 60 minute class led by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420054043/https://twitter.com/PopUpYogaNYC">Pop Up Yoga</a> founder Angelic Olstad. It&apos;s an open level class, so if you aren&apos;t a regular practitioner don&apos;t fret. Unless the hard restaurant floor appeals to you, be sure to BYO mat&#x2014;a towel can do in a pinch. </p>

<p>After the mats are rolled up, out come the tables and chairs for the vegetarian meal constructed with local and organic ingredients. On the menu this month: Roasted Parsnip Bisque with Toasted Sage; Curry Mulled French Lentils With Chili Ghee, Brown Jasmine Rice and Violet Slaw; and Butternut Pecan Mousse with Shaved Apple and Herbs. </p>

<p>It&apos;s not a completely vice-free evening, praise be; they&apos;re popping bottles of Prosecco once the stretching and posing concludes and encourage diners to bring their own booze to supplement the meal. All those fizzing bubbles and popping corks will help break up all the deafening silence. </p>

<p><em>February 24, 7:30 p.m. at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420054043/http://eatgreenpoint.com/">EAT Greenpoint</a>, 124 Meserole Avenue, (718) 389-8083; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420054043/http://yogawolves.splashthat.com/">Tickets $65</a></em></p>
