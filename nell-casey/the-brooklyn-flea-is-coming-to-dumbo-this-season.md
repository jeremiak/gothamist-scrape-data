<p>As the city prepares to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170404213100/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/11/bushwick_inlet_park_purchase.php">enlarge Bushwick Inlet Park</a>&#x2014;displacing the Brooklyn Flea&apos;s longtime home at 50 Kent in Williamsburg&#x2014;the pop-up market has found a new spot to settle in the shadow of the Manhattan Bridge in DUMBO. Beginning April 3rd, and continuing Sundays throughout the season, around 75 vendors will populate <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170404213100/https://www.google.com/maps/place/Pearl+Street+Triangle+(Dumbo+Improvement+District)/@40.7029874,-73.9888289,18z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x89c25a33c6ae382b:0xa9eecd4d63de1c82">Pearl Plaza</a>, a trio of spaces that includes the Dumbo Archway, Anchorage Place and the Pearl Street Triangle, spaces that have seen their share of food vendors popping up throughout the outdoor market season. </p>

<p>Brooklyn Flea co-found Eric Demby says he&apos;s excited to be returning to the neighborhood that has hosted various iterations of both the Flea and Smorgasburg throughout the years, starting with a Flea encampment beneath the Brooklyn Bridge in 2009. &quot;The winding cobblestone streets and mix of visitors and locals is classic market terrain, and train passages are historic places for selling all over the world,&quot; Demby told us via email this afternoon. &quot;The Flea in DUMBO will feature about 75 vendors, with maybe 10 selling food, so the focus will be on high-quality (&apos;nice&apos;) vintage clothing, antiques and collectibles, rugs and textiles, and furniture and housewares.&quot;</p>

<p>The full vendor lineup hasn&apos;t yet been released, but Demby dropped <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170404213100/http://www.heirloombk.com/">Heirloom</a> (who sell beautiful, handmade Oriental rugs), <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170404213100/http://www.spartanantiques.com/">Spartan Antiques</a> (mid-century modern furniture) and new vendor Bash and Pop Records. As for the eats, expect folks including <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170404213100/http://thegoodbatch.com/">The Good Batch</a>, who&apos;ll be selling ice cream sandwiches like the Goodwich, with Oat Chocolate Chunk cookies, sea salt, drizzled fudge and vanilla ice cream.</p>

<p>The Winter Flea and Smorgasburg will end their run at Industry City on the weekend of March 26th and 27th. The Fort Greene Flea and Williamsbug Smorgasburg both begin Saturday, April 2rd, while the Prospect Park Smorgasburg opens Sunday, April 3rd.</p>
