<p>On Tuesday came news that Keith McNally&apos;s Meatpacking District restaurant Pastis would <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408150208/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/01/iconic_restaurant_pastis_will_shutt.php">shut its doors</a> at the beginning of next year, laying off some 200 employees. McNally had previously indicated that the restaurant would close for building renovations and then ultimately reopen and it seems he&apos;s sticking to that story.</p>

<p>The restaurateur <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408150208/http://ny.eater.com/archives/2013/10/keith_mcnally_my_plan_is_to_reopen_pastis.php">told Eater NY</a> he plans to &quot;reopen Pastis as soon as construction is finished,&quot; likely in January of 2015. Hopefully this puts to rest the Pastis will-it-or-won&apos;t-it saga, but we put in a call to landlord Aurora Capital to confirm. We&apos;ll update if we hear back. </p>
