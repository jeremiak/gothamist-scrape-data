<p>The annual <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170424211425/http://burgerconquest.com/2017/04/10/ny-burger-week-2017-event-info-and-tickets/">Burger Week</a> festivities commence on May 1st, the start of a week&apos;s worth of special burger collaborations and events. Each <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170424211425/http://gothamist.com/tags/burgerweek">year</a> some of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170424211425/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/01/best_burgers_nyc.php">biggest names in burgers</a> join forces to create special burgers or offer unique experiences like booze pairings and, this year, judging an air guitar competition. </p>

<p>Unsurprisingly, the Monday night event with Emmy Squared&apos;s Matthew Hyland is already sold out (you can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170424211425/https://www.eventbrite.com/waitlist?eid=33569247523&amp;tid=0">join the waitlist</a> if you want), but there are still seats available for the Tuesday through Sunday events. Wednesday there&apos;s a juicy lucy beer and whiskey dinner featuring three cheese-filled burgers from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170424211425/http://whitmansnyc.com/">Whitman&apos;s</a>, loaded blue cheese fries and one beer and one whiskey per person ($40). And on Thursday, watch air guitar competitors while eating mini &quot;metal-themed&quot; burgers from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170424211425/http://dukesnyc.com/">Duke&apos;s</a>, more loaded fries and one draft beer ($38). </p>
