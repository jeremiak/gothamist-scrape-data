</i></div> <p></p>

<p>Staten Island&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170416203521/http://gothamist.com/2015/06/26/staten_islands_north_shore_might_lo.php">&quot;hip&quot; new waterfront</a> retail corridor will be blessed with a Shake Shack, the first to open in the borough. The forthcoming Empire Outlets, which will accompany the New York Wheel, will house the Shack along with other home-grown food chains including Two Boots, Nathan&apos;s, Mighty Quinn&apos;s. </p>

<p>But back to the Shack. Plans include 947-square-feet of outdoor dining, with views into Lower Manhattan previously reserved for ferry goers and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170416203521/http://gothamist.com/2015/07/08/staten_island_yankees_tour.php#photo-1">ballpark attendees</a>. The restaurant&apos;s scheduled to open in March of 2018 along with the rest of the Empire shops.</p>

<p>The complex will also feature &quot;Staten Island&apos;s first-ever artisanal food hall,&quot; called MRKTPL, which will include a whopping 30 different food and beverage vendors. I&apos;ll never forget you, Staten Island Mall food court. </p>

<p>Speaking of the Staten Island Mall, Shake Shack had previously announced <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170416203521/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/17/shake_shack_staten_island.php">plans to open there</a>, a spokesperson tells Gothamist that&apos;s not scheduled to happen until 2019. </p>
