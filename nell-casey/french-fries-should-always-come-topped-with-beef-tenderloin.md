title: French Fries Should Always Come Topped With Beef Tenderloin

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160803051537/http://gothamist.com/2015/11/19/llama_inn_peruvian_williamsburg.php">Peer through the giant windows</a> at Williamsburg&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160803051537/http://www.llamainnnyc.com/">Llama Inn</a> and you&apos;re likely to behold a table of diners eagerly tucking into what looks like a gigantic heap of french fries next to a stack of pancakes. You&apos;d be witness the restaurant&apos;s Beef Tenderloin Stir Fry, one of two feast-type dishes available at the Peruvian spot, which has been packing in customers nightly since opening last November. If you&apos;re not <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160803051537/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/03/lobster_bisque_fries_is_poutine_for.php">topping fries with lobster</a>, beef tenderloin is the next best thing.</p>

<p>Chef Eriz Ramirez tells us the dish is his version of Lomo Saltado, a well-known export from Peru (the other being ceviche, as he points out). &quot;It begins with a prep similar to our version at Llama, starting a tender cut of steak in a wok with a soy sauce base, and combining the stir fry with onions and tomatoes,&quot; he explains. &quot;In Peru the dish is traditionally served with rice.&quot; For his version, they&apos;re using fries instead, topped with cilantro and scallions.</p>

<p>Beneath all those potatoes: large chunks of beef, which are cooked in a wok over &quot;super high heat.&quot; As the source of filet mignon, the tenderloin has a great beef flavor and is super tender&#x2014;you don&apos;t even need a fancy steak knife&#x2014;unlike some of the tougher cuts sometimes used in a stir fry preparation. </p>

<p>On the side, scallion pancakes, which Ramirez says are &quot;one of the more labor intensive items on the menu.&quot; They&apos;re prepared similarly to a French crepe, so the resulting pancake is extremely thin and tender, &quot;though they have a slight crisp and deeper brown color than classic crepes you&apos;re used to&quot; Ramirez says. The idea is to gather up a little bit of all of the ingredients&#x2014;which also includes slices of avocado, house-pickled chilies and a crema made with fiery rocoto peppers and Peruvian black mint&#x2014;wrap it in a tortilla and eat it like a taco. </p>

<p>It&apos;s one of the tastiest dishes I&apos;ve put in my mouth this year, in addition to being fun (and messy) to eat. Don&apos;t let the $48 sticker shock startle you; it&apos;s easily shareable among a few people&#x2014;it was <em>too much food</em> for two, especially if you&apos;re ordering other stuff. It heats up well, too, if you&apos;re taking the remains, even the fries, a notoriously difficult leftovers component. Perhaps it&apos;s because they start off so crunchy and perfect to begin with. How does Ramirez accomplish that? &quot;It&apos;s not a secret if I tell you, but they are delicious right?&quot;  </p>
