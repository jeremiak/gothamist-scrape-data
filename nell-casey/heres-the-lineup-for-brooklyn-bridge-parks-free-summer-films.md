The Big Lebowski on the big screen in 2010 (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120529120532/http://www.flickr.com/">Flickr</a>/<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120529120532/http://www.flickr.com/photos/zokuga/4820185603/">Dan Nguyen @ New York City</a></i></div> <p></p>

<p>Shake out the picnic blanket and hose down the cooler: free films in Brooklyn Bridge Park are back!<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120529120532/http://www.brooklynbridgepark.org/go/programs-/-events/syfy-movies-with-a-view"> &quot;Movies With A View&quot;</a> begins its 13th season with the Spielberg classic <em>ET</em> on July 5th&#x2014;perhaps a nod to co-sponsor Syfy&#x2014;with screenings continuing every Thursday through the end of August on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120529120532/http://www.brooklynbridgepark.org/go/the-park/the-park-today/pier-1">Pier 1</a>. We can&apos;t confirm yet, but rumor has it several cast members from <em>Wet Hot American Summer</em> are being persuaded to come introduce the film on August 2nd. (Last year Spike Lee surfaced to introduce the <em>Crooklyn</em> screening.) Fingers crossed for Christopher Meloni to fill the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120529120532/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/25/say_it_isnt_so_christopher_meloni_q.php">gaping hole in our hearts</a>!</p>

<p>Like last year, Ditch Plains and Calexio will be on hand <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120529120532/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/16/your_guide_to_this_summers_outdoor.php#photo-1">in the park to serve you food</a>&#x2014;and you&apos;ll definitely be able to drink in the Manhattan skyline and imbibe whatever delicious beverages you&apos;ve brought along in your thermos. Alcohol is prohibited, so try to be subtle, and no chairs with metal frames are permitted on the lawn.</p>

<p>Here&apos;s the schedule&#x2014;which films are you most excited about? </p><ul><li>July 5: <em>ET</em> <br>
</li><li>July 12: <em>To Kill A Mockingbird</em> <br>
</li><li>July 19: <em>Slumdog Millionaire</em> <br>
</li><li>July 26: <em>Clueless</em> <br>
</li><li>Aug. 2: <em>Wet Hot American Summer</em> <br>

</li><li>Aug. 30: Public vote: <em>Across the Universe</em>, <em>Shaun of the Dead</em> or <em>Splendor in the Grass</em></li></ul><p></p>

<p>Another sweet lineup, but it will be hard to beat last year&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120529120532/http://gothamist.com/2011/07/20/five_reasons_why_you_need_to_see_sw.php#photo-1">greatest NYC film ever</a>! </p>
