<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140309074929/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/15/sushi_nakazawa.php#photo-1">haute sushi renaissance</a> covers just one facet of Japan&apos;s many culinary specialities. Experience many other dishes and flavors at this year&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140309074929/http://japanweek.us/restaurantweek/rw_year/2014/">Japanese Restaurant Week</a>, a celebration of the country&apos;s unique culinary identity. Different regions have their own specialties, like beautifully marbled Kobe beef from Hyogo and rich, briny sea urchin from Hokkaido; organizers have highlighted specific restaurants to procure these ingredients, making it easy to chose which to patronize.</p>

<p>It&apos;s actually a restaurant<em> month</em>, despite the nomenclature. Beginning February 17th and running through March 16th, 28 restaurants are offering specials from tasting plates to discounted grub to free appetizers. There&apos;s everything from ramen to sushi to curry on the table; check out the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140309074929/http://japanweek.us/restaurantweek/rw_year/2014/">full list of participants</a> to find a deal that suits you. Make sure to pick up a copy of the Japanese Week Restaurant Guide (available in the restaurant&apos;s front waiting areas) to get the promotions.</p>

<p>This all leads up to the annual <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140309074929/http://japanweek.us/">Japan Week</a> celebration, which takes over Grand Central Terminal March 6th through March 8th. This year&apos;s theme centers around the 100th anniversary of the Tokyo Station, with vendors offering a peek back at the era when it was constructed. The full exhibitor list and schedule hasn&apos;t been announced yet, but if <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140309074929/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/11/sake_bar_bento_boxes_and_more_at_ja.php">last year&apos;s edition</a> is any indication, expect sake samplings, music and dance performances and other cultural demonstrations. </p>
