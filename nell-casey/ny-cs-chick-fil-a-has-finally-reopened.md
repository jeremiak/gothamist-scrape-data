<p>The shroud over 6th Avenue and 37th Street has been lifted, as NYC&apos;s first official Chick-Fil-A has resumed vending its fried chicken sandwiches. Nearly a week after it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160601003906/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/03/chick-fil-a_closed_doh.php">voluntarily shuttered</a> following a grim inspection by the DOH, the fried chicken chain opened its doors this morning, a day later than initially planned. The restaurant had racked up 59 violation points during an inspection on Christmas Eve; ah, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160601003906/http://www.forbes.com/sites/clareoconnor/2014/03/19/chick-fil-a-ceo-cathy-gay-marriage-still-wrong-but-ill-shut-up-about-it-and-sell-chicken/">sweet karma</a>.  </p>

<p>&quot;We opened at 6:30 a.m. following the completion of our voluntary shut-down to perform maintenance and facilities updates. We appreciate our customers&apos; patience and look forward to serving them soon,&quot; the company <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160601003906/http://www.cnbc.com/2016/01/04/long-awaited-nyc-chick-fil-a-still-closed-blame-the-flies.html">told CNBC</a>. The company <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160601003906/http://inside.chick-fil-a.com/new-york-city-restaurant-temporarily-closed/">released a statement</a> on its website yesterday, copping to the findings by the DOH and explaining how they&apos;d set about fixing the issues. </p>

<p>It&apos;s only been a few months since the restaurant <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160601003906/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/01/inside_chickfila_nyc.php#photo-1">officially opened in October</a>, so apparently operating in a &quot;very busy urban environment&quot;&#x2014;as they point out in their statement&#x2014;got the better of them. Meanwhile, we&apos;ll just casually enjoy the irony of an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160601003906/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/02/chick-fil-as_charitable_foundation.php">anti-LGBT</a>, Bible-thumping fast food chain being <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160601003906/http://biblehub.com/topical/f/flies.htm">infested with flies</a>. </p>
