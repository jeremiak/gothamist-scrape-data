                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="112912211.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130918040839im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_nellcasey/112912211.jpg" width="640" height="427"> <br> <i> <span class="photo_caption">21 Club (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130918040839/http://colormekatie.blogspot.com/">Katie Sokoler</a>/Gothamist)</span></i></div> <p></p>

<p>It&apos;s almost restaurant <em>month</em> at this point, but the dining deals are returning for another iteration this year, and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130918040839/http://www.nycgo.com/restaurantweek/?pid=hp-hero-1-full_image">reservation lines</a> are now officially open. If you didn&apos;t <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130918040839/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/07/reservation_lines_open_for_nyc_rest.php">get in last time</a>, you have another chance to score a discounted lunch or dinner at nearly 300 restaurants offering special prix-fixe menus to diners on a budget. </p>

<p>Depending on the establishment, you can get a three course lunch ($25) or dinner ($38), though keep in mind that price doesn&apos;t include tax, tip or any of the multiple drinks you&apos;re accustomed to tossing back with your meals. It&apos;s also worth checking out each spot&apos;s Restaurant Week menu in advance, because though a restaurant might be famous for a certain dish, there are no guarantees it&apos;ll make it onto the cheapskate menu.</p>

<p>The deals begin on July 22nd and run through August 16th, with the special menus available Monday through Friday and the occasional Sunday. The full list of restaurants can be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130918040839/http://www.nycgo.com/restaurantweek/?pid=hp-hero-1-full_image">found here</a> and most include an option for booking your reservation on the site. Make a quick decision on some of the bigger name joints, as they tend to fill up the more desirable reservation times early on. </p>
