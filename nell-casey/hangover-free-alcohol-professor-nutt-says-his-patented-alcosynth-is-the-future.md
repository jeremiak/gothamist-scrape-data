<p>Here&apos;s some life-changing news that won&apos;t come soon enough to save anyone this weekend: a professor in England has developed a synthetic alcohol that gets you &quot;drunk&quot; but won&apos;t give you a hangover. Without suffering, how can we know we&apos;re <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028111214/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/08/drinking_for_journalism_we_put_thre.php">truly alive</a>?</p>

<p>The <strike>&apos;80s electronica band</strike> new drink, &quot;Alcosynth,&quot; was created by David Nutt, a former government drugs advisor turned futuristic booze pusher. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028111214/http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/hangover-free-alcohol-david-nutt-alcosynth-nhs-postive-effects-benzodiazepine-guy-bentley-a7324076.html">The Independent reports</a> that Nutt has patented about 90 alcosynth compounds but is currently testing two he hopes will eliminate traditional alcohol by 2050. </p>

<p>Alcosynth functions similarly to regular alcohol, mimicking the effects in the brain without damaging the body, particularly the liver and heart. There&apos;s also a &quot;max out&quot; feature, where the effects of the faux-cohol plateau after &quot;about four or five &apos;drinks&apos;&quot; so imbibers can&apos;t get falling down &quot;drunk.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;We haven&apos;t tested it to destruction yet, but it&apos;s safer than drinking too much alcohol,&quot; Nutt says. &quot;With clever pharmacology, you can limit and put a ceiling on the effects, so you can&apos;t ever get as ill or kill yourself, unlike with drinking a lot of vodka.&quot;</p>

<p>As a fun aside, Nutt was fired from his government job after he &quot;claimed taking ecstasy was less dangerous than riding a horse.&quot; So, there&apos;s that.</p>

<p>The British Department of Health hasn&apos;t thrown any funding Nutt&apos;s way just yet, but said they were interested in the &quot;better workforce efficiency&quot; that would result in a hangover-free population. Given the world&apos;s penchant for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028111214/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/09/everyone_who_drinks_regularly_is_a.php">overindulging in alcohol</a>, it seems like a no-brainer to reduce the deleterious effects of alcohol consumption while still allowing the public the blow off a little steam. </p>

<p>Until such a time as we aren&apos;t forced to wear sunglasses on the subway, there&apos;s always <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028111214/http://gothamist.com/2016/09/08/alcohol_canceled_out_by_exercise.php">exercise</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028111214/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/19/coffee_alcoholics_liver_yay.php">coffee</a>...<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028111214/http://gothamist.com/2016/09/22/coffee_climate_change.php">for now</a>.</p>
