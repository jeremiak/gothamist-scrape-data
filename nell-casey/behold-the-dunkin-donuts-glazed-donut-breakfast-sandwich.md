<p>Not since the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150304125223/http://gothamist.com/2010/11/05/dunkin_donuts_introduces_meat_munch.php">Meat Munchkins</a> has there been such a diabolical creation to come from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150304125223/http://gothamist.com/2008/09/02/brooklyn_prefers_dunkin_donuts_over.php">Brooklyn&apos;s favorite coffee-and-pastry purveyor</a>. Dunkin&apos; Donuts will <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150304125223/http://bigstory.ap.org/article/dunkin-taking-doughnut-breakfast-sandwich-national">unleash the Glazed Donut Breakfast Sandwich</a> upon the nation starting on June 7, which is apparently <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150304125223/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Doughnut_Day">&quot;National Donut (Doughnut) Day&quot;</a> so...mark your calendars, or whatever!</p>

The new breakfast creation&#x2014;&quot;Going Where No Breakfast Has Gone&quot;...Before?&#x2014;sandwiches bacon slices and a pepper fried egg between two halves of a Glazed Donut&#x2014;though <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150304125223/http://www.grubstreet.com/2013/06/dunkin-donuts-doughnut-breakfast-sandwich.html">GrubStreet notes</a> that the donut choice is customizable. Surprisingly, this sugar-soaked mess <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150304125223/https://www.dunkindonuts.com/content/dunkindonuts/en/menu/food/sandwiches/breakfastsandwiches/Glazed_donut_breakfast_sandwich.html">only runs 360</a> calories, making it less caloric than most of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150304125223/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/28/big_n_toasty_breakfast_sandwich_deb.php">other breakfast sandwiches</a> the chain offers. </p>

<p>Can this donut-sandwich hybrid cut through the noise of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150304125223/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/23/krispy_kreme_donuts_take_kfc_double.php">donut-sandwich hybrids</a> that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150304125223/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/22/but_why_arent_there_any_grilled_che.php">came before</a>? Can this new food beast exist in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150304125223/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/31/the_dossant.php">the world of the Cronut</a>?
