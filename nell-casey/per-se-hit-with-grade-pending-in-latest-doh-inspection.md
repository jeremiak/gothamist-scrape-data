<p>Here&apos;s proof positive that it&apos;s not just greasy spoons that get put through the ringer by the Health Department&apos;s inspection system. Thomas Keller&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508162312/http://gothamist.com/2013/12/30/restaurant_map.php">lauded restaurant</a> Per Se was slapped with 42 points on its most recent inspection on February 19th, earning the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508162312/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/30/the_best_places_to_splurge_in_nyc.php">pricey eatery</a> the dreaded &quot;Grade Pending&quot; status. The violation number puts the restaurant firmly at a &quot;C&quot; rating; they&apos;ll have another opportunity to score higher on a subsequent inspection.</p>

<p>Of the seven citations, five were deemed &quot;critical&quot; by the agency, including no hand washing facility in the food prep area, tobacco use, eating or drinking in the food prep area; and food held at improper temperatures. The latter violation could refer to the restaurant&apos;s sous-vide station, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508162312/http://ny.eater.com/archives/2014/03/new_yorks_finest_restaurant_has_a_grade_pending.php">notes Eater</a>.  </p>

<p>This is the third time the restaurant has been given a score over 40 points, including one in December of last year.
