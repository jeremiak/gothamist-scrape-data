<p>While we <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130808012036/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/04/photos_ramen_burgers_with_secret_sa.php#photo-1">clamored for the latest burger innovation</a>, the next <em>next</em> burger innovation had its first taste testing across the pond. The world&apos;s first test tube burger was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130808012036/http://www.businessinsider.com/first-ever-public-tasting-of-cultured-beef-burger-in-london-2013-8?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+typepad%2Falleyinsider%2Fsilicon_alley_insider+%28Silicon+Alley+Insider%29">cooked and served</a> in London today over a year after the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130808012036/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/20/open_wide_for_test_tube_hamburgers.php">food innovation was announced</a>. Author Josh Schonwald and nutrition scientist Hanni R&#xFC;tzler got first bites of the so-called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130808012036/http://culturedbeef.net/">&quot;Cultured Beef,&quot;</a> as cooked up by Cornwall chef Richard McGeown. The verdict? It doesn&apos;t quite taste like the real thing.</p>

<p>&quot;It&apos;s somewhere on the&#xA0;continuum between a Boca burger and a McDonald&apos;s burger,&quot; Schonwald reported. R&#xFC;tzler conceded that it tasted &quot;close&quot; to meat and both agreed that the texture was just about spot on. Without the fat found in traditionally slaughtered beef, the &quot;burgers&quot; don&apos;t have much in the way of flavor, but scientists say it&apos;s possible to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130808012036/http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2013/08/stem_cell_burger.html#incart_more_business">grow fat stem cells</a> to compensate. For today&apos;s taste test, red beet juice and saffron were added to give the patty more eye appeal and salt, egg powder and breadcrumbs were added for texture and flavor.</p>

<p>It took nearly 20,000 strands of meat to create the 5-ounce patty, which was grown from cow muscle stem cells inside a &quot;nutrient solution.&quot; The project cost about $332,000, which was partially funded by Google co-founder <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130808012036/http://gothamist.com/tags/sergeybrin">Sergey Brin</a>, who appeared in a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130808012036/http://culturedbeef.net/event/">promotional video</a> wearing&#x2014;what else&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130808012036/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/21/photo_google_co-founder_sports_proj.php">Google Glass</a>. PETA has also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130808012036/http://blog.peta.org.uk/2013/08/in-vitro-meat-the-future-of-food/">come out in support</a> of the project.</p>

<p>Don&apos;t expect to throw some stem cell-derived burgers on the grill anytime soon, as project leader Mark Post estimates <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130808012036/https://twitter.com/CulturedBeef/status/364360561338748928">10 to 20 years</a> before they&apos;ll be available on the general market. </p>
