<p>The Health Department apparently ruined the lives of an unknown number of New Yorkers yesterday when it ordered Chick-fil-A&apos;s second Midtown location to close. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171015135949/http://nypost.com/2017/02/15/nyc-shut-down-a-chick-fil-a-and-people-lost-their-minds/">NY Post broke news</a> of the chicken chain&apos;s shutter, in an article so packed with hyperbolic quotes that it borders on parody. If you ever wondered where the city&apos;s most melodramatic people eat lunch, it&apos;s the Chick-fil-A at 46th and 6th Avenue.</p>

<p>From the Post:</p>

<blockquote>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m dying!&#x201D; screamed Philip M., 31, of Chelsea. &#x2018;&#x201D;What am I going to do?! I am really upset &#x2026; I love the chicken sandwich.&#x201D;</blockquote>

<p>Dying, a screaming Philip proceeded to tear out all of his hair and ran home to light candles made from fryer grease in a makeshift fried chicken shrine inside his apartment. In the incredibly dark and near-fatal hours that followed, sources say Philip ultimately realized he could live his best life <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171015135949/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/04/bad_chicken_protesters_picket_outsi.php#photo-1"><em>devoted to a better chain</em></a>.</p>

<p>The source of yesterday&apos;s snafu wasn&apos;t <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171015135949/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/07/nycs_chick-fil-a_displays_c_grade_f.php">the result of any inspection</a>, rather the restaurant had been &quot;operating with a denied permit,&quot; according to the city. The issue was said to be resolved as of yesterday, but nobody answered the phone at the restaurant this morning and we were left with just a jaunty ear worm from Chick-fil-A&apos;s hold music.</p>

<p>This is the second major run-in the chicken chain&apos;s had with the Health Department. Last January, the other 6th Avenue location was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171015135949/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/03/chick-fil-a_closed_doh.php">closed by the DOH</a> for several major health code violations. Naturally, people went <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171015135949/https://twitter.com/DanielMims/status/682262932386897920?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">a little mad</a>. </p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> A rep for the restaurant tells us that everything will be back up and running today at 11 a.m.</p>
