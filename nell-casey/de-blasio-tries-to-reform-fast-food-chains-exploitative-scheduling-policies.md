In the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022140256/http://gothamist.com/tags/fightfor15">next step</a> towards making life bearable for the city&apos;s fleet of fast food workers, Mayor de Blasio will push legislation that should help curb the wildly unpredictable schedules of the 65,000 hourly workers in NYC. Yesterday in front of a Brooklyn McDonald&apos;s, the mayor announced the Fair Workweek legislation, which would require employers to release employee schedules a minimum of two weeks in advance. <p></p>

<p>&quot;Too many New Yorkers are being put in untenable situations&#x2014;taking care of kids and aging parents, and then being forced to deal with an arbitrary schedule at a job where they still don&#x2019;t always make ends meet,&quot; the mayor said.</p>

<p>Unstable work schedules are one of the many ways that employers and management <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022140256/http://gothamist.com/2014/03/13/mcdonalds_workers_file_wage_theft_s.php">make life difficult</a> for workers in already low-paying fast food jobs. Workers are routinely asked to work last-minute shifts or have shifts removed from their schedules without notice. This practice, along with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022140256/http://gothamist.com/2014/04/01/mcdonalds_managers_admit_to_stealin.php">tampering with time sheets</a>, are just a few examples of rampant wage theft and instability in the industry.</p>

<p>The legislation, which de Blasio intends to draft with the City Council, is expected to include the following changes, according a statement from the administration:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Require fast food employers to schedule a majority of expected shifts and publicly post a workplace schedule two weeks in advance.</li>
	<li>Protect workers by requiring employers to provide additional compensation when workers are required to accommodate last-minute changes to their schedules for reasons within employers&#x2019; ability to plan or control.</li>
	<li>Address problems created by the practice of &#x201C;clopenings,&#x201D; or shifts that require employees to consecutively work closing and opening shifts with fewer than ten hours between them.</li>
</ul>

<p>&quot;Think about the fact that these companies&#x2014;we&apos;re talking about some of the biggest corporations in America&#x2014;McDonald&apos;s, KFC, so many others&#x2014;some of the most profitable corporations in America, are led by some of the best compensated CEOs in America,&quot; the mayor asked of the crowd. &quot;Now, I remind you, those corporations couldn&apos;t survive without their workers. Those wealthy CEOs would be nowhere but for the people who do the work every day.&quot;</p>

<p>A reminder: McDonald&apos;s CEO Donald Thompson gets paid $13.7 million per year to hawk <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022140256/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/13/the_disgusting_depressing_truth_beh.php">&quot;edible&quot; dish sponges</a> while his employees <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022140256/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/24/mcdonalds_advice_to_underpaid_worke.php">sign up for food stamps</a>.</p>
