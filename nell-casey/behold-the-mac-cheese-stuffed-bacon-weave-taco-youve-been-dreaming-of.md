<p>It&apos;s difficult to be shocked in a world where <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504004909/http://gothamist.com/2014/02/24/taco_bell_bursts_onto_fast_food_bre.php#photo-1">Waffle Tacos</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504004909/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/03/behold_the_dunkin_donuts_glazed_don.php">Doughnut Sandwiches</a> are mainstream enough to show up on fast food menus. But the latest creation from evil genius Nick Chipman over at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504004909/http://dudefoods.com/">Dude Foods</a> was insane enough to give this henceforth unflappable food blogger heart attack by proxy. Class, please give a warm welcome to the Double Decker Mac &amp; Cheese Stuffed Bacon Weave Taco.</p>

<p>This madness was apparently created when a local news show stopped by Nick&apos;s Milwaukee digs to see how he came up with his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504004909/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/09/chicken_and_waffles_become_more_int.php">mind-altering dishes</a>. For this experiment, he started with a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504004909/http://dudefoods.com/bacon-weave-taco/">Bacon Weave Taco</a> then added a larger, mac &amp; cheese-stuffed bacon weave taco shell around the first taco. Apparently it&apos;s &quot;amazing.&quot; I wouldn&apos;t <me>not try it&#x2014;just sayin&apos;! </me></p>

<p>For his part, Nick concedes he has &quot;no idea&quot; where he can go from here. Once you&apos;ve stuffed a taco into bacon and stuffed that bacon taco into a mac &amp; cheese bacon taco there&apos;s not much else to do but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504004909/http://gothamist.com/2014/02/06/deep_dish_pizza_nyc.php">stuff it in a deep dish pizza</a> and deep fry it. That tip&apos;s for free, Nick! </p>
