										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="111814brodo1.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170119051623im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_nellcasey/111814brodo1.jpg" width="640" height="427"> <br> <i> <span class="photo_caption">Chicken (L), Hearth (R) (Nell Casey/Gothamist)</span></i></div> <p></p>

<p>It&apos;s been two years since &quot;bone broth&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170119051623/http://gothamist.com/2014/10/31/east_village_broth_window.php">became a thing</a> in NYC and, improbably, there&apos;s no osteoporosis in this trend. Brodo&#x2014;&quot;stock&quot; to people who know food terminology&#x2014;isn&apos;t a new concept, but chef Marco Canora of the West Village restaurant Hearth, put the technique on the map. Even <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170119051623/https://jet.com/product/detail/7e5b18f0a20f40c5a0d97d7cd073b88f?jcmp=pla:ggl:a_jd_cons_gen_food_beverages_tobacco_a3_b1:food_items_soups_broths_a3_other:na:PLA_648191734_39624881824_pla-154151906700:na:na:na:2&amp;code=PLA15&amp;gclid=CNjW0MH3ltACFUG8NwodRZAPuQ&amp;gclsrc=ds">cartons of mass-produced chicken stock</a> are being rebranded as bone broth nowadays. </p>

<p>Still, there&apos;s enduring confusion about what Canora&apos;s offering, and with a new West Village shop opening this week, he&apos;s hoping to dispel some misconceptions. &quot;If one more person says, &apos;Oh, it&apos;s soup,&apos; I&apos;m going to chew their face off,&quot; Canora <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170119051623/http://www.grubstreet.com/2016/11/marco-canoras-brodo-broth-shop-opens-in-west-village.html?mid=full-rss-grubstreet">confided to Grub Street</a>.</p>

<p>Whereas the original East Village window and the Bryant Park kiosk are both take out operations, the new, larger shop seems more in line with a cafe. There, Canora&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170119051623/http://images.nymag.com/images/2/daily/2016/11/Brodo_NYMag.pdf">introducing</a> brodo whipped up with fats like grass-fed ghee (clarified butter) and bone marrow. &quot;It&#x2019;s incredibly like a cappuccino,&quot; Canora explains. Grub Street&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170119051623/http://www.grubstreet.com/2016/11/marco-canoras-brodo-broth-shop-opens-in-west-village.html?mid=full-rss-grubstreet">glamor shots</a> of the hot beverages do look shockingly like what&apos;s being frothed up at high end coffee shops.</p>

<p>Our initial evaluation of Brodo&apos;s offerings <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170119051623/http://gothamist.com/2014/11/18/wtf_bone_broth.php">was mixed</a>, but a meat cappuccino bears revisiting. </p>
