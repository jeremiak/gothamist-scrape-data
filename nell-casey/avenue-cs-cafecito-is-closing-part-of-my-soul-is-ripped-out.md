<p>Well, this sucks. It appears that Avenue C Cuban restaurant Cafecito is closing and another part of my formative NYC years is dead. A staffer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160605044340/http://evgrieve.com/2016/01/cafecito-closes-sunday-on-avenue-c.html">confirmed to EV Grieve</a> that the restaurant will shutter after service on Sunday evening. There&apos;s going to be a party for friends and fans at 9 p.m. on Sunday evening to send the restaurant off in style. Add it to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160605044340/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/29/nyc_changes_ya_know.php">the list</a>.</p>

<p>As EV Grieve notes, the restaurant was badly damaged during Hurricane Sandy, covered in &quot;over four feet of water in the building&quot; and the restaurant remained closed for nearly a month. A source reported business hadn&apos;t been great and said the team didn&apos;t want to see the restaurant &quot;dwindling into another solemn East Village story,&quot; which is the most depressing sentence ever uttered. Apparently there&apos;s someone already interested in the space. Ugh.</p>

<p>When I was a regular in late 2005 and 2006, the place was packed on a nightly basis, which usually led to a pitcher of their tasty white sangria while waiting for a table to open up. Dinner conversations with my then-boyfriend would often end with &quot;Cubano at Cafecito?&quot; without any argument from either side. It was even a destination during the blizzard of 2015, a beacon of light, warmth and belly-filling Pollo Cafecito in the storm. </p>

<p>Recently I went back after many years&apos; absence and found <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160605044340/http://gothamist.com/2015/02/27/cafecito_cuban_still_got_it.php">everything in its right place</a>. I wish I&apos;d gone more often, feel guilty that I was perhaps part of the problem for not returning sooner and more often. Hug your darlings while you can.</p>
