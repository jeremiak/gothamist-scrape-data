<p>The makers of that handy <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430045133/http://gothamist.com/2014/02/05/coffee_map.php">coffee shop subway map</a> have updated and expanded their original offering to include western Queens and northwestern Brooklyn. Butterfruit labs <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430045133/http://www.reddit.com/r/nyc/comments/1xsvli/coffee_map_now_updated_with_brooklyn_and_queens/">put out the update</a> this morning, extending their caffeine coverage to include trendy neighborhoods like Williamsburg, Long Island City, Park Slope and Fort Greene.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430045133/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/08/dumbo_buzzing_from_newly_opened_bro.php#photo-1">Brooklyn Roasting Company</a> makes the grade over in DUMBO while Toby&apos;s Estate caffeinates you off the Bedford L. The Queens Kickshaw keeps you buzzed by the 46th Street stop in Astoria and Mama&apos;s Backyard is where to get cappuccino and cannoli in Corona. Starbucks sneaks in at the Atlantic-Pacific hub, which sadly appears to be the best bet for the area, so enterprising baristas take note!</p>

<p>The map also switches up some of its earlier Manhattan picks, including taking my advice about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430045133/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/04/coffee_craft_beer_and_character_at.php">DTUT</a> off the 6 train in Yorkville and ditching Starbucks and adding Grinis Bakery and La Nomade at the end of the 3 line in Harlem. The map now also notes which coffee shops offer Wi-Fi, an important detail for nomadic laptop users.</p>
