<p><strong>[Update Below]</strong> There&apos;s a new protein on offer at Pret A Manger but it&apos;s only available as a surprise extra! Meet Little Hoppy, the mournful-looking frog that made a guest appearance in the salad of a Wall Street Journal employee this afternoon at the Sixth Avenue/47th Street location of the chain. Digital Features Editor Kathryn Lurie <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429132209/https://twitter.com/kathrynlurie/status/417756292438978560">Tweeted a photo</a> of the little guy nestled amongst some Mesclun leaves in what appears to be an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429132209/http://www.pret.com/us/menu/salads/albacore_tuna_nicoise_salad_PUS1509.shtm">Albacore Tuna Nicoise Salad</a>. Frogs in the salad&#x2014;how French!</p>

<p>Lurie says a co-worker discovered the green guy in her greens (here&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429132209/http://www.kennethinthe212.com/2013/12/frog-in-your-throat.html#.UsHjE46DtO4.twitter">another angle</a>) and was &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429132209/https://twitter.com/kathrynlurie/status/417763084837482496">pretty shaken</a>&quot; by the incident. Obviously the unexpected addition came as a surprise but just imagine how the frog felt! We like to imagine he&apos;s just having a little snooze amongst the greenery, as frogs are wont to do. </p>

<p>The old <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429132209/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/24/frog-in-salad-bag-walmart_n_2010923.html">frog</a> in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429132209/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/live-frog-lettuce-stuns-mom-article-1.340896">salad</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429132209/http://gothamist.com/2008/01/24/frog_found_in_c.php">bag</a> has happened before but you&apos;d think someone would notice the stray critter while, say, washing the greens or tossing the salad to order. We reached out to Pret A Manger for comment about this exciting new salad addition and we&apos;ll update when we hear back. There&apos;s no official verification that this adorable amphibian actually had a guest spot over lunch today, but if it&apos;s hoax then we&apos;ve lost all faith in the credibility of the WSJ.</p>

<p>This is why we don&apos;t eat salads.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> A rep for Pret A Manger gave us the following statement: </p>

<blockquote>&quot;At Pret  A Manger, we take issues like this very seriously. Our lettuce is sourced from farms that do not use any pesticides on its produce, therefore organic matter does very rarely manage to pass through our production process. We are currently looking into this issue to make every effort that this does not happen again.&quot;</blockquote>
