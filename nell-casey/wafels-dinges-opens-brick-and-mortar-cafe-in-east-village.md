<p>Perennially popular Belgian food truck <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507073718/http://www.wafelsanddinges.com/">Wafels &amp; Dinges</a> has laid down roots in the East Village, opening their first stationary cafe on 2nd Street just north of Houston. The cafe follows the current road-to-area-code trend, like the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507073718/http://morrisgrilledcheese.com/">Morris Truck&apos;s</a> restaurant outpost <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507073718/http://gladysnyc.com/">Glady&apos;s</a> that opened earlier this year. The cafe opened earlier this week, serving up their sweet and savory wafel creations as well as an espresso and coffee bar menu with beans from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507073718/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/08/dumbo_buzzing_from_newly_opened_bro.php">Brooklyn Roasting Company</a>. </p>

<p>The expanded wafel menu includes &quot;brunch&quot; options like the &quot;Wake Up, Grumpy,&quot; a Wafel-biscuit with egg, bacon and cheese and &quot;De Bastogne Wafel&quot; from the Belgian Ardennes, made from potato and topped with sour cream and prune &quot;sirop de liege.&quot; As with the trucks, custom &quot;dinges&quot; like dulce de leche, Nutella and whipped cream can be added atop the crispy Brussles wafel or chewy Li&#xE8;ge variety. They&apos;ll also whip up ice cream shakes and &quot;coupes&quot; (sundaes), using all natural products from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507073718/http://www.montblancdessert.com/">Mont Blanc Desserts</a>.</p>

<p>The cafe opens daily at 7 a.m. for a pre-work pick me up or an early brunch on the weekends. Sunday through Wednesday the irons cool off at 10 p.m with expanded hours until 1 a.m Thursday through Saturday. We see many post-imbibing wafels in our future.</p>

<p><em>209 East 2nd Street // (866) 429-7329</em></p>
