<p><strong>[Update Below]</strong> Biscuits with butter, biscuits with gravy, biscuits with chicken, oh biscuits please save me (...from my hangover). That&apos;s not the real tagline for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504120726/http://www.empirebiscuit.com/">Empire Biscuit</a>, a new biscuit-focused shop in the East Village, but it could be. However you top them or fill them, buttery biscuits are the universe&apos;s way of telling you everything&apos;s going to be alright and this new Avenue A eatery knows that comfort doesn&apos;t keep business hours.</p>

<p>The new single-focus shop opened yesterday between 12th and 13th Streets, with plans to keep the place open 24/7 for the late-night set and the desperately hungover. First up: biscuit sandwiches, filled with breakfasty items like Benton&apos;s bacon, egg and cheddar ($6) and the bizarre/awesome Scotch Egg with cheddar and whole grain mustard ($8.50). They&apos;re also doing biscuits and gravy, of course, but instead of the knife-and-fork deal common below the Mason Dixon, they&apos;re stuffing sausage, redeye and vegetarian gravies between two halves of biscuit, creating a messy but satisfying sandwich.</p>

<p>The custom butters, spreads, jams and marmalades are where things really get exciting, with dozens of different decadent things to coat either a Country Style (<em>laaaaaard</em>) or All Butter biscuit. They&apos;ve got some pre-tested combos on the menu like The Fancy Pants (foie gras butter with preserved lemon and cabbage jam) and The Kiki (chocolate and caraway butter with coffee jelly), but here&apos;s where your stoned mind can really flourish. Face Cheese with Plume, Prune &amp; Port Jam? Sure why not. Creole Cream Cheese with Oxtail &amp; Brown Sugar Jelly? No judgements here! </p>

<p><strong>[UPDATE]</strong> The shop dangled their flaky treats to the &apos;hood yesterday and took today off to recuperate but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504120726/https://twitter.com/empirebiscuit/status/395718575472005120"><strike>come 8 a.m. tomorrow</strike></a> on Sunday from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m. and then starting Tuesday 8 a.m. you can get your biscuit fix whenever you damn well please.</p>
