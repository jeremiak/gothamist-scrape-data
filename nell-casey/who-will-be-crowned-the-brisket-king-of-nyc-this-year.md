<p>Texas barbecue authorities will be in town this month to anoint NYC&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170405001808/http://brisketkingnyc.com/">Brisket King</a>, when the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170405001808/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/02/brisket_king_2016.php">annual event</a> comes to Brooklyn on April 19th. Set to coincide with &quot;Brooklyn Brisket Day&quot;&#x2014;a new official holiday put on the calendar by Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams&#x2014;the competition pits 25 chefs against one another to win the throne&#x2014;the rest of us just get to eat and drink. Not a bad deal.</p>

<p>Some of the city&apos;s best barbecue joints are participating&#x2014;including Blue Smoke, Dinosaur BBQ and Mighty Quinn&apos;s, which will all likely be bringing their own proprietary smoked meats&#x2014;but there are some non-barbecue folks throwing their briskets into the smoker. Italian restaurant <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170405001808/http://www.ornellatrattoria.com/index.html">Ornella Trattoria</a> will be making Rollata di Punta di Petto (brisket) with mortadella, eggs, fontina cheese and spinach. It&apos;s a dish Chef Giuseppe Viterale makes regularly for his family at home.</p>

<p>Excellent Prospect Heights Mexican restaurant <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170405001808/http://www.elatoraderobrooklyn.com/">El Atoradero</a> will also be competing, most likely with Tacos de Suadero, a beef-filled taco common in Mexico City. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170405001808/https://plantlovehouse.wixsite.com/thai">Look By Plant Love House</a> plans to prepare Brisket Laab, a spicy Thai salad with roasted rice powder, shallot, mints and cilantro.</p>

<p>Founder Jimmy Carbone scored some pretty sweet judges for this year, including Daniel Vaughn, the Barbecue Editor of <em>Texas Monthly</em>, and Aaron Franklin, the owner of Franklin Barbecue&#x2014;that place in Austin that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170405001808/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/14/dining/franklin-barbecue-review.html">everybody freaks out about</a>.</p>

<p>Tickets for the event are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170405001808/http://brisketkingnyc.com/tickets/">on sale now</a> and run between $75 and a super special $1,000 option if you want a private table. The event will take place at the Food Science Academy of LIU Brooklyn (1 University Plaza, enter at corner of Flatbush and DeKalb) from 6 p.m. to 9:30 p.m.</p>
