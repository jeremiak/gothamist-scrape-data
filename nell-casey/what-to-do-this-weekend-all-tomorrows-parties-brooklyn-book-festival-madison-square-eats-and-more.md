<p>After announcing earlier this summer that it would be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505144715/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/13/atp_festival.php">moving to Manhattan</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505144715/http://www.atpfestival.com/events/ibymusa2012.php"><strong>All Tomorrow&apos;s Parties</strong></a> makes its landing on the East River&apos;s Pier 36 this weekend. The London-based organization, helmed by Barry Hogan, has been promoting musically-inclined events across the globe for the last decade, and in recent years has hosted their annual U.S. festival in the Catskills and Asbury Park, NJ. Each year ATP selects a new musician to curate the event, and this year <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505144715/http://gothamist.com/2012/09/12/greg_dulli.php">Greg Dulli of the Afghan Whigs</a> puts his unique spin on the proceedings with a show entitled <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505144715/http://vimeo.com/48465393">&quot;I&apos;ll Be Your Mirror.&quot;</a></p>

<p>The Whigs will perform, of course, and are joined by headliners <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505144715/http://gothamist.com/tags/frankocean">Frank Ocean</a>, Philip Glass &amp; Tyondai Braxton, Janeane Garofalo, The Roots and Godspeed You! Black Emperor. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505144715/http://www.atpfestival.com/newsview/1207131501.php">Many more</a> acts will perform over the three day festival, with more bands, comedy and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505144715/http://www.atpfestival.com/assets/film12/films2012.html">free screenings from the Criterion Collection</a> aboard the Queen of Hearts paddle steamer. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505144715/http://www.atpfestival.com/events/ibymusa2012/tickets.php">Tickets</a> cost $199 for the weekend or $60 and $75 for single-day passes.</p>

<p><em>Also this weekend:</em></p>

<p>Brooklyn&apos;s Borough Hall gets a literary transformation at the annual <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505144715/http://www.brooklynbookfestival.org/BBF/Home"><strong>Brooklyn Book Festival</strong></a>, which unites authors, vendors and bibliophiles for a day-long celebration of literature. This year&apos;s author lineup gives us luminaries such as Joyce Carol Oates, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505144715/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/18/colson_whitehead_on_manhattan_being.php">Colson Whitehead</a>, Mary Higgins Clark and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505144715/http://www.visitbrooklyn.org/BBF/Authors">many, many others</a>. Expect lots of readings, talkbacks and signings by the authors and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505144715/http://www.brooklynbookfestival.org/BBF/Vendors">loads of vendors</a> to help you stock up on reading material for the winter.</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="092112newsletter2.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505144715im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_nellcasey/092112newsletter2.jpg" width="300" height="225" class="image-right"> </span>Just because the weather is getting cooler doesn&apos;t mean you can&apos;t enjoy the great outdoors and score some delicious treats while you&apos;re at it. Throw on a sweater and head to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505144715/http://www.madparknews.com/madison-square-park-restaurants/madison-square-eats-fall-2012-food-stands-start-up-friday-september-21st/"><strong>Madison Square Eats</strong></a> today in the Worth Square section of the park for slew of delicious delicacies from restaurants and food trucks around town. Devour pizza from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505144715/http://robertaspizza.com/">Roberta&apos;s</a>, ice cream sandwiches from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505144715/http://meltbakery.com/">Melt Bakery</a> or meatballs from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505144715/http://mightyballs.com/">Mighty Balls</a>. All told, almost 30 vendors will set up each Friday from 11 a.m to 9 p.m. through October 19th.  </p>

<p>Elegant yet boisterous <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505144715/http://gothamist.com/2009/07/06/aureole.php#photo-1">midtown restaurant Aureole</a>, located just off Bryant Park, is throwing an <strong>&quot;oyster social&quot;</strong> on Sunday to raise money for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505144715/http://www.citymeals.org/">Citymeals-on-Wheels</a>, which delivers food to homebound elderly New Yorkers. It costs $75 to get in, but once you&apos;re through the doors you can, uh, <em>socialize</em> with a limitless pile of oysters, hors d&apos;ouerves, and booze for four hours. (Beverages include New Zealand Fine Wines, Purity Vodka Bloody Marys, beer from Sierra Nevada and Louis Roederer champagne.) Considering how much you&apos;d spend drinking and slurping oysters for four hours at market prices -- even at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505144715/http://gothamist.com/2012/09/20/six_solid_1_oyster_happy_hours_to_s.php">one of our recommended dollar oyster happy hours</a> -- $75 is a bargain. And it&apos;s for charity. Do it for the charity. <em>12 p.m. - 4 p.m., call (212) 319-1660 or email AureoleEvents@charliepalmer.com for reservations; or pay $85 at the door.</em></p>
