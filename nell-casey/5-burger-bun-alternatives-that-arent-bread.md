title: 5 Burger Bun Alternatives That Aren't Bread
---

	
										<p><em>It&apos;s almost Labor Day weekend, meaning time to get the grill out for one more turn around the dance floor before the end of the summer season. Burgers are a staple of any grilling session, but if you don&apos;t eat bread you&apos;re faced with either knife-and-forking a meat patty or hoping against all odds that your makeshift pieces of lettuce won&apos;t rip before you&apos;re done tearing into your meal. Whether you&apos;re attempting the trendy Paleo diet, have a sensitivity to gluten or are just trying to cut down on the bulk, here are a few bread-free alternatives for the last weekend grilling of the summer.</em></p>

<p><strong>TOMATOES</strong> Juicy, sweet and an emblem of summer, tomatoes also make flavorful&#x2014;albeit messy&#x2014;substitutions for a traditional bun. This recipe from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429214312/http://www.theironyou.com/2013/08/tomato-avocado-burgers-low-carb-and.html">The Iron You</a> calls for pan searing seedless tomato halves until slightly browned, a process that firms up the fruit and adds a touch of caramelized flavor.</p>

<p>Cut the tomatoes in half horizontally. With the handle-end of a spoon or a fork, scoop out the seeds and seeds membrane. Set aside. Lightly grease with olive oil a medium non-stick pan/skillet and heat over medium-high heat. Cook halved tomatoes face down for 2 to 3 minutes, until they begin to brown. Flip and cook for 20 seconds on the other side so that they get a bit of color. </p>

<p><strong>MUSHROOMS</strong> Specifically, large portobello mushroom caps, which are large and sturdy enough to enclose a burger with all the fixins&#x2014;they also mimic the texture of a bun pretty well. Mushrooms are often a substitute for the meat-free set and they work equally well as an alternative to bread if you&apos;re looking to cut carbs or have a sensitivity to gluten.</p>

<p>Clean mushroom caps with a damp cloth to remove any dirt and cut off the woody stem. Drizzle each cap with olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Grill on each side for 3-5 minutes or until tender.</p>

<p><strong>Sweet Potatoes</strong> The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429214312/http://gothamist.com/tags/ramenburger">ramen burger</a> technically isn&apos;t bread but it&apos;s definitely not a healthy option to hold your burger. Instead, try a spiralized sweet potato using this recipe from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429214312/http://www.inspiralized.com/2013/08/23/recipe-spiralized-sandwich-bun/">Inspiralized</a>, which puts the vitamin-packed tater through the ringer (literally) to form it into a noodle shape. If you don&apos;t have fancy equipment, use a mandoline or julienne the potato; it won&apos;t be exactly the same, but close enough for government work.</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="082713eggplant.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429214312im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_nellcasey/082713eggplant.jpg" width="640" height="427"> <br> <i> <span class="photo_caption">(<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429214312/http://www.shutterstock.com/gallery-929752p1.html">Lestertair</a>/<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429214312/http://www.shutterstock.com/">Shutterstock</a>)</span></i></div> <p></p>

<p><strong>EGGPLANT</strong> When grilled, eggplant softens and develops a slightly sweet, nutty flavor. Cut thick rounds of the veggie, season with salt, pepper, olive oil and garlic powder and grill until it develops nice char marks. Since eggplant has a tendency to get a little mushy, top your burger with raw onion, crunchy bacon and lots of crisp lettuce to give it some texture. </p>

<p><strong>BACON</strong> Instead of settling for a few measly strips atop your burger why not put the good stuff front and center. It takes a bit of artistry, but the bacon weave from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429214312/http://www.epicmealtime.com/2012/12/18/how-to-make-a-bacon-weave/">Epic Meal Time</a> tastes delicious and makes a statement about your commitment to extreme burgers. You&apos;re essentially weaving together bacon strips, baking off the resulting creation in the oven until just shy of well done, then cutting into squares. Bottom line: bacon. </p>

<p>You can also pan fry your bacon weave per the video below:</p>
