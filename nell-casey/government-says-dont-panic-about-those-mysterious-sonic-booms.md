<p>At this time, earthquake rumors have been debunked and the likely culprit identified as a sonic boom.</p>

<p>The New York City Emergency Management confirmed that neither the US Geological Survey nor the Earth Observatory at Columbia University have &quot;identified any seismic activity at this time.&quot; The boom appears to have originated in the town of Hammonton, New Jersey and there&apos;s speculation it was caused by a military aircraft of some kind in the vicinity.</p>
