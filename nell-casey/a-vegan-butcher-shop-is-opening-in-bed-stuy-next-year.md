<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170721200806/http://www.monksmeats.com/">Monk&apos;s Meats</a>, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170721200806/http://gothamist.com/2016/09/06/vendys_vegan_contenders.php#photo-6">vegan operation</a> that&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170721200806/http://gothamist.com/2016/08/09/vegan_bbq_nyc.php">taking the meat out</a> of BBQ, has announced the opening of a forthcoming vegan &quot;butcher&quot; shop opening in Bed-Stuy next spring. The &quot;vegetarian butcher shop and delicatessen&quot; completed a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170721200806/https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/763839181/monks-vegan-delicatessen-and-kitchen">successful Kickstarter campaign</a> to open a shop at 477 Gates Avenue to sell  steaks, burgers, sausages and &quot;vegan options you would expect to find in a meat shop,&quot; co-founder Chris Kim <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170721200806/https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20161205/bed-stuy/seitan-brooklyn-vegan-food-bed-stuy">told DNAinfo</a>.</p>

<p>Monk&apos;s has been a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170721200806/http://gothamist.com/2016/08/09/vegan_bbq_nyc.php">popular stand at Smorgasburg</a> since they debuted there in 2013, making their own seitan&#x2014;a wheat-based protein&#x2014;and eventually smoking it to evolve into their Monk&apos;s Vegan Smokehouse operation.</p>

<p>Don&apos;t expect this shop to sit around and eat their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170721200806/http://gothamist.com/2016/09/19/vendy_award_winners_2016.php#photo-10">award-winning sliders</a>, however, as it&apos;ll be a strictly take-out operation of the sandwiches, vegan meats, cheese and pickles, all made on-site.</p>

<p>&quot;We&apos;d love to be able to open a vegan BBQ joint somewhere down the line and offer a wider range of BBQ fare, with more proteins and lots of sides,&quot; Kim told Gothamist in August. </p>
