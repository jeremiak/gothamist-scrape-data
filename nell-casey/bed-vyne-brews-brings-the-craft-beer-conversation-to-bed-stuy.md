</div></div>					<p>Nearly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430033810/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/07/bed-stuy_food_tour.php#photo-8">two years after opening</a> their successful wine shop in Bedford-Stuyvesant, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430033810/http://www.bed-vyne.com/home.html">Bed-Vyne Wine</a> has expanded next door, opening an intimate craft beer bar and retail outlet. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430033810/https://twitter.com/bedvynebrew">Bed-Vyne Brews</a> opened just over a week ago, with a thoughtfully chosen menu of 10 draft beers and a selection of wines from the neighboring shop. Like the wine shop, this is the first establishment of its kind in the neighborhood, and proprietor Michael Brooks is hoping it will open up the conversation about craft beer among locals.</p>

<p>Brews aren&apos;t limited to the local variety, with options from Scotland (Belhaven Twisted Thistle IPA), Wisconsin (Stevens Point Special Lager) and Germany (Innstadt Neues Helles) on tap, though an Ithaca and a Southampton are both on the menu as well. Bed-Vyne continues its retail tradition by offering Growlers to-go ($12-$30) of any of their tap beers, with the option to buy individual bottles rolling out in the coming weeks. The bar also offers wine, naturally, with glasses of red, white, rose and moscato priced between $6 and $8. Brooks tells us the beer and wine will change with the seasons, though most of the wines can still be procured by the bottle in the shop.</p>

<p>The small, cavern-like space offers seating for a few on vintage stools or at one of the huge wooden beams salvaged from an old barn in the Catskills. The outdoor stools and benches were already in use on the warm evening during our visit, with imbibers enjoying not just a glass of beer but also some organic fare from neighboring <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430033810/http://bush-doctor-juice-bar.blogspot.com/">Bush Doctor Juice Bar</a>. For now, patrons can order delivery of organic salmon burgers and the like, but Bed-Vyne is hoping to roll out charcuterie and other small bites in the coming months. </p>

<p>Besides food, the bar has plans to sponsor the Brooklyn Beer and Wine Festival on August 18th, which highlights local bars and restaurants. In the fall, look out for oyster parties, with bivalves shucked on the front deck and a special menu of beers and prosecco. Dedicated wine and beer months are also part of the plan&#x2014;where all the wines might be French for one month and then all Italian for the next&#x2014;as are rare Belgian beers, some of which have been aged in sake barrels, bourbon barrels and other unusual vessels. </p>

<p><em>370 Tompkins Avenue, Bed-Stuy // 347-915-1080 (wine shop) // Open Monday through Thursday, 4 p.m. to 12 a.m.; Friday 4 p.m. to 2 a.m.; Saturday noon to 2 a.m.; Sunday varied hours</em></p>
