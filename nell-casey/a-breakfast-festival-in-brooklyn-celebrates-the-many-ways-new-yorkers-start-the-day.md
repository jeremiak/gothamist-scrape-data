<p>BECs, egg tarts, croissants, avocado toasts and many of the other myriad ways New Yorkers celebrate the first meal of the day come to Industry City in June for the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170616021246/http://gothamist.com/2016/09/02/weekend_food_roundup_83.php">2nd</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170616021246/https://www.facebook.com/events/740098242859595/">BreakFestival</a>. Put on by the breakfast-focused website <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170616021246/http://www.extracrispy.com/culture/2726/the-extra-crispy-breakfestival-2017-is-coming-to-brooklyn">Extra Crispy</a>, the event promises a reason to rise early on a weekend&#x2014;but not <em>too</em> early: the event doesn&apos;t begin until noon.</p>

<p>There&apos;ll be pastries including Dough Doughnuts and treats from Colson Patisserie, toast-type things from Avocaderia and Claus Meyer&apos;s Great Northern Food Hall, breakfast pizza from Gristmill and Speedy Romeo, and Chinese breakfast items including Jianbing Company and Nom Wah. Other vendors include Atlantic Social, Seviche, White Moustache yogurt and charcuterie from Ends Meats. The full lineup isn&apos;t out just yet, but you can see other vendors <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170616021246/http://www.extracrispy.com/culture/2726/the-extra-crispy-breakfestival-2017-is-coming-to-brooklyn">here</a>.</p>

<p>Breakfast adjacent drinks are also part of the program, including coffee and Bloody Marys. Like many of our <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170616021246/http://gothamist.com/2017/01/22/morning_rave_midtown.php#photo-1">morning routines</a>, a DJ will be on hand for appetite-encouraging dancing. The festival, taking place on Saturday, June 10th, is free to attend (items are sold a la carte) and you can register <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170616021246/https://www.facebook.com/events/740098242859595/">here</a>.</p>
