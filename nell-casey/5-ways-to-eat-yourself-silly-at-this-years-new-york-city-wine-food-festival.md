title: 5 Ways To Eat Yourself Silly At This Year's New York City Wine & Food Festival
---

	
										<p><em>In just shy of two week&apos;s time, the city will be flooded with food talent from around the globe at the annual <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110082346/http://nycwff.org/">New York City Wine &amp; Food Festival</a>, the <em>Food Network</em>-powered event that&apos;s a whirlwind weekend for the city&apos;s food professionals and eating amateurs. For the cost of one swanky meal (and often less), we can eat a button-bursting amount of gourmet goodies prepared by the channel&apos;s talent, in addition to notable chefs, producers and other industry folks.</em></p>

<p><em>Some of the weekend&apos;s festivities have sold out, but there&apos;s still a solid lineup of events in which to blow through a week&apos;s calories in two hours.</em></p>

<p>If it&apos;s been ages since you visited <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110082346/http://gothamist.com/2015/11/10/guide_to_nyc_food_halls.php">NYC&apos;s OG food market</a>, swing by the <strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110082346/http://nycwff.org/chelsea-market-live/">Chelsea Market Live</a></strong> event that&apos;s a throwback for more reasons than one: it&apos;s hosted by Tia Mowry, Tiffani Thiessen and Haylie Duff (okay so not <em>all</em> throwback). The trio are emcees for the walk-around tasting&#x2014;fun fact: Food Network HQ is in the same building&#x2014;with stops at Mokbar, Li-Lac Chocolates, Doughnuttery, Takumi Taco, Dizengoff and Seed + Mill, among others. Don&apos;t worry: they&apos;re stopping at the booze shops, too.</p>

<p>There are two hallmark events at every NYCWFF but the <strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110082346/http://nycwff.org/grand-tasting-presented-by-shoprite/">Grand Tasting</a></strong> is the bigger, crazier, oh-my-god-I-can&apos;t-eat-anymore event that&apos;s not to be missed. There are GTs on both Saturday and Sunday, both of which boast 130,000-square-feet of gastronomic bliss, including tastings, drinkings, talkings, readings and just about every activity associated with food. Well, not <em>every</em>. </p>
