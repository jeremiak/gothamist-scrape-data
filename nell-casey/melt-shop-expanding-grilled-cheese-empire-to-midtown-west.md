<p>The evil cheese pushers at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151207040232/http://meltshop.com/">Melt Shop</a>, hellbent on expanding our waistlines, have opened a third location of their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151207040232/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/18/the_7_best_places_to_get_a_grilled.php">addictive grilled cheese</a> eatery. Strap on your comfort waist sweatpants worker drones, because they&apos;re coming to Midtown West 50th Street between 6th and 7th Avenues. </p>

<p>They&apos;ve changed up the menu from their previous incarnations in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151207040232/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/21/new_restaurant_and_bar_radar_45.php#photo-4">Midtown East</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151207040232/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/19/melt_shop_opens_second_grilled_chee.php#photo-2">Chelsea</a>, paring down the sizeable grilled cheese list and adding different types of melted sandwiches and even a few salads. Their Burger Melt ($8.96) sounds pretty bangin: their special patty blends gets smooshed between two slices of buttery white bread with aged cheddar, brick spread, pickles, caramelized onions and burger sauce. The Melt Shop Breakfast ($5.28) sounds like a true gut buster&#x2014;post-ingestion nap may be required!&#x2014;with scrambled eggs, sausage, American cheese, tots and melt sauce on griddled sourdough. </p>

<p>Anyone with the willpower to ignore the sweet, sweet scent of melted cheese and opt for a salad can choose between the Shop Salad ($9.64) with grilled chicken, arugula, goat cheese, roasted tomatoes, croutons and sherry vinaigrette; or the Kicken Chicken ($9.64), a decidedly less healthy but still delicious salad with buttermilk fried chicken, romaine hearts, carrots, croutons and blue cheese buffalo dressing. Reward your greens-minded choices with a side of loaded tots ($6.43) topped with cheese sauce, bacon, jalapenos, caramelized onions and Melt sauce. It&apos;s all about balance.</p>
