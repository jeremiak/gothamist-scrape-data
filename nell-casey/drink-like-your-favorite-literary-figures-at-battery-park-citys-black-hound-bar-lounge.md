</div></div>					<p>As of yesterday, Battery Park City has another late-night dining spot to wile away the winter hours, as Black Hound Bar &amp; Grill officially opened in the neighborhood. This is the second upscale restaurant to open in the hood this year after Danny Meyer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427134949/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/12/danny_meyer_floyd_cardozs_north_end.php#photo-1">opened North End Grill</a> a few blocks away on North End Avenue in January. Similar to Meyer&apos;s joint, Black Hound seeks to give the &quot;pub-laden neighborhood&quot; a classy option for cocktails&#x2014;curated here by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427134949/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/21/photos_the_mulberry_project.php">Mulberry Project</a> mixologist Jeremy Strawn&#x2014;and perhaps a bite or two to eat as well. </p>

<p>With its neutral metallic color palate and mirrored ceilings, the Black Hound gives off a bit of a hotel lobby vibe. But pops of blue on the swinging doors and trim, and a gorgeous grey marble-topped bar, heighten the space&apos;s eye appeal significantly. The high top tables in the front bar area are a nice place to sample one of chef Antelmo Ambrosio&apos;s &quot;gourmet&quot; bar bites like the Black Hound Surf &amp; Turf Burger (American Wagyu beef, lobster medallions, lemon pepper aioli, $19), Truffle Mac and Cheese ($13) and a variety of flat bread pizzas ($13-$14). Step through the saloon-style doors to the back room, which features large couches and wing back chairs, and offers a comfy oasis to sip one of Jeremy Strawn&apos;s inventive cocktails.</p>

<p>&quot;An intelligent man is sometimes forced to be drunk to spend time with fools,&quot; reads a Hemingway quotation printed on the menu, one of many nods to literary figures on the cocktail list. The drinks themselves are all named for famous authors and poets and include witticisms from each to accompany their namesake cocktails. The &quot;Curse of Lono&quot;&#x2014;named for the Hunter S. Thompson novel of the same name&#x2014;combines Pimm&apos;s No. 1 and prosecco with lemon, ginger, strawberry and mint and the George Bernard Shaw-inspired &quot;Pygmalion&quot; features Martin and Miller Gin, Lillet, Cointreau, lemon, grapefruit, Absinthe and lavender. If $14 cocktails aren&apos;t your style, opt for a glass of Malbec or a Brooklyn Sorachi Ace on draft.</p>

<p>The lounge opens daily at 4 p.m. until midnight on weekdays and 2 a.m. on Fridays and Saturdays. </p>
