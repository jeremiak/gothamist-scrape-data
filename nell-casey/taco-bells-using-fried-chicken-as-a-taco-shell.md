<p>Scrolling through the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170113144455/http://gothamist.com/tags/tacobell">Taco Bell</a> tag on Gothamist feels like revisiting a cherished family album. We beam with pride looking back at those <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170113144455/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/16/taco_bells_dorito_shell_is_coming_f.php">first precious steps</a> into stunt foods; hallmark moments that led to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170113144455/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/06/the_taco_bell_cool_ranch_doritos_lo.php">life-long habits</a>, as with all of our formative years. Then came testing the boundaries, sometimes <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170113144455/http://gothamist.com/2014/03/27/taco_bell_waffle_taco.php#photo-1">pushing too far</a>, but usually <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170113144455/http://gothamist.com/2014/06/06/quesarito_taco_bell.php">finding a happy balance</a> between respecting history and embracing a bold new future. We may not have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170113144455/https://www.buzzfeed.com/christianzamora/how-taco-bells-crunchwrap-supreme-saved-the-world?utm_term=.yy2VoEKXa#.bbDxdKAaP">been with you since birth</a>, but we stuck by you, Taco Bell, even though you <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170113144455/http://gothamist.com/2014/12/12/taco_bell_fritos.php">sometimes lie to us</a>.</p>

<p>And here we are with you now, on the eve of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170113144455/https://www.tacobell.com/news/taco-bell-exposes-the-naked-chicken-chalupa">Naked Chicken Chalupa</a>, which will be deployed nationwide on January 26th for $2.99. </p>

<p>This is a two-years-in-the-making menu item. &quot;The shell is made with four ounces of marinated, all-white-meat, antibiotic-free chicken kicked up with bold Mexican spices and seasoning, and is packed with fresh shredded lettuce, diced ripe tomatoes, cheddar cheese and creamy avocado ranch,&quot; reads Taco Bell&apos;s release on the new item. So: a school cafeteria fried chicken patty wrapped around a salad. Cool, cool. </p>

<p>Taco Bell&apos;s schtick, historically, has been to remix ingredients already on the menu to create a new item&#x2014;the Crunchwrap Supreme is a prime example of this. This feels more like aping fellow Yum Brand cohort KFC&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170113144455/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/12/kfc_double_down_hype_meets_reality.php">Double Down sandwich</a>. At least your newish <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170113144455/http://www.grubstreet.com/2016/11/taco-bell-introduces-queso.html">queso</a> is on brand.</p>

<p>&quot;Fried chicken is growing at a tremendous clip,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170113144455/http://gothamist.com/2015/09/01/nyc_chicken_lovers_guide.php">true words</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170113144455/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-01-11/taco-bell-joins-fried-chicken-fad-as-consumption-reaches-record">spoken by</a> Taco Bell President Brian Niccol. &quot;It&apos;s a real void on our menu, and it&apos;s something that our customers ask us for.&quot;</p>
