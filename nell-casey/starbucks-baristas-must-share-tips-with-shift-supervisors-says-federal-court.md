<p>Starbucks baristas must share their tips with shift supervisors, a federal appeals court ruled yesterday. The three-judge panel of the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals concluded that because Starbucks&apos; shift supervisors perform essentially the same functions as baristas&#x2014;serving customers food and beverages&#x2014;they were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501161401/http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/appeals-court-ny-sides-starbucks-tips-20964268">entitled to a portion of the shared tips</a>. Baristas in Queens <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501161401/http://gothamist.com/2008/04/04/new_york_state_1.php">brought a lawsuit</a> against the Seattle-based company in 2008, alleging that sharing tips with the supervisors violated a state law that prohibits management from sharing in employee tips. </p>

<p>Though technically given more responsibility than baristas, shift supervisors don&apos;t have authority that would allow them to fire an employee. &quot;Thus, while shift supervisors may be able to coach baristas, they cannot formally discipline them,&quot; the panel said. &quot;On this record, no fact finder could conclude that shift supervisors have such a &apos;substantial&apos; degree of &apos;managerial responsibility&apos; that they are no longer akin to &apos;general wait staff.&apos;&quot; This new ruling comes to the same conclusions as the New York Court of Appeals, which ruled <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501161401/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/26/starbucks_shift_supervisors_can_sha.php">in favor of tip sharing</a> earlier this year.</p>

<p>New York City baristas <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501161401/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/04/nyregion/04starbucks.html?_r=2&amp;ref=nyregion&amp;oref=slogin&amp;">revealed to the <em>Times</em></a> that $1.20 to $1.80 an hour was the amount each barista earned in tips during an average shift. Average salaries hover around $10 after three years for both baristas and shift supervisors, meaning that with tips employees at the coffee giant <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501161401/http://gothamist.com/tags/livingwage">earn a living wage</a>; but just barely. </p>
