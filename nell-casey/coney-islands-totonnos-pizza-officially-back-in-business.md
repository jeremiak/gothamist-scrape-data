<p>Absolutely fantastic news out of Coney Island this week: famed Neptune Avenue pizza parlor Totonno&apos;s is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509022720/http://newyork.grubstreet.com/2013/03/coney-island-totonnos-reopens.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+nymag%2Fgrubstreet+%28Grub+Street+-+nymag.com%27s+Food+and+Restaurant+Blog%29">back in business</a>! <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509022720/http://www.gothamist.com/tags/hurricanesandy">Hurricane Sandy</a> caused <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509022720/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/19/long_road_to_repair_for_hurricane_s.php">devastating flooding</a> to the pizzeria, which was struggling to come up with the hundreds of thousands of dollars to repair all the damage. </p>

<p>Back in February Totonno&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509022720/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/08/sandy-damaged_totonnos_pizzeria_get.php">received some much-needed financial assistance</a> from San Francisco restauranteur Daniel Patterson, as well as donations from Eleven Madison Park and other individual donors. It appears these donations have finally helped get the pizzeria back on its feet. Unfortunately, other Coney Island establishments <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509022720/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/06/coney_island_bar_cha_chas_will_neve.php">weren&apos;t so lucky</a>.</p>

<p>Totonno&apos;s grand reopening on Sunday came just in time for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509022720/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/22/coney_islands_opening_weekend_kicks.php">Coney Island&apos;s opening weekend</a>, where all the rides and attractions&#x2014;with the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509022720/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/26/new_york_aquarium_will_open_in_late.php#photo-1">exception of the Aquarium</a>&#x2014;were officially opened for the season. Time to stuff our faces with coal oven pizza and throw up on the Cyclone!</p>
