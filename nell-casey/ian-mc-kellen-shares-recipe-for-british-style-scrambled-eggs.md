<p>Sir Ian McKellen continues his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422204514/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/13/behold_the_ultimate_photo_of_sir_pa.php">delightful promotion</a> for his turn on Broadway with Patrick Stewart in <em>Waiting For Godot</em> and <em>No Man&apos;s Land</em>. The venerable actor has been keeping a lovely production blog that answers common questions posed to him at the stage door. This week&apos;s topic: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422204514/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/13/behold_the_ultimate_photo_of_sir_pa.php">Is that real alcohol that you drink in the plays?</a></p>

<p>The answer is no, of course. McKellen reveals the faux hooch is a combination of tap water, cold tea and soda water&#x2014;that&apos;s for the best, since the amount of alcohol consumption in <em>No Man&apos;s Land</em> alone rivals the binge drinking of a college fraternity. McKellen also eats in both plays, noting in particular the difficulty in consuming &quot;greasy [chicken] bones...gritty with dust from the wood stage&quot; in <em>Godot</em> (McKellen is vegetarian) and the full breakfast he&apos;s served during <em>No Man&apos;s Land</em>. </p>

<p>Props master Rob Brenner prepares the &quot;scrambled eggs, grilled tomato and three slices of crustless, white-bread toast&quot; feast under the stage during intermission. McKellen insisted on showing Brenner the &quot;British way,&quot; which he also shares on the blog:</p>

<blockquote>Ingredients: One large organic hen&apos;s egg: nob of organic butter: splash of organic milk: salt/pepper to taste.
<br><br>
Method: Throw all the ingredients together in a small saucepan and slowly heat the mixture, constantly stirring, until the eggs begin to solidify. I prefer my curds not too dry. The eggs this way do not ever separate but beware that the pan goes on cooking, after it is off the heat.</blockquote>

<p>So there you go! If you ever find yourself hosting Ian McKellen for breakfast, he likes his eggs organic and runny. And make the man a proper drink; he deserves one.</p>
