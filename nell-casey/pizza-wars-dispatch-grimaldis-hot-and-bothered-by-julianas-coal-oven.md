<p>The Dumbo dough drama is heating up <em>yet again</em> in Brooklyn&apos;s pizza wars. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150802211914/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/food-fight-grimaldi-pizza-spat-spreads-coal-oven-article-1.1214213?localLinksEnabled=false">Daily News reports today</a> that a complaint has been lodged with the Buildings Department against Patsy Grimaldi, former owner of famed pizza joint <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150802211914/http://gothamist.com/tags/grimaldis">Grimaldi&apos;s</a>, for allegedly installing an illegal coal oven in his new restaurant Juliana&apos;s. It comes as no surprise that the complaint was filed by Robert Scarano, the architect working for current Grimaldi&apos;s owner Frank Ciolli, in an attempt to further delay the opening of the rival pizza parlor.</p>

<p>&#x201C;Given the scrutiny that my filing for such an installation at another location underwent, I feel that it is my fiduciary obligation to bring this troubling and possibly life threatening issues to your attention,&#x201D; said Scarano to a Buildings Department &quot;bigwig,&quot; according to the News. A source close to the Grimaldi family denies any wrongdoing, saying the 20-year-old coal oven already installed in the restaurant simply needed repairs after some bricks had fallen apart. Ciolli faced similar hurdles when the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150802211914/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/26/city_may_block_grimaldis_move_to_ne.php">opening of the new Grimaldi&apos;s was delayed</a> after an anonymous tipster&#x2014;who Ciolli claims was Patsy&#x2014;complained Ciolli illegally installed a coal oven in the space. </p>

<p>This is just the latest in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150802211914/http://gothamist.com/tags/grimaldis">ongoing dispute</a> between the two pizzaioli. In September, Ciolli <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150802211914/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/02/grimaldis_versus_grimaldi_in_courtr.php">filed an injunction against Patsy</a> to prevent him from opening Juliana&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150802211914/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/25/pizza_shocker_grimaldis_is_being_re.php">in the former Grimaldi&apos;s space</a> next door. </p>
