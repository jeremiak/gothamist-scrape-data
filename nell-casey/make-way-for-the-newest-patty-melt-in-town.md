<p>The folks at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170609215952/https://www.parmnyc.com/">Parm</a> are introducing a <strong>Patty Melt</strong> to the menu at all of their NYC locations. Their version includes a burger patty with caramelized onions and provolone cheese, plus a &quot;special sauce&quot; to increase the goo factor. Instead of slices of rye bread or a bun, they&apos;re butter-toasting a Parisi roll and serving it upside down so the crust faces into the meat. The sandwich alone costs $12 or $16 with a side of the restaurant&apos;s Italian Fries</p>
