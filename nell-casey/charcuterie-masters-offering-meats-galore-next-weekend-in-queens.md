<p>Vegetarians: avert your gaze now, because it&apos;s all meat from here on out. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171015134532/https://www.eventbrite.com/e/charcuterie-masters-2017-tickets-28199570675">Charcuterie Masters</a> returns following a successful <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171015134532/http://gothamist.com/2017/01/31/nyc_events_guide_february.php?gallery0Pic=14#photo-14">initial run last year</a>, taking over <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171015134532/http://www.flushingtownhall.org/">Flushing Town Hall</a> for the evening next Saturday, February 25th. It&apos;s part meat celebration and part competition for charcuterie makers around the country (and Canada), who&apos;ll assemble their finest sausages, salamis, bacons, lardos, prosciutto, and p&#xE2;t&#xE9;s for the event.</p>

<p>All of those luscious meaty snacks will be available for sampling, too, alongside hot foods prepared by NYC chefs. Will <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171015134532/http://gothamist.com/2015/09/08/pastrami_perfection_at_harry_and_id.php#photo-1">&quot;Pastrami King&quot;</a> Horowitz&#x2014;who&apos;s been a loyal participant in other N.Y. Epicurean Events like the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171015134532/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/30/great_northeast_cheese_fest.php">Great Northeast Cheese Fest</a>&#x2014;will be making a &quot;smoked alpaca stew with roasted bladderwrack and wintergreen.&quot; (Bladderwrack is a kind of seaweed, for the curious.)</p>

<p>Josh Bowen of John Brown Smokehouse will be challenging Horowitz&apos;s pastrami prowess with his own melange of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171015134532/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/27/regional_bbq_styles_in_nyc.php#photo-1">Kansas City BBQ</a> and deli culture in a short rib pastrami reuben sandwich. Hugue Dufour and Alfonso Zhicay, also regular participants in these types of events, will be providing pork blood sausage and a savoy cabbage cole slaw with lemon dressing, carrot and parsnip chips plus a warm potato mousse, respectively. A little something for any lost vegs. </p>
