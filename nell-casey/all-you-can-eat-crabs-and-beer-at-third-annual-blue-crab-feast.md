<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150627223112/http://www.hammerandclaws.com/">Hammer &amp; Claws Blue Crab Feast</a> returns to NYC this month for its third unlimited crab-eating event. The scuttling critters make their way north in custom-built trailers, which transform into giant steaming vessels when they arrive at the venue. Last year, attendees used 3,250 mallets to break apart 37,500 Maryland blue crabs, which had been steamed with 1,200 pounds of Old Bay seasoning. This year, 40,000 &#x2212; 50,000 crustaceans make the journey from the Chesapeake Bay to your belly, so now&apos;s the time to perfect your technique!</p>

<p>In addition to the crabs, nosh on corn-on-the-cob, hot dogs and scratch-made cornbread, and wash down all that seasoning salt with all-you-can-drink brews from Louisiana&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150627223112/http://abita.com/age_verification.php?redirect=/">Abita Brewing Company</a>. If beer ain&apos;t your thang, Gotham Project wine can be procured a la carte, and if you&apos;re <em>still</em> hungry, grab an order of peel-and-eat shrimp on the side. </p>
