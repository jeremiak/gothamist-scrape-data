<p>Every September since 2009, running enthusiasts with stomachs of steel compete in the annual <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108042951/http://nycpizzarun.com/">NYC Pizza Run</a>, where they&apos;re asked to run two miles in Tompkins Square Park&#x2014;eating three slices of pizza along the way. Shockingly, in all its history, nobody has ever vomited on the course. We&apos;re rooting for you, 2016.</p>

<p>On the surface, it sounds a simple enough task. Participants run four laps around the park and are handed slices from Midtown&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108042951/http://www.certenyc.com/pizzabycerte.html">Pizza by Cert&#xE9;</a> at three intervals along the course. As it&apos;s a race, runners compete to be the fastest on the course&#x2014;and not the one who loses their lunch at the finish line.</p>

<p>Last year, two new records were set by runners, including a new course record (14:14), faster than the previous year by 11 seconds, and a new women&apos;s record (14:52), beating out the previous holder by 48 seconds.</p>

<p>&quot;I hear from returning participants every year that more and more people are training specifically for the event... going on practice runs and actually eating pizza during their run,&quot; founder Jason Feirman of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108042951/http://idreamofpizza.com/">I Dream Of Pizza Blog</a> told us. &quot;With that type of dedication, I wouldn&apos;t be surprised if this is another record breaking year.&quot;</p>

<p>The friendly race unfolds on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108042951/https://www.eventbrite.com/e/2016-nyc-pizza-run-tickets-26630969948">September 17th at 11 a.m.</a> this year. Tickets are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108042951/https://www.eventbrite.com/e/2016-nyc-pizza-run-tickets-26630969948">officially on sale</a> as of today; they&apos;re $50 in August, $60 in September, and $90 as a combo with the NYC Cupcake Run on October 15th. Runners get an official NYC Pizza Run t-shirt, a race bib, three slices of pizza to be consumed during the race, a pizza gift bag, and a free drink at the NYC Pizza Run afterparty at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108042951/http://www.doublewidebar.com/">Double Wide Bar &amp; Southern Kitchen</a>. As per usual, a portion of the proceeds benefit <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108042951/http://www.jdrf.org/">Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation International</a>. </p>
