<p>Every year, die hard cheese experts&#x2014;and the devotees who take their advice <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170615175124/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/04/the_best_cheese_shops_in_nyc.php">at cheese shops</a>&#x2014;gather for the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170615175124/http://www.cheesemongerinvitational.com/">Cheesemonger Invitational</a>, an industry competition for cheesemongers...and an excuse for everyone else to eat a truckload of cheese.</p>

<p>Now in its eighth year, the Invitational is a weekend&apos;s worth of roundtables and cheese discussions (you are not invited), followed by preliminary competitions for cheese professionals (you are also not invited to this), concluding in a giant cheese party (it&apos;s go time, baby!). </p>

<p>The party on the evening of June 24th includes <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170615175124/http://gothamist.com/2014/06/30/cheesemonger_invitational.php#photo-1">station-upon-station</a> of cheese-centric items. In previous years that&apos;s included a raclette station, which organizer Adam &quot;Mr. Moo&quot; Moskowitz promises again for 2017 along with grilled cheese, sliders, and fondue&#x2014;plus plain old cheese in the raw. There&apos;ll also be free-flowing, unlimited beer, wine, and cider. </p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170615175124/http://gothamist.com/2014/06/30/cheesemonger_invitational.php#photo-1">final rounds of competition</a> also go down at the party. Mongers have been tasked with cutting the perfect 1/4, 1/3 and 1/2 pound portions of cheese on the fly at previous events; attend to find out what fromage magic they&apos;ll be getting up to this year. </p>

<p>The Cheesemonger Invitational closing party takes place on Saturday, June 24th. GA tickets are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170615175124/http://www.cheesemongerinvitational.com/tickets-1/">$70</a> with access at 6 p.m. or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170615175124/http://www.cheesemongerinvitational.com/tickets-1/">$100</a> for VIP access at 5 p.m. The event takes place at the charmingly-named <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170615175124/http://larkin.com/">Larkin Cold Storage</a> at 4755 27th Street in Long Island City. </p>
