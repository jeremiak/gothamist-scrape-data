<p>Looks like the catsup&apos;s out of the bag and America&apos;s mayonnaise lovers can finally stand proud as one creamy, united front. According to a new market research report, the eggy condiment beats out ketchup as the United States&apos; most purchased condiment. We&apos;re <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141230203324/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/10/mayonnaise_store_opens_in_brooklyn.php">blaming Brooklyn</a>.</p>

<p>Our country consumes $2 billion in mayonnaise each year, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141230203324/http://qz.com/172019/ketchup-isnt-the-king-of-american-condiments-mayonnaise-is/">Quartz reports</a>, more than double the amount of ketchup, which rings in at $800 million. Put that on your french fries and eat it! (Mayonnaise on french fries tastes delicious, btw.)</p>

<p>Soy sauce ranked third in America&apos;s most popular condiments, with a market value around $725 million; barbecue sauce came in fourth place at around $660 million. America&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141230203324/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/20/hot_sauces_of_the_world.php">growing love for hot sauce</a> wasn&apos;t able to push the fiery sauce into the top three but at least it&apos;s faring better than mustard, whose paltry (by comparison) sales weren&apos;t able to crack $450 million. Pray for the dirty water dog.</p>
