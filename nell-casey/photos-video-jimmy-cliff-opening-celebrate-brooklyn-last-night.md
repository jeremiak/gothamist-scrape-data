A huge crowd packed into the bandshell for the free show, which lasted over two hours and included three encores. Cliff sang and danced his way through his 50+ year career with renditions of &quot;Wild World,&quot; &quot;I Can See Clearly,&quot; &quot;Many Rivers To Cross&quot; and &quot;Harder They Come.&quot; He also surprised the crowd with a cover of punk rock band Rancid&apos;s &quot;Ruby Soho.&quot; Reactions to the show were overwhelmingly positive as you can see from the Tweets below:</p>
