					<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171012131216/http://www.thedoughnutproject.com/#welcome=">The Doughnut Project&apos;s</a> continuing mission to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171012131216/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/13/doughnut_project_meat_week.php">expand</a> the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171012131216/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/23/doughnut_project_everything_doughnu.php">parameters</a> of the doughnut universe continues with their latest batch of speciality yeast treats, which are inspired by founders Troy Neal and Leslie Polizzotto&apos;s favorite restaurant dishes. The &quot;Restaurant Series&quot; doughnuts will be weekend specials at their small West Village shop, with a different doughnut available each week for six weeks. </p>

<p>&quot;We chose dishes that when we were out eating them, we thought, &apos;Wow...this would make a great doughnut!&apos;&quot; Polizzotto told us. &quot;Every so often you come across a dish where the flavors work so well together that the dish becomes memorable.&quot; So far, the team has announced plans for the first three special doughnuts.</p>

<p>First up (January 20th - 22nd): a doughnut inspired by a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171012131216/https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/quality-eats-new-york?select=gucDOUoHzIKTZEGvEXLkng">dish</a> of Chef Ryan Bartlow at Quality Eats, where thick slabs of Nueske&apos;s bacon are grilled and rested on a peanut butter bed and topped with jalapeno jelly. Translated into pastry you get a jalapeno and apple filled doughnut with peanut butter glaze with Nueske bacon topping. </p>

<p>Next (January 27th - 29th), a doughnut riff on the Kabocha Squash, Grilled Grapes, Arugula and Capers dish by Chef Michael Anthony at Gramercy Tavern, which was turned into a squash filled doughnut with a grilled green grape glaze with a fried caper topping. And finally (February 10th - 12th), pasta turned pastry with a tomato jam filled doughnut with olive oil glaze and pecorino cheese with a guanciale topping, a nod to Chef Robert Zwirz&apos;s Bucatini All&apos;Amatriciana at Lupa.</p>

<p>Mario Batali, who co-owns Lupa, was so smitten with the homage that he requested a mini version of the doughnut to be offered on the restaurant&apos;s dessert menu. </p>

<p>Doughnuts cost between $4.25 - $5.75&#x2014;and look hearty enough to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171012131216/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/13/doughnut_project_meat_week.php">make a meal</a> out of them. </p>
