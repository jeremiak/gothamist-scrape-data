<p>For some, a brutal heat wave means pouring rent money into an air conditioner; for others, it means finding a restaurant with air conditioning and then taking off your clothes. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503231345/http://evgrieve.com/2013/07/female-diner-decides-to-go-topless-last.html">EV Grieve</a> files this dispatch from Alphabet City&apos;s Verso, where on Sunday evening a female diner sat down at the restaurant and immediately removed her top. Across from her, a male companion snapped photos and (probably) giggled &quot;boobies!&quot; under his breath. </p>

<p>Verso&apos;s owner, Labinot Baraliu, petitioned with the woman to please put her shirt back on, but the brazen breast brandisher countered that it was &quot;perfectly legal&quot; to sit sans shirt in the restaurant. &quot;In 15 years [in the restaurant business] I&apos;ve seen all kinds of things, but not this,&quot; Baraliu explained to EV Grieve, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503231345/http://evgrieve.com/2013/07/female-diner-decides-to-go-topless-last.html">which has the NSFW photo here</a>. &quot;It was funny, but at the same time I was like &apos;WTF &#x2014; is this really happening?&apos;&quot; After some back and forth, the couple was ushered out of the restaurant.</p>

<p>By now we all know that women <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503231345/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/15/cops_told_not_to_arrest_topless_wom.php">can&apos;t be arrested</a> for baring their boobs in public, but restaurants are private property, subject to whatever rules the establishment decides are most appropriate. So while we&apos;re all for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503231345/http://gothamist.com/2012/08/26/photos_topless_day_in_bryant_park_w.php#photo-1">letting loose</a> when the time is right, we&apos;ll have to side with the restaurant on this one. Unless you&apos;re <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503231345/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/30/breastfeeding_showdown_at_westchest.php">feeding your child</a>, maybe it&apos;s best to keep the gals under wraps while you&apos;re eating. But take heart, urban nudist: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503231345/http://gothamist.com/2012/08/16/save_the_date_august_26th_is_toples.php">your special day is coming up</a>!</p>
