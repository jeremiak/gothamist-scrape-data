<p>Vegans and lactose-avoiders can now join the rest of us in enjoying a post-breakup pint of Ben &amp; Jerry&apos;s with the introduction of the ice cream-maker&apos;s first line of dairy-free frozen desserts. The Vermont-based company announced a new line of frozen treats made with an almond-milk base and stuffed with the brand&apos;s signature abundance of swirls, baked goods and other types of mix-ins. </p>

<p>OG flavor Chunky Monkey has been given the vegan treatment, as has Chocolate Fudge Brownie made with brownies from Yonkers-based Greyston Bakery. The brand is also introducing two new flavors to its fleet: a Coffee Caramel Fudge (coffee base with fudge chunks and caramel swirls) and the P.B. Cookies (vanilla base with chocolate sandwich cookies and crunchy peanut butters swirls), the latter of which will be available both in pints as well as in scoop shops. </p>

<p>Vegan products and restaurants are a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160716025953/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/24/by_chloe_expanding.php">rapidly growing business model</a> in NYC but vegan ice cream has been a bit of a gamble. Vegan ice cream shop DF Mavens, which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160716025953/http://gothamist.com/2015/01/08/df_mavens.php">opened last January</a>, has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160716025953/http://ny.eater.com/2016/2/3/10909328/vegan-ice-cream-east-village-closes">closed its parlor</a>, as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160716025953/http://evgrieve.com/2016/02/blythe-annes-former-lulas-sweet.html">has Blythe Anne&apos;s</a>, also in the East Village. But if anyone can make vegan ice cream appealing, it&apos;s <strike>Ben &amp; Jerry&apos;s</strike> the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160716025953/http://www.fastcompany.com/3000398/when-unilever-bought-ben-jerrys-story-ceo-adaptability">Unilever corporation</a>!</p>
