<p>Though the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231084959/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/04/why_is_it_still_so_freaking_cold.php">temperatures outside may not reflect it just yet</a>, we are firmly into the spring season now, so take heart! Because with the warmer weather comes the repopulation of the city&apos;s parks and outdoor spaces, including the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231084959/http://gothamist.com/tags/highline">High Line</a>, which <a rhef="http://www.thehighline.org/blog/2013/04/04/high-line-food-2013-season-starts-april-19?utm_source=twitter-fhl&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_content=blog-food&amp;utm_campaign=post-food-2013">begins its food vending on Friday, April 19th</a>. And it&apos;s going to be much <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231084959/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/20/make_a_salad.php">more than salad!</a></p>

<p>Many of last season&apos;s vendors are returning to the urban oasis, including The Taco Truck, serving up authentic Mexican street food in the form of Carnitas Tacos and Pollo Asado Tortas. Two new food stalls are setting up shop in the park, including a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231084959/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/01/brisketlab_team_bringing_smoked_mea.php">rib-centric menu from the BrisketLab team</a> and wacky braided dough creations by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231084959/http://www.sigmundnyc.com/">Sigmund&apos;s Pretzels</a>. Having sampled their regular salted pretzels and fallen deeply in love, we&apos;re extra excited to give flavors like feta olive and truffle cheddar a try.</p>

<p>Sugar addicts jonesing for a brain freeze won&apos;t have a problem getting their fix. Frozen treats from L&apos;Arte del Gelato, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231084959/http://lanewyorkina.com/Home.html">La Newyorkina</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231084959/http://meltbakery.com/">Melt Bakery</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231084959/http://www.peoplespops.com/peoples_pops.html">People&apos;s Pops</a> will be available again this year. And although it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231084959/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/14/avocado-based_desserts_showing_up_a.php">won&apos;t be seen in doughnut form</a>, we hear some avocado-based desserts might be popping up in a few of these treats. </p>

<p>Finally, if eating your way across nearly 1.5 miles of converted railway has you feeling drained, refuel for the return trip with espresso or iced coffee from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231084959/http://www.bluebottlecoffee.com/">Blue Bottle Coffe</a>. Or give in to your bacchanalian tendencies and opt for an artisanal wine or beer from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231084959/http://restauranthearth.com/terrior/Terroir.html">Terroir on the Porch</a>. </p>

<p>Now to find a way to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231084959/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/09/after_dark_the_high_lines_phase_ii.php#photo-1">burn off all those calories</a>...</p>
