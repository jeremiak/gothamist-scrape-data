                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="101113cop.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203054323im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/101113cop.jpeg" width="640" height="480" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>The foul-mouthed cop who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203054323/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/11/video_dancing_cop_tells_street_vend.php">danced her way to Internet notoriety</a> probably isn&apos;t feeling so jovial. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203054323/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2013/10/16/intense-confrontation-between-cop-street-vendor-caught-on-video/">According to CBS</a>, the fiesty cop who told a street vendor to &quot;blow me, bitch&quot; during a confrontation over a ticket is under investigation after a video of her performance went viral.</p>

<p>&quot;That&apos;s been referred to the civilian complaint review board,&quot; explained Police Commissioner Ray Kelly. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203054323/http://www.nyc.gov/html/ccrb/html/home/home.shtml">CCRB</a>, which operates independently of the NYPD, handles complaints about police misconduct, including claims of &quot;discourtesy&quot; by officers when interacting with a citizen. As defined by the board, discourtesy refers to &quot;cursing and using other foul language or gestures,&quot; both of which were employed&#x2014;and caught on video!&#x2014;by the officer in question. &#x201C;Once in a while you get a bad apple,&quot; Kelly went on to say. &quot;It doesn&#x2019;t mean that the whole NYPD is bad.&#x201D;  </p>

<p>According to the vendor, who wanted his identity kept a secret, the trouble started when the officer ticketed him for illegally parking his truck in Herald Square. &quot;I try to explain in the full video, can you explain why I&apos;m not allowed to be here and she couldn&#x2019;t come up with an answer,&quot; he told CBS. Instead of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203054323/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/19/video_extremely_courteous_cop_indul.php">courteously and professionally explaining the violation</a>, the officer offered up the adult and totally mature version of nanny nanny poo poo. </p>
