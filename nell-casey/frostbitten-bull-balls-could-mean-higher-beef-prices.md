<p>You could wait a whole career to write a headline like that. An attention-grabbing announcement from the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420053714/http://www.agrimarketing.com/s/87683">Ohio State Economist</a> warns that this season&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420053714/http://gothamist.com/tags/polarvortex">subzero temperatures</a> have put the country&apos;s cattle at risk for &quot;scrotal frostbite.&quot; First it was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420053714/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/12/just_in_time_for_grilling_season_be.php">too hot</a> and now it&apos;s too cold; can&apos;t these bulls just sack up and deal with it?</p>

<p>&quot;While normal winter conditions typically don&apos;t result in scrotal frostbite in breeding bulls, the extremely cold, harsh and prolonged weather experienced this year increases its likelihood, and that could result in the animals&apos; infertility for the upcoming breeding season,&quot; explains cattle specialist Steve Boyles. Apparently the older bulls get hit the worst because they can&apos;t pull their &quot;lower-hanging scrotums&quot; up towards their bodies. Ah, the indignities of old age.</p>

<p>&quot;Some may not realize the potential impact this harsh winter weather has on reproduction now because we tend to think about it during the summer when the bull is supposed to be out there working.&quot; Don&apos;t worry, we&apos;re <em>all</em> thinking about cow&apos;s nuts now&#x2014;thanks Steve! </p>

<p>Bull infertility compounds an already shrinking U.S. herd, which reached a 63-year low in January to 87.7 million head, according to the USDA. Beef output is expected to hit a 20 year low, meaning consumers will spend 3% more on average for red meat. Looks like we&apos;re gonna <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420053714/http://gothamist.com/2014/03/06/knitters_unite_adorable_australian.php">need more knitters</a>. </p>
