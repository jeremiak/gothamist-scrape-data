<p>Chick-Fil-A&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161007081704/http://gothamist.com/2014/04/08/chick-fil-a_opening_multiple_nyc_re.php">threats of proliferation</a> have become more real today with news that the chain has big plans for new chicken restaurants locally by 2018. The New York area&#x2014;including Long Island, northern New Jersey and Connecticut&#x2014;should brace itself for about a dozen new restaurants to open in the next year and a half, including several right here in NYC, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161007081704/https://www.buzzfeed.com/venessawong/chick-fil-a-plans-more-than-a-dozen-new-nyc-area-openings#.cg638a99oP">Buzzfeed News reports</a>. </p>

<p>Joining the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161007081704/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/01/inside_chickfila_nyc.php">Herald Square flagship</a> and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161007081704/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/29/chick-fil-as_third_nyc_location_rev.php">newly-opened midtown outpost</a> are potential new restaurants in the Financial District near the Fulton Center and possibly somewhere on the Upper East Side. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161007081704/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/29/chick-fil-as_third_nyc_location_rev.php">rumored Madison Square Park</a> location was not confirmed and none of the other NYC outposts were named by the company. Long Island enjoys a Port Jefferson Station outpost, with others potentially arriving in three other towns during this expansion phase; there were no specifics about Connecticut.</p>

<p>The New York market isn&apos;t the only area the problematic chicken chain has targeted for invasion. Strategic plans have already been set in motion for Los Angeles, Washington State, Portland and Nevada, which&apos;ll help bump up the chain&apos;s 2,000+ strongholds throughout the country. May our <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161007081704/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/23/nyc_chain_stores.php">strong defenses</a> protect us. </p>
