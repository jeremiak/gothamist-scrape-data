<p>Get your fiber supplements at the ready because the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508161214/http://bigapplebbq.org/">Big Apple Barbecue Block Party</a> is back for its 11th year of smoked goodies and meat sweats. The Block Party has come a long way since its <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508161214/http://gothamist.com/2003/06/02/1st_annual_big_apple_barbecue_block_party.php">humble beginnings on 27th Street</a>, meaning more meat, more fanfare and way more people. Lines can be intense, but there are lots of free discussions, performances and demos to help spread out the crowd. </p>

<p>Pitmasters from across the nation will be smoking and grilling their barbecue beasts, including Scott Roberts from Texas institution <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508161214/http://www.saltlickbbq.com/">The Salt Lick</a>, Mike Emerson from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508161214/http://www.pappyssmokehouse.com/">Pappy&apos;s Smokehouse</a> in St. Louis and Rodney Scott from Hemingway, South Carolina&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508161214/http://thescottsbbq.com/Home_Page.html">Scott&apos;s Bar-B-Que</a>. Local talent is part of the mix as well, with Kenny Callaghan (Blue Smoke), Charles Grund, Jr. (Hill Country) and John Stage (Dinosaur Bar-B-Que) all smoking up their specialties. </p>

<p>The Block Party takes over Madison Square Park on Saturday and Sunday, June 8th and 9th, from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission to the meatfest is free, so bully for you if you&apos;re satiated by meat smells alone. To stuff your face with ribs and the like, $9 plates are available from the pitmasters rigs. If you&apos;re truly serious about eating as much meat as you can, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508161214/http://bigapplebbq.org/fastpass.php">FastPass tickets</a>, which also let you cut the line, are available for $125 and include a $100 voucher redeemable for food, beverages and merchandise for you plus a guest.</p>
