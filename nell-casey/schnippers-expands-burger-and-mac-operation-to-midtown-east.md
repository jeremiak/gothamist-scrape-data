<p>The new location has the same menu as its predecessors, including a variety of burgers and dogs, sandwiches and sloppy joe-inspired dishes. They&apos;re also introducing a special hamburger for the new spot, the Schnipper&apos;s Old Fashioned ($6.99), with American cheese, griddled onions and pink sauce. If that&apos;s not enough greasy deliciousness for you, try the Sloppy Fries ($6.99), topped with meaty sloppy joe mix and cheese sauce. </p>

<p>For a comfort food eatery they also do a solid salad selection, like the Fig &amp; Blue ($9.25) with dried figs, blue cheese, apples, walnuts and croutons and the Santa Fe ($9.25) with corn, tomatoes, peppers, cheddar, poblanos and tortilla strips. On the sweet side, they&apos;re doing fun things with shakes ($5.99 - $6.50), including a frosty concoctions like Salted Caramel and Peanut Butter &amp; Jelly. </p>
