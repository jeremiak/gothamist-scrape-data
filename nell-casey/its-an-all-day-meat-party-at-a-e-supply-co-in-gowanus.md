					<p>Restaurants have been breeding with butcher shops of late (see April Bloomfield&apos;s White Gold as a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171015144228/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/26/white_gold_butchers.php#photo-1">recent notable</a>), ostensibly offering fresher cuts for in-house dining while also offering a valuable (and profitable) retail component. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171015144228/http://www.aesupplyco.com/">A&amp;E; Supply Co.</a>, which opened on 4th Avenue in Gowanus late last year, officially transitioned from daytime cafe and butchery to a hybrid serving dinner last night. </p>

<p>The owners are two North End Grill vets: chef Adam Harvey&#x2014;who also worked at Union Square Cafe and learned the meat cutting trade at The Meat Hook&#x2014;and general manager Ennio Di Nino. They&apos;ve been running a butcher counter, daytime coffee shop and a bar in the evening, but now they&apos;re transitioning to full-time feeding with a walk-in dinner service&#x2014;though they&apos;ve been testing out some of the dishes on the locals, who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171015144228/https://www.yelp.com/biz/a-and-e-supply-co-brooklyn-7?sort_by=date_desc">all seem to be on board</a>.</p>

<p>For a butcher shop, they certainly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171015144228/http://www.aesupplyco.com/dinner/">offer</a> a lot of non-meat and seafood options. Raw dishes include a Local Fluke Crudo ($16) and the &quot;Cold,&quot; salad-y section includes their version of a classic beets and goat cheese salad called &quot;We Got The Beets&quot; ($12) with frisee, orange vin, port and a chevre from Lively Run Dairy. </p>

<p>Back to the animals, there&apos;s an A&amp;E; Burger ($7) with beef heart, a Beer Can Chicken ($32) with a bbq spice rub, and their &quot;Chicken Nugget Gnocchi&quot; ($19) is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171015144228/http://www.grubstreet.com/2017/02/what-to-eat-at-a-and-e-supply-co-opening-tonight-for-dinner.html">already making headlines</a>. </p>

<p><em>548 4th Avenue, (718) 635-3388; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171015144228/http://www.aesupplyco.com/">aesupplyco.com</a></em></p>
