<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160809154103/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/26/i_waited_on_line_for_cronuts_and_ha.php">tyranny of the Cronut line</a> just got a little zippier, not to mention warmer! To perk up the bleary-eyed pastry fanatics, the bakery has launched a coffee and hot chocolate cart to offer hot beverages to folks waiting for Dominique Ansel&apos;s creation. On Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, the cart opens up an hour before the bakery proper, providing sustenance to Cronut seekers in autumn&apos;s dipping temperatures. Coffee&#x2014;a medium roast from La Colombe&#x2014;runs $2 for a small, $2.50 for a large; the hot chocolate&#x2014;made in-house, of course&#x2014;goes for $4.25 and $4.50.</p>

<p>In other Cronut news, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160809154103/https://twitter.com/DominiqueAnsel/status/395265594364137472">chef revealed</a> November&apos;s delectable flavor via Twitter and <em>saints alive</em> it sounds incredible: Salted Dulce de Leche. The bakery tells us the inside comes filled with Dulce de Leche Ganache and Dulce de Leche Caramel and the pastry is topped with a Dulce de Leche glaze and Fleur de Sel. Now if we just had some interns willing to wait on line...</p>
