<p>As if there was any doubt, beloved hot dog institution Gray&apos;s Papaya was ousted from their Sixth Avenue digs because the landlord <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504163518/http://blogs.villagevoice.com/forkintheroad/2014/01/grays_papaya_shutters.php">jacked up the god damn rent</a>. Owner Nicholas Gray confirmed the sad truth to Fork in the Road, revealing the landlord &quot;wanted to raise [the] rent to $50,000 from $30,000&quot; for the coveted corner space. Despite its <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504163518/http://ny.eater.com/archives/2014/01/sietsema_looks_back_at_the_legacy_of_grays_papaya.php">continual popularity</a>, the 28-year-old outpost couldn&apos;t justify the big price jump and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504163518/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/08/theres_only_one_grays_papaya_left_i.php">closed its doors</a>.</p>

<p>Gray had a bit of good news amidst the closure, saying that he&apos;s always &quot;looking for corners&quot; but notes they&apos;re &quot;hard to find.&quot; Considering how many corners are populated by banks&#x2014;who can afford steep rents&#x2014;it&apos;ll be a tough road for the restaurant to secure a location with good food traffic, especially when they&apos;re only charging a few bucks for their dogs. It&apos;s too soon to tell what fate will befall both the doggery but <em>oh boy get ready</em> because motherf*cking juice bar Liquiteria will <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504163518/http://ny.eater.com/archives/2014/01/trendy_juice_bar_chain_taking_over_grays_papaya_space.php">move into the space</a>, according to Eater. Everything is horrible.</p>
