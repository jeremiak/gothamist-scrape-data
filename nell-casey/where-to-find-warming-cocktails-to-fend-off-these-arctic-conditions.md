<p><em>It&apos;s freezing, it&apos;s a Friday&#x2014;let&apos;s drink.</em></p>

<p>The Germans know a thing or two about keeping warm for the winter&#x2014;and not just loading up on potatoes and sausages. On the LES, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140226200527/http://www.loreleynyc.com/">Loreley</a> has a few specialities including a <strong>Hot Toddy</strong> ($7) made with Barenjager Honey Liqueur and Jagermeister Spice and a rendition of <strong>Gluhwein</strong> ($8), or red mulled wine. For something a little different, try the <strong>Heisser Seehund</strong> (&quot;Hot Seal,&quot; $9), a mulled white wine punch with lemon juice, sugar, spiced rum, almonds and raisins. <em>7 Rivington Street, (212) 253-7077</em></p>

Instead of the traditional brown liquor, they&apos;re mixing their <strong>Pearman&apos;s Toddy</strong> up with Breuckelen Glorious Gin, cinnamon, lemon water and bitters; that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140226200527/http://gothamist.com/2012/11/02/fletchers_bbq_opens_tonight_in_toxi.php#photo-1">pairs well with ribs</a>, right? <em>433 Third Avenue, (347) 763-2680</em><p></p>

<p>Spiked hot chocolate is one of the season&apos;s great perks and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140226200527/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/28/bos.php#photo-1">new cajun spot</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140226200527/http://bosrestaurant.com/">Bo&apos;s</a> has an <strong>Oaxacan Hot Chocolate</strong> that&apos;ll perk you up on multiple levels. They&apos;re mixing their Guittard dark chocolate with tequila&#x2014;you&apos;ll be on the bar in no time!&#x2014;plus some chili pepper for an extra little kick. If wine&apos;s more your speed, try out their <strong>Mulled Wine Sangria</strong>, made with Malbec, spiced rum, pomegranate, apple and spices. <em>6 West 24th Street, (212) 234-2373</em></p>

<p>They&apos;re combing two powerhouse winter drinks into one at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140226200527/http://onefivehospitality.com/restaurants/the-fourth-american-brasserie/">The Fourth</a> with <strong>The Hot Toddy</strong>. Cinnamon, clove, blood orange and star anise add some heft to hot apple cider, further bolstered by Smith and Cross rum. The dainty cocktail gets finished with an egg white foam for the perfect toddy &apos;stache. <em>132 Fourth Avenue, (212) 432-1324</em></p>

<p>SoHo&apos;s well-appointed New Zealand eatery <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140226200527/http://www.musketroom.com/#/">The Musket Room</a> summons the heat of the Pacific Ring of Fire with the <strong>Rotorua</strong> ($13), an apple-centric cocktail named for a hot spring in the region. Served in a snifter with a sprig of rosemary, the potent cocktail starts with hot apple cider then adds Paul Beau VS cognac, Laird&apos;s Apple brandy, Becherovka and Licor 43. <em>265 Elizabeth Street, (212) 219-0764</em></p>

<p>Over at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140226200527/http://www.pioranyc.com/">Piora</a>, head bartender Shinya Yamao updates the most decadent of holiday delights with the <strong>Sake Eggnog</strong>. The cloyingly sweet traditional cocktail gets a healthy dose of Nigori Sake, a type of cloudy, unfiltered sake that skews to the sweet side of the scale. If that&apos;s too saccharine for you, opt for the <strong>Navy Proof</strong>, made with ginger beer, fresh orange juice, lime juice and Pusser&apos;s Rum. <em>430 Hudson Street, (212) 960-3801</em></p>
