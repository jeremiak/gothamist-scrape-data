<p>In the mescaline overdose at a New Jersey Six Flags that is this election, the one brief respite we&apos;ve been afforded are the jokes and memes that, for one blessed moment, help us forget that we&apos;re alarmingly close to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161023044138/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/17/trump_clinton_threats.php">electing a racist toupee</a> to the highest office in this country. As they&apos;re <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161023044138/http://gothamist.com/2014/09/11/911_brand_remember.php">wont to do</a> despite it literally <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161023044138/http://gothamist.com/2015/04/22/earth_day_half_price_glocks.php">always backfiring</a>, the #brands have also thrown their #engagement tactics into overdrive, like frozen diabetes pushers 16 Handles, which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161023044138/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/07/trump_what_this_time_oh_god.php">used Trump&apos;s sexual assault brag</a> to &quot;Make Fro-Yo Great Again.&quot; Guys: no.</p>

<p>The frozen yogurt company sent the above graphic to their email listserve in advance of last night&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161023044138/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/20/trump_clinton_last_debate.php#photo-1">debate</a>, urging their fans to &quot;grab &apos;em by the fro-yo&quot; like so many pussies allegedly grabbed by our potential future fuhrer. Besides being in extremely poor taste, the ad also makes no sense. Are we meant to snatch the fro-yo away from someone else with our tiny baby hands? Or is this meant to be a wooing tactic whereby we&apos;re bestowing the gift of lesser ice cream on someone?</p>

<p>The brand later issued an apology, because in 2016, even yogurt has to clarify its position on sexual assault. </p>
