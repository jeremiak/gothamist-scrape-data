<p>Without a doubt, the Chick&apos;n Shack (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171030200916/http://gothamist.com/2015/07/07/shake_shack_chicken.php">n&#xE9;e ChickenShack</a>) has been Shake Shack&apos;s most momentous new menu item since they <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171030200916/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/06/shake_shack_debuts_fresh_cut_fries.php">flip flopped</a> with their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171030200916/http://gothamist.com/2014/08/08/shake_shake_revives_the_crinkle_cut.php">french fry recipe</a>. When it debuted last summer, the sandwich was only available at Brooklyn outposts, but beginning the today, Shack Heads nationwide can get a bite of the fried chicken sandwich, as it&apos;s now available at every Shack in the USA. </p>

<p>Unsurprisingly, the sandwich is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171030200916/http://gothamist.com/2015/07/07/shake_shack_chicken_post_mortem.php#photo-1">pretty damn tasty</a>, so much so that the sandwich was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171030200916/http://gothamist.com/2015/07/09/shake_shack_chicken_sold_out.php">completely sold out</a> two days after it debuted. Hopefully the team has put some contingency plans in place if the rush is similar to its early days. </p>

<p>In case you haven&apos;t tried the sandwich yet, expect a buttermilk-marinated chicken breast with a thick, crunchy batter topped with herb mayo, lettuce and pickles on a soft potato bun. If a traditional fast food comparison had to be made, think of McDonald&apos;s special chicken sandwiches, only Shake Shack&apos;s are made with cage-free, antibiotic, hormone and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171030200916/http://gothamist.com/2014/04/01/mcdonalds_managers_admit_to_stealin.php">fuckery-free</a> chicken. </p>
