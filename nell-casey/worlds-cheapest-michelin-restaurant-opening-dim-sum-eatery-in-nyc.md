<p>New York City boasts a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161217170429/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/01/2016_michelin_winners.php">hearty contingent of Michelin-starred restaurants</a>: all delicious, but many prohibitively expensive for a routine visit. At some point this fall, however, the world&apos;s least expensive eatery to earn a Michelin nod will open an outpost in New York City, bringing its lauded bargain eats to Greenwich Village. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161217170429/http://www.villagevoice.com/restaurants/exclusive-tim-ho-wan-the-worlds-cheapest-michelin-starred-restaurant-opening-in-new-york-city-8490490">The Village Voice reports</a> that Hong Kong-born <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161217170429/http://www.timhowan.com/">Tim Ho Wan</a>, a dim sum-centric eatery with outposts in Australia and Thailand and beyond, will open the first USA location at 4th Avenue and 10th Street inside a former Spice restaurant space. Proprietor Mak Kwai Pui is currently seeking a &quot;local Chinese face&quot; to be chef at the restaurant, which will steam up glistening prawn dumplings, baked buns and other dim sum specialities in addition to &quot;dishes appealing to American appetites, including &apos;high quality beef dishes.&apos;&quot;</p>

<p>Unlike the point-and-grab cart system common at many dim sum restaurants, Mak&apos;s system includes a printed menu with pictures and descriptions of each dish, where diners select their desired dishes&#x2014;all priced under $5&#x2014;and hand over to the staff. The restaurant will also serve alcohol.</p>
