					<p>The Metropolitan Museum of Art routinely creates a feast for the eyes, but in recent years has also begun <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170401080033/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/10/met_cocktails.php">stimulating more senses</a>, specifically taste and smell. In conjunction with the upcoming <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170401080033/http://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2017/age-of-empires">Age of Empires</a> exhibition, which showcases Chinese art during the Qin and Han dynasties, the museum reimagined their second-floor balcony bar as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170401080033/http://www.metmuseum.org/press/news/2017/tea-drunk">Tea Drunk at The Met</a> in partnership with the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170401080033/https://tea-drunk.com/">tea house of the same name</a> in the East Village.</p>

<p>Instead of the usual martinis&#x2014;those are sticking around on Friday and Saturday evenings when the pop-up is replaced by the Great Hall Balcony Bar&#x2014;the space will serve Chinese tea house fare anchored by five different types of tea. The artisanal teas, supplied by Tea Drunk, include green (Gua Pian), black, white, Pu Er (fermented), and Wu Long, which were all hand-selected by the team during annual trips to China. </p>

<p>Diners seated at the cafe are treated to a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170401080033/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gongfu_tea_ceremony">Gongfu-style</a> tea service by staff from the downtown cafe. Prices range depending on the variety of tea, but expect to spend between $20 (for two) for green tea and up to $50 (for two) for the rare Wu Long Tea. Each service also includes little snacks like cakes and cookies and there&apos;s a walk-up counter serving cups of tea ($9), coffee and pastries to go. </p>

<p>In conjunction with the new tea program and exhibition, the Museum will also host composer Tan Dun (of <em>Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon</em> fame) for two performances March 31st and April 1st of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170401080033/http://www.metmuseum.org/events/programs/met-live-arts/tan-dun-17-1?eid=254174">Symphony of Colors: Terracotta</a>, an ensemble piece that employs terracotta drums as a nod to terracotta warriors featured in the exhibit.</p>

<p><em>Tea Drunk at The Met operates Sunday through Thursday, 10 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.; Friday and Saturday, 10 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. Age of Empires: Chinese Art of the Qin and Han Dynasties (221 B.C.-A.D. 220) opens April 3rd and the pop-up cafe will operate daily for the next three months.</em></p>
