Following Herald Square, Forest Hills, Queens is the recipient of the newest Shack, which will occupy some prime real estate along busy commercial Austin Street when it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170326190157/https://www.shakeshack.com/2016/05/23/shake-shack-deepens-nyc-roots-forest-hills-queens/">opens on Thursday</a>.
