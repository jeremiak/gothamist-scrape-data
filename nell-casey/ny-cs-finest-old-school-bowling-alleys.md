										<p><em>Not crazy about the younger breed of newfangled bowling alleys cropping up across the city&#x2014;places with blaring DJs, exorbitant drink prices, and some BS lounge-y atmosphere? If you prefer the smell of stale beer and tacky furnishings to compliment your game, click through for a journey to some of New York City&apos;s classic old school alleys; while they&apos;re a dying breed, they <em>do</em> exist, if you know where to look.</em></p>

The decor is tacky-chic, with New York City-themed murals and well-worn plastic seats, and most everyone is a friendly regular.

And though no one would accuse Maple of being expensive, after 9 p.m. on Sundays a $6 cover gets you cheaper-than-ever $1 games until closing. Or relive your Pink Floyd-fueled heyday with the Cosmic Fun Pack: two hours of bowling plus shoe rentals for six, all for only $69.99 on Friday nights.
