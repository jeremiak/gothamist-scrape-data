<p>This colorful fellow unexpectedly appeared in lobsterman Sheldon Trenholm&apos;s trap in Antigonish, Nova Scotia on Friday. At first, Trenholm <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130813081423/http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/story/2013/06/09/ns-blue-lobster-caught.html">told CBC news</a> he didn&apos;t know what the astonishingly blue creature in his basket was. When he realized he had caught one of the rare blue lobsters, he snapped a few photos and tossed the little guy back into the ocean. </p>

<p>You&apos;ve got a one in 2 million shot at finding a blue lobster, according to the University of Maine <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130813081423/http://umaine.edu/lobsterinstitute/files/2011/12/LobsterColorsWeb.pdf">[pdf</a>], though they do <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130813081423/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/03/freak_of_nature_blue_lobster.php">pop up from time to time</a>. Even more rare are the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130813081423/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/10/stunningly_beautiful_calico_lobster.php">calico lobsters</a>, which represent one in every 30 million lobsters. But do they <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130813081423/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/04/lobster_french_toast.php">taste the same on French toast</a>?</p>

<p>Check out this freaky beast in the molting process, where they become almost translucent:</p>
