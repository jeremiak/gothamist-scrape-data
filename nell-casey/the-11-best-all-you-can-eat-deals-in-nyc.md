<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="012015becco.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20161219111233im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_nellcasey/012015becco.jpg" width="640" height="480"> <br> <i> (via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161219111233/https://foursquare.com/v/becco/3fd66200f964a5203de31ee3/photos?openPhotoId=51a4d9b1454a4797f70c3a86">Foursquare</a>)</i></div> <p></p>

<p><strong>BECCO</strong> She&apos;s busier with a <a href="www.eataly.com">little Flatiron food court</a> these days, but Lidia Bastianich&apos;s lovely Restaurant Row eatery still draws crowds with its flavorful Italian fare and budget-friendly $25 wine list. Carb fanatics know to order the Sinfonia di Paste ($24.95), which includes unlimited table side service of Chef William Gallagher&apos;s three daily pastas. Marinara, clam sauce, stuffed ravioli, cheese-covered gnocchi and other tasty pasta preparations have been part of the lineup. Plus, all the noodles are handmade and have that nice chewy texture not found in their dried counter parts. The meal also includes either Insalata Cesare or an Antipasto Misto to balance out the doughy gut bombs.</p>

<p><em>Becco is located at 355 W 46th Street in Midtown West, (212) 397-7597; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161219111233/http://becco-nyc.com/">becco-nyc.com</a></em></p>

<p><strong>CHURRASCARIA PLATAFORMA</strong> Like all Brazilian steakhouse, expect to be inundated with meat the moment you turn your personal dining card from red to green. Waiters with swords will quickly descend on your table, offering tempting cuts of beef from top sirloin, top round steak and garlic steak to haughtier cuts like filet mignon and short ribs. Apart from the cow, they&apos;ll also cut you slices of lamb chops, bacon-wrapped turkey, chicken thigh, pork ribs and even octopus, in addition to vegetarian grilled cheese and garlic bread.</p>

<p>We don&apos;t recommend vegetarians for this experience&#x2014;the smell of the charred flesh alone might be too much&#x2014;but the restaurant&apos;s included salad bar offers a hearty amount of vegetable, cheese and (for pescatarians) sushi options to make a meal. During dinner hours, carnivores can indulge in all-you-can-eat meat sweats for $62.95 (Sunday - Thursday) or $64.95 (Friday and Saturday), with options for Salad Bar only running $45.95 (Sunday - Thursday) and $47.95 (Friday and Saturday). Either way, don&apos;t miss the Brazilian cheesy bread.</p>

<p><strong>CLEMENTE&apos;S MARYLAND CRABHOUSE</strong> <strong>CLEMENTE&apos;S MARYLAND CRAB HOUSE</strong>: Most of what makes eating a steamed blue crab enjoyable is the art of cracking and opening it, a skill that is both impressive to newbies and permits you to eat with your hands. Unfortunately, crabs don&apos;t come with a lot of meat (though what they&apos;ve got is <em>delicious</em>) and if you&apos;re paying per pound, you don&apos;t get a lot of food for your buck. Blessedly, Clemente&apos;s in Sheepshead Bay boasts an All You Can Eat crab deal on Mondays and Tuesdays&#x2014;for $34.95, you get a unlimited supply of Maryland blue crab, along with french fries and corn on the cob. You can opt for garlic-style crabs or go for ones smothered in Old Bay like the God of Maryland intended. Just keep in mind that Clemente&apos;s is cash only. <em>(Rebecca Fishbein)</em></p>

<p><em>Clemente&apos;s Maryland Crabhouse is located at 3939 Emmons Avenue, (718) 646-7373; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161219111233/http://www.clementescrabhouse.com/">clementescrabhouse.com</a></em></p>

<strong>PICNIC GARDEN</strong> If you&apos;re looking for either a calm ambiance or a semblance of restraint, look elsewhere. But if you&apos;re game for getting your hands dirty (with meat, mind you) and smelling a bit like smokey animal flesh for the rest of the evening, this AYCE Korean spot in Queens&apos;s Murray Hill neighborhood is worth it. At the long central buffet, load up a plate with raw meats and vegetables like thinly sliced lamb and beef, octopus tentacles, slices of onion, shrimp and other grillables before heading back to your table.<br>
 <br>
Then, enter fire. Servers will oftentimes aid you in grilling the meat, though don&apos;t always expect to have the most attentive service. And while some of the meats are marinated, the restaurant also offers spices, salts and other toppings to help ramp up the flavors. In addition to the BBQ, the buffet table offers fried dumplings, seafood pancakes and dozens of other prepared foods to supplement the meatopia. Prices depend on time of day, day of the week and age (there are child prices), but expect to pay between $31.99 and $33.99 per person, plus expenses like beer and soju.<p></p>

<p><em>Picnic Garden is located at 14742 Northern Boulevard in Murray Hill, Queens, (718) 358-5959</em></p>
