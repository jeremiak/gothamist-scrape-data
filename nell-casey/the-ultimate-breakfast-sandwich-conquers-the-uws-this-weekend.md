Many New York-based farms and meat purveyors will be hoping for a win, which means they&apos;ll be bringing along some of their finest meaty creations including Serbian pistachio salami from Ridgewood European Pork Store and pit smoked Iowa Swabian Hall hog by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160904051846/http://gothamist.com/2015/09/08/pastrami_perfection_at_harry_and_id.php#photo-1">pastrami master</a> Will Horowitz from Ducks Eatery/Harry &amp; Ida&apos;s.

<p>Sunday evening, dine as they do in Spain at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160904051846/http://www.andanada141.com/">Andanada</a>, a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160904051846/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/01/2016_michelin_winners.php">Michelin-starred</a> eatery on West 69th Street. Beginning at 6 p.m., they&apos;ll take diners through a typical Sunday in the north of Spain, starting at the bar with <strong>Pintxos</strong>, small snacks like tortilla over a slice of bread, huevos rellenos and jamon. Nibble the bites over a glass of vermouth, as befits tradition, then prepare yourself for Cochinillo Asado, a whole suckling pig served with vegetables. The meal ends with dessert, if you still have room; the experience costs $68 (excluding tax, tip and beverages).  </p>
