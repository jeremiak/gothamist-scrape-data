<p>Acclaimed French chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten&apos;s fantastical bi-level homage to Southeast Asian street food <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161113145915/http://spicemarketrestaurants.com/">Spice Market</a> enters the clubstaurant history books when it closes at the end of September. The restaurant&apos;s landlord more or less gave the restaurant the boot, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161113145915/http://ny.eater.com/2016/8/23/12602982/spice-market-closing">Eater reports</a>, with the idea of offering the space to some kind of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161113145915/http://ny.eater.com/2016/5/23/11744744/spice-market-moving">&quot;experiential retail&quot;</a> brand.
