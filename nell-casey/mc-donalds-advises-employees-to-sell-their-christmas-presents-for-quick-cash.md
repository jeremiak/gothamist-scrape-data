<p><strong>Go on at least two vacations a year.</strong> Apparently this cuts your heart attack risk by 50%! You know what else cuts your risk of heart attack? Being <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508124030/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/29/fast_food_workers_in_nyc_walk_out_t.php">paid a living wage</a> so you&apos;re not struggling to make ends meet.</p>

<p><strong>Break your food into pieces.</strong> If you take smaller bites you&apos;ll probably eat less. Ahh yes, totally reasonable to take nutrition advice <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508124030/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/13/the_disgusting_depressing_truth_beh.php">from someone who really knows</a>. </p>

<p><strong>Eat cheese.</strong> But only small bites of cheese. Bonus points if you buy it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508124030/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/24/mcdonalds_advice_to_underpaid_worke.php">with your food stamps</a>!</p>

<p><strong>Sing out loud to lower blood pressure.</strong> I mean if <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508124030/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IHcp8Pl_X4">Justin Timberlake does</a> then by god you should too!</p>

<p><strong>Sell your unopened Christmas presents and other possessions on eBay or Craigslist.</strong> Just rip that brand new toy straight from your sobbing child&apos;s hand. They&apos;ll totally understand.</p>

<p><strong>Quit complaining.</strong> &quot;We told you how to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508124030/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/16/mcdonalds_helpfully_illustrates_tha.php">make a budget</a> what more do you want?!&quot;</p>
