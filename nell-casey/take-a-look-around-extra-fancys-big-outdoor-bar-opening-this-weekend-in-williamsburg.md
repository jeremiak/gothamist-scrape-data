					<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171023171748/http://www.extrafancybklyn.com/">Extra Fancy</a>, Williamsburg&apos;s version of an upscale New England seafood shack, debuts their large new outdoor bar this weekend, transforming an underutilized space adjacent to their Metropolitan Avenue restaurant into a chill spot to drink beer and frozen cocktails. The restaurant&apos;s had a darling little backyard previous to now, but the new side yard will accommodate more imbibers in a more casual setting, with counter service for drinks and an eventual food program.</p>

<p>In its previous life, the space was home to a Mobil gas station in the 1940s, the remnants of which can be seen in the converted cinderblock hut at the back, which has been repurposed into bathrooms. Now, instead of the used car lot that came next, it houses rows of picnic benches on gravel&#x2014;not dissimilar to Williamsburg&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171023171748/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/20/williamsburg_crown_vic_closing.php">soon to be shuttered</a> Crown Vic, though on a smaller scale. The space wasn&apos;t fully completed when we got a tour yesterday, but should be by opening day on Saturday.</p>

<p>There&apos;s going to be a lot on tap at the large bar up front, including the expected draft beers but also wine and cocktails through the lines. Beverage Director and co-owner Rob Krueger will also be expanding on the frozen drink selection, building on the popularity of their Froz&#xE9;monade&#x2014;frozen ros&#xE9; wine and lemonade&#x2014;and a Frozen Gin Tonic with a cucumber blended in. Their big Clam Bakes and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171023171748/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/03/lobster_bisque_fries_is_poutine_for.php#photo-1">Lobster Bisque Fries</a> won&apos;t be available outside, but co-owner Mark Rancourt tells us to expect shellfish by the pound and, possibly, a raw bar.</p>

<p>For this weekend&apos;s opening festivities they&apos;re celebrating with a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171023171748/http://www.extrafancybklyn.com/new-events-1/2016/5/14/3rd-annual-crawfish-boil">Crawfish Boil</a> on Saturday from noon until 4 p.m. Brooklyn Brewery&apos;s doing a tap takeover for the event, and a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171023171748/http://www.extrafancybklyn.com/new-events-1/2016/5/14/3rd-annual-crawfish-boil">$30 ticket</a> ($35 at the door) gets you one pint plus &quot;plenty&apos;o&apos;crawfish.&quot; </p>

<p>The side yard will be open this weekend, Saturday and Sunday, May 14th and 15th, from noon until midnight on Saturday and noon until 11 p.m. on Sunday. After this weekend, the side yard also be open on Fridays from 6 p.m. until midnight in addition to Saturdays and Sundays.</p>

<p><em>302 Metropolitan Avenue, Williamsburg</em></p>
