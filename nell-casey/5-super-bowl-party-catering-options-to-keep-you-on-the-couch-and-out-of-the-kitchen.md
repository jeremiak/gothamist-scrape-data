<p>It&apos;s just like 2008 all over again, with our New York Giants poised to lay the smackdown on the Patriots in Super Bowl XLVI. Though the big day is still two weeks away, it&apos;s not too early to think about how you&apos;ll be celebrating the biggest game/commercial phantasmagoria of the year. To save you from slaving away in the kitchen, we&apos;ve put together a list of good catering options for your football fete so you can focus on the important things&#x2014;like watching pretty boy Tom Brady get his butt whupped by the Giants defensive line.</p>

<p>Wings are to football what hot dogs are to baseball and no self-respecting football fan would host a Super Bowl party without them. Tried and true chain <strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140223005716/http://www.atomicwings.com/site/catering.php">Atomic Wings</a></strong> has got you covered when it comes to fiery fowl. Choose 50 wings for $42.49 or 100 wings for $81.99, in either regular or boneless varieties, all smothered in one of Atomic Wings signature sauces, which range from &quot;mild&quot; to &quot;suicidal.&quot; All wing orders come with ranch or blue cheese dip and &quot;heaps of celery and carrots.&quot; It&apos;ll be like college all over again! The chain also offers options like wafer fries, mozzarella sticks and salads to supplement your fowl fiesta. </p>

<p>Also traditional to a football party: the hero. Midtown&apos;s <strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140223005716/http://heroboy.com/index.php?cPath=29">Manganaro&apos;s Hero-Boy</a></strong> offers a 3-foot hero of your choice plus a &quot;party pak&quot; (Rigatoni Pesto, Mesculin Salad with homemade Italian dressing and 5lbs. of Potato Chips as well as utensils, plates, napkins, tablecloth and condiments) all for only $200 ($135 for just the hero). They also offer a wide variety of hot and cold Italian specialties, salads and desserts if you&apos;re looking for something more substantial.</p>

<p>Park Slope pup purveyor <strong>Bark Hot Dogs</strong> will take you out to the <strike>ball park</strike> stadium with their hot dogs, sausages and sliders. Choose from a variety of meat and veggie options, priced between $40 and $180 to serve 10 or 25 people. Traditional toppings are gratis but one or five pound tubs of Bark Cole Slaw, Hawthorne Valley Sauerkraut or Grafton Cheddar Sauce will cost extra. No need to go on a beer run either! 64oz growlers of Six Point Craft Ales are available and priced at a reasonable $18 each plus a $3 deposit. Bark even goes the extra mile and provides delivery within Manhattan and Brooklyn (for a fee). </p>

<p>Sure, sushi isn&apos;t typical football fare, but that&apos;s what will make your Super Bowl party one for the ages. <strong>The Sushi Catering</strong> offers a variety of sushi platters to fit any palate. The platters range in price from $32, for an all vegetarian option, to $125 for a platter with 86 pieces of nigiri sushi and sushi rolls. All the familiar characters&#x2014;like California and Spicy Tuna rolls&#x2014;are represented and some platters also include The Sushi Catering&apos;s special rolls, like the Sushi Sandwich, a tasty combination of spicy salmon, tempura crunch, crab, eel, avocado and tobiko. Best of all, they only need your order placed by 3 p.m. the day before, which is great news if you find yourself throwing a party last-minute. </p>

<p>Nothing sops up gallons of alcohol like delicious meat, especially when that meat is slow smoked and covered in tangy BBQ sauce. Enter <strong>Wildwood Barbeque</strong> who want to fill your boozy belly with ribs, brisket and all the trimmings. Depending on the size of your party&#x2014;and just how many Kansas City Baby Back Ribs you can shove down your gullet&#x2014;Wildwood will put together a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140223005716/http://www.wildwoodbbq.com/menus-and-food">combination of meats and sides</a> any carnivore will adore. Texas Smoked Brisket, Pulled Lamb Shoulder and Aged Cheddar Mac &amp; Cheese are just some of the savory options and they even tack on dessert for the sweet tooths at your party. But why settle for bits and pieces when you can have the WHOLE HOG? Wildwood will smoke up a whole pig (the smallest swine weighs 40 lbs and feeds 18-20 people) complete with coleslaw, cornbread and another side of your choice all to the tune of $575. Sure, that might seem like a lot of money but this is the <em>Super Bowl</em>, people! You&apos;re doing it for the team.</p>
