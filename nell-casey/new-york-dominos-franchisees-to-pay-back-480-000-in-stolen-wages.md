<p>Three Domino&apos;s franchisees which were accused of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170311204857/http://gothamist.com/2016/05/24/dominos_pizza_wage_theft.php">appalling wage theft</a> at 10 different locations across New York State have agreed to pay back the workers they ripped off. Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman announced a settlement with the three operators today; collectively they will pay out $480,000 in restitution to hundreds of employees of their restaurants for alleged wage theft and overtime violations. </p>

<p>Shueb Ahmed and Anthony Maestri, who own eight stores in New York, Nassau and Westchester Counties, along with Matthew Denman, who owns two stores in Montgomery County, will pay out $150,000, $240,000, and $90,000 respectively after being sued in part of a larger lawsuit with Domino&apos;s corporate.</p>

<p>Schneiderman&apos;s been on a huge tear recently regarding Domino&apos;s. His office blew the lid on Domino&apos;s corporate &quot;PULSE&quot; computer payroll system, which was revealed to routinely under-calculate employee earnings and overtime, a fact that was known to Domino&apos;s but was never fixed. The Attorney General&apos;s office sued the franchise owners&#x2014;who in this case have been dropped from the suit following the settlement&#x2014;along with Domino&apos;s corporate.</p>

<p>&quot;The Attorney General has now settled investigations into labor law violations at 71 Domino&apos;s franchise locations in New York State, owned by fifteen individual franchisees. These locations comprise more than half of the franchise stores and over a third of the total number of Domino&apos;s stores in New York,&quot; Schneiderman&apos;s office said in a release. &quot;The Attorney General&apos;s office has secured nearly $2 million in total restitution for Domino&apos;s workers statewide through these settlements.&quot;</p>

<p>Domino&apos;s has a terrible track record with wage violation accusations and a similar suit brought on by delivery workers at one Manhattan franchise resulted in a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170311204857/http://gothamist.com/2014/02/01/dominos_delivery_workers_win_128_mi.php">$1.28 million settlement</a> following allegations of flaunting overtime and minimum wage laws. </p>
