<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141027010517/http://gothamist.com/2008/04/05/urban_farming.php#photo-1">urban farming scene</a> is really <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141027010517/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/27/ramps.php">ramping up</a> and Whole Foods is getting in on the action! The company <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141027010517/http://media.wholefoodsmarket.com/news/whole-foods-marketr-and-gotham-greens-to-build-nations-first-commercial-sca">announced today</a> a partnership with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141027010517/http://gothamgreens.com/">Gotham Greens</a> to build a new rooftop farm on top of their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141027010517/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/05/gowanus_whole_foods_will_almost_wra.php">forthcoming Gowanus location</a>. The partnership will produce the &quot;nation&apos;s first commercial scale greenhouse farm integrated within a retail grocery space.&quot;</p>

<p>The 20,000 square foot farm would produce pesticide-free produce atop the grocer and would provide veggies not only for the Gowanus location but also for other Whole Foods throughout the city. The farm will also operate year-round and use efficient energy and water delivery systems, including an advanced irrigation system that uses 20 times less water than typical farms and lots of solar panels. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141027010517/http://newyork.grubstreet.com/2013/04/whole-foods-gowanus-gotham-greens-rooftop-garden.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+nymag%2Fgrubstreet+%28Grub+Street+-+nymag.com%27s+Food+and+Restaurant+Blog%29">GrubStreet got word</a> that the farm will grow a variety of lettuces, herbs and other leafy greens like kale, plus tomatoes and other vegetables throughout the year. </p>

<p>Add this farm to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141027010517/http://gothamist.com/2012/08/02/brooklyn_grange_celebrates_first_ha.php">massive Brooklyn Grange</a> and it&apos;s easy to see a future with farms on every roof! In some cases, that&apos;s probably better than <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141027010517/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/14/signs_at_whole_foods_gowanus_locati.php">growing anything in the ground</a>.</p>
