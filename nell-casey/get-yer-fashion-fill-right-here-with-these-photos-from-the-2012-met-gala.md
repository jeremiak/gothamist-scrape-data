</div></div>					<p>Last night Hollywood startlets and sports heroes descended on the Metropolitan Museum of Art for the museum&apos;s annual gala, this year honoring a new Costume Institute exhibition called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505201847/http://www.metmuseum.org/impossibleconversations">Schiaparelli and Prada: Impossible Conversations</a>. The exhibit explores the work of the two Italian designers and &quot;suggests new readings of their most innovative work,&quot; according to the museum&apos;s introduction. While the actual exhibit was inside the museum, last night&apos;s show took place on the red carpet where stars strutted and posed for photographers on the steps, all dolled up in (mostly) delightful designer duds.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505201847/http://gothamist.com/tags/beyonce">Beyonce</a> showed off her post-Blue Ivy body in a sheer Givenchy gown that left absolutely nothing to the imagination except perhaps how she could look so svelte a mere four months after giving birth. Celebrities, they&apos;re <strike>just like</strike> absolutely nothing like us! Carey Mulligan sported a striking Prada sequined halter dress, while Rihanna slithered in a form-fitting, alligator skin Tom Ford gown. </p>

<p>It wasn&apos;t just the ladies looking sharp. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505201847/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/21/oh_dear_god_jets_acquire_tim_tebow.php">Newly crowned Jet Tim Tebow</a> attended the event&#x2014;perhaps looking to get more NYC street cred before his big debut this fall. The former Bronco&apos;s quarterback donned a Ralph Lauren tuxedo and according to The Hollywood Reporter was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505201847/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/fash-track/tim-tebow-met-ball-dianna-agron-321147">very excited to meet Anna Wintour</a>. Other football royalty attended, namely New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady, who looked sharp in a velvet Tom Ford blazer, tuxedo pants and the &quot;World&apos;s Best Fashion Accessory&quot;: wife Gisele Bundchen. His clothes may have garnered some &quot;Ooos&quot; but his hair&#x2014;as has been the case <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505201847/http://gothamist.com/2010/10/12/stylist_tells_tom_brady_to_get_a_da.php">for several years now</a>&#x2014;was definitely more &quot;Eww.&quot; </p>

<p>Not everyone hit the bull&apos;s eye this year, however... Marc Jacobs&apos;s head scratching ensemble, for example, was just confusing&#x2014;sure, he&apos;s a handsome fellow with a well-toned physique so why not show it off in a sheer, lace dress, but we would have chosen some sexier boxer shorts to wear underneath. Plus, bedazzled pilgrim shoes! Still, fashion is about risks and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505201847/http://www.styleite.com/media/marc-jacobs-met-gala-2012/">according to  Styleite</a>, the designer said his choice was a tribute to the night&apos;s honorees and a &quot;celebration of the unconventional.&quot; Sadly, model and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505201847/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/02/heres_the_kate_upton_cat_daddy_biki.php">Gothamist eye candy</a> Kate Upton disappointed with an ill-fitting Michael Kors gown and over-wrought, painted eyebrows. She would have looked better if she&apos;d shown up in her <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505201847/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/01/watch_kate_upton_do_cat_daddy_dance.php">&quot;Cat Daddy&quot; bikini</a>. </p>

<p>We assembled some of the most interesting looks of the evening and invite you to sit back, click through, and gawk at the shiny objects.</p>
