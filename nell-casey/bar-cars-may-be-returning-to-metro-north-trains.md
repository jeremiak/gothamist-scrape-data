<p>In 2014, riders on Metro-North&apos;s New Haven line <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031071828/http://gothamist.com/2014/05/10/photos_video_farewell_metro-norths.php#photo-1">chugged their final Budweiser</a>, when the MTA <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031071828/http://gothamist.com/2014/05/06/metro-north_kills_their_last_bar_ca.php">decommissioned the last bar car</a> to make way for the fleet of new M-8 trains. And thus it was back to furtive sips from paper bags for daily commuters to Connecticut. There&apos;s room for hope, however, with a rumor the bar cars are set to return, once again bringing happy hour to the rails.</p>

<p>Governor Dannel P. Malloy may be announcing the return of bar cars as early as this Friday, sources <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031071828/http://www.ctpost.com/local/article/Sources-Bar-cars-returning-to-New-Haven-Line-9215401.php">told the CT Post</a>. The Governor is expected to reveal plans to purchase 60 new M-8 rail cars, 10 of which are expected to be of the bar variety. The Governor&apos;s office did not immediately return requests for comment and CT Department of Transportation declined to comment when asked about the bar cars&apos; return.</p>

<p>But this move tracks with statements by transit officials, who&apos;ve <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031071828/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/10/nyregion/at-the-end-of-the-line-a-final-toast-to-the-bar-car.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">hinted at the possibility</a> of outfitting their new fleet with special compartments for drinking. </p>

<p>While bar sales may have been in decline, there was a steadfast group of regulars who mourned the bars&apos; retirement. &quot;This commute is miserable&#x2026;and there&apos;s one car on this train where everyone is happy,&quot; one rider <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031071828/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUbAaT-C-Ec">told the Associated Press</a>. Fans say the bar cars offered a sense of community, much like a beloved dive or neighborhood pub. And a way to get sloshed before retreating back to one&apos;s miserable life and horrible children in the suburbs. </p>
