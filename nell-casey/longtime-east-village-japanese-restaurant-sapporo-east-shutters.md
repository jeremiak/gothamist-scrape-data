<p>What was just an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140209095905/http://evgrieve.com/2014/01/concern-about-sapporo-east.html">anxiety-producing rumor</a> has turned out to be true: East Village sushi standby Sapporo East <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140209095905/http://evgrieve.com/2014/01/claim-sapporo-east-has-closed-for-good.html">has rolled its last maki</a>. EV Grieve bears the bad news, saying a &quot;very reliable source&quot; told them the restaurant had closed for good. The blog also notes that nearby sister restaurant Shima has also gone dark; neither restaurant offered anything in the way of explanation.</p>

<p>The casual First Avenue staple had been serving the neighborhood since 1983 with excellent bento boxes, sushi and ramen at refreshingly reasonable prices. In a time when sushi has become <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140209095905/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/15/sushi_nakazawa.php">something of a spectacle</a>, this humble gem was there to remind us sometimes there&apos;s nothing better than a California Roll among friends. Pour out another glass to sake for the East Village&apos;s soul. </p>
