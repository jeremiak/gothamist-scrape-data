<p>Comic books and craft beer team up once again this year to &#x201C;strike fear into the heart of those who would forget the virtues of true beer.&#x201D; Brooklyn Brewery and New York Comic Con organizer ReedPOP unveiled the newest superhero on the beer scene: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150514103406/http://brooklynbrewery.com/blog/news/the-brooklyn-defender-returns-new-york-comic-con-rises-from-the-brewery-921/">Brooklyn Defender</a>, an American Black Ale with &quot;dark malt visage and hopping finish that protects the city from the scourge of tasteless beers.&quot; </p>

<p>The sick label design comes from famous logo designer Milton Glaser and comic book artist <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150514103406/http://www.cliffchiang.com/">Cliff Chiang</a>, who channeled the darker notes of the beer to create a more intimidating hero from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150514103406/http://gothamist.com/2012/09/26/brooklyn_brewerys_limited_edition_c.php#photo-1">last year&apos;s incarnation</a>. </p>

<p>The dark brew makes its debut at a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150514103406/http://www.newyorkcomiccon.com/Whats-Happening/Events-I-Q/NYCC-Beer/">release party</a> at Brooklyn Brewery on September 21st with an open bar and special guests. Then a handful of bars will host Pint Nights, during which imbibers of the beer get a limited edition Brooklyn Defender pint glass and possibly a 3-Day Comic Con ticket.
