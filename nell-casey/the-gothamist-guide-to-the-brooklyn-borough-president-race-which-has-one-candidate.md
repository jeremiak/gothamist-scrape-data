<p>Just like the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422213431/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/22/the_gothamist_guide_to_the_queens_b.php">other</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422213431/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/14/the_gothamist_guide_to_the_manhatta.php">borough presidents</a>, the Brooklyn Borough President has very little real power within the city government. Instead, the office acts as an advisor to the Mayor, the City Council and other government groups that do have the power to make big changes to the city. They help dictate land usage, working with developers while protecting the character of their boroughs. The borough president also receives a percentage of the capital budget to distribute as they see fit.</p>

<p>During his tenure as Brooklyn&apos;s mascot, Marty Markowitz changed the landscape of Brooklyn, approving dozens of real estate projects and developments in the borough. He also founded his own not for profit, Best of Brooklyn, which he funded in part from his office and also from the aforementioned real estate projects, who earned his favor with donations. Redevelopment and rejuvenation projects like Atlantic Yards and the superfund site Gowanus Canal are just a few of the items on the docket for the next president. </p>

<p><strong>2013 Manhattan Borough President Candidate:</strong></p>

<p></p><li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422213431/http://www.ericadams2013.com/">Eric Adams</a> (D): Native New Yorker and former NYPD Captain; current State Senator in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422213431/http://www.nysenate.gov/district/20">20th Senate District</a>.</li><p></p>

<p>We asked each candidate for Brooklyn Borough President to answer a questionnaire for their positions on issues facing the borough, as well as some personal information relevant to the job. In this race, there&apos;s only one candidate&#x2014;a judge forced Adams&apos;s lone rival, John Gangemi, to drop out after the Board of Elections <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422213431/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/exclusive-brooklyn-borough-president-hopeful-eric-adams-running-article-1.1421949">determined that more than two-thirds of the signatures</a> on his ballot petition were invalid. (For more on Adams, here&apos;s an in-depth profile the next Brooklyn Borough President <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422213431/http://www.cityandstateny.com/the-unlikely-borough-president/">in City and State</a>.) </p>

<p>We&apos;ll be publishing this questionnaire for other races, including Public Advocate, Comptroller and Mayor, as soon as we receive responses from each candidate.</p>
