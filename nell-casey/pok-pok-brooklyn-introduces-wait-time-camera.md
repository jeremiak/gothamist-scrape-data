										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429132144im_/http://gothamist.com/upload/2012/04/pokpok-sam-horine-7.jpg" width="640" height="427"> <br> <i> The crowds wait patiently outside (Sam Horine/Gothamist)<br></i></div> <p></p>

<p>Now you&apos;ll know just how long of a wait you have for those <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429132144/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/10/pok_pok_brings_cultishly_loved_chic.php">deliciously lacquered chicken wings</a>. Andy Ricker has taken a page from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429132144/http://gothamist.com/2006/04/18/breaking_shake.php">Danny Meyer&apos;s playbook</a> and implemented a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429132144/https://www.facebook.com/andyricker/posts/10152486858586542?">live webcam</a> that shows the estimated wait time to get into his perennially packed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429132144/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/20/photos_pok_pok_brings_authentic_tha.php">Pok Pok</a> restaurant in Brooklyn. From 4:30 p.m. to midnight, the cam broadcasts <strike>a view of the line</strike> a whiteboard that&apos;s updated by staff with the current wait time. </p>

<p>It&apos;s less visually fulfilling than <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429132144/http://www.shakeshack.com/location/madison-square-park/#shack-cam">Shake Shack&apos;s window into the madness</a> of Madison Square Park, but will let you know if you should order another round before trekking out to Columbia Heights. The cam is visible <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429132144/http://www.pokpokny.com/home/">on the restaurant&apos;s website</a>&#x2014;which at the moment appears to be at capacity&#x2014;or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429132144/https://www.dropcam.com/p/zvse2a">directly at Dropcam</a>. </p>

<p>Queuing has become de rigueur for diners at the increasing number of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429132144/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/23/breaking_new_yorkers_wait_hours_to.php">no-reservation restaurants</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429132144/http://gothamist.com/tags/cronut">viral foodstuffs</a>. It&apos;s actually shocking that a Cronut Cam hasn&apos;t been installed yet. You <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429132144/http://gothamist.com/2006/04/18/breaking_shake.php">heard it here first</a>!</p>
