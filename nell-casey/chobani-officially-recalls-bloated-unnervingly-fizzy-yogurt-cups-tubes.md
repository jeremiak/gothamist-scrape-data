<p>Exploding yogurt makes breakfast exciting! After days of attempted damage control following mold contamination in its products, Chobani Yogurt has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151022222735/http://bigstory.ap.org/article/chobani-recalls-some-greek-yogurt-cups">officially recalled</a> batches of yogurt that had been making consumers ill. Chobani eaters had been taking to the company&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151022222735/https://www.facebook.com/Chobani">Facebook page</a> to report cups that were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151022222735/https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10201756043446464&amp;set=p.10201756043446464&amp;type=1">&quot;ready to explode&quot;</a> and yogurt that tasted like it had been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151022222735/https://www.facebook.com/Chobani/posts/10151562226446852">&quot;mixed with bitter seltzer, fizz or pop rocks</a>.&quot; </p>

<p>On Saturday, the brand <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151022222735/http://chobani.com/community/blog/2013/08/quality-promise/">released a letter</a> to customers explaining they&apos;d removed products from shelves but did not announce an official recall. Four days later, the company revealed that an Idaho plant&#x2014;perhaps <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151022222735/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/16/new_york_yogurt_darling_chobanis_ne.php">this one</a>?&#x2014;had been tainted with a &quot;type of mold commonly found in the dairy environment,&quot; but still refused to issue a recall. Finally, this morning the company capitulated and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151022222735/http://bigstory.ap.org/article/chobani-recalls-some-greek-yogurt-cups">recalled the tainted yogurt products</a>. </p>

<p>So how do you know if your yogurt will give you stomach cramps, diarrhea, an itchy, sore throat and migraines? Look for the 16-012 code and an expiration date between 9/11/13 and 10/7/13 and any suspicious activity in your refrigerator. </p>
