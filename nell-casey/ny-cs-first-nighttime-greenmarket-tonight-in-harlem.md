										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="101112harlemmarket.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427001354im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_nellcasey/101112harlemmarket.jpg" width="640" height="283" class="image-none"> </span> </p>

<p>Grabbing fresh groceries post-commute will be much easier for Harlem residents this evening at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427001354/http://www.grownyc.org/blog/#post-305">Harlem Pop-Up Greenmarket</a>, the first ever nighttime farmer&apos;s market in the city&apos;s (recent) history. From 4 p.m. until 9 p.m. a group of Greenmarket purveyors and local Harlem businesses sell their products inside the Treasure Chest Flea Market on West 117th Street and Frederick Douglas Boulevard. </p>

<p>Until now, many commuters missed out on purchasing locally-sourced products, as farmer&apos;s markets traditionally operate during the day and close up shop before most people clocked out in the evening. &#x201C;The idea is to link our rural and urban communities and provide opportunities for all New Yorkers,&#x201D; Michael Hurwitz, Greenmarket&#x2019;s director, told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427001354/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/uptown/farmer-market-opens-night-harlem-article-1.1179659#ixzz290LvadYd">the Daily News</a>. &#x201C;You can&#x2019;t always get to the market and shop during the day if you&#x2019;re working.&#x201D;</p>

<p>The one-off market&#x2014;organizers hope this will be the first of many such late-night markets in NYC&#x2014;features eight farms, apiaries, wineries and the like, selling a variety of fresh vegetables and fruits, dairy products and other regional specialties. Nearby <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427001354/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/23/spanish_harlem_non-profit_bakery_op.php#photo-1">Hot Bread Kitchen</a> will supply multi-ethnic artisan baked goods and local restaurants like the Ethiopian <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427001354/http://www.zomanyc.com/">Zoma</a> and hot spot <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427001354/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/24/a_food_drink_tour_of_harlem.php#photo-8">Harlem Tavern</a> will provide ready-made meals to time-strapped strap hangers. </p>

<p>Live music and refreshments keep things festive and, in keeping with the season, an on-site pumpkin patch will be open for Jack O&apos; Lantern selection. Shoppers have the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427001354/http://www.grownyc.org/blog/#post-305">option of using cash, credit/debit or EBT/SNAP benefits</a>, an added bonus for traditionally cash-only outdoor markets. If you can&apos;t make it to tonight&apos;s big test run, the nearby <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427001354/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/12/125th_street_farmers_market_returns.php">125th Street Farmer&apos;s Market</a> runs until 7 p.m. on Tuesdays through November.</p>
