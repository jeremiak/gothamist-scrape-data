</div></div>					<p>This weekend, the world&apos;s most <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160923060936/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/24/the_only_good_brunch_is_a_dead_brun.php">persecuted</a> meal&#x2014;tacked on as an afterthought or necessity at some restaurants&#x2014;makes its grand debut front and center as the meal du jour every day at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160923060936/https://www.facebook.com/Project-Brunch-1507020392937232/?fref=ts">Project Brunch</a>. It might surprise some to find out this spot isn&apos;t opening in Brunchlyn or neighboring Brunchatten, but on Staten Island, where owners Jodi Guagliardo and Nicholas Granata are betting big on the typical midday meal.</p>

<p>In a way, their experiment has already been a success, as the restaurant has a significant online presence before even opening, boasting over 3,000 follows <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160923060936/https://www.instagram.com/projectbrunchsi/">on Instagram</a> since launching the account two months ago. &quot;Mostly what I can&apos;t get over is the response on social media&#x2014;people look forward to my daily posts,&quot; Guagliardo <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160923060936/http://www.silive.com/dining/index.ssf/2016/02/project_brunch_south_shore_res.html">told SI Live</a> back in February, when their following was even more modest. The account features mostly food photos, like their plentifully-topped waffles and pancakes and their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160923060936/https://www.instagram.com/p/BBne0eTAVQ0/?taken-by=projectbrunchsi">speciality drinks</a>, which seem to have taken a page out of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160923060936/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/27/black_tap_milkshake_insanity.php">viral milkshake handbook</a>. </p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="033015brunchint.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160923060936im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_nellcasey/033015brunchint.jpg" width="640" height="515"> <br> <i> (via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160923060936/https://www.facebook.com/1507020392937232/photos/pb.1507020392937232.-2207520000.1459367236./1528344920804779/?type=3&amp;theater">Facebook</a>)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>The restaurant won&apos;t just focus on gut-busting sweet dishes, or enormous platters of corned beef hash&#x2014;though both will be on the menu. Guagliardo promises more lunch-skewing items like chicken salad and pulled pork sandwiches, and even more healthful options like their &quot;Cali Sandwich&quot; with grilled chicken, arugula, alfalfa sprouts, tomatoes and avocado topped with honey mustard aioli on whole wheat multigrain and a build-your-own salad option. &quot;We have a small chest freezer for ice cream but everything else is fresh. All the sauces and dressings are made from scratch,&quot; Guagliardo says.</p>

<p>Unlike most restaurants, which only offer a weekend brunch, Project Brunch will operate daily beginning at 6 a.m. and closing daily at 3 p.m., making it more of an cafe with a breakfast bent. But for people working alternative schedules, it&apos;s a way to get a waffle fix outside of visiting a diner for whatever powdered version they may be offering there. One thing they won&apos;t have: brunch staple cocktails like bloody mary&apos;s and mimosas. There&apos;s no alcohol on the menu as of opening, but it hasn&apos;t been ruled out for the future and, given the driving culture on the Island, probably best left alone anyway. </p>
