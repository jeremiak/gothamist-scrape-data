<p>Pour out your sarsaparilla for Broadway&apos;s vaguely cowboy-themed diner Silver Spurs; the NYU student staple will hit the dusty trail and serve its last Texan Omelette this Sunday. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429092521/http://evgrieve.com/2013/12/after-34-years-silver-spurs-is-closing.html#.UrREwyxYmvU.twitter">EV Grieve</a> brings us the sad news from 9th Street, where a sign posted in the diner&apos;s window reveals the 34-year-old joint&apos;s lease expired and they will be vacating their longstanding occupancy on the corner. </p>

<p>When I started at NYU in 2002, Silver Spurs&apos; proximity to my dorm made it my go-to greasy spoon for Saturday breakfasts or a quick plate of cheese fries after classes. Sure, the food wasn&apos;t anything exceptional, but the menu&apos;s funny vernacular&#x2014;eggs were ovals, z&apos;s popped up where they didn&apos;t belong and there was running commentary from some deranged cowboy&#x2014;made it a quirky favorite amongst my friends. </p>

<p>The diner&apos;s second location on Laguardia Place will remain open to sate colossal burger and grilled cheeze cravings. As for the soon to be vacant Broadway spot, insert sad-but-true retail bank joke here. </p>
