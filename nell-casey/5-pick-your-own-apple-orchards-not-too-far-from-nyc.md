<p>It may be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141007083641/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/07/how_do_you_like_dem_apples_its_cide.php">Cider Week</a> here in New York City but area farms are celebrating the apple all month long and further into November. Sure, you could pick up a peck at your local farmer&apos;s market, but picking your own fruit off the tree just makes it taste better! You&apos;ll have to put in a little effort, but making the trip to a local orchard is a romantic and affordable way to score large amounts of fruit for small prices, perfect for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141007083641/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/07/when_life_gives_you_apples_make_app.php">trying your hand at applesauce</a> or saving up for a Thanksgiving Pie.
