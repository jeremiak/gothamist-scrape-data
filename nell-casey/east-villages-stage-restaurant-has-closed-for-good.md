<p>The Stage Restaurant, which has been shuttered since <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160711234306/http://gothamist.com/2015/04/01/stage_restaurant_gas_closed.php">shady gas piping</a> was discovered in the basement last spring, will not be reopening. The restaurant&apos;s owner, Roman Diakun, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160711234306/https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=1349045125121683&amp;id=179865982039609">announced on Facebook</a> that the 35-year-old restaurant could not overcome losses in profit and the struggle of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160711234306/http://gothamist.com/2015/04/14/stage_restaurant_eviction.php">fighting an eviction</a> and decided to shutter the restaurant entirely. Another heartbreaking entry in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160711234306/http://vanishingnewyork.blogspot.com/2016/03/the-stage.html">Jeremiah Moss&apos;s mission</a> to #SaveNYC. </p>

<p>&quot;Over the past year, we have resolved our dispute with the landlord and Icon Realty Management,&quot; Diakun explained. &quot;Stage Restaurant never engaged in any wrongdoing; however, after our prolonged closure and because of the cost to make the repairs and expenses of reopening, we are sad to say that the Stage cannot reopen.&quot;</p>

<p>Stage&apos;s problems began after the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160711234306/http://gothamist.com/tags/eastvillageexplosion">catastrophic East Village explosion</a> that killed two, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160711234306/http://gothamist.com/2015/03/28/thursdays_east_village_explosion_to.php">wiped out three other restaurants</a> and prompted <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160711234306/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/20/gas_line_inspections_have_spiked_si.php">an increase in inspections</a> and heightened awareness of potential gas line issues. A Con Edison inspection revealed the gas siphoning, prompting a gas shut off and a stop work order by the DOB. The building&apos;s landlord, Icon Realty, claimed restaurant owner Roman Diakun had been siphoning gas from pipes meant to feed the residential units, an allegation Diakun continues to deny.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160711234306/http://gothamist.com/2015/04/11/petition_aims_to_open_shuttered_sta.php">petition</a> started by Diakun&apos;s son and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160711234306/http://gothamist.com/2015/05/01/stage_restaurant_help.php">funds raised</a> to fight the eviction were apparently not enough to recoup losses from the many months the restaurant was unable to reopen. &quot;The landlord has doubled the rent and wants the Stage out of there one way or another,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160711234306/https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10208322661485606&amp;set=ms.c.eJwzNDAysDA2MrcwsTQwNDWyNNQzhIgYmZkZmliYmhmYAQB~_KQcJ.bps.a.10207101140348341.1073741827.1276328882&amp;type=3&amp;theater">according to Robert Brenner</a>. </p>

<p>&quot;Thank you all for your support, your signatures, your donations, and especially your kind words. We could not have realized our passion and love for nourishing and providing a place of comfort and gathering to the community without you all,&quot; Diakun continued. &quot;Your loyalty, support, kindness and love have been a true blessing, and something we will never forget. &quot;</p>
