<p>In advance of US Veterans Day this coming Monday, Starbucks has announced a commitment to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501161406/http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/11/06/us-starbucks-veterans-idUSBRE9A50E120131106">hire at least 10,000 military veterans</a> and spouses of active military within the next five years. The coffee chain hopes to tap into the large pool of vets from Iraq and Afghanistan. &quot;[Veterans] bring an understanding of other cultures and they&apos;re accustomed to working with diverse and international partners,&quot; explained Starbucks director Robert Gates, former US Defense Secretary.&quot;This demographic represents one of the most underutilized talent pools in our country.&quot;</p>

<p>The move expands on the mentoring program the chain already operates through the Armed Forces Network; specialized recruiters will be brought in to facilitate placement within the company. &quot;This is not only about hiring baristas,&quot; Chief Executive Howard Schultz told Reuters. The company has been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501161406/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/05/hold_on_to_your_caramel_macchiatos.php">expanding rapidly</a>, with plans for 20,000 stores worldwide by 2014. Veterans&apos; experience with &quot;building and managing complex, global supply chains&quot; would help facilitate growth around the world as well as nationally. Hopefully this and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501161406/http://www.king5.com/news/aerospace/Boeing-pays-tribute-to-veterans--by-hiring-them-178247151.html">similar initiatives</a> can also bring down the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501161406/http://www.npr.org/2013/11/06/243325304/starbucks-is-latest-company-aiming-to-help-vets-land-jobs">high unemployment rates</a> that plague veterans in this country.</p>

<p>In addition to the new hiring spree, the Seattle-based chain will operate five revenue-sharing stores close by to military bases. The company will donate 10 cents from every sale to locally-affiliated charities, starting with Goodwill Industries International Inc programs Operation Good Jobs, in San Antonio, Texas and Vested in Vets, in Lakewood, Washington. </p>
