<p>Culinary bad boy and TV personality <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504165139/http://gothamist.com/2013/12/10/anthony_bourdain_talks_film_appreci.php">Anthony Bourdain</a> is planning to open a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504165139/http://pagesix.com/2014/01/09/anthony-bourdain-to-open-world-food-market/">large-scale food market</a> somewhere in Manhattan in the near future. The Post gets word that the market will feature &quot;cuisines from all around the world&quot; with a particular focus on the street food of Singapore. Bourdain also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504165139/http://ny.eater.com/archives/2014/01/anthony_bourdain_is_planning_a_massive_nyc_food_market.php">revealed to Eater</a> that he&apos;s hoping to bring &quot;street food and hawkers legends from around the world&quot; as well as &quot;dream&quot; chefs and operators plus local talents. </p>

<p>The location of the market, which will be developed with entrepreneur Stephen Werther, has yet to be revealed, but it&apos;s going to be part of a larger development project. The Post speculates it will likely be inside 3 World Trade Center or Hudson Yards; there&apos;s also the possibility of expansion beyond NYC. No opening date has been set, but the team plans to do pop-up previews between now and then, which will showcase different elements of the market. Perhaps we&apos;ll be sampling some <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504165139/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/20/would_anthony_bourdain_eat_human_fl.php">unusual meats</a> sometime soon.</p>
