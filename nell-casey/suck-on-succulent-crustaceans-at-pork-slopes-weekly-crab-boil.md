<p>It may be known mainly for its porcine prowess, but Brooklyn&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130823214849/http://www.porkslopebrooklyn.com/">Pork Slope</a> is getting in on the summertime grub with its first ever Crab Boil. Starting tomorrow at 5 p.m., diners can get down and dirty with a classic crab boil with blue crabs, corn, potatoes and sausage. </p>

<p>Throw down $28 and you&apos;ll get six succulent crabs; $54 dollars and you&apos;ll get 12 clawed crustaceans, plus every order gets a generous portion of all the fixins to go along with it to complete your classic boil. Be sure to order extra napkins&#x2014;we really meant it about down and dirty&#x2014;plus lots of ice cold beer.</p>

<p>Noobs to crab eating should do a little research into how to break those suckers down because trust us: you don&apos;t want to eat the devil&apos;s fingers by accident.</p>
