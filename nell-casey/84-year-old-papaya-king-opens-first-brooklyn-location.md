<p>While Gray&apos;s Papaya has been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170501200747/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/08/theres_only_one_grays_papaya_left_i.php">slowly disappearing</a> from city corners, rival grilled hot dog mainstay Papaya King has been steadily increasing its presence in NYC. The 84-year-old hot dog operation will open an outpost in Downtown Brooklyn this Friday, its first outside Manhattan after closing a Long Island branch a decade ago. </p>

<p>The new shop at 6 Flatbush Avenue will occupy a prime corner space at a busy intersection down the street from Junior&apos;s in the construction-torn neighborhood. Like the 86th Street original, this&apos;ll be a standing room only operation for a quick meal of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170501200747/http://gothamist.com/2014/07/02/the_10_best_hot_dogs_in_nyc.php">classic frankfurters</a> topped with relish or kraut and a fruity, tropical drink. </p>

<p>In many ways, the chainlet has followed the trend path to keep itself relevant. Two years ago, they <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170501200747/http://gothamist.com/2014/06/18/papaya_king_food_truck.php">launched a food truck</a> to hawk their all-beef dogs, and now, they&apos;re stepping into an up-and-coming Brooklyn market. They&apos;ve already <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170501200747/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/10/how_to_power_bowl_in_nyc.php">embraced the power bowl trend</a>; could a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170501200747/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/09/rainbow_bagels_williamsburg.php">rainbow hot dog</a> be far behind?</p>
