<p>Tis the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161221201703/http://gothamist.com/2016/12/05/latkes_nyc_2016.php">season of latkes</a>, and since America 2016 means forcing unlikely food partnerships, you can eat a latke on a burger beginning today. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161221201703/http://www.schnippers.com/">Schnippers</a>, the burgers-and-dogs chainlet in Manhattan, debuts their Latke Burger ($8.99) in recognition of Hanukkah, which begins Saturday December 24th. The latke&apos;s a topping for the restaurant&apos;s beef burger and comes with caramelized onions and horseradish sour cream on an onion-studded roll from Orwasher&apos;s. With the potato already on the bun, there&apos;s no need for fries (said no one ever). </p>

<p>Four of the restaurant&apos;s five locations (excluding the One NY Plaza outpost in the Financial District) will be serving the burger through the rest of the month. If you want the burger after that, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161221201703/http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/eats/latke-fun-enjoy-holidays-latke-burger-recipe-article-1.2913216">Daily News scored the recipe</a>, which was created by Schnipper&apos;s co-founder Jonathan Schnipper. </p>
