<p>Down for some Nacho Cheesier Pizza Hut or Cooler Ranch KFC? If the evil geniuses who brought us <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507233817/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/06/taste_test_taco_bell_cool_ranch_dor.php">Doritos Tacos Locos</a> have their way, we&apos;ll be seeing a lot more chip-and-chain combos in our future. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507233817/http://www.pepsico.com/">PepsiCo</a>, parent company of all your favorite stoner foods from Cheetos to Fritos, announced plans yesterday to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507233817/http://bigstory.ap.org/article/are-more-doritos-flavored-foods-way">use their products</a> at chains like Pizza Hut and Buffalo Wild Wings as they did with Taco Bell.

Naturally, New York was ahead of the curve on the Doritofication of our meals: we see your chicken wings and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507233817/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/13/kimchee_carbonara_with_doritos_at_b.php#photo-1">raise you carbonara</a>.</p>
