<p>As a person with ovaries who&apos;s been not only a lifelong sports player but also an avid watcher of professional sports, I&apos;ve been to my fair share of sports bars. You&apos;ve got your divey variety with the peanut shell on the floor and a cruddy old flatscreen in the corner; the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151025195147/http://gothamist.com/2013/12/09/bottomzup.php#photo-1">sleek contemporary interpretation</a> where not a single inch of wall space doesn&apos;t have an LCD; and all the neighborhood joints in between where one stops by for a pint to catch the end of the Yankees game. All of these places are bars, all of these places show sports and I&apos;ve never felt unwelcome or uncomfortable while I&apos;m there; douchey assholes not withstanding. </p>

<p>And yet, there&apos;s  this <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151025195147/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20140213/union-square/not-hooters-style-sports-bar-hopes-pink-walls-will-draw-female-patrons">new Union Square Mexican sports bar</a> that designed its pink-accented decor to attract similarly ovary-bearing human beings whose delicate sensibilities might be otherwise turned off by &quot;manly&quot; attributes like beer and dark colors and raucousness. In short, everything I like about sports bars. Meet <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151025195147/http://www.campeonnyc.com/">Campeon</a>.</p>

<p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s highly stylized and geared towards women in that it&#x2019;s not a typical Hooters-style bar that [is] overly masculine with the Guinness mirrors,&#x201D; owner and penis-haver Ken Sturm explains to DNAinfo. True, Ken, I also find those Guinness mirrors frustrating because that big decal makes it <em>so hard</em> to adjust my lipstick! &#x201C;We did a softer design.&quot; Soft like my luscious locks courtesy of Pantene Pro V? Go on. &quot;We wanted to make it very inviting for women so that they don&#x2019;t feel like they&#x2019;re sitting in a men&#x2019;s kind of club.&#x201D; Oh Ken, silly goose, women are used to being in the men&apos;s club, it&apos;s called <em>living on this planet</em>. But thanks all the same, I <em>do</em> feel right at home surrounded by a cliched aesthetic ascribed to my gender by the patriarchy. </p>

<p>Look I get it. There&apos;s a rumor out there that women don&apos;t like sports and just <em>can&apos;t be bothered</em> to understand the minutia of football when there are sample sales and reruns of <em>The Real Housewives Of Go Fuck Yourself</em> to catch up on. But take it from somebody who worked at one of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151025195147/http://www.brotherjimmys.com/">biggest sports bar chains in the city</a> and also happens to be proficient at differentiating between an offsides and a false start: women need pink walls to feel comfortable about as much as they need a man&apos;s permission to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151025195147/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/22/hillary_clinton_running_for_preside.php">run for president</a>.</p>

<p>So take your fuchsia color palate and your patronizing ideas about how to make women &quot;comfortable&quot; and take them back to whatever well-meaning pile of crap they came from because I&apos;m trying to watch the game, goddamnit. </p>

<p>But leave the guacamole. Bitches <em>bleed </em>guacamole. </p>
