<p>Mill Basin-born <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160917183405/http://www.hardtimessundaes.com/">Hard Times Sundaes</a> was one of NYC&apos;s most elusive burgers depending on your zip code and willingness to hop aboard multiple forms of transportation. The destination burger is now, however, the newest tenant at Urbanspace Vanderbilt, the food hall just outside of Grand Central Terminal. Lucky you, Midtown dwellers.</p>

<p>The news, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160917183405/http://www.grubstreet.com/2016/03/hard-times-sundaes-urbanspace-vanderbilt.html">reported by GrubStreet</a>, follows truck operator Andrew Zurica&apos;s recent move to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160917183405/http://gothamist.com/2015/11/19/hard_times_sundaes_burgers.php">Pfizer Building on Flushing Avenue in Williamsburg</a>.

<p>The Hard Times Sundaes stall will be taking over the Hong Kong Street Cart space (next to Delaney Chicken) after the noodle hawker finishes up its run this week. The burgers should debut at some point next week, joining three other newish stands including an Ippudo noodle concept, a juice bar and another place for sushi burritos. Looks like it&apos;s already time to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160917183405/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/28/urbanspace_vanderbilt_eats.php">update our guide</a>. </p>
