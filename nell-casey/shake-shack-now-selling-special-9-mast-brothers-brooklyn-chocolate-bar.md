</div></div>					<p>Not content to rest on the laurels of complete hamburger domination, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428181640/http://gothamist.com/tags/shakeshack">Shake Shack</a> is entering the twee sweets business. The Union Square Hospitality burger empire <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428181640/http://www.shakeshack.com/2012/12/14/shake-shack-dark-chocolate-bar-by-mast-brothers/">announced today</a> that it has partnered with &#xFC;ber New Brooklyn artisanal confectioners <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428181640/http://mastbrothers.com/">Mast Brothers Chocolate</a> to create a &quot;Shake Shack Dark Chocolate&quot; bar. </p>

<p>The chocolate bar is created under the Mast Brothers&apos; fastidiously over-the-top cacao bean sourcing process, with lots of attention to the quality and purity of ingredients. Their cacao beans are sourced from small, family-run farms in Peru, Madagascar and the Dominican Republic and are &quot;roasted, winnowed, stone ground, aged, and flawlessly tempered&quot; in the Brothers&apos; Williamsburg factory. The Shake Shake special blend is a pure cacao and cane sugar creation that has &quot;complex, earthy notes of cranberry and cinnamon,&quot; as befitting the season. Each bar is encased in gold foil and then wrapped in custom-designed paper that depicts the flagship Shake Shack in Madison Square Park.</p>

<p>The chocolate will undoubtedly be mixed into the Shack&apos;s concretes&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428181640/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/20/brooklyn_shake_shack_now_open_with.php#photo-1">as they&apos;ve done before</a> with other Mast Bros chocolate bars&#x2014;but if you&apos;d prefer to eat it you can snag the $9 bar at Shake Shake locations throughout the U.S. And who knows, a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428181640/http://gothamist.com/2012/09/01/oh_canada_hot_dog_served_in_chocola.php">chocolate-covered burger</a> might not be too far in out in the future.</p>
