<p>The first of the <strong>Summer Fridays at Union Square Greenmarket</strong> will be tonight&apos;s <strong>Seafood Fest</strong> at the north end of the Square. From 4 p.m. to 9 p.m., surrounding restaurants like Blue Water Grill, Luke&apos;s Lobster and Barbounia will be vending dishes focused on sustainably-caught seafood from the waters of the northeast seaboard. Also at the market, a beer garden selling brews from five breweries, two cideries and one winery. Live music will be provided by the Jazz Foundation of America.</p>
