<p>The pizzeria known for topping their pies with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161017162457/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/13/hot_dogs_and_french_fries_top_new_p.php">hot dogs and french fries</a> is taking a more upscale approach this Friday with a one-day-only <strong>pizza topped with caviar</strong>. Executive Chef and Pizzaioli Pasquale Cozzolino at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161017162457/http://www.ribaltapizzarestaurant.com/">Ribalta</a> is topping a Neapolitan pie with fresh tuna, baked shallot and imported Italian Calvisius caviar for $23. If you&apos;re feeling particularly deep of pocket, you can spend $30 and get the pizza plus a two beer pairing on the side. </p>

<p>The humble dumpling takes many forms, but none so popular as xiao long bao, tender purses stuffed with meat and a savory soup. On Saturday, Irene Yoo of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161017162457/http://www.yooeating.com/">Yooeating?!</a> puts her <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161017162457/http://gothamist.com/2015/02/23/korean_fusion_pop_up_yooeating.php">creative Korean bent</a> on the <strong>soup dumpling with two different fusion versions employing jjigae, Korean stew</strong>. At the pop-up at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161017162457/http://www.reclamationbarbrooklyn.com/">Reclamation Bar</a> in Williamsburg beginning at 6 p.m., Yoo will offer Kimchi Jjigae Soup Dumplings made with spicy pork and Dwenjang Jjigae Soup Dumplings, a soybean-based version made with anchovy broth. Both dumpling options run three for $6 with rice and banchan (kimchi, sesame spinach and chive and vegetable pancakes) for $4. <em>Cash only.</em></p>
