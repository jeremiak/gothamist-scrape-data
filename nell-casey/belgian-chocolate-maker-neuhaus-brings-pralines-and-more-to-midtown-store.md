</div></div><p>Madison Avenue just got a fat sweet treat from Belgium with the arrival of <a href="www.neuhaus.be">Neuhaus chocolate&apos;s</a> third New York City location, which opened its doors a few weeks ago just three blocks from its Lexington Avenue location. The 1,500 square foot flagship store dwarfs its two brothers in size and amenities, like the on-site &quot;museum&quot; chronicling the history of the company alongside video of master chocolatiers at work crafting the sweets. And for those who desire a more hands-on approach to chocolate making, a master chocolatier will be <em>on-call</em>&#x2014;presumably with a signature <strike>bubblegum</strike> chocolate pager&#x2014;to conduct chocolate making workshops, parties and after hours tastings. </p>

<p>Of course, a chocolate shop must sell chocolate. On hand are the confectionery&apos;s signature pralines&#x2014;which were first invented by Jean Neuhaus Jr. in 1912&#x2014;filled with a wide assortment of ganaches and creams. (Disclosure: They sent a small box to Gothamist HQ last month and they were inhaled in short order. Excellent chocolate.) Chocolate bars and tablets of all sizes are for sale alongside carr&#xE9;s, themed chocolates and gift boxes. These chocolates don&apos;t come cheap, however, with a boxed selection of 20 pralines ringing up to a hefty $45, but that tax refund check isn&apos;t gonna cash itself! It&apos;s either that or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120529104341/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/23/as_seen_on_last_nights_girls_whats.php">opium pods!</a></p>
