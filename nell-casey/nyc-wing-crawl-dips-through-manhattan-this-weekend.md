<p>On Saturday, the <strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170213072821/https://www.facebook.com/events/1267361996686939/">NYC Wing Crawl</a></strong> saunters through five Manhattan barstaurants with a goal of consuming vast quantities of cluckers and raising money for two institutions threatened by Trump&apos;s America. The crawl kicks off at wing institution Blondie&apos;s on the Upper West Side at noon, then <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170213072821/https://www.facebook.com/events/1267361996686939/">follows a casual path</a> down to Hill Country on West 26th Street. For every 10 wings sold at each stop (mention &quot;Wing Crawl&quot; when ordering), the restaurants will donate $1, with proceeds benefiting Planned Parenthood of New York City and NRDC (Natural Resources Defense Council). Sales of branded wet naps ($.75) will also be split between the two organizations. </p>
