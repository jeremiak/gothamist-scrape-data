<p>The Mast Brothers&apos; bearded cocoon of craft chocolate appears to be melting in the face of intense criticism, most recently as the target of a damning four part series that purports to lift the curtain behind one of Williamsburg OG &quot;artisanal&quot; food makers. In Mast Brothers: What Lies Beneath the Beards, the expos&#xE9; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160803065443/http://dallasfood.org/">published on Dallasfood.org</a>, the blogger &quot;Scott&quot;&#x2014;who doesn&apos;t reveal his last name to protect his day job&#x2014;painstakingly debunks and refutes years of claims by the hirsute brothers Michael and Rick Mast, most notably their claims of employing a &#x201C;bean to bar&quot; method since first selling their chocolate in 2007. According to Scott, it&apos;s all a crock of crummy cacao. </p>

<p>According to multiple on-the-record sources, the duo admit to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160803065443/http://dallasfood.org/2015/12/mast-brothers-what-lies-behind-the-beards-part-1-tastetexture/">using remelted chocolate from Valrhona</a>, a no-no to craft purveyors who purport to using the bean to bar process. Phone calls, emails and in person conversations show the brothers admitting to their Valrhona use not only to &quot;experiment with new recipes,&quot; but also in products sold to the public. </p>

<p>&quot;This has been an open secret in the chocolate industry,&quot; chocolate exprt Clay Gordon <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160803065443/http://qz.com/571151/the-mast-brothers-fooled-the-world-into-buying-crappy-hipster-chocolate-for-10-a-bar/?utm_source=atlfb">divulged to Quartz</a>. Chocolate professionals point to early bars as &quot;overly refined,&quot; a &quot;trademark of industrial chocolate&quot; and note that, as the brothers presumably began truly making bean-to-bar chocolate, there was a noticeable dip in quality. &quot;The change was remarkable and obvious,&quot; a Portland Cacao shop owner remembered of product tasted in 2010. &quot;Most of the chocolate was simply inedible, by my standards.&quot;</p>

<p>Scott&apos;s takedown also calls out the brothers&apos; claims of ingenuity in the craft chocolate industry, refuting their self-proclaimed titles as the &#x201C;Leaders of the Chocolate Revolution&quot; by showing they employed chocolate-making techniques and machinery that was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160803065443/http://dallasfood.org/2015/12/mast-brothers-what-lies-behind-the-beards-part-2-equipment/">already developed for and in use by</a> other craft chocolate companies. &#x201C;We&#x2019;ve had to come up with how everything is done every step of the way because there was no such thing as small-batch chocolate makers,&#x201D; the duo <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160803065443/https://theweekendedition.com.au/mapmagazine/the-mast-brothers/">claimed in interviews</a>, conveniently omitting that they purchased equipment on a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160803065443/http://www.chocolatealchemy.com/">popular industry website</a> and that other craft purveyors were already employing similar methods when Mast Brothers debuted.</p>

<p>This is the second time this year the Brothers Mast have been subjected to public scrutiny&#x2014;and not just their shady assertions but also the quality of their product. Earlier this spring, chocolate writer Megan Giller <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160803065443/http://gothamist.com/2015/03/16/mast_brothers_hipster_backlash.php">ran a story</a> revealing the brothers&apos; relationship with the greater craft chocolate community, who essentially dismissed their product from the early days. According to Scott, the experts in the industry and Giller&apos;s assessments, the brothers&apos; contribution to the chocolate scene can be summed up as purely aesthetic. &quot;With their attractive packaging; youthful, hip fashion; and marketing genius, they are the face of the movement, educating the public about craft chocolate and bringing a higher-end product to specialty and grocery stores alike,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160803065443/http://www.slate.com/articles/life/food/2015/12/why_chocolate_experts_think_the_mast_brothers_are_frauds.1.html">Giller notes on Slate</a>. </p>

<p>The brothers have continued their practice of doubling down when confronted with these accusations. &quot;We are a dangerous company because we are outsiders to the chocolate industry, never leaning on industry norms,&quot; Rick Mast mused in March. &quot;Sorry that you liked our chocolate more in 2007 than in later years,&quot; they <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160803065443/http://www.grubstreet.com/2015/12/mast-brothers-chocolate-attacks.html">condescended to GrubStreet</a>. Finally, in an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160803065443/http://mastbrothers.com/pages/press">open letter on their website</a>, the brothers refute all claims made by Scott&apos;s analysis. &quot;Any insinuation that Mast Brothers was not, is not or will not be a bean to bar chocolate maker is incorrect and misinformed. We have been making chocolate from bean to bar since the beginning and will continue to do so.&quot;</p>
