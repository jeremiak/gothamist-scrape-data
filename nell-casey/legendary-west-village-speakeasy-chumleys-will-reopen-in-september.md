</a><p><a>Long-dormant Chumley&apos;s, the legendary West Village speakeasy and </a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161017161416/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/23/chumleys_village_fight.php">NIMBY magnet</a>, has finally been given the date of its resurrection: September 6th. Nine long years after a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161017161416/http://gothamist.com/2007/04/06/chumleys_buildi.php">chimney and wall collapse</a> forced the bar to shutter, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161017161416/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/08/nyregion/chumleys-is-set-to-come-back-and-it-still-wont-be-easy-to-find.html?referer=https:/www.google.com&amp;_r=1">the Times reports that</a> it&apos;ll finally reopen at its Bedford Street home, with a shiny new decor and fancy menu to usher in its new era. Up in heaven, Jack Kerouac is rolling his eyes.</p>

<p>As was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161017161416/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/05/chumleys_comeback_story.php">previously reported</a>, there&apos;s a new captain at the helm at Chumley&apos;s. Alessandro Borgognone, operator of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161017161416/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/15/sushi_nakazawa.php#photo-1">lauded Sushi Nakazawa</a> just a block away, signed on with two business partners to spruce up Chumley&apos;s to appeal to the neighborhood. The partners have upgraded the bar&apos;s decor to include &quot;patterned wallpaper, leather banquettes, French-oak tables...[and a] long, dark bar.&quot; At least the book jackets&#x2014;celebrating the bar&apos;s literary history&#x2014;have been brought back, though some are reproductions. </p>

<p>The new &quot;Chumley&#x2019;s on steroids,&quot; as Borgognone describes it, puts a big focus on the dining side of the bar/restaurant. Victoria Blamey, a former chef de cuisine at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161017161416/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/18/dining/reviews/atera-in-tribeca.html">notable tasting menu restaurant</a> Atera in Tribeca, will be leading the kitchen; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161017161416/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/05/chumleys_comeback_story.php">previously</a>, that meant classics like burgers and steak frites &quot;in the $10 to $25 range.&quot; Borgognone now says diners should expect to pay $50 per person&#x2014;before drinks. &quot;We don&#x2019;t do bars where people are drinking in and flopping all over the floor&#x2014;that&#x2019;s not our kind of business,&quot; Borgognone explained. </p>

<p>If these measures still can&apos;t <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161017161416/http://gothamist.com/2014/08/23/west_village_bar_chumleys_spared_by.php">appease neighbors</a>, at least would-be drunken hooligans will probably just walk on past Chumley&apos;s without even knowing it&apos;s there. As part of the Greenwich Village Historic District, signs aren&apos;t permitted on the building. </p>
