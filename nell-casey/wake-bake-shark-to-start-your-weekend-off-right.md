<p>Williamsburg&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160813160757/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/16/pearls_caribbean_williamsburg.php#photo-1">newish Trinidadian and Caribbean restaurant</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160813160757/http://pearlsbakeandshark.com/">Pearl&apos;s</a> has <strong>begun a banging brunch</strong> program that&apos;s not afraid to throw fish in your face first thing in the morning. Their version of Eggs Benedict ($15) employs sea urchin in its hollandaise, which owner Fallon Seymour says is a special occasion appearance in her native Trinidad and Tobago. Alongside, a crustacean-heavy seared crab cake and Caribbean hash, which also serves as a base for the Geera Pork Hash, topped with a fried egg. The restaurant also serves their signature sandwiches at brunch, offering an opportunity to wake &amp; Bake &amp; Shark without the lingering side effects.</p>

<p>Also in the Caribbean vein, <strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160813160757/https://www.facebook.com/RespectTheBrunch">Respect The Brunch</a></strong>, an LGBTQ allies organization, are hosting their first NYC benefit brunch at Williamsburg&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160813160757/http://www.batteryharris.com/">Battery Harris</a> on Saturday. From noon to 4 p.m., 20% of every check at the restaurant will be donated to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160813160757/http://www.aliforneycenter.org/">Ali Forney Center</a>, an organization that protects LGBTQ youths from homelessness and offers them the tools and support to live independently. That&apos;s a pretty damn good reason to eat some Caribbean Biscuits &amp; Gravy.</p>

<p>Stately Broome Street eatery <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160813160757/http://www.louieandchan.com/">Louie &amp; Chan</a> knows the value of the dollar, specifically how to redeem the face of our 16th president for some tasty Italian food and wine. Monday through Sunday, the restaurant&apos;s offering $5 plates of pasta and pizza, plus beer and wine from 5 p.m. until 8 p.m. Redeem Mr. Lincoln for a bowl of Fusilli alla caprese topped with mozzarella or the Bacio del Diavolo pizza with Calabrian chilies, &apos;nduja sausage, mozzarella and ricotta cheese and a honey drizzle. Italian wines, including a sparkling option, plus Peroni or Brooklyn Lager, are also just five bucks during the deal. </p>

<p>And finally, beginning this weekend you can take your own personal cocktail tour celebrating the spirit world&apos;s most badass female bartenders, mixologists and producers with <strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160813160757/http://goodpassports.com/cocktails/the-loaded-cocktail-passport-2016-37-cocktails-from-37-bars-for-37/">The NYC LOADed Cocktail Passport</a></strong>, which kicks off this Sunday.
