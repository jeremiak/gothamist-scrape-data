<p>Thomas Keller&apos;s Per Se has enjoyed a good ride as one of NYC&apos;s most venerable <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170624052130/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/01/2016_michelin_winners.php">Michelin starred</a> restaurants, but the caviar veneer has come crashing down in an entertaining takedown <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170624052130/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/13/dining/pete-wells-per-se-review.html?smid=tw-nytfood&amp;smtyp=cur&amp;_r=0">by NY Times restaurant critic Pete Wells</a>, who compares one of the dishes to bong water. In a single paragraph alone, the critic employs the words &quot;dismal green pulp,&quot; mushy,&quot; gluey, oily liquid,&quot; &quot;swampy mess,&quot; &quot;limp, dispiriting,&quot; &quot;lukewarm&quot; and &quot;murky.&quot; Don&apos;t hold back, Pete!</p>

<p>Back in 2011, then-Times critic Sam Sifton wrote a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170624052130/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/12/dining/reviews/per-se-nyc-restaurant-review.html?ref=dining">glowing four star review</a>, which Wells rectifies with a merciless hatchet job on restaurant&apos;s &quot;mangled&quot; food and &quot;sleepwalking&quot; service, ultimately calling the restaurant &quot;among the worst food deals in New York.&quot; Other lowlights:</p>

<ul>
<li>&quot;rubbery and flavorless&quot; cheese inside a crepe of pickled carrots, peanuts and a date</li>
<li>the sabayon in the restaurant&apos;s iconic &quot;oysters and pearls&quot; dish that had &quot;broken and separated, so fat pooled above the tapioca&quot;</li>
<li>butter-poached lobster &quot;intransigently chewy: gristle of the sea&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;...like peanut butter to which something terrible had been done&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;a slick of cold oatmeal&quot;</li>
</ul>

<p>Service misfires during Wells&apos;s visits included an argumentative sommelier, haphazard place settings and servers that &quot;give you the feeling that you work for them, and your job is to feel lucky to receive whatever you get.&quot; </p>

<p>Still, after all of this, the critic demotes the restaurant only down to two stars, a courtesy rating if ever there was one. He may not have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170624052130/http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/30/dining/senor-frogs-review.html">awarded Senor Frogs any stars</a>, but at least Wells didn&apos;t label it a &quot;no-fun house.&quot; </p>

<p>Even when Per Se was firing on all cylinders, there was cause to question the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170624052130/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/11/sifton_visits_per_se_for_final_revi.php">insane price tag</a>, which has only gone up in recent years. The new model&#x2014;which adheres to the new service included trend&#x2014;had a meal for four people ringing up near the $3,000 mark, a figure apparently forked over at least once (if not three times) during the critic&apos;s visits. That&apos;s a princely sum to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170624052130/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/09/per_se_diners_throw_up_their_expens.php">flush down the toilet</a>. </p>
