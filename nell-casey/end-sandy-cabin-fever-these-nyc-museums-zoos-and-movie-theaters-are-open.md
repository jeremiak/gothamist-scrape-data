<p>Whether you&apos;ve been stuck in an apartment with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502144130/http://gothamist.com/tags/coned">no power and water</a> or you&apos;ve been forced to work from home for days because of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502144130/http://gothamist.com/tags/mta">transit disaster</a>, chances are you&apos;re probably experiencing a serious case of cabin fever. Many of NYC&apos;s incredible museums, gardens and movie houses have made a point of opening today, to help relieve some of tension from being cooped up for almost a week. Here&apos;s a list of the some places to enjoy, even if just for a few hours.</p>
