<p>John Carpenter&apos;s &quot;action adventure comedy kung fu ghost story monster movie&quot; (in his words) <em>Big Trouble In Little China</em> gets the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171015135937/http://www.nitehawkcinema.com/series/film-feasts/">Film Feasts</a> treatment at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171015135937/http://www.nitehawkcinema.com/">Nitehawk Cinema</a> in April, including a collaboration with legendary dim sum house <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171015135937/http://nomwah.com/">Nom Wah Tea Parlor</a>. The 1986 Kurt Russell/Dennis Dun flop gets another chance at theatrical success on April 18th, with a paired dinner and drinks experience at the dine-in cinema.</p>

<p>Nom Wah owner/chef Wilson Tang and Nitehawk&apos;s executive chef Kurt Applegate created a Chinatown-themed menu in recognition of the film&apos;s setting, including chicken and shrimp dumplings, lo mein and sesame balls that goes down as smoothly as a knife to the forehead. It&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171015135937/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A65Jq6NKdeI">all in the reflexes</a>.</p>

<p>There&apos;s always an alcohol component to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171015135937/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/29/french_connection_nitehawk_film_fea.php">these feasting experiences</a> and this time it&apos;s Lagunitas supplying the brews for each course. Both dishes and beers arrive timed to specific sections of the film from which their names were inspired. Hopefully most of the eating&apos;s completed by the time Thunder&apos;s body explodes.</p>

<p>Now&apos;s the time to experience this cult classic on the (relatively) big screen before The Rock swoops in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171015135937/http://www.thewrap.com/dwayne-the-rock-johnson-to-star-in-big-trouble-in-little-china-remake-exclusive/">to film a remake</a>.</p>
