<p>If you&apos;re a fan of the offbeat culinary scene in Brooklyn, you&apos;ve no doubt heard of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508122918/http://www.facebook.com/DOorDINE">Do Or Dine</a>, the Bed-Stuy eatery known for its <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508122918/http://gothamist.com/tags/doordine">eccentric culinary antics</a>. What you might <em>not</em> know, however, is that owner and chef <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508122918/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gs1HsooNOkA">Justin Warner</a> has been competing on a reality cooking show and he&apos;s <em>thisclose</em> to winning! Warner has been wowing judges of <em>The Next Food Network Star</em>&#x2014;the show that bestowed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508122918/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/16/guy_fieri_is_bringing_his_bleach_to.php">Guy Fieri</a> upon us&#x2014;with his off-beat creations and now he&apos;s secured a spot in the Final Four. Whoever wins this week will get their very own FN cooking show, and that winner will be decided by a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508122918/http://star.foodnetwork.com/">fan vote on the show&apos;s website</a>.</p>

<p>While Warner has our vote (just feast your eyes on his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508122918/http://gothamist.com/2011/07/10/do_or_dine_does_their_doughnuts_wit.php">infamous foie gras doughnut</a> or the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508122918/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/28/pickleback.php">calcium lactate pickleback shot</a>), there <em>are</em> three other finalists well worth mentioning: Martie Duncan (Alabama), Michele Ragussis (also of Brooklyn) and Yvan Lemoine (New York by way of Venezuela). You have until Tuesday night at 5 p.m. to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508122918/http://star.foodnetwork.com/">log your vote</a> for any one of them (up to 10 times a day!)... but <em>only</em> one of them can spit mad raps about Ros&#xE9;:</p>
