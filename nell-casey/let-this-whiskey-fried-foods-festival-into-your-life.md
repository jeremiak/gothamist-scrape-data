<p>As if Bedford Avenue weren&apos;t already crowded enough on the weekends, a <strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170309013348/http://shop-bulletin.com/bulletin-market-williamsburg-rsvp">new outdoor market</a></strong> will be popping up on the lot at North 8th Street and Driggs on Saturdays and Sundays through September, bringing food, booze and designer goods in addition to more crowds. Put on by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170309013348/http://shop-bulletin.com/">Bulletin</a>, which works with indie designers, the market&apos;ll sell non-edible things like ceramics and jewelry, but organizers says they&apos;re aiming for a &quot;relaxed, block party vibe,&quot; ushered in by a full bar, games and a DJ. Luke&apos;s Lobster, Gorilla Cheese Truck, Taim, Melt Bakery and other mobile food vendors will be on-site selling edibles to keep the day going.</p>

<p>Elsewhere in market news, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170309013348/http://licflea.com/">LIC Flea &amp; Food</a> is putting on their own version of a <strong>night market</strong> in the month of July at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170309013348/http://www.kaufmanastoria.com/">Kaufman Astoria Studios</a>. From 7 p.m. to midnight on July 16, 23, and 30 the lot will fill with flea market-type vendors selling antiques and vintage clothing, crafts and the like. A few of the food vendors will be there too, including <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170309013348/http://jessyspastries.com/">Jessy&apos;s Pastries</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170309013348/https://www.facebook.com/JaeNYCEats/">Jae NYC Eats</a>. <strong>Update:</strong>There&apos;s no night market for July 9th. </p>
