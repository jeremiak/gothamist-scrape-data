<p>Governor Cuomo has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021112840/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/14/sunday_boozing_nyc.php">listened to the advice</a> of his specially-appointed panel regarding archaic blue laws that prohibit alcohol sales on Sunday mornings. Speaking <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021112840/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/NY-Cuomo-Allow-Liquor-Sales-in-State-Before-Noon-Sunday-Brunch-380081261.html">from a brewery in Rochester</a> yesterday, the Governor announced a proposed set of bills that would allow restaurants and bars to sell alcohol before noon on Sundays. If passed by the legislation, New York could start getting tipsy with their morning bagel, as early as 8 a.m.</p>

<p>&quot;The law was created 80 years ago right after prohibition,&quot; Cuomo said <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021112840/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/cuomo-proposal-bars-sell-booze-sunday-mornings-article-1.2641820">from the brewery</a>. &quot;It is the most bizarre, arcane, frustrating, maddening law that you could imagine.&quot; Similar <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021112840/http://gothamist.com/2004/02/25/saturday_night_drinks_sunday_morning_beer.php">religiously-based blue laws</a>, such as allowing liquor stores to operate on Sundays, have been repealed in the state in the past decades.</p>

<p>While erasing an archaic law from the books seems like an easy way to score points with the public, the motivation behind the move has a narrower focus. The panel&apos;s main argument for increased alcohol flow centered on sporting events, specifically special American football games played abroad (and broadcast on Sunday mornings in the States) and European soccer games being broadcast live from their respective countries. </p>

<p>The legislation concludes its annual session next month, where it&apos;ll vote on whether or not we can all be trusted to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021112840/http://gothamist.com/2014/08/25/video_supercut_of_belligerent_brunc.php">booze responsibly in the morning</a>.</p>
