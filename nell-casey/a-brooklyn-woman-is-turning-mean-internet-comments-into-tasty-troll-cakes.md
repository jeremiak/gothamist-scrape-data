<p>Not to toot our own trolls, but Gothamist&apos;s comment section is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170429014531/http://animalnewyork.com/2015/ranking-new-york-medias-commenters-worst-best/">the stuff of legend</a> (shout out to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170429014531/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/02/cnn_salutes_gothamist_commenters.php">endurance of Rocknrope</a>, among others...let&apos;s try to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170429014531/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/22/gothamist_commenter_arrested_for_th.php">forget that other incident</a>). Though it&apos;s advisable in all situations to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170429014531/https://twitter.com/avoidcomments?lang=en">never read the comments</a>, that&apos;s like asking someone to look away from a car wreck or resist a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170429014531/http://gothamist.com/tags/brunchhatereads">New York Times Brunch Hate Read</a>. Sometimes, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170429014531/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/22/comments_cherished.php">you just can&apos;t avoid them</a>.</p>

<p>Now recipients of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170429014531/http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=concern%20troll">concern trolling</a> and sponsored content accusations have an avenue for reprisal in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170429014531/http://www.trollcakes.com/">Troll Cakes</a>, a revenge-based confectionary service that promises to send your trolls a little something to show you <strike>care</strike> think they&apos;re a real jerk store. Send Troll Cakes the meanest internet comment and they promise to ship a custom cake bearing said message to the commenter who made it.</p>

<p>Is this for real? Yes (we&apos;ve seen proof of at least one order), but it&apos;s fledgling. Owner Kat Thek began the business just two weeks ago with no formal training in pastry but armed with &quot;a love of cakes, catty comments, and being nosy.&quot; Each &quot;cake&quot; is actually a  chocolate chip brownie, which Thek decorates with icing and jaunty sprinkles and toppings that make the cake&apos;s text even more jarring. She says her team have only sent a handful of cakes so far, but insists they have a lot of baking to do this weekend. </p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="042817trollcake2.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170429014531im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_nellcasey/042817trollcake2.jpg" width="640" height="480"> <br> <i> (Troll Cakes)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>So far it seems more conceptual art than lucrative business, but it could be Thek has discovered an untapped market&#x2014;there are certainly no shortage of mean Internet comments to work with. Thek has adorned cakes with choice phrases such as &quot;sloppy butt,&quot; &quot;ur mom is obese&quot; and &quot;wouldn&apos;t smash,&quot; but says the meanest thing she&apos;s ever put on a cake was &quot;I wish you got aborted.&quot; </p>

<p>In addition to making the cakes&#x2014;and the box festooned with a printout of the comment itself&#x2014;Thek also touts herself as an amateur sleuth, and for an extra fee says she will track down the troll&apos;s home or work address and mail the cake straight to their door. Thek declined to say <em>how</em> she tracks down the trolls (&quot;that&apos;s a Troll Cakes trade secret&quot;) but with the volume of personal information people recklessly throw out on social media it sounds reasonably plausible. </p>

<p>Troll Cakes HQ is located in Brooklyn so any vengeful commenter targets have the option for next-day, in-person delivery of their cake, but they&apos;ll ship anywhere in the USA&#x2014;including 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. Opt for the &quot;Tiny Hands Special&quot; and for just $30 American dollars they&apos;ll send &quot;your preferred Trump tweet&quot; to the White House. (Thek says the &quot;scariest&quot; cake she ever made &quot;goes to Trump&apos;s recent boasting about pulling the highest TV ratings since 9/11.&quot;)</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="042817trollcakes3.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170429014531im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_nellcasey/042817trollcakes3.jpg" width="640" height="530"> <br> <i> (Troll Cakes)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>Some of the cakes so far have been sent between friends as a joke. &quot;Troll Cakes work both ways&#x2014;you can send a cake to a troll or you can troll your friends with a cake,&quot; Thek <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170429014531/http://www.cosmopolitan.com/sex-love/a9536134/troll-cakes-detective-agency/">told Cosmopolitan</a>. So far, none of the trolls themselves have offered Thek any feedback, IRL or on the internet. &quot;Maybe they&apos;re busy baking retort cakes.&quot;</p>
