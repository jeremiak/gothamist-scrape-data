<p>Over at vegan utopia <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170326163252/http://www.modernlovebrooklyn.com/">Modern Love</a> in Williamsburg, it&apos;s a version of &quot;meat&quot; and waffles made with wheat gluten instead. Seitan &amp; Waffles ($16) is one of the dishes on the restaurant&apos;s newish brunch menu, made with rosemary-breaded seitan, malted waffles, fresh berries, raspberry butter and maple syrup. You can&apos;t grab it on the waffle holiday this weekend (brunch is Sundays only), but if you indulged in waffles on Saturday, consider <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170326163252/http://www.modernlovebrooklyn.com/menu">other dishes</a> like a Chilaquiles Breakfast Bowl ($18, also gluten-free) with scrambled tofu with all the fixins&apos; or a Full English Breakfast ($18) with scrambled tofu, homefries, challah toast with baked beans, housemade maple sausage, arugula salad, and smoked tomato.</p>

<p>And what goes well with waffles? Maple syrup!

Wells Steakhouse</a>. The Canadian chef leads a three hour class on making dishes like baked beans, crepes, pork rinds and taffy with maple syrup, with a big meal, wine and beverages, and a recipe book also included in the package. The class runs from 3 p.m. to 6 p.m. at the Long Island City Steakhouse; $150 for a spot, with reservations available at 718-786-9060 or by emailing Sarah@MagasinWells.com with your name, number of attendees, and a phone number to reach you by.</p>
