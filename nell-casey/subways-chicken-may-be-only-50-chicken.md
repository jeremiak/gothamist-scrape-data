<p>Subway, the fast food sandwich equivalent of an obvious toupee, is the center of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170628102116/http://gothamist.com/2014/02/06/subway_to_remove_yoga_mat_chemical.php">yet another</a> possible food scandal involving ingredients in its &quot;fresh&quot; sandwiches. A Canadian investigation into fast food chicken claims to have discovered that Subway&apos;s &quot;chicken&quot; offerings were in fact only around 50% chicken&#x2014;and sometimes less. The rest: soy.</p>

<p>Subway...<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170628102116/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/25/subway_sorry_about_the_short_sandwi.php">lied to us</a>? </p>

<p>Trent University&apos;s Wildlife Forensic DNA Laboratory, tapped by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, tested chicken samples from major fast food companies including McDonald&apos;s, Wendy&apos;s and Tim Horton&apos;s, with most <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170628102116/http://pix11.com/2017/02/27/chicken-at-subway-only-contains-about-50-percent-chicken-dna-study-shows/">scoring between 85-90% chicken DNA</a>. Subway&apos;s chicken offerings, however, scored at 53.6% for its oven roasted chicken and a <em>poultry</em> 42.8% for its Sweet Onion Chicken Teriyaki chicken strips. </p>

<p>&quot;Subway&apos;s results were such an outlier that the team decided to test them again, biopsying five new oven roasted chicken pieces, and five new orders of chicken strips,&quot; according to CBC News. </p>

<p>Subway Canada <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170628102116/http://www.cbc.ca/marketplace/blog/company-responses-chicken">released a statement</a> stating that recent tests met with their food quality standards but that they would &quot;look into this again with [their] suppliers&quot; to confirm. If you&apos;re curious about Subway ingredients in general, mosey on over here [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170628102116/https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=2&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjo4ITK0LPSAhWIiFQKHXoZAvkQFggpMAE&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.subway.com%2Fen-us%2FContactUs%2F~%2Fmedia%2FUSA%2FDocuments%2FNutrition%2FusProdIngredients&amp;usg=AFQjCNEhoTtrj4T1fUMKJTPM3rN-Hw6KuQ&amp;sig2=IrdN1EIKg1SYUg3oRDHz3A&amp;bvm=bv.148073327,d.amc">pdf</a>]. </p>

<p>While Subway should be reserved for moments of extreme need, like getting home too late to order Domino&apos;s or nuclear holocaust, one Gothamist staffer remains unperturbed by the findings. Tribeca Moonshine* swears by the cold cut combo, a combination of taupe-colored pork meats that are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170628102116/http://www.subway.com/en-us/menunutrition/menu/product?ProductId=4268&amp;MenuCategoryId=1">actually made from turkey</a>. </p>
