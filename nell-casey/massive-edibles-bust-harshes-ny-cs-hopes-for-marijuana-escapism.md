<p>Personally, I&apos;ve been drowning in the bottle since <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161202111319/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/09/trump_president.php#photo-1">that day</a> we can&apos;t stop talking about. For some, it&apos;s the booze; for others, drifting away in a cloud of Purple Haze. Or eating a fuck ton of pot brownies and momentarily forgetting the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161202111319/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/18/wtf_is_happening_here.php">upside down we&apos;re living in</a>. </p>

<p>Enter the NYPD.</p>

<p>During a routine traffic stop Saturday afternoon, two cops in the Bronx uncovered a baker&apos;s delight of edibles after smelling marijuana in a 2000 Gray Nissan driving on East Gun Hill Road. Officers out of the 49th Precinct found a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161202111319/https://twitter.com/NYPD49Pct/status/803003688457367552">&quot;massive amount&quot;</a> of pot-infused brownies, cookies and Rice Krispy treats, which will now languish in an evidence locker instead of supplying a valuable avenue for escapism. Sweet, delicious escapism.</p>

<p>An NYPD spokesperson said officers arrested the vehicle&apos;s occupants, Luis Sanchez and Gabriel Cruz, on charges of criminal possession of marijuana. In addition, Sanchez faces charges for allegedly driving without a license.   </p>

<p>I don&apos;t fuck with edibles anymore&#x2014;that shit&apos;s intense (hi Mom!)&#x2014;but man, leave it to the NYPD to make an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161202111319/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/27/trump_claims_clinton_popular_vote_l.php">already horrible week</a> even more of a bummer.</p>
