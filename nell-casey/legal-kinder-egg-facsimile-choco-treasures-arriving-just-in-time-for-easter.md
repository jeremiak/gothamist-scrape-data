<p>If you are fortunate enough to have relatives abroad or really cool jet-setting friends, you&apos;ve likely enjoyed a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130605041701/http://www.ferrero.com/products/the-most-famous-products/kinder-surprise/surprise-play-chocolate">Kinder Surprise</a>, or Kinder Egg at some point in your life. If not, imagine a small plastic capsule containing an even smaller, as-yet-assembled toy all wrapped in a larger, delicious chocolate shell. But did you know that your innocent chocolate noshing and toy construction was actually based in an illicit and <em>illegal</em> smuggling operation carried out by (likely unwitting) friends and family? Well:</p>

<p>For reasons that are beyond our comprehension&#x2014;&quot;choking hazard&quot; okay okay&#x2014;Kinder Surprise eggs are banned in the United States. And not just &quot;unavailable&quot; in the United States: as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130605041701/http://consumerist.com/2012/07/19/unwitting-smugglers-had-no-idea-delightful-chocolate-eggs-with-toy-surprises-inside-are-illegal/">two unlucky Americans traveling from Canada discovered</a>, the penalty for bringing a Kinder egg into the USA carries a fine of $2,500. Per egg. Yes, you can buy guns at Wal-Mart, but you can&apos;t bring delicious European toy-stuffed chocolate across the border. </p>

<p>But the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130605041701/http://consumerist.com/2013/03/14/no-more-kinder-surprise-smuggling-chocolate-eggs-with-toys-inside-finally-legal-in-the-u-s/">good news out of Consumerist</a> today tells of a new product available Stateside, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130605041701/http://www.chocotreasure.com/">Choco Treasure</a>, which sounds almost exactly like the Kinder candy: &quot;chocolate eggs with a toy surprise inside.&quot; So what makes this product acceptable in the eyes of Uncle Sam? According to the product&apos;s website, there is a &quot;plastic ridge around the capsule to clearly separate the two halves of chocolate. It&#x2019;s important that so that even a child can easily see there&#x2019;s a capsule in addition to the chocolate.&quot; Because apparently American children can&apos;t tell the difference between chocolate and plastic. Or something. </p>

<p>Anyway, the confections will have toys like Spiderman figures licensed by Marvel plus sports-related toys. If you want some Choco Treasures for your child-safe Easter basket, the eggs will be available at Target soon. </p>
