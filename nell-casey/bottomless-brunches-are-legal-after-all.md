<p>We&apos;ve been through quite a whirlwind this week with news that our <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150521210140/http://gothamist.com/2014/02/20/bottomless_brunch.php">beloved bottomless brunches</a> were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150521210140/http://gothamist.com/2014/02/25/bottomless_brunch_is_illegal.php">on the wrong side of the law</a>. But take heart, fellow binge drinkers, as it seems boozy brunch may live to see many more Sundays. Following the media hubbub, the SLA clarified its position on the matter and revealed it&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150521210140/http://www.businessinsider.com/new-york-bottomless-brunches-are-legal-2014-2">perfectly legal</a> for establishments to ply you with unlimited mimosa over Eggs Benedict.</p>

<p>The agency tells the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150521210140/http://www.thenycalliance.org/press-release-detail.php?id=91">New York City Hospitality Alliance</a> that brunch is considered an &quot;event,&quot; making for a convenient loophole around their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150521210140/http://codes.lp.findlaw.com/nycode/ABC/8/117-a">NY 117-A law</a>. In their words:</p>

<blockquote>Serving unlimited drinks to a patron is prohibited under the Alcoholic Beverage Control law, and instances of over serving by our licensees will be investigated and prosecuted.   However, there is a limited exception in the statute when the service of alcohol is incidental to the event, such as in the case of certain brunch specials.  

<p>Even under these limited exceptions, licensees still have a legal obligation not to over serve patrons.  The SLA will continue to take a balanced regulatory approach by allowing licensees to conduct specials where alcohol is an accompaniment, while simultaneously cracking down on specials that promote excessive drinking.</p></blockquote><br>
 <br>
And with that, we breathe a gigantic vodka-scented sigh of relief. You put us through quite a roller coaster of emotions, SLA! It&apos;s enough to drive anyone to drink (and drink, and drink, and drink). <p></p>
