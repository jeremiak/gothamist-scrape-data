</div></div>					<p>There is no shortage of pizza joints populating the busy Brooklyn Heights/Cobble Hill area, but is there really such a thing as too much pizza? We think not. Third generation piazzaiolo Michele Iuliano opens the Brooklyn version of his East Village restaurant Luzzo&apos;s this week on a block of neighborhood-dividing Atlantic Avenue. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408102426/http://luzzosgroup.com/restaurants/luzzos-bk/">Luzzo&apos;s Brooklyn</a>, which opens tomorrow night, fires up plenty of pies from traditional Margheritas to versions topped with fried eggplant. They&apos;re also doing pizza &quot;montanara&quot;-stye, meaning the dough gets a quick fry before being topped with cheese and tomato sauce. </p>

<p>Standouts from the pizza menu include the Mikele ($20/26), with mozzarella, mushrooms, prosciutto and truffle pate and the Sorrentina ($21/27) with mozzarella, lemon slices, arugula and shrimp. The kitchen also turns out Italian specialties like fried calamari ($11), rice balls ($9) and eggplant parmigiana ($10). Lighter fare like salads and salumi plates are also on offer, plus pastas including cheese ravioli with walnut sauce and Sicilian specialty Paccheri alla Norma ($16) with eggplant and ricotta salata.</p>

<p>The restaurant found itself some charming digs inside the old Sosta space, which they&apos;ve made over with a more rustic feel, though they kept the lovely tiled oven. Up front, industrial chic bar stools provide a place to perch while sipping a glass of vino or enjoying some antipasti. The dining room proper uses brick walls, lots of wood and mismatched tables and chairs for a casual effect; chalkboard specials and a view into the kitchen lend a warm, neighborly tone as well. </p>

<p><em>145 Atlantic Avenue, (718) 855-6400; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408102426/http://luzzosgroup.com/restaurants/luzzos-bk/">luzzosbk.com</a>. Open Sunday - Wednesday noon to 11 p.m; Thursday - Saturday noon to midnight.</em></p>
