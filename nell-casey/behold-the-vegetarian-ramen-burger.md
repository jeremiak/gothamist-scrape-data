<p>Hard to believe it&apos;s been almost two and a half years since Keizo Shimamoto <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161007081038/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/01/100_ramen_burgers_coming_to_smorgas.php">introduced us to the Ramen Burger</a>, and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161007081038/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/17/ramen_burger_watch_2013.php">lines</a> haven&apos;t let up since. As lines are anathema to many of us, perhaps you (as I did) missed out on a newer Ramen Burger innovation: the Mushroom &quot;Veggie&quot; Burger. Yes, vegetarians, you can now spend your weekends queuing up for noodle burgers, too.</p>

<p>Shimamoto tells us the burger is composed of sliced crimini mushrooms, which the chef sautees in three different types of oil and finishes with a splash of soy sauce. Instead of the signature shoyu sauce, the vegetarian burger comes with homemade garlic aioli and arugula, sandwiched between the toothsome &quot;buns&quot; made up of soft ramen noodles that&apos;ve been toasted on the flattop. There aren&apos;t actual veggies in the burger (scattering of scallions notwithstanding), but Shimamoto has been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161007081038/https://www.instagram.com/p/_XYbVGNaaP/?taken-by=goramen">experimenting</a> with a veggie patty, recently. </p>

<p>The burger is available on Saturdays and Sundays when the Ramen Burger operation <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161007081038/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/18/photos_smorgasburg_and_brooklyn_fle.php">pops up at the Industry City Smorgasburg</a> and it can also be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161007081038/https://www.grubhub.com/restaurant/the-original-ramen-burger-by-keizo-shimamoto-13-13-40th-ave-long-island-city/316946?classicAffiliateId=%2Fr%2Fw%2F35230%2Frestaurant%2F316946">delivered to your door</a>&#x2014;along with the OG RB&#x2014;if you live in Astoria, Long Island City and select parts of Brooklyn. Shimamoto is also operating his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161007081038/http://gothamist.com/2015/06/25/ramen_burger_shack_queens.php">excellent Ramen Shack</a> out of the Sunset Park winter pop-up if a steaming bowl of noodle soup is what you&apos;re looking for.</p>
