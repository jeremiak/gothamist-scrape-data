<p>Are you <em>sure</em> that white tuna roll you ordered from your local sushi joint is <em>actually</em> tuna? Because chances are extremely high that it&apos;s actually snake mackerel, a type of fish that contains a toxin known to... cause severe diarrhea. Yummy! A conservation group called <a href="oceana.org/en">Oceana</a> recently released a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150222070148/http://oceana.org/sites/default/files/reports/Oceana_NYC_Seafood_Fraud_Report_FINAL.pdf">disturbing report [pdf]</a> that reveals &quot;widespread seafood fraud&quot; in New York City. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150222070148/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/08/warning_your_olive_oil_isnt_what_yo.php">Fraudulent food</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150222070148/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/13/study_most_honey_is_just_fake_polle.php">in this town</a>? We&apos;ve seen this movie before, especially <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150222070148/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/16/spicy_tuna_sushi_causes_salmonella.php">starring</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150222070148/http://gothamist.com/2009/11/24/dna_tests_finds_plenty_of_sushi_mis.php">sushi</a>.</p>

<p>The group obtained 143 fresh seafood samples&#x2014;from restaurants, small markets and national chain grocery stores&#x2014;and found that 39% sold or served mislabeled fish. Of the 81 retail outlets sampled, 58% (three in five) sold mislabeled product. National chains fared the best, with only 12% carrying fraudulent stock, while small markets ranked significantly higher at 40% mislabeled fish. Perhaps most disturbing considering the city&apos;s love affair with Japanese restaurants, 100% (We repeat: ONE. HUNDRED. PERCENT.) of the 16 sushi bars they tested sold mislabeled fish. None of these stores or restaurants were named in the study, but researches collected the majority of their samples from Manhattan. </p>

<p>Researchers discovered that besides tuna, red snapper was the most commonly mislabeled product. Their tests revealed &quot;red snapper&quot; samples to be either a lower quality type of snapper or, among many others, tilefish, a variety of seafood the FDA advises people not to eat due to the extremely high levels of mercury. Aside from health concerns, consumers are being cheated when they assume they&apos;re buying top quality products and instead getting lesser-valued fish. Dining or shopping &quot;in higher-end eateries and retail outlets&#x2026;did not guarantee an honestly labeled seafood meal or purchase.&quot; </p>

<p>Good thing Big Soy Sauce already <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150222070148/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/11/theres_a_movie_about_the_history_of.php">has their PR machine running on high</a>. </p>
