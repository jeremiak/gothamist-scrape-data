<p>Chef Sue Torres&apos;s exemplary Mexican eatery <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509171058/http://suenosnyc.com/">Suenos</a> will serve its last meal at the end of March. The 11-year-old restaurant sent notice to friends and fans that they would close after service on March 23rd, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509171058/http://ny.eater.com/archives/2014/02/sue_torres_to_shutter_suenos_after_service_on_march_23.php">Eater reports</a>. &quot;We could go on for hours about the plight of small businesses in these economic times, but we are sure you have heard enough of that in the news,&quot; Torres and team say. &quot;This is a decision that we, ultimately, had to make for ourselves.&quot;</p>

<p>The eatery received high praise from critics at the <em>Times</em> for its inventive and exciting cooking. On a recent visit, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509171058/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/17/mexican_barbecue_and_smokey_mezcal.php#photo-7">we were enamored</a> with the rich Smoked Duck Confit and succulent glazed pork ribs and fascinated by la Cocinera <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509171058/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/17/mexican_barbecue_and_smokey_mezcal.php#photo-5">making fresh tortillas</a> in the dining room. We&apos;d also like to thank Chef Torres for introducing us to mezcal, tequila&apos;s scotch-like cousin.</p>

<p>Seriously, if you have never been, go to Suenos before the end of March. Sit by the cute/hokey outdoor fountain scene, order up a grapefruit margarita and enjoy wonderfully authentic, rib-sticking Mexican cuisine. </p>
