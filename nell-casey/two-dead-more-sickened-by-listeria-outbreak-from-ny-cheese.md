<p>A multi-state outbreak of Listeria linked to the consumption of soft cheese has sickened at least six people so far, two of whom subsequently died. </p>

<p>Today, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170702120704/https://www.cdc.gov/listeria/outbreaks/soft-cheese-03-17/map.html">issued a recall</a> of four soft wash-rind raw milk cheeses from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170702120704/http://www.vultocreamery.com/">Vulto Creamery</a>, which hand makes small batch cheese in the Catskills. The company&apos;s Ouleout, Miranda, Heinennellie, and Willowemoc cheeses are named in the recall after &quot;epidemiologic and laboratory evidence&quot; linked Vulto to the outbreak. </p>

<p>Stores <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170702120704/https://www.fda.gov/Safety/Recalls/ucm545716.htm?source=govdelivery&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery">including Whole Foods</a> have issued their own recalls related to the products in multiple states including New York, where the bulk of the outbreaks&#x2014;though not the deaths&#x2014;have occurred. </p>

<p>The first recognized illness was reported in September of 2016, with two other reported illnesses last year. The next three were all reported in January of this year. &quot;Ill people range in age from less than one year to 89 years, with a median age of 55,&quot; according to the CDC. &quot;Five of six ill people are female.&quot; One illness was reported in a newborn; one death occurred in Connecticut and another in Vermont.</p>
