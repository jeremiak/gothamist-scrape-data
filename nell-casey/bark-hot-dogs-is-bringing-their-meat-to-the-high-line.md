<p>The popular Park Slope hot doggery is expanding their franchise with a new, seasonal Manhattan location on warm weather mainstay <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160206052621/http://gothamist.com/tags/highline">The High Line</a>. On May 26th the stand will open its &quot;doors&quot; at the Chelsea Market Passage on 10th Avenue between 15th and 16th streets serving an abridged version of their restaurant menu. Choose from a classic dog, veggie dog or Nueske&apos;s Smoked Cheddar Brat for the tubular offerings and a hamburger or veggie burger for something between-the-buns, all priced under $7. You can also customize your meal with free toppings like sweet pepper relish, diced red onions and sauerkraut from the Fixins Bar to make your own special creation. </p>

<p>Bark&apos;s expansive rooftop outpost in Brooklyn Bridge Park&apos;s Pier 6 also returns this spring with an additional sixty-seat indoor space just in case the weather isn&apos;t cooperating. Expect the same bare-<em>bones</em> menu as The High Line stand, but unlike its Manhattan brother, the Pier 6 location also has a respectable list of draft and canned beers ($4-$6)&#x2014;mostly of the Sixpoint variety&#x2014;as well as Gotham Project wines on tap ($8).</p>

<p>Both locations will stay open through October 15th and, weather permitting, may stay open even later. We didn&apos;t need another excuse to visit our lovely city parks but we&apos;re certainly not disappointed to be given two more!</p>
