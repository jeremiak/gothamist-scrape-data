<p>Just when the abolishment of tipping has become headline news, one <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160406062057/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/14/no_tipping_danny_meyer.php">pioneer in the movement</a> is being sued for alleged wage theft. Two former employees of Danny Meyer&apos;s Gramercy Tavern have filed a lawsuit against the restaurateur for failing to pay them the proper wage, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160406062057/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/12049736/New-Yorks-pioneering-no-tipping-restaurateur-sued-over-tips.html">reports Telegraph</a>. Two former bussers say they were paid the $5-per-hour wage given to staff who receive gratuities but were forced to share said gratuities in a pool with other members of the staff, meaning they should have been paid at the full minimum wage of $8.75-per-hour. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160406062057/https://www.scribd.com/fullscreen/293063209?access_key=key-8qWhS72pnVGNIPzWqnom&amp;allow_share=true&amp;escape=false&amp;view_mode=scroll">The lawsuit</a> also alleges that the two men named in the suit, Uzzol Siddiky and Kawsar Maruf, were improperly compensated during private dining events at the restaurant, saying they didn&apos;t see earnings from the 20% service charge added to checks at those events. Additionally, the suit has been filed as a class action complaint, as the plaintiffs allude to over 100 other employees who&apos;ve experienced some kind of wage violation under Union Square Hospitality Group.</p>

<p>&quot;Union Square Hospitality Group has systems in place to comply with all employment regulations,&quot; the group said in a statement. &quot;We have always cared deeply about cultivating a strong employee-first culture, and we will review this matter thoroughly.&quot; </p>

<p>By the end of next year, all of USHG&apos;s restaurants will abandon the tipping model in favor of a &quot;Hospitality Included&quot; model that increases some menu item prices by 21-25%. The move has been met with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160406062057/http://gothamist.com/2015/11/22/what_is_this_socialism.php">some resistance</a> by diners, but other restaurants are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160406062057/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/01/one_of_nycs_most_expensive_restaura.php">adopting similar policies</a> in the trend towards a service-included model. </p>
