<p>We already know there are some <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131128060058/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/10/look_at_this_crazy_blue_lobster.php">freaky-looking lobsters</a> out there in ocean, but this six-clawed crustacean blows the rest of them out of the water. A lobsterman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131128060058/http://boston.cbslocal.com/2013/09/07/six-clawed-lobster-captured-off-hyannis/">snagged this rare beast</a> off the coast of Hyannis, Massachusetts and, instead of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131128060058/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/13/top_10_lobster_dishes_to_help_you_c.php">feeding it to the clamoring masses</a>, he decided to preserve its uniqueness for the internet to behold.  </p>

<p>The crew donated the lobster to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131128060058/http://www.maine.gov/dmr/rm/aquarium/exhibits.htm">Maine State Aquarium</a>, where marine scientist David Libby explained that he&apos;d seen deformities like these before, but this mutation was rare. &quot;Sometimes the genes will just get a little mixed and it will grow a funny claw,&quot; he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131128060058/http://bangordailynews.com/2013/09/06/news/state/lola-the-six-clawed-lobster-finds-new-home-at-maine-state-aquarium/">told the Bangor Daily News</a>. &quot;But I&apos;ve never seen anything like this.&quot;</p>

<p>The four pound lobster&#x2014;dubbed Lola&#x2014;joins a tank full of other lobster curiosities at the aquarium, where she&apos;ll live out her life free from average lobster bullying...and as the source of all our aquatic nightmares. </p>
