Ruffles MAX Beer-Battered Onion Ring Flavored Potato Chips &quot;[brings] guys the awesome flavor and delicious crunch of one of their favorite snack foods&#x2014;beer battered onion rings&#x2014;to a potato chip,&quot; according to the PepsiCo press release. To put a finer point on this potato innovation, let&apos;s hear from Tony Matta,&#xA0;vice president&#xA0;of market for Frito-Lay North America:</p>

<blockquote>&#x201C;Guys live for those moments when they&#x2019;re hanging out together at a bar, diner or tailgate party trading epic stories and munching on their favorite snacks. We wanted to incorporate that flavor for guys to share for any impromptu gathering&#xA0;-- just grab a bag off the shelf and throw a party with your crew.&#x201D;</blockquote>

<p>Really, guys? Do you <em>&quot;live&quot;</em> for those moments when you&apos;re crushing bags of Ruffles and chest-bumping in a parking lot? Do you regularly grab your &quot;crew&quot; for some &quot;impromptu&quot; munching on artificially-flavored fried potatoes? </p>

<p>To be sure, this isn&apos;t the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150524051550/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/25/new_greek_brogurt_makes_you_strong.php">first product meant to tap the grossly underserved Man Market</a>.

But honestly, <em>dudes</em>, where does it end? Just shut up and eat some Funyuns. YES you can dip them in warm Nutella if that makes you happy. </p>
