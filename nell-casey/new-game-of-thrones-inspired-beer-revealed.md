<p>Now our watch begins...for the release of Ommegang and HBO&apos;s second <em>Game of Thrones</em> tie-in beer: Take The Black Stout. Yesterday word came down about the new brew, which Ommegang says will be released at some point this fall. Instead of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428172246/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/17/got_beer_hboommegang_releasing_iron.php">Lannister&apos;s golden locks</a>, this beer channels the vows of the men of the Night&apos;s Watch. Per the label:</p>

<blockquote>A stout as dark as the winters that once engulfed Westeros, as robust as the men who swear their oaths at the Weirwood Tree. Chocolate &amp;  caramel sweetness are balanced by hop bitterness. Roasty, woodsy notes an an earthy finish.</blockquote>

<p>The beer packs a hearty 7% ABV, perfect for warming the body on cold nights up on The Wall. The beautiful label design, which shows a weeping Weirwood tree, was designed by a52, the studio that created the brilliant opening credits for the show. </p>

<p>It&apos;s going to be a long winter for fans eager for the next season&#x2014;especially if you&apos;ve <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428172246/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/14/should_you_read_the_game_of_thrones.php">read the books!</a>&#x2014;so at least we have some liquid encouragement to keep us occupied.</p>
