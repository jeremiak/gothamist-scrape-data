Just before the onions are done, add the garlic, red pepper flakes, oregano and bay leaf and cook until fragrant. Add the tomato paste and cook for several minutes then season with salt and pepper. Next, add the crushed tomatoes and red wine. Reduce heat low and let simmer for about 10-15 minutes. Add the turkey cook for a few minutes to heat up. Season with more salt and pepper as needed. \r\n\<br\>\<br\>\r\nFor the gnocchi, combine all the ingredients in a bowl and mix to combine. Depending on how dry or runny your potatoes are to begin with, you may need to add more or less flour. Start with 1 cup of flour for every 2 cups of mashed potato and add more if needed. Lightly flour a flat surface and roll out the mixture until it\'s about an inch thick. Cut 1 inch cubes then roll each piece with a fork to create the ribs. Drop the dumplings in salted boiling water until they float to the top. \r\n\<br\>\<br\>\r\nStrain then top with turkey ragout, parmesan cheese and fresh basil.\r\n\<br\>\<br\>\r\n\<strong\>Quick cheat:\<\/strong\> Use your favorite store brand tomato sauce and just add the turkey and veggies.\r\n\<br\>\<br\>\r\n\<strong\>Variation:\<\/strong\> Instead of a red sauce, thin out leftover gravy with chicken stock, wine or just plain old water.

While they won\'t be much like a real soup dumpling, the gravy heats up nicely inside the wonton wrapper, giving the filling a nice, juice quality. \r\n\<br\>\<br\>\r\n\<u\>For the dumplings\<\/u\>:\r\n\<li\>1 package wonton wrappers\<\/li\>\r\n\<li\>1/2 cup leftover turkey, finely chopped\<\/li\>\r\n\<li\>1/4 cup leftover stuffing, finely chopped\<\/li\>\r\n\<li\>1 green onion, chopped\<\/li\>\r\n\<li\>1 egg yolk\<\/li\>\r\n\<li\>leftover gravy, cold (should be slightly gelatinous)\<\/li\>\r\n\<br\>\<br\>\r\n\<u\>For the dipping sauce\<\/u\>:\r\n\<li\>1/2 cup chicken stock\<\/li\>\r\n\<li\>1/4 cup cranberry sauce (if you\'re using whole berries, macerate first)\<\/li\>\r\n\<li\>1-2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar (to taste)\<\/li\>\r\n\<li\>2 tablespoons soy sauce\<\/li\>\r\n\<li\>lemon zest (optional)\<\/li\>\r\n\<\/li\>1 squirt sriracha (optional)\<\/li\>\r\n\<br\>\<br\>\r\nTo make the dumplings: Combine turkey, stuffing, onion and egg in a bowl and mix until combined. If the mixture seems very dry, add a few tablespoons of water until it\'s soft but not wet. Lay the wonton wrappers on a clean surface and spoon approximately half to a full tablespoon of the turkey mixture onto each wonton. Spoon a teaspoon of the cold gravy on top of turkey mixture. \r\n\<br\>\<br\>\r\nTo seal the dumplings, dip your finger in water and run it along the edges of the wrapper. Fold in half, then begin making pleats with one side of the wrapper, making sure to make a tight seal with both sides. (Here\'s an \<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MBX-SXnmg\"\>awesome video\<\/a\> that shows you how to seal the dumplings. Skip ahead to the 2:15 mark to see the technique.) Place completed dumplings on a floured sheet pan underneath a damp kitchen towel. \r\n\<br\>\<br\>\r\nHeat about half a tablespoon of vegetable oil (enough to cover the bottom of the pan) over medium heat. Fry the dumplings until the bottoms are golden brown, approximately three minutes. Add 1/4 cup of water to the pan and cover immediately, steaming for an additional 3 minutes or until dumplings are heated through. Serve immediately with dipping sauce. \r\n\<br\>\<br\>\r\nTo make the sauce: heat chicken stock in a small pot over medium-low heat. When the stock is simmering, add the cranberry sauce and balsamic and cook until reduced by half. Remove from the heat and let cool, then add lemon zest and sriracha before serving.", "credit":""};galleryObj['photo_6'] = photo;</script>
