<p>The team behind <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160711235843/http://www.okonomibk.com/">OKONOMI</a>, the tiny Williamsburg eatery that&apos;s part exquisite Japanese breakfast spot and part ramen-ya, has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160711235843/https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/yujiharaguchi/osakana">begun a Kickstarter campaign</a> to open a Japanese-style fish market elsewhere in the neighborhood. Meaning &quot;honor your fish&quot; in Japanese, OSAKANA will offer seasonal seafood, changing daily, as well as a space for learning about different types of fish and how to prepare them. They&apos;re hoping to also offering tastings, meals and special discussions in the space.</p>

<p>Their timeline for opening is small, with plans to open a few blocks from their current Ainslie Street home sometime in July of this year, if the campaign gets funded. They&apos;re currently seeking $50,000, which would enable them to construct the minimalist design of the retail area and kitchen. Three years ago, a similar Kickstarter campaign allowed them to open their first brick-and-mortar.</p>

<p>They have lofty ambitious outside of the market, including a six seat ramen bar, where they&apos;d serve their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160711235843/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/18/best_ramen_nyc.php">top notch</a> seafood-based ramens, which&apos;ll happen if they achieve $75,000 in funding. At $100,000, they&apos;ll be able to also (hopefully) get a liquor license, which they&apos;ll use for &quot;omakase dinners that will pair exciting preparations of seafood and sashimi with assorted Japanese whiskeys.&quot;</p>
