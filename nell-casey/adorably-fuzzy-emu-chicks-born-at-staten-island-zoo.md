<p>Well hello there adorable little puffs of feathers! Meet these two emu chicks who are the newest additions to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130527060517/http://www.statenislandzoo.org/">Staten Island Zoo</a>. In honor of Earth Day, the zoo <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130527060517/https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=555596597825230&amp;set=a.138730752845152.40664.100001246835859&amp;type=1&amp;theater">released this cute photo on its Facebook page</a> of the siblings soaking up some rays. The pair were born on April 9th and April 10th to the zoo&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130527060517/http://www.flickr.com/photos/estevesm/65793258/">adult emu pair</a>, Darla and Mr. Manushin, whom curator and veterinarian Marc Valitutto tells us are extremely happy with their growing family. While one of the chicks is already <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130527060517/https://twitter.com/LynnePatton/status/323148128293384193">named Lynne</a>, the zoo doesn&apos;t yet know the sex of the other, so will hold off naming it until the DNA tests are returned.</p>

<p>Emus are the largest native bird in Australia and the second largest bird in the world after the ostrich. Their eggs&#x2014;which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130527060517/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20120305/murray-hill-gramercy/emu-eggs-have-adventurous-chefs-mouths-watering-at-union-square-market">some people like to eat!</a>&#x2014;are bright emerald green and equivalent in size to a dozen chicken eggs. When full grown, emus can stand up to 6.5 feet tall and weigh between 70 and 100 pounds. For now, these little puffballs clock in at just about one pound.</p>
