<p>Can a cookie really be a cookie unless it&apos;s a cookie flavored with its own cookie flavor? Or something? These are the kinds of deep questions Nabisco made us ask ourselves with the rerelease of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160304235100/http://www.theimpulsivebuy.com/wordpress/2013/09/16/spotted-on-shelves-9162013/">Cookies n&apos; Creme Oreo</a>, which appears to be an Oreo flavored with...Oreo.</p>

<p>Like some kind of Oreo mobius strip, this sneaky flavor appears to be regular Oreo cookie pieces stuffed with Cookies n&apos; Cream (aka Oreo) ice cream-flavored cream.
