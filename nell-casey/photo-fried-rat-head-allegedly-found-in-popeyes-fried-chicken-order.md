<p>Is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108024753/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/30/everythings_a_hoax_i_am_zardulu.php#photo-1">Zardulu</a> back to her <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108024753/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/07/journalism.php">old tricks</a> or did a Popeyes in Harlem serve a woman a deep fried rat&apos;s head? These are the questions we&apos;re faced with today following a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108024753/https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=2093899604168482&amp;set=p.2093899604168482&amp;type=3&amp;theater">Facebook post</a> by a woman who claims to have discovered a battered and deep-fried rodent head amidst pieces of fried chicken in an order from a Popeyes on Frederick Douglass Boulevard. That&apos;s the great thing about fast food: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108024753/http://time.com/4496806/donald-trump-jimmy-fallon-fast-food/">&quot;at least you know what you&apos;re getting.&quot;</a></p>

<p>As <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108024753/https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20160919/west-harlem/rat-head-found-popeyes-chicken-meal-harlem-woman-claims">first reported by DNAinfo</a>, Rosemary Thomas posted a photoset of the alleged rodent addition to Facebook last night. &quot;Friends and family, this is a meal Popeyes in Harlem served my daughter, my niece and sister,&quot; she says in the caption. &quot;This is clearly a rat and they have the nerve to have a 5 rating by the department of health.&quot;</p>

<p>Health Department records show that the restaurant does currently boast an A grade. </p>

<p>A rep for Popeyes corporate told DNAinfo they were investigating the claims and that when odd food items are found amongst the chicken parts it &quot;usually turn[s] out to be chicken organs.&quot; Organs...with eyes!</p>

<p>The photos make a compelling case for Deep Fried Rat, but nothing will beat the legendary <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108024753/http://gothamist.com/2014/07/08/rat_wrap_chopt.php">Rat Wrap of 2014</a>. </p>
