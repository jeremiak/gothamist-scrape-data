<p>Smorgasburg and the Brooklyn Flea celebrated a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170404211442/http://gothamist.com/2017/04/02/photos_smorgasburg_2017.php#photo-1">big season kickoff</a> at their two Brooklyn outposts this past weekend, and it looks like the team&apos;s next big conquest will be Manhattan. Jonathan Butler and Eric Demby have signed a two year lease at 76 Varick Street, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170404211442/http://ny.eater.com/2017/4/3/15164526/smorgasburg-soho-manhattan">Eater reports</a>, where they&apos;ll be operating a daily market that&apos;ll be a combination of food, drink and non-edible products. Right now, the site&apos;s an empty lot bordered by the busy approach to the Holland Tunnel, making this the most outwardly urban of all of their operations.</p>

<p>Information about specific vendors isn&apos;t available just yet, but this market already differentiates itself from its siblings in several distinct ways. First, it&apos;ll be open seven days a week, with a smaller weekly market and a larger presence on the weekends. It will also be year-long, with a covered area for less seasonable months. And finally, the lot will welcome food trucks, making setup/breakdown a lot easier for some vendors.</p>

<p>&quot;We are looking forward to having a chance to present this exciting plan to the Community Board next week and hear their feedback before talking publicly about any more details,&quot; Butler told Gothamist this afternoon. &quot;In the meantime, we&#x2019;d love to hear from chefs who might be interested in using this as an opportunity to launch an elevated food truck concept.&quot;</p>

<p>The Community Board will be asked to give their blessing on a liquor license for the location, and Demby tells Eater they&apos;re hoping to bring in an Airstream in which to house a bar. </p>

<p>Smorgasburg&apos;s previous forays into the borough of Manhattan included a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170404211442/http://gothamist.com/2014/09/20/central_park_smorgasburg_forced_to.php">stressful Central Park</a> attempt and a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170404211442/http://gothamist.com/2016/05/27/seaport_smorgasburg.php">residency at the South Street Seaport</a>, which is apparently coming to an end this summer just as this new Hudson Square setup comes online. But <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170404211442/http://gothamist.com/2017/03/30/spaghetti_donuts_smorgasburg.php#photo-1">will there be spaghetti donuts</a>? </p>
