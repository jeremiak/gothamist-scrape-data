<p>Since first launching in 2012, Caviar has begun to soften Seamless&apos;s vice-like grip on our dinner delivery addiction by partnering with restaurants that wouldn&apos;t ordinarily opt for delivery, making things like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170325220431/http://gothamist.com/2016/05/18/emmy_squared_delivery.php">super hyped pizza</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170325220431/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/02/fuku_delivery_siren.php">star chef dishes</a> available pretty much anywhere. This weekend, add Danny Meyer&apos;s name to that list, as Shake Shack will be testing out delivery at eight NYC locations, Friday through Sunday only.</p>
