<p>As it is with pizza and bagels, every day is Burger Day in NYC, from the lowbrow bar versions to the over the top creations we&apos;ll only dream about. To wholeheartedly celebrate the humble meat patty meal we have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161007055812/http://info.schweidandsons.com/nycburgerweek">Burger Week</a>, an annual tribute to the staple of backyard bbqs and fast food joints everywhere. Now in its fifth year, the foodie fest presents burger lovers of all kinds with off-menu treats at their local watering holes, fun chef mashups and even some amped up burger crawls designed to test the top button on your Levis. There&apos;s a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161007055812/http://info.schweidandsons.com/nycburgerweek">new event each day</a> during the May 1st through 7th fete; here&apos;s what we&apos;ll be chowing down on:</p>

<p>On opening day, it&apos;s the <strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161007055812/http://info.schweidandsons.com/news-and-events/nyc-burger-week-boozy-burger-brunch">Boozy Burger Brunch</a></strong>, which, unfortunately is already sold out during more &quot;traditional&quot; brunch times. However, there&apos;s still a 4 p.m. seating available, which is really a more reasonable time to begin bourbon and beer pairings if you&apos;d still like to be functional the rest of the day. At <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161007055812/http://beerculture.nyc/">Beer Culture</a> on West 45th Street, attendees get three specialty mini burgers of Schweid &amp; Sons Certified Angus Beef, each paired with either a Heaven Hill bourbon or a beer from Gun Hill Brewing Co. The menu: Poutine Burger (tater tots, brown gravy, melted cheese curds), BBQ Burger (Beer Culture BBQ sauce, bacon, cheddar, fried onions) and Saturday Morning Cartoon (Fried egg, bacon and American cheese on a fresh toast baguette). <em>Sunday, May 1st, 4 p.m. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161007055812/http://info.schweidandsons.com/news-and-events/nyc-burger-week-boozy-burger-brunch">Tickets $30</a></em></p>

<p>Riding the rainbow wave of colorful foodstuffs, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161007055812/http://www.joesbarnyc.com/">Joe&apos;s Bar</a> on the UWS is hosting the <strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161007055812/http://info.schweidandsons.com/ny-burger-events/nyc-burger-week-golden-burger-lift-dinner">Golden Burger Lift Dinner</a></strong>, with Willy Wonka-themed burgers and cocktails including a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161007055812/https://www.instagram.com/p/BErUuaCCPDx/">rainbow bun burger</a>, naturally. Accompanying the burger, Grandpa Joe&apos;s French Fries, made sloppy joe-style, as well as a choice between three cocktails and a Chocolate Fever Dessert, among other things. <em>Monday, May 2nd, 6:30 p.m. or 8:30 p.m. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161007055812/http://info.schweidandsons.com/ny-burger-events/nyc-burger-week-golden-burger-lift-dinner">Tickets $34</a></em></p>
