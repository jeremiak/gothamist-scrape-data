</div></div>					<p>A new cocktail and small bites venue flutters into Tribeca tomorrow when <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150905233612/http://thebutterflynyc.com/">The Butterfly</a> opens its doors on West Broadway. The newest venture from the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150905233612/http://www.altamareagroup.com/">Altamarea Group</a>, the team behind <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150905233612/http://gothamist.com/2010/12/06/photos_ai_fiori_michael_whites.php#photo-1">Ai Fiori</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150905233612/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/18/photos_nicoletta_the_east_villages.php#photo-1">Nicoletta</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150905233612/http://gothamist.com/2010/10/04/photo_tour_chef_michael_whites_oste.php#photo-1">Osteria Morini</a> and other <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150905233612/http://gothamist.com/2008/08/13/chef_michael_white_convivio.php">Michael White</a>-helmed projects, channels America&apos;s mid-century, with retro design elements from the &apos;50s and interpretations of classic American cocktails from Eben Freeman.</p>

<p>Patrons can sip a Mai Tai or a Brandy Old Fashioned with Korbel brandy, house cherries and soda while seated at the bamboo-bedecked bar or on one of the long booths that line the walls. A large table for a group occupies the front window section of the restaurant, while a cozy nook at the rear offers intimate seating for two. Sunburst clocks, etched mirrors and colorful accent pieces further the vintage vibe. Not quite so retro: the flatscreen television on the back wall. Don&apos;t want to miss those Mets gaffes! </p>

<p>Comfort food small plates by Michael White&apos;s team include Reuben Croquettes stuffed with corned beef, sauerkraut and Thousand Island dressing; a Patty Melt made with aged prime beef, topped with charred onion aioli and Swiss cheese on toasted rye; and the Butterfly BLT Salad with avocado, soft boiled egg and warm bacon dressing. If those options aren&apos;t filling enough, try the Fried Chicken accompanied by honey biscuits and slaw or the Veggie Pot Pie, filled with with peas and carrots. Finish off your meal with a Copa Cola&#x2014;coca cola ice cream with caramel corn and whiskey cream&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150905233612/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/18/how_we_drank.php#photo-1">just like in the old days</a>.</p>
