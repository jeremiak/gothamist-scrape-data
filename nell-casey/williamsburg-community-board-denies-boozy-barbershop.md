<p>An East Village barber shop doubling as a speakeasy met with local opposition this week when their liquor license bid for a forthcoming Williamsburg outpost failed to win <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160307001605/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/beer-serving-barbershop-rejected-williamsburg-article-1.1370879?localLinksEnabled=false">approval from the Community Board</a>. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160307001605/http://blindbarber.com/">Blind Barber</a>, which operates a storefront barbershop with a secret lounge in the back, has been open on 10th Street in Alphabet City for several years and is now expanding, logically, into Williamsburg. The team is eying a spot on Lorimer and Ainslie Streets, a decidedly more residential stretch of the &apos;Burg than nearby Metropolitan. </p>

<p>At a Tuesday night hearing, the full board voted against a liquor license, despite a smaller Community Board 1 committee approving the setup earlier in the process. Neighbors acquired 500 signature petitions against the new business, citing the area&apos;s already dense population of bars. &quot;We are going to fight this,&quot; next-door neighbor Sal Vassallo <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160307001605/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/beer-serving-barbershop-rejected-williamsburg-article-1.1370879?localLinksEnabled=false">told the Daily News</a>. &quot;They can have a barber shop. They can cut hair. They can even use a blind barber. But don&apos;t use alcohol.&quot; </p>

<p>Each haircut or shave at the men&apos;s grooming facility comes with a free beverage, but the larger bar space is open to anyone looking to have a cocktail or five. Of the 170 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160307001605/http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-blind-barber-new-york">Yelp reviews</a>, only 13 mention the haircuts and 6 mention a shave, though maybe patrons are too tipsy post-imbibing to remember much about their haircare experience?</p>

<p>Owner Jeff Lamb doesn&apos;t put much stock in the CB&apos;s ability to block his venture, quipping that &quot;they don&apos;t even know what they are protesting.&quot; Ultimately, the decision rests with the State Liquor Authority, who will decide the barber-bar&apos;s fate later this summer. Whether the SLA listens to the dwindling but vocal community of Old Timer&apos;s steadily getting pushed out by hirsute hipsters <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160307001605/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/12/why_do_neighbor-hated_bars_keep_get.php">remains to be seen</a>.</p>
