                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="072213streetvendors.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130822195250im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_nellcasey/072213streetvendors.jpg" width="640" height="427"> <br> <i> <span class="photo_caption">(<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130822195250/http://www.flickr.com/photos/michellerick/7054817481/">Michelle Rick</a>/Flickr)</span></i></div> <p></p>

<p>Just like a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130822195250/http://youtu.be/yo3RhN0ISug?t=3m">good staking</a>, for New York City&apos;s street vendors it all comes down to one thing: location. The Post <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130822195250/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/vends_justify_means_EItLNeuhqVZphVc5UiUM5K?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Local">examined the incomes</a> of well-placed street vendors around town, who revealed the &quot;big&quot; money they make by setting up in prime spots. 57-year-old vendor Peter Casimis earns between $250 and $400 a day from his hot dog cart, which he has parked outside Macy&apos;s on 35th and Broadway for years. Cemil Sag, who sells ice cream, says he banks $700 a day working on 37th Street and Fifth Avenue, though that figure must change when one&apos;s face is not <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130822195250/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/19/oppressively_hot_and_humid_today_co.php">in danger of melting</a>.   </p>

<p>Though each vendor pays $60 for a yearly vendor&apos;s license and $200 every two years for a tax identification number, they don&apos;t pay rent to occupy their corners. Where Casimis parks his hot dog cart, rents run about $600 a square foot per month; on Sag&apos;s corner, it&apos;s about $500. </p>

<p>It&apos;s tempting to bemoan your working stiff salary when you could be making more cash hawking hot dogs than filling out TPS reports. Yet as gleefully as the Post reports theses &quot;high wages,&quot; street vendors face myriad issues just to stay afloat. When they&apos;re not <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130822195250/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/14/_better_know_a_pushcart_vendor.php">battling over turf</a> they&apos;re <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130822195250/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/24/vendors_fight_for_lower_fines.php">batting the City Council</a> over the enormous fines received for things like improperly displaying their permit. And on top of all that: tourists. Ugh. We&apos;ll stick with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130822195250/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/02/internet_commenting_makes_us_fat_st.php">what we got</a>. </p>
