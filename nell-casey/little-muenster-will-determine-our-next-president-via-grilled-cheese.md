					<p>This year&apos;s Presidential election should be decided by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160803045141/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/08/neighborhood_donation_map.php">thoughtful consideration of ideas</a>, might be decided by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160803045141/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/05/louis_ck_really_doesnt_want_you_to.php">influential</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160803045141/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/10/video_triumph_the_insult_comic_dog_6.php">parties</a> but ought to be (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160803045141/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/05/donald_trump_supporters_embrace_mal.php">at this point</a>) decided by grilled cheese. From now until election day in November, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160803045141/http://gothamist.com/2014/05/30/hudson_eats.php">Hudson Eats</a> outpost of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160803045141/http://littlemuenster.com/">Little Muenster</a> will be holding their own polls, of sorts, with a menu of grilled cheeses modeled after the year&apos;s top nominees&#x2014;for as long as they stay in the race, of course. &quot;We wanted to do something that was both amusing and topical,&quot; explains owner Adam Schneider. &quot;The idea was to make light of what is such a serious time for the country and nothing is better than food and laughter so why not combine them?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The recipes are plays on the personality and platforms of each of the candidates. Whether it&apos;s their ancestry or socio-policitcal views, we tried to morph those ideas into a sandwich that represents the candidate and pokes just the right amount of fun at them. The goal is to have a laugh and make people politically aware.&quot;</p>

<p>Schneider came up with sandwiches like the &quot;Stickball For The People&quot; Platform ($12.50), a nod to the classic street game played by Brooklyn kids, for Bernie Sanders. The sandwich includes house-made pastrami (for his NYC heritage) and aged cheddar (...) from Vermont (as he&apos;s the Junior Senator from the state). Donald Trump&apos;s sandwich&#x2014;the &quot;Spray Tan&quot; Platform ($15)&#x2014;employs beef cheeks (since he&apos;s a &quot;cheeky bastard&quot;), E-Z spray cheddar cheese (for the &quot;all natural&quot; glow of his face) and gold leaf (for the gleaming gold Trump name that adorns his buildings).</p>

<p>Little Muenster has sandwiches for Hillary Clinton&#x2014;the &quot;Pantsuit Platform&quot; ($10.75)  for the candidate&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160803045141/https://twitter.com/HillaryClinton">devotion to the style</a>&#x2014;and Marco Rubio&#x2014;a Cuban sandwich ($13) alluding to his home city of Miami. There&apos;s another Cuban twist at play with &quot;The Cubantine&quot; ($9) to represent Ted Cruz, a play on his Cuban heritage combined with his birth country of Canada. They&apos;ll be topping a pile of fries poutine-style with chipotle gravy and Ellsworth farm cheese curds plus pulled pork and pickled jalapenos. </p>

<p>Each night, they&apos;ll <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160803045141/http://littlemuenster.com/#sandwich-democracy-section">update a graph</a> on their website to see who&apos;s performing better until the official election. &quot;As candidates drop out of the race, those sandwiches will quietly disappear from memory&#x2014;just like Buddy Roemer,&quot; reads the official announcement. </p>
