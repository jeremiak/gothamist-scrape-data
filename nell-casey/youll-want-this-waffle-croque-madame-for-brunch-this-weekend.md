<p>Deciding between a savory brunch and a sweet one will be simpler at Williamsburg&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108045647/http://www.loosieskitchen.com/">Looise&apos;s Kitchen</a>, where they&apos;re whipping up a <strong>Waffle Croque Madame</strong> ($15) that combines the best of brunch all in one dish. Fluffy waffles act as the bread in this riff on the classic French sandwich, which requires a heavy hand on the creamy bechamel sauce. On the inside, some country ham; on top, a sunny side up egg. Remember: the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108045647/https://www.instagram.com/p/BI-DcI4hyuK/">camera eats first</a>. </p>

<p>Elsewhere in brunch land, Brooklyn Winery&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108045647/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/20/bkw_brooklyn_winery.php#photo-1">new Crown Heights restaurant</a> <strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108045647/http://www.bkwnyc.com/">BKW</a> launches their weekend hangover therapy</strong>. On their brunch menu: Smoked Creamed Greens ($13, seen above), a Benedictian offering with poached eggs and sauce divine over English muffins; a Breakfast Burrito ($14) stuffed with egg whites, swiss chard, quinoa, black beans and a chipotle cream; and Bread Pudding French Toast ($15) either sweet with seasonal fruit or savory with sausage and aged cheddar.</p>

<p>With precious few weekends left of summer, soak up a few more of the season&apos;s flavors with a few friends over a <strong>seafood boil at Craftbar</strong>. Now through Labor Day weekend, reserve a table with a group and devour a grilled peach salad served with avocado and pickled watermelon plus chorizo hush puppies with a smoked clam aioli for dipping. Then the entree: a seafood boil of PEI Mussels, Gulf Shrimp and Skuna Bay Salmon with Cotija cheese-bathed corn and honey butter and thyme-drenched toast. The meal finishes with a duo of sorbets and there&apos;s either Allagash White beer or Blaufrankisch Rose throughout. Email astone@craftedhospitality.com for reservations; $49 per person.</p>
