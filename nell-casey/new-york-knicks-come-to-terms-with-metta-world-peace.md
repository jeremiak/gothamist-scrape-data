<p>Get ready for more <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130821135238/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/11/metta_world_peace_gives_fashion_adv.php">fashion forward basketball</a> in New York next season. According to a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130821135238/https://twitter.com/WojYahooNBA/status/356850870178160641">Yahoo! Sports report</a>, the New York Knicks have come to an agreement to bring aboard Free Agent forward Metta World Peace. The deal is reportedly for 2 years and will bring the Queensbridge product home after &quot;The Artest formerly known as Ron&quot; was released from his contract by the LA Lakers this past weekend.</p>

<p>Rumors began last week that the Lakers might release the former All Star, and the story picked up steam when his father, Ron Artest Sr., <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130821135238/http://www.nypost.com/p/sports/knicks/peace_at_hand_v93M3ZYfHLT3UdK9HBDNCK"> told the Post</a> that his son wanted to finish his career with the Knicks. By rule in the NBA&apos;s new collective bargaining agreement, World Peace was available for any team to claim via waivers, but may have postured his way into his long awaited homecoming by expressing interest in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130821135238/https://twitter.com/MettaWorldPeace/status/355476564776992768">playing overseas in China</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130821135238/https://twitter.com/MettaWorldPeace/status/355488522569912320">playing professional hockey</a>, or staying put in LA and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130821135238/http://www.latimes.com/sports/basketball/nba/lakers/la-sp-clippers-metta-world-peace-20130715,0,392940.story">playing for the Clippers</a>. </p>

<p>World Peace&apos;s odyssey home is a well-known tale in basketball circles. After making a name for himself in college at St. John&apos;s, Ron Artest (as he was known at the time) was passed on by the Knicks during the 1999 NBA draft for French uberbust <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130821135238/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrPjl-927Q">Frederic Weis</a> and wound up with the Chicago Bulls. After 14 years of All Star appearances, accolades, brawls with fans, and famously thanking his psychiatrist following the Lakers&apos; 2010 NBA championship, World Peace&apos;s long journey to New York City has finally come to an end. If everything goes according to plan, he will be expressing his gratitude to a subway busker on his way to a championship parade next summer with the Knicks. </p>
