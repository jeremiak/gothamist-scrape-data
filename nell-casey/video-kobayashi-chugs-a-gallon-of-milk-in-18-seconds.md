<p>Since this heat precludes getting any meaningful work done, let&apos;s watch this video of competitive eater <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130822073917/http://gothamist.com/tags/Kobayashi">Takeru Kobayashi</a> chugging a gallon of whole milk. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130822073917/http://gothamist.com/2011/07/07/hot_dog_scandal_how_many_did_kobaya.php">fallen hot dog idol</a> took on the infamous &quot;Milk Challenge&quot; at an appearance at Uncle Bob&apos;s Self Storage in Upper Saddle River, N.J., putting back the entire jug of cow juice in just 18 seconds. </p>

<p>While most attempts at this dairy disaster <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130822073917/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csvfui2P3ZU">result in regurgitation</a>&#x2014;warning: puke ahoy&#x2014;Uncle Bobs reps say not only did he keep it all down, afterwards he even had the stamina to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130822073917/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlsKQ45Pm3E">boogie with an Inflatable Waving Tube Man</a> (awkward). It should also be noted that the milk chugging came after the man had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130822073917/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k--E8NSbTE0">eaten 13 cupcakes</a> in under a minute. </p>
