<p>The Brooklyn Navy Yard added several new local tenants to its Food Manufacturing Hub in the forthcoming Building 77 development. The Hub, which will be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170111153118/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/01/russ_daughters_brooklyn_navy_yard.php">anchored by Russ &amp; Daughters</a> and Brooklyn Brewery when it opens mid-2017, announced six new food and beverage tenants joining the project, which had already welcomed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170111153118/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/14/mast_brothers_navy_yard.php">Mast Brothers</a> and Brooklyn Roasting Company last year.</p>

<p>The new roster includes tenants who&apos;ll use the space for both commissary operations, as well as takeout food options for Navy Yard employees and visitors. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170111153118/http://bkgreenery.com/">Brooklyn Greenery&apos;s</a> going to be making health foods including smoothies and juices for their second location inside the Navy Yard. Three of the vendors focus on global cuisine, including <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170111153118/http://www.grandchamps.nyc/">Grandchamps</a> (Haitian), <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170111153118/http://www.werubyou.com/">We Rub You</a> (Korean BBQ), and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170111153118/http://www.thefoodsermon.com/">The Food Sermon</a> (Caribbean). </p>

<p>Commissary Tiny Drumsticks out of LIC will bring on Smorgasburg vets <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170111153118/http://www.bitesizekitchen.com/">Bite Size Kitchen</a> to run the retail component out of their space, selling &quot;traditional American breakfast and lunch items,&quot; while Rustik Tavern&#x2014;based out of Bed-Stuy&#x2014;brings a comfort food and cocktail restaurant and bar.</p>

<p>The Food Hub&apos;s expected to bring between 150 and 250 new jobs, part of the 3,000 expected to be created with the completion of Building 77 in its entirety. </p>

<p>The Navy Yard will also be home to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170111153118/http://gothamist.com/2015/05/15/wegmans_rhapsody.php">hotly anticipated</a> NYC location of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170111153118/http://gothamist.com/2015/05/13/wegmans_grocery_store_is_coming_to.php">Wegmans grocery store</a>. We get excited about weird things these days. </p>
