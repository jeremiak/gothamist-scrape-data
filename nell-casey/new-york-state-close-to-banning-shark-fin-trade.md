<p>New York State is one step closer to banning the possession, sale, trade and distribution of shark fins. Yesterday the New York state unanimously passed bill S.1711b/A.1769b, which was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130601153029/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/17/new_york_lawmakers_are_looking_to_b.php">reintroduced last month</a> in an attempt to ban sale of the controversial delicacy. Now the bill moves to the Assembly, which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130601153029/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/21/shark_fin_soup_may_be_sunk_in_new_y.php">proposed a similar bill last year</a> that was, ironically, not voted on by the Senate. </p>

<p>&#x201C;After the disappointing end to last year&#x2019;s session, New York is getting a second chance to do the right thing for sharks,&#x201D; Beth Lowell, campaign director at Oceana said in a press release. &#x201C;Shark finning has extremely destructive consequences for shark populations worldwide, and this bill targets the trade that drives this practice.&#x201D; After the Assembly, it&apos;s just up to Governor Cuomo to sign the bill into law.</p>

<p>The expensive&#x2014;and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130601153029/http://gothamist.com/2012/08/10/study_your_pricey_shark_fin_soup_ma.php">horrifically inhumane</a>&#x2014;ingredient <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130601153029/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/23/spotted_in_chinatown_mounds_and_mou.php">can be procured in markets and restaurants</a> around town, though all that will end if the bill comes to law. The harvest of shark fins affects an estimated 73 millions sharks per year, many of whom are brutally maimed and ultimately killed. &quot;The decimation of the shark population is a serious concern as it has a detrimental trickle-down effect for the entire marine food chain,&quot; said Senator Mark Grisanti of Buffalo, who championed the bill. &quot;With some shark populations in serious peril, and other countries and states passing legislation to protect sharks, New York should be a leader in extending protection to these magnificent animals.&quot;</p>

<p>If the bill passes, New York would be the sixth state to ban the shark fin industry, in addition to three Pacific U.S. territories that have similar laws. Somewhere in the Atlantic, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130601153029/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ezkrrA4vhs">Jabberjaw</a> and his pals have their fins crossed. </p>
