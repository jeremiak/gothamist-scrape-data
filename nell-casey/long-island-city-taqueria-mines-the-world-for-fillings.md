<p>The versatility of the taco is being mined once again at a new DIY taqueria in Long Island City, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170226161709/http://www.unico.nyc/">Unico</a>, that opened on Monday. Behind the concept is Suvir Saran, who runs <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170226161709/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/27/tapestry_indian_west_village.php#photo-1">internationally-inspired restaurant</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170226161709/http://www.tapestryrestaurant.com/">Tapestry</a>, which opened last year in the West Village. Together with restaurateur Roni Mazumdar, Saran&apos;s offering &quot;global tacos&quot; in a choose-your-own-adventure-style setup of which tortilla configuration sounds best to you.</p>

<p>Fillings are what set Unico apart, announcing their heritage with options like Lima with shrimp, a crunchy mango-jicama-cabbage slaw, chile oil and two types of salsa, and Incheon, with Korean-style short ribs, kimchi, gochujang and salsa verde. If you thought the Korean taco trend was over, we&apos;ve apparently only just begun.</p>

<p>Diners choose the format (taco, enchilada, wrap or bowl), a filling, and any additions like roasted corn or guacamole, which are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170226161709/http://weknowmemes.com/2014/08/bitch-i-know-guac-is-extra/">extra</a>, obviously. </p>

<p>Early feedback <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170226161709/https://www.yelp.com/biz/unico-taco-long-island-city">skews positive</a>, and to further get the word out, Saran will be serving $7 tacos at Tapestry&apos;s bar, including the above two plus one inspired by India, one Rabbit Mole Taco, and a third that&apos;s &quot;Mexico via Vatican&quot; with Adobo pork. </p>
