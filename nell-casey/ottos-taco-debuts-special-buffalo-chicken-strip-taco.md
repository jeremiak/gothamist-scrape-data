<p>Our <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150803031341/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/30/ottos_tacos_gives_new_yorkers_tacos.php">favorite new taqueria</a>, the East Village&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150803031341/http://ottostacos.com/#home">Otto&apos;s Tacos</a>, has debuted the first of their special monthly tacos. For a week this month the tiny taqueria will be frying up Buffalo Chicken Strips Tacos; wonder where they <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150803031341/http://gothamist.com/2014/03/06/where_to_eat_wings.php">got that idea</a>?</p>

<p>The tacos start with a large chicken strip, which the restaurant fries and slathers in homemade Buffalo-style sauce made with Frank&apos;s Red Hot, naturally. The chicken gets nestled onto a bed of lettuce then drizzled with house-made buttermilk ranch and chopped scallions. The whole shebang comes wrapped in one of their superlative corn tortillas. </p>

<p>They&apos;re selling the special taco for $4 beginning March 17th through the 23rd out of their 2nd Avenue digs. Recommended pairing: the odd but totally addictive <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150803031341/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/30/ottos_tacos_gives_new_yorkers_tacos.php#photo-10">masa fries</a>. </p>
