<p>There was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171023144648/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/12/mekelburgs_prospect_heights.php#photo-1">this sandwich</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171023144648/https://www.instagram.com/p/7BW_jgkoOD/">that sandwich</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171023144648/http://gothamist.com/2015/07/06/a_pizzeria_serves_one_of_brooklyns.php">this burger</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171023144648/https://www.instagram.com/p/4AijoPkoN2/">those wings</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171023144648/http://gothamist.com/2015/03/02/ramen_lab_best_ramen.php">these noodles</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171023144648/https://www.instagram.com/p/7_uAxsEoNu/?taken-by=nellcasey">those noodles</a> (and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171023144648/https://www.instagram.com/p/1Wsor_EoKB/?taken-by=nellcasey">these noodles</a>, too!), but the best thing I ate all year in NYC was a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171023144648/https://www.instagram.com/p/19DoBskoNE/?taken-by=nellcasey">hot dog</a> from a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171023144648/http://gothamist.com/2015/04/27/secret_hot_dogs_williamsburg.php">hidden takeout window</a> inside an unassuming Williamsburg bar. Eating out a lot for work means eating a lot of gourmet grub, but at the end of the day, a humble hot dog is all I really want&#x2014;especially one that&apos;s actually made from cheese, not meat.</p>

<p>The Pan Con Queso from the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171023144648/http://www.santasalsanyc.com/brooklyn/">Santa Salsa</a> window located inside <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171023144648/http://www.overtheeight.com/">Over The Eight</a> is just about the best $5 you can spend, especially after downing a few of the bar&apos;s shot-and-beer combos. A hunk of white Latin cheese gets grilled, plopped into a hot dog bun and then buried under a fistful of onions, cabbage and crushed potato chips, with ketchup, mustard and the spot&apos;s parsley/cilantro Guasacaca sauce as the glue tenuously holding it all together. Naturally, you will top all of this with additional slices of avocado. </p>

<p>There isn&apos;t a clunker on the menu&#x2014;and meat-addicts can satisfy themselves with the Pero Con Todo, a $4 beef version that&apos;s nearly identical save for a sweet corn sauce topper. If you don&apos;t get a side of Yuca Frita, you&apos;re doing it all wrong, and if you don&apos;t employ every sauce in the caddy you&apos;re handed&#x2014;especially the vampire-repelling creamy garlic sauce&#x2014;you&apos;re <em>seriously</em> doing it all wrong. </p>

<p>Take it from the gal who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171023144648/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/17/best_new_restaurants_2015.php">ate all the things this year</a>: eat this potato chip-topped cheese stick, chase it with some yuca fries, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171023144648/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/27/the_top_5_ny_times_brunch_hate_read.php">nothing can get you down</a>.</p>
