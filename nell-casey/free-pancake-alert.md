<p>The free pancake promotion for National Pancake Day&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160313095659/http://foodimentary.com/today-in-national-food-holidays/march-food-holidays/">National Peanut Cluster Day</a> needs better PR!&#x2014;from IHOP has become one of the signature offerings by the breakfast brand, whose presence in NYC has steadily <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160313095659/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/09/midnight_in_pancakes_harlem_ihop_op.php">grown</a> (and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160313095659/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/14/west_village_ihop_vanishes_into_the.php">then diminished</a>) in recent years. But for the ones <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160313095659/http://www.ihop.com/ihop-locations">still around</a>, it&apos;s the day to offer up free short stacks of their sugary, griddle-cooked namesakes while they ask very kindly that you please donate money to charity. </p>

<p>The free festivities began at 7 a.m. and will run until 7 p.m. The chain promises &quot;one free short stack of Buttermilk pancakes&quot; per person if you&apos;re dining in the restaurant. In exchange, they ask that you donate money to the Children&apos;s Miracle Network Hospitals (or &quot;other designated local charities&quot;), efforts they say have net $20 million since the promotion began in 2006. </p>

<p>It&apos;s always a bit murky as to whether someone should pay for <em>something</em> at the table, which is presumably why they make the smell of bacon <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160313095659/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/22/east_village_problems_ihop_bacon_sm.php">impossible to escape</a>.</p>
