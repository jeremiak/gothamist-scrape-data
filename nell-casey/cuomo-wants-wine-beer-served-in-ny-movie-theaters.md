										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="011817cinemabooze.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20171024122112im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_nellcasey/011817cinemabooze.jpg" width="640" height="495"> <br> <i> Nitehawk Cinema (Foursquare)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>It&apos;s a time honored tradition to sneak alcohol into the movie theater. You think anyone&apos;s watching <em>Independence Day: Resurgence</em> sober? Please. Dine-in cinemas like Nitehawk and Alamo have the ability to sell alcohol, but attendees of first run cinemas are stuck with soda and a discreet flask unless a proposal through the Governor&apos;s office comes to pass. </p>

<p>During his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171024122112/https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/video-audio-rush-transcript-governor-cuomo-outlines-fy-2018-executive-budget-maintain-fiscal">budget address</a> yesterday, Cuomo revealed that his office is looking into allowing the sale of wine and beer in movie theaters across the state. </p>

<p>&quot;We also had a proposal that would allow alcohol and beer to be sold in movie theaters,&quot; he mentioned in his remarks. &quot;And it would be joined with an incentive program, to incentivize the movie theaters to sell New York wine and beer.&quot; </p>

<p>In 2011, Nitehawk Cinema owner Matthew Viragh <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171024122112/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/16/more_boozy_movie_theaters_please.php">fought</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171024122112/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/27/drink_during_the_movies_at_nitehawk.php">won</a> the ability to sell alcohol in movie theaters, but with the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171024122112/https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2011/S4772">stipulation</a> that &quot;theaters must have table seating and a full restaurant menu selection.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It would require a law change to allow alcohol and beer to be sold in a movie theater and to incentivize New York products to be sold in that venue,&quot; Cuomo admitted. Now who could be helpful in this regard...</p>

<p>The proposal is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171024122112/http://gothamist.com/2017/01/18/cuomo_budget_2017.php">part of Cuomo&apos;s $152.3 billion budget</a>, which is now in the hands of the &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171024122112/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/17/nyregion/andrew-cuomo-new-york-state-budget.html">wary</a>&quot; state legislature&#x2014;and hard alcohol isn&apos;t included&#x2014;so don&apos;t toss out your <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171024122112/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/31/tampon_flask.php">tampon flasks</a> just yet.<br>
