<p>Blizzards are descending upon Manhattan and they&apos;re going to be filled with delicious chocolate candy. Making good on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140206183558/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/22/what_hath_7-eleven_wrought_dq_now_s.php">their promise</a> to give Manhattanites as many Peanut Butter Bash&apos;s as they could handle, Dairy Queen has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140206183558/http://nypost.com/2013/12/04/nikes-got-its-eye-on-ritzy-new-fifth-avenue-digs/">announced the location</a> of their first Manhattan outpost. Get ready to get (soft) served, Union Square.</p>

<p>The chain signed a lease at 54 West 14th Street between Fifth and Sixth Avenues, the 2,500 square feet formerly occupied by one of the discount clothiers that operate on what has long been one of the dreariest blocks in all of downtown Manhattan. They&apos;re paying $165 per square foot to bring $5 Buck Lunch combos to the borough and saving Manhattanites the indignity of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140206183558/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/11/dairy_queen_will_land_in_nyc_by_mem.php">traveling to Staten Island</a> to slurp down Royal Shakes and Arctic Rush&apos;s. The chain is slated to open this spring, safely outside the term limits of Nanny Bloomberg. </p>
