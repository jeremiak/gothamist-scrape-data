<p>After nearly 30 years off the market, Pennsylvania&apos;s beloved <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130929033404/http://www.yuenglingsicecream.com/">Yuengling&apos;s Ice Cream</a> returns to the freezer section in March of next year. The ice cream company shut down in 1985 but demand from the public convinced owner David Yuengling to give the family business another shot. &quot;Over the years, people have always asked to bring it back and they say how much they loved it,&quot; Yuengling <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130929033404/http://citizensvoice.com/news/yuengling-ice-cream-back-after-30-years-1.1557569">told Citizens Voice</a>. &quot;The few people that we have told so far, everyone said it&apos;s a great idea and wish we had done it long ago.&quot;</p>

<p>Even though it bears the same name, the creamery isn&apos;t affiliated with the nation&apos;s oldest operating brewing company, but Ice Cream owner David Yuengling happens to be second cousin to brewery owner Richard Yuengling. The two operations were joined at one time, however, as Frank D. Yuengling, the original owner of the brewery, started the ice cream company to offset loses during Prohibition.</p>

<p>Though the ice cream is, sadly, BYOB, the company has made a Black &amp; Tan flavor as a nod to their brewing brothers. They&apos;re swapping out the brews for a mix of Belgian chocolate and salty caramel ice creams. They&apos;ll be churning up all the classic ice cream flavors and also whipping up pints of Chocolate Marshmallow, Root Beer and Vanilla Fudge Chunk with chocolate-covered pretzels.  </p>

<p>Now if they&apos;d just bring back their dope vintage ice cream truck...</p>
