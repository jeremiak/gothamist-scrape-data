<p>This Sunday, Williamsburg&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170308042217/http://www.delaneybbq.com/">BrisketTown</a>, one of the city&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170308042217/http://gothamist.com/2015/05/28/best_bbq_nyc.php">finest BBQ restaurants</a>, will <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170308042217/http://gothamist.com/2017/03/02/briskettown_williamsburg_rip.php">close</a>. The building that has housed the restaurant since 2012 has been sold to developers, who have plans to tear it down&#x2014;along with adjacent buildings. It&apos;s unclear what exactly will rise in its place, but the condo construction boom continues to scorch Williamsburg&apos;s Southside.  </p>

<p>This afternoon, we spoke with BrisketTown&apos;s owner Dan Delaney, who transformed a popular pop-up into a fully-fledged restaurant, which in turn helped propel him to other projects like his catering business and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170308042217/http://gothamist.com/2015/09/23/delaney_chicken_urbanspace_vanderbi.php">Delaney Chicken operation</a> in a food hall near Grand Central. </p>

<p>&quot;There are a lot of lenses that you can look at every situation from,&quot; Delaney says. &quot;I&apos;m mostly sad because this was the first thing I ever did in the food space, and it&apos;s mostly feelings of nostalgia that are the saddest.&quot;</p>

<p>Delaney says he&apos;s been looking for a new home for BrisketTown for the past year and a half, as the current lease at 359 Bedford Avenue was set to expire later this year. In fact, he&apos;d only ever imagined the Williamsburg space as something temporary, a pop-up restaurant that would eventually find a more permanent home. Potential spaces <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170308042217/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/08/nycs_best_barbecue_brisket_maker_is.php">in the East Village</a> and elsewhere in Brooklyn didn&apos;t pan out; then, the building on Bedford was sold. </p>

<p>&quot;In my fantasy world, what would have happened is that we would have had the other space already locked in and would have been building it or built it,&quot; he explains. &quot;This closes and then the new things open. But that timing didn&apos;t work out as we had hoped.&quot;</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="042616btown.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170308042217im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_nellcasey/042616btown.jpeg" width="640" height="427"> <br> <i> Briskettown (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170308042217/http://www.paulcrispin.com/">Paul Quitoriano</a>/Gothamist)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>Regardless, Delaney&apos;s confident about a future for BrisketTown or some other barbecue concept even if that&apos;s not in the immediate future. And he stresses that the Delaney BBQ business isn&apos;t shutting down. The company&apos;s successful catering arm, which he says has been more profitable than the restaurant so far, will continue to operate and keep the brand going&#x2014;along with pop-ups&#x2014; until such time as they open another restaurant.</p>

<p>In the interim, he&apos;s focusing on the Delaney Chicken concept, including a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170308042217/http://www.delaneychicken.com/paramus">forthcoming location in Paramus, NJ</a> that&apos;s opening soon. &quot;I want to learn a lot and I believe I will learn a lot more by opening up something in an area that&apos;s more reflective of the United States at large than Manhattan, so that&apos;s why I chose to open the next location in New Jersey.&quot; Delaney&apos;s also originally from the Garden State.</p>

<p>And he&apos;s got a few other dreams he&apos;d like to see coming down the pike for the Delaney brand&apos;s future, notably something that taps into his burger obsession. </p>

<p>&quot;I would love to open a burger place,&quot; Delaney muses. &quot;I have a 10-foot-long, huge neon sign in my kitchen that came off the side of a Johnny Rockets, which says &apos;hamburgers&apos; and which illuminates all the time. On my wall I have wrappers from burger places that I&apos;ve collected and framed. I have a giant, neon sign of McDonald&apos;s above my headboard that&apos;s six feet wide and five feet tall and it illuminates.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I have a real interest in American food forms, it&apos;s always been that. Barbecue is that, fried chicken is that, and burgers is that and maybe pizza will be that one way. I love these classic, American, not pretentious, Every Man Joe-kind of food forms,&quot; Delanye conclues. &quot;I romanticize them, I love going to the diners and the doughnuts shops or whatever. I&apos;d take that over Per Se any day.&quot; </p>
