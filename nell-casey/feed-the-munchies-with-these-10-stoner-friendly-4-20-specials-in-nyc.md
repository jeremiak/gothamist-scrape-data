---

	
										<p>Happy Holidaze, everyone. If you&apos;re celebrating today&apos;s holiday, you might <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170420215933/http://gizmodo.com/why-smoking-pot-makes-you-so-hungry-1520054768?utm_campaign=socialflow_gizmodo_twitter&amp;utm_source=gizmodo_twitter&amp;utm_medium=socialflow">be feeling a bit peckish</a>. For that, we&apos;ve rounded up some stoner-approved specials happening today, along with some of our own suggestions for what to munch out on.</p>

<p>For further inspiration, there&apos;s also our <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170420215933/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/20/best_munchies_foods_nyc.php">list from last year</a>. </p>

They&apos;re calling it a taco wrapped in a burrito but it&apos;s just two waffle cones in taco shape filled with ice cream and drizzles and toppings and #sugar. Snag them at any of NYC&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170420215933/https://secure.benjerry.com/ice-cream-near-me">Scoop Shops</a>.</p>

But brave eaters will delight in this delicious $3.95 dish, made with sichuan peppercorns that fill your mouth with a wonderfully vicious numbing heat. Slippery, oil-covered noodles sit under a bed of ground pork, chives and the aforementioned peppercorns.

<p>Yes, it&apos;s a &quot;restaurant&quot; funded by a brand, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170420215933/http://kelloggsnyc.com/">Kellogg&apos;s NYC</a> in Midtown comes through with the <strong>cereal fix</strong>&#x2014;plus a million sweet additions that amp up a regular box from the supermarket. There&apos;s the Birthday Cake, made with a base of Frosted Flakes to which are added yellow cake, vanilla syrup and rainbow sprinkles. Or consider the Life in Color, with Froot Loops, lime zest, marshmallows and a passion fruit jam. You can also create your own cereal concoction, but that might be difficult...in your current state.</p>
