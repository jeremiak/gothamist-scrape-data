										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="011316ansel.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021063655im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_nellcasey/011316ansel.jpg" width="640" height="497"> <br> <i> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021063655/https://www.facebook.com/Dominique.Ansel.Kitchen/photos/a.403892249778351.1073741828.402685956565647/552656518235256/?type=3&amp;theater">Dominique Ansel Kitchen</a>)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>First there was the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021063655/http://gothamist.com/2015/05/21/brutal_bec_takedown_boom.php">$8.50 egg sandwich</a>, which was soon eclipsed by the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021063655/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/13/black_seed_de_robertis.php#photo-1">$11.50 egg sandwich</a> and now, friends, let&apos;s turn our attention to the photo above, which depicts a $20 egg sandwich meal that one can procure this weekend. Snaps to the first person who Instagrams it alongside the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021063655/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/05/gold_donut_williamsburg.php">gold donut</a>!</p>

<p>Meet the wd~Ansel Egg Melt, a collaboration between Cronut creator Dominique Ansel and Wylie Dufresne, both of whom have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021063655/http://gothamist.com/2015/04/29/dominique_ansel_kitchen.php">significant experience</a> making <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021063655/http://gothamist.com/2014/12/10/wylie_dufresne_burger.php">buzz-worthy foodstuffs</a> that drive the fooderati world insane. The duo had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021063655/https://www.instagram.com/p/BAfFV3UlOP9/?taken-by=dominiqueansel">teased a collaboration</a> earlier this week and today unveiled this egg-and-cheese offering that&apos;s perfect for people who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021063655/http://gothamist.com/2015/11/13/cronut_still_a_thing.php">love to wait on line</a>. </p>

<p>So what will your Andrew Jackson buy you? Ansel describes the meal thusly: &quot;soft scrambled eggs with a confit egg yolk, homemade cheese (a la Wylie), black truffle, bacon, and maple flakes, served on a smoked English muffin, with extra crisp #Truffled #HashBrowns on the side.&quot; Dufresne, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021063655/http://nymag.com/restaurants/features/30007/">noted egg lover</a>, tackled the eggs and Ansel baked up the smoked English muffins. </p>

<p>Naturally, the sandwich will only be available for this long weekend, beginning Saturday at 9 a.m. at Dominique Ansel Kitchen (a.k.a. the non-Cronut location). So it you need a #Taste of those #Truffled #Taters, best to cancel any plans you had for the duration of the weekend. </p>
