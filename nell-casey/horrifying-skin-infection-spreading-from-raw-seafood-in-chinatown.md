<p>An outbreak of a rare skin infection has been detected amongst live and raw seafood handlers in the city&apos;s Chinatowns in Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens&#x2014;as you can see, the results are pretty gross. The Health Department released a statement this morning about the bacteria, called Mycobacterium marinum (M. marinum), which has been turning up on the hands of people handling the products. </p>

<p>The bacteria enters through cuts on the hands and causes &quot;red, tender swelling under the skin of the hands and arms, hand or arm pain, and difficulty moving fingers.&quot; If left untreated, surgical treatment could be required. The DOH encourages anyone who handles the raw seafood to wear gloves, especially they have any kind of cut or abrasion. </p>

<p>There&apos;s apparently &quot;no risk&quot; for anyone who chooses to eat the food from these markets. Cooking methods may kill the bacteria, but what about raw preparations like sushi; are diners still safe? We reached out to the DOH for this <em>very important clarification</em> and have been assured there&apos;s &quot;no risk associated with eating the fish or seafood.&quot; Yay?</p>
