<p>This month chef Lauren Hirschberg of CraftBar brings his spin on classic pub grub on Tuesday, November 12th. Though he&apos;s cooking up fancy fare at the Colicchio-run restaurant, the Montclair, NJ-born chef spent some free time at the Memphis at the BBQ World Championships last year, where his team took home first place in the Hot Wings competition. The man knows his low-brow goodies, folks. </p>

<p>On the menu this month: Buffalo Pig Tails; Kielbasa hero with sauerkraut, stewed onions and beer mustard; assorted pickles; and Nacho &quot;Cheese-charrones.&quot; Though it&apos;s a meat heavy establishment, veg-heads can opt for the hifalutin Bar Pie with flatbread, Fontina, Maitake and confit leek. Grab <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151017072739/http://www.eventbrite.com/e/bar-food-blowout-with-craftbar-executive-chef-lauren-hirschberg-tickets-8702434215">$20 tickets</a>, which include a big &apos;ole plate of food plus a &quot;Slippery Slope&quot;: a can of Brooklyn Brewery beer and a shot of Powers Whiskey. Duo <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151017072739/https://www.facebook.com/XNYofficial">XNY</a> will also be on hand performing their original tunes.</p>
