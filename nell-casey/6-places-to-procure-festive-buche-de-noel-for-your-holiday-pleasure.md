<p>Pastry fiends know that with the arrival of Christmas so comes the arrival of Buche de Noel season, where all the French-inspired bakeries create luscious whipped cakes filled with flavored creams. While the first iterations of this holiday treat were assembled to mimic the Yule Log, a tree branch traditionally burned for good luck, today&apos;s interpretations often take a more whimsical design approach, artfully topping the cakes with macaron shells or elegant chocolate pieces. Our city boasts many wonderful bakeries offering festive Buche&apos;s this year; here&apos;s where to find them.</p>

<p><strong>Francois Payard</strong> His name is synonymous with exquisite pastries and confections and sweets lovers flock to his bakeries each year to pick up one of his famous Buche de Noel before they sell out. Payard offers four different flavors this year, including a Chestnut Pear Log, Chocolate Mandarin, Louvre Log (chocolate and hazelnut) and a Caramel Chocolate Log. Depending on how large a cake you want, prices range from $26 (feeds four) to $60 (feeds 10); pre-ordering begins tomorrow by calling <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150702072613/http://www.payard.com/LOCATIONS_ep_42.html">any of the locations</a> or ordering online. The cakes will be available for pick up or delivery on December 23rd or 24th. <em>Francois Payard has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150702072613/http://www.payard.com/LOCATIONS_ep_42.html">five locations</a>; check <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150702072613/http://www.payard.com/">payard.com</a> for more information</em></p>
