<p>What began in 1884 inside a red brick building at Third Avenue and 55th Street has transformed into a global brand synonymous with hospitality, a proper pint and a damn fine hamburger. Earlier this year, the Clarke&apos;s name took new form with the opening of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429160331/http://clarkes-standard.com/index.html">Clarke&apos;s Standard</a>, the first of what has become a mini-chain of burger joints throughout Manhattan. Capitalizing on the success of their classic hamburger, Clarke&apos;s Standard offers burgers, dogs and sandwiches in a setting reminiscent of the classic butcher shop.</p>

<p>Their newest outpost arrived in Union Square last week, serving house-ground hamburgers like The Cadillac ($8.50) with cheddar cheese, smoked bacon, tomato, red leaf lettuce and their Standard Sauce. There&apos;s also a the Brooklyn Au Poivre ($7.75)&#x2014;because <em>Brooklyn</em>&#x2014;with cracked pepper sauce, Farmer&apos;s Gouda, Jimmy peppers and savory onions. They also rock hot dogs like a Chili Cheese Dog ($7.25) and Banh Mi Dog ($6.75) that riffs on the classic Vietnamese sandwich.</p>

<p>With new burger joints continuing to pop up daily&#x2014;from the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429160331/http://gothamist.com/tags/ramenburger">gimmicky</a> to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429160331/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/14/shake_shack_coming_to_dumbo_next_ye.php">established</a>&#x2014;we tip our hat to any company willing to wade into the beefy waters. </p>
