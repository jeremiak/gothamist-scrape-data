                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="2013_07_fdny2014.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130823084321im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_nellcasey/2013_07_fdny2014.jpg" width="640" height="465"> <br> <i> <span class="photo_caption">It&apos;s going to be like this only with more meat</span></i></div> <p></p>

<p>Some of New York&apos;s Bravest are taking a break from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130823084321/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/23/photos_fdny_brings_calendar_hunks_t.php#photo-1">stripping down for charity</a> and saving lives to participate in the Fairway Firefighters Food Face-Off, a grilling throwdown at the grocery store&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130823084321/http://www.fairwaymarket.com/store-red-hook/">Red Hook outpost</a>. Next Wednesday, four FDNY teams from Brooklyn&#x2014;two from Red Hook and two from Brooklyn Heights&#x2014;bring their cooking chops before a panel of esteemed judges, including <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130823084321/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/26/fairway_red_hook_opening_friday_for.php">Fairway enthusiast</a> and Brooklyn Borough President Marty Markowitz, Fairway cheesemonger Steve Jenkins, and a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130823084321/http://instagram.com/p/cFCS9WEoPe/">certain blogger/FDNY fangirl</a>.</p>

<p>Each group must grill up ribs, burgers and either a chicken dish or vegetable skewers using food donated by Fairway. They have freedom to create whatever kind of flavor profile for the dishes but a &quot;secret ingredient&quot; will be revealed before the contest begins which competitors must include in their burger. The winning firehouse receives a $500 gift card to Fairway and maybe if Marty&apos;s feeling generous he&apos;ll <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130823084321/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/12/photos_marty_markowitz_throws_150k.php#photo-1">throw them a sweet ass party</a>. The winning team also gets to select a charity to receive funds from Fairway&apos;s &quot;Shopping Night&quot; sales. </p>

<p>All the hot, hot grilling action goes down by the waterfront at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130823084321/http://www.fairwaymarket.com/store-red-hook/">Red Hook Fairway Market</a> beginning at noon next Wednesday, July 31st. The event is free to attend and everyone gets to sample the FDNY fare plus food from Fairway vendors. Also on hand, some live music from The American Bombshells, an Andrews Sisters-style gal group, and face-painting for the kiddies. </p>
