<p>Just when you thought they <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504133644/http://gothamist.com/2013/12/11/best_nyc_bakeries_dessert.php">couldn&apos;t get any better</a>, Baked will bring wine and brownies together at last, just as the universe ordained. Community Board 1 unanimously approved a beer and wine license for the Red Hook bakery, which will open a new Manhattan outpost in Tribeca. The new cafe is slated to open sometime in spring of next year at 279 Church with 50 seats but only 6 tables. </p>

<p>Tribeca Citizen has a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504133644/http://tribecacitizen.com/2013/12/12/cb1-tribeca-committee-the-unofficial-minutes-december/">copy of the menu</a>, which includes tons of cakes, brownies and pies. Committee members were apparently very enthusiastic about the new venture, especially since the bakery will cease alcohol sales after 11 p.m., after which customers will just get baked. Here all week, folks!</p>
