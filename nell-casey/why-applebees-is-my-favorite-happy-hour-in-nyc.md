<p>Moving away from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170629202448/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/12/a_food_drink_tour_of_spanish_harlem.php#photo-1">Spanish Harlem</a>&#x2014;my home for seven years, the longest amount of time spent in one apartment in NYC&#x2014;was difficult for a lot of reasons. It was home to one of my <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170629202448/http://gothamist.com/2014/07/18/cascalote_latin_bistro.php">favorite restaurants</a>, it sheltered a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170629202448/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/12/a_food_drink_tour_of_spanish_harlem.php#photo-14">super dive bar</a> responsible for many stumbles home down 2nd Avenue, and it had an Applebee&apos;s, one of the most unexpected places to get a generous buzz and a full belly for $20&#x2014;if that. </p>

<p>One year, I even <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170629202448/https://twitter.com/nellcasey/status/419234530549985280">spent New Year&apos;s Eve at Applebee&apos;s</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170629202448/https://www.instagram.com/p/im2yN2EoDN/">drinking head-sized Long Island Iced Teas</a> and loving every minute of it&#x2014;but not so much the ensuing hangover and stomach ache the next day.</p>

<p>Where I grew up in Connecticut, chain restaurants existed but weren&apos;t part of the regular dinner routine in my family. Sure, there was the occasional trip to Bertucci&apos;s&#x2014;where they&apos;d give kids raw dough to fling around&#x2014;or even a stop by California Pizza Kitchen when we were at the mall. But by and large, I wasn&apos;t exposed to the joy of sticky franchise chicken wings and overly salted industrial french fries until I lived in Spanish Harlem and the city&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170629202448/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/10/why_is_ray_kelly_cutting_this_ribbo.php">super eco-friendly Applebee&apos;s</a> opened in the newish shopping development on 1st Avenue. It was there that chalices of sugary cocktails, foot-tall glasses of ice cold Bud Light and gloppy, oddly-flavorless spinach-artichoke dip became something of a revelation in my life.</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="011816app2.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170629202448im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_nellcasey/011816app2.jpg" width="640" height="480"> <br> <i> (via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170629202448/https://www.facebook.com/applebeestimesquare/photos/pb.182747058464417.-2207520000.1453146350./678271985578586/?type=3&amp;theater">Facebook</a>)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>And with good reason. During Happy Hour at the bar, by far the best (and only, really&#x2014;I am not endorsing a dinner here) time to visit, drinks and appetizers are half off and domestic draft beers are $3. Droopy chicken quesadillas, oddly dense mozzarella sticks and the restaurant&apos;s signature pretzel&#x2014;butter-slicked and accompanied by beige beer cheese and bland mustard sauces&#x2014;are finally worth their price, averaging around $5 over their typical double-digit (and therefore ludicrously expensive) price tags. Show me a regular bar that&apos;s serving the same portions for the same prices and...I&apos;ll probably be really excited&#x2014;so do share! </p>

<p>So yes, the food kinda sucks, but you&apos;re getting an America-sized portion of it. Sometimes quantity trumps quality&#x2014;especially if it&apos;s on the cheap.</p>

<p>Maybe my shitty taste in happy hours comes from a perceived childhood trauma. For someone whose parents wouldn&apos;t even let her eat the organic, hippy fruit leather at the local health food store&#x2014;let alone the Fruit By The Foot enjoyed by my classmates&#x2014;the options at Applebee&apos;s were somewhat revelatory. How are the mad scientist chefs able to imbue the gift of 1,060 calories to one order of pretzels? The mystery might never be solved and after a few rounds of drinks, I don&apos;t even care.</p>

<p>Inexpensive comfort food is one thing, but it&apos;s the cheap drinks that seal the deal. Aside from the $3 beers&#x2014;20-ounce glasses wonderfully named &quot;Brewtus&quot; (I was somebody&apos;s dad in a past life)&#x2014;their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170629202448/http://drinks.seriouseats.com/2011/04/cheap-buzz-applebees-infamous-margaritas-how-are-the-drinks-at-applebees-review.html">potent margaritas</a>, Bahama Mama&apos;s and Long Island Iced Tea goblets are all half off, as are wine and well drinks. But if you&apos;re not guzzling <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170629202448/http://www.drinksmixer.com/drink590.html">all the liquors simultaneously</a>, you aren&apos;t really doing it right.</p>

<p>Applebee&apos;s won&apos;t be achieving Michelin-status (ever) and yes, I appreciate that there are more &quot;quality&quot; options to be found both in Spanish Harlem and beyond. But it deserves a tip of the hat for feeding and beer&apos;ing locals on prices many people can afford and giving them ample opportunity to actually experience said deals. Happy Hour at my once-local Harlem location runs from 4 p.m. to 11 p.m. daily (yes, <em>daily</em>) and that&apos;s true of many NYC Applebee&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170629202448/http://www.applebeesny.com/contact/our_locations">locations</a>, making it one of the more generous offerings in the city. Their commitment to getting customers drunk is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170629202448/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/12/applebees_to_reiterate_the_differen.php">truly unparalleled</a>. </p>
