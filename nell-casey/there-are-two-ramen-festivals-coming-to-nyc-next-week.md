<p>Few things are more comforting than a favorite sweater and a steaming bowl of hot noodles on a chilly day, which are the kind of days we&apos;ll be experiencing for the next six or so months. To that end, next week the city is hosting two slurping opportunities for stuffing our bellies with ramen.</p>

<p>On Sunday and Monday, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170216025106/http://www.japanfes.com/ehome.html">Japan Fes</a> events series offers two outlets for ramenthusiasts, beginning with a <strong>Fall Fes &amp; Ramen Competition</strong> on Sunday on the Upper West Side. From 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., stop by to sample ramen from New York, NJ, PA and Japan, concluding in a vote by festival attendees for the best bowl of the day. Particularly of note are the two entries from Japan; 175 Deno from the Hokkaido Prefecture offering their signature tantanmen and Menya Jiro from Kagoshima Prefecture with a tonkotsu ramen. </p>

<p>On Monday, it&apos;s an all-day affair at the <strong>Japan Fes Midtown Bazaar</strong>, where all the competitors from Sunday&apos;s event will be selling bowls of their ramen for just $5 each. Stop by 4 West 43rd Street anytime between 11 a.m. and 9 p.m. for the ramen, sake, beer, dessert and cultural performances and presentations from Japan. </p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="101316ichicoro.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170216025106im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_nellcasey/101316ichicoro.jpg" width="640" height="480"> <br> <i> Ichicoroya Ramen (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170216025106/https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ichicoro-ramen-tampa-2?select=8xyjNAKUcKLA1fEv0ISOtg">Yelp</a>)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>On Thursday, it&apos;s the return of the <strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170216025106/http://luckyrice.com/event/new-york-slurpfest/">LUCKYRICE Ramen Slurpfest</a></strong>, which is kind of a ramen-eating contest of sorts, where guests have 13 minutes to finish each of the four bowls on offer, each paired with a Bombay Sapphire cocktail. This year&apos;s participants include Tampa&apos;s Ichicoroya Ramen, making Latin-inspired ramen; Shoki Ramen House from Sacramento, California; Menya Mushashi, with locations in Japan and Hawaii; and Ramen Tatus-Ya, doing Texas-style ramen that employs brisket.</p>

<p>There are still tickets available (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170216025106/http://luckyrice.com/event/new-york-slurpfest/">$100</a>) but you&apos;ll need to use an American Express card to do the purchasing. </p>
