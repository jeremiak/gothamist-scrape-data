<p>Are you a person of means who desires to dine at the city&apos;s trendiest restaurants but don&apos;t deign to wait months for a reservation to open up? If you possess a disposable income and no patience at all, why not enroll in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429062702/http://www.todaysepicure.com/">Today&apos;s Epicure</a>, a website that pre-books tables at popular restaurants then offers them up to clients. </p>

<p>$1,000 per year buys you the privilege of booking impossible reservations&#x2014;think <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429062702/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/19/inside_lafayette.php#photo-1">Lafayette</a>, Carbone, etc.&#x2014;at the drop of a hat without having to negotiate with the peons who man the phones. &#x201C;Restaurants are hotspots in New York for three to six months, and then they can die,&quot; explained former St. Regis concierge and website founder Pascal Riffaud in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429062702/http://www.foodrepublic.com/2013/07/30/man-gaming-new-york-city-restaurant-reservation-sc">an interview with Food Republic</a>. &quot;New Yorkers want to be there during this time. They want to be seen there during this time.&#x201D; </p>

<p>The website makes reservations under a pseudonym, which you then use to claim your table when you arrive&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429062702/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HNd3qz68Zw">sounds familiar</a>. To be clear, the membership fee does not include the cost of your meal, so you&apos;re paying a grand per year so a website can <em>make a reservation for you</em>. On top of that, the website charges an extra $45 and $95 for &quot;exceptionally popular venues on short notice and/or for larger party sizes.&quot; Throw all the cash around that you want, rich people, it still won&apos;t <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429062702/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/23/breaking_new_yorkers_wait_hours_to.php">get you everything</a> (is the lie we keep telling ourselves so we can fall asleep on our slightly-damaged air mattresses). </p>
