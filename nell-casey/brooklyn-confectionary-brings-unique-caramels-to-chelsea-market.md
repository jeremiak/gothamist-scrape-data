</div></div>					<p>Hot off their successful inclusion in Ben &amp; Jerry&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502150104/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/26/the_ben_and_jerrys_new_york_city_ic.php">New York-centric ice cream flavor</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502150104/http://www.liddabitsweets.com/">Liddabit Sweets</a> is opening their first brick-and-mortar retail shop for all your sugary needs. The Brooklyn-based company has been peddling their handcrafted candy online and in specialty shops around town since 2009 and now they&apos;re bringing their caramels, candy bars and other delicious confections to a small space inside Chelsea Market.</p>

<p>The shop produces a variety of delectable caramels, in flavors like Apple Cider, Beer &amp; Pretzel and Fig-Ricotta. They also make a kind of candy called Honeycomb&#x2014;light and crispy golden honey smothered in chocolate or baked up naked&#x2014;as well as a Bourbon-Coffee-Bacon Caramel Corn. For a more substantial treat, check out their candy bars like The Dorie with dark cocoa cookie, soft salted caramel ganache and sauteed dried apricots flecked with black pepper; or the The S&apos;More, which tops a homemade graham cracker with smokey ganache and fresh marshmallow.</p>

<p>The shop opens on September 1st, joining other recent additions like Cull &amp; Pistol, Hybird, Num Pang and a barber shop called Decatur &amp; Sons.</p>
