<p>A group of hot dog-selling Vietnam veterans who have been battling the Parks department for years over turf outside the Metropolitan Museum of Art got some much-welcome news yesterday. The Daily News reports that a Supreme Court justice ruled the disabled vets can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144753/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/hot-dog-king-beats-mayor-article-1.1295609?localLinksEnabled=false">continue to sell their dogs</a> in the coveted spot free from reprisal from the Parks Department, which has been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144753/http://gothamist.com/2009/11/25/disabled_vietnam_vet_hot_dog_vendor.php">issuing steep fines to the vendors since 2007</a>. </p>

<p>The city has been miffed because the veteran vendors don&apos;t pay the city to operate out of the space, which typically gets rented for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144753/http://gothamist.com/2009/01/07/hot_dog_vendor_outside_met_pays_thr.php">hundreds of thousand of dollars</a> by city-approved vendors. The veterans cite a 19th-century state law that allows disabled veterans to vend on the street. But Park rangers argued that a 1998 state law, which gives the city authorization to tell veterans where they can sell &quot;goods,&quot; also applied to food. But Justice Joan Lobis disagreed and said the department was no longer allowed to issue the men tickets. </p>

<p>It&apos;s a significant victory for the vet vendors&#x2014;though probably not so great for the city-approved vendors who pay to park their carts&#x2014;especially now that the Museum will be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144753/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/21/metropolitan_museum_will_be_open_7.php">open seven days a week</a>. Veteran turned hot dog hawker Dan Rossi, who has collected fines upward of $300,000 and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144753/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/02/city_cracking_down_on_vet_vendors_a.php">even arrested outside the Museum</a>, was jubilant following the hearing. &quot;I&apos;m going to go get drunk,&quot; he told the News. </p>
