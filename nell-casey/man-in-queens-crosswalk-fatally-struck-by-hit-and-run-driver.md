<p>A 52-year-old man was fatally struck by the driver of a car in the early hours of the morning in Queens. Police say the man was crossing South Conduit Avenue at Rockaway Boulevard in Springfield Gardens around 2:30 a.m. when he was hit by a driver traveling east. The impact allegedly &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170519173505/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/queens/man-fatally-struck-queens-hit-and-run-article-1.2930666">sent the victim flying at least 20 feet</a>.&quot;</p>

<p>The driver then fled the scene.</p>

<p>&quot;I heard like a Mustang or something like that. They were racing,&quot; a hotel worker at the Fairfield Inn across the street <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170519173505/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/queens/man-fatally-struck-queens-hit-and-run-article-1.2930666">described to the Daily News</a>. &quot;I could see they were fishtailing. When he was going past the gas station, the back was like gliding.&quot; </p>

<p>When EMS arrived, they found the victim unconscious and unresponsive, pronouncing him DOA at the scene. The NYPD&apos;s Collision Investigation Squad, which is investigated, says no arrests have been made, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170519173505/http://abc7ny.com/news/man-crossing-street-in-queens-fatally-struck-by-hit-and-run-driver/1681419/">ABC reports</a> they&apos;re looking for a late model red Ford in connection with the incident. </p>

<p>The NYPD is withholding the identity of the victim until the family has been notified. </p>
