<p>Breakfast is often spent hunched over a computer at our desks, but Saturday and Sunday, the meal&apos;s front and center at <strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016014907/https://www.eventbrite.com/e/the-breakfestival-tickets-26514891755">The BreakFestival</a></strong>, for all-day celebrating and feasting on the most important meal of the day. At each of the four sessions at Stuyvesant Cove Park, expect 10 chefs and breakfast purveyors offering up their takes on things like biscuits, French toast, bagels, bialys, breakfast meats and so on. Also on hand: coffee, craft beer, cider and breakfast cocktails. Each session ($45) is all-inclusive; check out the full lineup and get tickets <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016014907/https://www.eventbrite.com/e/the-breakfestival-tickets-26514891755">here</a>.</p>

<p>We&apos;re of the mind that lobster should be a year-round indulgence, but close out the &quot;season&quot; with a three-day <strong>Lobsterpalooze</strong> at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016014907/http://www.themermaidnyc.com/">The Mermaid Inn</a>. All three locations will be offering a $28 feast of a whole steamed lobster, corn, and roasted potatoes. The special runs Saturday, Sunday and Monday or until the lobster pot runs dry.</p>

<p>Even if you&apos;ve got plans for Monday you should still seize the opportunity to party hard on a Sunday and get to Salvation Taco at Pod 39 Hotel, where <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016014907/http://salvationtaco.com/new-events/2016/9/4/labor-day-summer-salvation-rooftop-party"><strong>a rooftop party</strong></a> will feature special cocktails, delicious small plates, and a thumping soundtrack provided by DJ Prestige between 2 and 6 p.m.. It&apos;s unclear if they&apos;ll also have the family-style whole pig&apos;s head that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016014907/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/12/salvation_taco.php#photo-1">we sampled back during Salvation Taco&apos;s early days</a>, but it doesn&apos;t hurt to ask. <em>(Scott Heins)</em></p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="090216social.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016014907im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_nellcasey/090216social.jpg" width="640" height="419"> <br> <i> (Mike Stone)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>Newly minted rooftop bar <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016014907/http://www.socialdrinkandfood.com/">Social Drink &amp; Food</a> is bringing more than just <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016014907/http://gothamist.com/2016/05/04/social_drink_and_food_rooftop_resta.php">rainbows</a> to your life on Labor Day Monday. Head over for brunch between 11 a.m. and 4 p.m. and they&apos;ll throw in a free watermelon bellini with the purchase of any entree. There are burgers and crepes on the menu, but opt for the Complete Malawich Sandwich (pictured above) with a 12-hour egg, tomato, hummus, tahini, lemon aioli and fresh herbs inside fried Yemenite bread. The whole meal&apos;ll set you back $18.</p>
