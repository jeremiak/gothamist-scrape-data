<p>Passover begins today, meaning legions of the faithful are busy prepping for tonight&apos;s Passover Seder. Even if you&apos;re not Jewish, you can still take part&#x2014;perhaps a Jewish friend or significant other has invited you to take part in their family seder tonight. But what if you&apos;re never attended a seder before? How will you know what to do and when? First, read this <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428152512/http://judaism.about.com/od/holidays/a/What-Is-A-Passover-Seder.htm">description of the ritual</a> for a general idea of how the night will unfold. Then, follow these five pieces of advice for first-timers, culled from our Twitter followers and members of the tribe on staff at Gothamist: </p>

<p><strong>Look nice and bring a gift</strong>: Whenever you&apos;re invited to a family&apos;s home for a holiday meal you should look nice, so ditch the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428152512/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/09/it_happened_to_me_i_wore_meggings_a.php">meggings</a> and wear something befitting the occasion. Bringing a gift for the host is always a way to start off on the right food, so opt for a nice bouquet of flowers or bottle of wine. Just make sure the vino is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428152512/http://www.foodandwine.com/articles/top-5-kosher-wines-for-passover">kosher for Passover</a>! </p>

<p><strong>Eat before you go</strong>: While this advice might sound counterintuitive since you&apos;ll be attending a meal, the Haggadah, or &quot;the telling,&quot; is long and you&apos;ll need something to stave off hunger until you get to eat. Some of our readers recommend carbo-loading at lunch to bulk up for the multiple glasses of wine that are customarily consumed throughout the evening.</p>

<p><strong>About that wine&#x2026;</strong>: Don&apos;t drink the wine until everyone else is drinking the wine. There are specific moments in during the ritual where wine is either sipped or used in some other way, so don&apos;t think of it as just a part of the table setting. Over the course of the ritual, each person will consume four glasses of wine (woo hoo!) so don&apos;t worry about not getting a buzz on. Also, make sure you&apos;re drinking lots of water so you don&apos;t pass face down in the matzah. </p>

<p><strong>Try to get the <em>afikomen</em></strong>: At the seder there will be a plate on the table containing three matzot covered by a cloth. This isn&apos;t the bread basket at the Olive Garden so don&apos;t start nibbling away when you sit down! During the <em>yachatz</em>, the leader of the seder will break one piece of matzah in two, leaving the smaller piece on the plate and hiding the larger piece (<em>afikomen</em>). Provided there aren&apos;t any young children at the seder, see if you can be the one to find the <em>afikomen</em>, and you may be rewarded!</p>

<p><strong>It&apos;s okay to ask questions</strong>: The bottom line is that you&apos;re not expected to be perfect. If you aren&apos;t sure how to proceed, either follow the people around you or just ask! Your host will likely be flattered that you&apos;re interested in understanding more about each facet of the seder.</p>
