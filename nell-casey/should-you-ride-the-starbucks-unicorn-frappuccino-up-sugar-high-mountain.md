<p>It&apos;s day one of Starbucks&apos; foray into Instagram trends, and did you think we&apos;d <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171008112028/http://gothamist.com/2017/04/18/spoiler_its_unicorn_jizz.php">let this meticulously edited PR shot</a> of the Unicorn Frappuccino stand for itself? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171008112028/http://gothamist.com/2014/03/27/taco_bell_waffle_taco.php#photo-1">Of course not</a>, which is how I found myself at one of the thousands of Midtown Starbucks this morning before I even had a chance to finish my cup of ugly non-unicorn coffee. </p>

<p>I&apos;ll admit the drink is quite pretty, and I drew multiple stares from the tourists crammed into the Starbucks on 7th and 55th Street. It&apos;s more purple than the magenta press photo, but an employee had dutifully zigzagged the &quot;sour blue drizzle,&quot; and the whipped cream was heavily, if unevenly, doused in multicolored dust, which I assume is made from dried up unicorn tears. Get all the photos taken within the first minute or two, though, because once the properties begin to decompose you&apos;re left with gloopy layers of cream and separated milk product with bright pinkish liquid pooled at the bottom.</p>

<p>I haven&apos;t had a Starbucks Frappuccino since crop tops and chokers were in style&#x2014;the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171008112028/https://www.buzzfeed.com/bibibarud/theyre-baaaack?utm_term=.kao33GKG3#.lwoYY9q9Y">first time</a>&#x2014;so I can&apos;t speak to the base sweetness level but, unsurprisingly, the Unicorn Frapp will test the productivity of your pancreas. Starbucks describes the flavor as &quot;sweet and fruity...[evolving] to tangy and tart.&quot; Maybe I didn&apos;t sip long enough to get to the tart part, because it&apos;s pretty uniformly sugar rush. Gothamist staffer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171008112028/https://twitter.com/DaveCoIon">Dave Colon</a> described the taste as &quot;melted Italian ice,&quot; perhaps picking up on the mango flavor that was indeed evident.</p>

<p>So should you order the Unicorn Frappuccino? Well, there&apos;s no coffee in it, so that&apos;s a point off. But if you&apos;re a regular drinker of Starbucks Frapps or Dunkin Donuts Coolattas (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171008112028/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-4347160/Dunkin-Donuts-ditching-Coffee-Coolatta.html">RIP</a>) sure, strap a saddle on that unicorn and ride, baby, ride! The rest of us should just do what everyone else will do: order it, make <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171008112028/https://www.instagram.com/p/BTEnbkzA-dk/?taken-by=nellcasey">an Instagram</a>, then sic the leftovers on your co-workers. </p>
