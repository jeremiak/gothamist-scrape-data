<p>Longtime neighborhood gem Emerald Inn has found a new home on the Upper West Side after several years of turmoil at their original location on Columbus Avenue. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509174201/http://www.westsiderag.com/2013/06/11/emerald-inn-opens-in-new-space-twice-as-big-with-more-beers-on-tap">West Side Rag reports</a> that the 71-year-old pub has opened its new doors on a bustling stretch of 72nd Street between Broadway and West End Avenue. The pub officially opened on Friday, serving up pints and pub grub in an expansive space that has housed the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509174201/http://gothamist.com/2012/08/01/ny_post_columnist_eviscerates_uws_b.php">0-star Purple Fig</a>, P.D. O&apos;Hurley&apos;s and several other restaurant spots in recent years.</p>

<p>Besides the new space, nothing much has changed about Emerald Inn, including owner Charles Champbell, a 3rd generation owner whose son Charlie runs the place as General Manager. Over the phone this afternoon, Charlie told us the bar would be open 9 a.m. to 4 a.m. daily, serving a full lunch and dinner menu plus a full brunch on Saturdays and Sundays. For those who cherished the Inn&apos;s food in the old days, the same cooks from the previous incarnation are griddling up the burgers in the new location.</p>

<p>Hopefully this will be the last stop for Emerald Inn, which struggled with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509174201/http://gothamist.com/2008/09/30/66yearold_upper_west_side_pub_to_cl.php">rent increases</a> that forced the pub to move despite rumors that they would <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509174201/http://gothamist.com/2009/01/06/emerald_inn_upper_west_side_dive_to.php">tough it out</a>. 72nd Street doesn&apos;t have the same charm as Columbus Avenue&#x2014;and the other nearby businesses lack the panache of the tonier avenue&#x2014;but hopefully regulars will walk the extra few blocks to patronize the new digs. And now that Emerald Inn&apos;s future is secure, let&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509174201/http://ny.eater.com/archives/2013/06/legendary_dive_bar_the_blarney_cove_to_shutter_soon.php">save Blarney Cove</a>!</p>
