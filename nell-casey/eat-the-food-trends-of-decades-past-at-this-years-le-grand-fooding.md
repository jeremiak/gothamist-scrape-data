On September 27th and 28th, the culinary time travel unfolds at Red Hook&apos;s Res, an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130828172842/http://eater.com/archives/2013/05/20/the-franks-unveil-res-a-new-chef-artist-residency-in-brooklyn.php">&quot;artist residency for chefs,&quot;</a> where four chefs present three dishes from food trends past, in a meal they&apos;re calling <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130828172842/http://www.lefooding.com/evenements/2013/le-grand-fooding/new-york/#.Uh3452T71jY">The Time Mach&apos;Inn</a>.</p>

<p>The first stop on the time tour begins with the Fusion Cuisine Years (1991-1999), where New Zealand chef Peter Gordon presents an appetizer of plantain, tamarind and coconut soup with goat cheese and a smoked salmon wonton. The Bistronomy Years (1998 &#x2212; 2007) come next, with French chef Yves Cmdeborde roasts a veal breast with potatoes and cockles. Finally, Res masterminds Frank Castronovo and Frank Falcinelli tackle the current Farm-To-Table era (2008-2013) with a dessert dish of tomatoes with honey. </p>

<p>In lieu of a traditional wine pairing, an era-appropriate Jameson cocktail accompanies each course, including an aughts cocktail from Booker and Dax&apos;s Tristan Willey. Organizers promise &quot;surprises,&quot; which could mean some live music <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130828172842/http://gothamist.com/2012/08/11/next_months_le_grand_fooding_festiv.php">as in previous years</a>.
