<p>You&apos;d think between the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130529004658/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/29/5_things_to_start_looking_for_at_yo.php#photo-1">abundant green markets</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130529004658/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/01/gowanus_whole_foods_will_have_20000.php">rooftop farms</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130529004658/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/14/paper_mags_pop-up_market_open_in_ch.php">cutesy locally-made food</a> that we&apos;d shoot right to the top of any list touting a state&apos;s commitment to locally-sourced product. But a study by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130529004658/http://www.strollingoftheheifers.com/locavore-index-2013/">Strolling of the Heifers</a>, a Vermont-based local food advocacy group, ranked our fair state the 25th most (least?) locavore state in the country (including the District of Columbia). At least we beat out New Jersey?</p>

<p>The group compiled data comparing the number of farmer&apos;s markets, consumer-supported agriculture operations (CSAs) and food hubs, made adjustments for state population, and gave out scores based on those criteria. Vermont&#x2014;because of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130529004658/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/03/vermont_farmer_building_sailboat_to.php">that sailboat</a>, obviously&#x2014;Maine, New Hampshire, North Dakota and Iowa took the top five spots with Texas, Florida, Louisiana, Arizona and Nevada bringing up the rear. </p>

<p>To be fair, we were judged on state level, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130529004658/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/17/video_massive_brawl_at_albany_st_pa.php">who knows</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130529004658/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/05/assemblyman_wore_wire_to_help_feds.php">what happens</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130529004658/http://gothamist.com/2012/11/16/upstate_da_admits_that_yeah_he_was.php">once you leave</a> New York City. But considering we have the lush Hudson Valley and the goddamn Atlantic Ocean at our doorstep, it&apos;s shocking that we couldn&apos;t at least beat out, say, Kentucky. (But heyyy Bluegrass State, we&apos;d <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130529004658/http://norml.org/legal/item/kentucky-top-10-cash-crops">definitely party with you</a>!)

<p>Still, take heart, budding urban foragers! Last year New York ranked an abysmal 42nd in the nation, so this trendy farm-to-table movement must count for something. Plus, California took over our former 42 ranking, which is pretty low considering <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130529004658/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/24/the_10_best_rooftop_bars_in_nyc.php#comment-874560593">how they source their food</a>.</p>
