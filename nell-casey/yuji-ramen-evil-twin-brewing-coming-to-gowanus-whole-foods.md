<p>Things are shaping up nicely at Gowanus&apos;s forthcoming Whole Foods, which looks to take the supermarket model and transform it into a hybrid market, food stand and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508154503/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/01/gowanus_whole_foods_will_have_20000.php">farm</a>. The latest addition to the already impressive lineup: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508154503/https://www.facebook.com/YujiRamen">Yuji Ramen</a>, which in addition to feeding the Smorgasburg set has operated a pop-up ramen bar inside the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508154503/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/10/smorgasburg_and_whole_foods_sitting.php">Bowery Whole Foods</a> since last fall. Yuji will operate a full-time take out stall at the new Third and 3rd location, serving up Yuji Haraguchi&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508154503/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/10/ramen_report_pop-up_yuji_brings_bro.php">brothless mazeman-style noodles</a>.</p>

<p>Haraguchi is known for his unique noodle pairings, including bacon and egg, smoked salmon and cheese and sweet pea and prosciutto. Look out for the Spicy Tuna Mazemen, a crowd favorite, and the Uni Miso when it&apos;s in season. Also of note: the popular Yuji pop-up at Bowery Whole Foods shall henceforth operate full time; most excellent news for noodle lovers.</p>

<p>In addition to their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508154503/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/15/the_gowanus_whole_foods_will_have_a.php">rooftop bar</a>, Whole Foods has also partnered with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508154503/http://eviltwin.dk/">Evil Twin Brewing</a> to create a special beer for the new market. Evil Twin&apos;s Jeppe Jarnit-Bjergs&#xF8;, who was born in Denmark but lives in Brooklyn, partnered with fellow Dane Fritz Knipschildt of Connecticut&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508154503/http://www.knipschildt.com/flash.html">Chocopologie</a> to create the Evil Twin Smoked Chocolate Chestnut Stout. Coming full circle, the brew will then be used to created beer-infused chocolate truffles. </p>
