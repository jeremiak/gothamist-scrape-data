</div></div>					<p>The works of surrealist painter Rene Magritte are the subject of a current exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art, where the Belgian artist&apos;s challenging and often disquieting pieces are on display through the end of January. To further immerse itself into the genre, the Museum is hosting<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502152011/http://www.moma.org/learn/courses/courses"> &quot;Edible Magritte,&quot;</a> a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502152011/http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303482504579178031893835904">dinner party series</a> that offers out-of-the-ordinary dishes inspired by some of the artist&apos;s most familiar works.<span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right"> <img alt="110513magritte3.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502152011im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_nellcasey/110513magritte3.jpg" width="150" height="218"> <br> <i style=" width:150px; ;display:block"> <span class="photo_caption">Le Portrait, 1935</span></i></div> <p></p>

<p>The playful eating experience is the brainchild of artist Elaine Tin Nyo, who wondered what would happen if Magritte used his aesthetic in the kitchen. She&apos;s partnered with MoMA Cafe 2 chef Lynn Bound to create a hands-on meal that transforms food into edible art.</p>

<p>Patrons ate the first surrealist meal last week, which included blue cocktails and pink cheese puffs, evoking &quot;Pink Bells, Tattered Skies&quot; and prosciutto with a large black olive that echoed the eerie dinner scene in &quot;The Portrait.&quot; Il Flottant, a classic French dessert, was reimagined to resemble puffy clouds floating across an azure sky. Diners also feasted on a large chocolate bird filled with raspberries and syrup, a nod to macabre &quot;The Pleasure,&quot; which depicts a young woman gnawing on a bloodied bird.</p>

<p>Reservations for the next out there eating event <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502152011/http://www.moma.org/learn/courses/courses">open on November 14th</a>; space is limited, so get on it early. Tickets cost $150 for non-members and in addition to the sit-down meal also includes a private tour of the exhibition with a MoMA curator. </p>
