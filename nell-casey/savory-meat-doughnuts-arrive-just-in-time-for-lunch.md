<p>Doughnuts are stepping into the lunchasphere next week as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160917153558/http://www.thedoughnutproject.com/#welcome">The Doughnut Project</a> begins a week-long celebration of savory-style doughnuts, specifically those with a meaty bent. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160917153558/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/27/doughnut_project_west_village.php#photo-1">inventive new shop</a> begins &quot;Meat Week&quot; next Monday, where they&apos;ll be offering limited editions of their yeast doughnuts flavored and topped with some form of charcuterie or other meat-related ingredient. The special doughnuts will only be available between noon and 1 p.m. each day.</p>

<p>The lineup begins with a Prosciutto, Pear &amp; Olive Oil doughnut (pictured above), followed by Soppressata with Rhubarb on Tuesday. Wednesday&apos;s offering is a Monte Cristo doughnut filled with strawberry balsamic jelly and topped with rosemary ham and Murray&apos;s Cheese swiss cheese, which are toasted onto the doughnut then sprinkled with powered sugar. The week rounds out with a Bone Marrow offering on Thursday and an Adult PB&amp;J; (foie gras whipped into peanut butter with concord grape jelly) on Friday.</p>

<p>The shop has experimented with unusual toppings and flavors since day one, offering a DIY doughnut option that included things like guanciale and cheeses and their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160917153558/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/23/doughnut_project_everything_doughnu.php">Everything Doughnut</a> caused <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160917153558/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/24/everything_donut_reviewed.php">a bit of a stir</a> when they debuted it in February. The flavors for next week are completely new (prices range from $4.25 to $5.75) and sound like they&apos;re already primed for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160917153558/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/14/unique_doughnuts_nyc.php">doughnut infamy</a>. </p>
