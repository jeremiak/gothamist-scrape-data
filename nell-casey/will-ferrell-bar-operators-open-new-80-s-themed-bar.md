<p>New York City had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170403093913/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/10/photos_will_ferrell-themed_bar_stay.php#photo-11">just about a year</a> to get all the pirate hooker jokes out of its system before Stay Classy, the Will Ferrell-themed bar on the LES, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170403093913/http://gothamist.com/2016/12/27/rip_stay_classy_les.php">closed for business</a>. At the time, co-owner Zach Neil told Gothamist they would return stronger in the new year to &quot;pay tribute to a time period in the coolest way possible!&quot;</p>

<p>That time period is the 1980s, Neil told us this morning. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170403093913/http://www.gb85nyc.com/">GB85</a> is currently in soft-open mode at 174 Rivington, in the former Stay Classy space, which has been updated with murals of &apos;80s icons including Madonna, Michael, Prince, Bowie and those lovable <em>Ghostbusters</em> ghouls. </p>

<p>&quot;The entire inside of the building is a living and evolving piece of art in tribute to the &apos;80s and especially the NYC &apos;80s,&quot; Neil explained. &quot;We had some of the biggest and best street artists from NYC such as hektad, Nicholai Khan [and] Charlie Doves come and cover the place&#x2014;floors, walls, and ceilings&#x2014;in murals and artwork representing the &apos;80s icons including some of our own New York icons such as Keith Haring.&quot;</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="033117bowie.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170403093913im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_nellcasey/033117bowie.jpg" width="640" height="483"> <br> <i> Also not &apos;80s: Ziggy Stardust-era Bowie jfc (courtesy Stay Classy)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>Navigate the website with caution&#x2014;a certain red-headed crooner may pop up at any moment&#x2014;but you&apos;ll get an idea of the scene they&apos;re trying to create, though it&apos;s a bit scattershot. Gremlins&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170403093913/hhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soNc9EXB1iw">Memba Those?!</a>&#x2014;are on the nose, but they erroneously attribute Crystal Pepsi to the &apos;80s, (that&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170403093913/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_Pepsi">the &apos;90s, baby</a>) and Ziggy Stardust-era Bowie is straight &apos;70s. </p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="033117classy.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170403093913im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_nellcasey/033117classy.jpg" width="640" height="427"> <br> <i> The space when it was Stay Classy (Alycia Kravitz/Gothamist)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>The &apos;80s weren&apos;t known for the best judgement when it comes to things like hairstyles; as such, a lot of these <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170403093913/http://www.gb85nyc.com/?page_id=248">cocktails</a> sound like recipes for barfing one out. If you can keep down the Stay Puft, a &quot;ghostly blend of Whipped Vodka, Rum chata, cream, and a hefty scoop of nutella, topped with toasted marshmallows and graham cracker crumbs&quot; then you have a stronger constitution than I.</p>

<p>Neil and co. also run a bar dedicated to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170403093913/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/21/tim_burton_bar_east_village.php">Tim Burton&apos;s oeuvre</a> and previously <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170403093913/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/08/merica_heck_ya.php">stereotyped an entire nation</a> with their sort-lived &apos;Merica restaurant. </p>
