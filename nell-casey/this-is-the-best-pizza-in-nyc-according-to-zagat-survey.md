<p>The nearly 31,000 diners and contributors to this year&apos;s Zagat survey have passed their judgement on the city&apos;s restaurants and declared that Juliana&apos;s serves the city&apos;s top pizza pie. The 2017 survey, the results of which were released today, has switched up its system this year, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110093207/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/26/dining/zagat-nyc-guide-rating-change.html?_r=0">employing a decimal-based ranking system</a> instead of restaurants earning a number of points out of 30. Patsy Grimaldi&apos;s DUMBO reboot, which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110093207/http://gothamist.com/2015/07/30/spoiler_alert_its_julianas.php">tops many a best of list</a>, earned 4.7 out of a possible 5 for its pies, beating out Paulie Gee&apos;s&#x2014;who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110093207/http://gothamist.com/2014/10/22/burnt_ashy_pizza_ftw.php">topped the list</a> for the past two years&#x2014;by a decimal point.</p>

<p>Unsurprisingly, Le Bernardin tops the overall list yet again, winning in the Top Food, Most Popular and Top Service categories, earning a 4.9. In the cuisine/specialty rankings, Greenpoint&apos;s beloved Peter Pan was awarded the survey&apos;s first Top Donuts distinction with a score of 4.5. </p>

<p>Red Hook&apos;s Hometown BBQ ascended to Top Barbecue status this year, Mu Ramen in Long Island City took home Top Ramen, Eataly won out for Top Food Hall, and Peter Luger held strong in the Top Steakhouses rankings.</p>

<p>The survey doesn&apos;t just rank restaurants, it also asks diners to weigh in on food and hospitality trends, with contributors declaring kale salad the most tedious menu item and communal tables the most irksome restaurant feature. Diners generally favored the return of carbs to the menu, and were on board for the elimination of tipping, though by a closer margin (41% vs 36%). </p>

<p>And though it seems like everyone&apos;s eating out just to get those Instagram hearts, 58% of <strike>liars</strike> respondents said they didn&apos;t take photos of their meals to share on social media. </p>
