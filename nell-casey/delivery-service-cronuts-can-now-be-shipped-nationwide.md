<p>Yes, it&apos;s true people: the city&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429215531/http://gothamist.com/tags/cronut">most coveted foodstuff</a> can be delivered to your doorstep anywhere in the United States beginning...now! Dominique Ansel has partnered with gourmet food delivery website <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429215531/https://www.goldbely.com/">Goldbely</a> to bring the Cronut to the masses not fortunate to live in New York City. Don&apos;t get too cozy, though: shipping is only available for this weekend.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429215531/https://www.goldbely.com/">Beginning at 6 p.m. today</a>, limited batches of the pastry will be released on the hour until the flash sale ends at 11:59 p.m. on Sunday. Each order contains the bakery&apos;s December Cronut flavor <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429215531/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/25/new_cronut.php">Valrhona Chocolate Champagne</a> at the regular $5 a pop. Out of towners won&apos;t be stuck paying for the distance as Goldbely will be paying for the shipping and handling. Sure beats <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429215531/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/02/faces_of_madness_cronut_fans_form_l.php">waiting on line</a>, eh? Cronuts will be overnighted on Monday for delivery on Tuesday; the bakery tells us &quot;we are waking up early to fresh make all of the Cronuts just minutes before blast chilling to produce ultimate freshness.&quot;</p>

<p>Now here&apos;s hoping the website <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429215531/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/25/cronut_online_preorder_system_falte.php">survives the onslaught</a>&#x2026;</p>

<p><b>Update</b>: The first order was placed in California, followed by New Jersey and New Mexico!</p>
