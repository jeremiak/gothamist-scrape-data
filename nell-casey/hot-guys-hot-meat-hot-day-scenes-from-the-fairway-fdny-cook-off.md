                            <p>The hot air on the pier blasted us from all directions at yesterday&apos;s FDNY cook-off in Red Hook&#x2014;and that was before Marty Markowitz arrived! Jokes! The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928035441/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/26/fdny_grilling_competition_heats_up.php">Fairway Firefighters Food Face-Off</a> brought the heat and the meat to the space behind Fairway market, with four teams of local firefighters grilling up ridiculous portions of burgers, ribs and chicken for a panel of judges including the Brooklyn Borough President and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928035441/http://instagram.com/p/ccFjYXPM3g/">yours truly</a>. </p>

<p>The sweltering heat of the afternoon intensified as the guys got to grilling. Red cups in hand&#x2014;I spotted a box of Franzia hastily stuffed into a cooler&#x2014;New York&apos;s bravest schmoozed with groupies, tossed lighthearted barbs at other teams and constructed their dishes. Organizers announced the secret burger ingredient&#x2014;Citron Confit, or preserved lemon&#x2014;and groups rushed to incorporate it with only 15 minutes before judgement began. Meanwhile the judges panel sat and perspired, waiting for the onslaught. </p>

<p>First came the burgers, with all but one team choosing to present their patties on a brioche bun. A favorite came topped with goat cheese, blue cheese, pesto and arugula; another with just an alarmingly casual slice of cheese. Next up, grilled chicken creations, as not a single team opted to make vegetable skewers (&quot;Manly men masticate meat!&quot;). And finally, a round of pork ribs, for which head judge Marty brought in a pig-eating ringer. </p>

<p>After tallying judges&apos; scores, Brooklyn Heights Hicks Street, Engine 224, took home top honors, including a $500 Fairway gift card and a Fairway Shopping Night where a percentage of profits will be donated to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928035441/http://www.nyffburncenter.com/news/index/layoutfile/home">The Firefighters Burn Center Foundation</a>, as chosen by the winners.  </p>
