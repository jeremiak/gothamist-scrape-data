But why subject yourself to those expenses when you have \<strong\>the Brooklyn Cyclones\<\/strong\> just a bit further south? The cheapest tickets cost a mere $9, (and don\'t go higher than $16) and they have weekly promotions, like Jersday Thursdays, where the first 3,000 fans receive replica jerseys, or Fireworks Fridays, which gives parkgoers a view of the Coney Island fireworks show. July has even more to offer, like $1 hot dogs and even a free garden gnome; they even play the Staten Island Yankees at the end of the month. You may not get to watch the \<em\>real\<\/em\> Yankees play, but at least you get an affordable night out and maybe a ride on the Wonder Wheel. \<em\>(Sophie Kleeman)\<\/em\>\<br\>\<br\>\<em\>Throughout July through the beginning of September // \<a href=\"http://www.brooklyncyclones.com/mcupark/directions/\"\>MCU Park\<\/a\> // \<a href=\"http://www.brooklyncyclones.com/tickets/individual/\"\>Tickets\<\/a\>\<\/em\> ", "credit":""};galleryObj['photo_2'] = photo;</script>
