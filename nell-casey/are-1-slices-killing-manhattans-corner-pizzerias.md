<p>The proliferation of dollar slices may be good for your wallet but it may also mean the death of the classic corner pizzeria still trying to serve a quality slice. A piece in the WSJ illuminates the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150626000622/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324100904578404633484751250.html?mod=WSJ_NY_MIDDLELEADNewsCollection">struggles of Manhattan&apos;s &quot;midpriced&quot; pizzerias</a> as they compete with the super cheap dough-sauce-cheese joints that are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150626000622/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/29/bowery_7-eleven_also_has_a_1_pizza.php">popping up everywhere</a>. &quot;The 99-cent slice is a giant step towards killing the classic New York pizza experience,&quot; says Las Vegas pizza professor John Arena. &quot;What&apos;s next, $1 lox and 10-cent bagels?&quot; </p>

<p>To stay relevant in the Manhattan slice scene, some pizzeria owners are cutting prices to stay competitive. East Village pizzeria Vinny Vincenz lowered the price of a plain slice from $2.50 to $1 after a 2 Bros. Pizza opened next door; owner Ary Alami noted regulars were choosing the cheap creations over his own. But others, like Joe&apos;s Pizza, which opened a second location earlier this year, refuse to buckle under the price pressure to cater to deal seekers, but worry the uninitiated may not understand the quality difference. &quot;I&apos;m worried that our slice will be equated with that slice, when it&apos;s a totally different deal,&quot; Pino &quot;Joe&quot; Pozzuoli Jr. told the Journal. </p>

<p>It remains to be seen whether all future pizza purchases will be made for a buck or whether the dollar slice dreams of a cheapskate city will fold like so many floppy slices. Other boroughs have been saved the scourge of the cheap slice, at least for now, so your $3.25 slice of heaven from Best Pizza won&apos;t be threatened in the near future. But maybe Manhattan pizzerias should employ some Brooklyn-style tactics to lure customers to their shops. We&apos;re sure they can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150626000622/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/08/robertas_naked_waitress_shrouded_in.php">find inspiration somewhere</a>.</p>
