<p>Put down the Sbarro and pick up a &apos;Shroomburger: Shake Shack is coming to JFK. Danny Meyer&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504172424/http://gothamist.com/2008/10/20/shake_shack.php">oh</a>-<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504172424/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/12/shake_shack_1.php#photo-1">my</a>-<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504172424/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/31/battery_park_city_shake_shack_opens.php">god</a>-<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504172424/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/12/shake_shack_by_barclays_center_conf.php">they&apos;re</a>-<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504172424/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/12/shake_shack_by_barclays_center_conf.php">everywhere</a> burger joint will open in JFK&apos;s newly revamped <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504172424/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/10/what_to_expect_at_jfks_revamped_ter.php">Terminal 4</a> this May along with a few other big names in the food business, like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504172424/http://gothamist.com/tags/marcussamuelsson">Marcus Samuelsson</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504172424/http://www.labreabakery.com/">La Brea Bakery</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504172424/http://www.thepalm.com/">The Palm</a>.</p>

<p>In addition to concretes and crinkle fries, Meyer will also open a satellite version of his barbecue restaurant, Blue Smoke On The Road, offering ribs and other meaty accoutrement plus specialty cocktails to wash down your pre-flight Xanex. Samuelsson, not to be outdone, will also open two restaurants: Uptown Brasserie, a New York style restaurant serving &quot;classic American favorites with international influences&quot; and the infinitely more interesting-sounding Street Food, where you can sample on-the-go foodstuffs inspired by street food around the world.</p>

<p>Other inductees to the inaugural Terminal 4 class are steakhouse The Palm Bar &amp; Grill; baked goods from La Brea Bakery and Cake Tin; French-inspired brasserie Le Grand Comptoir, which boasts an impressive selection of wines; sushi bar Asobu; and organic food market Camden food co. All of this sounding a little too highbrow for your pre-flight palate? You can still get your chain resto fix at Dunkin&apos; Donuts and McDonalds or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504172424/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/21/ex-news_anchor_rob_morrison_seen_dr.php">throw back some shots and beers</a> at Buffalo Wild Wings. </p>
