<p>A brand new bar menu has launched at Tribeca&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171015142900/http://www.racinesny.com/">Racines NY</a> aimed at giving your stomach some padding while you&apos;re tossing back glasses of wine. There are smaller bites like Chicken Liver Pate ($10), Avocado Toast ($10) and Pigs&apos; Feet Croquettes with sauce gribiche ($8), but the crowning jewel of Executive Chef Frederic Duca&apos;s new offerings is the burger ($24). Instead of beef, Duca grills a lamb shoulder, then slowly cooks it in spiced olive oil, and finishes it off with chicken stock and lamb jus. The burger&apos;s served with harissa and preserved lemon.</p>

The Sloppy Giuseppe ($20) is stuffed with a wood-grilled pork bolognese and a creamy bechamel sauce, then it&apos;s baked in the open and topped with Provel cheese, the waxy cheese blend that&apos;s popular in St. Louis. Finishing touches of chili oil, grated Pecorino Romano cheese and grated nutmeg complete the dish.</p>
