<p>The lobster empire known as Luke&apos;s has decreed that Park Slope be the latest beneficiary of their succulent crustacean rolls. The chainlet has set its sights on 237 Fifth Avenue between President and Carroll Streets, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429102213/http://www.brooklyneagle.com/articles/lobster-lovers-rejoice-lukes-headed-park-slope-2014-02-12-153000">reports the Brooklyn Eagle</a>. Besides the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429102213/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/24/lukes_lobster_opening_in_adorable_b.php">itty bitty Dumbo kiosk</a>, this will be the first full-service restaurant opened in Brooklyn, taking up 600 square feet of indoor space plus a backyard area. The team has been planning the restaurant for two years; doors are expected to open at some point in May.</p>

<p>Luke&apos;s co-owner Ben Conniff lives nearby and thought the area fit well with the company&apos;s values, as evidenced by the Park Slope Food Coop and CSA and the quantity of long-term residents. &quot;The neighborhood has the same commitment to traceability, sustainability and pure quality that we have in our menu,&#x201D; he told the paper. &quot;We feel that Park Slope has the biggest community of residents and businesses with that commitment to their home and their neighbors, and that&apos;s the vibe we want in our shack&#x2014;regulars and friendly faces, and lot of frequent diner cards on the wall.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Expect their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429102213/http://lukeslobster.com/menu/">sustainably-sourced crustacean meals</a> like lobster, crab and shrimp rolls plus soups, chowders and seasonal specials like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429102213/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/12/lobster_mac_n_cheese_debuts_on_luke.php">lobster mac and cheese</a>. The new restaurant will also offer Maine microbrews, served on tap for the first time in the restaurant&apos;s history, plus hyper local brews from Grimm Artisanal Ales, based out of Gowanus. As for their fun backyard, Conniff tells us they&apos;re planning recurring &quot;Lobster Tail Nights&quot; as well as other parties to take advantage of the outdoor space. </p>
