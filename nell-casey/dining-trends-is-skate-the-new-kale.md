<p>Step aside salmon, there&apos;s a new sea critter swimming its way onto dinner plates &apos;round these parts. Say hello to the skate, everybody! This squirmy chondrichthye, a close cousin to the stingray, has been showing its <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140303014125/http://www.allposters.com/-sp/Skate-Mouth-Region-Posters_i6015850_.htm">pretty face</a> at a bunch of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140303014125/http://gothamist.com/tags/newrestaurantandbarradar">new restaurants</a>, and while it may look a little slimy, its flesh is anything but.</p>

<p>Look for skate &quot;wing&quot; dishes, which means the fluttery, delicate fins or sides of the animal. Skate lends itself well to pan-searing or gently frying, which is how you&apos;ll find it most often on the menu. When cooked properly, it has a soft, pillowy texture that&apos;s similar to a cod or halibut and a subtle, clean flavor. </p>

<p>At Mike Price&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140303014125/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/27/inside_the_clam_a_charming_new_west.php#photo-1">new seafood eatery The Clam</a> you&apos;ll find a near classic preparation of the fish, which is lightly sauteed and served with lacinato kale, anchovies and a meyer lemon aioli. The team at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140303014125/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/14/allonda.php#photo-4">Union Square&apos;s All&apos;onda</a> beefs theirs up with a venison glaze and a side of mushrooms, beets and semolina dumplings. </p>

Finally, Chef Michael Citarella at three-week-old <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140303014125/http://nymonarch.com/">Monarch Room</a> takes a nostalgic approach with Crispy Skate Fingers: deep fried pieces of skate served with a bright and briny lemon aioli with Kalamata olives. They practically melt in your mouth.</p>
