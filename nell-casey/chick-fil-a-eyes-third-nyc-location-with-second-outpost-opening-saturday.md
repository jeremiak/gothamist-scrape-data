<p>Homophobic chicken chain Chick-Fil-A has been speedily <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160917170302/http://gothamist.com/2014/04/08/chick-fil-a_opening_multiple_nyc_re.php">making good on threats</a> to inundate New York City with fried chicken sandwiches and waffle fries. On Saturday, the chain will <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160917170302/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/17/chick-fil-a_store_2.php">open its second location</a> at West 46th Street and 6th Avenue and there are now rumors that a third location may be in the works for the ground floor of One Madison, a luxury building on 23rd Street across from Madison Square Park. Shots fired, Shake Shack!</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160917170302/http://nypost.com/2016/03/29/chick-fil-a-in-talks-to-open-third-nyc-location/">NY Post has a source</a> who indicates the problematic but popular chain is &quot;in talks&quot; to set up shop at the bottom of the 50-story luxury condo tower. Chick-Fil-A wouldn&apos;t confirm the rumor, but given their preference (so far) to open in office-and-tourist dense areas, it wouldn&apos;t be surprising to see their red chicken emblem popping up on that block. The owner of the 24-hour McDonald&apos;s next door will be thrilled, no doubt. </p>

<p>The chain&apos;s first big operation in NYC&#x2014;the tiny outpost inside an NYU dining hall notwithstanding&#x2014;has had a troubled debut so far. The restaurant <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160917170302/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/03/chick-fil-a_closed_doh.php">closed for several days</a> following a grim inspection by the DOH, the effects of which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160917170302/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/07/nycs_chick-fil-a_displays_c_grade_f.php">lingered for some time</a>. Despite that and some <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160917170302/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/18/chick-fil-a_president_prays_for_arr.php">truly shitty politics</a>, the chain continues to thrive in NYC. Let&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160917170302/http://gothamist.com/2015/09/01/nyc_chicken_lovers_guide.php">do better</a>, folks. </p>
