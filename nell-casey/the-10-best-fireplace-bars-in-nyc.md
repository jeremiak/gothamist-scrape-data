title: The 10 Best Fireplace Bars In NYC
---

	
										<p><em>Winter is almost upon us, which means it is once again time to start subsisting on carbohydrates and hot whiskey drinks in order to stave off the cold and the sadness. But though you might be tempted to hide by your radiator with seven seasons of </em>The West Wing<em> until April rolls around, there are plenty of bars in this city worth braving from December to March, thanks in part to their roaring fireplaces. Here are a few of our favorites&#x2014;feel free to leave yours in the comments.</em></p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="101913_kingston.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502122529im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_rebeccaf/101913_kingston.jpg" width="640" height="480"> <br> <i> (Via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502122529/https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=547088935315410&amp;set=pb.451059348251703.-2207520000.1384889537.&amp;type=3&amp;theater">Facebook</a>)</i></div> <p></p>

<p><strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502122529/http://www.kingstonhall.com/">KINGSTON HALL</a></strong>: There&apos;s nothing overtly Caribbean at this Jamaican-themed bar, unless solid doses of rum-heavy drinks fit that bill. But the dimly-lit East Village spot is somewhat ironically a prime for cold-weather drinking. In addition to warming libations like the hot Sorrel Cider ($12)&#x2014; made with cinnamon-mulled apple cider, Blackwell rum, nutmeg and orange&#x2014; the bar has two working fireplaces, one of which is conveniently situated next to one of the bar&apos;s pool tables. We will survive you, winter, unless we get trampled by the hordes of drunkards stumbling out of neighboring hellhole The 13th Step. </p>

<p><em>Kingston Hall is located at 149 Second Ave between 9th and 10th Streets in the East Village (212-673-2663, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502122529/http://www.kingstonhall.com/">kingstonhall.com</a>).</em></p>

<p><strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502122529/http://www.blackmountainwinehouse.com/">BLACK MOUNTAIN WINE HOUSE</a></strong>: Aside from being one of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502122529/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/06/best_date_bars_in_new_york_city.php">most stellar date bars</a> in town, Black Mountain Wine House kicks it in the cold season with a crackling fireplace in the back. Grab a seat as close to the flames as possible and warm up with a bottle of wine ($28-$45) and a couple tasty small plates; the house mac &apos;n cheese ($10), made with wild mushrooms, gruyere &amp; truffle oil, is prime winter fare; along with a toasty $16 fondue special on Tuesdays.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502122529/http://www.artbar.com/">ART BAR</a></strong>: There are a lot of reasons to make this decades-old West Village bar your drinking home this winter, not the least of which is the flame-heavy fireplace in the back room. There&apos;s the wine, of course, which ranges from $6 to $8 per glass, the $6 beer drafts and the seasonal Pumpkin pie martini, made with pumpkin spice and coffee liqueur. More importantly, there&apos;s the infamous contemporary Last Supper mural in the back room, which swaps out Apostles and Jesus for bygone celebs like Richard Nixon, James Dean and Jim Morrison; take a seat on one of the bar&apos;s many worn-in couches and let the dead famous people watch you as you warm up. </p>

<p><em>Art Bar is located at 52 8th Ave between Jane and West 4th Streets in the West Village (212-727-0244, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502122529/http://www.artbar.com/">artbar.com</a>).

<p><strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502122529/http://www.shoolbreds.com/">SHOOLBRED&apos;S</a></strong>: The East Village might have been overtaken by the city&apos;s fratastic overlords in recent years, but this 2nd Ave spot holds its own against the Loud and Proud, serving up casual beers and cocktails in an elegant parlor space. A cozy fireplace only adds to the bar&apos;s atavistic atmosphere, warming patrons drinking in private booths and at tables nearby. Sip a signature hot toddy ($12) made with green tea, Glen Grant scotch, cinnamon and honey, or sample a piping hot mulled cider ($12), made with applejack brandy and nutmeg, and let the winter blues burn away.</p>

<p><strong>DADDY&apos;S</strong>: It&apos;s not often that a dive comes stocked with a working fireplace, but this Graham Ave spot does a pretty solid job of combining a grimy cheap beer scene with the joy of crackling flames. Pull up a seat at the horseshoe-shaped bar, grab a $4 draft and a $2 hot dog/veggie dog and be prepared to spend your laundry quarters on a few rounds of Pacman before the evening&apos;s end. </p>
