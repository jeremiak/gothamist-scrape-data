<p>As the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170302164218/http://gothamist.com/2015/11/04/uhoh_spaghettios.php">trend watchers predicted</a>, New York City is in the midst of poke-sanity, with multiple new restaurants dedicated to the Hawaiian fish dish open now or in the near future. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170302164218/http://gothamist.com/2015/09/01/nyc_chicken_lovers_guide.php">Check ya later chicken</a>! The poke trend has already <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170302164218/http://laist.com/2015/08/07/poke_rules_everything_around_me.php">exploded over Los Angeles</a>, so now it&apos;s time for New Yorkers to get in on the fish party. </p>

<p>But what exactly is poke (poh-kay)? In the simplest terms, it&apos;s a raw fish salad, similar to a tartare or even ceviche, though poke is typically less acidic. Raw tuna, typically, is marinated in soy sauce and sesame oil then tossed with onions, jalapenos and wasabi, for example, though the combinations are myriad. Regardless of the protein source, another poke standout is the cubed shape of the meat, as the word comes from the Hawaiian for &quot;to slice or cut.&quot; </p>

<p>Some restaurants offer pre-set poke creations, but a popular choice is a DIY version, where diners are in charge of their own destiny. Regardless your predilection, here are a few options for experiencing a little bit of Hawaii amidst the NYC snowscape.</p>
