<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170319044640/http://queensnightmarket.com/">Queens Night Market</a> returns to a parking lot of the New York Hall of Science this spring, debuting a new ticketing system for its first two weekends to alleviate some of the intense crowding. Crowds at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170319044640/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/25/queens_international_night_market_s.php#photo-1">last year&apos;s opening night</a> were so packed in that it was &quot;impossible to move within half an hour&quot; of the doors opening.</p>

<p>To gain access to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170319044640/https://queensnightmarket.ticketleap.com/sneak-preview-1/">April 22nd</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170319044640/https://queensnightmarket.ticketleap.com/sneak-preview-2/">April 29th</a> markets, visitors will have to purchase $5 tickets in advance, a move founder John Wang hopes will stagger the amount of visitors from showing up all at once. Half of the proceeds from these &quot;sneak peek&quot; events will be donated to three charities: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170319044640/http://www.thenyic.org/">New York Immigration Coalition</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170319044640/http://www.answerthecall.org/">New York Police and Fire Widows&apos; and Children&apos;s Benefit Fund </a>and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170319044640/http://allianceforfmcp.org/">Alliance for Flushing Meadows Corona Park</a>. About 10,000 tickets will sold for each night.</p>

<p>Also new this year is the lift on the $5 vendor cap, with some vendors now allowed to sell dishes priced at $6. New stands will be serving dishes including &quot;Valencian paella; Indonesian tahu magelang and kue pancong; Ecuadorian bollos and corviche; Barbadian fishballs; Nigerian jollof rice and puff-puff,&quot; and other global eats, according to press materials.</p>

<p>Starting May 6th, the Market will once again be free for anyone to attend. There are live performances, DJs, a beer and wine garden, and non-edible vendors as well. Driving isn&apos;t recommended&#x2014;and the subway was a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170319044640/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/25/queens_international_night_market_s.php#photo-1">nightmare last year</a>&#x2014;so manage expectations accordingly. </p>
