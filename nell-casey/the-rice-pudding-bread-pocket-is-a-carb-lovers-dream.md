<p>Have you gotten the proper dose of refined flour and starch in your diet today? If not, allow <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108025742/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/19/rice_cream_shoppe_rice_pudding.php">recently-opened</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108025742/http://www.ricecreamshoppe.com/">Rice Cream Shoppe</a> to drive your blood sugar levels through the roof with a Rice Pudding Pocket. </p>

<p>Yes, a sandwich essentially composed of carbohydrates and sugar is now on the menu. A fluffy brioche bun gets cut in half and stuffed with a scoop of one of ye olde shoppe&apos;s flavours of rice pudding, then the pudding is topped with some crunch element (Italian lemon cookies, chocolate crisp, etc.) and it all comes together like a sandwich. One pocket&apos;ll cost you back $4.50 and a lifetime&apos;s worth of insulin shots.</p>

<p>Be the carb bomb you want to see in the world.</p>
