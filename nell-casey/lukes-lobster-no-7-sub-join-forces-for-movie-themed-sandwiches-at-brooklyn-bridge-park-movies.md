<p>Film buffs have a new menu item to this season&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130821223506/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/24/brooklyn_bridge_parks_free_summer_m.php">Brooklyn Bridge Park free movie lineup</a>. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130821223506/http://lukeslobster.com/">Luke&apos;s Lobster</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130821223506/http://www.no7sub.com/dumbo-menu.html">No. 7 Sub</a> are creating a weekly sandwich collaboration themed to whatever movie is playing down by the river. For this week&apos;s <em>Enter The Dragon</em> screening, the two sandwich shops created the Happy Family Sandwich: Marinated Maine shrimp, roast pork, broccoli and Sriracha mayo on a potato bun for $7. </p>

<p>Each week&apos;s specialty sandwich can be procured on the Pier 1 walkway as you approach the movie screen between 5 p.m. and 8 p.m. Both restaurant counters will serve their regular menus out of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130821223506/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/24/lukes_lobster_opening_in_adorable_b.php">adorable Smokestack Building</a> for regular business hours. Next week the park screens <em>Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory</em>, so we&apos;re suggesting a Mike TV Dinner Sandwich with Cold Turkey Meatloaf, BBQ Shrimp, Roasted Onions and Smoked French Dressing. Helluva lot better than any fish caught in that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130821223506/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8X48RiKQmFQ">psychedelic chocolate river</a>!</p>
