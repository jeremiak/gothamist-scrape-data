<p>Food packaging is definitely <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108031454/http://gothamist.com/2014/11/04/amazon_fresh_packaging_problems.php">out of control</a>&#x2014;why are most sandwiches cocooned in <em>two</em> types of wrapping?&#x2014;the result of which are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108031454/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/19/putrid_plastic_particles_pollute_po.php">floating islands of trash</a> in our rivers and other water sources. Reusable and recyclable alternatives are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108031454/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/10/the_fillery_bulk_grocery_store.php">beginning to pop up</a>, but one forthcoming restaurant is taking a drastic (and aggressively twee) approach to stemming the flow of waste by serving all of their food in glass jars. If <em>Portlandia</em> hasn&apos;t gotten there yet, it&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108031454/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/23/video_brokelandia_it_was_bound_to_h.php">only a matter of time</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108031454/http://www.ancolie.co/">Ancolie</a> is set to open this September at 58 West 8th Street. There, entrepreneur Chloe Vichot will sell seasonal meals that fit inside custom glass jars that can be reused as food vessels, repurposed for other uses, or returned to the restaurant and exchanged for a free meal once you&apos;ve saved up ten to give back. &quot;Items will be available in wide mouth custom made clear glass jars that are easy to grab, portion controlled, stackable, leak proof, easy to open and close and freezer, microwave and dishwasher safe,&quot; according to press materials.</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="062016jars2.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108031454im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_nellcasey/062016jars2.jpg" width="640" height="427"> <br> <i> (courtesy Ancolie)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>Salads ($10-$13)&#x2014;like a Nordic poached salmon with lentils&#x2014;protein and rice combos ($12-$14), layered omelets and chia puddings ($6) will be the thrust of the food offerings, with a third-generation chocolate cake recipe ($5) sneaking in to save the place from over-earnestness. Diners can get lucky at one of the 15 seats that&apos;ll be inside the restaurant or take their meals to go, but be forewarned that there&apos;ll be no plastic bags and coffee served in cardboard cups will be subject to a &quot;tax.&quot; </p>

<p>There are still four days left in a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108031454/https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ancolie/ancolie-the-glass-jars-project">Kickstarter campaign</a> to fund the first round of jar creation (they&apos;ve already met their goal and more than doubled it), if so interested. While there, read some sobering statistics on the impact of the lunch you buy at work every day be and prepared to swim with a trash dolphin at the beach this summer.</p>
