<p>Two beloved East Village restaurants have announced that they&apos;re closing. Haven&apos;t you done enough, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161111112152/http://gothamist.com/tags/election2016">2016</a>?</p>

<p>Yesterday, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161111112152/http://evgrieve.com/2016/11/the-redhead-closes-for-good-in-january.html">EV Grieve brought word</a> that The Redhead would be ending its decade-long run <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161111112152/http://gothamist.com/2015/03/26/best_fried_chicken_nyc.php">frying up excellent chicken</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161111112152/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/12/where_to_find_the_best_beer_cheese.php">whipping up beer cheese</a> on East 13th Street. There&apos;s the standard rent increase on a new lease, but the chef and founding partner has apparently also moved to Colorado, perhaps leaving less of an impetus to remain open. They&apos;ll be open at least through New Year&apos;s Eve, with no fixed closing date just yet.</p>

<p>Then today, once again EV Grieve&#x2014;too often tasked with a death herald&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161111112152/http://evgrieve.com/2016/11/porchetta-has-closed-on-7th-street.html">got in touch with the owners of Porchetta</a>, the tiny East 7th Street shop known for, well, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161111112152/http://gothamist.com/2014/06/12/porchetta_guide.php">its porchetta</a>. Matt Lindemulder claims they&apos;re &quot;not permanently shut just moving,&quot; but a new location has yet to be secured. Coincidentally, chef and co-owner <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161111112152/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/01/chef_sara_jenkins_talks_pasta_yelpe.php">Sara Jenkins</a> also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161111112152/http://www.grubstreet.com/2016/11/porchetta-is-closed-in-the-east-village.html">moved out of New York City</a>, lamenting that it&apos;s &quot;just too difficult to live in at this point&quot; in her life.</p>
