<p>A few Philly transplants have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171101222850/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/01/daves_hoagies_brings_philly-style_s.php">moved on up</a> to the Big Apple, with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171101222850/http://gothamist.com/2015/09/30/pyt_burgers_come_to_nyc.php#photo-1">varying degrees of success</a>. The latest: Federal Donuts, the donut and fried chicken emporium that&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171101222850/http://www.eater.com/2015/4/10/8370993/federal-donuts-philadelphia-fried-chicken-michael-solomonov">something of a phenomenon</a> in its home city of Brotherly Love. The only catch: it&apos;s just for a night.</p>

<p>If the name Michael Solomonov is memorable to you it&apos;s likely because of his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171101222850/http://gothamist.com/2016/05/23/dizengoff_hummus_chelsea_market.php#photo-1">new hummus emporium</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171101222850/http://www.dizengoffhummus.com/">Dizengoff</a>&#x2014;itself an offspring of the Philadelphia original&#x2014;in Chelsea market. Solomonov&apos;s behind Federal, too, and he&apos;s going to be taking over the fryers at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171101222850/http://www.chefsclub.com/">Chefs Club of NY</a> on September 9th to show NYC what he&apos;s got, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171101222850/http://www.grubstreet.com/2016/08/federal-donuts-will-be-available-in-nyc-for-one-day-only.html">according to GrubStreet</a>. </p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="083116federal.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20171101222850im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_nellcasey/083116federal.jpg" width="640" height="580"> <br> <i> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171101222850/https://www.facebook.com/federaldonuts/photos/a.251219571600803.64951.168156473240447/971743509548402/?type=3&amp;theater">Facebook</a>)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>From 7 a.m. to 11 a.m. on the day, it&apos;s all about doughnuts. Like Krispy Kreme, there&apos;ll be &quot;hot fresh&quot; doughnuts ($2) in flavors like cinnamon brown sugar and glazed doughnuts ($3) in flavors like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171101222850/https://www.facebook.com/federaldonuts/photos/a.251219571600803.64951.168156473240447/687923454597077/?type=3&amp;theater">Marshmallow Marshmallow</a>, which are topped with mini bruleed marshmallows. Oh you think you&apos;re <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171101222850/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/14/unique_doughnuts_nyc.php">WILD</a>, don&apos;t you Mikey? </p>

<p>From 11 a.m. to 2 p.m, the fried chicken, in sandwich form here as a double fried breast dredged in buttermilk-ranch topped with cheese, pickles and a spicy sauce. </p>

<p>There are no plans (announced, anyway) for a full-time outpost of Federal in NYC, but the chainlet will be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171101222850/http://www.eater.com/2016/6/9/11890154/federal-donuts-expansion-miami-nashville-michael-solomonov">taking its talents elsewhere</a> in the USA. Give the people what the want. Or don&apos;t!
