					<p>&quot;I wanted it to look mysterious,&quot; Keizo Shimamoto says while standing outside the nondescript storefront of his new (well, sort of, we&apos;ll get to that) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170312224929/http://gothamist.com/2016/08/25/fall_restaurant_preview_2016.php">ramen shop</a> opening today on 40th Avenue in Long Island City. There&apos;s a small sign next to the door that reads either &quot;getting ready&quot; or &quot;open,&quot; but if you don&apos;t read Japanese, just look for the lantern, which&apos;ll be lit when this new iteration of Ramen Shack is ready to welcome diners.</p>

<p>In comparison to the austere exterior, the inside is bright and cheery, and will be busy with Shimamoto and his staff bustling around creating the stocks, tare and toppings that&apos;ll be part of the seven or so bowls on offer each day. The space originally served (and still does) as a commissary kitchen for the many arms of Shimamoto&apos;s business, which include the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170312224929/http://gothamist.com/tags/ramenburger">Ramen Burger</a>, ramen pop-ups, and a retail business that supplies ramen ingredients to a few NYC restaurants. Perching at some of the space&apos;s 10 seats, you&apos;ll have a widescreen view of everything going on behind the scenes.</p>

<p>The idea for a restaurant came out of necessity: there was no place large enough to store the structure that served as the facade of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170312224929/http://gothamist.com/2015/06/25/ramen_burger_shack_queens.php">Ramen Shack pop-ups</a> at Smorgasburg. But it dawned on Shimamoto that this would be the perfect way to showcase his proprietary ramen and burgers in an underutilized front office of the kitchen. &quot;Even if nobody comes to eat, I&apos;ll be prepping and thinking of new stuff.&quot; Given that Ramen Burger <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170312224929/http://gothamist.com/2015/04/05/photos_smorgasburg_returns_to_windy.php#photo-1">still draws a line</a>, I find that unlikely.</p>

<p>This is Shimamoto&apos;s first brick-and-mortar in which he&apos;s a sole proprietor; he helped <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170312224929/http://gothamist.com/2014/04/03/better_line_up_now_at_the_permanent.php">open Ramen Co</a>, which has since shuttered, in the Financial District. He&apos;ll serve six or seven bowls of ramen&#x2014;with some &quot;secret&quot; day-of menu additions, possibly&#x2014;plus wontons and his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170312224929/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/21/veggie_ramen_burger_omfg.php">full roster</a> of Ramen Burgers. </p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="092716quietstorm.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170312224929im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_nellcasey/092716quietstorm.jpg" width="640" height="427"> <br> <i> &quot;Quiet Storm&quot; (Scott Lynch/Gothamist)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>There&apos;ll be traditional shio, shoyu and tonkotsu bowls on offer, but the focus, for opening at least, are two new creations: the Truffle Shio&#x2014;made with Sabatino Tartufi white truffle-infused olive oil&#x2014;and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170312224929/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvCp-N-9JEw">&quot;Quiet Storm,&quot;</a> named after rap group Mobb Deep, the duo whose member Havoc grew up in the adjacent Queensbridge Houses. </p>

<p>Shimamoto&apos;s particularly excited about the latter, which he created using the soup from a tsukemen&#x2014;a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170312224929/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/15/ippudo_atsumori_tsukemen_ramen.php">dipping-style ramen</a>&#x2014;that he crafted earlier this year blended with dashi to turn it into this new ramen. The original stock has 13 different ingredients, a rich combination of chicken, pork, seafood and other umami-rich components. It&apos;s deep and unctuous&#x2014;topped with some of the best chashu pork this blogger has ever tried&#x2014;with flat noodles courtesy of Sun Noodles ready to be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170312224929/http://gothamist.com/2015/11/03/how_to_eat_ramen.php">slurped up</a>. Shimamoto says his goal, eventually, will be to make his own noodles.</p>

<p>Ramen Shack will only be open from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. for now and only on Tuesdays through Fridays, but there&apos;s the possibility of staying open later if there&apos;s demand. And don&apos;t expect that your destination bowl of soup will be on the menu when you show up. &quot;This is the next step for me. Three years of good and bad decisions have brought me back to what I wanted to do originally,&quot; Shimamoto says. &quot;This is my lab where I can change styles whenever I want.&quot; </p>
