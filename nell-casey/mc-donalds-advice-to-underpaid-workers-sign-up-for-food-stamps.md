<p>You&apos;d think after the public ridicule McDonald&apos;s endured for its <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508124035/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/16/mcdonalds_helpfully_illustrates_tha.php">tone deaf &quot;budget&quot; for employees</a> that the fast food giant would get its act together when doling out &quot;advice&quot; to its pitifully paid staff. Nope. Once again McDonald&apos;s went out of its way to &quot;help&quot; its desperately underpaid employees by...urging them to sign up for federal assistance. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508124035/http://lowpayisnotok.org/">Low Pay Is Not Ok</a>, an advocacy site for fast food workers, published their latest installment of McDonald&apos;s idiocy with audio of a McDonald&apos;s &quot;McResources&quot; operator urging long-time employee Nancy Salgado to look into SNAP (Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program) to help feed herself and her two children. Salgado calls looking for a way out of the food rationing she and her family have been forced to do. &quot;You would most likely be eligible for SNAP benefits,&quot; the operator confides, going on to emphasize that it&apos;s a federal program that&apos;s administered by the states. Salgado also asks about doctors, to which the operator suggests Medicaid&#x2014;another federal program&#x2014;to cover her family&apos;s medical needs. </p>

<p>Listen to an edited version of the call below and prepare your eyeballs for some epic rolling:</p>

<p>Looks like the fast food giant has no problem <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508124035/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/16/low-wage_fast_food_jobs_cost_new_yo.php">passing the buck to taxpayers</a> when it comes to supplementing their meager compensation. Two studies published last week revealed that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508124035/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/16/low-wage_fast_food_jobs_cost_new_yo.php">McDonald&apos;s leaves taxpayers</a> responsible for $1.2 billion annually across the nation to fund federal programs like SNAP and Medicaid with other fast food chains not far behind. </p>

<p>The corporation saw profits in the billions last year, which was doubled when adding in dividends and stock buybacks. On top of that, McDonald&apos;s CEO Donald Thompson is sitting pretty with a sweet $13.7 million per year salary. Meanwhile, Salgado, who has worked for the chain for over a decade, has never seen a raise from the $8.25 an hour rate she started out with. </p>
