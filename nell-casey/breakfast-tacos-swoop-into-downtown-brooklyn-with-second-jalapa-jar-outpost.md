<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170616075251/https://www.jalapajar.com/">Jalapa Jar&apos;s</a> breakfast tacos are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170616075251/http://gothamist.com/2016/08/22/jalapa_jar_breakfast_tacos.php#photo-1">rising up from the subway station</a> and into a new temporary home in Downtown Brooklyn, their first that won&apos;t compete with commuters in the daily rushes. Real estate company <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170616075251/http://www.alloyllc.com/">Alloy Development</a> is waging a charm offensive with the neighborhood before its <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170616075251/https://ny.curbed.com/2017/4/3/15169318/downtown-brooklyn-development-alloy-80-flatbush">new development</a> takes shape at 80 Flatbush. This involves &quot;activating&quot; empty storefronts along Schermerhorn, including the Jalapa Jar pop-up space, which will be offered to owners Tommy Byrnes and Steve Smith rent-free.</p>

<p>Byrnes tells Gothamist to expect the &quot;same menu of breakfast taco options, Texas Queso, seasonal soups and chips with our fresh-made salsa and guacamole&quot; that they&apos;re currently offering inside the Clark Street station. The new space will also allow the team to expand their queso production for takeaway, in addition to the ability to sometimes make their own masa tortillas. Byrnes didn&apos;t spill the beans on the new menu items, but promised they&apos;d be &quot;more creative than the subway space.&quot; </p>

<p>The Jalapa team will also be working with food incubator <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170616075251/http://thefoodworks.com/brooklyn">Brooklyn FoodWorks</a> to create an on-site &quot;groceraunt&quot; for more grab-and-go items like coffee and other grocery products. &quot;Customers can pop-in and pick up some Legally Addictive Crack Cookies or a MetaBrew as well as enjoy some baked goods from Awkward Scone and other items being made by fellow Brooklyn food entrepreneurs,&quot; according to Byrnes. </p>
