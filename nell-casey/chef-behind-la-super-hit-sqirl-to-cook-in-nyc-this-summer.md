<p>Those who worship at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170616013225/http://theconcourse.deadspin.com/down-with-chef-worship-1795061446">chef&apos;s altar</a> should take note of what&apos;s going on at the South Street Seaport this summer. </p>

<p>Big name chefs including Hugh Acheson and Jessica Koslow (if I have to tell you why they&apos;re important is this really the piece for you? Just kidding more below) are part of the newly launched <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170616013225/https://www.seaportdistrict.nyc/foodlab.html">Seaport FoodLab</a>, a dinner series that invites chefs from around the country (and NYC) for two week residencies at 203 Front Street. Each chef&#x2014;chefs, in some cases&#x2014;has two weeks in residency, with the only stipulation being a collaborative beer effort with Sixpoint Brewery. </p>

<p>First in the lineup are Paul Kahan, Erling Wu-Bower, and Cosmo Goss, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170616013225/https://chicago.eater.com/2017/2/27/14751752/erling-wu-bower-cosmo-goss-new-restaurant-tavernita-space-river-north-underscore-group">acclaimed</a> Chicago chefs who will be previewing their new restaurant Pacific Standard Time, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170616013225/http://www.chicagotribune.com/dining/restaurants/ct-goss-and-wu-bower-s-river-north-restaurant-has-a-name-pacific-standard-time-20170515-story.html">opening this fall</a> in the River North neighborhood. Next, Acheson&#x2014;whose mug can be seen passing judgement on <em>Top Chef: Atlanta</em>&#x2014;followed by Alon Shaya, a New Orleans Magazine Chef of the Year who&apos;ll be cooking contemporary Israeli food.</p>

<p>That brings us to Koslow, a name well known to Angelenos for her <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170616013225/http://laist.com/2016/04/13/sqirl_still_got_it.php">smash hit Sqirl</a>. She&apos;s opening up a new restaurant, Tel, in a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170616013225/https://la.eater.com/2016/9/26/13055184/jessica-koslow-restaurant-west-la-coming-news-dinner">warehouse in West LA</a>, and she&apos;ll be previewing what&apos;ll be on the menu during her stint in August. Finally, local boy Dale Talde &quot;and Friends&quot; will be rocking their fusion deal in September.</p>

<p>A final participant for October will be announced soon. Here&apos;s the full schedule: </p>

<ul><li>June 19 - July 2: Paul Kahan, Erling Wu-Bower and Cosmo Goss</li>

<p>Once a section of the Financial District reserved for tourists&#x2014;after it was a place <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170616013225/http://gothamist.com/2004/04/01/fulton_fish_market.php">for fish</a>&#x2014;the Seaport&apos;s turning into...a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170616013225/http://gothamist.com/2014/09/19/south_street_seaport_fight.php">fancy place for tourists</a>. Momofuku&apos;s David Chang will be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170616013225/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/23/david_chang_seaport.php">opening a restaurant</a> in the new Pier 17, as will Jean-Georges Vongerichten, and a new <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170616013225/http://gothamist.com/tags/bychloe">by CHLOE</a> will also grace the space with vegan eats. </p>
