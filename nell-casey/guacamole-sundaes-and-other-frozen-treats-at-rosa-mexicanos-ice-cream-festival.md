                            <p>Perfectly timed for the dog days of summer, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130822040249/http://www.rosamexicano.com/">Rosa Mexicana</a> begins its annual Ice Cream Festival at the end of this month, offering up south-of-the-border-inspired frozen desserts. The special menu runs from July 31st through August 25th and includes both sweet and salty arctic applications, all part of their ongoing Flavors of Mexico series.</p>

<p>The restaurant offers a variety of &quot;Paleta&quot; Posicles, in Guava, Chile &amp; Huckleberry and other fruity combinations; Ice Cream Stuffed Churros, deep fried fritters filled with malted coffee and plantain &amp; peanut butter ice creams with chocolate fudge ganache; and unique ice cream flavors like Strawberry Rose and Mexican Sour Gherkin &amp; Jalapeno Sorbet.</p>

<p>But the show stopper at the Festival lies in the Guacamole de Postre. Prepared tableside like their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130822040249/http://gothamist.com/2012/09/15/six_spots_to_celebrate_national_gua.php">delicious regular guacamoles</a>, this playful &quot;sundae&quot; uses sweet avocado ice cream mixed with fresh raspberries, white chocolate shavings and coconut crunch. Instead of corn chips, the &quot;guac&quot; comes with pilonchillo chocolate sauce and fluffy cinnamon sugar Buenuelos, a kind of fried dough ball. </p>
