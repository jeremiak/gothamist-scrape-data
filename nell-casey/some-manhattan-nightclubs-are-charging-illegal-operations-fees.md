<p>In a story that will come as a shock to absolutely no one, nightclubs are shady and possibly rip people off. Today the Post reports that certain Manhattan nightclubs are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408151315/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/clubs_money_grub_xTwILXlmdRes7WEA1NhXmO">billing customers for &quot;operations charges,&quot;</a> which officials say is illegal. Multiple EMM-operated clubs&#x2014;including <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408151315/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/02/bowery_condo_owners_say_buildings_c.php">headache-inducing Finale</a> on the Bowery and SL in the Meatpacking District&#x2014;as well as other area clubs are currently under investigation by the city for the questionable practice. Fees between 3 and 5 perfect for drinks and bottle service are added to receipts and messages printed on the back explain that the fees are meant to &quot;offset a variety of ever-changing costs that affect our particular business.&quot; Maybe that&apos;s industry code for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408151315/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/02/video_heres_what_a_normal_new_years.php">clean-up services</a>? </p>

<p>Bill Bonbrest, COO for Tae Group, insists the practice is above board because their &quot;prices and pricing policies are clearly presented to our guests before an order is placed.&quot; A lawyer for EMM brings up the same point, saying the clubs have &quot;worked very hard to ensure that its menus and checks very clearly disclose all pricing and charges to their customers.&quot; But Department of Consumer Affairs spokeswoman Abigail Lootens negates that notion, pointing out that &quot;even if listed on a menu or receipt, surcharges are illegal in New York.&quot; </p>

<p>If you were fleeced by these fraudulent fees you can dispute them with your credit card company and beg for a refund (good luck!). In the meantime, we should all be scrutinizing our Tenjune receipts or, you know, just <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408151315/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/16/the_best_dive_bars_in_new_york_city.php"><em>not going to nightclubs</em></a>?</p>
