					<p>The darling little smokestack building that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170318031008/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/24/lukes_lobster_opening_in_adorable_b.php">supplies seasonal concessions</a> in Brooklyn Bridge Park has been transformed into a fully formed outpost of Luke&apos;s Lobster as of Wednesday. The building was previously home to takeout-only counters for No. 7 Sub and Luke&apos;s Lobster, but the former has left and been replaced by cafe tables and chairs, plus an expanded menu that includes beer and wine. </p>

<p>Lobster, crab and shrimp rolls anchor the menu, which also includes a Tail and Kale seasonal salad that&apos;ll be replaced by a blueberry version come spring. Clam chowder and lobster bisque (both gluten-free), lobster and crab grilled cheese (also seasonal), and a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170318031008/http://www.brooklyncured.com/">Brooklyn Cured</a> hot dog on the &quot;Shorts&quot; (kids) offerings are on the opening menu. </p>

<p>New to the location will be the hooch, including a proprietary Lobsterman&apos;s Choice brew by Shipyard Brewing on tap, plus cans from Shipyard and Peak Organic, and wines by the glass from Bridge Lane. Alcohol will be allowed in the outdoor seating area to be set up this spring and patrons can even order (unopened) beers to go, according to Luke&apos;s President Ben Conniff. Summer by the river just got a whole lot sweeter.</p>

<p>If you happened to snatch some fresh lobster on a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170318031008/http://gothamist.com/2017/03/13/grocery_store_panic_blizzard_2017.php#photo-1">grocery store run</a> yesterday, today&apos;s the perfect slushed-in afternoon to make some lobster rolls of your own before tomorrow&apos;s opening; let Conniff <a href="authors.gothamistllc.com/mt/mt.cgi?__mode=list_entry&amp;blog_id=1">show you the way</a>:</p>
