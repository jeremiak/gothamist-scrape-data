										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="041016gsc.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170419032556im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_nellcasey/041016gsc.jpg" width="649" height="510" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>One hundred years ago a single troop of Girl Scouts launched what&apos;s now a treasured, nationwide excuse to consume vast quantities of sugar in the spirit of female entrepreneurship. It&apos;s cookie season yet again, folks, and Tuesday marks the return of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170419032556/https://www.girlscoutsnyc.org/cookies/corporate-cookie-connection">Corporate Cookie Connection</a>, where businesses open their lobbies and cafeterias up to the gals in green as an outlet to sell lots of cookies. Here Be Thin Mints.</p>

<p>Hours vary by location, but generally midday&apos;s when they&apos;ll be set up. Last year, New Yorkers purchased a whopping 1,274,467 boxes within the five boroughs and the girls are already paced to break that record, potentially selling 1.4 million boxes in 2017. </p>

<p>Do your part and help them out by stopping by one of the locations listed below. Some locations will have the option to pay by credit card, but generally it&apos;s wise to bring cash (cookies are $4 per box).  </p>
