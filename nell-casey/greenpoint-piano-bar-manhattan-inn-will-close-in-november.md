<p>Cozy restaurant/cocktail lounge/piano bar Manhattan Inn performs its last number in November, closing the doors after seven years on Manhattan Avenue in Greenpoint. The bar has been tickling the ivories <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021165901/http://gothamist.com/2009/11/12/bar_henry.php?gallery0Pic=4#photo-4">since 2009</a>, but now the team sends word to its beloved fans that the final night of service will be November 13th. They promise, however, that they&apos;ll be back.</p>

<p>&quot;We are incredibly grateful to our staff, the artists, and everyone who has supported us since 2009,&quot; ownership said via email. &quot;We are looking forward to unveiling a new and exciting endeavor that will serve the community in a fresh atmosphere come 2017.&quot;</p>

<p>In addition to being one of the rare piano bars outside Manhattan, the space was designed almost entirely with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021165901/http://gothamist.com/2009/11/16/greenpoints_manhattan_inn.php#photo-1">upcycled materials</a>&#x2014;the doorknob tap handles were particularly endearing&#x2014;lending it a homey and charming vibe. We&apos;ve reached out to see if Manhattan Inn 2.0 will keep the same aesthetic and also be a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021165901/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/04/best_piano_bars_nyc.php">piano bar and venue</a>, and we&apos;ll update when we hear back. </p>

<p>In its final month, the venue will host all its <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021165901/http://us4.campaign-archive2.com/?u=e2fc3cb35da9c5d4fbec109c0&amp;id=3b98fde4b8">shows</a> in the back room for free, though they&apos;re asking for suggested donations for the artists. </p>
