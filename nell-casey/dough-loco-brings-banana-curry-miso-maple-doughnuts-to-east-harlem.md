</div></div>					<p>A tiny new storefront in East Harlem has begun turning out some unique doughnut offerings, a concept we can always get behind. Chef <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150303074405/https://twitter.com/coreycova">Corey Cova</a> recently opened <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150303074405/https://www.facebook.com/DoughLoco">Dough Loco</a>, a ten seat doughnut and coffee counter frying up a selection of inventive glaze flavors paired with Blue Bottle beans and brews. Before opening this dough-haven, Cova presented his culinary flair at nearby <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150303074405/http://gothamist.com/tags/earl&apos;sbeerandcheese">Earl&apos;s Beer &amp; Cheese</a> and ABV, which along with cocktail den <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150303074405/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/06/best_date_bars_in_new_york_city.php">Guthrie Inn</a> have been slowly transforming the previously sleepy neighborhood of Carnegie Hill/East Harlem.</p>

<p>On offer for the opening: a sweet and crunchy Miso Maple, a tangy Blueberry Lime and a Pineapple Brown Butter. As part of their successful <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150303074405/http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/coreycova/dough-loco">Kickstarter campaign</a>, one backer created their own flavor, which resulted in the Blood Orange glaze topped with poppy seeds. Upstate chocolatier <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150303074405/http://www.tastefruition.com/">Fruition</a> supplied the goods for a Chocolate Stout doughnut and they&apos;ll also offer a regular glazed option to keep things simple. Look for a Banana Curry with Dolce de Leche on the menu tomorrow and cake-style doughnuts sometime in the future. </p>

<p><em>1261 Park Avenue, no phone; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150303074405/https://www.facebook.com/DoughLoco">facebook.com/DoughLoco</a>. Open 7 a.m. daily</em></p>
