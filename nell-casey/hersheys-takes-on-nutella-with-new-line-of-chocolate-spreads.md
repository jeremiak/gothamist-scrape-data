<p>Dreams of smearing your toast with melted Hershey&apos;s Kisses have become a reality with the launch of the candy giant&apos;s latest infernal creation: chocolate spreads. The company <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501172345/http://www.brandeating.com/2014/01/news-hersheys-new-chocolate-spreads.html">unleashed three creamy cocoas</a> last week under its iconic masthead, offering three flavors of decadent spreads to <strike>slather on bread</strike> spoon into your mouth hole.</p>

<p>First up, a plain Chocolate flavor, in line with the company&apos;s classic candy bar favored by milquetoast eaters who prefer their chocolate <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501172345/http://sweets.seriouseats.com/2008/09/chocolate-cocoa-butter-replacements-hersheys.html">&quot;pure.&quot;</a> Next up, the Nutella knockoff Chocolate with Hazelnut and the brand&apos;s bold foray into the nut world, Chocolate with Almond. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501172345/http://www.brandeating.com/2014/01/news-hersheys-new-chocolate-spreads.html">Brand Eating</a> notes that 13-ounce jars of the stuff will retail for $3.79; that&apos;s just slightly more expensive than <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501172345/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/03/fairway_created_their_own_version_o.php">the Fairway version</a>. </p>

<p>Nobody needs &quot;suggestions&quot; about how to eat chocolate spread, but that didn&apos;t stop the brand from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501172345/http://www.hersheys.com/spreads/default.cshtml">offering up possibilities</a> that include the customary selections of fruits, breads and pretzels with the more bizarre suggestion to dip celery, potato chips and pickles into the jar. Pregnant ladies are way ahead of you, Hershey&apos;s. </p>
