<p>Diners at Coney Island&apos;s brand new Applebee&apos;s got mozzarella sticks with a side of FACES OF DEATH this weekend at the chain&apos;s grand opening celebration. First, a Blacktip shark named Zane went on a murderous rampage inside the restaurant&apos;s new 5,000-gallon fish tank, devouring three Lookdown fish before he was removed. The same day, another shark died after a run-in with the replica Wonder Wheel inside the tank. Damn those unpredictable swinging cars!</p>

<p>The sharks had just arrived at the restaurant that morning, and Applebee&apos;s owner Zane Tankel&#x2014;yes, he named the fish after himself&#x2014;thinks they weren&apos;t given proper time to adjust to their new home. &#x201C;They went from being in an ocean to being in a tank. They were all disoriented,&quot; he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150912212327/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/death-shark-tank-coney-article-1.1374327?localLinksEnabled=false">explained to the Daily News</a>. Or maybe Zane was just hungry because he&apos;s a <em>shark</em>. </p>

<p>The aquarium still has four other sharks and a multitude of tropical fish, but none quite as bloodthirsty as Zane&#x2014;yet. Without <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150912212327/http://gothamist.com/2010/12/23/shoot_the_freak_abruptly_boarded_up.php">Shoot the Freak</a>, this might be the most exciting reason to visit Coney Island! In response to the hype, Hooters has announced the inclusion of a bear pit to their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150912212327/http://gothamist.com/2012/08/28/hooters_1.php">forthcoming Coney Island outpost</a>.</p>
