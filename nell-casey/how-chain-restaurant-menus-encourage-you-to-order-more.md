<p>Those glossy photos on restaurant menus aren&apos;t just appetite-building food porn&#x2014;they&apos;re also integral in making you order more. In a fascinating piece on the science behind chain restaurant menus, Megan Garber at The Atlantic <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420052608/http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/03/the-engineering-of-the-chain-restaurant-menu/284371/">examines the process</a> behind menu design and how it influences a customer&apos;s order and also a restaurant&apos;s bottom line. With quick service chains like Chipotle leading the market, sit-down chains have reevaluated the focus of their menus, trimming down where necessary and engineering menus that engage consumers in a more efficient way.</p>

<p>One of those brands is IHOP, which began an overhaul of its extensive menu to figure out how to better present their options. &quot;Because the menu&apos;s so long and difficult to navigate, even our most heavy guests were not aware of the breadth of our offering,&quot; explained IHOP head of marketing Natalia Franco. The IHOP team employed multiple methods to test drive different menu designs, including focus groups, in-store food sales data and eye-tracking studies. &quot;As part of those bigger studies,&#x201D; Franco says, &#x201C;we clearly knew that improving and optimizing our menu was priority number one.&quot; Ultimately, they chose a &quot;catalog&quot; style, which relied heavily on food imagery, color coding and a grouping system that organized dishes by food types. </p>

<p>Customers responded and the chain saw a 3.6% increase in sales, thanks in large part to &quot;selection and upsell.&quot; It turns out that the new menus meant guests ordered sides and drinks more than they did before and also were more compelled to try different and &quot;new&quot; menu items. &#x201C;Now guests and consumers are self-identifying products that they think are new,&#x201D; explains Franco. There&apos;s no doubt in her mind: &#x201C;Our guests are ordering additional items because of the appeal of the menu.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Applebee&apos;s and other chains like Joe&apos;s Crab Shack undergo similar menu makeovers that incorporate things like color variations and visual cues about &quot;healthier&quot; dishes. It&apos;s an incredibly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420052608/http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/03/the-engineering-of-the-chain-restaurant-menu/284371/">complex system</a> that&apos;ll leave you feeling a bit manipulated&#x2014;or just resigned to the fact that we&apos;re <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420052608/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/03/ev_ihops_bacon_smell_still_a_proble.php">helpless against subliminal direction</a>.
