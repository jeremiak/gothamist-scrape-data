<p>The pickle masters behind Brooklyn Brine are opening up a new restaurant and bar in Gowanus this summer. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130731072042/http://parkslopestoop.com/blog/news/brooklyn-brine-opening-pickle-shack-at-former-root-hill-burger-location">Park Slope Stoop</a> got the scoop about the new venture, which will open inside recently closed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130731072042/http://www.roothillburger.com/">Root Hill Burger</a> on Fourth Avenue. Brooklyn Brine has been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130731072042/https://twitter.com/BrooklynBrine/status/348485937283624960">tweeting some details</a> about the new restaurant, revealing that they&apos;ll serve fried pickles, &quot;weirdo&quot; pickles, sandwiches and beer brewed exclusively by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130731072042/http://www.dogfish.com/">Dogfish Head</a>.</p>

<p>The brinery and the brewery have been collaborating for about a year, beginning with their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130731072042/https://twitter.com/Homebrewchef/status/348879040159039488">Hop-Pickle</a> that uses Dogfish Head 60 Minute IPA. Now the pair expands on that relationship, using Dogfish Head not just as refreshment, but also using the brews to make additional pickle flavors and condiment infusions. According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130731072042/http://www.grubstreet.com/2013/06/brooklyn-brine-pickle-shack.html">GrubStreet</a>, pickler-chef Shamus Jones will also be &quot;infusing the beer with seasonal and micro-seasonal herbs and fresh hops.&quot;</p>

<p>The large backyard patio won&apos;t go to waste this summer, as Jones plans to set up a bocce ball area and probably some seating as well. There&apos;s not a set opening date yet, but Jones hopes to have the pickle-and-beer juice flowing by mid-July. </p>
