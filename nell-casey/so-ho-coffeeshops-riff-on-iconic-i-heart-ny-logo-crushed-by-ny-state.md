<p>Soho coffee shop <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160219050705/http://everymanespresso.com/">Everyman Espresso</a> is in hot water with New York State for violating federal trademark law with their &quot;confusingly similar&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160219050705/http://www.flickr.com/photos/39908901@N06/7553424104/">I [coffee cup] NY</a> logo. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160219050705/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/30/nyregion/new-york-challenges-a-coffee-shop-logo.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">The <em>Times</em> reports</a> that the state&apos;s Department of Economic Development sent letters to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160219050705/http://gothamist.com/2008/06/05/baristas_lock_h.php">acclaimed coffee shop</a> ordering them to stop their riff on the iconic I &#x2665; NY&#xAE; design. </p>

<p>The logo, which had not only been emblazoned across the exterior windows, also showed up in the shop&apos;s merchandise, none of which can now be sold. Unfortunately, simply removing the logo wasn&apos;t enough for the state, who demanded the pair also supply &#x201C;an accounting of all gross revenues generated during the period when the I &#x2665; NY&#xAE; Trademark was used&#x201D; so the state&apos;s lawyer can set the &quot;appropriate penalty.&quot; </p>

<p>The state has been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160219050705/http://gothamist.com/2008/05/13/new_york_gets_o.php">cracking down on unlicensed use of the logo</a> for years, and even went so far as to sue co-creator Milton Glaser for trademark infringement after he reworked his iconic design post-September 11th. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160219050705/https://twitter.com/EverymanNY">coffee shop&apos;s Twitter feed</a> is filled with support from fans, with some even <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160219050705/https://twitter.com/SoundGuyAndy/status/340094795877859328">offering money</a> to setup a logo legal defense fund. If all else fails, they should just claim they&apos;re <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160219050705/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/31/cuomo_doesnt_heart_new_york_bastard.php">submitting their I &#x2665; NY&#xAE; logo redesign a little late</a>. </p>
