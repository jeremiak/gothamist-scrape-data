<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429062716/http://gothamist.com/tags/mistersoftee">Mister Softee</a> has forgone the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429062716/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/15/mister_softee_truck_yogo_truck_enga.php">street justice</a> route in favor of the legal system, it would seem. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429062716/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/softee_hard_line_with_foes_oLgOJgpkWTyAHfos0sjs3L?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Local">Post reports</a> that the soft serve truck has filed a lawsuit against four rogue ice cream operators who have allegedly co-opted the brand&apos;s signature style without permission. The suit claims the fakers have painted trucks to mimic Mister Softee&apos;s blue and white trim and also use menus &quot;similar&quot; to the iconic brand.</p>

<p>One such soft serve scofflaw is John Argyros, who&#x2014;confusingly&#x2014;has proper licensing as a Mister Softee franchise but does not have permission to use the truck in an official capacity. The Queens-based company claims that customers are being &quot;deceived and confused&quot; by the imitators, who don&apos;t follow Mister Softee&apos;s strict quality control guidelines over their product. Ice cream is ice cream, and for our money we&apos;ll take any truck so long as it doesn&apos;t <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429062716/http://gothamist.com/2009/03/27/mister_softee_truck_jingle_driving.php">sing to us</a>.</p>
