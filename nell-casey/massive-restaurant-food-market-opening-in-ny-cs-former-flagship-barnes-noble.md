<p>Barnes &amp; Noble&apos;s former flagship location at 105 Fifth Avenue <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170324013750/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/07/barnes_noble_flagship_location_has.php">shuttered in 2014</a>, leaving behind a 25,000-square-foot hole that&apos;s finally being filled. Beginning May 13th, an enormous food complex will open its phase one with a cafe and wine bar concept, quickly followed by a bakery on May 19th, a restaurant on June 1st and a food marketplace opening later in June. The sprawling development is called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170324013750/http://www.unionfare.com/">Union Fare</a>. </p>

<p>The cafe and wine bar will open daily at 7 a.m. to serve La Colombe coffees&#x2014;including their proprietary <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170324013750/http://gothamist.com/2015/07/22/la_colombe_draft_lattes.php">draft lattes</a>&#x2014;before transitioning into a wine bar with snacks in the evening. The phase two bakery portion will serve sweet and savory pastries, breakfast sandwiches and cream-filled croissants in flavors like Birthday Cake and Ham &amp; Pepper Jack Cheese by Executive Pastry Chef Thiago Silva. </p>

<p>The entrance to the restaurant will be on 6 East 18th Street and entrance to the bakery and market on 7 East 17th Street; a Banana Republic has the 105 Fifth Avenue storefront.</p>

<p>Silva is joined by Executive Chef Yvan Lemoine for the phase three restaurant, which boasts 185 seats for dinner service. The menu&apos;s American contemporary and there&apos;s also a charcuterie bar offering house-cured meats and local cheese plus a raw seafood bar. There are of course cocktails, wines and ten American craft beers on tap. Finally, the phase four market, for grab-and-go foods. There will also be some &quot;speakeasy-style private event spaces&quot; underneath the restaurant. </p>

<p>The concept shares some of the gene pool with URBO, the now-defunct <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170324013750/http://gothamist.com/2014/07/21/29_million_barstaurant_behemoth_com.php#photo-1">Times Square barstaurant behemoth</a> that offered multiple experiences under one roof. We&apos;ll know more once we get a look inside, which should be in the next week or two.</p>
