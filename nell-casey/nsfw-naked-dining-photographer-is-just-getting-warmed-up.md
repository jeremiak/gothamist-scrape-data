Los Angeles-based photographer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429210935/http://allenhenson.com/">Allen Henson</a> reached out to us yesterday to talk about the reaction to the photo shoot, which he says was completely unexpected. He also revealed that this was just the first in a photo series using nude models in a public setting. Getting naked in public for art? <em><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429210935/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/10/naked_models_take_over_times_square.php#photo-1">Now</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429210935/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/12/gallery.php">we&apos;ve</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429210935/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/23/naked_model_natalie.php">seen</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429210935/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/27/scantily_clad_nyu_co-eds_strip_down.php#photo-1">everything</a>!</em></p>

<p><strong>So how did this all come together?</strong> I&apos;ll say up front that I really had no idea there was a story on this. I woke up this morning and someone was like, &quot;Hey man is this you?&quot; And I was like, &quot;What the hell?&quot; No idea. She&apos;d just come in. It&apos;s this five part series I&apos;m doing and I said, &quot;Hey, I&apos;ve got a great idea. Let&apos;s do something crazy.&quot; So we went and took a walk and found what made sense. We stopped at Odessa first and no one was there, it was kind of empty. And then we ended up at a sushi restaurant and everyone was super excited like, &quot;Oh this is fun!&quot; The management was plugged in, the patrons were having a good time. It was a really fun attitude, very like the neighborhood. Novelty, artistic. And it came out really cool. We tried it again and obviously it didn&apos;t work out too well. [laughs]</p>

<p><strong>You said you didn&apos;t plan this, but have you done this kind of impromptu naked photography before?</strong> Every now and then I&apos;ll embrace spontaneity and if something makes sense we&apos;ll be like okay let&apos;s do this. I was sitting there and I&apos;m like, <strong>&quot;Oh my God. Look at all these people. Look at this very unorthodox location. Hey, take your clothes off. This is going to be wild.&quot;</strong> We started snapping pictures. Then the second place, that was all of seven seconds. As soon as her shirt came off, by the last frame I took it was a picture of the manager&apos;s hand in front of the camera. Which is actually a great image that you couldn&apos;t replicate if you tried. It&apos;s so funny how much can happen in seven seconds. </p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="071113topless2.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429210935im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_nellcasey/071113topless2.jpg" width="640" height="427"> <br> <i> <span class="photo_caption">(Allen Henson)</span></i></div> <p></p>

<p><strong>Did they explain why they wanted you to leave?</strong> Yeah, and I totally get it. We&apos;re not disillusioned or taken aback that we couldn&apos;t shoot. It&apos;s private property, they own this company, they pay rent. I get it. It&apos;s not consistent with their branding and they&apos;re like, &quot;Oh great, naked people. Get out of here.&quot; So I get that. I know legally women can walk around topless, that&apos;s the law. But private property&#x2026;I get that, it makes sense. </p>

<p>[The manager] said the words Family Restaurant and then after the fact, after reading one of these articles, I didn&apos;t realize that oh, wow, roll of the dice. A couple of times we happened to get naked in public and there&apos;s a whole table of Jehovah&apos;s Witnesses behind us. Awkward! What are the odds? So I get it, I see how that would be a precarious situation.</p>

<p>This is a five part series and this is only the first day and this all occurred. If this is day one, they&apos;re going to have helicopters out by day five! It&apos;ll be nuts! It&apos;s nothing special, it&apos;s kind of cliched. But it&apos;s that juxtaposition of nudity in very uncommon situations. Obviously you don&apos;t go to a restaurant, sit down next to someone naked and say, &quot;Oh what are you having?&quot;</p>

<p><strong>What was the reaction of the diners at the sushi place? Were they weirded out or going with it?</strong> What you normally expect, everyone pulled out the cell phones and started taking pictures.&quot;Yeah, this was awesome!&quot; Everyone was pretty plugged in. The management&#x2026;when they first walked over I&apos;m like, &quot;Oh, here we go, we&apos;re screwed.&quot; But they actually looked at the back of my camera and were like, &quot;Oh that&apos;s pretty neat!&quot; They were totally just like, &quot;Yeah, that&apos;s cool, let&apos;s do this.&quot;</p>
