</div></div><p>Astoria is now home to another beer garden-type establishment now that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120514145732/http://maxbratwurst.com/">Max Bratwurst und Bier</a> has opened. The restaurant began serving authentic, German style comfort foods and beers at the end of April in a cozy, brick-walled space on 30th Avenue. The dining area is simple but inviting, with large communal tables and a few vintage posters adorning the walls. While there is no actual garden, the large, windowed doors can be flung wide open, affording views of the neighborhood and allowing the requisite warm, summer breezes to blow through. (Remember those?)</p>

<p>The food options are plentiful, especially the housemade wursts, which fall under one of three varieties: Max Line, Gourmet Line and Exotic line. You&apos;ll find familiar offerings in the first two categories where there are an assortment of bratwurst made with all different kinds of meats and some stuffed with cheese and hot peppers. The Exotic line is where things really get interesting, however, where you&apos;ll find sausages made with rabbit, alligator and the aforementioned rattlesnake! Exciting news for daring diners no longer fazed by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120514145732/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/05/duck_fetus_brunch_anyone.php">munching on a little balut</a>. The menu rounds out with other traditional eats and the customary assortment of schnitzels, pretzels and spaetzles. </p>

<p>You can&apos;t talk about Germany without talking about beer, and Max does not disappoint in that department. All the mainstays are accounted for like Spaten, Hofbrau and Radeberger with a smattering of lesser known German specialty brews, most ranging between $5 and $8. Kegs are also available if you have a big group (or a big thirst) and you can choose from Kapuziner Weisse, Einbecker Pilsner or Reissendorf Koelsch for $50. </p>
