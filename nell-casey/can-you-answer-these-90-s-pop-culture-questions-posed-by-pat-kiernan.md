<p>New York&apos;s favorite news anchor (and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507073600/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/18/pat_kiernan_is_returning_to_co-host.php"><em>LIVE! with Kelly</em> guest-host</a>) Pat Kiernan took to the Bell House stage last night for a night of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507073600/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/19/pat_kiernan_1.php">90s themed trivia</a>&#x2014;he&apos;s been hosting these always sold-out trivia nights for months now, and you can expect more 90s nights in the future. Kiernan had joined forces with sponsor TrivWorks in three previous events&#x2014;one of them benefiting VH1&apos;s <em>Save The Music</em> campaign&#x2014;before an audience poll selected the evening&apos;s 90s theme. For his grand entrance last night, he sauntered in to the tune of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507073600/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/19/pat_kiernan_1.php">his favorite 90&apos;s hit</a>, &quot;I Want It That Way,&quot; dressed in casual attire and adorned with his very own Britney Spears mic. </p>

<p>Nearly 300 competitors crowded in to take on Kiernan&apos;s challenge for 90s dominance but only one team left victorious&#x2014;&quot;A Tribe Called Queens&quot; won in a sudden death matchup by correctly identifying the movie where Shaquille O&apos;Neal played a genie. Surprisingly, that was one of the easiest questions of the night! Seriously, if you weren&apos;t completely coherent in the 90s&#x2014;say, heavily under the influence of grunge&#x2014;this trivia will leave you in the dust. Competitors get two minutes to complete each round&#x2014;we collected a few questions so you could test your mettle against Pat&apos;s pernicious polls. TWO MINUTES ON THE CLOCK, GO! (And no cheating... Father Canada is watching.): <br>

</li><li>In the famous attack on ice skater Nancy Kerrigan, orchestrated by Tanya Harding, what was the name of Tanya&apos;s husband who carried out the beating?<br>
