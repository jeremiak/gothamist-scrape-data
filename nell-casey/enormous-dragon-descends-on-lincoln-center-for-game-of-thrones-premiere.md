										<p>We&apos;ve got less than a month to go until <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428172340/http://gothamist.com/tags/gameofthrones"><em>Game of Thrones</em></a> returns for its fourth season on April 6th but HBO is pumping up fans of the fantasy series with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428172340/http://gothamist.com/2014/03/05/you_can_see_game_of_thrones_season.php">several fan events</a>, including a big premiere bash at Lincoln Center this evening. And oh hell yes they&apos;ve brought a big, scaly, fire-breathing friend along to mark the occasion.</p>

<p>Crews were busy constructing a huge, bad-ass dragon replica on the institution&apos;s famed plaza this afternoon. By all accounts this appears to be Daenerys Targaryen&apos;s largest dragon, Drogon, who made a name for himself by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428172340/http://giphy.com/gifs/ESgYN7LGXgIO4">burning the crap out of a wicked slave master</a> last season. </p>

<p>Some of the show&apos;s <em>other</em> stars&#x2014;including Peter Dinklage, Sophie Turner, Jack Gleeson, Lena Heady and others&#x2014;will be on the red carpet for tonight&apos;s big premiere event but OMG SORRY DRAGON AHHHH!!!!</p>
