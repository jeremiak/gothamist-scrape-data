					<p>It&apos;s usually not until the annual <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170615214759/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/04/slice_out_hunger_2016.php">Slice Out Hunger</a> event that New Yorkers are treated to many excellent pizzas from around the city under one roof, but starting next week there&apos;s a mini version going down in NoHo.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170615214759/http://vicsnewyork.com/">Vic&apos;s</a> on Great Jones Street begins a series of love letter-type collaborations between chef Hillary Sterling and some titans of NYC pizza. The likes of Dom De Marco of Di Fara&apos;s fame, Paul Giannone of Paulie Gee&apos;s, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170615214759/http://gothamist.com/2014/08/21/bar_pies_adam_kuban.php">pizza expert</a> Adam Kuban and his pop-up Margot&apos;s, and Bobby Hellen of GG&apos;s have all contributed signature pizzas that Sterling and her team will execute at Vic&apos;s for the month of June.</p>

<p>In addition to some fantastic pies, there&apos;s a wonderful charitable angle as well. A portion of the pizza sales will benefit <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170615214759/https://www.nokidhungry.org/">Share Our Strength&apos;s No Kid Hungry</a> initiative, which is dedicated to ending child hunger in the United States. Pies are priced between $18 and $22; see below for the descriptions and tenures of each pizza. </p>

<ul>
	<li>Bobby Hellen of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170615214759/https://www.ggsnyc.com/#hometest">GG&apos;s</a> (May 30th through June 6th): Square Vodka Pie with prosciutto, peas, sun-dried tomatoes and basil</li>
	<li>Domenico De Marco of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170615214759/http://www.difarany.com/">Di Fara</a> (June 7th through June 12th):  Classic Round Pie with San Marzano tomatoes, whole milk mozzarella, Parmesan, and fresh basil</li>
	<li>Paulie Giannone of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170615214759/http://pauliegee.com/">Paulie Gee&apos;s</a> (June 13th through June 19th): Monte Cristo Pizza with mild Gouda, thinly sliced Canadian bacon and a drizzle of pure maple syrup</li>
	<li>Adam Kuban of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170615214759/http://margotspizza.com/">Margot&apos;s Pizza</a> (June 20th through June 26th): Margot&apos;s Ranchero Pizza, a nacho-inspired pizza with extra cheese, pickled jalape&#xF1;os and a buttermilk ranch dressing</li>
