<p>With one <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170616075014/http://gothamist.com/tags/majorfoodgroup">flashy opening</a> after the next, the restaurateurs behind the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170616075014/http://www.majorfood.com/">Major Food Group</a> continue to redefine over-the-top, an ethos on full display at their latest The Grill, which opened inside the storied Four Seasons space on Thursday. The tableware was &quot;inspired by JFK-era White House place settings,&quot; food runners are dressed in tuxedos, food is flamb&#xE9;ed table-side, and the $62 spit roasted prime rib is delivered by a trolley. The celebrities are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170616075014/https://www.instagram.com/p/BTsDQNOB12u/?taken-by=mikejchau">already flocking</a>.</p>

<p>Chef Mario Carbone&apos;s menu revives the mid-century chophouse&#x2014;&quot;We&apos;re proud to say this menu&apos;s a throwback,&quot; Carbone says&#x2014;with steaks, that prime rib, Lobster a la Newberg (MP) and three different Dover Sole preparations, ranging in price from $67 to $72. A team of four from Eater <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170616075014/https://ny.eater.com/2017/5/5/15554006/the-grill-nyc-four-seasons-first-night-menu-prices">ran up a $717.49 bill</a> on opening night...<em>before</em> gratuity. Check out the menu with prices in that previous link.</p>

<p>The Grill is round one of the team&apos;s plans for the landmarked space&#x2014;they had to be very strategic about the changes they could make given that designation. This summer they&apos;ll open The Pool with a menu focusing on fish and seafood and probably a lot more pomp and circumstance. </p>
