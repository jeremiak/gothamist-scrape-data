<p>Remember Bamn!, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170917080633/http://gothamist.com/2006/08/29/a_taste_of_bamn.php">automated eatery</a> that sold grilled cheese sandwiches, burgers and donuts on St. Mark&apos;s Place a decade ago? It tried to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170917080633/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/24/nypl_lunch_hour_nyc.php">reignite the auto-mat craze</a> of yesteryear, albeit unsuccessfully outside of those <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170917080633/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/02/24-hour_cupcake_atm_machines_coming.php">cupcake vending machines</a>. Now a West Coast transplant is hoping to do the same&#x2014;only this time, with quinoa.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170917080633/http://www.eatsa.com/">Eatsa</a> debuted in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170917080633/http://sfist.com/2016/03/15/eatsa-second-location-california-street.php">San Francisco</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170917080633/http://laist.com/2015/11/12/eatsa.php">Los Angeles</a> last year, upgrading the nickel-in-slot formula by employing iPads for ordering. Patrons order their quinoa bowls through iPads on-site or through their phones, then wait for their names to be displayed on the cubbyhole containing their order. Take a look at the process <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170917080633/https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=119&amp;v=7d7dhJQBaf0">here</a>.</p>

<p>The menu for the first NYC location&#x2014;which&apos;ll be arriving at 285 Madison Avenue, between 40th and 41st Street, sometime this fall&#x2014;hasn&apos;t been revealed, but a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170917080633/https://www.eatsa.com/menu">San Francisco sample</a> includes things like the Cantina Kale Salad, a Spice Market Bowl with yams and saag paneer, and a Chili con Quinoa. Ingredients, nutrition facts and serving style are all listed prior to ordering. The West Coast bowls are all priced under $7. </p>

<p>With the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170917080633/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/10/how_to_power_bowl_in_nyc.php">power bowl trend</a> in full force, could the robot restaurateur be the next big thing? The restaurant <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170917080633/http://laist.com/2015/11/12/eatsa.php">debuted to huge lines</a> in LA and New Yorkers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170917080633/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/03/the_longest_ever_cronut_line_in_the.php">love to queue</a>. </p>
