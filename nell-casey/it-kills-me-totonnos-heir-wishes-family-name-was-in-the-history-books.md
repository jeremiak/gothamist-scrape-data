<p>As an addendum to a recent episode of Vice/Munchies&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170313014921/https://munchies.vice.com/en/show/the-pizza-show">The Pizza Show</a>, Antoinette Balzano&#x2014;granddaughter of Anthony &quot;Totonno&quot; Pero (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170313014921/http://www.totonnosconeyisland.com/">that Totonno</a>)&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170313014921/https://munchies.vice.com/en/articles/the-untold-story-of-how-my-grandfather-brought-pizza-to-america">tells her grandfather&apos;s story and importance</a> in NYC&apos;s pizza story in her own words.  </p>

<p>As she explains it, her grandfather emigrated to the United States from Naples as a young man, where he approached Gennaro Lombardi about upgrading his grocery business into a pizzeria. As you might have guessed, Lombardi agreed, and Lombardi&apos;s became the first pizzeria in America in the early 1900s. </p>

<p>But Balzano wishes her grandfather&#x2014;who left Lombardi&apos;s to open Totonno&apos;s on Coney island in 1924&#x2014;got more of the credit he deserves.</p>

<p>&quot;Since I was a little girl I learned that he brought pizza to America. I&apos;m 65-years-old and I&apos;ve known that since I could comprehend the English language,&quot; she recalls. &quot;[Totonno&apos;s has] been there 92 years, and I say that we are the oldest pizzeria continuously run by the same family, because (the original) Lombardi&apos;s closed; they sold it.&quot;</p>

<p>While Balzano doesn&apos;t critique the Lombardi&apos;s, calling them a &quot;wonderful family,&quot; she firmly believes it&apos;s her grandfather who deserves his name in history alongside the pizzeria.</p>

<blockquote>It kills me&#x2014;you could take a knife and rip my heart out that&apos;s how much that kills me&#x2014;when you think of him coming over on that boat, in the steerage, probably people vomiting all over him down there, leaving his family behind, and 92 years later we&apos;re talking about Mozart and Socrates, and Totonno&apos;s gets no credit. That&apos;s a disgrace.</blockquote>
