<p>If your schedule allows for a leisurely lunch during the week, Michael White&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171015144720/http://www.osteriamorini.com/about_us">Osteria Morini</a> has a new midday menu of Italian salads, sandwiches and pastas on offer. On the menu: the Panini Petroniana ($20, pictured above) with a veal cutlet, prosciutto, parmigiano and truffle cream spinach; and a Cacio e Pepe salad ($14/22) with romaine, garlic breadcrumbs and a parmigiano anchovy vinaigrette. The crown jewel of lunch is the White Label Burger ($22), an 8-ounce LaFrieda patty topped with speck, tomato crema, taleggio cheese and parmigiano onion rings.</p>

<p>If you&apos;re buying into Hallmark&apos;s cash grab on Tuesday, at least make your money matter a bit more with a meal that benefits the ACLU. Williamsburg&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171015144720/http://www.sundayinbrooklyn.com/">Sunday In Brooklyn</a> is offering a Valentine&apos;s Day menu of four courses for $75, with 10% of the profits going to the ACLU. Begin with a snack like Deviled Eggs with smoked paprika; move on to an appetizer of Shaved Purple Carrots with uni vinaigrette, preserved pepper and nasturtium; and choose one of three entrees including a Minute Steak with winter greens and charred red onions, plus a choice of dessert. </p>

<p>In a similar vein, several notable chefs/restaurants will be cooking for Food Not Fear, a fundraiser for the Urban Justice Center&apos;s International Refugee Assistance Project on Wednesday. Chefs from Egg Restaurant, Franny&apos;s, La Vara, Oxalis, Delaware &amp; Hudson and White Gold Butchers will be participating, preparing canapes (along with beverages) for attendees. The event runs from 8 p.m. to 11 p.m.; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171015144720/https://www.eventbrite.com/e/food-not-fear-a-fundraiser-for-the-international-refugee-assistance-project-tickets-31760606830?aff=eac2">tickets $75</a> with 100% of the profits going to the IRAP. </p>
