Regardless of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150530225626/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/10/quick_poll_how_do_you_eat_your_pizz.php">where you fall</a> on #forkgate, we can all agree that there are some techniques that are beyond the beyond when it comes to ingesting slices. </p>

<p>In the most recent episode of his Cooking Channel series titled, appropriately, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150530225626/http://www.cookingchanneltv.com/shows/youre-eating-it-wrong/you-re-eating-it-wrong.html"><em>You&apos;re Eating It Wrong</em></a>, Dan Pashman travels to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150530225626/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/20/the_ultimate_pizza_debate_grima.php">Gothamist favorite</a> Juliana&apos;s to query legendary pizzaiolo Patsy Grimaldi about some dubious techniques.
