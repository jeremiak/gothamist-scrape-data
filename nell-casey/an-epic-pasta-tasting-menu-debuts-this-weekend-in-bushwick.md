<p>Bushwick&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160904050835/http://gothamist.com/2015/09/24/michelin_bib_gourmand_nyc_2015.php">Bib Gourmand-recommended</a> eatery <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160904050835/http://www.farobk.com/">Faro</a> has put house-made pasta front and center since <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160904050835/http://gothamist.com/2015/05/06/faro_homemade_pasta_bushwick.php">opening last year</a> and now it&apos;s the subject of a <strong>new pasta-centric tasting menu</strong> on Friday and Saturday nights. Chef Kevin Adey&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160904050835/http://gothamist.com/2015/06/15/bushwick_faro_grains.php#photo-1">house-milled pastas</a> will be served as part of an eight-course menu ($85) at the restaurant&apos;s six-seat bar space, where diners will eat two starters, five pastas and a dessert. Adey&apos;s focusing on lesser-known shapes and dishes might include Tajarin egg-style noodles with uni, egg and chilies or Spinach Farfalle with artichoke cream. The single seating begins at 8 p.m. on each night; call the restaurant (718-381-8201) to reserve a seat.</p>

<p>Dip your toes into cocktail culture with <strong>complimentary cocktail tastings</strong> at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160904050835/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/03/the_regal_williamsburg.php">Williamsburg&apos;s nice new</a> barstaurant <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160904050835/http://www.theregal.nyc/">The Regal</a>. Nightly (excluding Mondays), they&apos;ll offer half portions of three cocktails from the menu, changing the lineup each evening. They&apos;re particularly proud of their barrel-aged spirits, which appear in cocktails like the Powder Keg, with barrel-aged rye, cinnamon clove syrup, apple cider and lemon.</p>
