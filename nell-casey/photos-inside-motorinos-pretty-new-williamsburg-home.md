</div></div>					<p>It&apos;s been almost two years since the Williamsburg outpost of Neopolitan pizza mecca <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151031133958/http://www.motorinopizza.com/williamsburg/index.php?action=page&amp;id=1871&amp;location_id=26">Motorino</a> was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151031133958/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/01/leaning_tower_of_motorino_shuttered.php">forced to close</a> due to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151031133958/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/15/motorino_williamsburg_the_leaning_t.php#photo-3">structural problems</a> with the building. At the time, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151031133958/http://gothamist.com/2009/10/02/mathieu_palombino_chef.php">Chef Mathieu Palombino</a> vowed to reopen, and though he&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151031133958/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/07/photos_summit_bar_owner_opens_seafo.php#photo-1">been busy</a> with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151031133958/http://gothamist.com/2010/12/07/more_from_cb3_a_motorino_steakhouse.php">other projects</a>, he&apos;s made good on his word. The pizza joint has relocated to a different section of Williamsburg and will officially reopen tomorrow evening on a section of Broadway between Driggs and Bedford. </p>

<p>The new space shares the same casual yet refined feeling as its predecessor and bears the hallmarks of the neighborhood: exposed brick, reclaimed hard pine floors, a pressed tin ceiling, and industrial-looking light fixtures. The focal point of the open kitchen at the rear is the Neopolitan pizza oven, decorated in sleek tiles that spell out the restaurant&apos;s name. A small bar offers seating for eight and there are lots of granite-topped tables, too, but if this outing is anything like before, expect a bit of wait during prime dining hours. Luckily, a small pedestrian plaza out front offers a place to hang out during the gentler seasons. </p>

<p>On the menu are a few special, Brooklyn-specific pies, including the Melanzane with fior di latte, roasted eggplant, tomato sauce, mint and pecorino and a Portobella Mushroom option. Returning from the first Brooklyn incarnation is the standout Pugliese topped with straciatella, broccolini, spicy sausage, garlic, chili flakes and pecornio. </p>

<p>Besides the pizza, an olive oil-fried macaroni cake called a Frittatina with provolone and prosciutto and a Farro Salad with roasted vegetables make for good appetizers. Roasted porchetta comes baked inside a crunchy, charred Calzone with pecorino and drizzled with lots of fruity extra virgin olive oil. Regional Italian wines, house-made cocktails and a selection of local and Italian wines comprise the drink list. </p>

<p><em>139 Broadway // 718-599-8899 // Open Sunday - Thursday from 11:30 a.m. - 12 a.m.; Friday and Saturday from 11:30 a.m. - 1 a.m.</em></p>
