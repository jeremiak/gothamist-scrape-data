<p>It&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509165023/http://gothamist.com/2010/11/15/deltas_jfk_terminal_gets_upscale_ip.php#photo-1">been a long time coming</a> for Delta&apos;s Terminal 2 at JFK to finally complete its makeover, and today the company announced the roll out has officially begun. Seven new food and drinks populate the old terminal, including options from world class chefs Andrew Carmellini (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509165023/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/19/inside_lafayette.php#photo-1">Lafayette</a>), Laurent Tourondel (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509165023/http://gothamist.com/2012/11/19/arlington_club_american_steakhouse.php#photo-1">Arlington Club</a>), Ceasare Casella (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509165023/http://gothamist.com/2012/09/17/salumeria_rosi_opens_second_locatio.php">Salumeria Rosi</a>) and Morimoto&apos;s Robby Cook.</p>

<p>Chef Carmellini brings French cafe fare at his Croque Madame, serving sandwiches, tartines and crepes, while Chef Casella offers traditional Italian cuisine with an emphasis on salumi and cheese and his Due Amici. Modern Japanese cuisine includes sushi, maki and small plates from Chef Cook at a spot called Shiso. Finally&#x2014;ignoring the fact that the airport is in <em>Queens</em>&#x2014;Chef Tourondel presents BRKLYN Beer Garden, with 20 beers on tap and a &quot;cutting-edge&quot; menu to match. </p>

<p>Temporary versions of each spot opened today with full-scale roll out due sometime next summer. These new offerings join the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509165023/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/06/shake_shack_and_more_opening_this_s.php">smorgasbord in Terminal 4</a>, which boasts offerings from other top restauranteurs Danny Meyer and Marcus Samuelsson. In lieu of securing the impossible reservation at their flagship restaurants, travelers can order food and drinks via iPads while they await their flight. </p>
