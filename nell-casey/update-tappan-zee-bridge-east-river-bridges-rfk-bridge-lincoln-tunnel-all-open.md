<p><strong>[UPDATES BELOW]</strong> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150929134048/http://gothamist.com/tags/hurricanesandy">Sandy</a>&apos;s gale force winds and powerful storm surge <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150929134048/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/29/cuomo_orders_shutdown_of_7_bridges.php">shut down city bridges tunnels yesterday</a>, but now Governor Cuomo is starting to open access points again, beginning with the Tappan Zee Bridge. As of 9 a.m., motorists were allowed to cross the roadway, which spans the Hudson river from Nyack to Terrytown just north of the city.</p>

<p>Per Governor Cuomo&apos;s statement: </p><blockquote>Motorists are reminded to drive carefully. Local roads in Westchester and Rockland may be closed due to flooding or blockage from storm debris. With extensive recovery efforts underway, the Governor advises against any unnecessary travel, which will enable repair crews to move quickly to the areas requiring immediate attention.</blockquote><p></p>

<p><strong>[UPDATE]</strong> As of 10:30 a.m, the East River bridges and the RFK Bridge have reopened.
