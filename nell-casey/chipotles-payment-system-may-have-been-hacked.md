<p>Chipotle says it has &quot;detected unauthorized activity&quot; on the system that processes payments, which could mean that customer data has been exposed to hackers. All of this after over a year of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170427030806/http://gothamist.com/2016/09/10/chipotles_spent_the_past_6_months_s.php">dealing with a food safety crisis</a>...(and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170427030806/http://gothamist.com/2016/07/05/chipotle_cocaine_blues.php">that whole cocaine thing</a>). We now take you live to Chipotle&apos;s board room:</p>

<p>The company <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170427030806/http://chipotle.com/security">released a statement</a> in response to the possible data breach, indicating the &quot;security incident&quot; happened between March 24, 2017 through April 18, 2017. &quot;We immediately began an investigation with the help of leading cyber security firms, law enforcement, and our payment processor,&quot; the statement says. &quot;We believe actions we have taken have stopped the unauthorized activity, and we have implemented additional security enhancements.&quot;</p>

<p>Coincidentally, things were looking better for the burrito chain as of yesterday evening, when earnings reports released by the chain showed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170427030806/https://www.forbes.com/sites/maggiemcgrath/2017/04/25/chipotle-stock-spikes-more-than-6-after-q1-earnings-beat-expectations-and-same-store-sales-return-to-growth/#1e4279e932df">better than expected</a> growth following the last couple of years of turbulence&#x2014;though that may depend on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170427030806/http://www.cnbc.com/2017/04/26/despite-chipotles-post-earnings-rally-recovery-is-still-anemic.html">whom you ask</a>. </p>

<p>If you rode the extra guac train during the affected dates, Chipotle recommends that you scrutinize your payment card statements for any unauthorized charges. They&apos;ll also be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170427030806/http://chipotle.com/security">posting updates</a> with new information about the breach. </p>
