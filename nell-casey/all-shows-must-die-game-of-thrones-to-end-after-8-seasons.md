<p><em><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110093837/http://gothamist.com/tags/gameofthrones">Game of Thrones</a></em> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110093837/http://gothamist.com/2016/05/25/video_hodor_game_of_thrones_kimmel.php">really loves death</a>, so much so that they&apos;re killing their own show after Season 8&#x2014;even if HBO wants more, more, more. HBO programming chief Casey Bloys <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110093837/http://variety.com/2016/tv/news/game-of-thrones-eighth-season-ending-1201827129/">announced the end of the show</a> at the Television Critics Association press tour, confirming the rumored wishes of showrunners David Benioff and Dan Weiss to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110093837/http://time.com/4431962/game-of-thrones-seasons-end/?xid=time_socialflow_twitter">end after two more seasons</a>. </p>

<p>&quot;Yes, they have a very specific plan about the number of seasons they want to do,&quot; Bloys said when <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110093837/http://www.ew.com/article/2016/07/30/game-thrones">asked by Entertainment Weekly</a> if Season 8 would be the last. &quot;Believe me, as the new [programming executive] coming in, if I could get them to do more. I would take 10 more seasons. But we take their lead on what they think they can do the best version of the show.&quot; </p>

<p>Season 7, which has been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110093837/http://www.eonline.com/news/778135/game-of-thrones-season-7-delayed-find-out-why-the-wait-will-be-even-longer-than-usual">delayed to get better &quot;winter&quot; weather</a>, has been rumored to be abbreviated to seven episodes, down from the usual 10. &quot;It&apos;s two more seasons we&apos;re talking about. From pretty close to the beginning, we talked about doing this in 70-75 hours, and that&apos;s what we&apos;ll end up with,&quot; Benioff <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110093837/http://deadline.com/2016/06/game-of-thrones-season-6-finale-david-benioff-d-b-weiss-hbo-1201780242/">told Deadline</a>. &quot;Call it 73 for now.&quot; That means about 15 more episodes split over the next two seasons. Bloys declined to say how many episodes would comprise the final season.</p>

<p>Will 15 more hours be enough to wrap up the dozens of plot lines laid out by <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> author George R. R. Martin? The final episode from last season <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110093837/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/27/game_of_thrones_power_rankings_the_10.php">helped streamline things a bit</a>, but there are still a few holes that need filling, like have Gendry&apos;s arms <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110093837/https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=7&amp;v=qKr8m2jMH4g">fallen off yet</a>. Or will Robert Arryn fulfill his dream of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110093837/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_FDEj4paHI">throwing someone out the moon door</a>? And will we get the Bronn/The Hound buddy adventure spinoff we deserve?</p>

<p>&quot;We&apos;ve talked about it,&quot; Bloys said of a possible spinoff or sequel. &quot;It&apos;s something I&apos;m not opposed to, but of course it has to make sense creatively. I&apos;m not sure that [Benioff and Weiss] could really wrap their heads around it when they&apos;re just about to start production [on season 7]. It&apos;s a pretty intense production, they&apos;re about to start production soon. I&apos;m open to it. The guys weren&apos;t opposed to it, but there&apos;s no concrete plans for it at this point.&quot;</p>

<p>We&apos;d watch a series following Tyrion as he eats and drinks his way Anthony Bourdain-style through every major wine region in the Seven Kingdoms and across the Narrow Sea. Just saying.</p>
