<p>It&apos;s become the running &quot;joke&quot; that all NYC institutions are turning into banks; it&apos;s sad because it&apos;s all too often true. The latest piece of history being <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021120222/https://www.facebook.com/statenislandadvance/photos/a.10151073893361746.427003.98813966745/10153728826751746/?type=3&amp;theater">transformed</a> into an ATM vestibule is Staten Island&apos;s beloved Schaffer&apos;s Tavern, a restaurant and bar that&apos;s resided on the borough&apos;s Victory Boulevard for 83 years. Now, the parcel will be turned into a Victory State Bank.</p>

<p>There have been rumors for over a year that the beloved eatery would close, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021120222/http://www.silive.com/dining/index.ssf/2016/09/schaffers_tavern_historic_staten_island_restaurant_is_closing.html">SI Live reports</a>, but construction on the sixth Staten Island branch of the bank will begin sometime in early 2017. There&apos;s no official closing date for Schaffer&apos;s yet.</p>

<p>Locals know the joint for its prized corned beef sandwiches and as a spot to sip on mugs of German beer. The tavern has that old school charm which many try to replicate (and few succeed). A fire <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021120222/http://www.silive.com/entertainment/dining/index.ssf/2013/09/a_bavarian_birthday_on_staten.html">destroyed the back bar</a> some years ago, but the space still looked time out of mind; the backs of the bar stools are even <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021120222/https://www.facebook.com/SchaffersTavernInc/photos/a.340799015994253.79596.319209401486548/489941944413292/?type=3&amp;theater">emblazoned</a> with the names of longtime regulars and staff. </p>

<p>Just down the road is one of the borough&apos;s other mainstays, Joe &amp; Pats, in the Westerleigh neighborhood. Until it closes, Schaffer&apos;s is recognized as the longest-running, family-owned restaurant on Staten Island.</p>
