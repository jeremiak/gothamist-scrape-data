title: Where To Eat The City's Best Hamentashen In Celebration Of Purim
---

	
										<p>Holidays that encourage <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170307101409/http://gothamist.com/2014/03/16/purim.php">drinking and eating cookies</a> come around but a few times a year and for the many partaking in Purim this year, that time is nigh! </p>

<p>The Jewish holiday celebrates the victory of the Jewish people over a sinister plot by Haman, an advisor to King Ahasuerus who wanted to murder all the Jews in Persia. Together with her uncle Mordecai, Queen Esther foiled Haman&apos;s scheme, so Jews around the world will drink, eat and party in their honor. </p>

<p>Whether you&apos;re a person of Jewish faith or not, indulging in the holiday&apos;s signature cookie, hamentashen, knows no religious boundaries. Many bakeries offer the cookies year-round, while others save their poppy seeds just for the month of March. Below, a few places to stock up on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170307101409/http://www.chabad.org/holidays/purim/article_cdo/aid/2872815/jewish/The-History-and-Meaning-of-Hamantaschen.htm">Haman&apos;s hat</a> in NYC.</p>

<p>This year, all three locations of <strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170307101409/https://www.breadsbakery.com/">Breads Bakery</a></strong> offer the less common savory hamentashen in two flavors: Roasted Beets and Potato with caramelized onion, both studded with sesame seeds to differentiate them from their sweet counterparts. They&apos;ll have traditional sweet flavors as well, including poppy, apple, prune and chocolate. Cookies are priced at two for $4, six for $10 and 12 for $18 and they&apos;re available now through the end of March. <em><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170307101409/https://www.breadsbakery.com/">Multiple Locations</a></em></p>
