<p>Celebrity chef Mario Batali knows a lot about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160708094533/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/15/cooking_with_ramps_pasta_cornbread.php">pasta</a>, questionable footwear choices and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160708094533/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/10/neighbors_angry_that_popular_mario.php">rich people</a>, but he should leave the edibles to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160708094533/https://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/snoop.gif?w=650">experts</a>. The Crocs enthusiast has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160708094533/http://food52.com/recipes/40537-mario-batali-s-double-chocolate-pot-brownies?utm_source=cj&amp;affil=cj&amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_campaign=Food52+Outdoor+Goods+Page">published a pot brownie recipe</a> via Food52 in &quot;honor&quot; of the Superbowl-bound Broncos and the pot-friendly city of Denver. When eating Mario Batali&apos;s Double-Chocolate Pot Brownies, the chef advises to &quot;[hang] with cool people&quot; and &quot;don&apos;t do anything stupid,&quot; which should start with not following this bullshit recipe.</p>

<p>Batali&apos;s brownie base looks fine and surely if one were omitting the marijuana, it would be a satisfactory, if simple, batch of brownies. But Batali&apos;s suggestions for the marijuana portion of the recipe makes several missteps, ones that don&apos;t just mishandle the marijuana&#x2014;they&apos;ll make the brownies themselves taste like shit. For one, Batali advises grinding up the marijuana and simmering&#x2014;briefly, we&apos;ll get to that&#x2014;in butter but doesn&apos;t include a step for removing the plant itself. Rookie mistake, chef!</p>

<p>Several commenters on the recipe have called him out on what will undoubtably result in a nearly inedible&#x2014;or at the very least, power pot flavored&#x2014;brownie, with a fibrous and chalky texture. What&apos;s the point of going out of your way to bake something delicious if you can&apos;t even enjoy it?</p>

<p>Then there&apos;s the matter of the marijuana &quot;cooking&quot; process, where the chef employs the common method of simmering the weed in butter. Fine, but his suggestion to only cook the pot &quot;until the butter is just melted&quot; probably won&apos;t be long enough to suck the THC out of the plant itself. Typically, recipes for cannabutter call for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160708094533/http://www.thestonerscookbook.com/recipes/quick-easy-cannabutter/">at least 45 minutes</a>&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160708094533/http://www.thestonerscookbook.com/recipes/cannabutter/">if not five hours</a>!&#x2014;to fully infuse the butter with all the Good Stuff. Guess that&apos;s why he&apos;s leaving all the leaves and stems in the brownie batter!</p>

<p>Finally, maybe I&apos;m just old school (or cheap), but isn&apos;t kinda crappy&#x2014;or at least nothing insanely strong&#x2014;weed the best for edibles? When ingesting pot, the reaction is typically stronger than smoking something of the same quality, meaning a &quot;high quality&quot; pot is more-or-less wasted (or dangerous!) in a cooking application. Not to mention, four grams is a LOT of pot for one batch of brownies! Hopefully Mario&apos;s Superbowl party comes with a padded room.</p>
