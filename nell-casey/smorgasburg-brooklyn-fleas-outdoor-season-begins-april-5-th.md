<p>Proof positive that we shall soon <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509140829/http://gothamist.com/2014/02/18/more_snow_kill_them_all.php">vanquish winter</a>: the return of Smorgasburg and Brooklyn Flea&apos;s outdoor iterations. The duo <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509140829/http://gothamist.com/2013/12/01/photos_inside_the_new_indoor_smorga.php#photo-1">stayed cozy</a> this winter inside a massive warehouse space but now it&apos;s time to throw open the loading docks and let the vendors back into the sunshine. Beginning next Saturday, April 5th, Smorgasburg returns to its rightful place in East River State Park along the waterfront; on Sundays, the roving food fest reoccupies Pier 5 in Brooklyn Bridge Park. Huzzah!</p>

<p>Like the rest of us, Smorgasburg grew a little bit over the winter, and will welcome some fresh faces, bringing the total up to 100 vendors in Williamsburg and 80 in Brooklyn Bridge Park. Newcomers include El Super, selling seafood tostadas; Bushwick&apos;s Dun-Well Doughnuts, selling their vegan treats; handmade Uruguayan sausage and bread from Txorizeria; and fun pretzels from Bronx Baking Co. </p>

<p>Besides other <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509140829/http://www.smorgasburg.com/vendors/">returning food vendors</a>, SmorgasBar also returns for the Saturday market (starting April 12th), featuring new cocktails like a Maple Mint Julep plus Other Half IPA and Naked Flock Cider. The Sunday market will also have a bar, which will open at some point in April or May. </p>

<p>The Saturday Flea in Fort Greene, which underwent a &quot;modest makeover&quot; that includes a different layout, new vendors and a &quot;more cohesive food section&quot; also opens next weekend. The Sunday Flea will actually have a new home this season with a location announcement coming soon.</p>

<p>Also coming soon, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509140829/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/13/bergn.php">forthcoming Crown Heights beer hall</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509140829/https://www.facebook.com/bergnbeerhall">Berg&apos;n</a> at some point this spring. As a reminder, the 9,000 square foot space will house four permanent food booths for the likes of Ramen Burger, Asia Dog and others, plus a undoubtably dope beer lineup from Brooklyn Brewery frontman Garrett Oliver. Let&apos;s do this, spring!</p>
