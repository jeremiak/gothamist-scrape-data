<p>As we honor U.S. men and women who have died in military service this Memorial Day weekend by <strike>solemnly remembering their sacrifice</strike> crushing Bud Lights at an acquaintance&apos;s backyard BBQ, we may find ourselves reaching for a bottle of ketchup to flavor our food. The viscous <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108032626/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/09/21/this-is-how-much-americans-love-french-fries-and-ketchup/">sugar bomb</a> is a staple of any grilling party and fast food excursion, and though it&apos;s up there as American as apple pie (actually, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108032626/http://time.com/3958057/history-of-pie/">not American</a>) and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108032626/http://gothamist.com/2016/05/26/real_life_presidential_nominee_dona.php">electing a reality star President</a>, turns out good ole catsup is just another in a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108032626/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/12/27/classic-american-things-not-from-us_n_4440784.html">string of co-opted things</a> we&apos;d love to take credit for.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108032626/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzH2_S4ZaQA">short video explainer</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108032626/https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCajXeitgFL-rb5-gXI-aG8Q">Great Big Story</a> investigates the origin story of ketchup, beginning in China with some fermented fish guts.</p>

<p>Setting aside the slight tone of cultural othering&#x2014;&quot;Fish guts? Ewwww!&quot;&#x2014;the real crime here is the flagrant use of ketchup on hot dogs. As the The National Hot Dog Council <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108032626/http://gothamist.com/2014/03/14/national_hot_dog_council_never_use.php">told us</a> that the &quot;use ketchup on your hot dog after the age of 18&quot; is simply unacceptable. Besides, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108032626/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/30/america_best_condiment.php">we&apos;re a mayonnaise country</a>, so put that on your hot dog and bite it. </p>
