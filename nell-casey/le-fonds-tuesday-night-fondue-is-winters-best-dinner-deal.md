<p>Jake Eberle&apos;s cheery Greenpoint bistro <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160507193059/http://www.lefondbk.com/">Le Fond</a> may be one of the city&apos;s best neighborhood restaurants. The atmosphere is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160507193059/http://gothamist.com/2014/10/02/le_fond_greenpoint.php#photo-1">convivial</a>, you can dine solo and not feel awkward, and Eberle&apos;s food is at once familiar and intriguing. And while thoughtful dishes are the hallmark of a destination restaurant, a good neighborhood eatery knows that sometimes you just need to relax, drink a few glasses of wine, and put some simple, homey fare into your mouth. That&apos;s where Fondue Tuesdays come in at the Norman Avenue restaurant. </p>

<p>Eberle began the special <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160507193059/https://www.instagram.com/p/9WHO0nqeOh/">back in January</a>, when this writer&#x2014;who follows the restaurant on Twitter&#x2014;noticed information about the new weekly special. Lured by the promise of molten cheese and a reasonably-priced dinner, a duo set forth to try the fondue, which comes with a bounty of dipping vessels (broccoli, bread, apple slices and the like), plus the addition of a seared steak for a total of $24 or $18 for a vegetarian version. </p>

<p>For his fondue, Eberle&apos;s employing a cheese called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160507193059/http://www.jasperhillfarm.com/alpha/">Alpha Tolman</a>, an Alpine-style melting variety made by Jasper Hill in Vermont. There&apos;s a zippiness to the resulting concoction, likely from the addition of a good wine or some acidic element that brings some brightness to the fat. Halfway through, the server will add a little hot water to what&apos;s left of the cheese, ensuring the mixture stays liquified until the last cube of bread has taken its bath.</p>

<p>The portion can easily feed two&#x2014;especially if you have trouble resisting Le Fond&apos;s incredible duck pasta as a supplement&#x2014;plus Tuesdays are half-priced bottles of wine night, meaning a table for two can snag a delicious, filling meal for just around $53 with tax and tip. You&apos;ll leave sated, a little buzzed and with dollars to spare for a cab ride home.<br>
