<p>We&apos;re only five and a half weeks until Memorial Day (home stretch!) and today, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171101071602/http://riisparkbeachbazaar.com/">Riis Park Beach Bazaar</a>&#x2014;who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171101071602/http://gothamist.com/2015/05/26/riis_park_beach_bazaar.php#photo-26&quot;">took over the amenities</a> at Jacob Riis Park last summer&#x2014;have released their lineup of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171101071602/http://riisparkbeachbazaar.com/food-vendors/">food</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171101071602/http://www.riisparkbeachbazaar.com/events/">entertainment</a> vendors coming to that stretch of the beach this season. An <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171101071602/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/09/wildfeast_foods_jacob_riis.php#photo-1">off-season seafood restaurant</a> has been keeping the space warm throughout the cold winter, but soon the seven Bays will be filled with an assortment of local barbecue, ice cream and frozen drink pushers to fortify a day of letting the sun sap all the moisture out of your body.</p>

<p>Starting on the more southerly end of the park we have Bay 14, where Oaxaca Tacos, a Morroccan-inspired restaurant called Cuisine by Claudette (a local Rockaway business) and Clean Shave Ice&#x2014;organic, local and non-GMO fruits and veggie snow cones, sometimes made with booze&#x2014;will be holding court.  </p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="42716riis2.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20171101071602im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_nellcasey/42716riis2.jpeg" width="640" height="427"> <br> <i> (Dylan Johnson)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>Next up: Bay 9 will be the most well-stocked section of the beach, with seven different food options. Local pizza-maker <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171101071602/http://www.whitsendnyc.com/">Whit&apos;s End</a>s brings wood-fired Neapolitan pies right to the sand this season, joining ice cream from Ample Hills Creamery, Fletcher&apos;s BBQ, Bolivian Llama Party, seafood from Wild Feast Foods and Samesa, the Middle Eastern offering from Sussman siblings Max and Eli, who run a pop-up version at Berg&apos;n. Pop-up vendors in that section include La Newyorkina (paletas, similar to popsicles), ByTheBeachCocos (coconuts) and Paleo Factory, &quot;superfood mouse dessert.&quot;</p>

<p>Bay 6 houses another Sussman operation, Ed &amp; Bev&apos;s, which is also enjoyed a run at Berg&apos;n. Their Detroit-inspired menu features Coney Dogs and Greek-American dishes like spanikopita and Greek salad.</p>

<p>Further north, you&apos;ll come to Bay 4, with pop-ups from Mighty Edible&#x2014;Jamaican food like a plantain chip battered fried chicken soaked in coconut milk and served with hibiscus jam&#x2014;and East Coast Roast artisan coffee.</p>

<p>And finally, Bay 2, where pop-up vendors Lizzmonade (artisanal lemonads), Top Pops (whole fruit on a stick) and Coney Shack (Southeast Asian Tacos) will be vending. </p>
