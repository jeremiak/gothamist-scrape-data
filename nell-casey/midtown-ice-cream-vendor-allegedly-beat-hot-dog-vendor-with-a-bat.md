<p>Yesterday, we revisited the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016134113/http://gothamist.com/2016/05/31/ice_cream_truck_wars.php">ongoing ice cream truck turf wars</a> in midtown, where competing ice cream vendors are using intimidation to scare off fellow frozen dairy pushers. Now an ice cream vendor has been arrested for hitting a hot dog vendor over the head with a baseball bat. For people selling delicious sugary treats to children, these guys <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016134113/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/15/mister_softee_truck_yogo_truck_enga.php">seem to have a lot of rage</a>. </p>

<p>On the afternoon of May 12th, a hot dog vendor selling his tubed fare at 54th Street near Madison Avenue was approached by the driver of a New York Ice Cream truck, the same company that&apos;s been allegedly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016134113/http://gothamist.com/2016/05/31/ice_cream_truck_wars.php">menacing Mister Softee in the area</a>. The two scuffled, after which, according to the NYPD, ice cream assailant John Cicero eventually brought out a bat and hit the hot dog man repeatedly in the head.</p>

<p>Head of the Midtown North Precinct&#x2019;s detective squad Lieutenant Marco Gonzalez <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016134113/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/01/nyregion/ice-cream-man-attacked-midtown-pretzel-vendor-with-bat-police-say.html?_r=0">told the Times</a> that after the bat was removed from Cicero by a bystander, the ice cream man allegedly whipped out a knife and further threatened the other vendor before motoring away in his truck. </p>

<p>After the NYPD <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016134113/https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/06/01/nyregion/01ICECREAM/01ICECREAM-superJumbo.jpg">released images</a> of then-suspect Cicero, he turned himself in yesterday to police. Cicero&#x2014;who seems like a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016134113/https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=592691277537223&amp;set=pb.100003890683052.-2207520000.1464800264.&amp;type=3&amp;theater">chill fun guy</a>&#x2014;was charged with Assault 2, a felony, and Misdemeanor Menacing in the second degree, according to cops. </p>

<p>Good thing our guy Victor in Brooklyn is a pacifist. </p>
