<p>The independent record store scene in New York City suffered a two-for-one blow this week when two high-profile shops announced they would be closing within the next few months. Beloved Village record store <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150225110103/http://bleecker-bobs.blogspot.com/">Bleecker Bob&apos;s</a> is going the way of the fro-yo, it appears. The store announced <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150225110103/https://www.facebook.com/bleecker.bobs.7?ref=ts&amp;fref=ts">on their Facebook page</a> that the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150225110103/http://dangerousminds.net/comments/bleecker_bobs_is_closing_legendary_record_store_to_be_replaced_by_frozen">long-rumored closure</a> was indeed happening. It seems some kind of frozen yogurt chain is poised to take over the space this spring:</p>

<blockquote>looks like the new tenant has signed the lease. we&apos;ve heard they want to be open by June 1. it will take probably around 2 months to get work permits for the massive remodeling job they&apos;ll need to do so we&apos;re figuring we should be open until May 2013!!
---get ready for another chain of self serve yogurt/coffee/hot chocolate cafes NYC!!</blockquote>

<p>Though the store had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150225110103/http://evgrieve.com/2012/12/bleecker-bobs-wont-be-moving-to-east.html">contemplated a move east last year</a> that never happened, an employee at the store told us today that some people would &quot;consider it...if they could find a cheap enough place.&quot; They didn&apos;t sound optimistic. Dangerous Minds has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150225110103/http://dangerousminds.net/comments/bleecker_bobs_is_closing_legendary_record_store_to_be_replaced_by_frozen">a nice eulogy</a> for the 45-year-old shop and some stories about owner Bob Plotnik.  </p>

<p>Across the East River, Williamsburg&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150225110103/http://www.soundfixrecords.com/">Sound Fix</a> <a href="&#x202A;james@soundfixrecords.com&#x202C;">announced on Twitter</a> today that they will also closing down. We spoke to owner James Bradley, who cited a combination of factors that lead to his decision to close the store, ultimately coming down to the digital shift in record industry and also how they deal with retailers. &quot;We&apos;ve been selling more and more vinyl, and I really thought for a period of time we could make it through just selling vinyl,&quot; says Bradley. &quot;But we kept running into the same problem: the record companies weren&apos;t producing enough. Retailers are not part of the equation anymore. I&apos;m not at all optimistic about the future.&quot;</p>

<p>As for what&apos;s coming next, Bradley revealed that the Whiskey Brooklyn will be expanding and taking over the space. Though there aren&apos;t many details at this point, the bar may be looking to increased its food options. </p>

<p>As for Sound Fix, the shop will, fittingly, spin its last track on Record Store Day, April 20th. </p>
