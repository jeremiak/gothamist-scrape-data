That&apos;s <em>real </em>intimacy! </p>

<p>Once a year, the burger chain decks out their stores with balloons, streamers and other frilly pink decorations, plus tablecloths, center pieces and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429092526/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/10/white_castle_burger_scented_candles.php">very special candles</a>, creating their version of a fine dining experience. And no ordering up at the counter like some common fast food junkie; they&apos;ll have special menus and table service, thank you very much. Nothing but the best for your honey bear. </p>
