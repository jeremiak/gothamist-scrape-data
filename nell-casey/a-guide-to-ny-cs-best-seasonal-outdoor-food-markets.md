title: A Guide To NYC's Best Seasonal Outdoor Food Markets
---

	
										<p><em>We can once more leave our apartments with exposed flesh, meaning it&apos;s time to take advantage of the city&apos;s excellent outdoor food markets. Below, the best options for dining al fresco&#x2014;and, probably, without a proper table or utensils&#x2014;and taking advantage of the unique bounty of smaller food purveyors.</em></p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="041316smorg.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170925010808im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_nellcasey/041316smorg.jpeg" width="640" height="480"> <br> <i> (via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170925010808/https://www.facebook.com/smorgasburg/photos/a.282164878519567.61225.143092332426823/790081237727926/?type=3&amp;theater">Facebook</a>)</i></div> <p></p>

<p><strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170925010808/http://www.smorgasburg.com/">SMORGASBURG</a></strong> Without a doubt the city&apos;s biggest and most well-known market, Smorgasburg&apos;s back and bigger than ever this season, operating two large food-centric markets in addition to smaller, satellite operations popping up at sibling market the Brooklyn Flea. There are a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170925010808/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/31/big_mozz_sticks_chicago_beef_sandwi.php#photo-1">batch of fantastic new vendors</a> joining the lineup this year and slinging dishes like Italian beef sandwiches, chicken yakitori, mushroom coffee and mozzarella sticks. </p>

<p>The size of the market means a flavor for every palate&#x2014;and a damn hard time deciding what to choose&#x2014;but navigating the crowds during peak hours can be a drag, especially since there&apos;s little in the way of shade (in Williamsburg) and lines for popular vendors (what&apos;s up, Ramen Burger?) can be brutal. Pro-tip: show up close to opening time at 11 a.m. to be first in line, then watch the insanity from the safety of the accompanying beer gardens.</p>

<p><em>Smorgasburg is in Williamsburg&apos;s Kent State Park on Saturdays and Prospect Park&apos;s Breeze Hill on Sundays. The Brooklyn Flea will be in Fort Greene at 176 Lafayette Avenue on Saturdays, and DUMBO at the Manhattan Bridge Archway Plaza on Sundays.</em></p>

<p><strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170925010808/http://www.redhookfoodvendors.com/">RED HOOK FOOD VENDORS</a></strong> There were many years that pupusa enthusiasts held their breath to find out if the Red Hook Food Vendors would return to the Recreation Fields at 160 Bay Street. But with a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170925010808/http://gothamist.com/2014/04/02/red_hook_food_vendors_secure_6_year.php">multi-year lease</a> currently intact, we&apos;re guaranteed the vendors&apos; delicious options for at least the foreseeable future. Pupusas from El Olomega, huaraches from Country Boys, tacos from Piaxtlan, Arepas from the Colombian food truck and aguas frescas from the Vaqueros truck will all return this season, plus one other vendor that&apos;s as-of-yet unconfirmed. </p>

<p><em>The vendors operate weekends from 10 a.m. to sundown at the Recreation Fields at 160 Bay Street in Red Hook, Brooklyn.</em></p>
