<p>Don&apos;t worry if you missed it the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150603005904/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/14/gothamists_summer_guide_to_june.php#photo-2">first time around</a>; the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150603005904/http://www.dreamlandorchestra.com/calendar.php">Jazz-Age Lawn Party</a> returns to Governors Island for a second time this summer. Don your best 20s attire&#x2014;gentlemen can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150603005904/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/20/photo_jazz_age_hipster_cop_likes_th.php">look to Hipster Cop</a> for inspiration&#x2014;and get ready to Charleston the weekend away! Lots of tasty treats will be available for purchase, though you&apos;re also welcome to BYO picnic (just be discreet with the hooch, they have been known to search bags at the ferry entrance). Edible options include old-fashioned ice cream cones and cocktails, sangria by St-Germain Elderflower Liqueur, and beer from Brooklyn Brewery.</p>

<p>Take in the 1920s motorcar exhibition or purchase some vintage clothing to supplement your ensemble. There will be a bevy of other jazz age-themed activities all weekend; for a preview of what&apos;s in store, check out this <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150603005904/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/24/gorgeous_video_of_governors_island.php">gorgeous video</a> from the event earlier this summer.</p>

<p><em>Also this weekend:</em></p>

<p>The New York Public Library continues its <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150603005904/http://www.nypl.org/blog/2012/03/19/mystery-summer">Mystery Summer</a> film screenings with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150603005904/http://gothamist.com/2011/07/20/five_reasons_why_you_need_to_see_sw.php#photo-1">Gothamist favorite <em>Sweet Smell Of Success</em></a>. See Tony Curtis as Sidney Falco, the desperate, unctuous publicist running a shady P.R. company out of his one bedroom apartment by Times Square. Falco sees the key to success personified in J.J. Hunsecker, the feared gossip columnist inspired by real-life columnist and radio host Walter Winchell, who wielded immense power in the middle of the 20th century. Burt Lancaster is riveting as the effusively cynical Hunsecker, who manipulates Falco into breaking up a relationship between his delicate sister and a jazz musician. If you&apos;ve never seen this quintessential New York City film, cancel all your Sunday plans and head to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150603005904/http://www.nypl.org/locations/mid-manhattan-library">Mid-Manhattan Library</a> at 2 p.m. </p>

<p>Stretch in the sun on Saturday with free yoga classes at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150603005904/http://dekalbmarket.com/">Dekalb Market</a> courtesy of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150603005904/http://www.popupyoga-nyc.com/">Pop Up Yoga</a>. Three free classes will be offered from 11 a.m. to noon, 1 p.m. to 2 p.m. and 3 p.m. to 4 p.m. with practitioners of all levels welcome to attend. Salute the sun along with a soundtrack by DJs who will be spinning all day. You can follow up the stretching with refreshments from a variety of excellent food vendors, and shopping in the darling little boutiques located inside the shipping containers. </p>
