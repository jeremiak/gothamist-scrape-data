<p>Push thoughts of a Labor Day weekend spent <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025124144/http://gothamist.com/2016/09/01/tropical_storm_hermine_wrecking_lab.php">doing puzzles indoors</a> out of your mind with some free pizza&#x2014;if you don&apos;t mind standing in the rain! Today beginning at 4 p.m., Eataly&apos;s Flatiron location&#x2014;desperate for friends after its <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025124144/http://gothamist.com/2016/08/02/eataly_wtc_carbs_bread.php#photo-1">flashier sibling</a> opened downtown&#x2014;will be handing out free za in Neapolitan form. </p>

<p>It&apos;s actually <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025124144/https://www.eataly.com/us_en/stores/nyc-flatiron/archive-nyc-flatiron/flatiron-birthday-party-2016/">Eataly&apos;s sixth birthday</a>; to celebrate they&apos;ll also be doling out free focaccia and chocolates, too, as any good birthday party does. In Chicago, they&apos;re <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025124144/http://chicagoist.com/2016/08/31/eat_everything_at_eataly_for_one_ni.php">giving away the whole farm</a> but we New Yorkers thrive on withholding and restraint. </p>

<p>Head over to the Le Eccellenze spot (it&apos;s in the standing enoteca La Piazza) in Eataly to claim your rain-given right to free food.</p>
