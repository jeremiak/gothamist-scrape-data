<p>On Saturday, just shy of its 90th birthday, Theater District staple Frankie &amp; Johnnie&apos;s Steakhouse shut the doors on West 45th Street, where the restaurant had called home since 1926. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160609081653/http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/23/dining/eli-kulp-high-street-on-hudson-west-village.html?_r=0">The Times reported</a> that the building housing the restaurant was &quot;being put to another use&quot; and thus the restaurant is relocating nearby to 320 West 46th Street. While the new space doesn&apos;t have as much historical cred, it was formerly home to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160609081653/http://pagesix.com/2015/01/19/the-last-b-smith-manhattan-restaurant-closes-its-doors/">last outpost of B. Smith&apos;s</a>, a restaurant chain started by the model in 1986.</p>

<p>In its early incarnation, the original space acted as a speakeasy, where tipplers would travel for illicit drinks and hunks of beef. In 1985, new ownership began building up the steakhouse aspect, leaving a semi-secret bar&#x2014;only accessible through the kitchen&#x2014;as an oasis to in-the-know folks prior to a Broadway show. In 2010, that bar underwent an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160609081653/http://gothamist.com/2010/01/21/frankie_johnnies_bar_a_theater_dist.php">unfortunate revamp</a> that sucked the soul out of the special space.</p>

<p>&quot;The 46th Street location is a stunning, bi-level, 140-seat restaurant with a private dining room...and an expansive bar, something the original location was challenged with,&quot; reads the press release. The &quot;custom mahogany wood bar with black granite top&quot; sounds like a fine place for a three-olive martini to toast the destruction of NYC&apos;s historic spaces.</p>
