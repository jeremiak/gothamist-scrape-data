<p>Isn&apos;t it just so <em>icky</em> when the crisp flesh of your Granny Smith Apple turns an unappetizing shade of tan? If you&apos;re a persnickety eater or, say, a five-year-old, perhaps you&apos;re troubled by this phenomenon, whereby sliced apple flesh turns a bit brown when exposed to oxygen. If that&apos;s the case, you&apos;ll be thrilled to know that the Agriculture Department is thisclose to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428131604/http://seattletimes.com/html/businesstechnology/2022616999_arcticgmoapplexml.html">approving the so-called &quot;Arctic apple,&quot;</a> a genetically modified variety from Canada that retains its pristine color even after it&apos;s been sliced or bitten. For the rest of us, it&apos;s more than a little bit ominous.</p>

<p>Unlike &quot;traditional&quot; GMOs, which essentially combine genes from multiple species to create desired characteristics, scientists used gene sequences from other apples to prevent the &quot;enzymatic browning.&quot; Champions for the apples have said they make the food more &quot;visually appealing,&quot; especially to younger children who might balk at the thought of eating something brown. Companies that use pre-sliced apples (think McDonalds and Starbucks) currently use a chemical antioxidant called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428131604/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/d-brief/2014/01/10/genetically-altered-apples-that-wont-turn-brown-could-reach-u-s-stores/#.UtBipWRDsoZ">calcium ascorbate</a> to keep the brown away. So pick your poison: Frankenfruit or chemicals or... organic produce that doesn&apos;t come prepackaged from an evil monolithic corporation?</p>

<p>Besides lingering concerns about GMOs in general, apple producers in the United States are concerned for their livelihoods, especially &quot;the marketing impact, from consumer impact to the imposition of additional costs,&quot; a rep for the Northwest Horticulture Council told Seattle Times. There&apos;s further concern that honeybees will contaminate organic orchards after feasting on the hybrid apple pollen.
