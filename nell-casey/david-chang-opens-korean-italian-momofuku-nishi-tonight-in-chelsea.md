<p>Tonight, David Chang opens the next addition to his Momofuku fleet, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108033711/http://nishi.momofuku.com/">Nishi</a>, at 232 Eighth Avenue in Chelsea. This is the first new eatery the restaurateur and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108033711/http://gothamist.com/tags/fuku">fried chicken pusher</a> has debuted in five years&#x2014;the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108033711/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/17/best_new_restaurants_2015.php">reboot of Momofuku Ko</a> notwithstanding&#x2014;and true to form, he&apos;s taking his empire in a new direction. Ko alums Josh Pinsky and Carey Hynes are set to be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108033711/http://nishi.momofuku.com/team/">turning out</a> a hybrid menu of Korean and Italian-influenced dishes; &quot;If people want to call it fusion, well fuck you. It is fusion,&quot; Chang <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108033711/http://luckypeach.com/harold-mcgee-on-coffee/">railed to Lucky Peach</a>. &quot;Tell me what food isn&#x2019;t fusion?&quot;</p>

<p>The restaurant&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108033711/http://nishi.momofuku.com/nishi/menu/menu-coming-soon/">menu</a> hasn&apos;t debuted in full yet&#x2014;surely the fangirl Instagrams will be blowing up tonight&#x2014;but Chang teased a su jae bi/malfati dish&#x2014;&quot;essentially the same thing as chicken and dumplings&quot;&#x2014;a grilled sweet potato with vinegar, burned garlic, hoisin, chilies and crispy fish; and a cacio e pepe made with fermented chickpea paste instead of parmesan. </p>

<blockquote>There are Italian words on the menu but we&#x2019;re not trying to make Italian food. We&#x2019;re not trying to make a Korean restaurant. We&#x2019;re trying to do something that we&#x2019;ve never done at Momofuku. We&#x2019;re inspired by Italy but we&#x2019;re not using any Italian ingredients. Things are moving at light speed here.</blockquote>

<p>The chef also took the opportunity to criticize the implication that Asian food has to be cheap. &quot;Why? Not one person has given me a reason why. All the ingredients that we&#x2019;re getting are top quality, and just as expensive as any other restaurant,&quot; he points out. &quot;We&#x2019;re replacing the parmesan with our own fermented chickpea paste that took us six to nine months to make. So fuck you guys. I&#x2019;m not getting on the phone and ordering a wheel of parmesan. Don&#x2019;t tell me that I can&#x2019;t charge like Italian food.&quot; </p>

<p>Okay Dave, but at some point do we stop getting yelled at and get to eat?</p>

<p>Prices are also likely to be higher since Nishi won&apos;t be accepting tips. &quot;Bottom line is we want to pay sous chefs, cooks, and dishwashers a living wage,&quot; Chang reveals. The chef points out the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108033711/http://gothamist.com/2015/11/20/robicelli_bakery_nyc_struggle.php">insane margins</a> every NYC restaurant deals with and the struggle chefs and back-of-house staff endure to make any money. &quot;We want to be able to grow as a company so we can provide for more people. This is a way we might be able to do that. And if it doesn&#x2019;t work, we can always go back to the old way.&quot;</p>
