title: This Is What McDonald's McRib Actually Looks Like

										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="111213mcrib.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509220115im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_nellcasey/111213mcrib.jpg" width="640" height="480"> <br> <i> <span class="photo_caption">Mmmmmeatsicle (via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509220115/http://imgur.com/uLG1TTI">Imgur</a>)</span></i></div> <p></p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509220115/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/12/its_nycs_first_fleeting_snow.php">approaching winter</a> can mean only one thing: the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509220115/http://www.brandeating.com/2013/11/news-mcdonalds-mcrib-is-back-2013.html">return of McRib season</a> at McDonald&apos;s! And just in time for this most sacred of food observances, a redditor <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509220115/http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/1qeaez/my_buddy_works_at_mcdonalds_and_sent_me_this/">shared the above photo</a> of a pre-cooked McRib...patty? Is it lunchtime yet?</p>

<p>The photo apparently shows &quot;raw McRib meat&quot; and, judging by the boxes in the back, it&apos;s safe to say we&apos;re looking at Le McRib Canadien. Wonder if they use the same ratio of &quot;restructured meat product&quot; to &quot;scalded pig stomach&quot; up north? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509220115/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/13/video_beyond_pink_slime_lies_white.php">Waste not want not</a>!</p>

<p>Ultimately, this frozen pig sponge gets dressed up in barbecue sauce and sandwiched inside a cornmeal bun for 500 calories and 980 milligrams of sodium for your digestive pleasure. If you&apos;ve still got the stomach for it&#x2014;ho HO!&#x2014;the McPopsicle should return to your local Mickey D&apos;s in the next few weeks.</p>
