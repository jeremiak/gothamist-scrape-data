<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161113150224/http://queensnightmarket.com/"><strong>Queens Night Market</strong></a> begins its <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161113150224/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/03/queens_night_market_october.php#photo-3">autumnal residency</a> in the month of October on Saturday evening, which marks the first of four pop-ups this month. There&apos;ll be over 40 food vendors plus an additional dozen offering artisan jewelry and vintage items, beauty products and folk art. Food options include a cornucopia of cuisines, like mac n cheese, artisanal twinkies, bubble tea, duck buns, Trinidadian shark sandwiches, jerk chicken, Chilean street food and takoyaki.</p>

<p>If you didn&apos;t take my previous advice to pick up a wedge of decadent St. Andre cheese from your <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161113150224/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/16/grocery_store_cheese_polemic.php">local grocery store</a>, swing by the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161113150224/http://frenchcheeseboard.com/">French Cheese Board</a> in Nolita this weekend to snag yourself a sample. Ile de France cheesemakers will be popping up at the site with a <strong>&quot;cheese school&quot;</strong> that includes samples of their brie, goat cheese, camembert and other varieties, with advice on pairings and creating cheese plates. Of course: plenty of cheese samples, too. The pop-up is open Friday, Saturday and Sunday from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.</p>
