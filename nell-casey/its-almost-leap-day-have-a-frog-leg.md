<p>Leap Day happens but once every four years, so let&apos;s all take advantage of this weird calendrical quirk and indulge in amphibians, alcohol, and astrology. It&apos;s almost February 29th, people! Don&apos;t let this one slide by unobserved like it did in 2008, when you wasted the night curled up in your Obama &quot;Hope&quot; Snuggie freaking out about Fidel Castro&apos;s resignation and watching <em>Juno</em> again. </p>

<p>Frog legs are a popular dish on leap day, for obvious reasons. If you&apos;ve never tried Kermit, the texture is reminiscent of chicken but with a slightly sweeter flavor. Chef Jason Tilmann of <strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406171400/http://www.triomphe-newyork.com/">Triomphe</a></strong> restaurant in midtown has created two special frog leg dishes to celebrate this special day. An appetizer of crispy frog legs with roasted shallot and arugula drizzled with a lemon aioli vinaigrette ($15) is a great introduction to frog legs if you believe the &quot;everything tastes good fried&quot; dictum. The second leggy option takes a classic French cassoulet and adds Florida Frogs legs, andouille sausage and white beans with an herbs de Provencal crust ($28). </p>

<p>Meanwhile, over at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406171400/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/05/at_the_americano_restaurant_the_foo.php"><strong>The Americano</strong></a>, guest chef Abignil Mendoza and her sisters have created an ancient Zapotec cuisine menu in honor of the leap year. The $85 prix fixe meal gets you three courses including mezcal tlamanalli&#x2014;inspired by the Zapotec god of food&#x2014;and a mole de segesa with corn, green tomato and hierba santa. On top of that, the restaurant will have a psychic on hand to read fortunes and tell you what&apos;s in store for the coming year. </p>

<p>And don&apos;t think that we&apos;ve forgotten about you special <strike>freaks</strike> folks who happen to be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406171400/http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/02/27/us-leapday-idUSTRE81Q24420120227">born on a leap day</a>. Lucky for you the <strong>Village Pourhouse</strong> hasn&apos;t either. The downtown bar has put together a special birthday party for any leap year babies turning &quot;6&quot; and up. Gratis champagne, birthday cake and a birthday cake shot are in store for this bash, which will take the form of a kid&apos;s birthday party replete with Wii, Rock Band, pinatas and nostalgic party games. If that&apos;s not enough, leap year babies can also indulge in a dozen free cupcakes from Upper East Side bakery <strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406171400/http://sprinkles.com/cupcake-bakery-locations/new-york/">Sprinkles Cupcakes</a></strong>. </p>

<p>Since we&apos;re taking the time to eat them, perhaps we should give back to the frog community by volunteering for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406171400/http://www.aza.org/become-a-frogwatch-volunteer/"><strong>FrogWatch USA</strong></a>, the flagship citizen science program of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums. <strong>The Central Park Zoo</strong> is offering free training from 6:30 to 8:00 p.m. tomorrow to certify volunteers to &quot;learn about the wetlands in their communities and help conserve amphibians by reporting the calls of local frogs and toads.&quot; </p>
