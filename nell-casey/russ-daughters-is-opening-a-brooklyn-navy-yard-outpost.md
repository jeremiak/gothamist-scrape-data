<p>Today the Brooklyn Navy Yard announced that the 102-year-old appetizing shop Russ &amp; Daughters will be the anchor tenant in the refurbished Building 77, which will act as a public food hall and manufacturing hub for local NYC businesses when it&apos;s completed in early 2017. </p>

<p>The fourth generation family-owned business will occupy 14,000-square-feet of the former World War II-era warehouse, which is currently undergoing a $185 million renovation. In the space, which sits along Flushing between Claremont and Vanderbilt Avenues, Russ &amp; Daughters will operate a retail component serving breakfast and lunch throughout the week; a bakery and central kitchen component that will service their local outlets in addition to nationwide retail; and a catering arm.</p>

<p>Russ &amp; Daughters joins the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170112091609/http://kingscountydistillery.com/">Kings County Distillery</a> as another local food business at the Brooklyn Navy Yard and the corporation is seeking other local businesses interested in manufacturing space on site. As the next big warehouse-turned-destination&#x2014;in the same vein as Industry City&#x2014;the Navy Yard will also house <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170112091609/http://gothamist.com/2015/05/13/wegmans_grocery_store_is_coming_to.php">Wegmans Grocery Store</a>, arguably the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170112091609/http://gothamist.com/2015/05/15/wegmans_rhapsody.php">most exciting new supermarket opening</a> in Brooklyn since the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170112091609/http://gothamist.com/2013/12/17/brooklyn_herd_stampedes_into_whole.php">Gowanus Whole Foods</a>. </p>

<p>It&apos;s a time for expansion not only for Russ &amp; Daughters, who&apos;ve opened a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170112091609/http://gothamist.com/2014/05/08/photos_the_long-awaited_russ_daught.php#photo-1">Lower East Side cafe</a> and a forthcoming <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170112091609/http://gothamist.com/2014/09/09/russ_daughters_opening_cafe_on_uppe.php">UES outpost</a> at the Jewish Museum, but for another LES institution: Katz&apos;s Deli. The 127-year-old pastrami purveyor is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170112091609/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/13/katzs_deli_is_coming_to_brooklyn.php">opening at Dekalb Market</a>, a huge new development in Downtown Brooklyn, at some point this year. </p>
