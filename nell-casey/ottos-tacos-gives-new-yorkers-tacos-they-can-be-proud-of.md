</div></div>					<p>Our city gets a bad rep when it comes to Mexican food, with snobs from West Coast insisting we wouldn&apos;t know a real taco even if we Instagrammed it taking up an extra seat on the subway. I&apos;d argue we have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150815005650/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/12/a_food_drink_tour_of_spanish_harlem.php">more than adequate</a> tacos if you know where to look, especially if your searches bring you to newly opened <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150815005650/http://ottostacos.com/#home">Otto&apos;s Tacos</a> in the East Village. Owner Otto Cedeno and chef Joe LoNigro designed the taqueria like the ones they loved in LA, where the food was fresh, fast and dirt cheap.  </p>

<p>They&apos;re succeeding on all fronts there, with the tasty tacos topping out at $3.50. They&apos;re also doing everything in house, including their addictive corn tortillas, which you can watch being pressed out on a nifty-looking piece of machinery behind the counter. Don&apos;t miss the shrimp tacos: tender, succulent shrimp coated in a salty spice mix, then topped with a creamy sauce, raw white onions and chopped cilantro. The carne asada is also excellent, with lots of charred flavor and a kick of heat from salsa roja. Regardless of the filling, the meat and veggies are well-packaged in the delicious tortillas; if you&apos;re only familiar with the pre-made variety, you&apos;re in for a big awakening. </p>

<p>In addition to taco casings, Otto and crew are using their masa dough to make &quot;fries&quot; by rolling the dough out thick, cutting it into strips and chucking it in the fryer. They&apos;re difficult to describe: crisp like a regular potato fry but the interior texture more granular. They&apos;re serving up their creation with a spicy chipotle mayo; get ready to keep dunking and dunking even after you&apos;re already full. They&apos;re also frying up ridiculously tasty churros with dulce de leche dipping sauce, but Otto revealed they won&apos;t be on the menu for much longer, so hurry before they&apos;re nixed. Wash everything down with some of their house-made horchata or some of that Mexican Coke you kids are always raving about.</p>
