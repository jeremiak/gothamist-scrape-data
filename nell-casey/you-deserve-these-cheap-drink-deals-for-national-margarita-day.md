<p>Next Monday, February 22nd, the ingenious world of food P.R. has bestowed upon us a special winter respite, National Margarita Day, when we&apos;re encouraged to overindulge in summertime cocktails regardless of where the mercury falls. Here are a few potentially good deals and activities for the observant:</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170306080020/http://tonyromas.com/">Tony Roma&apos;s</a></strong>, a steakhouse near the Barclays Center, is hooking it up big time for this most holy of holidays. The restaurant will be shaking up their Classic Romarita&apos;s for $2.22, meaning an unhealthy amount of Sauza and Cointreau can be consumed for under $10. If you&apos;re busy on the 22nd, the restaurant will still offer you a $4 version if you stop by anytime between now and the 21st. </p>

<p>UES Mexican spot <strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170306080020/http://www.richardsandoval.com/mayany/">Maya</a></strong> and Midtown sister restaurant <strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170306080020/http://www.richardsandoval.com/zengony/">Zengo</a></strong> are both offering $7 versions of their margaritas if you can score a seat at the bar and both are doing some super spicy versions to make it interesting. At Maya, you can try a version with Agavilles Blanco, habanero, blood orange and a chile pasilla rim (&quot;Yucatan&quot;) and at Zengo there&apos;s the Watermelon Soju with Agavales Reposado, Korean soju, watermelon and serrano pepper.</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="021616calexico.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170306080020im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_nellcasey/021616calexico.jpg" width="640" height="427"> <br> <i> (courtesy of Calexico)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>At their four brick-and-mortar locations, the burrito experts at <strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170306080020/http://calexico.net/">Calexico</a></strong> are celebrating a brand-new cocktail menu with a 2-for-1 offer on all of their newbies beginning on the 22nd and running through the 24th. The Tippling Brothers collaborations include a David Bowie-inspired margarita, Rebel Rebel, made with passionfruit, chipotles, and dark chocolate and The Roadrunner, a margarita with Fresno peppers and pineapple. All told, there are nine new offerings from the Meixcan chainlet and each runs about $10 - $12 normally, so they&apos;ll be between $5 and $6 for the holiday.</p>

<p>Pair virtue with vice at <strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170306080020/http://www.doscaminos.com/">Dos Caminos</a></strong>, the Mexican chain branch of the BR Guest hospitality group. They&apos;re highlighting a Green Juice Margarita ($15), a new addition to their cocktail menu, made with traditional green juice components (kale, cucumber, apple, ginger, etc.) with tequila, mint, coconut liqueur and a chili-lime salt rim. This sounds like the margarita you&apos;ll need following a night drinking exclusively margaritas. </p>

<p><strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170306080020/http://www.blockheads.com/">Blockheads</a></strong> knows that one margarita alone isn&apos;t enough to get one truly buzzed, so they&apos;re including their special Bulldog Margaritas in their celebration, selling the marg-and-beer combos for just $5 on Monday. There&apos;s a traditional with a float of Sauza, another with a float of Fireball and even some non-tequila options made with vodka, rum and sangria. Their classic margaritas will be running for $3 on Monday at all seven locations, with the special three buck deal lasting through March 10th (at least) at their newer East Village outpost.</p>

<p>During happy hour from 5 p.m. to 8 p.m., Japanese noodle spot <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170306080020/http://www.koanyc.com/home"><strong>KOA</strong></a> is offering half off their special margaritas, including a Green Tea Margarita made with green tea powder that should help fuel a night of tequila-drinking. That and their Agave Margarita with peach schnapps will be $6.50 during the special.</p>
