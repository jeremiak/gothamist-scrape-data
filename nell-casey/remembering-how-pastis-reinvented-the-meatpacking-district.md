<p>Following service this evening, Keith McNally closes his iconic Meatpacking District oasis Pastis, for what he&apos;s said are about 15-months of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408151242/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/03/pastis.php">building renovations</a>. Despite his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408151242/http://ny.eater.com/archives/2014/02/mcnally_dispels_rumors_of_a_restoration_hardware_hotel_1.php">insistence to the contrary</a>, rumors have been swirling that the restaurant might <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408151242/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/01/iconic_restaurant_pastis_will_shutt.php">close forever</a> and be replaced by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408151242/http://ny.eater.com/archives/2014/02/rumor_pastis_will_move_down_the_block.php">something else</a>. </p>

<p>We&apos;ve no way of knowing how it&apos;ll all turn out until it all turns out; nonetheless, some outlets have put out <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408151242/http://nypost.com/2014/02/26/nyc-celebs-remember-iconic-meatpacking-eatery-pastis/">engaging reminiscences</a> to the eatery. Today GrubStreet published a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408151242/http://www.grubstreet.com/2014/02/keith-mcnally-pastis-oral-history.html">lengthy oral history</a> filled with anecdotes from regulars, critics and long-time employees. Many rightly credit Pastis as a symbol of a changing neighborhood when it opened in 1999, a bartender talks about &quot;literal Bloody Marys&quot; after cutting himself in a brunch crunch; there&apos;s also lots of talk of &quot;trannies.&quot; </p>

<p>Amidst the praise of McNally&apos;s pioneering spirit, neighborhood dedication and &quot;respectable-plus&quot; fare are a few salacious stories of debauchery and bad celeb behavior. Rampant drug use was &quot;pretty typical among waitstaff,&quot; according to one server. Chef de cuisine Sascha Lyon talks about a drunk couple who &quot;wouldn&apos;t stop having sex&quot; on one of the restaurant&apos;s banquettes (the police were eventually called). There&apos;s also plenty of celeb bad behavior like &quot;bitchy&quot; Matthew McConaughey and a funny anecdote about Robert Downey, Jr. intentionally tripping a server. </p>
