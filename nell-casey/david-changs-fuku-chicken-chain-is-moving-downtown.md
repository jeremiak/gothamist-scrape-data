<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171024121732/http://gothamist.com/tags/davidchang">David Chang</a>&#x2014;who rivals Danny Meyer in the Busiest Restaurant Guy In NYC category&#x2014;is apparently cruising into the Financial District in a big way, opening an outlet of his Fuku fleet in the neighborhood. The FiDi Fan Page, a Facebook group for the area, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171024121732/https://www.facebook.com/groups/126993340709079/permalink/1288092767932458/">posted the news</a> last night, indicating the fried chicken outlet would be coming in for a landing at 110 Wall Street. The prolific restaurateur is also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171024121732/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/23/david_chang_seaport.php">opening a restaurant</a> in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171024121732/http://gothamist.com/tags/pier17">Pier 17</a> at the South Street Seaport at some point in the future.</p>

<p>A rep for the restaurant <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171024121732/http://ny.eater.com/2016/12/8/13884602/fuku-financial-district">told Eater</a> there&apos;s no opening date to announce yet but the location is &quot;currently in development.&quot;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the architecture firm  Michael Zenreich Architect, PC has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171024121732/http://www.mzarchitects.com/architecture/restaurants/fumo/">released renderings</a> of what the new restaurant will look like. Expect Chang&apos;s signature sleek simplicity (this time the chairs have backs!) and a larger space than the mini East Village original, which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171024121732/http://gothamist.com/2015/06/16/fuku_chicken_binge.php#photo-6">doesn&apos;t offer seating at all</a>. Maybe he&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171024121732/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/18/dining/momofuku-nishi-review.html?_r=0">taking those discomfort notes</a> to heart.</p>
