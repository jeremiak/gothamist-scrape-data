<p>Kick off the unofficial start of summer at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161006132504/http://bottleandbine.com/">Bottle &amp; Bine</a>, where they&apos;re offering a <strong>special Lobster Roll</strong> ($23) with spicy aioli, watercress and <em>fried avocado</em>. We ordinarily don&apos;t endorse <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161006132504/http://gothamist.com/2014/05/30/restaurant_offers_160_gold_dusted_l.php">breaking with tradition</a>, but the creamy avocado and crunchy fried coating <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161006132504/https://www.instagram.com/p/BFrfoq7koFd/?taken-by=nellcasey">complement the crustacean beautifully</a> and the pile of accompanying fries is crunchy and decadent. Order the Pastry Basket ($18) with homemade Twinkies and moist cornbread and a bottle of the Bodegas Fontana Mesta Tempranillo Ucl&#xE9;s rose to complete the indulgent meal.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161006132504/http://www.dbgb.com/nyc">DBGB Kitchen &amp; Bar</a> has been taking over the kitchen at Threes Brewing of late but their stay ends after this weekend. Swing by through Monday for their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161006132504/http://www.threesbrewing.com/food">special menu</a> of Mediterranean fare like Crispy Flatbread with black olive, spinach, feta and cherry tomato ($15) and Tunisienne Dog ($14) made with lamb merguez sausage, mint yogurt and red onion. After DBGB vacates, the space&apos;ll be taken over by Tortilleria Nixtamal for an extended summer residency from May 31st through July 10th.</p>

<p>Holiday weekends aren&apos;t complete without hot dogs and there are two ways to get down with them this weekend&#x2014;and beyond.
