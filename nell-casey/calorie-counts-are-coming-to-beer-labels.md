<p>Ignoring the caloric impact of a few sixers over the weekend is going to be a lot more difficult now that Big Beer has signed on to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021115136/http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-07-12/u-s-beer-will-get-calorie-counts-under-new-industry-guidelines">post calorie counts</a> and other nutrition facts on their labels. Anheuser-Busch, MillerCoors, HeinekenUSA, Constellation Brands Beer Division and other carbonated piss water pushers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021115136/http://www.beerinstitute.org/news-media/press-releases/voluntary-disclosure-announcement">released a statement</a> yesterday to &quot;display specific consumer information&quot; on bottles and cans of their product. The summer is now ruined.</p>

<p>&quot;Beer is the most popular alcohol beverage in the United States,&quot; notes Beer Institute CEO Jim McGreevy, failing to grasp that the tiny escape from the realities of a &quot;good diet&quot; are part of the appeal. &quot;Providing meaningful information will ultimately empower the consumer when making decisions regarding the beer beverage of their choice.&quot; Stella drinkers aren&apos;t going to switch to Budweiser to save the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021115136/http://www.popsugar.com/fitness/Calories-Popular-Beers-1504697">difference of nine calories</a>, guys, come on.</p>

<p>The brewers involved in the new label disclosure comprise over 81% of the beer market, a sobering thought indeed. They&apos;ll join chain restaurants in the practice, who are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021115136/http://gothamist.com/2014/11/25/calorie_counts_everywhere.php&quot;">required by the FDA</a> to list the nutritional makeup of whatever it is that passes for food there. Nobody <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021115136/http://gothamist.com/2015/11/04/numbers_are_theoretical_anyway.php">really looks at calorie counts</a> anyway, and if you&apos;re poisoning your body with Molson Ice do you really GAF about the impact to your daily calorie allowance?</p>

<p>The new voluntary measure is expected to be implemented by 2020, so <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021115136/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/28/binge_drinking_science.php">chug</a> in relatively blissful ignorance until then.</p>
