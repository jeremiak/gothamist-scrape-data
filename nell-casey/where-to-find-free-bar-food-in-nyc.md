title: Where To Find Free Bar Food In NYC
---

	
										<p><em>The most important food group is free food. Leaving aside some of the more well-known gratis offerings in NYC (free pizza at Alligator/Crocodile/Charleston, free cheese balls/Twizzlers at The Levee, free hot dogs at Rudy&apos;s), here are a few places for budget-minded to eat, drink and still have money for an Uber home.</em></p>

<p><strong>MACHIAVELLI</strong> The Italian tradition of <strong>&quot;aperitivo&quot;</strong> takes on different forms across the country; some places might just offer a bowl of chips and another of olives, while others a full spread of antipasti, pizza, and other snacks. It&apos;s the latter you&apos;ll find at this Upper West Side restaurant, where on <strong>Monday to Friday</strong>, 4 p.m. to 6 p.m., every alcoholic beverage comes accompanied by a full spread that&apos;s practically a meal. Expect a small margherita pizza, mixed olives, and house-made potato chips, plus things like salami and Caprese skewers with mozzarella cheese and tomatoes.</p>

<p><em>519 Columbus Avenue, (212) 724-2658; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031055640/http://machiavellinyc.com/">machiavellinyc.com</a></em></p>

<p><strong>BLIND TIGER ALE HOUSE</strong> Already known for its exemplary collection of fascinating beers, on <strong>Wednesdays</strong>, this West Village pub also caters to cheese lovers, bringing in <strong>fromage from neighbor Murray&apos;s Cheese</strong>. Selections change week-to-week, but like clockwork at 6 p.m. the spread comes rolling out, along with fresh baguette. As you may have guessed, this is a popular special; get there early to reap the spoils.</p>

<p><strong>LUCKY DOG / GEORGE &amp; JACK&apos;S TAP ROOM</strong> Laying a carbohydrate base is essential for day drinking on the weekends, which is where this duo of Williamsburg bars comes in. On <strong>Saturdays and Sunday</strong> starting at noon, both put out a spread of <strong>bagels, cucumbers, onion and cream cheese</strong>, which is available to anyone who stops in (drinking encouraged, of course, and the bloodies at both are excellent). During non-brunch hours, George &amp; Jack&apos;s also supplies a steady stream of freshly popped corn, with Old Bay, garlic powder and salt on the side.</p>

<p><em>Lucky Dog is located at 303 Bedford Avenue and George &amp; Jack&apos;s Tap Room is located at 103 Berry Street</em></p>

<p><strong>MULLANE&apos;S</strong> For the past decade, this Fort Greene pub has offered a <strong>weekday free buffet</strong> beginning at 3 p.m. until the tray runs out (typically before the 7 p.m. cutoff). The kitchen makes everything from scratch, and possible buffet options include <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031055640/https://www.thrillist.com/eat/new-york/where-to-eat-for-free-in-nyc">sandwiches, fries, pasta and other hot foods</a>. </p>

<p><strong>BABBALUCCI</strong> No cardboard free pizza here. This Harlem restaurant offers a <strong>free spread of tomato-sauced pizzas and vegetarian dishes</strong> during their <strong>weekday</strong> happy hour. Sometimes it&apos;s also mushroom rice balls, other times fresh salads. </p>

<p><em>331 Lenox Avenue, (646) 918-6572; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031055640/http://www.babbalucci.com/">babbalucci</a></em></p>

<p><strong>GALLAGHER&apos;S 2000</strong> I&apos;m not one to judge anyone&apos;s vehicle for free food&#x2014;sometimes you&apos;ve gotta save your singles for more important expenditures. This Long Island City strip club offers a few ways to get a stomach-full while getting an eye-full. During the week, it&apos;s a <strong>free sandwich at lunch</strong> with purchase of a $4 beer, and then on <strong>Sundays</strong>, <strong>free hot dogs</strong> all the livelong day. </p>

<p><em>Gallagher&apos;s 2000 is located at 43-19 37th Street in Long Island City, Queens, (718) 361-1348. No cover until 8 p.m. then $10 Sunday through Thursday and $15 Fridays and Saturdays.</em></p>

<p><strong>CROXLEY&apos;S</strong> Truth be told, the boneless wings at this mini-chain are not great, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031055640/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpUWrl3-mc8">Bob</a>. But they&apos;re also <em>free</em> on <strong>Fridays</strong>, and sometimes, cheapskates can&apos;t be choosers. From 4 - 7 p.m. in Manhattan and noon - 7 p.m. in Brooklyn, stop by the bar for a <strong>buffet of boneless &quot;wings&quot;</strong>&#x2014;they&apos;re often just unbreaded cubes of chicken breast, from what I can tell&#x2014;and a beer from the bar&apos;s solid lineup.</p>

<p><em>Croxley&apos;s Manahttan is located at 28 Avenue B, (212) 253-6140 and Croxley&apos;s Brooklyn is located at 63 Grand Street, (718) 387-4290; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031055640/http://www.croxley.com/">croxley.com</a></em></p>

<p><strong>EMPORIO</strong> If you&apos;ve noticed Italian food&apos;s heavy on this list, it&apos;s with good reason: they know how to live over there. But they&apos;ve brought those traditions here, at places like this Nolita eatery, who put out a <strong>daily spread of nibbles</strong> between 5 p.m. and 6:30 p.m. On the bar you&apos;ll find squares of cooked, chilled polenta; flatbreads of various kinds; and bowls of mixed olives. Pair with one of their wines, which are organized by the region they&apos;re from in Italy.</p>

<p><strong>OVEST PIZZOTECA</strong> Vegetables, pizzas, hummus, flatbreads, and all sorts of other light bites await at this cute spot on West 27th Street. Their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031055640/http://ovestnyc.com/aperitivo/">aperitivo</a> lasts weekdays from 5 p.m. to 8 p.m. and is meant to be paired with a refreshing apertivi. Try an Aperol Spritz with prosecco if you&apos;re in a Venetian frame of mind, or a Limoniamo with limoncello and prosecco to channel the Amalfi Coast.</p>

<p><strong>RYAN MAGUIRE&apos;S ALE HOUSE</strong> Time your cards right for happy hour and you&apos;ll be treated to a stomach-coating platter of comfort food that&apos;s conducive to many a post-FiDi workday beer. Options might include a tray of penne pasta, or a beef stew, or a tray of sausages. The free buffet runs Monday to Friday from 5 p.m. until 7 p.m.</p>
