<p>Stress eating raw cookie dough has the potentially irritating side effect of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170906001929/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/12/raw_cookie_dough_is_out_to_kill_you.php">possibly landing you in the hospital</a>. On the plus side: free Jello! </p>

<p>In 2015, Kristen Tomlan found a way to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170906001929/http://gothamist.com/2015/06/19/cookie_dough_what_what.php">make raw cookie dough safe</a> with &quot;pasteurized-egg product and heat-treated flour,&quot; and now <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170906001929/http://www.grubstreet.com/2017/01/do-greenwich-village.html?mid=full-rss-grubstreet">Grub Street reports</a> that she&apos;s opening up a shop devoted to getting raw cookie dough into the mouths of New Yorkers by any means possible. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170906001929/https://www.cookiedonyc.com/new-store/">DO</a> opens next week at 550 Laguardia Place, billed as &quot;New York City&apos;s first ever cookie dough scoop shop.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Eat - and customize - your edible cookie dough, make your own freshly-baked cookie creations, or take a class from our cookie school!&quot; the website heralds. They&apos;ll even serve you a scoop of raw cookie dough <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170906001929/http://www.grubstreet.com/2017/01/do-greenwich-village.html?mid=full-rss-grubstreet">in an ice cream cone</a>. We probably don&apos;t deserve this. </p>
