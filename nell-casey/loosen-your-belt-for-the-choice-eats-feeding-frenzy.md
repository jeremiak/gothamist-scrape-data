<p>The foodiot gorgefest known as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429083634/http://choiceeats.villagevoice.com/2014/">Choice Eats</a> returns for its seventh year on March 25th, bringing a bunch of hip and lesser-known outer borough restaurants together under one roof for an evening of overindulging. Each year we <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429083634/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/20/the_five_best_things_we_ate_at_the.php#photo-1">attend the insanity</a> and each year we leave with our top pants button undone; it&apos;s an occupational hazard. This year they&apos;ve upgraded their venue from the rather dour 69th Regiment Armory to the shiny courts of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429083634/http://basketballcity.com/bbc.php?city=newyork&amp;page=homepage">Basketball City at Pier 36</a>, which boasts an enormous deck overlooking the East River. </p>

<p>The diabolical calorie demons at the Village Voice have yet to reveal the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429083634/http://choiceeats.villagevoice.com/2014/">full lineup</a> but an early preview includes veggie delights from Dirt Candy, South African dishes from Kaia Wine Bar, smoked meats from Fletcher&apos;s Brooklyn Barbecue and sweet treats from Robicelli&apos;s. Also on hand, food fest stalwarts like Luke&apos;s Lobster, The Meatball Shop, Jimmy&apos;s No. 43 and Red Hook Lobster Pound. There&apos;s also plenty of booze at these things, though specifics haven&apos;t been revealed yet.</p>

<p>As with all of these packed out tasting events, it&apos;s good to go in with a game plan to maximize the munching and cut down on the inevitable struggle as the venue fills up. We&apos;ve <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429083634/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/28/six_tips_for_actually_enjoying_food.php">been over this territory before</a>, but here&apos;s the basic gist:</p>

<ul>
<li>Arrive early and be in the front of the line. (Baller version: get VIP tickets)</li>
<li>Hit up the super trendy spots first if you&apos;re into that kind of thing (anything with the word &quot;lobster&quot; in the name is going to go fast)</li>
<li>On the flip side, don&apos;t be distracted by &quot;name&quot; restaurants; some of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429083634/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/14/six_scrumptious_offerings_from_last.php#photo-1">best bites</a> we&apos;ve had have been from a restaurant that wasn&apos;t covered to death in the press. Keep an open mind and you&apos;ll be rewarded.</li>
<li>While it&apos;s tempting to make a beeline for the hooch, it&apos;s a better plan to load up on eats and then relax with a brewski or two (or three). You&apos;ll have made a nice base to enjoy all the alcohol and you won&apos;t be stuck trying to juggle a plate and a glass simultaneously.</li>
</ul>
