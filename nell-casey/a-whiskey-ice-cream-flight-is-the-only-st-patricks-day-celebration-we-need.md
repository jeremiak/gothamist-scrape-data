<p>New York City takes St. Patrick&apos;s Day <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170218084718/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/10/nyc_st_patricks_day_parade_guide.php">very seriously</a>, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170218084718/http://www.oddfellowsnyc.com/">OddFellow&apos;s</a> Ice Cream, the ice cream shop run by former wd~50 pastry vet Sam Mason, takes ice cream very seriously&#x2014;in the most whimsical way possible. There&apos;s a convergence of ice cream and St. Paddy&apos;s launching at the Williamsburg shop beginning tomorrow, combining a few of our favorite things: holidays, ice cream and booze.</p>

<p>The parlor is offering whiskey ice cream &quot;flights&quot; that&apos;ll be on the menu until the end of April. For $10 they&apos;ll scoop you three different types of alcoholic ice creams, including one selection modeled after the Dead Rabbit&apos;s Irish Coffee, made with Clontarf 1014 Irish Whiskey. The next, a flavor made with Knappogue Castle 12 year single malt Irish Whiskey, and, finally, a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170218084718/http://littlebooboobakery.com/">Little Boo Boo Bakery</a> burnt marshmallow ice cream taken full throttle with the addition of Knappogue Castle 12 year single malt. </p>

<p>Yes, these ice creams will <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170218084718/http://gothamist.com/2015/05/26/drunk_desserts_roundup.php">get you drunk</a>. </p>
