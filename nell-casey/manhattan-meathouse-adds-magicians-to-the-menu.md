<p>While our idea of restaurant magic means we were able to get the waiter&apos;s attention, it turns out you can get your steak with a side of actual sleight of hand this month. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151031005917/http://www.atasteofmagicnyc.com/index.html">Taste of Magic</a> brings the illusions table side at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151031005917/http://benandjackssteakhouse.com/5th-ave-menu/">Ben &amp; Jack&apos;s Steak House</a> on Friday, July 26th, where a group of magicians perform while you nosh on dinner at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151031005917/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/17/excuse_me_google_what_is_a_midtown.php">NoMad</a> steak house. </p>

<p>In between each course, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151031005917/http://www.atasteofmagicnyc.com/performers.html">one of the entertainers</a> camps out at your table, performing sleight of hand, card tricks and even <em>mind reading</em>. &quot;Yes I <em>would</em> like another cocktail! Damn you&apos;re amazing!&quot; When you aren&apos;t being entertained by the enchantments, you&apos;ll be dining on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151031005917/http://www.atasteofmagicnyc.com/menu.html">B&amp;J;&apos;s fare</a>, including entree options like Filet Mignon Medallions, Shrimp Scampi or a Roasted Half Chicken. A special bar will be setup in the dining room, but sadly alcoholic alchemy isn&apos;t included in the ticket price. </p>

<p>As for the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151031005917/http://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/417101">tickets</a>, they&apos;ll set you back $65, which includes the show, a three course meal and tax. The group offers two seating times, at 5 p.m. and at 8 p.m., with plenty of time to catch the train home &quot;for our bridge and tunnel friends.&quot; If you don&apos;t catch them this time around, the troupe performs about twice a month at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151031005917/http://www.gossipbarnyc.com/">Gossip</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151031005917/http://www.letoutvabien.com/">Tout Va Bien</a>, but sadly not at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151031005917/http://arresteddevelopment.wikia.com/wiki/Gothic_Castle">Gothic Castle</a>.</p>
