<p>Dreams really will <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170909174058/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/13/is_grand_prospect_hall_the_dr_zizmo.php">come true</a> for worshippers at the altar of Eggs Benedict this March when <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170909174058/http://brunchcon.com/">BrunchCon</a>, a food festival devoted to brunch, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170909174058/http://gothamist.com/2015/08/27/grand_prospect_hall_tour.php#photo-1">takes over Grand Prospect Hall</a>. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170909174058/http://gothamist.com/2015/08/27/grand_prospect_hall_tour.php#photo-30">ornate ballrooms</a> that presided over so many weddings will now look on as attendees feast on chicken and waffles and get plastered on mimosas. This <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170909174058/http://gothamist.com/2015/08/27/grand_prospect_hall_tour.php#photo-6">taxidermied pheasant</a> looks worried, tbh. </p>

<p>Organizers are promising over 50 of NYC&apos;s &quot;hottest brunch restaurants,&quot; which so far includes spots like Bricolage, Butter &amp; Scotch, Midnights, Cafe Grumpy, Beast of Bourbon and Black Swan. Even those <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170909174058/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/31/big_mozz_sticks_chicago_beef_sandwi.php#photo-4">fully loaded egg waffles</a> from Wowfulls will be there. Seems like a missed opportunity for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170909174058/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/30/project_brunch_staten_island.php#photo-1">NYC&apos;s first brunch-only restaurant</a>, but maybe they&apos;re trying not to dilute the brand.</p>

<p>The Convention <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170909174058/http://laist.com/2016/03/30/brunchcon_is_a_thing.php">debuted in Los Angeles</a> last summer, with 2,500 attendees, so organizers claim. It seems unlikely there&apos;s capacity for that many at Grand Prospect Hall&#x2014;even with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170909174058/http://gothamist.com/2015/07/23/grand_prospect_hall_beer_garden_1.php#photo-1">the beer garden</a>&#x2014;but there are lots of nooks and crannies in that place.</p>

<p>One of the nooks will be housing a &quot;Hangover Lounge&quot; for guests to &quot;enjoy a dark room and hair-of-the-dog cocktails.&quot; There&apos;s also an open mimosa bar, which should help facilitate some connections in the Speed Dating area of the event. Say <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170909174058/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/24/the_only_good_brunch_is_a_dead_brun.php">what you want</a> about sceney brunch restaurants in NYC, but none of them ever tried to make you feel less alone.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170909174058/https://www.seetickets.us/event/BrunchCon-NYC/339944">Tickets</a> are in the early bird phase at the moment, so you can score GA for $55 and VIP for $90. Prices go up after February 15th, so if you want to commit to a cheaper future champagne hangover, the time is now.</p>
