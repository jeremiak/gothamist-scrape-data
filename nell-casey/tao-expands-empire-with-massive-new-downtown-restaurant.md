<p>If supping on sushi to the blaring beats of house music sounds like your kind of scene, you&apos;ll be thrilled to know that Tao restaurant opens another outpost of their Pan-Asian dynasty this evening. Dubbed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504140554/http://taorestaurant.com/downtown/">Tao Downtown</a>, the sprawling 22,000 square foot restaurant boats seating for 400 beneath the Maritime Hotel in the two spaces that previously house Hiro Ballroom and Matsuri.</p>

<p>Executive Chef/Partner Ralph Scamardella changed up the menu from the Midtown location, offering a variety of dim sum (chicken gyoza, crispy bao buns, veggie egg rolls), noodles, yakitori and other small plates. Entrees include dishes like Pan Roasted Halibut, Beef Mongolian and Roasted Chicken Chow Mein plus maki of King Salmon with jalapeno and Glazed Tuna with Wild Mushrooms. </p>

<p>Given the hefty price tag&#x2014;you can&apos;t get a sushi roll for under $16 or an entree for under $28&#x2014;this might be more of an expense account joint rather than a regular Saturday night on the town.</p>

<p><em>92 Ninth Avenue, (212) 888-2724; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504140554/http://taorestaurant.com/downtown/">taorestaurant/downtown</a></em></p>
