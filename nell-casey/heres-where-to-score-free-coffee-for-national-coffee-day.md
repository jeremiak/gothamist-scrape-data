<p>We don&apos;t need a &quot;day&quot; to celebrate coffee&#x2014;the world&apos;s most life-giving legal drug&#x2014;but we have one, and with it comes opportunities for a free buzz. This Thursday is National Coffee Day (following quickly on the heels of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021115415/https://foodimentary.com/september-holidays/">National Drink A Beer Day</a>, coincidentally) and the big chains and other notable shops are doing their best to inject caffeine into your bloodstream; get it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021115415/http://gothamist.com/2016/09/22/coffee_climate_change.php">while you still can</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021115415/http://birchcoffee.com/locations/flatiron/">eight NYC outlets</a> of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021115415/http://birchcoffee.com/">Birch Coffee</a> will make Thursday&apos;s morning commute a little more animated with free drip coffee for customers between 7 a.m. and 10 a.m. The Bronx-born chainlet roasts their own beans in Long Island City so they&apos;re super fresh and potent.</p>

<p>For just $1 you can get a hot classic drip or iced coffee at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021115415/http://ingoodcompanyhg.com/trademark/">Trademark Taste + Grind</a> and some samples of their Double Chocolate Chip Cookies all day from the opening bell at 7 a.m. In the evening, they&apos;re debuting coffee slushies ($6), which can be fortified with alcohol for an additional $2. </p>

<p>NoMad&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021115415/http://www.blankslatenyc.com/">Blank Slate Coffee + Kitchen</a> has joined forces with coffee bean roaster <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021115415/https://www.devocion.com/">Devocion</a> to offer complimentary coffee tastings in honor of the holiday. Swing by between 2 p.m. and 5 p.m. to sip on two blends and learn more about coffee production. In addition, 100% of coffee sales on the day will be donated to non-profit organization <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021115415/http://www.coffeekids.org/">Coffee Kids</a>, which helps support coffee farming families in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021115415/http://gothamist.com/2016/09/22/coffee_climate_change.php">these challenging times</a>.</p>

<p>In case you didn&apos;t know, Martha Stewart <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021115415/http://www.marthastewartcafe.com/">owns a coffee shop</a> on West 26th Street, where they&apos;ll give you a free hot cup of Martha Stewart Blend coffee until 4:30 p.m. or while supplies last.</p>

<p>Latte art&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021115415/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/28/rainbow_latte_video_whoa.php">pretty big at the moment</a> and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021115415/http://www3.hilton.com/en/hotels/new-york/new-york-hilton-midtown-NYCNHHH/index.html">New York Midtown Hotel</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021115415/http://www.illy.com/wps/wcm/connect/en/home">Illy</a> are showcasing &quot;celebrity barista artist&quot; Michael Breach&apos;s work on Thursday with a complimentary latte art session. From 11 a.m. to 3 p.m., Breach&apos;ll be taking requests and handing out gratis cups of milky coffee in the hotel&apos;s lobby.</p>

<p>In Dumbo, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021115415/http://usagi.com/ny/">Usagi&apos;s</a> doing discounted brews all day, selling 8 ounce cups for $1 and 12 ounce cups for $2. When&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021115415/https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/usagi-ny-dumbo-7?select=ZqHqtKTg5YuAqSk-kNwOxA">National Matcha Day</a>? </p>

<p>Good ole <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021115415/https://www.dunkindonuts.com/dunkindonuts/en/stores.html">Dunkin Donuts</a> has been slinging its superior chain coffee and slightly disappointing donuts for 66 years. To mark the occasion, they&apos;re pouring cups of their signature hot brew for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021115415/http://news.dunkindonuts.com/news/cheers-to-66-years:-dunkin-donuts-celebrates-national-coffee-day-by-offering-medium-hot-coffee-for-only-66-cents">just 66 cents</a> on Thursday. In previous years, they&apos;ve offered free cups, but what they lack in freebies they <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021115415/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/17/interactive_map_here_are_all_the_st.php">make up for in volume</a>. </p>

<p>You&apos;re really getting the most for nothing at Krispy Kreme, who in addition to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021115415/http://krispykreme.com/Events/NationalCoffeeDay">giving away a small coffee</a> will also hand you a free Original Glazed doughnut. Too bad that involves a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021115415/https://www.google.com/maps/place/Krispy+Kreme/@40.7497,-73.9922,19z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0xd7ede3fe95961df7">trip to Penn Station</a>.</p>
