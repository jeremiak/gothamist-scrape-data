<p>The pizza battle being waged in Dumbo is escalating with a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141027185358/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/slicing_off_pizza_the_pie_SHV2P7h67zKBn6WqH04yGO">lawsuit filed by displaced Grimaldi&apos;s owner Frank Ciolli</a> against 81-year-old pizzaiolo Patsy Grimaldi. Millions of obedient, guide-book following tourists are holding their breaths as the matter comes before a Queens judge today. To refresh your memory, last November Grimaldi&apos;s was forced to move from its original location after a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141027185358/http://gothamist.com/2010/11/03/grimaldis_countersuing_landlord.php">rent dispute</a> with its landlord. Just a week later it was announced that pizza king and original Grimaldi&apos;s owner Patsy Grimaldi would be returning to Brooklyn to open his own pizza joint, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141027185358/http://gothamist.com/2012/09/07/patsy_grimaldis_new_brooklyn_pizzer.php#photo-1">Juliana&apos;s, in the </a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141027185358/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/25/pizza_shocker_grimaldis_is_being_re.php">former Grimaldi&apos;s space</a>. </p>

<p>According to the Post, back in September&#x2014;just days after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141027185358/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/25/pizza_shocker_grimaldis_is_being_re.php">signage went up</a> for the new pizza parlor&#x2014;Ciolli filed an injunction against Patsy and his wife Carol to prevent them from opening Juliana&apos;s. According to Ciolli, the new joint would create &quot;unfair competition&quot; for Grimaldi&apos;s, which is now located up the block to 1 Front Street. Unfortunately for Ciollo, the non-compete clause he signed after purchasing Grimaldi&apos;s from Patsy in 1998 expired three years go. </p>

<p>The lawsuit is expected in court at some point today and we&apos;ll update when we hear any new information.</p>
