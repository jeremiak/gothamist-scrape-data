<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170401080053/http://www.chefsclub.com/new-york-city/about/">Chef&apos;s Club</a>, the restaurant that welcomes chefs from around the globe to contribute signature dishes, expands this Friday with the opening of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170401080053/http://www.chefsclubcounter.com/">Chefs Club Counter</a>, a &quot;fine-fast,&quot; counter service restaurant with a similar conceit. The 56-seat cafe will open for breakfast, lunch and dinner, offering meals from locally and nationally renowned chefs&#x2014;but Shake Shack-style.</p>

<p>The space kind of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170401080053/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/28/dining/enrique-olvera-atla-chefs-club-counter.html">looks</a> like a really fancy waiting room at a train station, but instead of tracks and timetables you&apos;ve got an open kitchen and ever-changing menus. Customers order at the counter then find one of the 56 seats to wait for their order to be ready. </p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="032917aldea.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170401080053im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_nellcasey/032917aldea.jpg" width="640" height="449"> <br> <i> Duck rice (Chefs Club Counter)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>The opening roster includes Alvin Cailan&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170401080053/http://laist.com/2013/11/08/egg_slut_opens_in_grand_central_mar.php">LA super hit</a> Eggslut, which will be Cali-splaining BECs with offerings including the Fairfax sandwich (scrambled eggs with chives, cheddar, caramelized onions and sriracha mayo on a brioche bun) and a new dish called SoHo Salmon. They&apos;ll also be making their signature &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170401080053/https://www.instagram.com/p/BRbOSNzDW40/?taken-by=eggslut&amp;hl=en">Slut</a>,&quot; a coddled egg on top of potato puree in a jar. This is going to be the big draw, so...camp out now or something.</p>

<p>Lunch and dinner options will include duck rice from George Mendes (Aldea), the JG Burger by Jean-Georges Vongerichten, Roman pizza by Magnus Hansson, and a sandwich by Eric Kayser.</p>
