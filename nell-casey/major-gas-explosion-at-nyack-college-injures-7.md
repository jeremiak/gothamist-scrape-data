<p>Multiple people were injured this afternoon following what appears to be a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130811055500/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2013/06/04/authorities-multiple-people-trapped-in-explosion-in-nyack/">major gas explosion at Nyack College</a>. CBS 2 reports that windows and doors were blown out and seven people were injured, including one individual who was thrown out a window from the blast. </p>

<p>Most of the injuries appear to be minor, stemming from broken glass and splintered wood, but two people were taken to the hospital with flash burns.</p>
