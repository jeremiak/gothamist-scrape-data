					<p>This Friday morning at 7:45 a.m. the new <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170402033633/http://www.chefsclubcounter.com/">Chefs Club Counter</a> flings opens its doors in SoHo, and while the lineup of contributing chefs will be a solid addition to the local food scene, it&apos;s really <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170402033633/http://gothamist.com/2017/03/29/chefs_club_counter.php">all about Eggslut</a>. The Los Angeles-based egg sandwich restaurant is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170402033633/http://laist.com/2013/11/08/egg_slut_opens_in_grand_central_mar.php">hugely popular</a> on the West Coast; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170402033633/http://laist.com/">LAist</a> describes the daily scene as &quot;comically mobbed,&quot; noting that the lines are &quot;long AF&quot; and that the place &quot;consistently has the longest line (by far) at its Grand Central Market&quot; location. All of this is to say that it&apos;s bound to be a <em>huge</em> hit when it (temporarily) opens in NYC.</p>

<p>The restaurant&apos;s owner and chef Alvin Cailan has strong ties to NYC, having spent summers here as a kid visiting family in Harlem and in Jersey City. His connection to the city inspired him to create the NYC-specific &quot;SoHo Salmon&quot; sandwich, which debuts Friday alongside his proven hits the &quot;Fairfax&quot; and &quot;Slut&quot; (more on those two later). </p>

<p>&quot;My vivid memories of breakfast in New York City are two things: an egg and cheese, salt and pepper, ketchup, from a cart or a bodega&#x2014;or Russ &amp; Daughters,&quot; Cailan told Gothamist at a Thursday morning friends and family preview. &quot;When I was asked to do a menu here, I didn&apos;t want to do a bacon, egg and cheese because you can get that at bodegas, you can get a sausage, egg and cheese anywhere now. I wanted to do an Eggslut rendition of an actual Russ &amp; Daughters bagel sandwich.&quot;</p>

<p>The bread component of the sandwich took a lot of trial and error, including tests involving bagels, bialys, kaiser rolls and even a brioche bun with bagel toppings. Ultimately, Cailan settled on a bun by Eric Kayser. &quot;It honestly changed the way I thought of milk buns, because his milk buns are soft and fluffy. It&apos;s everything that you want in a runny yolk sandwich, because it sucks everything up.&quot;</p>

<p>The local smoked salmon is dressed in a sauce modeled after fromage blanc, a fresh French cheese. Cailan makes his with mayonnaise, sour cream and a little bit of cream cheese for that bagel flavor profile. Instead of capers, the sandwich comes with pickled mustard seed for a &quot;burst of flavor,&quot; alongside relish pickle, onions, chives, salt and havarti cheese. And a sunny side up egg, of course.</p>

<p>&quot;This is a New York sandwich,&quot; Cailan proclaims. &quot;This is what I&apos;d love to eat on the side of the street like I do at Russ &amp; Daughters.&quot;</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="033017slut2.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170402033633im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_nellcasey/033017slut2.jpg" width="640" height="427"> <br> <i> (Nell Casey/Gothamist)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>Eggslut&apos;s &quot;Fairfax&quot;&#x2014;a crazy messy combo of scrambled eggs with chives, cheddar, caramelized onions and sriracha mayo on a brioche bun&#x2014;is also on offer during Chefs Club Counter&apos;s breakfast hours, as is their signature &quot;Slut&quot; creation. A coddled egg (super runny, barely cooked) is nestled atop a creamy potato puree, then topped with gray salt and chives with toasted baguette. Compared to the other two ingredient-packed sandwiches, this is the dish that really lets the flavor of the egg shine through.</p>

<p>Asked about the potential mob scene that could descend on the restaurant tomorrow, Cailan said he wasn&apos;t nervous, just excited, but conceded that a restaurant opening doesn&apos;t always run smoothly.</p>

<p>&quot;There&apos;s gonna be problems, people are going to wait, that&apos;s just the nature of the restaurant beast,&quot; he says. &quot;There&apos;s no such thing as a restaurant that&apos;s firing on all cylinders when they open, that just doesn&apos;t exist.&quot;</p>

<p>For now, Eggslut has a three-month residency inside the new Spring Street cafe, but Cailan isn&apos;t coy about his future on the East Coast. &quot;If we kill it, who knows, there might be an Eggslut New York flagship.&quot;</p>

<p><em>Chefs Club Counter opens Friday morning at 7:45 a.m. at 62 Spring Street; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170402033633/http://www.chefsclubcounter.com/">chefsclubcounter.com</a></em></p>
