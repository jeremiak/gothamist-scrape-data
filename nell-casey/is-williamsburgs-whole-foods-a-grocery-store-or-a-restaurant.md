<p>When it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025124702/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/27/whole_foods_williamsburg_1.php">opens later this month</a>, the Williamsburg outpost of Whole Foods will embrace the neighborhood&apos;s love of convenience foods and dining out with a solid lineup of local and new eateries. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025124702/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/13/lukes_tail_cart.php">lobster on a stick</a> from Luke&apos;s Tail Cart was previously announced, but looks like local favorites No. 7 and OddFellows Ice Cream will also be on the docket come July 26th. There will also be a poke station, a vegan/paleo parfait stop, and a restaurant and tap room that &quot;[pays] homage to Williamsburg&#x2019;s storied roots.&quot; </p>

<p>The theme at the N4 restaurant will be Jewish delicatessen, serving dishes like Fried Matzo Balls, Pastrami Hash &amp; Eggs and a vegetarian Portobello Pastrami with roasted, spice-rubbed mushrooms, pickled green tomato spread, red mustard greens and crispy onions on marbled rye. Gribenes, crispy chicken skins, feature prominently on the menu in an appetizer with smoked sea salt and caramelized onion dip and in a GLT sandwich with lettuce, tomato and mayo on marbled rye. Sweets from Lilly&#x2019;s Homestyle Bake Shop are also on offer.</p>

<p>No. 7 will be bringing their popular vegetarian spread to the market, fresh off a temporary stint at Urbanspace Vanderbilt. The Double Decker Broccoli Tacos made the cut, as did the restaurant&apos;s dope veggie burger, the Total Vegetarian Chaos &amp; Destruction with avocado, pickled beers, vegan cheddar, No. 7 steak sauce and onions, among other sandwiches.</p>

<p>East Coast Poke, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025124702/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/28/poke_explainer_guide_nyc.php">serving the trendy raw fish dish</a>, Kikka Sushi and a pizza option employing Gotham Greens basil and a new baked sandwich option complete the robust dining program. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025124702/http://gothamist.com/2014/07/17/brooklyn_fried.php">fried bologna sandwiches</a> and self-loathing kale salads arrive in phase two.</p>
