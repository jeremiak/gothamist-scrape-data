<p>Just days after receiving some <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508124216/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/20/peace_deal_reached_in_mcdonalds_sta.php">positive press</a> for a change, McDonald&apos;s returns to the headlines with allegations of assault at one of their Brooklyn locations. The Post tells the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508124216/http://nypost.com/2014/01/22/suit-mcdonalds-cashier-slugged-me-over-sandwich/">harrowing tale</a> of a mother who was allegedly punched in the face by a cashier at the fast food joint after demanding cheese for her son&apos;s Happy Meal hamburger. This is what you get for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508124216/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/07/dad_denies_son_mcdonalds_gets_d.php">being a good parent</a> these days.</p>

<p>After receiving the wrong meal, Giu Ying Shi complained to cashier Marisol Acosta, at which point Acosta &quot;starts cursing at her, calls her stupid, [and] said, &apos;You need to learn to speak English,&apos;&quot; according to Shi&apos;s lawyer Lawrence Glynn. Acosta then allegedly threw a punch at Shi&apos;s face. &quot;Knockout! Knocks out a tooth,&quot; Glynn stated in the Brooklyn Supreme Court Trial. Defense attorney Michael Stonberg claims the act was more of a &quot;lunge or a slap&quot; though it &quot;goes without saying that Marisol Acosta was not authorized to get into an altercation with a customer.&quot;</p>

<p>The franchise owners immediately fired Acosta, but Shi is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508124216/http://www.courts.state.ny.us/courts/ad2/calendar/webcal/decisions/2013/D39254.pdf">suing the franchise anyway</a>, claiming that they&apos;re liable for the incident since none of the managers intervened to prevent the attack. So it goes. Sadly, our McDonald&apos;s have a history of violence, including a cashier <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508124216/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/14/video_mcdonalds_cashier_beats_custo.php">beating a customer with a metal rod</a> and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508124216/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/29/fight-friendly_village_mcdonalds_to.php">infamously rowdy West Village outpost</a>. Perhaps it&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508124216/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/13/the_disgusting_depressing_truth_beh.php">something in the food</a>?</p>
