<p>New York City welcomed 2017 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170519002114/http://gothamist.com/2017/01/01/photos_times_square_rings_in_new_ye.php#photo-1">with a bang</a> and a cry as the city&apos;s newest residents made their way into the world.</p>

<p>It&apos;s looking like the city&apos;s first new baby of 2017 was born at Flushing Hospital in Queens, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170519002114/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/New-Year-New-Babies-First-of-2017-Arrives-Early-Sunday-409115315.html">NBC reports</a>. Little <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170519002114/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2017/01/01/nyc-first-baby-2017/">Nathan Peralta</a> was born at 12:08 a.m., a 7 pound, 11 ounce native New Yorker.</p>

<p>Arriving shortly after at Jacobi Medical Center in the Bronx was baby Melanie, born just a minute later at 12:09 a.m., weighing 6 pounds, 9 ounces. </p>

<p>A third child, Jacob, waited until 2:51 a.m. to make his debut at New York-Presbyterian Brooklyn Methodist Hospital.</p>

<p>Reports indicate Boston may have welcomed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170519002114/https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2017/01/01/beth-israel-deaconess-medical-center-gets-early-start-with-birth-minute-into-new-year/RLQcOZHCNMVH7dZzV52kEK/story.html">one of the earliest</a> 2017 births with a little girl born at 12:01 a.m. </p>

<p>Regardless of who won the birthing race, all of these children are blessed not only with life but with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170519002114/http://gothamist.com/tags/2016">no memory of 2016</a>.</p>
