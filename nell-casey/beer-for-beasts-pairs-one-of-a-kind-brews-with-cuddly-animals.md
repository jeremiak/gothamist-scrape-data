<p>Lovers of unique beer and adorable fuzzy beasts should take note of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110084440/http://www.beerforbeasts.com/#main">Beer For Beasts</a> event coming to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110084440/http://www.thebellhouseny.com/">The Bell House</a> next weekend on October 15th. The annual event&apos;s all about specially-brewed beers, drinking said beers, and raising money for the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110084440/http://www.humanesocietyny.org/">Humane Society of New York</a>. These are practices Gothamist supports in full.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110084440/http://sixpoint.com/">Sixpoint Brewery</a> has tapped over 20 collaborators for the event, including breweries, venues and food makers (like the Mexican Chocolate Stout with Ample Hills Creamery). Each has come up with a one-time-only beer created specifically for the event; once the keg&apos;s kicked, it&apos;s all over. </p>

<p>As ringleaders, Sixpoint&apos;s not just collaborating with all the other breweries, they&apos;re also bringing over a dozen of their own signature creations, each made by a different member of the team&#x2014;even the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110084440/https://www.facebook.com/sixpoint/photos/a.109929429061663.26875.108885472499392/1146706278717301/?type=3&amp;theater">sales team</a>! A few of their speciality brews include an oatmeal stout brewed with mint and spruce; a brett saison with cucumber, ginger and mint; and a lemon-basil gose. </p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="100516beasts.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110084440im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_nellcasey/100516beasts.jpg" width="640" height="335"> <br> <i> (Humane Society of New York)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>The beautiful beasts above are the kinds of beneficiaries from the event (keep this in mind as you <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110084440/https://www.eventbrite.com/e/beer-for-beasts-tickets-26972875597?aff=facebook">part with $70</a> for your ticket). Entrance into either session (1 - 5 p.m. or 6 - 10 p.m.) includes unlimited samples of the beers (&apos;til the lines run dry) and some grub from Calexico, DUB Pies, PizzaMoto and others. Unfortunately, your own cuddly pets aren&apos;t welcome, but if you&apos;re in the market for a new pal, the Humane Society will be on hand to guide your toward your new furever friend. </p>
