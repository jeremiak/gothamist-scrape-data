<p>Until this afternoon, we didn&apos;t know we were living in a world were Xtreme Competitive Pogo Stick&apos;ing (unofficial title) was a thing, or perhaps we just <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130728075754/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/25/step_right_up_see_more_nsfw_pics_of.php">knew it by another name</a>. But it turns out extreme pogo is a legitimate sport and this weekend the city plays host to the 10th Annual World Championships of Xpogo, aka <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130728075754/http://www.xpogo.com/pogopalooza/">Pogopalooza</a>. It&apos;s the largest interactive pogo stick event in the world, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130728075754/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/05/we_win_everything_nyc_is_the_most_c.php">naturally</a>, with top Xpogo athletes competing in the three main pogo disciplines: Big Air, Best Trick and High Jump. </p>

<p>The spring-loaded action kicks off tomorrow, where Pro Xpogo Athletes from all over the globe hold &quot;pop-up exhibitions at key landmarks around the city,&quot; so keep an eye out for pogo action near you. On Saturday the open qualifiers take over Tompkins Square Park from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m. plus the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130728075754/http://www.xpogo.com/records/">13 Xpogo World Records</a> competition, where athletes try to break records like Most Consecutive Backflips on a Pogo Stick and Highest Jump on a Pogo Stick. The main event comes to Union Square on Sunday between 1 p.m. and 5 p.m., where finalists compete for bronze, silver and gold medals in the pogo disciplines. </p>

<p>Throughout the weekend, reps from pogo companies are offering demos and you can ride any stick (heh) in the Free Jump area. The idea of bouncing around the city on a stick sounds fun, to be sure, but after watching these extreme pogo folks in action, we&apos;ll just take our chances on a Citi Bike.  </p>
