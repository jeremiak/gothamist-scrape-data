<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028110558/http://gothamwestmarket.com/">Gotham West Market</a>, one of the many <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028110558/http://gothamist.com/2015/11/10/guide_to_nyc_food_halls.php">food-driven halls</a> to open in recent years, will be expanding into Brooklyn this year with the opening of Gotham Market at The Ashland. The new offshoot will open this fall inside The Ashland, a new luxury residential building, a stone&apos;s throw from BAM and the Barclays Center in Fort Greene. The 16,000-square-foot market will have seven full-time food vendors including a pop-up place for local chefs and restaurateurs.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028110558/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/18/best_ramen_nyc.php">Exemplary and inventive</a> Queens restaurant Mu Ramen will be the market&apos;s main attraction, serving bowls of noodles plus burgers and Japanese snacks. Apizza Regionale and Flip BIrd, a rotisserie chicken spot, will be run by Dinosaur Bar-B-Que founder John Stage, in addition to a third property not-yet announced. Finally, Midtown&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028110558/http://www.masonjarny.com/">Mason Jar</a> expands to the borough, bringing brisket, bourbon and beer.</p>

<p>The first chef for the pop-up space hasn&apos;t been announced yet, neither has the name for the &quot;convivial bar&quot; that&apos;s set to be the focal point of the operation. </p>
