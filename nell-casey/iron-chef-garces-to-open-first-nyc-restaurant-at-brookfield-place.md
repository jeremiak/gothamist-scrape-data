<p>Things are shaping up with the $250 million renovation at Brookfield Place (n&#xE9;e World Financial Center), slated to open at some point in 2015. Philadelphia-based Iron Chef Jose Garces just announced he&apos;ll make his NYC restaurant debut at the Financial District dining and shopping center. According to the release, the James Beard award-winning chef says it&apos;s &quot;long been a dream&quot; of his to open a restaurant in the city and found his opportunity with the new complex.</p>

<p>The Ecuadorian-born chef hasn&apos;t released many more details about the restaurant save that it&apos;ll be open &quot;morning, noon, and well into the night&quot; with a &quot;lively outdoor dining&quot; area. Garces joins a lineup of notable NYC institutions occupying the six restaurant spaces and food court-style space dubbed Hudson Eats. Parm gets a full service restaurant while Dos Toros, Umami Burger, Blue Ribbon Sushi and almost a dozen other quick service spots are slated for kiosks in the space. </p>

<p>Eater has a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407184703/http://ny.eater.com/archives/2014/03/hudson_eats_at_brookfield_place.php">great overview</a> of the impending culinary destination, including word on the 25,000 square foot French market called Le District opening later this year and other details about the complex. </p>
