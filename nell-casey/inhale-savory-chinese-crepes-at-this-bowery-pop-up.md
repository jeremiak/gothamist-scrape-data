<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170102015118/http://openhouse.me/168-bowery/">Old Bowery Station</a> has been host to dozens of food-related pop-ups over the years, from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170102015118/http://gothamist.com/2014/11/07/fries_of_new_york.php#photo-1">french fry explainers</a> to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170102015118/http://gothamist.com/2015/01/14/kimchi_smoke_pop_up.php">Korean-Southern barbecue</a> and now, it&apos;ll host <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170102015118/http://www.mr-bing.com/">Mr. Bing</a>, serving jianbing, Chinese savory crepes. The pop-up operates as a preview for an NYC outpost of the eatery; owner Brian Goldberg operated two Mr. Bing&apos;s in Hong Kong and has done a few preview pop-ups in NYC recently. &quot;Jianbings were my favorite street-food when I lived in China and I&#x2019;ve been thinking about opening a Bing restaurant in New York for the past 10 years,&quot; Goldberg said in the announcement of the event.</p>

<p>Goldberg describes his &quot;Bings&quot; as a take on the Beijing jianbing or &quot;street crepes,&quot; which have their own unique components in different parts of China. For his, Goldberg employs things like marinated Peking duck, BBQ pulled pork and bacon-cheese to accompany the traditional stuffings including vegetables, some kind of chile paste and fried wonton skins. To create the crepe itself, mung bean and white flour are mixed with egg then cooked on a flat griddle. </p>

<p>The menu each day of the pop-up will be different, but expect the Peking Duck Ping and a Kalbi Short Rib Bing to make appearances. Mr. Bing will operate daily from 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. through March 31st. <em>168 Bowery at Kenmare</em></p>
