title: Panic! At The Grocery: NYers Are Stripping Shelves Bare As Blizzard Approaches
---

	
										<p>New Yorkers are a hearty bunch, able to navigate <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170713183737/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/22/video_parents_find_new_way_to_embar.php">flashmobs</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170713183737/http://gothamist.com/2015/07/13/pedestrian_etiquette_nyc.php">tourists</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170713183737/http://gothamist.com/2014/10/10/used_condom_subway.php">subway condoms</a> with grace and aplomb. But present them with a weather situation that could threaten their 24/7 access to everything under the sun and shit gets real quick.</p>

<p>News reports would <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170713183737/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/21/de_blasio_de_blizzard_2016.php">seem</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170713183737/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/21/watch_this_blizzard_closely.php">to</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170713183737/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/21/mta_hardware_snow_war.php">indicate</a> some inclement weather may be heading our way, and the runs on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170713183737/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6zaVYWLTkU">bread and milk</a> have begun!</p>

<p>Hope everyone on Staten Island is paleo for the New Year...</p>

<p>Others are getting philosophical, musing on our culture&apos;s propensity towards conspicuous consumption. Still, better to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170713183737/http://gawker.com/the-donner-party-didnt-think-they-needed-to-prepare-for-1754319568">be prepared</a>.</p>

<p>Over in Bed-Stuy, reporter <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170713183737/https://twitter.com/scottheins">Scott Heins</a> just wanted some blueberries and syrup for pancakes, man, but instead found the store in full-cart mode. One woman claimed she was &quot;just feeding a family!&quot; when questioned about her cart, laden with classic storm staples including bread, milk and...a giant vat of cooking oil.</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="012216famcart.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170713183737im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_nellcasey/012216famcart.jpg" width="640" height="488"> <br> <i> (Scott Heins/Gothamist)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>Frozen pizza, Kraft singles and saltine crackers. Classic storm foods.</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="012216familycart2.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170713183737im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_nellcasey/012216familycart2.jpg" width="640" height="480"> <br> <i> (Scott Heins/Gothamist)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>The owner of this cart must be aiming for sainthood. My storm prep includes making sure I have a full bottle of cheap whiskey and at least two boxes of Annie&apos;s mac &amp; cheese. Oatmeal bread, cilantro, frozen sweet potato, yogurt and nuts? GTFO.</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="012216healthy.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170713183737im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_nellcasey/012216healthy.jpg" width="640" height="480"> <br> <i> (Scott Heins/Gothamist)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>And finally, this hero of measured practicality. &quot;This is definitely storm prep,&quot; he said. &quot;And there&apos;s a football game Sunday, so we gotta be prepared for that.&quot;</p>
