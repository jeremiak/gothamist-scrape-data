<p>Thank goodness for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170112051146/http://chopsticksandmarrow.com/">Joe DiStefano</a> for turning us on to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170112051146/http://gothamist.com/2014/05/12/diy_dumplings_flushing.php">yet</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170112051146/http://gothamist.com/2016/05/31/korean_bbq_speakeasy_flushing.php">another</a> amazing food find, this time <em>not</em> in his beloved Queens. It&apos;s to the Lower East Side we go for what&apos;s arguably the best upgrade on a classic: the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170112051146/http://chopsticksandmarrow.com/2016/08/russ-daughters-brings-babka-ice-cream-sandwiches-to-the-les/">babka ice cream sandwich</a>. </p>

<p>The sweet sandwich creation has been at the OG <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170112051146/http://www.russanddaughters.com/">Russ &amp; Daughters</a> and their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170112051146/http://gothamist.com/2014/05/08/photos_the_long-awaited_russ_daught.php#photo-1">Orchard Street cafe offspring</a> since December, the appetizing shop tells us. But ice cream sandwiches are wasted on winter; it&apos;s August now and we&apos;re going to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170112051146/http://gothamist.com/2016/08/10/hot_steamy_sweaty_sticky.php">drown in our own sweat</a> so the time is now to stuff our faces with this cold confection.</p>

<p>Two slices of their homemade chocolate babka flank a hockey puck of their homemade chocolate babka ice cream. Charmingly, it&apos;s served in the same paper that&apos;s used to wrap the shop&apos;s fish. They are $7 each. Go be one with god.</p>
