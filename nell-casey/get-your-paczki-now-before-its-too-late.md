<p>Today isn&apos;t just Fat Tuesday, people, it is also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429171955/http://paczkiday.com/">P&#x105;czki Day</a>! And while we&apos;re sure you already have plans to celebrate Mardi Gras by getting ripped at a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429171955/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/21/happy_fat_tuesday.php">New Orleans-style event</a>, why not lay down a good foundation and load up on some traditional Polish p&#x105;czki before the drinking? </p>

<p>P&#x105;czki are doughnut-like pastries whose dough is a mix of eggs, lard and sometimes dairy, creating a uniquely rich and chewy texture. If that weren&apos;t enough, after a trip to the fryer each p&#x105;czki is stuffed to bursting with creamy custard or sticky jam and then topped with icing or sugar. Although p&#x105;czki are traditionally eaten on Fat Thursday in Poland, Polish Americans indulge in the fried fitters on Fat Tuesday before the Lent celebration begins on Ash Wednesday. These sweet treats are extremely popular and many bakeries sell out quickly! We&apos;ve called around to find out where you can still find some to gorge on before you give up all your vices for Lent.</p>

<p><strong>Northside Bakery</strong> in Williasmburg still has p&#x105;czki available and at an absolute steal for only $.85 each. This bakery prides itself on all handmade breads and pastries made without preservatives or additives. P&#x105;czki are available here both drizzled with icing or liberally doused with powdered sugar.</p>

<p>The heavily Polish influences of Greenpoint are known to everyone with an addiction to pierogi, so it comes as no surprise that you can find some of the city&apos;s most traditional p&#x105;czki here. <strong>Star Deli &amp; Bakery</strong> has been frying up p&#x105;czki for years in their small Nassau Avenue shop. Here the jam flavors rule, like the tart raspberry topped with sugar, and are available for just $.90. Dunk in a hot cop of coffee to fuel up for a night of excesses.</p>

<p>Queen&apos;s bakery <strong>Rudy&apos;s Pastry Shop</strong> is known for their wide selection of specialty cakes but don&apos;t discount their every day pastries and, of course, their p&#x105;czki, which are available in both custard and jam varieties. They&apos;re the most &quot;expensive&quot; of the bunch, ringing up to $1.25 each, but that&apos;s a small price to pay for a historic neighborhood bakery still making things the old-fashioned way.</p>

<p>One usually doesn&apos;t think of doughnuts when a store touts itself is a &quot;meat market,&quot; but mainstay <strong>East Village Meat Market</strong> serves up a tasty and affordable p&#x105;czki. Although the store is run by a Ukrainian family, their version of p&#x105;czki ($1) is sure to satisfy any discerning p&#x105;czki-hound and their house-made kobasa sausage would make a nice meal for anyone looking to fill up before going out. </p>
