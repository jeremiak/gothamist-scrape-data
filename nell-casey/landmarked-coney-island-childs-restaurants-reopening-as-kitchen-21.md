					<p>The food group responsible for the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170615220749/http://gothamist.com/2017/04/05/yankee_stadium_food_2017.php#photo-1">dining options at Yankee Stadium</a> debut a multi-concept restaurant and bar Saturday inside the landmarked Childs Restaurants on Coney Island. Plans have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170615220749/http://gothamist.com/2012/08/22/coney_islands_landmarked_childs_res.php">been in the works</a> for years to refurbish the long-vacant space, which sits directly on the boardwalk adjacent to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170615220749/http://fordamphitheaterconeyisland.com/">Ford Amphitheater</a> and nearby to the amusement parks and Aquarium.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170615220749/http://www.legends.net/">Legends Hospitality</a> will operate <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170615220749/http://www.kitchen-21.com/">Kitchen 21</a>, an umbrella term for the five distinct dining operations in the building. There&apos;s a takeaway operation called The Caf&#xE9;, a raw bar and beer bar called Community Clam Bar, and a rooftop bar with small plates and local wine called Boardwalk &amp; Vine. </p>

<p>Coney Island&apos;s famed Parachute Jump attraction&#x2014;which, though inoperable since 1964, was refurbished in 2013&#x2014;inspires The Parachute Bar section of the restaurant. Expect 32 draft craft beers along with more cans and bottles, plus wine and cocktails crafted from local spirits. They&apos;ve even got one of the Jump&apos;s seats on display and the Jump is visible through the windows of the restaurant.</p>

<p>Finally, the Test Kitchen promises to be &quot;an outlet for culinarians to develop and experiment with new dishes and food concepts&quot; and an opportunity to &quot;experience that latest in food and wine trends and meet local BK celebrity Chefs, as well as culinary stars from across New York City.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170615220749/http://gothamist.com/2017/01/09/this_is_the_end_my_friend.php#photo-1">Unicorn lattes</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170615220749/http://gothamist.com/2015/06/15/sushi_burrito_fine_whatever.php">sushi burritos</a> coming right up.</p>

<p>Though it sounds like there will be some menu shifting depending on the time of year (the restaurant will be open year-round), expect beachy fare like a Surf &amp; Turf Prime Blend Burger, White Clams Casino Pizza, and &quot;The&quot; Lobster Roll (emphasis theirs). </p>
