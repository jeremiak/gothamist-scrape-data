										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="011916fuku.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20161217170424im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_nellcasey/011916fuku.jpg" width="640" height="505"> <br> <i> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161217170424/http://momofuku.tumblr.com/post/137627606883/starting-this-evening-fuku-will-now-be-available">Tumblr</a>)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>David Chang&apos;s plans for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161217170424/http://gothamist.com/2015/03/16/david_chang_fried_chicken.php">total fried chicken domination</a> are progressing at a timely clip. In June, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161217170424/http://gothamist.com/2015/06/10/david_chang_fried_chicken_1.php">first fuku opened</a> in the East Village, followed quickly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161217170424/http://gothamist.com/2015/09/10/david_chang_fuku_midtown.php">by a fuku+ Midtown location</a> and now, a coveted spot among the fleet who make up Madison Square Garden&apos;s food vendors. David Chang and MSG: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161217170424/http://www.buzzfeed.com/johnmahoney/the-notorious-msgs-unlikely-formula-for-success#.nl0d7Q99oK">together at last</a>! </p>

<p>The stand will serve a limited menu of fuku&apos;s spicy fried chicken sandwich, fries and milk bar cookies, enough to service sports and concert-goers certainly. It&apos;ll be in the SAP Madison Concourse, which is around the main floor level of the arena, so those of us who routinely opt for nosebleed seats are in for a bit of a walk. </p>

<p>Chang isn&apos;t the only name chef to operate concessions at MSG&#x2014;Andrew Carmellini and Jean-Georges beat him to it&#x2014;but Chang&apos;s operation seems more fully-realized since the original location wasn&apos;t created as arena dining. With these credits so far, Chang looks to be embarking on a Danny Meyer-esque journey to high quality fast food on a large scale. </p>

<p>Between this and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161217170424/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/11/pennsy_penn_station_msg_eats.php#photo-1">The Pennsy</a>, it&apos;s also a lot less stressful to think about dining pre-and-during an event around the Garden. Just <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161217170424/http://gothamist.com/2015/06/29/msg_meat_morrissey.php#photo-1">shield your eyes, Morrissey</a>, and focus in on Cinnamon Snail down the street.</p>
