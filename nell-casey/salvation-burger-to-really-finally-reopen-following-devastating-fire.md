<p>There was a brief moment in September when it seemed as if the reopening of April Bloomfield&apos;s Salvation Burger was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171028204608/http://gothamist.com/2016/09/30/salvation_burger_returns.php">imminent</a>. Rumors swirled that the restaurant would be opening as early as October following a fire that &quot;severely damaged&quot; the kitchen back in May. </p>

<p>It was not to be, alas, but October&apos;s loss is December&apos;s gain, as word&apos;s come down the pike that Salvation will officially return next Monday. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171028204608/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/10/salvation_burger_april_bloomfield.php">spendy $25 burgers</a>&#x2014;along with their $17 siblings&#x2014;are back on the menu for lunch and dinner beginning December 5th, joined by the veggie burgers, dogs and sides.</p>

<p>Bloomfield&#x2014;who runs popular gastropub Spotted Pig, in addition to a collection of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171028204608/http://gothamist.com/tags/aprilbloomfield">other NYC eateries</a> with business partner Ken Friedman&#x2014;has kept busy in Salvation Burger&apos;s downtime opening her <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171028204608/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/26/white_gold_butchers.php#photo-1">new UWS eatery White Gold</a>.
