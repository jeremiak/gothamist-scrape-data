title: Brooklyn Brewery Won't Be Quitting Williamsburg Anytime Soon

										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="102916bkbrew.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170122220234im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_gdelvalle/102916bkbrew.jpg" width="640" height="427"> <br> <i> (Brooklyn Brewery)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>Unlike the L Train (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170122220234/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/13/l_train_tunnel_closure_years.php">RIP</a>), Brooklyn Brewery won&apos;t be ditching Williamsburg after all. The brewery <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170122220234/http://gothamist.com/2016/05/16/brooklyn_brewery_brooklyn_navy_yard.php#photo-1">had plans</a> to be an anchor tenant in the developing Brooklyn Navy Yard&apos;s Building 77, with a proposed rooftop beer garden and production facility, but has since pivoted thanks to the goodwill of their Williamsburg landlords. That&apos;s a phrase I never thought I would type.</p>

<p>Brooklyn Brewery founder Steve Hindy <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170122220234/http://brooklynbrewery.com/blog/brewery-expansion/home-sweet-williamsburg/">revealed</a> that two of the brewery&apos;s three landlords expressed interest in keeping the brewery on as a tenant past its 2025 lease expiration date. This hopefully puts to rest <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170122220234/http://gothamist.com/2015/04/17/brooklyn_brewerys_williamsburg_ware.php">any rumors</a> that the brewery would be ousted from its longtime home on North 11th Street, where they&apos;ve been brewing up Brooklyn Lager since 1990.</p>

<blockquote>[Last year], the deBlasio Administration signaled it was going to limit commercial development in the IBZs [Industrial Business Zone], requiring developers to include manufacturing businesses in their projects. Suddenly, two of our three landlords announced they were open to extending our leases in Williamsburg. (Our third lease is a warehouse across the street from the brewery; it is not in the IBZ. It is in a mixed-use zone. That means it will likely be developed for housing or commercial uses.)</blockquote>

<p>&quot;Our leases don&#x2019;t expire until 2025,&quot; Hindy continued. &quot;And we are hopeful that we will be able to extend them way beyond that year.&quot; The company has yet to announce whether they&apos;ll be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170122220234/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/29/brooklyn_brewery_staten_island.php">abandoning Staten Island</a> for cheaper digs upstate for their new facility. </p>

<p>The &quot;Brooklyn&quot; branding&#x2014;while perhaps growing a bit stale in New York City&#x2014;has a huge impact overseas, where the brewery continues to grow in popularity.<br>
 <br>
&quot;We&#x2019;ve got this rip-roaring export business,&quot; Hindy <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170122220234/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/19/nyregion/brooklyn-brewery-williamsburg.html?_r=2">told the Times</a>, noting that their international business may soon eclipse their domestic business. Anyone else thinking <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170122220234/http://gothamist.com/tags/trump">now</a> is the perfect time to open a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170122220234/http://gothamist.com/2017/01/09/this_is_the_end_my_friend.php#photo-1">Williamsburg-inspired</a> cafe in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170122220234/http://gothamist.com/2015/11/04/paris_brooklyn_same_thing.php#photo-1">France</a>?</p>

<p>It turns out the Brooklyn Navy Yard isn&apos;t at all upset about being abandoned by the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170122220234/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/12/kirin_brewery_brooklyn_brewery.php">internationally-recognized</a> brand. </p>

<p>&#x201C;We&#x2019;re here for manufacturers that need long-term or reduced-cost space to stay or grow in New York City. When a company like Brooklyn Brewery has a path to stay in its own private space, it&#x2019;s an opportunity for the Navy Yard to support other emerging businesses,&quot; Navy Yard CEO David Ehrenberg said in a statement. &quot;We&#x2019;ve had overwhelming demand by food and beverage manufacturers to be part of Building 77&#x2019;s food hall, and we look forward to combing through the waitlist to fill out the space and open next year.&quot;</p>

<p>The Brooklyn Navy Yard still counts Russ and Daughters, Mast Brothers and  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170122220234/http://gothamist.com/2017/01/09/food_hub_brooklyn_navy_yard.php">other local food businesses</a> as tenants for its forthcoming food hall. </p>
