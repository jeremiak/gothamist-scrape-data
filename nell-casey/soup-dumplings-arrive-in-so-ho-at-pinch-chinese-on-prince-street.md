</div></div>					<p>Consider the delightful numbing effects of the m&#xE1;l&#xE0; pepper flavoring dishes of mapo tofu and dan dan noodles from China&apos;s Sichuan province. And what about the unctuous and succulent Dong Po Pork Belly flavored with wine, a common Hangzhou dish? Or the unique, garlic-strewn Wind Sand Chicken, common in the restaurant markets of Hong Kong. Their commonality? They&apos;re all on the menu at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170324214521/http://www.pinchchinese.com/">Pinch Chinese</a>, a new restaurant in SoHo.</p>

<p>&quot;My family&apos;s background is pretty varied. Both my parents grew up in Taiwan, which is a melting pot from all over China,&quot; owner Sean Tang explains. &quot;In our family, we have Sichuan roots, as well as roots from other parts of China, so the food we ate was a mishmash. My own life experience was having the greatest hits of China, and that&apos;s why when [co-owner and cousin Tony Li] and I started talking about this, we wanted the restaurant to be this way.&quot;</p>

<p>The duo brought on Charlie Chen, a veteran of Taiwanese chain Din Tai Fung, to run the Prince Street restaurant&apos;s kitchen. Chen&apos;s background as Din Tai Fung&apos;s executive chef makes him more than proficient at many dishes, but his xiao long bao are of particular note, and the team expresses their pride through the purses&apos; prominence on the menu and the window into the dumpling-making kitchen provided in the dining room.</p>

<p>Pinch offers three different types of soup dumplings, from the common pork ($10) or seafood and pork ($12), plus one made with chicken ($10). They&apos;re dainty and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170324214521/https://www.instagram.com/p/BQmBAIjgswi/?taken-by=nellcasey">quite adorable</a>, a far cry from the larger, doughier versions found at Chinatown spots like Joe&apos;s Shanghai. They&apos;re served with vinegar, soy sauce and ginger, which diners can mix to their specifications (the restaurant recommends half and half of the two liquids). </p>

<p>Though dishes like Niman Ranch Cumin Ribs ($18), Dan Dan Noodles ($15) and other assorted dumplings like the steamed Fish Dumplings ($12) are excellent, the XLB have been by far the most popular item on the menu since the opening a few weeks ago.</p>

<p>&quot;It&apos;s not rare for a night for a table, or two or four, to end on soup dumplings for dessert,&quot; reveals general manager Miguel de Leon.</p>

<p>De Leon also handles the restaurant&apos;s wine and beer program. For the former, he says he&apos;s &quot;using wine as a secondary ingredient, treating it like a sauce more than a pairing,&quot; with an emphasis on varieties (merlot, in particular) over regions. For the beer, he&apos;s chosen mostly lighter beers like wheats, sours and gose. &quot;Acidity matches the flavors of the food we present,&quot; he explains.</p>

<p>For cocktails, Joseph Shoup also considers ingredients in the food as part of his creations. He &quot;stole&quot; kitchen ingredients like Sichuan peppercorns and cumin for his drinks like the one inspired by Lapsang Souchong tea, with pimento bitters, Sichuan peppercorns and scotch. </p>

<p>Everyone&apos;s particularly excited about the restaurant&apos;s design, which includes an up-front &quot;lounge&quot; area for walk-ins looking for a quick drink and a dumpling. When the weather&apos;s nice, the whole front can be opened to the elements for people-watching. </p>

<p>&quot;These neighborhood institutions all have that similar approach to creating a destination for SoHo people&#x2014;or for people who are just visiting SoHo&#x2014;to be able to take a moment, take a breath, enjoy the city you&apos;re living in and see it unfold in front of you,&quot; Tang concludes. &quot;That&apos;s what we aimed for with our restaurant, because that&apos;s what SoHo demands.&quot;</p>
