The train element recently became the focal point of a summer chefs residency called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170606212422/https://mckittrickhotel.com/events/mckittrick-club-car/">The Club Car</a>, which debuted at the beginning of June.</p>

<p>Chefs Lee Hanson and Riad Nasr, who were co-executive chefs of Balthazar and Minetta Tavern, designed a surf and turf-style menu for the pop-up to match the redesigned space, which includes seating in 1930s-inspired train cars.</p>

<p>&quot;The menu is inspired by our mutual love and appreciation of the popular steak joints that used to dot Manhattan, like Beefsteak Charlie&apos;s, combined with the brilliant simplicity of French chophouses such as Le Relais de Venise L&apos;Entrec&#xF4;te,&quot; according to Nasr. &quot; The seafood combinations draw from our beloved New Orleans, France, and even South America, while the vegetable sides are all about the season.&quot;</p>

<p>The duo&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170606212422/https://mckittrickhotel.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/menu-2.pdf">menu</a> starts with crudit&#xE9;, Parker House rolls in a cast iron skillet, and a choice of soup or salad. A 10oz. cut of dry-aged Boneless Ribeye can be coupled with a choice of seafood (scallops with romesco butter, soft shell crab with ramp butter, razor clams oreganato or, for an extra $10, broiled lobster) or a double down on the meat (&quot;turf &amp; turf&quot;) with oxtail and bone marrow. Old Bay fries, a rotating seasonal vegetable, and a choice of dessert (lemon chiffon cake or chocolate caramel tart) round out the meal. </p>

<p>The whole shebang only costs $65 per person, a crazy bargain considering the meat alone at many steakhouses <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170606212422/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/03/the_8_best_classic_restaurants_in_n.php">easily exceeds that number</a>. Hanson and Nasr will be offering their menu through Labor Day weekend.</p>

<p><em>The Club Car is located inside The McKittrick Hotel at 542 West 27th Street, 212-564-1662; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170606212422/https://mckittrickhotel.com/events/mckittrick-club-car/">mckittrickhotel.com</a></em></p>
