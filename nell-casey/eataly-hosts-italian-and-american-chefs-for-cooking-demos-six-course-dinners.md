<p>American chefs and their Italian counterparts are teaming up once again for the fourth annual Identita New York, a three day series of cooking demonstrations and fancy dinners taking place in early October at Eataly. Mario Batali, Daniel Boulud and Sara Jenkins are a few of the chefs representing the States with Massimo Bottura, Mauro Uliassi and Davide Scabin a few of the Italian consortium. Over the weekend, chefs put on demos focused on specific food items like tomato and cheese. Chefs Batali and Scabin will present a demo around pasta, while chefs Boulud and Bottura are highlighting the humble egg. Each demo lasts for one hour and includes samples of the two dishes created as well as wine pairings.</p>

<p>In addition to the demos, the chefs are throwing two big, six-course dinner parties to celebrate their collaboration. Friday night, Del Posto chef Mark Ladner takes over the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131014083923/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/26/check_out_eatalys_new_rooftop_beer.php#photo-14">lovely Birreria space</a> with other Italian chefs each preparing a course plus sweets from Eataly pastry chef Katia Delogu; Saturday it&apos;s Fortunato Nicotra from Felidia leading the charge. We&apos;ve attended past dinners and can confirm the delicious food and merry atmosphere. They&apos;re not stingy with the wine, either, so you&apos;ll more than get your money&apos;s worth between the world class chefs and free flowing booze. </p>
