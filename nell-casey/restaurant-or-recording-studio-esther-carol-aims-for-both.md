					<p>It&apos;s not enough to simply be a restaurant anymore. The space must also house a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170615222710/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/26/white_gold_butchers.php#photo-1">butcher shop</a> or a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170615222710/http://gothamist.com/2017/04/26/raw_mkt_hawaiian_greenwich_village.php#photo-1">grocery store</a> or a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170615222710/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/24/house_of_wax_alamo_drafthouse.php#photo-1">museum</a> or...a recording studio? That&apos;s the gimmick at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170615222710/http://estherandcarolnyc.com/">Esther &amp; Carol</a>, where there&apos;s dining upstairs and a mini music industry downstairs.</p>

<p>In its most recent past life the space housed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170615222710/http://hphnyc.com/">HPH/Peter Poulakakos&apos;s</a> restaurant <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170615222710/http://gothamist.com/2014/05/27/bacchanal.php#photo-1">Bacchanal</a>, which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170615222710/http://www.boweryboogie.com/2015/12/bacchanal-aborts-bowery-business-after-less-than-two-years/">closed in 2015</a> after less than two years in the former lighting district area of the Bowery. That enterprise <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170615222710/https://ny.eater.com/2015/3/12/8201211/bacchanal-downstairs-new-basement-bar-peter-poulakakos">also had a downstairs bar</a>, which debuted after the upstairs restaurant opened.</p>

<p>Kevin King, former maitre&#x2019;d at Balthazar and Narcissa, along with Cordell Lochin, worked with HPH to open this new venture. Executive Chef Eric Lapkin runs the kitchen, which offers an approachable-looking menu of tried-and-true classics like buttermilk fried chicken, a grain bowl, seared salmon and a proprietary burger. The Lobster Crab Cake ($16) with preserved lemon aioli and a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170615222710/http://www.cheese.com/la-tur/">La Tur cheese</a>-stuffed Tortellini ($19) with favas in a butter &quot;fondue&quot; sound interesting. </p>

<p>For the curious, that large wooden piece is a &quot;3D milled sculpture bar&quot; made from Spanish cedar that Antoni Gaud&#xED; would have appreciated. Downstairs there&apos;s a bar and space for the recording sessions, which can be video recorded or live-streamed. They&apos;ve also got Gibson instruments including the Les Paul Guitar and SG Guitar. </p>

<p>Once all the pieces of Esther &amp; Carol come together there will be three distinct operations: the restaurant, the downstairs venue, and a fast casual takeout window opening later in May.</p>
