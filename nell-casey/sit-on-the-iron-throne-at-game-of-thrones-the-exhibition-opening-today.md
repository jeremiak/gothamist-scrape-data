</div></div>					<p>While you have to wait until Sunday for the first episode of <em>Game of Thrones</em> season three, you can check out more than 70 original artifacts from the hit HBO show right here in New York City. Starting today and running through next Wednesday, April 3rd, the pop up <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510032248/http://game-of-thrones-exhibition.com/">&quot;Game of Thrones: The Exhibition&quot;</a> is open to the public in a storefront on 57th between Fifth and Sixth Avenues. The exhibition is completely free&#x2014;though we imagine waiting in the inevitable long lines might be more tedious than crossing the Red Waste&#x2014;and contains Daenerys Targaryen&apos;s dragon eggs, the Stark Family&apos;s Winterfell costumes, and assorted weapons (&quot;Ice&quot; and &quot;Longclaw,&quot; ofco), crowns and other props. </p>

<p>We got to check out the exhibition at a press preview last night and certainly had a great time&#x2014;though the open bar and cast member appearances probably helped (more on that later). The costumes and props are interesting to look at but we wish some more details had been available about how they were designed or which episodes or seasons they were used in. There&apos;s also the somewhat lame &quot;Blackwater Bay Interactive Experience,&quot; a virtual video game where you grab Bronn&apos;s bow and light the wildfire to set Stannis Baratheon&apos;s ships aflame as they arrive to sack King&apos;s Landing. As one staffer pointed out, &quot;It&apos;s kind of like Duck Hunt&#x2026;only easier.&quot; </p>

<p>The crowning jewel of the exhibit, however, is getting to sit on the motherfucking Iron Throne bitches hell yeah! Even casual <em>Game of Thrones</em> geeks are going to feel like total badasses getting their pictures taken on the throne, and best of all, they&apos;ll print out a hard copy for you right there so you can frame it and put it on your desk at work. You can also email yourself a copy for requisite Facebook/Instagram bragging. </p>

<p><em>Game of Thrones: The Exhibition is open March 28th through April 3rd at 3 West 57th Street. Weekdays 10 a.m. to 8 p.m.; Saturday 11 a.m. to 7 p.m.; Sunday 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.</em></p>
