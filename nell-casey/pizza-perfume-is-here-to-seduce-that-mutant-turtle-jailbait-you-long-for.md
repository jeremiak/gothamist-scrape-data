<p>Many have tried to recreate NYC&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150421221126/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/29/lower_east_side_fragrance_accuratel.php">unique odors</a> in wearable form&#x2014;some even attempt <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150421221126/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/01/new_fragrance_tries_to_capture_the.php">olfactory flattery</a> when trying to capture our special scent. But a new fragrance on the market comes at it from a different angle, creating a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150421221126/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/29/extra_extra_2807.php">pizza-scented perfume</a> that speaks to our deep-rooted pride over the best foodstuff the city has to offer. </p>

<p>Demeter, who created the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150421221126/http://www.demeterfragrance.com/773364/products/Pizza.html">Pizza cologne</a>, sent us a bottle to try out. If you&apos;ve ever wondered what you&apos;d smell like if you worked at Pizza Hut, this is it.</p>

<p>Gothamist co-founder <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150421221126/https://twitter.com/jenchung">Jen Chung</a> said she&apos;d &quot;rather move in above a pizzeria.&quot; &quot;It&apos;s like what living with the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles must smell like,&quot; quipped ex-tern <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150421221126/https://twitter.com/scottheins">Scott Heins</a>. But nobody had a stronger reaction than noted <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150421221126/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/24/patsy_grimaldi_doesnt_approve_of_yo.php">incorrect slice eater</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150421221126/https://twitter.com/yenbakas">Ben Yakas</a>:</p>

<blockquote>Crust. Slightly burnt. Few days old. The job is getting you down but you persevere. You haven&apos;t tasted anything but mozzarella and tomato sauce in months. You&apos;ve forgotten what the ocean smells like. The line between thin crust and thick crust seems monumental. Life is what happens when you&apos;re too busy smelling like pizza. Fin.</blockquote>
