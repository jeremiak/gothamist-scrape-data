<p>Many would argue that it&apos;s impossible to capture the essence of New York City in a single food item. But that has not stopped <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717104102/http://gothamist.com/tags/benandjerrys">Ben &amp; Jerry&apos;s</a>, who have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717104102/http://www.citychurned.benjerry.com/city/nyc/">launched an online and IRL voting system</a> so New Yorkers can help create a NYC-centric flavor. The company offers choices for possible base flavors and ingredients, including options from local vendors like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717104102/https://www.liddabitsweets.com/">Liddabit Sweets</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717104102/http://www.spoonablellc.com/">Spoonable Caramels</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717104102/http://sixpoint.com/">Sixpoint Brewery</a>. But they&apos;ve left the flavor decision-making to the fans, sort of.</p>

<p>Their ambitious selection system includes tracking subway trains that arrive at the station on time (HA!) to decide between waffle cone pieces or Spoonable Caramel; tallying up baskets at a pickup basketball game on West 4th Street for brownies versus marshmallows; and photos tagged on Instagram as #highline or #centralpark for Littlebit Sweets or Yellow Cake Pieces. They&apos;ll also mark recycling bins with caramel and fudge for a &quot;Spoon Ballot&quot; when their Scoop Truck parks around town. </p>

<p>We don&apos;t doubt that the good folks at B&amp;J; know what they&apos;re doing when it comes to good ice cream (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717104102/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/26/ben_jerrys_apologizes_for_lin-sanit.php">most of the time</a>), but we&apos;d like to see these very &quot;New York&quot; flavors make their way to the voting booth:<br>
</p><ul><li>Capture the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717104102/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/27/its_back_maple_syrup_smell_reported.php">Mysterious Maple Syrup Smell</a></li><br>

<li>The pleasing combination of burnt grounds and too much sugar in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717104102/http://gothamist.com/2012/11/25/why_a_regular_coffee_means_coffee_w.php">Street Cart Coffee</a></li><br>
<li>Or maybe Salted Street Cart Pretzels</li><br>

<li>Make the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717104102/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/12/ben_and_jerrys_occupie_wall_street.php">OccuPIE Wall Street</a> flavor a reality</li><br>
<li>And finally, we could definitely get behind something, anything, with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717104102/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/26/best_candy_cocktail_recipe_artisana.php">Sour Power Straws</a></li></ul><p></p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717104102/http://www.citychurned.benjerry.com/city/nyc/">online polls</a> stay open until July 14th, so if you have a strong preference for Coffee and Peppermint Greek Frozen Yogurt With Caramel, Sixpoint Beer, Yellow Cake And Marshmallows, place your vote before then. </p>
