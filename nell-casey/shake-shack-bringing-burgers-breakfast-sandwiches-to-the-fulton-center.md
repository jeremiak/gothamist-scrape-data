<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021122812/http://gothamist.com/2014/11/09/photos_a_sneak_peak_at_the_gleaming.php#photo-1">great and powerful oculus</a> of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021122812/http://www.fultoncenternyc.com/">Fulton Center</a> will now gaze down upon the city&apos;s newest Shake Shack, which will debut inside the transit hub this Friday, July 15th. The enormous station, which links the 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, A, C, E, J, Z and R trains in addition to the PATH, is already home to NYC-based brands like Zaro&apos;s and national chains like Dunkin Donuts. Subway stations are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021122812/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/08/omfg_breakfast_tacos.php">the new</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021122812/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/19/turnstyle_boutique_columbus.php#photo-1">food halls</a>. When will they open up a Dos Toros in that long tunnel connecting the 1/2/3 at 7th Avenue to the F/L lines at 14th Street? Always get so hungry in there...</p>

<p>Hundreds of thousands of commuters flow through the hub daily and the new Shack is luring in early morning commuters with the promise of egg sandwiches. When they open at 7 a.m. it&apos;ll be to griddle up Sausage, Egg N&#x2019; Cheese; Bacon, Egg N&#x2019; Cheese and Egg N&#x2019; Cheese sandwiches until a straggler-friendly 10:30 a.m. After that, it&apos;s the usual burgers, dogs and chicken sandwiches until 11 p.m. daily. They&apos;ll serve beer and wine, too.</p>

<p>The location&apos;s special frozen custard concretes are FiDi Fudge (chocolate custard, fudge sauce, chocolate truffle cookie dough, cocoa and malt powder), the Cold Fashioned (vanilla custard, Doughnut Plant old fashioned glazed cake doughnut, salted caramel sauce and banana) and Choculus (vanilla custard, baked chocolate peanut butter crispy bar and marshmallow sauce). </p>

<p>There&apos;s already another Shack nearby in Battery Park City, a quick 10 minute walk away. Staten Island and the Bronx have yet to feel the Danny Meyer love.
