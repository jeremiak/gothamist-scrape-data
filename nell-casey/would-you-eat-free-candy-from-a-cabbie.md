                            <p>We all remember the childhood warning: Don&apos;t take candy from strangers! Well what if that &quot;stranger&quot; was actually your cabbie? The Daily News today profiles Mansoor Khalid, a NYC taxi driver who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130929034053/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/cab-a-sweet-ride-article-1.1175246?localLinksEnabled=false">stocks his cab full of sweet treats</a> that he offers to all his fares. Skittles, Nerds, Gobstoppers and other hard candies are spread along the back windshield ready to add a touch of sweetness to a bitter cab ride.</p>

<p>&#x201C;The New York life is not the easy life. People are depressed. I see a lot of people stressed sitting back there,&quot; explains Khalid, who knows first-hand just how difficult life can be. In April, Khalid&apos;s two-year-old son passed away after a long battle with heart disease. While he was caring for his son in the hospital, Khalid would often bring nurses and doctors coffee and desserts. &quot;They got so happy when in the middle of the night I gave every person coffee,&quot; he said. &#x201C;I was so nice to them and they were so nice to me.&#x201D; And thus the Candy Cab NYC was born. </p>

<p>Khalid began a Twitter account (@CandyCabNYC) to document his daily life as a confectionary cabbie and already his feed is littered with praise from delighted customers:</p>

<p>Until now Khalid has offered just hard candies and the like but a conversation on his Twitter feed yesterday brought up the question of chocolates: &quot;I will see couple of days how it will work, because winter is on the way. So I hope it will not melt,&quot; explained Khalid. &quot;I bought bunch kind of mini best quality chocolates, I will start with that Friday night.&quot; </p>

<p>So what say you, discerning taxi riders of New York City: </p>
