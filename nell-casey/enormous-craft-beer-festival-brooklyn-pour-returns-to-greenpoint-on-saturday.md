<p>Since debuting in 2000, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027170339/http://microapp.villagevoice.com/brooklyn-pour/2016/">Brooklyn Pour&apos;s</a> built itself up as one of the largest and most diverse craft (and non-craft) beer-drinking festivals in NYC. Last year, the fest outgrew the stately but constricted Skylight One Hanson for the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027170339/http://www.brooklynexpocenter.com/">Brooklyn EXPO Center</a>, a decidedly less historic venue but one that offered a little more glass-raising elbow room. This Saturday, the fest, which is even bigger this year, returns to the same Greenpoint space, with 125+ different beers and ciders from over 65 local, national and international breweries.</p>

<p>We enjoy seeking out the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027170339/http://gothamist.com/2015/09/28/5_best_nyc_craft_breweries.php">local talent</a> each year, from stalwarts like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027170339/http://brooklynbrewery.com/">Brooklyn Brewery</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027170339/http://sixpoint.com/">Sixpoint</a>, to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027170339/http://theflagshipbrewery.com/">Flagship Brewing Company</a> out of Staten Island and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027170339/http://www.kcbcbeer.com/">Kings County Brewers Collective</a> out of Bushwick. Check out the full lineup <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027170339/http://www.villagevoice.com/restaurants/check-out-all-of-this-years-brooklyn-pour-breweries-and-get-10-off-your-tickets-9106471">here</a>. Truthfully, it always starts off dignified and then devolves into whichever brewery has the shortest line. Don&apos;t make plans for later!</p>

<p>Gothamist advises eating a hearty meal prior to arrival, but they&apos;re debuting a new <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027170339/http://microapp.villagevoice.com/brooklyn-pour/2016/dininghall.php">&quot;Dining Hall&quot;</a> this year with food like raw oysters and clams, tacos and veggie burgers from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027170339/http://astorroom.com/">The Astor Room</a>. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027170339/http://microapp.villagevoice.com/brooklyn-pour/2016/tickets.php">Tickets</a> are still on sale for General Admission ($55, 3 p.m. - 6 p.m.) or VIP ($85, 2 p.m. to 6 p.m. plus swag and a special VIP section). </p>
