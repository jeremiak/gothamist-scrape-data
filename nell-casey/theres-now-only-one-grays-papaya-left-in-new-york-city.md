<p>It&apos;s a dark day for hot dogs in NYC with a troubling report that iconic dog stand Gray&apos;s Papaya has shuttered its Greenwich Village location. Eater got word <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428175537/http://ny.eater.com/archives/2014/01/good_lord_what_is_happening_to_grays_papaya_right_now.php">from a tipster</a> who took photos of crews dismantling the restaurant, including the glowing signs thats drew dog seekers like a light house to tubular meats. An unnamed employee at the UWS original confirmed the closure but left room for the possible &quot;revamp&quot; angle, but all signs point to the end of Recession Specials and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428175537/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/06/greenwich_grays_now_selling_dollar.php">dollar slices</a> on Sixth Avenue.</p>

<p>With this outpost gone and the Midtown Gray&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428175537/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/28/midtown_grays_papaya_closes_uws_get.php">dead since 2011</a> this leaves the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428175537/http://grayspapayanyc.com/">Broadway outlet</a> as the lone survivor of the Great Hot Dog Culling. Sure there&apos;s Papaya King, which actually predates Gray&apos;s Papaya, but there&apos;s just something about Gray&apos;s. Time to form a protective hot dog chain uptown.</p>
