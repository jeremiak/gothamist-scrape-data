</div></div>					<p>The term speakeasy has long since been co-opted by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504203725/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/17/inside_the_cash_bar_a_murray_hill_s.php#photo-1">over-eager publicists</a> desperate  to brand fledgling restaurants with some indie cred. But a venture that truly lives up to the title unfolded over the course of six weeks this spring inside one of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504203725/http://gothamist.com/2008/05/05/last_two_water.php">the NYC skyline&apos;s ubiquitous features</a>: the water tower. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504203725/http://www.theatlanticcities.com/arts-and-lifestyle/2013/05/water-tower-flair/5639/">Dan Glass, writing for <em>Atlantic Cities</em>, took a look inside</a> the secret space, which occupied a water tower in a Chelsea building that&apos;s currently under construction. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504203725/http://nightheronspeakeasy.com/">The Night Heron</a>, as it was dubbed, was the brainchild of N.D. Austin, whose urban exploration group <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504203725/http://wanderlustprojects.com/">Wanderlust Projects</a> have taken daring adventurers on illicit explorations of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504203725/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/04/photos_wanderlust_candyland_trespas.php#photo-1">the Domino Sugar Factory</a>, among other off-limits sites. </p>

<p>To get to this hidden oasis, would-be imbibers had to present their ticket, which came in the form of a pocket watch that was gifted to a lucky few. Guests were then herded through an obstacle course-like route which included a fire escape, crossing a &quot;chasm onto a low ledge&quot; and finally up a 20-foot ladder into the belly of the tower. Once through the trap door, guests found a &quot;candlelit wooden cylinder outfitted with a bar, drink tables, and chandelier, all made from upright piano parts.&quot; Revelers sipped &quot;aromatic amber&quot; cocktails and listened to live performances by the Hungry March Band and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504203725/http://gothamist.com/tags/amandapalmer">Amanda Palmer</a>. </p>

<p>From its inception in March, seven hundred lucky souls experienced the temporary watering hole. As to whether Austin and his collaborators will present The Night Heron is a different space in the future remains to be seen, but the website does offer a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504203725/http://nightheronspeakeasy.com/email.html">mailing list</a>, so that bodes well. Photography and Tweeting were verboten inside the tower, but here&apos;s some sick video of the raucous party that you weren&apos;t invited to:</p>
