<p>Behind the walls of a nondescript building in Harlem there lies a booze stash of the most epic proportions&#x2014;and it&apos;s all destined for the drain pipe. Inside the State Liquor Authority&apos;s evidence room at 317 Lenox Avenue, lowly tallboys of Budweiser share shelf space with costly bottles of Johnnie Walker Blue, all confiscated in busts carried out by the agency in the past two years. After submitting a Freedom of Information Law (FOIL) request to the agency, the Daily News <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140322022535/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/sate-hundreds-bottles-beer-wine-hard-liquor-evidence-room-harlem-article-1.1726157">got a peek behind the scenes</a> and spoke to an SLA worker about the processes by which the hooch ends up there.</p>

<p>The hundreds of bottles and cans end up in the fifth-floor room from sting operations with underaged buyers; the stash also includes products confiscated from unlicensed wholesalers. The &quot;evidence&quot; remains on shelves for about two years before they&apos;re ultimately <em>poured down the drain</em>. The hell? Even the NYPD <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140322022535/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/04/nypd_shows_photo_of_dozens_of_seize.php">auctions off the spoils of their stings</a>; why let perfectly good, unopened hooch intoxicate the sewer rats instead of tax-paying citizens?  </p>

<p>Some of those bottles must &quot;magically disappear&quot; into the bags of SLA employees, right? One employee says inspectors have nicked a bottle or two around the holidays to gift out, a notion the agency categorically denies. &quot;Claims of alcohol improperly taken from the evidence room are simply false,&quot; SLA spokesman William Crowley told the Daily News. &quot;All evidence obtained during SLA investigations are labeled, documented, tracked and stored in the SLA evidence room until the evidence is ultimately destroyed upon completion of the case, and are regularly audited for compliance.&quot; You guys are no fun at all. </p>
