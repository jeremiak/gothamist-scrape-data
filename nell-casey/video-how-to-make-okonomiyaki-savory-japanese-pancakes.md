<p>I&apos;m several stories up in an apartment in Hamilton Heights, standing in front of a makeshift kitchen set up in the living room. On the table, a pair of cutting boards and knives, an electric griddle and a small gas stove and lots of packages with labels that I&apos;m unable to read. Next to me is Aiko, a retiree from Japan who&apos;s one of many instructors with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021112804/https://www.leagueofkitchens.com/">The League of Kitchens</a>, a company that pairs immigrants with people eager to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021112804/http://gothamist.com/2015/09/15/best_cooking_classes_nyc.php">learn how to cook</a> food from around the world, and today, we&apos;re making pancakes.</p>
