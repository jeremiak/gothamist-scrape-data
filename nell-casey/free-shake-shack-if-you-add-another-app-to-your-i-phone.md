<p>If you can find some space between your Venmo, Uber and Instgram apps for one more, there&apos;s some free Shake Shack in it for you. The burger company announced a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170125165501/https://www.shakeshack.com/app">brand new app</a> today, joining other chains like Starbucks that introduced mobile ordering for streamlining and speed. Bonus: anyone who downloads the new app gets a free ShackBurger to redeem anytime between now and February 28th, 2017. </p>

<p>Excluded from this promotion are ballparks, stadiums...and airports. You couldn&apos;t help make that JFK experience a little better, Danny? Also excluded: Android and other mobile phone users. &quot;An Android version of the app is in development,&quot; they promise. Another point for Apple, we guess.</p>

<p>The app also includes things like nutritional information, Shake Shack&apos;s social media channels, and access to any promotions being run by the company. They&apos;ve also got a built-in feature that shows the line at the Madison Square Park Shake Shack, a bit of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170125165501/http://gothamist.com/2006/04/18/breaking_shake.php">old school NYC Shack history</a>. </p>
