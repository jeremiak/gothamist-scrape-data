					<p>&quot;I like to put things on the menu that I crave so that I always have something when I&apos;m like, &apos;Oh I didn&apos;t eat today!&apos;&quot; laughs Shanna Pacifico as we sit in front of a table hidden beneath plates bearing pimento cheese-lacquered burgers and mini cast iron skillets stacked with crisp pieces of fried chicken. Pacifico has recently signed on as the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170906011011/http://www.bkmag.com/2016/01/29/breaking-shanna-pacifico-is-part-of-an-extra-fancy-expansion/">new head chef</a> at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170906011011/http://www.extrafancybklyn.com/">Extra Fancy</a>, the Williamsburg haunt known for its seafood-centric menu and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170906011011/http://gothamist.com/2015/08/06/best_late_night_eats_nyc.php">late night attributes</a>. </p>

<p>Prior to her current kitchen, the chef was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170906011011/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/21/cozinha_latina_greenpoint.php#photo-1">leading the charge</a> at Greenpoint&apos;s Cozinha Latina, celebrating her Brazilian-American heritage with fresh and flavorful dishes the food world was buzzing about (the restaurant&apos;s owners have since reverted the space back to a boring bar, much to the neighborhood&apos;s detriment). So what&apos;s she up to now? Lobster Bisque Fries, for one thing.</p>

<p>&quot;I have this idea that people are interested in and flock to fat kid food&#x2014;and then who doesn&apos;t like poutine or disco fries?&quot; Pacifico says of the inspiration for the centerpiece entree of the recently launched brunch. The restaurant&apos;s popular lobster roll meant a backlog of lobster shells, which create a rich lobster stock; that&apos;s when Pacifico&apos;s creativity came into play. &quot;How do we use the lobster bodies from the lobster rolls in a way that&apos;s not just putting lobster stock or lobster bisque on the menu?&quot; </p>

<p>The dish&#x2014;which one can acquire at brunch for $18 or as a special on occasion during the week&#x2014;boils down to a mound of thick-cut fries doused in a savory lobster bisque, held captive in a ceramic dish. On top, a liberal scattering of lobster meat, including tender hunks from the claw. In the middle a poached egg, waiting to be pierced, and a final few spoonfuls of cheerful tobiko, flying fish roe. Decadent, dangerous and wholeheartedly delicious.</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="030316burger.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170906011011im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_nellcasey/030316burger.jpeg" width="640" height="427"> <br> <i> (Nell Casey/Gothamist)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>A revamped brunch program isn&apos;t the only thing Pacifico&apos;s new reign has ushered in. Some menu items&#x2014;like the restaurant&apos;s popular deviled eggs&#x2014;are staying put, but there&apos;s been some changing and expansion in other areas of the menu. The signature late-night patty melt may be eclipsed by the new DBL Patty Cheeseburger ($15), a messy, beefy stack of two patties glued with pimento cheese, pickles and caramelized onions on a Martin&apos;s potato bun. </p>

<p>Her Extra Fancy Fried Chicken ($14), perfumed with fried garlic and red onion and fresh chopped herbs, employs a corn starch batter that crisps up the skin without weighing down the entire proceedings. The Extra Fancy Hot Sauce, which they&apos;re hoping to bottle and sell at some point down the road, is her twist on a piri piri sauce and adds a bright accent to the dish without setting anyone&apos;s mouth aflame. On the milder end, Clam Chowder Croquettes ($8), a nod to some of the New England notes that play out on the menu.</p>

<p>Come spring, the restaurant will open up a large, new outdoor section that&apos;ll mean more opportunities for ingenuity and playing around with food. She wasn&apos;t ready to talk specifics, but Pacifico&apos;s aiming for some fun finger foods that&apos;ll set them apart from the rest. &quot;New York is completely saturated with restaurants and it&apos;s not necessarily how you stand out, it&apos;s just...why are they going to want to come here, and not there? And you know, if you try to do something a little differently, hopefully that helps.&quot;</p>
