<p>Employees of a Washington Heights Domino&apos;s claim they were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508124144/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2013/12/08/lawmaker-dominos-employees-were-fired-after-complaining-about-conditions/">fired from their delivery jobs</a> after complaining to management about unfair wages. Workers at the 181st street chain participated in last Thursday&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508124144/http://gothamist.com/2013/12/02/fast_food_walkouts.php">nationwide walkout</a> in solidarity with the country&apos;s underpaid fast food workers, which included <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508124144/http://gothamist.com/2013/12/05/photos_videos_fast_food_workers_pro.php">strong numbers of workers and supporters</a> in New York City. Following the walkout, delivery workers&#x2014;who are paid under $6 an hour and rely on tips to make a living wage&#x2014;were asked to work extended hours inside the restaurant but were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508124144/https://twitter.com/ydanis/status/409744880802738176">not offered increased hourly pay</a> for their time inside the store. After bringing the issue to management&apos;s attention, the 24 employees <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508124144/https://twitter.com/ydanis/status/409696810937352192">were fired</a>. </p>

<p>Yesterday, Assembly Member Gabriela Rosa and Councilman Ydanis Rodriguez joined a group of vocal activists in a rally outside the uptown chain, demanding that Domino&apos;s rehire the unjustly terminated employees. &#x201C;Having all these workers fired, not able to bring the food to their families, in part of a season when we are supposed to be able to give thanks and share with others, is really outrageous,&#x201D; said Rosa. The duo, along with other community leaders, will return to the chain at 6 p.m. this evening and every evening henceforth until the workers are rehired, according to a press release.</p>

<p>Workers and advocacy groups continue to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508124144/http://gothamist.com/2013/12/04/fast_food_workers_protest_today_str.php">ramp up protests and walkouts</a> to demand a living wage and the right to unionize, which would protect them from examples like this one at Domino&apos;s. &#x201C;The national fast food strikes have brought the industry&#x2019;s systemic mistreatment of its workers into the national spotlight, and we will continue to build momentum, continue to organize, until every employee receives the living wage of $15 wage that he or she deserves,&#x201D; Rosa continued. </p>

<p>Calls to Domino&apos;s were unanswered; we&apos;ll update if we hear back.</p>
