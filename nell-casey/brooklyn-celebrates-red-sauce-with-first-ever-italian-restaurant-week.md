<p>From the UES to Astoria, Malaysian cuisine to Chinese, the city is never short on Restaurant Weeks to highlight a particular cuisine, neighborhood or just our <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130926065906/http://gothamist.com/tags/restaurantweek">dense dining population</a>. So considering Brooklyn&apos;s rich Italian heritage, it&apos;s somewhat surprising that the borough hasn&apos;t taken the opportunity to celebrate that distinction, until now. The Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce announced their first ever <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130926065906/http://www.ibrooklyn.com/go_brooklyn/italian_restaurant_week.aspx">Italian Restaurant Week</a> to coincide with Italian American Heritage Month in October and Columbus Day on October 14th.</p>

<p>From October 10th through 17th, 39 Brooklyn restaurants are offering great deals on prix fixe lunches and dinners. Unlike the pricey options at the city-wide Restaurant Week, you&apos;ll be able to lunch at spots like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130926065906/http://www.luzzospizza.com/">Luzzo&apos;s BK</a> for pizza, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130926065906/http://www.marcopoloristorante.com/">Marco Polo Ristorante</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130926065906/http://www.ristorantevicolo.com/#!/page_home">Vicolo</a> for either $14.92&#x2014;a nod to Columbus, natch&#x2014;or $18 and dinner at newcomer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130926065906/http://www.broccolinonyc.com/">Broccolino</a> or stalwart <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130926065906/http://www.gargiulos.com/">Gargiulo&apos;s</a> for just $25 or $28. </p>
