<p>We still don&apos;t know <em>where</em> Anthony Bourdain&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504165144/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/09/bourdain_market.php">forthcoming international market</a> will make its landing but some new details about what will be inside have been unleashed. The chef turned TV host and his business partner Stephen Werthen <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504165144/http://www.departures.com/slideshows/the-food-hall-revolution/10">chatted with Departures</a> about the food market&apos;s philosophy, telling them they weren&apos;t &quot;interested in the usual suspects&quot; and that the design would be &quot;authentic and theatrical but not Disney-like.&quot; </p>

<p>Bourdain had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504165144/http://ny.eater.com/archives/2014/01/anthony_bourdain_is_planning_a_massive_nyc_food_market.php">already revealed</a> he was interested in bringing &quot;street food and hawkers legends from around the world&quot; and it looks like that&apos;s still part of his model. The market will have &quot;40 to 50 single-concept stalls selling one to two specialities&quot; and be divided into three sections. One would be Asian-inspired with chefs from Singapore and Malaysia cooking family dishes; the next would be street food from around the globe like tostadas from a cart in Ensenada, Mexico and barbecue from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504165144/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/31/brisket_town.php">meat man</a> Dan Delaney. Finally, a &quot;spotlight&quot; section will highlight a new city or region every three to four months.</p>

<p>&#x201C;We want you to be able to enjoy expertly sliced Iberico ham and some Cava or Kuching-style laksa [soup], Chinese lamb noodles, Vietnamese pho or a decent barbecue brisket all in one place,&quot; Bourdain explained to the magazine. &quot;Most importantly, made by the very best people in each specialized area.&#x201D; Dishes will be priced between $5 and $25 and the seating will be communal. </p>
