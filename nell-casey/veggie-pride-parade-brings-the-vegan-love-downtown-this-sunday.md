<p>Watch your backs, carnivores, because the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508123218/http://www.veggieprideparade.org/">6th Annual Veggie Pride Parade</a> marches to the no meat beat this Sunday, March 24th. The celebration of all things vegan and vegetarian begins with a procession from the <strike>Meathead</strike> Meatpacking District&#x2014;which, fittingly, is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508123218/http://gothamist.com/2012/08/24/meatpacking_districts_meatpacking_n.php">less meaty these days</a>&#x2014;to Union Square, where a variety of pro-veg <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508123218/http://www.veggieprideparade.org/dept/bios.htm">speakers</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508123218/http://www.veggieprideparade.org/dept/exhibitors.htm">exhibitors</a> and other activities are scheduled to take place. </p>

<p>Anne Dinshah of the American Vegan Society and Joan Wai of Green Compassion are both confirmed speakers; also on hand are representatives from PeTA, No. American Vegetarian Society and the Vegetarian Resource Group. At 2 p.m. the annual costume contest begins, with a range of big gift certificates to local vegetarian restaurants&#x2014;Candle Cafe, Gobo, Loving Hut and others&#x2014;in store for the winners. Whether you win or lose, free veggie snacks will be available to anyone who swings by Union Square North on Sunday afternoon. Don&apos;t miss it&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508123218/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/09/cinnamon_snail.php">Cinnamon Snail is going to be there</a>!</p>
