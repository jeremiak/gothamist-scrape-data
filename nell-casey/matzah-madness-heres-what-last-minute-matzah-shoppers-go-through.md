</div></div>					<p>New York City&apos;s chosen people don&apos;t mess around when it comes to the matzah! Intrigued by the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509230005/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/21/video_learn_how_your_passover_matzo.php">fascinating process behind making matzah</a>, Gothamist decided to embark on a matzah taste test of all the city&apos;s best unleavened bread today. But like a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509230005/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/25/5_tips_for_goys_attending_their_fir.php">goy at her first Passover</a>, we didn&apos;t realize what the scene would actually be like at the city&apos;s most venerable matzah-making establishments. </p>

<p>Curious matzoh-hunter <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509230005/https://twitter.com/marc_yearsley">Marc Yearsley</a> was on hand at Kehilath Yakov Bakery and Satmar Shmura Hand-Matzoh Bakery and provided the following insight:</p>

<blockquote>At Kehilath Yakov, I saw about 10 men go into the open basement hatch and could see even more jammed down there, so I followed. In the basement is where much of the dough manipulation was going on. From what I could tell it was where they were stretching out the matzo, and there could&apos;ve been about 50-75 people down there.

<p>I went into the main door into a hallway brimming with coats (and what seemed to be a coat check on the first floor). Out of a side door peeked a worker with a gasmask and apron on and I could see a bowl of flour. I had to go up a set of stairs that took you to a small landing with a sink and rooms on either side. To the right was the ordering station, I think. I have no idea how it worked because I was told that everything was ordered in advance, but there was a lot of money exchanging and small note cards being swapped.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>Yearsley eventually made it out of Kehilath Yakov with &quot;scrap&quot; matzah that, according to the baker, hadn&apos;t been &quot;checked for quality.&quot; The matzah is thinner, dryer and much more &quot;well done&quot; than the store-bought Manischewitz. It&apos;s also larger and circular, as opposed to the machine-made matzah. Meanwhile, Yearsley couldn&apos;t even get inside Satmar Shmura Hand-Matzoh because they were only accepting pre-orders.</p>

<p>Rounding out our sadly pathetic attempt at a matzah taste test is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509230005/http://gothamist.com/2012/08/15/heres_sugar_and_plumm_a_new_place_t.php#photo-1">Sugar and Plumm&apos;s</a> Matzoh Buttercrunch, which tops the crisp bread with butter, light brown sugar, dark chocolate and salt. It goes without saying that this decadent dessert disappeared from our <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509230005/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/26/is_your_office_filled_with_unhealth.php">Silver Table of Sin</a> more quickly than its traditional counterpart. </p>

<p>While you probably won&apos;t be able to snag any matzah from Satmar Shmura Hand-Matzoh Bakery or Kehilath Yakov today, you can pick up a bag of Sugar and Plumm&apos;s creation for $5.50 a bag; quite a steal <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509230005/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/21/will_this_1000_easter_egg_finally_g_2.php">considering their Easter options</a>.</p>
