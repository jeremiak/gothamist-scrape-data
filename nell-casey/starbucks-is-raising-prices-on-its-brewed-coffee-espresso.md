<p>A pit stop at everyone&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021133739/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/16/toilet_tragedy_starbucks_has_begun.php">last resort restroom</a> will be a bit more costly with a new increase on certain coffee products at Starbucks. The chain has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021133739/http://www.wsj.com/articles/starbucks-raises-prices-on-some-drinks-1468321651">announced a price hike</a> on brewed coffee, espresso beverages and tea lattes at company-owned stores across the USA. Nobody panic: the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021133739/http://gothamist.com/2015/03/31/starbucks_kale_smoothies_lol.php">kale smoothies</a> are safe.</p>

<p>Customers will notice an increase of 10 to 20 cents on some brewed coffee sizes and an additional 10 to 30 cents on espresso and tea latte drinks. Exact numbers will vary by market, but the company says on average, customers will pay an additional 1% per transaction. </p>

<p>But before anyone gets their frappuccinos in a bunch, it&apos;s worth noting that the chain <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021133739/http://www.eater.com/2016/7/11/12148836/starbucks-pay-raise-worker-benefits-howard-schultz">recently raised wages</a> for thousands of employees at their company-owned stores. There&apos;s been no <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021133739/http://bigstory.ap.org/116087a9d09d4848a4e3a4712ae09851">official comment</a> from Starbucks as to whether the wage increase is directly responsible for the price increase, but the timing is interesting.
