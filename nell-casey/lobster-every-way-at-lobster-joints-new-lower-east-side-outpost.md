</div></div>					<p>Hungover Manhattanites craving a Lobster Claw Bloody Mary but vexed by the prospect of finding their way to &quot;not-off-the-L-train&quot; Greenpoint are in luck now that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150220025505/http://lobsterjoint.com/">Lobster Joint</a> has opened a Lower East Side outpost. The restaurant opened mid-December between Ludlow and Orchard, the same block occupied by stalwart meat slinger Katz&apos;s Deli. We&apos;ve been fans of the Joint&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150220025505/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/30/a_food_drink_tour_of_greenpoint.php#photo-20">original Brooklyn spot</a> since it opened almost two years ago, appreciating its fresh seafood, efficient order-at-the-counter system, and rocking happy hours on the weekdays. We&apos;re also obsessed with those aforementioned Bloody Marys, which are served with a gigantic hunk of lobster meat during weekend brunch service.</p>

<p>The new location offers the same menu of fresh seafood dishes that includes everything from classic raw bar selections of oysters and clams to fried clam strips and crab cake sandwiches. But really you&apos;re here for the lobster, which you can find   tossed in mayo or butter and tucked into griddled rolls ($17); steamed in the shell and served with potatoes and corn ($34); or mixed into heartier dishes like a Lobster Mac&apos;n&apos;Cheese ($17) and Lobster Shepherd&apos;s Pie ($21). Crustacean-phobes can opt for an equally delicious burger ($12) or a succulent roasted half chicken $14) plus other comforting, seafood-centric options. Besides Bloody Mary&apos;s, a nice selection of cocktails, wine and beer ($6-$9) can be procured plus oyster shooters for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150220025505/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/18/how_to_become_an_oyster_snob_withou.php">daring bivalve aficionados</a>.</p>

<p>Inside the decor rivals any roadside lobster shanty, albeit with more refined touches like a large skylight and a small but comfortable bar. The cozy space is clean and unpretentious with a dining area populated by large communal tables and a few two-seat high tops. Unlike the Brooklyn location there is no outdoor option, but Lobster Joint can pack up a righteous picnic&#x2014;including lobster or crab, rolls, homemade chips, coleslaw and pickles&#x2014;to enjoy in nearby Tompkins Square Park.</p>
