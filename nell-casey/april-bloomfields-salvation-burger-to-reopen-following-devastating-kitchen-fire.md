<p>Just a few months after opening in February, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108030410/http://www.salvationburger.com/">Salvation Burger</a>&#x2014;chef April Bloomfield&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108030410/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/10/salvation_burger_april_bloomfield.php">ode to the patty</a>&#x2014;was forced to shutter following a fire that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108030410/http://www.grubstreet.com/2016/05/salvation-burger-kitchen-fire-temporarily-closing.html">&quot;severely damaged&quot;</a> the restaurant&apos;s kitchen in May. At the time, reps for the restaurant said Salvation Burger would &quot;remain closed for the next few weeks to undergo repairs&quot; and the griddles would be reactivated. Those repairs took much longer than expected, however, and the restaurant still has not reopened.</p>

<p>There&apos;s cause for hope among Midtown burger enthusiasts, though, as a sign has materialized in the paper-covered windows that the restaurant will be &quot;back Oct 2016.&quot; The restaurant&apos;s publicity team tells Gothamist that they &quot;know the opening will be in October but we don&apos;t have a date just yet.&quot; The restaurant&apos;s Twitter also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108030410/https://twitter.com/salvationburger/status/775381173988098048">confirms the news</a>.</p>

<p>Before it temporarily shuttered, the eatery&#x2014;which is located inside Pod 51 Hotel on East 51st&#x2014;offered <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108030410/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/10/salvation_burger_april_bloomfield.php">fancy beef burgers</a> at $17 and $25 a pop, plus homemade pies. Presumably, they&apos;ll be doing the same once they reopen. In the restaurant&apos;s absence, a Bareburger outpost opened about a block away.</p>

<p>Bloomfield&#x2014;who runs popular gastropub Spotted Pig, in addition to a collection of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108030410/http://gothamist.com/tags/aprilbloomfield">other NYC eateries</a> with business partner Ken Friedman&#x2014;has kept busy in Salvation Burger&apos;s downtime prepping for her new UWS eatery White Gold. The new restaurant, which should open later in October, will have a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108030410/http://www.grubstreet.com/2016/08/april-bloomfield-really-goes-whole-hog-at-white-gold.html">whole animal butchery component</a> and a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108030410/http://www.grubstreet.com/2016/08/april-bloomfield-chopped-cheese-sandwich-white-gold.html">&quot;gourmet chopped cheese sandwich,&quot;</a> which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108030410/http://firstwefeast.com/features/2016/08/chopped-cheese-white-gold">ruffled a few feathers</a> in Harlem.</p>
