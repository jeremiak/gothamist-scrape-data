title: 16 Cheerful Spring Cocktails & Where To Drink Them
---

	
										<p><em>We thought it might never happen, but relative sunlight has returned to bestow upon our Vitamin D-starved flesh the glory of its rays. With it, the flavors of spring have begun to creep onto cocktail menus, taking advantage of seasonal produce or enlivening our livers with copious quantities of tequila (and gin). Our preferred warm weather cocktail is a foam cup of Bud Light in McCarren Park, but for the more refined palate, here are some places to enjoy the bounty of this new season.</em></p>

<p>Williamsburg <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801202241/http://gothamist.com/2015/06/12/williamsburg_gets_a_fern_bar_oleand.php">hotel restaurant</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801202241/http://www.oleandersnyc.com/#/">Oleanders at the </a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801202241/http://www.mccarrenhotel.com/">McCarren Hotel and Pool</a> isn&apos;t afraid to embrace the neighborhood&apos;s intractable stereotypes on its cocktail menu, recently introducing a <strong>Hipster Reviver</strong> ($14), their version of a Corpse Reviver 2. Local Dorothy Parker Gin mixes with Cocchi Americano, Cointreau and lemon juice, then gets finished off with a spritz of St. George Absinthe. If the Green Fairy isn&apos;t for you, opt for the <strong>Into The Pines</strong> ($14), with Martin Miller&apos;s Gin, Linie Aquavit, Zirbenz Pine Liqueur, lime juice and cane sugar. <em>160 North 12th Street, Williamsburg, (718) 218-7500</em></p>

<p>In another section of the neighborhood, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801202241/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/29/belle_shoals_williamsburg.php#photo-1">newly-minted Southern cocktail bar</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801202241/http://ingoodcompanyhg.com/belle-shoals/">Belle Shoals</a> kickstarts their cocktail menu with something called the <strong>Devil&apos;s Music</strong> ($13), which sounds rowdy but also includes kale as an ingredient (OG Williamsburg will never die). To the vegetation, Ilegal Mezcal and Roca Patron Tequila&#x2014;made by crushing agave between two volcanic stones&#x2014;both the devil&apos;s playthings, plus some hellfire from Ancho Reyes Chile Liqueur and a squirt of lime juice. If that doesn&apos;t make you wanna dance, consider their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801202241/https://www.instagram.com/p/BCRYddUkoIX/?taken-by=nellcasey">shot gun shell shooters</a>. <em>10 Hope Street, Williamsburg, (718) 218-6027</em> </p>

<p>Tequila and something spicy are a common spring cocktail trend and Flatiron&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801202241/http://juelanclub.com/">Jue Lan Club</a> embraces it with gusto. Their<strong> Madame Adventurist</strong> ($14) employs two heat elements (Ancho Reyes and Szechuan Chili) with one flora (hibiscus) and one sweet (agave) component. The cocktail is tied together with Herradura Tequila and served on the rocks. <em>49 West 20th Street, Flatiron, (646) 524-7409</em></p>

<p>The <strong>San Juan Bautista</strong> ($19) at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801202241/http://www.salinasnyc.com/">Salinas</a> in Chelsea hits many of the major flavor elements, including spicy-sweet (wasabi-agave), savory (cucumber juice), tart (grapefruit juice) and sour (rice vinegar). The inspiration for this Alacran Blanco Tequila-based cocktail, if you&apos;re curious, is the cucumber sushi roll, hence the ginger salt and lime juice rim. If that&apos;s too adventurous, explore the restaurant&apos;s Spanish origins with the <strong>Primavera de Nueva York</strong> ($18), made with Do Ferreiro Orujo de Galicia brandy, Atxa Vino Vermouth Blanco, Orchard Apricot Liqueur, Luxardo and Bar Keep Saffron Bitters. <em>136 9th Avenue, Chelsea, (212) 776-1990</em></p>

<p><strong>The Tall and Handsome</strong> ($15) at <a href="americanwhiskeynyc.com">American Whiskey</a> is a portent of summer, when frozen rum drinks flow from churning dispensers and we&apos;re all a little more carefree (and intoxicated). In advance of that wonderful season, try this crushed ice beauty swizzle cocktail with Plantation pineapple rum, lime, cinnamon syrup and two types of bitters for balance and color. Our friend absinthe makes another appearance here as a rinse for the finished product. <em>247 West 30th Street, Midtown West, (212) 967-1070</em></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801202241/http://www.fungtu.com/">Fung Tu</a> on the LES is also dreaming of balmy summer days with the <strong>High 5</strong> ($13), a Chinese-inspired daiquiri-style drink by Phillip Szabados and Justin Hampton. Five spice-infused Jamaican rum gets further spiced with warming ginger and a star anise garnish, plus some fresh lime juice for added zip. Sweet drink avoiders should try the <strong>Baijiu Bijou #2</strong> ($13) using China&apos;s often intense baijiu spirit as a base. Add to that Yellow Chartreuse, Bonal Gentiane Quina and citrus bitters to complete the journey. <em>22 Orchard Street, LES, 212-219-8785</em></p>

<p>The cocktail trend has been flourishing on the Upper East Side, thanks in no small part to <a href="thegilroynyc.com">The Gilroy</a>, which has been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801202241/http://gothamist.com/2014/04/01/the_gilroy.php#photo-1">shaking things up</a> since 2014. Their negroni program is in full effect this spring, with a <strong>White Negroni</strong> ($14) added to the list that uses White Pike Whisky, Suze, and Lillet Blanc. And ahoy &apos;90s kids: their <strong>Cheer Up, Daria</strong> ($14) drink has been boozified with Spring44 vodka in addition to the ginger, lime, pineapple juice and the house made spiced demerara. <em>1561 2nd Avenue, UES, (212) 734-8800</em></p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="032315vandal.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801202241im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_nellcasey/032315vandal.jpeg" width="640" height="427"> <br> <i> (courtesy VANDAL)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>Don&apos;t get the wrong idea after several cocktails and start tagging the walls at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801202241/http://www.vandalnewyork.com/">VANDAL</a>, chef Chris Santos/TAO Group&apos;s Bowery clubstaurant. But do imbibe their new <strong>Sergeant Bell Pepper</strong> ($16) offering that uses bell pepper juice with firebird chili as its base along with The Botanist Gin, lemon, black pepper tincture and simple syrup. The savory-esque cocktail also gets finished with a few drops of spicy Thai Chili oil for heat and lusciousness. <em>199 Bowery, LES, (212) 400-0199</em></p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="32316oiji.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801202241im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_nellcasey/32316oiji.jpeg" width="640" height="419"> <br> <i> (Brendan Burke)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>Though it&apos;s known as a tequila bar, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801202241/http://anejotribeca.com/">A&#xF1;jeo</a> in Tribeca is experimenting with a different T this season: tea. The <strong>Tea Thyme</strong> ($14), as the name implies, includes both matcha tea and a thyme syrup, together creating a jewel-toned drink that&apos;ll give you a boost of energy from the tea&apos;s caffeine to boot. Bulldog Gin serves as the boozy base and lime juice and club soda are added for brightness and a fizz. <em>301 Church Street, Tribeca, (212) 920-6270</em></p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="32316LIBar.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801202241im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_nellcasey/32316LIBar.jpeg" width="640" height="428"> <br> <i> (Long Island Bar)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>Sandeman Porto Founders Reserve wasn&apos;t something we were familiar with but the port wine is popping up on several spring cocktail menus, including Cobble Hill&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801202241/http://thelongislandbar.com/">The Long Island Bar</a>. There, Timothy Miner&apos;s using the port as a foil to gin for <strong>The Siege of Lisbon</strong> ($12), shaking them with lemon juice, simple syrup and bitters until frothy. It&apos;s not on the menu, but ask the mixologists at Mace to make you a <strong>Sandeman Sour</strong> ($13) and you&apos;ll get another interpretation that includes aquavit and Fernet. <em>110 Atlantic Avenue, Cobble Hill, (718) 625-8908 // 649 East 9th Street, East Village, (212) 673-1190</em></p>

<p>It&apos;s actually inspired by Walt Whitman but something about the <strong>Leaves of Grass</strong> also smacks of another springtime favorite: freshly cut grass. Either way, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801202241/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/01/2016_michelin_winners.php">Michelin-starred</a> Clinton Hill restaurant <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801202241/http://www.thefinchnyc.com/">The Finch</a> is giving us some green to add to Bison Grass vodka, including Pear Williams eau de vie, lime and chamomile; sounds relaxing. On top, a floater of Basque cider for bubbles and a garnish of fresh rosemary, adding to the earthy qualities. <em>212 Greene Avenue, Clinton Hill, (718) 218-4444</em></p>
