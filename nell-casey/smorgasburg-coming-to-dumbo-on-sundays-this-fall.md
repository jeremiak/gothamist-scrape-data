<p>More good food news for Dumbo with the announcement that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510000224/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/03/smorgasburg_returns_saturday_booze.php">Smorgasburg</a>&#x2014;the popular Williamsburg food outpost of the Brooklyn Flea&#x2014;will be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510000224/http://www.brooklynflea.com/2012/08/29/smorgasburg-sundays/">moving to the neighborhood!</a> Starting September 9th and continuing through November 18th, vendors and grocers will be set up in the historic Tobacco Warehouse in Brooklyn Bridge Park each Sunday from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Expect to see many of the same vendors as the Billyburg version and the crew is also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510000224/http://www.brooklynflea.com/smorgasburg/?page_id=14">actively seeking new vendors</a>. The only disappointment: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510000224/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/20/booze_smorgasburg_opens_smorgasbar.php">no beer</a>. But considering what this new food opportunity means for local residents, we don&apos;t anticipate too many complaints. </p>

<p>If you&apos;ll recall, the Flea spent the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510000224/http://gothamist.com/2009/04/28/brooklyn_flea_to_brooklyn_bridge_pa.php">summer of 2009 in in the neighborhood</a>, so this feels natural to Flea co-founder Jonathan Butler. &quot;We&apos;re really psyched to be working with Brooklyn Bridge Park again,&quot; Butler tells us.&#xA0;&quot;This is really something of a homecoming for us.&quot;</p>
