<p>When Troy Neal and Leslie Polizzotto first opened <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170314101735/http://www.thedoughnutproject.com/">Doughnut Project</a> in October, they were already experimenting with beets, olive oil and black pepper as fried dough companions, with even more savory options on their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170314101735/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/27/doughnut_project_west_village.php#photo-1">unique DIY doughnut program</a>. With their latest creation, however, the duo seem intent on riling up purists with an Everything Doughnut offering that&apos;s a <em>shots fired</em> towards one of the NYC&apos;s most beloved foodstuffs. See you all in the comments!</p>

<p>&quot;People are already arguing about it, which I think is wonderful,&quot; Neal told us this afternoon. &quot;I knew we kind of hit a chord a little bit because not everybody&apos;s on board, or they&apos;re a little skeptical about what it&apos;s going to be like.&quot; It&apos;s a simple hybrid on the surface: regular yeast doughnuts get a lacquer of sweet cream cheese glaze, the glue that&apos;ll hold on a scattering of oven-roasted black sesame seeds, garlic, poppy seeds, pepitas and sea salt. &quot;Our idea is to straddle that fence between the salty and the sweet and this was one that definitely does that.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;The Everything Doughnut is the one in the box for someone who doesn&apos;t like a sweet doughnut,&quot; Polizzotto mused. &quot;If you bring a box of doughnuts to work there&apos;s always someone who isn&apos;t going to eat a sweet doughnut but this may fill that niche.&quot; </p>

<p>Neal says this isn&apos;t the furthest they&apos;ll travel down the savory road in the future, teasing some big plans for more doughnut innovation coming out this spring. In the pipeline for the near future is a Grapefruit-Rosemary Doughnut, to which Neal will be adding serrano peppers and honey before rolling out soon. &quot;The Everything Doughnut kind of overshadowed it a little bit,&quot; he laughed. &quot;Now I might tweak it a little bit more.&quot;</p>
