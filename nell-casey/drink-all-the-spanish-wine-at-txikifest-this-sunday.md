<p>Sample and sip the flavors of Spain&apos;s Basque region at the third annual <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130729111305/http://www.txikifest.com/txakoli/">Txikifest</a>, an outdoor festival celebrating Spain&apos;s Txakoli wine. For the uninitiated, Txakoli&#x2014;pronounced cha-co-li&#x2014;are predominantly white wines made from hondarrabi zuri grapes, a variety common to the Basque Country. The resulting wines are fresh, acidic and low in alcohol, ideal for a long day of al fresco imbibing. Serious Eats has a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130729111305/http://drinks.seriouseats.com/2013/01/where-txakoli-is-made-spain-basque-country-vineyards-wine.html">helpful primer</a> that explains the wine&apos;s flavor profiles and breaks down the different Txakoli-producing regions. </p>
