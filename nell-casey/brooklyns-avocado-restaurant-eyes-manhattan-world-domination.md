<p>Apparently it only takes about two months to go from opening a niche restaurant that&apos;s an instant viral hit to planning an expansion into a fast-casual chain. Avocaderia, the &quot;world&apos;s first&quot; avocado bar, only opened <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170618202420/http://gothamist.com/2017/04/03/avocaderia_avocado_restaurant_brook.php">back in April</a>, but ownership already has plans to open another location in Manhattan, with an eye towards turning the avocado-only concept into a replicable one with more than just two locations.</p>

<p>Founder Francesco Brachetti <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170618202420/https://www.qsrmagazine.com/exclusives/avocado-based-restaurant-ready-more">spoke with QSR Magazine</a>&#x2014;an industry publication for restaurants&#x2014;about their quick success and how it&apos;s motivating him and his business partners to scout out locations outside of their initial Industry City home. </p>

<blockquote>&#x201C;If you can prove your concept here, you can do it anywhere,&#x201D; he says, acknowledging that he hopes Avocaderia&#x2019;s first location, which he believes is the world&#x2019;s first avocado-only caf&#xE9;, will be the incubator for a fast-casual chain.</blockquote>

<p>There&apos;s precedent for his confidence: the restaurant opened with just two employees and has now expanded to a dozen to staff the small cafe, which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170618202420/http://gothamist.com/2017/05/12/avocaderia_industry_city.php#photo-1">blows through 650 pounds of avocados</a> per week. &quot;It ran out of avocados on the first day. On Memorial Day weekend, 1,000 hungry customers swarmed the restaurant,&quot; QSR reports. &quot;A video went viral and increased business by 80 percent.&quot;</p>
