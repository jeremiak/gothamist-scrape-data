<p>Pitmaster Josh Bowen, who runs the acclaimed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021114240/http://www.johnbrownseriousbbq.com/">John Brown Smokehouse</a> in Long Island City, is doubling down on his Queens &apos;cue operations by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021114240/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/05/the_best_bbq_spots_in_new_york_city.php">resurrecting his former pop-up</a> Alchemy, Texas in a new space in Astoria. Bowen <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021114240/http://ny.eater.com/2016/6/7/11878244/mothership-meat-company">tells Eater</a> he&apos;ll debut Mothership Meat Company later this year serving Texas-style barbecue, not the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021114240/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/27/regional_bbq_styles_in_nyc.php#photo-1">Kansas City stuff</a> he&apos;s doing in LIC. Bowen tells us he&apos;s awaiting DOB approval to announce a specific location, but that it&apos;ll be somewhere in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021114240/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Island_City#Dutch_Kills">Dutch Kills section</a>.</p>

<p>Texan purists may want to stop reading here, as Bowen&apos;s planning to spice up his brisket and other meats with spice blends like garam masala and cooking fats like ghee, or clarified butter. &quot;I&apos;m not going to fusion it up or anything,&quot; Bowen promised Eater. &quot;Spices are spices, however they taste. It will be salt and pepper with a little bit of extra love.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I was born and bred in KC, lived in Austin, and then worked at Hill Country,&quot; Bowen <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021114240/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/27/regional_bbq_styles_in_nyc.php#photo-1">told us earlier this year</a>, so his Texan pedigree will be put to good use here. Also on tap: lots of beer&#x2014;John Brown Smokehouse has a rad craft list&#x2014;and a large outdoor patio, so it&apos;ll have a bit of the backyard feeling like the pop-up did back in Jackson Heights. </p>
