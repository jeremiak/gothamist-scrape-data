title: Meet The Greens: 5 Leafy Veggies That Aren't Kale
---

	
										<p><em>Delicious though it may be, the hipster lettuce known as kale has officially <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422204944/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/27/super_bowl_1.php">jumped the shark</a>. Now that we can be officially <em>over</em> kale, it&apos;s time to find the next great leafy green that will take the city by storm. Below, five contenders for the title of Top Tomato, so to speak, plus a few serving suggestions if you&apos;re feeling adventurous.</em></p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="021714chard.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422204944im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_nellcasey/021714chard.jpg" width="640" height="427"> <br> <i> <span class="photo_caption">Chard (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422204944/http://www.shutterstock.com/gallery-69467p1.html">Andi Berger</a>/<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422204944/http://www.shutterstock.com/index-in.mhtml">Shutterstock</a>)</span></i></div> <p></p>

<p><strong>Chard</strong>: Think of this leaf as kale&apos;s more badass cousin, packing a bigger nutritional punch and even more flavor&#x2014;and will you look at those colors! Cultivated from beets to grow large, deep green leaves, chard has a similarly bitter flavor that&apos;s mellowed by cooking, though it retains some of that bite, especially in the stems. As you can see from the above photo, stems come in a variety of colors, from a stark white to a gorgeous ruby red. Young leaves can be sprinkled raw into salads while older leaves stand up well to cooking. </p>

<p>Look for chard at the farmer&apos;s markets starting in the spring, with a season that often lasts into late summer. This vitamin-packed veggie tastes great simply sauteed in olive oil and garlic or try this <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422204944/http://voraciousvegan.blogspot.com/2012/08/roasted-rainbow-chard.html">Voracious Vegan recipe</a> for Roasted Rainbow Chard with feta.</p>

<p><strong>Mustard Greens</strong>: Don&apos;t let the name turn you off, horseradish-phobes; these greens won&apos;t cause that wasabi-liked nose sting&#x2014;unless you&apos;re cooking them with wasabi, of course. This hearty veggie has similarities to collard greens, that delicious southern staple, but with a little more of a peppery bite. Because of their thickeness, they can stand up well to more aggressive cooking methods like braising. If you&apos;re feeling chilly, this Spicy Pork and Mustard Green Soup from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422204944/http://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/spicy-pork-and-mustard-green-soup">Bon Appetit</a> should do the trick. </p>

<p><strong>Bok Choy</strong>: Sometimes called Chinese cabbage, bok choy packs a super juicy punch with its thick white stems and sweet, dark green leaves. You&apos;ll often see it on Chinese restaurant menus, simply steamed and served with pork buns or sometimes sauteed in a flavorful sauce. Be on the lookout for the smaller plants, often referred to as Baby Bok Choy: they&apos;re more tender and sweet and cook faster than the larger varieties. They add a great crunch to any dish, like these Spicy Ginger Pork Noodles from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422204944/http://www.nytimes.com/recipes/1016023/spicy-ginger-pork-noodles-with-bok-choy.html">the <em>Times</em></a> or Braised with Garlic, Ginger and Soy like this recipe from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422204944/http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2012/08/braised-baby-bok-choy-garlic-ginger-soy-recipe.html">Serious Eats</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Radicchio</strong>: While not a leafy &quot;green,&quot; this pleasantly bitter and crunchy vegetable is used often in Italian cooking to add a peppery bite to a dish or as a substitute for salad. A member of the chicory family, this beautiful vegetable is characterized by its deep reddish purple hue and bright white veins; it&apos;s also very hearty and can stand up to high heat cooking. A simple preparation calls for grilling and dressing a la salad or try this hearty Ricotta-and-Fontina-Stuffed Shells with Fennel and Radicchio dish courtesy of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422204944/http://www.foodandwine.com/recipes/ricotta-and-fontina-stuffed-shells-with-fennel-and-radicchio">Food &amp; Wine</a>.</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="021714spinach.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422204944im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_nellcasey/021714spinach.jpg" width="640" height="481"> <br> <i> <span class="photo_caption">(<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422204944/http://www.shutterstock.com/gallery-999701p1.html">Hong Vo</a>/<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422204944/http://www.shutterstock.com/index-in.mhtml">Shutterstock</a>)</span></i></div> <p></p>

<p><strong>Spinach</strong>: Have we forgotten about humble spinach with all of this kale distraction? I hope not, because for my money there is no more versatile, delicious, easy-to-eat leafy green known to man. Just let this serve as a reminder that the sweet, super tender, delicious green shouldn&apos;t be overlooked just because other greens went and got themselves some trendy PR; spinach&apos;s spokesman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422204944/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popeye">speaks for himself</a>.</p>

<p>Spinach of the &quot;baby&quot; variety can be eaten raw in place of lettuce or gently sauteed in oil, garlic and red pepper flakes for a quick side. Throw it raw into your chicken soup or ramen or any other brothy character or go steakhouse-style with decadent Creamed Spinach like this recipe found on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422204944/http://smittenkitchen.com/blog/2009/11/creamed-spinach/">Smitten Kitchen</a>; hey, just because we&apos;re eating veggies doesn&apos;t mean we have to be healthy. </p>
