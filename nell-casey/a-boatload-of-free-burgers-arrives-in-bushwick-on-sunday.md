<p>If spending less money in 2017 was one of your New Year&apos;s resolutions (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170316052640/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/22/whoa_if_true.php">lol</a>), this is a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170316052640/http://gothamist.com/2017/03/13/weekly_food_roundup_6.php">good week</a> to revisit your promises. On Sunday, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170316052640/https://www.duncansburgers.com/">Duncan&apos;s Burgers</a> takes up permanent residence inside <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170316052640/https://www.facebook.com/dromedarybar/">Dromedary Bar</a>, Bushwick&apos;s primary source for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170316052640/http://gothamist.com/2016/05/03/dromedary_tiki_bar_bushwick.php#photo-1">marlin&apos;s head cocktails</a>, and there will be a burger boatload&apos;s worth of free food to celebrate.</p>

<p>Beginning at 1 p.m. until the locusts have decimated the supply, they&apos;ll be giving away their dry aged beef burgers for free. They&apos;re only $3.49 for three ounces on the regs, so not a <em>huge</em> dining deal, but that leaves more wallet room for tikki drinks or maybe a side of fries. They&apos;ve also got veggie burgers and vegetarian/vegan chicken tenders, but those are gonna cost you.</p>

<p>After Sunday, the burger spot will be participating in daily happy hour specials, including a burger, fries and beer for $7 and a deluxe burger, fries, shot and beer for $12, plus other weekly specials like wing nights and &quot;Midwestern&quot; taco Tuesdays. </p>

<p><em>Dromedary Bar/Duncan&apos;s Burgers is located at 266 Irving Avenue in Bushwick; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170316052640/https://www.duncansburgers.com/">Duncan&apos;s Burgers</a></em></p>
