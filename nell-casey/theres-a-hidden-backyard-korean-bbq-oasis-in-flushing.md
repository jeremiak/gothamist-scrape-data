<p>The backyard barbecue is a summertime tradition, one being played out with pork kalbi and ssam instead of burgers and dogs at Flushing&apos;s Majang Dong. If you can&apos;t read Korean, the nondescript storefront bears only the word &quot;BBQ&quot; to offer a clue about what&apos;s inside. To say nothing of the restaurant&apos;s large backyard space, where they&apos;re grilling up meats and seafood over hot charcoal. Luckily, Joe DiStefano visited the &quot;Korean BBQ speakeasy,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170105101351/http://chopsticksandmarrow.com/2016/05/behold-majang-dong-flushings-secret-korean-bbq-garden/">chronicling his meal</a> on his blog <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170105101351/http://chopsticksandmarrow.com/">Chopsticks + Marrow</a>. </p>

<p>Enter the family-run restaurant and indicate you&apos;re interested in BBQ and someone will take you out back where the real action takes place. The year-round outdoor space&#x2014;which is tented and heated in the winter&#x2014;isn&apos;t like many of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170105101351/http://gothamist.com/2016/05/12/the_best_bar_backyards_in_nyc.php">sleek offerings</a> elsewhere in the city. Plastic pink chairs are clustered around tables with inlaid grills for cooking, while alcohol advertisements emblazoned with attractive women adorn the walls of the covered section. </p>

<p>At the &quot;Korean BBQ wonderland,&quot; DiStefano recommends that pork kalbi and pork belly, but says a must-have are the pork intestines. &quot;With a crunchy exterior and chewy interior, the fatty rings eat like an offal lover&#x2019;s version of pork cracklins,&quot; he writes of Chef-Owner Yu&apos;s dish. The dak ddong jjip, spicy fried chicken gizzards, are another favorite <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170105101351/http://www.timeout.com/newyork/restaurants/majang-dong">according to Time Out New York</a>, along with jang uh gui, grilled eel.</p>
