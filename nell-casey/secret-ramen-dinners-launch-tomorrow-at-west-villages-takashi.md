<p>Purveyors of all things cow offal, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504174019/http://takashinyc.com/">Takashi</a> has developed a cult following at their West Village restaurant for diners who like their meat a little less mainstream. Now they&apos;re taking their menu off the grill and into the stock pot with a new series of &quot;secret&quot; Friday night ramen dinners, starting tomorrow.</p>

<p>The restaurant <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504174019/https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151760799451671&amp;set=a.423607551670.204401.375774091670&amp;type=1&amp;theater">announced the special on Facebook</a> Christmas Eve, revealing they&apos;ll be offering a cow-focused ramen (natch) with &quot;custom-made noodles...in a rich beef broth with delicious braised beef-belly and poached egg.&quot; The giant bowl of soupy goodness can be yours for $16 if you manage to be one of 30 folks who get their reservations in first. </p>

<p>They&apos;ll be doing two seatings at 11:30 p.m. and 12:30 a.m.; reservations can be made by emailing ramen@takashinyc.com. If you don&apos;t get in this week, stay tuned to their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504174019/https://www.facebook.com/takashinyc">Facebook page</a> for the next iteration.  </p>
