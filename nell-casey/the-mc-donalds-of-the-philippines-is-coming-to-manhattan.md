<p>When fast food chain <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108023707/http://www.jollibee.com.ph/">Jollibee</a> opened its first East Coast location in Queens in 2009, lines quickly formed out the door and essentially <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108023707/http://gothamist.com/2009/02/17/jollibee_filipino_fast_food_comes_t.php">wrapped around Woodside</a>. Will the same be true when the Filipino chain opens near the Port Authority this fall? People do <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108023707/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/03/the_chick-fil-a_first_100_sleep_ove.php">go to great lengths</a> for fried chicken.</p>

<p>The chain&#x2014;which operates hundreds of outposts across Asia and the West Coast, giving it the distinction as the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108023707/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/11/dining/reviews/11brief-002.html?_r=0">&quot;McDonald&apos;s of the Philippines&quot;</a>&#x2014;will open its second NYC location at 609 Eighth Avenue, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108023707/https://commercialobserver.com/2016/06/the-mcdonalds-of-the-philippines-opening-first-manhattan-outpost/">reports Commercial Observer</a>. The restaurant serves a mashup of burgers, pasta and Filipino dishes but their big draw is their fried chicken, known as Chickenjoy. They&apos;ve also got a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108023707/http://gothamist.com/2009/06/03/jollibee_olive_branch_bearer_adds_b.php">coveted breakfast menu</a> of fried eggs served with garlic rice and meats like corned beef, beef tapa and hot dogs. </p>

<p>Once open, it&apos;ll join the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108023707/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/29/arbys_invades_manhattan.php">newish Arby&apos;s</a> on the commercial stretch with its &quot;tremendous pedestrian count,&quot; as noted by the chain&apos;s new landlord. My enochlophobia&apos;s acting up.</p>
