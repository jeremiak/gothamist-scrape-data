<p>Regardless of its <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170616025209/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/overrated-new-york-article-1.2630560">standing</a> with steak cognoscenti in the city, there&apos;s no denying Peter Luger is an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170616025209/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/03/the_8_best_classic_restaurants_in_n.php">institution</a>, in name and reputation. Which is probably why ownership of the Brooklyn legend is pretty pissed off that a Pennsylvania restaurant looks to be co-opting the Luger brand to lure in customers. </p>

<p>A restaurant called Carl von Luger Steak and Seafood in Scranton, Pennsylvania is being <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170616025209/https://www.pacermonitor.com/public/case/21469199/Peter_Luger,_Inc_v_Carl_Von_Luger,_LLC_et_al#">sued</a> by Peter Luger, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170616025209/http://www.reuters.com/article/us-peterluger-lawsuit-idUSKCN18F1RL">reports Reuters</a>, for trademark infringement in employing the Luger name to run a similar business. Brooklyn Luger has accused PA Luger of enacting a &quot;deliberate campaign to confuse consumers.&quot;</p>

<p>There is a connection, however. PA Luger owner Robert Dickert worked at a Long Island offshoot of Peter Luger and also claims that &quot;Carl&quot; Luger was Peter Luger&apos;s nephew. But the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170616025209/http://carlvonluger.com/about/">Carl von Luger Steakhouse website</a> also misleadingly touts a &quot;since 1887&quot; family tradition&#x2014;Peter Luger <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170616025209/https://peterluger.com/our-story/">opened in Williamsburg </a>in 1887 as &quot;Carl Luger&apos;s Caf&#xE9;, Billiards and Bowling Alley&quot;&#x2014;even though the Pennsylvania restaurant has only been open since 2011. </p>

<p>&#x201C;To put it simply, Carl von Luger is acting as an imposter for the Peter Luger steakhouses and is ripping off its intellectual property and reputation. Robert Dickert created a fictitious name and is exaggerating his ties to Peter Luger in a deliberate effort to create a false association between Carl von Luger steakhouses and the famous Peter Luger steakhouses,&#x201D; said Michael S. Elkin of Winston &amp; Strawn, which is representing Peter Luger, Inc. &#x201C;This is an egregious example of the misappropriation of the Peter Luger name and reputation and we intend to defend our claim vigorously.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Dickert has plans to open a second Carl von Luger Steak and Seafood in North Palm Beach, Florida, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170616025209/http://www.mypalmbeachpost.com/business/just-steak-house-with-fabled-history-coming-north-palm-beach/CpoFMYYHnkZcYukF9DdK5M/">local press</a> has dubbed the forthcoming restaurant as &quot;an offshoot of Peter Luger of NY.&quot; </p>

<p>As a result of the local press coverage, &quot;Peter Luger said it has been fielding inquiries since the article&apos;s publication about whether it was expanding into Florida, where many customers have primary residences.&quot; </p>
