<p>Yesterday the city approved a hefty government subsidy plan for the controversial Bronx move by grocery delivery company FreshDirect. The city Industrial Development Agency voted to give <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130823013406/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20130724/port-morris/city-approves-87-million-subsidies-for-hotly-debated-freshdirect-plan">$87 million in subsidies for the move</a>, which would relocate the company&apos;s headquarters from Long Island City to a waterfront property in the Port Morris section of the Bronx. The government subsidies could reach as high as $128 million with tax breaks, grants and loans if the state jumps on board as well. </p>

<p>In order to get these sweet government handouts, the company promised that 1/3 of their proposed 1,000 new employees would come from the Bronx and also agreed to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130823013406/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/18/fresh_direct_fine_well_deliver_to_t.php">begin delivery in the borough</a> and accept food stamps. But <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130823013406/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/13/fresh_directs_sweet_govt_subsidies.php">critics argue</a> this isn&apos;t enough, citing added truck pollution to a borough <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130823013406/http://www.thebronxjournal.com/the-bronx-in-search-of-a-breath-of-fresh-air/">already thick with air pollution</a>, restricted waterfront access for locals and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130823013406/http://gothamist.com/2012/11/14/city_council_members_billionaires_r.php">impact on local businesses</a>. Comptroller and mayoral hopeful John Liu was the only person to vote &quot;no&quot; to the subsidy, which he derided for being &quot;a wasteful way to do business that picks taxpayers&apos; pockets in order to reward fat cats.&quot; </p>

<p>Despite the opposition and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130823013406/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/03/judge_dismisses_lawsuit_trying_to_s.php">attempted lawsuits</a>, plans are basically full steam ahead for the Harlem River Yard conversion. Bronx Borough President Ruben Diaz Jr. was pleased with the outcome of the vote, citing &quot;continued expansion of positive economic development in the Bronx&quot; as a reason to welcome the move. The plan now moves to the mayor&apos;s office so hizzoner can give his stamp of approval, or nail in the coffin, depending on your opinion. </p>
