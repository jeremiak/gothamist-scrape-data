<p>On Sunday night, Upper West Side institution Big Nick&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130918041421/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/28/farewell_big_nicks_uws_pizza_joint.php">flipped its last burger</a>, ending a 50-plus year tenure serving a dedicated following of fans from the neighborhood and beyond. Filmmaker <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130918041421/http://www.franbro.com/">Dave Mack</a> was on hand for  the tearful goodbye and created a touching and fitting <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130918041421/https://vimeo.com/71395242">film farewell</a> to the longtime restaurant. </p>

<p>Soundtracked to &quot;Melancholy Serenade&quot; by native son Jackie Gleason, the film captures the layers of history, painted out in grease stains, framed pictures and multitudes of menus. Owner Nick Imirziades speaks to regulars with the dazed expression, taking in the scene for one last time. </p>

<p>Even if you never set foot in the restaurant, you&apos;ll feel the melancholy pang as another piece of New York City&apos;s soul fades into memory.</p>
