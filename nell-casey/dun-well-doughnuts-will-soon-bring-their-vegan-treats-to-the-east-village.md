<p>Five years after debuting their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170626084102/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/06/dun-well_doughnuts_opens_today.php">brick-and-mortar</a> vegan doughnut shop in East Williamsburg, the team at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170626084102/http://dunwelldoughnuts.com/index.html">Dun-Well Doughnuts</a> are expanding across the East River to the East Village, opening up a new doughnut shop on St. Mark&apos;s Place. We spoke with owner Dan Dunbar, who tells us they&apos;re aiming for a soft open in about two weeks, with the whole shebang ready to fly sometime in July. They have the signage up out front and some pictures on the wall, so things seem to be progressing nicely.</p>

Dunbar says the operation will be very similar to their Brooklyn original, with their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170626084102/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/06/the_best_doughnuts_in_nyc.php">full lineup of vegan doughnuts</a> and pastries like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170626084102/https://www.instagram.com/p/BDQjViZBN5R/?taken-by=dunwelldoughnuts">pull-aparts</a>, which they&apos;ll shuttle in daily from Montrose Avenue. &quot;Right now it&apos;s a doughnut and coffee shop,&quot; according to Dunbar, who hopes to have their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170626084102/https://www.instagram.com/p/BHFBenLBue8/?taken-by=dunwelldoughnuts">ice cream operation</a> at the Manhattan spot at some point, too. Espresso drinks, Brooklyn egg creams, tea and lemonade will all be available at the St. Mark&apos;s shop. 
<br><br>
The new Dun-Well&apos;s a much smaller version than its Brooklyn counterpart, with about 60- to 70-square feet for customers with a counter and a few benches. The tiny space at 102 St. Mark&apos;s Place has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170626084102/http://evgrieve.com/2016/06/brooklyns-dun-well-doughnuts-opening.html">housed several other single-item shops</a> in recent years, but with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170626084102/http://gothamist.com/tags/vegan">vegan fervor</a> at an all-time high, these guys don&apos;t have much to worry about.
