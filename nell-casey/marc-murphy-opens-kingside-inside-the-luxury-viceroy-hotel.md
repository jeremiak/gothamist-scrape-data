The luxury hotel, which opened last month, boasts rates hovering around $600 per night; the all day restaurant follows suit with small plates running between $13 - $20 and large plates between $19 (a burger) - $36. Murphy also includes the now-popular &quot;For Two&quot; option, in which a $65 roast chicken is the least expensive offering. </p>

<p>The New American menu includes touches of French and Italian influence, like the Roasted Snails ($17) made more decadent with bone marrow and garlic butter; Cervella di Vitello ($16)&#x2014;that would be calf brain&#x2014;in a fragrant caper, lemon and brown butter application; and Seared Tuna ($36) with wild mushrooms and braised radish. Ever popular kale comes grilled with goat cheese, olives, almonds and lemon vinaigrette ($15), as does the octopus ($18) with crispy chorizo and roasted potatoes. </p>

<p>Ballers and bankers can order a 32 ounce Cowboy Rib Eye for two ($95) done up with roasted bone marrow, butter and watercress; those of more modest means can nosh the aforementioned burger, which comes topped with giardiniera relish, soppressata and white cheddar. Raw bar (oysters, crudos, anchovies), charcuterie/cheese plates and hearty sides (fennel gratin, fregula mac and cheese, roasted veggies) round out the large menu.</p>

<p>Roman &amp; Williams, the design firm behind <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429064833/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/19/inside_lafayette.php">Lafayette&apos;s charming interior</a>, created a more spartan aesthetic here, including a floor mimicking a chess board (hence the name) with pops of color from bright red bar chairs. There&apos;s room for 32 between both bars, one of which overlooks a kitchen area. The globe trotting wine list includes vintages from New Zealand, Italy, Spain and beyond, available &quot;by the quartino,&quot; half or full bottle. They&apos;ve got the standard cocktails on offer plus a few creations of their own, like the Walter + Savannah ($16) with Woodford Reserve, walnut syrup, peach and lemon.  </p>
