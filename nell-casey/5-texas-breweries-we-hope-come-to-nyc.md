<p>After years of waiting, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231084159/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/11/shiner_beer_finally_coming_to_new_y.php">Shiner beer is finally coming to NYC</a>, which got us thinking about our other favorite Texan beers that we miss out on up north. Perhaps because so many German immigrants settled in the state in the mid-19th century, Texas has a strong craft brewing scene and relationship to beer. Here are some of our favorite breweries we wish would distribute to New York City:</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231084159/http://www.liveoakbrewing.com/">Live Oak Brewing Company</a></strong>: We visited this tiny east Austin brewery years ago and got hooked on their delicious suds and  inspired by the brewery&apos;s clear passion for their product. They use a style of brewing not typically found in the States, which gives the beers a &quot;rich maltiness&quot; akin to central European beers. We particularly love their crisp Pilz brew and extra hoppy Liberation Ale. Sadly, it will be &quot;quite some time&quot; before we see their brews up north, as the brewery will first have to bottle or can their beers. Brewer Chip McElroy tells us packaging plans are two years away.  </p>

<p><strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231084159/http://www.saintarnold.com/">Saint Arnold</a></strong>: As Texas&apos;s oldest craft brewery, Saint Arnold&apos;s roots are firmly planted in the state, so the likelihood that they come up here are slim. Per their website: &quot;Saint Arnold is available in Texas and only in Texas and it will always be that way. And in Louisiana too. No, we aren&apos;t going into any other states. Unless we do.&quot; <em>So you&apos;re saying there&apos;s a chance&#x2026;?</em> Still, we can dream, and when we dream it&apos;s about the Houston-based brewery&apos;s delightfully bitter <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231084159/http://www.saintarnold.com/beers/elissa.html">Elissa IPA</a> and their knockout seasonal <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231084159/http://www.saintarnold.com/beers/christmas.html">Christmas Ale</a>.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231084159/http://www.independencebrewing.com/">Independence Brewing Co.</a></strong>: Since 2004, husband and wife brewers Amy and Rob Cartwright have been churning out a variety of year-round and seasonal beers from a warehouse in south Austin. All their brews are great, but their hometown pride Austin Amber is a great go-to beer when you want one or 10 drinks after a long day at the office. They brewery is currently expanding with a new bottler, but nothing set in stone about moving out of state. &quot;It&apos;s more of a volume restriction right now,&quot; they told us. &quot;If we&apos;re not filling all the shelves in Central Texas then we&apos;re not shipping out of state yet. But interest is certainly there!&quot;</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231084159/http://www.rahrbrewing.com/">Rahr and Sons</a></strong>: With brews called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231084159/http://www.rahrbrewing.com/our-beers/year-round-beers/buffalo-butt.html">Buffalo Butt</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231084159/http://www.rahrbrewing.com/our-beers/year-round-beers/ugly-pug.html">Ugly Pug</a> you can tell this Fort Worth brewery has as much fun making their beer as you will drinking it. The award-winning Ugly Pug&#x2014;named for brewer Fritz Rahr&apos;s mother-in-law&apos;s dog&#x2014;has notes of chocolate and coffee and proves that dark beers don&apos;t have to just be rich and heavy. The brewery told us they&apos;re only in Texas for now but &quot;do hope to be all over someday, We&apos;re working on it!&quot; Excellent.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231084159/http://realalebrewing.com/">Real Ale</a></strong>: Like Shiner, Real Ale put down its roots in the Texas Hill Country, specifically the tiny town of Blanco. The brewery began in 1996 in the basement of an antiques store and has since grown to a multi-acre brewsite just outside the town limits. The brewery puts out a variety of ales, IPAs and even a barleywine. If you find yourself in Texas, look for the Devil&apos;s Backbone, a &quot;deceptively strong&quot; Belgian-style tripel made with imported hops and yeast with candy sugar added to reach the 8.10% ABV. If you desire something stronger still, the Sisyphus Barleywine Ale packs a 11% ABV punch with flavors of toffee. The brewery currently has no plans to expand to NYC but we&apos;re keeping the hope alive anyway. </p>
