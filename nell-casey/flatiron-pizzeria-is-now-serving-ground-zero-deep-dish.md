Bravo Pizza on 5th Avenue, one of several in a chainlet hawking serviceable slices in Manhattan, recently unveiled a new redesign of their pie menu, which includes &quot;Ground Zero Deep Dish&quot; slices. Never forget that deep dish <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110104343/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/14/jon_stewart_pizza_chicago.php">isn&apos;t really pizza</a>.</p>

<p>Reached by phone today, Mike Steinberg, who owns the 5th Avenue location, said the pizzeria is in the process of rebranding and expanding, including a new name: Big Slice of New York. Pies have been renamed after things that reference New York, like an Empire State Buffalo Chicken and a SoHo BBQ Chicken. &quot;All different types of landmarks,&quot; Steinberg explained, and one of those landmarks includes Ground Zero, where nearly 3,000 people were killed.</p>

<p>&quot;I was thinking about taking that off, because I don&apos;t know if we should put that on,&quot; Steinberg, a Long Island native, replied when asked about the name choice. &quot;Those aren&apos;t the names exactly, it&apos;s trial and error. I don&apos;t want anybody to take it the wrong way, so that&apos;s why I&apos;m probably going to change it.&quot; </p>

<p>Triangle Shirtwaist Neapolitan really rolls off the tongue. </p>
