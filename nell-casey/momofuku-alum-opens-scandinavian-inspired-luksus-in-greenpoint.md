<p>Chef Daniel Burns&apos;s new 26-seat restaurant <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506175923/http://www.luksusnyc.com/">Luksus</a> opened earlier this week in a small dining room at the back of beer bar <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506175923/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/13/the_flux_capacitor_has_landed_trst.php#photo-1">T&#xF8;rst</a> in Greenpoint. Burns&#x2014;who was Head of Research and Development of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506175923/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_E5M_SEAUA">Momofuku Kitchen Lab</a>&#x2014;offers an &quot;ever evolving&quot; five-course tasting menu ($75) at his new venture, which draws inspiration from Scandinavian flavors and techniques using American, seasonally-inspired ingredients. </p>

<p>Each meal begins with &quot;snacks,&quot; which currently includes a ham chip dusted with vinegar powder, made with dehydrated and fried Broadbent country ham pureed with tapioca pearls.  Also on the opening menu, a salad composed of Braised Little Gem lettuce, grilled pea broth, roasted mushrooms and mint oil with a soft boiled egg yolk. For a bit of sweet, Burns offers Beets and Rhubarb: juiced rhubarb mousse topped with pea and anise hyssop sorbet and Italian beet meringue. </p>

<p>As you would expect, imbibing options draw from T&#xF8;rst&apos;s impressive beer selection. Bar co-owner Jeppe Jarnit-Bjergs&#xF8; created an accompanying beer pairing ($45 supplement) from the bar&apos;s stock, including brews specially made for the restaurant and a selection of hard-to-find Evil Twin Brewing varieties. </p>

<p>Though the name of the restaurant means &quot;luxury&quot; in Danish, the appointments are clean and spare like the decor of its sister bar. An orderly row of oak and reclaimed wood tables lines one wall, with stools set up along a marble counter along the other, offering diners a front-row seat to the kitchen through the large glass window. Getting a reservation in these early weeks might be difficult, with many nights already at capacity. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506175923/http://www.luksusnyc.com/reservations">Online reservations</a> are preferred, but you can also call the restaurant between noon and 4 p.m., Tuesday through Friday, and try your luck that way. </p>

<p><em>615 Manhattan Avenue in Greenpoint, Brooklyn (718) 389-6034, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506175923/http://www.luksusnyc.com/">luksusnyc.com</a>. Open Tuesday through Friday with reservation times beginning at 6:30 p.m.</em></p>
