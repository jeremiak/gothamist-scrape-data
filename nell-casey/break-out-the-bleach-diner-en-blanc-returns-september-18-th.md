<p>The white-out Parisian pop-up picnic returns for its third New York City incarnation this month, which also coincides with the 25th anniversary of the original event. Last year the fete <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130908051712/http://gothamist.com/2012/08/21/photos_diner_en_blanc_1.php#photo-1">took over Lincoln Center plaza</a> but you won&apos;t find out which &quot;landmark location&quot; you&apos;re setting up your alabaster dinner in until half an hour before the event begins. Time to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130908051712/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/29/picnic_basket.php">get that Citi Bike membership</a>!</p>

<p>For the uninitiated: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130908051712/http://newyork.dinerenblanc.info/">Diner en Blanc</a> invites guests to dress head to toe in &quot;elegant white&quot; attire and bring accoutrement for a fancy picnic, including a table, chairs and a white tablecloth. Diners bring their own meals as well and this year a Master Sommelier will also be pouring Bordeaux Wine, which will be available for purchase.</p>
