<p>We&apos;ll stuff a lobster roll in our faces pretty much anytime of the year but something hot, melty and lobstery fits better with the chilly weather. So say hello to the latest winter offering from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131114231807/http://lukeslobster.com/">Luke&apos;s Lobster</a>: Lobster Mac &apos;n Cheese. Not content with just <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131114231807/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/06/lukes_lobster_introduces_winter_men.php">one cheesy option</a>, co-owner Ben Conniff tells us hey&apos;re adding this creamy concoction to their winter menu starting today and, with the exception of Plaza Hall, the decadent dish will be available at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131114231807/http://lukeslobster.com/shacks/">all of their outposts</a>.</p>

<p>So what awaits when you tuck into a steaming bowl-o-mac? The Luke&apos;s team tasked Maine&apos;s Hurricane Soup&#x2014;the same folks who created their delish chowders and bisques&#x2014;with creating the sauce, which uses creamy cheddar from Pineland Farms. The crew lovingly mixes up each batch to order to prevent the delicate lobster from getting gummy inside the pasta. </p>

<p>Luke&apos;s also brought back their popular Lobster Grilled Cheese, featuring hunks of lobster, nutty gruyere cheese and buttered white bread. Thank goodness for bulky winter jackets!</p>

<p>Both of these gut-busting treats go for $12, which is $3 less than their traditional lobster rolls. They&apos;re also offering Red Jacket Orchard&#x2019;s hot apple cider to complete your New England-inspired gorging. </p>
