<p>New York City moved up a rank <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130727020930/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/24/new_york_state_ranks_25th_on_the_lo.php">on the locavore index</a> today with the release of Brooklyn Brewery&apos;s new local grain-sourced beer. Greenmarket Wheat, a collaboration with nonprofit greenmarket organizers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130727020930/http://www.grownyc.org/">GrowNYC</a>, uses products sourced from within 200 miles of the brewery to formulate this special brew. Wheat comes from upstate&apos;s Watertown, barley from Hadley, Massachusetts and honey from bees who reside in Chemung County, NY. </p>

<p>Brooklyn Brewery typically sources its grains from other points on the globe like Canada, Belgium and Japan. &quot;Up until the last couple of years, there have been no New York state grains available,&quot; Brewery president and co-founder Steve Hindy <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130727020930/http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20130619/HOSPITALITY_TOURISM/130619859">told Crains</a>. &quot;And that&apos;s the point of the project, to encourage New York state farmers to grow wheat and barley.&quot; </p>

<p>So far, the brewery has made about 6,000 bottles of beer, but hopefully this is just the beginning of flavors sourced nearby. Governor Cuomo&apos;s 2012 Farm Brewery License legislation made it possible for Greenmarkets to sell locally made beer, thus increasing production of beer-making products within the state. The new brew will be available at the Union Square Greenmarket, restaurants like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130727020930/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/03/stalled_construction_site_becomes_l.php#photo-1">Riverpark</a> and also at Whole Foods. </p>
