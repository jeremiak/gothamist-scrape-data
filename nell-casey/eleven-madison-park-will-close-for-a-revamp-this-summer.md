<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171008102047/http://www.elevenmadisonpark.com/">Eleven Madison Park</a>, one of the city&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171008102047/http://gothamist.com/2013/12/30/restaurant_map.php">most decorated restaurants</a>, will close this summer to completely overhaul the space and the menu. Owners Will Guidara and Daniel Humm <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171008102047/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/21/dining/eleven-madison-park-renovation-hamptons.html">revealed their plans to the Times</a>, telling the paper it was &quot;time for a change.&quot; </p>

<p>On June 9th, the restaurant will close to begin renovations, addressing issues like an out-of-date kitchen and altering the restaurant&apos;s Art Deco design with something more contemporary. Guidara and Humm bought the restaurant from Danny Meyer in 2011 and haven&apos;t made major changes since then.</p>

<p>Brad Cloepfil, who&apos;s been brought on board for the alterations, promises not to horrify NYC&apos;s dining elite with the grand changes. &quot;I&apos;m not making a design statement,&quot; he told the paper of record. &quot;If people are startled, I will have failed.&quot;</p>

<p>Changes extend to Humm&apos;s menu, too, though he hasn&apos;t released specifics. Before the big overhaul, EMP will do a greatest hits tour of sorts, including some whimsical dishes from their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171008102047/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/28/beloved_eleven_madison_park_is_maki.php">tenure at the restaurant</a>:</p>

<blockquote>In mid-April, before Eleven Madison Park closes, the partners will replace its current menu with an 11-course, $295 tasting menu recalling favorites over the years. Dishes will include sea urchin cappuccino, carrot tartare, foie gras with maple syrup, poached chicken with black truffles, and the creamy-crunchy dessert called Milk and Honey.</blockquote>

<p>The restaurant&apos;s staff won&apos;t be left completely in the lurch, as the team will be opening up a Hamptons restaurant, EMP Summer House, in late June that&apos;ll be staffed by current workers at Eleven Madison Park. A representative for the restaurant tells Gothamist that housing and transportation to the temporary restaurant will be provided to employees. </p>

<p>One potential sticky wicket: the restaurant <em>only</em> accepts American Express and only AMEX cardholders will be able to make reservations. So...time to get one of those fancy blue cards or find a rich bankroller in the Hamptons who already has one. </p>

<p>Humm and Guidara are also in the midst of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171008102047/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/08/eleven_madison_park_fast_casual.php">opening a fast casual concept</a>, Made Nice, in the Flatiron. The rep also tells us they&apos;re awaiting ConEd&apos;s go-ahead and they&apos;ll be ready.</p>
