<p>A taste of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170621202726/http://gothamist.com/tags/flashback">old New York</a> will remain on the Upper East Side&apos;s Lexington Avenue, where longtime restaurant Donohue&apos;s Steak House received a reprieve. The 67-year-old restaurant was poised to shut down this week after failed negotiations with the landlord; now, however, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170621202726/http://nypost.com/2017/06/21/steak-house-to-the-stars-strikes-last-minute-deal-with-landlord/">the Post reports</a> that a last-minute lease has been inked, ensuring that the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170621202726/https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/31/style/at-donohues-a-nightly-steak-a-life-gone-by.html">many regulars</a> will be able to eat their steaks and burgers for at least the next decade.</p>

<p>Owner Maureen Donohue-Peters and her landlord agreed to a $22,000-per-month lease, which is reportedly not a dramatic increase from the previous lease. Donohue-Peters also divulged news of a new Donohue&apos;s that she&apos;ll open <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170621202726/http://www.westsiderag.com/2017/06/21/classic-nyc-steakhouse-donohues-moving-into-long-vacant-uws-spot">in the former PD Hurley&apos;s space</a> on the Upper West Side. Luckily, the building that will house the new restaurant is owned by her family. From the Post: </p>

<blockquote>Donohue&#x2019;s, opened in 1950, is a time capsule of Eisenhower-era Manhattan with wood-paneled walls, a checkerboard tile floor and red tablecloths. US Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy and former top cop Bill Bratton and his wife, Rikki Kleiman, have been spotted in black-leather booths. All walks of life mingle easily at a moodily lit bar at the front of the house.</blockquote>

<p>&quot;The restaurant is an extension of my living and dining room,&quot; Donohue-Peters <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170621202726/https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/31/style/at-donohues-a-nightly-steak-a-life-gone-by.html">told the Times</a> in a profile from 2015. &quot;No one comes in here high on a horse. Whether they&apos;re making $12,000 a year or $25 million a year, all my customers are treated the same.&quot;</p>
