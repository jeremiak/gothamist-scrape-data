---

	
										<p><em>Beer cheese, pub cheese&#x2014;whatever name you know it by, there&apos;s no denying the addictive qualities of this dairy-heavy spread. Though similar, it&apos;s not to be confused with its Southern counterpart <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506175910/http://gothamist.com/2012/08/28/where_to_get_the_best_pimento_chees.php">Pimento cheese</a>, most notably because a delightful boozy component not found in its regional counterpart. This cheesy concoction finds its roots in Kentucky, where a man named <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506175910/http://www.allmansbeercheese.com/history.html">Johnny Allman</a> developed his &quot;Snappy Cheese&quot; recipe in the 1930&apos;s. Fast forward to today and you&apos;ll find a variety of state-based brands mixing up their own ratios of cheese, beer and spices&#x2014;a few have even crossed state lines. </em></p><em>

</em><p><em>We&apos;re always down for something cheesy to enjoy over a few pints, so we&apos;re cluing you in to this delectable spread and where to find it around town. It&apos;s not all-inclusive, so tell us we don&apos;t know Monterey Jack about the real deal in the comments.</em></p>

<p><strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506175910/http://www.earlsny.com/">EARL&apos;S BEER &amp; CHEESE:</a></strong> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506175910/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig4jbcU9db0">Holy schnikes</a> does this diminutive Carnegie Hill joint have some delicious Beer Cheese. Creamy, fluffy, flavorful; it has all the qualities you look for in an outstanding snack. They&apos;re using a well-balanced NY State Cheddar and their house lager as a base, whipping until mostly smooth but with a few morsels of cheese still intact. Earl&apos;s serves its spread with thick slices of well toasted, crusty bread and a tiny bowl of raw garlic. Don&apos;t be shy! Rub the raw garlic all over your toast, slather with the salty cheese mixture and go to town. The $7 regular size can feed one very hungry person&#x2014;or possibly two if you&apos;re sharing another dish&#x2014;with the jumbo size ($12) enough to feed three to four. </p>

His version of Pub Cheese ($9) arrives as a schmeer of bright purple cheese flecked with pistachio-fig brittle and accompanied by thin, golden brown &quot;potato chips.&quot; It&apos;s technically not a &quot;beer&quot; cheese, as the chef mixes cheddar and cream cheeses with red wine for that gorgeous lavender hue, but it&apos;s rooted in the traditional spirit of the dish&#x2014;and god damn delicious to boot.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506175910/http://www.brooklynbuschenschank.com/index.html">BUSCHENSHANK:</a></strong> This Carroll Gardens tavern puts a Germanic twist on its spicy <em>bier</em> cheese, serving it up with a huge soft pretzel and a ramekin of coarse ground mustard. Their unusual blend of cheeses&#x2014;grueyere, brie, cheddar and Parmigiano-Reggiano&#x2014;gets a kick from both cayenne and sriracha, which leaves a fiery flavor right at the back of your throat. Pair it with a liter of crisp Radeberger or a Hacker Pschorr Maibock to cut some of the fat and heat.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506175910/http://www.floydeats.com/">FLOYD BEER CHEESE:</a></strong> A few Kentucky natives who emigrated to Brooklyn developed their own version of the hometown favorite, inspired by visits to Halls On The River&#x2014;the aforementioned birthplace of beer cheese&#x2014;when they lived at home. Jim Carden and Andrew Templar opened Brooklyn&apos;s Floyd in 2004 and began selling their beer cheese on the bar&apos;s menu. Eventually the duo partnered with Kevin Avanzato to open both Union Hall and The Bell House, where they also put their cheesy creation on the menu.</p>

<p>Though Carden tells us the recipe is &quot;guarded,&quot; he does reveal they source their sharp cheddar from upstate New York and that a &quot;local craft brewery&quot; provides the crisp lager in the mix. Floyd Beer Cheese doesn&apos;t rock the same garlicky power punch as its brethren, favoring instead a more subtle spice flavor that lets the inherent funk of the cheese shine through. They also offer Spicy Jalapeno&#x2014;with lots of fresh chili flavor&#x2014;and Smokey Bacon flavors.</p>

<p><em>Floyd Beer Cheese is available at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506175910/http://www.unionhallny.com/">Union Hall</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506175910/http://www.thebellhouseny.com/">The Bell House</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506175910/http://www.floydny.com/">Floyd</a> bars in Brooklyn, as well as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506175910/http://www.floydeats.com/locations.php">retail outlets throughout the city; </a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506175910/http://www.floydeats.com/">floydeats.com</a></em></p>
