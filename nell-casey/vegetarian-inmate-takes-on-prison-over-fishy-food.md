Howard Cosby, who has been incarcerated in the Corrigan-Radgowski Correctional Institution in Connecticut, claims the prison has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130910220504/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/buddhist-inmate-teams-peta-save-fish-death-article-1.1444721">served him fish three times a week</a> despite his required animal-free diet. After repeated administrative complaints were ignored by prison officials, Cosby has made an appeal to PETA for help.<p></p>

<p>According to the corrections facility, fish doesn&apos;t qualify as meat and therefore Cosby&apos;s diet has met the criteria for vegetarian. &quot;Cleary fish is meat,&quot; Jeff Kerr, an attorney for PETA <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130910220504/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/buddhist-inmate-teams-peta-save-fish-death-article-1.1444721#ixzz2dw05R26K">told the Daily News</a>. &quot;They have thoughts. They have interests. They have a central nervous system. They are not swimming vegetables.&quot; A letter was sent to the warden yesterday citing the federal Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act, which requires prisons to abide by inmates&apos; religious observances whenever possible. So far the prison has declined to comment.</p>

<p>The organization hopes the prison will follow with other institutions who have capitulated to inmates&apos; dietary requests. &quot;We can&apos;t imagine they would want to make a federal case out of this,&quot; Kerr said. &quot;It seems so simple to just comply with his request, as the federal law requires them to do.&quot; Inmates in other facilities have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130910220504/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/27/former_rikers_inmate_prison_food_is.php">suffered grievously</a> at the hands of strict mealtime rules that ignore preexisting dietary and lifestyle requirements. </p>
