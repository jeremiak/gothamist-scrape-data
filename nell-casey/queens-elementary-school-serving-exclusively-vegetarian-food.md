<p>Elementary school kids at a Flushing school won&apos;t be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604041416/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/01/ammonia-treated_meat_still_good_eno.php">subjected to the horrors of pink slime</a> anymore! PS 244 in Queens is now the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604041416/http://schools.nyc.gov/Offices/mediarelations/NewsandSpeeches/2012-2013/043013_menufivedays.htm">first public school in the country to serve exclusively vegetarian food</a>. Schools Chancellor Dennis Walcott announced the initiative yesterday and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604041416/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/queens/queens-school-serves-all-vegetarian-fare-article-1.1331690?localLinksEnabled=false">dined in the cafeteria</a> to sample the meat-free meal himself. On the menu: black bean and cheddar quesadillas with salsa and red roasted potatoes and broccoli. </p>

<p>Earlier this year PS 244 began offering vegetarian items at lunch and based on the student&apos;s reactions decided to make the leap to all vegetarian all the time. &quot;We discovered early on that our kids were gravitating toward our vegetarian offerings, and we kept expanding the program to meet the demand,&quot; explained Principal Robert Groff in a statement. The school partnered with the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604041416/http://www.healthyschoolfood.org/">New York Coalition for Health School Food</a>, a non-profit organization dedicated to &quot;introducing plant-based foods and nutrition education in schools,&quot; to create the veggie-centric meals. Future meal offerings include roasted chickpeas, braised black beans with plantains, tofu veggie wraps, vegetarian chili with brown rice and roasted tofu with Asian sesame sauce. </p>

<p>But are the kids really going for this meat-free menu change? Apparently so! &quot;My favorite food has to be rice and beans with mashed potatoes, but not the ones with a lot of salt. The ones with a lot of protein and nutrition,&#x201D; third-grader Simran Puri <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604041416/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/queens/garden_variety_school_lunches_J5vR0TscuZi8QMz71kzNsJ?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Queens&quot;">explained to the Post</a>. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s much more healthier. It helps to make our bodies stronger.&#x201D; The school also made Fridays into a weekly pizza party, which makes sense since <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604041416/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/26/pizza_is_still_a_vegetable_us_annou.php">we all know pizza is a vegetable</a>.</p>
