<p>Clinton Hill&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160813160747/http://pizzalovesemily.com/">Emily</a> turns out some of the city&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160813160747/http://gothamist.com/2015/11/04/best_new_pizzerias_nyc.php">most delicious circular pies</a> and now the team is set to debut what are bound to be equally delicious square pies in Williamsburg. Emily and Matt Hyland <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160813160747/http://gothamist.com/2015/11/05/emily_pizza_expanding.php">told the world last year</a> about their plans to make Detroit-style square pies along with Paulie Gee&apos;s alum Lou Tomczak in a small space near their Fulton Street digs. But now the team has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160813160747/http://www.grubstreet.com/2016/02/emmy-squared-williamsburg-coming-soon.html&quot;">revealed to Grub Street</a> that they&apos;ll actually be taking their new operation, Emmy Squared, to Williamsburg.</p>

<p>It seems that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160813160747/http://gothamist.com/2015/07/21/bill_bakers_williamsburg.php#photo-1">well-appointed</a>&#x2014;if off the beaten track&#x2014;Bill Baker&apos;s on Grand Street will be the Hyland&apos;s new home, where they&apos;ll be dishing up the pizzas plus red sauce Italian sandwiches like chicken parm and an Italian combo. The trio tell Grub Street with the new larger space they&apos;ll also be utilizing the on-site bar, plus may add additional topping options and &quot;snacks&quot; of some kind. They&apos;re expected to open this spring.</p>

<p>A bigger name like Emily is likely to do better in the space than a newcomer like Bill Baker&apos;s. The somewhat tucked away restaurant right next to the BQE on-ramp likely didn&apos;t get the kind of foot traffic needed to fill out a restaurant of that size, but Emily has become something of a food destination, both for their pizzas and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160813160747/http://gothamist.com/2015/07/06/a_pizzeria_serves_one_of_brooklyns.php">top-notch burger</a>, and checklist eaters will most certainly make a trip to try out their new offerings.</p>
