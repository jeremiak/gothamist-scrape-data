					<p>Will New Yorkers follow suit with the people of Tokyo and line up to eat steak standing up? The folks behind <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508190358/http://ikinaristeakusa.com/">Ikinari Steak</a> are betting so, opening up the first United States location of their standing steakhouse concept that&apos;s blown up in Japan since first opening in 2013. They&apos;ve taken on a space on East 10th Street, an area that&apos;s already used to the queues from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508190358/http://gothamist.com/2016/12/16/tim_ho_wan_lines.php">nearby Tim Ho Wan</a> and stalwart Ippudo around the corner.<br>
 <br>
The concept&apos;s something a little different to NYC, without even taking into consideration the lack of chairs. Diners are assigned a station where servers mingle to take drink and side dish orders. Each diner or duo (there&apos;s really not a lot of space for groups here) gets a number that they take to the butchery/kitchen area to order their steaks.</p>

<span class="photo_caption">Standing room only (literally)</span>
<br><br>
There are only a few things you need to decide about your steak. First, the cut, choosing between decadent Japan Cut Ribeye, meatier Sirloin or tender Filet. Next: size. Steaks are cut and priced to order, ranging anywhere from 300 grams (10.6 ounces) of Ribeye for $27 at 9 cents a gram, up to 1,000 grams (35.3 ounces) of Filet for $110 at 11 cents a gram. 
<br><br>
Once cooked to rare (recommended by the restaurant), the steaks are delivered sizzling in a cast iron skillet to your station, where they can keep cooking to a desired temp or be devoured instantly. Those who like steaks well done, be forewarned: letting the steak hang out for a bit might get it to medium, but not a whole lot more. 
<br><br>
At each station wait a bevy of different sauces and condiments, though steaks are already garnished with a garlic paste and fried garlic chips. Thermoses of J-Sauce, a soy sauced-based umami bomb, are table-side&#x2014;you&apos;ll understand why they provide you with paper aprons once you&apos;ve drizzled it all over the meat. There are also tubs of wasabi (very good on steak), salt/pepper, garlic and a sweet Ikinari steak sauce. 
<br><br>
There&apos;s nothing in the way of appetizers&#x2014;meals are supposed to take around 30 minutes start to finish&#x2014;but the steaks come with corn and onions, and you can also order salads, soups and rice. At last night&apos;s press preview, we found the onion dressing to be of particular note, as well as the crunchy, garlic-infused pepper rice. 
<br><br>
Spots <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508190358/http://gothamist.com/2015/03/02/ramen_lab_best_ramen.php">like Ramen Lab</a> have tested out the standing-only method, and while it wouldn&apos;t suit a leisurely meal, the rapid fire dining style employed here benefits from no chairs. Your body also gets a bit of a break; somehow standing doesn&apos;t make you feel as full after eating a huge hunk of steak.
<br><br>
Ikinari Steak opens tomorrow, February 23rd, serving dinner in addition to lunch specials for $20. All menu prices are inclusive of gratuity, making this one of the cheaper ways to fill up on cow.
