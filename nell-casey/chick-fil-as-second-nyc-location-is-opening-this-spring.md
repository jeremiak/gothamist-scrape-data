<p>As they <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160813175448/http://gothamist.com/2014/04/08/chick-fil-a_opening_multiple_nyc_re.php">threatened last year</a>, Chick-fil-A has begun phase two of its infiltration of New York City with the announcement of its <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160813175448/http://inside.chick-fil-a.com/chick-fil-a-set-to-open-second-new-york-city-location-april-2/">second Manhattan location</a> due to open this spring. The controversial fried chicken chain reveals their next conquest will be at West 46th Street and 6th Avenue, a neighborhood well situated for both office workers and tourists clamoring for a view of a big <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160813175448/http://gothamist.com/2015/11/05/tree_died_for_freedom.php">dead tree</a> and lunch from another chain restaurant&#x2014;just what <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160813175448/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/06/best_lunch_midtown_west.php">the area needs</a>.</p>

<p>The new store will be about the same size as its <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160813175448/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/01/inside_chickfila_nyc.php#photo-1">Herald Square sibling</a> and will also boast multiple floors of cholesterol-increasing service. They&apos;re implementing a tablet-based ordering system to streamline the flow of customers and are even appealing to NYC&apos;s locavore obsession by employing bread products from nearby bakeries in New Jersey and Brooklyn. There&apos;s also the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160813175448/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/08/are_nyc_hipster_farmers_abandoning.php">surplus of backyard chickens</a> to consider!</p>

<p>There&apos;s likely to be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160813175448/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/04/bad_chicken_protesters_picket_outsi.php">more protesting</a> with this second opening, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160813175448/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/18/chick-fil-a_president_prays_for_arr.php">with good reason</a>.  </p>
