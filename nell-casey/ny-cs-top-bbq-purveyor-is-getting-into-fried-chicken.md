<p>If you haven&apos;t yet made the pilgrimage to Red Hook&apos;s Hometown BBQ, stop reading this post and immediately start walking.  Pitmaster Billy Durney smokes up some of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110083707/http://gothamist.com/2015/05/28/best_bbq_nyc.php">best meat in town</a>, especially his coveted thick slab pastrami bacon, which illicits moans from all lucky enough to make it to the end of the line and find portions still available. Yes, it&apos;s that good.</p>

<p>But Durney looks to be branching out from his bbq roots and expanding into the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110083707/http://gothamist.com/2015/09/01/nyc_chicken_lovers_guide.php">ever-growing</a> fried chicken market. Durney <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110083707/http://ny.eater.com/2016/1/29/10862172/hometown-fried-chicken-red-hook">spoke with Eater</a> about plans for Hometown Fried Chicken, which he&apos;ll open at 329 Van Brunt Street this summer. Unlike Hometown BBQ, the chicken joint will offer a large takeout and delivery operation&#x2014;including a dedicated take-out window off the kitchen&#x2014;with seating for 30 or 40 inside.</p>

<p>It&apos;s too early to talk recipes and menus&#x2014;Durney told Eater he&apos;s not going to &quot;open the door until [he&apos;s] satisfied with the product&quot;&#x2014;but the team is continuing on nine months of recipe testing, including plans to bring in a pastry specialist to handle biscuits and donuts. The operation as of now seems pretty down-home, with the chicken possibly fried in a cast iron skillet. </p>

<p>Durney isn&apos;t the only pitmaster getting his fry on. Last year, Dan Delaney of Delaney Barbecue <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110083707/http://gothamist.com/2015/09/23/delaney_chicken_urbanspace_vanderbi.php">debuted a fried chicken concept</a> inside the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110083707/http://gothamist.com/2015/09/18/urbanspace_vanderbilt_food_hall.php#photo-1">new UrbanSpace Vanderbilt market</a>. </p>
