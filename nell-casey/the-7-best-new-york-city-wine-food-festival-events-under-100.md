title: The 7 Best New York City Wine & Food Festival Events Under $100
---

	
										<p><em>The foodiot feeding frenzy known as the New York City Wine &amp; Food Festival doesn&apos;t unleash its Celebrity Chef-driven spectacle on us until mid-October, but the time to buy tickets is now, before the quality events are sold out and you&apos;re stuck eating graham crackers in the parking lot. There are nearly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110103312/http://nycwff.org/events/">100 events</a> dedicated to stuffing your face happening between October 13th and 16th, from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110103312/http://nycwff.org/grand-tasting-presented-by-shoprite-sat-3/">enormous tasting events</a> to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110103312/http://nycwff.org/event-type/intimate-dinner/">intimate dinners</a> to classes <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110103312/http://nycwff.org/master-sushi-rolling-class/">taught by renowned chefs</a>. Many of these button-popping experiences also come with a hefty price tag, with some topping out in the $350 range. </em></p><em>

</em><p><em>But organizers always leave room for the thrifty with plenty of events $100 and under (just barely under, really); here are our recommendations to make the most for your money/calorie intake.</em></p>
