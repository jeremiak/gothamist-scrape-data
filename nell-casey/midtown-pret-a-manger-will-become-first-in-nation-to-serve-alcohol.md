<p>Pret A Manger&#x2014;Manhattan&apos;s de facto lunch spot and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171015115943/http://gothamist.com/2013/12/30/woman_finds_frog_in_pret_a_manger_s.php">frog mausoleum</a>&#x2014;previously only offered buzzes of the caffeine variety, but a forthcoming location at Penn Station will take it to the next level by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171015115943/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNBK1QCgTCE">getting you drunk</a>. The boozy Power Lunch just isn&apos;t what it used to be.</p>

<p>The massive new Pret, which will dwarf most of the miniscule Midtown spots by two, will serve wine and beer, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171015115943/http://nypost.com/2017/04/17/penn-stations-new-pret-a-manger-will-serve-booze/">the Post reports</a>. A u-shaped bar for 12 anchors the new cafe, where customers can order beer in bottles or on tap in addition to wine sourced from places including California and Italy. </p>

<p>The concept of alcohol alongside packaged sandwiches has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171015115943/http://now-here-this.timeout.com/2015/04/09/pret-a-manger-have-opened-their-first-proper-evening-restaurant/">already been executed</a> in London, where the chain began, but this will be the first stateside Pret to offer adult beverages, and is a test site for further expansion in the United States.</p>

<p>Chains like Starbucks have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171015115943/http://gothamist.com/2015/08/17/starbucks_williamsburg_booze.php">dabbled in alcohol sales</a>, only to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171015115943/http://ourbksocial.com/williamsburg-starbucks-will-no-longer-sell-alcohol/">discontinue the service</a> in all but one NYC location: Herald Square, coincidentally.</p>
