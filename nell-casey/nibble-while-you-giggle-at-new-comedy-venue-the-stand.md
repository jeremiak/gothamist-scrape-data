<p>Open wide for another comedy venue: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428142928/http://www.thestandnyc.com/">The Stand</a> unleashes its comedic stylings upon us in Gramercy tomorrow night. The hybrid restaurant/comedy club offers not only the chance to chuckle along to noted comedians but also the opportunity to snag a decent meal while you&apos;re at it. </p>

<p>The restaurant portion of the venue serves up a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428142928/http://www.thestandnyc.com/menu-upstairs/">menu of &quot;upscale&quot; comfort food</a> with familiar offerings like truffle mac n&apos; cheese ($9), the Stand Burger ($12) and a Griller Hanger Steak ($22). Some twists on classics are thrown in too&#x2014;Cheeseburger Dumplings or Tuna Tartare Cannolis anyone?&#x2014;but you&apos;re safe bringing your cousins from Toledo who really just wanted to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428142928/http://gothamist.com/2012/09/12/guy_fieris_times_square_restaurant.php">go to Flavor Town</a>. The downstairs bar area serves up snacks, which we know include Truffle Salted Popcorn, but the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428142928/http://www.thestandnyc.com/menu-upstairs/">menu hasn&apos;t gone up on their site yet</a>. </p>

<p>Everything&apos;s funnier when you&apos;ve got a buzz on, so naturally you&apos;ll want to imbibe some laugh lubricant in the form of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428142928/http://www.thestandnyc.com/beers/">$7 beers</a> like Radeberger and Lagunitas IPA. If liquor is more your style, opt for a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428142928/http://www.thestandnyc.com/cocktails/">signature cocktail</a> like The Dice ($13)&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428142928/http://gothamist.com/2012/09/19/photos_first_look_at_woody_allens_l.php#photo-1">named for Woody Allen&apos;s new muse?</a>&#x2014;with local botanical Brooklyn Gin (of course), fresh squeezed grapefruit juice, agave&#xA0;syrup and Aperol. The cocktails may be on the pricier side, but the extra pennies are probably worth it for the pedigree: recipes come from Minetta Tavern bartenders Mark Noonan and Cameron Dale.</p>

<p>While you&apos;re welcome to stop in for dinner without taking in a show, chances are you&apos;ll swing by for the comedy. Tomorrow&apos;s grand opening celebration, hosted by Lynee Koplitz, welcomes Judah Friedlander, Artie Lange, Big Jay Oakerson and others. Christian Finnegan, Kurt Metzger and Nikki Glaser are all coming up, so <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428142928/http://www.thestandnyc.com/shows/">check the schedule</a> to see who&apos;s yucking it up when. Fingers crossed for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428142928/http://gothamist.com/2012/08/28/louis_ck.php">Louis C.K. to show up with his new set</a>. Tickets for all the shows are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428142928/http://www.laughstub.com/The-Stand-NYC">available online through LaughStub</a>. </p>

<p>You don&apos;t have to take just <em>our</em> word for it&#x2014;here are some comedians shilling for the spot:</p>
