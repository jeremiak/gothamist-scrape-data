</div></div>					<p>A humorous new book of food photography pits some very tiny diners against monstrous food items. Photographer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406141005/http://bigappetites.net/artist/">Christopher Boffoli</a> images scenarios of centimeter-high characters pitted against life-sized food items and dishes in his new book <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406141005/http://bigappetites.net/">Big Appetites</a>:</p>

<blockquote>Welcome to a world where little people have big personalities. A world that&#x2019;s upside down and yet weirdly, wonderfully real. A world where Lilliputian thieves poach strawberry seeds. Where it takes a guy with a jackhammer to pop open pistachios. Where skaters fall into a crack in the cr&#xE8;me br&#xFB;l&#xE9;e, and teddy bear cookies congregate with evil intent.</blockquote>

<p>A quippy caption accompanies each of the photographs, which are lovely and whimsical in their own right. &quot;Made me smile,&quot; said Neil Patrick Harris. Us too, Doogie. Us too. </p>

<p>You can pick up a copy of the tiny tabletop tome through <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406141005/http://www.indiebound.org/book/9780761176411?aff=workmanpub">IndieBound</a> or other major book retailers.</p>
