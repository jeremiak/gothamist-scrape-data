<p>Just in case you weren&apos;t already aware of how difficult it is to survive on minimum wage, allow McDonald&apos;s to lay it all out for you. The fast food giant has partnered with Visa to release a just-shy-of-condescending <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508124056/http://www.practicalmoneyskills.com/mcdonalds/budget/budget1.php">&quot;budget journal&quot;</a> to help their employees manage their finances. In a hilariously obtuse budget breakdown, the Big Mac purveyor&apos;s first piece of advice to employees: get a second job. Yup, even McDonald&apos;s knows that workers can&apos;t survive on the pittance they make flipping patties and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508124056/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/14/video_mcdonalds_cashier_beats_custo.php">fighting off customers</a>. </p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="071613mcd_budget.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508124056im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_nellcasey/071613mcd_budget.jpg" width="640" height="795"> <br> <i> <span class="photo_caption">Who needs heat?</span></i></div> <p></p>

<p>Let&apos;s take a look at what else McDonald&apos;s imagines its employees&apos; expenditures should look like. First off, the site sets employees&apos; mortgage/rent at $600, which even if we didn&apos;t live in an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508124056/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/09/report_average_nyc_rent_passes_3000.php">outrageously expensive city</a> is still a laughably small figure. Next, the site tallies health insurance at a mere $20 per month. Where is this magical land of nearly free independent healthcare? We want Obama&apos;s unicorn to fly us there! Also as a McDonald&apos;s employee, your cable and phone bills should only come to $100 a month (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508124056/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/03/time_warner_finds_another_way_to_fl.php">HA!</a>), your electric bill should hover around $90 (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508124056/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/15/hottest_week_of_the_year_1.php">for serious?</a>) and apparently if you work at a fast food chain there&apos;s absolutely no need to ever buy any food ever. Maybe they offer employees a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508124056/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/10/photo_mcdonalds_fries_dont_age.php">lifetime supply of fries</a>?</p>

<p>So tallying up all of these <em>totally realistic</em> expenses, a McDonald&apos;s employee would need to net $2,060 per month to make this budget work. Broken down, that would mean working at least 40 hours per week and making at least $15 an hour pre-taxes to earn the necessary $12.86 an hour. Currently, McDonald&apos;s workers earn an average of $8.25 per hour, barring any <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508124056/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/16/new_york_city_fast_food_workers_exp.php">funny business</a>. </p>
