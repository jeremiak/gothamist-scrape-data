<p>Longtime <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171008112112/http://gothamist.com/tags/oldbowerystation">popup spot</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171008112112/http://openhouse.me/168-bowery/">Old Bowery Station</a> will be transforming into a full-time restaurant in the coming months when it&apos;s converted into the second NYC location of historic dim sum restaurant <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171008112112/http://nomwah.com/">Nom Wah Tea Parlor</a>. A new location for the restaurant will be coming to the 10 Kenmare space sometime soon, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171008112112/http://www.boweryboogie.com/2016/09/nom-wah-tea-parlor-expands-with-new-nolita-location-at-10-kenmare-street/?utm_content=bufferef7c6&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer">according to Bowery Boogie</a>; a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171008112112/https://twitter.com/nomwahnolita">new Twitter account</a> also confirms the move. </p>

<p>The beloved dim sum restaurant has been operating out of the &quot;Bloody Angle&quot; of Doyers Street for 96 years and still looks <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171008112112/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/24/still_got_it_nom_wah_tea_parlor.php">great for her age</a>. Wilson Tang, the Parlor&apos;s current owner, also owns the 168 Bowery event space, which he&apos;s been renting out to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171008112112/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/23/mr_bing_pop-up.php">Chinese crepe</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171008112112/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/07/yumpling_asian_street_food_pop-up.php">Taiwanese dumpling</a> makers in recent years. The new restaurant will be a more casual, counter-service operation the team <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171008112112/http://ny.eater.com/2016/9/19/12969402/nom-wah-nolita">tells Eater</a>.</p>

<p>There&apos;s no official opening date for the new Nom Wah, but when it debuts, it&apos;ll be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171008112112/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/13/the_best_when_your_family_is_in_tow.php">a lot easier for tourists</a> to locate.</p>
