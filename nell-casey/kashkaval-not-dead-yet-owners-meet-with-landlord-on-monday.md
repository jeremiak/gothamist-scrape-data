<p>There&apos;s a glimmer of hope for beloved Hell&apos;s Kitchen wine bar and market Kashkaval, which is expected to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140512053558/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/18/hells_kitchens_kashkaval_may_at_the.php">close at the end of the month</a>. We spoke with owners Corey Samuels and Daniel Assaf this morning and the duo told us that after months of trying they&apos;ve finally secured a meeting with their landlord Joe Restuccia, Executive Director of the Clinton Housing Development Company. </p>

<p>&quot;We&apos;ve been trying  to contact them to enter meetings, we&apos;ve written letters, we&apos;ve actually physically gone over there a few times to try to schedule a meeting, and we&apos;ve just never heard back from them,&quot; Samuels explained. &quot;So we reached out to our council rep, Gale Brewer...and she reached out to Clinton Housing on our behalf, and she was able to schedule a meeting with them for Monday, which she agreed to mediate.&quot;</p>

<p>Samuels and Assaf are hopeful that next week&apos;s meeting will at least shed some light on why the CHDC decided not to renew their lease. &quot;We&apos;ve been good tenants so there&apos;s no real reason for [not renewing] and we don&apos;t really know why but it seems as though this situation with Clinton...it doesn&apos;t make sense to us. There shouldn&apos;t be a reason why he wouldn&apos;t want to renew with us, and that&apos;s kind of where we find ourselves.&quot; They&apos;re also hoping a face-to-face plea would help sway Restuccio. &quot;It&apos;s much easier to put 30 people out of work without giving any reason without actually seeing them in person or putting a face to it.&quot;</p>

<p>While the owners and their PR team are quick to say they&apos;re not interested in running a smear campaign against CHDC, they are frustrated with what they call the &quot;political angle&quot; in their predicament. Kimberly McBryan, who&apos;s been handling the restaurant&apos;s public relations, makes several observations on that point:  </p>

<blockquote>He has several current grants that I know of from New York City, I&apos;m sure there&apos;s some&#x2014;I mean I don&apos;t know for certain but there has been in the past&#x2014;funding from HUD, which is a federal agency. So his reason for being, the whole organization&apos;s reason for being is to be devoted to the community and these are 30 jobs in the community that are going to be gone. And a beloved community space and restaurant owned by two local people, Daniel and Corey live in the community and that&apos;s going to be gone.</blockquote>

<p>The team has been attempting to find a resolution to their plight since February, when CHDC first revealed, without explanation, they won&apos;t be renewing the lease. If this Hail Mary meeting doesn&apos;t turn in the restaurant&apos;s favor, they&apos;ll need to vacate by September 30th. </p>

<p>Despite the tumultuous times, the support from the community has been encouraging. &quot;We started getting a lot of positive comments and outpouring from people all over the place, a lot of local people, international people, everywhere,&quot; Assaf said. &quot;We were recently at the community board floor meeting...and people came up to us and said, &apos;Oh, you&apos;re from Kashkaval, love that place, it&apos;s a great place for the community.&apos; &quot; </p>
