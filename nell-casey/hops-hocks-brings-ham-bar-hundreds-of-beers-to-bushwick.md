                            <p>Bushwick residents craving cured meats and hoppy brews have a new option in the neighborhood to feed their yearnings. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131206010629/http://www.hopsandhocks.com/home.html">Hops &amp; Hocks</a>, a new shop run by the discerning folks behind Stinky Bklyn, JakeWalk and Smith &amp; Vine, specializes in charcuterie and beers from around the globe, in addition to complementary products like cheese, mustard, bread and chocolate. They&apos;ve taken over a 700 square foot storefront on Morgan Avenue at Flushing, not far from Bushwick&apos;s mascot Roberta&apos;s, selling all the delicious treats daily from 11 a.m. to 8 p.m.</p>

<p>On offer are over 200 beers, including everything from standard-sized cans up to large format brews and special &quot;Top Shelf&quot; varieties. Make-your-own 6-packs with brews like Kaiser Pils and Ithaca Flower Power (both in the $2 range) or offerings from Port Jeff Brewing Co. and German&apos;ys Freigeist (in the $5 - $10 range). They&apos;re also doing 20 tap beers and sodas to fill up your growler or 16 or 32 ounce jars. They&apos;ve got Brooklyn Defender&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131206010629/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/04/brooklyn_defender.php">Brooklyn Brewery&apos;s latest Comic Con issue</a>&#x2014;currently on tap, as well as Six Point Atlantic Amber, Westbrook Gose and a smoked ale from Barrier.</p>

<p>The crown jewel of the charcuterie offerings is the &quot;Barcelona-style&quot; ham bar, where slices of delectable meats are shaved directly from the bone. For the opening, they&apos;re offering a Jamon Serrano, an American Iberico Spallacia and a Broadbent aged country ham. They&apos;ve also got local (Salumeria Biellese, Charlito&apos;s) and more far-flung (Fra&apos;Mani, Creminelli) cured meats, available between $20 and $34 per pound. </p>

<p>To make it a real party, pick up some Flory&apos;s Truckle clothbound cheddar or a sheep&apos;s milk cheese from Tomme Brulee and some fresh bread from Sullivan Street Bakery for decadent snacking. They&apos;ll also do &quot;meat cups&quot; and pre-prepared sandwiches for a meal on-the-go. </p>
