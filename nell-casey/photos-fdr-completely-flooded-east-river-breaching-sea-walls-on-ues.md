</div></div>					<p>It&apos;s not just lower Manhattan and low-lying areas of Brooklyn that are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151112024536/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/29/send_us_your_hurricane_sandy_franke.php">seeing rising sea levels</a>; the East River is joining the party and flooding the Upper East Side and East Harlem as well. From our very scientific measurements, it looks as though the East River has risen at least 3 feet since yesterday afternoon. Water has already begun to puddle on the East River Esplanade, with sewer drains also releasing runoff onto nearby streets. </p>

<p>We saw one lone car driving southbound on the FDR during our nervous 15 minute trip to check things out. A large puddle had formed on the road near 111th Street and it looks as though the roadway is completely submerged further south at 82nd Street. No doubt the flooding will increase as Sandy <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151112024536/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/29/cuomo_irene_levels_now_worst_is_sti.php">makes her big push into the area this afternoon</a>. </p>

<p>If you, like us, foolishly decided to brave the elements so you&apos;d have a story to tell your co-workers, be sure to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151112024536/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/29/send_us_your_hurricane_sandy_franke.php">send your photos to us</a> at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151112024536/mailto:photos@gothamist.com">photos(at)gothamist(dot)com</a>, tag them #Gothamist on Twitter and Instagram, &quot;Gothamist&quot; on Flickr or share them on our <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151112024536/http://www.facebook.com/Gothamist?ref=ts&amp;fref=ts">Facebook page</a>. </p>
