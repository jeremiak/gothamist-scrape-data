<p>Congratulations Herald Square, you&apos;re now the proud parent of a bouncing baby Shake Shack, the city&apos;s newest. The burger chain opened their 14th NYC location at Broadway and West 36th Street as of 11 a.m. this morning, about two blocks from the city&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161017153656/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/01/inside_chickfila_nyc.php#photo-1">first Chick-fil-A</a>. We <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161017153656/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/29/chick-fil-as_third_nyc_location_rev.php">like your moves</a>, Shake Shack.</p>

<p>A new Shack is always heralded with a brand new set of concretes, and this time we&apos;re getting the Empire State (chocolate custard, peanut butter sauce, banana, chocolate truffle cookie dough and sugar cone cookie), the Give My Regards&#x2026; (vanilla custard, salted caramel sauce, Mast Brothers Shake Shack dark chocolate chunks, malt and chocolate toffee) and the Hit Parade (vanilla custard, strawberry pur&#xE9;e, Milk &amp; Cookies Bakery cream cheese pound cake, marshmallow sauce and crunchy rainbow sprinkles). Five percent of Hit Parade sales will be donated to Unlocking Futures, which helps mentor today&apos;s youth.</p>
