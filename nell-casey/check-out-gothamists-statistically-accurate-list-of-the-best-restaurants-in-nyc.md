<p>It&apos;s year-end roundup time, where every news outlet, blog and Tumblr will be rolling out their Best of the Best of 2013. These kinds of lists <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430052719/http://gothamist.com/tags/bestofgothamist">are wonderful</a>, of course, but only take into account one person or outlet&apos;s point of view. To create a three dimensional view of the best restaurants in the city, whether old or new, data head <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430052719/https://twitter.com/smelendez">Steven Melendez</a> examined lists and reviews from the city&apos;s most respected sources for all things food.</p>

<p>Melendez compared information from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430052719/http://www.zagat.com/b/new-york-city/nycs-best-restaurants-2014-survey-results-revealed">Zagat</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430052719/http://www.michelintravel.com/michelin-selection/new-york-city-2013/">Michelin</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430052719/http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/r/restaurants/three_star_restaurants_nyc/">The New York Times</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430052719/http://nymag.com/restaurants/wheretoeat/2013/restaurant-guide/">New York Magazine</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430052719/http://www.timeout.com/newyork/restaurants/100-best-new-york-restaurants-american">Time Out NY</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430052719/http://ny.eater.com/archives/2013/10/the_38_essential_new_york_restaurants_october_13.php">Eater</a> and assigned points based on the outlet and the review. And because the Health Department plays <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430052719/http://gothamist.com/tags/restaurantlettergrades">such an important role</a> in the dining scene, a restaurant&apos;s letter grade was then factored into the final score.</p>

<p>Here&apos;s how he broke it down:</p>

<ul>
<li>2 points (Zagat food score / 30) [so a restaurant with a perfect 30 score would get the full two points here]</li>
<li>minus (Health inspection violation points / 14) [so a restaurant that just missed getting an A would lose a point, one that just missed getting a B would lose two, etc.]</li>
<li>1 full point per Michelin star (if any)</li>
<li>1 full point if the restaurant&apos;s on Eater&apos;s top restaurant list</li>
 <li>1 full point if the restaurant&apos;s on Time Out&apos;s list</li>
 <li>1 full point if the restaurant&apos;s on NY Mag&apos;s list</li>
 <li>3 points if the restaurant has 3 NYTimes stars or 4 points if it has 4</li>
</ul>
