<p>Our <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108041709/http://gothamist.com/2015/09/02/prosperity_phil.php">months of mourning</a> for Prosperity Dumpling may be coming to an end, with news that the dollar dumpling-maker will be reopening&#x2014;but not in its former <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108041709/http://gothamist.com/2015/08/28/prosperity_roachling_alley_nbd.php">roach hotel</a>. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108041709/http://www.boweryboogie.com/2016/01/prosperity-dumpling-will-reopen-at-365-broome-street-next-month/">Bowery Boogie has it on good authority</a> that Prosperity has moved its operation to 265 Broome Street in Little Italy, where they plan to make another go of it. Perhaps this space will be equipped with a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108041709/http://gothamist.com/2015/08/26/prosperity_dumpling_uh_oh.php">proper prep kitchen</a>.</p>

<p>A For Rent sign has popped up on the restaurant&apos;s old space on Eldridge Street while work permits have been filed with the DOB for the new Broome Street spot. Bowery Boogie also noticed a sign from the old restaurant has been moved to the new location. Word has it the new location will open at the end of February.</p>

<p>Prosperity&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108041709/http://gothamist.com/2015/08/26/prosperity_dumpling_uh_oh.php">back alley rat kitchen</a> put the cheap eats haven in an unfavorable spotlight last summer, prompting the restaurant <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108041709/http://gothamist.com/2015/08/27/prosperity_dumping_closed_by_health.php">to close</a>. The DOH quickly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108041709/http://gothamist.com/2015/08/28/prosperity_roachling_alley_nbd.php">dispatched inspectors</a> who uncovered a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108041709/http://gothamist.com/2015/08/31/prosperity_dumpling_doh_report_car.php">&quot;severe roach infestation,&quot;</a> which formally put a halt on dumpling production. Hopefully the new location will <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108041709/http://gothamist.com/2015/05/31/still_got_it_prosperity_dumpling.php">live up to the old</a> in popularity&#x2014;vermin not included.</p>
