<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160611181702/http://gothamist.com/2014/06/12/porchetta_guide.php">power of porchetta</a> compels you to head to Williamsburg&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160611181702/http://humboldtandjackson.com/">Humboldt &amp; Jackson</a> tonight and tomorrow, when Sara Jenkins will be popping up to serve her succulent roast pork sandwich on the other side of the East River. The <strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160611181702/http://humboldtandjackson.com/hj-event/porchetta-sandwich-pop-up/">porchetta pop-up</a></strong> begins each night at 5 p.m. and runs until the last of the &quot;fatty belly, crispy skin and lean loin&quot; on crusty bread have been consumed. Braven Brewing Company will also be doing a tap takeover in the space, pouring pints of their beers like the Bushwick Pilsner, which they say should go nicely with all of that pig.</p>

<p>Colorful East Village eatery Miss Lily&apos;s 7A Cafe and its partner Miss Lily&apos;s on Houston Street are once again celebrating the life of iconic reggae legend Bob Marley on what would have been the Jamaican musician&apos;s 71st birthday. On Saturday, the restaurants will serve <strong>vegetarian Rastafarian dishes</strong> including ackee Patty with black truffle and celery ($9), &quot;ITAL&quot; Stew with callaloo, pumpkin, okra, and plantains in a coconut milk sauce ($17) and a Coconut Ice Cream Sundae with banana bread and peanut crunch ($9). At 9 p.m., DJs takeover to spin some of Marley&apos;s songs. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160611181702/http://www.finbackbrewery.com/home.html">Finback Brewery</a> in Queens is hosting a <strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160611181702/https://www.facebook.com/events/1673552119566801/">Craft and Food Market</a></strong> on Saturday from 1 p.m. to 6 p.m. out of their Glendale tasting room. There&apos;ll be all sorts of vendors on hand, including beauty products, handmade knit goods and vintage items, but there&apos;ll also be plenty of food&#x2014;and beer&#x2014;to enjoy as well. Nosh on pretzels from Pretzelmeister, arancini from Leah&#x2019;s Italian Apples and eats from nearby restaurant Room 55, as well as plenty of beers from the brewery itself. </p>
