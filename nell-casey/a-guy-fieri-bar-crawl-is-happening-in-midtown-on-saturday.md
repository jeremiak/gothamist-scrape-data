<p>These past few months (<em>years</em>) have been so focused on America&apos;s Cheetos-haired President-elect that we&apos;d almost forgotten about our other anti-hairstyle icon: Guy Fieri. But Dave Gold hasn&apos;t forgotten and this weekend the Fieri superfan&apos;s organizing a bar crawl in celebration of the <em>Food Network</em> personality and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161120205307/http://gothamist.com/2012/09/12/guy_fieris_times_square_restaurant.php#photo-1">&quot;restaurant&quot; owner</a>. On Saturday, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161120205307/http://www.fiericon.com/">FieriCon&apos;s</a> blowing through Midtown so fellow fans can get Donkey Sauced (I&apos;m so, so sorry). </p>

<p>&quot;It was just me and my friend hanging out one Sunday watching Food Network, eating Chinese food as we normally do, and we were like, &apos;Wow, how fun would it be to dress up like Guy Fieri for one day? Walk around, talk like him, act like him?&apos;&quot; Gold recalls. &quot;And it turned into this idea of having a Guy Fieri bar crawl, where we start at a bar we go to, and end at Guy&apos;s American Kitchen &amp; Bar. We&apos;re in Times Square with all these tourists seeing five or 10 of me and my best friends dressed up like Guy Fieri.&quot;</p>

<p>At noon, the crawl begins at The Hog Pit, a spot Gold and friends have frequented in the past. After an hour, they&apos;ll move on to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161120205307/http://www.fiericon.com/partners/">next stops</a>, spending about another hour at each before the fifth and final stop of the night at Fieri&apos;s eponymous <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161120205307/http://gothamist.com/2012/11/14/have_your_read_the_timess_amazing_a.php">&quot;restaurant?&quot;</a> on West 44th Street. </p>

<p>So are these spots prepared? &quot;They know that we&apos;re coming, they don&apos;t know that we&apos;re coming dressed as Guy Fieri.&quot;</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="111716fieri_rest.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20161120205307im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_nellcasey/111716fieri_rest.jpg" width="640" height="480"> <br> <i> (Tien Mao/Gothamist)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>Gold says he&apos;s gotten thousands of pageviews since launching the website on Tuesday. &quot;It&apos;s crazy,&quot; he says. &quot;It&apos;s somewhat overwhelming, it was supposed to kind of an inside joke. A part of me thinks that only 15 are actually going to show up. Or it&apos;s going to be 75 people. I really don&apos;t know.&quot;</p>

<p>And don&apos;t expect the the Big Guy himself to make an appearance. Despite a joking list of &quot;partners&quot; on his website, Gold says this endeavor is just his and his friend Matt Conway&apos;s. &quot;Food Network has no idea about this. Guy Fieri has no idea about this.&quot;</p>

<p>As a true admirer&#x2014;and Gold&apos;s sincerity is obvious&#x2014;he must have a favorite of Fieri&apos;s television oeuvre. &quot;I gotta go with Triple D [<em>Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives</em>], that&apos;s it for me. Don&apos;t get me wrong, I love Triple G [<em>Guy&apos;s Grocery Games</em>]...but you get to hear the stories on Triple D and see their signature dishes. That&apos;s when Guy gets to make the best jokes and all of his sayings. So definitely Triple D for me.&quot;</p>

<p>And for the record, Gold is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161120205307/http://www.foodnetwork.com/videos/bob-and-lillian-clams-0150456.html">Bob&apos;s Clams</a>, &quot;through and through.&quot; Sorry Lillian.</p>
