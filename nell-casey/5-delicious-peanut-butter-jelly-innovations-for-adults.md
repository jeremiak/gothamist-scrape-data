title: 5 Delicious Peanut Butter & Jelly Innovations For Adults
---

	
										<p><em>Few dishes evoke childhood comfort food better than a peanut butter and jelly sandwich enjoyed out of a brown paper lunch bag. Though we may have moved on to more <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420053903/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/05/pbj_vodka_unleashed_upon_brave_imbi.php">adult versions</a> since our school days, sometimes we just crave the comforting combination of salty, sticky peanut butter with saccharine jelly. To that end, we found some more age-appropriate versions of the simple sandwich to satisfy the little kid inside you while saving face as a person-of-a-certain-age.</em></p>

<p><strong>PB&amp;J; &quot;Pain Perdue&quot; from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420053903/http://www.recettenyc.com/">Recette</a></strong>: For an upscale version of the classic sandwich, head to this West Village restaurant, where chef Jesse Schenker has created a version of French Toast ($12) that channels childhood for an adult palate. The chef soaks two thick slices of Sullivan Street brioche in a custard mixture, then stuffs them with creamy peanut butter and farm-fresh strawberry jam. He griddles the bread until it gets a golden brown crust then serves it with fresh berries and an Earl Grey milk jam, made by soaking Earl Grey tea in a sweetened milk. The gut-busting dish only gets served at brunch, so make sure to stop by on Sundays from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. </p>

The mixture then gets topped with crushed peanuts and sliced red grapes, giving the dish some crunch and heft. Depending on your appetite, opt for the half portion ($4) or full portion ($5.50).</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420053903/http://www.leskesbakery.com/">Peanut Butter and Jelly Doughnut from Leske&apos;s Bakery</a></strong> This Bay Ridge institution has been baking up delicious breads, cookies, pastries and doughnuts since 1961 and this year expanded their operation <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420053903/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/09/legendary_leskes_bakery_to_open_2nd.php">into Park Slope</a>. The joint might be known for their killer Black and Whites, but their doughnut creations are not to be overlooked. The bakery&apos;s Peanut Butter and Jelly doughnut ($1.25) comes fit to burst with sweet globs of black raspberry jelly inside a light, fluffy batter. The doughnut is then topped with a sticky, peanut butter glaze that, despite any efforts to the contrary, will end up all over your face and hands. </p>

<p><strong>Peanut Butter &amp; Jelly Milkshake from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420053903/http://smashburger.com/">Smashburger</a></strong>: Nothing cuts through the heat like a frosty milkshake, and Denver transplant Smashburger has you covered in the nostalgia department as well. The new Peanut Butter &amp; Jelly Shake milkeshake ($4.49), which debuted this month, blends H&#xE4;agen-Dazs vanilla ice cream with strawberry syrup and crushed Nutter Butter Cookies. The result is a pleasing sweet and salty combo full of cookie bits and sweet frosting. Sadly, they were out of strawberry syrup on our visit, but we imagine it would add a touch of brightness and acidity to cut through the thick shake. Best to call in advance to make sure they have all the ingredients.</p>
