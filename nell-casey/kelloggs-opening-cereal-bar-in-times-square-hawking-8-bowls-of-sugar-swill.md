<p>While New Yorkers will be celebrating America&apos;s day of independence with a beach trip or fireworks peeping or exercising our constitutional right to binge Netflix for 13 hours straight, tourists in Times Square will be stuffing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016144847/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/08/kids_cereal_is_basically_dessert_sa.php">spoonfuls of chemically-enhanced sugar</a> into their mouths at Kellogg&apos;s new cereal cafe. </p>

<p>The new all-day cereal bar and cafe, creatively titled Kellogg&apos;s NYC, opens this coming weekend at 1600 Broadway&#x2014;CNN Money <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016144847/http://money.cnn.com/2016/06/28/smallbusiness/kelloggs-nyc-cereal-cafe/index.html?iid=hp-stack-dom">says July 1st</a>, the Daily News <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016144847/http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/eats/kellogg-open-all-day-cereal-cafe-times-square-article-1.2691026">claims July 4th</a>&#x2014;with enhanced bowls of sugared grains priced between $6 and $8. Half the price of one of those <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016144847/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/27/black_tap_milkshake_insanity.php">ridiculous milkshakes</a>&#x2014;a bargain!</p>

<p>The brand partnered with Momofuku Milk Bar&apos;s Christina Tosi, who&apos;s been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016144847/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/29/milk_bar_chelsea.php">toying with cereal</a> since the dessert shop&apos;s inception. She had a hand in creations like the &quot;Life In Color&quot; made with Fruit Loops, lime zest, marshmallows, passion fruit jam and an insulin shot, or another with Special K and Frosted Flakes topped with pistachios, lemon zest and thyme. They&apos;ll also have Blue Marble ice cream you can substitute for milk, if you so desire, according to CNN. </p>

<p>To further sweeten the bowl, every order also comes with a prize, like Uber gift cards (for transportation to the nearest hospital) and on Monday, the potential to win a pair of tickets to <em>Hamilton</em>. All that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016144847/http://gothamist.com/2015/08/24/kith_cereal_bar_sneaker_store.php">other cereal bar</a> would get you was a bill for a $990 jacket.</p>
