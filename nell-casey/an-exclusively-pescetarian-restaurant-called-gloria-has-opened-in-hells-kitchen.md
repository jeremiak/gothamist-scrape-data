					<p>&quot;So far, meat has never come through my front door,&quot; Phil Johnson explains of his fish friendly new restaurant <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170325024210/https://www.gloria-nyc.com/">Gloria</a> that opened recently in Hell&apos;s Kitchen. Chef and business partner Diego Garcia created a menu centered entirely around seafood after stints at Le Berardin and Contra awakened the duo to the common dietary practice of pescetarianism. &quot;There are a lot of fish restaurants that do use a lot of meat like pork butt and chicken stock in their sauces...we really looked around and there isn&apos;t a fish restaurant that&apos;s 100% fish.&quot;</p>

<p>The restaurant sources all of its seafood from Northeast and Atlantic purveyors, working closely with companies like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170325024210/http://www.greenpointfish.com/">Greenpoint Fish &amp; Lobster Co.</a> to provide sustainable fish including skate, scallop and bass to diners. &quot;Sometimes guests have an iPhone in their pocket and they&apos;re looking at the Monteray Bay Aquarium <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170325024210/http://www.seafoodwatch.org/">recommendation</a> and we can happily tell them, &apos;Yeah, everything we&apos;re buying is sustainable,&apos;&quot; according to Johnson.</p>

<p>Garcia&apos;s Mexican heritage influenced some of the dishes and the chef&apos;s dedication to seafood goes all the way back to childhood when he would catch octopuses and clams when he was a young boy. &quot;It&apos;s not overtly Mexican,&quot; Johnson explains. &quot;But once in a while there&apos;ll be some sauces that send him back to childhood.&quot; </p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="032317gloria_seats.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170325024210im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_nellcasey/032317gloria_seats.jpg" width="640" height="427"> <br> <i> (Scott Heins/Gothamist)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>Johnson&apos;s in charge of the wine program, which currently offers 65 wines predominantly from France&#x2014;with a smattering of American producers&#x2014;with a bent towards natural wines, which are made with wild yeasts and little to no sulfur. &quot;If you&apos;ve only had Tropicana orange juice and then you have fresh squeezed orange juice you&apos;re like, &apos;Oh my god, this is orange juice!&apos; That&apos;s how I feel about natural wine.&quot;</p>

<p>The partners looked at over 100 different spaces before finding their prize on West 53rd Street (enormous windows helped seal the deal). Blue leather-like material was hand-selected at a fabric store on the Lower East Side to cover the booths and banquettes, which Johnson describes as &quot;cosy corners.&quot; He&apos;s also quite taken by a design feature that offers dinner with a view.</p>

<p>&quot;There&apos;s these two awesome seats that sit side-by-side and look out the window. I love that, I think that&apos;s a super date night little corner.&quot;</p>
