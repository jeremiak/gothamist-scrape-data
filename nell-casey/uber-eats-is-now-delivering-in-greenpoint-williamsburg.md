<p>Does Brooklyn&#x2014;or any borough&#x2014;need <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161017163942/http://gothamist.com/2014/12/04/caviar_brooklyn.php"><em>another</em> method</a> by which to get food delivered directly in front of our laptops? Probably not, but they&apos;ve got it thanks to Uber, which officially launched their restaurant delivery service <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161017163942/https://ubereats.com/nyc/">UberEATS</a> in the borough today, joining companies like Seamless and Caviar in competition for a few neighborhoods&apos; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161017163942/http://gothamist.com/2014/07/17/brooklyn_fried.php">gluttonous appetites</a>.</p>

<p>Unsurprisingly, the entire borough won&apos;t have access to the service just yet; the company has focused on Greenpoint and Williamsburg for its initial run. Those familiar to the area&apos;s delivery options will see familiar faces&#x2014;Delaney Barbecue, Chinese Club, Delilah&apos;s Steaks, No 7 Sub, Rosamunde&#x2014;but there are some restaurants partnering exclusively (for now) with Uber. Among them: Cassette, JUS by Julie, MID | NIGHTS, Rider, Sweethaus, Moe&apos;s Doughs Donut Shop and vegan delights Dun-Well Doughnuts.</p>

<p>The shtick at UberEATS is a flat $2.99 per restaurant&#x2014;similar services that deliver from previously dine-in only spots can vary from $2.99 to $5.99 and beyond&#x2014;and the company says there&apos;s no need to tip drivers (though <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161017163942/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/03/tip_uber_etiquette.php">maybe you should</a>?). Prices from restaurants appear to be the same through Uber as they would be ordering directly from the restaurant&#x2014;so long as you don&apos;t <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161017163942/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/28/uber_time_money_fees.php">keep your driver waiting</a> while you scramble to put on pants to answer the door.</p>
