										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="021916coffee.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028102801im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_nellcasey/021916coffee.jpg" width="640" height="425"> <br> <i> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028102801/http://www.shutterstock.com/gallery-762385p1.html">Dima Sobko</a>/<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028102801/http://www.shutterstock.com/index-in.mhtml">Shutterstock</a>)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>First, climate change <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028102801/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/18/climate_change_rip_lobsters.php">came for our lobsters</a>. Then, it started <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028102801/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/27/un_we_wont_have_any_food_once_the_b.php">threatening the crops</a>. But it can pry coffee from our cold, dead hands. Which is fitting because most of us <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028102801/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/23/rising_heat_deaths_nyc.php">will be dead from climate change</a> in the very near future.</p>

<p>A new <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028102801/http://fairtrade.com.au/~/media/fairtrade%20australasia/files/resources%20for%20pages%20-%20reports%20standards%20and%20policies/tci_a_brewing_storm_final_24082016_web.pdf">report</a> by The Climate Institute has combined several studies that link climate change with the depletion of the world&apos;s coffee supply. The troubling report points to disappearing farm lands and the rise of diseases and insects that compromise the coffee plants. Just let the sea waters <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028102801/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/31/sorry_kids_but_change_is_hard_work.php">sweep us away</a>.</p>

<p>Caffeine-deprived zombies aren&apos;t the only downside, of course. The report notes that over 125 million people rely on the coffee industry to survive and coffee is a huge player in certain economies where the beans are a major export. </p>

<p>&quot;It&apos;s a severe threat,&quot; Peet&apos;s Coffee vice president Doug Welsh, who&apos;s also a board member of the World Coffee Research, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028102801/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/23/science/climate-change-threatens-worlds-coffee-supply-report-says.html?_r=0">affirmed to the Times</a>. &quot;It&apos;s anecdotal, but I don&apos;t know any coffee farmers who don&apos;t believe that their weather, and with it their disease and productivity issues, have changed dramatically over the last decade.&quot;</p>

<p>So there you go, we&apos;re all pretty much screwed. Drink <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028102801/http://gothamist.com/2015/11/17/coffee_drinkers_longevity.php">while you can</a> and use that last jolt of energy to pressure world leaders to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028102801/http://gothamist.com/2016/09/21/paris_climate_change_agreement.php">do something now</a>. </p>
