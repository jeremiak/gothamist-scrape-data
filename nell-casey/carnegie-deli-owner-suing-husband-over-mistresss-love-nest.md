<p>The owner of famed Midtown eatery <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427160525/http://gothamist.com/tags/carnegiedeli">Carnegie Delicatessen</a> has some serious beef with her philandering husband. Marian Levine, daughter of original owner <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427160525/http://gothamist.com/2009/02/04/milton_parker_pastrami_king_of_the.php">Milton Parker</a>, is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427160525/http://nypost.com/2013/10/17/carnegie-deli-owner-sleeping-with-tenant-suit/">suing her husband and his mistress</a> for allegedly cheating her out of thousands of dollars in rent money for an apartment in the building that houses the iconic deli, according to the Post. </p>

<p>Levine&apos;s 71-year-old husband Sandy, who&apos;d been reportedly having an affair with a 66-year-old woman named Penkae Siricharoen since 1998, apparently set his mistress up in a love nest apartment in the building that&apos;s owned by his wife. The affair went unnoticed by Marian until 2011, when she claims her husband signed an agreement with Sirichroen that would give her a sweetheart deal on rent for the next 15 years. The rent control agreement would keep the price at $975 per month on a unit that would rent for $3,000 a month on the open market, says the tabloid. </p>

<p>The lawsuit seeks to evict Siricharoen&#x2014;who also has a home in Queens&#x2014;and force her to pay back rent on the apartment. The suit also alleges that Siricharoen used a &quot;false identity&quot; to rent the apartment and is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427160525/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/deli-owner-alleges-husband-gave-mistress-sweet-deal-apartment-article-1.1489227">in the country illegally</a>, according to the Daily News. &#x201C;This isn&#x2019;t about money,&#x201D; a deli employee told the Post. &#x201C;This is a personal issue between her and her husband. She doesn&#x2019;t need the money.&#x201D; Apparently revenge tastes much better than an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427160525/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/24/carnegie_deli_giving_tim_tebow_his.php">$22.22 meat bomb</a>.</p>
