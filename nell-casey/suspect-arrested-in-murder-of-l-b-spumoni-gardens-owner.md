<p>A suspect has been arrested in the murder of Louis Barbati, the co-owner of L&amp;B; Spumoni Gardens who was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161106152045/http://gothamist.com/2016/07/01/lb_spumoni_gardens_killed.php#photo-1">gunned down</a> in August. Federal authorities have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161106152045/http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2016/11/3/l-b-spumoni-gardens-murder-latest.html">arrested Andres &quot;Andy&quot; Fernandez</a> in connection with the murder, which took place outside of Barbati&apos;s home in Dyker Heights. Fernandez is expected to be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161106152045/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/suspect-b-spumoni-gardens-owner-murder-arrested-article-1.2856990?utm_content=buffera5a54&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=NYDailyNewsTw">arraigned in Brooklyn Federal Court</a> at some point today.</p>

<p>On the evening of August 31st, Barbati was returning home from his restaurant when he was shot five times by a hooded gunman while walking from his car to his house on 12th Avenue and 76th Street. The following day, police indicated the shooting may have been a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161106152045/http://gothamist.com/2016/07/02/spumoni_gardens_2.php">botched robbery</a>, as Barbati was carrying a reported $15,000 in cash, though no money was taken from the scene. </p>

<p>&quot;Mr. Barbati does not normally carry that amount of money,&quot; NYPD Chief of Detectives Robert Boyce said at the time. &quot;That, along with the perp waiting for him to pull up and approach him there.&quot;</p>

<p>Police have been searching for a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161106152045/http://gothamist.com/2016/07/05/lb_spumoni_murder_poi.php">person of interest</a> caught on surveillance video around the time of the shooting. An FBI agent has testified that Fernandez was seen on video <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161106152045/http://www.brooklyndaily.com/stories/2016/46/all-louis-barbati-spumoni-gardens-murder-arrest-2015-11-11-bk.html">hiding behind a tree</a> across from Barbati&apos;s home; the suspect allegedly donned a glove and was seen with a handgun.</p>

<p>Court documents also indicate that Fernandez&apos;s cellphone was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161106152045/http://www.newsday.com/long-island/feds-arrest-in-brooklyn-restaurant-owner-s-killing-1.12556504">near the pizzeria</a> earlier in the day and again later that evening at the scene of the crime.</p>

<p>Investigators have also been looking at a rivalry between L&amp;B; Spumoni Gardens and a competing Staten Island pizzeria opened by Eugene Lombardo, a former employee of L&amp;B;, who was accused of copying L&amp;B;&apos;s tomato sauce recipe. In 2009, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161106152045/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/12/you_want_some_mob_war_with_your_lb.php">charges were brought against Francis Guerra</a>, an alleged Colombo crime family mobster who was related to an L&amp;B; owner through marriage, after Guerra allegedly threatened Lombardo. Those charges were dropped in 2012.</p>
