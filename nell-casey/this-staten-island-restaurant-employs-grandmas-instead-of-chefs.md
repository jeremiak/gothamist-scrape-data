<p>&quot;Just like grandma used to make&quot; is much more than a clever advertising scheme, it&apos;s literally what&apos;s happening at Staten Island&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170723095035/http://www.enotecamaria.com/wp/">Enoteca Maria</a>, where the kitchen&apos;s staffed not by professionally trained chefs, but by a fleet of &quot;nonnas&quot; from around the world. For about a decade, owner Jody Scaravella has opened his kitchens to grandmothers cooking the cuisines of their native countries. It started with just Italian grandmothers, after his own heritage, but has since expanded to include dozens of women from places like Argentina, Algeria, Syria, the Dominican Republic, Poland, Liberia, and Nigeria.</p>
