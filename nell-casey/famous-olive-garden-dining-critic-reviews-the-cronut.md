<p>Two luminaries of the internet food media machine met on national television this morning. Marilyn Hagerty&#x2014;whose <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160301201630/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/09/sanity_restored_grand_forks_food_cr.php">charming review</a> of a local Olive Garden skyrocketed her into the national spotlight&#x2014;went on the <em>Today</em> show, where she recalled her rise to internet fame, chatted up her <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160301201630/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/06/marilyn_hagerty_the_book_coming_soo.php">new book</a> and ate a Cronut. </p>

<p>Matt Lauer and Savannah Guthrie looked on eagerly as Hagerty took her first bite, likely wishing their TV personality diets included fried carbs and cream. &quot;A Cronut,&quot; Hagerty said thoughtfully, having never heard of this <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160301201630/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/02/faces_of_madness_cronut_fans_form_l.php">crazy people pastry</a>. &quot;Well, it&apos;s very chewy. It&apos;s very good. I think that I would like it with a cup of coffee, maybe in the afternoon. In the afternoon you can eat more.&quot; That&apos;s what we&apos;d all like, Marilyn. Just a quiet afternoon with coffee, a Cronut and maybe the <em>Times</em> Wednesday crossword puzzle. </p>

<p>Hagerty thinks the Cronut could &quot;make it&quot; in her native North Dakota but points to the state&apos;s high standards of selectivity as a possible exclusion of the pastry. We&apos;re not sure we appreciate your tone, Marilyn. Are you implying that perhaps New Yorkers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160301201630/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/13/spotted_two_young_women_digging_for.php">aren&apos;t discerning about their food</a>? Or that our <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160301201630/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/17/ramen_burger_watch_2013.php">dedication and tenacity</a> somehow weaken us as a city? </p>
