title: The 10 Best Mac & Cheeses In NYC
---

	
										<p><em>We could all use a little more cheese and pasta in our lives. Here&apos;s where to do it right.</em></p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="010617dumont.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170415171848im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_nellcasey/010617dumont.jpg" width="640" height="427"> <br> <i> (DuMont Burger)</i></div> <p></p>

<p><strong>DUMONT BURGER</strong> This is the kind of mac and cheese I wish I didn&apos;t know about, in the sense that, now that I know it&apos;s in the world, I want it all the time. It&apos;s probably my favorite macaroni and cheese in NYC&#x2014;and I&apos;ve eaten <em>a lot</em> of macaroni and cheese. </p>

<p>The DuMac &amp; Cheese (small $12, large $14) employs nutty Gruyere cheese with a mild cheddar to improve the cheese sauce&apos;s stretch factor, with some Parmesan cheese for that salty aged funk. Chunks of thick-cut bacon add more salinity and some texture in the mix of soft pasta and creamy cheese. Instead of a traditional elbow shape, they use radiatore pasta, whose spirals hold the cheese sauce like a warm embrace.</p>

<p><em>DuMont Burger is located at 314 Bedford Avenue, Williamsburg, (718) 384-6127; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170415171848/http://www.dumontburgerbrooklyn.com/">dumontburgerbrooklyn.com</a></em></p>

<p><strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170415171848/http://www.beechershandmadecheese.com/Locations/NewYork.aspx">BEECHER&apos;S</a></strong> If making cheese is your gig, then you better know how to use it, especially if you&apos;re going to dub your mac &amp; cheese the &quot;World&apos;s Best.&quot; Having not eaten every mac &amp; cheese on this planet, we can&apos;t back up this Flatiron cheese shop&apos;s claim, but it&apos;s pretty darn good. Penne noodles are encased in a molten mixture of the shop&apos;s homemade Flagship (a cheddar and gruyere hybrid) and Jack cheeses, bound together with cream and finished in the oven. </p>

<p>At their downstairs eatery The Cellar, macs can be further enhanced with things like pork belly and pickled fennel stem ($15), crab, Old Bay aioli and bread crumbs ($16) or balsamic mushrooms and fennel ($16). But their simply prepared original is worth a try on its own, as it lets the flavors of the cheese really shine through. Grab a crock downstairs for $12, or a cup to go at the cheese counter; an eight ounce serving runs $6.50, a 16-ounce serving runs $10.50. They also offer their original mac frozen for when the Night Cheese cravings strike. </p>

<p><em>Beecher&apos;s Handmade Cheese is located at 900 Broadway at 20th Street in the Flatiron (212-466-3340, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170415171848/http://www.beechershandmadecheese.com/Locations/NewYork.aspx">beechershandmadecheese.com</a>)</em></p>

<p><strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170415171848/http://jacknellies.com/">JACK &amp; NELLIE&apos;S</a></strong> The mac&apos;s cheekily billed as a &quot;small plate&quot; at this lovely Forest Hills spot, but do not be fooled: this mac and cheese could absolutely stand in as a meal unto itself. That has a lot to do with the addition of chorizo, an underused pork component in a world that clings to bacon to tightly. A call for more chorizo in macaroni and cheese, please. Points also for the undervalued ditalini shape, sort of a stubbier elbow noodle that&apos;s mostly reserved for minestrone soup. </p>

<p><em>Jack &amp; Nellie&apos;s is located at 108-25 Ascan Avenue between Austin and Burns Streets in Forest Hills (718-268-2696, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170415171848/http://jacknellies.com/">jacknellies.com</a>)</em></p>

<p><strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170415171848/http://www.earlsny.com/">EARL&apos;S BEER AND CHEESE</a></strong> Sure, there&apos;s almost always a wait, and even if you do find a spot at this minuscule East Harlem joint, you&apos;ll likely have a neighbor&apos;s elbow in your face. But all of that fades away a single bite into their luscious Mac &amp; Cheese ($8), which comes scratch made to order (no steam table scoops here) in a darling ramekin. Instead of the common cheddar or Alpine-style cheese, they&apos;re using goat cheese, which imparts a touch of tang and a super creamy sauce to coat the large rigatoni noodles. They&apos;re also tossing in a pinch of finely chopped rosemary, adding a woodsy zip that really wakes up the cheese and heavy cream. </p>

<p><em>Earl&apos;s Beer and Cheese is located at 1259 Park Avenue between 97th and 98th Streets in East Harlem (212-289-1581, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170415171848/http://www.earlsny.com/">earlsny.com</a>)</em></p>

<p><strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170415171848/http://www.catfishnyc.com/">CATFISH</a></strong> Make your way to the side dishes section of the menu at this Crown Heights Southern restaurant. You&apos;ll be tempted to stop at the Duck Gumbo and Chicken Fried Steak, but soldier on for a highbrow/lowbrow version of Baked Mac &apos;N Cheese ($6) that tops a fancy bechamel-based Gruyere and white cheddar cheese sauce with crumbled Zapp&apos;s &quot;Cajun Crawtator&quot; potato chips. More places should top their mac with chips; it&apos;s a winning combination.</p>

<p>Double down on the crawfish by adding some of the mudbugs to your mac for $4. </p>

<p><strong>WESTVILLE</strong> It&apos;s a blessing to have multiple locations of the fancy diner-ish spot in NYC&#x2014;that there&apos;s one so closer to our Dumbo HQ is both a blessing and a curse. I like this version for its intense creaminess and the unique flavor the gouda lends to the cheese sauce. There&apos;s a cheddar in there, too, for a nice creamy bite. Best of all: the char. The baking process means a nicely browned top to the mac, a boon for people who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170415171848/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/24/dining/burned-food-charred-browned-blackened.html">dig on &quot;burnt&quot; food</a>. You can add bacon for $2 if that&apos;s your thing, but it doesn&apos;t need it.</p>

<p><em>Westville has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170415171848/http://westvillenyc.com/ordering-delivery/">multiple locations</a> in Manhattan and one in Brooklyn.</em></p>

<br><br>
&quot;American cheese was a way for American cheesemongers to use up all the cheese scraps without it going to waste,&quot; owner Ham El-Waylly explains. &quot;So they take all these cheeses that they have leftover and before they went bad they would melt them all together with sodium citrate and then American cheese was born.&quot;
<br><br>
For his version, he takes his favorite cheese&#x2014;the formidable &#xC9;poisses&#x2014;and combines it with a nutty Gruyere and a sharp yellow cheddar. The &#xC9;poisses makes for a <em>super</em> creamy sauce, with some stretch from the other two cheeses. On top: a heady garlic and breadcrumbs mixture. &quot;There&apos;s a lot of it, about 25% garlic in the breadcrumbs,&quot; El-Waylly says. &quot;It&apos;s garlic disguised as breadcrumbs.&quot;

<p><strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170415171848/http://queenscomfort.com/">QUEENS COMFORT</a></strong> Good luck getting a table for brunch at this Astoria den of carbs and cheese, but things are usually a little quieter for dinnertime, where they offer two flavors of equally decadent mac &amp; cheese. Carnivores can opt for the Bacon Scallion version ($14), a rich mixture of bechamel fortified with cheddar, fontina and parmesan cheeses, with nubs of salty bacon and zippy green onions in each bite. </p>

<p>For vegetarians, Truffle Mushroom ($16) with fontina, cheddar and a funky flavor that will bar post-meal makeouts for at least a few hours. If you do get in during weekend daylight hours, do not miss the deep fried mac &amp; cheese known as Atomic Fire Balls ($8). For extra lily gilding, they&apos;re served with a side of ranch for dipping.</p>

Love, because I love mac and cheese and always order it; hate, because it&apos;s usually disappointing. Both Delaney Barbecue and Hometown Bar-B-Cue give New Yorkers BBQ mac they can feel proud of.</p>

<p>At Delaney Barbecue, they use cheese from Beechers instead of the traditional Gruyere to make a mornay cream sauce. A bit of jalapeno adds spice and a breadcrumb toppings help add some texture to the mess of mac ($10). At Hometown, they get points for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170415171848/https://www.instagram.com/p/BO8NsL4BuZt/?taken-by=nellcasey">topping their mac</a> ($4, $6 or $8) with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170415171848/http://gothamist.com/2015/05/20/nycs_best_queso.php">queso</a>, the molten cheese mixture sent down from the gods.
