<p>There are some real creeps on all those dating apps, amirite? Well, now there are some legit <em>creepy crawlies</em>, too, because the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170126173310/http://bronxzoo.com/">Bronx Zoo&apos;s</a> Madagascar hissing cockroaches are single and ready to <strike>mingle</strike> crawl across your face in the middle of the night searching for love.</p>

<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170126173310if_/https://www.youtube.com/embed/YQz1RQq6edw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>It&apos;s time for the zoo&apos;s annual <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170126173310/http://bronxzoo.com/roach">&quot;Name-a-Roach&quot;</a> tradition, where the lovelorn and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170126173310/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/26/cockroach_valentines_day.php">vindictive</a> can name a giant insect in honor of whomever they choose. &quot;For a $10 donation, your loved one, or unloved one, will receive the certificate to cherish for years to come, featuring the name chosen for your Valentine&apos;s roach,&quot; the Zoo promises.</p>

<p>This year the Zoo is also giving away plush cockroach toys and boxes of fancy chocolate for people who donate $35 (or $50 if you want both). Seems less skeevy than <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170126173310/http://www.giantmicrobes.com/us/products/crablouse.html">plush genital lice</a>, but you live your own life. </p>

<p>The Zoo would also like to remind you that, unlike the roaches that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170126173310/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/01/nyc_infestations_ranking.php">make homes inside your tennis sneakers</a>, Madagascar hissing cockroaches are &quot;not considered pests and rarely enter homes.&quot; They&apos;re the world&apos;s largest roach species (<em>four inches</em>, baby) and can be found in the Zoo&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170126173310/https://bronxzoo.com/exhibits/madagascar">&quot;Madagascar!&quot;</a> exhibit, which also features lots of lemurs, crocodiles and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170126173310/https://www.wired.com/2015/01/creature-feature-10-fun-facts-fossa/">these cute cat-like creatures</a> called fossa, who genus name means &quot;hidden anus.&quot; </p>

<p>Happy Valentine&apos;s Day! </p>
