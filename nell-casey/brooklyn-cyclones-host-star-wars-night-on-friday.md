<p><strike>A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away....</strike> This Friday at Coney Island&apos;s MCU Park...it&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130825014725/http://www.brooklyncyclones.com/news/index.html?article_id=1547">Star Wars Night</a> at the Cyclones game! Brooklyn&apos;s minor league team invites Jedi, ewoks, bounty hunters and droids of all kinds for a special night of baseball, special guests and some sick light saber action.</p>

<p>Sith Lord himself Darth Vader throws out the first pitch <em>using the Force</em> (probably not but just play along) and Jedi Master Yoda wanders the field in between innings. The Empire Saber Guild performs some exciting light saber battles and Star Wars characters greet fans at the gate. Plus, any guests who show up in costume get to do an &quot;Imperial March&quot; around the warning track before the game. Dream. Come. True. </p>

<p>If you happened to be named Luke or Leia&#x2014;ahhh &apos;70s kids&#x2014;make sure to claim your &quot;special prize.&quot; The rest of us saps named Han and Jabba must settle for $1 hot dogs at the game. And anyone who just can&apos;t bear for the night to end are in luck: the team hosts a family sleepover on the field, where they&apos;ll be screening clips from the films. Plus these guys:</p>
