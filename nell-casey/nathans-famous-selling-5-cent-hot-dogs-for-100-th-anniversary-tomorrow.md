<p>Tomorrow, Nathan&apos;s Famous celebrates <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161006144706/http://gothamist.com/2016/05/02/historic_nathans_hot_dogs.php">100 years of hot dogs</a> at their flagship Coney Island stand. In celebration, they&apos;re seriously rolling back the prices, selling their signature hot dogs for just five cents.</p>

<p>The price is important to Nathan&apos;s, as it&apos;s the price folks in 1916 paid to eat one of Nathan Handwerker&apos;s tubed meats. Handerker famously left his employment at Feltman&apos;s&#x2014;Coney Island&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161006144706/http://gothamist.com/2010/01/19/last_remnant_of_feltmans_coney_isla.php#photo-1">original hot dog operation</a>&#x2014;to open his own shop down the street, undercutting Feltman&apos;s 10 cent hot dog with his five cent hot dog. </p>

<p>Nathan&apos;s is expecting &quot;record crowds&quot; at tomorrow&apos;s celebration, which runs from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. only at their Surf Avenue HQ.
