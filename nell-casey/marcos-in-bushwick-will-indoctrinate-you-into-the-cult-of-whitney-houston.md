					<p>&quot;Christmas lights and jukeboxes are my favorite things when you walk into a bar,&quot; exclaims Bryan Quackenbush while describing his new bar, Marco&apos;s, that he just opened in Bushwick. &quot;It&apos;s what I think of when I think of a good bar.&quot; His lighting preference is immediately evident once you step inside. Twinkling strands of lights encircle the bar, which Quackenbush and his business partner Greg Goldman salvaged from a defunct restaurant near Syracuse. </p>

<p>&quot;We don&apos;t know the name of the restaurant it came from, [but] it was built by this old Italian guy named Marco in the late &apos;50s, it was in his restaurant,&quot; Quackenbush explains. &quot;We used a picture to reassemble it and try to leave it exactly as it was, which kind of sucks a little bit for your service because it wasn&apos;t as intuitive in 1957.&quot;</p>

<p>Quackenbush also runs <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170415160335/http://gothamist.com/2014/04/18/bushwick_old_stanleys.php#photo-1">Bushwick&apos;s Old Stanley bar</a>, which offers a similar &quot;old man dive bar&quot; aesthetic that would fit as comfortably in Minneapolis as it does in Brooklyn. An ancient Broadway gaming machine may be poised to court vice but &quot;it doesn&apos;t pay out,&quot; Quackenbush assures, and pinball machines&#x2014;not the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170415160335/https://twitter.com/ZaaackKoootzer/status/605770426841587713/photo/1">innocent games</a> they may outwardly project, except for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170415160335/https://twitter.com/ZaaackKoootzer/status/605770426841587713/photo/1">this one</a> which...&#x2014;come in James Bond and Playboy editions, themselves not free from sin. But who wants virtue at a bar?</p>

<p>Wickedness comes cheap at Marco&apos;s, where a beer and shot&apos;ll run you $6 and all the house and classic cocktails just $8. Inspired by the champagne well holding court behind the bar, there&apos;s a &quot;Marco&apos;s Champagne Cocktail&quot; made with cognac, a sugar cube and a prosecco floater. Happy hour&#x2014;which runs to an egalitarian 9 p.m. every day of the week&#x2014;brings even cheaper prices, with $2 off drafts, wells and wines, but they&apos;ll also sell you a Bud or Bud Light for $3 whenever you drop in.</p>

<p>&quot;Right now it&apos;s got some tables and chairs and some ashtrays,&quot; Quackenbush says of the space&apos;s &quot;massive&quot; back yard, but plans for the future may include a mobile food truck of some kind. </p>

<p>There&apos;s also a jukebox stacked with new wave, hip hop, punk rock and &quot;nostalgic pop music,&quot; which includes not one but <em>two</em> Whitney Houston records. </p>
