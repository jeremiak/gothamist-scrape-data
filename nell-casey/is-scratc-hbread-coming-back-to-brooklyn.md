<p>SCRATCHbread and their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025135630/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/05/brooklyns_scratchbread_makes_nycs_b.php#photo-1">amazing egg sandwiches</a> went to the great skillet in the sky last year, but is the Bed-Stuy restaurant poised for resurrection? Owner Matthew Tilden <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025135630/https://www.gofundme.com/EATmoreDELICIOUS">launched a crowdfunding campaign</a> a few months back to bring his vision for a cookbook to life. Now, he&apos;s saying if the campaign&apos;s successful, he&apos;ll be bringing SCRATCHbread back to Brooklyn where it belongs.</p>

<p>&quot;I had a meeting over the weekend with someone who can help make that happen,&quot; Tilden said through an email to his newsletter subscribers. &quot;The deal is, if we can finish this campaign and I can get back to Brooklyn before the end of summer in fighting shape, we&apos;re going to move forward in bringing SCRATCHbread back.&quot;</p>

<p>Tilden shuttered the eatery in October of last year, citing financial woes and exhaustion. &quot;It&apos;s bullshit I have to destroy the most important thing in my life,&quot; he said at the time, while simultaneously promising he&apos;d &quot;still be there with fucking bells on&quot; once things calmed down. Since then, he&apos;s been on a kind of spirit quest, &quot;driving across the country, soaking up food culture, learning what people are eating and why.&quot; </p>

<p>We&apos;ve reached out to Tilden for more information about a possible return for SCRATCHbread, including whether it&apos;ll re-occupy its former home on Bedford Avenue in Bed-Stuy. We&apos;ll update as soon as we know more.</p>
