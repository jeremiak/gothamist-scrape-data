</div></div>					<p>Governors Island was transformed into a public art playground this past weekend at the annual <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508121523/http://figmentproject.org/">FIGMENT Fest</a>, where artists from every discipline descended on the park for two days of collaboration and exploration. Installations, activities and roving art pieces were scattered throughout the grounds to admire and interact with, like a homemade Mini Golf Arcade, and pieces of giant, foam packing materials to relax on.</p>

<p>While the festival is temporary in nature, several sculptures will remain on view for the duration of the summer, including <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508121523/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/11/see_the_statue_of_libertys_decapita.php">the State of Liberty face</a> and the multi-colored tree house. If you couldn&apos;t make it to the Island to enjoy the artwork, you can live vicariously through our photo gallery! </p>

<p>And <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508121523/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/12/governors_island_reveals_2012_lineu.php">here&apos;s what else is happening over there this summer</a>.</p>
