<p>David Chang&apos;s delivery-only restaurant <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171011053158/https://andofood.com/">Momofuku Ando</a>&#x2014;not to be confused with the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171011053158/http://gothamist.com/2015/04/28/maple_delivery_david_chang.php">David Chang-backed delivery-only restaurant Maple</a>&#x2014;is officially live in Midtown East. Users who signed up for advanced notice were directed to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171011053158/https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ando-momofukus-delivery-only/id1104421020?mt=8">download the app</a> (of course) this morning to get Chang&apos;s latest creations delivered to their desks and couches. Fried chicken at the touch of a button? Dangerous.</p>

<p>There&apos;s a NYC Cheesesteak ($12) with cheese sauce, onions, cherry peppers and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171011053158/http://products.momofuku.com/hozon/">Chickpea Hozon</a>, the Chang invention he&apos;s using to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171011053158/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/08/david_chang_momofuku_nishi.php">make the pasta sauce</a> at his other new eatery Nishi. The other two entrees are an enormous Fried Chicken Box ($11) with honey mustard and coleslaw and The Ernesto ($10), a roasted pork sandwich with curried mustard, sauerkraut and muenster cheese. </p>

<p>There&apos;s only one side for now, a Baked Potato ($4) that reads like an entree&#x2014;and maybe it is. It&apos;s loaded with a black pepper sour cream, capers, pepperoni and vinegar chips. Christina Tosi has created a few new special desserts, including three different mini cookies ($3.50 for three): The Choco Chip, The Shoop (sugar cookie with salt and pepper) and The Ritz, made with buttery crackers. JJ Basil, Ando&apos;s culinary head, also developed a hibiscus and pomegranate donut ($3).</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="051616ando.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20171011053158im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_nellcasey/051616ando.jpg" width="640" height="480"> <br> <i> (Dan Dickinson/Gothamist)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>Gothamist&apos;s Dan Dickinson took Ando out for a test drive already and reports back with positive findings. First, it&apos;s quick. <em>Really</em> quick. Dickinson placed his order at 11 a.m. on the dot; by 11:03 a.m., his order had been prepared and by 11:07 a.m. it was out for delivery via UberRush. By 11:13 a.m., he was devouring a &quot;huge, wonderful, incredible&quot; serving of fried chicken with &quot;a little bit of spice to it&quot; and a &quot;solid&quot; honey mustard. </p>

<p>Chang&apos;s other delivery investment, Maple, has been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171011053158/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/20/david_chang_maple_lunch_deliver.php#photo-1">well-received</a> since launching last year and Chang&apos;s mastered the quick-service model with his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171011053158/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/19/fuku_madison_square_garden.php">growing Fuku fleet</a>. This new option feels like a marriage of those two concepts, and one that could be easily replicated in other neighborhoods, which feels like a likely direction for the ambitious chef. </p>

<p>For now, it&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171011053158/https://andofood.com/delivery">just Midtown East</a> getting the taste, Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m.</p>
