<p>Manhattan&apos;s relentless transformation into a soulless corporate shopping mall has claimed a few more victims this week. Real estate investment company <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160526081516/http://www.thejacksongrp.com/?page=about">The Jackson Group</a> has purchased the retail space of 333 Sixth Avenue, which currently houses a Papaya Dog, Crazy Fantasy Tattoo and &quot;adult novelty&quot; sex shop Fantasy Party. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160526081516/http://therealdeal.com/blog/2013/04/12/a-west-village-fantasy-will-end-after-jackson-groups-21m-retail-buy/">The Real Deal reports</a> that the $16.5 million deal closed on April 10th and the company already plans to raise rents substantially to attract big retail outlets. &#x201C;I am getting close to $300 [per square foot] and taking it to $500-plus,&#x201D; The Jackson Group owner Ike Chehebar revealed. &#x201C;You get the Times Square foot traffic without the $2,000 [per square foot rents].&#x201D; Sigh.</p>

<p>Some of the clients Chehebar would like to court? Victoria&apos;s Secret, Sephora, Dylan&apos;s Candy Bar, Aeropostale and Under Armor. In other words, all the stores that tourists travel hundreds of miles to visit because this is the kind of &quot;Only In New York!&quot; retail they can&apos;t find at home. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160526081516/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20130422/greenwich-village/papaya-dog-porn-shop-on-sixth-ave-be-replaced-by-trendy-retail">DNAInfo spoke to William Kelley</a>, executive director of the Village Alliance, an advocacy group that aims to &quot;enhance the neighborhood&#x2019;s quality-of-life by creating a cleaner, safer and more enjoyable environment.&quot; Kelley predicts &quot;the closure of this adult shop will go a long way toward improving this section of the Village.&quot;</p>

<p>Guess it&apos;s time to find a new spot to purchase your <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160526081516/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/29/the_best_hot_dogs_in_new_york.php">tubular meats</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160526081516/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/19/finally_lingerie_for_men.php">lacy things</a> (at least until Victoria&apos;s Secret opens).</p>
