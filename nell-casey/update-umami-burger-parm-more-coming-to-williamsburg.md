<p><strong>[Update Below]</strong> The Williamsburg Restaurant Rumor Mill is churning in high gear today with news of four new potential eateries opening within the neighborhood in the near future. The Real Deal <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429201508/http://therealdeal.com/blog/2013/12/06/apple-eyes-bam-south-bedford-avenue-for-first-brooklyn-store-sources/">buried the lede</a> in a piece on a new Apple Store possibly coming to Bedford Avenue (first it was a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429201508/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/05/starbucks_confirmed_on_bedford_in_w.php">Starbucks</a> then a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429201508/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/17/williamsburg_may_get_j_crew_right_a.php">J Crew</a>!): both Umami Burger and another Parm spinoff are slated to open on North 4th Street sometime in the near future. Salad chain <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429201508/http://sweetgreen.com/">Sweetgreen</a> may also be on tap. Psh, <em>salad</em>.</p>

<p>The Umami chain seems hellbent on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429201508/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/24/californias_popular_umami_burger_co.php">taking over NYC</a>, both with their popular burgers as well as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429201508/http://gothamist.com/2013/12/04/umami_burger-owned_pizza_chain_comi.php">that pizza thing</a>, so a move near rapidly yuppifying Bedford Avenue makes sense. Likewise for the Torrisi team, who&apos;ve been opening restaurants in rapid succession since opening their first in 2010. This would be the third Parm location following the original Mulberry Street and a Yankee Stadium outpost.</p>

<p>Elsewhere in the Hipstaverse, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429201508/http://ny.eater.com/archives/2013/12/is_red_farm_plotting_a_williamsburg_expansion.php">Eater discovered</a> a liquor license application on this month&apos;s CB1 meeting for none other than Schoenfeld and Ng&apos;s Red Farm. They list the address at 20 Skillman Avenue, a stone&apos;s throw from the BQE and Union Pool. The team opened their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429201508/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/07/first_taste_of_new_uws_red_farm_now.php">second location on the UWS</a> this fall; Eater notes that Shoenfeld has talked further expansion in the past.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> A rep for Red Farm tells us &quot;that liquor license application for 20 Skillman Ave isn&apos;t [ours],&quot; and says their legal name is RF Hudson LLC, not Red Farm BK LLC as noted in Eater&apos;s post yesterday. Womp womp. Sorry Brooklyn, looks like you&apos;ll be traveling for your Pac-Man dumplings after all.</p>
