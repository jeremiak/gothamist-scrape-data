<p>Greenpoint&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110105341/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/25/boat_dining_drinking_2016.php">floating but tethered</a> drinking vessel <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110105341/http://www.thebrooklynbarge.com/">The Brooklyn Barge</a> announced it will reopen for the season next Wednesday, May 25th. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110105341/http://gothamist.com/2015/09/26/the_brooklyn_barge_bar_is_now_open.php">The bar</a> had an abbreviated season last year, finally opening in September. </p>

<p>Moored off Milton Street with views of darling Transmitter Park, the Barge offers some <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110105341/https://www.instagram.com/p/8G_c0oEoBH/?taken-by=nellcasey">pretty enticing vistas</a> of Manhattan and the East River. The menu appears to have gotten a bit of a refresh, with Grilled Fish Tacos and loaded Tugboat Fries with pulled pork, cheese and jalapenos.</p>

<p>While there&apos;s plenty of booze&#x2014;10 different tap beers, a tasty-sounding Rum Punch with spiced rum and fruit juice, among other imbibables&#x2014;the operation has always made a big deal out of its programming leg, which includes free kayaking and stand-up paddle boarding lessons, sailing lessons and catch-and-release fishing. They also offer tours on historic vessels like tugboat Cornell and the intriguing Mystic Whaler.</p>

<p>The bar will be open daily from 11 a.m. to 2 a.m.</p>
