<p>Didn&apos;t get enough <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150123020445/http://gothamist.com/2012/08/16/ice_skate_in_august_under_jaguars_a.php">ice skating done in August</a>? Don&apos;t worry, because even though <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150123020445/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/01/foliage_watch_when_will_we_be_seein.php">the leaves</a> have barely begun to turn, ice skating season has officially begun. Local rinks are firing up their Zambonis for some sweet ice action&#x2014;here&apos;s where do get your skate on around town:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150123020445/http://www.patinagroup.com/restaurant.php?restaurants_id=74">The Rink at Rockefeller Center</a></strong> opened for its skating season yesterday, though the big tree won&apos;t arrive until late November. From now through November 8th (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150123020445/http://patinagroup.com/restaurants/74/menus/Ice-Rink-PRE-HOLIDAY-schedule.pdf">PDF</a>), hit the ice for $20 ($10 more to rent skates) for 1.5 hour sessions throughout the day beginning at 8 a.m. and closing at midnight. Best to get your skating in before the 8th as the price rises to $25 and you&apos;re forced to elbow tourists for space on the ice. After January 7th the price drops again and things calm down. We&apos;re told several other programs will be available this season, including that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150123020445/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/17/rockefeller_center_offering_95_vip.php">&quot;VIP Express Skating&quot; package we told you about</a>&#x2014;feelings of superiority can be had for the low, low price of $95.</li>
<li>From October 26th through March 3rd, the <strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150123020445/http://citipondatbryantpark.com/">Citi Pond at Bryant Park</a></strong> offers free skating daily from 8 a.m. until midnight to anyone with the stamina to wait on the General Admission line. Skate rentals cost $14 and a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150123020445/http://citipondatbryantpark.com/ticket/fastpass">$25 Fast Pass option</a> lets you cut the line, should you be impatient.</li>
<li>There&apos;s no official opening date yet for <strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150123020445/http://www.wollmanskatingrink.com/">Trump (groan) Wollman Rink in Central Park</a></strong> but the website indicates the opening is imminent. Monday through Thursday admission costs a reasonable $11 and jumps to $17 Friday through Sunday. Oglers pay a $5 fee just to stand near the ice so you may as well just rent the $7 skates and have at it. Hours vary from day-to-day so <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150123020445/http://www.wollmanskatingrink.com/">check the website</a> before you head out.</li>  
<li>A little bit to the north in Central Park, <strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150123020445/http://www.centralparknyc.org/visit/things-to-see/north-end/lasker.html">Lasker Rink</a></strong> opens in November and has two oval rinks, one reserved for high school  hockey teams and another for all ages. Admission for adults is $6.75 plus an additional $6 skate rental fee.
</li><li>Over in Queens, the indoor rink <strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150123020445/http://www.cityicepavilion.com/public-skating/">City Ice Pavilion</a></strong> provides the least expensive skating options, though without the romance of the great outdoors. Monday through Friday skaters take to the ice for a mere $5 with weekend prices a similarly cheap $8. Rent a pair of $5 skates and you&apos;ll have plenty of pennies leftover for a satisfying cup of vending machine hot cocoa. The rink hosts a variety of hockey leagues and sports teams so <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150123020445/http://calendar.cityicepavilion.com/">consult this schedule</a> for free skate information.</li>
<li>Keep an eye out for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150123020445/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/21/photos_new_standard_skating_rink.php#photo-1">the Standard&apos;s ice skating experience</a>, which usually pops up sometime in November, and includes things like Gl&#xFC;hwein!
</li></ul>

<p>And just a reminder, Brooklynites hoping to perfect their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150123020445/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salchow_jump">triple salchows</a> this season: aside from some <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150123020445/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/29/lets_all_cool_off_with_this_vintage.php">frozen puddles</a>, you&apos;re outta luck. Neither <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150123020445/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/09/mccarren_park_pool_won.php">McCarren Park&apos;s pool</a> nor the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150123020445/http://gothamist.com/2010/12/16/prospect_park_3.php#photo-1">promised rink in Prospect Park</a> will open this year. Any enterprising young creatives want to start a Gliding on the Gowanus Kickstarter campaign?</p>
