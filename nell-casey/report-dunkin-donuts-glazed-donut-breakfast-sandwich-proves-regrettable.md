<p>We&apos;re always amused/horrified by corporate food chains&apos; flashy stunt products&#x2014;behold the 1,000 calorie Cinnabon &amp; Oreo &quot;Chillatta&quot;!!!&#x2014;and lately we can&apos;t stop dreaming/having nightmares about Dunkin&apos; Donuts&apos; new <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160212034806/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/03/behold_the_dunkin_donuts_glazed_don.php">Glazed Donut Breakfast Sandwich</a>. The Dunkin&apos; team has yet to airlift a box to Gothamist HQ, but yesterday our extern <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160212034806/https://twitter.com/emiliesaysthat">Emilie Ruscoe</a> heeded the call of the bacon on our behalf. Unfortunately, her dispatch from the Land of Dunkin&apos; is seasoned with bitter disappointment. </p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="061113dd_reality.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160212034806im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_nellcasey/061113dd_reality.jpg" width="640" height="454"> <br> <i> <span class="photo_caption">Well it doesn&apos;t <em>look</em> all that terrible (Emilie Ruscoe)</span></i></div> <p></p>

<blockquote>It&apos;s not that big, just average glazed doughnut-sized. The overall flavor is a lot like what you get when you accidentally get non-maple syrup on powdered eggs. The eggs are definitely reconstituted &amp; pre-cooked so they can be heated up and served quickly. The bacon was limp, and the whole thing was kind of soggy. The donut itself is unheated (to keep the glaze intact i&apos;m guessing)</blockquote>

<p>She concluded: &quot;I don&apos;t think I&apos;ll ever need to get one again.&quot; Well, we&apos;re sorry to disillusion everyone, but this is just further proof that not all junk food creations can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160212034806/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/30/taste-testing_the_new_triple_double.php">live up to the hype</a>. </p>

<p>If you&apos;re still not convinced that the humble egg sandwich should be left in its simplistic glory, the Glazed Donut monstrosity can be yours for just $3.80, tax included. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160212034806/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/29/the_10_best_cheap_eats_in_nyc.php">But you could do better</a>.</p>
