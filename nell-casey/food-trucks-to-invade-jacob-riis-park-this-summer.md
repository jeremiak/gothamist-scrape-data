<p>With Fort Tilden beach <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131004232947/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/15/fort_tilden_beach_hurricane_sandy.php">off-limits this summer</a> due to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131004232947/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/08/photos_the_hurricane-trashed_beach.php#photo-1">ongoing Sandy cleanup</a>, sun seekers will be stretching out their towels on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131004232947/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/20/a_guide_to_the_best_nyc_beaches_you.php">city&apos;s other beaches</a> like Rockaway Beach and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131004232947/http://www.nyharborparks.org/visit/jari.html">Jacob Riis Park</a>. To lure more visitors to the latter, the National Park Service has commissioned three food trucks (and counting) to park at the Rockaways destination.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131004232947/http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20130605/HOSPITALITY_TOURISM/130609941">Crains reveals</a> that Rickshaw Dumpling, Eddie&apos;s Pizza Truck and Pura Vida were the first three food dispensaries to submit proposals. Starting this weekend, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131004232947/http://www.eddiespizzany.com/">Eddie&apos;s Pizza</a> will be slicing up their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131004232947/http://www.eddiespizzany.com/downloads/Eddies-Truck-Menu.pdf">&quot;bar pies&quot;</a> each Sunday through June. Pura Vida, a company that specializes in healthy foods and smoothies, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131004232947/http://rickshawdumplings.com/">Rickshaw Dumpling</a>, are also both set to motor over to the beach, though their schedules are not yet determined. </p>

<p>The NPS has also requested proposals for bike and kayak rentals to service the nearby beaches at Rockaway, Howard Beach and Broad Channel. With the A train <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131004232947/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/29/a_train_service_to_rockaway_finally.php">finally back in service</a> and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131004232947/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/21/rockabus_returns_saturday_with_expa.php">Rockabus rocking</a>, getting out to the beach should be a breeze. </p>
