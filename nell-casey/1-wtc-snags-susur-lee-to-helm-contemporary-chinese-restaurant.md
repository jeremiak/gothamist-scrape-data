<p>One World Trade Center is nearing completion and the first dining option inside the new building has been announced. Chef Susur Lee together with the China Center will open a contemporary Chinese restaurant inside the Center&apos;s private luxury member club on the 66th floor. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408105335/http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/china-center-new-york-announces-partnership-with-tunglok-group-and-celebrity-chef-susur-lee-224232431.html">release</a> says the cuisine will &quot;[combine] the traditional culinary characteristics and traditions from the eight main regions in China and artistically [recreate] them into one which is global and relevant to the modern day.&quot;</p>

<p>The as-yet-unnamed restaurant will serve breakfast, lunch and dinner, though it won&apos;t actually be open to the public. For those who do dine there, floor-to-ceiling windows offer views of the skyline, though you&apos;ll have to go <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408105335/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/02/photos_from_the_top_of_one_world_tr.php#photo-1">all the way up</a> for the really jaw-dropping vista. This is the first restaurant announced for the tower, which will also house Conde Nast&apos;s headquarters and government tenants. </p>

<p>The new venture marks Chef Lee&apos;s return to the NYC dining scene after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408105335/http://gothamist.com/2008/11/18/first_bite_last_nights_preview_of_s.php#photo-1">his hotly-anticipated restaurant</a> Shang <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408105335/http://ny.eater.com/archives/2010/03/susur_lee_blames_shang_failure_on_boring_new_york_palates.php">bombed on Rivington Street</a>.
