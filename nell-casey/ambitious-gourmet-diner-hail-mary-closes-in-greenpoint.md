<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508050654/http://www.hailmarybk.com/">Hail Mary</a>, the cute gourmet &quot;diner&quot; on Greenpoint Avenue, closed over the weekend after less than a year in the neighborhood. This is sad news for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508050654/http://gothamist.com/2017/01/26/best_mac_and_cheese_nyc.php">mac and cheese lovers</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508050654/http://gothamist.com/2016/05/24/hail_mary_greenpoint.php#photo-7">funfetti fanatics</a>, and anyone who enjoys high quality comfort food in a cozy, welcoming environment. If you love a restaurant, <em>go there frequently</em>, or risk saying farewell. </p>

<p>Reached via email, owners Ham and Sohla El-Waylly told us they &quot;tried their best&quot; to keep their Greenpoint dream alive. &quot;We made something we loved and that completely represented us through and through,&quot; they told Gothamist. &quot;Unfortunately, it wasn&apos;t enough. We&apos;re happy we got to try and that this experience has made our relationship stronger.&quot; </p>

<p>In his May 2016 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508050654/http://gothamist.com/2016/05/24/hail_mary_greenpoint.php#photo-1">review of Hail Mary</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508050654/http://gothamist.com/tags/quickbites">Quick Bites</a> columnist Scott Lynch expressed some worry about the restaurant. </p>

<blockquote>There&apos;s an excellent restaurant to be found within the ambitious new Hail Mary: Greenpoint&apos;s Finest Diner, but I worry. I worry because, despite its heavily-trafficked location toward the end of Greenpoint Avenue, it&apos;s hard to stumble upon this place...I worry about Hail Mary because it&apos;s an ambitious, almost special-occasion restaurant wrapped inside a burger-and-shake joint. These sorts of hybrids have successful precedents, of course, but it&apos;s not the easiest trick to pull off.</blockquote>

<p>The accomplished chefs&#x2014;with resumes that include names like Del Posto and Atera&#x2014;said they &quot;hope [they&apos;re] lucky enough to try again.&quot; We&apos;d be lucky to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508050654/http://gothamist.com/2017/01/10/deep_fried_burrata_hail_mary.php#photo-1">get that deep fried burrata</a> if they do stage a comeback.</p>
