<p>It&apos;s been nine months since [SPOILER ALERT] we learned of [SERIOUSLY SPOILER ALERT] poor cousin Matthew&apos;s fate, and it will be another month until we see how the residents of Downton Abbey have adapted to their new circumstances. But fans of Britain&apos;s most highbrow soap opera will get a little distraction to tide them over sooner than that. Next week, PBS will launch a tea food truck, bringing a wee taste of the UK to our streets for those who haven&apos;t <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160209075545/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/05/nycs_best_high_teas_to_celebrate_th.php">found it on their own</a>.</p>

<p>The truck offers gratis tea and biscuits, doled out by servers dressed in period garb; sadly, we don&apos;t think that means <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160209075545/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/01/downton_abbeys_jim_carter.php">Mr. Carson</a>. They&apos;re also offering photos ops with a picture of Highclere Castle, which serves as the setting for the show&apos;s noble family drama. It won&apos;t make you a member of the Crawley clan, but it could make for a fun holiday card!</p>

<p>The truck rumbles through Manhattan Monday through Friday of next week from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. (noon to 8 p.m. on Thursday); here&apos;s where to get your high tea on:</p>

<p>Monday, December 9<br>
East 14th St. at University Place <br>
 <br>
Tuesday, December 10<br>
6th Avenue between 40th &amp; 41st Street<br>
 <br>
Wednesday, December 11<br>
50th St. between 6th &amp; 7th Avenue</p>

<p>Thursday, December 12<br>
The New York Times Center, 41st St. between 7th &amp; 8th Avenue<br>
 <br>
Friday, December 13<br>
Broadway between 66th and 67th Street</p>

<p>Series 4 of <em>Downton Abbey</em> premieres January 5th on PBS with rambunctious Rose, mopey Lady Mary and lots of the Dowager Countess&apos;s withering wit.<br>
