					<p>Butcher shop turned smokehouse <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170616011038/http://butcherbar.com/">Butcher Bar</a> opens its second location on Wednesday, expanding from Queens into Manhattan with a new Lower East Side restaurant. They&apos;ll be doing BBQ from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170616011038/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/27/regional_bbq_styles_in_nyc.php#photo-1">all over the country</a>, but their Burnt Ends (&quot;meat candy,&quot; as they call it, a Kansas City staple) have been a big draw since the joint debuted in 2011. </p>

<p>Pitmaster Matthew Katakis is again working with Texan Executive Chef Orlando Sanchez to manage the overall barbecue program, which features tons of smoked meats (from an on-site wood smoker) from beef brisket (there&apos;s that Lone Star heritage coming through) to pulled pork to smoked ribs. The meat fest continues with charcoal-cooked steaks like a Bone-In Ribeye and Bekshire Pork Chops, plus a forthcoming game menu with animals including bison, venison and wild boar.</p>

<p>Check out the rest of the Southern-tinged menu <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170616011038/http://butcherbar.com/menu/">here</a>, which includes things like mac and cheese, fried pickles, Brussels sprouts and queso, plus lots of burgers and sandwiches.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> There&apos;s a butcher shop here, too <strike>It doesn&apos;t appear that the Manhattan operation will feature the in-house butcher shop like the original in Astoria</strike> and it&apos;ll have plenty of references to the trade, including tap handles that look like knives and cleavers and plenty of cattle imagery.</p>

<p><em>146 Orchard Street, 212-842-8000; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170616011038/http://butcherbar.com/">butcherbar.com</a>. Closed Mondays.</em></p>
