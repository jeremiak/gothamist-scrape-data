<p>Looks like Yankees star Derek Jeter is finding creative ways to have fun during his stint on the disabled list. The hobbled shortstop was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426153453/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/derek_had_phil_of_fame_DEbxN51d8Sb1a91v5eXa8O?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Local">photographed leaving a Greenwich Village Starbucks</a> yesterday with a coffee cup suspiciously marked &quot;Philip.&quot; Did Jeter steal someone&apos;s Skinny Flavored Decaf Latte? Is this Derek&apos;s secret alter-ego to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426153453/http://gothamist.com/2009/12/06/starbucks_barista_no_fan_of_derek_j.php">avoid coffee confrontations</a>? What happened to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426153453/http://gothamist.com/2007/10/07/name_games_yank.php">Johnny Drama</a>???</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="2013_05_philip.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426153453im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2013_05_philip.jpg" width="640" height="548"> <br> <i> &quot;Philip&quot; (Pacific Coast News)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>It&apos;s pretty fantastic that Jeter thinks he can order his triple shot lattes incognito. Sure, he&apos;s not wearing pinstripes, but isn&apos;t the horizontal striped shirt&#x2014;which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426153453/http://gothamist.com/2012/11/30/ny_post_fat-shames_husky_derek_jete.php">isn&apos;t a slimming pattern</a>!&#x2014;pretty much the same thing? Also, he&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426153453/http://gothamist.com/2011/07/09/derek_jeter_homers_to_become_first.php"><em>Derek Fucking Jeter</em></a>. Even if you don&apos;t follow baseball you&apos;ve <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426153453/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/20/derek_jeter_named_most_marketable_m.php">seen his mug somewhere</a>. </p>

<p>It could just be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426153453/https://twitter.com/jenchung/status/333939226372616192">another case</a> of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426153453/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/14/hey_starbucks_baristas_nobody_is_na.php">barista name botching</a>, but that would take all the fun out of this mystery. Does Philip <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426153453/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/13/after_you_sleep_with_derek_jeter_yo.php">give out the same post-coital swag</a>? </p>
