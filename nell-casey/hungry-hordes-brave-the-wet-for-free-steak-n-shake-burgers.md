</div></div>					<p>Close to 200 people <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151031171846/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/12/photos_these_people_waited_in_the_r.php#photo-1">gathered in the cold and wet</a> this morning to score a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151031171846/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/09/steak_n_shake_opens_thursday_with_f.php">year&apos;s worth of free Steak &apos;N Shake burgers</a> from the Midwestern import and we were on hand to witness the burger hysteria. And what hysteria it was!</p>

<p>Five Kings College roommates&#x2014;who heard about the opening through Gothamist!&#x2014;told us they arrived at 4 p.m. yesterday, lured by the appeal of a year of free food, and ended up the first in line. Others we talked to knew about the chain from other states and were eager for the familiar flavors. &quot;<strong>I went to school in Ohio and it&apos;s an institution out there.</strong> This one is fancier though because it&apos;s the &apos;Signature&apos; one&quot; explained Ben Bromberg, who had been waiting on line since 7 a.m. this morning with his friend Eric Saber. Asked why they were willing to wake up early and stand in the rain to wait, they replied that it was <strong>a &quot;New York thing to do&quot;</strong> and they would &quot;be able to get free lunches for a year and rub it in our co-workers faces.&quot; It seems that the desire for free food outweighed any burger and shake nostalgia from most of the line. </p>

<p>So what to expect at David Letterman&apos;s new neighbor? The Steak &apos;n Shake &quot;Signature&quot; restaurant features a slightly altered menu (sorry, no cheesesteaks here) but Midwesterners will recognize the classic Steakburgers and hand-dipped milkshakes. The bright, red, flashy interior fits in well with its Times Square surroundings though finding a seat will be difficult in the teeny tiny space. Although this grand opening gimmick was a big success, it remains to be seen if this burger newcomer will be successful enough to keep Danny Meyer awake at night. One thing they have that Meyer&apos;s Shake Shack does not? Those amazing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151031171846/http://drinks.seriouseats.com/2011/10/soda-we-try-all-100-flavors-from-the-coke-freestyle-machine.html">Coca-Cola Freestyle soda machines</a>. Score one, Steak &apos;N Shake!<br>
