Hooray! \<br\>\<br\>Boozy, sweet, sticky&mdash;there are many things to like about this hearty compote but the best part is \<strike\>drinking while you make it\<\/strike\> it\'s super easy to make. If you can\'t find fresh figs in your market, sub in rehydrated apricots, prunes or other dried stone fruits, which should be readily available, especially in the winter. This recipe was created for biscuit topping but it\'s by no means limited to slathering on your baked goods; serve some alongside roasted chicken or pork or spoon a dollop on some vanilla ice cream or yogurt. \r\n\<br\>\<br\>\r\n\<strong\>Ingredients\<\/strong\>\r\n\<br\>\<br\>\r\n\<form mt:asset-id=\"817389\" class=\"mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image\" style=\"display: inline;\"\> \<div class=\"image-none\"\> \<img alt=\"111113figprep.jpg\" src=\"http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_nellcasey/111113figprep.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"427\" /\> \<br /\> \<i\> \<span class=\"photo_caption\"\>Woodford FTW (Nell Casey/Gothamist)\<\/span\>\<\/i\>\<\/div\> \<\/form\>\r\n\<br\>\<br\>\r\n\<ul\>\r\n\<li\>8 ounces fresh figs, quartered and with stems removed\<\/li\>\r\n\<li\>1/2 cup dark brown sugar\<\/li\>\r\n\<li\>1/3 cup bourbon (you can sub rye but don\'t go throwing Johnnie Walker in there)\<\/li\>\r\n\<li\>1/3 cup water\<\/li\>\r\n\<li\>2 tablespoons lemon juice\<\/li\>\r\n\<li\>1/4 teaspoon black peppercorns\<\/li\>\r\n\<li\>1/4 teaspoon whole cloves\<\/li\>\r\n\<li\>1 fingertip-sized knob of fresh ginger (more if you can take the heat)\<\/li\>\r\n\<li\>pinch kosher salt\<\/li\>\r\n\<\/ul\>\r\n\<br\>\<br\>\r\nYou\'ll want to create a (FANCY COOKING WORD ALERT) \<em\>sachet\<\/em\> to house the whole spices because it\'s a maddening task to find all those little buggers once the jam has congealed and it\'s also not sexy to bite down on a whole peppercorn and break your tooth. Luckily, sachet is just a fancy word for \"tiny little cheesecloth bag,\" so calm down. Cut a square of cheese cloth, place the peppercorns, clove and ginger inside, then tie with a string. Congratulations! You are one step closer to a James Beard Award.\r\n\<br\>\<br\>\r\nNext: dump everything into a small saucepan over medium-low heat, stir it around a bit, then ignore for the next 20 minutes. Well, not really. Since we\'re working with sugar&mdash;and sugar loves to burn you when you\'re not paying it enough attention&mdash;you\'ll want to check in from time-to-time to make sure the liquid hasn\'t evaporated too much (if so, add a bit of water) and that the sugar is gently caramelizing as opposed to scorching your pot.\r\n\<br\>\<br\>\r\n\<form mt:asset-id=\"817392\" class=\"mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image\" style=\"display: inline;\"\> \<div class=\"image-none\"\> \<img alt=\"111113figpot.jpg\" src=\"http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_nellcasey/111113figpot.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"427\" /\> \<br /\> \<i\> \<span class=\"photo_caption\"\>Sexxxy sugar booze fig party (Nell Casey/Gothamist)\<\/span\>\<\/i\>\<\/div\> \<\/form\>\r\n\<br\>\<br\>\r\nOnce the figs have softened nicely you should be able to macerate easily with a potato masher or a fork. By then, most of the liquid should have evaporated, leaving a nice, sweet glaze over all of the fig bits. Remove your bundle-o-spices and discard. Compote can be served hot, room temp or chilled and will keep for a few days in a tightly-sealed tupperware if you want to make it in advance.", "credit":""};galleryObj['photo_2'] = photo;</script>

Assemble ingredients, dump into pot, try not to burn it, serve.

If you have an electric hand mixer or one of them fancy Kitchen Aid things (jealouuuuuuus) your spread will be even more fluffy and airy. If not, it\'s still goddamn delicious. The tang from the goat cheese gets mellowed out with the addition of barely-sweet ricotta; adding the oil thins out the mixture so it\'s even more spreadable, while honey adds an extra touch of sweetness to balance out all the dairy.\r\n\<br\>\<br\>\r\n\<strong\>Ingredients\<\/strong\>\r\n\<form mt:asset-id=\"817950\" class=\"mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image\" style=\"display: inline;\"\> \<div class=\"image-none\"\> \<img alt=\"111413cheese_ingredients.jpg\" src=\"http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_nellcasey/111413cheese_ingredients.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"427\" /\> \<br /\> \<i\> \<span class=\"photo_caption\"\>(Nell Casey/Gothamist)\<\/span\>\<\/i\>\<\/div\> \<\/form\>\r\n\<br\>\<br\>\r\n\<ul\>\r\n\<li\>4 ounces goat cheese/Chevre\<\/li\>\r\n\<li\>3/4 cup ricotta cheese\<\/li\>\r\n\<li\>1 teaspoon honey\<\/li\>\r\n\<li\>1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil\<\/li\>\r\n\<li\>pinch kosher salt\<\/li\>\r\n\<li\>fresh pepper to taste\<\/li\>\r\n\<\/ul\>\r\n\<br\>\<br\>\r\nAllow the goat cheese to sit on the counter for 20 minutes or so to come to room temperature. This step isn\'t necessary, per se, but it will help everything incorporate much easier, especially if you\'re mixing by hand.\r\n\<br\>\<br\>\r\nToss all the ingredients into a bowl and mix thoroughly. You may want to add more salt and pepper, if you like something more savory; or extra honey if you\'re aiming for a sweeter mixture. \r\n\<br\>\<br\>\r\nServe immediately at room temp or refrigerate if you make in advance.", "credit":""};galleryObj['photo_4'] = photo;</script>
