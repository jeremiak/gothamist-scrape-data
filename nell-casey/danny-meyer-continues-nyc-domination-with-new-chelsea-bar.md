<p>Prolific restaurateur Danny Meyer has taken a break from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508135326/http://gothamist.com/tags/shakeshack">opening Shake Shacks</a> to announce yet <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508135326/http://www.ushgnyc.com/news/archives/announcements/ushg-announcement-7/">another addition</a> to the Union Square Hospitality family. Porchlight, a new bar with a &quot;Southern Accent,&quot; arrives next autumn under the guidance of Blue Smoke co-founder Mark Maynard-Parisi. The 4,000 square foot bar will live on the ground floor of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508135326/http://www.wfny.com/index.htm">Waterfront New York</a> building, which was built in 1891 as a transfer point for shipping goods in and out of the city. </p>

<p>The new bar plans to serve up signature cocktails and regional microbrews, naturally, in addition to Southern-inspired bar food. As Maynard-Parisi was the founding General Manager of Blue Smoke, one would think some of that Southern fare might include barbecue but there aren&apos;t any details about the menu just yet. If thinking of barbecue has given you a craving, you can always check out one of Blue Smoke&apos;s other <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508135326/http://bluesmoke.com/blue/">five other locations</a> in the meantime.</p>
