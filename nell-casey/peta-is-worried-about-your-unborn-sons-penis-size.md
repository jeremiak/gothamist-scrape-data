<p>If there were a food pyramid of manly foods there&apos;s no doubt the chicken wing would occupy one of the larger, more important sections. But <em>hold on to your drumsticks</em>, fellas, because your pregnant wife&apos;s wanton wing consumption could mean your son ends up with a less-endowed wingette, so to speak. In advance of this weekend&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131006181024/http://buffalowing.com/">National Buffalo Wing Festival</a> upstate, PETA <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131006181024/http://www.peta.org/mediacenter/news-releases/Keep-Pregnant-Women-Out-for-the-Sake-of-Their-Sons-Sex-Organs-PETA-Tells-Buffalo-Wing-Festival.aspx">released a plea</a> to organizers to ban pregnant women from taking part in the celebrations &quot;for the sake of their sons&apos; sex organs.&quot;</p>

<p>The group <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131006181024/http://www.ecomii.com/blogs/food/2011/09/15/eating-chicken-may-lead-to-a-smaller-penis/">points to a study</a> relating chicken consumption by pregnant women with &quot;significantly smaller penile volume&quot; in their sons. The culprit? Chemical compounds called phthalates, which are found in poultry as well as pesticides, paints and PVC plastic. Of course, PETA&apos;s ploy has more to do with animal cruelty than male endowment. &quot;Pregnant women may want to think twice before chomping on those chicken wings, or their sons could come up short,&quot; says PETA Associate Director of Campaigns Lindsay Rajt. &quot;Chickens may be little animals, but they suffer in a big way before their wings are hacked off for a stupid contest.&quot;</p>

<p>The group hopes their letter will lead to a ban on pregnant mothers competing in the wing-eating contest, though knowing PETA they&apos;d probably prefer the whole event get scrapped. We&apos;re all for helping animals live a cruelty-free life, but what about PETA&apos;s presumption that men with smaller penises somehow live less fulfilled lives? We know from experience <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131006181024/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/22/small_penis_interview_winner.php">that&apos;s simply not the case</a>.  </p>
