</a><p><a>After nine long years of forced dormancy, legendary West Village speakeasy </a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028111032/http://gothamist.com/tags/chumleys">Chumley&apos;s</a> will finally wake from its long slumber and reopen on Bedford Street. The bar, which has been closed since a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028111032/http://gothamist.com/2007/04/06/chumleys_buildi.php">chimney and wall collapse</a> in 2007, has faced <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028111032/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/23/chumleys_village_fight.php">years of opposition</a> from local groups and the community board, who&apos;ve &quot;dreaded&quot; what they perceive as a nuisance in a now-tony part of Manhattan. But <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028111032/http://ny.eater.com/2016/2/4/10916326/chumleys">Eater has reported</a> that a local restaurateur has swooped in to reopen the bar and allay fears from locals that their peace will be disturbed by any anticipated &quot;ruckus from students and tourists,&quot; as described by detractors.</p>

<p>Alex Borgognone, operator of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028111032/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/15/sushi_nakazawa.php#photo-1">lauded Sushi Nakazawa</a> just a block away, has signed on with two business partners to spruce up Chumley&apos;s to appeal to the neighborhood. Jim Miller, longtime owner and fire stoker at Chumley&apos;s, said he teamed up with Borgognone when he realized it would be a way to finally reopen the bar while appeasing locals. </p>

<p>&quot;One of the things that I had to promise to the neighborhood and to the CB and the SLA and everyone was that we would try to bring back Chumley&apos;s historically and in a way that everybody would embrace and enjoy,&quot; Miller told us via phone this morning &quot;The neighborhood has changed down there and we needed to consider that. We wanted the historical accuracy and charm and 1920s feel and Chumley&apos;s experience, but we needed to realize the product and the service needed to be elevated to today&apos;s standards.&quot;</p>

<p>To that end, the new Chumley&apos;s will apparently still have the wood-paneled walls and old photographs, but will serve &quot;a concise food menu of half a dozen or so &apos;well executed classics&apos;&#x2014;think burgers, wings, and steak frites...in the $10 to $25 range,&quot; according to Eater. They&apos;re also going to be implementing a &quot;comprehensive cocktail program&quot; with drinks priced between $10 and $15. It&apos;ll be Chumley&apos;s, but wearing a sport coat instead of a sweatshirt.</p>

<p>&quot;All along we&apos;ve heard the voices, we hear the neighborhood, we don&apos;t want the &apos;60s/&apos;70s Chumley&apos;s. I worked there in the &apos;90s and I think it doesn&apos;t get a fair shake, I think it was very good for the neighborhood, there were never any problems,&quot; Miller contests. &quot;We&apos;re going to stay true to trying to get this thing as historically accurate as we can&#x2014;the building did fall down!&#x2014;and we&apos;re bringing in a very talented restaurant team to deliver what we think will be the Chumley&apos;s experience that everybody can enjoy.&quot;</p>
