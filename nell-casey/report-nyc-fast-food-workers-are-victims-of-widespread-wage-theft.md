<p>A new survey of fast food workers in New York City revealed some disturbing truths about just how awful it can be to work for some the nation&apos;s biggest chains. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508124100/http://www.fastfoodforward.org/en/">Fast Food Forward</a>&#x2014;an advocacy group for local fast food workers&#x2014;commissioned a report to investigate wage theft among the city&apos;s many fast food workers. The report&apos;s authors spoke with 500 workers and uncovered that &quot;84 percent of workers surveyed responded that their employer had committed at least one form of wage theft in the past year&quot; and nearly half had experienced at least three different kinds of wage theft. </p>

<p>Examples of theft include overtime violations, like spreading worked hours over multiple weeks to avoid time-and-a-half rates; working through breaks; and not paying employees for work done before and after clocking in. Delivery workers are particularly prone to wage theft, like Noel Scott, a father of one who earns $5.50 an hour as a delivery person for a Domino&apos;s in Manhattan. Scott spends an equal amount of time prepping pizza, cleaning, and other non-delivery work as he does on the road, work that by law should pay him the state minimum of $7.25. Additionally, Scott faces hazards that in-store workers avoid. &quot;I&apos;ve been robbed at gunpoint doing this job,&quot; Scott revealed. <strong>&quot;I risk everything, and Domino&apos;s doesn&apos;t even pay me at the minimum. That&apos;s outrageous.&quot;</strong></p>

<p>Wage loss in certain cases can be almost $200 a week, money workers say would go a long way towards helping their families. Alvin Major, a father of four who works at three different KFCs in Brooklyn, reported being paid $7.25 per hour despite working 68 hours on an average week. &quot;They told me I cannot get overtime because I work at different stores, but that&apos;s not true,&quot; explained Major. &quot;If I was paid fairly, I would be able to provide more for my family or spend more time with my kids. It&apos;s for them that I work so hard.&quot; </p>

<p>Theft of money <em>and</em> time is also a common theme, with workers being told not to clock in for their scheduled shift because the store isn&apos;t busy. Mother of two Teresa Ramos was told by a manger at a Brooklyn Burger King to clock in 90 minutes after she was schedule to start her shift and was forced to wait in the store for that time without compensation.</p>

<p>Those are just some of the examples that drove the city&apos;s workers to rally outside a Bushwick KFC this morning to protest the findings of the report. It&apos;s the next in a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508124100/http://gothamist.com/tags/fastfoodworkers">series of ongoing rallies</a> to support fast food workers and push for unionization. The report also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508124100/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/16/nyregion/state-said-to-be-reviewing-pay-for-fast-food-workers.html?emc=eta1&amp;_r=0">caught the attention of attorney general Eric T. Schneiderman</a>, whom the Times reports will investigate the findings further. &#x201C;New Yorkers expect companies doing business in our state to follow laws set up to protect working families,&#x201D; said spokesman Damien LaVera. We reached out to Dominos for comment and will update if we hear back.</p>
