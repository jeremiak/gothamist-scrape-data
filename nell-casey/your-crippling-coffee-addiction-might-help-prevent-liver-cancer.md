<p>The five-cup-per-day coffee habit you&apos;ve been nurturing since college might offer more than just the delicious buzz to propel you through the day. A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150212173127/http://www.cghjournal.org/article/S1542-3565(13)00609-5/abstract">new study from (of course) Italy</a> reveals that coffee drinkers were less likely to develop hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most common type of liver cancer. Researchers from Milan looked at data from 3,153 cases of HCC and concluded that drinking three cups of coffee per day decreased the risk of developing the cancer by 40 percent, with some studies indicating that regular coffee consumption decreased risk by more than 50 percent. </p>

<p>Despite consistent results in all the studies, researchers weren&apos;t able to say with certainty whether the association was directly related or casual, as many patients with liver problems decrease their coffee consumption. However, coffee consumption in general seems to benefit the liver. &quot;Our research confirms past claims that coffee is good for your health, and particularly the liver,&quot; said Carlo La Vecchia, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150212173127/http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2013-10/aga-ccr102213.php">author of the study</a>. &quot;The favorable effect of coffee on liver cancer might be mediated by coffee&apos;s proven prevention of diabetes, a known risk factor for the disease, or for its beneficial effects on cirrhosis and liver enzymes.&quot; </p>

<p>So the life-giving coffee you employ for your hangovers might also erase some of the damage those Jager shots did while it also cures your headache? Sold! And if that also means we&apos;re doing our liver/<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150212173127/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/03/news_you_can_use_drinking_coffee_is.php">heart</a>/<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150212173127/http://gothamist.com/2009/12/29/coffee_can_save_your_life_maybe.php">prostates</a>/<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150212173127/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/18/drink_up_coffee_is_good_for_you_say.php">bodies in general</a> good in the long run maybe we won&apos;t stop mainlining those espressos after all.</p>
