</div></div>					<p>A London based restaurant offering&#x2014;you guessed it!&#x2014;burgers and lobsters will be opening in New York City in August of next year. DNAinfo <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429160252/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20131211/flatiron/london-burger-lobster-chain-plans-first-city-outpost-flatiron">has the scoop</a> from a recently Community Board 5 meeting, where owner Vladmir Borodin announced plans to bring the surf-and-turf eatery to the a 7,000 square foot space in the Flatiron on 19th Street. </p>

<p>The mini-chain, which operates five restaurants in London, keeps thing really, really simple, offering just three menu items, each selling for $20. Diners can chose between a burger, a grilled lobster or a lobster roll and each entree comes with fries and a side salad. British locations offer a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429160252/http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/burger-and-lobster-london?select=G-PpsrodzQUaaGFkJI9lVg#C1fCYSVg7mfzs47qLPm3qQ">groovy-looking cocktail menu</a> and Borodin says desserts and drinks will rotate and the NYC outpost. </p>

<p>We&apos;ve reached out to the company to find out more details, like where they&apos;re sourcing their beef and lobster at that cost. It&apos;ll be a challenge to cut through the burger noise in this town, especially when they&apos;re asking a steep $20. But lobster for the same price? Hell to the yeah! </p>
