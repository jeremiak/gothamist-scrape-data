<p>Cooler weather may be settling on the city but it&apos;s never too cold to enjoy a frosty ice cream cone, especially when it&apos;s free! All week <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501172259/http://www.jenis.com/">Jeni&apos;s Splendid Ice Cream</a> will be handing out gratis scoops of delicious, egg-free ice cream outside retail locations, part of Jeni&apos;s NYC Sweet Treats Truck Tour. Today the truck is parked at the Dean &amp; Deluca at 560 Broadway from 12:20 - 2:30 p.m. and tomorrow through Saturday you can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501172259/http://blog.jenis.com/map-and-schedule/">find the truck</a> during your lunch break and again in the evening. They may also announce some surprise locations <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501172259/https://twitter.com/jenisicecreams">via their Twitter account</a>.</p>

<p>The truck offers four frozen selections&#x2014;Sweet Corn &amp; Black Raspberries, Roasted Strawberry Buttermilk, Salty Caramel and Lemon &amp; Blueberries Frozen Yogurt&#x2014;and word is Jeni herself will be doing the scooping! If the FREE factor isn&apos;t enough to motivate you, remember it was one of the five best dishes we ate...<em>at a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501172259/http://gothamist.com/2012/09/10/the_five_meatiest_morsels_we_muched.php">meat festival</a>!</em></p>
