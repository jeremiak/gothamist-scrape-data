</div></div>					<p>If you haven&apos;t already melted into a puddle of sweat you might be interested in cooling off with some tasty frozen dairy products. To that end, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150328003659/http://www.dolce-sweetness.com/">Dolce Gelateria</a>, a new gelato shop, opens this weekend in the former L&apos;Arte del Gelato space on Barrow Street in the West Village. </p>

<p>Salvatore Potestio, a Sicilian native, created over 50 varieties of gelato and sorbet in a laboratory in Ridgewood, including traditional flavors like lemon, pistachio and Stracciatella, plus an olive oil flavor made with extra virgin olive oil from his family&apos;s olive grove in Italy. Does everyone in Italy just have an olive grove in their backyard? </p>

<p>The shop makes their waffle cones in-house, but they also import other kinds of cones and their brioche from Italy. In addition to scoops, they offer Italian-style ice cream sandwiches, made with any of their numerous gelato flavors, plus an Affogato al Caffe, where a scoop of vanilla gelato gets topped with a shot of espresso and some whipped cream. </p>
