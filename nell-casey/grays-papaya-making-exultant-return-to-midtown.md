<p>It seemed for a time that the city&apos;s cheap hot dog staple Gray&apos;s Papaya was inching towards extinction, with just <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170115050350/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/08/theres_only_one_grays_papaya_left_i.php">a single solitary location</a> on the Upper West Side remaining in its fleet of frankfurter stands. In the green juice revolution, there are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170115050350/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/09/grays_papaya_couldnt_survive_the_20.php">few survivors</a>.</p>

<p>However, the Recession Specialists are returning to some well-trod territory, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170115050350/http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20160826/REAL_ESTATE/160829906/grays-papaya-is-back-after-being-left-with-one-hot-dog-shop-it-is">reports Crains</a>, with a brand new outpost opening up at 612 Eight Avenue later this year, just a few blocks from their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170115050350/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/28/midtown_grays_papaya_closes_uws_get.php">previous Midtown incarnation</a>. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170115050350/http://gothamist.com/2014/07/02/the_10_best_hot_dogs_in_nyc.php">snappy dogs</a> and mysterious papaya drinks&apos;ll be feeding tourists for at least the next 20 years, according to lease details.</p>

<p>Between this and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170115050350/http://gothamist.com/2016/08/23/best_hot_dog_ever_man.php#photo-1">return of Feltman&apos;s</a>, it&apos;s a good time to be a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170115050350/http://gothamist.com/2014/06/25/the_ny_state_department_of_taxation.php">sausage sandwich</a> lover in NYC. </p>
