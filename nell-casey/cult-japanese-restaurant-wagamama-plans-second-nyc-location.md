<p>Before even opening doors <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031050141/http://gothamist.com/2015/11/25/wagamama_nyc_ramen.php">on their first foray</a> into the NYC market, cult Japanese chain <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031050141/http://www.wagamama.us/">Wagamama</a> has already set its sights on a second location. Noodles, rice and curry will be arriving at 55 Third Avenue, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031050141/https://commercialobserver.com/2016/06/japanese-inspired-food-chain-wagamama-takes-second-space-in-nyc-before-first-one-opens/">reports Commercial Observer</a>, yet another sleek addition to the nearly unrecognizable stretch of the East Village. </p>

<p>When it opens, the restaurant will operate just over 3,000-square-feet at the corner of East 11th Street. The chain, which began in London in the early &apos;90s, draws fans for its Japanese comfort foods including several types of ramen, curries, gyoza and donburi.</p>

<p>Currently, 55 Third Avenue is home to both an arm of The Smith restaurant group and an outlet of the M2M Asian grocery chain. A man answering the phone at the grocery chainlet this morning said there were no plans for M2M to shutter that location. An email to the The Smith restaurant wasn&apos;t immediately returned and we&apos;ll update if we hear back.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: Michael Jacobs of Corner Table Restaurants, which runs The Smith, says definitively that the restaurant is not closing. &quot;We have a long term lease and look forward to many more years continuing to serve the East Village,&quot; he relayed via email. </p>
