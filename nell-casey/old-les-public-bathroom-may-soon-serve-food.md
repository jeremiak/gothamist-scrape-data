<p>A former facility for bodily evacuation may soon be one for bodily ingestion, with proposed plans to turn a long-abandoned Lower East Side bathhouse into a cafe. Community Board 3&apos;s Parks &amp; Rec committee discussed plans to turn the Allen Street bathhouse in the pedestrian mall at Delancey Street into some kind of cafe or takeout establishment, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160628072931/http://bedfordandbowery.com/2016/02/the-cute-forgotten-bathhouse-in-the-middle-of-allen-street-is-becoming-a-cafe/">reports Bedford and Bowery</a>. The landmarked building, which hasn&apos;t been used since the &apos;50s, would need a $4 million renovation to reopen as a bathroom; the cost for refurbishing and renovation for another use has not yet been determind.</p>

<p>The NYC Parks won&apos;t issue the RFP until March, so there aren&apos;t any vendors lined up yet, but the committee was explicit in two things: the vendor must be reasonably-priced and must offer some kind of healthful products. Still, some are wondering why bother with another food option at all, pointing to businesses like a bike repair or rental shop that would <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160628072931/http://gothamist.com/2012/08/08/allen_street_bike_path_finally_open.php">service the community</a> in a different way. </p>

<p>Either way, the meeting was missing the most important question of all: will we be able to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160628072931/http://gothamist.com/2015/08/13/number_one_nyc_restroom_guide.php">pee there now</a>?</p>

<p><em>The post has been updated to clarify NYC Parks involvement with the project, as well as the figures associated with renovating the building.</em></p>
