										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="070213backfence.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429101144im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_nellcasey/070213backfence.jpg" width="640" height="359"> <br> <i> <span class="photo_caption">Another one bites the dust (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429101144/https://www.facebook.com/back.fence">Back Fence</a> on Facebook)</span></i></div> <p></p>

<p>Pour one out for yet another Greenwich Village institution: The Back Fence bar will <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429101144/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20130702/greenwich-village/back-fence-bar-close-after-68-years-on-bleecker-street">shutter this fall</a>. DNAinfo breaks the bad news that the legendary dive music joint has fallen victim to&#x2014;you guessed it!&#x2014;a rent increase. &quot;The lease was up and there just wasn&apos;t really any way for me to renew it,&quot; explained second generation owner Ernie Scinto. &quot;I&apos;m going to miss the place.&quot;</p>

<p>Scinto&apos;s parents opened The Back Fence on Bleecker and Thompson in 1945 and eventually the bar began hosting multiple live music acts every night of the week. Over time, other live music venues opened around it, including The Red Lion, The Bitter End and Kenny&apos;s Castaways, which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429101144/http://ny.eater.com/archives/2012/10/legendary_kennys_castaways_will_close_tonight_forever.php">strummed its final chord</a> last fall. </p>

<p>So what corporate monstrosity should we expect to move in later this year? A CVS and a Capital One bank already occupy two corners of the intersection, so we&apos;re guessing either a Starbucks or perhaps another <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429101144/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/07/dying_breed_bleecker_bobs_sound_fix.php">froyo shop</a>. Whatever it is, they probably won&apos;t let you drop peanut shells on the floor, and that&apos;s a damn shame.</p>
