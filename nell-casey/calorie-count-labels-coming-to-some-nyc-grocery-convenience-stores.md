<p>A new calorie labeling rule coming to city food retailers like grocery stores adds even more venues for enacting the furtive eye movements New Yorkers have been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170615185633/http://gothamist.com/2008/04/16/judge_says_open.php">perfecting for years</a> to avoid knowing the calorie count <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170615185633/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/13/shake_shacks_calorie_counts_now_onl.php">in a ShackBurger</a> (it&apos;s 550&#x2014;sorry!).</p>

<p>Beginning in late May, grocery stores and other purveyors operating more than 15 locations nationwide will be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170615185633/http://www1.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/permit/cal-label-faq.pdf">required to post the caloric measurement</a> of all prepared food items including sandwiches, soups and other packaged foods. Independent stores like bodegas are safe, so desperate hangover BECs can still be enjoyed without additional layers of guilt and regret.</p>

<p>Chain restaurants&#x2014;which have been subjected to these requirements in NYC for years and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170615185633/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/26/all_americans_will_be_forced_to_ack.php">nationally since 2011</a>&#x2014;will also have some more local requirements to contend with. In addition to posting calorie counts on menus, restaurants will need to have full nutritional information available on site if customers ask for it and will need to have a visible statement noting the daily recommended caloric intake of 2,000 calories. </p>

<p>&quot;We are all tempted to make unhealthy choices, but with these new, common-sense rules, New Yorkers will have the information to make better choices and lead healthier lives,&quot; Mayor Bill de Blasio said through press materials. &quot;We can no longer wait for federal action, and urge other cities to follow our lead.&quot;</p>

<p>According to the Mayor&apos;s office, New York City delayed enforcement of its 2008 calorie labeling rules in anticipation of something being enacted on the federal level. Last month, the FDA announced it would be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170615185633/http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-menu-labeling-delay-0502-biz-20170501-story.html">delaying enforcement</a> for another year, prompting action on the local level. </p>

<p>Many chain convenience stores, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170615185633/https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7-eleven-new-york-51?select=mkKJeGZBlOdyNXhplEokig">like 7-Eleven</a>, have already begun posting calorie counts, but beginning May 22nd, the Departments of Health and Consumer Affairs begin an educational push to notify non-compliant businesses about the previous and newly-enacted requirements. On August 21st, the education grace period ends and businesses will be subjected to fines ranging from $200 - $600 for non-compliance.  </p>

<p>So looks like we&apos;ll have a few more months to perfect <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170615185633/http://gothamist.com/2015/11/04/numbers_are_theoretical_anyway.php">laser-precision menu reading</a> at the Whole Foods lunch line.</p>
