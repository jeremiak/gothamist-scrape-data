<p>Following the success of their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170403004814/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/10/photos_will_ferrell-themed_bar_stay.php#photo-1">Will Ferrell-themed watering hole</a>, Stay Classy owners Zach Neil &amp; Brian Link are opening another establishment with a cinematic nod, this time to director Tim Burton and his cast of misfits, ghouls and decaying freelance bio-exorcist ghosts. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170403004814/http://www.beetlehousenyc.com/">Beetle House</a> looks to be opening soon at 308 East Sixth Street, according to a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170403004814/http://evgrieve.com/2016/04/tim-burton-themed-bar-opening-in-former.html">report by EV Grieve</a>, with Burton-themed cocktails and a food menu using &quot;meat sourced locally from 100% innocent humans captured wild on the streets of NYC.&quot; The screenplay for<em> Mars Attacks! 2</em> just writes itself, really. </p>

<p>According to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170403004814/http://www.beetlehousenyc.com/">website</a>, the restaurant portion of the place will be by reservation only, with some things also available for delivery. The cheeky options including &quot;Love It Meat Pie&quot;&#x2014;that&apos;s where that long pork comes in&#x2014;Edward Burger Hands, Eggs Skellington and a side of Charlie Corn Bucket. </p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="042116cocktail.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170403004814im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_nellcasey/042116cocktail.jpeg" width="640" height="426"> <br> <i> (via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170403004814/https://www.facebook.com/Beetlehousenyc/photos">Facebook</a>)</i></div> <p></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170403004814/http://www.beetlehousenyc.com/drink-menu/">Drinks</a>&#x2014;&quot;poisons, potions &amp; elixirs&quot;&#x2014;are also nods to Burton&apos;s oeuvre, so sip on The Barber&apos;s Bloody Mary, Edward&apos;s Lemonade (an Old Fashioned) and a Chocolate Factory Martini, garnished with a chocolate bar. </p>

<p>The bar&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170403004814/https://www.facebook.com/Beetlehousenyc/">Facebook page</a> indicates it&apos;s a theme park, theater and bar, so expect some zany, corpse-themed decor and probably some fun themed parties like they throw at the Will Ferrell joint. For more details as they emerge, you can text &quot;preview&quot; to 646-510-4786 to find out when it&apos;s showtime.</p>
