<p>[Update below] Waiting in line for popular vendors at Smorgasburg is just <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509140903/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/17/ramen_burger_watch_2013.php">part of the experience</a> these days, but sometimes the stars align and you arrive at your desired stall to find it blissfully uncrowded. That&apos;s the scene GQ&apos;s Alan Richman stumbled upon when he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509140903/http://www.gq.com/blogs/the-feed/2013/08/alan-richman-reviews-smorgasburg-brooklyn-nyc.html?mbid=gqpr">visited Smorgasburg&apos;s DUMBO outpost</a> recently. The venerable food writer arrived at the Mighty Quinn&apos;s setup just after the 11 a.m. opening time, found it line-free and ordered a sandwich. Then they dropped the bomb: they wouldn&apos;t serve him until there was a line. Richman explains:</p>

<blockquote>I asked the lady at the counter for a sandwich. She smiled sweetly, and in a reasonable tone told me that she wouldn&apos;t serve me until there was a line, and my best bet was to start one.
<br><br>
I&apos;ve experienced a lot of atrocious customer service in my life, but this was a milestone. What&apos;s worse, the ploy worked. New Yorkers don&apos;t think much in life is worthwhile unless they have to stand in line to get it.<br><br>
A line started forming behind me. After five minutes, it numbered 20. Not good enough for her. The awful woman began taunting her customers. &quot;Soooo close,&quot; she cooed. &quot;Soooo close.&quot; Soon there were 25 people in line plus three baby carriages. I suspect she was eagerly awaiting the wail of tiny babies suffering in the summer heat.</blockquote>

<p>The longer the line, the more desirable the product, presumably, but wouldn&apos;t the line just form naturally regardless of serving a few intrepid eaters who made the effort to arrive early? We reached out to Mighty Quinn&apos;s for comment about their alleged line trickery and we&apos;ll update if we hear back. For his part, Richman eventually got his two &quot;tiny&quot; sandwiches and while he enjoyed the pork he found the brisket &quot;a little dry.&quot; Maybe if he hadn&apos;t been made to wait, the beef would have been more moist! He also hated the pickles. So there.</p>

<p>On a related note, an experiment earlier this summer by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509140903/http://bedfordandbowery.com/2013/06/the-great-brisket-race-can-you-beat-the-mighty-quinns-line-by-crossing-the-river/">Bedford + Bowery</a> revealed that one could stuff one&apos;s gullet full of meat faster by visiting the brick and mortar Mighty Quinn&apos;s in the East Village rather than waiting in the long lines at the &apos;Burg. Looks line or no line, if you&apos;re heading to the Smorgasburg outpost, be prepared to wait.</p>

<p><strong>[Update]</strong> Micha Magid, co-partner of Mighty Quinn&apos;s, responded to Richman&apos;s article by calling it &quot;categorically false&quot;:</p>

<blockquote>We have our staff there, we have our food ready to go. We don&apos;t get a two second break until we&apos;re basically sold out. Part of that process is making sure that everything&apos;s set up perfectly. If someone comes before we open unfortunately they have to wait until everyone&apos;s done with the setup process. <strong>We do not try to create a line.</strong> We believe in our products and we serve quality food. It takes time to prepare, everything is sliced to order. We always go as fast as we can.
<br><br>
We make one sandwich every thirty seconds to a minute; that&apos;s the fastest we can go. <strong>We don&apos;t wait for a line to open or a line to start before we start serving. All I can say is that it&apos;s just not true.</strong> It&apos;s never been our policy and I can&apos;t imagine that that was actually the quote. I have to imagine that we were still in the process of getting set up. 
<br><br>
It&apos;s ridiculous and I&apos;ve spoken to the girl who was on the board that day. She&apos;s a mother, she&apos;s worked for us since we started in Brooklyn two years ago. She knows what our DNA is all about and it&apos;s about customer service and quality food. Taunting the line is so out of left field and so preposterous that it&apos;s not even something that I could even assign a 1% probability to it actually happening. </blockquote>
