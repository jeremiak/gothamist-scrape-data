The new restaurant trades in the paneled walls and gilded accoutrement of its predecessor <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151031122233/http://www.amnh.org/plan-your-visit/admissions-ticketing">Bar Celona</a> for more of a street vibe&#x2014;though they kept the chandelier. The interior reveals a mishmash of industrial accents like rough hewn wood and exposed beams with artistic pieces including a graffiti&apos;d wall, a tower of antique televisions and an electric neon heart.</p>

<p>The team combined elements from their previous two restaurants to birth this third incarnation. Beer, cocktails and wine all get nods, with 12 draft lines rotated with the seasons, wines from small-run vineyards and artisanal cocktails. Teetotalers and buzz seekers can refuel with Toby&apos;s Estate coffees, which gets roasted right around the corner. As for eats, expect American fare like burgers topped with eggs and grain salads with bulgar wheat, asparagus and kale. </p>
