                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="2012_09_ciderweek.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20131011002617im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2012_09_ciderweek.jpg" width="640" height="427"> <br> <i> How do ya like them apples? (Cider Week&apos;s Facebook)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>Take a break from huffing pumpkin spice everything and appreciate autumn&apos;s <em>other</em> special bounty: the apple. Specifically, the delicious creation that comes about when apples are left to ferment, get funky and, ultimately, get boozy. We&apos;re talking, of course, about cider&#x2014;not the plastic jugs from the refrigerated section or even the tasty hot stuff at the farmer&apos;s market&#x2014;but honest to goodness fermented apple juice. Whether you&apos;re a celiac sufferer or just plain tired of drinking beer, cider offers enough variety to keep your taste buds occupied while simultaneously getting you tipsy. Win-win! </p>

<p>Starting next Friday, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131011002617/http://www.ciderweekny.com/">Cider Week</a> kicks off, bringing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131011002617/http://www.ciderweekny.com/events">tasting events, pairings and cooking demos</a> chock full of apple-y goodness. </p>
