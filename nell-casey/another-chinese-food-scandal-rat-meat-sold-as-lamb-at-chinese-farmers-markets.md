<p>If you were horrified by the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131006160854/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/25/ikea_finds_horse_in_its_meatballs_i.php">great horse meat scandal of 2013</a> then hold on to your butts, because your worst fears about the sketchy origin of your &quot;lamb&quot; lo mein are about be realized, sort of. Chinese officials <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131006160854/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/04/world/asia/rat-meat-sold-as-lamb-in-china-highlights-fears.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;_r=2&amp;">arrested 63 people yesterday</a> accused of passing off rat, fox and minx meat as mutton and selling the deceitful meat at markets in Shanghai and the Jiangsu Province. The shady dealers injected the meat with nitrates, gelatin and red pigments to pass the meat off as lamb, a process that netted them nearly $1.6 million. And we were worried the delicious MSG-laden containers of noodles we cram into our gaping maw after a Friday night bender were going to kill us. </p>

Or does it just not feel right unless you&#x2019;re making fakes?&#x201D; the user went on to question. Raise them?
