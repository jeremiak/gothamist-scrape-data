<p><em>Golden Girls</em> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170324173504/https://www.instagram.com/p/BQ6B689gyPr/?taken-by=biggayicecream&amp;hl=en">marathons</a> just got a whole lot sweeter now that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170324173504/http://biggayicecream.com/">Big Gay Ice Cream</a> has started selling their frosty confections by the pint. </p>
