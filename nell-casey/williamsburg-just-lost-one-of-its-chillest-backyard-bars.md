title: Williamsburg Just Lost One Of Its Chillest Backyard Bars

<p>The winter season has so far claimed two chill outdoor drinking spots in Williamsburg, first with the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108023105/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/07/nita_nita_gentrification_tape.php#photo-1">death of Nita Nita</a> and now off-the-beaten-track standby Good Co., which is getting an overhaul and rebranding as a Southern concept restaurant. &quot;I&apos;m recreating a fictional town somewhere in the south sometime in the first half of the 20th century,&quot; explains owner Josh Mazza, who runs UES establishments The Gilroy and Seamstress. &quot;It&apos;s a delta juke joint inside and a Savannah garden party outside.&quot; RIP chill backyard games, welcome...dainty Southern finger food?</p>

<p>Good Co. wheezed its last breath Monday night, according to a rep from In Good Company Hospitality, who run Parker &amp; Quinn and Refinery Rooftop and will be partnering with Mazza for the new restaurant. If we&apos;re being honest, the neighborhood joint had been slowly devolving into a true dive in recent years&#x2014;not that there&apos;s anything wrong with that. </p>

<p>The bus that held court in the large side yard was removed at some point, taking with it some of the bar&apos;s unique appeal, but the outdoor space was still a reliable place to down reasonably-priced shot-and-beer deals and play a round of corn hole. If nothing else, there was almost always a seat, making it a great alternative to the neighborhood&apos;s other overcrowded outdoor bars (we&apos;re looking at you, Crown Vic). </p>

<p>As for the new concept, dubbed Belle Shoals, we&apos;re told Seamstress chef Aaron Lamonica will be designing the food menu and Pam Wiznitzer handling the drinks. We weren&apos;t thrilled with a version of fried chicken Lamonica did uptown, where liquid smoke overpowered the meat, but cocktail hounds enjoy Wiznitzer&apos;s beverage program uptown, so likely she&apos;ll be well-received across the East River. </p>

<p>Does the neighborhood have room for more Southern food? There&apos;s already a lot of fried chicken flying around. At least &quot;juke joint&quot; sounds vaguely promising, even if there&apos;s going to be classy mixology stuff on the menu. The Belle Shoals teams is aiming to open mid-February.</p>
