<p>By the end of January, NYC&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170114141906/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/08/theres_only_one_grays_papaya_left_i.php">last Gray&apos;s Papaya standing</a> won&apos;t be so lonely, because the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170114141906/http://gothamist.com/2016/08/29/grays_papaya_midtown.php">new Midtown location</a> is just about up and running.</p>

<p>Photographer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170114141906/http://www.davidchinchillafoto.tumblr.com/">David Chinchilla</a> snapped this photo at 612 8th Avenue this afternoon, showing signage being installed at the new location.

Nearly two years ago to the day, the Sixth Avenue outpost shuttered to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170114141906/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/09/grays_papaya_couldnt_survive_the_20.php">transform into a juice bar</a>. </p>
