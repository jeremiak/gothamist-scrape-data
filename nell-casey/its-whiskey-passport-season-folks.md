<p>Oh the weather outside is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160503165806/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/09/long_hot_eternal_summer.php">alarmingly pleasant</a>, but we&apos;re still in the throes of whiskey season, where fireside toddies and swirling glasses of bourbon are all but inevitable. If those scenarios sound enticing, you&apos;d do well to pick up this season&apos;s <strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160503165806/https://www.eventbrite.com/e/the-nyc-good-whiskey-passport-2015-2016-tickets-19611866621?">Whiskey Passport</a></strong>, which will whisk you off to 43 different NYC bars to sample their brown spirits selection. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160503165806/https://www.eventbrite.com/e/the-nyc-good-whiskey-passport-2015-2016-tickets-19611866621?discount=NellOnTheRocks">$37 passport</a> entitles you to a glass of whiskey or whiskey cocktail at all of the eligible bars beginning this Sunday and running through February 13th, also known as the perfect cuffing season length so you&apos;re out of the picture by Valentine&apos;s Day.</p>

<p>Many of us will decorate a Christmas tree this year, but Gingerbread Houses take another level of commitment. Luckily, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160503165806/http://addisongroupnyc.com/venues/monarch/">Monarch Rooftop &amp; Indoor Lounge</a> has provided a super easy outlet for our exterior design ambitions with a <strong>Gingerbread House Decorating Competition</strong> this Saturday afternoon from 1 p.m. to 4 p.m. Participants will decorate their own white picket fence dreams with candy, icing and the like, while sipping the lounge&apos;s  Peppermint Patty, Rumchata Eggnog Latte, and Ginger Hot Toddy cocktails. Other festive accoutrements include an enormous Christmas tree and carolers. Proceeds from the day&apos;s event with benefit City Harvest.</p>

<p>Santa shouldn&apos;t have all the milk-and-cookies fun, so head over to Royal Palms Shuffleboard Club on Sunday for the <strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160503165806/http://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/2466560">Brooklyn Cookie Takedown</a></strong> and show the big man in the red suit who&apos;s boss. Beginning at noon, shove as many cookies as you can into your mouth in the two hour time limit; offerings are from home chefs and could be anything from classic chocolate chip to someone&apos;s grandma&apos;s recipe for kitchen sink cookie. All&apos;s fair in love and Nestle Tollhouse morsels. </p>
