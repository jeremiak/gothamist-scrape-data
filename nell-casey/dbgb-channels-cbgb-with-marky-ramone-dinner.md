<p>There&apos;s been an amplifier-sized hole in our heart since <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130524030628/http://gothamist.com/2006/10/16/doors_close_at.php">CBGB closed in 2006</a>, despite attempts to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130524030628/http://gothamist.com/2012/09/20/cbgb_fest_will_return_next_may.php">resurrect the iconic venue</a> in recent years. But for one night, punk rock fans and foodies will have a chance to relive the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130524030628/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/08/cbgb_biopic_will_feature_authentic.php">grungy past</a> when Marky Ramone teams up with Daniel Boulud for an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130524030628/http://dbgb-markyramone.eventbrite.com/">evening of music and feasting</a>.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, April 30th, the former Ramone&apos;s drummer&#x2014;who is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130524030628/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/10/blintzkrieg_bop_a_ramones_food_truc.php">no stranger to the food scene</a>&#x2014;will be on hand at Boulud&apos;s Bowery hotspot <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130524030628/http://gothamist.com/2009/05/18/boulud_previews_dbgb_kitchen_and_ba.php">DBGB Kitchen &amp; Bar</a> to play some hand-selected tunes from his collection and dish out his &quot;Drum-Punk&quot; Brooklyn tomato sauce with smoked mozzarella ravioli. The show continues at the restaurant&apos;s communal table with Boulud&apos;s roasted suckling pig and spring vegetables with dessert pyrotechnics in the form of a pistachio and strawberry Baked Alaska. </p>
