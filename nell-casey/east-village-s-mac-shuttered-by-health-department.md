<p>Diners indulging in customizable crocks of cheesy noodles probably weren&apos;t opting for the mouse dropping topping and dirty dish cloth mix-ins. The East Village location of S&apos;Mac was closed by the health department yesterday after inspectors witnessed workers touching food with bare hands and other critical violations. </p>

<p>The restaurant racked up an impressive 71 violation points for multiple offenses including evidence of mice, soiled wiping clothes and, apparently, not keeping their bathroom in good condition. It&apos;s a huge jump in points for the popular pasta spot, which received 13 points and an &quot;A&quot; grade on their inspection last September.</p>

<p>A call to the restaurant this morning went to a voicemail message saying the eatery would be &quot;closed for a few days as [they&apos;re] doing some renovations now.&quot; The message also said the restaurant &quot;should be open by the weekend,&quot; though you may be better off <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150905075929/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/09/mac_and_cheese_mecca_smac_opens_mur.php#photo-1">visiting another location</a> while they sort out that whole mouse thing.
