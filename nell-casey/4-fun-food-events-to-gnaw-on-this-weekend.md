<p>Alex Guarnaschelli <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140424131142/http://gothamist.com/2013/12/02/butter.php#photo-1">opened the second go-around</a> of her restaurant <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140424131142/http://www.butterrestaurant.com/">Butter</a> at the end of last year, filling up a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140424131142/http://gothamist.com/2013/12/02/butter.php#photo-1">gorgeous subterranean space</a> inside the Cassa Hotel on 45th Street. Like any good restaurateur, Guarnaschelli will take on brunch starting this weekend, classing up the hangover-eggs-and-mimosas affair with a <strong>gourmet brunch buffet and live jazz</strong>. On Saturdays and Sundays from 11 a.m. 3 p.m. the restaurant sets out a huge spread, including baked goods like homemade allspice coffee cake with meyer lemon streusel topping and Wisconsin sharp cheddar cheese biscuits; a raw salad station that includes a smoked salmon platter with all the fixins&apos;; and an omelette station with dozens of fillings and toppings from grilled broccoli to goat cheese to house-made pork cracklins. The $59 per person deal includes all the food your belly can take plus a choice of one cocktail.</p>

<p>Snap up quality cookbooks from the hallowed halls of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140424131142/http://www.jamesbeard.org/">James Beard Foundation</a> this Sunday at their <strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140424131142/http://www.jamesbeard.org/events/jbf-biannual-cookbook-sale-0">biannual cookbook sale</a></strong>. From 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. they&apos;re slashing prices on over a thousand new and used cookbooks, perfect for gift-giving or learning some new techniques yourself. Cookbooks might be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140424131142/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/22/new_italian_pantry.php">going in the app direction</a> but handing down classic cookbooks from generation to generation should be part of every family&apos;s life; now&apos;s a good time to start that tradition.</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="031414kingscountydis.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20140424131142im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_nellcasey/031414kingscountydis.jpg" width="640" height="422"> <br> <i> <span class="photo_caption">(<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140424131142/http://kingscountydistillery.com/">Kings County Distillery</a>)</span></i></div> <p></p>

<p>The space that once housed Marines charged with ousting illegal hooch operations now houses a distillery all its own. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140424131142/http://gothamist.com/tags/brooklynnavyyard">Brooklyn Navy Yard&apos;s</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140424131142/http://bldg92.org/">BLDG 92</a> offers Factory Tours of the site&apos;s active industry and this Sunday they&apos;re taking a peek into the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140424131142/http://kingscountydistillery.com/"><strong>Kings County Distillery</strong></a> that operates on premises. In direct contrast to the 19th century &quot;Whiskey Wars,&quot; the distillery operates freely, but they&apos;re still interested in the scandalous past of NYC&apos;s illegal booze industry. Take a tour, chat about the industry&apos;s past and present and, of course, sample some of the goods. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140424131142/http://bldg92.org/events/factory-tour-whiskey-wars/">Tickets are $15</a>; the event begins at 3:45 p.m.</p>

<p>The cocktail boom continues at NYC bars, where glasses of mixologist&apos;s precious inventions can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140424131142/http://gothamist.com/2014/03/03/bar_54.php#photo-1">set you back $23</a>. For budget-minded/reasonable folks, setting up your own cocktail bar might be the best bridge between two worlds. To that end, Momofuku Presents classes offers <strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140424131142/http://momofuku.tumblr.com/post/78658359465/wintersessions">Strategic Set-Up: Cocktail Party 101</a></strong> this Sunday from 1 p.m. to 3 p.m. Momofuku bar director John Debary and Booker and Dax bar manager Maura McGuigan instruct on setting up a cocktail party from a concise shopping list to prep work that takes you out from behind the bar and mingling with your guests. It&apos;s a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140424131142/http://www.eventbrite.com/e/momofuku-presents-winter-sessions-2014-tickets-10176404901">$75 ticket</a> but the skills will set you up for the long run.</p>
