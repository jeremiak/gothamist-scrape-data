<p>Like a scene out of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506164531/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/12/woman_falls_through_sidewalk_grate.php">every New Yorker&apos;s worst nightmare</a>, a visually impaired visitor from Washington, D.C. is suing the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506164531/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/14/doughnut_plant_now_open_at_hotel_ch.php#photo-1">Doughnut Plant outpost in Hotel Chelsea</a> after he fell down a sidewalk elevator shaft, resulting in a pinky amputation. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506164531/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20130319/chelsea/blind-man-loses-braille-reading-pinky-finger-after-elevator-shaft-fall">According to DNAinfo</a>, Brian Hurley was just trying to take his friend&#x2014;who happens to be completely blind&#x2014;to get a delicious cream-filled pastry when he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506164531/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20130319/chelsea/blind-man-loses-braille-reading-pinky-finger-after-elevator-shaft-fall">unexpectedly stumbled into the open shaft</a>, which was devoid of any barriers or caution markers to indicate the hazard. Hurley fell between 8 and 10 feet into the shaft, resulting in the pinky amputation and other injuries that kept him out of work for almost a month. </p>

<p>Jay Danker, Hurley&apos;s attorney, argues that Hurley uses his pinky &quot;to hold his walking stick. He uses it to read braille. He uses it more than you or I would.&quot; The suit holds the Doughnut Plant and its landlord, The Chetrit Group, responsible for creating a &quot;dangerous, defective, open and traplike condition.&quot; &quot;They could have marked it or even had someone standing there, making sure people don&apos;t fall in,&quot; argues Danker. </p>

<p>But Stephan Donahue, attorney for the Chetrits Group, disagrees. &quot;From our point of view, there was no negligence on the part of the hotel,&quot; he says, though he couldn&apos;t comment on whether that meant Doughnut Plant would ultimately be liable. With any luck this isn&apos;t just one of Nanny Bloomberg&apos;s latest <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506164531/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/01/mayor_bloomberg_offers_his_dieting.php">don&apos;t get fat</a> tactics. </p>
