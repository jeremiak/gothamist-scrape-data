<p>The Scorpion Bowls of day&apos;s past have been replaced by vats of vegetables floating in brine, now that 13-year-old LES store <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140424021648/https://www.pickleguys.com/">Pickle Guys</a> have expanded into the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140424021648/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/14/les_tiki_bar_pkny_will_shutter_at_e.php">former PKNY space</a> on Essex Street. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140424021648/http://www.boweryboogie.com/2014/03/pickle-guys-expanding-old-pkny-space-essex-street/">Bowery Boogie reports</a> that the vendors have expanded their subterranean operation into the next door storefront, which offers space for &quot;a prep area, more refrigeration units, barrel storage, and office area.&quot; Painkillers for pickles? Not a terrible tradeoff at all.</p>

<p>The tiny operation turns out <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140424021648/https://www.pickleguys.com/products.php">all different kinds of pickled products</a> from lightly brined New Pickles to 1/3 Sours to Sweet Gherkins. They also do more unusual pickling of things like tomatoes, baby carrots, pineapple and watermelon alongside standards like olives, garlic and sauerkraut. You can&apos;t score a tiki cocktail at the space anymore, but you can snag some savory pickle juice to pair with DIY shots of whiskey. <br>
