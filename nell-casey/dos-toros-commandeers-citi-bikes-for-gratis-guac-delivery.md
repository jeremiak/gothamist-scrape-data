<p>From <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506165610/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/21/fat_jew_swears_hes_serious_about_gi.php">free workouts</a> to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506165610/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/02/photo_citi_bike_baskets_perfect_for.php">questionable child transportation</a>, the successful <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506165610/http://gothamist.com/tags/citibike/">Citi Bike</a> program has been used in all sorts of ways not outlined in its terms of service. And now we can add gratis guac and chips delivery to the list! </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506165610/http://www.dostoros.com/">Dos Toros Taqueria</a> in Williamsburg has &quot;hijacked&quot; five Citi Bikes and they&apos;ll be cycling around the neighborhood through Sunday handing out free guacamole and chips to anyone lucky enough to cross their path. In addition, they&apos;ll be giving out coupons for a free Tecate, which we strongly urge you to drink when you&apos;re <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506165610/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/22/drunk_citi_biking_is_the_coolest_wa.php"><em>not</em> getting on a bike</a>. </p>

<p>Suggestion: whoever <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506165610/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/26/trivia_bell_house_cronuts.php">wins Gothamist trivia</a> should set up a Cronut-By-Citi-Bike delivery system. </p>
