</div></div>					<p>Taco Bell barrels forward in its quest to dominate the land of bizarre stoner foods with the debut of its long-awaited breakfast menu. The chain announced its opening lineup up of just-barely-Mexican breakfast offerings today, adding to the already released <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505135405/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/12/taco_bell_and_cinnabon_collaborate.php">Cinnabon <strike>Sugar Bombs</strike> Delights</a>. The menu makes its Nachos Bell Grande debut on March 27th&#x2014;mark your calendars!</p>

<p>So what fresh hell do our intestines have to look forward to? Amidst the tame Breakfast Burritos and A.M. Grilled Tacos we find the morning version of the chain&apos;s first foray into madness/brilliance: the Crunchwrap. Instead of beef bits and wilted lettuce we find scrambled eggs, cheese, a sausage patty (or bacon or steak) and a hash brown standing in for the hard tortilla. To counter McDonald&apos;s popular McGriddle abominations, T.B. enlists the waffle as a coconspirator in their Waffle Taco, stuffed with scrambled eggs, cheese and either sausage or bacon &quot;served with a side of sweet syrup.&quot; WHERE ARE THE MIGAS, TACO BELL????</p>

<p>The brand says its &quot;growing relevance with Millennials&quot; sparked the decision to offer morning additions to the menu, which they&apos;ll serve until an age-friendly 11 a.m. For its part, QSR breakfast dominator McDonald&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505135405/http://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/mcdonalds-eyes-longer-breakfast-hours-22647220">may extend breakfast hours</a> to appeal to &quot;late&quot; risers looking for an Egg McMuffin. &quot;We know, as an example, that breakfast on the weekend cut off at 10:30 doesn&apos;t go very well,&quot; head of McDonald&apos;s USA Jeff Stratton told the AP. If these breakfast offerings have even half the insanity surrounding the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505135405/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/06/taco_bell_will_probably_be_making_d.php">most hyped taco of all time</a> then look forward to a future paved in sweet syrup laden dough bombs. </p>

<p>If you dare to see how the sausage gets made, step right this way...</p>
