										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="030216brisket.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170917205140im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_nellcasey/030216brisket.jpg" width="640" height="426"> <br> <i> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170917205140/http://www.nycfoodphotographer.com/">Daniel Krieger</a>)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>First there was the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170917205140/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/12/cochon_555_2016.php">Prince of Porc</a> and now the monarchy of meat will be crowning its <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170917205140/http://brisketkingnyc.com/">Brisket King</a> in the next big celebration of artisan butchering. The crowning jewel of Texas barbecue will be the cut of choice at the March 16th event, which will feature dishes from some of NYC&apos;s top meat slingers, a butchering demo and plenty of booze&#x2014;for those of us not wielding sharp knives.</p>

<p>Last Year, Bill Durney of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170917205140/http://gothamist.com/2015/05/28/best_bbq_nyc.php">superlative NYC barbecue spot</a> Hometown BBQ took home the crown with his traditional smoked brisket. Durney&apos;s not on the lineup this y ear, so it&apos;ll be down to this year&apos;s competitors, who include Marlow and Daughters, The Cannibal, Dinosaur Bar-B-Que, Hill Country, Mable&apos;s and Robert Austin Cho of Kimchi Smoke, among others. Attendees are welcome to sample any and all of the lip smacking fare; German knife-maker W&#xDC;STHOF will be handing down the judgement.</p>

<p>On the non-competitive side, Jay Fox of Hudson &amp; Charles will be doing a carving demo on full beef chuck shoulder. Fox&apos;s West Village spot was recently awarded the title of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170917205140/http://www.villagevoice.com/best-of/2015/food-and-drink/best-butcher-7782234">best butchery in NYC</a>.</p>

<p>There are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170917205140/http://brisketkingnyc.com/tickets/">two ticketing options</a> for this year&apos;s event, including single admission for $90, which buys three and a half hours of beef snacking and any beverages, alcoholic or not, one can consume in that time slot. Groups of six can also opt for a $1,000 private table, which gets you all of the above plus a Brisket King t-shirt.</p>

<p><em>Brisket King 2016 takes place on Wednesday, March 16th from 6 p.m. - 9:30 p.m. at Sanders Studios at 525 Waverly Avenue in Clinton Hill.</em></p>
