<p>Shake Shack&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170420105440/http://gothamist.com/2015/07/23/best_veggie_burgers_nyc.php">Shroom Burger</a> is the stuff of veggie burger legend&#x2014;anything that delicious and, frankly, that dangerous, deserves to be on a pedestal. On Saturday, the Upper West Side Shack will serve a one-day-only companion in fungi, the &quot;Wellness in the Schools Mushroom Burger,&quot; sales of which will benefit the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170420105440/http://www.wellnessintheschools.org/">Wellness in the Schools</a> nonprofit that encourages healthy eating and physical activity in public schools. Created with chef Bill Telepan, the burger is a &quot;flat-top griddled mushroom burger topped with swiss cheese, pickled maitake aioli and crispy shallots.&quot; Snag it for $6.99 if you&apos;re in the area.</p>

<p>Yakitori&#x2014;the Japanese cooking style of skewered and grilled ingredients, particularly chicken&#x2014;comes to Williamsburg Fridays and Saturdays with a new &quot;Late Nite Yakitori&quot; at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170420105440/http://www.fourhorsemenbk.com/">Four Horsemen</a>. Chef Nick Curtola will be serving Sasso chickens in a variety of forms including liver ($4), heart ($4), tsukune (meatball, $5), thighs with scallion ($4) and wings ($4). All the skewers will come with yuzu mayonnaise and will be available from 11 p.m. to 1 a.m.</p>

Park your keister on one of the picnic benches for Neopolitan pizzas, Italian-inspired sandwiches, ice cream and a full liquor license with cocktails, wine and beer. They&apos;re also serving a weekend brunch to go with the spectacular views into Lower Manhattan and Lady Liberty.</p>
