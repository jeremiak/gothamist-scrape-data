<p>If it&apos;s been a personal goal of yours to watch Gene Hackman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170417064653/http://gothamist.com/2015/01/05/the_french_connection_car_chase_sce.php">wreaking havoc</a> on the streets of Brooklyn in a 1971 Pontiac LeMans while feasting on oysters and steak, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170417064653/http://www.nitehawkcinema.com/">Nitehawk Cinema&apos;s</a> the place to be in August. The Williamsburg cinema&apos;s immersive <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170417064653/http://www.nitehawkcinema.com/series/film-feasts/">Film Feasts</a> series have previously taken us on culinary journeys through <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170417064653/http://gothamist.com/2014/09/13/honey_bunnys_tasty_burgers_jack_rab.php">mobbed up LA</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170417064653/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/08/eat_and_drink_your_way_through_apoc.php">Marlon Brando&apos;s encampment in Cambodia</a> and now it&apos;s the 1971 Academy Award-winning classic <em><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170417064653/http://www.nitehawkcinema.com/movie/french-connection-ff/">The French Connection</a></em> about NYPD narcotics detectives. </p>

<p>The menu&apos;s created to sync up with the film, with dishes being brought out timed to when they&apos;re relevant to the action on the screen. The Four Star Lunch, for example, is a reference to the scene <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170417064653/http://ny.eater.com/2011/3/25/6690475/remembering-the-copain-a-bistro-with-a-french-connection#4297248">set at Midtown&apos;s The Copain</a>, where two heroin smugglers dine on steak while Popeye Doyle (aka Hackman) watches them from outside. </p>

<p>Booze pairings are always part of the action, too, and this time the cinema has teamed up with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170417064653/http://www.fourhorsemenbk.com/">Four Horsemen</a>&#x2014;ya know, the Williamsburg wine bar <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170417064653/http://gothamist.com/2015/08/19/james_murphy_guy_fieri_the_apocalyp.php">owned by James Murphy</a> of LCD Soundsystem&#x2014;who&apos;ve dipped into their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170417064653/http://gothamist.com/2015/06/16/four_horseman_james_murphy.php#photo-1">very &quot;personal&quot;</a> collection to accompany each dish. </p>
