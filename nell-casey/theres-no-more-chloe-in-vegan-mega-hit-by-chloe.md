<p>Weeks after local vegan chain by Chloe <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170330021156/http://gothamist.com/2017/03/08/by_chloe_williamsburg.php#photo-1">opened its fourth</a> NYC location comes word there&apos;s no more Chloe involved in the operation. ESquared Hospitality, which made a significant investment in the brand, has &quot;terminated&quot; its relationship with founder Chloe Coscarelli, the vegan chef and cookbook author, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170330021156/https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-york-vegan-chain-battles-identity-crisis-1490566758?mod=e2tw">the Wall Street Journal reports</a>. At least we&apos;ll have the <strike>memories</strike> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170330021156/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/11/by_chloe_vegan_bacon_magic_recipe.php">fake bacon</a>.</p>

<p>The split follows a time of upheaval, during which Coscarelli filed a lawsuit against ESquared executives and subsequently went into arbitration. ESquared CEO Jimmy Haber invested $10 million of his own money to finance the brand&apos;s expansion after he said Coscarelli backed away from an attempt to bring in outside investors. Through a representative, Coscarelli told the Journal she was concerned about maintaining her vision for by Chloe after allegedly not being allowed to meet with a potential investor. </p>

<p>According to court papers filed last year and obtained by the Journal, Coscarelli&apos;s lawyer accused ESquared of &#x201C;improperly seizing control&#x201D; of the company and &#x201C;forcing out the very chef whose name, likeness and culinary techniques represent all of the company&#x2019;s value.&quot;</p>

<p>By Chloe will continue to do business without its namesake&#x2014;for now. Coscarelli plans to get her name removed from the chain to &quot;protect the integrity of [her] brand.&quot; </p>
