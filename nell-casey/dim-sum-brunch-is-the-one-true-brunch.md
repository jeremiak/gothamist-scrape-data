<p>The clattering carts of the city&apos;s Chinatowns are a brunch meal everyone should experience, but dim sum can be procured outside those neighborhoods like at newly-opened <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170324030812/http://juelanclub.com/">Jue Lan Club</a>, which took over the former Limelight nightclub space last December. Executive Chef Oscar Toro is doing a Saturday and Sunday <strong>dim sum brunch</strong> beginning at 11 a.m., offering plates of gossamer-skinned Bone Marrow &amp; Prawn Dumplings ($15), the requisite Pan Fried Pork and Chive Dumplings ($13) and his Chinese Sausage &amp; Egg Dumplings ($8). It&apos;s not just dumplings on the menu, he&apos;s doing takes on spring rolls, wraps and other bao, in addition to larger plates of Chicken Egg Foo Young ($12) and Duck Salad ($15). </p>

<p>On Saturday evening, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170324030812/http://bowerystation.openhouse.me/">The Old Bowery Station</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170324030812/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/07/yumpling_asian_street_food_pop-up.php">once again</a> hosts Taiwanese supper pop-up <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170324030812/https://www.facebook.com/yumpling"><strong>Yumpling</strong></a>, who are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170324030812/https://www.universe.com/events/yumpling-taiwanese-food-feat-cathy-erway-nomz-tickets-new-york-SBW1T3">collaborating</a> with food writer Cathy Erway and food entrepreneur Anthony Wu for this month&apos;s event. On the menu, five courses celebrating the flavors of Taiwan, beginning with chilled five spice boiled peanuts and cod and garlic chive dumplings in hot chili oil, followed by Yan Su Ji (Salt and Pepper Popcorn Chicken) with Basil Yumpling Sauce, Soy-braised Oxtail and Cang Ying Tou, a dish made with garlic chives and ground pork.
