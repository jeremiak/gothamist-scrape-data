<p>In its quest to be the world&apos;s greatest hamburger chain, Shake Shack has chosen the site of its next stronghold: the Staten Island Mall. If it&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170723111840/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/19/ode_to_applebees.php">good enough for Applebee&apos;s</a>, it&apos;s good enough for Danny Meyer.</p>

<p>Reps for the restaurant say they have a targeted opening of 2019. The news, which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170723111840/http://www.silive.com/westshore/index.ssf/2016/11/shake_shack_opening_in_staten.html">was first reported by SI Live</a>, was met with enthusiasm by Staten Islanders, who expressed their joy (and...&quot;excitement&quot;) on Twitter.</p>
