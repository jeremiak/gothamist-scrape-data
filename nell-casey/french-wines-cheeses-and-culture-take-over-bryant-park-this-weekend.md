<p>There&apos;s just something about Bryant Park, at least where the French are concerned. Starting with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130930120845/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/19/photos_thousands_of_white-clad_dine.php#photo-1">Diner En Blanc</a> last week and culminating in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130930120845/http://tasteoffrance.com/">Taste of France</a> event this weekend, the iconic park has seen lots of francophile action this month. It&apos;s the second Taste of France event taking place in New York City and the first time they&apos;ll be occupying the grounds behind the library, transforming it into a bustling French marketplace, with cooking demonstrations, wine sampling, health and beauty vendors and even a French Bulldog Show.</p>

<p>The event seeks to highlight the &quot;best of French innovation, lifestyle and culture,&quot; according to the release. Over <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130930120845/http://tasteoffrance.com/exhibit/">120 booths</a> offering food, cosmetics, metal workers, music and other facets of French identity are set up throughout the park to immerse visitors in a mini-France between the skyscrapers of midtown. You won&apos;t suffer hefty exchange rates for Euros, but in order to purchase goods at the event you will need to trade in your cash for <em>Marianne&apos;s</em>&#x2014;the official currency of the event&#x2014;which luckily are exactly equal to one dollar.</p>

<p>Though visitors are offered free entrance into the main grounds, a few ticketed events offer deeper immersion, like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130930120845/http://www.tasteoffrance.com/2013/GrandWineTasting2013.pdf">Le Grand Wine Tasting</a>, the headline event of the weekend. On Saturday from 3:30 p.m. to 6:30 p.m., the terrace transforms into a giant wine tasting area with room for 500 guests to sample over 100 French wines plus French cheese and charcuterie. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130930120845/http://www.eventbrite.com/event/8169953551/es2/?rank=1">Tickets for the event cost $150</a>, with a portion of sales benefiting <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130930120845/http://www.actionagainsthunger.org/">Action Against Hunger</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130930120845/http://www.wheelingforward.org/">Wheeling Forward</a>.</p>

<p>Like its predecessor Diner En Blanc, the Taste of France is throwing a big picnic on the lawn of the park on Sunday at noon. Diners are encouraged to don their finest red, white and blue duds and snap up a basket filled with all sorts of French treats for a relaxing afternoon in the autumn sun. </p>

<p>The Taste of France runs from 11 a.m. to 11 p.m. on Saturday, September 28th and 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. on Sunday, September 29th.</p>
