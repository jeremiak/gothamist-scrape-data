<p>With swimsuit season coming to a close we can now turn our attention to bulking up for the winter with delicious comfort foods, namely loads of dairy and carbs. Let&apos;s welcome <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150215223424/http://valleyshepherd.com/meltkraft-brooklyn">Meltkraft</a>, a new artisan grilled cheese shop with an excellent dairy pedigree. Opening next week in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150215223424/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/27/almondine_bakerys_south_slope_space.php">former Almondine space</a> on 9th Street in Park Slope, Meltkraft brings a heart-stopping menu of comfort food bliss to the neighborhood, with cheese sourced from owner Eran Wajswol&apos;s New Jersey farm <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150215223424/http://valleyshepherd.com/">Valley Shepherd Creamery</a>.</p>

<p>Like their original Philadelphia location, Meltkraft grills up seven different cheese-based sandwiches, using everything from aged cheddar to brie combined with all sorts of tasty fillings. Purists will dig the Shepherd Classic&#x2014;filled with three Valley Shepherd cheese aged three months&#x2014;but we&apos;re most excited for the Valley Thunder: 12 month aged cheddar, Bubbe&apos;s brisket and baked macaroni and cheese. You can also opt to grill your sandwich in duck or bacon fat for a small fee. If there&apos;s a better ambassador for comfort-waist jeans we certainly can&apos;t think of it. </p>

<p>Roasted fennel and tomato soup and a kale and fennel coleslaw lighten up all the dairy. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150215223424/http://www.grubstreet.com/2013/08/meltkraft-opening-park-slope.html">Grub Street notes</a> that the shop will offer a rotating selection of regional microbrews and the menu reveals that natural wines will be available by the glass or bottle. </p>
