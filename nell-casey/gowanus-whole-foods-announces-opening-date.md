<p>Brooklyn&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508154458/http://gothamist.com/tags/gowanuswholefoods">much hyped</a> first Whole Foods has been dangled in front of us like an organic heirloom tomato since 2006 and the grocer has finally announced its opening date. Mark your calendars for Tuesday, December 17th, when the shiny new doors open on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508154458/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/14/signs_at_whole_foods_gowanus_locati.php">formerly toxic site</a>, bringing all the high-priced groceries a gentrifier could ever want.</p>

<p>The enormous 56,000 square-foot market takes over the block&#x2014;minus that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508154458/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/05/gowanus_whole_foods_will_almost_wra.php">cute if dilapidated building on the corner</a>&#x2014;at Third and 3rd and includes a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508154458/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/01/gowanus_whole_foods_will_have_20000.php">20,000 square foot rooftop farm</a> and a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508154458/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/15/the_gowanus_whole_foods_will_have_a.php">rooftop beer bar</a>. In addition to their standard salad bars and hot food stations, the market also features a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508154458/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/13/yuji_ramen_evil_twin_brewing_coming.php">take-out noodle shop from Yuji Ramen</a> and other treats from artisanal producers from the borough.</p>
