<p>A new supper club launching this week aims to highlight the diverse and delicious dining landscape of Queens, beginning with a family-style meal devoted to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160913200325/http://newyork.seriouseats.com/2012/05/tangra-masalas-indian-chinese-cuisine-review.html">fusion of Indian and Chinese cuisines</a>. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160913200325/http://chopsticksandmarrow.com/">Joe DiStefano</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160913200325/http://jonathanforgash.com/">Jonathan Forgash</a>&#x2014;both champions of the borough&#x2014;begin the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160913200325/https://www.facebook.com/queensdinnerclub/">Queens Dinner Club</a> on Thursday at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160913200325/http://www.tangrafusionnyc.com/">Tangra Masala</a>, a Sunnyside restaurant operated by Calcutta-born Chef Peter Lo. Lo will be preparing a multi-course meal at his restaurant, a former Romanian steakhouse that still bears the golden columns and gilded disco decor of its previous life.</p>

<p>&quot;What made Chef Lo an ideal starting point is that he reflects the diversity of Queens itself in his cooking. Also Indian-Chinese is not a cuisine everybody&apos;s tried so we wanted to introduce people to it,&quot; DiStefano explains. &quot;Back when he opened his restaurant most of his customers were Indian. These days his wait staff and a good portion of his customers are Nepalese because they also have an affinity for the spicy flavors of one of the world&apos;s true fusion cuisines.&quot;</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="041216tangra2.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160913200325im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_nellcasey/041216tangra2.jpeg" width="640" height="480"> <br> <i> Lollypop Chicken (via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160913200325/http://www.yelp.com/biz/tangra-masala-elmhurst-2?search_key=19454">Yelp</a>)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>Lo&apos;s plan for the evening will be to serve some classic Indian-Chinese dishes like the Chili Chicken&#x2014;dry-fried with onions and spices&#x2014;and one of the chef&apos;s interpretations of a chow mein, here a Singapore-style with curry. Other highlights include the restaurant&apos;s popular Lollypop Chicken, seen above, as well as Tangra Masala Fish Finger, Beef Tangra Style and Fish with Hot Garlic Sauce. </p>

<p>DiStefano and Forgash are making the Queens Dinner Club a monthly event, held at either restaurants or &quot;unique venues&quot; throughout the borough. DiStefano wouldn&apos;t give out specifics just yet, but says that &quot;Georgian, brews and BBQ&quot; are on the horizon, as well as &quot;several top secret unusual venues.&quot; Tickets for the Indian-Chinese Fusion Feast are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160913200325/http://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/2531421">$40 for 10 dishes</a> including soft drinks (no alcohol). </p>
