<p>Another <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408141630/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/19/photos_visiting_sheepshead_bays_boa.php#photo-1">nautical dining experience</a> makes its maiden voyage this evening with the launch of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408141630/http://thewatertablenyc.com/">The Water Table</a>, a floating restaurant aboard a former US Navy boat. We&apos;ve been eagerly awaiting the launch of the new on-the-sea eatery and tonight they&apos;re offering their first preview with a beer and cheese cruise sail tonight around the NY Harbor.</p>

<p>Brooklyn Brewery&apos;s beer master <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408141630/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/12/garrett_oliver.php">Garrett Oliver</a> brings aboard a selection of five brews including some not readily available to the average beer drinker. In addition, Stinky BKLYN provides a selection of New England cheese, befitting the ship&apos;s recent history as a Boston Harbor tour boat and, before that, a passenger ferry between islands near Boothbay Harbor. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408141630/https://www.eventbrite.com/event/8287773955">Online tickets are $50</a> and are only on sale until 5 p.m., so jump on that ASAP. Boarding begins at 6:30 p.m. and the cruise launches at 7 p.m.</p>

<p>On Friday, The Water Table launches its second preview, this time with eats by Executive Chef Drake Aldrich, who offers a seafood and vegetable-focused menu full of New England flavors. Everyone gets a gratis drink when they first board the ship with a cash bar of beers like Allagash and Naragansett and wines from Beaujolais and Veneto. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408141630/https://www.eventbrite.com/event/8387684791">Tickets run $45</a> and are available online until Friday. The cruise runs from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m.</p>

<p>Both cruises launch from the India St. Pier in Greenpoint in the same area as the East River Ferry. </p>
