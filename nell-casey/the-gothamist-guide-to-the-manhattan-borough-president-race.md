<p>The title of president may imply a certain kind of cachet, but borough presidents actually wield very little real power within the city government. Instead, the office acts as an advisor to the Mayor, the City Council and other government groups that do have the power to make big changes to the city. But don&apos;t discount their influence, as someone like current MBP Scott Stringer, who has been in office since 2006, has managed to bring about policy shifts on a variety of issues&#x2014;including bike lanes&#x2014;that have had a significant impact on life in the borough. </p>

<p>When it comes to Manhattan, land use represents the biggest job of the office, as the Beep reviews all land use and zoning projects and offers recommendations to the mayor as to whether a project should receive the green light. In a place like Manhattan, where real estate ventures can mean big bucks, the Beep seeks to protect the borough from special interest groups who may not have the community&apos;s best interests at heart. </p>

<p>Second to that, the MBP gets a portion of the city budget to spend as they see fit. Last year, the office received approximately $20 million to spend in Manhattan, which went to places like the Boys and Girls club of Harlem and other educational institutions in the borough. Finally, the office has oversight of city services like maintaining parks and streets and also appoints members of certain city agencies, covering topics like health and education.</p>

New York City Campaign Finance Board records indicate that, to date, Julie Menin leads in campaign funds with $1,031,347.49 followed by Jessica Lappin at $757,024.01, with Robert Jackson and Gale Brewer trailing with $415,069.38 and $342,431.50 respectively. That more or less mirrors a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430033930/http://gomyd.com/2013/07/31/the-young-democrats-straw-poll/">recent straw poll</a> from Manhattan Young Democrats, which shows Menin leading with 52% from likely voters and Brewer (22%), Lappin (15%) and Jackson (12%) more or less tied for the remaining votes. </p>

<p>Each candidate has a few big names throwing support in their direction. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430033930/http://juliemenin.com/supporters/">Julie Menin</a> counts council members Ydanis Rodriguez, Margaret Chin and Melissa Mark-Viverito as supporters, in addition to an endorsement from late mayor Ed Koch. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430033930/http://www.galebrewer.com/endorsements">Gale Brewer</a> has Gloria Steinem, Former Manhattan Borough President Ruth Messinger and Assemblymember Dick Gottfried in her corner.
