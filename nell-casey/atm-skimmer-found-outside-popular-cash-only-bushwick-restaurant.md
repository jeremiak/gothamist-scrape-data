<p>The NYPD is searching for two suspects they believe installed an ATM skimming device outside a popular Bushwick restaurant. At the end of November 2015, a skimming device was discovered at an ATM attached to Momo Sushi Shack&#x2014;and sister restaurant Moku Moku&#x2014;at 43 Bogart Street in the 90th precinct. It&apos;s an ideal area for crooks, as both establishments are cash only.</p>

<p>Cops released images and surveillance video below of the male and female suspects they say made withdrawals at Brooklyn ATMs using cards duplicated by the skimming device. </p>

<p>Experts say to look for &quot;fixtures that appear impermanent or imperfect, particularly in the vicinity of where you dip your card&quot; as possible evidence of a skimming advice. You should also get in the habit of holding one hand directly above the keypad as you type in your PIN, to thwart any cameras that might be documenting it. Freestanding ATMs are particularly vulnerable, but skimmers have also been discovered <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160605054327/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/17/trio_of_atm_skimmers_accused_of_ste.php">in bank vestibules</a>.</p>
