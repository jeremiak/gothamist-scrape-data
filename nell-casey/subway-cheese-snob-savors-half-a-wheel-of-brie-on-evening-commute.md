<p>Who cut the cheese on the N train last night? This guy. With his bare hands. Tipster <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509000303/https://twitter.com/jimgh141/status/388429734365130752">Jim from Brooklyn</a> alerted us to this cheesy character, explaining in gruesome detail how this gentleman enjoyed his banquet of Brie during the rush hour commute:</p>

<blockquote>Homeboy was seriously enjoying a half wheel of what must have been a severely aged Brie with crackers. He&apos;d dig his gross fingers into the Brie, dig out a piece, slap on a cracker and throw it down. The Brie was highly fragrant and most straphangers were appalled. He also licked his fingers after each bite (perhaps my biggest pet peeve/gross out move). He got off at Atlantic/Barclay, boarded the R and left the subway at Union St. Clearly Park Slope&apos;s finest. <strong>It gave me the chills to watch his saliva soaked fingers dive repeatedly into that ripe cheese.</strong></blockquote>

<p>Jim goes on to say this gentlemen took up <em>two seats</em> during prime time underground. This is not <em>France</em>, sir, this is the subway. There are <em><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509000303/http://gothamist.com/tags/subwayetiquette">RULES</a></em>.</p>

<p>Truthfully, any cheesehead will tell you that proper cheese temperature makes all the difference when enjoying some of the world&apos;s more fragrant varieties. A Reblochon straight from the fridge lacks the supple creaminess and delicate salinity those farmers in the Alps intended it to; likewise, a Colby left out to sit too long can begin to sweat like a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509000303/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/20/photo_workin_out_on_the_subway_brah.php">bro getting&apos; swole on the M train</a>. </p>

<p>Clearly this is a cheese hound in the know&#x2014;is that the <em>Times</em> dining section he&apos;s also eagerly devouring?&#x2014;and he wasn&apos;t going to let a little thing like proximity to hundreds of other souls in a tiny steel box get in the way of his perfectly ripe after work snack. Someone <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509000303/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/08/photo_this_woman_is_all_of_us.php">get this man a beer</a>.</p>

<p>It&apos;s difficult not to heed to call of the hankering:</p>
