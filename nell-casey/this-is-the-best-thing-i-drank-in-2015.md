<p>Frankly, I find the endless parade of cocktail bars and hushed mixology dens exhausting. Give me a dark hovel&#x2014;preferably with a glowering, red-faced septuagenarian holding court at the bar&#x2014;and a glass of Evan Williams on the rocks and I&apos;ll sit contentedly for hours. My bias against cocktails was changed, however, after visiting <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529164447/http://www.upandupnyc.com/">The Up &amp; Up</a>, a subterranean charmer nestled between hookah lounges, cookie chains, tattoo parlors and fratty bars on MacDougal Street. It was there that I drank The Hailstone, the cocktail that won me over.</p>

<p>The rye base caught my attention, as did the addition of cream, as I&apos;ll jump at any chance to guild the lily. At its heart, the drink channels a melted creamsicle, with the addition of orange juice and orange flower. A touch of mace&#x2014;a cousin of nutmeg&#x2014;adds warmth and roundness to the drink. It&apos;s $14 worth of delicious I&apos;ll happily consume again.</p>

<p>It should also be noted that the atmosphere of the bar increases the enjoyment of the drinks themselves. Patrons are seated by a host, who prevents overcrowding, and the atmosphere is quiet enough to carry on a conversation but not church-like. It&apos;s a grown-up bar in college town and if it lasts long enough, maybe I&apos;ll be the septuagenarian glaring at NYU kids in the corner. </p>
