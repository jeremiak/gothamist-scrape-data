title: 9 Delicious Dishes To Try At The Great GoogaMooga 
---

	
										<p><em>Tomorrow begins the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406141011/http://gothamist.com/tags/greatgoogamooga">Great GoogaMooga Festival</a> and while we&apos;re definitely psyched for the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406141011/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/26/googamooga_returns_with_yeah_yeahs.php">solid music lineup</a>, we&apos;re equally intrigued by the killer roster of restaurants which will be vending throughout the weekend. Organizers have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406141011/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/16/googamooga.php">promised an improvement</a> over last year&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406141011/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/21/was_extra_mooga_worth_250.php">dining desert debacle</a>, and while vegetarians <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406141011/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/02/here_are_all_of_the_vegetarian_opti.php">might not be fully placated</a>, there are still some tasty eats to be had.</em></p>

<p><em>With <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406141011/http://brooklyn-lineup.googamooga.com/?sort=Food">85 restaurants</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406141011/http://brooklyn.googamooga.com/drink/beer/">75 beers and ciders</a>, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406141011/http://brooklyn.googamooga.com/wine/">100 wines</a> on hand, hopefully there will be enough food and drink to go around. Prices are higher than your average food truck fare&#x2014;especially when a single glass of beer or wine will run you $8 to $15&#x2014;but it&apos;s not like you have another option, so hit your bank&apos;s ATM before you head to the park (if last year is any indication, ATM fees will likely be Strip Club Caliber) and remember that rent isn&apos;t due for another two weeks. </em></p>

<p><em>Below, a few standouts we&apos;ll be queuing up for this weekend.</em></p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="051613umami.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406141011im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_nellcasey/051613umami.jpg" width="640" height="480"> <br> <i> <span class="photo_caption">Truffle Burger (via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406141011/https://www.facebook.com/Umamiburger">Umami Burger</a> on Facebook</span></i></div> <p></p>

<p>We&apos;ve been eagerly awaiting California transplant <strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406141011/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/24/californias_popular_umami_burger_co.php">Umami Burger&apos;s</a></strong> first tri-state location since they announced their move last fall. Experience what the fuss is all about with the Truffle Burger ($10), their signature patty topped with house-made truffle cheese and a truffle glaze on a slightly sweet bun.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406141011/http://gothamist.com/2008/10/19/and_the_2008_vendy_award_goes_tocal.php#photo-1">Vendy-award winning</a> food cart <strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406141011/http://www.calexico.net/">Calexico</a></strong> is bringing a veggie-friendly quesadilla ($11) with roasted mushroom, goat cheese, sweet corn and huitlacoche. While huitlacoche&#x2014;a kind of freaky-looking fungus that grows on corn&#x2014;may turn some people off, we promise the rich, earthy flavor transcends its strange origin.</p>

<p><em>Top Chef</em> alum Leah Cohen&apos;s Lower East Side hotspot <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406141011/http://pigandkhao.com/">Pig and Khao</a> has been drawing praise from both critics and foodies since it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406141011/http://gothamist.com/2012/09/25/southeast_asian_spot_pig_khao_now_o.php">opened last September</a>. Cohen&#x2014;who partnered with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406141011/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/10/photos_fatty_cue_reopens_in_william.php">the Fatty Crew</a> set on her restaurant&#x2014;will be serving up her version of Baby Back Ribs ($10): pork spare ribs with an Asian BBQ sauce and coleslaw. </p>

<p>April Bloomfield&apos;s new homage to Mexican cuisine <strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406141011/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/12/salvation_taco.php#photo-1">Salvation Taco</a></strong> opened last year, offering a selection of tacos and tortas, plus large format offerings like a whole roasted pig&apos;s head. You won&apos;t get the full porcine dome this weekend, but you can get another piggy bite with the Tacos al Pastor ($10) with cochinito, roasted pineapple, and avocado salsa. </p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="051613bacon.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406141011im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_nellcasey/051613bacon.jpg" width="640" height="427"> <br> <i> <span class="photo_caption">Bacon.

<p>There will be no shortage of pork this weekend and pop-up pig purveyor <strong>BaconLand</strong> is offering &quot;Bacon Flights&quot; for the &quot;ultimate bacon tasting.&quot; $12 gets you samples of the best selections of cured and smoked pork belly from across the country. Just look for the gigantic, 22-foot steel pig named Henri to locate the &quot;Hamageddon&quot; section, where other pork-centric dishes will being cooked in Henri&apos;s fiery belly. </p>

<p>Carroll Gardens&apos; Southern-style restaurant <strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406141011/http://seersuckerbrooklyn.com/">Seersucker</a></strong> channels a bit of the Middle East with their festival offering. Black Eyed Peas will be transformed into Falafel ($10) with New York Argyle handmade yogurt and benne (sesame) seeds. Besides plain pizza and mac and cheese, this is one of the bulkier <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406141011/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/02/here_are_all_of_the_vegetarian_opti.php">vegetarian items</a> on hand and it probably won&apos;t weigh you down like the (delicious) carbs would.</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="051613lobsterpound.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406141011im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_nellcasey/051613lobsterpound.jpg" width="640" height="427"> <br> <i> <span class="photo_caption">Red Hook Lobster Pound (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406141011/http://www.flickr.com/photos/wallyg/5903164867/">wallyg</a>/Flickr)</span></i></div> <p></p>

<p>Sometimes you just crave a gosh darn lobster roll, and the tender, paprika-flecked monstrosity from <strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406141011/http://redhooklobster.com/">Red Hook Lobster Pound</a></strong> is one of the best around. The Crustacean Elation Maine Lobster Roll ($16) packs a gut-busting 1/4 pound of tender lobster meat into a buttery, griddled, split-top bun. Yes, it&apos;s on the pricier side, but remember: you&apos;re paying to taste the ocean.</p>

<p>If you <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406141011/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/15/photos_arrested_development_banana.php#photo-1">missed the pop-up Banana Stand</a> this week, redeem yourself with <strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406141011/http://brooklyn-lineup.googamooga.com/band/motorboat-and-the-big-banana">The Big Banana&apos;s</a></strong> version. The frozen fruit is dipped in dark chocolate then coated with peanuts, sea salt and toasted coconut. At a respectable $4 per banana, it&apos;s a relatively inexpensive yet filling dessert for a warm day at the park.</p>

<p>Besides the individual food stalls, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406141011/http://brooklyn.googamooga.com/pop-ups/">Pop-Up Restaurants</a> are offering a more inclusive experience at set reservations times on Saturday and Sunday, with DJs and other <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406141011/http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=Y5kwuA-8no8">zany amusements</a> while you drink and dine. Gnaw meat and veggies on a stick from Roberta&apos;s Urban Ren Faire; feast on beer and seafood at Gabe Stulman&apos;s Little Wisco Seafood Boil &amp; BBQ; or essen das sausage at April Bloomfield and Ken Friedman&apos;s The Spotted Pig Haus. Tickets to each pop-up are between $15 and 20, and as long as you <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406141011/http://brooklyn.googamooga.com/pop-ups/">make a reservation in advance</a> you&apos;re guaranteed a seat at the party. </p>
