<p>Legendary Harlem jazz bar Lenox Lounge has found a new home just two blocks from its original location on Lenox Avenue. The famed venue <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160123015045/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/06/harlems_lenox_lounge_is_closing.php">shuttered in 2012</a> with owner Alvin Reed vowing to reopen if he could get the funds to do so. He did, thanks in part to new business partner Dean Schomburg, and the duo will <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160123015045/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/uptown/new-day-lenox-lounge-article-1.1621947">reopen the bar</a> in a 1,200 square foot space at 333 Lenox Avenue at some point in late summer.</p>

<p>Plans for the design include similar Art Deco-stylings as the original, with fixtures like the bar and the iconic neon sign being transplanted in the new space. The Zebra Room will also be recreated with an additional skylight part of the new design. Reed is currently embroiled in a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160123015045/http://nypost.com/2013/02/15/former-operators-hired-thugs-gutted-historic-lenox-lounge-lawsuit/">multimillion dollar lawsuit</a> with the club&apos;s former landlord for allegedly stripping fixtures from the bar after he was ousted. Construction on the new space commences in April with a four-to-six month timeline for completion.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, plans for the original space are moving forward with Notar Jazz Club, run by new lease holder Richard Notar. New eatery and jazz venue Minton&apos;s also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160123015045/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/26/mintons.php#photo-1">opened nearby</a>, creating a nice hub of venues returning to the neighborhood. </p>
