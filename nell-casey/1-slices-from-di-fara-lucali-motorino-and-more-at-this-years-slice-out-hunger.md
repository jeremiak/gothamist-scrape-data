<p>What started as a small anniversary party for a homegrown food tour company has turned into a giant fundraising pizza party that draws crowds eager to nosh on $1 slices from the city&apos;s best pizzerias. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151009231829/http://sliceouthunger.org/">Slice Out Hunger</a>, now celebrating its 5th year, offers an opportunity to nab slices from pie-only establishments like DiFara, Forcella and Rubirosa, all while benefiting <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151009231829/http://www.foodbanknyc.org/">Food Bank For NYC</a>. </p>

<p>Founding company <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151009231829/http://www.scottspizzatours.com/">Scott&apos;s Pizza Tours</a>, run by pizza addict Scott Wiener, brings together big names in the pizza industry for the annual event on October 9th, including <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151009231829/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/18/the_best_pizza_in_nyc.php">Gothamist favorites</a> like Motorino and Lucali, plus <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151009231829/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/13/hot_dogs_and_french_fries_top_new_p.php">Ribalta</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151009231829/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/18/we_made_our_own_pizza_at_forcella_a.php">Forcella</a> and Rubirosa, which all sell their signature slices for just a buck.</p>

<p>Eaters purchase $1 tickets at the door, which then get traded in for a slice, Fizzy Izzy soda, Brewla Bar brewed ice pops or a raffle ticket. For every dollar spent, Food Bank For NYC is able to produce five meals for people in need; matching donations from Scott&apos;s, Brooklyn Flea and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151009231829/http://sliceouthunger.org/">other sponsors</a> ensure a hefty haul for the deserving organization. </p>

<p>Doors open at St. Anthony&apos;s Church on Sullivan Street at 6 p.m. but expect the line to start forming way before that. Unless you&apos;d like to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151009231829/https://secure.squarespace.com/commerce/donate?donatePageId=520a682ee4b0cc1763c9a42a">make a $100 donation</a>, no advance tickets will be sold, so arrive early for your best shot at scoring the most popular pies. </p>
