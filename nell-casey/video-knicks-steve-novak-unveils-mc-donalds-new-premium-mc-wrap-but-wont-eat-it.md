</div></div>					<p>While customers in other parts of the world are getting cool-looking <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507233759/http://gothamist.com/2012/09/12/mcdonalds_china_introduces_bw_burge.php">black and white</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507233759/http://gothamist.com/2012/11/30/mcdonalds_bagel_burgers_debut_in_fr.php">bagel</a> burgers, McDonald&apos;s lovers in the TriState area were introduced today to the three new &quot;Premium Wraps&quot; from the Golden Arches. The three varieties&#x2014;Sweet Chili Chicken, Chicken &amp; Bacon, Chicken &amp; Ranch&#x2014;are basically different combinations of chicken strips, cheese, lettuce, tomato and cucumber, each with its own special sauce. And if you&apos;re thinking, &quot;Aren&apos;t these kind of the same thing as those other McDonalds wraps they&apos;ve had for a few years?&quot; The answer is yes, except these ones are <em>bigger</em>, which means they&apos;re automatically better in the eyes of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507233759/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/03/fatties_dont_want_healthy_food_dont.php">discerning American consumers</a>.</p>

<p>Knicks Forward/<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507233759/https://twitter.com/nellcasey/status/317319929353355264">My New Best Friend</a> Steve Novak was on hand for the media unveiling this afternoon. Novak&#x2014;whom I must say is an extremely nice, friendly dude and <em>Heyyyy what&apos;s up Steve, call me anytime!</em>&#x2014;got down and dirty with the ingredients, making his own wrap for the enraptured photogs. But not even Novak could bring himself to ingest the creation: he didn&apos;t take a single bite.</p>

<p><iframe src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507233759if_/http://player.vimeo.com/video/62897398?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>Without the luxury of benching my taste buds, I sampled two of the new offerings. First up, the Sweet Chili Chicken flavor, where I opted for the healthier (HA) grilled chicken option. Things started out all right, with an appropriately soft flour tortilla and a faint garlic smell wafting from the lukewarm wrap; but it quickly turned downhill when I bit into stringy, rubbery chicken. As in, so rubbery that I had to grasp the chicken with my fingers so I could break off a bite. It was then that I noticed the slightly grey tint to the meat and&#x2026;yeah that was enough of that. </p>

<p>Next up, Chicken &amp; Bacon, this time with the heart attack-inducing crispy chicken option. This combination fared better&#x2014;I could bite through the chicken at least, so there&apos;s that. Even though the tomato and lettuce were mostly flavorless, the bacon was appropriately smoke-flavored and the jack cheese offered a pleasingly gooey texture. There was no way in hell I could have finished the whole thing, and at a whopping 600 calories, 30 grams of fat, and 1420 milligrams of sodium I&apos;m sure my arteries were grateful for the reprieve. Yup, nothing but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507233759/http://gothamist.com/2012/09/20/you_will_no_longer_be_able_to_ignor.php">good-for-you organic burgers</a> from here on out. </p>
