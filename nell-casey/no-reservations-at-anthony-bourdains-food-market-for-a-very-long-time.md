<p>Anthony Bourdain can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021112936/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/30/bourdain_graphic_novel.php">create art</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021112936/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/17/video_anthony_bordain_facilitates_w.php">reunite beloved TV characters</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021112936/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/19/watch_anthony_bourdain_and_eric_rip.php">booze with the best of &apos;em</a> but he can&apos;t make production on his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021112936/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/09/bourdain_market.php">new international food market</a> go any faster. The market&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021112936/https://www.instagram.com/bourdainmarket/">social media</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021112936/http://www.bourdainmarket.com/">website</a> now indicate we won&apos;t be eating <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021112936/http://gothamist.com/2015/04/09/anthony_bourdain_runner.php">Blade-runner inspired</a> tacos until 2019, a full <em>two years</em> later than previously expected, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021112936/http://ny.eater.com/2016/6/23/12017582/bourdain-market-2019">noticed Eater</a>. That&apos;s a lot of time to kill <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021112936/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/12/anthony_bourdain_launches_instagram.php">on Instagram</a>.</p>

<p>When (if?) the market ever opens <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021112936/http://gothamist.com/2015/05/13/anthony_bourdain_market_pier_57.php">inside Pier 57</a> it&apos;ll be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021112936/http://gothamist.com/2014/03/25/heres_whats_inside_anthony_bourdain.php">quite a spectacle</a>, with a Singapore-style hawker market and other international vendors, which has been a &quot;big challenge&quot; for the team in securing things like visas, which could be part of the holdup. There&apos;s also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021112936/http://gothamist.com/2015/09/28/anthony_bourdain_new_market_details.php">going to be</a> a full-service restaurant, a &quot;wet market&quot; for breaking down whole animals, and entertainment like &quot;karaoke, Asian pop performances and films.&quot; Then, of course, there&apos;s the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021112936/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/04/behold_the_superpier.php">Super Pier itself</a>, which has yet to open.</p>

<p>While we&apos;re waiting, we can kill time by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021112936/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/07/bourdains_favorite_nyc_spots.php">dining at Bourdain&apos;s favorite NYC restaurants</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021112936/http://gothamist.com/2014/10/06/anthony_bourdain_bronx.php">hanging out in the Bronx</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021112936/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/06/video_the_big_gay_ice_cream_shop_op.php">eating a Salty Pimp</a>.</p>
