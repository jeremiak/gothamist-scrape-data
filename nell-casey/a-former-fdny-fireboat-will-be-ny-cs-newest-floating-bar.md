<p>A fireboat that doused flames in New York City&apos;s waterways since the &apos;60s will be transformed into a floating restaurant next summer by the proprietors of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161014182950/http://www.grandbanks.org/">Grand Banks</a>, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161014182950/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/25/boat_dining_drinking_2016.php">oyster and cocktail bar</a> aboard the historical F/V Sherman Zwicker schooner, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161014182950/http://ny.eater.com/2016/10/10/13225872/the-governor-boat-restaurant">Eater reports</a>. Brothers Miles and Alex Pincus, along with Adrien Gallo, purchased the Fireboat Governor Alfred E. Smith earlier this month via the NYC Citywide Administrative Services, which routinely <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161014182950/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/20/buy_this_fireboat.php">auctions off decommissioned FDNY boats</a> in addition to other city-owned properties and goods. </p>

<p>According to public records, Gallo won the auction for &quot;The Governor,&quot; as they&apos;re now calling it, on October 3rd, paying $34,800 for the boat &quot;as is&quot;/&quot;where is.&quot; She&apos;s been sitting tight in the Brooklyn Navy since being placed on reserve over a decade ago, though was still fully functional when last used about a year ago. When sold, the 97-foot boat was deemed in &quot;fair condition&quot; but also &quot;recently completed a &apos;stem to stern&apos; restoration, is in museum quality condition.&quot; </p>

<p>Take a tour around the boat <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161014182950/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ph-1VYrtjG8">with this video</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161014182950/http://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/1230.html">Alfred E. Smith</a>, a four time Governor of New York and onetime democratic nominee for President in 1928, was a staunch opponent of Prohibition, which was a contributing factor in his terrible loss to Herbert Hoover, who even won (narrowly) in New York State. He would likely approve of his new life helping New Yorkers get a load on.</p>

<p>With a few seasons to go before The Governor&apos;s ready to accept passengers, there still aren&apos;t many details about the kind of operation they&apos;ll have on board, though Grand Banks is known for oysters, small plates and drinks. And though the boat&apos;s capable of hitting 11 knots, one thing&apos;s certain: her days of prowling the waterways of New York City are behind her. Unlike spots like The Water Table, which take diners on a little cruise, she&apos;ll be docked for service just like her sister. </p>
