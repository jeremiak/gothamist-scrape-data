<p>The SoHo location of Japanese clubstaurant <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170427220935/http://www.koirestaurant.com/new_york-soho/galleries/1/#10">Koi</a> will close this summer because of a sharp decline in business&#x2014;a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170427220935/http://gothamist.com/2016/12/28/rip_bars_restaurants_2016.php">sadly common occurance</a> in a competitive city such as ours&#x2014;only this restaurant is located inside the Trump SoHo hotel on Spring Street. Coincidence? The people who work there don&apos;t think so.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170427220935/http://www.grubstreet.com/2017/04/trump-soho-koi-closing.html">report by Grub Street</a>, the restaurant&apos;s management and employees say they see a direct correlation between financial woes and the election of President Trump last November. &quot;Obviously, the restaurant is closing because business is down,&quot; Koi Group&apos;s general counsel told the website. &quot;I would prefer not to speculate as to why, but obviously since the election it&apos;s gone down.&quot;</p>

<p>Employees say business had been robust since the restaurant <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170427220935/https://www.usatoday.com/story/hotelcheckin/2012/10/19/trump-soho-koi/1644879/">opened in 2012</a>, regularly attracting a celebrity clientele including the Kardashians, who&apos;ve allegedly &quot;stopped coming.&quot; Imagine the Kardashians aren&apos;t rolling up in your spot anymore...and it&apos;s a bad thing? Yikes. One busser/host also told Grub Street that non-celebrity regulars at the restaurant said definitively that &quot;if [Trump] wins, we are not coming here anymore.&quot; </p>

<p>Many staffers&#x2014;including long-time worker Ricardo Aca&#x2014;have already abandoned the sinking ship, and the restaurant is slated to close mid-June&#x2014;but employees are quoted as saying they think it&apos;ll be &quot;sooner.&quot; </p>

<p>This isn&apos;t the first time Aca has been publicly associated with his (now former) place of employment. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170427220935/http://gothamist.com/2015/08/20/trump_koi_soho_worker.php">During the election he was featured</a> in a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170427220935/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-r9E5n5FnM">video</a> about his experiences as a Mexican immigrant working in a Trump building. &quot;I know I could lose my job just for talking about Trump, but it doesn&apos;t make me proud to go to work everyday under his name,&quot; he said.</p>

<p>Asked about Aca&apos;s statements at the time, then-candidate Trump <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170427220935/https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/20/nyregion/in-video-immigrant-worker-at-trump-hotel-criticizes-donald-trumps-views.html?smprod=nytcore-iphone&amp;smid=nytcore-iphone-share">told the NY Times</a>, &quot;We thought he was an illegal immigrant at first.&quot; Trump also promised he would not pressure Koi Soho to punish Aca, but added, &quot;I want to check his file.&quot;</p>
