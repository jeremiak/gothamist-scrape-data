<p>Last week, Michelin released their list of restaurants that received their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170917194122/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/11/michelin_bib_gourmand_2016.php">Bib Gourmand distinction</a>; now they&apos;ve released their Michelin Guide New York, which includes the tire company&apos;s noted red star distinctions. For its 12th edition, the widely-respected guide has awarded 77 restaurants between one and three stars, 13 of which earned (or re-earned, in one case) their first stars for this year.</p>

<p>The three star awardees are identical to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170917194122/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/01/2016_michelin_winners.php">last year&apos;s list</a>, which might come as a surprise considering the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170917194122/http://ny.eater.com/2014/12/4/7310871/per-se-review-thomas-keller">recent critique</a> of Thomas Keller&apos;s Per Se, which was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170917194122/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/12/per_nay_jose.php">colorfully demoted</a> by the NY Times earlier this year. It retains its status along with Chef&apos;s Table at Brooklyn Fare, Eleven Madison Park, Jean-Georges, Le Bernardin and Masa. </p>

<p>Chef Fredrik Berselius had earned one star in his restaurant Aska&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170917194122/http://gothamist.com/2012/11/30/inside_williamsburgs_aska_a_modern.php#photo-1">previous iteration</a> in Williamsburg, but Berselius&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170917194122/http://gothamist.com/2016/08/30/fredrik_berselius_aska.php#photo-1">revamp on the south side</a> has earned the chef two stars in this year&apos;s guide. Aska&apos;s the only new edition to the two star club, joining restaurants including Daniel, Blanca, The Modern and Ko in the category.</p>

<p>New one star ratings were most plentifully doled out this year. Batali scored with his new spot La Sirena, as did relative newcomers G&#xFC;nter Seeger NY, Nix, Sushi Zo, L&apos;Appart, Sushi Ginza Onodera, Sushi Inoue, and Agern, joined by Contra, Kanonyama, Ushiwakamaru, and Faro in Brooklyn. </p>
