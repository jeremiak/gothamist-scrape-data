<p>We&apos;re more of a slice town, it&apos;s true, but if you&apos;re ever in a position to buy an entire pizza pie, here&apos;s some helpful advice: always buy the bigger one. That statement, in and of itself, seems obvious; more pizza = better. But the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151030011046/http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2014/02/26/282132576/74-476-reasons-you-should-always-get-the-bigger-pizza">good folks at NPR</a> have another excellently-reasoned argument for why bigger is better, namely that when it comes to ordering an entire pizza, the bigger the pie, the cheaper the cost. Kind of. Let&apos;s go to the tape:</p>

<p>It all has to do with circles and the kind of math you forgot from high school. Because the area of a circle increases with the square of the radius, a 16-inch pizza is actually four times larger than an 8-inch pizza, not double. Using data from 3,678 pizza places across the U.S., NPR analyzed the cost of pies versus the area of the pies and realized that pizza prices weren&apos;t increasing proportionally to the size of the pie. </p>

<p>For example, a 16&quot; pizza equals roughly 1.3 14&quot; pizzas or four 8&quot; pizzas. On average, consumers spend $16.59 for a 16&quot; pie; to get the same amount of pizza, they&apos;d have to spend $18.94 on 1.2 14&quot; pizzas or $33 on four 8&quot; pizzas.</p>

<p>If your head is spinning from all the numbers, just <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151030011046/http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2014/02/26/282132576/74-476-reasons-you-should-always-get-the-bigger-pizza">check out this handy graph</a> that visualizes price per square inch as it compares to pizza diameter. Bottom line: bigger is always better, unless you&apos;re talking <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151030011046/http://gothamist.com/2014/02/09/wondering_why_your_con_ed_bill_is_s.php">utility bills</a>.</p>
