<p>Governor of New York and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150310065924/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/25/andrew-cuomo-sexy_n_4338604.html?ncid=edlinkusaolp00000003">generally sexy dude</a> Andrew Cuomo has come to the rescue of New Yorkers struggling to put food on the table this holiday. The Governor announced that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150310065924/http://www.governor.ny.gov/press/11252013-emergency-food-assistance-grants">$4.5 million in grants</a> will be given to 2,600 food banks and pantries throughout the state, providing roughly 2.8 million meals. &#x201C;These state grants are aimed at filling the gap caused by the recent cuts in federal SNAP benefits and provide a boost to vital food assistance programs, to help provide relief to impacted New Yorkers,&quot; the Governor said in a statement while batting his heavy eyelashes and tightening his chiseled abs. </p>

<p>Beginning in November, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150310065924/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/21/food_stamp_cuts.php">reduced for millions of Americans</a> when the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act law expired. Additionally, the House of Representatives recently voted to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150310065924/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/20/house_of_representatives_vote_to_sl.php">cut the SNAP budget</a> by $4 billion annually over the next decade, leaving more people to struggle to put food on the table.</p>

<p>According to SNAP data, federal cuts will total around $302 million for New Yorkers alone. Compared with the same time last year, 13% more emergency meals have been reported for 2013 and this year&apos;s grant money totals 15% more than State funding from last year. While the Federal government increases the onus on the State, the governor in turns asks that New Yorkers step up and help each other by volunteering time and making donations of money or food to a local shelter. The Governor has tapped <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150310065924/http://www.foodbanknyc.org/">Food Bank For New York City</a> as one local organization in need; stay tuned on Gothamist for a roundup of ways to volunteer time and goods this holiday season.</p>
