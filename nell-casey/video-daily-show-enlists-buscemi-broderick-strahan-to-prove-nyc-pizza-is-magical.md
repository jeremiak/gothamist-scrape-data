<p>Despite <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508155406/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/15/chicago_mayor_escalates_daily_show.php">fishy threats</a> from the Windy City, Jon Stewart continues to wage his brave war against <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508155406/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/14/jon_stewart_pizza_chicago.php">Chicago deep dish pizza</a>. But he&apos;s no longer fighting the good fight alone. Last night, the <em>Daily Show</em> released their latest volley, a celeb-studded tribute to NYC pizza and its &quot;magical&quot; properties. According to Stewart and co., a slice of John&apos;s can cure a broken leg, while Luigi&apos;s pies make for easy and delicious transportation.</p>

<p>Watch Steve Buscemi, Matthew Broderick and Michael Strahan declare their devotion, with appearances from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508155406/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/18/the_best_pizza_in_nyc.php">top pie makers</a> like Di Fara, Lombardi&apos;s and Denino&apos;s. </p>

<p>Much of last night&apos;s show was pizza-themed, with an opening segment on the topic (which compared deep dish pizza to &quot;string cheese that had been baked for two hours inside Mike Ditka&apos;s ass&quot;), followed by a moving truce with Marc Malnati, owner of well-regarded Chicago pizzeria Lou Malnati&apos;s.</p>
