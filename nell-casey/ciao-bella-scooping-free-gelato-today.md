<p>In celebration of its 30 years of creamy, icy goodness, Ciao Bella is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501172201/http://ciaobella30.com/">throwing a big party</a> and giving away gratis scoops of their frosty delights. Starting at 2 p.m. today, they&apos;re taking over the back yard of The Old School on Mott Street, filling it with live music and lots and lots of gelato.</p>

<p>The fun goes until 10 p.m., which is great news for those of us stuck inside the office on this gorgeous day. They haven&apos;t revealed which flavors they&apos;ll be offering, but does it really matter? Free gelato!</p>
