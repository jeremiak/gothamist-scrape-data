<p>Keizo Shiamoto has been keeping very busy since the launch of his popular <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405190528/http://gothamist.com/tags/ramenburger">Ramen Burger</a> just over two months ago, appearing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405190528/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/10/watch_out_cronut_smorgasburg_sees_l.php">regularly at Smorgasburg</a>, headlining <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405190528/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/18/joy_of_sake.php">tasting events</a> and even taking the show <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405190528/http://laist.com/2013/09/09/video_crazy_long_line_to_try_the_ra.php">on the road to Los Angeles</a>. Now he&apos;s tackling the big screen with a new movie about his bodacious burgers, titled <em>Biting Into The Ramen Burger.</em></p><em>

<p>Shiamoto <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405190528/http://www.goramen.com/2013/10/trailer-biting-into-ramen-burger.html">broke the news on his blog</a> today, posting the trailer below and telling his many fans to &quot;stay tuned.&quot; </p>

<p>From the trailer, the film will chronicle the Ramen Burger&apos;s rise from curious food hybrid to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405190528/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/17/ramen_burger_watch_2013.php">epic lines</a> in Brooklyn and beyond. Shiamoto partners with production company <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405190528/http://www.editbeach.com/">Edit Beach</a> to bring his food porn to life. We reached out Shiamoto for more details and we&apos;ll update when we hear back. </p>
