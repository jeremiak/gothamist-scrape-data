<p>The ban on trans fats <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170420010214/http://gothamist.com/2008/07/01/trans_fat_is_history_in_new_york_ci.php">enacted in 2007</a> in New York City&apos;s restaurants frustrated <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170420010214/http://gothamist.com/2015/06/01/fda_trans_fat_ban_imminent.php">lovers of flaky biscuits</a>, but it may have also helped reduce heart attacks and strokes in counties that have also adopted the ban. When weighing a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170420010214/http://gothamist.com/2013/12/27/red_lobster_biscuits.php">love of Red Lobster</a> versus a love for your heart...okay, yeah, this is a tough one. But we&apos;ve <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170420010214/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/14/skip_the_hype_and_make_your_own_dam.php">got options</a>!</p>

<p>A new <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170420010214/http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamacardiology/article-abstract/2618359">study</a> released in the Journal of the American Medical Association links reduced consumption of trans fats found in things like frying oils to reduced instances of myocardial infarctions (heart attacks) and strokes reported in New York counties that enacted bans. The study, which took place from 2002 to 2013 in 11 New York Counties, looked at counties with trans fats bans in place, in addition to counties that did not. </p>

<p>Counties with trans fats bans showed a 6% decline in heart-related instances in the first three years, translating to 43 fewer heart attacks and strokes per 100,000 people. Hospital admissions data showed a decline in heart attacks and strokes across all counties in the study&#x2014;from 800 to 700 per 100,000 people&#x2014;but counties with trans fats bans saw more of a reduction.</p>

<p>Heart specialists at Tufts <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170420010214/https://apnews.com/a7dd01966bc04e91af690f1978033f63/Trans-fats-ban-linked-with-fewer-NY-heart-attacks-&amp;-strokes">told the AP</a> the reductions could also be tied to things including a ban on smoking and &quot;mandatory calories on menus.&quot; Um, that&apos;d be if they <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170420010214/http://gothamist.com/2015/11/04/numbers_are_theoretical_anyway.php">actually read those things</a>. </p>
