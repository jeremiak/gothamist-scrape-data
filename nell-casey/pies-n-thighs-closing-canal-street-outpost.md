title: Pies 'n' Thighs Closing Canal Street Outpost

<p>Alas, the Manhattan outpost of Williamsburg-born Pies &apos;n&apos; Thighs was not meant to be, and the restaurant will shut its doors after this weekend&apos;s service. Co-owner Carolyn Bane <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171024082118/http://ny.eater.com/2016/7/26/12286636/lower-east-side-pies-n-thighs-closing">tells Eater</a> that &quot;a true Pies is a great hang and we never quite achieved that in this spot.&quot; Blame the tourists. </p>

<p>The Canal Street location was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171024082118/http://gothamist.com/2015/01/15/pies_thighs_manhattan.php#photo-1">a bit more spacious</a> than its Brooklyn counterpart, though it served a very similar menu, anchored by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171024082118/http://gothamist.com/2015/03/26/best_fried_chicken_nyc.php">that dope fried chicken</a>. It&apos;s difficult to replicate vibes, though, as Bane seems to indicate here. If it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171024082118/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/14/pies_n_thighs_benches_innocent_rest.php">doesn&apos;t command a line</a>, how can you build that anticipation? </p>

<p>But those pies and thighs have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171024082118/http://gothamist.com/2008/01/15/pies_n_thighs_g.php">been through turmoil before</a> and emerged just as deep fried delicious as ever on the other side. Their now-permanent home on South 4th Street has been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171024082118/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/01/pies_n_thighs_reopens_in_new_souths.php#photo-1">going strong</a> for over six years. </p>
