</div></div>					<p>The Texification of New York City keeps right on rolling with new quick-service taco and burrito restaurant <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150107121554/http://trescarnes.com/">Tres Carnes</a>, which opened along a busy stretch of Sixth Avenue in the Flatiron last week. The restaurant&#x2014;which is reminiscent of another burrito joint named for a smoke-dried jalapeno&#x2014;combines Mexican fare with Texas-style barbecue, a cuisine executive chef Sasha Shor has dubbed &quot;Texican.&quot; Smoked brisket, chicken adobo and pork shoulder are paired with a variety of rices, beans and salsas and dispensed in your chosen form: burrito, taco or bowl. The joint has an additional bit of street cred in the kitchen: Pitmaster Mike Rodriguez worked at BBQ mecca The Salt Lick for nearly a decade.</p>

<p>A smoked brisket burrito ($8.73) with Mexican yellow rice, &quot;Charros&quot; Cowboy Pintos and Fire-Roasted Tomato Adobo salsa was mercifully smaller than some behemoth burritos on offer these days. The brisket was tender and well-seasoned; the rice and beans added heft without adding weight. The pork shoulder tacos ($8.04), which came with tart pickled onions, were tasty too but a little on the dry side for what is usually a fattier cut of meat. Given Rodriguez&apos;s experience, we&apos;ll give him an opening week pass to work out the kinks before passing judgement. The most successful side dish we tried was the Street-Cart Esquites ($4.59), an off-the-cob version of the popular Mexican street food. Tender niblets of sweet corn are mixed with smokey lime mayo and topped with cilantro, cotija and crema for a much less messy than the original snack. </p>

<p>No booze for now&#x2014;the liquor license is still a few weeks off&#x2014;but they&apos;ll offer a few interpretations of Michelada, including one with The Cock&apos;s Tail Bloody Mariachi and one with chipotle puree. Sadly they won&apos;t <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150107121554/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/11/shiner_beer_finally_coming_to_new_y.php">have Shiner</a> but they will have Lone Star and a Mexican beer on tap. In the meantime, sip on refreshing Cucumber-Apple-Lime agua fresca, fresh agave limeade or a variety of Mexican sodas.</p>
