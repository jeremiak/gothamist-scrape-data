<p>An animal rights group barged into a lobster boil party in Brooklyn yesterday, shouting, holding signs, climbing on tables and dousing one another in &quot;blood.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110092343/http://www.collectivelyfree.org/">Collectively Free</a>, the group behind yesterday&apos;s demonstration, crashed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110092343/https://www.eventbrite.com/e/the-great-brooklyn-lobster-boil-tickets-26349385722#">The Great Brooklyn Lobster Boil</a> at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110092343/http://industrycity.com/">The Landing at Industry City</a>&#x2014;a $60 per ticket event featuring lobsters cooked on-site&#x2014;calling out the event for &quot;speciesism&quot; and &quot;lobster torture.&quot; </p>

<p>Chanting &quot;Her whole life, your one meal, lobsters feel, lobsters feel&quot; and &quot;If you want to get some peace, let the lobster torture cease,&quot; over two dozen protestors acted out the moments of the lobster&apos;s death, screaming and, confusingly, pouring blood on each other. As security attempted to corral the group, one member climbed on a table where people were eating, eventually getting pulled down. It&apos;s unclear whether the person who pulled the protestor down was affiliated with Industry City or one of the many surprised, bib-clad patrons attending the event. </p>

<p>Officials from Industry City were not immediately available for comment.</p>

<p>&quot;We hope that by getting people to stop and think about what is actually going on and by pointing out that science tells us that lobsters&apos; bodies don&apos;t go into shock, we will plant a seed in their heads about how our choices affect animals,&quot; co-organizer Bobby McCullough said in a statement. </p>

<p>A recent study purported to prove that animals like lobsters, crabs and shrimp were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110092343/http://gothamist.com/2014/03/11/crabs_shrimp_lobsters_pain.php">capable of feeling pain</a>, an idea seized on by the activists. Outside the event, the group put on a performance action dubbed &quot;Swap Speciesism,&quot; where a lobster appears to boil a human alive in a pot. </p>

<p>Collectively Free has staged several high-profile actions recently, including a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110092343/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/28/animal_rights_st_patricks_easter.php">controversial protest at St. Patrick&apos;s Cathedral</a> and as part of a larger group <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110092343/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/04/bad_chicken_protesters_picket_outsi.php#photo-1">rallying outside of Chick-fil-A</a>. Last week, a different group <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110092343/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mhddbzndiio&amp;feature=youtu.be">staged a protest</a> outside the Madison Square Park Shake Shack, calling out animal suffering for human consumption. </p>

<p>In other news, the latest Radiolab episode basically proves that trees and fungus are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110092343/http://www.radiolab.org/story/from-tree-to-shining-tree/?.com">essentially carnivores</a>, so that&apos;s something to think about.</p>
