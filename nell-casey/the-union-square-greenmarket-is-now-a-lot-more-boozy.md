<p>Does <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170419070111/http://gothamist.com/2014/04/18/greenmarket_eggs.php#photo-6">buying eggs</a> when you&apos;re a little drunk make them taste better? The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170419070111/https://www.grownyc.org/greenmarket/manhattan-union-square-m">Union Square Greenmarket</a> wants us to find out, apparently, because they&apos;re bringing booze tastings to the market full time with the launch of their year-round &quot;Beer and Spirits of New York Pop-Up.&quot; </p>

<p>Each Saturday, the market will feature one brewery or distillery licensed as a New York State Farm Brewery or Distillery, meaning they must source a percentage of their ingredients from farms in the state. Producers will offer tastings to Greenmarket shoppers and also sell growlers and bottles of their hooch to take home.</p>

<p>Previously, the USQ Greenmarket has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170419070111/http://gothamist.com/2014/06/03/union_square_night_market.php">run successful beer gardens</a> during their occasional night markets. If this new permanent &quot;pop-up&quot; is successful, there are plans to replicate it at other greenmarkets throughout the city. </p>
