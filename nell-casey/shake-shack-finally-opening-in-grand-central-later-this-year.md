<p>After <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170310194840/http://gothamist.com/2011/07/20/shake_shack_surprise_burger_mecca_m.php">nearly two years of waiting</a>, Shake Shack will <em>finally</em> open in Grand Central Terminal later this year. Danny Meyer&apos;s burger empire had been fighting to occupy the space on the lower level after the previous tenant, Mexican restaurant Zocalo, refused to leave. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170310194840/http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20130508/RETAIL_APPAREL/130509893">Now Crains is reporting</a> that Zocalo has finally relinquished control of the prime location and plans can now move forward to bring concretes and &apos;Shroom Burgers to midtown.</p>

<p>Shake Shack officially took possession of the space on May 1st after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170310194840/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/21/grand_central_terminal_shake_shack.php">an ongoing struggle to claim their rights</a>. Zocalo had been contesting their eviction for years, arguing that because of Shake Shack&apos;s chain status they should not have been able to bid for the spot. The MTA disagreed and Zocalo filed for bankruptcy in October of last year and were given a court order to vacate earlier this spring. &quot;It&apos;s very sad,&quot; said owner Robert Shapiro.</p>

<p>The burger joint&apos;s 10-year lease will net the MTA $567,000 per year by the time the decade is up, in addition to 8% of gross sales. Does this mean Danny Meyer may single-handedly help avoid <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170310194840/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/28/everything_you_need_to_know_about_t_1.php">another fare hike</a>? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170310194840/http://gothamist.com/2012/11/28/breaking_down_the_mtas_5_billion_hu.php">Don&apos;t hold your breath</a>.</p>
