<p>Annual meat free celebration <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140424011406/http://nycvegfoodfest.com/">NYC Vegetarian Food Festival</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140424011406/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/27/5_things_we_want_to_eat_at_this_wee.php">returns for two days</a> at Manhattan&apos;s Metropolitan Pavilion. On March 1st and 2nd, restaurants, retailers and other exhibitors promote a vegetable-based lifestyle with samplings and demonstrations; think of it as a healthier alternative to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140424011406/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/29/choice_eats_2014.php">similar gorgefests</a> throughout the year.</p>

<p>Though anything sans-animal flesh counts as vegetarian, the majority of exhibitors focus on vegan treats and initiatives. Try out vegan cheese from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140424011406/http://www.treelinecheese.com/">Treeline</a>, who make fromage like Cracked Pepper Hard Cheese and creamy, Herb-Garlic Soft French-Style all created from cashews. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140424011406/http://nuttinordinary.com/">Nuttin Ordinary</a> also trades in the dairy for cashews with their original and spicy varieties of cheese spread. Sweets from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140424011406/https://www.facebook.com/bklynroseveganbakery">Brooklyn Rose Vegan Bakery</a>, grain mixes from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140424011406/http://www.soofoo.com/products/">SooFoo</a> and veggie chips and granolas from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140424011406/http://nynaturals.myshopify.com/">The Kale Factory</a> are just a few of the other scheduled attendees. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140424011406/http://nycvegfoodfest.com/2014-schedule/">Demos and talks</a> on things like going vegan on a budget and the benefits of a plant-based diet are part of the program as well; there&apos;s also some standup comedy on the docket to lighten the mood. Single day tickets are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140424011406/https://2014nycvegfoodfest.chirrpy.com/">available now</a> for $30 each or buy a weekend pass for $50. In addition to the on-site eats, vendors typically bring along some fun product samples, so get ready for a mini swag bag for enjoyment later.</p>
