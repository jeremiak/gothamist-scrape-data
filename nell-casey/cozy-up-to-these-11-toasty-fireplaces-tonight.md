<p>With snowflakes gently falling  and temperatures expected to dip below freezing tonight, it seems we may finally be slipping into winter&apos;s frigid grasp. Luckily, fireplaces are crackling in some of NYC&apos;s best restaurants and bars, perfect for warming up after a chilly commute. Here are our ten favorite spots to enjoy a fireside drink. </p>

<p><strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429201427/http://www.mexibbq.com/">MexiBBQ</a>:</strong> This Astoria joint serves up BBQ dishes with decidedly South of the Border flavors in a comfortable, brick-lined dining room that includes a state-of-the-art electric fireplace. Come for the modern fireside dining, stay for the 40+ beers on tap, from Ommegang Chocolate Indulgence Stout to Rogue Juniper Pale Ale. <em>37-11 30th Avenue, Astoria // 718-626-0333</em></p>

<p><strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429201427/http://www.mollysshebeen.com/welcome.html">Molly&apos;s</a>:</strong> It gets very hot next to the roaring fireplace&#x2014;we may or may not have accidentally melted our iPod when we stood too close to the flames&#x2014;but if you&apos;re sitting a safe distance away at the bar the cracking wood and smokey fragrance provides the perfect backdrop while you sip a perfectly pour Guinness. Hungry? The enormous cheeseburgers are one of our favorites in the city. <em>287 Third Avenue // 212-889-3361</em></p>

<p><strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429201427/http://www.oneifbyland.com/">One If By Land, Two If By Sea</a>:</strong> You don&apos;t have to stay for an expensive meal at this iconic Village eatery to enjoy a little fireside canoodling; the big bar area fireplace boasts comfortable seating right in front of the flames. Order a Cigar Box cocktail with Bulleit bourbon, mint, plumb bitters and Figenza Fig Vodka and imagine you&apos;re back in 19th century New York City. <em>17 Barrow Street // 212-255-8649</em></p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right"> <img alt="112712crownvic.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429201427im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_nellcasey/112712crownvic.jpeg" width="300" height="449"> <br> <i style=" width:300px; ;display:block"> <span class="photo_caption">Crown Vic</span></i></div> <strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429201427/http://www.crownvicbar.com/">Crown Vic</a>:</strong> It&apos;s not just for the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429201427/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/08/where_to_drink_outdoors_after_work.php">outdoor drinking</a> set, this enormous Williamsburg bar has a nice, big fireplace up front where you can linger over a single malt Old Pulteney or a hot cocktail. Snag a seat at a nearby table to indulge in the bar&apos;s upscale pub grub of burgers, wings, mac and cheese and more. And don&apos;t worry if you can&apos;t sit right in front of it; the fireplace kicks out plenty of heat for the whole room.<em> 60 South 2nd Street, Williamsburg // 917-719-6072</em><p></p>

<p><strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429201427/http://www.shoolbreds.com/index.html">Shoolbred&apos;s</a>:</strong> Step through the doors at this East Village bar and find yourself in a Victorian-esque parlor with old timey portraits and dark, intimate lighting. Go past the bar up front and into the back room, where you&apos;ll find bulky leather coaches and a crackling fire to warm your hands by. It&apos;s the kind of place you&apos;d want to twirl your moustache and smoke a pipe, if that kind of thing were still allowed. <em>197 2nd Avenue // 212-529-0340</em></p>

<p><strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429201427/http://www.thelambsclub.com/">The Lambs Club</a>:</strong> A dramatic, 18th-century marble fireplace makes a bold statement amidst the black and red, art deco-inspired dining room at chef Geoffrey Zakarian&apos;s midtown restaurant. It&apos;s on the fancier side, to be sure, but the three course tasting menu ($68) provides a wide range of nuanced flavors from Beef Tenderloin Tartare to Long Island Duck Breast. <em>141 West 43rd Street, inside the Chatwal Hotel // 212-997-7690</em></p>

The first American spin-off of the popular Roman restaurant of the same name (in business since 1922!), <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429201427/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/25/mod_roman_restaurant_antica_pesca_t.php#photo-1">Antica Pesa</a> boasts a spacious bar and lounge area up front, where a fireplace beckons guests to sink into brown leather couches and banquettes. A variety of wines&#x2014;all Italian&#x2014;are sold by the glass or bottle to help you unwind by the fire, which is surrounded by antique books and wine bottles from the old country.

The reasonably-priced drinks and bar snacks don&apos;t hurt either. <em>35 Graham Avenue, Brooklyn // 718-609-6388</em></p>

<p><strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429201427/http://www.blackmountainwinehouse.com/">Black Mountain Wine House</a>:</strong> No fussy mixology in sight at this Gowanus mainstay, where a very respectable (and reasonable) wine list can be explored in the cozy dinning room, kept warm by a crackling fireplace. A simple menu of cheese and small bites&#x2014;including a classic Swiss fondue on Tuesdays&#x2014;completes a relaxing evening out. <em>415 Union Street, Gowanus // 718-522-4340</em></p>

<p><strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429201427/http://www.longislandcitybar.com/">LIC Bar</a>:</strong> If you&apos;ve been around for over 100 years, chances are you know what you&apos;re doing by now. This is especially true at Queens&apos; LIC Bar, where a community vibe and friendly staff make for a fun and relaxing drinking experience. They&apos;re known for their backyard garden, which has an enclosed patio and fireplace perfect for the colder months. <em>4558 Vernon Boulevard, LIC // 718-786-5400</em></p>
