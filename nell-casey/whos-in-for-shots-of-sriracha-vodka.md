<p>What the hell took Big Vodka so long to jump on the sriracha bandwagon? After all, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140210112654/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/11/lays_gives_us_sriracha_chicken_and.php">potato chips</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140210112654/http://gothamist.com/2012/11/28/clearly_what_the_world_needs_now_is.php">lip balm</a> have been co-opting the stuff for years now!

<p>Philips Distilling Company dropped the chili bomb today, extolling its virtues in a bloody mary or michelada. From research director Jim Aune:</p>

<blockquote>The nose has a blend of chili peppers, including the hotter red chili pepper and the more subtle green chili pepper.&#xA0;<a href="&lt;a href=" http:="" www.uvvodka.com="" products="" sriracha"="">&quot;&gt;UV Sriracha</a> has a pepper character that hits you right up front, which is very quickly followed by the hot pepper.&#xA0;The hot stays mainly on the front of the tongue.&#xA0;It is buffered by the green pepper so the spice comes through, without offensive heat.</blockquote>

<p>All the bros will definitely be considering the &quot;nose&quot; when they&apos;re downing shots in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140210112654/http://gothamist.com/2010/06/09/icing.php">&quot;Firing&quot;</a> craze that&apos;s sure to sweep the nation.</p>
