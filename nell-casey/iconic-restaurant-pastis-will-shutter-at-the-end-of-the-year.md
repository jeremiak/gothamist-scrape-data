<p>It&apos;s time to say au revoir to Keith McNally&apos;s long-running Meatpacking District restaurant <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150511040640/http://www.pastisny.com/index.php">Pastis</a>; the eatery will shut its doors at the end of the year. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150511040640/http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20131001/REAL_ESTATE/131009988">Crains reports</a> that McNally filed notice with the state Department of Labor today explaining that he would be laying off all 200 employes of the 15-year-old restaurant on January 1st of next year. </p>

<p>A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150511040640/http://archive.constantcontact.com/fs113/1101788460931/archive/1113152440949.html">blog post by Gale Greene</a> earlier this year revealed Pastis would &quot;would close next January &apos;for nine months,&apos; so that the owners of 9 Ninth Avenue could add three floors.&quot; Greene got word directly from McNally that the restaurant would then reopen in September. This latest report indicates that McNally is currently negotiating with landlord Aurora Capital Associates but states that &quot;no deals have been finalized.&quot;</p>

<p>A restaurant employee <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150511040640/http://ny.eater.com/archives/2013/10/pastis_to_close_at_the_end_of_the_year_maybe_for_good.php">told Eater</a> the closure would be &quot;absolutely temporary,&quot; which would seem to jibe with earlier reports about renovations to the building. We reached out to the restaurant for comment and we&apos;ll update if we hear back.</p>
