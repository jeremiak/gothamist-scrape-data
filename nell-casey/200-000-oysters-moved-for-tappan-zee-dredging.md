<p>Construction on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130823100758/http://gothamist.com/2010/10/16/final_two_tappan_zee_bridge_redesig.php">new Tappan Zee Bridge</a> begins in August, but before the crews begin dredging for the foundation, they have a little bit of a bivalve contingent to deal with. Starting today, a three-man crew began <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130823100758/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2013/07/26/oysters-being-moved-to-safer-waters-as-dredging-for-new-tappan-zee-bridge-set-to-begin/">pulling colonies of oysters</a> from the Hudson River near the dredge site so they could relocate the knobbly critters about a mile south towards Manhattan. &#x201C;We don&#x2019;t want those oysters taken away with the dredging material that&#x2019;s going to be disposed of,&quot; explained special advisor Brian Coneybeare to WCBS.  &quot;So we&#x2019;re trying to get as many of those oysters out of there as we can and put them into a safer habitat.&#x201D;</p>

<p>The crew will spend a week pulling <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130823100758/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WngGeI9lnA"><strike>mussels from the shell</strike></a> yanking oysters into buckets for transport to the tune of about $100,000. Think of all the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130823100758/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/18/how_to_become_an_oyster_snob_withou.php">delicious dinners</a> that could be made from those suckers if the idea of eating anything out of the Hudson weren&apos;t so gross.</p>

<p>It turns out, oysters help to filter the nastiness out of the river. &#x201C;They actually help clean the water themselves and the fact that we&#x2019;re finding as many live oysters as we are has been a very pleasant surprise,&#x201D; Coneybeare went on to say. They could also help <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130823100758/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/30/forget_sandbags_oysters_could_have.php">protect from storm surges</a> if their numbers continue to grow. So oysters are delicious, good for the environment <em>and</em> help protect the city. Oysters for Mayor!</p>
