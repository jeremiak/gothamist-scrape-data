<p>While they may be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130609234742/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/01/queens_elementary_school_serving_ex.php">making healthy strides</a> in certain areas, it looks like NYC public schools are just as prone to vermin infestations <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130609234742/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/01/east_village_smac_shuttered_by_heal.php">as everybody else</a>. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130609234742/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/New-York-City-Public-School-Cafeteria-Violations-Inspections-Mice-Roaches-Liquid-Waste-206696381.html">NBC New York</a> took a look at 2012 cafeteria inspections and while most schools scored what would be graded as &quot;A&apos;s&quot; and &quot;B&apos;s,&quot; others had critical citations over multiple inspections, including non-vermin-proof facilities and liquid waste. While troubling, this <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130609234742/http://gothamist.com/2009/11/13/mice_dominate_nyc_school_cafeterias.php">isn&apos;t the first time we&apos;ve heard it</a>. </p>

<p>I.S 296 in Bushwick scored a whopping 44 points, which included points for flying insects, a non-vermin proof facility and inadequate hand washing facilities. P.S. 154 in Harlem bested even that with a score of 56 for contaminated food, dented cans and rats in the food area. RATS! Luckily for the students, when the school was reinspected a month later they seem to have fixed the problems. Other schools, like PS 93 in Bensonhurst and PS 104 in Far Rockaway didn&apos;t clean up their act after repeat inspections, sometimes scoring worse on subsequent visits by inspectors.</p>

<p>All in all, the report&#x2014;which you can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130609234742/http://media.nbcbayarea.com/documents/2012FR03314+-+NBC+-+Public+School+Cafeteria+Insp+FINAL.xlsx">peruse for yourself, should you be so inclined [pdf]</a>&#x2014;just serves to illustrate that nowhere is immune to the presence of unwelcome critters. Even <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130609234742/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/11/hunter_college_cafeteria_shut_down.php">higher education</a> has its fair share of infestations from time to time! And while rodents skittering around the lunch lady&apos;s shoes is definitely gross, at least they&apos;re not <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130609234742/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/03/rat_meat_sold_as_lamb_at_chinese_fa.php">using them to make bolognese</a>. </p>
