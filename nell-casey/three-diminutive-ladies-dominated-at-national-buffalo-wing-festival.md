<p>Don&apos;t judge a competitive eater by her size. That&apos;s the lesson the Major League Eating world learned this weekend when&#x2014;for the first time ever&#x2014;three tiny women took top honors at the National Buffalo Wing Festival&apos;s wing-eating championship. Miki Sudo, who placed first in the competition, chowed down on an astonishing 178 wings in the 12-minute time slot. Next in line was newcomer Michelle Lesco, who put away 158 wings, followed by former champion Sonya Thomas who came in third with 141. </p>

<p>Collectively, the three women consumed 15.02 pounds of chicken wing meat, compared to the next five competitors&#x2014;all male&#x2014;who ate 14.15 pounds of chicken wing meat in the same timeframe. Even more impressive, all together the women weigh 324 pounds, which is less than two of the male competitors individually. </p>

<p>The ladies topped an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130905212447/http://buffalowing.com/contest-information/u-s-chicken-wing-eating-championship/">impressive lineup</a> that included Eric &#x201C;Badlands&#x201D; Booker and Crazy Legs Conti. For reasons yet unknown, world champion Joey Chesnut dropped out of the big competition, though not before getting whooped the previous day by Sudo in the Buffet Bowl, in which competitors race to finish a five-pound bowl filled with Buffalo Pizza, Buffalo Chicken Fingers and other staples of the region&apos;s cuisine. </p>

<p>So far as we know, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130905212447/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/28/peta_is_very_concerned_about_your_u.php">no unborn penis was harmed</a> in the weekend&apos;s festivities. </p>
