<p>Mayor Tall may have urged New Yorkers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108031557/http://gothamist.com/2016/05/04/bad_chicken.php">not to Eat Mor Chikin</a>, but Chick-Fil-A continues its propagation of our boroughs, opening its third location in a few weeks in Queens. On September 1st, the controversial chicken chain will open inside the Queens Center Mall in Elmhurst, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108031557/http://qns.com/story/2016/08/16/first-chik-fil-a-in-queens-will-open-on-sept-1-and-first-100-customers-will-win-free-food-for-a-year/">reports QNS</a>, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108031557/http://gothamist.com/2015/09/30/chick-fil-a_free_food.php">like its first NYC outpost</a>, the first 100 in line get $37,000 in free food. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108031557/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/03/the_chick-fil-a_first_100_sleep_ove.php#photo-1">Cue the queue</a>! </p>

<p>Councilman Daniel Dromm, who is gay and leads the City Council&#x2019;s LGBT Caucus, has been a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108031557/http://qns.com/story/2016/05/02/to-eat-or-not-to-eat-chick-fil-a-comes-to-queens-with-a-side-of-controversy/">vocal opponent</a> of Chick-Fil-A and hoped the mall would change its mind about offering a lease to the chain. &quot;This group imparts a strong anti-LGBT message by forcing their employees and volunteers to adhere to a policy that prohibits same-sex love,&quot; he said in a statement.</p>
