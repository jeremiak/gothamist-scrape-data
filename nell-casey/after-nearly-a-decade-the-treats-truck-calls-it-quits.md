<p>On June 9th, 2007, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161023044041/http://www.treatstruck.com/">Treats Truck</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161023044041/http://gothamist.com/2007/06/09/treats_truck.php">motored into Greenwich Village</a>. On October 26th, 2016, it&apos;ll turn off its engines for good. In a letter on her website, owner Kim Ima thanked customers for their many years of patronage and &quot;good cheer.&quot; Sugar, her signature silver truck, will retire, but Ima says she&apos;ll still be keeping her website, where she says fans have been regularly emailing her.</p>

<p>&quot;People write to me all the time. Wonderful notes!&quot; Ima told Gothamist this morning. &quot;And I want people to still have a way to keep in touch. Also, I hope to share stories about the past ten years, in the coming years.&quot;</p>

<p>Ima didn&apos;t provide any outright reasons for the closure, but did point to the many years being both &quot;mom and pop&quot; in a mom and pop operation. &quot;This has been an incredible way to be a part of NYC,&quot; she said. &quot;To be on my side of the window, feeling the love and support and enthusiasm from the customers has been such a pleasure.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Also, I don&apos;t have someone groomed to take over. I wish I did!&quot; she lamented. </p>

<p>Ima and Sugar were known for peddling all sorts of sweet treats, predominantly cookies and brownies, though they also dabbled in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161023044041/http://gothamist.com/2008/08/11/conecakes_yay_or_nay.php">photo-friendly stuff</a> even before Instagram was invented (if you can even imagine such a time). The truck&apos;s last day will be next week, but the catering arm will still operate through December 23rd.</p>
