<p><em>Time</em> magazine attracted the ire of the food world this week by not including any female chefs in its November 18th issue dedicated to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150928055129/http://time100.time.com/2013/11/07/the-13-gods-of-food/">&quot;The Gods of Food.&quot;</a> Bad enough they should turn a blind eye to the world&apos;s top lady chefs, but when <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150928055129/http://eater.com/archives/2013/11/07/eater-q-a-time-magazine.php">questioned by Eater</a> about the exclusion, editor Howard Chua-Eoan fanned the flames further declaring that it&apos;s a &quot;harsh reality&quot; but the chef&apos;s world is &quot;still a boys club&quot; and &quot;[they] did not want to fill a quota of a woman chef.&quot; He also implied women couldn&apos;t do it on their own, claiming &quot;women really need someone&#x2014;if not men, themselves actually&#x2014;to sort of take care of each other.&quot; </p>

<p>Understandably, some of New York&apos;s female chefs took umbrage with the implication that there isn&apos;t a single influential chef without a penis in all of the world. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150928055129/http://gothamist.com/2008/12/11/amanda_cohen.php">Amanda Cohen</a>, maven of the inventive vegetable-focused eatery <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150928055129/http://www.dirtcandynyc.com/">Dirt Candy</a> thinks the magazine doesn&apos;t have a clue what it&apos;s talking about.</p>

<blockquote>If TIME magazine wants to continue to be irrelevant and not accurately
represent the restaurant industry, which is full of women, then that&#x2019;s
their choice. I&#x2019;ve worked in restaurants for over a decade and have
never found it to be a boys club. The only people who seem to think it
is are magazines like TIME.</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150928055129/https://twitter.com/porchettanyc">Sara Jenkins</a>, chef and owner of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150928055129/http://porsena.com/">Porsena</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150928055129/http://porchettanyc.com/">Porchetta</a>, agrees with Cohen about <em>Time&apos;s</em> irrelevance and points to the larger problem that surrounds the powerful PR machine in Big Cooking.</p>

<blockquote>I think it just shows how utterly clueless Time magazine is. In their history I cannot think of an event or trend that Time magazine has broken as a news story. <strong>They always seem to write about people or things only at the point where it&apos;s a mass media phenomena and on the backside of being relevant.</strong> I don&apos;t think they are who anyone turns to for cutting edge information or even in depth and informative stories...it&apos;s more an example of the relentless circle jerk between the media, pr agents and the chefs or countries who employ them than any kind of reflection on what&apos;s truly happening out there in the real world.</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150928055129/http://elizabethfalkner.com/">And Elizabeth Falkner</a>, an award winning chef who opened her UWS restaurant <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150928055129/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/09/corvo_bianco.php#photo-1">Corvo Bianco</a> this summer, called the issue &quot;extremely narrow and unfortunate&quot; but conceded that the &quot;[female chefs] don&apos;t always get invited to the party...and that is deeply inconsiderate and a boring exercise of circle jerk masturbation&quot;: </p>

<blockquote>The influence of countless female chefs is obvious and they simply chose to only point out the male chefs. I am not knocking any of the male chefs but articles like this are of eras past and <strong>Time Magazine must be losing ground to have to create a sensationalist story such as this</strong>.<br><br>There is a great network of female chefs called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150928055129/http://womenchefs.org/">Women Chefs and Restaurateurs</a> which was started 21 years ago because of this mentality in the media and the founders were sick of this kind of treatment. There is also a membership of female food and beverage professionals called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150928055129/http://www.ldei.org/">Les Dames d&apos;Escoffier</a> and the editor should have done a little more research.<br><br> The truth is that there are many great female chefs, and many food writers, and yes, we have had to work hard to get there and stay there but <strong>to say that we don&apos;t have a widespread influence on generations of cooks and food and beverage is just a lie</strong>.</blockquote>

<p>Falkner goes on to list over 30 female chefs very much deserving of a seat in <em>Time&apos;s</em> masculine pantheon, including April Bloomfield, Anita Lo, Alice Waters, Lidia Bastianich, Dorie Greenspan, Gabrielle Hamilton and many, many more. </p>

<p>Whether or not the &quot;boy&apos;s club&quot; still exists&#x2014;the chefs we interviewed were divided on that topic&#x2014;it&apos;s downright sexist and irresponsible for an institution to ignore the vast contributions by our nation&apos;s female chefs to fit the outdated and arbitrary editorial mold <em>Time</em> editors created for this issue. Luckily, their biased presentation of the culinary world has sparked a debate that will hopefully preclude this type of exclusion in the future. And if not, watch your back, editors: these ladies pack sharp knives.</p>
