<p>Fresh off the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108023755/http://gothamist.com/2016/08/11/alert_russ_daughters_makes_a_babka.php">babka ice cream sandwich</a> news comes another ice cream sandwich innovation&#x2014;and this time it&apos;s <em>free</em>. In celebration of its 10th birthday, tapas hot spot <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108023755/http://www.boquerianyc.com/">Boqueria</a> will be giving away complimentary churro ice cream sandwiches in collaboration with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108023755/http://www.vanleeuwenicecream.com/">Van Leeuwen Artisan Ice Cream</a> on Monday, August 15th. You&apos;ll find them at the ice cream truck parked outside the restaurant. </p>

<p>The two churro &quot;cookies&quot;&#x2014;which look every bit as puffy and delicious as the subway versions&#x2014;will be bound together by Vanilla, Chocolate, Salted Caramel or Espresso ice creams from VanLeeuwen. Churro ice cream sandwiches are already <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108023755/http://laist.com/2014/06/16/the_churro_ice_cream_sandwich_is.php">popular</a> in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108023755/http://laist.com/2015/04/16/churro_borough_ice_cream.php">Los Angeles</a> but if we&apos;re being real, these look way better.</p>

<p>Of course, there&apos;s a catch: they&apos;re only giving away 250 of them and only between 7 p.m. and 9 p.m.&#x2014;if they last that long. However, if you&apos;re eating lunch or dinner at either the SoHo or UES outposts of Boqueria, you&apos;ll get free churros (sadly, sans ice cream) with your meal.</p>
