<p>Those observing Falafel Day holiday on Sunday can start their festivities early with a <strong>free falafel</strong> afternoon snack today at any <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161017162744/http://nanoosh.com/locations/">Nanoosh location</a>. From 3 p.m. to 6 p.m. the Mediterranean spot&apos;s setting up complimentary falafel bars, where you can receive three pieces of baked falafel with hummus, pickles, tahini and both habanero and green pepper sauces. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161017162744/http://www.oijinyc.com/">Oiji&apos;s</a> <strong>Honey Butter Chips</strong> have been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161017162744/http://gothamist.com/2015/05/21/oiji_korean_east_village.php#photo-1">something of a sensation</a> since the Korean comfort food spot opened last year. This weekend, the East Village eatery is operating a little takeout window to sell said chips with an accompanying bowl of ice cream. On Saturday from noon to 5 p.m. and Sunday from noon to 4 p.m., swing by to grab a bowl of chips and ice cream for $10 then dazzle pedestrians on 1st Avenue with your score.</p>

<p>The organ at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161017162744/http://missionbklyn.org/">San Damiano Mission</a> church in Greenpoint is in need of a restoration, so this weekend, there&apos;s a pop-up taco operation going on to raise funds to help out. On Saturday and Sunday from 2 p.m. to 9 p.m., swing by the church&apos;s courtyard for <strong>barbecue-style tacos and beers</strong> via the folks at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161017162744/http://www.extrafancybklyn.com/">Extra Fancy</a>. On the menu: Hickory Smoked Chopped Pork with Pineapple Cilantro El Pastor Sauce, Smoky Mole Pulled Chicken with Pickled Slaw and Wood Smoked Portobello &apos;Shrooms with Esquites Corn Mayo. There&apos;s also the possibility of a vegan option as well. </p>

<p>Whether you&apos;re a fan of seafood or outdoor dining, Manhattan&apos;s very own Little Italy is eager to satisfy both of your indulgences this weekend. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161017162744/http://www.caprinyc.com/#modern-organic-thai">Capri Ristorante</a>, a new Italian eatery, is offering <strong>$1 oysters</strong> that will be shucked and drained right in front of your very eyes as you order. Not bad for a new restaurant. In addition, city-goers who find themselves on Mulberry Street can rejoice now that the bustling thoroughfare is closed to traffic on the weekends. This means that the sidewalk seating has taken over the street and outdoor drinking is officially a go. What better way to spend the weekend than with a plate of Italian food and a few bottles of wine? <em>(Jordan Simon)</em></p>
