<p>Lovers of slimy sea creatures should mark their calendars as oysters are the stars at two upcoming food festivals this month. Grand Central Oyster Bar throws their 11th annual <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130901081520/http://www.oysterbarny.com/event/2013-oyster-frenzy/">Oyster Frenzy</a> on September 28th. From noon until 4 p.m., check out free demos and tastings from Oceana executive chef Ben Pollinger and other notable oyster aficionados. Watch professional oyster shuckers like Luis &quot;The Mexican Menace&quot; Iglesius&#x2014;a six-time shucking champion&#x2014;compete to see who can shuck the fastest while you dine on 16 types of oysters from both the west and east coasts. If you&apos;re particularly daring/good at slurping, compete in the Slurp Off to find out if you can eat 12 oysters the fastest; or test your bottle opening skills at the Beer Shucking Championship. </p>

<p>Make a weekend getaway to the 36th annual <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130901081520/http://www.seaport.org/Default.aspx?pageId=842416&amp;eventId=735361&amp;EventViewMode=EventDetails">Norwalk Seaport Association Oyster Festival</a> in the coastal Connecticut town. September 6th through 8th, head to Veteran&apos;s Park on the harbor for music, amusements and plenty of oysters. Harbor cruises are available, as are walking tours of the vessels, but if you stay on land, get ready for musical performances by&#x2014;wait for it&#x2014;the Village People.
