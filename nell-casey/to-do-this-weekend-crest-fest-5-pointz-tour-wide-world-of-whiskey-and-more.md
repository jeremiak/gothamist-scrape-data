<p>The crazy <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408141545/http://cresthardwareartshow.com/">Crest Fest</a> has come a long way since its humble beginnings in the early &apos;90s, when the father and son duo who own Crest Hardware in Williamsburg let local artist Gene Pool display some of his work in their shop. Fast forward to 2012, and the bizarre affair transcended the confines of the hardware shop into the surrounding yard, with music, craft vendors and food. But that&apos;s not to say that Crest Fest has forsaken its roots; over 100 works from artists in different mediums will be displayed in over 10,000 square feet of indoor and outdoor space along Metropolitan Avenue.</p>

<p>When we <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408141545/http://gothamist.com/2008/06/10/joseph_franquin.php">interviewed owner Joseph Franquinha back in 2008</a> he said the show was about &quot;taking love of my community, my love of art, my love of hardware and welding them together to bridge a gap in this continually changing city, but Williamsburg in particular.&quot; That hasn&apos;t changed: proceeds generated by this year&apos;s Crest Fest (all involvement is volunteer-based) will be donated to The City Reliquary Museum and Civic Organization. Admission is free and the show will be open from 1 p.m. to 7 p.m. on Saturday.</p>
