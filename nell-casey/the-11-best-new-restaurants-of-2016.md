title: The 11 Best New Restaurants Of 2016
---

	
										<p><em>There were a lot of great (and not so great) restaurant openings in NYC this year, and like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170326185849/http://gothamist.com/2016/12/20/best_new_bites_of_2016.php">many others in my field</a> I ate at lots and lots and lots of them. One of the downfalls of my profession: I don&apos;t always get to return to my favorites as often as I&apos;d like. With the emphasis always on the new, there&apos;s a compulsion to give a newcomer a try rather than seek comfort in what&apos;s loved and familiar. Plus: dining out can be expensive, especially at flashier spots.</em></p>

<p><em>So while there were some blockbuster&#x2014;and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170326185849/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/16/michelin_guide_nyc_2017.php">critically acclaimed</a>&#x2014;additions to the dining scene this year like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170326185849/http://gothamist.com/2016/08/30/fredrik_berselius_aska.php#photo-1">Fredrik Berselius&apos;s Aska reboot</a> and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170326185849/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/02/le_coucou_chinatown.php#photo-1">flashy Le Coucou</a> (both worth visits, if you can swing it), for this list, I&apos;m focusing on spots that I&apos;m eager to return to that don&apos;t necessitate a special occasion or lots of disposable income.</em></p>

<p><em>Here are the best new restaurants of 2016, presented in no particular order:</em></p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="122016nix.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170326185849im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_nellcasey/122016nix.jpg" width="640" height="427"> <br> <i> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170326185849/http://www.paulcrispin.com/">Paul Quitoriano</a>/Gothamist)</i></div> <p></p>

<p><strong>NIX</strong> We&apos;re in the era of the &quot;vegetable-forward&quot; movement and the proliferation of vegan restaurants, while juice bars and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170326185849/http://gothamist.com/2016/12/13/honeybrains_review.php#photo-1">health food</a> still reign. &apos;Good for you&apos; food is all well and good, but blessings upon chef John Fraser&apos;s vegetarian restaurant for making clear that vegetables don&apos;t have to be self-righteous&#x2014;they can be sin (and butter and cream) incarnate. Other than being vegetarian, the restaurant is pleasingly idiosyncratic, drawing from global inspirations to produce an eclectic menu of veggie-friendly dishes. </p>

<p>Fraser and chef de cuisine Heather Machovec captured the &quot;cacio e pepe&quot; craze of 2016 with an addictive shiitake &quot;cacie e pepe&quot; over creamy polenta, and whatever their seasonal fry bread offering happens to be that day, it&apos;s the belly filler for the ages. If there&apos;s an adult in your life who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170326185849/https://twitter.com/bfishbfish">claims to hate vegetables</a>, this is an excellent place to tell them to grow up and embrace the garden. </p>

<p><strong>LILIA</strong> Missy Robbins blew into Williamsburg in a big way this year, opening this buzzy Italian spot on Union Avenue. It didn&apos;t take long for reservations to become a challenge, something unlikely to change given Lilia&apos;s lauded status on this list and many others. But with determination you, too, can dine at Lilia; and if you can, you should.</p>

<p>Robbins knocks it out of the park with her pastas, especially the agnolotti stuffed with sheep&apos;s milk cheese and drenched in an addictive sauce of saffron, tomato, honey, and what we can assume is a healthy knob of butter. Don&apos;t sleep on the bagna cauda, either; now&apos;s not the time to be put off by &quot;warm anchovy&quot; when it&apos;s such a delectable dipping sauce for crunchy vegetables. </p>

<p>With an upbeat soundtrack that&apos;s often heavy on the &apos;90s hip hop, Lilia is one in the next generation of Williamsburg restaurants focusing on upscale dining to lure in the newer influx of well-off residents, however that makes you feel.</p>

<p><em>567 Union Avenue, Williamsburg, 718-576-3095; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170326185849/http://www.lilianewyork.com/">lilianewyork.com</a></em></p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="122016covina.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170326185849im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_nellcasey/122016covina.jpg" width="640" height="427"> <br> <i> (Jessica Nash)</i></div> <p></p>

<p><strong>COVINA</strong> There were plenty of flashy hotel restaurant openings this year, including Tim and Nancy Cushman&apos;s romantic, globally-inspired eatery inside the Park South Hotel. Kips Bay isn&apos;t historically a dining destination neighborhood, but Covina now joins the ranks of go-to restaurants&#x2014;Marta, Upland, The Cannibal&#x2014;that are nice enough for a special occasion but approachable enough for a last-minute meal.</p>

<p>Pizza and pasta brought carbs back into style this year, too, and this spot is no exception. Approachable options like a Pepperoni &amp; Soppressata pizza share menu space with a hearty Caesar Covina, Herb Roasted Chicken and splurgy burger made with Wagyu chuck. Sometimes the best restaurants are the ones giving you what you think you want and doing a spectacular job of it. </p>

<p><em>127 East 27th Street, Kips Bay, 212-204-0225; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170326185849/https://covinanyc.com/">covinanyc.com</a></em></p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="122016cherrypoint.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170326185849im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_nellcasey/122016cherrypoint.jpg" width="640" height="427"> <br> <i> (Nick Calcott)</i></div> <p></p>

<p><strong>CHERRY POINT</strong> Is it pure coincidence that Cherry Point is located inside a former Greenpoint butcher shop and has some of the city&apos;s best charcuterie? Or perhaps it has to do with the chef and co-owner, Julian Calcott, a former executive sous chef at April Bloomfield&apos;s genre-defining gastropub The Spotted Pig. Regardless the reason: the charcuterie&apos;s the stuff dreams are made of&#x2014;and I have, in fact, dreamed of it.</p>

<p>Rotating selections include different types of terrines like one made with lamb and apricots served with crusty grilled bread; tiny jars of smoked whitefish served with addictive house-made saltine crackers; and house-made labne cheese drizzled with honey. Order up some combination plate of meat-fish-cheese (many of which come with a dollop of honey or fruit paste on the side), pair it with a Manhattan, and you&apos;ll be very happy. </p>

<p>The neighborhood spot&apos;s romantic without being cloying, and if you need something more than a charcuterie plate, they&apos;ve got filling and reasonably-priced entrees like a gigantic double patty burger with cheese and pickles.</p>

<p><strong>OLMSTED</strong> I don&apos;t think any other restaurant in the city garnered as much affection, praise and general laurels than Greg Baxtrom&apos;s pretty eatery in the growing dining destination known as Prospect Heights. And you won&apos;t be hearing a contrarian hot take from me.</p>

<p>There&apos;s the beautiful back yard with the cute (and not-for-eating) quails, twinkling lights and fragrant (edible) garden, which Baxtrom uses as an on-site produce section. The menu&apos;s never going to be quite the same between visits&#x2014;though the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170326185849/http://gothamist.com/2016/05/25/olmsted_prospect_heights.php#photo-2">Carrot Crepe</a> has proved unstoppable and, possibly, un-removable&#x2014;but count on exquisite dishes&#x2014;that undoubtably belie their true complexity&#x2014;that would be too lovely to eat if only they weren&apos;t so outstandingly delicious. </p>

<p><strong>EMMY SQUARED</strong> Pizza had a great year in NYC, thanks in no small part to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170326185849/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/20/emmy_squared_detroit_pizza_heaven.php#photo-1">robust Detroit pies</a> flying out of the kitchen at Emmy Squared. This sister restaurant to Clinton Hill&apos;s Emily made a huge splash when it opened in April, introducing NYC to buttery, fluffy pies with that signature rim of crunchy crust. From a spicy pepperoni to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170326185849/http://gothamist.com/2016/05/23/hawaiian_pizza_trend_nyc.php">Hawaiian pizza</a> to the gourmetification of ranch on pizza, Emmy Squared filled bellies in a substantial way in 2016 and will likely continue to do so for years upon years to come.</p>

<p>And if all that dough somehow left you still unsatisfied, the restaurant regularly offers an off-menu burger, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170326185849/https://www.instagram.com/p/BNsgKpVh1bN/?taken-by=emmysquaredpizza">Le Big Matt</a>, that&apos;s NSFPC (Not Safe For Public Consumption) while retaining one&apos;s dignity. </p>

<p><strong>EL ATORADERO</strong> Both <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170326185849/http://gothamist.com/2016/12/20/best_new_bites_of_2016.php">Quick Bites</a> columnist Scott Lynch and I agree: El Atoradero is freaking rad. While the Bronx undoubtably misses its <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170326185849/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/23/el_atoradero_brooklyn.php#photo-1">homegrown hero</a>, Brooklyn gained quite a bit when Denisse Lina Chavez moved her operation to Prospect Heights. Everything&apos;s outstanding, including her legendary carnitas, and pretty much everything you order with the restaurant&apos;s homemade tortillas is going to be a soul satisfier, especially <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170326185849/https://www.instagram.com/p/BEuacj4EoDi/?taken-by=nellcasey">their ridiculously good nachos</a>. </p>

<p>Soon, the team will be opening up an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170326185849/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/01/mezcal_101_nyc.php">adjacent mezcal bar</a>. Hopefully, you can order the nachos there, too. </p>

<p><strong>MR. DONAHUE&apos;S</strong> Put simply: Mr. Donahue&apos;s is adorable. There&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170326185849/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/01/mr_donahues_nolita.php#photo-1">barely seating for 10</a>, the ceramic dishware looks like retro diner meets grandma&apos;s china cabinet, and the food, well, it&apos;s as cute as it is tasty.</p>

<p>To put a diminutive marker&#x2014;who wants to be &quot;cute&quot; when they could be beautiful?&#x2014;isn&apos;t to diminish from the fine and sometimes substantial fare coming out of the kitchen. It&apos;s just that it fills you with such a warm, cozy feeling to dine there that not even Russian teenagers sucking face and Snapchatting their SoHo purchases can really distract from what fun you&apos;re having. </p>

<p>Riffing of the classic &quot;meat-and-three&quot; structure, meals <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170326185849/https://www.instagram.com/p/BIvmdZxDa-6/?taken-by=nellcasey">could go something like</a>: Chicken Fried Pork Cheeks, Steamed Artichoke and Crab Imperial with pepper gravy. Or medium Steelhead Trout with Pickled Beets, Deviled Duck Egg and Herb Garlic Sauce. Both just $19.99&#x2014;for the whole shebang. </p>

<p><strong>DINNERTABLE</strong> When they <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170326185849/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/29/dinnertable_reverse_speakeasy.php#photo-1">ran the show</a> at dinnertable in the East Village, husband-and-wife Chefs Scott Tacinelli and Angie Rito made a big splash with their unique and delicious pastas, which they&apos;re now <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170326185849/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/31/pasta_omakase.php#photo-1">doing business with elsewhere</a>. Taking over is Chef Ricardo Arias, who has put a Japanese accent on dishes like Crispy Uni Paella Balls, Beef Tartare flavored with onions four ways, and a gourmet Dinnertable Dog with a miso sausage and a wasabi pea salt on the side to sprinkle on.</p>

<p>The vibe&apos;s more stoner chic now (I&apos;ll let you find the decoration that gave it away) and Arias&apos;s ebullient personality is well-suited to the intimate dining experience. Grab a seat at the counter overlooking the modest &quot;kitchen&quot;&#x2014;peep the teeny, tiny deep fryer they&apos;re forced to use&#x2014;and enjoy a bit of a show along with your supper.</p>

<p><strong>PAOWALLA</strong> If you get down with breads, you will be <em>very</em> satisfied dining at Floyd Cardoz&apos;s cute South Village restaurant, where an entire page of the menu focuses on naan, roti and stuffed bread. If you get down with vegetables, you will also be well-sated, with dishes like Shishito Pakoras festively dressed with peanuts, cilantro and ruby orbs of pomegranate seeds or one of the many chutneys that can accompany the aforementioned breads.</p>

<p>And if you eat meat and eggs, dear reader, you shall be well-fed indeed. Cardoz&apos;s famed Egg Kejirwal&#x2014;a deliciously deceptive dish that hides an egg beneath a slab of cheddar cheese with a wildly delicious coconut chili chutney&#x2014;is one of the year&apos;s best dishes, hands down. The Baby Pig Vindaloo, fiery with chilies and garlic, is damn good, too.</p>

<p>In short: this restaurant is a crowd pleaser for <em>anyone</em>, including those who imbibe alcohol. Don&apos;t miss out on the delicate Blossom Rose, served in a champagne-like flute filled with gin, lemon, cardamom, creme de rose and cava. </p>

<p><em>195 Spring Street, South Village, 212-235-1098; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170326185849/http://www.paowalla.com/">paowalla.com</a></em></p>

<p><strong>CAFE ALTRO PARADISO</strong> The team behind Estela in Nolita had a busy year, opening two new restaurants&#x2014;one downtown, one way uptown&#x2014;in 2016. I&apos;ll confess to not having made it up to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170326185849/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/12/flora_bar_met_breuer.php#photo-1">their new Met Breuer restaurant</a>, but if it&apos;s anything like their other newcomer, Cafe Altro Paradiso, then there&apos;s yet another reason to dine on the Upper East Side.</p>

<p>Back downtown, it&apos;s (admittedly pricey) small plates that justify their price in quality, execution and deliciousness. In fact, if you don&apos;t want to venture north of $22, you&apos;ll get plenty full on dishes like gooey-centered arancini, a suggestive sausage and beans dish, and easily shareable plates of seasonal pastas like orecchiette with nduja sausage, all priced under $22.</p>

<p>It can get a little shouty as the evening wears on&#x2014;the well-rounded wine list of mostly Italian origin may help to explain that.</p>
