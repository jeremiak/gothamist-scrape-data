					<p>&quot;It&apos;s almost too beautiful to eat&quot; isn&apos;t a phrase I throw around lightly&#x2014;if it looks good and it smells good and I&apos;ve ordered it, I&apos;m eating it. The closest I&apos;ve come to breaking this rule was at a preview of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170406154420/https://www.suzukinyc.com/">Suzuki</a>, a Japanese Kaiseki restaurant opening Wednesday in Midtown. A first course of sesame tofu is presented in a porcelain chariot adorned with fresh purple flowers; alongside, a small, tulip-shaped ramekin holds cubes of tender scallop, with skewered tsukune chicken, a sliver of truffled cheese, and a pumpkin-flavored wedge of castella cake on the side. </p>

<p>The artful creations are that of chef Takashi Yamamoto, who created a procession of beautiful and subtly-seasoned dishes to be paraded out over the course of several hours. Some are simpler but no less intriguing to the eye, like the Tsukuri (sashimi) course&#x2014;which features fresh, raw slices of fish like toro, lobes of Hokkaido uni, and prawn&#x2014;served in a crystal bowl over ice. Others are more dramatic, like the Nimono course of wagyu beef set in simmering broth over an open flame until the meat has reached medium rare. </p>

<p>The most opulent kaiseki option, Uzuki, runs $150 for 10 courses, but there are more wallet-friendly options ringing up at $70 (Shojin). The menu changes monthly (Uzuki is the ancient Japanese term for April).</p>

<p>Suzuki gets its name from Toshio Suzuki, the New York <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170406154420/http://gothamist.com/2009/01/12/chef_toshio_suzuki_sushi_zen.php">sushi legend</a> who operated Sushi Zen and now runs this three-in-one concept in Midtown with his son. Joining the kaiseki restaurant are Satsuki, a 10-seat omakase sushi bar run by Suzuki and chef Kentaro Sawada, and a cocktail bar, Three Pillars, offering drinks created by &quot;biochemist and alchemist&quot; Alex Ott, who told me he worked with NASA. If you&apos;re needing to boost your libido and relieve your anxiety, there&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170406154420/https://www.suzukinyc.com/three-pillars/">a drink for that</a>.</p>

<p><em>114 West 47 Street, Suzuki: (212) 278-0010, Satsuki: (212) 278-0047; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170406154420/https://www.suzukinyc.com/">suzukinyc.com</a></em></p>
