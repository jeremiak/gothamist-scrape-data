<p>Unless you&apos;re a bartender or a high-functioning alcoholic, it&apos;s unlikely that you&apos;re drinking during office hours. But has your teetotaller boss been wrong to keep you from indulging in a few brewskies over your burrito? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429155012/http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2013/08/21/the_case_for_getting_drunk_at_work.html">Matthew Yglesias over at Slate</a> tackles this all-important taboo, revealing what the Don Drapers of the world knew before you were born: a few cocktails during the work day actually increases productivity. </p>

<p>Yglesias points to a 2012 study delightfully titled <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429155012/http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053810012000037">&quot;Uncorking the muse: Alcoholic intoxication facilitates creative problem solving</a>&quot; which discovered that individuals with a blood alcohol content of .075 &quot;solved more [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429155012/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_Associates_Test">Remote Associates Test</a>] items, in less time, and were more likely to perceive their solutions as the result of a sudden insight.&quot; In other words, having a buzz on might make you file those TPS reports faster than your sober cubicle-mate. </p>

<p>At .076 BAC you shouldn&apos;t be operating a car&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429155012/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/24/more_fare_hikes_on_the_way.php">god bless public transportation</a>&#x2014;but it does lend credence to the long-gone Three Martini Lunch. For a 180-pound man to achieve that BAC that means between 3 and 4 drinks in one hour; for a 180-pound women, it&apos;s just over 3 drinks in one hour. Time to start a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429155012/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/27/the_10_best_happy_hours_in_nyc.php">happy hour at 1 p.m.</a> petition.</p>
