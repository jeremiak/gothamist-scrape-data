title: This Is The Best Restaurant In Brooklyn, According To Yelp

										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="122915coney.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108031103im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_nellcasey/122915coney.jpg" width="640" height="360"> <br> <i> (via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108031103/http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/coney-shack-brooklyn?select=odx1z9Y-CoNhKONaAT1I2w">Yelp</a>)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>According to a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108031103/http://communityblog.yelp.com/2015/12/top-100-places-to-eat-in-brooklyn.html">new report by Yelp</a>, the top-rated restaurant in Brooklyn is a two-year-old hot dog and taco truck. The peer review site crunched some numbers and has dubbed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108031103/https://www.facebook.com/Coney-Shack-589987747726730/timeline">Coney Shack</a>, a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108031103/http://gothamist.com/2015/09/14/vendy_awards_2015.php#photo-10">Vendy Award-winning</a> mobile food purveyor who cooks up Southeast Asian and hot dogs laden with cheese and mayo, the best place to eat in the borough. Good luck finding it in Brooklyn, though, as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108031103/https://twitter.com/coneyshack">their Tweets show</a> they operate mostly&#x2014;if not exclusively?&#x2014;in Manhattan.</p>

<p>Yelp says calculations to determine the 100 best restaurants in Brooklyn were made using a method akin to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108031103/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_proportion_confidence_interval#Wilson_score_interval">Wilson Score</a>, a complicated mathematical equation I will not even attempt to explain (because I do not understand it). &quot;This method takes into account both star rating and number of reviews to reveal which spots not only have top notch ratings, but also which are most popular in the borough,&quot; the site explains. Coney Shack, for example, has 136 reviews, averaging a 4.5 out of five; Kelso Bistro Bar &amp; Restaurant in Crown Heights, number 100 on the list, has 119 reviews and an average of 4.5 stars. </p>

<p>By that method, the number two spot was awarded to The Family Store in Bay Ridge, followed by BeeHive Oven Biscuit Cafe in Williamsburg, Mountain Province in East Williamsburg and Patsys Pizzeria in Park Slope. Perennial favorites like Juliana&apos;s Pizza (19) and  Paulie Gee&apos;s (42) made the cut&#x2014;though somewhat shockingly, given tourists&apos;s love for Yelp, Grimaldi&apos;s  doesn&apos;t crack the top 100. Also somewhat surprising: Peter Luger&apos;s 3305 reviews and solid 4 star rating got it booted from the list as well. Ah, how the mighty <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108031103/http://gothamist.com/2007/12/06/brooklyns_best.php">have</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108031103/http://gothamist.com/2006/03/27/the_citys_best_1.php">fallen</a>. </p>
