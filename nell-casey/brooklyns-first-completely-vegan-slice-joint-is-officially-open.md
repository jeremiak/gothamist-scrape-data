<p>It&apos;s a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170721200443/http://gothamist.com/tags/vegan">great time</a> to be vegan in NYC and it&apos;s <em>always</em> been a great time to love pizza in NYC, so disciples of both will be pleased to hear there&apos;s a new spot to get a &apos;za fix without a single iota of animal. Champs Jr., the Greenpoint outpost of the popular East Williamsburg vegan diner, has been reborn as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170721200443/http://www.screamerspizzeria.com/">Screamers Pizzeria</a>, the borough&apos;s first completely vegan slice joint. The pizzeria, which officially opened yesterday, is a collaboration between the Champs folks and a contingent from Blackbird Pizzeria, a vegan spot in Philly.</p>

<p>&quot;There&#x2019;s a pretty noticeable lack of authentic New York style pizza, done vegan and done well, here in NYC,&quot; a rep for Champs <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170721200443/http://brokelyn.com/champs-jr-now-screamers-pizzeria-100-vegan-slice-pizza-joint/">said to Brokelyn</a>, a nice jab to nearby Vinnie&apos;s Pizzeria, who are known for their vegan offerings. Co-owner Brad Baker <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170721200443/http://www.bkmag.com/2016/06/14/screamers-brings-vegan-pizza-slice-greenpoint/">acknowledged the competition to Brooklyn Magazine</a>, offering that &quot;there is no place that is just a vegan pizza by the slice.&quot; </p>

<p>The smallish spot will turn out <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170721200443/https://www.instagram.com/p/BGnQPVqMuap/?taken-by=screamerspizzeria">classic cheese</a> pies; a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170721200443/https://www.instagram.com/p/BGkjUUtMuc5/?taken-by=screamerspizzeria">white pie</a> with garlic oil, vegan cheese, broccoli rabe, caramelized onions and homemade almond ricotta; and their namesake <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170721200443/https://www.instagram.com/p/BGkipC2MubC/?taken-by=screamerspizzeria">&quot;The Screamer&quot;</a> with garlic oil, vegan cheese, cremini and oyster mushrooms and parsley, topped with homemade almond parm, among others. </p>

<p>Baker says the name is a &quot;pizza slang term&quot; for mushrooms, because &quot;when canned mushrooms hit the stove, all the water evaporates so they scream.&quot; Mmhm, that&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170721200443/http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=screamer&amp;utm_source=search-action">definitely it</a>. </p>

<p><em>620 Manhattan Avenue, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170721200443/http://www.screamerspizzeria.com/">website</a>. Open 11 a.m. to midnight.</em></p>
