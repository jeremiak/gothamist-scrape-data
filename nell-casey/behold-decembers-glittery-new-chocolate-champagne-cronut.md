<p>Praise be: we finally have a chocolate Cronut! Dominique Ansel <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150303144220/https://twitter.com/DominiqueAnsel/status/404353731371622400">dropped the new flavor</a> over the weekend (sneaky!), revealing that December&apos;s queue-making pastry will be Valrhona Chocolate Champagne&#x2014;and they&apos;re using <em>real</em> bubbly!</p>

<p>The festive Cronut uses &quot;actual fresh Brut Champagne,&quot; according to the bakery, as opposed to a champagne extract. They&apos;re also using Valrhona Caraibe 66% dark for the sinful chocolate component so it won&apos;t be cloyingly sweet. The final product gets dusted with an orange zest sugar, which kind of makes it sparkle and glitter and <em>oh my god get in my mouth!</em></p>

<p>The bakery tells us response to this new flavor has been the biggest yet, so good luck gaining access to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150303144220/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/18/you_can_now_pre-order_your_cronut_o.php">online reservation system</a>, which currently appears to be having a fit from all the traffic. The bakery still accepts pre-orders of 6 Cronuts or less if you call Mondays at 11 a.m.; otherwise, bundle up and brave the line.</p>
