<p>It seems like only yesterday we discovered <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130727040038/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/22/with_the_right_location_street_vend.php">how much cash street vendors raked in</a> per day. Now the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130727040038/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-street-vendors-offer-hot-dogs-7m-health-violations-article-1.1406243?localLinksEnabled=false">Daily News reports</a> that some vendors aren&apos;t using that cashola to pay fines levied against them by the Health Department. Since 2010, the city has issued fines approaching $10.8 million, but has only collected a mere $3.5 million in what it&apos;s owed. Some of these violations were for dirty carts, but of the 7,124 fines issued in 2012, 1,093 of them were for &quot;food stored in an adjacent cooler or in a container stashed on the sidewalk.&quot; &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t think coolers are a threat to anyone,&#x201D; said Sean Basinski, director of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130727040038/http://streetvendor.org/">Street Vendor Project</a>. &#x201C;I&#x2019;ve never tripped on one.&#x201D;</p>

<p>To fix the problem, the 2013-2012 approved city budget allocates $580,000 to pay seven lawyers to find the offenders and hopefully get them to cough up. They&apos;ll be after people like Shawki Eldin, an Egyptian immigrant who operates a hot dog cart in Brooklyn. Eldin has received 12 violations since 2012 and currently owes $7,480 in fines for violations including dirty equipment and hands and not refrigerating raw foods. Instead of paying the fine, Eldin moved his cart to a new spot to avoid city inspectors. &#x201C;The officers never treat me well,&#x201D; he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130727040038/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-street-vendors-offer-hot-dogs-7m-health-violations-article-1.1406243?localLinksEnabled=false">explained to the Daily News</a>. &#x201C;They are just targeting me because they know I&#x2019;m an immigrant and can&#x2019;t afford to fight them.&#x201D;</p>

<p>While these numbers seem huge, back in 2008-2009 unpaid vendor fines were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130727040038/http://gothamist.com/2010/11/10/report_street_vendors_arent_paying.php">nearly double what they are now</a>, though at the time the Street Vendor Project called the numbers &quot;misleading.&quot;  Advocacy groups and vendors themselves <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130727040038/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/24/vendors_fight_for_lower_fines.php">call the steep fines</a> unfair and have been lobbying to reduce fines for non-health code violations. &quot;It is a scheme,&quot; said Councilwoman Melissa Mark-Viverito at a Committee on Consumer Affairs meeting last year. &quot;I think it is another effort by this administration to criminalize the poor.&quot; Well, at least this administration isn&apos;t kowtowing to the wealthy or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130727040038/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/23/only_rich_people_and_celebrities_ca.php">anything like that</a>. </p>
