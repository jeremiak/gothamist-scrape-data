<p>Get ready to line up extra early at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509193810/http://www.smorgasburg.com/">Smorgasburg</a> this Saturday because the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509193810/http://sunnoodle.com/">Sun Noodle</a> stand will be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509193810/http://www.goramen.com/2013/08/smorgasburg-week-1-shoyu-ramen-burger.html">selling burgers with ramen &quot;buns&quot;</a> to the first 100 souls willing to face the world before noon on a weekend. Noodle master Keizo Shimamoto is bringing his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509193810/https://www.facebook.com/RamenBurger">Ramen Burger</a> creation to the waterfront market as a kind of trial run for a potential restaurant in the future.</p>

<p>The burger consists of a 75-25% blend patty, a generous slathering of shoyu sauce, peppery arugula and a scattering of scallions. In lieu of bread, Shimamoto griddles discs of Sun Noodle ramen noodles in sesame oil until they are crisp, then stuffs the &quot;buns&quot; with the burger and fixins. He&apos;ll employ the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509193810/http://www.greendustries.com/#/pleatPak">PleatPak</a>, an innovative burger wrapper, to ensure all the soup-y goodness from your burger doesn&apos;t leak onto your <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509193810/http://dcist.com/2013/07/urban_outfitters_sells_ian_mackaye-.php">Urban Outfitters Minor Threat T-shirt</a>. </p>

<p>Shimamoto ran Bassanova Ramen in Tokyo and was slated to be part of the NYC expansion until he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509193810/http://www.goramen.com/2013/07/the-next-stepmoving-on.html">revealed on his blog</a> that he was no longer involved. Instead, he&apos;ll focus on getting his Ramen Burger plan off the ground, starting with this weekend&apos;s soft debut.
