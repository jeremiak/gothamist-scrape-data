										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="021017milkbar.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170213072745im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_nellcasey/021017milkbar.jpg" width="640" height="491"> <br> <i> (Milk Bar)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>It&apos;s not at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170213072745/http://gothamist.com/tags/shakeshack">Shake Shack</a> level just yet, but Christina Tosi&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170213072745/http://milkbarstore.com/">Milk Bar</a> empire continues to proliferate in NYC, today opening its 8th shop (11th globally) in the West Village. The new location took over the former home of a fetish shop at 74 Christopher Street, literally around the corner from the Big Gay Ice Cream on Grove Street. It&apos;s a battle of the soft serves, folks; Dominique Ansel&apos;s soft serve ice cream counter is also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170213072745/http://gothamist.com/2015/06/05/burrata_ice_cream_whaaat.php#photo-1">just up the block</a>. </p>

<p>But back to Tosi: expect the super decadent and buttery cookie lineup, along with truffles and cakes and, of course, soft serve. For today&apos;s opening the shop is selling cups of the cereal milk flavor for just $1, along with $1 cups of cereal milk white hot chocolate if you&apos;re a summertime-only ice cream purist (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170213072745/http://gothamist.com/2017/01/06/ice_cream_in_winter.php">which is silly</a>).</p>
