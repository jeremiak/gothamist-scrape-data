<p>After a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130727022807/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/21/inside_dumbos_new_flea_food_market.php#photo-6">successful first year</a> the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130727022807/http://www.dumbo.is/blog_posts/dumbo-cafeteria-flea-food-under-the-archway-is-back">Flea Food Under the Archway</a> is returning to Dumbo and bringing with it more lunchtime food options for the summer. From noon to 3 p.m. on Thursdays and Fridays&#x2014;starting tomorrow and running through August&#x2014;six full-time vendors set up shop in the shade of the Manhattan Bridge. </p>

Dumbo natives <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130727022807/http://littlemuenster.com/">Little Muenster</a>&#x2014;they of the fancy grilled cheese&#x2014;and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130727022807/http://www.brooklynroasting.com/">Brooklyn Roasting Company</a> also show up each week, with special guest appearances by other local eateries like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130727022807/http://www.onegirlcookies.com/">One Girl Cookies</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130727022807/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/26/punto_bianco_dumbos_latest_lunch_sp.php#photo-1">Punto Bianco</a> showing up from time to time. </p>

<p>Besides the eats, the DUMBO Improvement District, who sponsored the event, have some additional activities lined up. You can take your best shot with two holes of free mini-golf while you wait for your order. A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130727022807/http://singforhope.org/">Sing for Hope piano</a> will be stationed in the space June 1st through 16th, plus DJs and public art for some added entertainment. Sadly, there won&apos;t be any beer at this year&apos;s archway encampment, but lunch break boozing is probably frowned upon by your boss anyway.</p>
