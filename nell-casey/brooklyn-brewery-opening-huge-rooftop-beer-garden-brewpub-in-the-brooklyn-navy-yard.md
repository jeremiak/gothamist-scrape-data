					<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108030217/http://gothamist.com/tags/brooklynnavyyard">Brooklyn Navy Yard</a> has added another impressive name to its growing roster of notable NYC food businesses. The Brooklyn Brewery has signed a lease for a 75,000-square-foot space in Building 77&#x2014;the building that is currently undergoing a $185 million renovation&#x2014;where they&apos;ll expand their footprint in the borough with a beer garden, brewing facility and restaurant. The brewery signed a 40-year lease on the space, which is scheduled to open in 2018. </p>

<p>Brooklyn Brewery joins NYC-based companies including <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108030217/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/01/russ_daughters_brooklyn_navy_yard.php">Russ &amp; Daughters</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108030217/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/14/mast_brothers_navy_yard.php">Mast Brothers</a> to open production and retail facilities inside the Navy Yard. Kings County Distillery, which has been set up in the Navy Yard in 2010, also recently expanded with a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108030217/http://www.grubstreet.com/2016/05/kings-county-gatehouses-debut.html">tasting room and retail outlet</a>.</p>

<p>&quot;The Navy Yard gives us a future in Brooklyn,&quot; Brooklyn Brewery Founder Steve Hindy said in a statement. &quot;It&#x2019;s incredible to see what&#x2019;s grown around us here in Brooklyn and our long-term lease at the Yard will ensure a presence in Brooklyn alongside many similar Brooklyn entrepreneurial success stories.&quot;</p>

<p>The brewery says it plans on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108030217/http://brooklynbrewery.com/blog/brewery-expansion/bigger-badder-brooklyn-er/">staying at its Williamsburg home</a> at least through 2025, when their lease expires, despite <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108030217/http://gothamist.com/2015/04/17/brooklyn_brewerys_williamsburg_ware.php">rumors they&apos;d depart sooner</a>. They&apos;re also still in the process of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108030217/http://gothamist.com/2014/07/28/brooklyn_brewery_staten_island.php">securing land on Staten Island</a>. &quot;Once we harness all of our brewhouses, we will be able to send forth even more Brooklyn Brewery beers across the country and around the world.&quot;</p>
