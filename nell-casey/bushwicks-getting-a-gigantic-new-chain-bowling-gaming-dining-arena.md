<p>A shiny new 30,000-square-foot bowling and karaoke amusement complex will be opening at 199 Starr Street in Bushwick in the fall of 2017. Punch Bowl Social, a Denver-based company that runs adult funhouses in Portland, Austin, Cleveland and elsewhere, will be bringing bowling, dining and gaming to the warehouse space, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160507203058/http://therealdeal.com/blog/2015/12/17/punch-bowl-social-opening-first-nyc-location-in-bushwick/">reports The Real Deal</a>. They&apos;ll operate 20,000-square-feet of indoor space, in addition to building a 10,000-square-foot rooftop space. Expect to be amused to death with &quot;eight to ten bowling alleys; three private karaoke rooms-each to hold eight to 25 people; ping pong, foosball tables, skee-ball and vintage arcade games such as Pacman and Centipede,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160507203058/http://bushwickdaily.com/2015/12/bushwick-is-getting-a-huge-bowling-gastro-beverage-venue-punch-bowl-social/">according to Bushwick Daily</a>.</p>

<p>There&apos;ll be multiple bars, of course, and the company is considering a 24-hour food operation, which would be somewhat unique to that area.
