<p>Just over a year ago, Baltimore-inspired restaurant <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130823022551/http://gothamist.com/2012/08/01/inside_lake_trout_williamsburgs_hom.php#photo-11">Lake Trout</a> opened on Havemeyer Street in Wiliamsburg; three months later, the restaurant <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130823022551/http://ny.eater.com/archives/2012/12/lake_trout_1.php">closed for a revamping</a>. Lake Trout has yet to reopen its doors, but in the meantime, a vegetable-centric pop-up restaurant will serve dinner in the space two nights a week. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130823022551/http://chezjosebk.tumblr.com/">Chez Jose</a>, which operated out of nearby Whirlybird for the past year and a half, takes over the small storefront on Tuesday and Thursday nights, offering a product-focused menu of mostly vegetables and sometimes some meat or fish.</p>

<p>Chef Jose Ramirez-Ruiz&#x2014;who operates the pop-up with girlfriend Pam Yung&#x2014;told us the menu will change depending on availability, but they&apos;ll be working with friends who are farmers and foragers, so expect lots of fresh produce. Service began last week, with seatings at 7 p.m. and 9:15 p.m. Dinners run $55 and you can make a reservation by emailing chezjosebk@gmail.com.</p>
