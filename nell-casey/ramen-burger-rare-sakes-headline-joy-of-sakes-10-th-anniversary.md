<p>Leave the beer fests to the bros and savor a more refined beverage at the 10th Annual <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405190529/http://www.joyofsake.com/newyork.html">Joy of Sake</a> event, which offers samples of award-winning sakes from Japan and the United States. A record 384 vintages are on offer this year, including gold award winners from the 2013 U.S. National Sake Appraisal in Honolulu and two sakes that received perfect scores by judges during the selection process. Many of the pour-your-own sakes aren&apos;t available in the United States, giving attendees a taste they won&apos;t find elsewhere.</p>

<p>In addition to the hundreds of sakes, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405190529/http://www.joyofsake.com/newyork.html">15 chefs and restaurants</a> have created special appetizers to accompany the samplings. Momofuku Ss&#xE4;m Bar offers a Smoked Liver Mousse with Currant, Maitake, Purslane; wd-50 brings along an Edamame Gazpacho with Tofu, Pomegranate and Pickled Ramp; and most importantly to three hour line-averse diners everywhere, Keizo Shimamoto will be griddling up his signature <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405190529/http://gothamist.com/tags/ramenburger">Ramen Burgers</a>. We&apos;re not promising you won&apos;t have to wait, but at least you&apos;ll have a glass of premium sake in hand while you do.</p>

<p>The Joy of Sake takes over the Altman Building next Thursday, September 26, from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. Bought in advance, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405190529/http://www.joyofsake.com/DrawProducts.aspx?ProductID=NYTicket">tickets go for $95</a> and include samples of all the sakes as well as all the delicious appetizers and Ramen Burgers you can stuff in. Tickets can also be procured for $110 on the evening of the event.</p>
