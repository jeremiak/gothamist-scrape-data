<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160803040859/https://www.fleishers.com/l">Fleishers Craft Butcher</a> is set to expand their NYC presence this summer with the opening of a new Upper East Side retail meat market showcasing the pasture-raised meats enjoyed by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160803040859/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/29/fleishers_park_slope_location_opens.php#photo-2">patrons in Park Slope</a> for the past five years. The Red Hook-based company&#x2014;which also operates locations in Kingston, NY and in Connecticut&#x2014;is opening its next location at 1325 Third Avenue at 76th Street, where it&apos;ll sell all manner of raw, cured and prepared meat creations that&apos;ve been its hallmark since opening in 2004. In addition, expect a grocery selection of dairy products, produce and pantry staples, many of which are crafted by local brands.</p>

<p>Sustainable, hormone- and antibiotic-free meats include fresh cuts from animals like pigs and lambs, plus items Fleishers has specially prepared, including dry-aged steaks, deli meats and charcuterie they bring in from other producers. Home-cooking is encouraged&#x2014;they&apos;ll also sell stock-making items like bones&#x2014;but they&apos;re going to be offering prepared foods as well. Fleishers&apos; popular rotisserie chickens will be spit-roasted in Manhattan, too, along with meatballs, chili and other hearty stews and sauces. </p>

<p>Fun fact: former owner Joshua &quot;The MooRu&quot; Applestone&#x2014;he left the company in 2013&amp;Mdash;was vegan for 17 years before becoming a master butcher and opening the Kingston shop. Since then, the company has also been responsible for training more craft butchers, including Brooklyn butcher bigwig Tom Mylan of The Meat Hook.</p>
