<p>Upper East Siders salivating for soppressata have a new place to get their salumi on as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130920222400/http://www.salumeriarosi.com/en_ny2/home/">Salumeria Rosi Parmacotto</a> opens its second location on Madison Avenue today. If you&apos;ve visited the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130920222400/http://gothamist.com/2008/11/08/openings_roundup_indian_express_sal.php">UWS location</a>, you&apos;re familiar with the setup: part storefront and market, part restaurant and bar, all delicious and Italian. </p>

<p>Expect a similar selection of high-quality of meats, cheeses and truffles&#x2014;like aged Prosciutto San Daniele and wine soaked Ubriaco Raboso&#x2014;available to take home from the counter in front or to accompany a meal in the restaurant. Chef Casella created an expanded menu of Italian dishes inspired by Tuscan cuisine, like Tordelli with a meat ragu, rosemary-scented pork chops and a mixed seafood couscous. Even dessert takes advantage of the excellent salumi on-hand with the Caramello: chocolate cremeux with a caramel center served with vanilla gelato, balsamic and candied prosciutto. </p>

<p>The cozy, ten seat bar offers a selection of Italian wines&#x2014;over 600 varieties in all&#x2014;and American craft beers to sip alongside your Selezione del Salumiere. A special sake menu curated by Chef Casella highlights the flavors of the salumi and antipasti, and the chef hopes to expand the unique selection over time. </p>

<p>The interior design comes with an award-winning, theatrical pedigree from Dante Ferretti, who most recently won the Best Art Direction Academy Award for <em>Hugo</em> and also designed the UWS location. Instead of the ship&apos;s interior theme from across the park, the design here comes from Ferretti&apos;s interpretation of the &quot;Italy of Americans&apos; imagination;&quot; think Roman frescoes seen in the &quot;Villa of Mysteries&quot; at Pompeii mixed with iconic imagery of the grandeur of ancient Rome.</p>
