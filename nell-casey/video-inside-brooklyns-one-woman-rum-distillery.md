<p>Last November we <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130610155234/http://gothamist.com/2012/11/16/a_one-woman_rum_distillery_opens_in.php#photo-1">took a peek inside</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130610155234/http://tnenyc.com/">The Noble Experiment</a>, a rum distillery that had just opened on Meadow Street in Bushwick. Since then, TNE founder Bridget Firtle has been busy creating and bottling her rum, called Owney&apos;s, pretty much all by herself.</p>

<p>Director <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130610155234/http://www.davidmgarcia.com/">David Garcia</a> was as fascinated by her story as we were, so he decided to shoot a short film that chronicles a day in the life of a rum distillery. In the four minute film, Firtle takes us through a day in the life at the distillery, which includes driving the fork lift, pouring molasses from gigantic 700 pound barrels and sampling the rum before bottling and labeling her product. </p>

<p>Check out Firtle hard at work in the video below and then <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130610155234/http://tnenyc.com/contact/">schedule a $10 tour yourself</a> to sample her white rum for yourself!</p>
