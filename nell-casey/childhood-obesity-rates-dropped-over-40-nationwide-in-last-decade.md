                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="201107_mcdonalds.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20140307042147im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/garth/201107_mcdonalds.jpg" width="640" height="453"> <br> <i> Never forget. </i></div> <p></p>

<p>Finally some good news for our country&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140307042147/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/25/new_yorks_fatties_cost_us_12_billio.php">rapidly expanding waistlines</a>, at least for the future. A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140307042147/http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1832542">new report</a> set to be published by The Journal of the American Medical Association takes a look at the nation&apos;s obesity statistics and finds a significant decrease in obesity rates for infants and toddlers in the past decade. Somewhere in Bermuda, Michael Bloomberg sips a sugar-free diet cola and laughs arrogantly. </p>

<p>The study, authored by CDC researcher Cynthia Ogden, shows that obesity rates for children between the ages of 2- and 5-years-old dropped 43% since 2004, when rates hovered around 14% for the age group. The sample group in 2012 showed just about 8% of the age group were obese. The study was inconclusive about <em>why</em> rates changed, though less soda consumption and increased breastfeeding (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140307042147/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/14/study_breastfeeding_does_not_preven.php">or not</a>) could contribute. &quot;This is the first time we&apos;ve seen any indication of any significant decrease in any group,&quot; Ogden <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140307042147/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/26/health/obesity-rate-for-young-children-plummets-43-in-a-decade.html?emc=edit_na_20140225">told the <em>Times</em></a>. &quot;It was very exciting.&quot;</p>

<p>Before we all get too excited, though, there wasn&apos;t any good news in any other age group between 2003-2004 and 2011-2012. For the most part, levels remained even across the board except for women over 60, who showed an increase from 31.5% to about 38%. Just can&apos;t catch a freaking break, amirite ladies?</p>
