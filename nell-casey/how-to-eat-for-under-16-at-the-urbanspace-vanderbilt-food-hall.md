<p><em>New York City boasts <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170113000222/http://gothamist.com/2015/11/10/guide_to_nyc_food_halls.php">dozens of delicious food halls</a> where one can indulge in almost any type of craving, from decadent bowls of ramen to healthful smoothies and even a well-deserved beer, in many cases. It can be a challenge to choose, given so many options, and impulsive purchases can also lead to a doozy of a bill when a meal is finally assembled.</em></p>

<p><em>Here, our quick and dirty guide to eating a meal (entree plus drink and side/dessert) at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170113000222/http://urbanspacenyc.com/urbanspace-vanderbilt/">Urbanspace Vanderbilt</a>, the food hall near Grand Central Terminal, for under $16.</em></p>

<p><strong>THE TANGY TACO</strong></p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="032816takumi.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170113000222im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_nellcasey/032816takumi.jpeg" width="640" height="427"> <br> <i> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170113000222/https://twitter.com/scottheins">Scott Heins</a>/Gothamist)</i></div> <p></p>

<p><strong>Meal:</strong> Shortrib and Carnitas tacos from Takumi Taco ($10.50), lemonade from Red Hook Lobster Pound ($3.27) and chocolate chip cookie from Roberta&apos;s ($2.18)</p>

<p><strong>Total Cost:</strong> $15.95</p>

<p>The tacos from Takumi are packed with protein, making them a filling choice even if you&apos;re only eating two and they&apos;ll even give you a side of seasoned tortilla chips on the house. The lemonade is a great foil for the meaty, savory taco fillings and there&apos;s never a bad time to eat a chocolate chip cookie. </p>

<p><strong>THE CASUAL PARISIAN</strong></p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="32816parisian.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170113000222im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_nellcasey/32816parisian.jpeg" width="640" height="427"> <br> <i> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170113000222/https://twitter.com/scottheins">Scott Heins</a>/Gothamist)</i></div> <p></p>

<p><strong>Meal:</strong> Truffled Mozzarella crepe from Bar Suzette ($8.71), hibiscus doughnut from Dough ($3) and espresso from Toby&apos;s Estate ($3)</p>

<p><strong>Total Cost:</strong> $14.71</p>

<p>Inside that tender crepe is salty, melted mozzarella that&apos;s been studded with black pepper and given a drizzle of black truffle oil. This vegetarian meal&#x2014;a subtle tip of the beret to France&#x2014;also includes an enormous, fluffy doughnut from Dough and a quick shot of espresso, which you&apos;ll need after wolfing down the two other items in this meal.</p>

<p><strong>THE PICNIC BASKET</strong></p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="032816picnic.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170113000222im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_nellcasey/032816picnic.jpeg" width="640" height="427"> <br> <i> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170113000222/https://twitter.com/scottheins">Scott Heins</a>/Gothamist)</i></div> <p></p>

<p><strong>Menu:</strong> Original Chicken Sandwich from Delaney Chicken ($8.71), Dirty Chips from Mayhem &amp; Stout ($2) and Sparkling Cranberry soda from Mimi&apos;s Hummus</p>

<p><strong>Total Cost:</strong> $13.98</p>

<p>Many picnic baskets include some form of fried chicken, so we&apos;re starting with the juicy fried chicken thigh sandwich topped with pickles and mayo from Daniel Delaney&apos;s newish chicken venture. To that, some crunchy kettle chips procured from nearby stall Mayhem &amp; Stout and finally, a refreshing house-made cranberry soda to complete the checkered blanket trifecta. </p>
