<p>Chicago mayor Rahm Emanuel was not going to let Jon Stewart&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508155410/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/14/jon_stewart_pizza_chicago.php">scathing takedown of Chicago&apos;s &quot;pizza&quot;</a> go gently into that good night.

<p>NBC Chicago recalls that this isn&apos;t the first time Emanuel has used &quot;fishy&quot; tactics to get back at opponents; during his mayoral run, Emanuel confirmed long-held rumors that he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508155410/http://www.nbcchicago.com/blogs/ward-room/emanuel-dead-fish-mail-116281389.html">mailed a dead fish</a> to a pollster who crossed him.</p>

<p>Without missing a beat, Stewart and Co turned the prank right back on Emanuel, tweeting a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508155410/https://vine.co/v/htuPhpgwQpV">hilarious Vine</a> of a fluffy pooch that&apos;s disgusted enough to leave the room when presented with the noxious &quot;pie.&quot;</p>
