<p>This city won&apos;t soon forget the uproar following our newly minted mayor&apos;s apparent fork-pas last Friday when he was documented <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506022004/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/10/honeymoons_over_de_blasio_spotted_e.php">eating pizza with a knife and fork</a>. The visit to Staten Island&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506022004/http://www.goodfellas.com/">Goodfella&apos;s Pizza</a> caused an uproar on the Internet, with most admonishing the mayor for his non-New Yorker pizza style. The pizzeria&apos;s owners, Marc and Scot Cosentino, took everything in stride, however, telling reporters, &quot;fork and knife is the best way, we make gourmet pizza.&quot; The mayor was enjoying a smoked mozzarella creation at the time of the incident. </p>

<p>The brothers are used to serving pizza to mayors&#x2014;even <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506022004/https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=216117162846&amp;set=pb.52420042846.-2207520000.1389636620.&amp;type=3&amp;theater">health-conscious Bloomberg</a>!&#x2014;but they took special care of the infamous de Blasio utensil nonetheless. It&apos;s being kept <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506022004/http://pizziolo.blogspot.com/2014/01/new-york-brick-oven-company-implicated.html?spref=fb&amp;m=1">inside an NYPD evidence bag</a>, provided by Marc Cosentino, a former NYPD sergeant. The pizzaiolo <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506022004/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/01/13/new-york-today-hows-he-doing/?_r=0#more-473596">told the Times</a> the fork was washed prior to entry into the bag. &quot;The only thing we have is the chain of evidence,&#x201D; he joked.</p>

<p>The fork will stay behind the bar at the pizzeria for now, where people have already been coming in to be photographed with it. On his blog, Cosentino says the fork will ultimately be used <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506022004/http://pizziolo.blogspot.com/2014/01/new-york-brick-oven-company-implicated.html?spref=fb&amp;m=1">in a fundraiser</a> for de Blasio. </p>
