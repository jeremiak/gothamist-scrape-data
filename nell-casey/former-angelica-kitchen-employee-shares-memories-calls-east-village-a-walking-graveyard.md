<p>On Friday, beloved vegan restaurant and farm-to-table early adopter Angelica Kitchen <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170407070544/http://gothamist.com/2017/03/23/rip_angelica_kitchen.php">will close</a>, concluding a 40-year run in the East Village. We recently <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170407070544/http://gothamist.com/2017/03/27/angelica_kitchen_leslie_mceachern.php">spoke with owner Leslie McEachern</a> about Angelica&apos;s history and watching the neighborhood change through the restaurant&apos;s large glass windows. Now a former employee has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170407070544/http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-east-village-loses-the-angelica-kitchen-another-place-for-the-young-hungry-and-weird">penned an essay for <em>The New Yorker</em></a> recalling the restaurant&apos;s employees and celebrity clientele, as well as meditating on the &quot;walking graveyard&quot; that&apos;s become the East Village.</p>

<p>&quot;If C.B.G.B.&#x2019;s was the sour rock-and-roll heart of the neighborhood, Angelica Kitchen was its weird and wonderful and slightly embarrassing hippie soul,&quot; declares Jay Sacher in the very touching <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170407070544/http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-east-village-loses-the-angelica-kitchen-another-place-for-the-young-hungry-and-weird">piece</a>. </p>

<p>Sacher worked for Angelica Kitchen in the mid-90&apos;s as a delivery guy schlepping juices and food to the likes of Joey Ramone. Celebrities were a regular fixture, Sacher recalls. &quot;Willem Dafoe, who&#x2019;d come in with his yoga mat and his curly-haired teen-age son, who looked like the kid from &apos;The Blue Lagoon,&apos; both of them setting the waitresses&#x2019; hearts aflutter. I once got into an inadvertent bike race with Mike D from the Beastie Boys, another genial regular.&quot; </p>

<p>Sacher once told Anthony Kiedis&apos;s &quot;people&quot;: &quot;When Anthony gets here, he can come put his name on the list. It&#x2019;s about a half-hour wait for a table right now,&quot; which is very charming&#x2014;though he admits to giving Madonna special treatment. You don&apos;t keep <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170407070544/http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/music/drake-celebrates-madonna-session-article-1.2184480">royalty</a> waiting.</p>

<p>It&apos;s Sacher&apos;s reflections on the people with whom he worked that paint the clearest picture of Angelica&apos;s spirit, which began with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170407070544/http://gothamist.com/2017/03/27/angelica_kitchen_leslie_mceachern.php">a bartering model</a> in the restaurant&apos;s early days that seems to have set the tone. </p>

<blockquote>Spencer, always walking into work with a purple plastic Kim&#x2019;s Video bag in one hand, stuffed full of records&#x2014;a man of obscure and eclectic musical tastes who was prone to saying things like, &#x201C;The only good Beatles song is &#x2018;Norwegian Wood.&#x2019; &#x201D; There was Dexter, a tall Trinidadian with a beaming smile, who unofficially ran the kitchen. Somehow, in between working at the restaurant seemingly 24/7, caring for his young daughter, and waking up at 5 a.m. to do yoga, he had the time to be on a first-name basis with every attractive woman who came in the door. Genuine supermodels would peek their heads into the juice bar, all with the same question: &#x201C;Is Dexter working?&#x201D; Last I heard, Dexter was Erykah Badu&#x2019;s personal chef.</blockquote>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="032417leslie1.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170407070544im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_nellcasey/032417leslie1.jpg" width="640" height="480"> <br> <i> Angelica owner Leslie McEachern at the restaurant (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170407070544/https://www.facebook.com/pg/Angelica-Kitchen-100869503290748/photos/?ref=page_internal">Facebook</a>)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>Recollections of McEachern include the early &quot;suspicion of the boss [that] runs deep, especially in restaurant work,&quot; but ultimately, Sacher declares her a &quot;glorious hero&quot; with unwavering &quot;commitment to sustainable food and farmers.&quot;</p>

<p>Sacher shares a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170407070544/http://gothamist.com/2017/03/27/angelica_kitchen_leslie_mceachern.php">similarly disheartening vision</a> of the future of the East Village with McEachern. &quot;After April 7th, I don&#x2019;t think I will want to walk down East Twelfth Street and see paper over those plate-glass windows, awaiting a bank or a CVS, or, like St. Mark&#x2019;s Bookshop down the street, probably an empty storefront for months on end,&quot; he writes. &quot;The East Village has been a walking graveyard for years now, sputtering along as a cover-band version of itself.&quot;</p>

<p>On a lighter note, if there was any doubt about seitan, the rubbery wheat-gluten favored in fake meat communities, Sacher confirms we should be suspicious: &quot;Just save yourself a step and throw it in the toilet.&quot;</p>
