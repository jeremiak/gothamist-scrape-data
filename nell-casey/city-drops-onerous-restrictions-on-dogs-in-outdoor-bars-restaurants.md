<p>Passing legislation to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108031110/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/27/dogs_have_their_day.php">allow dogs in outdoor sections of bars and restaurants</a> was one of the best things Albany accomplished last year, and it&apos;s now going to be a bit easier to manage for said food service establishments. </p>

<p>Despite support from numerous law-makers and restaurant owners, the Health Department was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108031110/http://gothamist.com/2015/06/01/doh_dogs_outside_womp_womp.php">less than thrilled</a> with the move, proposing a rule that restaurant owners would have to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108031110/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/nyc-accused-neuter-dog-restaurant-law-article-1.2500997">check for licenses</a> that dogs had been vaccinated and registered. As of today, however, the Health Department has nixed those requirements, and pooches can now chill freely without producing paperwork.</p>

<p>Instead of carrying around registration and vaccination information, dog parents can bring their wards into any outdoor cafe or bar that permits dogs on the premises. Participating restaurants will be required to post a notice about licensed dogs but won&apos;t be required to verify each animal that trots across its threshold. </p>

<p>&quot;Restaurants must also use barriers or other methods to limit contact between dogs in the outdoor dining area and dogs and people on an adjacent sidewalk,&quot; the Health Department said in a statement and dogs also won&apos;t be allowed to slobber on or touch any dining surfaces. </p>

<p>&quot;These proposed regulations are common sense measures designed to protect the public health while allowing New Yorkers to dine with their dogs,&quot; the bill&apos;s sponsor, Assemblywoman Linda Rosenthal, said in a statement. And now, animals lovers are starting the countdown for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108031110/http://gothamist.com/2015/04/30/best_backyard_drinks_nyc.php">outdoor drinking season</a>.</p>
