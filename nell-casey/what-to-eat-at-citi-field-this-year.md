					<p>It used to be that a trip to the ballpark meant a hot dog, a big plastic cup of expensive beer and maybe a bag of peanuts (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170913041413/https://youtu.be/8WHiKshporM?t=5m17s">for earners</a>). Now, it&apos;s Saffron Risotto Balls and Angus Ribeye Cheesesteaks or GTFO.</p>

<p>Since its inception, Citi Field has put Yankee Stadium to <em><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170913041413/http://gothamist.com/2015/04/06/baseball_stadium_food.php">shame</a></em>&#x2014;off the field, at least&#x2014;with its dizzying array of global foods. The Yanks might have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170913041413/http://gothamist.com/2014/04/14/yankees_nacho_helmet.php">my beloved Nacho Helmet</a>, but the Mets really want to get you well-fed. Ball game? I&apos;m just here for the Pan Seared Cod in Littleneck Clam and Smoked Bacon Chowder.</p>

<p>Each year, the stadium adds new options for an ever more discerning baseball fan. Below, some of the new eats and treats available when you&apos;re rooting for (one of the) home team(s).</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="032417Mozz.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170913041413im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_nellcasey/032417Mozz.jpg" width="640" height="427"> <br> <i> Big Mozz (Scott Heins/Gothamist)</i></div> <p></p>

<p><strong>Big Mozz</strong> is some of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170913041413/http://gothamist.com/2017/03/16/nyc_best_fried_foods_2017.php">best fried food in NYC</a> and now you can get it on the regs at Citi Field. Their hand-made mozzarella sticks will go <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170913041413/https://twitter.com/darrenrovell/status/844945544309018624">four for $10</a>, which is pricey, but each stick is about two times the size of your average pub grub joint. <em>Located on the Promenade</em></p>

<p>Josh Capon, a burger master and restaurateur with four NYC restaurants under his belt, will be slinging three different burgers at Citi Field. There&apos;s the namesake <strong>Bash Burger</strong> (six ounce Pat LaFrieda patty, onion and bacon jam, pickles, American cheese, special sauce), the Double Barrel (two four ounce Pat LaFrieda patties, American cheese, fried onions, pickles, secret sauce) and the Classic (six ounce Pat LaFrieda patty, lettuce, tomato, pickles, American cheese, special sauce). <em> Located on the Field Level concourse behind Section 135</em></p>

<p><strong>Catch of the Day</strong> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170913041413/http://gothamist.com/2015/04/06/baseball_stadium_food.php">isn&apos;t a newcomer</a> to the ball park but they are doing two completely new menu items this year. The South Bay Lobster Tacos come with Maine lobster, tomatillo-avocado salsa, citrus slaw, queso fresco and jalapeno in a sharp jack cheese and white corn tortilla shell. The Loaded Bayside Fries took a page from the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170913041413/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/03/lobster_bisque_fries_is_poutine_for.php#photo-1">Lobster Bisque Fries</a> handbook, topping the Bayside frites with cracker crumb-dredged Cherrystone clam strips and clam chowder fondue. <em>Located adjacent to Section 102 on the Field Level concourse.</em></p>

<p>Chef Michael White&apos;s bringing his pizza concept <strong>Nicoletta</strong> into the stadium this year, but instead of pies it&apos;s Chicken Parmesan heroes made with stracciatella cheese, stromboli roll-ups in Calabrese (sausage, pepperoni, mozzarella and red onion) and Classica (tomato, mozzarella and basil) options, Mozzarella and Pepperoni Sticks, and soft serve &quot;gelato.&quot; <em>Located in Taste of the City beyond the centerfield scoreboard on the Field Level concourse</em></p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="032417boots.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170913041413im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_nellcasey/032417boots.jpg" width="640" height="427"> <br> <i> V for Vegan pie from Two Boots (Scott Heins/Gothamist)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>Also in the new/not new category is <strong>Two Boots</strong>, who&apos;ve been holding strong at Citi Field with their funky pizza offerings. For 2017 they&apos;ve introduced The Queen of Queens pizza, a white pie topped with creole chicken, broccoli, fresh garlic, cherry tomatoes and fresh basil. Their stands are also where vegan folks should head for their V for Vegan Slice with artichokes, shiitake mushrooms, red onions, pesto and Daiya non-dairy cheese. <em>Available at various locations around the ballpark including in the Foxwoods Club and in the Promenade Level Food Court behind home plate.</em></p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="032417do.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170913041413im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_nellcasey/032417do.jpg" width="640" height="427"> <br> <i> DO cookie dough confections (Scott Heins/Gothamist)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>Will there be four hour lines at the DO <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170913041413/http://gothamist.com/2017/01/19/raw_cookie_dough_shop_nyc.php">&quot;raw&quot; cookie dough</a> stand? Only time will tell! But after waiting you will find three flavors of safe-to-eat raw cookie dough in cones including Signature Chocolate Chip; Cake Batter with sprinkles, white chips and chocolate chips; and Sugar cookie. They&apos;ll also offer more traditional scoops of vanilla ice cream. <em>Located inside the Promenade Club.</em></p>
