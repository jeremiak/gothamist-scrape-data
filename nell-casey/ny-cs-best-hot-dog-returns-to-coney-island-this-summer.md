<p>New York City hot dog royalty returns to its origins this summer with word that the recently revived Feltman&apos;s brand will return to Coney Island. Feltman&apos;s will reopen on the site of its former glory at Surf Avenue and West 10th, as well as a kiosk inside Luna Park, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170404014528/http://www.theconeyislandblog.com/?p=3661">according to The Coney Island Blog</a>. Michael Quinn, owner of Feltman&apos;s of Coney Island, LLC, confirms the news.</p>

<p>Feltman&apos;s originally operated on Coney Island <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170404014528/http://gothamist.com/2015/04/14/feltmans_coney_island_returns.php">beginning in 1867</a>, when German immigrant Charles Feltman began a pushcart operation that sold food to sunbathers on the beach. Feltman ultimately created the world&apos;s largest restaurant complex at the time, with 4,000 gas lamps, 12 restaurants, 2 bars, and the most famous carousel in America. (He also famously employed a young Nathan Handwerker, who went on to start rival business Nathan&apos;s just a few blocks away).</p>

<p>The Feltman&apos;s era on Coney Island ended in 1954&#x2014;you can listen to an interview with Feltman&apos;s great-grandson <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170404014528/http://www.coneyislandhistory.org/oral-history-archive/charles-robert-feltman">here</a>&#x2014;but Quinn resurrected the brand through pop-ups and eventually <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170404014528/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/17/hot_dog_creator_feltmans_now_servin.php">opened an East Village location</a> serving up the famous franks that are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170404014528/http://gothamist.com/2016/08/23/best_hot_dog_ever_man.php#photo-1">some of the city&apos;s best</a>. </p>

<p>&quot;The hot dogs will be prepared the same way as East Village,&quot; Quinn tells us of his plans for Coney Island. &quot;We&apos;re going to replicate the same items including the popular Al Capone Hot Dog. Michael&apos;s of Brooklyn restaurant will be providing the vodka sauce in Coney Island as they do for our East Village location.&quot; There will also be non-hot dog items on the menu, including chicken and french fries. </p>
