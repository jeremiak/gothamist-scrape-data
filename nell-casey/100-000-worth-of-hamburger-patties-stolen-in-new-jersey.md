<p>Between the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130515064343/http://www.theatlanticwire.com/global/2013/04/there-secret-nutella-black-market/63983/">$20,710 Nutella-napping</a> and the attempted <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130515064343/http://gawker.com/5994137/florida-man-steals-truck-carrying-75000-in-campbells-soup-has-brief-low+sodium-joy-ride">$75,000 Campbell&apos;s Soup caper</a> it&apos;s been a banner week for food felonies. Now NJ.com reports that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130515064343/http://www.nj.com/union/index.ssf/2013/04/thieves_steal_shipping_contain.html">a shipping container worth $100,000 in hamburger meat</a> was stolen from a shipping yard on Monday night. The hamburger heist went down at BMG Logistics in Linden, NJ, where thieves hauled the container out by truck and headed for the most epic backyard barbecue the Garden State has ever seen.</p>

<p>The 40-foot refrigerated container was storing 3,000 containers of burger meat and was supposed to ship to the Netherlands for distribution at Hilton hotels abroad. That&apos;s a pretty long journey for some ground up cow&#x2014;guess they want to be sure it&apos;s definitely <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130515064343/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/25/ikea_finds_horse_in_its_meatballs_i.php">not horse meat</a>! </p>

<p>Linden police are currently looking for suspects&#x2014;hopefully they&apos;re looking into the most obvious candidate:</p>
