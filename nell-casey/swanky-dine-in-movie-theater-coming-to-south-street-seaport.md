<p>We&apos;ve barely had time to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160117153933/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/01/alamo_drafthouse_no_longer_coming_t.php">forget the Alamo</a> and now there&apos;s a shiny new dine-in movie theater set to fill the giant hole in our hearts. Swanky movie theater chain IPic will open a 40,000 square foot dine-in complex at the South Street Seaport in 2015, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160117153933/http://nypost.com/2013/12/23/dinner-and-a-movie-theater-headed-for-south-street-seaport/">according to the Post</a>. Howard Hughes Corp rented the space at 11 Fulton Street&#x2014;site of the events space that housed the gruesome and fascinating Bodies exhibit until Hurricane Sandy&#x2014;where the chain will operate an eight-auditorium, 505-seat enterprise.</p>

<p>Chains usually change things up when they arrive in Manhattan, so it&apos;s unclear if this iteration will also have the accompanying bar and wine tasting rooms featured in the other locations. What it will have are special aisles for servers to scuttle through, but instead of the pencil-and-paper operation <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160117153933/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/24/inside_nitehawk_cinema_williamsburg.php#photo-1">a la Nitehawk</a>, each guests will have a special call button to summon servers from the darkness to refill their martini glass. They&apos;ll serve food too, of course, like mini pizzas, coconut shrimp and filet mignon sliders. </p>

<p>Promotional video from a previous location reveals some fully-reclining seats just like the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160117153933/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/04/nycs_worst_movie_theater_was_renova.php#photo-1">revamped AMC on the UWS</a>, and moviegoers in the premium seats also received blankets and pillows, which have hopefully <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160117153933/http://gothamist.com/2010/08/18/amc_empire_25_movie_theater_removes.php">been sanitized</a>. </p>
