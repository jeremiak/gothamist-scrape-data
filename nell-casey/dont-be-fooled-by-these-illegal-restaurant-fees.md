<p>The elimination of tipping&#x2014;and the push for a living wage&#x2014;is undoubtably where the service industry is headed, and should make the experience of paying even easier: no awkward sprints back to the table after Uncle Earl leaves his customary 15% and, most importantly, no math. But in the transition, as different restaurants employ different methods, there&apos;s bound to be confusion. Administrative fee, service included, hospitality included, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170317214831/http://ny.eater.com/2015/12/1/9824098/frannys-pizza-brooklyn-obamacare-surcharge">Obamacare surcharges</a> and now &quot;Surcharge Mandates,&quot; as applied by a Manhattan restaurant. </p>

<p>Hillstone, which operates two Manhattan locations and others on Long Island, had been applying a 2% line item to guest checks billed as a &quot;Surcharge Mandate&quot; until today. The restaurant&apos;s vice president <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170317214831/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Hillstone-Restaurant-New-York-City-Receipt-New-York-State-Minimum-Wage-Mandate-Surcharge-364195101.html">told NBC New York</a> they didn&apos;t want to &quot;hide these increased operational costs in our menu prices such that our guests might then question the value of what we offer.&quot; Though they don&apos;t say so explicitly, it&apos;s likely the state&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170317214831/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/01/fighting_to_be_the_little_guy.php">increased minimum wage</a> may have spawned the fee.</p>

<p>While other major cities like Los Angeles are accustomed to surcharges of this variety, the practice isn&apos;t legal in New York City, according to the Department of Consumer Affairs. The DCA didn&apos;t immediately return requests for comment on how a restaurant would be disciplined for employing the fee, but an attorney told NBC it would likely be around $500 per plate. Apparently, the only time the DCA investigates is following a complaint from a customer who observes the illegal fee.</p>

<p>It&apos;s unsurprising that restaurants are trying whatever they can to both guarantee a living wage for their employees while also trying to offset what will inevitably be increased operational costs. While some restaurants employ the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170317214831/http://gothamist.com/2014/11/21/dirt_candy_tipping.php">administrative fee</a>&#x2014;a percentage of the bill tacked on at the end&#x2014;others are making bolder steps by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170317214831/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/14/no_tipping_danny_meyer.php">raising menu prices</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170317214831/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/01/one_of_nycs_most_expensive_restaura.php">building in employee wages</a> to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170317214831/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/16/marlow_sons_diner_and_romans_to_end.php">base cost of the meal</a>. </p>

<p>For big name restaurants like Eleven Madison Park, restaurateurs like Danny Meyer and neighborhood joints like Diner, destination diners and loyal fans are likely tuned in to the changes; for restaurants in more touristy spots, like Hillstone, it may take more time to get the message out.</p>
