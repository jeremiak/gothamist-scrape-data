<p>We can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160614002041/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/22/rescue_dogs_cats_video.php#photo-1">live with cats</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160614002041/http://gothamist.com/2014/12/15/meow_parlour_opens.php">dine with cats</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160614002041/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/29/les_cat_cafe_nyc_koneko.php#photo-1">drink with cats</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160614002041/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/05/photos_21_of_our_newest_favorite_bo.php#photo-1">shop with cats</a> and, starting this Friday, we can watch movies with cats. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160614002041/http://www.konekonyc.com/">Koneko</a>, a newish LES cat cafe that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160614002041/http://gothamist.com/2015/08/06/new_les_cat_cafe.php">serves alcohol</a>, begins a new movie night this week so felines and their friends can chill out and enjoy some cinema in the cafe&apos;s cozy cattery. </p>

<p>All the films boast feline co-stars of some kind, beginning with <em>Breakfast at Tiffany&apos;s</em> with Patsy Award-winning <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160614002041/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orangey">Orangey</a>, followed by the kooky Johnny Depp version of <em>Alice in Wonderland</em> on January 14th and then <em>The Future</em> on January 28th. The final of the first wave may be Miranda July&apos;s <em><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160614002041/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2FuwJh8DSs">The Future</a></em>, where the adoption of a cat serves as the film&apos;s story catalyst.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160614002041/http://www.konekonyc.com/reservation">Tickets</a> for each film run $30 and include entry, popcorn, a glass of beer, wine, tea or coffee and &quot;as many cats as will fit in your lap&quot; of the adoptable kitties on hand. Challenge accepted. </p>
