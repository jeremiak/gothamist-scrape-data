					<p>The line stretched down the block on 7th Avenue today, further clogging up an already congested section of Midtown. The queue&apos;s destination? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170415111611/http://carnegiedeli.com/">Carnegie Deli</a>, the overstuffed sandwich haunt that&apos;ll <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170415111611/http://gothamist.com/2016/12/28/rip_bars_restaurants_2016.php">close the book</a> on nearly eight decades this Saturday. Around 11 a.m., the quoted wait time for a seat was around two hours.</p>

<p>&quot;I was devastated,&quot; Marti Purifico&#x2014;who traveled from Philadelphia with her husband Joe specifically to eat at Carnegie today&#x2014;told us how she felt this afternoon after hearing the closure news. &quot;I love sitting here, you meet all kinds of people. It&apos;s good. We&apos;ve only been here, we&apos;ve never gone to any other delis. This is all we know.&quot; </p>

<p>Carnegie Deli, so named for its proximity to the famed concert hall, opened in 1937, eventually becoming famous for its featured role in Woody Allen&apos;s 1984 film <em>Broadway Danny Rose</em> and a Times review that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170415111611/http://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2016/12/26/506609884/after-8-decades-and-countless-pastrami-sandwiches-new-yorks-carnegie-deli-folds">put its pastrami</a> on the map. While the restaurant serves a bevy of Jewish staples&#x2014;from latkes to smoked fish to chopped liver&#x2014;the deli meats and sandwiches are the main draw, particularly the pastrami, which was part of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170415111611/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/18/theft_accusations_pile_on_adulterou.php">theft accusations</a> leveled at Sandy Levine by his ex-wife Marian Harper, who inherited the restaurant from her father.</p>

<p>Upon hearing that Carnegie would close, Vincent Marciante took off work and traveled from Long Island specifically to pay his respects. &quot;I really like the whole New York, Woody Allen-esque deal. The old time people. No bullshit,&quot; he explained. &quot;It&apos;s a really good sandwich that costs more money than you&apos;d usually pay, but there&apos;s nothing not good about it.&quot;</p>

<p>Jake Dell, proprietor of &quot;rival&quot; Katz&apos;s Delicatessen downtown, agrees, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170415111611/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/28/opinion/as-the-carnegie-deli-serves-its-last-pastrami-on-rye.html">telling the Times</a> he&apos;s &quot;deeply saddened to witness the disappearance of a fellow culinary landmark.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>Now more than ever, we recognize how important it is for us to maintain our culture&apos;s time-honored food traditions. For generations, Carnegie and Katz&apos;s have been a united front. We have cured, smoked and steamed meats, fried up latkes, boiled matzo balls and whipped up frothy chocolate egg creams just as our grandmothers did. Most important, we&apos;ve served it all up with just the right amount of guff to our loyal customers.</blockquote>

<p>Other natives made the pilgrimage for one last fat stack of meat. Angela Murray, who grew up in the Bronx, shared fond memories of Carnegie. &quot;It just makes me feel bad. All these great institutions are going away,&quot; she said. &quot;I used to come here with my mother when I was 8, 9 years old.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;In the Bronx, there used to be all these great delis, and they&apos;re gone now. Things are changing, it&apos;s the same way with great Italian food, the old pizzerias here. It&apos;s just a change, and change is hard,&quot; she continued. &quot;This is something you really miss.&quot;</p>

<p>Though its <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170415111611/http://gothamist.com/tags/carnegiedeli">recent rockiness</a> has been well-documented, Harper insists the shutter has nothing to do with finances. &quot;I&apos;m at that certain age where I want to enjoy my life, and I want to do certain things,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170415111611/http://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2016/12/26/506609884/after-8-decades-and-countless-pastrami-sandwiches-new-yorks-carnegie-deli-folds">she told NPR</a>. &quot;And all good things must come to an end.&quot;</p>
