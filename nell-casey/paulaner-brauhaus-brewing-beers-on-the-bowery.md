</div></div>					<p>Steins at the ready, folks, as a massive new brewery-beer hall has flown from Germany to land on the Bowery. Munich&apos;s 375-year-old <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429153915/http://www.paulaner-brauhaus.com/nyc">Paulanuer Brauhaus</a> opened the satellite microbrewery&#x2014;their first in the United States&#x2014;last month, where they&apos;ll be brewing six of their special recipes created by Bavarian Monks. And even though they&apos;re on American soil, the brewery will still follow Germany&apos;s Beer Purity Law, established in 1516, which decrees that beer can only contain water, hops, malt and yeast; no freaky blueberry junk allowed here.</p>

<p>The brewery has the capacity to turn out around 1,700 barrels of beer annually, which it will store in five dispensing tanks that connect directly to the taps at the bar via pipes in the main seating area. On tap they&apos;ll have their Munich Lager and Munich Dark, plus a Hefeweizen for wheat beer fans. Two seasonal brews&#x2014;Maibock and Octoberfest&#x2014;also show up during their respective times.  Finally, the Paulaner Salvator Beer packs a serious 7.9% ABV and was originally brewed to replace food during the Lenten fasting. Pro tip: drinking high ABV beers without eating not recommended!</p>

<p>Luckily, they&apos;ve got some bites on hand, with a focus on Bavarian flavors and ingredients of course. Eat some wurst packed with pork chicken, lamb and veal; lots of funky sauerkrauts and other cabbage-based sides; plus carb-heavy treats like pretzels, latkes and potato soup. Prosit! </p>
