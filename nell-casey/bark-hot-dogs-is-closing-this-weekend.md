<p>After seven years in Park Slope, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160630054411/http://gothamist.com/2014/07/02/the_10_best_hot_dogs_in_nyc.php">top shelf tubed meat purveyor</a> Bark Hot Dogs is closing up shop. The restaurant sent word to customers and friends this morning via email, revealing that their final day in business will be Superbowl Sunday this coming weekend. &quot;We are really proud of what we have accomplished as a restaurant and a part of the community, and hope that we have helped in some way to change the perception of what fast food can and should be.&quot;</p>

<p>The hot dog makers had expanded into Manhattan in recent years, including a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160630054411/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/07/bark_hot_dogs_bringing_their_meat_t.php">High Line extension</a> and a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160630054411/http://gothamist.com/2014/12/02/bark_greenwich_village.php">Greenwich Village outpost</a>. The latter lasted <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160630054411/http://ny.eater.com/2015/11/17/9750240/bark-greenwich-village-closes">just six months</a> on Bleecker Street before closing, with owner Josh Sharkey telling eater the &quot;economics just weren&#x2019;t working out.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;As with any business, there were many factors involved and it was the just right time for us to say goodbye,&quot; Sharkey told us via email today, noting that the closure &quot;was not due to the lease, we have a great relationship with our landlord Mr. Pintchik, they have been a huge support and great friends over the years.&quot; </p>

<p>For their final week, Bark will be selling their house-made condiments, relishes, pickles and hot dogs for $5 per pound as a way to enjoy some of the restaurant after they&apos;re gone. Sadly, Sharkey tells us there are &quot;no plans for new locations in the very immediate future,&quot; so stop by before Sunday for what looks to be the last taste.  </p>
