<p>New York City cured meat royalty Katz&apos;s Delicatessen has spent 125 years building its name as the top pastrami slinger in the city, so owners weren&apos;t keen on some upstart trying to horn in on their brand. The legendary restaurant has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505142655/http://nypost.com/2014/03/12/katzs-deli-suing-pastrami-truck-for-stealing-name/">filed a lawsuit</a> against a group of pastrami-selling food trucks dubbed &quot;Katz &amp; Dogz&quot; who the <em>real</em> Katz&apos;s say are ripping off their name, according to the Post. </p>

<p>&#x201C;It has taken over a century of dedication, hard work and consistent customer satisfaction for Katz&#x2019;s Deli to become famous,&#x201D; notes the trademark-infringement suit; the restaurant worries customers won&apos;t realize they&apos;re not getting &quot;the same Jewish deli foods&quot; they&apos;d find at the Houston street original. Besides the obvious name ripoff, the food truck <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505142655/http://midtownlunch.com/2013/09/23/katz-n-dogz-is-a-jewish-deli-on-wheels/">sells a &quot;Reuben Orgasm&quot; sandwich</a>&#x2014;now why does that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505142655/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/12/flash_orgasm_mob_takes_over_katzs_b.php">sound so familiar</a>?</p>

<p>This lawsuit comes after some back-and-forth between the two parties, including an offer by Katz&apos;s Deli to pay for the food trucks to be repainted without the Katz name. Talks failed and the restaurant filed a $1 million dollar lawsuit in Manhattan federal court on Wednesday against the Brooklyn-based TMA Trading Inc., which operates the trucks. Katz &amp; Dogz did not immediately respond to a request for comment. </p>
