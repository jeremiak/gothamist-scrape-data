<p>The minds behind Smorgasburg and Brooklyn Flea have expanded their growing empire of fun food markets with a new venture in Crown Heights that will be part food court, part beer hall. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509140841/http://www.bergn.com/">Berg&apos;n</a>, which is set to debut in March, brings some familiar faces from the Smorgasburg family to an industrial stretch of Bergen Street as part of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509140841/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/28/photos_brooklyn_flea_founder_is_ope.php#photo-1">large creative hub</a> they&apos;re operating on the same site. They&apos;ve also tapped one of New York&apos;s biggest names in beer to curate their brews: Brooklyn Brewery&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509140841/http://gothamist.com/2005/05/31/garrett_oliver_brooklyn_brewmaster.php">Garrett Oliver</a>. </p>

<p>The brewmaster selected the 12 tap beers plus some bottles for the winter/spring offerings. The selection will rotate seasonally with a few favorites remaining permanently. Here&apos;s the opening lineup:</p>

<p><strong>Draft</strong><br>
Allagash Black<br>
Greenport Black Duck Porter<br>
La Chouffe<br>
Brooklyn Sorachi Ace<br>
Captain Lawrence Liquid Gold<br>
De La Senne Taras Boulba<br>
Avery Ellie&#x2019;s Brown Ale<br>
Brooklyn BLAST!<br>
Firestone Walker Union Jack<br>
Brooklyn Brewmaster&apos;s Reserve<br>
Hill Farmstead Arthur<br>
New Holland Dragon&apos;s Milk<br>
 <br>
<strong>Bottles</strong><br>
Brooklyn &quot;Ghost Bottles,&quot; including bottle-conditioned versions of Brewmaster&apos;s Reserve and &quot;Worshipful Company of Brewers&quot; series beers</p>

<p>1809 Berliner Weisse, Fritz Briem<br>
Hanssens Gueuze<br>
A. Le Coq Imperial Extra Double Stout<br>
AMA Speciale Riserva</p>

<p>Once completed, the space will have seating for 240 inside at both a 40 foot bar and other places to park it and drink. The crew also created a courtyard within the existing space by cutting out a huge chunk of the roof; it will offer seating for another 100 guests and be open year round. Unlike the Smorgasburg operation, Berg&apos;n will be open seven days a week from early morning until late nights on the weekends. </p>

<p>For the eats, look for Asia Dog, Pizza Moto, Mighty Quinn&apos;s and Ramen Burger; maybe we&apos;ll get some of those <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509140841/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/06/these_fun_ramen_burger_mashups_at_s.php#photo-1">interesting RB mashups</a> now that it has a full-time home. There&apos;s also going to be a coffee area (purveyor forthcoming) serving brews, pastries and Blue Marble ice cream, plus a &quot;little corner-store packaged-goods area&quot; populated with items from the Flea. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509140841/http://www.bergn.com/">Berg&apos;n</a> will open at 899 Bergen Street between Classon and Franklin Avenues in March.</p>
