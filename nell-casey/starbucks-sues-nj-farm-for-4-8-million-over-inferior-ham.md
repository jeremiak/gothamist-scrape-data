The coffee giant has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501161351/http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2014/01/07/starbucks-lawsuit-ham-quality/4352419/">filed a $4.8 million dollar lawsuit</a> against a NJ-based meat provider claiming they supplied inferior ham products instead of the Black Forest variety the company had paid for. Do not mess with Starbucks over ham, bro. <p></p>

<p>Wellshire Farms&#x2014;not to be confused with Hillshire Farms (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501161351/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BG3cURpEJc">GO MEAT!</a>)&#x2014;was contracted by Starbucks to provide special ham for the chain&apos;s breakfast and lunch sandwiches but allegedly did not reveal that their ham was actually produced by a Maryland-based company called Hahn Bros. Inc. Following several customer complaints of &quot;discolored&quot; and unusual-tasting ham in 2010, Starbucks investigated the ham and discovered the bait-and-switch allegedly carried out by Wellshire. </p>

<p>The Seattle-based company pulled the icky sandwiches and conducted a laboratory test, which discovered &quot;potentially harmful bacteria&quot; in a ham sample. Despite &quot;pleading&quot; with Starbucks to retain their services, Wellshire was booted as a supplier and then slapped with the multi-million dollar lawsuit to &quot;minimize the financial impact of these actions.&quot; Wellshire denies any wrongdoing on their part, but once you&apos;ve burned the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501161351/http://www.forbes.com/companies/starbucks/">Green Giant</a> there&apos;s no going back. </p>
