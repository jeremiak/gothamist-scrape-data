<p>Beginning today, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170404115639/http://www.mileenddeli.com/#homeagain">Mile End Deli</a> invites everyone to <strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170404115639/https://www.instagram.com/p/BGsDauhqpgM/?taken-by=mileenddeli">Blame Canada</a></strong> with a week-long <strike>celebration</strike> roast of our northern neighbors. Swing by either the Manhattan or Brooklyn locations for Canadian dishes like Pogos (their version of corn dog), foie gras poutine, butterscotch pudding and &quot;Bieber Tales,&quot; fried dough covered in chocolate. The special menu features a disturbing artistic interpretation of Canada&apos;s most petulant pop star, which is reason enough to blame the entire country. </p>

<p>Wash any memory of Bieber from your brain with a <strong>bottomless brunch</strong> that&apos;s now on offer at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170404115639/http://www.thewayfarernyc.com/">The Wayfarer</a>.

Also included: an entree from the brunch menu like Short Rib Hash and Poached Eggs or Huevos Rancheros. </p>
