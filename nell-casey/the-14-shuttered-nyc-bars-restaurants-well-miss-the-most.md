title: The 14 Shuttered NYC Bars & Restaurants We'll Miss The Most
---

	
										<p>There&apos;s always going to be a lot of turnover in the city&apos;s bar and restaurant scene, but sometimes there are closures that really bring us down. This year, we lost a lot of good ones, from genre-defining restaurants to crusty dives. Below, the 10 bars and restaurants we&apos;ll miss the most.</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="062414usq_cafe.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20171017125022im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_nellcasey/062414usq_cafe.jpg" width="640" height="480"> <br> <i> <span class="photo_caption">(via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171017125022/https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=109255552449&amp;set=a.435556677449.234649.109247667449&amp;type=1&amp;theater">Facebook</a>)</span></i></div> <p></p>

<p><strong>UNION SQUARE CAFE</strong>: Yes, Danny Meyer&apos;s pioneering Union Square restaurant is technically <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171017125022/http://gothamist.com/2015/07/22/union_square_cafe_saved.php">moving a few blocks away</a>, but the departure from its 30-year home is still a notable (and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171017125022/http://gothamist.com/2014/07/03/danny_meyer_rent_oped.php">disheartening</a>) statement about the difficult real estate landscape, even if you&apos;re operating one of the city&apos;s most beloved eateries. Some of the restaurant&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171017125022/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/11/union_square_cafe.php">longtime favorites</a> will still be on the menu in the move to Park Avenue, just presented in a larger home.</p>

<p><strong>SCRATCHBREAD</strong>: The city lost some of its <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171017125022/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/05/brooklyns_scratchbread_makes_nycs_b.php#photo-1">best egg sandwiches</a> when this five-year-old Bed-Stuy spot <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171017125022/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/10/you_have_one_day_left_to_feast_at_s.php">shuttered in October</a>. The comfort food restaurant cited financial woes and exhaustion as reason for the shutter, with owner Matthew Tilden lamenting the &quot;bullshit&quot; of the situation. There&apos;s cause for hope, however, as Tilden dropped hints of future &quot;delicious&quot; bites in his farewell email.</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="091015dodine.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20171017125022im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_nellcasey/091015dodine.jpg" width="640" height="480"> <br> <i> (via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171017125022/http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/do-or-dine-brooklyn?select=nxHnn6y8OvHE3m2MXwqOhA">Yelp</a>)</i></div> <p></p>

<p><strong>DO OR DINE</strong>: Bed-Stuy also bid farewell to Justin Warner&apos;s off-beat Bedford Avenue spot Do or Dine, which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171017125022/http://gothamist.com/2015/09/10/bed-stuys_do_or_dine_suddenly_shutt.php">suddenly shuttered</a> in September; the chef cited financial reasons in a farewell post on the restaurant&apos;s Facebook page.

<p><strong>MARKET DINER</strong>: The dwindling number of city diners was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171017125022/http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20151025/HOSPITALITY_TOURISM/151029907/where-have-all-the-diners-gone">chronicled by Crains</a> and among the death toll this year was this 1960s-era diner on 11th Avenue at 43rd Street. Sad enough to lose a spot for excellent eggs, but the retro building will be torn down to build a condo, making the blow even harder. </p>

<p><strong>LIT LOUNGE</strong> It&apos;s been a bit of a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171017125022/http://gothamist.com/2015/08/24/whats_going_on_with_lit_lounge.php">will they or won&apos;t they</a> situation for this beloved and notorious East Village watering hole. But regardless of whether the bar opens up under new ownership&#x2014;or with a new name&#x2014;the 14-year chapter has been closed. Owners have previously promised the dive would reopen amid McKibbin Lofts in Bushwick, but regulars know it will never be the same.</p>

<p><strong>WINNIE&apos;S</strong> For nearly 30 years, this Chinatown dive was a haven for sugary cocktails and saccharine renditions of <em>I Will Always Love You</em>. The bar and karaoke spot managed to live lease-free for three years, but was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171017125022/http://gothamist.com/2015/02/24/chinatown_winnies_rip.php">eventually ousted</a> and word has it the landlord has already found a new tenant. </p>

<p><strong>TANDEM</strong>: This Troutman Street bar&apos;s been a staple in the Bushwick food-and-drink scene for the better half of the last decade, earning its stars as the Jefferson L stop&apos;s pioneering drinking hole for gentrifying hip kids way back in the aughts. Since then, an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171017125022/http://gothamist.com/2014/05/02/jefftown_bushwick_guide.php?gallery0Pic=2#photo-2">ongoing clown car of bars and restaurants</a> have taken over the neighborhood, but Tandem, with its $2-$3 Narragansett tallboys, spectacularly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171017125022/http://gothamist.com/2015/01/29/where_to_dance_nyc.php">sketchy backroom dance floor</a>, and kale-and-avocado brunch sandwich, still had its finger on the pulse. <em>(Rebecca Fishbein)</em></p>

Sure, the place was coated in dust, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171017125022/https://www.instagram.com/p/6n1A8ODbFx/">staff was terrifying</a> and it was more expensive than it probably should have been, but you&apos;ve gotta give credit to any place that survived in the vacuum of high-end clothiers that&apos;s present day MePa for as long as it did.  </p>

Amidst the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171017125022/http://gothamist.com/2015/06/08/last_night_at_trash_bar.php">summer closure</a>, ownership was contemplating a move to Bushwick, though it doesn&apos;t appear any public progress has been made in that direction.</p>

<p><strong>CAFFE DANTE</strong>: This 100-year-old Greenwich Village staple went through lots of ups and downs this year, beginning with a sprucing up and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171017125022/http://gothamist.com/2014/07/01/caffe_dante.php#photo-1">menu revamp</a>, followed by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171017125022/http://gothamist.com/2015/02/18/caffe_dante_not_closing.php">rumors of demise</a> and finally <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171017125022/http://gothamist.com/2015/03/23/rip_caffe_dante_4_real_though.php">the actual shutter</a>. The Flotta family, who&apos;d run the restaurant since 1971, sold the space to new owners, who transformed it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171017125022/http://www.dante-nyc.com/">into a cocktail bar</a>.</p>

<p><strong>CINNAMON SNAIL TRUCK</strong>: After five years slinging Norberweiberberweiberhydrafab doughnuts and Korean Barbeque Seitan sandwiches, this beloved vegan food truck <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171017125022/http://gothamist.com/2015/02/14/rip_cinnamon_snail_truck.php">bid farewell to the streets</a> after difficulties renewing their permit.

<p><strong>NITA NITA</strong> Nine-year-old Williamsburg restaurant Nita Nita shuttered this month, leaving neighborhood residents with one fewer backyard bar to chill in. On their website, owners Sam and Virginia revealed a &quot;threefold increase&quot; on the restaurant&apos;s rent, a situation they note has &quot;become all too familiar.&quot; Besides the touch of green, the restaurant was a chill spot to sip a beer or nosh on some brunch. The spot was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171017125022/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/07/nita_nita_gentrification_tape.php#photo-1">given a fitting farewell</a> to a neighborhood in its next phase of gentrification.</p>

Owner Stephen Oliver says he has every intention of reopening inside the new development, but the building&#x2014;which was constructed by Oliver&apos;s father and uncle&#x2014;isn&apos;t likely to retain its cozy charm, at least from the outside. For now, the bar&apos;s tasty burgers and pints have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171017125022/http://gothamist.com/2015/09/01/pipins_pub_saved.php">found a temporary home</a> elsewhere in the neighborhood until construction is completed and they can move back to their corner at 3rd Avenue and 97th Street.</p>
