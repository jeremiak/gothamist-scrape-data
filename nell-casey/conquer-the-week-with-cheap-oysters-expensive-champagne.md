<p>Bivalve devotees have two new outlets to feed their cravings. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170615182441/http://www.oceanarestaurant.com/">Oceana</a> on West 49th Street hosts a week-long scotch and oysters celebration this week, offering four pairings of oysters from NY, NJ and WA with four different single malt scotches for $36. Six of those dollars will be donated to the Billion Oyster Project, which is attempting to repopulate NY waterways with oysters that will protect and rehabilitate the rivers. Meanwhile, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170615182441/https://clanceynyc.com/">Clancey</a> on the LES serves $2 char-grilled oysters for happy hour until 7 p.m., along with $3 High Lifes and $2 off draft beer and cocktails. </p>
