</div></div>					<p>Everyone can agree that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150607185045/http://gothamist.com/2009/03/30/sad_pandas_got_the_mondays.php">Mondays are a total drag</a> and unless you&apos;re <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150607185045/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/23/magic_mushrooms_may_cure_the_monday.php">tripping balls</a>, chances are it&apos;s not going to get much better. But Chef David Santos&#x2014;who runs the kitchen at five-month-old West Village restaurant <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150607185045/http://louronyc.com/">Louro</a>&#x2014;thinks he has the antidote to the dreaded day in the form of weekly supper clubs. Every Monday the chef invites diners for themed dinners&#x2014;sometimes cooked by Santos, sometimes by guest chefs&#x2014;around seasonal items, holidays and even television shows. &quot;We were looking for something fun we could do to make Monday night something people could look forward to,&quot; explains Santos. &quot;So that&#x2019;s how Nossa Mesa was born&quot;</p>

<p>Santos&apos;s supper clubs aren&apos;t a new concept for him; the chef started his supper club <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150607185045/http://umsegredony.com/">Um Segredo</a> out of his Roosevelt Island apartment before moving to Louro last December. Since then he&apos;s hosted everything from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150607185045/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/15/butchering_and_eating_pig_at_the_vi.php#photo-1">butchering parties</a> to <em>Swamp People</em>-themed events, and earlier this week created a five-course cocktail pairing menu with mixologist <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150607185045/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/03/dining/03geeks.html">Mayur Subbarao</a>. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150607185045/http://https://twitter.com/nellcasey/status/318921607571709953">We were invited</a> for the booze-heavy dinner and can confirm that it&apos;s a vast improvement over eating cold lo mein leftovers and plowing through <em>Boy Meets World</em> reruns on the DVR&#x2014;<em>not that there&apos;s anything wrong with that</em>. Chef Santos is a gracious host, taking the time to explain dishes and his inspiration. In a town beleaguered by self-declared, Instagram-addicted foodies, the evening was decidedly free of any posturing or snobbery. We even met some folks who&apos;d been attending Santos&apos;s dinners since the Um Segredo days, a testament to both his delicious food and effusive personality.</p>

<p>Nossa Mesa&apos;s upcoming calendar contains enticing options for the next few weeks, including a Sustainable Seafood menu [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150607185045/http://louronyc.com/Louro_April8.pdf">pdf</a>] on April 8th, a Spring Vegetarian menu [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150607185045/http://louronyc.com/Louro_April15.pdf">pdf</a>] on April 14th and a &quot;Save the Ramps&quot; dinner on April 22nd. To that, Chef Santos decrees: &quot;There are so many other fun spring ingredients to focus on and on this Earth Day dinner let&#x2019;s do that. Let&#x2019;s focus on spring ingredients that aren&#x2019;t being plundered like a village attacked by Vikings!&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150607185045/http://gothamist.com/tags/ramps">TO BATTLE!</a></p>

<p>Dinners mentioned here are all $55 (excluding tax and tip) and even better: unless otherwise noted, all of the Nossa Mesa Monday night dinners are BYOB. To make a reservation for Nossa Mesa, email nossamesa@louronyc.com or call 212-206-0606.</p>
