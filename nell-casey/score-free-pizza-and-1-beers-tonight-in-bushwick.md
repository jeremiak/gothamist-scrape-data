<p>Some ownership &quot;drama&quot; kept Bushwick bar <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171015131654/https://www.facebook.com/rebeccasbushwick/">Rebecca&apos;s</a> closed for the past 131 days, but tonight the original management of the joint are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171015131654/https://www.facebook.com/events/272692839851087/">reopening</a> at 610 Bushwick Avenue with the lure of free grub to get butts in barstools.</p>

<p>From 10 p.m. to midnight Friday night they&apos;ll be giving away slices from nearby <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171015131654/http://www.norbertspizza.com/">Norbert&apos;s Pizza</a>, who do a notable vegan slice that will hopefully make an appearance. Cheap beer makes free food taste better and to that end they&apos;re selling $1 brewskies all night long.</p>
