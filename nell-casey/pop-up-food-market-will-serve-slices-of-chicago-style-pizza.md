<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016145133/http://urbanspacenyc.com/">Urbanspace</a>, the group responsible for several <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016145133/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/28/urbanspace_vanderbilt_eats.php">permanent</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016145133/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/18/outdoor_food_markets_guide.php">seasonal</a> food markets, will debut <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016145133/http://urbanspacenyc.com/urban-space-garment-district/">Urbanspace Garment District</a> next week on Broadway between 40th and 41st Streets. The bi-annual, seasonal pop-up market, which opens May 16th and concludes June 24th, has a few unique vendors joining the expected lobster rolls and tacos. </p>

<p>First up, it&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016145133/http://www.emmettsnyc.com/">Emmett&apos;s</a>, the Chicago-style pizzeria that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016145133/http://gothamist.com/2014/02/06/deep_dish_pizza_nyc.php">opened on MacDougal Street</a> in 2013. Their gut-busting deep dish pies&apos;ll be portioned per person, so think hefty slices of sauce-heavy pizza. A stand called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016145133/http://mmmenfesnyc.com/food-delivery-TW/mmm-enfes-new-york-city.27880.r?QueryStringValue=Ey5wufZ9ZnxjHU0PF5a5Ag==">MMM Enfes</a>, which also operates a storefront a few blocks away, will be selling Turkish fare like borek, phyllo dough stuffed pastries. Finally, a vendor called Delicatessen Tacos will be altering the formula a bit, stuffing their tortillas with smoked and roasted meats&#x2014;we assume brisket and pastrami-type things&#x2014;topped with more traditional cilantro and onion. </p>

<p>Check out the full vendor lineup <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016145133/http://urbanspacenyc.com/urban-space-garment-district/">here</a> (stalwarts like Red Hook Lobster Pound, Domo Taco and Melt have all reported for duty) and stop by Monday through Saturday from 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. to check it out in person.</p>
