<p>Though it&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161007072512/http://gothamist.com/2015/05/27/how_to_get_to_rockaway.php">stunningly easy to do so</a>, time doesn&apos;t always allow us to spend a day at one of New York City&apos;s beaches, so this summer, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161007072512/http://rockawaybrewco.com/">Rockaway Brewing Company</a> is bringing the beach to us&#x2014;in a manner of speaking. The team will open Playa NYC in Ridgewood on June 4th, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161007072512/http://qns.com/story/2016/04/18/queens-based-brewing-company-is-bringing-nys-first-pop-up-urban-beach-beer-garden-to-ridgewood-this-summer/">reports QNS</a>, where they&apos;ll be slinging beers and a bit of the beach in a 5,000-square-foot lot. </p>

<p>The sand under our toes won&apos;t be from nearby city beaches like the Rockaways; 140 cubic yards of sand from Long Island will be dumped into the space. Beach chairs, umbrellas, a thatched palapa and other beach staples will be brought in as well, in addition to spots to play beach volleyball. In lieu of the ocean tides, guests can chill out in kiddie pools.</p>

<p>They won&apos;t sell food, but they&apos;ll set up four grilling stations on-site for people to cook their own food. We&apos;re told the space won&apos;t have any fridge space to stash perishable food items, but just like the regular beach, folks are encouraged to bring coolers to keep things frosty.</p>

<p>The beach bar will also serve beer, of course, including brews from Rockaway in addition to other NYC breweries. Though not 100% set in stone, Rockaway Brewing Company tell us Finback, Big Alice, Gun Hill, Strong Rope, Other Half and Barrier are among the names expected to be poured this summer.  </p>

<p>The pop-up beach bar will operate at 176 Woodward Avenue from 5 p.m. to midnight Monday through Thursday and noon to midnight Fridays through Sundays.</p>
