<p>Nearly a year to the day since <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170416084134/http://gothamist.com/2015/05/28/pizza_on_pizza_pr0n.php">hot pizza on pizza action</a> got us all riled up, the dessert version has dropped in Manhattan. Vegan guilty pleasure utopia <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170416084134/http://cinnamonsnail.com/">The Cinnamon Snail</a> is selling &quot;Inception Donuts&quot; today out of their food stall inside <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170416084134/http://www.thepennsy.nyc/">The Pennsy</a> next to Penn Station. And because <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170416084134/http://gothamist.com/tags/rainbowbagel">this is the world we live in</a>, the donuts are rainbow, too. Much more cheerful than <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170416084134/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/18/eat_your_anger.php">their previous offerings</a>!</p>

<p>Chef Adam Sobel tells us the Sparkle Dazzle Rainbow donuts are maple raspberry-stuffed and decorated with mini donuts that are in turn decorated with even tinier donuts. In <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170416084134/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/23/cinnamon_snail_adam_sobel.php">true Sobel fashion</a>, here&apos;s how he describes the process by which the donuts are made:</p>

<blockquote>How do we make these special donuts you ask?  A gaggle of wild unicorns stampedes through our Brooklyn culinary cloud castle at night (don&#x2019;t worry, that&#x2019;s totally ok with the D.O.H.), and sprinkles magical unicorn dust on regular donut flavored donuts, to cause a chain reaction, where the &#x201C;teddy-bear-man&#x201D; comes down from his rainbow wizard ward to transform the united states into a kingdom of happy rainbows from sea to shining sea.</blockquote>

<p>In truth, only the bottom donut is a legit donut. The middle donuts are sugar cookies rolled into donut shape and the teensy donuts on top are a &quot;Cheerio-type cereal&quot; hand-decorated with vegan royal icing. The donuts are $7 each&#x2014;their other donut offerings are $2&#x2014;and are available first come, first served from 11 a.m. until they run out. If you doubt the popularity of insane foodie creations, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170416084134/http://gothamist.com/2015/06/05/pizza_inception_vinnies.php">don&apos;t</a>.</p>

<p>Here&apos;s a look at how the magic happens at Cinnamon Snail HQ when they&apos;re not <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170416084134/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/14/unique_doughnuts_nyc.php">getting into the viral spirit</a>:</p>
