<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801190522/http://www.breadsbakery.com/">Breads Bakery</a>, they of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801190522/http://gothamist.com/2015/05/01/cheesecake_month_breads_bakery.php">superlative babka</a>, are debuting their second NYC location this Wednesday at 1890 Broadway near Lincoln Center. The bakery&apos;s babkas, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801190522/http://gothamist.com/2015/07/07/best_cheesecake_nyc.php">cheesecakes</a> and other staples will be available at the new location, in addition to other pastries and fresh breads. Their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801190522/http://gothamist.com/2014/09/11/rosh_hashanah_eats.php">festive challahs</a> are excellent for sopping up honey, butter and literally anything else that goes well with carbs.</p>

<p>The bakery will also be offering a tip of the hat to Soutine Bakery, the tiny UWS bakery that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801190522/http://newyork.seriouseats.com/2012/12/soutine-bakery-is-closed-upper-west-side.html">closed in 2012</a>. The Breads team has collaborated with former Soutine owner Madge Rosenberg on a version of her Concord Cake, a decadent chocolate cake comprised of mousse and meringue. Breads owner Gadi Peleg says he &quot;remembers the cake fondly&quot; from his childhood in the neighborhood and wanted to serve the cake as an homage to Rosenberg and her bakery. </p>
