---

	
										<p><em>In case you hadn&apos;t noticed, it&apos;s going to be hot AF this week (and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170101052814/http://gothamist.com/2016/05/25/hot_humid_hell_alert.php">possibly forever</a>), and even though science tells us <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170101052814/http://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2012/07/11/156378713/cool-down-with-a-hot-drink-its-not-as-crazy-as-you-think">to do the opposite</a>, many of us will be reaching for something icy cold after work. We&apos;ve taken a look at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170101052814/http://gothamist.com/2015/07/09/best_frozen_drinks_nyc.php">frozen beverages before</a>, but now we&apos;re focusing specifically on wine that&apos;s been given the icy treatment. Below, a few places to slurp down frozen wine cocktails on a sultry, sweaty evening.</em></p>

<p><strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170101052814/http://www.extrafancybklyn.com/">EXTRA FANCY</a></strong> This Williamsburg go-to has a highbrow cocktail program for a place that channels a New England seafood shack, including their popular <strong>Froz&#xE9;monade</strong>, which they serve all year long. As the name might suggest, this is a ros&#xE9;-based offering, combined with lemonade and whipped into a frothy, frozen treat. It&apos;s tart, refreshing and disturbingly easy to drink, especially in their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170101052814/http://gothamist.com/2016/05/10/extra_fancy_outdoor_bar.php">new backyard bar</a>. <em>302 Metropolitan Avenue, Williamsburg</em></p>

<p><strong>THERAPY WINE BAR</strong> Don&apos;t confuse ros&#xE9;&#x2014;the universal wine of summer&#x2014;with the frozen signature drink offered up at this Bed-Stuy wine bar. The <strong>Concrete Rose</strong> is actually a solidified slushy Shiraz, despite its confusing name. Still, for $13, you get one tasty alcoholic dessert&#x2014;pair with a cheese platter and prepare to suffer the most delicious brain freeze of all time. <em>(Rebecca Fishbein)</em> <em>364 Lewis Avenue, Bedford Stuyvesant</em></p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="070915_sangria.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170101052814im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_rebeccaf/070915_sangria.jpg" width="640" height="480"> <br> <i> Hotedl Tortuga (Via Foursquare)</i></div> <p></p>

<p><strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170101052814/http://hoteltortuganyc.com/">HOTEL TORTUGA</a></strong> Hotel Tortuga is one of my favorite East Village burrito spots, with its quick service, decent food, and self-serve chip basket. But it&apos;s the <strong>Frozen Sangria</strong> that&apos;s had me coming back time and time again. $5.50 gets you a glass full of dark-red slush that&apos;s simultaneously tart and sweet, and dotted with very-chewable frozen blueberries. A half pitcher runs $13 and a pitcher runs $24&#x2014;hangover-fighting Advil not included. <em>(Rebecca Fishbein)</em> <em>246 East 14th Street, East Village</em></p>

<p><strong>CHILO&apos;S</strong> This chill Bed-Stuy bar has a permanent taco truck attached to it, always a good thing, and two frozen drink machines constantly turning for the season. There are margaritas, of course, but they also do a tasty version of <strong>Froz&#xE9;</strong>, made with ros&#xE9; wine, fresh grapefruit, white rum and honey. Park yourself at a picnic bench out back and order up some huilacotche tacos, which we&apos;re told are some of the city&apos;s best. <em>323 Franklin Avenue, Bed-Stuy</em></p>

<p><strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170101052814/http://www.sweetrevengenyc.com/">SWEET REVENGE</a></strong> Cupcakes are the main event at this Carmine Street dessert and wine bar, but they also satisfy lushes with a <strong>Frozen Wine Slushy</strong> ($12) or &quot;Vino Granitas,&quot; as they call them. The place specializes in pairing desserts with booze, so pick a flavor&#x2014;Raspberry, Blueberry Mango, Citron Lime, Sunset, Sunrise&#x2014;then ask <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170101052814/http://www.sweetrevengenyc.com/menus/cupcake-wine-beer-pairings/">which of their myriad flavors</a> works best to join. <em>62 Carmine Street, West Village</em></p>

<p><strong>CEMITAS EL TIGRE</strong> What to do if you don&apos;t have spirits for your margaritas? Make them with agave wine! This Sunnyside Mexican sandwich spot doesn&apos;t let a lack of liquor prevent them from serving a <strong>Frozen Margarita with Agave Wine</strong> ($8), wine made from webber blue agave, the same plant that makes tequila. The fortified variety of this type of wine can reach 24% ABV, so don&apos;t think you&apos;re getting out of there without a bit of of a buzz. <em>45-14 48th Avenue, Sunnyside</em></p>

Similarly&#x2014;and bending the genre a bit, if we&apos;re being honest&#x2014;STK Rooftop&apos;s Froz&#xE9; ($18) is a flute of ros&#xE9; Chandon with a scoop of raspberry sorbet that they make in-house. <em>420 Park Ave South, Flatiron // 26 Little West 12th Street, Meatpacking District</em></p>

<p><strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170101052814/http://toro-nyc.com/">TORO NYC</a></strong> A trio of sangrias are on offer at this Chelsea tapas spot, all of which can be transformed into <strong>Sangria Slushies</strong> ($14) if the mood strikes. Beverage director Caitlin Doonan is doing a Red Sangria with Tempranillo, orange curacao, lemon and Luxardo Triplum; a Ros&#xE9; Sangria with rose&#xE9;, pomegranate liquor, Elderflower and lemon; and a White Sangria with Manzanilla, St. Germain, grapefruit and lemon. Perfect sippers alongside pinchos like salted Spanish almonds and Tortilla Espa&#xF1;ola. <em>85 10th Avenue, Chelsea</em></p>
