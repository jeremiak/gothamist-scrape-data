<p>Brands take note: this is how you <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171015115358/http://gothamist.com/2017/01/16/new_territories_milkshake_les.php#photo-1">ruin</a> a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171015115358/http://gothamist.com/2017/01/09/this_is_the_end_my_friend.php#photo-1">trend</a>.</p>

<blockquote>The elusive unicorn from medieval legend has been making a comeback. Once only found in enchanted forests, unicorns have been popping up in social media with shimmering unicorn-themed food and drinks. Now Starbucks is taking the trend to a new level with its first Unicorn Frappuccino&#xAE; blended beverage...</blockquote>

<p>I truly thought the Frappuccino&#xAE; phase ended soon after the drinks debuted in the mid-90s, but one recent caffeine pit stop at a Connecticut branch filled with teens made me realize the sugary drinks haven&apos;t gone anywhere&#x2014;they&apos;ve just...evolved.</p>

<blockquote>The Unicorn Frappuccino blended cr&#xE8;me is made with a sweet dusting of pink powder, blended into a cr&#xE8;me Frappuccino with mango syrup and layered with a pleasantly sour blue drizzle. It is finished with vanilla whipped cream and a sprinkle of sweet pink and sour blue powder topping.</blockquote>

<p>Just call it what it is: a fruity calorie bomb filled with chemicals made to pop in the Lo-Fi Instagram filter. </p>

<p>The Starbucks description makes it sound like a Sweet Tarts, but why would I rob you of the chance to hear it straight from the source&apos;s mouth?</p>

<blockquote>Like its mythical namesake, the Unicorn Frappuccino blended cr&#xE8;me comes with a bit of magic, starting as a purple beverage with swirls of blue and a first taste that is sweet and fruity. But give it a stir and its color changes to pink, and the flavor evolves to tangy and tart. The more swirl, the more the beverage&#x2019;s color and flavors transform.</blockquote>

<p>Anyway the drink&apos;s only available at USA stores from Wednesday, April 19, through Sunday, April 23 so get there before <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171015115358/http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Unicorn_blood">Voldemort</a> or whatever.</p>
