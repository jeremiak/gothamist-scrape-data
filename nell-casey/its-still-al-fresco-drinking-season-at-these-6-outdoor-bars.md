<p><em>The wicked winter wind may be lumbering our way but we&apos;re not ones to give up our al fresco imbibing so easily&#x2014;those stunning views and charming exteriors exist in cold weather, too! Many of our favorite bars share our intrepid love of the outdoors regardless the season, and take measures to provide warmth for their patrons even when the mercury dips below 40. With milder temperatures on tap for the next five days, it&apos;s the perfect time to sip a hot drink or five at these <em>fall</em> fresco destinations.</em></p>

<p>Williamsburg&apos;s <strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502122446/http://berryparkbk.com/">Berry Park</a></strong> puts a big &apos;ole cover atop their rooftop digs, making it weather-proof for cold, rain, snow and whatever other tricks Mother Nature has up her sleeve. Sip on a Bourbon Fall ($11), a warming mix of Maker&apos;s Mark, Grand Marnier, bitters, orange and lemon and take in the beautiful views of Manhattan through the all-glass enclosure. <em>4 Berry Street between North 13th Street and Nassau Avenue</em></p>

<p>The charming, Mediterranean oasis <strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502122446/http://www.themaritimehotel.com/labottega.php">La Bottega</a></strong> at the Maritime Hotel won&apos;t leave you out in the cold this season. Proprietors erect a &quot;green house structure&quot; over a section of the patio and install heat lamps to keep things nice and cosy. It&apos;s the perfect place to sip a mulled wine or spiked cider (both $12) and imagine you&apos;re in a Tuscan hamlet instead of the outskirts of the Meatpacking District. They also offer a hearty Baked Eggs ($12) with savory tomatoes, prosciutto and ricotta for intrepid brunchers and decadent pasta dishes like Ravioli ($15) stuffed with beef, pork and spinach in a brown butter sage sauce. <em>88 Ninth Avenue between 16th and 17th Streets</em></p>

<p><strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502122446/http://www.yelp.com/biz/brooklyn-ice-house-brooklyn">Brooklyn Ice House</a></strong>, the delightful dive in Red Hook, brings some fire power to their rustic backyard setup. They told us they&apos;ll &quot;Throw a few logs on the fire pit at night outdoors,&quot; perfect for warming chilly fingers and toes after the long walk from the subway. They do a serviceable Pulled Pork for winter sustenance plus shot-and-beer specials to keep your inner fire going. <em>318 Van Brunt Street between Pioneer and King Streets</em></p>

<p><strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502122446/http://www.bbarandgrill.com/">B Bar</a></strong> may have fallen out of fashion due to an influx of B&amp;T; bros who swamp the outdoor space in the warmer seasons, but the East Village standby gets a respite in cooler weather, making for a quieter evening spent on the Bowery. The bar swaps out the dangling plants for tree-style heat lamps, which offer a warm glow for diners and imbibers. They also throw on the glass rooftop, so come sleet or snow you&apos;ll be protected from the elements. Skip the mojitos and margaritas for a glass of Cotes du Rhones ($11) or Malbec ($9) to accompany one of their personal pizzas like the Morrocco ($14) with lamb sausage, roasted red pepper, black olives, harrisa and goat cheese. <em>40 East 4th Street at Bowery</em></p>

<p>Frigid temperatures won&apos;t stop Gowanus&apos; <strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502122446/http://lavenderlake.com/">Lavender Lake</a></strong> from operating their giant patio. The bar triples down on warming apparatus, including wood burning pot belly stoves called Ciminea&apos;s, infrared heaters mounted to the walls and wool blankets to huddle under. Play Hard Ball ($12), so to speak, with their cocktail of the same name: Pig&apos;s Nose Scotch, Jim Beam, Campari and Angostura or cut out the middleman with a glass of Glenmorangie Highland 10 year scotch ($15) for full belly-warming effect. <em>383 Carroll Street between Bond and Nevins Streets</em></p>

<p>Kooky LES board game bar <strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502122446/http://www.blueribbonrestaurants.com/rests_beer_garden_main.htm">Blue Ribbon Beer Garden</a></strong> replaced the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502122446/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/28/inside_blue_ribbon_beer_garden_a_se.php#photo-1">summertime pastel motif</a> and swapped it out for a more autumnal vibe. They&apos;ve also added heaters and some cozy blankets for cuddling while you display your Sorry! prowess. They&apos;re offering Spiked Apple Cider and Bourbon Hot Chocolate ($11) to warm up cold hands and bellies, plus comfort food like chicken sausage and pulled pork, served with yam orzo, toasted cabbage salad and rye roast. <em>190 Allen Street between Houstan and Orchard, 2nd Floor</em></p>
