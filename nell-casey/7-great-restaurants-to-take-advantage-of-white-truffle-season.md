<p>Despite <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141023015834/http://news.yahoo.com/white-truffle-season-2012-hampered-unfavorable-weather-conditions-073404562.html">fear-mongering out of Italy</a> that this season&apos;s white truffle harvest was in jeopardy, NYC&apos;s upper crust restaurants are featuring the prized &apos;shroom on their autumn menus. Though truffles are typically reserved for anyone with a disposable income, several &quot;affordable&quot; dishes have made their way onto local menus, which is good news for anyone galled by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141023015834/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/19/red_farm_charging_18_for_two_truffl.php">two dumplings for $18</a>. Looking for your best bets to try truffles around town? Here are a few places to start:</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141023015834/http://www.e2hospitality.com/casa-nonna/">Casa Nonna</a>:</strong> Truffle love doesn&apos;t have to be all highbrow and fussy. Here, a simple but flavorful buffalo mozzarella cheese pie gets fungi-fied with house-made truffle oil and slices of fresh, Burgandy truffles from Northern Italy as soon as the pie comes out piping hot from the oven. Snag a chair at the 11-seat pizza bar where you can watch the pizzaiolo create your $44 piece of heaven. <em>310 West 38th Street // 212-736-3000</em></p>

<p><strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141023015834/http://www.davidbouley.com/?page_id=15">Bouley</a></strong>: Chef David Bouley offers two truffle dishes this autumn, both with a very eggy bent. First his Porcini Flan with shaved black truffles ($20 at lunch, $25 at dinner), an earthy twist on a classically sweet application, and scrambled egg with Comte foam and shaved truffles (approximately $40 market price). Both presentations are available as an appetizer and the scrambled egg dish also shows up on the six-course tasting menu, priced at $175. <em>163 Duane Street // 212-964-2525</em></p>

<p><strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141023015834/http://www.caviarrusse.com/">Caviar Russe</a></strong>: Already known for their caviar importing empire, this Midtown East restaurant takes a stab at another luxury food item with their special truffle item: Scottish Langoustine with celery, porcini and white truffle ($75). <em>538 Madison Avenue // 212=980-5908</em></p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right"> <img alt="101512truffles2.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141023015834im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_nellcasey/101512truffles2.jpg" width="300" height="199"> <br> <i style=" width:300px; ;display:block"> <span class="photo_caption">(<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141023015834/http://www.flickr.com/photos/tienmao/115826953/sizes/m/">tienmao</a>/Flickr)</span></i></div> <strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141023015834/http://rougetomatenyc.com/">Rouge Tomate</a></strong>: The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141023015834/http://gothamist.com/2008/10/30/rouge_tomate.php#photo-10">gorgeous dining room</a> at chef Jeremy Bearman&apos;s Upper East Side gem is reason enough to make the trip to Gothamist favorite Rouge Tomate, and this season&apos;s truffle dish is another. The $21 Black Winter Truffle Risotto features Carnaroli rice&#x2014;a starchier, hearty rice than the typical arborio&#x2014;thickened with black truffle and wild mushroom puree and finished with parmesan and squid ink. With a hearty dose of shaved White Alba truffles on top the dish costs $55. <em>10 East 60th Street // 646-237-8977</em><p></p>

<p><strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141023015834/http://tocquevillerestaurant.com/">Tocqueville</a></strong>: When a single dish simply will not do, enter the storied Truffle Tasting Menu. At this elegant Union Square eatery, truffles are presented in a decadent, seven course menu, which will evolve as the season presses on. Expect toothsome house-made potato gnocchi with chanterelle mushrooms and white truffle and delicate poached Maine lobster with fennel, green and white celery, sweet peppers, lobster demi-glaze and white truffle foam. The $225 starting price might put a dent in your wallet but truffles <em>and</em> lobster rarely come cheap. <em>&#x202A;1 East 15th Street&#x202C; // 212-647-1515</em>  </p>

<p><strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141023015834/http://www.locandaverdenyc.com/contact.php">Trufflepalooza</a></strong>: If you really want to try the mushroom goodness but don&apos;t have the 1% bank account, this foodie event going down at Locanda Verde is your best bet. For $69.99 you get <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141023015834/http://www.locandaverdenyc.com/contact.php">three courses of truffle dishes</a>, with two options for each course. Start off with warm mushrooms, creamy polenta and poached organic egg then move to the fonduta ravioli with sugo di pollo and brussels sprouts. There are also two truffle-heavy dessert options in the forms of white truffle gelato and a truffle-honey cake. The reservations are all snatched up, but the restaurant will be setting aside tables for walk-ins&#x2014;if you can show up when they open at 5:30 p.m., you&apos;ll have a pretty good shot. And if not, check back for information on the AC/BT Black Trufflepalooza happening this winter. <em>377 Greenwich Street // 212-925-3797</em></p>

<p>Even with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141023015834/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/23/free_dinner_in_brooklyn_if_youre_br.php">urban foraging</a> taking off in a big way, don&apos;t expect to find any truffles <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141023015834/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2217724/Nellie-truffle-hunting-hound-Suffolk-Family-pet-sniffs-valuable-delicacy-owners-garden.html?ito=feeds-newsxml">lying around your backyard</a>.
