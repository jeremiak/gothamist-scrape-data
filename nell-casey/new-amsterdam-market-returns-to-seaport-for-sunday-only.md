<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130727025754/http://www.newamsterdammarket.org/events.html">New Amsterdam Market</a> returns to the South Street Seaport this Sunday but don&apos;t expect to find all the growers, chefs and food producers there every weekend, as this will be a one-day-only event. Breaking with a two year tradition that saw the market open weekends from spring through the fall, this single day affair is the first in a monthly series of food events, to announced at a later date. </p>

<p>Even though it has a much-abbreviated schedule, that doesn&apos;t mean they&apos;re skimping out on the eats. Over 70 vendors will attend Sunday&apos;s market, which runs from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130727025754/http://www.newamsterdammarket.org/map.html">South Street between Beekman Street and Peck Slip</a>.</p>

<p>On hand on the 23rd are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130727025754/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/03/brooklyn_artisanal_beef_jerky_wins.php">Kings County Jerky</a>, Luke&apos;s Lobster, Guss&apos; Pickles and other ready-to-eat options. A dedicated Dairy Section includes milks, cheeses, ice creams and other milk-based treats from The Bent Spoon, Edgwick Farm, Sohha Greek Yogurt and more. The Local Grains Bread Pavilion III takes care of all your yeasty cravings with offerings from Hot Bread Kitchen and Orwasher&apos;s Bakery plus a special Bread &amp; Butter stall selling sweet and savory tartines.</p>

<p>This could be the final season for the long-running market, with plans for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130727025754/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/21/plans_announced_for_two_new_food_ma.php">two new food markets</a> for the Seaport announced earlier this year. Now might be a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130727025754/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/12/the_10_best_tourist_spots_every_new.php">good time to visit</a> before things <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130727025754/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/11/bloomberg_wants_to_create_seaport_c.php">change completely</a>.</p>
