</div></div>					<p>Much of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150601001907/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/30/20_photos_of_hurricane_sandys_red_h.php#photo-1">news coming out of Zone A</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150601001907/http://gothamist.com/tags/hurricanesandy">flood-ravaged sections of the city</a> is about death and destruction. But from Gowanus today, news of rebirth: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150601001907/http://www.fletchersbklyn.com/">Fletcher&apos;s Brooklyn Barbecue</a> makes its grand opening tonight at 5 p.m. While cleanup from the toxic canal&apos;s overflow happens down the street, the little BBQ spot that could was &quot;spared&quot; and able to open on time. &quot;There&apos;s lots of excitement here,&quot; says owner Bill &quot;BBQ Billy&quot; Fletcher. &quot;I think people are looking for a good place to enjoy a plate of smoked meat and a beer.&quot;</p>

<p>When it comes to their meat, Fletcher&apos;s slow-smokes humanely raised brisket, ribs, pork shoulder and other cuts in a 2,600 pound, bright red, J&amp;R; Pit with oak and maple woods. Matt Fisher, former pit master at R.U.B. BBQ (the Chelsea restaurant that got the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150601001907/http://gothamist.com/2012/09/18/photos_hummer_hits_bus_taxi_restaur.php#photo-1">accidental &quot;Hummer Remodel&quot;</a>), has teamed up with Fletcher to bring authentic American BBQ to the menu. Meats are available by the pound, with pork shoulder and ribs running for $19/lb and beef brisket for $24/lb, or on a sandwich with slaw, pickles and other crunchy toppings. Specials like Char Siu pork belly and maple smoked Red Wattle Pork Loin appear on a rotating basis, as well as a rotating slider menu and barbecue tacos. Traditional barbecue accompaniments like pickles, mac and cheese and baked beans and local beers and &quot;hand-selected&quot; bourbon and rye are available as well. </p>

<p>Like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150601001907/http://gothamist.com/2007/04/27/brooklyn_drinks_13.php">Fette Sau</a> in Williamsburg, Fletcher&apos;s serves its food cafeteria-style and diners can take their food back to the 50-seat dining area or snag a seat at the 6-seat, salvaged wood bar. We haven&apos;t seen the space yet but we&apos;re told the tables are &quot;built like tanks&quot; and the atmosphere is &quot;inspired by Gowanus&apos; industrial history&quot; with lights hung on steel bars and a &quot;floating wood, gullwing ceiling with illuminated troughs.&quot; Guess that&apos;s the kind of thing you have to see in person to understand. </p>
