Cherished Bay Ridge bakery <a href="leskesbrooklyn@gmail.com">Leske&apos;s</a>, which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130526191953/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/09/legendary_leskes_bakery_to_open_2nd.php">recently expanded to Park Slope</a>, has created a special St. Patrick&apos;s day pastry complete with Bailey&apos;s Irish Creme and neon green glaze. The bakery&apos;s traditional kringler&#x2014;an eclair/creme puff-like pastry shaped like a pretzel&#x2014;gets an &#xC9;irinn twist with Bailey&apos;s Irish Cream-flavored whipped cream and Bailey&apos;s custard, plus a generous drizzle of shiny green glaze.

<p>The special Wales Kringler, which is available now at both locations, comes in a small size for $9 and a larger one for $17.50 and if you call ahead the bakery will happily put one aside for you to pick up later. This weekend the bakery will also offer Bailey&apos;s Donuts&#x2014;Boston Cream doughnuts filled with Bailey&apos;s flavored cream. Luckily, cream-filled pastries are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130526191953/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/04/dunkin_donuts_explains_how_soda_ban.php">not on Hizzoner&apos;s radar</a>. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130526191953/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/25/the_battle_of_the_big_gulp_heated_u.php">Yet.</a></p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130526191953/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/25/the_battle_of_the_big_gulp_heated_u.php">
