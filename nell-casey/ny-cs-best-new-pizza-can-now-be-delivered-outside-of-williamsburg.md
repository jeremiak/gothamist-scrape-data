<p>There&apos;s no doubt we&apos;re in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170326190152/http://gothamist.com/2016/05/17/amazon_restaurant_delivery.php">golden age of food delivery</a>, where restaurants&#x2014;and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170326190152/http://gothamist.com/2016/05/16/momofuku_ando_david_chang.php">non-restaurants</a>&#x2014;are unbridled by the boundaries of neighborhood and borough. Companies like Postmates and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170326190152/https://www.trycaviar.com/">Caviar</a> are shuttling delicious foodstuffs across rivers for us, people, with the latter <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170326190152/https://www.trycaviar.com/brooklyn-queens/emmy-squared-3335">bestowing</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170326190152/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/20/emmy_squared_detroit_pizza_heaven.php#photo-1">outstanding new Detroit-inspired pizza spot</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170326190152/http://pizzalovesemily.com/emmy-squared/">Emmy Squared</a> to other parts of Brooklyn, plus parts of Queens and Manhattan. </p>

<p>Starting today and running until Friday, customers can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170326190152/https://www.trycaviar.com/manhattan/emmy-squared--manhattan-caviar-popup-3412">order Emmy Squared&apos;s pies</a> via Caviar from noon until 2 p.m. in Manhattan with a maximum of four pies per order (get the Roni, it&apos;s exquisite). The restaurant has been partnering with Caviar at their Clinton Hill original for a while, debuting their Emmy Squared delivery offspring in Queens and Brooklyn last week.</p>

<p>The pizzas can easily feed three people per pie, such are their heft, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170326190152/https://www.trycaviar.com/brooklyn-queens/emmy-squared-3335">in Queens and Brooklyn</a>, the restaurant&apos;s tasty sandwiches are available too. The Meatball and Spicy Chicken sandwiches, served on pretzel buns, can also be ordered, in addition to salads, mixed olives and Churro Bites. You&apos;ll have to stop by IRL&#x2014;and really, you should anyway&#x2014;to get their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170326190152/https://www.instagram.com/p/BDLZqp4pLcz/?taken-by=emmysquaredpizza">burgers</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170326190152/https://www.instagram.com/p/BFZnW4BC51T/?taken-at=1026897178">friendly fries</a>.</p>

<p>See gif below for delivery zones in Brooklyn and Queens, keeping in mind that Emmy Squared will only be available in Manhattan below 14th Street.</p>
