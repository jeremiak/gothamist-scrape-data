<p>Celebrate the first day of spring with a free cookie crawl for the annual <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160904043234/http://macarondaynyc.com/">Macaron Day</a> event dedicated to the delicate French cookies filled with flavored cream. On Sunday, March 20th, a bunch of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160904043234/http://macarondaynyc.com/participants.html">area patisseries</a> will be offering free macarons at their stores for customers who come and mention the holiday. Brought to the USA by French pastry master Francois Payard in 2010, the festival has grown to include over a dozen local shops and has raised lots of money for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160904043234/https://giving.cityharvest.org/macaron-day-2015">City Harvest</a>.</p>

<p>Spots including Macaron Parlour, Mille-Feuille, Spot Dessert Bar and Dana&apos;s Bakery will hand you a free macaron between 10 a.m. and 5 p.m. on Sunday. Not to be outdone, all the locations of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160904043234/http://payard.com/">Francois Payard</a> will be selling the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160904043234/http://payard.com/macaron-donut/">Macaron Donut</a>, a larger, pastry cream-filled macaron in the shape of a donut for $5.</p>
