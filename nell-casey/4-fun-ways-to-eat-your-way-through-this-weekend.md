                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="102413redhookvendors.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203071811im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_nellcasey/102413redhookvendors.jpg" width="640" height="428"> <br> <i> <span class="photo_caption">Pupusas at the Red Hook Ball Fields (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203071811/http://www.flickr.com/photos/wallyg/3565365102/in/photostream/">wallyg</a>/Flickr)</span></i></div> <p></p>

<p>The mouthwatering pupusas from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203071811/http://www.redhookfoodvendors.com/Home.html">Red Hook Food Vendor</a> El Olomega rightfully <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203071811/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/08/vendys.php#photo-1">won the coveted Vendy Cup</a> at this year&apos;s mobile food vendor awards and this weekend is the last time this season to sample their savory treats, along with all the other vendors. Gorge on traditional Mexican delights like sopes, tacos and huaraches; ceviches and fried plantains from Guatemala; or tamales and sweet fritters from El Salvador. All the vendors take great pride in putting forth quality dishes from their country&apos;s cuisine in their 40-year tradition of setting up shop outside the ballfields. Though we hope it isn&apos;t true, this year could be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203071811/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/26/red_hook_food_vendors_return_tomorr.php">the last time</a> the vendors populate the &apos;nabe, as keeping up with the city&apos;s strict regulations has meant unaffordable overhead for the mom-and-pop operations.</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="102413lobstah.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203071811im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_nellcasey/102413lobstah.jpg" width="300" height="225" class="image-right"> </span>Lobster&apos;s seasonal reign comes to a close, heralding in more cold-weather indulgences like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203071811/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/15/truffle_roundup.php">truffles</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203071811/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/25/pumpkin_beers.php">harvest beers</a>. Take the red clawed beauty for one more turn on the dance floor at Saturday&apos;s <strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203071811/http://backofhouse.morganshotelgroup.com/hotel-events/lobsterfest-at-huson/">Lobsterfest</a></strong>, which also celebrates the final weekend of Oktoberfest. An $80 ticket buys you entrance to Hudson Common and its adjacent outdoor garden for an afternoon of lobster delights, German beers and some polka tunes. You&apos;ll sample five different lobster creations, including a Salted Caramel and White Truffle lobster rolls, grilled tails, cracked claws and a lobster gumbo. Your ticket also nabs you a 32 ounce stein of NY Oktoberfest beer to wash it all down.</p>

<p>The downsized <strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203071811/http://www.newamsterdammarket.org/">New Amsterdam Market</a></strong> returns on Sunday with an extra special fishy edition. The third annual Gathering of the Fisheries brings together a dozen seafood entities from &quot;Maine to Montauk&quot; to sell everything from salmon to lobster to scallops. Also, the Vermont Sail Freight Project, which we <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203071811/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/03/vermont_farmer_building_sailboat_to.php">introduced to you last spring</a>, arrives on our shores with a bounty of agricultural products from Vermont, including maple syrup, pickled products, fruits, veggies and grains. If you&apos;re just in the market for a snack, eateries like Back Forty, Pushcart Coffee and La Yorkina will be selling ready-to-eat treats on site.</p>

<p>Burgers, beer and pumpkins&#x2014;is there anything else you need on a chilly October Sunday? If not, swing by Burger Joint&apos;s <strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203071811/http://burgerjointny.com/halloween/">Pumpkins &amp; Grub</a></strong> event this weekend, where you&apos;ll be treated to lots of hearty eats and drinks to fortify you for an afternoon of pumpkin carving. Swing by anytime between noon and 4 p.m., where $20 ($25 at the door) gets you a cheeseburger, fries and a soda plus a mini pumpkin all your own to decorate as you see fit. They&apos;re also supplying the carving tools and &quot;decorative materials&quot; to see your vision to fruition.</p>
