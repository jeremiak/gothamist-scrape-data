<p>The Brooklyn outpost of wacky pizza purveyor Two Boots will sling its last pie on Sunday, according to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140210112503/http://www.brooklynpaper.com/stories/36/45/dtg-two-boots-closes-2013-11-08-bk_36_45.html">Brooklyn Paper</a>. The 24-year-old restaurant, which was the second location after the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140210112503/http://gothamist.com/2012/08/21/free_food_alert_celebrate_25_years.php">venerable East Village original</a>, will shut down this week when owner John Touhey hands over the keys to longtime employees Andy and Piper Wandzilak. &#x201C;I&#x2019;ll miss it terribly but I have to move on,&#x201D; explained Touhey, who leaves to focus on his job as assistant principal at St. Joseph High School. </p>

<p>The new owners might be ditching the pizza but they have plans to reopen as a new restaurant come January. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s going to grow up a little bit away from the frolicking kid restaurant it has been,&#x201D; Wandzilak revealed. &#x201C;But there will still be a place for kids.&#x201D; Plans include renovating the dining room, expanding the bar and offering more music options with the hopes of attracting a hipper crowd. &#x201C;We were known as a family place, which gave the image that, if you were in your 20s or 30s, it wasn&#x2019;t such a hip place because of all those screaming kids around,&#x201D; Touhey concedes. </p>

<p>Touhey opened the Louisiana-via-Italy restaurant in the East Village in 1987 before moving to Park Slope and opening this second location. The funky movie theater adjoining the original <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140210112503/http://gothamist.com/2008/11/10/rip_two_boots_pioneer_theater_east.php">closed in 2008</a> but the chain has been steadily growing, including a new location in Nashville that opened over the summer. All three owners wrote a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140210112503/http://www.heresparkslope.com/home/2013/11/5/two-boots-to-close-on-sunday.html">touching note to their customers</a> with hopes that the new restaurant continues to serve as a community gathering place. </p>
