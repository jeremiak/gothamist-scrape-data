<p>BANG BANG CHICKEN AND SHRIMP IN YOUR FACE!!!! Yes, it&apos;s true, Cheesecake Factory finally looked at the rich culinary options in New York City and realized that their brand of hundreds of menu items&#x2014;accentuated by a section devoted entirely to cheese-based desserts&#x2014;was exactly what was missing from the landscape. Praise be.</p>

<p>The hokily-decorated restaurant will be making its NYC debut inside the Elmhurst&#x2019;s Queens Center mall, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108032256/http://qns.com/story/2016/03/01/first-cheesecake-factory-in-queens-may-be-coming-to-elmhurst/">reports QNS.com</a>, with a proposed 180 seats inside plus 48 more outside. If the chain&apos;s notorious wait times are a problem in places like Boca Raton, Florida, just <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108032256/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/08/williamsburg_rainbow_bagel.php">imagine what it&apos;ll be like here</a>. </p>

<p>The mallification of NYC aside&#x2014;hey, at least this<em> is </em>opening in a mall, right?&#x2014;Cheesecake Factory is the bomb. Their salads are enormous, their pastas are delicious and that warm bread they serve before the meal? Shut the front door. If we&apos;re going to be invaded by corporate restaurants, at least it&apos;s this one, where the food is (shockingly) really fucking good. </p>
