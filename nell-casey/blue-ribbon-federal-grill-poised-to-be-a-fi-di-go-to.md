					<p>Bromberg brothers Eric and Bruce, the prolific restaurateurs behind the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170330021130/https://www.blueribbonrestaurants.com/">Blue Ribbon Restaurants</a>, debuted their newest, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170330021130/https://www.blueribbonrestaurants.com/restaurants/blue-ribbon-federal-grill">Blue Ribbon Federal Grill</a>, this month, serving as kind of a &quot;Best Of&quot; tour of their different restaurant concepts. Set across from the Federal Reserve, the sleek dining room&apos;s part of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170330021130/http://www.stayaka.com/locations/wall_street/default.aspx">AKA Wall Street</a> hotel and thus the entrance is somewhat hidden from William Street. Persevere for the Brombergs&apos; signature elevated comfort food, which was unsurprisingly wonderful on a recent press preview.</p>

<p>Broken down into type of food, the menu spans fancy steaks and chops to hearty salads. Prices are left off the online version&#x2014;a now-common trope amongst restaurants of a certain price level&#x2014;but there&apos;s enough range that one could eat reasonably well for either $15 or $58, where the prices top out for entrees. Serious Ballers Only need apply for the 30 grams of Ossetra Caviar for $175.</p>

<p>This blogger was very pleased with the small but richly flavored Peekytoe Crab ($16), which tops two halves of soft boiled egg seasoned with a tarragon aioli like the best deviled eggs you&apos;ll ever have. New Zealand Cockles ($19) arrive in a ginger and cilantro-scented coconut milk broth fortified with chilies (take their offer of bread for dunking). </p>

<p>The Burger ($18), a stomach-friendly six ounces of ground chuck on homemade English muffin, is made even better by adding the house-made pickles on the side. The accompanying waffle chips are outstanding, but don&apos;t sleep on the Leek and Manchego Gratin ($12) to accompany one of the larger protein dishes.</p>
