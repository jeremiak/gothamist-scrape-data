<p>To cap off a three-day weekend&#x2014;for <em>some</em> people (grumble grumble)&#x2014;Ramen Burger creator and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160516141558/http://gothamist.com/2015/06/25/ramen_burger_shack_queens.php">ramen enthusiast</a> Keizo Shimamoto has planned an ambitious rendition of his Smorgasburg-born Ramen Shack, which&apos;ll be popping up at West Village&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160516141558/https://lumpiashack.wordpress.com/">Lumpia Shack</a>. The Filipino restaurant, which is typically closed on Mondays, will be setting aside their spring rolls and &quot;Pig Face&quot; rice bowls to welcome Shimamoto and his lineup of 10 different ramens, plus add-ins and an appetizer.</p>

<p>To start off the meal, Shimamoto&apos;s version of Pacific Tune Poke ($3), the Hawaii-born raw fish dish currently <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160516141558/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/28/poke_explainer_guide_nyc.php">sweeping the city</a>. Next up, a large selection of ramens, including chicken and dashi-based broths like a Classic Shoyu Chuukasoba ($8) and Negi Shoyu ($10), a spicy scallion soup. Richer options include pork bone broth-based Tonkotsu Tan Tan ($11) with spicy pork; on the other end, a Vintage Veggiesoba ($10), a vegetarian ramen made with almond milk.</p>

<p>Also on the menu, Shimamoto&apos;s GCS 2016, a Green Curry Ramen he developed during his tenure at Bassanova Tokyo. &quot;Instead of using a pork and chicken broth I use my classic chicken and dashi broth,&quot; he tells us. &quot;It&apos;s Japanese ramen with a Thai twist.&quot;</p>

<p><em>50 Greenwich Avenue; pop-up begins at 5 p.m. and runs until the stock pots have run dry.</em></p>
