<p>Almost every single day a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031020932/http://gothamist.com/tags/newrestaurantandbarradar">new establishment</a> braves the Yelper-infested waters of our enormous sea of restaurants. But the fall in particular welcomes a vast list of noteworthy openings, from established emperors to newcomers hoping for their big break. Here&apos;s a few spots we&apos;ll be clamoring for a reservation at this season.</p>

<p><strong>WHITE GOLD</strong> April Bloomfield&apos;s next newest offering, Salvation Burger, remains shuttered after a fire, but she&apos;s still forging ahead with this new bistro on the Upper West Side. There, she&apos;ll be doing whole animal preparations, courtesy of an in-house butcher program&#x2014;which&apos;ll supply burger meat for her other operations&#x2014;and a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031020932/http://www.grubstreet.com/2016/08/april-bloomfield-chopped-cheese-sandwich-white-gold.html?mid=full-rss-grubstreet">gourmet Chopped Cheese</a> sandwich that&apos;s already <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031020932/http://firstwefeast.com/features/2016/08/chopped-cheese-white-gold">garnered some scuttlebutt</a>. <em>Opening September at 375 Amsterdam Avenue</em></p>

<p><strong>abcV</strong> Shooting off of the famous <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031020932/http://gothamist.com/2015/07/01/ny_times_death_by_guacamole.php">pea guacamole debate</a>, Jean-Georges Vongerichten debuts an animal-free restaurant alongside his ABC Cocina inside ABC Carpet &amp; Home. Instead of trying to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031020932/http://gothamist.com/2016/07/26/david_chang_bloody_veg_burger.php">&quot;compensate&quot; for the lack of meat</a>, the chef will instead focus on highlighting the seasonal plant bounty. <em>Opening September at 38 East 19th Street</em></p>

<p><strong>UNNAMED PIZZA RESTAURANT BY KESTE TEAM</strong> Consistently <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031020932/http://gothamist.com/2015/09/17/best_pizza_nyc_final.php">making best of lists</a> in NYC, Keste&#x2014;the West Village pizzeria by Master Pizzaiolo Roberto Caporuscio&#x2014;is about to have a younger sibling with a new Financial District restaurant and pizza school that&apos;s too new to be named. Together with his daughter and future son-in-law, Caporuscio will offer 20 different types of pizza and teach pizza-making classes to individuals and groups. <em>Opening October at 77 Fulton Street</em></p>

<p><strong>LEUCA and WESTLIGHT</strong> If you&apos;ve taken a gander at the Williamsburg skyline of late, you may have noticed the incredibly tall building that looks like it&apos;s being supported by stilts. That&apos;s the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031020932/http://www.thewilliamvale.com/">William Vale</a> hotel, and it&apos;s where chef-restaurateur Andrew Carmellini will be cooking the wood-fired coastal cuisine of Southern Italy (Leuca). Up on the 22nd floor, a rooftop bar (Westlight) with street food bar snacks, cocktails and &quot;rare spirits.&quot; <em>Opening October at 111 North 12th Street</em></p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="021716_ramen.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031020932im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_rebeccaf/021716_ramen.jpeg" width="640" height="427"> <br> <i> Ramen Shack (Scott Lynch/Gothamist)</i></div> <p></p>

<p><strong>RAMEN SHACK</strong> Keizo Shimamoto has been hard at work <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031020932/http://gothamist.com/2015/06/25/ramen_burger_shack_queens.php">creating interesting ramen</a> all over the city in the past few years, popping up at places like Smorgasburg and elsewhere. Now, he&apos;s got a new permanent space to showcase his flavorful and fun noodle soups, like a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031020932/https://www.instagram.com/p/BJdjVs4DkVc/?taken-by=goramen">truffle shio</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031020932/https://www.instagram.com/p/BJaz69lDh9d/?taken-by=goramen">tori tan tan</a>. You&apos;ll also be able to score the full roster of Shimamoto&apos;s proprietary Ramen Burgers. <em>Opening week of September 26th at 13-13 40th Avenue in Long Island City</em></p>

<p><strong>AUGUSTINE and FOWLER &amp; WELLS</strong> The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031020932/http://gothamist.com/2014/09/24/beekman_renderings.php#photo-1">newly refurbished</a> 5 Beekman has been transformed into The Beekman Hotel, which&apos;ll have two restaurants by notable NYC chefs.

They&apos;ll be doing a few riffs on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031020932/http://gothamist.com/2015/07/15/french_dip_nyc_ultimate_guide.php">French Dip</a>, plus cocktails. <em>Opening September at 2315 Broadway</em></p>

<p><strong>DRUNKEN DUMPLING</strong> Fans of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031020932/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/31/how_to_eat_a_xiao_long_bao.php">xiao long bao</a> take note of this new dumpling heaven by a former Joe&apos;s Shanghai chef. They&apos;ll have tons of different kinds of dumplings, but it&apos;s all about the soup dumpling, including a Stony Mountain Ranch pork version in an hour-boiled pork bone broth, and a Crab Meat Dumpling with hand-picked crab meat in pork bone broth. <em>Opening September 14th at 137 1st Avenue</em></p>

<p><strong>HAROLD&apos;S MEAT + THREE</strong> Channel the cafeteria for the definition of meat and three, where diners select one meat and three sides to accompany it. Coming back strong from the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031020932/http://gothamist.com/2015/07/01/rip_commerce_west_village.php">closure of Commerce</a>, Harold Moore&apos;ll be channeling the South for this newcomer inside the Arlo Hotel in Hudson Square.

<p><strong>PHIL &amp; ANNE&apos;S GOOD TIME LOUNGE</strong> Anne Burrell, the spiky-haired chef you&apos;ll recognize if you watch anything on the <em>Food Network</em>, is launching her NYC restaurant this fall in Cobble Hill. The restaurant will turn out Mediterranean and Italian-influenced cuisine, arranged in an evolving menu from lighter (mushrooms and a poached egg) to heavier (brined pork chop with polenta) dishes. <em>Opening September at 196 Smith Street</em></p>

<p><strong>HARVEY</strong> Fresh off the success of his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031020932/http://gothamist.com/2016/05/21/bread_might_not_mess_with_your_wais.php">Brooklyn Bread Lab</a>, Chef Adam Leonti debuts a vegetable-focused restaurant inside The Williamsburg Hotel.

<p><strong>TIM HO WAN</strong> With the distinction as the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031020932/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/13/tim_ho_wan_dim_sum_nyc.php">world&apos;s cheapest Michelin-starred restaurant</a>, the arrival of this dim sun-centric eatery is bound to attract large crowds. Proprietor Mak Kwai Pui will be bringing prawn dumplings, baked buns and other dim sum specialities in addition to &quot;dishes appealing to American appetites, including &apos;high quality beef dishes.&apos;&quot; <em>Opening October at 85 Fourth Avenue at 10th Street</em></p>
