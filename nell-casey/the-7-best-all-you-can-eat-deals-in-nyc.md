From classy steakhouses to country barbecue joints, carb bombs to finger-licking crab boils, New York has unlimited options for every kind of palate, and sometimes at wallet-friendly prices, too. (And if bottomless booze is more your style, we&apos;ve <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429112607/http://gothamist.com/2014/02/20/bottomless_brunch.php">got you covered there too</a>.)</em></p><em>

<p><strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429112607/http://www.texasdebrazil.com/location/nyc">TEXAS DE BRAZIL</a></strong>: Of the city&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429112607/http://gothamist.com/2013/12/23/fogo_de_chao.php#photo-1">growing Brazilian steakhouse additions</a>, this Upper East Side newcomer wins hands down with the absolute best bang for your buck of unlimited meats. Fork over $59.99 and you&apos;ll be swarmed with waiters bearing succulent steaks and other meats skewered by massive swords, as tradition dictates. Of those, keep your eyes open for the perfectly medium-rare bacon-wrapped filet mignon and their signature picanha (top sirloin), sliced thinly and bursting with juicy flavor. </p>

<p>The flat fee also gives you access to their ample salad bar, stocked with a variety of cheeses, meats, veggies, sushi and other cold items plus a hot bar that includes rice, beans, potatoes and other hot items. Oh, and just <em>try</em> not to fill up on their addictive cheesy bread, which they&apos;ll deliver to your table when you order. </p>

<p>Unlike the circus-like atmosphere of many churrascarias, Texas de Brazil&apos;s handsome interior boasts decor less like a cruise ship buffet and more like an intimate steakhouse. It&apos;s a safe place to take a date, especially if they can really put it away.</p>

<p><em>Texas de Brazil is located at 1011 3rd Avenue, (212) 537-0060</em></p>

All the rolls, including pricey offerings like the Special King Crab Roll (spicy king crab with crunch, cucumber, topped with white tuna and avocado) and the Alligator Roll (salmon, avocado and crunch inside topped with eel) are fair game too; plus you get miso soup and salad, should you so desire. The deal also includes unlimited beer, wine and sake, which pleases the young, boisterous crowds that pack in on weekend nights.
