<p>It was just last year that ridiculously popular smoked meat master Dan Delaney <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150224020302/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/31/brisket_town.php">opened BrisketTown</a>, his first brick-and-morter outpost to sell his mouth-watering brisket to the eager masses. This morning Delaney announced that a Manhattan outpost, called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150224020302/http://delaneybbq.com/smokeline">SmokeLine</a>, will be opening up April 18th on the High Line at West 15th Street. </p>

<p>A detailed menu has yet to be released, but the cart will dish out Delaney&apos;s signature brisket, as well as other proteins, including a specific focus on ribs. There will also be new sandwiches offerings, including a decadent fried cheese and brisket option, plus an expanded pie menu from baker Rachell Roth. The seasonal location will also be mixing up made-to-order sodas to wash down all the meaty goodness.</p>

<p>The shop will operate in the Upper Chelsea Market Passage, which is already home to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150224020302/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/07/bark_hot_dogs_bringing_their_meat_t.php">Bark hot dogs</a>, Blue Bottle Coffee and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150224020302/http://www.thehighline.org/about/high-line-food">other satellite eateries</a>. You&apos;ll be able to get your barbecue fix Monday through Sunday from 11 a.m. to 9 p.m. starting this month and running until October 18th. </p>
