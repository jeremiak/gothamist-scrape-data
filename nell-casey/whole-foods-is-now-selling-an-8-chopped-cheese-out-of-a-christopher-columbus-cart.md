title: Whole Foods Is Now Selling An $8 Chopped Cheese Out Of A Christopher Columbus Cart
---

	
										<p>Here we are talking about the chopped cheese sandwich again, because someone at Whole Foods in Columbus Circle thought this might be fun:</p>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Holy shit they&apos;re selling chopped cheeses at Whole Foods. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161221193509/https://t.co/pvdpA3HyZi">pic.twitter.com/pvdpA3HyZi</a></p>&#x2014; Mitch Goldstein (@mgoldstein) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161221193509/https://twitter.com/mgoldstein/status/810902895587721217">December 19, 2016</a></blockquote>

<p>Yes, that&apos;s a bougie supermarket selling an $8 version of the iconic Harlem bodega sandwich, which many people have been accused of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161221193509/http://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2014/07/06/328466757/columbusing-the-art-of-discovering-something-that-is-not-new">Columbusing</a>, presented on a cart paying homage to Christopher Columbus. Yes, it&apos;s real, Whole Foods confirmed this afternoon.</p>

<p>To be sure, Whole Foods wasn&apos;t the first (and you can bet won&apos;t be the last!) to offer their own upscale take on the chopped cheese.</p>

<p>In February, Insider <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161221193509/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8P-A6O8p6w">published a video</a> about the sandwich that was roundly criticized for being tone deaf and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161221193509/http://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2014/07/06/328466757/columbusing-the-art-of-discovering-something-that-is-not-new">Columbusing</a> (a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161221193509/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBVptNzeTOQ">reaction video</a> responding to the original video has nearly six times as many views). </p>

<p>Though she <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161221193509/http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/15/dining/restaurant-review-meat-hook-sandwich-in-williamsburg-brooklyn.html">wasn&apos;t the first</a>, April Bloomfield <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161221193509/http://firstwefeast.com/features/2016/08/chopped-cheese-white-gold">drew some controversy</a> for announcing plans to sell a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161221193509/http://www.grubstreet.com/2016/08/april-bloomfield-chopped-cheese-sandwich-white-gold.html?mid=full-rss-grubstreet">&quot;guilt-free&quot; $15 chopped cheese</a> at her <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161221193509/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/08/april_bloomfields_white_gold_new_an.php#photo-1">new Upper West Side restaurant</a> (the restaurant&apos;s name&#x2014;White Gold&#x2014;didn&apos;t win it any favors). Then, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161221193509/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/08/nyregion/chopped-cheese-sandwich-harlem.html">the Times weighed in</a>.</p>

<p>We&apos;ve reached out to Whole Foods for some insight into the thinking that went into this, and we&apos;ll update when we hear back. </p>
