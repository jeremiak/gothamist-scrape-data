<p>A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171015140124/http://evgrieve.com/2012/04/downtown-auto-tire-has-left-bowery.html">former auto repair shop</a> has found new life as a place to stuff one&apos;s face with sandwiches and tacos. Tomorrow, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171015140124/http://www.thebowerymarket.com/">The Bowery Market</a> opens on Bowery at Great Jones Street, operating as a mini outdoor food hall with five vendors. It&apos;s quite darling, really!</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171015140124/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/26/alidoros_sandwiches_video.php">Sandwich makers</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171015140124/http://www.alidoronyc.com/">Alidoro</a> have their third NYC encampment here. They&apos;re joined by another outpost of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171015140124/http://www.thebutchersdaughter.com/">The Butcher&apos;s Daughter</a>, serving vegetarian dishes like breakfast burritos and &quot;Macro Bowls,&quot; plus a new spot to nab <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171015140124/http://www.pulquerianyc.com/">Pulqueria&apos;s</a> tacos. </p>

<p>A new sushi stand called Sushi on Jones and an offshoot of Greenpoint&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171015140124/https://www.championcoffee.com/">Champion Coffee</a> will also be on hand.</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="71316bowery2.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20171015140124im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_nellcasey/71316bowery2.jpg" width="640" height="317"> <br> <i> (Ken Moore)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>Though each of the little stalls is decked out to match each vendor&apos;s style&#x2014;Alidoro&apos;s cutesy tiles, for example&#x2014;the bones of the structure echo the space&apos;s former life with corrugated metal and the like. </p>

<p>The Market&apos;s open 8 a.m. to 9 p.m. and best of all, it&apos;s open year-round.</p>
