<p>A very meat-centric dinner unfolds on Friday at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160813163145/http://www.riverparknyc.com/">Riverpark</a>, Tom Colicchio&apos;s pretty restaurant/urban farm on East 29th Street. The restaurant is reviving the <strong>Beefsteak</strong> tradition for one night, with a bacchanalian celebration of bourbon, beer and beef&#x2014;eaten by hand. Guests should expect a three course, family-style dinner ($150) with dishes including leg of lam, standing rib roast, bone marrow and potato gratin, plus desserts including bananas foster and coconut cake. Beginning at 7:30 p.m. there&apos;ll be live music, plus Four Roses Bourbon, craft beer and a BYO wine option if you pay the corkage fee. Call the restaurant (212-729-9790) for reservations. </p>

<p>There are <strong>two new brunch options</strong> for day drinkers launching this weekend, beginning with a very French affair at Bushwick newcomer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160813163145/http://legaragebrooklyn.com/">Le Garage</a>. On the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160813163145/http://legaragebrooklyn.com/menu/">menu</a>: a Croque Madame ($13), Pain Perdu ($9) with roasted pineapple and a Pork Cheese Sandwich ($12) with satay and mixed greens. Over in Manhattan, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160813163145/http://www.louieandchan.com/">Louie and Chan</a> are also all about that brunch with dishes like a Lamb Burger topped with smoked mozzarella, pickled chiles, chives aioli, and tobacco onions and Lobster Toast, with avocado, pea sprouts and baby greens on dark rye sourdough bread.</p>

<p>For most people, karaoke is a late-night activity following one too many tequila shots. But <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160813163145/http://www.insabrooklyn.com/">Insa</a>, the newly launched Korean BBQ and karaoke spot in Gowanus, is taking the activity daytime, launching a <strong>karaoke lunch</strong> this Saturday and Sunday beginning at noon. Nosh on Korean barbecue meats then head into one of their festive karaoke rooms and keep the party going with kimchi-wasabi Bloody Mary ($12 with vodka, $10 with soju) or a Strong Island Ice Tea ($12) with white rum, coconut creme, passionfruit, peach, cardamon bitters and iced black tea.</p>
