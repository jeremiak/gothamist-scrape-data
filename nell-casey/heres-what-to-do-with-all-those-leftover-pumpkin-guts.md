<p>No doubt your coworkers or your roommates or your kids have at some point suggested the idea of a pumpkin carving party because, let&apos;s face it, you&apos;re never too old to go rooting around inside a giant squash and carve it into <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502103150/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/21/carve_a_pumpkin_at_crest_hardware_t.php">a work of art</a>. You could just throw out all the delightfully sticky innards you scoop out but you can also not be a <em>total wastrel</em> and instead use them to create some tasty snacks to enjoy post-pumpkin slaughter. We&apos;re giving you four suggestions as a jumping off point to get your pumpkin juices flowing.</p>

<p><strong>ROASTED PUMPKIN SEEDS</strong>: The simplest solution to an abundance of seeds is just to dress them and roast them in the oven. It takes minimal effort, doesn&apos;t require you to purchase extra ingredients and can be completed in under an hour after you&apos;ve excavated your pumpkin. Get rid of as much of the orange viscera as you can but don&apos;t worry if you have a few stray sticky strings on your seeds. </p>

<p>Melt a few tablespoons of butter (FINE, FINE OLIVE OIL IF YOU MUST BE HEALTHFUL) and toss them in with your cleaned seeds. Now, let your imagination run <em>wild</em>! Brown sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg makes for a satisfyingly sweet combo; salt, chili powder, cayenne and cumin for a little south of the border flavor; or even just plain old salt and pepper if you don&apos;t have any other spices on hand. </p>

<p>Roast the seeds at 375 for 20-30 minutes or until they look toasted. Let them cool and then snack away.</p>

<p><strong>PUMPKIN SEED BRITTLE</strong>: This preparation calls for a little more attention and mindfulness so as not to burn the crap out of the scalding hot sugar you&apos;ll be working with, but the end result is worth the little bit of effort. We&apos;re turning to domestic goddess Martha Stewart for her take on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502103150/http://www.marthastewart.com/340197/pumpkin-seed-brittle">pumpkin seed brittle</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li>1/2 stick unsalted butter, plus more for baking sheet</li>
<li>1/2 cup packed light brown sugar</li>
<li>1/4 cup honey</li>
<li>1 cup fresh pumpkin seeds, rinsed, dried and toasted</li>
</ul>

<p>Butter a large baking sheet or line it with parchment paper or a Silpat baking mat. </p>

<p>Melt the butter in a saucepan over medium heat then stir in the sugar and the honey. Cook the mixture&#x2014;without stirring!&#x2014;until it achieves a medium amber color, approximately 6 minutes. If you have a candy thermometer (seriously?) it should read about 280 degrees. At this time, stir in the pumpkin seeds and continue cooking for another 2 minutes. <em>Carefully</em> evacuate the molten hot liquid sugar mixture to the baking sheet and let it cool completely (seriously do not touch that with your bare hands what are you thinking?!).</p>

<p>Break into chunks and go to town.</p>

<p><strong>PUMPKIN RISOTTO</strong>: Now we&apos;ll turn to the gooey orange guts you&apos;ve painstakingly scraped from inside your giant squash. For this recipe, you&apos;ll need at least one cup of innards, so if you haven&apos;t scooped enough out you may need to substitute with a little bit of the solid-pack canned stuff, though judging from every single time I&apos;ve ever carved a pumpkin, you likely won&apos;t have a problem getting the correct amount unless you&apos;re carving up some dainty little thing. Adapted from the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502103150/http://www.nytimes.com/recipes/8757/pumpkin-risotto.html">NY Times</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>5 cups chicken (or veggie) stock</li>
<li>1/2 cup dry white wine</li>
<li>1 yellow onion, chopped</li>
<li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
<li>1 cup arborio rice (you really can&apos;t sub in regular short grain rice here)</li>
<li>1 cup pumpkin guts, pureed</li>
<li>2 teaspoons thyme, chopped</li>
<li>Mascarpone, ricotta or goat cheese, whatever you prefer</li>
<li>Parmesan cheese (if you take it from the green bottle I will hunt you down and knock if out of your hands)</li>
<li>olive oil</li>
<li>1-2 tablespoons butter</li>
<li>salt and pepper</li>
</ul>

<p>Heat the stock over medium heat until it&apos;s just below a simmer. </p>

<p>Heat a few glugs of olive oil and the butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add the onions and garlic, cooking until fragrant and translucent. Add in the rice, gently toasting it for a few minutes. Add the wine, cooking until it&apos;s almost all evaporated. Slowly ladle in the hot stock one cup at a time, waiting until the liquid has almost completely evaporated before adding in the next cup. Continue to slowly add stock until the rice has plumped and softened but still retains a little bite. You may not use all of the stock, FYI.</p>

<p>Stir in the pumpkin puree, the two kinds of cheese, thyme, salt and pepper. Keep on the heat until everything is warmed through.</p>

<p>Garnish with a dollop of cheese or extra grated Parmesan and serve immediately.</p>
