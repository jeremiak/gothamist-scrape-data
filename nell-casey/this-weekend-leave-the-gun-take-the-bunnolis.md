<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160428155618/http://www.pineboxrockshop.com/">Bushwick</a> edition of the <strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160428155618/https://veganshopup.wordpress.com/">Vegan Shop Up</a></strong> is welcoming some brand-new vendors this Saturday to their lineup of cruelty-free eats and products. Pop-up supper club <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160428155618/http://www.mississippivegan.com/january/pop-up-supper">Mississippi Vegan</a> will be making an appearance, as will <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160428155618/https://www.facebook.com/The-Bunnoli-627728597361055/timeline">The Bunnoli</a> (vegan cannoli), <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160428155618/http://www.riverdelcheese.com/">Riverdel Vegan Cheese</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160428155618/https://www.instagram.com/theveganznyc/">The Veganz</a>, a vegan apparel and accessories shop. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160428155618/https://veganshopup.wordpress.com/about/">rest of the lineup</a> includes burgers, pot pies, brownies, mac and cheese, empanadas and a host of other animal product-free foods. </p>

<p>Soup gets unfairly marginalized, in our opinion, but on Sunday, the <strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160428155618/http://thetakedowns.com/2016-soup-takedown/">Brooklyn Soup Takedown</a></strong> brings the liquid lunch up to hero status with an amateur competition for the best bisques and bouillabaisses. From noon to 2 p.m., the Royal Palms Shuffleboard Club hosts chowders, chicken noodles, split peas and the like to see whose soup reigns supreme. Tickets are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160428155618/http://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/2479222/">$20</a> to sip and slurp the soups, with a portion of ticket sales benefitting the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160428155618/http://womenseducationproject.org/">Women&apos;s Education Project</a>.</p>
