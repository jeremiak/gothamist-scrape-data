<p>The pesky brown fuzz that protects the sweet flesh of the kiwi has irritated lovers of the fruit with its tendency to stick to <em>everything</em>. Now scientists in New Zealand are attempting to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408084128/http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304914904579437310965568526?mg=reno64-wsj&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fonline.wsj.com%2Farticle%2FSB10001424052702304914904579437310965568526.html">rid the fruit of its hairy exterior</a> and develop either a new skin that peels more easily or get rid of the skin completely. &quot;When you actually look at the top 10 fruits in the world, six of the top 10 are convenience products,&quot; Lain Jager, chief executive of Zespri, the world&apos;s biggest kiwi exporting company <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408084128/http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304914904579437310965568526?mg=reno64-wsj&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fonline.wsj.com%2Farticle%2FSB10001424052702304914904579437310965568526.html">told the Wall Street Journal</a>. &quot;Having a kiwifruit that you could eat in a convenient way would be fantastic.&quot;</p>

<p>Zespri has produced several prototypes but so far the efforts have been rejected by so-called kiwi sommeliers (!), whose job it is to sample up to 30 kiwis a day during harvest season. Early failures included a version with an &quot;easy-peel pale gray skin&quot; and a better-looking white fuzz version that, while beautiful inside and out, didn&apos;t cut it in the flavor department. Kiwi taster Elizabeth Popowski has even eaten versions of the fruit with &quot;hints of kerosene.&quot;</p>

<p>The kiwi industry in New Zealand makes up $1 billion of the country&apos;s economy and Zespri hopes that the millions they&apos;re pouring into development of the naked kiwi&#x2014;along with tax payer funds from the government&#x2014;will push that figure higher. The company previously created a gold kiwi more resistant to bacteria, as well as a new variety of spicy kiwi with an orange interior, but it&apos;s the traditional fruit they&apos;re most concerned with perfecting. It&apos;s their shot to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408084128/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/10/open_wide_for_genetically_modified.php">take down the apple market</a>.</p>
