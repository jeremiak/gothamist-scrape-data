title: NYC's Best Old School Jukeboxes
---

	
										<p><em>In this age of the internet jukebox, every song can be made available with a simple click, but remember those days when your music choices were confined to, <em>gasp</em>, pre-selected CDs?! (Props if you also recall the days of the vinyl jukebox!) If you&apos;re feeling nostalgic, check out our selections for the best NYC jukeboxes from back in the day and put another <strike>dime</strike> dollar in the jukebox, baby.</em></p>

Curated by manager Bill Judkins for the past 22 years, the jukebox reads like a music nerd\'s Who\'s Who of \"early rock\'n\'roll, blues, country, 60s soul and 70s funk.\" You may not recognize many of the names but that\'s all part of Judkins\'s philosophy: \"There are all these great records that not many people know about and the people who do know about them keep them sealed and nobody gets to hear them. I like to find these great records and put them out there.\" Judkins has collected over 3,000 45s to date and he\'s still looking. Stop in to hear Clarence Gatemouth Brown, The Raincoats and \"Hot Grits!!!\" by Elijah & the Ebonies. Or just do as we did and select random numbers; trust us, you can\'t go wrong. You also can\'t go wrong with $3 drafts during Happy Hour and a daily changing menu that features Southern favorites like gumbo, BBQ ribs and jalapeÃ±o cornbread.\<\/p\>\r\n\<p\>\<em\>Price: $1 for 5 songs\<\/em\>\<\/p\>\r\n\r\n\<p\>\<em\>54 Great Jones Street, NoHo, 212-674-9304\<\/em\>\<\/p\>", "credit":""};galleryObj['photo_2'] = photo;</script>

Owner Jimmy Duff has stocked his jukebox with all the regular metal characters plus some obscure tidbits for the diehard fans. For an added twist, Duff\'s rotates through a collection of off-beat CDs, including Pee Wee Herman and TV theme songs. In addition to the jukebox, Duffs provides entertainment in the form of \"weird VHS tapes\" that are played on two screens behind the bar; on a recent visit, bar patrons were treated to a video montage of nubile young women taking off their bras. Spin the \"Wheel of Misfortune\" for a chance to win a $5 jukebox credit or a shot of \"Coney Island Whitefish\" (a shot of Baileys served in an (unused!) condom) among other boozy prizes.\<\/p\> \r\n\<p\>\<em\>Price: $1 for 2 songs, $2 for 5 songs; FREE on Sundays\<\/em\>\<\/p\>\r\n\r\n\<p\>\<em\>168 Marcy Ave., South Williamsburg, 718-599-2092\<\/em\>\<\/p\>", "credit":""};galleryObj['photo_3'] = photo;</script>

Owner Lauren describes the jukebox choices as \"escape music... stuff that\'s easy to listen to when it\'s loud,\" meaning Wolf Parade, Bob Dylan and Heart are here alongside MIA, Iggy Pop and Grace Jones. The eclectic selection also includes several soundtracks, most notably John Cameron Mitchell\'s \<em\>Hedwig and the Angry Inch\<\/em\> and 2009\'s \<em\>Pirate Radio\<\/em\>. The CDs will be changed out in the next few weeks, moving into more American soul and southern rock to accompany the bar\'s expanded bourbon list. In addition to the booze, there is also the beer, 27 taps to be exact, including Old Speckled Hen, Hofbrau Dunkel and Keegan Mother\'s Milk Stout (all $3 during happy hour).\<\/p\> \r\n\<p\>\<em\>Price: $1 for 2 songs, $2 for 5 songs, $5 for 18 songs\<\/em\>\<\/p\>\r\n\r\n\<p\>\<em\>211 Ave. A, East Village, 212-260-2914\<\/em\>\<\/p\>", "credit":""};galleryObj['photo_4'] = photo;</script>

Neil Young, Rush, Alanis Morrisette, Barenaked Ladies - all the Canadian mainstays plus the expected Bowie and Beatles to add variety. All of the CDs are handwritten mixes, including many that are made by regulars, notably the John Candy approved \"Canfuckingda Canadian Supermix,\" which features Loverboy, Leonard Cohen and Tokyo Police Club (who knew Canada was so diverse??).

This may be the only place where Operation Ivy, Flight of the Concords, Oasis, Ted Nugent, The Misfits and Run DMC all fit comfortably together. $4 Buds and $5 Kirin Ichiban keep the locals well lubricated while the skull decor and Ms. Pac Man game remind us not to take everything quite so seriously.\<\/p\>\r\n\<p\>\<em\>Price: $1 for 3 songs, $2 for 7 songs, $5 for 18 songs\<\/em\>\<\/p\>\r\n\r\n\<p\>\<em\>7 Ave. A, East Village, 212-375-1352\<\/em\>\<\/p\>\r\n", "credit":""};galleryObj['photo_7'] = photo;</script>
