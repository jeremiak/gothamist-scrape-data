Birdie flew over to Dumbo (via the East River Ferry) to join Gothamist staffers for a trip on Jane&apos;s Carousel, a game of peek-a-Birdie in the Tobacco Warehouse and finally for a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406162607/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/27/take_a_moment_and_change_the_course.php">screening in Brooklyn Bridge Park</a>.</p>

<p>As the mascot for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406162607/http://www.nyc.gov/html/greenyc/html/home/home.shtml">GreeNYC</a>, Birdie&apos;s on a mission to educate New Yorkers about ways to live more sustainably, which is part of a larger city goal of reducing our greenhouse gas emissions, diverting waste from landfills and generally making the city&apos;s environment a better place. Never one to abandon his cause even when on vacation, Birdie even <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406162607/https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=620156658025317&amp;set=pb.153806571326997.-2207520000.1378237816.&amp;type=3&amp;theater">took his message to Gracie Mansion</a>, a gesture we hope inspires the next mayor of NYC to keep him around.</p>
