<p>Sorry noise-sensitive LES dwellers, but your <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160311113329/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/22/new_les_soho_house_draws_ire_from_p.php">plea for a less-boozy Ludlow House</a> has gone unanswered. The State Liquor Authority approved a liquor license for the forthcoming iteration of SoHo House, which will take over the space at 139 Ludlow Street to host <strike>raucous booze-fueled parties</strike> private events for its members, much to the chagrin of locals. </p>

<p>A rep for the members-only club issued the following statement about today&apos;s ruling:</p>

<blockquote>It was extremely important to Soho House that we went through this process and had open and honest dialogue with the residents of Ludlow and the surrounding area.  We are immensely grateful to the residents who supported us and we hope we can earn the trust of those that didn&#x2019;t.  We truly believe that opening a House on Ludlow will enhance an already incredibly creative area. We are particularly excited about our relationship with the Educational Alliance, providing this Lower East Side non-profit organisation [sic] free use of a community space in the building.</blockquote>

<p>A report by neighborhood blog <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160311113329/http://www.thelodownny.com/leslog/2013/10/more-on-todays-approval-of-soho-houses-les-liquor-license.html">The Lo-Down</a> indicates that approval was granted for liquor consumption in the indoor parts of the club but instituted a &quot;no-liquor&quot; policy for the proposed rooftop pizza counter. The approval also requires doors on the glassed-in fifth floor space to remain closed at all times. Dennis Rosen, the chairman of the State Liquor Authority, conceded he wouldn&apos;t object to revisiting the idea of outdoor imbibing once the club had been open for a few years. </p>
