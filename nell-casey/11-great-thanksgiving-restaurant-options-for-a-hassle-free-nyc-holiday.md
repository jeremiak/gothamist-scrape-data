<p>While the idea of cooking a lavish holiday meal for family and friends might seem exciting and &quot;grown-up,&quot; the logistics of cooking a large-scale meal in a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151009025355/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/24/video_small_studio_apartments.php">small-scale living space</a> are difficult to overcome.

From turkey traditionalists to pumpkin pie provocateurs, there&apos;s something here for everyone.</p>

Other Mediterranean-style dishes round out each of the three courses, including a Ras El Hanout Braised Lamb entree with figs, carrots and couscous and a Turkish Rice Pudding flavored with cinnamon and golden raisins for dessert. <em>54 Thompson Street // 212-878-6305 // 1 p.m. to 9 p.m.</em></p>
