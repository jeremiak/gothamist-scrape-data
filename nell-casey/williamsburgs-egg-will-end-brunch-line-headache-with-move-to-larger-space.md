<p>The end is in sight for the generation-spanning brunch line at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140330023142/http://www.eggrestaurant.com/">Egg</a>, with news that the perennially popular eatery is moving to bigger digs a few blocks down the road. Next month the biscuits and grits emporium takes over the former <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140330023142/http://www.parishhall.net/">Parish Hall</a> space, the sister restaurant owner George Weld closes on Friday, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140330023142/http://ny.eater.com/archives/2014/01/george_weld_to_move_egg_into_the_parish_hall_space.php">according to Eater</a>. In addition to accommodating more guests, the revamped Egg will see chef Evan Hanczor in the kitchen whipping up the popular Southern-flecked egg dishes and fried chicken lunches. </p>

<p>Weld plans to make a few renovations to the space at 109a North 3rd Street to prepare for the arrival of Egg; he hasn&apos;t yet decided what to do with the former space. Those craving Country Ham Biscuits in the meantime shouldn&apos;t worry: Egg&apos;s original location on North 5th Street will remain open until moving day. Juliette will continue to be a shitshow.</p>
