<p>Governor Cuomo has announced the distinction of New York&apos;s first licensed farm cidery will be awarded to Albany-based <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150310070308/http://ninepincider.com/">Nine Pin Cider</a>. Late last year the Governor signed legislation that institutes a new license program for farm cideries, which will enable them to do things like operate an on-site tap room with the potential to boost their revenue. </p>

<p>Nine Pin Cider can now legally sell pints of the hard apple goodness to visitors of their downtown brewery; the new legislation also allows for an increase in a cider&apos;s ABV, up to 8.5% from 7%. And all was right with the world.</p>

<p>If they so choose, the del Peral family, who run Nine Pin, are also allowed to sell New York-based beers, wines and spirits plus other locally made products like jams, mustards and crafts. It could turn the cideries into community outlets that promote regional industry, helping to boost the local economy and grow production on local goods. </p>

<p>Other cideries are encouraged to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150310070308/http://www.sla.ny.gov/">apply for a license</a>; there are currently no ciders operating in New York City, so hopefully this will promote some boozy apple entrepreneurs to start up in the five boroughs. </p>
