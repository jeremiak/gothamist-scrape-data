<p>Of all the biscuit toppers, none is more beloved than rich, creamy, meaty sausage gravy. Whether you&apos;re struggling through a hangover, need to bulk up before hitting the slopes or are just...really hungry!...this gut-busting comfort food gets the job done anytime, anyplace. The classic iteration calls for pork sausage, but if you don&apos;t dig on swine you can substitute chicken or turkey; just be aware that you&apos;re cutting the fat&#x2014;and therefore some of the flavor&#x2014;so you may need to bump up the butter in the recipe below.  </p>

<p><strong>Sausage Gravy Ingredients</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>2-3 sweet Italian sausages (depending on how much you like da meatz), removed from their casings </li>
<li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
<li>1/8 cup flour</li>
<li>1 cup light cream</li>
<li>1 cup milk</li>
<li>1 tablespoon ground sage</li>
<li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
</ul>

<p>You&apos;ll also need: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422204956/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/14/skip_the_hype_and_make_your_own_dam.php">Freshly Baked Biscuits</a>.</p>

<p>Heat a large, heavy-bottomed pan over medium heat. Add the sausage links, breaking them up into crumbles with a spoon as they begin to cook. Sprinkle the sausage with the sage. Brown the sausage until it&apos;s just cooked through and then evacuate the crumbles to a paper towel-lined plate, reserving the rendered fat and brown bits left on the bottom of your pan. </p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="111113sausage_pan.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422204956im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_nellcasey/111113sausage_pan.jpg" width="640" height="427"> <br> <i> <span class="photo_caption">(Nell Casey/Gothamist)</span></i></div> <p></p>

<p>While the sausage browns, heat up the light cream and milk in the microwave (or stovetop, fancypants) for about one minute or until hot but not scalded. Set aside.</p>

<p>Now we&apos;re going to make a roux from the pan drippings, butter and flour, which will thicken the gravy and also collect all the flavorful bits from the bottom of the pan. Add the butter and flour to the hot pan and whisk around, collecting some of the brown gunk on the bottom. Cook the flour for at least 20 seconds to get out the raw flavor. Next, grab your warm milk and slowly&#x2014;<em>slowly</em>&#x2014;begin to add it to the pan, making sure to whisk constantly as you do this. </p>

<p>I was whisking and pouring so I couldn&apos;t snap a photo, but so long as you incorporate the milk slowly and try to whisk out any lumps you should be just fine. You got this, dawg. I <em>believe</em> in you!</p>

<p>Once you&apos;ve added all the milk, let the mixture come so a slow simmer and then reduce the heat to low. You&apos;ll notice the mixture start to thicken quickly, so keep an eye out so it doesn&apos;t dry out/form a crust/become goopy. If things get a little too congealed, add a splash of milk to thin it out. </p>

<p>Add the sausage crumbles into your gravy so they can warm through. Taste your gravy: it definitely needs something, right? Add in a lot of freshly ground black pepper; like, a lot. You might need to add a little salt, too, especially if you&apos;re using a poultry sausage or if you are a deer and really enjoy salt. </p>

<p>You&apos;ll want to serve the gravy immediately because it cools quickly and although still tasty it looses a little something when cold. Use boiling water to heat up your serving vessel beforehand then dump the water and add gravy immediately to keep it warmer longer.</p>

<p>Or just eat directly from the pan.</p>
