<p>Americans are turning up their noses at artificially manufactured plant fats and instead are returning to the world&apos;s most perfect creation: butter. A study by the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140213041403/http://www.nmpf.org/ABI">American Butter Institute</a> showed that Americans are reaching for the golden cream of the gods by the droves, resulting in a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140213041403/http://www.latimes.com/business/money/la-fi-mo-butter-20140107,0,6405296.story#axzz2pvxBO4pP">40-year high in 2012</a>. We were consuming 5.6 pounds of butter per person in 2012, up from 4.1 pounds in 1997 and beginning in 2002, butter consumption grew by 25%. </p>

<p>The ABI, which represents most of the butter manufacturers in the United States, believes this uptick can be attributed to the shunning of artificial and processed foods like margarine. These products are essentially made of trans fats, which contribute to raised LDL (&quot;bad&quot;) cholesterol and lowered HDL (&quot;good&quot;) cholesterol levels; the FDA has even made moves to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140213041403/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/07/fda_ban_trans_fats.php">ban the substance</a>. Butter isn&apos;t great for your ticker either, given its high saturated fat content, but at least it&apos;s all natural and not filled with chemicals. </p>

<p>So slather with pride, America! Just don&apos;t <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140213041403/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/10/are_school_kitchen_managers_being_b.php">give any to your kids</a>. </p>
