<p>Is the Doughnut Plant planning to bring their delicious fried dough creations to upper Manhattan? It&apos;s very possible, as a tipster <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406145908/http://www.boweryboogie.com/2013/04/doughnut-plant-looking-to-expand-uptown/">told Bowery Boogie</a> that the bakery was scouting locations on either the Upper West or Upper East side with the help of brokerage firm Lee &amp; Associates. They&apos;re reportedly looking at spaces between 400 and 1,000 square feet, so either some kind of storefront or possibly a larger cafe. Either way, it&apos;s great news for fancy doughnut lovers who queue up at the bakery&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406145908/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/14/doughnut_plant_now_open_at_hotel_ch.php#photo-1">other locations</a> to gorge on Blackout Cake and Peanut Butter &amp; Banana Cream-filled confections. </p>

<p>We reached out to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406145908/http://doughnutplant.com/history/">Doughnut Plant owner Mark Isreal</a> for more, and we&apos;ll update if we gather any more crumbs. </p>
