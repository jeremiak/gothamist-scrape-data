<p>You can put a lot of things into ice cream to make it even better, like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016144115/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/10/a_whiskey_ice_cream_flight_is_the_o.php">whiskey</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016144115/http://gothamist.com/2015/05/29/milkmade_tasting_room_carroll_garde.php#photo-1">pretzels</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016144115/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8Lg5FybTv0">your face</a>. Companies like Ben &amp; Jerry&apos;s have carved out a little niche for themselves by adding things like brownies and cookie bits to their creations, but now NYC has their own home-grown version with two new babka/ice cream flavor collaborations between powerhouse ice cream makers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016144115/http://www.amplehills.com/">Ample Hills</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016144115/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/12/mekelburgs_prospect_heights.php#photo-1">powerhouse porchetta makers</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016144115/http://www.mekelburgs.com/">Mekelburg&apos;s</a>. </p>

<p>The duo made the new ice creams using Mekelburg&apos;s super tasty babkas, picking up where Ample Hills left off with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016144115/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/23/ample_hills_is_scooping_matzo_ice_c.php">the matzo ice cream</a>. Babka Days Are Here Again is a vanilla base with chunks of the cinnamon babka and I Love It When You Call Me Big Babka is a milk chocolate base with pieces of chocolate babka. The twisted cake remains astonishingly airy given its submersion into frozen cream, maintaining the crispy layers of dough throughout the freezing process. </p>

<p>The restaurant sold around 300 pints this weekend as part of their one year anniversary celebrations.</p>

<p>Mekelburg&apos;s is selling the creation at its Clinton Hill digs in pints ($12.95) for off-site consumption&#x2014;and soon they&apos;ll launch online sales&#x2014;though you&apos;d be a fool to miss out on the restaurant&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016144115/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/17/best_new_restaurants_2015.php">excellent food and beer</a> in addition to their backyard. </p>

<p>We&apos;re told they&apos;re also using the babka ice creams as a base for a banana split as soon as their special ice cream boats arrive in the mail. It&apos;ll be a base of thin cut slices of chocolate babka topped with a mix of both babka ice creams with bananas, of course. </p>
