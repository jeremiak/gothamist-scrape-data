</div></div>					<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151031115911/http://eatfeastnyc.com/">Feast</a>, a new <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151031115911/http://eatfeastnyc.com/about/">concept restaurant</a> focusing on large format, seasonal meals opens in the East Village today. Feast styles its menu around the idea of dinner parties, where diners &quot;share plates of food and long conversations&quot; as they would dining at someone&apos;s home. Two different &quot;feasts&quot; are available at dinner time, including a Union Square Greenmarket feast that changes with the seasons and a nose-to-tail feast focused around a rotating selection of animals. Diners are seated around large, communal tables made from reclaimed wood, surrounded by vintage pieces like a cast iron stove from Cape Cod, hay pulleys and picture frames.</p>

<p>Chef Christopher Meenan chose lamb as his opening protein, offering a $48 per person Mighty Lamb Feast that includes lamb carpaccio, Merguez stew with tomato, &quot;shepherd&apos;s pie&quot;, potato gratin and lamb lasagna among other courses. The vegetarian USQ Farmer&apos;s Market Feast runs $38 per person and includes a smoked goat cheese tart with forest mushrooms, spaghetti squash with mushroom bolognese and roasted cauliflower with hazelnuts and grapes. Both feasts include a special dessert by pastry chef Emily Wallendjack and wine and beer pairings are available at a supplement. </p>

<p>Both feast options require full table participation, but smaller parties are welcome to order off the additional <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151031115911/http://eatfeastnyc.com/menu/feasts/">a la carte menu</a>, with dishes like &quot;steak n&apos; egg ($22) with oxtail and cripsy bernaise egg or porcini crusted halibut ($25) with eggplant caviar, spinach and a truffle emulsion. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s okay to dabble,&#x201D; says owner Brian Ghaw, &#x201C;but ultimately we want you to tell your friends and come back with a group to &apos;feast.&apos;&quot;</p>

<p>Ghaw, who runs the delightful <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151031115911/http://www.savoybakery.com/">Savoy Bakery</a> in East Harlem&#x2014;this author must resist temptation to buy the pork buns and turkey bacon and cheese buns on her daily commute&#x2014;brings some of his freshly made dough downtown each morning to bake breakfast pastries on site at Feast. The restaurant opens daily at 7:30 a.m. to serve up coffee and the breakfast bites to the locals. Look for Saturday and Sunday brunch arriving sometime in April and lunch soon to follow thereafter.</p>

<p><em>102 3rd Avenue; 212-529-8880. Feast is open 7:30 a.m. - 11 p.m. Monday through Wednesday; 7:30 a.m. - 1 a.m. Thursday through Saturday; and 7:30 a.m. - 4 p.m. Sunday (closed for dinner)</em></p>
