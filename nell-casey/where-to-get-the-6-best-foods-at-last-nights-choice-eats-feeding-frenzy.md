Crispy without being greasy, salty without being inedible, these delightful porky puffs struck the perfect balance between heavy and light. The effervescent accompanying smoked yogurt dip sent this salty snack into heavenly territory.\<br\>\r\n\r\n\<em\>92 Calyer Street, Greenpoint // 347-889-6323\<\/em\>", "credit":""};galleryObj['photo_2'] = photo;</script>

Known as an established Jewish deli for decades, the restaurant was recently taken over by Muslim owners who have stayed true to the spot\'s beefy origins. Perhaps inspired by the upcoming St. Patrick\'s Day holiday, we hastened to nosh on the wonderfully pink corned beef, served with spicy mustard between two slices of rye bread. Driven into bovine bliss by the salty and moist corned beef, we hastily scarfed the equally delicious pastrami and brisket offerings until we\'d filled our gullet past the socially acceptable point. \<br\>\r\n\r\n\<em\>533 Nostrand Avenue, Bedford-Stuyvesant // 718-789-1155\<\/em\>", "credit":""};galleryObj['photo_3'] = photo;</script>

Of course their BBQ pork and headcheese bahn mi on hand was delicious, but it was their new offering, called the Hog Taco, that really impressed us. Sweet, buttery pork was nestled into a corn tortilla and paired with traditional crunchy, veggie bahn mi offerings like pickled carrots and daikons all topped with a generous squeeze of chili mayo. An extra squirt of sriracha made this melt in your mouth taco a true standout.\<br\> \r\n\r\n\<em\>96 St Marks Place // 212-388-1688\<\/em\>\r\n", "credit":""};galleryObj['photo_4'] = photo;</script>

Melt-in-your-mouth shredded goat meat was sandwiched between two buttery slices of Japanese Texas toast and served with a palate-cleansing serving of pickled jalapenos and onions. The meat and bread were oh-so-fatty and were perfectly offset by the vinegary veg as we took alternating bites. We certainly weren\'t expecting to be floored by a goat sandwich but are so very glad that Goat Town knew us better than we knew ourselves.\<br\>\r\n\r\n\<em\>511 East 5th Street // 212-687-3641\<\/em\>", "credit":""};galleryObj['photo_5'] = photo;</script>

Last night they were handing out decadently rich baby chocolate bourbon cakesâmade with Kings County Distillery\'s bourbonâwhich appealed to both our sweet tooth and our boozy tendencies. Subtly sweet, outrageously moist and with just a slight hint of smokiness, these mini cakes elicited a perfectly appropriate moan slash sigh as we felt all our dessert dreams come true. \<br\>\r\n\r\n\<em\>415 Graham Avenue, Williamsburg // 718-766-7419\<\/em\>", "credit":""};galleryObj['photo_6'] = photo;</script>
