</div></div>					<p>In March, P.J. Hanley&apos;s&#x2014;the bar with the distinction of being &quot;Brooklyn&apos;s oldest&quot;&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508072815/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/26/pj_hanleysbrooklyns_oldest_barclose.php">shuttered after 139 years</a> of pint-slinging in the borough. After owner James McGown filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in February, rumors began that the space would host a Belgian beer garden later in the spring, forgoing the space&apos;s history for an entirely new concept. That did not come to pass, however, and instead McGown has reopened the bar as Goldenrod, a nod to an 1890s beer from a long-gone area brewery.</p>

<p>The space has been restored to its turn-of-the-century look, or at least as close as one can get without getting rid of necessary contemporary amenities. The pressed tin ceilings and carved wooden bar remain and the proprietor has added lots of sawdust to the floor because back in the day Brooklynites eschewed brooms, or something. All of that makes the outdoor &quot;beer garden&quot; a bit startling in its modernity, though nobody is likely to quibble about continuity when downing cold ones in the warm bath of sunset.</p>

<p>Being that it&apos;s a hat tip to the old Otto Huber Brewery, Goldenrod commissioned some private label brews for its lineup, including a Goldenrod Pilsner made by Brooklyn Brewery and a Goldenrod Ale made by Olde Saratoga Brewing Co. Additionally, the bar offers 20 beers on tap and 20 in the bottle/can plus a bespoke Goldenrod Moonshine distilled by Breuckelen Gin. McGown operates next door South Brooklyn Pizza, which imbibers can now order up at the bar. Salads, burgers and a selection of spreads &quot;in a jar&quot; are also available. Small plates ($4-$9) including gastropub&apos;y offerings like Truffle &apos;Shrooms, PEI Mussels and Tempura Green Beans. </p>
