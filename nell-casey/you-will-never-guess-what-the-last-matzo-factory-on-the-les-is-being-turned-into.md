<p>The Streit family <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160427031345/http://gothamist.com/2015/01/06/streits_matzo_factory_leaving_les.php">announced the departure</a> of their matzo factory from its home on the Lower East Side at the beginning of this year, concluding a 90-year run Rivington Street. In May, it was reported that developers Cogswell Realty, a midtown-based firm, had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160427031345/http://gothamist.com/2015/05/11/streits_mazto_factory_sold_to_devel.php">purchased the site</a> for a reported $30.5 million. And now, the revelation that the developers have plans to convert the former factory site into a condo have been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160427031345/http://therealdeal.com/blog/2015/12/15/from-matzo-to-millennials-streits-les-factory-to-go-condo/">reported by The Real Deal</a>. And <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160427031345/http://gothamist.com/2015/01/07/beloved_old_les_venue_will_become_c.php">so it goes</a>. </p>

<p>The developers filed an application with the Attorney General to build out 45 residential condo units, a commercial condo and 26 storage units in the space. Permits were also filed in October to demolish the top floors to bring in 10,000-square-feet of retail space. Looking at Cogswell&apos;s other properties in Downtown Manhattan, Harlem and Newark, a new mixed-used building was all but inevitable. </p>

<p>Just a few blocks away, developer Ben Shaoul is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160427031345/http://gothamist.com/2015/04/08/houston_street_is_dead.php">transforming a section of Houston</a> into a shiny and soulless block of condos. Over on Essex Street, 45-year-old Vic&apos;s Pizzeria was pushed out to make room for a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160427031345/http://gothamist.com/2015/11/24/rip_vics_pizza_les.php">fancy new apartment building</a>, causing one local to quip the neighborhood was &quot;becoming a rich white girl&apos;s dorm.&quot; A dorm with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160427031345/http://gothamist.com/2015/05/30/dont_worry_in_two_years_well_have_a.php">luxury bowling alleys</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160427031345/http://gothamist.com/2014/10/28/eclair_cafe_les.php#photo-1">eclair cafes</a> instead of cheap slices and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160427031345/http://gothamist.com/2014/06/30/beloved_lower_east_side_turkish_joi.php#photo-1">24-hour falafel</a> is no dorm at all.</p>
