<p>In January, Danny Meyer&apos;s Union Square Hospitality group <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170501235231/http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20170123005268/en/Union-Square-Hospitality-Group-Affiliates-Strategic-Investment">announced an investment</a> in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170501235231/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_wave_of_coffee">third wave coffee</a> purveyor Joe Coffee, with an eye towards expanding the company both in NYC and across the country. The first several new shops have now been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170501235231/http://nypost.com/2017/04/30/joe-coffee-opening-up-four-new-locations/">announced by the NY Post</a>, which reports that four new Joe Coffee shops will open in NYC this year. </p>

<p>A new Joe stand opening Monday in Bryant Park will feature treats from Meyer&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170501235231/https://ny.eater.com/2016/10/31/13480212/bryant-park-holiday-market-food-nyc">casual cafe Public Fare</a>, a seasonal pop-up in the park. Another will open in Brooklyn Heights on Hicks Street, the chain&apos;s first expansion into Brooklyn. Locations at 185 Greenwich Street and 271 Amsterdam Avenue will also open in 2017. </p>

<p>And Joe Coffee is now available aboard the city&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170501235231/http://gothamist.com/2017/05/01/nyc_ferry_debut.php#photo-15">new ferry service</a>, where a hot cup of joe will cost you $3. (An iced Joe coffee costs $4 on board.)</p>

<p>&quot;In 2018, we also hope to select one more city outside of New York and Philadelphia to plant roots,&quot; owner Jonathan Rubinstein promised. Rubinstein <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170501235231/http://joenewyork.com/about/">started the business</a> in 2003 with a single shop in the West Village and the brand now boasts over a dozen <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170501235231/http://joenewyork.com/locations/">locations</a> and can be found as the house coffee brand in restaurants. </p>
