<p>It&apos;s not just struggling mom-and-pop shops that suffer under the weight of insane rent gouging. The iconic <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150607145447/http://www.fourseasonsrestaurant.com/">Four Seasons Restaurant</a> may be ousted from its longtime digs inside the Seagram Building if lease negotiations with the building&apos;s owner don&apos;t swing in their favor. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150607145447/http://pagesix.com/2014/02/05/four-season-restaurant-may-be-forced-out-of-famed-location/">The Post reports</a> that a lender stipulation in a $783 million mortgage taken out by building owner Aby Rosen requires a substantial rent increase. The current $20 per square foot lease would increase to $105 per square foot, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150607145447/http://ny.eater.com/archives/2014/02/the_four_seasons_might_only_have_eight_left.php">according to Eater</a>. </p>

<p>Four Seasons co-owner Julian Niccolini remains optimistic despite the rumors. &quot;We&apos;ve been here since 1959, and we&apos;ll be here for another 15 years.&quot; If the parties can&apos;t come to an agreement when the restaurant&apos;s lease expires in 2016 then the eatery will be forced to vacate. </p>

<p>There&apos;s further speculation that Rosen may want to open his own restaurant if the Four Seasons is successfully ousted. A famous Picasso tapestry owned by the New York Landmarks Conservancy will be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150607145447/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/04/business/at-four-seasons-picasso-tapestry-hangs-on-the-edge-of-eviction.html?ribbon-ad-idx=6&amp;rref=business&amp;module=ArrowsNav&amp;contentCollection=Business%20Day&amp;action=keypress&amp;region=FixedLeft&amp;pgtype=Blogs&amp;_r=0">removed from the restaurant</a>, which some see as a ploy for Rosen to move in a piece from his own collection to bolster his place in the space. #richpeople</p>
