<p>America&apos;s favorite &quot;pasteurized prepared cheese product&quot; now contains one fewer gnarly chemical. Kraft announced it has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140309175634/http://www.startribune.com/lifestyle/taste/244739921.html">removed artificial preservatives</a> from most of its plastic wrapped cheese slices, replacing sorbic acid with natamycin, a naturally occurring antifungal agent produced during fermentation. Because that sounds so much more appetizing.</p>

<p>The company made the switch in Kraft Singles flavors in American and White American varieties, which will now be emblazoned with a red circle proclaiming their artifice-free ingredients&#x2014;at least where flavor and preservation are concerned. &quot;Consumers are looking for those less artificial cues and messages,&quot; explains Kraft manager of cheese research and development Gavin Schmidt. &quot;Those messages are more meaningful to consumers than they have been in the past.&quot; Health-conscious Kraft eaters (ha) who opt for 2% and fat-free Kraft singles will have to wait; the change only affects the brand&apos;s full-fat singles line.</p>

<p>This is the next big change for the company after it agreed to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140309175634/http://chicagoist.com/2013/11/01/kraft_to_remove_dyes_from_some_mac.php">remove artificial dyes</a> from some of its kids macaroni and cheese products. For what its worth, Kraft singles already employ paprika as a method to gain that &quot;natural-looking&quot; bright orange due. And while it may make for a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140309175634/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/17/heres_what_a_60_grilled_cheese_took.php">superior grilled cheese</a>, please don&apos;t forget what <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140309175634/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/14/american_cheeses.php"><em>real</em> American cheese</a> looks like.</p>
