</div></div><p>Today <em>The Post</em> published a short article on Financial District <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629173130/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/food_cart_bouquet_biz_an_doozy_UtXUKyZn1I5OAUwEt4bnHI?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">hotdog vendor-turned-bridal florist</a> Kohnoor Begum. &quot;Business is very slow,&quot; Begum explained of her decision to expand her cart offerings outside <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629173130/http://gothamist.com/2009/01/08/manhattan_marriage_bureau_gets_make.php">the city Marriage Bureau</a>. &quot;We need to make more money.&quot; Intrigued by Begum&apos;s unique business plan, we took a trip down to visit her. We were not welcomed.</p>

<p>Either Begum has let fame go to her head or for some reason (permits, perhaps?) she just doesn&apos;t want any more press attention. Shouting, &quot;No questions! No pictures!&quot; and brandishing her tongs, Begum made it clear that <em>her </em>business was her own. Begum has occupied the busting corner of Worth and Centre Streets for the past five years and only recently began selling fake flowers to deal-seeking couples about to get married in the Office of the City Clerk, located steps from the cart. Begum and her team, which includes her daughter and a third man, approach passersby with bridal bouquets, boutonnieres and offers to take wedding photos on the steps of the Clerk&apos;s office or in the nearby &quot;Wedding Garden.&quot; </p>

<p>By midafternoon, there were no less than six couples (all hetero, for now) coming in and out of the Clerk&apos;s office. and although some stopped briefly to hear the pitch, none took advantage of the on-site flowers. We did, however, see several hot dog and bottled water purchases. Which makes sense, because these days no wedding reception is complete <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629173130/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702303714704576383682135167132.html">without food trucks</a>! <br>
