title: Mayor De Blasio Open To Closing 14th Street During L Train Shutdown

										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="060716ltrain.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170817132144im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_ewhitford/060716ltrain.jpg" width="640" height="427"> <br> <i> Welcome to hell (Billy Devine). </i></div> <p></p>

<p>There have been numerous suggestions for how to compensate when the L train takes an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170817132144/http://gothamist.com/2016/05/06/mta_l_train_shutdown.php">extended spa vacation</a> for 18 months beginning in 2019. One of the louder&#x2014;and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170817132144/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/15/boom_problem_solved.php#photo-1">more rational</a>, let&apos;s be real&#x2014;has called for closing 14th Street in Manhattan to vehicular traffic, limiting the thoroughfare to pedestrians, cyclists and MTA buses. And it looks like Mayor de Blasio is open to jumping on the car-free party. </p>

<p>Yesterday, on WNYC&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170817132144/http://www.wnyc.org/shows/bl">Brian Lehrer Show</a>, de Blasio dipped his toes into the 14th Street proposal. &quot;We&apos;ve only just begun to think about what we might do,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170817132144/http://nypost.com/2016/07/29/de-blasio-floats-closing-14th-street-during-l-train-shutdown/">he said</a>. &quot;It&apos;s not one that on first blush sounds to me easy, given how important 14th Street is, but we&apos;ll look at everything and anything we can do.&quot;</p>

<p>A version of this idea first surfaced when the Regional Plan Association released a white paper in April 2016 titled &quot;A New L Train For New Yorkers,&quot; [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170817132144/http://library.rpa.org/pdf/RPA-A-New-L-Train-for-New-Yorkers.pdf">PDF</a>] in which it endorsed the 18-month option and recommended reserving a portion of the 14th Street corridor for pedestrians, cyclists, and buses during the shutdown. The idea has since been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170817132144/http://gothamist.com/2016/05/13/could_the_l_train_shutdown_turn_14t.php">taken up by State Senator Brad Hoylman</a> and other politicians and advocates, who have proposed a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170817132144/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/07/car_free_14th_street.php">complete ban on cars</a> on the busy corridor for the duration of L Train repair work&#x2014;however long that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170817132144/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/13/l_train_tunnel_closure_years.php">actually ends up being</a>.</p>

<p>The Mayor <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170817132144/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/mayor-de-blasio-questions-mta-18-month-train-shutdown-article-1.2731141">also took a moment to throw some shade</a> at the state-run MTA (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170817132144/http://gothamist.com/2015/06/30/mayor_de_blasio_is_sick_tired_of_go.php">surprise, surprise</a>), implying the agency jumped the gun without having all contingencies worked out:</p>

<blockquote>This decision&#x2014;although I&#x2019;m sure it has a practical, underlying rationale&#x2014;announcing it without a plan to deal with the impact is troubling to me. It&#x2019;s a long time. And we&apos;re certainly going to push hard to see: does it really have to be so long? Is there any other way to go about this?</blockquote>

<p>MTA spokesperson Beth DeFalco took to Twitter to call out the Mayor on his statements, pointing out that the city has been aware of all plans from the beginning and seemed to go along with what was being proposed by the MTA.</p>

<p>Also, it&apos;s not like de Blasio <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170817132144/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/13/l_train_tunnel_closure_years.php">hasn&apos;t known about this for six months</a>.</p>

<p>With a few years still to go before <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170817132144/http://gothamist.com/2016/05/27/canarsie_l_train_mta.php">L-Mageddon 2019</a>&#x2014;and acrimony between city and state governments <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170817132144/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/22/de_blasio_budget_2017.php">continuing to build</a>&#x2014;we&apos;re in for a lively lead up&#x2014;unless of course the mayor or governor don&apos;t get reelected. We&apos;re also due for a few more well-intentioned proposals on how to get New Yorkers around sans-L. Has anyone dreamt up the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170817132144/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/24/if_you_will_it_it_is_no_dream.php">14th Street Skyway yet</a>?</p>
