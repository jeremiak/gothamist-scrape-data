<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170118175131/http://www.creamlinenyc.com/#about">Creamline</a>, the Chelsea Market stand serving &quot;American Classics&quot; that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170118175131/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/13/creamline_chelsea_market.php#photo-1">opened last year</a>, debuts its first brick-and-mortar location this week. Also in Chelsea on 7th Avenue, the new Creamline&apos;s offering the same menu of humble sandwiches like cheeseburgers and fried chicken biscuits and sides of fries and coleslaw. There&apos;s one special bonus this week though: free food.</p>

<p>On opening day, January 18th and also on the 19th, hot chocolate and the restaurant&apos;s decadent deep fried Oreos will be free. The &quot;sugar-bomb[s],&quot; as Scott Lynch <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170118175131/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/13/creamline_chelsea_market.php#photo-7">describes the Oreos</a>, come with whipped cream, and the hot chocolate is made with fudge. </p>

<p>Everything on the menu&apos;s pretty cheap, but they&apos;re also doing a new deal for the new location. The Chelsea Combo includes a burger, fries and a Maine Root fair-trade soda for $15.</p>
