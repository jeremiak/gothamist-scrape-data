<p>Pop up foodie events continue their <em>pop</em>ular reign in foodiot culture and along comes another: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428170456/http://bowerystation.openhouse.me/work-view/night-market-june-27th-28th/">Night Market</a>. On Thursday, June 27th and Friday, June 28th, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428170456/http://bowerystation.openhouse.me/">Old Bowery Station</a> will be transformed into an indoor street market, with seven local food vendors offering bites of their wares. The space, which formerly housed a subway entrance, still bears the markings of its former life in the form of tiled walls, giving guests a peek into the past in addition to the tasty treats.</p>
