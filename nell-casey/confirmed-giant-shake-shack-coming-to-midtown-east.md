<p>It&apos;s hard to believe the latest Shake Shack opening brings the total to just 10 in NYC, when it feels like a new one opens <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504172410/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/14/shake_shack_coming_to_dumbo_next_ye.php">every other day</a>. Danny Meyer will <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504172410/http://nypost.com/2014/02/10/shake-shack-to-open-east-midtown-location-this-fall/">bestow 600 Third Avenue at 40th Street</a> with his beloved burger chain at some point this fall, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504172410/http://nypost.com/2014/02/10/shake-shack-to-open-east-midtown-location-this-fall/">according to the Post</a>.</p>

<p>But this ain&apos;t gonna be no mere shack. The restaurant will take over two floors and span 4,774 square feet, making it one of the largest in the city. Another Shake Shack opened <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504172410/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/06/hello_world_here_is_your_grand_cent.php">just a few blocks away</a> in Grand Central Terminal last fall. </p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> A rep for Shake Shack confirms the chain will indeed debut at that location sometime this fall but didn&apos;t have any further details at this time.</p>
