                            <p>Nestled beneath the LIRR station on 71st Avenue sits the appropriately-named <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140109044347/http://foresthillsstationhouse.com/">Forest Hills Station House</a>, a new bar and restaurant in the Queens nabe of the same name. It&apos;s a casual, neighborhood kind of place, decked out with a wood, steel and brick decor that echoes the train station above. Distressed barn wood and handcrafted furniture create a homey backdrop for the 11 flat screen televisions, which are tuned to various sporting events from NYC and beyond.</p>

<p>The elevated pub grub menu has some inventive takes on classic bar food. Empanadas ($9) come stuffed with braised short rib, in-house kimchi and sriracha mayo for dipping. Instead of a dip in Frank&apos;s Red Hot, whole jumbo wings ($9) are coated in a fiery in-house pickled pepper sauce, though you can get them in traditional hot sauce or bbq flavorings as well. The kitchen also turns out Fried Chicken Livers ($9), Beer Battered Meatballs ($8) and a variety of burgers, like the Decadent Burger ($14) made with braised short rib and topped with boursin cheese, fried onions, shiitake mushrooms and a demi-glace. Don&apos;t forget to order the bacon and bourbon-glazed deep fried Snickers ($6) for dessert.</p>

<p>At present, the solid beer menu includes 16 brews on tap, 17 in bottles, 7 in cans and 1 cask ale. Offerings from Six Point, Flying Dog and Evil Twin share the menu with a selection of German brews and other more far flung breweries. Mercifully, there&apos;s not a Bud Lite in sight. A respectable amount of bourbons, ryes and other brown liquors can be imbibed neat or found in one of the bar&apos;s signature cocktails like an Old Fashioned ($12) made with Woodford Reserve or The Boulevard ($12) made with Templeton Rye, Campari and Camparo Antica.</p>

<p><em>106-11 71st Avenue, Forest Hills, Queens; 718-544-5000. Open Saturday through Tuesday from noon until 2 a.m., Wednesday through Friday noon until 4 a.m.</em></p>
