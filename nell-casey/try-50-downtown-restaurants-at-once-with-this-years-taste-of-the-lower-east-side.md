</div></div>					<p>For nearly 100 years the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151031143938/http://www.grandsettlement.org/">Grand Street Settlement</a> has been helping low-income families and individuals on the Lower East Side by providing community services and outreach for people of all ages. Each year the organization puts on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151031143938/http://tasteofles.org/">Taste of the Lower East Side</a>, a food and drinks festival to benefit the settlement, and this year&apos;s iteration is coming up in just a few weeks on Thursday, April 25th. As with past years, the all-you-can-eat tasting extravaganza will be held at the lovely <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151031143938/http://www.82mercer.com/">82Mercer</a><a> events space and will have samples and bites from nearly 50 LES restaurants, cafes and bars.</a></p><a>

Speaking of the drinks, a three hour open bar comes with your ticket, with specialty cocktails plus wine and beer for your boozing pleasure.

Regardless, your dollars are benefiting an incredibly deserving organization, and considering the incredible pedigree of the participating restaurants, it&apos;s worth it if you can swing it.</p>
