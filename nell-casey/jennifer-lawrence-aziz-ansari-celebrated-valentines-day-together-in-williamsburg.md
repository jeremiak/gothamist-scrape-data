<p>Instead of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801200353/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/14/how_are_you_celebrating_the_coldest.php">hiding from the weather</a> and entering a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801200353/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/14/5_ways_to_survive_this_cold_valenti.php">platonic blood pact</a>, celebrity <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801200353/http://www.buzzfeed.com/mlg263/18-times-jennifer-lawrences-obsessions-with-food-nvr5#.raOkgJOrn">eating</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801200353/http://www.eater.com/2014/4/15/6240893/watch-aziz-ansaris-restaurant-focused-show-food-club">enthusiasts</a> Aziz Ansari and Jennifer Lawrence upped the idiosyncratic quotient of Williamsburg&apos;s delicious dive bar The Commodore. According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801200353/http://www.people.com/article/jennifer-lawrence-aziz-ansari-valentines-day">People Magazine&apos;s tipsters</a>, the pair sampled the bar&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801200353/http://gothamist.com/2015/03/26/best_fried_chicken_nyc.php">excellent fried chicken</a>, nachos, mac &amp; cheese and sandwiches while &quot;showing each other stuff on their iPhones and chatting and laughing.&quot;  </p>

<p>Ansari has his Williamsburg cred, using many of the neighborhood&apos;s dining venues as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801200353/https://www.thrillist.com/entertainment/new-york/aziz-ansari-master-of-none-bars-restaurants">backdrops</a> on his excellent Netflix series <em>Master of None</em>. In fact, The Commodore was rearranged to serve as a lunch gathering between Ansari&apos;s character Dev and his friends, where the group ordered the bar&apos;s top-notch burgers. Maybe next season it&apos;ll be all about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801200353/http://gothamist.com/2015/07/10/el_cortez_bushwick.php">the taco salad</a>. </p>

<p>Though they&apos;d be the kind of couple all of us would <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160801200353/http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=ship">ship</a>, the People story pegs Ansari and Lawrence as &quot;really good friends&quot; who shared a bottle of wine over a &quot;pile of ketchup&quot; and lots of laughs. Our invitation probably just got stuck in the drafts folder.</p>
