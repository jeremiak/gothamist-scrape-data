                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="011414hudsonyards.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20140217065035im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_nellcasey/011414hudsonyards.jpg" width="640" height="425"> <br> <i> <span class="photo_caption"> (rendering via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140217065035/http://www.hudsonyardsnewyork.com/shopping-dining/dining/kitchens">Hudson Yards</a>)</span></i></div> <p></p>

<p>We&apos;ve got some time before the mini-city known as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140217065035/http://gothamist.com/tags/hudsonyards">Hudson Yards</a> opens for business, but brokers are starting to book talent to occupy the 750,000 square feet of retail space inside the mammoth complex. The Real Deal <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140217065035/http://therealdeal.com/issues_articles/hudson-yards-retail-gets-underway/">has a big breakdown</a> of possible tenants, including some preliminary details about what kind of foodstuffs will be offered when this bad boy gets completed. </p>

<p>First and foremost, an Eataly-style food court called &quot;The Kitchens&quot; will occupy the 4th floor of the retail space, though unlike the Batali enterprise the culinary options will encompass multiple ethnic cuisines from tacos to ramen to burgers and dogs. (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140217065035/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/09/bourdain_market.php">Is that you, Bourdain</a>?) The above rendering illustrates the forthcoming market, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140217065035/http://www.grubstreet.com/2014/01/hudson-yards-restaurant.html">Grub Street noticed</a> a suspiciously Shake Shack-style sign lurking in the background. There&apos;s also a Magnolia Bakery storefront not-so-subtly drawn in as well. Probably doesn&apos;t mean anything.</p>

<p>The complex will also boast nine different bars and restaurants, including grab-and-go, casual and formal eateries located on the top floor overlooking the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140217065035/http://www.hudsonyardsnewyork.com/arts-parks/public-square">Public Square</a>. No leases have been signed yet, but a spokesperson for the developer says they&apos;re seeking something in the family of &quot;Bouchon or Per Se;&quot; another indicated they&apos;d spoken to &quot;all of [the high-profile New York chefs].&quot; Natch.</p>

<p>Between this and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140217065035/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/21/gotham_west_market_brings_great_eat.php#photo-1">Gotham West Market</a>, Manhattan&apos;s far west side is becoming a kind of foodie destination. And when the 7 train extension <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140217065035/http://gothamist.com/2013/12/21/bloomberg_takes_the_new_7_subway_li.php#photo-1">finally opens</a> it won&apos;t be such a pain in the neck to get out there.</p>
