According to the ethics watchdog group <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130606154535/http://www.nlpc.org/category/keywords/new-yorkers-organized-assist-hurricane-families-noah-f">National Legal and Policy Center</a>, tax records show that only $1,392 of at least $31,000 raised to help Katrina families was paid to victims.<p></p>

<p>Rep. Gregory Meeks and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130606154535/http://gothamist.com/mt/mt-search.fcgi?IncludeBlogs=1&amp;limit=30&amp;search=malcolm+smith&amp;x=0&amp;y=0">state Sen. Malcolm Smith</a> set up <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130606154535/http://ndldc.org/index.html">The New Direction Local Development Corporation</a> charity in 2001 with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130606154535/http://gothamist.com/2009/12/29/ponzi_schemer_gives_rep_meeks_trips.php">Ponzi billionaire</a> Allen Stanford, and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130606154535/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/slush_hush_funds_in_do_zilch_charity_PjRXOIguTyqLLnYGytXKVI">Post</a> alleges it has operated as a kind of slush fund. After Katrina, a special fund was created, New Yorkers Organized to Assist Hurricane Families <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130606154535/http://ndldc.org/noahf/noahf.html">(NOAH-F)</a>, under the auspices of the New Direction; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130606154535/http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/2441517/posts">at the time</a>, Meeks said that &quot;there would be no administrative costs attached to the effort.&quot; </p>

<p>In a special report in today&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130606154535/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/national/soaked_by_pols_CcsQDkxyhdcOomYdJ68giM">Post,</a> everyone involved with the charity is passing the buck and pleading ignorance on this one; Smith has disavowed any involvement with the group beyond establishing it, and Meeks told the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130606154535/http://www.zwire.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=20407914&amp;BRD=2731&amp;PAG=461&amp;dept_id=574905&amp;rfi=1">Queens Chronicle</a>, &#x201C;It is not my charity. I didn&#x2019;t hire anyone and I didn&#x2019;t get involved with the day to day operations of the group.&#x201D; In a statement, he added that &quot;a committee of community representatives functioned as advisers to the fund.&quot; But several of those &quot;community representatives&quot; interviewed by the paper all claim they don&apos;t know who exactly was distributing the money, one advisory member even saying, <strong><strong>&quot;I never attended any board meetings.&quot;</strong></strong></p>

<p>The plot thickens, according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130606154535/http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/2441517/posts">Free Republic</a>&#x2014; from 2002 to 2008, the group&#x2019;s address was the office of a lawyer named Joan Flowers, who served as campaign treasurer for both Meeks and Smith. Flowers is a well-connected political operative, who is the current campaign treasurer of... <em>wait for it!</em>... Governor Paterson.</p>
