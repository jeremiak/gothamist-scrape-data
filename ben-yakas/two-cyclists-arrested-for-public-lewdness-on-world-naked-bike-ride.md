<p>Despite a deluge descending upon the city Friday evening, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429120724/http://gothamist.com/tags/worldnakedbikeride">the World Naked Bike Ride</a> happily wound its way across Brooklyn and Lower Manhattan. But it was not without incident: police say two cyclists were arrested for going fully nude and causing a ruckus of rosy cheeks in the streets.</p>

<p>Cops say they arrested Virginia resident Karl Geiger, 49, and Brooklyn resident Paul Nocera, 52, around 8:30 p.m. Friday after the two men dismounted from their bikes at Bleeker &amp; Avenue of the Americas and Bleeker &amp; 7th Avenue, and &quot;caused traffic and distraction&quot; by &quot;dancing and cheering in a lewd manner&quot; at both locations. The two men have each been charged with public lewdness, two counts of disorderly conduct, and exposure of a person. </p>

<p>Activist Benjamin Shepard, who witnessed the arrests, had a different take on what happened: &quot;On the way back to Brooklyn, down Bleecker, people were cheering for us. But we also heard sirens,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429120724/http://benjaminheimshepard.blogspot.com/2014/06/a-hard-rains-gonna-fall-vision-zero.html?m=1">he wrote</a>. &quot;You can&#x2019;t ride around with your dick hanging out, one of the cops explained.&quot; He thinks the cyclists may have inadvertently gotten the cops&apos; attention when they rode past their precinct. </p>

<p>In NYC, it is perfectly legal for men or women <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429120724/http://gothamist.com/tags/topless">to go topless in public</a>, but it&apos;s not legal to go bottomless; you can read the NY penal code on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429120724/http://naturistaction.org/StatesFrames/State_Laws_Frames/New_York_Laws/body_new_york_laws.html">public lewdness and exposure here.</a> </p>

<p>&quot;Were any of the riders  exposing themselves in a Lewd way? Certainly, not from my point of view,&quot; Shepard wrote. &quot;Instead of answering [our questions], they escorted us out. Our friends would not be out till the next day they explained, yet another skirmish in a lifetime of battles between the Dionysian cult and those hell bent on crushing the party and its libratory [sic] ideas, the forces of repression rearing their head against efforts to realize New York, the naked city, in all its glories.&quot;</p>
