<p>Donald Trump&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022053842/http://dcist.com/2017/01/donald_trump_inauguration_live.php#photo-1">sparsely-attended inauguration</a> was already a literal nightmare for our nation, the heralding of an age of &quot;American carnage&quot; powered by cynicism, greed, fear and bigotry. Now, in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022053842/https://www.wired.com/2016/09/vic-berger-election-viral-videos/">Vic Berger&apos;s</a> latest video masterpiece (&quot;American Horror Story: Trump&apos;s Inauguration&quot;), the vulgar and dreadful essence of the day is brought to the fore, evoking the bad acid trip atmosphere of the Red Room in <em>Twin Peaks</em>. </p>

<p>Footage of Trump walking in slow motion and bathed in a blood-red light is juxtaposed with ominous strings and audio of him repeating, &quot;grab &apos;em by the pussy.&quot; Closeups of Trump&apos;s doughy face compete with a biblical storm that degrades the footage as Trump rants about how &quot;the world is an angry place.&quot; Psychedelic visions of the mostly-empty crowd suddenly gives way to the carnival-esque festivities of the low grade entertainment of the Inauguration Ball. Imagine if Trump was President?!</p>
