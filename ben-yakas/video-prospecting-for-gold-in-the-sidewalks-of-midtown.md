<p>Like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160820071848/http://www.ebaumsworld.com/video/watch/18396/">Gus Chiggins</a>, Queens resident Raffi Stepanian is a modern day prospector with humble dreams: to avoid coyotes, and find his fortune in the sidewalks of midtown Manhattan. Stepanian made waves last summer when he was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160820071848/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/prospector_scours_sidewalks_for_ReKRNWajHnjJhKSoW5Il6L#.Tf86Za1mVn0;reddit">interviewed by the Post</a> about panning for bits of gold, platinum and rare gems in the Diamond District.
