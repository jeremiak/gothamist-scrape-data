<p>You&apos;re not really a Brooklyn food co-op until you&apos;ve made your first political statement&#x2014;and it seems the Greene Hill Food Co-Op is ready to step out of the shadow of their big brother, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130527060017/http://gothamist.com/tags/parkslopefoodcoop">Park Slope Food Co-Op.</a> Members of the Greene Hill Food Co-Op <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130527060017/https://www.facebook.com/greenehillfoodcoop/posts/10151528150807999">have been debating whether to ban</a> Eden Foods&#x2019; soy milk because its CEO is suing the Obama administration over a mandate forcing companies to cover their employees&apos; birth control. Yeah, but what does member <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130527060017/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/10/adrian_grenier_puts_down_roots_at_g.php">Vince Chase think</a>?</p>

<p>Some background: Michael Potter, founder and CEO or organic food company Eden Foods, recently sued the Obama administration over its requirement that his company&#x2019;s employee health plan cover birth control. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130527060017/http://www.salon.com/2013/04/15/eden_foods_ceo_digs_himself_deeper_in_birth_control_outrage/">Salon confronted Potter</a> about it: &quot;I don&#x2019;t care if the federal government is telling me to buy my employees Jack Daniel&#x2019;s or birth control. What gives them the right to tell me that I have to do that? ...I&#x2019;m not trying to get birth control out of Rite Aid or Wal-Mart, but don&#x2019;t tell me I gotta pay for it.&#x201D;</p>

<p>At the same time, there seems to be something else going on here, as the lawsuit states regarding contraception, &#x201C;these procedures almost always involve immoral and unnatural practices.&#x201D; As member Mary V-X commented:</p>

<blockquote>Do we as a coop want to buy from vendors from whom we have reasonable evidence that they treat their workers fairly? The willful exclusion of insurance coverage for an entire class of items that is BASIC HEALTH CARE for many women constitutes inequitable treatment of workers at Eden. If the Coop&apos;s mandate is limited to the provision of local/sustainable/organic food, then a continued relationship with Eden would be decided on the basis of sales alone. If, on the other hand, worker justice is a component of our consideration for whether or not to support a particular vendor, this would seem to exclude a future relationship with Eden.</blockquote>

<p>Other members suggested they leave the product on the shelves and let people decide with their money. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130527060017/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/food_co_op_obamacare_fight_mvcX8iy1Tv62zwrzvxc8CO?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Brooklyn">NY Post picked up on</a> the public discussion that suggested the group was on the verge of a major boycott, but some members suggested that was premature (and too tabloid-baity). Says co-op member Jake Stevens: &quot;The downside of social media is that we can&apos;t have a very tentative discussion without it becoming the grist for tabloid sales. Grr.&quot;</p>
