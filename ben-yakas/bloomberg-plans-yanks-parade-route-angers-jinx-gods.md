<p>Did Mayor Bloomberg jinx the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412160650/http://gothamist.com/tags/yankees">Yankees</a> this morning? On his weekly radio program, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412160650/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/city_already_planning_yankees_victory_Bv88mdOuAuNnTr9Dhh0OSN">he told listeners</a> that the city has already begun planning out the Yankees <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412160650/http://gothamist.com/2009/11/06/yankees_fans_revel_in_ticker_tape_p.php">parade route</a>, even though they haven&apos;t won the first round yet. &quot;I&apos;m sort of trying to figure out where the parade should start,&quot; the mayor said (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412160650/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2010/10/08/young-yankee-fans-get-head-start-on-world-series/">CBS thought</a> he was joking). One caller responded, &quot;Don&apos;t get ahead of yourself.&quot; </p>

<p>Bloomberg said they needed to plan ahead&#x2014;even so, he didn&apos;t have to tell anyone about it! <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412160650/http://espn.go.com/blog/new-york/yankees/post/_/id/10885/mayor-bloomberg-already-planning-parade">ESPN thinks</a> Joe Girardi must be shaking in his boots: &quot;Girardi likely wouldn&apos;t talk about planning a parade even after the last out of Championship No. 28, but with the Yankees up 2-0 in the ALDS, the Mayor is feeling awfully confident.&quot;</p>
