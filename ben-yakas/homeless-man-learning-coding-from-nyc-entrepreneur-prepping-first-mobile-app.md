<p>This summer, NYC programmer and self-proclaimed entrepreneur Patrick McConlogue <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150704030157/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/22/nyc_entrepreneur_promises_to_teach.php">caused a bit of a stir online</a> when he wrote about his plans to offer a random homeless person $100 or the opportunity to learn how to code. Despite some naysayers, McConlogue followed through with the experiment, and has been teaching homeless <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150704030157/http://journeymancourse.com/">&quot;Journeyman&quot;</a> Leo all about coding for the last 45 days. It seems they&apos;ve made some real inroads, since Leo is now prepping to released his first mobile app&#x2014;and McConlogue is meeting with a &quot;MAJOR book publisher&quot; about writing up the story.</p>

<p>&quot;He told me I could have a laptop and learn how to do something and I figured it could turn into something more,&quot; Leo wrote <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150704030157/https://www.facebook.com/journeymanchallenge">on the Facebook page</a>. &quot;It&#x2019;s not like I don&#x2019;t have the time to learn to do it.&quot; Leo, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150704030157/http://www.businessinsider.com/homeless-coder-being-homeless-nyc-2013-10">who lost his job</a> at MetLife in 2011, hasn&apos;t said much about the app, but it&apos;s called &quot;Go Green&quot; and is related to his interest in environmental issues. But Leo&apos;s skills have improved enough that he&apos;s attending a &quot;hackathon&quot; today in Manhattan. </p>

<p>McConlogue, 23, has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150704030157/https://plus.google.com/communities/113669203485569960566">also expressed interest</a> in continuing his experiment with Leo with other people around the world&#x2014;he&apos;s offering other people one-on-one lessons in coding <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150704030157/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF8xPGGjfU0">via Google Helpouts.</a></p>
