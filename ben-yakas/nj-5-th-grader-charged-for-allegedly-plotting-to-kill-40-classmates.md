<p>A New Jersey fifth grader has been hit with juvenile charges for allegedly plotting to kill 40 of his classmates. Authorities say that the unidentified fifth-grader from Wall Township had a list of 40 fellow students, and he was planning a &quot;violent&quot; attack at Wall Intermediate School using &quot;sophisticated weapons.&quot; <em>Having said that</em>: &quot;There was never any real threat to those students,&quot; Wall Township Police Lt. John Brockriede <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130911033931/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/new-jersey-fifth-grader-planned-massive-attack-middle-school-cops-article-1.1448178#ixzz2eDKoIoZ4">told the News</a>. &quot;He wasn&#x2019;t capable of carrying out anything that he put down.&quot;</p>

<p>The fifth-grader was suspended from Central Elementary School after school officials <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130911033931/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Fifth-Grade-Boy-Plot-Kill-Classmates-Columbine-Newtown-Charges-Pending-222735921.html">found a note</a> containing threats in April. They added that he was planning something &quot;similar to a Columbine or Newtown&quot; at the intermediate school. Police then found the list of other students&apos; first names on the boy&apos;s computer this summer. </p>
