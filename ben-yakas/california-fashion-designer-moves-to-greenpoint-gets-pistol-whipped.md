<p>A California fashion designer who recently moved to Brooklyn was pistol-whipped by a thief who was pretending to be a panhandler this week. Police say that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150413013610/http://scottianmcfarland.com/">Scott McFarland</a>, 32, was walking on Norman Avenue in Greenpoint around 3 p.m. Sunday when he was approached by Meredith Lambson, 34, who asked for directions and change for a dollar. &#x201C;He looked like a normal guy,&#x201D; McFarland <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150413013610/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/bogus-brooklyn-panhandler-pistol-whips-tourist-article-1.1427279">told the News</a> from his hospital bed at Bellevue Hospital. &#x201C;He wanted my money and he started pistol-whipping me. He said he wanted the money over and over.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Lambson allegedly pulled out a 9-mm. handgun and hit McFarland in the face, forcing him to give over his cell phone and cash. McFarland then chased him down Guernsey Street, where he was pistol-whipped, punched and kicked again. McFarland, who recently moved to the city from San Francisco to intern at a fashion company, suffered a broken eye socket, nose and jaw, as well as a gash on the back of his head, missing teeth and massive swelling.</p>

<p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m busted up pretty bad,&#x201D; he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150413013610/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/bogus-brooklyn-panhandler-pistol-whips-tourist-article-1.1427279">told the News</a>. &quot;My face is a mess.&#x201D; Lambson was caught later that day on Sunday; he has been charged with assault, robbery, possession of a firearm, grand larceny, criminal possession of a weapon, menacing and harassment. </p>
