<p>Last week, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140330041702/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/11/philly_terrorized_by_swiss_cheese_m.php">we learned that citizens of honorary sixth borough Philadelphia</a> have been living in terror of a local man who had been approaching women and asking them to put a slice of swiss cheese on his penis and perform sexual acts on him. Well the crisis might be over: today, PhillyMag reports that suspected cheese-fucking enthusiast Chris Pagano <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140330041702/http://www.phillymag.com/news/2014/01/16/swiss-cheese-pervert-chris-pagano-arrested/">has been arrested</a>. </p>

<p>Pagano faces charges of indecent exposure, stalking, and harassment. He was arrested at least two prior times: in 2006 for soliciting a prostitute, and in 2009 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140330041702/http://www.phillymag.com/news/2014/01/13/mugshots-swiss-cheese-pervert-chris-pagano/">after he allegedly</a> &#x201C;removed a large block of cheese from his pocket&#x201D; and offered a woman on the street &#x201C;$20 to rub the Swiss cheese on his penis.&#x201D; </p>

<p>Gabby Chest previously claimed she had an encounter with the Swiss Cheese Pervert in 2012, when a &quot;really strange guy&quot; messaged her on OKCupid with a very specific request: &quot;He said he was looking for someone to perform masturbation on him with cheese,&quot; Chest said. &quot;He kept saying how strong his urges were and how desperate he was to find someone to help him with them.&quot; You can read <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140330041702/http://www.phillymag.com/news/2014/01/11/norristowns-swiss-cheese-pervert/">the full message she received here.</a></p>

<p>There were multiple other women who came forward this week to say they too had encountered Pagano at some point. Maybe Pagano just wanted to be loved by someone as soft as brie; either way, he&apos;s off the streets, which means it&apos;s safe for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140330041702/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/11/subway_cheese.php">non-pervy cheese connoisseurs to come out of the shadows.</a></p>
