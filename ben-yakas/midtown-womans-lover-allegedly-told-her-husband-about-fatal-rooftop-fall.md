<p>Early Sunday morning <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161113152317/http://gothamist.com/2016/09/25/cops_intoxicated_woman_dies_after_f.php">a woman died</a> after she accidentally fell off the roof of the Midtown apartment building where she lived. Police say that Elena Gladkikh, 27, was on the roof of 449 W 37th Street near 10th Avenue around 8:45 a.m. Sunday when she lost her balance, fell off a ledge and landed between two buildings. Cops believe she was intoxicated at the time.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161113152317/http://nypost.com/2016/09/25/woman-critical-after-falling-between-two-buildings/">The Post now reports</a> that Gladkikh, who was a consultant for Mary Kay cosmetics, was allegedly with her boyfriend at the time. The two apparently got locked out on the roof, so she called her husband, who was in their apartment down below, to help them get back in. She fell before he arrived, and the boyfriend had to tell the husband what had happened.</p>

<p>The Post adds: &quot;Gladkikh&#x2019;s date told cops he met her at a restaurant where she bartended part-time. He said she was already drunk when they went to watch the sun rise on the rooftop with a six-pack of beer.&quot;</p>

<p>James Proctor, a porter at a nearby building, witnessed the aftermath: &quot;When they brought her out she didn&apos;t look alive,&quot; he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161113152317/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/manhattan/intoxicated-woman-injured-fall-midtown-building-roof-article-1.2805697">told the Daily News</a>, adding she wasn&apos;t wearing any clothing besides her underwear. &quot;The bruises she had, you could tell it was from a fall...She looked really bad.&quot; She was taken to Bellevue Hospital where she died.</p>

<p>Gladkikh&apos;s family have started <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161113152317/https://www.gofundme.com/2r4vprwk">a GoFundMe page</a> to raise money &quot;so that we can send her body home to be reunited with her family in Russia.&quot;</p>
