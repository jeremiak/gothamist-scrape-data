The six mile walk through the UWS raised more than $6 million altogether for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160303023324/http://www.aidswalk.net/newyork/about/beneficiary.html">various organizations</a> that provide services for people with HIV and AIDS. We just hope everyone made sure to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160303023324/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSnB9XCMRaI">wear the ribbon</a>.<p></p>

<p>Even God gave his hearty approval for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160303023324/http://www.aidswalk.net/newyork/">the march</a>, which was organized by the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160303023324/http://www.gmhc.org/">GMHC</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160303023324/http://twitter.com/#!/TheTweetOfGod/status/69732800974159874">on Twitter</a>: &quot;If thou art doing today&apos;s AIDS Walk, know thousands of angels are walking with thee. They are invisible, but trust Me - they look FABULOUS.&quot; To mark the event, which is called the largest AIDS fundraising event in the world, Rep. Anthony Weiner and Assemblyman Richard Gottfried <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160303023324/http://online.wsj.com/article/APc3112aab8f1042ee901c4ab481672994.html">called on</a> the FDA to approve the sale of over-the-counter rapid HIV test kits. &quot;There is good reason to believe that some individuals who would otherwise test themselves for HIV avoid clinics and outreach centers because of the perceived stigma involved,&quot; Anthony wrote in a letter to the FDA.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, farther uptown, Sen. Ruben Diaz Sr. held his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160303023324/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/21/diaz_restarting_his_anti-marriage_e.php">anti-gay marriage rally</a> in the Bronx, which was organized by the National Organization for Marriage. According <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160303023324/http://joemygod.blogspot.com/2011/05/new-york-rain-dampens-attendance-but.html">to Joe.My.God</a>, over a thousand people showed up for the rally, far less than the AIDS walk, and coming short of paralyzing the Bronx like Diaz <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160303023324/http://www.metro.us/newyork/Local/article/860676--rally-to-protect-marriage-today">had promised</a>. Joe.My.God added that the event was &quot;<strong>much more of an ecumenical hate scene, with the red-caped Catholic loons leading the parade, followed closely by a contingent of Ultra-Orthodox Jews.</strong>&quot; </p>

<p>One same-sex marriage proponent <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160303023324/http://manhattan.ny1.com/content/top_stories/139120/bronx-senator-leads-rally-against-gay-marriage">told NY1</a>, &quot;The Bronx has the highest rate of HIV in all of the boroughs in Manhattan and also was the location of the biggest gay bashing a few months ago and so Ruben Diaz is deciding to hold a hate rally in the Bronx instead of rallying for his own constituents.&quot; You can see some videos at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160303023324/http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/2011/05/videos_from_rub.php">the Voice</a>. In an interesting twist, Diaz&apos;s 22-year-old granddaughter Erica Diaz briefly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160303023324/http://joemygod.blogspot.com/2011/05/ny-sen-ruben-diaz-gay-grandaughter.html">spoke in favor</a> of marriage equality on the Bronx Supreme Court Steps, just before her grandfather&apos;s rally.</p>
