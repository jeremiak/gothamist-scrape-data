<p>Independence Day was a rollercoaster of emotions for the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160706111833/http://gothamist.com/tags/knicks">Knicks</a>: for the better part of the day, rumors ran rampant that the team was on the verge of a sign-and-trade for star guard Steve Nash. But by the time the fireworks were going off, Nash had agreed to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160706111833/http://espn.go.com/los-angeles/nba/story/_/id/8130840/steve-nash-headed-los-angeles-lakers-sign-trade-deal">share his prodigious passing abilities</a> with Kobe Bryant and the Lakers, leaving the Knicks in a very lurchy lurch, as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160706111833/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/05/sports/basketball/nash-heads-to-lakers-leaving-knicks-in-lurch.html">the Times put it.</a> </p>

<p>To make matter worse, the Houston Rockets have offered <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160706111833/http://gothamist.com/tags/jeremylin">Jeremy Lin</a> a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160706111833/http://www.nypost.com/p/sports/knicks/rocket_man_5uRfOZyrqV2UL8HcwZXsnK">$31 million, four-year deal.</a> All the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160706111833/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/06/knicksheat_game_4_in_real_time_mise.php">heroic Mike Bibby three-pointers</a> in the world aren&apos;t gonna make this offseason any easier for the Knicks.</p>

<p>The Knicks have long said they would match any offer given to Lin. But the contract the Rockets offered him is called a &quot;poison pill&quot; deal for a reason: Lin would get $5 million and $5.2 million his first two years, and then a backloaded salary of $10.5 million in years three and four, as a way to create luxury-tax hardship for the Knicks. Now that Nash is gone&#x2014;and Jason Kidd looks increasingly likely to stay in Dallas&#x2014;it seems like this will have to be a no-brainer for the Knicks. </p>

<p>And the team has another deal in the works it seems to take some pressure off of Lin: according to the Daily News and Post, the Knicks are now <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160706111833/http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/basketball/knicks/ny-knicks-favorites-sign-free-agent-point-guard-raymond-felton-source-article-1.1108210?localLinksEnabled=false">actively trying to bring back</a> Raymond Felton, who was traded to Denver in that blockbuster, gut-the-team deal for Carmelo Anthony in 2011. Felton flourished offensively in NY under Mike D&apos;Antoni, but has been underwhelming since. This is a good start, though we&apos;re not sure if Felton will be able to fill the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160706111833/http://espn.go.com/new-york/nba/story/_/id/8126737/2012-nba-free-agency-toronto-raptors-new-york-knicks-landry-fields-verbal-deal-sources-say">Landry Fields</a>/Jeremy Lin <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160706111833/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/09/linsanity_now_is_jeremy_lin_the_tim.php">BFF handshake-sized hole</a> in our hearts. <br>
