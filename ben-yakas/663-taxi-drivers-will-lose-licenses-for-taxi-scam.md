Altogether, 21,819 taxicab drivers overcharged passengers a total of 286,000 times, resulting in $1.1 million in overcharges for passengers. <p></p>

<p>When the taxi scandal of 2010 first broke, it was estimated that 35,000 drivers overcharged passengers a total of $8.3 million, but those initial estimates were soon deflated as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422144122/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/23/as_more_information_rolls_in.php">over-the-top</a> when more information was revealed about how the overcharges occurred. The majority of those 21,000+ drivers, 13,315, only overcharged passengers once or twice. But the 663 who will lose their licenses did so 50 or more times.</p>

<p>Even though the overall numbers were diminished from what they were first thought to be, City Council member and transportation chair James Vacca justified passengers anger: &#x201C;Riders have a right to pay the appropriate fare and not a penny more. <strong>While the number of cabbies accused of repeated overcharging is relatively small, that in no way limits how outraged we should be by those who nickel-and-dimed riders.&#x201D;</strong></p>
