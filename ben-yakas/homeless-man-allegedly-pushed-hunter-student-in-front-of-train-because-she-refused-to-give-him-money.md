                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="92613metro.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20131128063737im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/92613metro.jpeg" width="640" height="477"> <br> <i> Maya Leggat (Google+)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>Yesterday, a young woman was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131128063737/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/25/woman_survives_after_being_pushed_i.php">shoved onto the train tracks in front of an oncoming Metro-North train</a> in Westchester. Hunter College student Maya Leggat, 21, was standing on the northbound platform of the White Plains station just after 11 a.m. Wednesday when 39-year-old homeless man Howard Mickens allegedly shoved her onto the tracks. &#x201C;A homeless man hangs out in front here &#x2014; decides he wants to inflict some pain to somebody, asks somebody for change,&#x201D; newsstand operator Gary Waxman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131128063737/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2013/09/25/woman-pushed-in-front-of-metro-north-train-in-white-plains/">told CBS</a>. <strong>&#x201C;And one girl upstairs decides to come out of bathroom. She refused to give him money, and he pushed her in front of the train.&#x201D;</strong></p>

<p>&#x201C;I see [Mickens] every day,&#x201D; Waxman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131128063737/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/hunter-student-survives-push-tracks-metro-north-station-article-1.1467656">told the Daily News</a>. &#x201C;This is the first time he&#x2019;s ever done a heinous act like this.&#x201D; Leggat was rushed to Westchester Medical Center, where she is listed in critical condition with a mangled leg. &#x201C;She&#x2019;s gonna need multiple surgeries on her leg &#x2014; it could take months.&#x201D; a family member <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131128063737/http://nypost.com/2013/09/25/woman-survives-being-pushed-in-front-of-train/">told The Post</a>. &#x201C;She also has a head injury. She&#x2019;s cut up pretty bad.&#x201D; Witnesses also said she lost some fingers in the incident.</p>

<p>Mickens was arraigned on attempted murder charges today. He has 11 previous arrests for robbery, assault and drug possession convictions. &#x201C;We are very angry because we found out that the guy was hanging out at that station for the last six months causing problems,&#x201D; Leggat&apos;s family member added to the Post.<br>
