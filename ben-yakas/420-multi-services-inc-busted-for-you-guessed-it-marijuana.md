<p>Marijuana arrests have dropped nearly 13% so far in 2014, continuing the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504132717/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/12/marijuana_arrests_keep_falling_nypd.php">downward trend</a> that started back in late 2011 when the NYPD finally <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504132717/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/24/ray_kelly_to_nypd_marijuana_is_decr.php">started putting the brakes</a> on petty low-level marijuana busts. But there is one area where weed arrests are up however: businesses that prominently display 420 in their signs.</p>

<p>The owner and three employees of Bronx tax filing business 420 Multi Services Inc. were arrested on marijuana possession charges this week. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504132717/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/bronx/bronx-tax-preparer-pot-article-1.1729889">According to the News</a>, an NYPD narcotics officer &quot;observed&quot; the four people in the Morris Park office&#x2014;which has two giant 420-emblazoned green signs on its front, hint hint&#x2014;with a ziplock bag full of weed. After searching the premises, cops found seven ziplock bags with two ounces of pot, a pipe and a grinder. Owner Michael Thomas, 35, and employees Christina Clarke, 28, Mark Parsons, 48, and Christopher Mullahey, 36, were all arrested. </p>

<p>According <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504132717/http://nypost.com/2014/03/22/pot-busts-way-down-after-cops-change-tactics/">to the Post</a>, 6,227 people have been arrested for marijuana this year between January 1st and March 20th, which is 901 fewer than during the same period last year. For some more perspective: 28,649 people were arrested on pot charges altogether in 2013, down nearly 30 percent from the 40,661 people arrested in 2012, which was down from 50,680 arrests <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504132717/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/01/nypds_low-level_marijuana_possessio.php">for low-level marijuana offenses in 2011.</a> And just imagine: if John Liu were mayor, 90% of those arrests <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504132717/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/14/liu.php">wouldn&apos;t even have happened.</a></p>
