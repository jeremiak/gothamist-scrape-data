<p>Cronut conjurer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420053740/http://gothamist.com/tags/dominiqueansel">Dominique Ansel</a> is set to unleash his latest viral confection, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420053740/http://gothamist.com/tags/chocolatechipcookiemilkshots">Chocolate Chip Cookie Milk shot</a>, upon NYC this afternoon. And not since the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420053740/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/02/faces_of_madness_cronut_fans_form_l.php">heady days of Summer 2013</a> have we seen foodiot lines this unwieldy. </p>

<p><iframe src="//web.archive.org/web/20140420053740if_/http://player.vimeo.com/video/89133026?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" width="640" height="361" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>Food editor Nell Casey, who is at the scene to try the shots, tells us it isn&apos;t quite as wild as the first unveiling of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420053740/http://gothamist.com/tags/cronut">cronut</a>&#x2014;the line goes about halfway down Spring Street, and an Ansel spokesperson estimates the line is about 60% of the initial one for the cronuts. But it&apos;s still Big Enough News that the Daily News <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420053740/http://live.nydailynews.com/Event/Dominque_Ansels_Milk_and_Cookie_Shot_Debut?utm_content=buffere7213&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer">is live blogging</a> every portentous step they take toward extra aerated cookie dough heaven. </p>

<p>Tempers are flaring at the hint of line-cutting: Casey says that a &quot;super rude reporter&quot; interviewing people at the front of the line was interrupted by a passerby who asked, &quot;What are you guys waiting for?&quot; The response: <strong>&quot;Why don&apos;t you get on line bitch.&quot;</strong> Sounds like <em>someone</em> has no patience for ignorance of Tahitian vanilla-infused Swede Farm milk.</p>
