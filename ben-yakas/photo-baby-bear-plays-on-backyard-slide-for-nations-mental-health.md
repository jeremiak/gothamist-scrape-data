<p>It&apos;s not every day that you come home to find a family of bears playing in your backyard, but for one New Jersey mom and her two daughters, that was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151004040043/http://www.nj.com/morris/index.ssf/2013/09/photos_bears_play_on_slide_in_roxbury_backyard.html">exactly what happened when</a>&#x2014;OH JESUS CHRIST, IT&apos;S STRAIGHT UP CHILLIN&apos; ON THAT SLIDE, IT KNOWS IN ITS HEART THAT IT&apos;S PEOPLE, CAN WE KEEP IT MOM? Fortunately or unfortunately, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151004040043/http://www.nj.com/morris/index.ssf/2013/09/photos_bears_play_on_slide_in_roxbury_backyard.html">NJ.com reports</a> that Maryann Vanadia&apos;s kids ended up scaring the bears away with an air horn after taking <em>70 photos</em> of them. </p>

<p>Anyway, you can check out a few more candid photos of these playful bears making a mess <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151004040043/http://www.nj.com/morris/index.ssf/2013/09/photos_bears_play_on_slide_in_roxbury_backyard.html">in Vanadia&apos;s backyard on NJ.com</a>. And if you&apos;re tempted to adopt an adorable bear cub, just remember that even cute things sometimes pack ferociously adorable bites.</p>
