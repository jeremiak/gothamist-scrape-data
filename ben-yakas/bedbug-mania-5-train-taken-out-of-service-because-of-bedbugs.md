<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504130910/http://gothamist.com/tags/bedbugs">bedbug assault</a> on our mass transit system continued yesterday as a 5 train was taken out of service because a straphanger spotted bedbugs on the train. Joe Costales, chairman of Transport Workers Union Local 100, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504130910/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/bedbugs-found-lexington-ave-subway-line-article-1.1897493">told the News that</a> the rider saw a bedbug fall off a homeless man. That straphanger was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504130910/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTzA_xesrL8">reportedly heard whispering hoarsely</a>, &quot;I&apos;ve seen things you people wouldn&apos;t believe...all those moments will be lost in time, like bedbugs in rain.&quot;</p>

<p>And that wasn&apos;t the only surprise Friday: yet another N train was reportedly taken out of service because a motorman reported bedbugs in the car. Which means <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504130910/http://gothamist.com/2014/08/07/bedbugs_n_train_subway.php">at least five subway cars</a> have been destabilized by bedbugs since this <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504130910/http://gothamist.com/2014/08/06/bed_bugs_on_the_n_train.php">bugademic broke out</a>, and we are finally prepared to invest in a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504130910/http://www.esafetysupplies.com/DuPont-Tychem-TK-HazMat-Fully-Encapsulated-Level-A-Coverall.html?gclid=CMzV1d6_hsACFQto7AodyzAArw">DuPont -Tychem TK HazMat Fully Encapsulated Level A Coverall suit.</a></p>

<p>MTA spokesman Adam Lisberg was nonchalant about the prospect of bedbugs jumping aboard the Lexington Avenue line after a week of terrorizing N trains: &quot;The subway system has 5.5 million riders every single day and we can&#x2019;t check all of them for bedbugs before letting them on the train,&quot; he told the News. &quot;That said, when we get reports of bedbug sightings we investigate &#x2014; and exterminate. This is an interesting story but not a big problem.&quot;</p>

<p>Maybe we&apos;ve been overreacting&#x2014;after all, it&apos;s just been a few N train cars and <em>one</em> 5 train. This can&apos;t be the first time a homeless person has brought a bedbug along with them onto a subway. And it&apos;s not like mass hysteria is spreading or anythi&#x2014;</p>

<p>&quot;I killed it with an old MetroCard receipt,&quot; Hector Berrios <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504130910/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/bedbugs-found-lexington-ave-subway-line-article-1.1897493">told the News</a> about a bedbug he claims he killed on the floor of a 4 train on Friday. &quot;I turned it over and was like &#x2018;Whoa! It&#x2019;s a bedbug alright.&#x2019; There was blood all over. I don&#x2019;t even want to think about it being on my clothes.&quot; </p>

<p>He took a photo, and showed it to Gil Bloom, president of Standard Pest Management, who confirmed it was indeed a bedbug: &#x201C;Bedbugs are a presence in our society and are an issue,&quot; Bloom said. &#x201C;They will from time to time get on people&#x2019;s belongings and inadvertently will be carried onto areas like the subway, restaurants, offices...<strong>I don&#x2019;t think people should get crazy about it, but you need to be aware of certain threats out there and you need to learn to be careful about them</strong>.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Sure.</p>
