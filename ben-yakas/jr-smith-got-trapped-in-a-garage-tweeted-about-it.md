<p>Nothing has been going right for the Knicks this season, and nothing has been going right for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151122121006/http://gothamist.com/tags/jrsmith">JR Smith</a> either&#x2014;he missed the first five games of the season after failing a drug test, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151122121006/http://espn.go.com/new-york/nba/story/_/id/10009174/jr-smith-panicking-new-york-knicks-fourth-straight-loss">he&apos;s &quot;panicking&quot;</a> over his lackluster play, and his brother has become the butt of jokes around the league. The icing on the cake: he got trapped in a garage (presumably his) on Thursday evening. And then he tweeted about it.</p>

<p>Just because he was trapped in a garage didn&apos;t mean he didn&apos;t have time to shout out to his fans:</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151122121006/https://twitter.com/jenist/status/403652607471648768">We desperately wanted</a> to believe that JR really was trapped in a garage, and not just referring to a glass garage of emotion or something metaphorical. And as it turns out, there was a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151122121006/https://twitter.com/PSEGdelivers/status/403650027257860096">power outage in Hudson County</a>, where JR has a home.</p>

<p>The Knicks don&apos;t play again till Saturday. In the meantime, we&apos;ve reached out to JR to see whether he needs any supplies.</p>
