                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="82313kellybreak.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130823223426im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/82313kellybreak.jpeg" width="640" height="407" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>Have you ever felt like the internet made something just for you? Like it peeked inside your soul and decided you&apos;ve had a rough run of it lately, so here are a bunch of things you love all smashed together? That&apos;s how I felt today when I saw that someone mashed together a video of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130823223426/http://gothamist.com/tags/breakingbad"><em>Breaking Bad</em></a> characters singing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130823223426/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/23/where_were_you_when_you_first_heard.php">the greatest song of the &apos;00s</a>, R. Kelly&apos;s &quot;Ignition (Remix).&quot; </p>

<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="//web.archive.org/web/20130823223426if_/http://www.youtube.com/embed/8Hn5_-PON1U" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>Sure, the video isn&apos;t perfect (some lines are a bit rushed in the edit), but it doesn&apos;t matter, because it is also perfect. Hell, it&apos;s worth it just for the &quot;bounce&quot; part (who knew so many characters had said &quot;bounce&quot; in the show?), and the car honks. And this is certainly the best possible way to head into the freakin&apos; weekend.</p>
