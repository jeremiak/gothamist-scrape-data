<p>A 9-year-old boy was fatally struck by a cab driver on the Upper West Side last night in front of his father. Dr. Richard Stock and his son Cooper was both struck by the cab as they were walking westward on W 97th Street, crossing West End Avenue around 9 p.m. Friday. Alex Lassi, a doorman who works at a nearby building, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150716232332/http://nypost.com/2014/01/10/man-child-killed-in-separate-accidents/">told the Post</a> Stock let out a &quot;terrifying scream.&quot;</p>

<p>Stock, a radiation oncologist who treated Rudy Giuliani for prostate cancer in 2000, suffered a leg injury; he and his son were taken to St. Luke&#x2019;s Hospital, where Cooper was pronounced dead. Two passengers in an SUV stopped to help the father after the incident; they shouted at the 53-year-old cab driver to stay at the scene, which he did. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150716232332/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/killed-separate-crashes-upper-west-side-article-1.1576033">The News says</a> he appeared to be in shock, burying his head in his jacket as he waited to talk to police.</p>

<p>In a separate incident, a 73-year-old man was fatally struck a few blocks away at West 96th Street and Broadway around 8:30 p.m. Police say he was struck by a private tour bus driver as he was crossing 96th Street. The driver, who stayed at the scene, apparently didn&apos;t see the unidentified man, and dragged him under the bus. &#x201C;As soon as I heard that noise, I knew that somebody was underneath the bus,&#x201D; witness Coral Martin, 23, told the News. &#x201C;We started running after the bus driver. &#x201C;I was crying and screaming.&#x201D;</p>

<p>No charges have been filed in either incident; police add both investigations are ongoing.</p>
