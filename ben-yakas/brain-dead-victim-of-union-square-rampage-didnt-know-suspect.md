His doctors have now told cops that he is brain dead, according to the criminal complaint.</p>

<p>Babbitt didn&apos;t know his alleged attacker, 31-year-old LeShawn Marten, who has been charged with felony assault in the incident. Marten, who police believe is homeless, was hanging out by the chess tables in the park before the incident when he became angry no one wanted to play him: sources say he jumped up allegedly shouting &quot;I hate white people,&quot; then struck Babbitt.</p>

<p>&quot;He said &apos;The next white person who walks by, I&apos;m going to [expletive],&apos;&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150919171246/http://www.wusa9.com/news/article/273932/158/NYC-man-brain-dead-after-random-attack">one female witness</a> told WCBS. &quot;His fist went in and the man&apos;s head bobbed and he hit the ground and you could hear his skull hitting the ground.&quot;  Two other men, 48- and 18-years-old, came to the aide of Babbitt, and were also allegedly attacked by Marten; both sustained minor injuries.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150919171246/http://www.newsday.com/news/new-york/jeffrey-babbitt-brain-dead-after-union-square-attack-hate-crime-charges-possible-police-say-1.6030592">Neighbors told Newsday that</a> Babbitt was a former train conductor who has lived with his 94-year-old mother Lucille, in a Sheepshead Bay co-op for nearly two decades. Lucille has Alzheimer&apos;s, and Babbitt had been her primary caretaker. &quot;Everybody&apos;s broken up about this,&quot; said neighbor, Audrey Feifer. &quot;If you had to go to the doctor or anywhere, he would take you.&quot; Babbit loved trains and comic books, and was a regular at comic book store Forbidden Planet, two blocks from where he was attacked.</p>

<p>Police say Marten has a prior conviction for assault in NY, and has numerous other arrests mostly out of state. When he was arraigned Thursday night, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150919171246/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20130906/union-square/man-coma-after-racist-union-square-attack-sources-say">DNAInfo reported</a> he mocked the judge and asked that his bail be set at one penny&#x2014;in response, the judge set bail at $1 million. Police are still investigating the incident <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150919171246/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/06/union_square_possible_hate_crime.php">as a possible hate crime</a>, and charges against Marten may be increased this week.</p>
