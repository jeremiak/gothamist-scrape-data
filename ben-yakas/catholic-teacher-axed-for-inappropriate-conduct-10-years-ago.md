Joseph Appel, 33, had been dean of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508150239/http://www.xaverian.org/">Xaverian High School&apos;s</a> honors program and its drama director. Officials told students about his dismissal at an assembly earlier this week: &quot;They told us he did something inappropriate with a student 10 years ago,&quot; said one student at the Bay Ridge school.</p>

<p>Appel, who graduated from Xaverian in 1995, began working there as a teacher in 2001 after graduating from Seton Hall University, the same year the alleged misconduct occurred. Students and alums told the Post that Appel was well-liked, and they never suspected any shenanigans between him and the boys. A source also told the Post that Xaverian used a private investigator they retain to look into the allegations, and found them credible. &quot;We took swift action. We consider it our fundamental responsibility to protect each of our students,&quot; said Xaverian President Robert Alesi.
