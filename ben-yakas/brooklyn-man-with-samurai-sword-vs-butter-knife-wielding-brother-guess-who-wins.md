<p>You don&apos;t have to be a Gallagher or a Baldwin to know that even loving brothers may come to blows once in a while. But the important thing is that no one overreacts and pulls out a samurai sword&#x2014;which is what happened between two brothers in Brooklyn on Monday after one pulled out a butter knife.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717085016/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/sword-defeats-butter-knife-brotherly-fight-article-1.1337818?localLinksEnabled=false">According to cops</a>, Queens resident 52-year-old Adalberto Caceres got into squabble with 50-year-old brother Jose at his Bedford-Stuyvesant apartment Monday evening. Adalberto reportedly waved a butter knife at his mother, who was also there, and shoved her to the floor. After a shouting match with his brother, Adalberto lunged at Jose. But cops say Jose came prepared, slashing Alsaberto with a &#x201C;samurai-type sword,&#x201D; nearly slicing off two of his fingers.</p>

<p>The digits were saved in the end, and both brothers were charged with menacing, harassment and weapons possession. In addition, Jose was charged with assault, and Adalberto with attempted assault. These weren&apos;t the only brothers up to trouble this week in Brooklyn: Patrick Noonan and his brother Taylor <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717085016/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/brooklyn-brothers-shot-man-roid-rage-nypd-article-1.1338022">surrendered to police after</a> they allegedly shot a 34-year-old stranger in the leg in an apparent roid rage. It came out the brothers had hoarded more than 130 tubes of prescription testosterone gel. </p>
