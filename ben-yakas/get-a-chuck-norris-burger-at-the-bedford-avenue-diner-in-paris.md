title: Get A Chuck Norris Burger At The "Bedford Avenue" Diner In Paris

<p>We&apos;ve heard reports in the past <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151028073930/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/30/is_brooklyn_the_new_barf_paris.php">that Brooklyn is the new Paris</a>, but also that hipsters ruined Paris <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151028073930/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/10/extra_extra_2735.php">by turning it into Brooklyn.</a> Here&apos;s a tiny bit more fuel for that fire: did you know that there&apos;s a &quot;Bedford Avenue Brooklyn Diner&quot; located on rue de Champ de Mars?</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151028073930/http://brooklynbased.com/blog/2012/10/24/diner-paris-edition/">Brooklyn Based</a> stumbled upon the eatery, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151028073930/http://untappedcities.com/2013/12/20/nyc-v-paris-brooklyn-diner-at-the-eiffel-tower-and-in-williamsburg/">Untapped Cities</a> was highly amused by the fact nothing about their Brooklyn-aping logo, which claims they have a real Bedford sister restaurant, is correct. </p>

<p>The closest equivalent is Diner on Broadway and Berry, and owner Andrew Tarlow knew nothing of the other place: &#x201C;I had never heard of it until I saw your instagram photo,&#x201D; Tarlow wrote to Brooklyn Based. <strong>&#x201C;I wonder if the owners in Paris even know we exist. Parisians can be like that sometimes.&#x201D;</strong></p>

<p>Our favorite part is their supreme adoration for one Chuck Norris, as if this Bedford Avenue is stuck squarely in 1999. Their love for all things Norris includes both a burger on the menu named after to him and a framed photo of him on the wall. Chuck Norris might be, at this point, supremely un-Brooklyn, but the fact the Paris outpost <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151028073930/http://www.yelp.com/biz/bedford-avenue-paris">serves breakfast all day</a> seems very right. </p>
