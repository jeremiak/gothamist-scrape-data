After a couple false reports about possible suspects by various national news organizations, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505122058/http://www.fbi.gov/news/updates-on-investigation-into-multiple-explosions-in-boston/photos">the FBI has officially released</a> photos and videos of the two real suspects wanted in connection with Monday&apos;s deadly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505122058/http://gothamist.com/tags/bostonmarathon">Boston marathon bombings.</a> &quot;The FBI is showing images of two suspects who they believe are associated,&quot; said Special Agent in Charge of the FBI&#x2019;s Boston Field Office Richard DesLauriers this afternoon. &quot;We consider them to be armed and extremely dangerous.&quot; You can see video of them below.</p>

<p>&quot;Some images show two men walking together,&quot; he added. &quot;One is in a backwards white baseball hat and the second is in a dark jacket, open with a white shirt and wearing a backpack.&quot; Suspect #2, the one in the white hat, was the only person &quot;seen planting a device.&quot;</p>

<p>The FBI noted that they&apos;ve received thousands of leads and tips in the days since the bombing; no other details of the investigation will be released &quot;because this is our focus now.&quot; If you recognize either of the individuals, the FBI asks that you contact boston@ic.fbi.gov or 1-800-CALL-FBI (1-800-225-5324), </p>
