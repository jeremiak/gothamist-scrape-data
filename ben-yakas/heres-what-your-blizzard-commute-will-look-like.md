<p>The city is frantically preparing for the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509165705/http://gothamist.com/tags/blizzard">incoming blizzard</a> (Nemo&apos;easter?) that is due to hit the East Coast <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509165705/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/07/what_time_is_it_going_to_start_snow.php">today and tomorrow</a>, and is sure to leave slushy piles of rats strewn far and wide across our fair metropolis. Sure, The Weather Channel may have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509165705/http://gawker.com/5982593/snow-panic-has-driven-weathercom-completely-insane">literally gone completely insane</a> in hyping up this storm, but that doesn&apos;t mean it won&apos;t have a serious impact on your commute today. Already, the 7 train is delayed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509165705/http://alert.mta.info/gss/2/2">due to inclement weather</a>&#x2014;and it&apos;s only raining right now! So below, find out what your commute may look like later today.</p>

<p>The MTA has mobilized its fleet of snow and ice-busting equipment in anticipation of this storm&#x2014;that includes super-powered snow throwers, 10 jet-powered snow-blowers, and five specially-built de-icing cars. You can check out <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509165705/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/07/heres_how_the_mta_will_stare_this_b.php#photo-1">photos and video of the fleet here.</a> They add that they&apos;ll have 175 additional staff on duty throughout the storm. Beyond that, we&apos;ll likely learn more about the MTA&apos;s plans for the subway at Mayor Bloomberg&apos;s afternoon update on storm preparations. Suffice to say, don&apos;t expect the 7 to get any better today.</p>
