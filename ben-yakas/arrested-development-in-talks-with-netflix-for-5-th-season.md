<p>The murmurs of another Netflix season of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130723215748/http://gothamist.com/tags/arresteddevelopment"><em>Arrested Development</em></a> are starting to get louder and louder: Brian Grazer, co-chairman of Imagine Entertainment and AD executive producer, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130723215748/http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-07-11/netflix-in-talks-for-another-season-of-arrested-development-.html">told Bloomberg TV</a> that Netflix is currently in talks to start work on a fifth season. </p>

<center><script src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130723215748js_/http://player.ooyala.com/player.js?embedCode=F2YjU4ZDpUhIjue2Pgskev7YsRvDa7s5&amp;playerBrandingId=8a7a9c84ac2f4e8398ebe50c07eb2f9d&amp;width=640&amp;deepLinkEmbedCode=F2YjU4ZDpUhIjue2Pgskev7YsRvDa7s5&amp;height=360&amp;thruParam_bloomberg-ui[popOutButtonVisible]=FALSE"></script></center>

<p>&quot;We were really excited that it came back and that people were able to watch it all at once,&quot; Grazer says in the interview above. &quot;We&apos;re in conversations with [Netflix] to do another season; they are interested, Netflix, in doing that; Mitch [Hurwitz] is ready to do it, and so are the actors.&quot;</p>

<p>Shortly after the premiere of the 4th season, Netflix CEO Reed Hastings went back on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130723215748/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/25/netflix_will_only_produce_one_seaso.php">wary earlier statements</a> that the season would be a one-off, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130723215748/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/29/netflix_willing_to_do_more_episodes.php">noting that the company would be interested</a> in doing a fifth season of AD: &#x201C;Arrested is unique, because that&#x2019;s really up to the talent. If the talent were willing to do more, and interested in that, I&#x201D;m sure we would be willing.&#x201D; </p>

<p>And in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130723215748/http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gj9mt/i_am_mitch_hurwitz_creator_of_arrested/">a Reddit AMA last month</a>, Hurwitz once again explained how season 4&#x2014;in which most of the family was purposefully cut off from each other, both for storytelling and scheduling purposes&#x2014;was always meant as Act 1 of a longer story. But while he previously has refered to Act 2 and 3 as the long-gestating AD film, he referred to it as season 5 this time: </p>

<blockquote>For the 5th season, it would DEFINITELY be about the family all together. That was always the design. The idea was originally to have them even together LESS for Season 4 - it really was going to be basically 9 stories (like the Salinger collection) that had nothing to do with one another, and just showed everybody&apos;s life, so that everybody&apos;s life could get to a point of peril, and then the family could truly have no choice but to get back together for the next iteration.</blockquote>

<p>It seems maybe Hurwitz finally gets what Maeby said in her season 4 POV episode (&quot;Senioritis&quot;): maybe AD really does work better as a TV show.</p>
