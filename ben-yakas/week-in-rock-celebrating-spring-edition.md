One such outdoor fest, \<a href=\"http://www.bricartsmedia.org/performing-arts/celebrate-brooklyn/2010-gala\"\>Celebrate Brooklyn!\<\/a\>, has just announced its 32nd annual festival with an opening night performance by Norah Jones on June 9. And it\'s free (though there is a $3 suggested donation)! Prior to the show, there will be the Opening Night Gala party, with ticket prices starting at $325. Last year saw artists such as David Byrne, MGMT and Animal Collective \<a href=\"http://gothamist.com/2009/04/07/celebrate_brooklyn.php\"\>all taking part\<\/a\> in the festivities. The full summer lineup will be announced May 4.\<p\>", "credit":"Photo by \<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/hailmaryny/3717531605/\"\>Ryan Muir\<\/a\>"};galleryObj['photo_1'] = photo;</script>

They\'re a big band these days, but it took \<a href=\"http://www.brooklynvegan.com/archives/2010/03/spoon_and_dan_b.html\"\>last Friday\'s\<\/a\> sold out Radio City Music Hall show to realize they\'re a \<em\>huge\<\/em\> band now.\<\/p\>\<p\> \r\nThe Strange Boys opened the evening, but Deerhunter set the table for the night, rocking out on a handful of new songs, and highlights from \<em\>Microcastle\<\/em\> that included \"Nothing Ever Happened\" and \"Little Kids.\" Their sound felt somewhat fuzzy in the large space, with noisy loops being smothered in the hall, although they made up for it with some extended jamming and kraut-rock inspired grooves toward the end.\<\/p\>\<p\>\r\nSpoon played a celebratory 24-song set that took in highlights from across their career, including a \<a href=\"http://gothamist.com/2006/12/13/britt_daniel_mu.php\"\>Britt Daniels\<\/a\> solo acoustic take on \"Me and the Bean\" to begin the set. Then the night took on an air of classic-gig status with two big guest stars: Eleanor Friedberger of The Fiery Furnaces came out for a take on the her band\'s \"Waiting to Know You\" and a duet on \"Someone Something,\" and Dan Boeckner of Wolf Parade appeared in the encore to sing WP\'s \"Modern World\" and provide extra saw-like guitar on \"I Saw the Light.\" The night ended just before midnight with the jittery, tambourine-led \"Small Stakes\" and thousands of fans dancing in their place, a fleet of blue glow sticks flying through the air. \<em\>(You can see a video of Spoon covering Wolf Parade\'s \"Modern World\" below)\<\/em\>\<\/p\>\r\n\<object width=\"640\" height=\"360\"\>\<param name=\"allowfullscreen\" value=\"true\" /\>\<param name=\"allows\criptaccess\" value=\"always\" /\>\<param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=10627277&server=vimeo.com&show_title=1&show_byline=1&show_portrait=0&color=aeb3b5&fullscreen=1\" /\>\<embed src=\"http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=10627277&server=vimeo.com&show_title=1&show_byline=1&show_portrait=0&color=aeb3b5&fullscreen=1\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" allows\criptaccess=\"always\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\"\>\<\/embed\>\<\/object\>\<p\>\<a href=\"http://vimeo.com/10627277\"\>Spoon-Modern World (with Dan Boeckner)\<\/a\> from \<a href=\"http://vimeo.com/gothamist\"\>Gothamist\<\/a\> on \<a href=\"http://vimeo.com\"\>Vimeo\<\/a\>.\<\/p\>", "credit":"Photo by Ben Yakas/Gothamist"};galleryObj['photo_2'] = photo;</script>

But since their last excellent release, 2008\'s \<em\>You and Me\<\/em\>, they\'ve begun leaning toward a mellower, Leonard Cohen-inspired side. All their different personas were present at their sweaty show Thursday night at the Bell House, along with an occasional brass section, a prominent triangle, and some very fashionable button-down shirts.\<\/p\>\<p\>\r\nLeithauser told the audience the band have been busy putting the finishing touches on their fifth album, due to be released later this year; the group played several strong new songs from it, including one \"written yesterday\" and the rocking \"Angela.\" On another new song, Leithauser mused, \"half my life I\'ve been waking up\"; it was the perfect Walkmen sentiment, both weighted by anxiousness and eager to break out of it. They also played highlights from \<em\>You and Me\<\/em\> (\"Canadian Girl,\" \"In the New Year,\" \"On the Water\") and older, more angular guitar classics (\"Thinking of a Dream I Had,\" \"Wake Up,\" \"Little House of Savages\").\<\/p\>\<p\>\r\nAlthough there was less screaming than in Walkmen gigs of years past, the audience was treated to a fast-tempo\'d, minimalist take on their beloved \"We\'ve Been Had\"; it was especially fitting that their ultimate ode to anxiousness and aging was carried along by an audience sing-along.\<\/p\>", "credit":"Photo by Ben Yakas/Gothamist"};galleryObj['photo_3'] = photo;</script>

Taking their cues from \'60\'s AM radio-pop and candy-flavored folk, She and Him (Deschanel and indie guitar maestro \<a href=\"http://gothamist.com/2009/07/30/m_ward_musician_1.php\"\>M Ward\<\/a\>) are very good with a sunny, boppy melody.\<\/p\>\<p\> \r\nPlaying the bulk of both of their albums (\<em\>Vol. 1\<\/em\> and \<em\>2\<\/em\>), the show revealed the stiff nature of many of the songs, despite the excellent singing and careful crafting. To a certain degree, the show banked on Deschanel\'s charms winning over, and she did her best at it, whether doing a whistle solo, playing ukulele, or bunny hopping with a tambourine. Opener \"I Was Made For You\" was piano-pop fun, \"Why Do You Let Me Stay Here?\" sounded like a lost radio hit, and \"You Really Got a Hold On Me\" was a fantastic duet between Ward and Deschanel. It made one wish they\'d explore the textures of their voices together more, and maybe loosen the anchor of the songwriting craft a bit as well.\<p\>", "credit":""};galleryObj['photo_4'] = photo;</script>
