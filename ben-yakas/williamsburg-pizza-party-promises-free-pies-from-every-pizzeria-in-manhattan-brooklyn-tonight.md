<p>If it&apos;s way too good to be true, then it&apos;s usually way too good to be true. But when it comes to the cheese-tomato-carbohydrates mashup we call <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150313125756/http://gothamist.com/tags/pizza">pizza</a>, we&apos;re willing to believe the impossible. And tonight, the impossible is supposedly taking place in Williamsburg: an event at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150313125756/http://standardcreative.tumblr.com/">Standard Creative Studio</a> promises free pizza from &quot;every pizzeria in NYC.&quot; </p>

<p>The event, which is sponsored by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150313125756/http://shocktopbeer.tumblr.com/">Shock Top Beer</a>, was organized by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150313125756/http://instagram.com/ronenv">Ronen V</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150313125756/http://arazor.tumblr.com/">A Razor, A Shiny Knife</a>, the same team behind the six-course <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150313125756/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/02/l_train_six_course_gourmet_lunch_f.php">gourmet dinner party on the L Train back in 2011.</a> The event is happening on &quot;Pizza Day&quot; in honor of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150313125756/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raffaele_Esposito">Raffaele Esposito</a>, who is widely considered as having invented pizza 125 years ago. </p>

<p>The organizers tell us that they expect they&apos;ll have &quot;1 pie per pizzeria. Final count TBD but we&apos;re looking at 400+&quot; places from Manhattan and Brooklyn. More specifically: the pizzas were purchased &quot;as walk-ins or delivered to central locations throughout Manhattan. They also ordered every delivery pizza possible in Williamsburg. Total of 350-400 pizzerias.&quot; </p>

<p>It&apos;s not quite &quot;every pizzeria&quot; in NYC, but it certainly ain&apos;t bad. Pizza will continue to be delivered throughout the evening, so they don&apos;t expect to run out, even with a huge turnout (regardless, it is first come, first serve). You can get a taste of their pizzeria master list in the video below (organizers add that there&apos;s &quot;a big map here on the wall&quot; at the event space documenting each location).</p>

<p>There will also, thankfully, be free beer: &quot;Shock Top is all about living life unfiltered&#x2014;and to us that means bringing the unexpected to life and celebrating creative people who create big, surprising moments like a giant pizza party,&quot; said Eli Aguilera, Director of Shock Top. &quot;Shock Top is the perfect beer to help bring this event to life to honor pizza&#x2019;s birthday and the perfect pizza pairing&#x2014;beer.&quot;</p>

<p>In addition to the food and beer, there&apos;ll be a DJ set by Anamanaguchi, pizza carols by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150313125756/http://songsincorporated.com/">Jonathan Mann</a>, and an installation by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150313125756/http://thierryvanbiesen.tumblr.com/">Thierry Van Biesen</a>. The event will take place starting at 7 p.m. tonight at the studio, located on Wythe Avenue between N 13th and N 14th Streets. </p>
