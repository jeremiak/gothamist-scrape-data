<p>After being derailed because of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141102031002/http://gothamist.com/tags/hurricanesandy/1">Hurricane Sandy</a>, The Daily Show returned last night with reports from the powerless zones (&quot;Little North Korea&quot;), and to tackle the &quot;institutional competence&quot; regarding the response to the storm (with big praise to NJ Gov. Chris Christie and Bloomberg&apos;s ASL translator, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141102031002/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/30/bloombergs_sign_langauge_translator.php">Lydia Callis</a>). &quot;Do you ever have one of those days where everything you ever loved as a child was under water?&quot; Stewart asked at the start of his show.</p>

<p>Stewart gave praise to Christie, Andrew Cuomo, and Michael Bloomberg, who he argued proved that once you remove partisan gamesmanship from a situation, government performance improves dramatically: &quot;Mayor Bloomberg kicked ass at his job, and did it in two languages!&quot; Callis turned press briefings into &quot;an Alvin Ailey sign language recital;&quot; Cuomo made a statement about global warming that couldn&apos;t be refused; and Christie &quot;kicked crazy ass,&quot; even if he was a bit of a hypocrite.</p>
