<p>Yesterday, even as frogs weren&apos;t raining from the heavens, locusts weren&apos;t swarming the subways, and earthquakes weren&apos;t sending cities crashing into the oceans, we still held out a little hope that we&apos;d wake up to some sort of biblical fury today. Maybe just a little pestilence? Alas, the Apocalypse was a no-show yet again, leaving only sad, confused believers to be mocked in Times Square: <strong>&quot;I don&apos;t understand why nothing is happening. It&apos;s not a mistake. I did what I had to do. I did what the Bible said</strong>,&quot; said an exasperated Robert Fitzpatrick, the retired MTA worker who spent all of his money to publicize <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150306100919/http://gothamist.com/tags/judgmentday">Judgment Day</a>, at 6 p.m. in Times Square yesterday, as onlookers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150306100919/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/what_the_hell_ICUDxj5woqe2eg03U1voSK">laughed at him</a>. Watch a sad video of the confrontation below:</p>

<p>So today, many <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150306100919/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/2011/05/21/2011-05-21_as_doomsday_passes_attention_turns_to_harold_camping_religious_leader_who_starte.html">are wondering</a> where the hell is Harold Camping, the originator of this particular Doomsday prophecy, and what excuse he has for being wrong about the Rapture for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150306100919/http://blogs.sfweekly.com/thesnitch/2011/05/rapture_may_21_harold_camping.php">a second time</a>. SFist contributor Laura Beck captured <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150306100919/http://sfist.com/2011/05/21/harold_campings_house_in_alameda_at.php">the above shot</a> of the minister&apos;s Alameda home at 6:01 p.m. yesterday; according <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150306100919/http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/05/21/us-apocalypse-prediction-idUSTRE74I3KS20110521">to Reuters</a>, the curtains were drawn at Camping&apos;s house, and nobody was answering the door. Over at the Family Radio headquarters, there was a sign on the front door saying &quot;The Office is Closed. Sorry we missed you!&quot;</p>

<p>The deafening silence has not been overlooked by some of his now-former followers: &quot;I had some skepticism but I was trying to push the skepticism away because I believe in God...[but] it&#x2019;s God who leads you, not Harold Camping,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150306100919/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/national/apocalypse_later_world_doesn_end_7likeZ8gVMVzJxzGBI0UQO?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">said Keith Bauer</a>, who had hopped in his minivan in Maryland and drove his family 3,000 miles to California for the Rapture.</p>

<p>But maybe there were other points to Camping&apos;s second biblical folly beyond providing jokes for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150306100919/http://twitter.com/#!/JimGaffigan/status/71679194031063040">Twitterists</a>...like say, a great new excuse to get <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150306100919/http://i.imgur.com/HnKcb.jpg">out of jury duty</a>. But leave it to Taiwanese animation masters <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150306100919/http://gothamist.com/tags/nextmediaanimation">Next Media Animations</a> to point out what none of us could see right under our noses: never trust an alien with a bong.</p>
