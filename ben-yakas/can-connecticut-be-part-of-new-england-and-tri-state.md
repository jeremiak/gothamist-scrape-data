title: Can Connecticut Be Part of New England And Tri-State?

<p>NY has long had an uneasy alliance with Connecticut. Sure, it takes a bitter, drunken train ride with a bunch of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150622034349/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/19/man_stabbed_4_killing_1_after_being.php">gassy people</a> to get there, but any place that is willing to give Bobby Valentine <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150622034349/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/15/ex-mets_manager_continues_being_the.php">a job in government</a> can&apos;t be all bad. So despite the distance, we&apos;ve gone along with the whole <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150622034349/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tri-State_area_%28NY-NJ-CT%29">Tri-State area</a> thing, which incorporates three of the state&apos;s eight counties, Fairfield, New Haven and Litchfield, and a majority of the state&apos;s population. But it seems that CT has been having its cake and eating it: </p>

<p>The state is designated as part of both the Tri-State area AND the six-state hydra known as New England, due to its inclusion on the Discover New England <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150622034349/http://www.discovernewengland.org/">tourism website</a> and organization. In December, CT was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150622034349/http://www.ctpost.com/news/article/Malloy-puts-Conn-back-on-New-England-map-965336.php">erased from the map</a> on the site for failing to pay its annual organizational dues ($100,000), but they were just added back on today. This experience has brought a serious issue to light though: Can Connecticut really be considered a part of both New England AND the Tri-State Area? And most importantly, did Connecticuters root for the Jets or the Patriots last Sunday?</p>
