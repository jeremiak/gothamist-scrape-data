<p>An octogenarian couple was sent a harassing anonymous letter from a local real estate agent who was angry with them about the way they park their car. Bill and Barbara Doughten, both in their 80s, say they received the letter above from an Ocean Beach real estate agent, because apparently the way they park their car interferes with the agent&apos;s ability to &quot;sell million dollar homes in the neighborhood.&quot; Of course, the couple has a damn good reason why they park the way they do: &quot;My leg doesn&#x2019;t work,&quot; Bill Doughten <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140510235142/http://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/Angry-Letter-Criticizes-Curb-Appeal-of-Elderly-Couple-257737371.html">told NBC</a>. &quot;I do shake as you can possibly see.&quot;</p>

<p>Yes, the Dougtens park as they do to be a tiny bit closer to the door, to make it easier for Bill to walk back and forth when he brings groceries in. All their neighbors are aware of his condition, and are fine with their parking...except for the asshole who sent the letter with no return address or signature.</p>

<p>The couple&apos;s grandchildren were reasonably upset, with Stephanie Powley <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140510235142/https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10202505581573161&amp;set=pb.1003842708.-2207520000.1399517067.&amp;type=3&amp;theater">posting the letter on Facebook</a> with this message:</p>

<blockquote>Dear Cowardly Ocean City NJ Real Estate Agent:

<p>Your sloppy, hand written, unprofessional, anonymous and contemptuous note arrived at my eighty year old grandparents&apos; home today. </p>

<p>I have to say, that I have seen sales people do some pretty scum bag things in my life, but this may take the cake. </p>

<p>Did you take a moment to wonder why my grandfather parks in that lot? Did it cross your mind that he may do it to be closer to his front door? Did you even take ONE second to consider your inconsiderate, ignorant actions before you scribbled your frustration on that piece of printer paper? I&apos;m going to assume, not. Since you mailed it, with no return address - like only a true coward would.</p>

<p>What they do with the MILLION DOLLAR home and adjoining lot THEY OWN, is not your business or the business of your clients. </p>

<p>My grandparents have lived in Ocean City for longer than I&apos;m sure you&apos;ve been alive - and then some. They are loved and treated with respect by all of their surrounding neighbors - who all know why they park the way they park.</p>

<p>I think it&apos;s safe to assume that your sales aren&apos;t low due to where people park. I&apos;m betting the fact that you&apos;re not doing such a great job selling homes is because you&apos;re a pretentious douche bag. </p>

<p>I hope someone recognizes your handwriting so that your wife (long shot that you have one), your boss, or even YOUR GRANDPARENTS know who you are. Also, please note, if your &quot;clients&quot; aren&apos;t buying houses in Ocean City because of their &quot;would be&quot; neighbors parking arrangements, then we don&apos;t want them in the neighborhood anyway.</p>

<p>Shame on you. </p>

<p>(Ps: If anyone Ocean City Patch is interested in the harassment of the elderly in shore towns by real estate agents, here&apos;s a case for you)</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>The couple doesn&apos;t plan on changing anything about their routine: &quot;I can do whatever I want to do,&quot; Barbara said. &quot;I&#x2019;m not moving the car. I don&#x2019;t know of any million dollar homes in this neighborhood.&quot;<br>
