But as &quot;pistol-packing&quot; owner Robert Potenza testified, &quot;They didn&apos;t seem like they knew much about my business.&quot; And thus, some trade secrets of the strip club game were revealed in court as Potenza defended his legitimate business.<p></p>

<p>Government lawyers argued that Potenza, who has an NYPD permit to carry a gun, was &quot;structuring,&quot; making four-figure deposits of money just below the $10,000 amount required for federal reporting, a red flag for tax evasion. But Potenza explained that his club is just making too much money! So much in fact, that <strong>he has taken to stashing it in a broken refrigerator, a fishing tackle box, and atop a metal beam</strong>.</p>

<p>He explained that the club rakes in about $9,000 in cash a day Sunday through Wednesday, and much more that that from Thursday through Saturday, which explains why he was making so many deposits. Here&apos;s the really interesting part: he said that the &quot;house moms&quot; collect singles dancers receive as tips and give back &quot;tattered&quot; $20 bills. Then the &quot;good&quot; $20s are stocked in the ATM machine, which has a $5 transaction fee...<strong>of which Gallagher&apos;s takes a $4.50 cut.</strong></p>

<p>In case you were thinking of getting into the strip club business, let&apos;s sum up what we&apos;ve learned: always stash your cash on-hand in fishing tackle boxes and broken refrigerators. Separate your tattered $20s from your clean ones. Charge exorbitant fees on the ATM machine. And always renew your gun license.</p>
