<p>A truck driver was killed in a freak accident Wednesday morning when a manhole cover exploded, flew through his windshield, and struck him in the head. According to police, Jos&#xE9; Duran, 35, was driving westbound in the middle lane of the Cross Bronx Expressway around 5:30 a.m. Wednesday when the incident happened. The manhole cover hit him in the head, and Duran collided with another tractor-trailer.</p>

<p>The 31-year-old other driver was unharmed in the incident. Durham, a father-of-three from Massachusetts, suffered massive head trauma and was declared dead at Lincoln Hospital. It&apos;s unclear what caused the manhole cover to become airborne, but officials think it may have been dislodged by another truck. </p>

<p>AAA spokesman Robert Sinclair <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150816223536/http://nypost.com/2014/06/04/flying-manhole-cover-crashes-through-windshield-killing-trucker/">told the Post</a> he had never heard of such an incident happening before: &quot;That&#x2019;s a tragic, tragic accident,&quot; Sinclair said. &quot;I&#x2019;ve heard of cables shorting out and blowing them into the air, but this is the first I can remember of anything like this.&quot;</p>
