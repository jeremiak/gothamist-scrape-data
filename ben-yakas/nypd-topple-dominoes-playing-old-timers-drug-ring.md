<p>The NYPD busted a major cocaine and heroin trafficking ring in Washington Heights yesterday. The crew, known as the &quot;Old Timers,&quot; was run by men who played dominoes on the sidewalk, keeping a watchful eye over their turf around w160th street, between Fort Washington Avenue and Broadway. Eight members of the ring <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130707032044/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/coke_heroin_gang_busted_L6NRxU9nkPx8PdYZXnBBqO">were nabbed</a> following a 10-month wiretap investigation, which included 14 undercover buys of cocaine by officers. </p>

<p>&quot;<strong>There were older guys out there. It didn&apos;t look like they were doing anything bad</strong>. It is surprising but we feel safer knowing police have caught them,&quot; said resident Tim Clark.  As bad as the activities the &quot;Old Timers&quot; took part in might have been, they sound pretty benign compared to a lot of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130707032044/http://gothamist.com/2010/10/28/gangs_in_harlem.php">younger</a>, more gun-friendly slingers who will likely fight over their turf now that they&apos;re gone.</p>
