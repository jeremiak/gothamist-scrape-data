<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="33111gotti.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110424063934im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/33111gotti.jpg" width="280" height="105" class="image-left"> </span>John Travolta has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110424063934/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/john-travolta-set-play-mobster-172948">officially signed on</a> to star as John &quot;Teflon Don&quot; Gotti Sr. in the upcoming indie film <em>Gotti: Three Generations</em> (which was better than the working title: <em>Gabagool Lasagna Bang Bang</em>). The movie has been the passion project of John &quot;Deadlock Don&quot; Gotti Jr. ever since <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110424063934/http://gothamist.com/tags/johngottijr">he escaped</a> four hung jurys, retired from the mob, and realized he needed something to do besides being a professional defendant. Now the question remains: who will play him?</p>

<p>The movie, which will be helmed by <em>The Notebook</em> director Nick Cassavantes, was imagined by Gotti Jr. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110424063934/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/22/deadlock_don_making_a_movie_about_h.php">as a</a> &quot;father-son&quot; story, rather than a straight-forward mafia movie. Among the names which have been thrown around to play the Deadlock Don is none other than Professor Emeritus of James Franco Sciences, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110424063934/http://gothamist.com/tags/jamesfranco">James Franco</a>! But it seems Gotti Jr. isn&apos;t well-read on our favorite documentarian-intellectual-artfart-Oscar host:  &quot;<strong>To be honest, I&apos;m not familiar with James Franco or his work,&quot;</strong> Gotti <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110424063934/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/national/unwiseguy_on_franco_L5e30bleDC2ty42KZ4TwnI?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">told the Post</a>, adding that he had stepped back a bit from the project to let the producers and director move it forward. We hope he doesn&apos;t get freaked out that an actor who has starred in several prominent gay roles could play him...and do so <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110424063934/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/10/05/james-franco-in-drag-for-_n_751971.html">fabulously.</a></p>
