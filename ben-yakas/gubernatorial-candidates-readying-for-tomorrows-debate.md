<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="101710cuomodino.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412161733im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/101710cuomodino.jpg" width="250" height="151" class="image-left"> </span> All seven gubernatorial candidates are doing some <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412161733/http://gothamist.com/2010/10/14/paladino_debate.php">last minute cramming</a> today in anticipation of tomorrow&apos;s highly anticipated <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412161733/http://gothamist.com/2010/10/08/lets_meet_the_gubernatorial_candida.php">debate</a>. Experts are calling seasoned politician Andrew Cuomo the favorite, but one source told the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412161733/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/10/17/2010-10-17_victory_its_debatable_pros_give_andy_edge_in_tomorrows_faceoff.html">Daily News</a> that Carl Paladino has a chance to take back control of his campaign narrative: &quot;Carl has to come off as the candidate that he wants to be, <strong>not the candidate he&apos;s been transformed into by the Cuomo forces.&quot; </strong> We didn&apos;t realize that Cuomo&apos;s forces were to blame for Paladino&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412161733/http://gothamist.com/2010/10/10/paladino_homosexuality_not_an_equal.php">controversial remarks</a> on homosexuality, his endless stream of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412161733/http://gothamist.com/2010/10/14/more_paladino_emails_equals_paladin.php">embarrassing emails</a>, and his altercations with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412161733/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/30/video_paladino_gets_into_altercatio.php">reporters</a>.</p>

<p>Considering the altercations that have taken place and the tensions which have arisen in the race, debate organizers are playing it safe and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412161733/http://www.dnainfo.com/20101017/manhattan/fight-be-governor-could-turn-physical-debate-organizers-fear">stepping up security</a> for the event, just in case. We&apos;re just excited at the prospect of what Paladino might say on live TV; will he continue to slip in comments about Cuomo&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412161733/http://gothamist.com/2010/10/07/paladinos_tv_announcement_revealed.php">sexual prowess</a>? </p>

<p>Whatever he says at this point, he&apos;s bound to offend someone. He&apos;s now receiving flack over comments his campaign manager made <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412161733/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/29/paladino_advisor.php">weeks ago</a>, referring to the gubernatorial race as &quot;a campaign of junkyard dogs.&quot; &quot;<strong>Junkyard dogs live lives of misery and suffering. They&apos;re helpless, terrified, voiceless and defenseless</strong>,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412161733/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/animal_lover_dogs_carl_0GPf5xCWHbzJn4GiYBpfFM?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">said</a> an appalled Regina Massaro, director of the city&apos;s Spay-Neuter Intervention Project (SNIP), a partner of the ASPCA.</p>
