                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="5813bluth.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130807010828im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/5813bluth.jpeg" width="640" height="420"> <br> <i> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130807010828/https://twitter.com/arresteddev/status/332108771595808770">Arrested Development</a></i></div> <p></p>

<p>We&apos;ve been so elated about the new season <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130807010828/http://gothamist.com/tags/arresteddevelopment"><em>Arrested Development</em></a> and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130807010828/http://www.tmz.com/2013/05/06/david-cross-new-arrested-development-tears-laughter-diarrhea/">diarrhea-induing laughs</a> it promises to bring, we&apos;ve allowed ourselves to get comfortable with the idea of the show sticking around. That, in fact, is not a done deal at all&#x2014;based on what Netflix CEO Reed Hastings <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130807010828/http://variety.com/2013/digital/news/arrested-development-netflix-house-of-cards-1200471573/">said recently</a>, we probably should brace ourselves for crushing disappointment. But we&apos;re going to enjoy every bit of this while we can&#x2014;including the fact that the Bluth&apos;s Original Frozen Banana Stand is coming to NYC this month!</p>

<p>Netflix is launching the Bluth&#x2019;s Original Frozen Banana Stand Worldwide Tour today in London, as you can see above. And it will include special surprise appearances by the Bluth family and friends. It&apos;ll also be stopping in NYC and LA, probably closer to the release of the new episodes&#x2014;the banana stand&apos;s location will be revealed on the official Twitter account, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130807010828/https://twitter.com/arresteddev">@ArrestedDev.</a></p>

<p>From what we can tell, they are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130807010828/https://twitter.com/arresteddev/status/332120988068216833">making frozen bananas</a>&#x2014;which makes us really want to rip up the walls and see just how real it really is.</p>
