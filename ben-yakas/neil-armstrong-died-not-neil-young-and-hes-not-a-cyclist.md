<p>Astronaut <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427162451/http://gothamist.com/2012/08/25/astronaut_neil_armstrong_first_man.php">Neil Armstrong passed away</a> this afternoon at the age of 82&#x2014;but even the man who coined the phrase, &quot;That&apos;s one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind,&quot; is not immune to the confusion of the internet. To that end, NBC mistakenly wrote that astronaut Neil Young had died. And no, he&apos;s not the guy <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427162451/https://twitter.com/Rach_Withers/status/239448888501731328">who rides the bike.</a> </p>

<p>As far as we know, Neil Young is alive and well, and Lance Armstrong (the aforementioned biker) is still banned from cycling. Neil Armstrong also followed in the footsteps of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427162451/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/14/arcade_fire_1.php">Arcade Fire</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427162451/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/13/this_years_who_is_arcade_fire_who_i.php">Bon Iver</a>, as some Twitter users desperately tried to figure out who he was and why he was trending&#x2014;and other tweeters got angry about it.</p>
