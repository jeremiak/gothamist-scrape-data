<p>Miranda teamed up with Cecily Strong for the aforementioned SNL promos&#x2014;Strong happens to be the person who impersonated him (horrifying fake facial hair and all) last weekend during the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171030083657/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/02/video_larry_david_makes_triumphant.php"><em>Family Feud: Political Edition</em> sketch.</a> As you can see below, he clearly did not have any problem with that impression whatsoever.</p>

<p>Miranda seemed equally jazzed during his pre-SNL appearance on <em>The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon</em> last night, facing off with Tariq from The Roots in a freestyle rap battle royale. Watch as Miranda comes up with off-the-cuff rhymes about <em>Mr Robot</em>, Bronies, pop tarts and corn mazes.</p>

<p>Clearly he had a good time of it:</p>
