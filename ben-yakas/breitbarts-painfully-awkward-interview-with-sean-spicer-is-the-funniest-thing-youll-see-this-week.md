<p>The only silver lining&#x2014;and it is very much a sliver of a silver lining&#x2014;to Donald Trump&apos;s presidency so far has been the unyielding amount of buffoonery that has emanated from the White House over the past three weeks. Whether it&apos;s the embarrassing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021055741/http://gothamist.com/2017/02/08/president_mental_health_question.php">White House leaks</a>, arguments about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021055741/http://www.thewrap.com/trump-bathrobe/">bathrobes</a>, Kellyanne Conway&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021055741/http://gothamist.com/2017/02/10/video_seth_meyers_stephen_colbert_o.php">fashion flubs</a> or Trump&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021055741/http://gothamist.com/2017/02/06/trump_bannon_smart_in_charge.php">big boy tweets</a>, it almost seems like Trump&apos;s Minions have been trying to get fired. Either that, or they really enjoy getting <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021055741/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aRq1Ksh-32g">hit in the face with rakes.</a> </p>

<p>But the video below of press secretary and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021055741/http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/318385-report-trump-regrets-hiring-spicer-blames-priebus">Trump punching bag</a> Sean Spicer being interviewed by Trump propaganda site Breitbart has to take the cake for most painful and hilarious Trump Minion Moment Of The Week. </p>

<p>It&apos;s like one of those painfully awkward (and painfully funny) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021055741/http://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/video/super-champions/n45824?snl=1">Kyle Mooney SNL sketches</a> come to life. It&apos;s like Spicer sat down for an interview with a student reporter from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021055741/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_One_News">Channel One news.</a> It&apos;s like Chris Farley&apos;s &quot;Remember that time?&quot; interviewer got a full-time job at a white supremacist outlet.</p>
