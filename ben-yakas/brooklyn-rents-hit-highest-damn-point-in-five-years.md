<p>A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510022124/http://gothamist.com/tags/jimmymcmillan">wise philosopher and karate expert</a> once remarked that the rent is too damn high&#x2014;and year after year, that perceptive observation has only proven <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510022124/http://gothamist.com/tags/rent">more unassailable</a>. According to the latest report <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510022124/http://www.elliman.com/pdf/a6054175c7e95fc632655595bac933b7d386605c">[pdf]</a> by real estate firm Douglas Elliman, median rental prices in Brooklyn have reached the highest point in five years at $2,850. </p>

<p>For some perspective: the median rental price in Brooklyn was $2,850 in August, up from $2,546 in July 2012. The average rental price in August was $3,109, up from $3,035 in July, up from $2,806 at the same time last year. Thanks to the stability of surging rental prices, the number of new rentals increased over 166% over the last year, from 208 in August 2012 to 554 last month. Overall, the biggest increase was in two-bedroom apartments: the average rental price for those is now $3,506, compared to $2,728 a year ago.</p>

<p>If you&apos;re looking for some silver lining in all this data, take comfort that, um, average rental prices for studios in Brooklyn are at $2,072 now, compared to $2,136 in July. And housing is still more expensive in Manhattan (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510022124/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/08/skyrocketing_brooklyn_rents_close_i.php">although only barely</a> at this point). But hey, at least the current economy ensures that wealthy photographers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510022124/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/03/couple_spend_1_million_to_live_in_b.php">have to pay $1 million to move into a Bed-Stuy apartment</a> just to get a taste of the old school gritty LES feel!</p>
