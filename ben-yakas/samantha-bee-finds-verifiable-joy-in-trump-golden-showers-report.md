<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170925122240/http://gothamist.com/tags/samanthabee">Samantha Bee</a> returned from winter break on a new night and at a new time yesterday, and immediately jumped into the &quot;Comedy Christmas&quot; that was the past week in politics. &quot;The only verifiable thing about this report is how much joy it gave me,&quot; she said regarding <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170925122240/http://gothamist.com/2017/01/10/trump_russian_intelligence_blackmail.php">the Trump dossier</a>, which includes unverified allegations that Trump hired two prostitutes to pee on a bed in a Russian hotel room that the Obamas stayed in.</p>

<p>&quot;There&#x2019;s a high probability this story is bullshit, but the fact that it&#x2019;s &#x2018;plausible&#x2019; bullshit is a terrifying statement about what our nation has come to,&#x201D; Bee added. &quot;We absolutely believe that Donald Trump is petty enough to hire someone to take a whiz in a bed his predecessor sat in.&quot;</p>

<p>Bee moved past the &quot;Peeus Ex Machina&quot; to get into the confirmation hearings for Jefferson Beauregard Sessions III (&quot;No, that is not the name of a cartoon rooster from a banned Disney movie&quot;). &quot;Being too racially insensitive for 1986 is like being too into piss play for R. Kelly,&quot; she said. &quot;That joke was in the script <em>before</em> yesterday, thank you very much.&quot;</p>

<p>She also had a piece about &quot;white plight,&quot; focusing on complaints from D-list celebrities like Bo Bice, who was very upset after being referred to as &quot;white boy&quot; at a Popeyes. &quot;Do you know how I can tell this wasn&apos;t systemic racism oppressing you?&quot; Bee asked. &quot;Because you&apos;re 41-years-old and this seems to be the first time you&apos;re experiencing it.&quot;</p>
