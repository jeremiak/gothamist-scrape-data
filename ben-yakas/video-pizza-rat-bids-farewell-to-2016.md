<p>Did you really think we&apos;d be able to close the door on 2016 without <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508052304/http://gothamist.com/tags/pizzarat">Pizza Rat</a>, the worst rat in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508052304/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/26/the_best_rats_of_2015.php">New York City history</a>, making an unwelcome appearance? PR was spotted getting intimate with a slice of pizza on the subway tracks at Fulton Street this week. Whether or not this is the same Pizza Rat that stole <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508052304/http://gothamist.com/2015/09/21/pizza_rat.php">a-pizza our cold dead hearts last year</a>, who could know&#x2014;Zardulu can&apos;t possibly be everywhere, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508052304/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/07/journalism.php">can she?</a>  </p>

<p>Every time one of these videos pops up, I&apos;m left with the same questions: why doesn&apos;t it just eat the slice right there? Why is it trying to drag it away? Where is it even taking it? Do rats really care that much about their families/communities? Will it even realistically be able to get it back in one piece? Wouldn&apos;t a more modestly-sized piece of tasty garbage be easier to transport, in that case? And most importantly, why did Charlize Theron run <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508052304/https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/3yibg8/what_is_the_prometheus_school_of_running_away/">in a straight line</a> at the end of <em>Prometheus</em>? Why?!?!? [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508052304/https://www.reddit.com/r/nyc/comments/5l0xqi/pizza_rats_back/">h/t Reddit</a>]</p>
