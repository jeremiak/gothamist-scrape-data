<p>Oh sure, a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506162815/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/06/photos_video_banksys_enchanting_mob.php#photo-1">truck with a waterfall in the back</a> is enchanting and lovely and everything, but it&apos;ll disappear as soon as Banksy blows this continent in a few weeks. But a waterfall in your apartment is <em>forever</em>. And now is your chance to get in on one, if you happen to have $39 million or so lying around.</p>

<p>The Waterfall Mansion&#x2014;so named thanks to the standing 23-foot-high cascading waterfall and pond in it&#x2014;is back on the market, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506162815/http://nypost.com/2013/10/10/100m-penthouse-rising-near-united-nations/">according to the Post.</a> Located at 170 E. 80th Street on the Upper East Side, the 10,800-square-foot townhouse covers five floors, and also includes a gallery space, a garden off the master suite, and a 1,000-bottle wine cellar. </p>

<p>As <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506162815/http://ny.curbed.com/archives/2013/10/10/waterfall_mansion_returns_to_market_asking_39_million.php">Curbed notes</a>, it had gone down in price to as low as $27 million before being taken this past June. At these prices, you might be better off <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506162815/http://gawker.com/scottish-castles-are-cheaper-than-new-york-apartments-1227068903">investing a Scottish Castle</a>&#x2014;although who hasn&apos;t dreamed of living with a waterfall? Well, we suppose that depends on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506162815/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/11/interior_designer_poo-poos_her_livi.php">the kind of waterfall.</a></p>
