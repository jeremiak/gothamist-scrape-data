<p>Two children visiting NYC who were abducted from their relative&apos;s home in Brooklyn yesterday were found by the NYPD and members of the Hasidic Shomrim Patrol. The two 4-year-olds, a boy and a girl, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140429205942/http://jpupdates.com/2014/04/26/borough-park-alleged-kidnapping-two-shabbos-afternoon-suspect-arrest/">were reported missing</a> from their relative&apos;s apartment on 51st Street at around 4 p.m. Saturday. About an hour later, they were discovered thanks to the patrol, as you can see in the dashcam videos below.</p>

<p>The children, who were visiting from Israel and Switzerland for the Passover holidays, were returned safely. The suspect, 46-year-old Karen (Keren) Cohen, told police she had started talking to the kids while passing their apartment and they had asked to be taken to a nearby park. She <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140429205942/http://nypost.com/2014/04/27/woman-abducts-two-children-from-brooklyn-yard/">has been charged</a> with criminal trespassing and endangering the welfare of a child.</p>

<p>Last week, five members associated with the Williamsburg Safety Patrol Unit <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140429205942/http://gothamist.com/2014/04/23/four_arrested_in_williamsburg_beati.php">were arrested</a> in connection with the beating of a gay black man in Williamsburg last December. </p>
