<p>If there&apos;s anything we&apos;ve learned from <em>Parks And Recreation&apos;s</em> Andy Dwyer (besides what the ingredients are in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160719165612/http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Andy&apos;s%20Mouth%20Surprise">Andy&apos;s Mouth Surprise</a>), it&apos;s to appreciate the dying art form of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160719165612/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGUkc9ajgiU">the shoe shine</a>. But in the face of attacks by the likes of Big Sandal and Big Loafer, the wingtip business has hit the skids. Desperate times call for desperate measures&#x2014;so if personal pride in one&apos;s footwear isn&apos;t enough incentive to get your shoes waxed, maybe a bunch of scantily-clad young ladies will do the trick.</p>

<p>Introducing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160719165612/http://starshinenyc.com/">Star Shine NYC</a>, which answers the question: what if we combined the grit of old fashioned shoe shines with the barely legal enthusiasm of bikini car washes? &#x201C;We thought it could be a successful twist,&#x201D; 30-year-old co-owner Kevin White Jr. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160719165612/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20130411/financial-district/scantily-clad-ladies-spice-up-shoe-shines-at-new-financial-district-shop">told DNAInfo</a>. &#x201C;Finance guys are so busy and stressed, this is a chance to unwind and relax. It&#x2019;s definitely an upgraded shoe-shine experience.&#x201D;</p>

<p>The classy store, which opened three weeks ago on New Street, features large leather chairs and flat-screen TVs. They hope to serve classy beers and wines in the future. But the main attraction, of course, are the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160719165612/http://starshinenyc.com/star-shine-ladies">Star Shine Ladies</a>&#x2014;all the employees are women who wear little black shorts and tight tank tops.</p>

<p>And don&apos;t go thinking that those ladies are anything but totally professional: &#x201C;All the young ladies have undergone professional training &#x2014; this is an upscale place,&#x201D; White said. &#x201C;Many of the women are students or just out of college. Even my sister, a college student, is working there.&#x201D; </p>

<p>What does professional shoe shining training consist of? Who cares when you&apos;re a financial profession who needs a place to ogle women at 10 a.m. before the strip clubs open: &#x201C;They do a good job,&#x201D; one such Wall Streeter told DNAInfo, asking that his name not be used because his boss didn&#x2019;t know he was taking an early-morning break. &#x201C;And yes, it helps that they are very pretty &#x2014; but the prices are a little high if you don&#x2019;t get the discount.&#x201D;</p>
