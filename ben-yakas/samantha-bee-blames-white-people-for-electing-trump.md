<p>Seth Meyers tried to find <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170925125056/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/09/video_seth_meyers_trump.php">a hopeful note</a> to cling onto. Stephen Colbert went from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170925125056/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/09/video_stephen_colberts_election_spe.php">dumbstruck</a> to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170925125056/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/10/stephen_colbert_trump_sucks.php">depressed</a>. But <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170925125056/http://gothamist.com/tags/samanthabee">Samantha Bee</a> responded to Donald Trump winning the presidency by getting mad at the people who most deserve it&#x2014;white people. &quot;What we did was the democratic equivalent of installing an above-ground pool,&quot; she said on <em>Full Frontal</em> last night. &quot;Even if we&apos;re lucky and it doesn&apos;t seep into our foundation, the neighbors will never look at us the same way again.&quot;</p>

<p>Citing the demographic breakdown of the election, Bee fumed about the majority of white people who chose a vial of weaponized testosterone over the first female president: &quot;I don&apos;t want to hear a goddamn word about black voter turnout&#x2014; how many times do we expect black people to build our country for us?&quot; She added, &quot;Don&apos;t try to distance yourself from the bad apples and say, &apos;It&apos;s not my fault, I didn&apos;t vote for him, #notallwhitepeople,&apos; shush shush shush! If Muslims have to take responsibility for every member of their community so do we. And oh, that <em>does</em> feel awful.&quot;</p>

<p>Not that she didn&apos;t take a moment to soak in the despair of the election&#x2014;Bee showed a clip that clearly was meant to be a joyous victory lap in the event of Clinton&apos;s win, with cameos by Jon Stewart, Stephen Colbert and Larry Wilmore (among others). Instead, she turned the footage into &quot;a beautiful, faraway dream.&quot;</p>

<p>Bee did try to find some hope by sending out some of her correspondents on the day of the election to talk with voters on both sides of the aisle about the need for communication between Republicans and Democrats. At least they get one giant bearhug out of it.</p>

<p>Bee tried to find Trump&apos;s policy shop in an attempt to get <em>some</em> idea of what agenda Trump might push forward, and mostly learned that Trump is (surprise) a terrible boss.</p>
