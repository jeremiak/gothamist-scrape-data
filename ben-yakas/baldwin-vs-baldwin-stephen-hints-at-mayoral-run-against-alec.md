<p>A house of Baldwins divided against itself cannot stand: is born again actor Stephen Baldwin considering a mayoral run against his big brother Alec? The youngest (and in his own words, &quot;kookiest&quot;) of the Baldwin brothers said as much <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151017022615/http://www.prisonplanet.com/stephen-baldwin-may-run-against-alec-baldwin-for-nyc-mayor.html">in an interview with</a> conservative talk-show host Alex Jones at the Talkers New Media Conference. He even asked Jones to be his campaign manager: &quot;If it looks like Alec is going to run for mayor for sure, and it looks like he&apos;s getting some traction, you and I will circle back, you have to help me raise the money, <strong>and maybe we&apos;ll go head to head with big brother</strong>.&quot;</p>

<p>Even so, the <em>Bio-Dome</em> star was realistic about his chances&#x2014;&quot;I&apos;d say Alec probably has an edge on me in NY.&quot; That might be because he is a self-proclaimed &quot;jesus freak evangelical charismatic born again conservative independent,&quot; which doesn&apos;t trend very well here. But he <em>is</em> quite nice to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151017022615/http://gothamist.com/2009/07/09/stephen_baldwins_house_guest_arrest.php">sketchy homeless people</a>! </p>

<p>There was also this, uh, quote: &quot;New York is a funky place brother. It&apos;s got a lot of people, lot of opinions, it&apos;s a melting pot, they&apos;re from all over, and they want what they want.<strong> It ain&apos;t easy being Stevie B in NYC.&quot;</strong> If <em>The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas</em> hasn&apos;t already endeared New Yorkers to him forever, then that quote will undoubtedly do the trick.</p>

<p>You can check out the full interview below, including our favorite part (around the 5:00 minute mark) where Stephen pulls out a pitch perfect Alec impression. Last week, friends of the elder Baldwin <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151017022615/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/08/will_alec_baldwin_go_from_30_rock_t.php">dished that</a> he was seriously interested in a mayoral run in 2013. Mayor Bloomberg just wants those pesky Baldwins to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151017022615/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/11/mayor_bloomberg_is_warily_supportiv.php">stay off his lawn</a>: &quot;I only want him to stay out of my business for the next 935 days. For the record, I do not plan to go into his business.&quot;</p>
