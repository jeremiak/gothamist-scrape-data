<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406143524/http://gothamist.com/tags/jets">Jets</a> tight end Kellen Winslow was arrested last November for smoking <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406143524/http://gothamist.com/tags/syntheticmarijuana">synthetic marijuana</a> outside a Target in East Hanover. But that was just the tip of the iceberg: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406143524/http://www.nj.com/jets/index.ssf/2014/01/witness_told_police_jets_tight_end_kellen_winslow_jr_was_masturbating_in_his_car.html#incart_river">according to NJ.com</a>, cops were initially called to the scene on Nov. 19 at 5:30 p.m. because a witness thought she saw Winslow masturbating in his vehicle in the parking lot. And Winslow tried to use the old &quot;looking for Boston Market but was lost&quot; excuse.</p>

<p>Here&apos;s what the witness who called 911 told police happened when she spotted Winslow sitting inside his Escalade with the window open, according to the police report:</p>

<blockquote>As she exited her vehicle, she commented to the male regarding how cold it was. As she stood near the open driver side window of the Escalade, she observed the males [sic] erect penis. She stated that she believed he was masturbating. [The woman] provided a written statement regarding her account.</blockquote>

<p>When an officer arrived, Winslow was allegedly &quot;slouched in his seat and moving around.&quot; When asked what he was doing, Winslow allegedly said he was looking for Boston Market but was lost. Cops then noticed &quot;two open containers of Vaseline on his center console&quot; and plastic bags marked &apos;Mr. Happy&apos; and empty plastic containers of &apos;Funky Monkey&apos; scattered in the car.</p>

<p>&quot;He stated that he smokes the &apos;legal&apos; synthetic marijuana to help him relax,&quot; the police report said. &quot;He said he purchases the items via the Internet and at local gas stations. He added that the NFL does not test for synthetic marijuana.&quot; Winslow has pleaded not guilty to possession of a controlled dangerous substance.</p>

<p>As for the vaseline/masturbation allegations, his spokesperson <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406143524/http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/football/jets/police-report-jets-winslow-caught-masturbating-cadillac-article-1.1582947">released a statement</a> denying everything except Winston&apos;s American born freedom to smoke the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406143524/http://gothamist.com/tags/syntheticmarijuana">manufactured version of the devil&apos;s weed</a>: &quot;Kellen pulled over to a parking lot to smoke what he thought at the time was a legal substance,&quot; Denise White said today. &quot;He changed his clothes in his vehicle as to not smell like smoke when he returned home.&quot; Because who doesn&apos;t change their clothes in their car after they smoke? Really, we&apos;re asking. Is that something people do?</p>
