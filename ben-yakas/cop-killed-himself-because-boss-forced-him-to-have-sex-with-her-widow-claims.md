<p>A new lawsuit by the widow of an NYPD officer who died last year claims the Queens cop committed suicide because his commanding officer forced him to have sex with her for a favorable work schedule. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130403091049/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20130130/jackson-heights/nypd-cops-widow-says-husband-driven-suicide-by-boss-sexual-advances">According to</a> widow Gina Schindler, her late husband officer Matthew Schindler &quot;was made to understand that he would suffer tangible detriment in his job, job assignments, work conditions and future prospects if he did not submit to the sexual advances and demands of&quot; Sgt. Christine Hertzel.</p>

<p>Schindler, who has been on the force since 1997, worked at the 115th precinct in Jackson Heights from March 2011 until his death on Feb 13, 2012. The lawsuit claims he &quot;realized and/or believed he could not escape the continuing sexual advances and demands of Hertzel.&quot; His widow says he became despondent and depressed over the situation, which led him to confront Hertzel the day he committed suicide, telling her the sexual advances were &quot;unwanted, repugnant and causing him psychic injury and suffering.&quot; He allegedly said he would kill himself over the &quot;guilt&quot; if the affair didn&apos;t stop. </p>

<p>Hertzel then allegedly told a precinct captain about the sexual relationship and Schindler&apos;s threats. The captain tried to call Schindler &quot;to rectify the hostile work environment and persuade him against suicide,&quot; the lawsuit says. The father of three shot himself in his car about 4:30 p.m. that day after pulling over to the side of the Long Island Expressway.</p>

<p>Schindler&apos;s widow is suing the city, the NYPD and Hertzel for violating her husband&apos;s civil rights. A Law Department spokesman told us, &quot;We are reviewing the claims.&quot; <br>
