<p>Last week, the city collectively held it in&#x2014;<em>in terror</em>&#x2014;as we all confronted the prospect of Starbucks&apos; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111124054759/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/16/toilet_tragedy_starbucks_has_begun.php">closing their restrooms to the public</a>. The company adamantly claimed reports of Starbucks&apos; converting toilets to employee-only use were greatly exaggerated. Now, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111124054759/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/23/nyregion/starbucks-mutiny-exposes-new-yorks-reliance-on-chains-toilets.html?_r=1&amp;partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">NY Times reveals that</a> the <em>Starbucks Pee Panic of 2011</em> was spurred by mini-insurrections at certain Starbucks locations, and indeed not any widespread city policy shift. And it seems Starbucks acted quick to end the speculation: &quot;Within days...higher-ups from Starbucks management visited at least two offending shops and ordered them to liberate their restrooms.&quot;</p>

<p>According to the initial reports, the bathrooms were being closed to the public mainly because employees were being forced to wait on lines for restrooms. As a result, the Starbucks on 45th Street and Sixth Avenue made their bathroom employees-only; two others, at Spring Street and at 67th Street and Columbus Avenue, reduced their restrooms from two to one. </p>

<p>Employees complained that they had been forced to become untrained janitors amongst inhumane conditions, in addition to their other responsibilities: &#x201C;I have personally cleaned up almost every humanly fluid and plenty that didn&#x2019;t seem human,&#x201D; one employee wrote on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111124054759/http://starbucksgossip.typepad.com/_/2011/11/a-new-york-times-reporter-wants-to-hear-from-you-about-the-bathroom-brouhaha.html">Jim Romenesko&apos;s Starbucks Gossip blog</a>, where the Times sought out former and current employees takes on the crisis.</p>

<p>But the stores which acted upon these anti-public restroom urges were acting on their own it seems&#x2014;and now, because of the controversy they sparked, they&apos;ve been scolded and things have been set back to the way they were. There was a bare patch on the bathroom door at the 45th Street location where the &quot;Employees Only&quot; sign was removed: &#x201C;We had been using it as a locker room,&#x201D; one employee told the Times, adding that the restroom had been closed because a small number of inconsiderate patrons had repeatedly broken the toilet.</p>

<p>However, this doesn&apos;t mean that stores couldn&apos;t put in bathroom monitors, a plan which had been discussed internally by at least one branch&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111124054759/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/18/starbucks_toilets_future_bathroom_a.php">Starbucks told us that</a> adding employees &quot;is up to the management of the store and their district manager. What role that additional team member would play&quot; is an internal decision. At least we can all breathe a sigh of relief knowing the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111124054759/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/27/man_vows_to_masturbate_in_every_sta.php">Starbucks masturbator</a> may yet achieve his dreams.</p>
