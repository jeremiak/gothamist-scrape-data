<p>We&apos;ve already compiled a list of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160325073719/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/28/the_top_10_biggest_subway_videos_of.php">our top ten favorite subway viral videos of 2012</a>, which included teens licking subway railings, straphangers screaming &quot;Thriller,&quot; potato chip peacemakers and people stupidly goofing around on the tracks. But that only scratched the surface of bizarre subway behaviors&#x2014;so below, we&apos;ve compiled the rest of the best subway moments (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160325073719/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/01/subway_viral_videos_honorable_menti.php">like we did last year</a>)&#x2014;from pet rats to breakdancer rants, from blowjobs to topless protesters, from sleep standing to shaman dancing.</p>

<p><strong>The Sounds Of The Subway</strong>: There&apos;s a very thin line between beautiful and creepy, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160325073719/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/20/video_the_nyc_subway.php">this video</a> had no problem walking along it.</p>

<p><strong>Going Down While Headed Uptown</strong>: Yes, we came across footage of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160325073719/http://gothamist.com/2012/11/30/two_young_ladies_filmed_giving_thei.php">two young ladies fellating two gentlemen on the 6 train</a>. No, we&apos;re not going to embed the video below. Yes, you can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160325073719/http://www.worldstaruncut.com/uncut/53051">see it here</a> if you must.</p>

<p><strong>Breakdancers Rant</strong>: An angry woman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160325073719/http://gothamist.com/2012/11/21/video_this_angry_woman_screams_for.php">screamed on behalf of all New Yorkers</a> who have been stuck on a crowded subway car with breakdancers.</p>

<p><strong>Vigilante Subway Justice</strong>: Sometimes, New Yorkers get fed up with all the subway <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160325073719/http://gothamist.com/tags/pervs">pervs</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160325073719/http://gothamist.com/tags/groping">gropers</a> taking advantage of straphangers. In <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160325073719/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/14/video_straphangers_work_together_to.php">this inspirational video</a>, several riders band together to help a woman who says she was groped, holding the alleged groper until the police arrived to arrest him.</p>

<p><strong>Bedford Ave L Platform Dance Party</strong>: For the most part, subway platform dancing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160325073719/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/08/couple_arrested_for_dancing_on_subw.php">is frowned upon</a>&#x2014;except when <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160325073719/http://gothamist.com/2012/08/27/oh_just_another_night_on_the_bedfor.php">everyone starts singing</a> &quot;I Wanna Dance With Somebody&quot; at the Bedford Avenue L stop.</p>

<p><strong>Bare Feet On The Pole</strong>: Yes, it isn&apos;t as bad as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160325073719/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/15/video_man_licks_shoe_on_subway.php">furiously licking your shoe</a>&#x2014;but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160325073719/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/13/video_subway_rider_removes_shoes_an.php">rubbing your bare feet</a> against the subway pole is actually more harmful to other people.</p>

<p><strong>Topless Protester</strong>: As far as we know, it&apos;s a very rare subway sighting&#x2014;how many <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160325073719/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/01/nsfw_photo_topless_lady_spotted_on.php">nekked people</a> did you see on the subway this year (...not including <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160325073719/http://gothamist.com/tags/hollyvanvoast">Holly Van Voast</a>)?</p>
