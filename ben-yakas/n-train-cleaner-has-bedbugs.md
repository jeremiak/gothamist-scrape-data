<p>We&apos;ve been given a brief respite from the Bedbug Wars of 2014: the MTA tells us they have found no bedbugs on any 7 train after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150214071648/http://gothamist.com/2014/08/13/bedbugs_7_train.php">one passenger reported seeing creepy crawlies salivating at the sight of human flesh yesterday.</a> But that doesn&apos;t mean things are going so well for the victims of the first wave of attacks: an MTA cleaner <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150214071648/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/queens/mta-worker-finds-bedbugs-hom-article-1.1902646">complained to the Daily News today</a> about how she contracted bedbugs from one of the infected N trains, and now the MTA won&apos;t pay to fumigate her house. &#x201C;They&#x2019;re all over me,&quot; the 54-year-old grandmother told them. &quot;They&#x2019;re all over my clothes and the MTA isn&#x2019;t doing a damn thing.&quot;</p>

<p>The woman, a six-year MTA veteran who asked to remain anonymous, continued: &quot;I asked them for help and they told me to call my landlord, but I don&#x2019;t want him to know. I can&#x2019;t even go back to work because I&#x2019;ll be bringing them back with me and I like the people I&#x2019;m working with.&quot; Bedbugs were found on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150214071648/http://gothamist.com/2014/08/07/bedbugs_n_train_subway.php">at least three</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150214071648/http://gothamist.com/2014/08/06/bed_bugs_on_the_n_train.php">N train</a> cars last week; there were also reports of bedbugs on a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150214071648/http://gothamist.com/2014/08/09/5_train_taken_out_of_service_becaus.php">5 train and a 4 train.</a></p>

<p>The cleaner said the MTA has fumigated an employee locker room at the Ditmars Blvd. station, where she works, but refuses to do her home: &quot;We cannot fumigate property that does not belong to us,&quot; an MTA spokesman told the News. The Department of Health and Mental Hygiene <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150214071648/http://www.nyc.gov/html/doh/bedbugs/html/home/home.shtml">has lots of information about</a> tenant&apos;s rights when it comes to bedbugs, including a list [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150214071648/http://www.nyc.gov/html/doh/bedbugs/downloads/pdf/choosing-pmp.pdf">PDF</a>] of pest control companies. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150214071648/http://www.nyc.gov/html/doh/bedbugs/html/info/owners_tenants.shtml">For starters</a>, landlords are legally required to &quot;eradicate the infestation and keep the affected units from getting reinfested.&quot; And you can&apos;t legally be evicted for having bedbugs.</p>

<p>The cleaner says the bedbugs are already ruining her life, as they do, preventing her from attending her granddaughter&apos;s 7th birthday party. &quot;My daughter felt bad, she didn&#x2019;t want to say it, so I had to &#x2014; she preferred that I not come to the party,&quot; she said. &quot;So I&#x2019;m going to miss out.&quot; Bedbugs: tearing families apart since the dawn of blood.</p>
