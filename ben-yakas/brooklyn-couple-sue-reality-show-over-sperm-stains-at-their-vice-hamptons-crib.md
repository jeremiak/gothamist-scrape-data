                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="32013vice.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130813082132im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/32013vice.jpeg" width="640" height="424"> <br> <i> A Vice Productions party from last summer(<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130813082132/http://www.facebook.com/ViceProductions">via Facebook</a>)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>The Hamptons is really earning <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130813082132/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/17/ny_times_blows_this_drunk_train_to.php">its reputation</a> for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130813082132/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/08/25-year-old_businessman_allegedly_u.php">throwing ragers</a>&#x2014;a Brooklyn couple is suing reality TV producers who they say trashed their East Hamptons home during several boozy, sexy parties last summer. Among other things, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130813082132/http://www.courthousenews.com/2013/03/18/55801.htm">according to Susan and Stuart Silverman&apos;s lawsuit</a>, &quot;a very expensive couch has to be replaced, because, despite the Silvermans&apos; best effort to clean it, there were sperm stains that could not be removed.&quot; They should have just brought in Larry David to handle this one.</p>

<p>The Silvemans claim they rented their summer place to Joshua Blackman, owner of Vice Energy LLC,  and Philip Dade, who runs <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130813082132/http://www.facebook.com/ViceProductions">Vice Production</a>&#x2014;they say Dade told them he wanted to rent the home for &quot;a family barbecue.&quot; But in reality, the two used the house as a setting for &quot;pArty of 5,&quot; a reality show that features five days of partying in different cities around the world. The two allegedly threw parties at the home on June 9, 16, and 23, and posted photos online of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130813082132/http://www.facebook.com/pages/Vice-Hamptons-Crib/437631546262152?id=437631546262152&amp;sk=page_map">&quot;Vice Hamptons Crib&quot;</a> with &quot;women in various stages of undress.&quot;</p>

<p>After neighbors complained, the Silvermans returned home on June 23rd to find &quot;about 50 cars in the road, security guards checking IDs ... and at least 100 persons all over their yard.&quot; The couple claims the defendants did $20,000 worth of damage, including the aforementioned sperm stain, broken door handles and fixtures, and missing silverware.</p>

<p>But even worse is what this has done to their reputation: &quot;As a result of these connections, the Silvermans are now viewed by the members of the community as running a <strong>house of ill repute</strong>.&quot; Which, incidentally, could make for a great title for a porn parody of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130813082132/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/04/house_of_cards.php"><em>House of Cards</em>.</a></p>
