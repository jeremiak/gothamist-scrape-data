<p><em>Thor</em> has always been the runt of the Marvel solo films (okay, technically speaking, Ant-Man is the runt, but everyone knows <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170419031544/http://gothamist.com/tags/ant-man">Ant-Man</a> is the most awesomely adequate superhero in the MCU). His first film was a decent if somewhat unmemorable showcase for Chris Hemsworth&apos;s comedic timing (with a Shakespearean-bent, because of course you would go there, Kenneth Branagh), and literally no one remembers anything about <em>Thor: The Dark World</em> (something something holes?). But that&apos;s all about to change, because Marvel has handed over the third installment in the franchise, <em>Thor: Ragnarok</em>, to the wonderful, quirky director Taika Waititi (<em>What We Do In The Shadows</em>) who has turned this ambling series into a full-on &apos;80s buddy comedy/gladiatorial disaster film. </p>

<p>The teaser trailer is filled with delightful moments, like Thor breaking the third wall <em>a la </em>Waititi&apos;s documentary-style <em>Shadows</em>. There&apos;s also Cate Blanchett with a goth dye job decimating Asgard (and disintegrating Thor&apos;s trusty hammer, Mjolnir); the throwback &apos;80s-influenced graphics; Jeff Goldblum being delightful as a colorful weirdo; a quick shot of Loki, who looks like he&apos;s grown a mullet; and best of all, Thor and Hulk meeting in the gladiator ring: &quot;Yes!! We know each other. He&apos;s a friend from work!&quot; And to top it off, the whole thing is soundtracked Led Zeppelin&apos;s immortal &quot;Immigrant Song.&quot;</p>

<p><em>Thor: Ragnarok: The Thor Movie We&apos;re Excited About Seeing: Gladiator Bros Unite!</em> will be released on November 3rd.  </p>
