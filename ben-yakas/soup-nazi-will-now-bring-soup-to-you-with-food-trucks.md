<p>The so-called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425173121/http://gothamist.com/tags/soupnazi">Soup Nazi</a>&#x2014;aka original SoupMan Al Yeganeh&#x2014;is a NYC legend thanks in part to the depiction of him in a classic <em>Seinfeld</em> episode. But considering the fact that Yeganeh became famous for his totalitarian views on soup distribution, we&apos;re somewhat surprised to learn that he has given approval to roll out a fleet of franchised Original SoupMan food trucks that will literally bring the soup to you, no questions asked.</p>

<p><iframe width="640" height="480" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425173121if_/http://www.youtube.com/embed/M2lfZg-apSA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425173121/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/soup_nazi_on_roll_Id4WW75P0eflqXE3ytsiWJ">According to the Post</a>, the company is hoping to roll out 80-100 soup trucks across the country by next year; the rights to each truck costs $15K, but it&apos;ll cost another $85K to lease the vehicle, which has Yeganeh&apos;s face plastered on it. And really, what would be the point of having an Original SoupMan truck without that?</p>

<p>Even though he&apos;s not officially in charge anymore, Yeganeh is still the mustachioed soul behind the business: &#x201C;He makes all the soups. He&#x2019;s a soup genius,&#x201D; said Lloyd Sugarman, the company&#x2019;s CEO. &#x201C;There&#x2019;s nothing that comes in without his approval. He&#x2019;s still very protective of his recipes. He gets the royalties on all soups...and makes money on every box of soup sold in stores.&#x201D; </p>

<p>Well, looks like someone is going to need a new catchphrase.</p>
