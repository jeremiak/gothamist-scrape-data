<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="62311bus.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811141738im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/62311bus.jpg" width="300" height="199" class="image-left"> </span>On Tuesday, a Bronx teen flew off the handle and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811141738/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/22/teen_flies_into_rage_when_bus_drive.php">beat up a bus driver</a> who wouldn&apos;t allow her to get on board with her dog. Driver Marlene Bien-Aime was hospitalized with a black eye, facial cuts, and chest injuries, while 17-year-old Steangeli Medina was charged with assault, menacing and harassment. Now, Bien-Aime is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811141738/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2011/06/22/2011-06-22_bus_driver_recalls_horror_of_beating_at_the_hands_of_17yearold_girl_whose_dog_no.html">talking about the attack</a>, and what can be done to protect bus drivers in the future: &quot;She punched me in my eyes while I was sitting. She hit me several times in my eyes. She hit me all over my head and on my back.&quot; Watch the video below:</p>

<p>Medina boarded the Bx9 bus on Fordham Road in Belmont just before 6 p.m. on Tuesday, with her Chihuahua under her arm&#x2014;Bien-Aime told her that the pet had to be in a kennel or crate to travel, which enraged Medina. &quot;She said, &apos;I&apos;m gonna hit you,&apos;&quot; Bien-Aime said. The driver responded, &quot;It&apos;s not me, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811141738/http://mta-nyc.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/mta_nyc.cfg/php/enduser/std_adp.php?p_faqid=514&amp;p_created=1054149029&amp;p_sid=6Z4vp9Ti&amp;p_lva=516&amp;p_sp=cF9zcmNoPTEmcF9zb3J0X2J5PSZwX2dyaWRzb3J0PSZwX3Jvd19jbnQ9MyZwX3Byb2RfbHZsMT0mcF9wcm9kX2x2bDI9JnBfcGFnZT0xJnBfc2VhcmNoX3RleHQ9cGV0cw**&amp;p_li=">it&apos;s MTA.&quot;</a></p>

<p>Medina dragged Bien-Aime out of the car, pulling her hair and punching her repeatedly. It left her with a badly swollen black eye, a large bruise on her upper left arm, a broken nose, and head and neck pain. Officials from the MTA <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811141738/http://www.ny1.com/content/top_stories/141504/battered-bus-driver-speaks-out-as-union-calls-for-more-protection">told NY1</a> that 29 drivers have been assaulted so far this year&#x2014;which does not include spitting as an assault. Union members say they have been pushing for a protective shield that would be installed between drivers and their passengers, but &quot;The MTA is still dragging its feet on the implementation of protective shields for New York City bus operators,&quot; according Transport Workers Union President John Samuelsen.</p>
