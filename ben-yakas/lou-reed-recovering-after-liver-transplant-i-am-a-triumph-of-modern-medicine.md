<p>Well this is disconcerting: during an interview <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131007004116/http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/arts/music/article3778630.ece">with The London Times</a>, Laurie Anderson revealed that husband <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131007004116/http://gothamist.com/tags/loureed">Lou Reed</a> has recently undergone a life-saving liver transplant. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s as serious as it gets,&#x201D; she told them. &#x201C;He was dying. You don&#x2019;t get it for fun.&#x201D; Reed, 71, put a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131007004116/https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151685319465953&amp;l=c398545eb9">statement on Facebook</a> proving he&apos;s still got his wits about him: &quot;I am a triumph of modern medicine, physics and chemistry. I am bigger and stronger than stronger than ever.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My Chen Taiji and health regimen has served me well all of these years, thanks to Master Ren Guang-yi,&quot; he added. &quot;I look forward to being on stage performing, and writing more songs to connect with your hearts and spirits and the universe well into the future.&quot; Anderson gave more details about why Reed decided to have the surgery at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio instead of in New York: it was &#x201C;because the hospitals here are completely dysfunctional.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Reed is recovering now, &quot;already working and doing t&apos;ai chi,&quot; but Anderson was realistic about how such a major surgery will affect him: &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t think he&#x2019;ll ever totally recover from this, but he&#x2019;ll certainly be back to doing [things] in a few months,&#x201D; she told The Times. Here&apos;s hoping that Reed gets back to being the intimidatingly cranky rock god we all know and love, able to terrify journalists with every utterance, as soon as possible!</p>
