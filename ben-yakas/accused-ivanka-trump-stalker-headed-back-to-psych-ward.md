Today, a judge <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161214094002/http://www.nydailynews.com/gossip/2011/05/12/2011-05-12_ivanka_trumps_accused_stalker_justin_massler_ordered_back_to_psychiatric_ward_fo.html">ruled that</a> Massler is indeed unfit to stand trial, thanks to both the psychiatric evaluation as well as this statement he made in court: &quot;<strong>The psychiatric system was corrupt. I feel that I was under some supernatural influence and that aliens could have been involved.</strong> Is there a doctor who will agree with me?&quot;<p></p>

<p>The judge sent Massler to Bellevue Hospital&apos;s psychiatric ward for one year; Massler, who is a diagnosed schizophrenic, has spent some time in psych wards in the past. Earlier this year, he told us a bit about those experiences, about how he was working on a book on psych wards, and his perspective on why he didn&apos;t belong there:</p>

<blockquote>The problem is, prior to this Ivanka Trump Stalking Act, I was also working on a book project about psych wards, and I got myself thrown in a bunch of psych wards intentionally to do research for the book. So as a result, I have like a long history of being in different psych wards, but it&apos;s all just you know, book research, like Joaquin Phoenix when he flipped out on Dave Letterman, and it turned out to be a documentary.
 
And then you know I did the whole King of the Jews routine [as part of his &quot;fake stalker thing,&quot; Massler wrote to Trump that he was &quot;like the Jewish Messiah&quot;] in a psych ward, and they diagnosed me as schizophrenic: that&apos;s actually why I got that diagnosis, because the psychiatrist is like, &quot;What do you do?&quot;
 
And I&apos;m like, &quot;Oh basically, I&apos;m the King of Israel, just working on a mission to bring peace to the Middle East with God&apos;s help, also thinking of traveling to Mars later,&quot; and then he writes, &quot;The subject is delusional, believing himself to be the King of the Jews and a Space Captain.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>Massler is charged with criminal contempt for stalking Ivanka Trump, which carries up to four years in prison. He was initially charged with misdemeanors, but it was raised to felonies after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161214094002/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/23/accused_trump_stalker_denied_bail_o.php">he violated</a> an order of protection by trying to contact the Trump family earlier this year. &quot;It&apos;s unfortunate that someone who had so much promise growing up would be affected by mental illness this way, and cause him to deteriorate to this level,&quot; his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161214094002/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/ivanka_trump_stalker_deemed_unfit_In5a82dnc0Ytmwum0oINEJ">lawyer said</a>.</p>
