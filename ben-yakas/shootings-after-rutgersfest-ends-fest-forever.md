<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150924223336/http://gothamist.com/tags/rutgers">Rutgers University</a> inspired a Bronzer-tinged outcry after they paid Snooki of <em>This Jersey Shore Life</em> an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150924223336/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/01/snooki_gets_paid_more_than_toni_mor.php">absurd amount of money</a> to come fist pump and shotgun education at the school. Amazingly, this was just one of several low points leading up to the chaotic celebration that is Rutgersfest: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150924223336/http://www.myfoxny.com/dpp/news/violence-near-rutgers-campus-20110416-lgf">11 people were arrested and four people</a> were shot over the course of the one day event. And now, the school&#x2019;s president has sent out an email saying Rutgersfest has been permanently cancelled.</p>

<p>&quot;The safety of our university community, and that of our neighbors, is paramount, and we cannot risk further danger or the possible loss of life. The problems that occur following Rutgersfest have grown beyond our capacity to manage them, and the only responsible course of action is to cancel the event,&quot; wrote Rutgers President Richard McCormick in an email to the campus community <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150924223336/http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2011/04/rutgers_to_cancel_annual_rutge.html">late yesterday</a>, explaining why it was necessary to shelve the 30-year-old festival. An estimated 40,000 to 50,000 people attended the free event, including many high school and college students from other schools. Besides Snooki, there were boardwalk style carnival games, food booths and a concert featuring hip-hop artists Pitbull and Yelawolf and electronic-pop act 3OH!3.</p>

<p>During Snooki&apos;s prior appearance, for which she was paid $32,000, she did a question-and-answer session, gave lessons in the Jersey Shore fist pump, and styled a student&apos;s hair to look like hers. According <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150924223336/http://www.cliffviewpilot.com/beyond/2282-students-shouldnt-have-to-pay-for-snooki-rutgersfest-if-they-dont-want-to-nj-lawmaker-says">to reports</a>, she also &quot;gave a shout out to her father, who was in the audience wearing a sleeveless &apos;Papa Snooki&apos; t-shirt, then instructed the howling students to &apos;study hard, but party harder.&apos;&quot; In response, State Sen. Joe Kyrillos <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150924223336/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/08/snooki_6.php">has proposed</a> legislation to &quot;increase transparency and choice for students in student fees assessed by public universities.&quot;</p>

<p>Not that they&apos;ll necessarily get a chance to implement it with Rutgersfest now. Pete Mangarella, New Brunswick&#x2019;s police director, called the free event &quot;the worst thing of the year for the city of New Brunswick.&quot; Fights broke out during the event (you can see one particularly raunchy one below), and spilled into the city late at night after the event had finished. The injured teenagers, who were all male, included an 18-year-old who was shot once in each leg, a 19-year-old shot twice <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150924223336/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/16/extra_extra_1923.php">in the buttocks</a> and another man grazed by a bullet on his hip. Two 17-year-olds were also hospitalized, one for a gunshot wound to the hip and another after being hit in the head with a bottle.</p>

<p>We can&apos;t wait to hear about the outraged student protests to this great injustice, especially since this is depriving the students a chance to hear reality teen mom <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150924223336/http://www.tmz.com/2011/03/25/teen-mom-2-jenelle-evans-catfight-video-footage-britany-truett-fist-brawl/">Jenelle Evans</a> talk about contraception usage at next year&apos;s event. Rutgersfest organizers insist they shouldn&apos;t have to take the fall for the violence, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150924223336/http://www.dailytargum.com/news/four-shootings-follow-rutgersfest-activities-1.2545099">and ask the world</a>, &quot;Did you see us handing out Four Lokos in our crew shirts as [students] got off the bus?&quot;</p>
