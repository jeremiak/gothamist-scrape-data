<p>For 17 years, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150307062853/http://gothamist.com/tags/cicadas">the Brood II cicadas</a> have been dormant underground, patiently biding their time while Daft Punk took over the world. Now that the humans have become distracted with their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150307062853/http://gothamist.com/tags/citibike">bike sharing</a> and their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150307062853/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/17/deja_vu_beyonce_is_reportedly_pregn.php">pregnant Beyonc&#xE9;s</a>, it is finally time for billions of them to emerge and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150307062853/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/17/when_can_we_feast_on_cicadas.php">become our entrees.</a> And today in Virginia, we had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150307062853/http://ireport.cnn.com/docs/DOC-972997">the first sightings</a> of the horny giant insects, as you can see in the gross video below. Moments like this, we&apos;re actually glad we don&apos;t have a backyard to serve as an unofficial sex pit.</p>

<p>We still don&apos;t know exactly when the cicadas will emerge around these parts, although <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150307062853/http://www.nj.com/hunterdon-county-democrat/index.ssf/2013/05/magicidada_coming_to_new_jerse.html">The Star-Ledger reports that</a> it should be around Memorial Day Weekend (at least in NJ). You can track them <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150307062853/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/06/this_interactive_cicada_map_will_he.php">here with the Swarmaggedon map.</a></p>

<p>But an important thing to keep in mind: even though cicadas are not harmful for crazy insect-loving humans to devour, it&apos;s not good for pets to eat their leftover exoskeletons (of which there will literally be BILLIONS littered across the East Coast). &quot;Imagine a yard full of chicken nuggets &#x2014; that&apos;s sort of what it&apos;s going to be like,&quot; Randall Lockwood, a Humane Society vice president and animal behaviorist <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150307062853/http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/health/2004-04-28-cicadas-pets_x.htm">told USA Today.</a> If you want to know what that looks like, just consult the handy freaky gif (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150307062853/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Cicada_molting_animated-2.gif">via Wiki</a>) below:</p>
