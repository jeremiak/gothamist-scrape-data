<p>NYC programmer and self-proclaimed entrepreneur <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509000321/http://www.aggressiveimagination.com/">Patrick McConlogue</a> caused a bit of a stir on a slow Wednesday when <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509000321/https://medium.com/architecting-a-life/fee8f3ee97a0">he wrote about his plans</a> to offer a random homeless person $100 or the opportunity to learn how to code. Reactions to the 23-year-old McConlogue&apos;s post were swift and mostly negative: it was called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509000321/http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2013/08/techie-offers-coding-lessons-to-homeless-guy.html">&quot;a truly ill-conceived social experiment,&quot;</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509000321/http://valleywag.gawker.com/nyc-programmer-turns-homeless-man-into-startup-experime-1178563424">&quot;degrading and horrible,&quot;</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509000321/http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/08/21/give-a-man-a-fish-and-hell-eat-for-a-day-offer-to-teach-a-man-to-code-and-youre-kind-of-a-jerk/">&quot;ham-handed.&quot;</a> Despite the naysayers, McConlogue <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509000321/https://medium.com/architecting-a-life/ae059ddffd2e">went through with the experiment today</a>&#x2014;and while he may not have solved the homeless crisis, he did confirm that Leo the &quot;Journeyman Hacker&quot; is a real person with interests in &quot;efficient public transportation initiatives.&quot; </p>

<p>McConlogue told us yesterday his inbox was jammed with hundreds of positive and negative reactions to the post. &quot;To me, I don&apos;t like to complicate things,&quot; he wrote us. &quot;Either I walk by him tomorrow and ignore him, or I make the offer. I choose to offer.&quot; He did of course walk by him, and promises he&apos;ll keep going there every morning for the next two months for the coding sessions. He&apos;s also buying him a laptop,  three JavaScript books, and &quot;something to hide the laptop in.&quot;</p>

<p>For all of our cynicism around the experiment&#x2014;particularly around McConlogue&apos;s naivety about his subject (he didn&apos;t learn Leo&apos;s name before writing the original post about him)&#x2014;McConlogue is sincere in his desire to <em>do</em> something active for another human being. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509000321/http://gothamist.com/tags/homelessness">Homelessness</a> is an ongoing crisis in NYC that has only worsened in the Bloomberg era: homeless families make up 78% of people staying in the city&apos;s administrative shelters, a number that has risen by 73% since Bloomberg took office, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509000321/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/05/nyc_faces_homeless_epidemic_not_see.php">according to a report</a> from Coalition for the Homeless.</p>

<p>No, McConlogue&apos;s coding project <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509000321/http://valleywag.gawker.com/homelessness-solved-1183778023">won&apos;t change that</a>, but his willingness to engage with other people is commendable (even if his approach has been somewhat tone-deaf so far). Unlike other <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509000321/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/17/white_lady_wears_afro_for_enlighten.php">ill-considered social experiments</a>, McConlogue is dealing with an issue that desperately needs more attention. In the end, it seems more important that he&apos;s willing to follow through on his big talk&#x2014;and to try to use this as an opportunity <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509000321/http://www.meetup.com/NYC-The-Journeyman-Hacker/events/136090922/">to discuss the wider homeless epidemic</a>&#x2014;than the fact he&apos;s set up <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509000321/https://www.facebook.com/pages/Journeyman/167865816737032">a Facebook page for Leo.</a></p>
