<p>&quot;I have to tell you, it&apos;s an unbelievably complex subject,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170307013232/http://www.newyorker.com/news/ryan-lizza/donald-trump-learns-that-reforming-health-care-is-complicated">Donald Trump told</a> a group of governors at the White House on Monday. &quot;Nobody knew that health care could be so complicated.&quot; Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm, I can think of a few people <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170307013232/http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/27/politics/bernie-sanders-obamacare-trump/">who knew that.</a> And one of them let out an LOL heard around the Internet. </p>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Yesterday, President Trump said, &apos;Nobody ever knew health care could be so complicated.&apos; Well, some of us had an idea. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170307013232/https://t.co/1gGZ2Ud3Zd">pic.twitter.com/1gGZ2Ud3Zd</a></p>&#x2014; Bernie Sanders (@SenSanders) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170307013232/https://twitter.com/SenSanders/status/836602107436347392">February 28, 2017</a></blockquote>

<p>&quot;Some of us who were sitting on the health education committee, who went to meeting after meeting after meeting, who heard from dozens of people, who stayed up night after night trying to figure out this thing, yeah we got a clue,&quot; Sanders said on CNN. &quot;When you provide health care in a nation of 320 million people, yeah, it is very, very complicated.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I mean, this is the president of the United States,&quot; Sanders added. &quot;We have been debating health care in this country for 30 years, and he says, &#x2018;Gee, who knew how complicated it was?&apos; He&#x2019;s maybe the only person in this country who doesn&#x2019;t know how complicated it is to provide health care for the American people.&quot;</p>

<p>Like that old saying goes: you can take the Bernie Sanders out of Larry David, but you can&apos;t take the Larry David out of Bernie Sanders.</p>

<p>Hey, here&apos;s someone else who knew healthcare was complicated.</p>
