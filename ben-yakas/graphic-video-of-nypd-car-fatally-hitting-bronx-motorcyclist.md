<p>Last August, an NYPD patrol car <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509175844/http://gothamist.com/2012/08/12/video_cop_car_fatally_hit_motorcycl.php">fatally struck a man on a dirt bike motocycle</a> in the Bronx during a chase. Dirt bike driver Eddie Fernandez, 28, was killed in the incident, while passenger Adalberto Gonzalez, 26, was injured when Police Officer Eddie McClain rammed his cruiser into them in Hunts Point on August 11th. Gonzalez is facing charges of resisting arrest and reckless endangerment, but his lawyer thinks McClain should have been charged, based on the graphic video of the incident which you can see below. &#x201C;It looks like a Scud missile,&#x201D; defense attorney Cesar Gonzalez <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509175844/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/bronx/killer_nypd_cruiser_vid_puts_heat_0lrSqsOWKjEzA6zJmAHHHO">told the Post.</a></p>

<p>The incident began when cops spotted Adalberto Gonzalez travelling south on Manida Street, operating the motorcycle without license plates or a helmet. Police ended up chasing Gonzalez on foot when he jumped onto the rear seat of another unregistered Honda dirt bike driven by Fernandez. You can see the aftermath of the police car striking the two men below.</p>

<p>&#x201C;I would feel a lot better if they [the district attorney] had put it before the grand jury and let them make a decision, because then the people of The Bronx have spoken,&quot; said Gonzalez&apos;s attorney. But a spokesman for Bronx DA Robert Johnson said the office has determined that the crash was accidental. &quot;Upon an extensive review of the evidence and circumstances of the incident, it was our determination that a sustainable criminal case could not be brought,&quot; said spokesman Steve Reed.</p>
