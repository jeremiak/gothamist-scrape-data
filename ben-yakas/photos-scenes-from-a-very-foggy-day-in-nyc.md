2014 is only 12 days old, but it has already brought a spate of schizophrenic weather with it. There was a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150326051038/http://gothamist.com/tags/blizzard">major winter blizzard</a>, then NYC was plunged into negative temps during the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150326051038/http://gothamist.com/tags/polarvortex">polar vortex</a>, and somehow it ended up being almost 60 degree outside yesterday. Along with the freakishly warm air came a whole lot of fog on Saturday&#x2014;but at least it was really goddamn pretty fog. Above, check out some gorgeous photos of the city enveloped in a thick coat of low-lying stratus clouds. </p>
