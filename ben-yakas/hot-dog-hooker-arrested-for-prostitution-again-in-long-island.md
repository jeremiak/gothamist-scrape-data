<p>The so-called Long Island <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408135859/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/05/long_island_woman_sells_sex_hot_dog.php">&quot;hot dog hooker&quot;</a> who gained tabloid fame last year for doling out more than just frankfurters <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408135859/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2013/05/24/so-called-hot-dog-hooker-in-trouble-again-following-alleged-prostitution-bust/">was arrested yesterday</a> by cops as part of a prostitution sting. Catherine Scalia, 47, was arrested for allegedly performing a massage (without a license) on an undercover detective at a hotel in Garden City; she also allegedly offered to perform a sex act for money. And she even drove her hot dog truck to the meeting place.</p>

<p>Scalia was charged with unauthorized practice and prostitution and was to be arraigned on Saturday. She was taken to Nassau University Medical Center in East Meadow for psychiatric evaluation. </p>

<p>Scalia was arrested under similar circumstances in May 2012 after she offered to perform sex acts on an undercover cop who bought two of her hot dogs. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408135859/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/18/hot_damn_hot_dog_hooker_sentenced_t.php">She pleaded guilty</a> to prostitution charges and was sentenced to 7 days in jail, but she also posited <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408135859/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/09/are_you_buying_hot_dogs_and_cleavag.php">this philosophical missive</a>: &quot;Prostitution is sex. I&#x2019;m not selling sex, I&#x2019;m selling my cleavage.&quot;</p>
