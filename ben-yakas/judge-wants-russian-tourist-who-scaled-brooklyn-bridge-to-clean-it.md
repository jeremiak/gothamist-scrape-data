<p>Last weekend, a Russian tourist <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501172649/http://gothamist.com/2014/08/24/video_man_arrested_for_mid-day_stro.php">decided to climb the Brooklyn Bridge</a> all the way up to the tower on the Brooklyn side, literally just because he thought it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501172649/http://gothamist.com/2014/08/26/tourist_scaled_brooklyn_bridge_for.php">would be &quot;fun.&quot;</a> So as penance, Judge ShawnDya Simpson <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501172649/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/russian-tourist-busted-climbing-brooklyn-bridge-clean-judge-article-1.1921593">literally wants</a> him to clean the Brooklyn Bridge, which we&apos;re sure would be tons of fun.</p>

<p>And the judge was actually doing him a favor in suggesting it: the district attorney&#x2019;s office wanted to give Russian tourist Yaroslav Kolchin, 24, a 90-day jail sentence for taking selfies while climbing the Bridge. But Simpson thinks that&apos;s a bit too harsh, and instead wants him to perform &quot;a bunch of community service.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If he likes the bridge, then let him clean the bridge,&#x201D; Simpson said in Brooklyn Criminal Court Friday. &quot;I&#x2019;m not condoning his behavior. Was it the smartest thing to do? No. Was it malicious? I don&#x2019;t think so, so I think you need to work it out.&quot;</p>

<p>The police response to Kolchin, who was charged with reckless endangerment, criminal trespass and disorderly conduct for the incident, cost taxpayers $7,407, which included the use of a helicopter and two boats. </p>

<p>Sadly, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501172649/http://nypost.com/2014/08/29/judge-wants-brooklyn-bridge-climber-to-go-clean-a-bridge/">sources tell the Post</a> that it&apos;s unlikely that Simpson&apos;s decree will come to pass, since there&apos;s no program set up for cleaning the Bridge. </p>
