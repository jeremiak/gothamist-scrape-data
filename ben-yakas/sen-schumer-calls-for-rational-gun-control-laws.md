<p>In the aftermath of last week&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623145619/http://gothamist.com/tags/gabriellegiffords">tragic shooting</a> in Tucson, Arizona, which left six people dead and 14 others injured during an apparent assassination attempt on Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, much of the ensuing discussion has revolved around gun laws.
