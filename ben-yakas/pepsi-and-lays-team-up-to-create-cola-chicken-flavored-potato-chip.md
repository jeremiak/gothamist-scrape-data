<p>Between the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150524051809/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/24/7-eleven_introduces_the_hot_dog_fla.php">hot dog</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150524051809/http://www.englishteastore.com/waprcopocr12.html">prawn cocktail</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150524051809/http://www.munchiesblog.com/chip-reviews/lays-hot-chili-squid/">hot chili squid</a>-flavored chips, it&apos;s becoming harder and harder to imagine exotic potato chip flavors that DON&apos;T already exist <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150524051809/http://travel.usatoday.com/deals/inside/story/2012-05-17/15-crazy-potato-chip-flavors-around-the-world/55023614/1">somewhere in the world</a>. Thankfully, the scientists over at Lay&apos;s have teamed up with their sister scientists over at Pepsi to create the newest weird potato chip flavor: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150524051809/http://adage.com/china/article/china-news/pepsi-cola-and-lays-team-up-for-snack-flavor-in-china/238655/">&quot;cola chicken.&quot;</a></p>

<p>Of course, as with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150524051809/http://www.buzzfeed.com/mjs538/16-products-they-only-sell-at-chinese-walmarts">so many</a> great things, you&apos;ll have to go to China to get them. &quot;We thought it would be really cool to have a cola combined with chicken...It&apos;s a very popular dish in China,&quot; said Richard Lee, PepsiCo&apos;s chief marketing officer in China. In case you&apos;re not familiar with the dish, cola chicken is chicken wings tossed into a wok and caramelized in soy sauce, spices and cola. As Adage puts it, the flavor is vaguely similar to barbecue with a sugary aftertaste in potato chip form.</p>

<p>So yes, this has happened. Maybe Beyonce <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150524051809/http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2012/12/10/beyonce-pepsi-become-global-partners-50-million-deal/1759385/">will endorse them</a> and bring them to America! Now when do we get our <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150524051809/http://gothamist.com/2012/08/02/eating_free_but_not_free_range_rat.php">rat flavored</a> chips?</p>
