<p>Were you as freaked out by the nightmarish <strike>Knicks game</strike> snakehead fish as we were? Yesterday, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508080728/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/01/if_you_see_a_terrifying_fish_with_t.php">we learned that authorities are nervous</a> that some of those hellspawn have made their way into Harlem Meer; these predatory fish, who can survive on land, endanger the entire fake ecosystem of Central Park. The Department of Environmental Conservation are so concerned about them, they say you should &quot;kill it immediately&quot; if you come across one. And of course there <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508080728/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CramNdhUvNw">are already NYers out there</a> trying to hunt the gremlins: &quot;It&apos;s something that has to get out of this water, and I&apos;ll be trying the most free time that I have,&quot; Noel Rodriguez <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508080728/http://www.wnyc.org/articles/wnyc-news/2013/may/01/snakehead-fish-central-park-continues/?utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;utm_medium=twitter">told WNYC</a>. &quot;The most days off I have, I&apos;ll be fishing here.&quot; But how exactly does one kill a snakehead fish?</p>

<p>First, it&apos;s important to note that these are vicious creatures&#x2014;there are plenty of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508080728/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X32cVIsYgSU">upsetting videos online</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508080728/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPGmvemG6fk">that show how they</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508080728/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keRNS-PuaDU">attack other animals</a> (at least a few of those videos were uploaded by some sick people). If you are planning to hunt a snakehead fish, you must come prepared. </p>

<p>There are a lot of YouTube gurus who say they hold the answers when it comes to kill-or-be-thoroughly freaked out by a snakefish egads (you can see one such person above). But if you want something a bit more applicable to your life here in NYC, here&apos;s our handy three step guide to killing one:</p>

<p>1. Buy a baseball bat.<br>
2. Carry the baseball bat everywhere with you.<br>
3. Use the baseball bat to smash the beast.</p>
