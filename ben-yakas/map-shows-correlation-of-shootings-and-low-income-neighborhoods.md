<p>While justifying the disproportionate amount of stop-and-frisks in poor neighborhoods, Police Commissioner Ray Kelly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508194118/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/blacks-70-shooting-suspects-2013-nypd-article-1.1522917">told the Daily News</a> that 97% of all shooting victims in NYC in 2012 &quot;were black or Hispanic and reside in low-income neighborhoods.&quot; One Redditor has compiled shooting and income data, so we can see whether that supposed trend is holding in 2013 (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508194118/http://i.imgur.com/nmM5HI3.jpg">see a bigger version here</a>). </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508194118/http://www.reddit.com/r/MapPorn/comments/1rln3c/income_map_of_nyc_overlayed_with_the_location_of/">Redditor im_an_actual_dog combined</a> shootings data from Jan-to-August 2013 with an income map based on the 2010 census to create the map above. The blue markers on the map represent non-fatal shootings, and the black ones are fatalities. He explained his own interest in the data: &quot;Originally just compared the ethnicity and shooting maps because of personal interest. Then decided to incorporate it into a school project, and overlayed the ethnicity and poverty maps as part of my explanation.&quot;</p>

<p>The map of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508194118/http://imgur.com/stOBkB0">shootings in NYC over the first eight months of 2013</a> was originally made by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508194118/http://my.reddit.com/r/MapPorn/comments/1ndzed/gun_crime_in_nyc_first_8_months_of_2013_blue/">fellow Redditor Ronanconway</a>. That person <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508194118/http://www.businessinsider.com/new-york-city-income-vs-shootings-map-2013-12">explained to Business Insider</a> how he created that map:</p>

<blockquote>There&apos;s a number of sources I used to compile the list, none are &quot;official&quot; however. My particular sources are the Daily News, NY Post, DNAinfo, the twitter feeds NYCityAlerts and NYScanner, and some local sources like CBS and NBC news.

<p>I used to run a crime blog for the city, and I still maintain a number of homicide and crime maps for a bunch of cities along the east coast, and it&apos;s local news that supplies all of those. Homicide and shootings tend to make the news reliably in a way that robberies and other crimes don&apos;t, so while there are surely shootings that did not make my list this is a good picture of shootings. Also, official statistics often count shootings in which there was no injury; my list is comprised of only shootings in at least one person was injured.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>All of this of course does not in and of itself justify Kelly&apos;s defense of stop-and-frisk or how the NYPD has utilized it, nor does correlation concretely imply causation. As im_an_actual_dog put it, &quot;I doubt income or race are direct causes of gun violence, but rather things that come with living in a poor neighborhood.&quot; </p>

<p>But it&apos;s still fascinating data, which will be even more fun to play around with not that the NYPD and the Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508194118/http://gothamist.com/2013/12/08/nypd_releases_interactive_crime_map.php">released an interactive crime map of the five boroughs</a> that allows New Yorkers to see the locations of all reported felonies over the last 20 months. </p>
