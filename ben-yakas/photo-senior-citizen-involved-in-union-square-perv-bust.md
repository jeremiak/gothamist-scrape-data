<p>There&apos;s been a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427122543/http://gothamist.com/tags/hipstercop">Hipster Cop-sized</a> hole in our hearts ever since we realized <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427122543/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/02/video_irate_hipster_cop_hates_elect.php">he hates indie rock</a>&#x2014;but it looks like we&apos;ve finally found our latest and greatest NYPD crush. Around 2:30 p.m. today, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427122543/http://gothamist.com/tags/joeyboots">Joey Boots</a> witnessed three officers arresting a man at Union Square who allegedly exposed himself on an uptown N Train. And according to Mr. Boots, that cute older woman was the one who cuffed him!</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="11113gran1.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427122543im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/11113gran1.jpeg" width="640" height="480"> <br> <i> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427122543/https://twitter.com/JoeyBoots">Joey Boots</a></i></div> <p></p>

<p>Here&apos;s what Boots observed: &quot;I got there after the arrest but I&apos;m assuming she arrested him [because] they took the cuffs off him and gave [them] to her and she put back in her bag.&quot; He added that the uniformed cop in the photo came out of the station and put <em>his </em>cuffs on the perp during the transfer. We&apos;ve contacted the NYPD to try to get more details about the incident and the officer, but considering it&apos;s 5 p.m. on a Friday afternoon, we weren&apos;t able to get much. But rest assured: we WILL figure out the mystery behind this Golden Girl gunslinger.</p>
