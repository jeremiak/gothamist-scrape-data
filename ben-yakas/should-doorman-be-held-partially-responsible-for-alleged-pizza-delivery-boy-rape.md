										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left"> <img alt="10412lucas.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141023062345im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/10412lucas.jpeg" width="300" height="281"> <br> <i style=" width:300px; ;display:block"> Cesar Lucas (via Facebook)</i></div> Last weekend, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141023062345/http://gothamist.com/tags/pizzadeliveryboy">a 16-year-old pizza delivery boy</a> was accused of raping a 35-year-old woman in her West 61st Street apartment. Cesar Lucas, who has reportedly confessed to the horrific crime, was caught after cops talked to the building&apos;s doorman and determined Lucas had been delivering a pizza to one of her neighbors. That doorman, who was the only person on duty that evening, has now been suspended. But 63-year-old Luis Rodriguez doesn&apos;t think he deserves the blame for the attack: &#x201C;There was nothing I or anyone put on that desk that night could have done to assist in whatever was going on upstairs on the 10th floor,&#x201D; Rodriguez <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141023062345/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/doorman-rape-building-fears-losing-job-article-1.1174412">told the Daily News.</a><p></p>

<p>Rodriguez, a married father of seven who has worked as a doorman for 23 years, is worried about losing his job&#x2014;especially now that his 13-year-old son has been admitted New York Presbyterian Hospital with pneumonia. Halstead Properties, who runs the 221-unit UWS building, put the doorman on unpaid suspension pending the outcome of an internal investigation. </p>

<p>Rodriguez explained that he was disciplined because Lucas was upstairs for at least 20 minutes between 12:30-1 a.m., and he didn&apos;t go to investigate. But to Rodriguez, that didn&apos;t seem that out of the ordinary: </p>

<blockquote>They could be giving out menus. They could have been striking up a conversation with the resident. They could have delivered the wrong food or charged them erroneously and was calling the store. There are a number of things that could have been happening that wouldn&#x2019;t have made me suspicious of the fact that this guy has been up there [for 20 minutes].</blockquote>

<p>Another source told them that the overnight porter job was eliminated a couple of months ago&#x2014;that person would have accompanied a delivery man upstairs at that time of night. &#x201C;It was a no-win situation,&#x201D; the source said, adding that Rodriguez was &#x201C;unjustly suspended.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Lucas was scheduled to appear in court today; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141023062345/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/01/16-yr-old_pizza_delivery_boy_allege.php">he reportedly confessed</a> to the crime, telling cops he &quot;went in because he was feeling horny and that he took advantage of her.&quot; His mother <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141023062345/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/02/pizza_delivery_boy_rape_suspects_mo.php">defended him the other day</a>, claiming the victim may have been drunk: &quot;I am not dismissing the woman&#x2019;s claims, but a lot of what she is saying doesn&#x2019;t make much sense.&quot;</p>
