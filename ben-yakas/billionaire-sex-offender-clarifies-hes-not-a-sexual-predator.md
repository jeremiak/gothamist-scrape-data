title: Billionaire Sex Offender Clarifies He's Not a Sexual Predator

										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:250px; "> <img alt="22511epstein.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160621224842im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/22511epstein.jpg" width="250" height="308"> <br> <i>Billionaire sex offender Jeffrey Epstein</i></div> Billionaire investor Jeffrey Epstein was recently released from prison after serving 13 months in jail for soliciting a minor for prostitution, and he&apos;s back in his natural habitat on the Upper East Side. But don&apos;t let that fool you into thinking he&apos;s learned any humility from his legal troubles: he made it clear <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160621224842/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/perv_don_shmear_me_GzYV0fJYoWleFsSTrQyaJK?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">to the Post</a> yesterday that a rich perv by any other name is still a rich perv.  &quot;<strong>I&apos;m not a sexual predator, I&apos;m an &apos;offender.&apos; It&apos;s the difference between a murderer and a person who steals a bagel</strong>,&quot; Epstein posited.<p></p>

<p>Aside from the semantics, a NY state judge ruled last month that Epstein is a level 3 sex offender, which means he&apos;s at &quot;high risk&quot; to repeat his offense, and poses &quot;a threat to public safety.&quot; But Epstein clarified that, &quot;The crime that was supposedly committed in Florida is not a crime in New York.&quot; Well, let&apos;s do some clarifying ourselves: Epstein was convicted in Florida of soliciting three underage girls, including a 14-year-old and a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160621224842/http://gothamist.com/2007/10/23/sources_say_she.php">transexual</a> 16-year-old, for sex. He was also accused of routinely paying girls as young as 14 for sexual massages; of molesting girls he had brought in from South America and Europe; and once was allegedly given three 12-year-old girls from France as a &quot;birthday gift.&quot; </p>

<p>But Epstein made a deal with Feds, and they agreed to drop their probe of the various sex-crime allegations if Epstein admitted to prostitution felonies in Florida state court. Perhaps worst of all, other sex crime pervs <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160621224842/http://www.businessinsider.com/epstein-defense-for-pedophiles-2010-8">are now using</a> Epstein&apos;s case, and his sweetheart deal, to ask for leniency in their own cases. If he&apos;s good enough to take a stroll through Central Park <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160621224842/http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/greenslade/2011/feb/20/newsoftheworld-prince-andrew">with Prince Andrew</a>, then he&apos;s good enough for a defense strategy!</p>

<p>Epstein is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160621224842/http://criminaljustice.state.ny.us/SomsSUBDirectory/offenderDetails.jsp?offenderid=33216">now listed</a> in the NY State Sex Offender Database, but his current address is listed in Florida, even though he&apos;s in the city. But considering that even when he was in jail, he was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160621224842/http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2008/08/jeffrey_epsteins_prison_party.html#hp">routinely visited</a> by a motley cadre of characters including his alleged 23-year-old Yugoslavian sex slave and a Russian mixed-martial-arts fighter, we can&apos;t imagine he won&apos;t get into some more trouble soon enough.</p>
