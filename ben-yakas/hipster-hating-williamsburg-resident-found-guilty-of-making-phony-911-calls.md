<p>A disgruntled middle-aged lifelong Williamsburg resident has been found guilty of making  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150222070952/http://gothamist.com/2014/08/20/fate_of_disgruntled_williamsburg_re.php">phony complaint calls to 911</a> about the hipster hooligans running amok in his neighborhood. Louis Segna, 53, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150222070952/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/21/nyregion/brooklyn-man-is-convicted-of-making-false-911-calls.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;_r=0">was found guilty</a> of three counts of falsely reporting an incident, stemming from various 911 calls he made about made-up events near his home at Bedford Avenue and North 7th Street in late 2012. And there&apos;s only been on explanation given for his frequent communications with authorities: &quot;He said there are hipsters in the neighborhood. He gave me the impression they were noisier than the population before,&quot; said defense attorney William Fowlkes.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150222070952/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/05/disgruntled_williamsburg_resident_a.php">Segna allegedly made</a> 403 of these phony calls, describing made-up violent confrontations and explosions around the neighborhood. He claimed a man pulled a knife on him at Spike Hill, he claimed two or three shots were fired at Station restaurant, and he claimed there was an explosion in a nearby subway tunnel (although he claimed not to know which subway he lived near). He would tell the dispatcher he was using a borrowed phones (he told the operator in one call he &quot;didn&apos;t own a phone&quot;) and wouldn&apos;t give his name (except when he gave a fake name). </p>

<p>Segna will be sentenced on Sept. 5th; he faces up to seven years in prison. Although the most appropriate punishment might be to lock him into a ten-year lease in an apartment in the middle of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150222070952/http://gothamist.com/tags/jefftown">Jefftown.</a></p>
