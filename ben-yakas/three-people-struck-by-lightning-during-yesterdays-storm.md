<p>Yesterday&apos;s intense lightning storm didn&apos;t last quite as long as was expected, but it was plenty serious nonetheless: the rest of this weekend&apos;s Electric Zoo festival <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150409161617/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/electric-zoo-festival-canceled-due-to-severe-weather-20140831">was cancelled</a> due to extreme weather conditions, the US Open was halted, and there were significant delays at all three major area airports. And at least three people were struck by lightning during the storm.</p>

<p>The three men were at Orchard Beach on Pelham Bay in the Bronx around 5 p.m. when they were struck. The FDNY says they were transported to Jacobi Medical Center, where they were said to be alert and conscious, and in stable condition. </p>

A friend of the family told Telemundo that the lightning hit the tree, sending the men flying at least 10 feet, and shredding their clothes (as you can see in the photo at the top).</p>
