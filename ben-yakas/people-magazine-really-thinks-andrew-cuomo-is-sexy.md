										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="112410cuomo.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20140728004652im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/112410cuomo.jpg" width="250" height="312" class="image-left"> </span></p>

<p>It seems that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140728004652/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/18/paladino_encourages_you_to_think_of.php">Carl Paladino</a> isn&apos;t the only person who finds naughty thoughts of our next Governor in the shower a bit, err, sexy: People Magazine included <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140728004652/http://gothamist.com/tags/andrewcuomo">Andrew Cuomo</a> in their &quot;Sexiest Man Alive&quot; issue, giving him a spot on the over-50&apos;s list. Executive editor Liz Sporkin <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140728004652/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/24/nyregion/24sexiest.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">told the Times</a> that the decision wasn&apos;t based solely on his masculine chin or brooding shoulders: &#x201C;His many years of public service make him sexy.&#x201D; </p>

<p>Nevertheless, Cuomo is taking the praise in stride, treating it sort of like how he treated his Gubernatorial victory:inevitable. &#x201C;A lot of it&#x2019;s just natural. It&#x2019;s genetic sculpting.&#x201D; In another interview, he demurely said he &quot;was slightly surprised initially.&#x201D; Chris Cuomo, a reporter with ABC, sounded none-too-jealous of his brother: &#x201C;I am happy for my brother, the governor-elect, and his so-called sexiness. It must be comforting for him to receive kudos from someone other than our mother, who favors him.&#x201D; We don&apos;t get it: doesn&apos;t he look like a weird cross between Dracula, Sonny Corleone and Skeletor? Well, we guess his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140728004652/http://gothamist.com/2010/10/08/paladino_fails_to_change_his_campai.php">prowess IS legendary.</a></p>
