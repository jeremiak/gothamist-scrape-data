										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2009_11_comed.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405012926im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2009_11_comed.jpg" width="250" height="207" class="image-left"> </span>As reported <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405012926/http://gothamist.com/2009/10/31/neil_simon_revival_to_close_after_8.php">over the weekend</a>, the revival of Neil Simon&apos;s &quot;Brighton Beach Memoirs&quot; ended its run yesterday after only one week due to poor ticket sales. Today, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405012926/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/02/theater/02simon.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=1&amp;partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">NY Times  asks</a> what went wrong, and came up with several possible answers: Simon&apos;s old-fashioned brand of comedy, the lack of star power, a slumping Broadway economy, an ever-evolving zeitgeist...actually, it seems like <em>everything </em>is what went wrong. </p>

<p>Reporter Patrick Healy writes, &quot;&apos;Brighton Beach Memoirs&apos; is a case study in success and failure on Broadway today. <strong>There were no big stars like Jude Law in the current commercial hit &apos;Hamlet&apos;; there was no marketing campaign that framed the Simon play as a can&#x2019;t-miss theatrical event, and there was no wow factor that brought the period piece to life, like the breakneck pacing of the popular farce &apos;Boeing-Boeing&apos; last year</strong>.&quot; And then he lays some blame on &quot;America&#x2019;s evolving sense of humor and taste&quot; at this point in time (American Idol, sardonic sitcoms like The Office, frat humor seen in The Hangover) and decides there isn&apos;t enough room on Broadway right now for the simple &quot;well-written, straightforward punch line.&quot; </p>

<p>Then there&apos;s this quote from Matthew Maguire, director of the theater program at Fordham University, who sees the ascent of &quot;Judd Apatow, Seth Rogen, [and] Steve Carell,&quot; as indicative of audiences wanting comedy &quot;<strong>more raw and edgy than Simon&apos;s work</strong>.&quot; Sounds like someone can&apos;t wait for &quot;Funny People&quot; to hit Broadway!  </p>

<p>The LA Times&apos; James Taylor <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405012926/http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/culturemonster/2009/11/what-really-happened-with-brighton-beach-memoirs.html">offers this opinion</a>: &quot;<strong>&apos;Brighton Beach Memoirs&apos; is a solid, American play, but it&#x2019;s not a classic.</strong>&quot;</p>
