<p>Everyone has their weekend ritual: some like to cuddle up with the NY Times in bed, some go out <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717104334/http://gothamist.com/tags/brunch">brunching</a>, and others <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717104334/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/18/25-year-old_tumblr_ceos_sunday_rout.php">like to tide their Vespa into the setting sun</a>. It appears that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717104334/http://gothamist.com/tags/insaneclownposse">Insane Clown Posse</a> like to sip on Faygo from champagne flutes and take romantic Saturday morning strolls on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717104334/http://gothamist.com/tags/highline">High Line.</a></p>

They were ostensibly there to film a video (or do a photo shoot), but maybe they wanted to check out the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717104334/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/05/video_new_yorkers_mistake_real_stat.php">lifelike statue that has been fooling New Yorkers into giving up their pocket change</a>?
