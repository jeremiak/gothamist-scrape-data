<p>2014 is still young, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508154945/http://gothamist.com/tags/chrischristie">Chris Christie</a> has had a pretty rough time of it so far&#x2014;if he&apos;s lucky, one day he&apos;ll prop his feet up on his desk in the Oval Office and look back on last night as the nadir. If you&apos;re wondering what the sound of Chris Christie&apos;s heart breaking is, it probably sounds something like his hero <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508154945/http://gothamist.com/tags/brucespringsteen">Bruce Springsteen</a> and Jimmy Fallon doing a parody about Bridgegate set to &quot;Born To Run&quot; (while both of them are dressed up as &apos;80s Bruce). Watch that clip and more below. </p>

<p>This is a man <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508154945/http://www.cbsnews.com/news/nj-gov-chris-christie-weeps-after-meeting-bruce-springsteen/">who <em>wept</em></a> after he met The Boss; a man who tried desperately for years to get Springsteen <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508154945/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/30/nyregion/30springsteen.html?_r=1&amp;">to be his buddy.</a> A man who has been to at least 130 Springsteen shows, a man who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508154945/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/07/video_chris_christie_tells_jon_stew.php">overanalyzed the one time he hugged Springsteen</a> on national television. Dislike him and his bullying attitude all you want&#x2014;the big gov is hurting badly today, no doubt.<br>
 <br>
Here&apos;s a snippet of the lyrics:</p>

<blockquote>In the day we sweat it out on the streets stuck in traffic on the GWB. They shut down the toll booths of glory &#x2018;cuz we didn&#x2019;t endorse Christie. Sprung from cages on Highway 9, we got three lanes closed, so Jersey get your a- in line. Woah! Maybe this Bridgegate was just payback, it&#x2019;s a b&#x2014;- slap to the state democrats, we gotta get out but we can&#x2019;t-we&#x2019;re stuck in Governor Chris Christie&#x2019;s Fort Lee New Jersey traffic jam!
</blockquote>

<p>Springsteen was the only guest on Fallon last night&#x2014;it might not have been as intense as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508154945/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/03/videos_a_look_back_at_bruce_springs.php">his weeklong residency in 2012</a>, but there was still plenty of time for looking back on the early parts of his career.</p>

<p>Springsteen also answered Twitter questions and discussed his insanely long live shows:</p>

<p>Best of all, he answered the age old &quot;would you rather battle one horse-sized duck, or 100 duck-sized horses&quot; question.</p>

<p>He also performed three songs, which you can watch below: &quot;Heaven&apos;s Wall,&quot; &quot;High Hopes&quot; (dedicated to the absent Steven Van Zandt) and &quot;Just Like Fire Would.&quot;</p>
