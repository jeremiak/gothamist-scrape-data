<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="21911baseball.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602121536im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/21911baseball.jpg" width="120" height="120" class="image-right"> </span></p>

<p>Are you a die-hard <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602121536/http://gothamist.com/tags/Baseball">baseball</a> fan? Does the concept of watching every single game in a season not fill you with dread, confusion and self-loathing? If so, then you are the perfect candidate for MLB&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602121536/http://mlb.mlb.com/dreamjob/">Dreamjob program</a>. </p>

<p>Dreamjob offers one superfan the chance to have a full-time paid job following the entire 2011 season while living (in a location picked by MLB) in NYC; the major responsibilities include watching <em>every game</em> this season (yep, that includes the Kansas City Royals and Pittsburgh Pirates), and blogging/vlogging daily on the world of baseball. Let&apos;s just reiterate: that&apos;s 2430 games, plus the playoffs, in a seven month period. Even the mighty <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602121536/http://www.firejoemorgan.com/">Joe Morgan</a> might have trouble keeping up with that pace.</p>
