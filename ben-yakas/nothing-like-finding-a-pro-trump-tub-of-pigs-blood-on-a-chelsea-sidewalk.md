<p>This weekend, a Chelsea art gallery <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108025645/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/10/pro_trump_art_show.php#photo-1">played host to DaddyWillSaveUs</a>, a self-proclaimed &quot;pro-Trump art show&quot; in which some of the more artistically-minded members of the Alt-Right poured pig&apos;s blood all over each other in celebration of Trump, or something. The pig&apos;s blood was part of Milo Yiannopoulos&apos;s performance piece, which was a muddled commentary on people who had been murdered by immigrants. </p>

<p>Toward the end of the event, some of the &quot;Proud Boys,&quot; members of Gavin McInnes&apos;s fraternity of &quot;western chauvinists,&quot; went to bring the blood tub outside and dump it into a sewer grate. They missed however, pouring much of the blood on the street, and then apparently gave up&#x2014;leaving the tub, which was still filled with blood, there for unsuspecting strangers to come upon.</p>

<p>&quot;So I was walking down 18th Street on Sunday morning when I saw what appeared to be a bathtub full of blood,&quot; Kate Burch, who took the photos above around noon Sunday, told us. &quot;I took some pictures because it was weird&#x2014;then I saw your Trump art show article and realized it was the same bathtub! So yeah, in addition to being horrible, the pro-Trump art show crew are improper-bloody-bathtub-disposing-bad-neighbors.&quot;</p>

<p>It is believed the tub was there at least through Monday&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108025645/http://www1.nyc.gov/nyc-resources/faq/475/how-do-i-throw-out-a-large-metal-item">large metal items</a> such as bathtubs aren&apos;t collected until recycling day, which is Friday for that neighborhood, so that rules out the city picking it up. The Alt-Right members did not return to the gallery until Monday night to remove their work from the gallery; as of Tuesday evening, the tub had disappeared from that location.</p>

<p>Laura O&apos;Reilly, the owner and founder of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108025645/http://wallplay.com/">Wallplay</a> (which rented the space in question), told me that she had not been prepared for the amount of blood involved in the event beforehand: &quot;The blood splatter performance element was not made clear to me,&quot; she said. &quot;Lucian&apos;s photos with the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108025645/http://www.deathandtaxesmag.com/297772/twinks-4-trump-rnc-alt-right/">Trump twinks</a> were the only visual reference I was given to judge the show. To me, when I saw that, I thought it was more satirical farce, not meant to be taken literally. I&apos;m not going to say they tricked me, that&apos;d be a cop out, but this all happened in 48 hours very quickly...and we don&apos;t vet things as strictly when someone&apos;s just paying a general rental fee.&quot;</p>

<p>O&apos;Reilly, who noted that she was neither the curator or producer of the show (&quot;It was a rental space, the gallery had nothing to do with it&quot;), said that once it became clear what the event really was, she still felt it was important <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108025645/http://wallplay.com/official-statement-on-trump-art-show/">not to shut it down</a>. &quot;It was a very bizarre room of people,&quot; she said. &quot;The darkness in the room was chilling, in my opinion. I feel like discourse and discussion through art is a major part of what I believe in. Even though I don&apos;t agree with what they were promoting, I didn&apos;t have it in me to shut them down,&quot; she continued. &quot;I ended up in an uncomfortable situation I never meant to get in the middle of. It was disturbing, I&apos;m still a bit traumatized.&quot;</p>

<p>She noted that the gallery had feminist <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108025645/http://wallplay.com/homepage/nataliewhite-eranow/">Natalie White&#x2019;s exhibition</a> in another room at the time, and though the Alt-Right group wanted to use that space as well, they weren&apos;t allowed to do so. &quot;Sometimes being stretched to really have to see the other side and look them in the face is important, and it was a big indication of what&apos;s going on in the rest of our country that we don&apos;t see very often here in NY,&quot; she said. &quot;I think it&apos;s important that everyone gets to express themselves. Whether I think it&apos;s appropriate for people to spray blood on gallery floors and reporters...I think that&apos;s highly offensive and disgusting. But I think these guys made themselves look insane. It hurt them more than it helped them.&quot;</p>

<p>Lucian Wintrich, the organizer of the art show, told us he was satisfied with the event: &quot;I was very happy with the turnout and reactions in general, there was such incredible diversity in the audience,&quot; he said. &quot;I met an elderly couple who were art historians, they said they had never seen anything like it and were thrilled. Overall, I think everyone had a wonderful time, and we were able to provide a show for people who otherwise are outlaws of the art scene.&quot;</p>

<p>He had no response when asked about the whereabouts of the blood tub.</p>
