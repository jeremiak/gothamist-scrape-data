<p>Last year, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150620034103/http://gothamist.com/2010/12/19/cops_mistake_window_smoker_for_suic.php">cops mistook a man</a> who was enjoying a cigarette break on the sill of his second-floor apartment window for an emotionally disturbed person, and assumed he was trying to commit suicide...from a twelve-foot ledge. And now, the city <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150620034103/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/city_moked_by_suicide_goof_H2z1K5RB3b8rGgD7mkljdJ?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">has paid up</a> for their mistake.</p>

<p>Lawyer Mark Moody was awarded a $45,001 settlement from the city for the incident. Moody had been sitting on his sill in Peck Slip last summer when three ambulance and four patrol cars showed up to talk him down.  &quot;If I was going to commit suicide, this would be a pretty dumb place to do it. If I jumped from here, I&apos;d just sprain my ankle,&quot; the 40-year-old yelled at the cops that day from his ledge, after he refused to come down. A broken door later, Moody was hauled in for a psychiatric evaluation against his will, where the on-duty psychiatrist apologized for the mistake. Hopefully this was a helpful reminder to the Bloomberg administration that people aren&apos;t necessarily insane if they enjoy <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150620034103/http://gothamist.com/tags/smoking">smoking</a>.</p>
