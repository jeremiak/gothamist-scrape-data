<p>Police say a man was punched in the face on a train in Brooklyn by an assailant who told him to go back to Mexico.</p>

<p>The incident happened around 5:20 p.m. on Wednesday. The 27-year-old victim was aboard a southbound J train pulling into the Crescent Street subway station in East New York when he was attacked. The assailant, who police say was wearing a grey sweatsuit and had braids, allegedly yelled at the victim, &quot;Fucking Mexican, go back to your country.&quot;</p>

<p>The suspect then punched the man in the face twice, breaking his nose, and fled the scene. The victim was taken to Interfaith Hospital in stable condition. An NYPD spokesperson confirmed that the NYPD&#x2019;s Hate Crimes Task Force is investigating the incident.</p>
