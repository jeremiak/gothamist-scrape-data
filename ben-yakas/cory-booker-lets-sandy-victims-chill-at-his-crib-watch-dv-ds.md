<p>Twitter has played a major role in sharing information about Hurricane Sandy&#x2014;sometimes for the worse, like when <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160803182918/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/31/councilman_peter_vallone_wants_to_c.php">trolls blatantly spread misinformation</a>. But then there are politicians like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160803182918/http://gothamist.com/tags/corybooker">Newark Mayor Cory Booker</a>, who prides himself on how much he uses it to communicate directly to his constituents about everything from a broken down car to flooding in the Ironbound. No problem is too small! Need a place to recharge your phone? Booker is on it. Do you really think Mayor Bloomberg would help with your Hot Pockets-related crisis?</p>

<p>This morning, Twitter user @my_serenelove <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160803182918/https://twitter.com/my_serenelove/status/263987435267043328">tweeted at the mayor</a>, &quot;I live around the corner from u on homestead. Why don&apos;t we have our power back. Half of my block does.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160803182918/https://twitter.com/CoryBooker/status/263988996206653441">His response</a>: &quot;There is someone at my house now (Eric). I&apos;ve got space u can relax in, charge devices &amp; even a working DVD player. Come by.&quot;  </p>

<p>But then, Booker must have thought, what if @my_serenelove&apos;s neighbor sees her come over, and think she wasn&apos;t invited? &quot;Please let any1 on Homestead know they can come 2 my house &amp; use the spare apt on 1st floor 2 relax, get warm, charge up etc,&quot; he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160803182918/https://twitter.com/CoryBooker/status/263990447205122048">tweeted next.</a> Less than an hour ago, @my_serenelove confirmed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160803182918/https://twitter.com/my_serenelove/status/264062965513322497">where she was</a>: &quot;At @CoryBooker house. Charging everything up. Thx.&quot;</p>

<p>A lot of local politicians have really stepped up their game over the course of the last week: the Mitt Romney-adoring, stubbornly confrontational Gov. Chris Christie gave way to an Obama-loving, still confrontational Gov. Chris Christie. Gov. Andrew Cuomo&apos;s distant, unfriendly demeanor added a new facet: environmentally-passionate truth-teller. But since Monday, Booker has averaged more than 100 tweets a day, with 416 tweets (retweets included, as of 2 p.m. Thursday) since Sandy descended on the tri-state area. And nearly half of those&#x2014;240&#x2014;were responses to constituents&apos; tweets. Bloomberg&apos;s people have been good about updating his feed with the latest public announcements&#x2014;Booker is the one who has been driving around town <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160803182918/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/27/extra_extra_2418.php">checking on people&apos;s grandmothers.</a> </p>
