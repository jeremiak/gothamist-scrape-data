<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021073223/http://gothamist.com/tags/kanyewest">Kanye West</a> has already had a few aborted attempts at playing shows in NYC this year, including the rained-out third day of Governor&apos;s Ball and a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021073223/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/06/video_kanye_west_asked_de_blasio_to.php">chaotic East Village</a> make-up show that wasn&apos;t to be. But it seems New Yorkers will finally get to see him live come September, when the just announced &quot;Saint Pablo&quot; tour comes to town for two shows.</p>

<p>West will play Madison Square Garden on September 5th and 6th as he heads out on a 40-date tour of the country; there are also stops relatively nearby in Buffalo, Boston and Philadelphia. You can see all the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021073223/http://read.tidal.com/article/kanye-wests-saint-pablo-tour-presale">rest of the dates here.</a> Tickets go on sale Saturday, June 18th <a href="www.livenation.com">here</a>, unless you are an American Express card member or TIDAL user:</p>

<p>The tour, which will be West&apos;s first since 2013&apos;s <em>Yeezus</em> tour (which was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021073223/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/20/photos_videos_kanye_west_barclays_c.php#photo-1">a true and wondrous spectacle</a>), takes its name from an as-yet unreleased West song <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021073223/http://genius.com/Kanye-west-saint-pablo-lyrics">of the same title</a>, which uses Jay Z&apos;s &quot;Where I&apos;m From&quot; beat as a backdrop for one of West&apos;s most intimate dives into his current financial, mental and emotional spaces. The song leaked online in March, and you can listen to it below (while it&apos;s still up).</p>
