This week, Sansa took charge, Tyrion discussed beetles, and the Red Viper battled The Mountain. GOT is all about how people jockey for power, so click through for our season four <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504233427/http://gothamist.com/tags/gameofthronespowerrankings">Game of Thrones Power Rankings.</a></p>

<p><strong>Game Of Thrones Power Rankings, Week 8:</strong></p>

<p><strong>1. Daenerys Targaryen:</strong> For a moment, Dany seemed like the teenage girl she factually is, braiding her girlfriend&apos;s hair and gossiping about boys (&quot;the pillar and the stones&quot;) and Dothraki sex. But once she learned of Jorah&apos;s betrayal, she snapped back into steely-eyed &quot;hang the masters&quot; mode. Of course, exiling her oldest friend, advisor &amp; cheerleader might prove problematic in the future&#x2014;but reporting on the Mother Of Dragon&apos;s unborn child? Oh hell no.</p>

<p><strong>2. The Godawful Climactic Minutes Of The Episode:</strong> We all saw it coming. Oberyn twirled his spear and danced around The Mountain, conjuring the ghost of the great Water Dancer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504233427/http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Syrio_Forel">Syrio Forel</a>. Except by toying with The Mountain instead of finishing him, Oberyn ignored the lesson Syrio taught Arya: &quot;There is only one god, and His name is Death. And there is only one thing we say to Death: &apos;not today.&apos;&quot; Instead of defying death, Oberyn went <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504233427/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JGp7Meg42U">full-Inigo Montoya</a>, and suffered possibly the most gruesome death in the history of the show. But damn if it wasn&apos;t thrilling stuff.</p>

<p><strong>3. Darth Sansa:</strong> It took thirty-eight episodes, but Sansa has finally taken charge of her life. She chose the devil she knows rather than the strangers she doesn&apos;t, and she got a new, dark look out of it too. Sure, she doesn&apos;t really know how to walk in heels, but for once, we feel confident that she&apos;ll get there.</p>

<p><strong>4. Roose Bolton:</strong> Warden of the North/ doling out the charm/ Ready with a handshake and an open palm/ Flayed man on the sigil/ Chainmail under arms/ Enabling his creepy bastard all the day long.</p>

<p><strong>5. Red Viper/Prince Oberyn Martell&apos;s One Man Impersonation Of The Most Famous Scene From <em>Scanners</em>:</strong> Oberyn has been a charismatic, passionate, and most welcome addition to the cast this season, despite really only having two character beats (murder Lannisters/vigorously make love to everyone else). We will miss him and his polyamorous ways dearly, perhaps more than we miss all those dead Starks (save a certain someone&apos;s Manbun...). Of course we were traumatized by The Mountain literally SQUISHING his brain&#x2014;but the worst part may have been the quick shot of Oberyn&apos;s bloody teeth scattering all over. At least David Cronenberg never got into eye gouging.</p>

<p><strong>6. Will Somebody Please Get Littlefinger Some Salt Water To Gargle? He&apos;s Not Even Whispering Anymore, It Really Sounds Like He&apos;s Straining To Speak</strong>: The grubbiest man in the Seven Kingdoms may be a money lender and a whoremonger, but he also is basically a Sith Lord at this point. And his advice to Robin Arryn sums up the themes of the episode quite succinctly, a reflection of the fates of Sansa, Oberyn and Tyrion: &quot;Don&apos;t worry about your death. Worry about your life. <strong>Take charge of your life, for as long as it lasts.&quot;</strong></p>

<p><strong>7. An Inquiry Into Why Cousin Orson Smashed Beetles All Day Long:</strong> For the fourth time this season, we stand in awe of Peter Dinklage&#x2014;first with his unwavering patience at Joffrey&apos;s wedding, then with his Emmy-worthy trial, followed by his moving attempts to find a champion. All of his scenes with Jaime have been highlights as well this season, and we may have gotten the best one yet this week as Tyrion contemplates his dim-witted cousin&apos;s obsession with smashing beetles. This is the kind of monologue that made us fall in love with GOT in the first place, swinging from banality to gallows humor to deep existential crisis.</p>

<p><strong>8. The Previously On GOT Ghost Of Ned Stark&apos;s Manbun:</strong> It is truly <em>always</em> a welcome sight.</p>

<p><strong>9. Now That He&apos;s Earned His Father&apos;s Respect, Maybe We Can Take A Few Weeks Off From Ramsay <strike>Snow</strike> Bolton, Because We Dearly Love Just About Everything About This Show Except For This Ongoing Exercise In Flaying Porn:</strong> Ramsay&apos;s sadistic mind games with Reek finally pay off as his dad rewards his bug-eyed psychosis with his last name. Hopefully we won&apos;t see him again until next season! </p>

<p><strong>10. The Westeros Justice System Continues To Be Really Confusing:</strong> So The Viper mortally wounds The Mountain, but then has his brains scooped out like a melon baller. Both men lie dead at the end... but Tywin declares that Tyrion must die? Do all tie breakers favor the ruling side? Shouldn&apos;t there at least be a discussion about this? Can we get a do-over?</p>

<p><strong>11. Jon Snow&apos;s Incredibly Slow Moving Storyline This Season:</strong> Season four has been slowly teasing the big conflict between the Night&apos;s Watch and Mance Rayder&apos;s army at The Wall, which has left everyone&apos;s favorite Emo Kid with nothing much to do but clean up old business (the mess at Craster&apos;s Keep) and look sullen. This was another week that mostly served to remind us that: a) The Wildings are coming; b) The Night&apos;s Watch is hopelessly outmanned; c) Ygritte is chomping at the bit to see her former lover; and d) Jon snow is super sad because of all of the above.   </p>

<p><strong>12. Grey Worm + Missandei:</strong> Once again, the Powers That Be here at GOT Power Rankings HQ are gobsmacked by how much of an emotional investment we feel for two quaternary characters. For the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504233427/http://gothamist.com/2014/04/28/game_of_thrones_power_rankings_oath.php">second time this season</a>, the most romantic scenes in GOT concerned a eunuch and a translator...exchanging passionate looks. No one may be fully satisfied in their relationship, but it makes it ever more bittersweet when we get the Bogart-worthy line, &quot;I&apos;m glad you saw me.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>13. The Mellifluous Sound Of Arya&apos;s Laughter</strong>: Lots of things make her happy! Like daydreaming about murdering people with chicken bones!</p>

<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="//web.archive.org/web/20150504233427if_/http://www.youtube.com/embed/QvRGDynDytU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p><strong>14. Tyrion Lannister&apos;s Topsy-Turvy Rollercoaster Of Emotions</strong>: Yeaaaaaaah, this about sums it up:</p>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>I knew he was gonna die, but why was it so brutal. Omg! Tyrion&apos;s reaction = mine.. :S <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504233427/https://twitter.com/search?q=%23GameOfThrones&amp;src=hash">#GameOfThrones</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504233427/https://twitter.com/search?q=%23RIPOberyn&amp;src=hash">#RIPOberyn</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504233427/http://t.co/WbQm4Aj2Bc">pic.twitter.com/WbQm4Aj2Bc</a></p>&#x2014; lakis (@castaneom) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504233427/https://twitter.com/castaneom/statuses/473347551098195968">June 2, 2014</a></blockquote>

<p><strong>15. Ser Friendzone&apos;s Original Sin:</strong> Back in the days when Ned Stark&apos;s Manbun was still walking the Earth, Jorah Mormont spied on Dany for Tywin Lannister in an attempt to get a pardon and return with honor to King&apos;s Landing. But somewhere along the line, Jorah fell in love with her (the fact that she emerged from Khal Drogo&apos;s fires unscathed with three baby dragons certainly didn&apos;t hurt either). Because his deceits occurred mostly off camera, and because he became so devoted so quickly to his Khaleesi, it was easy for us all to brush aside his deceit. But how could Dany possibly trust him again when their whole relationship was based on a lie? It might seem harsh, but she was completely right: no amount of kneeling&#x2014;and certainly no sincerely awkward invocations of love&#x2014;were going to keep him in her company. </p>

<p><strong>The Viserys Targaryen Memorial Least Powerful Person Of The Week Award:</strong> Any other week, the tear-stained face of Samwell Tarley as he contemplates his role in the presumed death of his beloved Gilly would have been enough to snag this award even from the likes shaking, muttering Reek. But we have to hand this one to <strong>The People of Mole&apos;s Town</strong>, who are slaughtered by The Thenns and the other Wildings.</p>

<p><strong>The Ser Pounce Memorial Most Powerful Pet Of The Week Award:</strong> One day, probably in season seven or whatever, we hope the real Theon Greyjoy emerges from the broken shell of <strong>Reek</strong> long enough to murder the shit out of Ramsay Bolton. Until then, we are stuck with appreciating actor Alfie Allen&apos;s commitment to the flayed dog that is Reek; as much as we dislike the amount of time given over to his storyline, there&apos;s no denying the power of his muttering breakdown.</p>

<p><strong>The Hodoriffic Honorary Minor Character Of The Week Award:</strong> We&apos;re going to give this one to new character <strong>Yohn Royce</strong>, a powerful bannerman of House Arryn who delights in insulting Littlefinger (aka Ser Grubbyness). We have no doubt he will pay for his comments eventually, so let&apos;s appreciate him while we can.</p>

<p><strong>The Gruesome Bolton Tradition Of The Week:</strong> Ever since the Boltons became major players in the show in season three, we&apos;ve been told about their predilection for flaying. But besides Theon&apos;s torture sessions in season three, we haven&apos;t really been forced to visually confront the brutality of their house sigil. That all came crashing down this week, first with an axe to the head (those Ironborn sure aren&apos;t very loyal, are there?) and then with the &quot;punchline:&quot; we see that the guy who betrayed his countryman has been turned into a fully flayed, ribs-showing husk of human. </p>

<p><strong>The Lord Oaf Of Highgarden Oafiest Glimpse Of The Night:</strong> He was probably onscreen for all of five seconds, sitting besides the other royalty at the episode-ending fight. But if we had it our way, Mace Tyrell&apos;s oblivious, dopey face would pop up in the background of every scene. Whether he&apos;s laying siege to a banquet table or being dismissed by his mother, we crave any time spent with the most &quot;ponderous oaf&quot; in all of Westeros.</p>

<p><strong>Rickon Watch 2014: Is Rickon Still On This Show?</strong> Years before our watch began, there were other brave souls who risked life and limb to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504233427/http://whereisrickon.tumblr.com/">search for the one true Rickon</a>. Sadly, those like-minded warriors were lost somewhere along the way. Now we stand alone, with steadfast, unwavering vigil. We are the Simple Minds on The Wall. </p>

<p><strong>The Remember Roz Sexposition Quotient:</strong> Melisandre&apos;s World Conquering Nipples took the week off, but Missandei stepped up, giving unto us all full front and back nudity. But for once, this wasn&apos;t about her using her body for power (or men taking her power away from her by abusing her)&#x2014;this was as close to a love scene as we&apos;ve gotten this year.</p>

<p><strong>Way Beyond The Wall:</strong> Brienne + Pod, Ser Bronn, Daario Naharis 2.0 and Melisandre&apos;s Persuasive Libido all took the week off. Same with the Queen of Thorns/Olenna Tyrell, Margaery Tyrell&apos;s Conscience, Ser Loras, Bran Stark (along with Hodor/Jojen Reed/Meera Reed), and the White Walkers. No King Tommen, King Stannis or Ser Davos. As has been their style this year, The Brotherhood Without Banners and Mance Rayder were nowhere to be seen.</p>

<p>Next week, the shit hits the fan at The Wall as Jon Snow and his burgeoning sense of leadership come face to face with the Wildings. Until then, let&apos;s turn back the clock to 1986.</p>
