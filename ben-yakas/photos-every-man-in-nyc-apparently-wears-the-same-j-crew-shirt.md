<p>If variety is the spice of life, then <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509151735/http://factory.jcrew.com/womens-clothing/shirts_tops/washed_shirts/PRDOVR~23225/23225.jsp">J Crew gingham shirts</a> are the ham sandwiches&#x2014;dependable, always <em>fine</em>, never mind-blowing. Men who know little-to-nothing about fashion (which includes both this writer and, judging by the men I know, most men I know) cling to a few basic sartorial concepts, like &quot;never wear shorts to work,&quot; &quot;don&apos;t even think about wearing a hat,&quot; and &quot;plaid works, dude.&quot; And now the dirty little secret is out, thanks to Instagram account <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509151735/http://instagram.com/thatjcrewginghamshirt">thatjcrewginghamshirt.</a></p>

<p>It&apos;s funny because we all dress the same. </p>

<p>It&apos;s funny because the joke is that this Instagram feed reposts photos of people wearing the same J Crew shirt, but it&apos;s also not a joke because it&apos;s not a joke to the people who are wearing the shirts in the photos, this is just how they dress sometimes, which actually makes the joke funnier to some people.</p>

<p>Making fun of people for their choices isn&apos;t funny.</p>

<center><iframe src="//web.archive.org/web/20150509151735if_/http://instagram.com/p/rZwX1buFQB/embed/" width="612" height="710" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowtransparency="true"></iframe></center>

<p>Then again, making fun of people for their choices IS funny sometimes.</p>

<center><iframe src="//web.archive.org/web/20150509151735if_/http://instagram.com/p/rcAVgOuFa0/embed/" width="612" height="710" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowtransparency="true"></iframe></center>

<p>Also, uniformity is hilarious, have you even seen the movie <em>The Giver</em>? LOL!</p>

<center><iframe src="//web.archive.org/web/20150509151735if_/http://instagram.com/p/rc5TwZOFWy/embed/" width="612" height="710" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowtransparency="true"></iframe></center>

<p>Of course it wouldn&apos;t be so funny if this were a movie titled &quot;The Stepford Gingham Shirt Wearers Who Are Zombies/Slaves To Capitalism, This Is A Metaphor, Get It?&quot;</p>

<center><iframe src="//web.archive.org/web/20150509151735if_/http://instagram.com/p/rjxHUkOFXY/embed/" width="612" height="710" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowtransparency="true"></iframe></center>

<p>It would really be a bummer if this Instagram turned out to be a not-so-elaborate J Crew advertising campaign.</p>

<center><iframe src="//web.archive.org/web/20150509151735if_/http://instagram.com/p/r0XvWOOFSl/embed/" width="612" height="710" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowtransparency="true"></iframe></center>

<p>Even if it isn&apos;t an authorized J Crew advertisement, it kind of is a J Crew advertisement, isn&apos;t it?</p>

<center><iframe src="//web.archive.org/web/20150509151735if_/http://instagram.com/p/rskDZ_OFQV/embed/" width="612" height="710" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowtransparency="true"></iframe></center>

<p>Wait, are we advertising for J Crew right now by pointing out how comfortable their cotton, machine-wash long sleeve shirts are? </p>

<p><iframe src="//web.archive.org/web/20150509151735if_/http://instagram.com/p/r4VWbtuFbe/embed/" width="612" height="710" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowtransparency="true"></iframe></p>

<p>Wearing one of their shirts is like taking up residency in a warm glove.</p>

<center><iframe src="//web.archive.org/web/20150509151735if_/http://instagram.com/p/r0QEK-uFUQ/embed/" width="612" height="710" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowtransparency="true"></iframe></center>

<p>Men and women want to make love to you if you wear J Crew.</p>

<center><iframe src="//web.archive.org/web/20150509151735if_/http://instagram.com/p/r482olOFd3/embed/" width="612" height="710" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowtransparency="true"></iframe></center>

<p>Life was but a hopeless series of occurrences &apos;til I got my Crew on. </p>
