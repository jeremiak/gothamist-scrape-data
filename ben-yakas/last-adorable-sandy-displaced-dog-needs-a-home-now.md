<p>In the wake of Hurricane Sandy, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130318030825/http://gothamist.com/2012/11/02/urgent_adopt_or_foster_these_dogs_a.php#photo-1">there were hundreds of animals displaced</a> across the five boroughs. Plenty of those <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130318030825/http://gothamist.com/2012/11/07/21_photos_of_cats_dogs_ferrets_bein.php#photo-1">adorable pets were rescued</a> by various city agencies and reunited with their owners. Others were given temporary housing at emergency shelters and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130318030825/http://gothamist.com/2012/08/10/bike_tickets.php#photo-1">ASPCA boarding facilities</a>. One of those emergency shelters in Long Island is shutting down in a week&#x2014;and they still have one dog left who needs a home.</p>

<p>Meet Bruno, a 7 1/2 year old male Rottweiler who lost his home during Sandy. More specifically, his owner lost his home, and has been living in his car while looking for work. Bruno has been stuck living <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130318030825/http://nassaucountyspca.org/adoption.cfm">in the Pet Emergency Shelter at Mitchel Field</a> ever since. Not that he hasn&apos;t had the saddest-sounding visits ever, according <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130318030825/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/clock_ticking_for_last_dog_standing_rGkKDcw3qJcexow4O3MytO?utm_source=SFnewyorkpost&amp;utm_medium=SFnewyorkpost">to the Post</a>: &quot;During their visits, [Nassau County SPCA spokesman Gary] Rogers says both the owner and the Rottweiler cry. Afterward, Bruno howls for half an hour.&quot;</p>

<p>While Bruno&apos;s owner is desperately looking for work, Bruno will need somewhere to go in a week when the shelter shutters. If you have any experience with rottweilers, or know anyone who does, call the shelter at 516-272-0017 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130318030825/http://nassaucountyspca.org/adoption.cfm">for more info.</a></p>
