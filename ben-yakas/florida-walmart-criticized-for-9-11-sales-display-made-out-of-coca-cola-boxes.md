title: Florida Walmart Criticized For 9/11 Sales Display Made Out Of Coca Cola Boxes 
---

	
										<p>It&apos;s that time of year again, when corporations, small businesses and well-intentioned ninnies start breaking out their tasteless 9/11 tributes. The ball already got rolling last weekend when a couple <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161113152826/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/offensive-dragon-festival-costume-depicts-twin-towers-9-11-article-1.2781738">dressed up as the burning Twin Towers</a> for the fantasy/sci-fi Dragon Con 2016, and now a Florida Walmart has thrown its hat into the ring with a sale display featuring cases of soda shaped like the World Trade Center, with a &quot;Never Forget&quot; banner hanging above it. As you can see, they didn&apos;t forget to brand the banner with their corporate logos.</p>

<p>Charles Crowson, a spokesman for Walmart, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161113152826/http://www.orlandoweekly.com/Blogs/archives/2016/09/07/a-florida-walmart-wants-you-to-never-forget-a-great-deal-on-coke-products">told Orlando Weekly</a> that the 9/11 display, which was located inside a Panama City Walmart, was taken down after the photo was snapped and shared online this week. As for who was responsible for the idea, Crowson added that &quot;Coke typically approaches Walmart with display ideas, and they either approve or deny it. In this case, Walmart approved the 9/11 display. &quot;</p>
