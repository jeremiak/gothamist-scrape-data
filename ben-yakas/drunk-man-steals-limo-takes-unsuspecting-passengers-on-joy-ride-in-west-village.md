<p>Early this morning, a man crashed into a barrier at One Police Plaza and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427145406/http://gothamist.com/2014/05/16/drunk_driver_nypd_hq.php">was arrested on suspicion of a DWI</a>. That&apos;s pretty messed up, but also pretty run-of-the-mill when it comes to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427145406/http://gothamist.com/tags/dwi">drunk driving arrests.</a> Drunk driving into police headquarters is as easy as it is stupid. But drunkenly running around the West Village stealing limos and taking passengers on joy rides? That&apos;s even stupider, and more reckless.</p>

The driver of the limo had apparently left the car with five passengers (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427145406/http://nypost.com/2014/05/16/drunk-man-takes-tourists-on-terrifying-limo-ride/">the Post says</a> it was four passengers&#x2014; one male and three females, all in their 20&#x2019;s) in it unattended when Elbordiny took opportunity by the horns. </p>

<p>He reportedly ran a red light and drove several blocks before crashing into a car at West 4th Street and West 10th Street. Fortunately there were no injuries. Elbordiny blew a .181 on a blood alcohol test, more than twice the legal driving limit, and was arrested on charges of unauthorized use of a vehicle, reckless endangerment, unlawful imprisonment, criminal possession of controlled substance, DWI, and aggravated unlicensed operator.</p>

<p>As for what happened to the limo driver, we&apos;ve received exclusive footage of his current whereabouts:</p>
