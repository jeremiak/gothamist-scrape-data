<p>Mayor Bloomberg was in the Rockaways today to march in the annual St. Patrick&apos;s Day parade&#x2014;but all reports indicate that it wasn&apos;t a very jolly day for him. Bloomberg was routinely booed during his appearance, to the point that several onlookers noted that mayoral candidate Christine Quinn broke away from walking with him at one point (a Quinn spokesman later told the Post she always intended to walk separately from him). It sounds like residents were irritated at all the mayoral hopefuls and local pols who decided to crash the party. &#x201C;We&#x2019;ve been dying down here, up to our ears in muck trying to rebuild, get back to a regular life,&#x201D; one heckler <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150303143515/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/queens/bloomberg_parade_been_dying_down_BeYxdhhIvhKvr6ri7BT5GL?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20Queens">told the Post</a>. &#x201C;For the politicians to come down here and try to take our celebration and make it their thing...it&#x2019;s disgusting.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Bloomberg is notoriously less popular <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150303143515/http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/politics/2013/03/8075778/outer-borough-parade-season-test-bloomberg-and-de-blasio">in the outer boroughs</a>, but has previously dealt with particularly angry crowds at events <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150303143515/http://gothamist.com/tags/rockaways">in the Rockaways</a> ever since Hurricane Sandy decimated the area. &#x201C;I booed loudly,&#x201D; Margaret Wagner <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150303143515/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/queens/bloomberg-booed-st-patrick-day-parade-rockaways-article-1.1277867">told the News</a>. &#x201C;We had no food, no shelter. People died here, and Bloomberg was on TV talking about a marathon. It&#x2019;s appalling.&#x201D;</p>

<p>There were several signs reading, &#x201C;Mr. Mayor, we need jetties&#x201D; and &#x201C;Listen to the Rockaways.&#x201D; One person also said they tried asking Bloomberg <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150303143515/https://twitter.com/kerrdrizzydrake/status/307933514391769088">for a loan</a>, to no avail, before he scurried away from the event. It wasn&apos;t just Bloomberg who received negative attention: Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer and Public Advocate Bill de Blasio were also reportedly heckled during the event.</p>

<p>If you&apos;re bummed you missed out on today&apos;s parade, or you&apos;re just aching to boo Bloomberg in person, there&apos;ll be plenty more St. Patrick&apos;s Day parades around the city this month&#x2014;Bloomberg will be marching at the 14th Annual Sunnyside St. Patrick&#x2019;s Day Parade in Queens at 2 p.m. tomorrow.</p>
