Former Dept. of Buildings official James Delayo agreed to a 2-6 years plea deal, admitting to selling crane licenses and tests, and pocketing over $10,000 in bribes in the process. Prosecutors explained that among several petty bribes, Delayo dealt largely with Long Island-based crane company, Nu-Way Crane Service, who paid him $3,000 to provide advance copies of the DOB&apos;s crane-licensing exam. But Delayo&apos;s lawyers insist he never put anyone in danger, and had nothing to do with the two major <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426150546/http://gothamist.com/tags/cranecollapse">crane collapses </a>in 2008 which resulted in nine deaths. Crane operator Michael Pascalli and Nu-Way Crane Service head Michael Sackaris are also charged with bribery in the case.<br>
