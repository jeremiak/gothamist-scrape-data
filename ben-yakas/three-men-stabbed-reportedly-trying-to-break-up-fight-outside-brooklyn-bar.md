<p>Police are looking for two suspects who stabbed three men after they stopped to break up a fight outside a Brooklyn bar this weekend.</p>

<p>The incident happened around 4:30 a.m. on Sunday outside El Tequilero Night Club on Coney Island Avenue in Midwood. The three victims (two 27-year-olds and a 30-year-old) were leaving the club when they <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021110930/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/3-men-stabbed-breaking-fight-women-brooklyn-article-1.2787926">reportedly spotted</a> two women fighting. As they intervened, the two suspects got out of a car and attacked them.</p>

<p>The suspects kicked, punched and stabbed the victims: the 30-year-old victim was stabbed once in the stomach, one of the 27-year-old victims was stabbed in the back, and the other 27-year-old victim was stabbed twice in the shoulder. All three were taken to local hospitals in critical but stable condition.<br>
