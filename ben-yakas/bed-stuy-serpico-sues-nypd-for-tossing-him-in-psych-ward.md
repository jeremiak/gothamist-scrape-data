										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="82310schoolcraft.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150107121936im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/82310schoolcraft.jpg" width="250" height="249" class="image-left"> </span>Earlier this year, Officer Adrian Schoolcraft of Brooklyn&apos;s 81st Precinct made <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150107121936/http://gothamist.com/2010/02/02/cops_comes_forward_says_crime_stati.php">headlines</a> when he accused commanding officers of massively under-reporting crime stats. Now, Schoolcraft is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150107121936/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/08/22/2010-08-22_shrink_sez_im_not_crazy_cop.html">suing the NYPD for $50 million</a> for trying to discredit and silence him by throwing him in a psych ward unwillingly, and subsequently suspending him for going &quot;AWOL.&quot; And seeing as how Schoolcraft logged hundreds of hours of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150107121936/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/05/brooklyn_cops_secret_recordings_rel.php">secret recordings</a> of police conversations and meetings, it should come as no surprise that he has recorded evidence to back him up.</p>

<p>Schoolcraft was being <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150107121936/http://nypdconfidential.com/columns/2010/100809.html">treated</a> for various ongoing stress-related ailments for over a year by NYPD psychologist Dr. Catherine Lamstein. According to a recording he made, she told him, &quot;You don&apos;t need a psychiatrist, you need an M.D.&quot; Four days before he was forced into the psych ward, Schoolcraft received a phone message from Lamstein: &quot;As far as I&apos;ve known you, I&apos;ve had no concerns about you hurting yourself or anything like that...I just really want to urge you to return home or call your captain.&quot;</p>

<p>According to his lawyer Jon Norinsberg, the NYPD tried to make him appear unstable to undercut his charges, and Lamstein&apos;s statements prove they had no basis for admitting him to a psych ward: &quot;...the NYPD&apos;s decision to break into Adrian&apos;s home and have him involuntarily committed was not only illegal and unethical, but also a flagrant violation of his constitutional rights,&quot; he said. Schoolcraft has set up a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150107121936/http://schoolcraftjustice.com/">website</a> for other officers to come forward about crime stats and quotas.</p>
