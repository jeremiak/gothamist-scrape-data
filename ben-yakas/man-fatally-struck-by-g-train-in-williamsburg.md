<p>This appears to be the 31st <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130624053400/http://gothamist.com/tags/subwayfatalities">subway fatality</a> of 2013, and at least the 79th person struck by a train. NYC is on pace to exceed the 2012 totals, when 141 people were hit by trains, and 55 were killed. </p>
