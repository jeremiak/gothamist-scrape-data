<p>It&apos;s starting to feel like a rite of passage that every time there&apos;s a major inroad made to reform the controversial <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150225012726/http://gothamist.com/tags/stopandfrisk">stop-and-frisk</a> police policy, anonymous cops <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150225012726/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/13/ny_posts_police_sources_probably_sh.php">will go to the NY Post to complain about it</a>. As <em>Battlestar Galactica</em> put it: &quot;All this has happened before, and all this will happen again.&quot; But <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150225012726/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/not_busting_our_humps_cops_WazplU7FKqAXtwXh8cCvnO">today&apos;s bitchfest is particularly alarmist</a>: &quot;Crime is about to skyrocket. We are going to show up and take reports. This was the safest city in the country...Now most crimes will go unsolved.&quot; </p>

<p>Yes, society as we know it is about to collapse, and it&apos;s all because this week the City Council overrode Mayor Bloomberg&apos;s vetoes, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150225012726/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/22/council_overrides_mayors_vetoes_blo.php">affirming the passage of two laws</a> that will strengthen <em>existing</em> profiling bans, allow citizens to meaningfully <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150225012726/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/12/federal_judge_stop_frisk_violates_u.php">challenge discriminatory police practices</a>, and install an Inspector General to broadly review NYPD policy and make recommendations. Following this, a memo was sent to police stations around the city stating:</p>

<blockquote>All officers should take action if he or she sees a crime in progress, or if he or she sees that his or her life or the life of another person is in danger...[But] all officers should be careful not to initiate any law-enforcement action that could be construed as violating the new legislation and subject the officer to legal action. </blockquote>

<p>And several unnamed &quot;police sources&quot; (it&apos;s hard to tell how many the Post talked to) say this means that no police work will get done from here on out: &#x201C;These rookies are just getting on the job out of college,&quot; one source said. &quot;They&#x2019;re not going to risk their pensions. Arrests are going to drop, and crime&#x2019;s going to soar. It really puts a wrench into law enforcement. They&#x2019;re going to be second-guessing everything they do.&quot; </p>

<p>One &quot;source&quot; went as far as to say that if they have a description of a suspect and it&apos;s a black male, they&apos;re not going to pursue much farther than that: &#x201C;If someone gets raped and says it was a black male, I&#x2019;m going to be handicapped to stop someone because I could get sued for racial profiling. So now I&#x2019;m just going to take reports,&#x201D; the cop said.</p>

<p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m not stopping a soul,&#x201D; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150225012726/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/not_busting_our_humps_cops_WazplU7FKqAXtwXh8cCvnO/1">said another cop</a> who perhaps should consider another line of employment. &quot;You think any cop with a functioning brain is going to risk getting a lawsuit or losing their pension?&quot; And then there&apos;s the &quot;police source&quot; who claims that &quot;bad guys&quot; know that this is their chance to pillage NYC:</p>

<blockquote>Even the bad guys have gotten the memo.

<p>&#x201C;Perps on the street are saying, &#x2018;If they&#x2019;re not going to stop me, I&#x2019;m going to start carrying [my gun] again.&#x2019; That&#x2019;s the word on the street,&#x201D; said one police source.</p>

<p>&#x201C;The number of stops is going to go way down, and crime is going to go way up. Shootings and murders are going to come back big time,&#x201D; the source said.</p>

<p>&#x201C;Now all these guys who weren&#x2019;t carrying guns are going to carry again, because they know we can&#x2019;t stop them. The first thing a perp is going to say is, &#x2018;You can&#x2019;t stop me, I&#x2019;m going to sue you,&#x2019; a second source agreed.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>Perhaps Mayor Bloomberg is one of these anonymous sources: he&apos;s continued to badmouth the City Council since the vote. &quot;It&apos;s election-year politicking rather than common sense in terms of what&apos;s right for the city,&quot; he said <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150225012726/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/bloomberg-overrides-election-year-politicking-article-1.1435601">during his radio appearance on Friday</a>. But he vowed to keep fighting in the courts: &#x201C;We believe that we have a very good case in court that state law is what determines criminal procedures and not city law, and so we will certainly appeal that,&#x201D; Bloomberg said.</p>
