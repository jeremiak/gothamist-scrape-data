<p>There were no bedbug scares or subway condoms to contend with, but the subway remained the weirdest and potentially wondrous public setting for New Yorkers in 2016. On any given day, you could spot Emma Watson <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161222183848/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/09/emma_watson_will_be_leaving_books_a.php">leaving books under seats</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161222183848/http://gothamist.com/2016/07/20/complacency_urged.php">dogs in backpacks</a>, time travelers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161222183848/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/05/photo_virtual_reality_straphanger_d.php">from our dystopian future</a>, or even the rare <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161222183848/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/09/subway_poop_car_viral.php">empty train car.</a> Just as with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161222183848/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/31/subway_2015_best_worst.php">previous years</a>, we&apos;ve taken a look back at some of the most unforgettable subway moments of the year that was.</p>

<p><strong>Ratstaking And Ratsgiving:</strong> 2016 started with Gothamist&apos;s exclusive investigation<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161222183848/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/07/journalism.php"> into Zardulu, Pizza Rat and the world of mysterious YouTube hoaxes</a>. The Washington Post <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161222183848/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2016/12/14/she-staged-a-viral-story-you-fell-for-her-hoax-she-thinks-thats-beautiful/?utm_term=.8854916196d5">eventually caught on</a> and confirmed our suspicions, but that didn&apos;t do much to stop a bunch more viral rats coming into our lives, including <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161222183848/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/16/video_pita_rat.php">Pita Rat</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161222183848/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/03/cannibal_rat.php">Cannibal Rat</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161222183848/http://gothamist.com/2016/09/21/pizza_rat_meet_pizza_rag.php">Pizza Rag</a>, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161222183848/http://gothamist.com/2016/12/19/nyc_subway_escalator_rat.php">Escalator Rat</a>. Regardless of what is or isn&apos;t a real viral rat, you should still be wary of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161222183848/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/30/because_rats_want_to_snuggle.php">very real rats commandeering your body</a> while snoozing on the subway. </p>

<p><strong>New Yorkers Just Missing The Subway</strong>: There is no quintessential NYC experience quite like running down a subway station platform with your arms flapping all about like a distressed penguin, making eye contact with the conductor, and then hesitantly stretching out your hand to try to slip between the doors before they close. Sometimes it works, and sometimes, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161222183848/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/21/never_stop_for_coffee_on_the_way.php">as in the video below</a>, it does not. </p>

<p><strong>The Great Manspreading Debate:</strong> There were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161222183848/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/14/manspreading_apologia.php">manspreading apologists</a>; there were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161222183848/http://gothamist.com/2016/12/09/manspreading_studied.php">manspreading studies</a>; there were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161222183848/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/29/making_manspreading_great_again.php">defiant manspreaders;</a> there were even <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161222183848/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/27/subway_brawl_manspreading.php">manspreading brawls</a>. But one thing became crystal clear: despite the MTA&apos;s public etiquette campaign and our own attempts at righting the social order, men can&apos;t stop, won&apos;t stop spreading.</p>

<p><strong>Second Avenue Subway/Return Of The W Train:</strong> We can&apos;t believe it either. As recently as last week, we were prepared for the project to be delayed well into 2017. But Governor Cuomo says the first ceremonial ride on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161222183848/http://gothamist.com/tags/secondavenuesubway">Second Avenue Subway</a> is really happening on December 31st. Coupled with the return of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161222183848/http://gothamist.com/tags/wtrain">W train</a>, this was a very good year for railfans.</p>

<p><strong>Subway Etiquette Fight Club:</strong> The philosophical battle over subway etiquette, one which we&apos;ve documented in great detail over the years, finally turned physical this year, with multiple fights being sparked. There were fist fights <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161222183848/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/27/subway_brawl_manspreading.php">over manspreading</a>, someone was stabbed over <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161222183848/http://gothamist.com/2016/05/01/straphanger_stabbed_after_fight_ove.php">a seat dispute</a>, two teens attacked an elderly lady who asked them to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161222183848/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/04/teen_girls_beat_up_elderly_woman_af.php">remove their feet from the seat</a>, and a teen allegedly slashed a straphanger who complained about him <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161222183848/http://gothamist.com/2016/08/25/teen_arrested_for_slashing_straphan.php">blocking the turnstiles.</a></p>

<p><strong>The Biggest Subway Jerk Of 2016:</strong> The video has long since been removed, but thankfully, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161222183848/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/13/if_this_is_zardulu_too_its_war.php">we wrote out a play-by-play</a> of straphangers standing up to a giant doofus (&quot;Saint Butt&quot;) who insisted on smoking cigarettes on the F train.</p>

<p><strong>Subway Heroes Join Forces To Rescue A Man From The Tracks:</strong> In June, a group of good Samaritans <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161222183848/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/10/see_it_subway_rescue.php">rescued a man who fell into the subway tracks</a> in lower Manhattan, pulling him out minutes before a train pulled into the station. CUNY student Sumeja Tulic was on the platform during the incident and documented the brave rescue effort. It&apos;s always inspiring to see New Yorkers coming together in a crisis to help someone in need.</p>
