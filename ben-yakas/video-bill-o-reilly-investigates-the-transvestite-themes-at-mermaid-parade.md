<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130718132232/http://gothamist.com/tags/mermaidparade">Coney Island Mermaid Parade</a> is by far one of our favorite NYC traditions, a jubilantly theatrical event famous for drawing thousands of eccentric personalities in wildly elaborate costumes to the historic boardwalk. So the idea of Bill O&apos;Reilly&#x2014;a man who doesn&apos;t have the greatest history when it comes to dealing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130718132232/http://mediamatters.org/research/2009/05/12/oreillys-ark-gay-marriage-could-lead-to-goat-du/150069">with diversity</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130718132232/http://equalitymatters.org/blog/201306040002">discrimination</a>&#x2014;sending one of his flacks to cover the parade didn&apos;t fill us with much confidence.

<p>After the segment, O&apos;Reilly asks why gay people need so many parades, and asks straight-faced: &quot;Well was that the prevailing theme here? Crossing dressing, transvestite people?&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130718132232/http://www.mediaite.com/tv/bill-oreilly-telling-a-gay-person-youre-going-to-hell-should-be-against-the-law/">One step forward</a>, two steps back.</p>
