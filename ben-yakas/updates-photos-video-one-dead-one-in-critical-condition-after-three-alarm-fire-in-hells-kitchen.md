<p><strong>Update</strong>: According to the FDNY, two people have been critically injured in the blaze. A spokesman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160405071219/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/critically-injured-massive-fire-midtown-manhattan-high-rise-article-1.1566819?utm_content=buffere8ea8&amp;utm_source=buffer&amp;utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=Buffer">also told the News</a> that the blaze started on the 20th floor.</p>

<p>Also, Rickey Gervais was relieved Atwal was okay.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: One person has died while another is in critical condition due to the fire. A police source <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160405071219/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/critically-injured-massive-fire-midtown-manhattan-high-rise-article-1.1566819?utm_content=buffere8ea8&amp;utm_source=buffer&amp;utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=Buffer">told the News</a> that a 27-year-old suffered from cardiac arrest during the fire, and was pronounced dead at Roosevelt Hospital. A 32-year-old suffered smoke inhalation and is still in critical condition.</p>

<p>&quot;Unfortunately, in this fire, it appears that the victims may had been originally inside in their apartments safe and exited the apartments and become the victims in the stairwells themselves,&quot; said Assistant Fire Chief John Sudhik. Several other residents, and four firefighters, had minor injuries, but none were critical. It took over an hour and a half for about 150 firefighters to get the blaze under control. It&apos;s still not clear what sparked the fire.</p>
