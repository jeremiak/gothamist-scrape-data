<p>Former police officer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150103064803/http://gothamist.com/tags/michaelpena">Michael Pena</a> was sentenced to 75 years in prison for sexually assaulting a then-25-year-old school teacher at gunpoint while off-duty in Manhattan in August 2011. Less than two years later, Pena is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150103064803/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/rapist-ex-nypd-asks-shorten-75-year-prison-term-article-1.1610805">trying to get his sentence significantly reduced</a>, based on the argument that raping someone is not the <em>worst</em> thing, ya&apos; know. &quot;[Pena] was punished more harshly than Al Qaeda terrorists, vicious killers, kingpin narcotics offenders, violent gangsters and racketeers,&quot; wrote Pena&apos;s lawyer, Ephraim Savitt.</p>

<p>Savitt writes that the sentence was &quot;politically motivated and media-intensified vengeance,&quot; complaining that a first-time offender was given &quot;three times the mandatory minimum sentence for murder.&quot; He had the balls to call the sentence an &quot;injustice.&quot; Savitt had asked the judge for a 10-year-sentence for his client, and at most 15 to 20 years. &#x201C;Even in cases of rape by serial rapists, or of brutal thugs that physically beat and slash their victims, punishment has been generally considerably lower than Pena&#x2019;s sentence,&#x201D; Savitt wrote.</p>

<p>Legal experts <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150103064803/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/rapist-ex-nypd-asks-shorten-75-year-prison-term-article-1.1610805">tell the News</a> that Savitt has a shot at his appeal: Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Richard Carruthers &#x201C;is a very well-respected judge, and it&#x2019;s a horrible crime, but 75 to life is a brute of a sentence,&quot; explained Ed Hayes. </p>

<p>Carruthers had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150103064803/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/16/gunpoint_rape_cop_gets_another_10_y.php">added on 10 more years</a> to Pena&apos;s sentence after the verdict, to be served concurrently with the other 75 years. He explained that was to spare the victim: &quot;This sentence in no way reflects the seriousness or the grievous nature of his crimes...[it was] for one reason and for one reason only. That is to spare the victim from having to confront her attacker again.&quot; </p>

<p>The initial jury had a mistrial over the rape charges, in spite of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150103064803/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/28/mistrial_declared_in_gunpoint_rape.php">victim and witness testimony</a>, as well as testimony from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150103064803/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/15/arresting_officers_were_disgusted_b.php">a disgusted arresting officer</a>. Lydia Cuomo, the woman who was raped by Pena, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150103064803/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/11/teacher_raped_by_nypd_cop_goes_publ.php">came forward a year after the trial</a> to convince Albany to put anal and oral penetration into the New York State definition of rape.</p>

<p>The News asked her how she felt about his current appeal: &quot;Seventy-five years? I still have my entire life with this and I did nothing to ask for it.&quot;</p>
