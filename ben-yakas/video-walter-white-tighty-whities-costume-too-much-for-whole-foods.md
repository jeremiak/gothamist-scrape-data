<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508154507/http://gothamist.com/tags/breakingbad"><em>Breaking Bad</em></a> exploded in popularity over its final season this summer, so it&apos;s no surprise that Walter White was a particularly popular <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508154507/http://gothamist.com/tags/halloween">Halloween</a> costume choice this year. However, not everyone was as delighted with running into Heisenberg as we were: videographer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508154507/https://twitter.com/VaughnVance">Vaughn Vance</a> was kicked out of Whole Foods because of his tighty whities costume yesterday. &quot;I can assure you I have seen females in shorter shorts prancing around and no man has ever considered that illegal!&quot; his friend Carley H. told us.</p>

<p>The two co-workers had gone to the Whole Foods on Bowery for food, but they didn&apos;t get very far into the store before they were stopped: &quot;I didn&apos;t quite make it through the produce section before security stopped me (very politely) and said to me, &apos;Mr. White,&apos; (I love that he addressed me by character) &apos;I&apos;m sorry, but I need to check with my manager before you can go in, sir,&apos;&quot; Vance told us. The store manager told them they were not allowed in the store because Vance&apos;s outfit was against store policy. &quot;Meanwhile customers were begging Carlos to just let them take picture of Walt before they kicked him out,&quot; Carley added. You can see video of the incident below.</p>

<p><iframe src="//web.archive.org/web/20150508154507if_/http://player.vimeo.com/video/78364727" width="640" height="1120" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen></iframe> </p><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508154507/http://vimeo.com/78364727">IMG 9406</a> from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508154507/http://vimeo.com/gothamist">Gothamist</a> on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508154507/https://vimeo.com/">Vimeo</a>.</p><p></p>

<p>That customer, who you can see in the video, &quot;was very persistent about getting a picture on his phone,&quot; Vance said. &quot;I appreciated this man&apos;s enthusiasm for the costume and I wanted to oblige.&quot; Although he was kicked out, Vance says that Whole Foods &quot;acted professionally and I completely understand why I was turned away.&quot; But they obviously were feeling a bit sorry about the whole thing, since they later apologized on Twitter:</p>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508154507/https://twitter.com/MarcJacobsIntl">@MarcJacobsIntl</a> So sorry about that...pants are pretty essential when selling food! :) LOVE the costume <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508154507/https://twitter.com/VaughnVance">@VaughnVance</a>!</p>&#x2014; Whole Foods Market (@WholeFoods) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508154507/https://twitter.com/WholeFoods/statuses/396309837715628032">November 1, 2013</a></blockquote>

<p>&quot;Overall, I was very surprised about the city&apos;s enthusiasm for the costume,&quot; Vance added. &quot;People stopped me left and right for pictures and aimed cameras at me from cabs and bikes. Construction workers were howling (which I somehow found flattering).&quot;</p>

<p>Vance of course wasn&apos;t the only Walter White running around the city in tighty whities yesterday:</p>
