<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:250px; "> <img alt="111010goodstuff.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811090551im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/111010goodstuff.jpg" width="250" height="120"> <br> <i>Former partners-in-crime Earle Barranco and Corey Scott</i></div> <p></p>

<p>Earle Barranco, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811090551/http://gothamist.com/2010/10/24/more_bad_stuff_on_good_stuff_diner.php">suspect</a> in the Good Stuff Diner murder last month who prefers his moneybag necklaces to be diamond-studded, was arrested earlier this week after he popped up <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811090551/http://gothamist.com/2010/11/09/cops_spotted_good_stuff_diner_kille.php">on a JumboTron</a> at a Charlotte Bobcats game. His clear inability to keep a low profile caught up with him, and he now faces extradition to NY to stand trial for the murder of Corey Scott, aka &quot;Young Classik.&quot; Up till now, it&apos;s been unclear as to what the motive behind the murder was; but it seems that Barranco and Scott were partners-in-crime who had a serious falling out.</p>

<p>The two men allegedly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811090551/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2010/11/09/2010-11-09_earle_barranco_suspect_in_manhattan_diner_slay_accused_of_killing_alleged_partne.html">ran a financial scam</a> in NYC that had caught the eye of the FBI. They befriended bank tellers or had friends apply for jobs at banks in the city; the tellers would steal money from accounts for them, give them Social Security numbers for identity theft and cash forged corporate checks. The tellers were paid almost nothing ($50 or $60) for sticking their necks out, but Barranco and Scott were able to make up to $60,000 from the scam. </p>

<p>However, as it goes in every great crime movie, one of the partners got greedy&#x2014;Barranco started to run his own rackets, and cut Scott out. &quot;The suspect was starting to do this on his own and the victim said, &apos;Hey, whatever you do I need my cut.&apos; That&apos;s what we think this was about,&quot; a source told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811090551/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2010/11/09/2010-11-09_earle_barranco_suspect_in_manhattan_diner_slay_accused_of_killing_alleged_partne.html">the Daily News</a>. Barranco was sitting in the Good Stuff Diner on October 23 when Scott <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811090551/http://gothamist.com/2010/10/23/man_killed_in_union_square_diner_sh.php">came in to confront him</a> about the betrayal, armed with a 9-mm. pistol. After an argument, Barranco shot him dead, and fled the city, eluding police for two weeks before being apprehended in Charlotte.</p>
