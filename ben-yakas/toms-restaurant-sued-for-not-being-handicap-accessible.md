<p>Tom&apos;s Restaurant is one of the longest running family-owned diners still around, and has been a mainstay of Morningside Heights since the 1940&apos;s. More importantly, Tom&apos;s is Monk&apos;s Cafe from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425173022/http://gothamist.com/tags/seinfeld"><em>Seinfeld,</em></a> making it a NYC institution (regardless of how you feel about the food). Oh, and more relevant to the story at hand: it&apos;s completely handicap-inaccessible. <strike>Not that there&apos;s anything wrong with that</strike> Yeah, there&apos;s probably something wrong with that.</p>

<p>Sixty-eight year-old Carolyn Coleman, who has been wheelchair-bound since 1996, has filed a lawsuit against Tom&apos;s for not being handicap friendly. Coleman claims she can&apos;t eat at the restaurant &quot;because there&#x2019;s no way I can get inside or maneuver.&quot;</p>

<p>Manuel Papas, a Tom&apos;s manager, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425173022/http://nypost.com/2014/08/15/seinfeld-diner-sued-for-not-being-handicap-friendly/">admitted to the Post</a>, &quot;We no have access for handicapped. But we have tables outside, though, that they can use. It&#x2019;s not a problem in the summertime.&quot; As you can see in the photos, Tom&apos;s has had outdoor seating for the last couple years, emblazoned with the names of the <em>Seinfeld</em> characters. But there is no ramp to get through the door.</p>

<p>Coleman is seeking more than $30,000 in damages and a court order that would force Tom&#x2019;s to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act. She also is probably looking forward to getting one of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425173022/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/27/the_best_diners_in_new_york_city.php">best diner milkshakes in the city.</a></p>
