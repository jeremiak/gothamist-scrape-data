<p>A Brooklyn man was fatally stabbed during a street fight in Bedford-Stuyvesant last week. According to police, the incident happened around 12:40 a.m. last Saturday night, when 37-year-old Mario Chevy got into a fight with an as-yet unidentified man on Hart Street. The suspect punched Chevy, threw him into a gate, then took a knife out of his boot and stabbed him several times. You can see video of the confrontation below.</p>

Chevy was taken to Woodhull Medical Center in critical condition, where he later died. Police haven&apos;t said if they know what the fight was about; police are also trying to identify the SUV shown in the beginning of the video which passes down the street, reverses, and then speeds away.</p>
