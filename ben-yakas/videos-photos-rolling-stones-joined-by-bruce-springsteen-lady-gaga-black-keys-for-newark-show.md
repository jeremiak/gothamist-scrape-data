After being taken out of storage earlier this fall, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170626151602/http://gothamist.com/tags/rollingstones">The Rolling Stones</a> played the last show of their brief-but-thoroughly entertaining &quot;50 and Counting&quot; Tour at Newark&apos;s Prudential Center last night. And they didn&apos;t come alone: Bruce Springsteen (&quot;Tumbling Dice&quot;), Lady Gaga (&quot;Gimme Shelter&quot;), The Black Keys (&quot;Who Do You Love&quot;), John Mayer (&quot;Going Down&quot;), and former guitarist Mick Taylor (&quot;Midnight Rambler&quot;) all joined the band for the 23-song set. You can check out photos above, and videos of some of those collaborations below&#x2014;watch them while they&apos;re still up!</p>

<p>A gruff-voiced Springsteen joined the Stones for <em>Exile On Main Street</em> classic &quot;Tumbling Dice.&quot;</p>

<p>Lady Gaga was the featured guest on &quot;Gimme Shelter,&quot; literally dancing like she had ants in her pants.</p>

<p>Jagger also paid tribute to the victims of the Newtown elementary school shooting at one point:</p>

<p>You can check out the full setlist from last night below. The Stones <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170626151602/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/09/photos_videos_rolling_stones_rock_b.php#photo-1">played Barclays Center</a> last week, and Newark on Thursday. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170626151602/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/13/videos_photos_all-star_musicians_br.php">They also performed</a> two songs at the massive 12-12-12: The Concert For Sandy Relief (and got a little flack <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170626151602/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/13/are_you_outraged_by_mick_jaggers_po.php">for a throwaway Jagger joke</a>). Although this was the last show of this tour, there are now rumors that the Stones <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170626151602/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/rolling-stones-to-play-coachella-20121214">might play Coachella in 2013.</a></p>
