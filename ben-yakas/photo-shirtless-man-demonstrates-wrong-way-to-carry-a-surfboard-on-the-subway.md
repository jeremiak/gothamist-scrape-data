										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="9813surfboard.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150328003742im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/9813surfboard.jpg" width="640" height="480" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>Earlier this summer, we published <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150328003742/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/09/subway_surfboard.php">a surfboard etiquette guide</a>, to help save boarding fanatics from pissing off their fellow straphangers and incurring online subway shaming. But some people&#x2014;like the inexplicably shirtless man in the photos above who rode the A train on Friday&#x2014;just don&apos;t want to listen. </p>

<p>A tipster told us he spotted the man around 6 p.m. as he was leaving work in Tribeca to go to the Yankees game. &quot;You can imagine the A line is packed and this bro decides he is going to come back from surfing and take up the whole subway car,&quot; the tipster said. &quot;First of all. Where the hell was he surfing. Second of all where is is shirt and why the hell is he sleeping on his board? Rough day surfing?&quot; Maybe he really was just tuckered out from a hard day of surfing! </p>

<p>There&apos;s also another possibility: this <em>could</em> be very strategic viral marketing for the surfboard company. It wasn&apos;t hot out that day, certainly not shirtless weather. So either he is totally committed to the brah lifestyle, he had a bit of a mental breakdown, or he was getting paid to sit somewhere very public as a bit of &quot;fun viral marketing.&quot; In case that is what this is, we&apos;ve gone ahead and preemptively blacked out the name of the surfboard company.</p>
