										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="42711circumcision.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170322182107im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/42711circumcision.jpg" width="250" height="188" class="image-left"> </span>Intactivism is the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170322182107/http://www.circumstitions.com/#pro-intact">belief in</a> the right of baby boys to keep their foreskins intact, and there&apos;s a movement to legally ban circumcision. After <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170322182107/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/blogs/cityinsider/detail?entry_id=77266">introducing</a> legislation last year, a San Francisco-based group of intactivists opposing male circumcision <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170322182107/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/2011/04/27/2011-04-27_circumcision_under_attack_as_group_seeks_to_ban_the_practice_in_san_francisco.html?r=news/national">has collected</a> enough signatures for a ballot initiative next November on whether to bar the practice in the city. &quot;<strong>It&apos;s excruciatingly painful and permanently damaging surgery that&apos;s forced on men when they&apos;re at their weakest and most vulnerable</strong>,&quot; said Lloyd Schofield, one of the chief opponents.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170322182107/http://www.sfmgmbill.org/Site/Home.html">ordinance</a> would outlaw the procedure throughout San Francisco, making it a crime to circumcise a boy before he is 18 years of age, even for religious reasons; the only exception would be for &quot;compelling and immediate medical need.&quot; Schofield&apos;s group submitted approximately 12,000 signatures supporting the proposed ban. But experts say that even if such a measure were to pass, it would likely be quickly overturned as an unconstitutional attack on religious freedom. &quot;The practice of Judaism requires a boy to be circumcised. I suspect the California courts would ultimately require the city to demonstrate the practice is harmful. I don&apos;t think there&apos;s sufficient medical evidence that it is, which would place the law&apos;s constitutionality in question,&quot; said Jennifer Rothman, a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles.</p>

<p>The intactivist movement has been gaining steam for several years; back in 2005, NYC health officials <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170322182107/http://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/26/nyregion/26circumcise.html">began questioning</a> some aspects to the circumcision tradition after a mohel was accused of transmitting herpes to three baby boys, killing one. Intactivists <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170322182107/http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/31448.php">criticized Mayor Bloomberg</a> for compromising public safety &quot;to curry favor with the Orthodox Jewish community,&quot; and called on the city to regulate circumcision, arguing that it violates children&apos;s rights. However, in 2007, the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene went in the other direction, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170322182107/http://gothamist.com/2007/04/05/nyc_wants_you_c.php">promoting circumcision</a> as a way to reduce the spread of AIDS (though Bloomberg <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170322182107/http://gothamist.com/2007/04/06/mayor_circumspe.php">distanced himself</a> somewhat from the initiative).</p>

<p>Despite the worldwide campaign, the rate of circumcision among American baby boys <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170322182107/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/17/health/research/17circ.html?ref=health">declined over</a> the last half of the 00s decade. It&apos;s an issue that is still protected in NYC, but is always controversial&#x2014;NY Magazine had a feature on the practice a few years ago, with more pros and cons <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170322182107/http://nymag.com/health/features/60158/">to peruse</a>. It&apos;s highly unlikely any such measure could gain a foothold here...but then again, who would have thought we&apos;d follow in San Francisco&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170322182107/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/blogs/cityinsider/detail?entry_id=77247">footsteps</a> by trying to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170322182107/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/05/city_council_health_commissioner_wi.php">neuter Happy Meals</a>?</p>
