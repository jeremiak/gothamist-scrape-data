										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:365px; "> <img alt="32311weiner.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509002033im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/32311weiner.jpg" width="365" height="369"> <br> <i>Rep. Anthony Weiner</i></div> In honor of the one year anniversary of Obamacare passing, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509002033/http://gothamist.com/tags/anthonyweiner">Rep. Anthony Weiner</a> has decreed today, &quot;Ask Me Shit On Social Media Day.&quot; He is taking questions all day on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509002033/http://twitter.com/RepWeiner/status/50395963390566401">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509002033/http://www.facebook.com/AnthonyDWeiner">Facebook</a>, Daily Kos, and most amusingly, in the AMA section <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509002033/http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/g9pcr/iama_democrat_who_fights_rep_anthony_weiner_dny/">of Reddit</a>, which has already generated well over a thousand comments in the last hour. Because where else could you get questions such as, &quot;Have you considered going into humorous porn? (GET IT EVERYONE? WEINER JOKES)&quot; ?<p></p>

<p>So far, the redditors have been mostly well-behaved (many have taken to referring to each other as &quot;the gentleman...&quot;) and asked serious questions, including many queries about his stance on Israel (including why he  &quot;unconditionally&quot; supports the state), about health care, campaign finance reform, marijuana laws, whether he has mayoral aspirations, and what it was like rooming with Jon Stewart (&quot;sexy leftist underwear political debate slumber parties&quot;). Weiner said he&apos;ll be back at 5:30 pm to answer questions and comment for an hour. We certainly hope he has time to address  this question from NYC Hound:</p>

<blockquote>Hi, fellow Brooklynite here. Not sure if you read the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509002033/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/05/mayor_weiners_first_act_would_aboli.php">recent Gothamist post</a> that quotes you as having said to Mayor Bloomberg:

<p>&quot;When I become mayor, you know what I&#x2019;m going to spend my first year doing? I&apos;m going to have a bunch of ribbon-cuttings tearing out your fucking bike lanes.&quot;</p>

<p>First question: Will you be running for NYC mayor in the future?</p>

<p>Second question: Did you really say that? Because a lot of people rely on cycling as a mode of transportation both for financial and principle reasons, and safe routes are key. Not to mention promoting cycling would reduce automobile traffic and emissions.</p></blockquote><p></p>
