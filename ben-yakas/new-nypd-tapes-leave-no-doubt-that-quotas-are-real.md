But over the last year, between accusations made by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150107122342/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/03/cop_claims_nypd_quota_is_20_summons.php">Officer Adil Polanco</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150107122342/http://gothamist.com/tags/adrianschoolcraft">Officer Adrian Schoolcraft</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150107122342/http://gothamist.com/2010/08/27/new_report_claims_nypd_heads_manipu.php">studies</a> by criminologists, it&apos;s getting harder and harder to believe New York&apos;s Finest. Today, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150107122342/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/10/nyregion/10quotas.html?_r=1&amp;ref=nyregion">another batch of secret recordings</a> made in a police station in Brooklyn lends even more credibility to the existence of quotas.</p>

<p>The recordings were made by an officer in Brooklyn&apos;s 81st precinct, the same one where Schoolcraft worked and made his secret recordings. This latest recording dates to April 1st, and make it clear that precinct commanders were focused on raising the number of summonses issued, even though Schoolcraft&apos;s accusations had already hit the newspapers, and the NYPD was investigating whether crime stats were being manipulated in that precinct. One captain, Alex Perez, can be heard giving tips on how officers should get their stats: he says that each officer on a day tour should write 20 summonses a week&#x2014;five each for double-parking, parking at a bus stop, driving without a seat belt and driving while using a cellphone.</p>

<p>And if the cops didn&apos;t perform, well, Perez said, &quot;What I plan on doing &#x2014; three cops are getting bounced to midnights, and three midnight cops are getting bounced to day tours. I don&#x2019;t care about people&#x2019;s families, if they don&#x2019;t want to do their job. <strong>Their paycheck is taking care of their family. If they don&#x2019;t realize that, they&#x2019;re going to change their tour; they&#x2019;re going to start being productive if they want a tour that works for their family.</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>The officer who made the recording gave it to Schoolcraft&#x2019;s lawyer, Jon L. Norinsberg, who said,&quot;He wanted to do anything in his power to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150107122342/http://gothamist.com/2010/08/23/real-life_serpico_sues_nypd_for_tos.php">support Schoolcraft</a>, and I think this is his way of corroborating Schoolcraft&#x2019;s allegations...<strong>It is evidence the quota system is ongoing. Subsequent to the public revelations that have taken place, it&#x2019;s business as usual in the N.Y.P.D</strong>.&quot; </p>
