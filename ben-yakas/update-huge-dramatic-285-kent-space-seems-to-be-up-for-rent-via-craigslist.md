<p>It&apos;s been a little over a week since 285 Kent went to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408152402/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/20/photos_285_kents_last_show_ever.php#photo-1">the big rock venue in the sky</a> along with Maxwell&apos;s, the Fillmore East, and countless others. The spirit of DIY scruff may have been snuffed out, but the physical building must find a new owner. To that end, the building <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408152402/http://newyork.craigslist.org/brk/off/4310138861.html">has popped up on Craigslist in the last day.</a> And it can be yours for just $8,000/a month, or approximately $96K for a year.</p>

<p>We&apos;ve contacted lease owner Todd P to confirm that the listing (you can see it below) for the &quot;converted 1930&apos;s-era Internationalist-style dry goods warehouse&quot; is real. Former curator <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408152402/https://twitter.com/ricleichtung">Ric Leichtung</a> told us that &quot;this is the first I&apos;m hearing about it. I would never put 285 Kent up for sale, not that I even could.&quot; </p>

<p>The &quot;industrially photogenic room,&quot; which includes FREE HEAT, is listed as &quot;Creative/Loft&quot; that can also be used as &quot;Office Building, Office Showroom, Flex Space.&quot; There&apos;s no direct mention of its past as a hot and gross musical mecca, though the listing does note, &quot;Quiet block by day, and <strong>you can make all the noise in the world at night if you desire</strong> - no residential neighbors.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Perfect for any kind of commercial use, pop-up store, architect&apos;s studio, a photographer&apos;s studio, etc... or an amazingly well-located loft space.&quot; Hmm, or maybe someone can figure out a way to turn it into some sort of, I don&apos;t know, music space?</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: Todd P sent us this statement about the future of 285 Kent:</p>

<blockquote>A few people seem all up an arms about this, and while this particular ad is not my doing, so what if it had been? The place closed for good reason: it couldn&apos;t be made &quot;legal&quot; and people were going to end up in jail if it kept operating, plus would have seen their legal records tarnished against running &quot;legit&quot; spaces in the future... now that&apos;s one thing if that happens to me or to Ric Leichtung, but if it happens to the staff that&apos;s really not acceptable. But you know what, it&apos;s over. It has to become something else now. New York City is expensive for rent, Williamsburg especially, and this space is actually cheap, sadly. But either way, it&apos;s not like we can put a exhibition rope around it and preserve it as a museum.

<p>This ad was a real estate agent acquaintance who has helped rent art spaces for me in the past, putting out feelers on his own to see if such a thing generated interest, attempting to convince me to try one route in utilizing the room. No one was shown the space, and it was solely hypothetical. I have other options. But, it&apos;s always good to test waters. Anyway, it&apos;s absolutely nothing to be ashamed of either way, the show space is no longer and the rent must be paid. This &quot;scandal&quot; is silly.</p></blockquote><p></p>
