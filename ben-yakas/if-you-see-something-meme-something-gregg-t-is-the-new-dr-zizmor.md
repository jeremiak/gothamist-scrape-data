title: If You See Something, Meme Something: Gregg T. Is The New Dr. Zizmor

<p>A terrible darkness has cast a shadow over the soul of NYC ever since <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170630151614/http://gothamist.com/tags/drzizmor">Dr. Jonathon Zizmor</a>, NYC&apos;s foremost subway dermatologist-slash-pop culture reference, hung up his skincare specialist gloves and announced his retirement <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170630151614/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/04/zizmor_no_more.php">earlier this year.</a> Far and wide, New Yorkers cried out: what local subway personality will rise up to take his place? Considering we can barely even remember <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170630151614/http://gothamist.com/2014/02/07/lucas_talks_venmo_subway_ads_the_ab.php">Lucas from Venmo</a>, is it possible that no one could fill Dr. Zizmor&apos;s shoes?  </p>

<p>But one man heard those cries and decided to do something&#x2014;or, more specifically, <em>say something</em> (and then allow his face to be plastered on every train in the greater NYC area). Gregg T., aka Gregg Turkin, a registered attorney in New York and part of the NYPD&apos;s Legal Bureau, has become THE face of the MTA&apos;s &quot;New Yorkers Keep New York Safe&quot; safety ad campaign (in which real NYers offer first person accounts about identifying suspicious packages). And people can&apos;t get enough of him. </p>

<p>Turkin previously served as Nassau County&apos;s Assistant District Attorney; in one landmark case, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170630151614/http://www.nytimes.com/2002/12/07/nyregion/long-island-man-found-guilty-of-63-counts-in-sex-torture-of-teenager.html">he prosecuted Long Island man James Warren</a>, who was found guilty of 63 assorted charges of kidnapping, rape, sodomy, sexual abuse, assault and endangering the welfare of a child.</p>

<p>But he&apos;s become even more famous for calling in a report of some &quot;disconcerting&quot; vehicles parked near a LIRR station. Here&apos;s the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170630151614/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/21/mta_updates_prolific_see_something.php">MTA ad from March</a> that launched a thousand memes:</p>

<p>What started as a whisper has turned into a scream. Across the five boroughs, and into the suburban areas where Metro-North serves, Gregg T. has slowly slipped into legend. There are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170630151614/https://twitter.com/Gregg_from_LIRR">fake Twitter accounts</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170630151614/https://www.facebook.com/GreggTurkin/">Facebook tribute pages</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170630151614/http://www.greggturkin.com/">weird websites with photo galleries of his face</a>. His every public appearance is worthy of tweeting about&#x2014;especially when it involves him falling asleep <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170630151614/http://mashable.com/2016/08/16/subway-ad-guy-real/#KVjQyF6QyGq4">next to his own photo</a> (Dan Smith would never put up with this amateur hour crap).</p>

<p>Out-of-towners might mistakenly think New Yorkers are mocking Gregg (okay, there are always a few bad seeds out there), but they wouldn&apos;t understand just how much we all need local celebrities like him. His (very recognizable) face has become ubiquitous thanks to the posters. After a long, hard day of work and commuting through our stressful urban environment, sometimes you just want to see a familiar face. Even if he is a snitch.</p>

<p>Reached by phone today, Turkin offered a deep laugh, like the lapping waves of the ocean, when told about his celebrity status. &quot;No comment,&quot; was all he could utter. </p>
