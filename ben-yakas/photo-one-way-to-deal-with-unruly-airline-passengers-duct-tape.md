<p>Unruly passengers are an unfortunate reality of air travel&#x2014;but we&apos;ve never seen one dealt with so efficiently and effectively! According to a Port Authority spokesman, an &quot;apparently intoxicated&quot; man who was acting &quot;in a disorderly fashion&quot; was restrained by passengers and crew members on an Icelandair flight from Reykjavik, Iceland to JFK on Thursday afternoon. But after a few pieces of duct tape and some well-positioned plastic ties, everyone onboard was apparently able to relax and go back to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509000537/http://www.icelandair.us/information/on-board/entertainment/">enjoying <em>City Of Angels</em>.</a> </p>

<p>According <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509000537/http://www.mbl.is/frettir/innlent/2013/01/04/slo_farthega_og_hraekti_itrekad/">to Icelandic newspaper Morgunbla&#xF0;i&#xF0;</a>, the passenger downed &quot;a whole bottle&quot; of duty free alcohol, and then went &quot;subsequent crazy,&quot; using threatening language and repeatedly spitting on people. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509000537/http://andyellwood.tumblr.com/post/39659474993/passanger-drank-all-of-his-duty-free-liquor-on-the">Andy Ellwood</a>, who snapped the above photo, has this account of the incident:</p>

<blockquote>Passanger drank all of his duty free liquor on the flight from Iceland to JFK yesterday. When he became unruly, (i.e. trying to choke the woman next to him and screaming the plane was going to crash), fellow passengers subdued him and tie him up for the rest of the flight. He was escorted off the flight by police when it landed.</blockquote>

<p>The Port Authority spokesman confirmed that the passenger, whose name has not been released, was transported to a local Queens hospital after the flight landed, but local authorities did not feel it warranted charges. They added that these types of incidents happen &quot;once in a while, but not that often.&quot; [Via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509000537/http://www.buzzfeed.com/ryanhatesthis/drunk-guy-so-drunk-on-plane-that-he-had-to-be-tape">Buzzfeed</a>]</p>
