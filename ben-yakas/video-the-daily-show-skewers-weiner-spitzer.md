<p>Eager British moppet John Oliver has been killing it on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504232915/http://gothamist.com/tags/thedailyshow">The Daily Show</a> this summer while Jon Stewart has been away <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504232915/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/05/jon_stewart_leaving_the_daily_show.php">discovering himself or whatever</a>. Last night, Oliver turned his attention toward NYC&apos;s underreported political races, focusing on the campaigns of socks aficionado Eliot Spitzer and Anthony Weiner, the man who cockblocked his own career. Watch below as Oliver recaps Spitzer&apos;s Hugh Grant memorial prostitution apology tour, and calls out Weiner for pandering for gay votes.</p>

<p>For more hi-jinks, tune into The Colbert Report tonight; according to Eliot Spitzer&apos;s campaign, the Lov-Guv will be appearing on the show for an interview tonight. When Spitzer appeared on the show in February 2008, he capped off the night by paying for sex with prostitute Ashley Dupr&#xE9;.</p>
