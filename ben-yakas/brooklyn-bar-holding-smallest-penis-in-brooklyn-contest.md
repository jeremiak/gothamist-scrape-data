<p>Do you sometimes feel a burst of machismo around wienerschnitzel? Do you find yourself savoring an unusual attraction to very long cars? Do you think your micro penis is the itsy-bitsyest in all of Brooklyn? Then <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428181705/https://www.facebook.com/pages/Kings-County-Bar/159494600774673">Kings County Bar</a> wants you to sign up for their first annual Smallest Penis in Brooklyn pageant! It&apos;s the ultimate wet t-shirt contest for infinitesimal penises.</p>

<p>&quot;The Contest&quot; will be held on Saturday, July 20th starting at 5 p.m. at the bar, located at 286 Siegel Street near the Morgan Avenue L train. The event is open to anyone 21 and over; photo and video submissions will not be accepted, no matter how much you want to send them. Oddly, you don&apos;t have to worry about being completely nude, even if you are totally proud of your lilliputian penis: &quot;<strong>While nudity is not required, contestants should expect to wear wet underwear (which will be provided).</strong>&quot; Which is at least a little bit of a step up from Howard Stern&apos;s small penis contest. But what about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428181705/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DoARSlv-HU">shrinkage</a>?</p>

<p>The winner will receive the coveted title of 2013 Smallest Penis in Brooklyn, a crown, and a generous cash donation to the charity of his choice (which they note can be &quot;self&quot;). For information on entering the contest, you can email SPB.brooklyn@gmail.com. </p>

<p>We&apos;ve contacted the bar to find out some more information about the contest and those pre-wet underwear. Just think carefully before you start forwarding this link to all your buddies&#x2014;while a lot of men are very secure with their flyspeck penises, some might be carrying some subatomic shame.</p>
