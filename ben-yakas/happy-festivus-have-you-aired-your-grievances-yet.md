<p>Today is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425172850/http://gothamist.com/tags/festivus">Festivus</a>, which means it&apos;s time yet again to ask yourself whether you could smooth a silk sheet if you had a hot date with a babe. Although December 23rd has become the de facto Festivus date, it really should be celebrated any damn time you want, in the spirit that originator Dan O&apos;Keefe&apos;s father did it: &quot;whenever the hell [he] felt like it, September to May.&quot; Below, consult the inspiring original story of Festivus.</p>

<p>It truly is an inspiring holiday: did you know that the 2000 Baltimore Ravens were banned from using the word &quot;playoff&quot; by their coach? Instead, players substituted &quot;Festivus&quot; for playoffs, and called the Super Bowl the Festivus Maximus? That team went on to WIN the &quot;Festivus Maxmius&quot; that season&#x2014;so one should never scoff at the possibility of a Festivus miracle springing up and hitting you in the face with the strength of an aluminum pole. </p>

<p>To that end, there are a lot of ways you can celebrate today: you can watch the Giants play the Ravens this afternoon and hope they channel some of that Festivus Maximus spirit. You can Google the hell of out Festivus and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425172850/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/12/google_unveils_festivus_easter_egg.php">enjoy their pole easter egg. You can get tips on how to ironically observe the ritual by consulting the great </a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425172850/http://www.cabletv.com/festivus">Festivus infographic</a>, or the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425172850/http://www.festivusweb.com/">official Festivus website</a>. You could play <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425172850/http://www.aceweekly.com/2012/12/when-is-festivus-festivus-friendly-food-drink-and-drinking-game/">a drinking game</a>. You could tell friends and family how they&apos;ve disappointed you this year. Or you could stop crying and wrestle your father already.</p>
