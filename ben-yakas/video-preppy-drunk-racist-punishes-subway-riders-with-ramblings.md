<p>We all have our low moments&#x2014;but most of us are lucky enough not to have them in public places. Unfortunately for Tom, the seemingly <em>very</em> intoxicated subway rider in the video below, his low moment occurred on the 1 train yesterday. According to the uploader, &quot;He engages in a continuous tirade, filled with profanity though relatively benign in tone, until the NYPD shows up and arrests him.&quot; That tirade includes him repeatedly mumbling and shouting the phrases &quot;I am dirty rich,&quot; &quot;I am the real deal,&quot; and &quot;n***a please&quot; to almost hypnotizing effect, to the visual discomfort of his fellow straphangers (including a young boy). Is he quoting Lady Gaga&apos;s &quot;Beautiful, Dirty Rich?&quot; Is he singing a song only drunk preppies can hear? </p>
