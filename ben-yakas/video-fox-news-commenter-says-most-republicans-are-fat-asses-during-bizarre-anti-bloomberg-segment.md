<p>It&apos;s no surprise that many conservative Fox News staffers have a problem with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130403053951/http://gothamist.com/tags/mayorbloomberg">Mayor Bloomberg&apos;s</a> intrusive &quot;I know what&apos;s good for you&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130403053951/http://gothamist.com/tags/sodaban">soda ban</a>&#x2014;but knowing that doesn&apos;t begin to prepare you for where this bizarre clip, taken from Sean Hannity&apos;s show this week, goes. People smoke cigarettes on air, a commenter claims &#x201C;most Republicans are fat asses,&#x201D; and Hannity gets defensive: &quot;I&apos;ve been called a yellow journalist, immoral, a liar, and now a fat ass!&quot;</p>

<p>Fox liberal contributor Tamara Holder is responsible for the quip in the headline: she claimed &quot;most Republicans are fat asses,&quot; and blamed &quot;fat Republicans who drive through Wal-Mart in their buggies&quot; for making ObamaCare necessary. &quot;This is indefensible, and it figures that the only person you can get to defend it was somebody who for a living defends murderers, rapists and thugs, a Chicago lawyer like herself,&quot; said Imus producer Bernard McGuirk, who also lit up a cigarette in studio. </p>

<p>McGuirk tried to get things back to Bloomberg with this rant: &quot;This guy is an imperious little sneak, this Mike Bloomberg,&quot; he said. &quot;He did not campaign on any of this stuff. Around the country there&apos;s this notion that he&apos;s some paragon of good governance. <strong>Meanwhile he bought his third term, he&apos;s corrupt. </strong>The World Trade Center&apos;s still not built after ten years.&quot; And then things circled back around to calling Hannity fat.</p>

<p>Suffice to say, if this is what passes for normal on Fox News, we kinda see the appeal.</p>
