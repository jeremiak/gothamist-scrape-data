<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022083540/http://gothamist.com/tags/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> gave a long interview to notable <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022083540/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/24/us/politics/fact-check-trump-blasts-fake-news-and-repeats-inaccurate-claims-at-cpac.html">&quot;Fake News&quot;</a> outlet The New York Times this week. They touched on a number of subjects, including Trump defending accused <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022083540/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bill-oreilly-sexual-harassment-scandal_us_58e4f371e4b0f4a923b3f20f">sexual harasser</a> Bill O&apos;Reilly and the &quot;continuing&quot; health care &quot;negotiations&quot; that have gone nowhere so far. But the biggest pull quote getting traction today is Trump&apos;s claim that he once rode the subway nearly 60 years ago.</p>

<p>Here is the relevant excerpt from the allegedly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022083540/http://money.cnn.com/2017/03/29/media/donald-trump-new-york-times-stock/">&quot;Failing NY Times&quot;:</a></p>

<blockquote>THRUSH: You&#x2019;ve spent most of your career in New York. A, what do you think of the subway system in New York? Do you think it&#x2019;s in good shape? And B, when&#x2019;s the last time you were on the train in the city?

<p>TRUMP: It&#x2019;s been a long time. It&#x2019;s been a long time. It has been. I know the subway system very well. I used to take it to Kew-Forest School, in Forest Hills, when I lived in Queens. And I&#x2019;d take the subway to school. Seems a long time ago &#x2014;</p>

<p>[Cross talk.]</p>

<p>TRUMP: I&#x2019;d take it from Jamaica, 179th Street. Jamaica, right? To Forest Hills. I understand the subway very well. I used to ride between the cars.</p>

<p>HABERMAN: Did your parents tell you not to do that?</p>

<p>TRUMP: They weren&#x2019;t thrilled when they heard that.</p>

<p>THRUSH: We&#x2019;ll, you&#x2019;re kind of doing that politically now, so &#x2014;</p>

<p>TRUMP: [Unintelligible.] That could be the best statement &#x2014;</p>

<p>[Laughter.]</p>

<p>TRUMP: No, they were not happy. I used to love to do that. Those were the old days.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022083540/http://web.mta.info/nyct/rules/TransitAdjudicationBureau/rules.htm">the MTA Rules of Conduct</a>, there is a $75 fine for any unauthorized movement between subway cars: &quot;Riders may not move between subway cars even if the train is not in motion, except in an emergency or when directed by police officer, conductor or authorized MTA/New York City Transit employee.&quot; This is something that has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022083540/http://gothamist.com/2014/06/12/reminder_youll_get_a_75_ticket_if_y.php">bit some New Yorkers in the behind</a> in the past.</p>

<p>During the campaign, Trump mocked Hillary Clinton when she took the subway, and ran into <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022083540/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/07/hillary_subwayghazi.php">a MetroCard snafu.</a> &quot;She hasn&#x2019;t been in the subway in 20 years, if she was ever in the subway,&quot; Trump said <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022083540/https://www.buzzfeed.com/andrewkaczynski/donald-trump-mocks-hillary-clintons-subway-ride-sad?utm_term=.bpxQwJv5A&amp;bftw=pol#.crXpGer6Z">during an interview</a> on &quot;The Michele McPhee Show.&quot; Trump, who has lived in NYC most of his adult life, did not mention at the time that he hadn&apos;t ridden the subway since he was in middle school. </p>

<p>NYPD Transit Chief Joseph Fox tweeted an official response to Trump:</p>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Please don&apos;t ride between the subway cars. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022083540/https://t.co/AVC4V1Nq2e">https://t.co/AVC4V1Nq2e</a></p>&#x2014; Chief Joseph Fox (@NYPDTransit) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022083540/https://twitter.com/NYPDTransit/status/849963610084454400">April 6, 2017</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//web.archive.org/web/20171022083540js_/http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></center>

<p>Trump had more to say <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022083540/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/05/us/politics/donald-trump-infrastructure-bill.html?_r=0">about infrastructure</a> and how it relates to NYC. &quot;Infrastructure is so popular that I might want to use it for another bill,&quot; he said. &quot;We want to do a great infrastructure plan, and on that side I will say that we&#x2019;re going to have, I believe, tremendous Democrat support. We are also going to have some good Republican support, and I think it&#x2019;s going to be one of the very bipartisan bills and it&#x2019;s going to happen. I may put it in with health care.&quot;</p>

<p>Trump wouldn&apos;t say whether that would include two major local transportation projects&#x2014;a new train tunnel under the Hudson River between NY and NJ, and extending the Second Avenue subway line to East Harlem&#x2014;which as of now, will be defunded by his budget next year. But he did have plenty to say about the Second Avenue Subway, which you can see in the tweets below:</p>

<p>And he also shared his opinions on New York&apos;s highways and airports, which Trump hasn&apos;t used since he became president (seeing as how he hasn&apos;t visited NYC once in that time):</p>

<p></p><blockquote>THRUSH: What do you say to New Yorker officials that think those are really vital projects? What do you say to them? Do you support them?<p></p>

<p>TRUMP: Well, I may support them, I&#x2019;m going to look at them. So what I&#x2019;m doing &#x2014; is you know &#x2014; I did great in real estate in New York. I know all the developers. I know all of the folks. I know the good ones and the bad ones. And I&#x2019;m setting up a commission of very smart people that know how to spend money properly. That know how to build on time, on budget. And ideally, under time and under budget. I&#x2019;m setting up a commission. It&#x2019;s going to be headed by [the developer] Richard LeFrak and it&#x2019;s going to be headed &#x2014; they&#x2019;re going to be co- &#x2014; Steve Roth. R-O-T-H of Vornado. Two very talented, smart, tough people. And they are going to, along with me, put on a group of 20 people, 20 to 25 people on a commission. We&#x2019;re going to run projects through them. And they will have great expertise in that room. We&#x2019;ll have it from both coasts, and right down the middle. We&#x2019;re going to have representatives from various parts of the country that are all are very, very successful in terms of infrastructure. From different fields, but always infrastructure. But everything is going to be run by them. One of the things &#x2014; you probably saw what I said yesterday &#x2014; did you see where I held up the deal?</p>

<p>HABERMAN: I did. The chart.</p>

<p>TRUMP: That&#x2019;s a highway. That&#x2019;s a highway. What is that, 17 agencies, Gary? Hundreds and hundreds of approvals. Some of which, statutorily, you have to wait six months before you ask for the next one. If we do the &#x2014; when we do the infrastructure, it&#x2019;s going to be very important to me that if we give billions of dollars to a state, like New York, California or any other state, that they&#x2019;re going to have to start spending that money, they&#x2019;re going to have to have approval within 120 days.</p></blockquote><p></p>
