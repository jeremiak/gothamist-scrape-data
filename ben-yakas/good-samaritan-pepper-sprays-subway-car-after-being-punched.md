<p>A Good Samaritan who tried to intervene during a domestic dispute aboard a train on the Upper East Side yesterday ended up pepper-spraying everyone in the subway car. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130729112025/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/rescuer_gasses_subway_O7VuUXfsQLTcbCVFin8xLP?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Manhattan&amp;utm_source=feedly">According to the Post</a>, a couple got into an argument on an uptown 6 train near 96th Street around 4 p.m. Saturday. The Good Samaritan tried to break up the argument, and was punched in the face in the process. And then he broke out the pepper spray.</p>

<p>It seems the straphanger tried to defend himself by pepper spraying the man, but ended up spraying other people throughout the car. At least three passengers were taken to St. Lukes Hospital and Lenox Hill Hospital to be treated for minor injuries. The couple who had been fighting slipped away during the confusion; police said that they did not charge the pepper sprayer in the incident. </p>
