<p>It&apos;s not easy to get one honorific street sign named after someone, so you can imagine how unlikely it is for there to be <em>two</em> signs dedicated to the same thing. But if anyone deserves multiple streets renamed in their honor, it is certainly the class clowns of punk rock, The Ramones. And following <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110094002/http://gothamist.com/tags/JoeyRamonePlace">&quot;Joey Ramone Place&quot;</a> on the Lower East Side, the whole band is getting a street in Forest Hills named after them. </p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110094002/http://www.ramones.com/street-in-front-of-forest-hills-high-to-be-renamed-ramones-way-on-october-23/">the band&apos;s website</a>, &quot;Ramones Way&quot; is being put up at the intersection of 67th Avenue and 110th Street in front of the main entrance of Forest Hills High School in Queens. Forest Hills High School, appropriately, is where original members Johnny, Joey, Dee Dee, and Tommy Ramone all attended and bonded in their youth. The street will be unveiled on October 23rd at 11 a.m.</p>

<p>And it&apos;ll likely be a popular spot, based on the reception to the previous Ramones sign: Joey Ramone Place, located at the intersection of Bowery and East 2nd Street, was moved up an extra eight feet from street level after too many fans tried to steal the sign (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110094002/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/27/street_signs.php">as of 2010</a>, it was the most stolen street sign in NYC). Thanks to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110094002/http://gothamist.com/2014/02/26/someone_made_a_master_list_of_nycs.php">a local urban historian</a>, you can see a master list of all the honorific street names in the city <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110094002/http://www.nycstreets.info/honorStreet.asp">here.</a></p>

<p>Tommy Ramone, the last remaining original member of the band, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110094002/http://gothamist.com/2014/07/12/tommy_ramone_rip.php">died at the age of 62</a> in 2014. Earlier this year, the Queens Museum paid tribute to the 40th anniversary of the band&apos;s debut album with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110094002/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/06/ramones_hey_ho_exhibit.php#photo-1">&quot;Hey! Ho! Let&#x2019;s Go: Ramones and the Birth of Punk.&quot;</a></p>
