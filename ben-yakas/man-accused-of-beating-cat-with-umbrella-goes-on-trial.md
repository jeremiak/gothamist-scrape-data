<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:365px; "> <img alt="3411cat.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110305155101im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/3411cat.jpg" width="365" height="272"> <br> <i>Medea (via Daily News)</i></div> A man who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110305155101/http://gothamist.com/2009/12/12/man_beat_cat_to_death_with_umbrella.php">allegedly beat his mother-in-law&apos;s cat to death</a> with an umbrella went on trial yesterday. Lordtyshon Garret, 31, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110305155101/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2011/03/04/2011-03-04_lordtyshon_garrett_accused_of_sadistically_beating_cat_to_death_with_umbrella.html">is accused</a> of poking, stabbing, and puncturing the lung of the six-year-old cat named Madea in October 2009. &quot;The cat was severely beaten and was slowly suffering for more than a day. This case is about the sadistic and brutal acts of this defendant,&quot; said prosecutor Ayanna Blake.<p></p>

<p>The broken umbrella was linked via DNA to both the cat and Garret; although the cat was badly injured in the attack, Madea didn&apos;t die immediately&#x2014;the family chose to euthanize her later after taking her to a vet. At the time of the crime, his brother-in-law <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110305155101/http://gothamist.com/2009/12/12/man_beat_cat_to_death_with_umbrella.php">told police</a> that Garret allegedly said of the umbrella, &quot;Damn, I left a smoking gun.&quot; Garret, who was adorned in a big fur hat during his court appearance, is charged with aggravated animal cruelty, and faces up to four years in jail.</p>

<p>Garret has some stiff competition for worst person on trial of the week though: Angelo Monderoy was also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110305155101/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/01/trial_for_teens_accused_of_setting.php">in court</a> this week on charges that he fatally set a cat on fire last year. Prosecutors <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110305155101/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2011/03/01/2011-03-01_cat_torture_case_in_court_man_accused_of_torching_tabby_because_he_was_bored.html">played a recording</a> of a conversation between Monderoy and a friend which gives some damning indication as to the motivation for the crime: <strong>&quot;I don&apos;t know. We were bored.&quot;</strong></p>
