Many of these accusations stem from secret recordings made by former Officer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170329062028/http://gothamist.com/tags/adrianschoolcraft">Adrian Schoolcraft</a>. We received a tip that an email has been circulated to the entire Bronx DA&apos;s office (&quot;probably by accident&quot;) from a high-level prosecutor, who describes their observations of the NYPD undercharging cases:<p></p>

<blockquote>Subject: complaint room issue: under charging of cases

<p>Good Morning All,</p>

<p>I have been making several observations in the complaint room concerning officers clearly under charging cases, either on their own or based on orders from their supervisors such as charging misdemeanor offenses and it is clear from the arrest report facts that the case is factually a felony or charging a lesser felony than what the facts call for (e.g. forcible touching but the case is actually a Rape 1 or Assault 2 and the case is an attempted murder).  Therefore, I need all Assistants to notify me verbally and via email when cases have been grossly undercharged.</p>

<p>I need to know the following information (in an email):</p>

<p>Name of defendant(s)<br>
Arresting Officer, shield number and precinct<br>
Initial arrest charges<br>
Top charge on the complaint<br>
Whether the officer was instructed to charge a lesser offense, if so<br>
the name and rank of the person who instructed him/her<br>
Whether the officer was told the same facts that you were told by the victim</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>We contacted the Bronx DA&apos;s office for a comment.</p>
