<p>Forget what time <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141013030403/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/02/the_9_best_what_time_is_the_super_b.php">the Super Bowl begins</a>, forget what time <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141013030403/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/05/what_time_does_the_super_bowl_end.php">the Super Bowl ends</a>, forget anything about the actual game and the alleged wings shortage and anything about concussions&#x2014;a large portion of the hundred million+ people who will watch tonight&apos;s Super Bowl broadcast will be most heavily invested in whether we will be hearing &quot;Bootylicious&quot; at halftime. </p>

<p>In case you missed the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141013030403/http://dcist.com/2013/01/beyonce_can_sing_the_national_anthe.php">press conferences</a> or the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141013030403/http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=dkr_lhpH0qE">rehearsal videos</a>, Beyonce will be the featured performer during this year&apos;s halftime show in New Orleans. It&apos;s been rumored that Destiny&apos;s Child will reunite for part of the performance, and it&apos;s also been rumored that Destiny&apos;s Child won&apos;t reunite for it. It&apos;s been rumored that Beyonce may perform a new song, that Jay-Z will come out for &quot;Crazy In Love,&quot; that she will lip-sync, that she won&apos;t lip-sync, and that she is really <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141013030403/http://gawker.com/5981088/this-years-illuminati+super-bowl-connection-is-more-sinister-than-ever">a pawn of the Illuminati</a>. Some people are even nervous that Justin Timberlake may make <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141013030403/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/30/please_dont_let_justin_timberlake_b.php">an unwanted appearance.</a> </p>

<p>But the point is, this is the <em>thing</em> that America can agree on&#x2014;or at least, it&apos;s the one thing that the media can agree to hype (especially in a year when players involved in the actual game are making <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141013030403/http://deadspin.com/5980628/chris-culliver-was-asked-almost-100-questions-today-about-his-anti+gay+teammate-comments?tag=chris-culliver">idiotic homophobic remarks</a>. Nobody wants to think about that too hard). Even when artists we love dearly play the Super Bowl (ahem, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141013030403/http://gothamist.com/tags/brucespringsteen">BROOOOOCE</a>), the format for the 10-14 minute performance almost always ensures an awkward, medley-necessary, and ultimately unsatisfying experience. </p>

<p>And yet, in all the years that we&apos;ve been paying attention to these things (uh, ZZ Top performed in 1997), we don&apos;t remember any other performance that has inspired as much rumormongering and frenzied speculation as this one. Just look how enthusiastic these people are, despite having no real information:</p>

<p>We are a nation united under one banner: &quot;Countdown&quot; is an awesome fucking song. Having said that, we&apos;re starting to think that Beyonce may want to consider getting a restraining order on Bleacher Report. For a sports website, they seem a little too psyched for the halftime show.</p>

<p>Oh yeah, in case you want to avoid all the footballing and just tune in for the Beyonce, we&apos;re going to give our educated guess&#x2014;based on what time previous performers went on, mixed with the fact the first half of the Super Bowl is generally very commercial-heavy&#x2014; that Beyonce will go on at 8:11 p.m. EST. </p>
