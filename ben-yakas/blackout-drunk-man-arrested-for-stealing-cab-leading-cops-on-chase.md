<p>A man was arrested after he allegedly punched a cabbie, stole his cab, and led cops on a foot chase on the side of the Henry Hudson Parkway. But suspect David Meck isn&apos;t really sure what did or didn&apos;t happen, because he claims he was blackout drunk at the time.</p>

<p>According <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427145402/http://nypost.com/2014/07/02/drunken-passenger-attacked-driver-fled-in-cab-cops/">to the Post</a>, the 39-year-old Meck was put into a taxi by a friend (who paid for the cab) after a long evening of debauchery at Thompson and Bleecker Streets around 3&#x2009;a.m. on June 11th. The taxi driver claims Meck suddenly punched him in the back of the head around 34th Street and Fifth Avenue; Meck then pulled the driver out of the car, got in the front seat, and drove off solo.</p>

<p>Cops eventually tracked the taxi via GPS, and pulled Meck over on the Henry Hudson Parkway at West 252nd Street. Meck then made a run for it along the highway, but was quickly caught.</p>

<p>Meck, who appeared in court yesterday, has been charged with larceny, criminal possession of stolen property, resisting arrest and refusing to take a Breathalyzer. He has 17 prior arrests, including five DWIs in New York and &#xAD;Nevada, and four for allegedly resisting arrest. </p>

<p>This is at least the second time this year someone <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427145402/http://nypost.com/2014/02/27/yellow-cab-found-after-bizarre-carjacking/">has stolen a cab</a>; another person was arrested for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427145402/http://gothamist.com/2014/04/28/video_carjacker_rides_outside_of_ca.php">riding outside of a cab</a>; another cabbie was beaten by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427145402/http://gothamist.com/2014/06/04/cabbie_says_he_was_brutally_beaten.php">a skateboard-wielding racist</a>; and a limo was taken for a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427145402/http://gothamist.com/2014/05/16/drunk_man_steals_limo_takes_unsuspe.php">joy ride by a drunk rider as well.</a></p>
