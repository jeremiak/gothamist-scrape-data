<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="10211beatles.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20111011110130im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/10211beatles.jpg" width="260" height="257" class="image-left"> </span>Photographer Robert Whitaker, who is widely known for the controversial &quot;butcher cover&quot; of the Beatles album <em>Yesterday And Tomorrow</em>, has died. He was 71.</p>

<p>As the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111011110130/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/02/arts/robert-whitaker-the-beatles-photographer-dies-at-71.html?_r=1&amp;partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">Times points out about</a> Whitaker, who shot classic rock stars such as Eric Clapton and Mick Jagger, Salvador Dali, and wars from Vietnam to the Middle East, he had a long and varied career. But he is most well known for his work with the Beatles&#x2014;the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111011110130/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yesterday_and_Today">&quot;butcher cover&quot; features</a> the Beatles wearing white butchers&#x2019; coats, with chunks of raw meat and dismembered dolls hanging on them. The day before the album&apos;s official release, Capitol recalled the record because of distributors&#x2019; protests that the cover was in bad taste. All the Beatles but Paul McCartney have odd smiles.</p>

<p>The cover for the rerelease was given a new, inoffensive photograph by Whitaker, but around 25,000 may have been sold before then. The album has become a collectible&apos;s item, as you can see <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111011110130/http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&amp;_trksid=p5197.m570.l1313&amp;_nkw=yesterday+and+today+beatles&amp;_sacat=See-All-Categories">from eBay</a>. Below, you can hear an alternative version of a classic Beatles song from the album (more famously from <em>Revolver</em>):</p>
