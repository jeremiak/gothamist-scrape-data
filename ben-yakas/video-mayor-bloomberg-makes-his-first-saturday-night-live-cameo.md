<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422150351/http://gothamist.com/tags/mayorbloomberg">Mayor Bloomberg</a> has been in a noticeably light-hearted mood recently&#x2014;throwing off the shackles of 12 years in public office seems to have done wonders <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422150351/http://gothamist.com/2013/12/02/report_bloomberg_kept_on_golfing_in.php">for his golf game</a>. In that spirit, Bloomberg popped up during <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422150351/http://gothamist.com/2013/12/14/video_mayor_bloomberg_writes_thank.php">note-writing buddy</a> Jimmy Fallon&apos;s episode of <em>Saturday Night Live</em> last night. This was Bloomberg&apos;s first ever appearance on SNL&#x2014;and more shockingly, he was kind of funny!</p>

<p>Bloomberg made the surprise cameo during Weekend Update, with Seth Meyers asking him what he planned to do after leaving office: &quot;Fulfilling a lifelong dream of enjoying a small soda on a non-smoking beach.&quot; He noted he didn&apos;t have a new job lined up, but &quot;I&#x2019;ve applied to teach Spanish at a few universities. I&#x2019;m told that my accent isn&#x2019;t, quote, &#x2018;bueno&#x2019; enough.&quot; </p>

<p>He even got an ad lib on air, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422150351/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/23/nyregion/3-terms-nearly-up-bloomberg-makes-snl-cameo.html?ref=nyregion">according to the Times</a>, in response to whether he would ever consider running for president: &quot;Seth, I don&#x2019;t know what the future holds. President? Pope? Naked cowboy?&quot;</p>

<p>Oh, and the Times got one pretty good burn on Bloomberg: &quot;And the appearance doubled as definitive proof, for once, that Mr. Bloomberg, known for frequent weekend jaunts to Bermuda, was indeed in New York City on a Saturday night.&quot;</p>
