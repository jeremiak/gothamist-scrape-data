<p>If you&apos;ve been following the story of Notre Dame football star <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427162107/http://deadspin.com/manti-te.o/">Manti Te&apos;o</a> and his fake dead girlfriend, you probably know that Te&apos;o has been pretty adamant&#x2014;during the limited interviews he&apos;s given&#x2014;that he was the victim of a terrible internet hoax. But in his first televised interview since the fake dead girlfriend story broke the Internet&apos;s mind, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427162107/http://abcnews.go.com/US/manti-teo-tells-katie-couric-briefly-lied-girlfriend/story?id=18290412">Te&apos;o admits to Katie Couric that</a> he &quot;briefly&quot; lied about the situation&#x2014;&quot;briefly,&quot; as in, for several weeks. Check out a clip from the interview below.</p>

<p>Couric, who got the interview over the likes of Oprah and Dr. Phil, pressed Te&apos;o on whether or not he deceived people after discovering on December 6th that his &quot;girlfriend&quot; Lennay Kekua hadn&apos;t actually died of cancer (because she was never real). &quot;Katie, put yourself in my situation. I, my whole world told me that she died on Sept. 12. Everybody knew that. This girl, who I committed myself to, died on Sept. 12,&quot; Te&apos;o said during the interview, which will air Thursday on Couric&apos;s syndicated talk show. </p>

<p>&quot;Now I get a phone call on Dec. 6, saying that she&apos;s alive and then I&apos;m going be put on national TV two days later. And to ask me about the same question. You know, what would you do?&quot; Te&apos;o&apos;s father Brian also defended his son to Couric and critics, saying he didn&apos;t manipulate anyone: &quot;People can speculate about what they&#x2026;think he is. I&#x2019;ve known him twenty-one years of his life. And he&#x2019;s not a liar. He&#x2019;s a kid.&quot; </p>

<p>As Deadspin, who broke the story, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427162107/http://deadspin.com/5977167/">points out</a>, Te&apos;o talked about his fake dead girlfriend on at least five different occasions in the press after he found out she wasn&apos;t and had never been a real person. Te&#x2019;o&#x2019;s acquaintance, Ronaiah Tuiasosopo, is said to have admitted to creating the fictitious girl, with whom Te&#x2019;o knew for four years. They &quot;dated&quot; for the last year or so of that time before she &quot;died&quot; of leukemia in September, the same day his real grandmother actually died. </p>

<p>Te&apos;o, who did not go the funeral of his fake dead girlfriend he was in a committed online relationship with despite her dying of leukemia, DID send flowers&#x2014; the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427162107/http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/college/petal-pusher-te-hopes-receipt-funeral-flowers-proves-duped-lennay-kekua-article-1.1245555?localLinksEnabled=false">Daily News received</a> a copy of a receipt from 1-800-FLOWERS.com which lists &quot;Kainoa Kekua&quot; as the recipient of &quot;36 stems of premium white roses&quot; sent by Te&apos;o in September. It also included this message: &#x201C;My dearest Lennay, although our time together was brief, I feel like I&#x2019;ve known you all of my life. Till we meet again. I love you, Manti.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Te&apos;o is not the only one under the microscope in the wake of the fake dead girlfriend hoax: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427162107/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/23/sports/ncaafootball/as-debate-raged-at-espn-manti-teo-story-slipped-from-its-hands.html?ref=sports">according to the Times</a>, it seems ESPN had a shot at breaking the story days before Deadspin, but they were reluctant to go through with it without an on-camera interview with Te&apos;o. Despite having &quot;enough material to justify publishing an article,&quot; and having been tipped off to the hoax by Te&apos;o&apos;s agent, ESPN stuck to their journalistic guns. </p>

<p>Oh yeah, they have no problem publishing tons of unaccredited, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427162107/http://deadspin.com/5577762/source-espn-cant-get-anyone-to-talk-on-the-record">anonymously-sourced reports every day</a>, but not on the one story they had handed to them in a bow. &#x201C;If I had my druthers, we would have run with it,&#x201D; one executive told the Times. &#x201C;We&#x2019;ve had a bunch of discussions internally since then, and I don&#x2019;t think it will happen this way again. I wonder sometimes if perfection is the enemy of the practical.&#x201D;</p>

<p>On the plus side, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427162107/http://www.theonion.com/video/hoaxed-linebacker-manti-teo-now-dating-scarlett-jo,31000/?ref=auto">The Onion reports that</a> Te&apos;o is getting over his fake dead girlfriend with the help of his new totally hot fake girlfriend, who has &quot;Scarlett Johansson&apos;s head on Jenny McCarthy&apos;s body.&quot;</p>
