<p>There&apos;s a lot of damn good reasons why <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509165427/http://gothamist.com/tags/louisck">Louis C.K.</a> has become one of the most famous comedians in America over the last couple years&#x2014;and all of them are on display in the clip from Conan below, in which C.K. intelligently and empathetically discusses why he doesn&apos;t want his kids to have smartphones. But it&apos;s much more than that: it&apos;s about how smartphones are the latest way that people avoid developing the &quot;ability to just be yourself and not be doing something...That&apos;s why we text and drive,&quot; he said. &quot;People are willing to risk taking a life and ruining their own because they don&apos;t want to be alone for a second because it&apos;s so hard.&quot; Watch the whole thing below.</p>
