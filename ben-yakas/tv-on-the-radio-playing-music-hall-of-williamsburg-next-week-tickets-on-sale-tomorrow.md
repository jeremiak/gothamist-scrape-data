<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504142841/http://gothamist.com/tags/tvontheradio">TV On The Radio</a> have a brilliant brand new album, <em>Nine Types Of Light</em>, coming out next Tuesday. And to celebrate the occasion, they&apos;re bringing it all back home and playing a surprise release show at the comfy Music Hall Of Williamsburg <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504142841/http://www.musichallofwilliamsburg.com/event/6298">that evening</a>.The band already <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504142841/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/26/tv_on_the_radio_return_with_new_alb.php">announced</a> a show at Radio City Music Hall next Wednesday (tickets still available <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504142841/http://www.ticketmaster.com/event/1D00464E9CC442E9?artistid=904793&amp;majorcatid=10001&amp;minorcatid=60">here</a>), but wouldn&apos;t you rather be able to move around all herky jerky-like and dance those cobwebs out of your beard? The Music Hall show goes on sale tomorrow at noon <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504142841/http://www.ticketmaster.com/event/00004681F294C8C2?artistid=904793&amp;majorcatid=10001&amp;minorcatid=60">here</a>.</p>

<p>The new release, their fourth official album, is filled with songs about longing and love, subjects they&apos;ve been hesitant to dive into head-on in the past. It was also the first album they&apos;ve recorded in LA, far from their natural confines of Greenpoint and Williamsburg, where they could take breaks from recording with BBQ and ping pong. </p>

<p>Below you can see a trailer for the album-accompanying movie (&quot;a visual re-imagining of the record, [which] includes a music video for every song on the album&quot;), as well as the official video for first single &quot;Will Do.&quot; And if you haven&apos;t heard it yet, check <em>Nine Types Of Light</em> out <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504142841/http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/musicblog/2011/apr/05/tv-radio-nine-types-light">here</a>&#x2014;it really might be their tightest, breeziest album yet. Even if they&apos;ve moved away from the rich sonic dankness of <em>Return To Cookie Mountain</em>, they more then make up for it with their most chiseled songwriting yet.</p>
