<p>The trailer for <em>Inside Llewyn Davis</em>, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429093109/http://gothamist.com/tags/coenbrothers">Coen Brothers&apos;</a> latest movie that revolves around the burgeoning folk music scene in Greenwich Village in the early 1960s, has finally been released&#x2014;and suffice to say, it looks fan-fucking-tastic. It&apos;s got a little bit of everything: ginger cats on the subway! John Goodman with a &quot;hip&quot; beard! A glimpse of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429093109/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/31/can_the_coen_brothers_transform_jus.php">Justin Timberlake</a>! Historically accurate old NYC! And Bob Dylan&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429093109/http://www.bobdylan.com/us/songs/farewell">&quot;Farewell&quot;</a> on the soundtrack! Watch it below.</p>

<p>Last year around this time, the Coen Brothers transformed the East Village into Greenwich Village of the 1960s while filming the movie; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429093109/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/16/the_coen_brothers_have_transformed.php#photo-1">you can see some very cool photos of it here</a>. </p>

<p>In addition to Timberlake and Carey Mulligan, Oscar Isaac stars as the titular character, who is based on legendary folkie Dave Van Ronk; the whole movie is loosely based on Van Ronk&apos;s posthumously published memoir <em>The Mayor of MacDougal Street,</em> which we strongly recommend. And it seems Isaac can do a credible Van Ronk: below, check out Isaac performing one of Van Ronk&apos;s classics, &quot;Dink&apos;s Song.&quot;</p>

<p>Van Ronk let Dylan crash on his couch for months when he first arrived in NYC from Minnesota; he introduced him to the Greenwich Village scene, with Van Ronk&apos;s wife even booking gigs for him. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429093109/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/24/dylan_week_bob_dylans_love_affair_w.php#photo-3">Most importantly, Dylan absorbed elements</a> of Van Ronk&apos;s larger-than-life personality, as well as his interpretative skills: &quot;He turned every folk song into a surreal melodrama, a theatrical piece,&quot; Dylan wrote in Chronicles. &quot;Every night I felt like I was sitting at the feet of a timeworn monument...Later, when I would record my first album, half the cuts on it were renditions of songs that Van Ronk did. It&apos;s not like I planned that, it just happened. Unconsciously I trusted his stuff more than I did mine.&quot; </p>

<p>Below, you can hear Dylan and Van Ronk hilariously covering Woody Guthrie&apos;s &quot;Car Song.&quot; </p>
