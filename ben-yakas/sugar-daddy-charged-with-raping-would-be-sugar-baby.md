Lakhinder Vohra, 46, was arrested on a first-degree rape charge after he allegedly raped the victim, whom he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408135919/http://gothamist.com/tags/seekingarrangements">met through SeekingArrangement.com</a>, on Wednesday in his Wall Street apartment at around 2:45 p.m. during their first in-person meet-up. Sources tell the Post that Vohra, who uses the handle &#x201C;Daddy Loves Arm Candy,&#x201D; allegedly threw the woman onto his bed and raped her.<p></p>

<p>Vohra works at real estate firm Nest Seekers, runs the social site PartyDigest.com, and founded the SikhCommunityCenter.org Web site. In a 2011 interview with The Post, the divorced Vohra claimed to be worth $2 million, and he bragged about how SeekingArrangement.com &quot;changed my f- -king life.&#x201D; &#x201C;When does a guy like me &#x2014; aging, losing hair, big belly &#x2014; meet a girl like this?&#x201D; Vohra told them at the time; the Post notes that &quot;he grabbed and sloppily kissed a curvaceous woman&quot; after saying so. </p>

<p>A person at Nest Seekers told the Post, &#x201C;Obviously, we&#x2019;re not happy about this,&#x201D; and a neighbor told them, &#x201C;He&#x2019;s icky and slimy. There&#x2019;s a lot of women in and out of his apartment. He&#x2019;s very full of himself.&#x201D; Vohra has also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408135919/http://badboyreport.com/lak-vohra-lakhinder-vohra-212-742-0927-dubaishoppergmail-com-new-york/">been named on &quot;Bad Boy Report&quot;</a> as a &quot;bad escort:&quot;</p>

<blockquote>Please watch out for LAK VOHRA OR LAKHINDER VOHRA. Very abusive and grabby. I attended an event with him and he was the rudest man i have ever met. Encouraged me to drink heavily(whenever my glass was 3/4 empty he would hand me another glass of wine.) Flirted with cocktail waitress entire time i was there and generally made me feel uncomfortable. Was just rude and a jerk the entire night. Finally snuck out of the bar after several tries (he would grab me forcibly if he saw me heading for the door) I later did a google search on his name and found i am not the first victim, he sees escorts and scams them out of money and he is BROKE! This man is abusive and a danger. Stay away! </blockquote>

<p>Another anonymous person commented:</p>

<blockquote>I too have been a victim to this evil sinister man. Went to new years last year with him. And he tried to drug me. Also web I told him I wasn&#x2019;t going to sleep with him on the first date. He actually left me there all alone. He stole my bag money clothes that I left on his couch. Truly a bad man. One thing to say. Karma will get him back one of these days.</blockquote>
