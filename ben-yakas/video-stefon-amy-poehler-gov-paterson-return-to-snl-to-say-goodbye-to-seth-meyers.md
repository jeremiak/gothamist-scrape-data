<p>Seth Meyers, who has been on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503153317/http://gothamist.com/tags/snl"><em>Saturday Night Live</em></a> since 2001 and a head writer since 2006, got an emotional send off on Weekend Update last night. Stefon (Bill Hader), Amy Poehler, Andy Samberg, and Gov. David Paterson (Fred Armisen) all returned for Meyer&apos;s last episode behind the desk at Studio 8H. Watch below.</p>

<p>Among other things, Poehler gave Meyers an idea of what life is like outside of SNL, Samberg serenaded him with some Boyz II Men, Stefon got catty with Cecily Strong, and Gov. Paterson walked into the camera for the best two seconds of the night.</p>
