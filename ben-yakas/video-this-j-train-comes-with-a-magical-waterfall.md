<p>We already know what a subway car looks like after it&apos;s been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110091753/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/23/subway_cars_coral_reefs.php#photo-1">submerged deep underwater for years</a>&#x2014;now thanks to a mysterious leak on the J train this week, we have a much clearer idea what it looks like at the start of that process.</p>

<p>Straphanger Nina B, 25, took the video above while on the J train around 9 a.m. on Tuesday morning. She got on at Delancey Street and soon realized the train was filling up with water (or fluid of some kind): &quot;The ceiling was leaking a lot of fluid into the car,&quot; the Carroll Gardens resident told us. &quot;I think it was water, but I&apos;m not sure. There was also some coming out of the wall, so people were clearing the area.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It&apos;s pretty gross,&quot; Nina, who was sitting in one of the middle cars of the train, added. &quot;Everyone was sorta staring at it and making faces.&quot;</p>

<p>It did rain a little earlier Tuesday morning, but Nina noted she had seen water leaking into that particular train before: &quot;The precipitation would increase as the car slowed and stopped,&quot; she said. &quot;I think I&apos;ve seen it before on this train. A couple months ago I noticed the ceiling was leaking, but it was not nearly as much as this time.&quot; She&apos;s not the only one to have noticed:</p>

<p>Nina reported the leak to the MTA. We asked the MTA&apos;s press office yesterday about where the water/fluid was coming from, and what passengers can do if they spot such an issue during their commute. They didn&apos;t reply.<br>
