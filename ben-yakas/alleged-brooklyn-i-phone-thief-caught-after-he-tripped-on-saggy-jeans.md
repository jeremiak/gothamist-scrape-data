                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="82813sag.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20131004233520im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/82813sag.jpeg" width="640" height="424"> <br> <i> &quot;Stop The Sag&quot; campaign ad</i></div> <p></p>

<p>A few years ago, Sen. Eric Adams started a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131004233520/http://gothamist.com/tags/stopthesag">&quot;Stop the Sag&quot;</a> campaign, putting up billboards across Brooklyn encouraging teens to stop looking like fools with their pants on the ground. But lucky for one <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131004233520/http://gothamist.com/tags/iphone">iPhone user</a>, not everyone took the advice to heart: an alleged iPhone bandit was caught yesterday after he tripped on his own sagging jeans. &quot;He was zigzagging all over the place, but he couldn&apos;t run because his pants was falling down,&quot; witness Arlene Williams <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131004233520/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/cellphone_robbery_suspect_tripped_sTYNvTbPKgLIY4Fbd3MfhI">told the Post</a>. &quot;This cop saw it, and he went right after him.&quot;</p>

<p>Joel Donaldson, 21, allegedly punched victim Maria Soccoro in the face before grabbing her phone around 2:30 p.m. Tuesday at Court and Remsen Streets near Borough Hall. Soccoro started screaming, and officer Donovan Hunt, who had been directing traffic nearby, began chasing Donaldson down the street. But because of his sagging pants, Donaldson had a tough time navigating the busy sidewalks, and Hunt tackled him near Joralemon Street.</p>

<p>Donaldson <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131004233520/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/cops-nab-iphone-thief-article-1.1438558">has been charged</a> with attempted robbery, attempted grand larceny and harassment. And credit where credit&apos;s due: if it wasn&apos;t for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131004233520/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/23/nanny_bloomberg_doesnt_mind_if_your.php">Mayor Bloomberg&apos;s laissez-faire attitude</a> toward sartorial trends, this might not have happened! </p>
