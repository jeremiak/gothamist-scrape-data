<p>You&apos;ve heard all about the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120119001050/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/01/boardwalk_empire_is_bringing_back_o.php#photo-1"><em>Boardwalk Empire</em>-themed vintage 1920&apos;s trains</a> running on the express 2/3 track in Manhattan&#x2014;and yesterday <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120119001050/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/03/reminder_boardwalk_empire_vintage_s.php">it launched</a>!

<p>The trains will be running every Saturday and Sunday this September, between 12 p.m. and 6 p.m. between 42nd and 96th Streets. And during the weekend of September 24 and 25, actors hired by HBO folks will be on the streets to distribute complimentary MetroCards in the vicinity of the Times Square-42nd and 72nd street stations. But keep in mind: the vintage trains have no air conditioning. How else were they going to be able to conjure up the smell of a 1920&apos;s train?</p>
