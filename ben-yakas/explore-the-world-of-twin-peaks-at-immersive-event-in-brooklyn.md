<p>We are less than 20 days away from the much-anticipated return of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170504005230/http://laist.com/tags/twinpeaks"><em>Twin Peaks</em></a>, David Lynch&apos;s soap opera-slash-surrealist epic. The series will begin again with a two hour premiere on Showtime on Sunday, May 21st, but you&apos;ll have a chance to immerse yourself in the iconography of the <em>Twin Peaks</em> universe at a special event in Greenpoint the week before.</p>

<p>Flavorpill and BBQ Films have teamed up for <em>SHOWTIME PRESENTS: A TRIBUTE TO TWIN PEAKS</em>, which will take place Tuesday, May 16th at 7 p.m. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170504005230/http://gothamist.com/2016/09/09/polonaise_terrace_bk_bazaar_photos.php">at Brooklyn Bazaar in Greenpoint</a>. Here&apos;s what you can expect to find there:</p>

<blockquote>Enjoy a damn good cup of coffee at the Double R Diner, explore the mysterious Twin Peaks Lodge, and interact with a variety of quirky &#x2014; dare we say suspicious &#x2014; characters from this quaint northwestern town, brought to life by the beauties of The Pink Room Burlesque. Come in costume to enter our Miss Twin Peaks Pageant; the prizes could be a new shirt at the men&apos;s store, a catnap in your office chair, or two cups of good hot black coffee. You&apos;ll just have to compete to see!</blockquote>

<p>More details, including ticketing info, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170504005230/http://presents.flavorpill.com/showtimetwinpeaks">can be found here</a>&#x2014;entrance is free if you RSVP now, but it&apos;s on a first-come, first-serve basis, so if you want to get in, get there really early or get ready to wait on line for awhile. </p>

<p>Showtime has been careful about not releasing almost any new footage from the upcoming season, though we did get our first glimpse at what the town of Twin Peaks looks like in modern times in the promo below.</p>

<p>This promo is also nice as a little refresher on some of the happenings of the first two season:</p>
