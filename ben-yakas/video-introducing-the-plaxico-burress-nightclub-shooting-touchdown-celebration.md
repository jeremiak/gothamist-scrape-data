<p>They may have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111128165519/http://scores.espn.go.com/nfl/recap?gameId=311127020">looked a bit unsure of themselves</a>, but the Jets were able to hold on for a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111128165519/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/27/jets_need_win_vs_suddenly_hapless_b.php">much-needed</a> win over divisional rivals the Buffalo Bills this afternoon, 28-24. Putting aside Mark Sanchez&apos;s career-high four TD&apos;s, perhaps the most notable play of the game came on a touchdown by Bills receiver Steve Johnson. He celebrated a score late in the first half by mocking Jets receiver <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111128165519/http://gothamist.com/tags/plaxicoburress">Plaxico Burress</a>, pretending to shoot himself in the leg. Watch below.</p>

<p>Burress went on to serve 20 months in prison for shooting himself in the leg at a Manhattan nightclub in 2008, a year after the Giants had won the Super Bowl. Johnson wasn&apos;t satisfied just mocking Burress though: after his leg dance, he ran to the left side of the end zone with his arms extended&#x2014;mocking the &quot;flight&quot; celebration Jets players often use after scoring&#x2014;and then crashed to the ground. The Jets got the last laugh though: Johnson and the Bills were penalized for excessive celebration, which led to the Jets scoring on the next play. </p>

<p>Oh yeah&#x2014;and the Jets <em>won the game.</em></p>
