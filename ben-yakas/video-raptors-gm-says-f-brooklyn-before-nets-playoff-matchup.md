<p>The sun has set on a disastrous <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506172258/http://gothamist.com/tags/knicks">Knicks</a> season, but things have been steadily improving for the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506172258/http://gothamist.com/tags/nets">Brooklyn Nets</a> in 2014. Despite a terrible start to the season and losing star Brook Lopez, the team finished the year 44-38, in second place in the Eastern Conference with a first round matchup against division leaders the Toronto Raptors. And a new rivalry may have been born today when Raptors GM and Knicks troll Masai Ujiri <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506172258/http://www.sbnation.com/lookit/2014/4/19/5631252/masai-ujiri-shouts-f-brooklyn-before-raptors-nets">declared &quot;Fuck Brooklyn&quot; at a rally this morning.</a></p>

<p>Fans and beat writers were excited about the trash talking:</p>
