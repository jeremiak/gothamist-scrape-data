                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="111513kelly_bongos.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20140210113119im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/111513kelly_bongos.jpg" width="640" height="480"> <br> <i> Ray Kelly at the Apollo in 2011 (courtesy Shahar Azran Photography / Apollo Theater)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>Police Commissioner <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140210113119/http://gothamist.com/tags/raykelly">Ray Kelly</a> hasn&apos;t said too much about the fact he was (essentially) thrown under the bus by all the various Democratic mayoral candidates during primary season&#x2014;just about all of them criticized stop-and-frisk and said they&apos;d replace Kelly if they became mayor, including Mayor-elect Bill de Blasio. Kelly finally opened up about it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140210113119/http://www.playboy.com/playground/view/ray-kelly-nypd-playboy-interview">to Playboy in a major interview published in this month&apos;s issue</a>, and it&apos;s clear he doesn&apos;t think too highly of any of them. And in particular, he agrees when Playboy asks him if he thinks de Blasio and Bill Thompson are &apos;full of shit.&apos;</p>

<p>&quot;I resented it,&quot; Kelly said when asked about being used as a political football by the candidates. &quot;I think I&#x2019;ve had a long, distinguished career in public service. It just goes to show you what some politicians will do. They&#x2019;ll say or do anything to get elected. <strong>I know all these people. They all claimed to be friends of mine up until their mayoral campaigns. </strong>They&#x2019;d call me on the phone and ask for information or come over here and sit in this chair to get briefed.&quot; Sounds like someone has been blasting <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140210113119/http://www.buzzfeed.com/perpetua/4-times-drake-had-to-question-his-no-new-friends-vow">&quot;No New Friends&quot;</a>.</p>

<p>Kelly is openly skeptical about any long-term changes on the part of de Blasio: &quot;They were talking about election-year politics. They were pandering to get votes. Whoever wins the primary always attempts to run back to the center and disavow the impact of what they&#x2019;ve said.&quot; He&apos;s also annoyed that everyone is focusing on stop-and-frisk, and not any of the other police &quot;tools&quot; he&apos;s implement to derail crime, such as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140210113119/http://gothamist.com/tags/operationcrewcut">Operation Crew Cut</a> and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140210113119/http://gothamist.com/tags/realtimecrimecenter">Real Time Crime Center.</a> Operation Lucky Bag <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140210113119/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/21/nypds_operation_lucky_bag_target_of.php">was notably omitted</a>. </p>

<p>Even so, he spends <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140210113119/http://www.playboy.com/playground/view/ray-kelly-nypd-playboy-interview?page=2">a good portion of the interview</a> defending stop-and-frisk and lamenting that crime will go up if it is curtailed in any way: &quot;It doesn&#x2019;t take a brain surgeon to figure out that if you stop or curtail stop-and-frisk, or if cops are reluctant to do it, violent crimes are going to go up.&quot; </p>

<p>It&apos;s unclear who Kelly&apos;s brain surgeon is, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140210113119/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/07/stop_frisk_down_by_51_in_2013_as_cr.php">it&apos;s worth noting</a> that the number of stop-and-frisks performed by the NYPD declined by 51% in the first quarter of this year compared with the same period in 2012. At the same time, shootings and murders also dropped by 24% and 40% respectively in the same time period.</p>

<p>There is also this knotty exchange, in which Kelly seems to run in circles:</p>

<blockquote>PLAYBOY: Can you understand how some young men of color who have been stopped for no reason may hate your guts?

<p>KELLY: I don&#x2019;t agree. The notion of hatred has been stirred up by a small number of advocacy groups that have done a great job at marketing this concept. You might read something snarky on Twitter, but I could take you right now to 125th Street in Harlem and young men will stop me for my picture and give me a very favorable and friendly greeting. They understand that we&#x2019;re saving lives in their community, that they&#x2019;re the ones at risk.</p>

<p>PLAYBOY: To be clear, what are the officers not allowed to do?</p>

<p>KELLY: They&#x2019;re not allowed to stop someone based on their race. They&#x2019;re not allowed to stop someone based on less than reasonable suspicion.</p>

<p>PLAYBOY: But you focus your efforts in black and Latino neighborhoods.</p>

<p>KELLY: Well, that&#x2019;s where the crime is. That&#x2019;s where the shootings are. That&#x2019;s where the violence is. And that&#x2019;s where we put our resources.</p>

<p>PLAYBOY: Put yourself in the shoes of a 17-year-old black teenager dressed in a hoodie and baggy pants, earplugs in, listening to music, a can of Coke in his pocket. You&#x2019;re on your way home and haven&#x2019;t done anything wrong. Out of the blue, cops stop you. Is that fair?</p>

<p>KELLY: It depends on why he&#x2019;s being stopped. Was there a description on the radio of somebody committing a crime who looked like that young man? Was somebody fleeing a particular area? Is there gang activity there? Or did they think his can of Coke was a weapon? Stopping him is a legitimate law enforcement function.</p>

<p>PLAYBOY: But he won&#x2019;t be stopped just because he&#x2019;s black or because of what he&#x2019;s wearing?</p>

<p>KELLY: No, absolutely not. You need reasonable suspicion.</p>

<p>PLAYBOY: Are you saying it has never happened that someone was stopped for no reason?</p>

<p>KELLY: I can&#x2019;t say it has never happened. We have hundreds of thousands of stops a year. But generally stops happen for a legitimate reason, with reasonable suspicion.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>Kelly also talks about how New York City is at &quot;war&quot; with terrorists (&quot;This is war, and in most wars, professional soldiers don&#x2019;t hate the enemy. Hatred can blind you in ways that mar your judgment.&quot;) and recounts many of the failed terrorist attacks over the course of his tenure: &quot;Sixteen&#x2014;including the Brooklyn Bridge, the New York Stock Exchange, Times Square, Herald Square, the subway system and JFK airport.&quot; The number sixteen is highly dubious&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140210113119/http://www.propublica.org/article/fact-check-how-the-nypd-overstated-its-counterterrorism-record">Kelly has repeatedly overstated</a> the number of terrorist attacks his department has thwarted. Federal officials <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140210113119/http://www.nypost.com/f/print/news/local/manhattan/surprised_terror_plot_suspect_to_7WJcwDcNRyw12eNm1scV0N">have also called</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140210113119/http://www.wnyc.org/articles/wnyc-news/2011/may/14/feds-say-terror-case-hyped-nypd-says-its-real-deal/">some of these &quot;plots</a>&quot; to be overhyped. </p>

<p>He also spends time talking about surveillance cameras, praising Bill and Hillary Clinton, his beloved custom-made suits, his interest in becoming a greeter at Walmart, and Mayor Bloomberg&apos;s compassion: &quot;Oh, he has tremendous compassion. I&#x2019;ve gone with him to hospitals many times to visit police officers who have been wounded, or to visit with the families of officers who have been killed. I see a very sensitive and warm person, very touched in those situations.&quot; </p>

<p>Despite or because of Kelly&apos;s smooth layering of bullshit, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140210113119/http://www.playboy.com/playground/view/ray-kelly-nypd-playboy-interview">the whole interview is worth a read</a>, if only for this anecdote about George W. Bush: &quot;He was always friendly and funny. I was once in a car with him here in New York, and he said, &apos;Kelly, you ever notice when I&#x2019;m driving down the block, everybody&#x2019;s giving me the finger?&apos; I said, &apos;They&#x2019;re just saying you&#x2019;re number one, Mr. President.&apos;&quot;</p>
