<p>This week, everyone&apos;s favorite Columbia-educated, sweater vest-wearing musicians Vampire Weekend got into hot water with car enthusiasts the world over thanks to their music video for new single &quot;Diane Young,&quot; in which two 900-series Saab cars are torched. Because only Vampire Weekend or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130605040115/http://www.carscoops.com/2011/08/kanye-west-and-jay-z-destroy-300000.html">Kanye West</a> could possibly find themselves wrapped up in a controversy with people who fetishize cars. </p>

<p>The &quot;Diane Young&quot; video, which you can see above, was seemingly inspired by the first line of the song, &quot;&#x201C;You torched a Saab like a pile of leaves. I&#x2019;d gone to find some better wheels.&#x201D;  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130605040115/http://jalopnik.com/vampire-weekend-are-a-bunch-of-dicks-458367432">Jalopnik wrote a post</a> subtly titled, &quot;Vampire Weekend Are A Bunch Of Dicks,&quot; while others anthropomorphized the cars in the video&apos;s YouTube comments. Now, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130605040115/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/saab_otaged_KMYcqRlwZ1hFcvPuHxE0VO">NY Post points out</a> that the band may have actually broken some laws in pursuit of their car-killing art: they may have violated <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130605040115/http://www.epa.gov/cleanairactbenefits/whereyoulive/ny.html">New York&#x2019;s Clean Air Act</a>, because burning paint and metal is an environmental hazard. </p>

<p>The band have been quite sensitive about the controversy, taking the criticisms to heart, as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130605040115/http://pitchfork.com/news/50128-vampire-weekend-caught-in-controversy-over-burning-of-saab-cars-in-diane-young-video/">Pitchfork put it</a>, &quot;the way some might after being accused of animal cruelty.&quot; Lead singer Ezra Koenig <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130605040115/http://www.spinner.com/2013/03/28/vampire-weekend-ezra-koening-saab-900/">told Spinner</a>, &quot;I want people to understand that we do respect cars and the last thing we want to do is to fuck up a collector&apos;s item or something like that.&quot; He added that their label had sought to purchase the cheapest, oldest cars possible (the Saabs used were valued at $3,000 each).</p>

<p>Anyway, at the end of the day, the only question is whether the band broke any clean air rules around burning the cars. There&apos;s no debate that the band&apos;s label bought the used cars legally (Koenig noted, &quot;From what I understand those old ones actually had a lot of electrical problems&quot;), so they had the right to do whatever they wanted with the &quot;junkers&quot;&#x2014;maybe the owners of those cars had emotional ties to them, but <em>they&apos;re cars</em>. They almost certainly weren&apos;t going to get anything resembling a respectful burial. </p>

<p>Our bigger takeaways: how come Vampire Weekend keep getting into these odd controversies right before their new albums drop? If you recall, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130605040115/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/08/16/vampire-weekend-contra-lawsuit_n_928313.html">the band was sued by</a> model Ann Kirsten Kennis, who claimed the band didn&apos;t have the right to use a photo of her as the cover of their sophomore album, <em>Contra.</em> And while we&apos;re not offended by the car burning, we&apos;re disappointed in the lazy video: the band came up with some fantastic music videos for the singles from <em>Contra</em>, including <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130605040115/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e0u11rgd9Q">&quot;Cousins&quot;</a>, and the very self-aware <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130605040115/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bccKotFwzoY">&quot;Giving Up The Gun.&quot;</a> Did they just not have any better ideas for the Springsteen-influenced &quot;Diane Young&quot;?</p>
