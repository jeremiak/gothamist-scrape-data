<p>Manhattan and Brooklyn will forever be locked in an eternal struggle over which borough is cooler/more authentic (at least until someone builds <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140219102010/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/24/photos_dope_street_art_courtesy_of.php">a monorail connecting the two sides</a>, at which point all divisiveness will cease and a new era of harmony and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140219102010/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEZjzsnPhnw">spontaneous singing</a> will flourish). But what&apos;s the best forum for hashing this all out? Posters <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140219102010/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/26/brooklyn_vs_manhattan_the_posters.php">aren&apos;t cutting it.</a> Neither are our basketball teams, whose &quot;Battle Of The Boroughs&quot; showdowns this season have turned into a &quot;Battle Of This-Is-Really-Sad-You-Guys, I-Think-We-Made-Brook-Lopez-Cry.&quot; When posters and basketball rivalries fail us, we have no choice: we must turn to the divisive dorks <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140219102010/http://www.cbsnews.com/videos/battle-of-the-boroughs-is-brooklyn-or-manhattan-tops/">over at CBS This Morning</a>.</p>

<p>If you ever wanted to see Mo Rocca give his best <em>Warriors</em> impression, then this your moment&#x2014;otherwise, as nice as they seem, you may be left slightly deflated by Rocca and Jeff Glor&apos;s tourist-eyed view of the debate. </p>

<p>At least there&apos;s one thing we can all agree on: neither Manhattan nor Brooklyn is a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140219102010/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/08/skyrocketing_brooklyn_rents_close_i.php">reasonable place</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140219102010/http://gothamist.com/tags/rent">to live anymore</a>. Also, no one&apos;s heard from Manhattan <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140219102010/http://gothamist.com/2013/12/05/manhattan_is_no_more.php">in nearly 48 hours</a>, so perhaps this debate is moot anyway.</p>
