This transitionary season of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150304021406/http://gothamist.com/tags/snl"><em>Saturday Night Live</em></a> continued this weekend with host Kerry Washington, who was just as energetic and game as last week&apos;s excellent host, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150304021406/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/27/videos_saturday_night_live_injects.php">Edward Norton</a>. Having a black female host gave the show an opportunity to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150304021406/http://www.salon.com/2013/09/26/saturday_night_live_is_way_too_white/">address criticisms</a> about the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150304021406/http://www.standard.net/stories/2013/11/01/snl-criticized-lack-black-comediennes">lack of diversity</a> amongst the new cast members <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150304021406/http://entertainment.time.com/2013/10/21/saturday-night-live-criticized-for-lack-of-diversity/">they&apos;ve been getting</a> all season&#x2014;and in particular, the lack of female black cast members. </p>

<p>And they certainly went for it with the cold open sketch, in which the fourth wall was broken several times by Washington as she changed between being Michelle Obama and Oprah (and Beyonce off-screen). It worked as a commentary on the situation, but it was weird: SNL got to address the elephant in the room, and sort of apologize about it, while at the same time confirming that nothing was really going to change anytime soon. On the one hand, Washington was great in the sketch, and the six Matthew McConaugheys were inspired. On the other hand, the Rev. Al Sharpton deflated the gravity of the self-analysis by ending the sketch with an exasperated &quot;oh well.&quot;</p>

<p>But hey, if given a choice between SNL commenting on itself in the cold open or a limp political sketch, I&apos;d always rather have the former. And while there&apos;s no indication that anything will change in terms of the cast (and writing staff) for SNL this season, the episode really doubled down on Jay Pharoah in this episode, which is <em>always</em> a welcome thing. Pharoah was fantastic as a foil for Washington in several sketches, especially the episode highlight &quot;What Does My Girl Say?&quot; (Kate McKinnon almost stole the sketch with her horse impression) and the very funny &quot;How&#x2019;s He Doing?&quot; He&apos;s also nailed his cross-eyed Shaq impression (&#x201C;I like raisins. They&#x2019;re like grapes. Only they small.&#x201D;) and even his Principle Frye was pleasant.</p>

<p>The rest of the episode was the usual mixed bag, with a lot of decent premises squandered or run into the ground. Nasim Pedrad was great in the &quot;Career Week Speaker&quot; sketch, as was Mike O&apos;Brien as her blushing, sound FX-obsessed son in one of his few appearances of the night. &quot;Date Or Diss&quot; tried to channel the same energy as the &quot;Swarovski Commercials,&quot; but didn&apos;t quite reach that level; and the episode-ending &quot;Ice Cream&quot; video was highly surreal, but not quite <em>funny</em>.</p>

<p>Like last week, the new cast members didn&apos;t get much to do after appearing as five of the six Matthew McConaugheys. Kyle Mooney, who has probably been getting the most air time of the six newbies, had the final &quot;Ice Cream&quot; sketch, but I don&apos;t recall seeing Noel Wells this week.</p>

<p>Click through for all those sketches, plus Weekend Update&#x2014;but nothing from musical guest Eminem. He performed two songs, but neither are available online, which may be because <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150304021406/https://twitter.com/search?q=eminem%20lip%20sync&amp;src=tyah">he allegedly lip-synced.</a><br>
