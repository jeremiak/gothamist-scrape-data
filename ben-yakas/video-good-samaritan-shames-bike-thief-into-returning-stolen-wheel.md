                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="91413bikethief.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130919074314im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/91413bikethief.jpg" width="640" height="480" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>We generally don&apos;t recommend that people try to take <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130919074314/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/14/video_straphangers_work_together_to.php">justice into their own hands</a>&#x2014;unless it maybe involves <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130919074314/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/16/heroic_theatergoer_smashes_cell_pho.php">cell phones in public places</a>&#x2014;but once in a while, it seems to work out. Like in the case of Emil, the man who uploaded the video below: he confronted a bike thief on the Upper West Side in July on camera and was able to shame him into putting a stolen wheel back.</p>

<p>Of course, Emil then followed the thief (&quot;like a ninja&quot;) only to watch as he tried to steal another bike a few blocks away. At that point, he hailed a cop who came and apparently ticketed or arrested the thief (you can see him detained in a still photo toward the end of the video). We think Emil certainly earned himself the jaunty soundtrack music. </p>
