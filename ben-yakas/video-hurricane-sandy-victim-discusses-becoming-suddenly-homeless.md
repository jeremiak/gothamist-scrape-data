<p>As we <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150107122407/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/27/more_than_900_sandy_refugees_still.php">reported this week</a>, many families who were evacuated from their homes because of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150107122407/http://gothamist.com/tags/hurricanesandy">Hurricane Sandy</a> won&apos;t find a permanent place to stay for months. And as Mayor Bloomberg learned quite viscerally yesterday <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150107122407/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/02/bloomberg_booed_at_rockaways_st_pat.php">at the St. Patrick&apos;s Day parade in the Rockaways</a>, there are a lot of folks who are very angry about the way the city has handled the fallout. One such person dealing with the worst of this bureaucracy is Vicki, a social worker for homeless people whose home was destroyed in the storm, leaving her and her 9-year-old daughter homeless themselves.</p>

<p>In the video above, taken as she was begging for money on the A Train, Vicki discusses the shock of becoming &quot;suddenly homeless&quot; and the difficulty of living on public assistance: &quot;Cory Booker can&apos;t do it, he&apos;s the Mayor of Newark, he&apos;s a single man, a vegetarian, living on a potato every day! How do they expect me and my 9-year-old to do it?&quot;</p>

<p>Just two weeks ago, Bloomberg discussed the city&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150107122407/http://gothamist.com/tags/homeless">homeless population</a>&#x2014;despite <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150107122407/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/17/bloomberg_administrations_new_polic.php">a controversial new policy</a> that allows the city to turn away families with nowhere else to go when the temperature has dipped below freezing, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150107122407/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/23/bloomberg_says_new_york_is_more_com.php">Bloomberg claimed</a>, &quot;we&#x2019;re three to 10 times more compassionate than the other cities&quot; when it comes to homelessness. </p>

<p>The city says <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150107122407/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/nyc_haven_for_homeless_G50BBS5w1juF3mKRQZsTTO?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Local">they&apos;ll spend $955 million</a> on homeless services in the next fiscal year, but it&apos;s unclear how that money will be distributed, or whether Sandy victim will be aided as well. As Vicki puts it, there needs to be more safety nets in place in the future to protect New Yorkers: &quot;This could have happened to anybody though. It&apos;s not like a moral deficiency. It&apos;s not like I did it, like I did something.&quot; She added: &quot;That&apos;s what&apos;s so frightening about the whole thing. It could be Donald Trump. It could be anybody.&quot;</p>
