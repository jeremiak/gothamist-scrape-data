<p>Last weekend, we were amused to learn that actor Macaulay Culkin <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502140013/http://gothamist.com/2013/12/07/hear_macaulay_culkins_pizza-obsesse.php">is in an anti-folk band called The Pizza Underground</a>, a group that changes all the lyrics of Velvet Underground and Lou Reed songs to pizza references. The band has only brought their pepperoni-tinged tunes to a scant few places (including a show at Sidewalk Cafe), but this Friday, you can see the band for free live in Williamsburg.</p>

<p>As <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502140013/http://www.brooklynvegan.com/archives/2013/12/macaulay_culkin.html">Brooklyn Vegan points out</a>, the group will play this Friday at 7 p.m. at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502140013/http://babysallright.com/">Baby&apos;s All Right</a>: &quot;Free pizza while supplies last.&quot; Below, you can listen to their only recording so far, a medley of all their covers, including &quot;I&apos;m Beginning to Eat The Slice&quot; and &quot;Papa John Says.&quot;</p>

<p>In addition to Culkin, the band includes Phoebe Kreutz, Matt Colbourn, Deenah Vollmer, Austin Kilham. The group, which has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502140013/http://thepizzaunderground.tumblr.com/">a very amusing Tumblr</a> along with a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502140013/https://twitter.com/cheesedayz">Twitter account</a> and a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502140013/http://thepizzaunderground.bandcamp.com/">Bandcamp page</a>, first formed in Feb. 2012 (as they graciously <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502140013/https://twitter.com/cheesedayz/status/409555802723086336">told us over Twitter</a>). </p>

<p>Kreutz <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502140013/http://www.vulture.com/2013/12/pizza-underground-macaulay-culkin-velvet-origin-story.html">told Vulture a little more about</a> the origins of the group, how they view themselves (&quot;more of an art project than a band-band&quot;), their plans for playing live in the future, and how Culkin got involved: &quot;Mac just joined the band a few months ago. We were on indefinite hiatus when Mac put that extra spice in our sauce that we needed to get going again.&quot;</p>
