</div></div>					<p>We&apos;ve seen some weird things on the subway, including <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429111829/http://gothamist.com/2010/11/22/video_subway_flasher_gets_verbal_ab.php">flashers</a>, blurry <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429111829/http://gothamist.com/2010/10/07/get_a_room_extreme_bad_subway_behav.php">tongue action</a>, and even the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429111829/http://gothamist.com/2010/11/05/kardashians.php">Kardashians</a>. But a tipster sent us the above pictures of some serious PDA (warning: the second one is <strong>NSFW</strong>), and this account of their gross close-encounter:</p>

<blockquote>So I&apos;ve lived in NYC for fifteen years, never seen anything X-rated on the subway, aside from one or two peeping Toms. Yesterday, around 7 p.m., on Brooklyn bound L train starting from 6th avenue, a guy was going to town feeling up his (presumably) girlfriend, in plain sight of everyone (she had a short skirt or dress, he had it pushed up, hand down her stockings). A kid of about 8/9 was sitting right behind them (eventually his mom got him up and into another section of the car--over his objections; poor woman probably had a lot of questions to answer). People either looked on in shock or moved away; no one said anything. Their activity apparently arrived at a successful conclusion en route to brooklyn, and they exited the train in a daze at Bedford St....Is public sex now acceptable? Is crazy drunken behavior at any time of day now the norm? Random crazy incident?</blockquote>

<p>Well, we knew that the L in the L Train stood <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429111829/http://gothamist.com/2010/06/29/l_train_named_most_romantic_subway.php">for love</a>, but we don&apos;t think this level of PDA is anyone&apos;s idea of a lovely time.</p>
