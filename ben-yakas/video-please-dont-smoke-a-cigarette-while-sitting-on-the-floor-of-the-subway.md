<p>This straphanger in the video below seems to be living in a warped rendition of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150328003814/http://www.chabad.org/multimedia/media_cdo/aid/255530/jewish/Dayenu.htm">&quot;Dayenu&quot;</a>, the Jewish song of gratefulness. It would have been annoying enough if he were sitting on the floor of the train, it would have been obnoxious enough if he were smoking a cigarette, it would have been unpleasant enough if he were making irritating sounds&#x2014;but this gentleman went ahead and did all three, a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150328003814/http://gothamist.com/tags/subwayetiquette">subway etiquette</a> trifecta.</p>

<p>He does make one good point though: that other straphanger really is basically wearing boxers on the subway. But cigarette smoking is only meant for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150328003814/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/07/weekend_at_bernies_subway_shark.php#photo-1">dead sharks trying to beat rush hour.</a> And it isn&apos;t like this guy couldn&apos;t just wait to smoke when he got home&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150328003814/http://nypost.com/2013/09/22/city-apartment-buildings-consider-going-smoke-free/">err, well, he probably could.</a></p>
