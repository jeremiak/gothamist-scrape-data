<p>Almost immediately after Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and his brother Tamerlan were identified by the FBI as the main suspects <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717103814/http://gothamist.com/tags/bostonmarathon">in the Boston Marathon bombing</a> that left three people dead and hundreds injured, people started popping up on social media to stridently defend them and claim this has all been a conspiracy. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717103814/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/national/girls_lovesick_twisted_OLK6eLVJM5U6618gAVXT0O">NY Post talked to some of the people</a> embracing this #FreeJahar thing, and found that many of the defenders are teenage girls who think that Dzhokhar is just too cute to be guilty, because (SURPRISE) teenagers are dumb. </p>

<p>Alisha, an 18-year-old from Kansas, told them she was getting one of Jahar&#x2019;s tweets ( &#x201C;If you have the knowledge and the inspiration, all that&#x2019;s left is to take action&#x201D;) tattooed on her arm: &#x201C;He was just this pothead 19-year-old boy who didn&#x2019;t care,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t see it.&#x201D; Perhaps she didn&apos;t see the video evidence of the bombing; or the reports <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717103814/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/02/boston_marathon_bomb_suspects_origi.php">about the bomb materials</a> that were in Dzhokhar&apos;s dorm room; or the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717103814/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/26/carjacking_victim_told_boston_bomb.php">account of the car jacking victim</a> who said they bragged about their crimes; or Dzhokhar&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717103814/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/23/alleged_boston_bomber_blames_his_ji.php">own confession to police.</a></p>

<p>&#x201C;Yes i like Justin Bieber and i like Jahar but that has nothing to do with why i support him. I know hes innocent, he is far too beautiful,&#x201D; tweeted FreeJahar97, who identified herself on Twitter as &#x201C;Gianna,&#x201D; a 16-year-old with &#x201C;big boobs.&quot; As <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717103814/http://gawker.com/freejahar-when-conspiracy-theorists-and-one-direction-478152664">Gawker pointed out</a>, some of these kids&#x2014;especially friend Troy Crossley, who seems to have sparked the &quot;movement&quot;&#x2014;are aware of how they are perceived by the media, and try to distance themselves from being labelled &quot;fangirls,&quot; despite the fact that that&apos;s exactly what they are. And Crossley, in particular, seems as interested in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717103814/https://www.facebook.com/pages/Troy-Crossley-MP/157979600947958">promoting himself and his music</a> as anything else.</p>

<p>If you really feel like jumping down the rabbit hole, it runs pretty deep, and not just the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717103814/https://twitter.com/search?q=%23freejahar&amp;src=hash">Twitter hashtags</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717103814/https://www.facebook.com/groups/tsarnaev/?fref=ts">Facebook groups</a> (that one has 6,500 followers now). <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717103814/http://www.tumblr.com/tagged/freejahar">Go here to see all the Tumblrs</a> tagged &quot;Free Jahar;&quot; look here <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717103814/http://jahardforjahar.tumblr.com/">for Jahar fan fiction</a>; and you can check two individual sites <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717103814/http://freejahartsarnaev.tumblr.com/">here</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717103814/http://jatsar.tumblr.com/">here</a>, chockfull of dreamy photoshopped pictures and hopeless devotion. But if you want to save your clicks for something far more noble, check out this video <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717103814/http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=Cnstd0ASQHg#!">of a pug watching the final scene of <em>Homeward Bound</em></a>!</p>
