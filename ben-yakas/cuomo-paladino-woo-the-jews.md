<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="10610paljews.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412160541im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/10610paljews.jpg" width="240" height="157" class="image-left"> </span>Both Carl Paladino and Andrew Cuomo took time out of their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412160541/http://gothamist.com/tags/election2010">frantic gubernatorial schedules</a> this week to meet with Jewish leaders in Brooklyn to kiss some rings and try to scrum up some votes. Paladino, who called himself &quot;<strong>unintimidatable</strong>&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412160541/http://www.nydailynews.com/blogs/dailypolitics/2010/10/carl-paladino-is-also-seeking.html">during his meeting</a>, was introduced by Rabbi Yehuda Levin, who defended Paladino&apos;s comments against &quot;baby killing&quot; Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, and thinks by &quot;spiritual perspective&quot; that Paladino will be governor:  &quot;...our values are too important to be left to the left-leaning losers of the Orthodox community who are selling our heritage and our Godly values for a bunch of lentils, scheckles and pottage. No more. <strong>Carl Paladino is the arising of a new era.&quot;</strong></p>

<p>Rabbi Levin&apos;s support aside, Cuomo definitely had the more <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412160541/http://www.politico.com/blogs/maggiehaberman/1010/Cuomo_meets_with_ultraOrthodox_Jewish_leaders_.html">productive outing</a>, despite an uncomfortable run-in with embattled party boss Vito Lopez. According to a new Siena College poll, three-quarters of Jews favor Cuomo, and only 16 percent said they&apos;d vote for Paladino. &#x201C;Even if the margin of error was 10 percent,<strong> you&#x2019;re talking about a blowout among Jewish voters for Cuomo,</strong>&#x201D; said Siena pollster Steven Greenberg. Interestingly, the largest share of ethnic support for Cuomo is African Americans, who chose Cuomo at a rate of 94 percent to 0 for Paladino <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412160541/http://www.thejewishweek.com/news/new_york/poll_gives_cuomo_wide_lead_among_jews">according to Siena</a>.</p>

<p>One Jew who is definitely voting for Cuomo: former Mayor Ed Koch, who gave his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412160541/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/former_mayor_ed_koch_endorses_andrew_ZqyAtdIYP8QPjzkMj5xXbN">official endorsement</a> to the current Attorney General, saying he &quot;has put forth a thorough agenda to achieve independence, accountability and transparency.&quot; It&apos;s an endorsement that carries some weight, considering all the bad blood and innuendo that has gone on  between the two after the infamous 1977 &#x201C;Vote For Cuomo, Not the Homo&#x201D; smear  campaign, which Rabbi Levin also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412160541/http://www.nydailynews.com/blogs/dailypolitics/2010/09/rabbi-yehuda-levin-resurrects.html">brought up</a> this week. Koch <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412160541/http://www.esquire.com/features/andrew-cuomo-bio-0510-2">told Esquire</a> that he doesn&apos;t attribute it to the Cuomos however: &quot;<strong>Andrew says he didn&apos;t do it, and I believe him.</strong> Mario says he thinks he now knows who did it. I was very angry at the time...But I&apos;ve forgiven them. I&apos;m eighty-five now, and grudges take your energy away. I&apos;ve forgiven them all.&quot;</p>
