<p>There are only three episodes left of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407191858/http://gothamist.com/tags/breakingbad"><em>Breaking Bad</em></a>, only three more chances to appreciate those hazy Albuquerque sunsets with a case of the finest Schraderbrau. But it won&apos;t be the last time you get to spend time with colorful metaphor-machine Saul Goodman. AMC and <em>Breaking Bad</em> producer Sony Pictures TV have reached a licensing agreement for a spinoff focusing on everyone&apos;s favorite shady lawyer, played by Bob Odenkirk. This is a trip to Belize we&apos;ll gladly take.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407191858/http://www.deadline.com/2013/09/breaking-bad-saul-goodman-spinoff-amc-series/#utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter">According to Deadline</a>, the series&#x2014;tentatively titled <em>Better Call Saul</em>&#x2014;will be a one-hour prequel that will focus on the evolution of the Goodman character before he ever became Walter White&#x2019;s lawyer. It has a series order pending the complication of Sony TV&#x2019;s deals with Vince Gilligan, character creator/writer Peter Gould and Odenkirk. Don&apos;t underestimate how important Gould is to all this:</p>

Also, Odenkirk told me he delivered his lines as (1/2)</p>&#x2014; Rob Tannenbaum (@tannenbaumr) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407191858/https://twitter.com/tannenbaumr/statuses/377892451253780480">September 11, 2013</a></blockquote>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>written by Gould, no improv or ad libs. I&apos;m confident Gould can create a universe around Saul. (And Huell.) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407191858/https://twitter.com/search?q=%23betterwatchSaul&amp;src=hash">#betterwatchSaul</a> (2/2)</p>&#x2014; Rob Tannenbaum (@tannenbaumr) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407191858/https://twitter.com/tannenbaumr/statuses/377892772977844226">September 11, 2013</a></blockquote>

<p>TV writers are cautiously excited about the prequel: &quot;&apos;Cause somebody asked, here&apos;s what I&apos;d want from #BetterCallSaul prequel: Light serialization, more breezy procedural. Like Rockford Files,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407191858/https://twitter.com/jmittell/status/377892307833724928">tweeted media studies professor Jason Mittell</a>. &quot;#BetterCallSaul faces impossible task in fan expectations to be just like BB. It needs to clearly be totally different in tone.&quot; It does seem as though the show would work better in 30 minute installments as opposed to <em>Breaking Bad&apos;s</em> hour long tensionfests, but as long as Huell is along for the ride, we&apos;ll be happy to see what they come up with.</p>
