<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140307030522/http://www.mnn.com/earth-matters/wilderness-resources/photos/13-amazing-sinkholes/famous-pits">Sinkholes</a> are probably the scariest thing this side of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140307030522/http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2014/02/20/viking-apocalypse-end-of-the-world-saturday/5643717/">Ragnar&#xF6;k</a>, but for the most part, NYC has been spared from falling into any cavernous holes in the ground (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140307030522/http://gothamist.com/2014/02/05/photos_nyers_show_strength_as_they.php">besides slushpuddles</a>, of course). But all that changed yesterday when a Long Island woman&apos;s car was swallowed up by her driveway. </p>

<p>&quot;There was no sound. The car just slid into the ground,&quot; Gayle Sorrentino of Rockville Centre <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140307030522/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/hole-swallows-car-long-island-woman-driveway-crumbles-article-1.1654627">told the News</a> about her experience Friday afternoon. Sorrentino, 69, was returning from an acupuncture appointment when the ground opened up with her still in the vehicle. &quot;The car went in at like a straight angle,&quot; she said. &quot;I pulled in looking at my beautiful backyard and then I was looking at a mound of dirt.&quot;</p>

<p>Sorentino called 911, and wasn&apos;t hurt in the incident: &quot;I was only afraid&#x2014;the sand around started to come down a little bit, and I just didn&apos;t know if it was going to stay stationary or going to collapse,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140307030522/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Car-in-Sinkhole-Long-Island-Rockville-Centre--246577781.html">she told NBC.</a> Her neighbor thinks the sinkhole opened up over a dry well from the 1920s, while authorities believe it is a &quot;cesspool.&quot; Regardless, nothing ruins an acupuncture high like staring into a deep abyss in the ground.</p>
