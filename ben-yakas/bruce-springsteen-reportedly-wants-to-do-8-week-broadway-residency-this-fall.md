<p>It kind of seems unbelievable, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170616203714/http://gothamist.com/tags/brucespringsteen">Bruce Springsteen</a> finished his last tour in February after playing almost 90 shows (!!) the year prior (and that doesn&apos;t include all his appearances promoting his memoir, <em>Born To Run</em>). Since then, the indefatigable 66-year-old musician has mostly taken a well-deserved break (with occasional events like the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170616203714/http://gothamist.com/2017/05/01/bruce_springsteen_tom_hanks_tribeca.php">Tribeca Film Festival talk with Tom Hanks</a>). But taking it easy is for The Eagles&#x2014;so The Boss is reportedly looking into booking an <em>eight-week residency</em> on the Great White Way this fall. Who does he think he is, Billy Joel?</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170616203714/http://nypost.com/2017/06/16/bruce-springsteen-heads-to-broadway-this-fall/">The NY Post reports today</a> that Springsteen is in talks to make his Broadway debut at the Walter Kerr Theatre for an eight-week run starting around November. &quot;He wants to play a smaller house,&quot; a theater source told them. &quot;He wants to try something more intimate, and he likes the idea of being on Broadway.&quot; Apparently, Jujamcyn Theaters, which owns the Kerr, has offered him free rent for the eight weeks: &#x201C;He&#x2019;ll keep the lights on in the building, and they&#x2019;ll sell gazillions of dollars worth of booze,&quot; the source added.</p>

<p>While none of the details <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170616203714/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/bruce-springsteen-plans-intimate-broadway-residency-w488366">have been confirmed</a> by Springsteen&apos;s people, the source claims Springsteen would play as many as five shows a week, with a &quot;pared-down&quot; version of his normal set; it&apos;s unclear if this would be a totally solo tour, or include some version of the E-Street Band.</p>

<p>Springsteen, who released <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170616203714/http://gothamist.com/2017/04/19/bruce_springsteen_trump_protest_song.php">an anti-Trump protest song</a> with frequent collaborator Joe Grushecky earlier this year, is expected to release a new solo album this year that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170616203714/https://www.jimmywebb.com/the-news/2016/9/7/bruce-springsteen-cites-jimmy-webb-and-glen-campbell-as-influences-on-new-album">he has compared</a> to the work of Jimmy Webb and Glenn Campbell (&quot;pop records with a lot of strings and instrumentation&quot;). This residency would almost certainly be in support of that record, which is already completed.</p>

<p>The Post article also mentioned that Springsteen is toying with the idea of turning his memoir, into a jukebox musical &#xE0; la <em>Movin&apos; Out</em> or <em>Beautiful: The Carole King Musical.</em>, which would be a very lucrative, if creatively-questionable, decision. If they decide to put on that musical at the Walter Kerr Theater as well, I guess I&apos;ll get a firsthand look at it, since I plan on chaining myself inside the theater in anticipation of the residency.</p>
