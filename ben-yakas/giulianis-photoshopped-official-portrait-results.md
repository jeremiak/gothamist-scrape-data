</div></div>					<p>Yesterday, we <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140625064441/http://gothamist.com/2010/10/28/official_portrait_of_giuliani_kinda.php">highlighted</a> the new Rudy Giuliani official portrait, which makes him look a little more like John Lithgow, Gerald Ford and Harry Truman than Rudy. Then we put up a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140625064441/http://gothamist.com/2010/10/28/an_upgraded_version_of_giulianis_po.php">photoshopped picture</a> made by a commenter, which many found to be too provocative. Today, we have some less controversial, photoshopped versions of the portrait to share with you.</p>
