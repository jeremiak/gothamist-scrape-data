<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150222194754/http://gothamist.com/tags/normalbob">Normal Bob Smith</a> has been documenting life amongst the weird and woozy regulars at Union Square for years now with his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150222194754/http://www.normalbobsmith.com/amazingstrangers/">Amazing Strangers site</a>&#x2014;they&apos;re all unique characters, from the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150222194754/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/04/video_union_square_butt_sniffer_is.php">butt sniffers</a> to the horde of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150222194754/http://www.normalbobsmith.com/amazingstrangers/peepers/">creepy peepers</a>. But the Tupac fan in the video below deserves special recognition for his incredible, unmistakable, undeniable swagger. He truly is the purest manifestation of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150222194754/http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=DGAF">DGAF.</a></p>

<p>We really wish he used a more enlightened phrase than &quot;bitches don&apos;t know,&quot; but it is the pure physicality of his gait that entrances us, despite the misogynistic content of his speech. Normal Bob captured him at least one other time in the video below, writing: &quot;The guy strutting around in the video spent most of 2013 strutting around just like that around the park. That&apos;s all the explanation I&apos;ve got on him as of yet.&quot;</p>
