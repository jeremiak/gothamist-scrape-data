<p>People have been extra riled up and angry at the Sanitation Department over their underwhelming performance cleaning up snow and trash after the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141108064605/http://gothamist.com/tags/blizzard2010">Blizzageddon</a> a few weeks back. But maybe people have been too hard on them&#x2014;after all, it&apos;s not like they went to Harvard or anything! Except, they did: several top sanitation officials who are being investigated for the alleged <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141108064605/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/02/slowdown_report.php">slowdown</a> <em>were</em> sent to Harvard for training&#x2014;and it was paid for courtesy of taxpayers.</p>

<p>Ten sanitation bosses <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141108064605/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2011/01/13/2011-01-13_sanitation_guys_go_to_harvard__and_you_pay.html">were sent</a> to Harvard for &quot;management programs&quot; between 2004 and 2008, that cost taxpayers a total of $106,000. Those bosses include City Sanitation Department Supervisor Steven Harbin, Deputy Director Dennis Diggins, Sanitation Chief Peter McKeon and Director John Nucatola. Besides the expenses for attending Harvard&apos;s John F. Kennedy School of Government, the bosses also charged taxpayers for meals, gas and parking during their two week courses; the News has a breakdown of their six-digit salaries and expenses <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141108064605/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2011/01/13/2011-01-13_sanitation_guys_go_to_harvard__and_you_pay.html">here</a>. </p>

<p>In the aftermath of the snow removal <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141108064605/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/11/officals_beg_forgiveness_for_weak_b.php">disaster</a>, these bosses were told not to destroy emails or documents while the DOI looks for criminal wrongdoing in the disastrous blizzard response. The News adds that the department &quot;couldn&apos;t immediately supply the reports city employees must file describing what they learned in their Ivy League outings.&quot; What nuggets of wisdom might be stored in these waste-management artisans journals? </p>
