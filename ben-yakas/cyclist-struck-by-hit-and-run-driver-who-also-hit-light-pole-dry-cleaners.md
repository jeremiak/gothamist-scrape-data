<p>A cyclist was struck by a hit-and-run driver in Manhattan early this morning. According to FDNY, the 25-year-old male cyclist was hit by the gold Infiniti sedan on Madison Avenue and East 29th Street around 6:35 a.m. The cyclist was taken to Bellevue Hospital in stable condition. </p>

<p>Witnesses <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406153630/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/mayhem_crashing_manhattan_into_store_UC3cN76OzcADmvsx0QPqWO?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20Manhattan">told the Post that</a> after hitting the cyclist, the driver went the wrong way down East 29th Street, and ran into a light pole after he went over the curb near the Lexington intersection. The driver dragged the pole across the street, then drove into a dry cleaning business at 137 Lexington Avenue.</p>

<p>&quot;He was easily going 40 to 50 mph,&quot; cab driver Robert told the Post. &quot;It was a loud crash. You could hear the steel of the pole dragging across the street.&quot; The driver then fled the scene on foot eastward. &quot;He ran, he booked, [he] was absolutely panicked,&quot; said Robert.<br>
