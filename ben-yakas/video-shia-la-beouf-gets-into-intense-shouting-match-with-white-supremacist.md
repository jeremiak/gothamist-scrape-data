<p>On Inauguration Day, Shia LaBeouf launched <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170126004544/http://gothamist.com/2017/01/20/shia_labeouf_anti-trump_livestream.php">an anti-Trump livestream event</a> outside the Museum of the Moving Image. The project, dubbed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170126004544/http://www.hewillnotdivide.us/">&quot;HEWILLNOTDIVIDE.US,&quot;</a> will be up for the next four years (in theory), but it&apos;s already attracted plenty of attention from those on both sides of the political aisle. LaBeouf, who has been out there for parts of the weekend, has had a few run-ins with real life trolls as a result, including one intense shouting match with a white supremacist. </p>

<p>As Raw Story <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170126004544/http://www.rawstory.com/2017/01/watch-shia-labeouf-shouts-down-white-supremacist-until-he-flees-during-anti-trump-livestream/">points out</a>, the man appears at the beginning of the video where he says &#x201C;14,&#x201D; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170126004544/http://www.adl.org/combating-hate/hate-on-display/c/14-words.html?referrer=https://www.google.com/#.WIY0ZbYrKRs">a rallying call</a> to white supremacists. As he started to say slogans like &quot;We must secure the existence of the white people...,&quot; LaBeouf steps in and begins shouting in the man&apos;s face (without ever laying a hand on him). Eventually, he&apos;s able to scare him away with the power of his chanting.</p>

<p>This wasn&apos;t the only such incident: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170126004544/http://consequenceofsound.net/2017/01/shia-labeoufs-four-year-donald-trump-protest-is-off-to-a-rocky-start/">Consequence Of Sound writes</a> that Reddit users and followers of the 4Chan /pol/ thread have started organizing counter protests, by bringing pro-Trump signs or pictures of Pepe the Frog, which has become an Alt-Right meme. You can see a few examples of that below.</p>

<p>Visitors are invited to stand in front of a camera mounted on a wall outside the Astoria museum and say the phrase, &quot;He Will Not Divide Us&quot; as many times as they want. LaBeouf is working with Nastja S&#xE4;de R&#xF6;nkk&#xF6; and Luke Turner on this project, with whom he also collaborated on #ALLMYMOVIES and that thing where he hitchhiked for art. If you&apos;re lucky, LaBeouf may even bring you some food.</p>
