<p>Labor Day Weekend is the symbolic end of the summer, and people have been going totally bonkers as a result. The news has been filled with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424161309/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/02/queens_couple_murdered_execution-st.php">execution-style murders</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424161309/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/03/police_believe_long_island_baby_suf.php">tragedies</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424161309/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/03/bloomberg_keeps_out_of_sight_as_que.php">domestic violence shadiness</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424161309/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/03/cyclist_struck_and_killed_by_suv_in.php">cyclist deaths</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424161309/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/04/video_union_square_butt_sniffer_is.php">butt sniffers</a>. Just this morning, Mayor Bloomberg <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424161309/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/04/eight_people_shot_injured_at_bronx.php">stated that</a> there were 25 shootings reported in the city last night alone! Everyone needs to take a step back, say &quot;serenity now,&quot; and try to peaceably enjoy the rest of the break before reality kicks in on Tuesday. To that end, here&apos;s a video of an adorable bulldog getting licked by a cop&apos;s horse. Remember: be like the bulldog, enjoy the last summer licking, and play safe kids.</p>
