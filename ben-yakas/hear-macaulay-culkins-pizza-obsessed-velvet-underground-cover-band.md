                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="12713pizzaundergorund.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20140205202302im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/12713pizzaundergorund.jpg" width="640" height="458"> <br> <i> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140205202302/http://thepizzaunderground.tumblr.com/">via Pizza Underground Tumblr</a></i></div> <p></p>

<p>We all need our hobbies&#x2014;some people like to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140205202302/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/21/cops_say_jersey_physics_professor_m.php">promote prostitution</a>, some <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140205202302/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/08/15_grenades_120_guns_explosives_wer.php">collect explosives</a>, others <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140205202302/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/16/insanely_detailed_website_maps_all.php">obsess over <em>Seinfeld</em></a>. As for actor Macaulay Culkin, his hobbies apparently include changing all the lyrics of Velvet Underground and Lou Reed songs to pizza references, and playing those covers with his band, The Pizza Underground.</p>

<p>Above, you can hear the only lo-fi recording from the band, which was &quot;recorded live at Macaulay Culkin&apos;s house on November 11, 2013.&quot; The medley, on which Culkin is credited for playing &quot;percussion/kazoo/vocals,&quot; includes &quot;Papa John Says&quot; (&quot;Stephanie Says&quot;), &quot;I&apos;m Beginning to Eat the Slice&quot; (&quot;Beginning To See The Light&quot;), &quot;Pizza&quot; (&quot;Sweet Jane&quot;), &quot;I&apos;m Waiting for Delivery Man&quot; (&quot;I&apos;m Waiting For The Man&quot;), &quot;Cheese Days&quot; (&quot;These Days,&quot; written by Jackson Browne for Nico, so we guess this counts), &quot;Pizza Day&quot; (&quot;Perfect Day&quot;), &quot;All the Pizza Parties&quot; (&quot;All Tomorrow&apos;s Parties&quot;), &quot;Pizza Gal&quot; (&quot;Femme Fatale&quot;) and &quot;Take a Bite of the Wild Slice&quot; (&quot;Walk On The Wild Side&quot;).</p>

<p>In addition to Culkin, the band includes Phoebe Kreutz, Matt Colbourn, Deenah Vollmer, Austin Kilham. The group, which has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140205202302/http://thepizzaunderground.tumblr.com/">a very amusing Tumblr</a> along with a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140205202302/https://twitter.com/cheesedayz">Twitter account</a> and a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140205202302/http://thepizzaunderground.bandcamp.com/">Bandcamp page</a>, seems to have emerged in the days right after Reed died, so sure, we all mourn in our own ways. It&apos;s played at least one <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140205202302/http://www.sidewalkny.com/down-with-the-underground/">show at Sidewalk Cafe in honor of Reed</a> (and a few other after parties and such things), but it&apos;s unclear whether they plan on performing their pepperoni and mushroom-obsessed tunes for a wider audience. We guess we&apos;ll have to see whether people are craving it enough to want a pizza it in their lives. </p>
