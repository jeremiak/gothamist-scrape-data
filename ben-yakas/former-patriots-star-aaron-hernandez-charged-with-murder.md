<p>The former Patriots star tight end Aaron Hernandez, who was cut by the team this morning, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405015006/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/national/patriots_star_hernandez_taken_into_R0jvgz2juNoDs3TIoC2ciP">has been charged with murder</a> in the death of Odin Lloyd. Hernandez, 23, was arrested around 9 a.m. this morning in his North Attleboro mansion. He pleaded not guilty to counts of murder, unlawful possession of a firearm, and possession of a large capacity firearm.</p>

<p>Hernandez, a Pro Bowl tight end who was drafted by the Pats in 2010, was arrested in connection to the shooting of 27-year-old semi-pro football player Lloyd, who was dating the sister of Hernandez&apos;s fiancee. Lloyd&apos;s body was found at a North Attleboro industrial park on June 17, about a half-mile from Hernandez&#x2019;s home. Hernandez and Lloyd had been spotted together, along with two other men, the night before he was found.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405015006/http://deadspin.com/aaron-hernandez-charged-with-murder-588065097">Authorities searched</a> Hernandez&apos;s home last week, and found that he allegedly &quot;intentionally destroyed&quot; his home video surveillance system. A cell phone belonging to Hernandez was given to the police &quot;in pieces&quot; by his attorney.</p>

<p>The Patriots <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405015006/http://www.patriots.com/news/article-1/Patriots-Release-Tight-End-Aaron-Hernandez/69fbee29-d53e-4f8d-88c6-de53da754e73">released this statement</a> this morning:</p>

<blockquote>A young man was murdered last week and we extend our sympathies to the family and friends who mourn his loss. Words cannot express the disappointment we feel knowing that one of our players was arrested as a result of this investigation. We realize that law enforcement investigations into this matter are ongoing. We support their efforts and respect the process. At this time, we believe this transaction is simply the right thing to do.</blockquote>
