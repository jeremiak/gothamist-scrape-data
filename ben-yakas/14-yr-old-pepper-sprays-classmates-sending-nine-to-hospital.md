The incident occurred yesterday around 2 p.m. at the Academy for Social Action, which is one of four schools at 509 W. 129th Street. One student <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150108235813/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/harlem_students_hospitalized_after_08xKjfGgj76KampSQp2xcO?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">told the Post </a>that the girl had reportedly &quot;sprayed the irritant indiscriminately into the air.&quot;<p></p>

<p>The maced students <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150108235813/http://gamma.dnainfo.com/20111129/harlem/students-pepper-sprayed-at-harlem-junior-high">were all taken</a> to nearby St. Luke&apos;s-Roosevelt hospital with minor injuries. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150108235813/http://online.wsj.com/article/APdb2ce7967233407283467e8d1e52e388.html">The Department of Education says</a> the 14-year-old was given a juvenile report, and school officials are investigating the incident. The Academy for Social Action, a C-rated high school, made headlines last year when the former Principal and Assistant Principal <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150108235813/http://gothamist.com/2010/11/14/doe_seeking_to_terminate_lesbian_ad.php">were fired</a> after they were discovered to have been embroiled in a two-year long affair which came to an end in a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150108235813/http://gothamist.com/2010/11/12/death_threats_reveal_lesbian_school.php">hail of firing requests and death threats.</a></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150108235813/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/14/17_high_school_students.php">Last month</a>, 17 students from the Bronx High School For Law &amp; Community Service were sent to the hospital and treated for minor injuries after an unknown assailant pepper sprayed them.</p>
