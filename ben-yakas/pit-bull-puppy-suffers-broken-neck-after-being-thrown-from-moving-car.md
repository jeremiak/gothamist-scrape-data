<p>A pit bull puppy <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424161230/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/mistreated-pit-bull-puppy-thrown-moving-car-long-island-fights-live-broken-neck-article-1.1136110">was hospitalized with a broken neck</a> after being brutally thrown from a moving car in Long Island this weekend. According to the ASPCA, three-month-old pup Joey was thrown onto the Pilgrim Psychiatric Center property near the Sagtikos Parkway in Brentwood on Saturday. Joey, who was tossed out in a trash bag, fractured six neck vertebrae when he hit the ground: &quot;He was screaming to the point where we had to anesthetize him to get his pain under control,&quot; Dr. Lynda Louden, chief of the Veterinary Medical Center of Long Island&apos;s emergency department, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424161230/http://www.newsday.com/long-island/suffolk/pit-bull-puppy-flung-out-of-car-neck-fractured-1.3903124?p=">told Newsday.</a></p>

<p>In addition to his neck injuries, doctors say Joey was malnourished, covered with fleas, and had bite marks on his neck, which might indicate the pup had been used as a bait dog by dog fighters. Loudon said that doctors expect Joey to get better: &quot;We think he&apos;s got a good chance at survival,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424161230/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Puppy-Pit-Bull-Broken-Neck-Authorities-Cruelty-Prevention-Animals-Reward-166114176.html">she told NBC</a>. But it will probably take another three to four months, and they&apos;re unsure if he&apos;ll be able to recover use of all four of his legs. </p>

<p>The Suffolk County Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals is currently offering a $2,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of whoever threw Joey out the car. On the plus side, there are already at least 15 requests of potential owners eager to adopt him: &quot;He gives us kisses every time we try to go in and help him,&quot; said Loudon. &quot;He&apos;s gonna be a good dog for somebody.&quot;</p>
