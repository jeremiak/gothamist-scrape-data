<p>Last Wednesday, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130915203417/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/04/video_man_screaming_i_hate_white_pe.php">a man was arrested</a> in Union Square after allegedly attacking three people in broad daylight in what appears to be a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130915203417/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/06/union_square_possible_hate_crime.php">racially-motivated attack</a>. Victim Jeffery Babbitt, 62, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130915203417/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/10/victim_in_random_union_square_attac.php">died Monday morning</a> at Bellevue Hospital after being <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130915203417/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/07/victim_of_bloody_union_square_rampa.php">declared brain dead</a> over the weekend. Suspect Martin Redrick, a.k.a. Lashawn Marten, said there was no racial component to the incident: &#x201C;I&#x2019;ve punched white people. I&#x2019;ve punched brown people. I&#x2019;ve punched Hispanic people,&#x201D; he told the Daily News <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130915203417/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/lashawn-marten-race-factor-attack-jeffrey-babbitt-article-1.1454475">during an interview in the prison ward in Bellevue Hospital.</a>. &#x201C;So what? I don&#x2019;t target anyone.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Redrick, who has a history of mental illness (including schizophrenia), was hanging out by the chess tables in the park last week when he became angry, possibly because no one wanted to play him; sources told us he jumped up and shouted, &quot;I hate white people,&quot; then struck Babbitt. &quot;He said &apos;The next white person who walks by, I&apos;m going to [expletive],&apos;&quot; one female witness told WCBS.</p>

<p>Redrick&apos;s family <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130915203417/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/11/nyregion/man-charged-in-fatal-park-assault-had-long-history-of-racial-conflict.html?ref=nyregion&amp;_r=0">told the Times this week</a> that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130915203417/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/11/family_says_union_square_rampage_su.php">he has had a complicated relationship</a> with race. &#x201C;Martin did not like authority and as we were growing up, the only people with authority were white people,&#x201D; his brother Joseph Redrick told them. &#x201C;A lot of times that problem with authority was transferred to white people.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Among other things, Redrick bragged about getting away with previous crimes: &#x201C;You think I&#x2019;m afraid of these charges?&#x201D; he asked. &#x201C;I punched a police officer in Newburgh in front of a crowd of people and all his colleagues and I was out of jail in 168 hours,&#x201D; he said. Redrick served six months in prison for that incident.</p>

<p>He has been charged with felony assault for the Union Square incident, but new charges are expected to be added next week. He was cagey about answering questions about Babbitt:  &#x201C;Where&#x2019;s the autopsy report? Where&#x2019;s the death certificate?&#x201D; he asked. &#x201C;You&#x2019;ve got to know when to fold &#x2019;em and know when to hold &#x2019;em. I&#x2019;m saving those details for trial.&#x201D;</p>
