<p>A Goldman Sachs banker <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130924000946/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/22/goldman_sachs_banker_accused_of_rap.php">who was arrested last month</a> for allegedly raping a woman in the East Hamptons claims the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130924000946/http://nypost.com/2013/09/21/goldman-sachs-banker-charged-with-rape/">sex was consensual</a>. Jason Lee, 37, has been charged with first degree rape for allegedly attacking the 20-year-old woman on August 20th in a bathroom at a home he had rented in East Hampton.</p>

<p>Lee, a married Tribeca resident and managing director at Goldman Sachs, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130924000946/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/23/alleged_goldman_sachs_rapist_makes.php">had been celebrating his birthday</a> with friends at a club in Wainscott when he invited the woman and her friends back to his rental home. The woman claims that once at the house, Lee undressed and followed her into the bathroom; he then allegedly shoved his way through the door and began raping the woman before she stopped the attack with a knee to his groin.</p>

<p>The victim tried to keep the door closed but Lee &#x201C;shoved it open with enough force to cause her to fall to the floor, where Lee immediately pinned her,&#x201D; said Suffolk County District Attorney Tom Spota. Lee maintains that the sex was consensual: &#x201C;We have what is an apparent rush to arrest my client, a rush to the grand jury and a rush to indict my client,&#x201D; said his attorney Edward Burke Jr. Lee is currently on a leave of absence from Goldman Sachs&apos; equity capital markets department. </p>
