<p>Mayor Bloomberg can be a cascading fountain of unsolicited advice, gushing with wisdom about everything from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504174336/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/01/mayor_bloomberg_offers_his_dieting.php">dieting tips</a> to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504174336/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/28/mayor_bloomberg_gives_advice_on_avo.php">iPhone safety</a> to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504174336/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/28/at_last_wisconsin_gets_advice_from.php">Wisconsin</a>. On his WOR radio program yesterday, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504174336/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/skip-college-plumber-mayor-bloomberg-article-1.1347576">he gave some heartfelt advice</a> to average people about the realities of education and debt: &quot;The people who are going to have the biggest problem are college graduates who aren&apos;t rocket scientists, if you will, not at the top of their class,&quot; he said. &quot;Compare a plumber to going to Harvard College&#x2014;<strong>being a plumber, actually for the average person, probably would be a better deal</strong>.&quot; As Jesus said, &quot;Not everyone can accept this word, but only those to whom Google Glass has been given.&quot;</p>

<p>Bloomberg cited a number of studies showing that plumbers start their careers with less debt, higher wages, and 100% more <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504174336/http://www.bitrebels.com/entertainment-2/how-to-turn-ugly-plumbers-crack-into-sexy-cleavage/">plumber&apos;s crack</a> than their collegiate peers. &#x201C;You don&#x2019;t spend...four years spending $40,000, $50,000 in tuition without earning income,&#x201D; he said. And best of all, plumbers can&apos;t be replaced by machines...yet. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s hard to farm that out ... and it&#x2019;s hard to automate that,&#x201D; he said.</p>
