<p>The impending <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170616122257/http://gothamist.com/tags/ltrain">L train shutdown</a> will provide plenty of excuses to avoid Williamsburg in the future, but it isn&apos;t supposed to get underway until a few years from now&#x2014;here&apos;s a reason to avoid the neighborhood even sooner, unless, of course, you&apos;re into this sort of thing. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170616122257/http://gothamist.com/tags/santacon">SantaCon 2016</a> will start in Williamsburg at 10 a.m. on December 10th. </p>

<p>As with previous years, the parade start location and route will not be revealed until shortly before the actual event&#x2014;you can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170616122257/https://www.facebook.com/events/948970395193033/">check their Facebook</a> for updates on that (there is also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170616122257/http://santacon.nyc/">a list of participating bars on their website</a>, though it isn&apos;t clear if this is the updated list for 2016 or not). Even so, SantaCon has gotten more transparent about its workings in the face of increasing hostility from across the city&#x2014;hostilities that forced the event to leave the comfy confines of midtown Manhattan for gentrified Brooklyn in recent years. </p>

<p>We&apos;ve been covering the event almost as long as its been going on, so we know what to expect: we&apos;ve seen all the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170616122257/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/13/one_santa_arrested_one_santa_hospit.php">drunken brawling</a>, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170616122257/http://gothamist.com/2013/12/15/watch_santacon_videos_to_remind_you.php">nightmare</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170616122257/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/16/watch_the_drunk_santacon_video_roun.php">fighting</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170616122257/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/27/worst_santacon_videos.php">videos</a>, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170616122257/http://gothamist.com/2013/12/16/video_santa_receives_terrible_handj.php">Duane Reade handjobs</a>, the First Amendment <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170616122257/http://gothamist.com/2014/12/13/santacon_2014_siegel.php">press conferences</a>, the moments of silence <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170616122257/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/12/photos_santacon_2015_kicks_off_with.php#photo-1">for oppressed people all over the world</a>, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170616122257/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/12/its_time_for_santacon_to_stop.php">backlash</a>, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170616122257/http://gothamist.com/2014/11/20/santacon_backlash_hot_take.php">backlash to the backlash</a>, the backlash to the backlash <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170616122257/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/08/santacon_interview.php">to the backlash</a>, and most of all, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170616122257/http://gothamist.com/2013/12/15/photos_the_faces_of_santacon_2013.php#photo-1">ALL OF</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170616122257/http://gothamist.com/2014/12/14/photos_videos_the_faces_of_santacon.php#photo-1">THE</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170616122257/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/13/photos_videos_the_faces_of_santacon_1.php#photo-1">BINGE DRINKING.</a></p>

<p>But to be fair, SantaCon organizers have made a concerted effort <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170616122257/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/08/santacon_interview.php">to improve the event&apos;s reputation</a> in recent years. And without it, we never would have gotten <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170616122257/http://gothamist.com/2014/12/15/santacon_embedded_report.php#photo-1">Lauren Evans</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170616122257/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/14/dude_man_bro_satancon.php#photo-1">Rebecca Fishbein</a> to willingly wear Santa outfits. And we never would have been treated to this beautiful video:</p>
