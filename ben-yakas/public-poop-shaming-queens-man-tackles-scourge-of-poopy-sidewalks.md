<p>Poopy sidewalks are an irritating but all too common reality of NYC&#x2014;we&apos;ve previously spent some time <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604104841/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/24/interactive_map_what_neighborhoods.php">poring over 311 complaints to find out</a> where neighborhoods aren&apos;t just stepping in the proverbial AND literal poop anymore. Well, one Queens resident has taken it upon himself to actively try to snuff out the scourge by publicly bringing attention to, and shaming, people who leave poop. </p>

<p>&quot;In Queens, a lot of people don&#x2019;t clean up their dogs&apos; poop, so I started this project to encourage people to clean up after their dogs,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604104841/http://www.jangalious.com/">Jang Cho</a>, an art director at an advertising agency in Manhattan, told us. &quot;I&apos;ve posted over 100 Found Flyer and stenciled Toilet Sign using temporary spray chalk around various dog poop in the Astoria area.&quot; In case you&apos;re not <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604104841/http://www.nyc.gov/html/doh/downloads/pdf/zoo/zoo-animal-healthcode.pdf">familiar with the law</a>, not cleaning up after your pet is an &quot;offense punishable by a fine of $25 or ten days imprisonment, or both.&quot;</p>

<p>You can browse <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604104841/http://dogpoopproject.tumblr.com/">through the entire project here</a>, including lots of photos and a few select email and voicemail responses Cho has gotten from his neighbors. That includes a 12-year-old who thinks the project is &quot;awesome,&quot; the person who calls him &quot;you fu*king disgusting bastards,&quot; and the fan who simply notes, &quot;Thanks bro.&quot;</p>
