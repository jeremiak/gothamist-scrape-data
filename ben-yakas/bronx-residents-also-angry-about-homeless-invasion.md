<p>Residents in the Highbridge neighborhood of the Bronx <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150923205728/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/bronx/2011/01/06/2011-01-06_surprise_city_opens_mens_shelter__without_nabes_ok.html">are angry</a> after officials unilaterally converted a shelter for homeless families into a facility housing only men. Similar to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150923205728/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/05/uws_residents_fight_against_inevita.php">concerns from</a> UWS residents yesterday, Highbridge locals say that the new influx of homeless people are making their neighborhood much more dangerous. &quot;<strong>They&apos;re out here at all hours of the night, creeping around and you don&apos;t know what they&apos;re going to do. They&apos;re always either smoking, drinking or looking in someone&apos;s window</strong>,&quot;  said Rhodesia Jones. But what if there&apos;s a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150923205728/http://gothamist.com/tags/tedwilliams">Ted Williams</a> lurking amongst that crowd?</p>

<p>The Department of Homeless Services says the facility is perfectly safe, staffed with DHS officers and security guards, and down the block from the NYPD&apos;s Bronx Task Force headquarters. &quot;There&apos;s been a decrease in the number of families in the system and we have a greater need for a single adult shelter,&quot; said Barbara Brancaccio, deputy DHS commissioner. But residents seem more angry that they weren&apos;t consulted about the change, arguing that the neighborhood already has eight other homeless shelters. &quot;Yes, we want to look out for these people, but how can a community move forward when you&apos;re constantly pushing us back with these type of facilities. We&apos;re livid,&quot; said Jos&#xE9; Rodriguez, district manager for Community Board 4. </p>

<p>In brighter news, the New York City Council <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150923205728/http://www.advocate.com/News/Daily_News/2011/01/06/NYC_Restores_Funds_for_Homeless_LGBTQ_Youths/">announced</a> that they had come to an agreement with Mayor Bloomberg to restore $35 million in proposed budget cuts that would have halved the funding for street outreach and drop-in centers for runaway and homeless LGBTQ youths. </p>
