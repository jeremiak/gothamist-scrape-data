<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504203634/http://gothamist.com/2008/09/27/state_wants_to_build_a_new_tappan_z.php">Two years ago</a>, the state announced plans to forgo repairing the Tappan Zee Bridge, and instead build a new bridge entirely. Yesterday, the Tappan Zee Bridge/Interstate 287 Corridor Project <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504203634/http://www.lohud.com/article/201010160342">unveiled the final two possible redesigns</a>. Plan 3 is a single-level span that would have room for trains to run in the middle, bus lanes on either side of the tracks, and car and trucks traveling in the outer lanes. Plan 5 is a dual-level bridge, and would take less time to construct. Trains would run underneath the north span, vehicle traffic would be on the top level, with two dedicated bus lanes in the center. Of course, they may not have the money currently to build either of them.</p>

<p>&#x201C;It is unrealistic to think we can get 100 percent federal funding for this project,&#x201D; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504203634/http://www.nyacknewsandviews.com/2010/10/tzb_rclegislature20101015/comment-page-1/">said project director</a> Michael Anderson, referring to the original $16 billion estimate for the project. In addition to the funding challenges, there was the serious issue of congestion; he believes that the eight planned lanes won&#x2019;t have enough capacity to support all of the cars, trucks and buses that want to cross the Hudson, and even with more lanes, traffic will be constrained by the roadways that feed the bridge. Anderson hopes to use half the project budget to expand intra-county, inter-county and NYC-bound transit options.</p>
