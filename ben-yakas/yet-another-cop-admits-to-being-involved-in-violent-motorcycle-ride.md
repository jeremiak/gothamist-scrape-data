<p>Yet another NYPD officer came forward this week to admit to being involved in the motorcycle ride that led to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150103064625/http://gothamist.com/tags/motorcyclerallyroadrage">a group of motorcyclists chasing and beating a terrified SUV driver</a> last month. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150103064625/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20131011/washington-heights/fourth-nypd-officer-comes-forward-motorcycle-road-rage-scandal">According to DNAInfo</a>, the unidentified officer currently works on patrol in the department&#x2019;s Housing Bureau, after having recently been transferred following a stint in the NYPD&#x2019;s Narcotics Division. He only came forward on Friday, nearly <em>two weeks</em> after  SUV driver Alexian Lien was beaten by motorcyclists on the West Side Highway.</p>

<p>This is the fourth police officer who has come forward or been identified as taking part in the motorcycle ride, which occurred on September 29th. Earlier this week, 28-year-old Internal Affairs Bureau officer Matthew Rodriguez <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150103064625/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/10/internal_affairs_cop_involved_in_mo.php">also came forward</a> and admitted he was riding with the group; no charges have been filed against Rodriguez, but the investigation is ongoing.  </p>

<p>Detective Wojciech Braszczok, a former Occupy Wall Street undercover officer, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150103064625/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/09/undercover_biker_cop_charged_with_g.php#photo-1">was charged this week</a> with riot and criminal mischief for his role in the incident. Off-duty NYPD detective Samir Gonsalves has also been charged. Altogether, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150103064625/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/11/seventh_motorcyclist_charged_for_in.php">seven motorcyclists have been charged</a> so far for the incident.</p>
