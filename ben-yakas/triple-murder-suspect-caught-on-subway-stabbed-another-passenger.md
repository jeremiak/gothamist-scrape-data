<p>Police have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150521223857/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2011/02/12/2011-02-12_cops_continue_hunt_for_brooklyn_sicko_who_left_4_dead_2_injured_in_stabbing_carj.html">caught and arrested</a> the 23-year-old man who is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150521223857/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/11/man_still_at_large_after_murderous.php">suspected</a> of killing at least four people in a mad rampage yesterday. Police caught Maksim Gelman at the Times Square station early this morning, but not before he stabbed one more man <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150521223857/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/13/nyregion/13stab.html?_r=1&amp;hp">on the 3 train</a> near the 96th St. and Broadway station. </p>

<p>Police believe Gelman&apos;s murderous stabbing spree began early yesterday morning when he stabbed his stepfather,  54-year-old Aleksandr Kuznetsov, in Sheepshead Bay; later in the day, he fatally stabbed his ex-girlfriend, Yelena Bluchenko, 20, and her mother, Anna, 56. After killing the two women, he allegedly attacked a passing motorist, stabbing 60-year-old Art DiCrescento in order to steal his car.  While driving DiCrescento&apos;s Pontiac Bonneville, Gelman struck a 62-year-old man who later died in the hospital.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150521223857/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2011/02/12/police-arrest-stabbing-suspect-in-subway-tunnel/">1010Wins</a>, police say that this morning&apos;s victim was slashed in the throat with a folding knife around 9 a.m. The 40-year-old victim was transported to a hospital where he is in critical condition. NYPD spokesmen Paul Browne <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150521223857/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/12/suspect-in-brooklyn-killings-captured-after-subway-stabbing/">says that</a> Gelman boarded a northbound No. 3 train &#x201C;from the tracks.&#x201D; Police also say they received multiple tips from people who recognized the suspect on the subway between 34th and 42nd streets.</p>

<p>A reader tells us, &quot;The train (Express) stopped at 42nd street, but only platformed the 1st car, where the incident took place. Everyone else is stranded in the last 9 cars. Saw EMS cart some person up the stairs bleeding heavily &amp; SWAT was on the scene. Looks like a stabbing to me.&quot; According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150521223857/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/brooklyn_man_who_went_on_killing_kAAlEX8zo0xjkSXQZM4THL#ixzz1Dl5VZGff">the Post</a>, Gelman was heard by witnesses on the 2 train banging on the motorman&#x2019;s door, yelling: &quot;My girlfriend ruined my life.&quot;</p>
