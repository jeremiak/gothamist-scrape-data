<p>Last week on <em>Game Of Thrones</em>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428172109/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/06/game_of_thrones_power_rankings_the.php">we had a</a> treacherous climb up The Wall, marriage negotiations, and a look inside Arya&apos;s eyes. This week, we got a display of dragons, some romance near The Wall, and a BEAR fight. Since the show is all about how people jockey for power, we&apos;ve decided to follow along this season with our <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428172109/http://gothamist.com/tags/gameofthronespowerrankings">Game of Thrones Power Rankings</a>&#x2014;aka, who is owning this week.</p>

<p><strong>Game Of Thrones Power Rankings, Week 6:</strong></p>

<p><strong>1. Tywin Lannister</strong>: Completely and utterly owned Joffrey this week while being as respectful as possible.</p>

<p><strong>2. Daenerys Targaryen</strong>: The Mother Of Dragons really hates slavery. She picked up a lot of gold, intimidated a negotiator, and offered some Mother&apos;s Day wisdom.</p>

<p><strong>2a. Dragons</strong>: Aww, dragons love head scratches.</p>

<p><strong>3. Robb Stark</strong>: Pretty good week for him: he&apos;s going to be a father to a little prince or princess, and he just had sexy sex. But he&apos;s being a little dismissive of Walder Frey, who is less likable than a &quot;wet shit.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>4. Joffrey Baratheon</strong>: If he wasn&apos;t who he is, he&apos;d be dropped to the bottom of the rankings after getting completely owned by his grandfather. But he is still king, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428172109/https://twitter.com/mikeryan/status/333753809820082176">old sport.</a></p>

<p><strong>5. Margarey Tyrell</strong>: Fully realizes how innocent Sansa is&#x2014;and legitimately seems to have sympathy for her, letting her think her mother taught her about sex. </p>

<p><strong>6. Jon Snow</strong>: It feels like everyone&apos;s giving or receiving some sort of sex advice this week. But this is another lovely episode for him and Ygritte.</p>

<p><strong>7. Ygritte</strong>: Received romantic overtures from Gareth Keenan and Mr. Know Nothing. Amazed by windmills. </p>

<p><strong>8. Melisandre</strong>: Teaches Gendry about the birds and the bees and royalty. </p>

<p><strong>9. Sansa Stark</strong>: Is told that a lot of experience can be a good thing, but has no concept of what that means.</p>

<p><strong>10. Tyrion Lannister</strong>: Well, he is far from the worst Lannister! </p>

<p><strong>11. Serr Bronn</strong>: &quot;I don&apos;t pay you to put evil notions in my head.&quot; &quot;You pay me to kill people who bother you. Evil notions come free.&quot; Good to have you back. </p>

<p><strong>12. Jaime Lannister</strong>: Not only did he go back for Brienne&#x2014;he got to leave Harrenhal on his terms (with a quip). This is some Tumblr-worthy shit. </p>

<p><strong>13. Brienne of Tarth</strong>: Technically, the maiden beat the bear. </p>

<p><strong>14. Osha</strong>: Her backstory could have been taken from <em>The Walking Dead</em>.</p>

<p><strong>15. Arya Stark</strong>: Runs away from The Brotherhood and right into The Hound. Even Death can&apos;t help her (for now).</p>

<p><strong>The Viserys Targeryen Memorial Least Powerful Person Of The Week Award</strong>: <em>Theon Greyjoy</em>: Undermines sexposition. Undergoes some alterations. </p>

<p><strong>Rickon Watch 2013: Did Rickon Do Anything?</strong> Nope. </p>

<p><strong>Hodor&apos;s Wisdom Of The Week</strong>: &quot;Hodor.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Not Applicable</strong>: No sign of Cersei, Oleanna Redwyne, Littlefinger, Varys, Samwell Tarly, Stannis Barratheon and the Dragonstone folks, or Mance Rayder. Until next week, here&apos;s the <em>Game Of Thrones</em> theme song as sung by a kitty.</p>
