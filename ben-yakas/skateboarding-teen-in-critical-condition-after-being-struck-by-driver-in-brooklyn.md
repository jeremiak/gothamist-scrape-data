<p>In a separate incident early Sunday, a 27-year-old pedestrian was struck by a livery cab driver on Steinway Street between 31st Street and Broadway in Astoria. Police say he was rushed to Elmhurst Hospital also in critical condition. &quot;I&#x2019;m all shook up. I&#x2019;m sorry about what happened,&quot; the driver, who didn&#x2019;t give his name, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140327043052/http://nypost.com/2014/03/23/pedestrian-hit-by-vehicle-in-queens/">told The Post</a>. &quot;It was so fast, I didn&#x2019;t know what happened.&quot; No charges have been filed, and the investigation is ongoing.</p>
