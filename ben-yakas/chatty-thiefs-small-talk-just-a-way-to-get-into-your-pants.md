But one serial Manhattan mugger has figured out a pretty smart way to rip off his victims: charm them with some light conversation first.<p></p>

<p>Police <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110428192747/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local/new_york&amp;id=8055947">are searching</a> for a serial mugger who they believe has committed at least seven robberies since mid-February. They also believe the suspect is a teenager who targets only male victims, before and after he goes to school. The suspect&apos;s MO: he follows his victims onto the platform or onto the street, starts a conversation with them so they let their guard down, then flashes a gun or knife and robs them of iPods and cell phones. The most recent incident occurred in SoHo last week; there have been other incidents around the LES and UWS. </p>

<p>&quot;It&apos;s scary that somebody&apos;s mugging people at nine o&apos;clock in the morning. I mean it&apos;s really crowded, so you feel so safe, but lately is seems like people are getting struck at two, three in the afternoon with lots of people around,&quot; one subway rider <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110428192747/http://www.ny1.com/content/top_stories/136901/police-seek-man-in-string-of-manhattan-muggings">told NY1</a>. This is why we have two strict subway policies: no small talk with strangers, and do not, under any circumstances, engage <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110428192747/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/02/danger_punk_teens_attacking_bystand.php">with teenagers.</a></p>
