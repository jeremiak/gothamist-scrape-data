<p>An argument over a person hoverboarding inside a Kosher Jewish supermarket led to an alleged assault-by-peach and at least three arrests last week. </p>

<p>Police say that the incident unfolded around 9:30 p.m. on Thursday, June 9th at Central Market on Division Avenue near Wythe Avenue. A 24-year-old woman came into the store on a hoverboard; she got into an argument with the store managers, 21-year-old Abraham Spielman an 29-year-old Mattis Edelstein, who said she was knocking things off shelves and refused to get off the hoverboard.</p>

<p>&quot;The manager&apos;s [<em>sic</em>] politely asked a girl to stop riding around the Supermarket with her Hoverboard and leave the store because she knocked down cereal boxes and other products and left the store in a mess,&quot; wrote Gary Schlesinger, who witnessed the incident and took the video above. &quot;The girl called her father who arrived minutes later and assaulted and bloodied the Manager&apos;s [<em>sic</em>] and yelled hateful derogatory words against the shocked staff (watch Clip).&quot;</p>

<p>Police said, however, that Edelstein and Spielman assaulted the hoverboard-rider: Spielman is accused of tackling her and throwing her to the ground, causing swelling to her right shoulder, while Edelstein allegedly threw a peach at her, striking her under the right eye, causing a small laceration and swelling.</p>

<p>When the woman&apos;s father, 41-year-old Mark Soto, arrived, he allegedly punched one of the managers in the face. All three men were arrested and charged with assault. Spielman was issued a desk appearance ticket for misdemeanor assault; Edelstein was charged with assault and menacing; and Soto was charged with misdemeanor assault.</p>

<p>No one from the supermarket would comment on the incident when reached this morning. </p>

<p>For his part, Schlesinger, who took the video, claims there was no peach-throwing incident: </p>

<blockquote>When the NYPD cops from the 90pct arrived they clearly saw the manager&apos;s nose bleeding and hands bloodied but they arrested both managers because the violent person falsely accused the managers of throwing a PEACH on his girl! As a result of this false PEACH arrest one the Manager&apos;s was in central booking for over 24 hours barely making it home before the onset of a 3 day holiday &#x202A;#&#x200E;Shavuot&#x202C; with his large extended family.

<p>I will let you decide who was right and wrong here, obviously the NYPD messed up here big time!!!</p></blockquote><p></p>
