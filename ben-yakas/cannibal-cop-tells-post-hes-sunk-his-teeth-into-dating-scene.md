<p>It&apos;s been almost a year since a federal appeals court <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022144538/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/03/cannibal_cop_redux.php">upheld the decision</a> to drop charges against Gilberto Valle, better known as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022144538/http://gothamist.com/tags/cannibalcop">&quot;Cannibal Cop,&quot;</a> the former NYPD officer who was accused of conspiring to kill and potentially cook several women. Despite their proclivity for plastering <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022144538/https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.imediaethics.org%2Fckfinder%2Fuserfiles%2Fimages%2Fcannibal-cop-for-gif.gif&amp;imgrefurl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.imediaethics.org%2Fnypost-photoshops-front-page-photo-of-cannibal-cop-gilberto-valle-discloses-in-tiny-print%2F&amp;docid=1PRWrJILA78S7M&amp;tbnid=9lcB9fg0ogmsnM%3A&amp;w=630&amp;h=682&amp;bih=671&amp;biw=1279&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiRiZGxvZnPAhWM14MKHTFDCOQQMwgeKAAwAA&amp;iact=mrc&amp;uact=8">his face</a> on their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022144538/https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/nypost_20150121_3_001_c_3_104703759.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;strip=all">front cover</a> with a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022144538/https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.newsapi.com.au%2Fimage%2Fv1%2F73e25c47b94dc52c71ce58a01e5f14a2&amp;imgrefurl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.news.com.au%2Fworld%2Fnorth-america%2Fcannibal-cop-gilberto-valle-breaks-his-silence-on-plan-to-cook-and-eat-women%2Fnews-story%2F45bcac37fc6c59d09f452204cd18dc0b&amp;docid=J3g7jrOyMNuenM&amp;tbnid=MCrzJNrjmTyB0M%3A&amp;w=316&amp;h=421&amp;bih=671&amp;biw=1279&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiRiZGxvZnPAhWM14MKHTFDCOQQMwggKAIwAg&amp;iact=mrc&amp;uact=8">terrible/transcendent pun</a>, Valle sat down for a hearty garden omelette <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022144538/http://nypost.com/2016/09/18/cannibal-cop-says-hes-a-hot-dish-on-dating-scene/">with the Post</a> this weekend to give them an update on his love life.</p>

<p>Valle apparently bragged to the tabloid that he has had around 50 women interested in him since he was first arrested in 2012: &quot;They would say things like, &#x2018;I&#x2019;m really happy you prevailed&#x2019; and &#x2018;Hope you&#x2019;re doing well,&apos;&quot; Valle said of the women, many of whom contacted him through social media. &quot;Many reached out because they are interested in my case. I started chatting more with a few of them and eventually asked some on dates.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Everything is already out there for people to see, so I have no problem answering questions honestly,&quot; the 32-year-old, who lives with his mother in Queens, added. &quot;I like meeting women who already know everything about me, so I don&#x2019;t have to suddenly drop this bomb on them.&quot;</p>

<p>Valle <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022144538/http://gothamist.com/2015/01/21/cannibal_cop_single.php">previously joined</a> Match.com in 2015 using the handle &quot;AmicableOne14&quot; (which was way too close to being an anagram for &quot;cannibal&quot;) after serving 21 months in jail. He was kicked off the site <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022144538/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2921672/Match-com-deletes-dating-profile-cannibal-cop-listed-cooking-hobby.html">soon after that.</a> He was was on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022144538/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/25/photos_cannibal_cop_called_himself.php#photo-1">OKCupid as well</a> before that, noting his favorite foods are &quot;Italian, Mexican, Chinese, Japanese.... I&apos;ll try anything and am not picky at all.&quot;</p>

<p>The best part of the Post&apos;s report today is their incredibly specific extended riff on Valle&apos;s dining choices during one particularly memorable date with &quot;a young catch&quot; he met from out-of-town. You&apos;ll never want to use the phrase &quot;buttered up&quot; again.</p>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">My favorite thing about this catchup with &quot;Cannibal Cop&quot; is the specific food references <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022144538/https://t.co/yuz7GrhNWR">https://t.co/yuz7GrhNWR</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022144538/https://t.co/rkkDkM0liI">pic.twitter.com/rkkDkM0liI</a></p>&#x2014; Ben Yakas (@yenbakas) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022144538/https://twitter.com/yenbakas/status/777557153552928768">September 18, 2016</a></blockquote>

<p>Valle also revealed he is hard at work on his memoir (or as the trolls at the Post put it, he&apos;s &quot;marinating on the content of a &apos;brutal tell-all&apos;&quot;), explaining how watching bondage porn as a teen led him to cannibal websites: &quot;People don&#x2019;t have to like what I am into sexually, but the issue here is that an innocent person was thrown in prison for his thoughts,&quot; he said. &quot;I don&#x2019;t feel ashamed. So what if I have these fetishes? I would never actually act anything out in real life.&quot;<br>
