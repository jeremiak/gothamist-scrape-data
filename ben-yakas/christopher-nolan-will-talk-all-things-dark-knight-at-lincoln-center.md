<p>It&apos;s been a few months since <em>The Dark Knight Rises</em> swooped into theaters, finishing the latest Batman trilogy with an epic tale all about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161300/http://gothamist.com/tags/batman">the dark underbelly of street closings.</a> Now, the auteur behind the trilogy&#x2014;<em>Batman Begins</em>, <em>The Dark Knight</em> and <em>The Dark Knight Rises</em>&#x2014;is ready to go into detail about the creation of the films&#x2014;and he&apos;ll be doing so right here in Manhattan!</p>

<p>The Film Society of Lincoln Center and Film Comment Selects <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161300/http://www.filmlinc.com/films/on-sale/film-comment-selects-an-evening-with-christopher-nolan1">will sit down with Christopher Nolan</a> on Wednesday November 28th at 7 p.m. at the Walter Reader Theater on the Upper West Side. The evening will focus on the making of the trilogy, as well as  the many other facets and films of his remarkable career, including <em>Insomnia</em>, <em>Inception</em> and <em>The Prestige</em>. </p>

<p>Tickets just went on sale, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161300/http://www.filmlinc.com/films/on-sale/film-comment-selects-an-evening-with-christopher-nolan1">so you better hurry to get some here.</a> After all, this may be your only chance to ask him why he&apos;s let Zach Snyder take the director&apos;s chair for the next Superman movie, <em>Man Of Steel</em> (which Nolan is producing and helped write).</p>
