<p>Five days after NYPD officers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160228172459/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/15/nypd_evicts_occupy_wall_street_clea.php#photo-1">cleared out Zuccotti Park</a> and disposed of the makeshift tent city that had sprung up, a few hundred <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160228172459/http://gothamist.com/tags/occupywallstreet">Occupy Wall Street</a> protesters returned there yesterday for a busy day filled with a gay wedding, more drumming, and a march to Wall Street. You can see video of that march below (taken <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160228172459/http://www.youtube.com/user/JoeysNewYork">by Joey Boots</a>), which included some subdued confrontations with police.</p>

<p>It wasn&apos;t all marching and chanting though: yesterday afternoon, activists Jonathan Lopez, 19, and Ivan Cabrera, 18, exchanged rings and ate cake at their wedding ceremony&#x2014;it was the first <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160228172459/http://gaytoday.com/index.php/2011/11/18/occupy-protestors-want-gay-marriage/">gay marriage</a> at Zuccotti Park. Cabrera <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160228172459/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/beat-protesters-drums-return-zuccotti-park-days-eviction-article-1.980320">told the Daily News</a> he was still angry that OWS had been kicked out of the park. &#x201C;They say we have freedom of speech, but we don&#x2019;t. We&#x2019;re nonviolent, and we got kicked out and hit. We&#x2019;re trying to make this cause for the whole world,&quot; he said.</p>

<p>While workers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160228172459/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/rabble_returns_to_zuccotti_to_drum_uuCHZD4WWL8RIeESUWczDM?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">hung holiday lights onto the trees</a> in the park in the morning, police and Brookfield Properties security kept protesters from erecting tents or bringing in comforters. Sonya Zink told the News she even got into a tussle with a cop while trying to bring a blanket into the park. But there was one thing officers couldn&apos;t stop them from doing: drumming. &#x201C;There are no signs outside the park saying no drums! This is freedom of expression!&#x201D; one drummer yelled at NYPD Community Affairs officers as he started a drum circle with two others.</p>

<p>Protesters will bring those drums to Bloomberg&apos;s mansion on East 79th Street this afternoon <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160228172459/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/20/occupy_wall_streets_24-hour_drum_ci.php">for a 24-hour protest</a> that is bound to infuriate Hizzoner (if he&apos;s there). Someone else who has been upset by everything going on? Zuccotti Park&apos;s namesake, John Zuccotti, the 74-year-old co-chair of Brookfield Properties. Former Mayor Ed Koch <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160228172459/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/john-zuccotti-worries-occupy-wall-st-protest-legacy-months-rallying-namesake-park-article-1.980245">told the News that Zuccotti is worried</a> his legacy is forever intertwined, if not over-shadowed, by the protest now: </p>

<p>&#x201C;He was very worried about it. He said, &apos;Everybody knows my name, Zuccotti, not because of what I&#x2019;ve done as an individual, but because of the park.&#x2019; It&#x2019;s been a difficult time for him,&quot; Koch said</p>
