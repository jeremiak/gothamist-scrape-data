<p>A 22-year-old Manhattan woman is suing her 73-year-old former boss who she claims sexually harassed her for five months while in his employment. Amanda Gonzalez <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604150852/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/woman-sues-73-year-old-boss-grabbing-crotch-article-1.1303219">claims that the harassment culminated</a> in Garment District businessman Richard Simon kissing her hips and breasts and grabbing her crotch through her pants while leering, &#x201C;I can&#x2019;t wait to eat it.&#x201D; And when she told Simon&apos;s business partner about the ongoing harassment, he allegedly told her not to worry because &#x201C;his penis doesn&#x2019;t work.&#x201D; </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604150852/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/gal_boss_horndog_GQJZdVboUkImkjaUgelchJ?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Manhattan">Gonzalez called cops</a> after that crotch-grabbing incident, which occurred in March 2012; Simon pleaded guilty in 2012 to one count of misdemeanor sexual abuse, but wasn&apos;t given any jail time or forced to register as a sex offender. But in her lawsuit, Gonzalez claims there was plenty of other harassment going on: when she interviewed for the job, she says Simon asked her whether she had a boyfriend and how she felt about abortions. </p>

<p>He constantly made comments about her body, calling it &#x201C;voluptuous&#x201D; and &#x201C;chesty,&#x201D; and telling her she had a &#x201C;big butt.&#x201D; And he allegedly made her model new clothes for him, and told her she needed to do &quot;whatever it takes&quot; to get a promotion. Gonzalez&apos; attorney, Rosemarie Arnold, says her client is &quot;paranoid about every thing. She&apos;s afraid to get a new job, to walk down the street, for fear someone will grab her.&quot; Gonzalez added to the News: &#x201C;I want to warn all the women of New York about this dangerous, old man so he doesn&#x2019;t hurt anyone else.&#x201D;</p>
