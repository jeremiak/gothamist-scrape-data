<p>When <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161510/http://gothamist.com/tags/chuckschumer">Senator Chuck Schumer&apos;s</a> not busy sipping on Coronas with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161510/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/16/photo_chuck_schumer_drinks_beer_wit.php">well-coiffed constituents at Williamsburg picnic tables</a> or eagerly jumpstarting <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161510/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/03/schumer_in_iowa_run_hillary_run.php">Hillary 2016</a>, he&apos;s probably down in D.C. hanging out with his &quot;frat&quot; brothers. That&apos;s because Schumer and several other pols all live in a &quot;rundown frat house&quot; when they&apos;re down there, eating cereal together, sharing bathrooms, and skimping on groceries. Below, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161510/http://www.cnn.com/2013/12/04/politics/real-alpha-house/index.html?sr=sharebar_twitter">CNN gives you a peak</a> inside the glittering world of political slovenliness. </p>
