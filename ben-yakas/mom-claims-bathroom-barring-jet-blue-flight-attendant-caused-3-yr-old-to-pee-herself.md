<p>A Massachusetts mom claims that a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504231706/http://gothamist.com/tags/jetblue">JetBlue</a> flight attendant caused her three-year-old daughter to urinate on herself after she refused to let them use the bathroom. &quot;<strong>It wasn&apos;t about bad customer service at that point, it was about bad human decency</strong>,&quot; mom Jennifer Deveraux <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504231706/http://boston.cbslocal.com/2014/06/13/mom-flight-attendant-refused-bathroom-access-3-year-old-forced-to-urinate-in-seat/">told CBS Boston</a>. &quot;My daughter was sitting in a pool of urine and I couldn&apos;t do anything about it. And as a mom it just broke my heart.&quot;</p>

<p>Deveraux was traveling with her two daughters from NYC to Boston last Monday when their flight was delayed and they got stuck on the tarmac for thirty minutes. Her three-year-old, Summers, started crying and said she had to go to the bathroom; the flight attendant yelled at Deveraux when she tried to take her. Summers ended up urinating in her seat, and Deveraux pleaded to let her go clean it up: &quot;And I said, &apos;please give me a break. My daughter had an accident because you wouldn&#x2019;t let me take her to the bathroom. After I clean it up I will sit down.&apos; She turned around and reported it to the pilot,&#x201D; Deveraux said.</p>

<p>The pilot announced to the flight that a &quot;non-compliant&quot; passenger was forcing them to turn around, but an off-duty pilot who was sitting two seats in front of Deveraux convinced the crew to let them stay. Deveraux has now filed a complaint against JetBlue: &quot;I want an apology and I don&#x2019;t want them to do this to any other family. I want this behavior to be stopped,&quot; she said.</p>

<p>JetBlue has said they&apos;re investigating the incident, and also responded to at least one tweet about it, because that&apos;s just how customer service works in 2014: </p>
