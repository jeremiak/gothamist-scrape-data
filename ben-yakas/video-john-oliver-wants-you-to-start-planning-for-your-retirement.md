<p>Last week, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021151846/http://gothamist.com/tags/johnoliver"><em>Last Week Tonight</em></a> tackled the nasty world of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021151846/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/06/video_john_oliver_tackles_the_harmf.php">debt collection, zombie debt, and debt buying.</a> This week, &quot;Last Week&quot; took on a very different personal finance minefield: elf spotting. Oh, and the complexities of planning your retirement. </p>

<p>Watch below as Oliver dives into the complexities of financial service companies, 401Ks, compounding fees, and the enigma that is Suze Orman. He also enlists Billy Eichner and Kristen Chenoweth at the end to highlight a few key points on the subject to remember, if you want to avoid being an idiot who makes shitty choices about what to do with your money.</p>

<p>Before Oliver got into all that, he started the episode with a few words on the mass shooting which occurred in Orlando this weekend. &quot;In Orlando earlier this morning, a gunman attacked a Latin night at a gay club in the theme park capital of the world,&quot; Oliver said. &quot;And for the record, I will happily embrace a Latin night at a gay club at the theme park capital of the world as the ultimate symbol about what is truly wonderful about America.&quot;</p>

<p>Oliver then <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021151846/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKgDFuSGxEE">played a clip</a> showing hundreds of people lined up to donate blood to victims Sunday. &quot;And it kind of reminds you that that terrorist dipshit is vastly outnumbered.&quot; You can watch it below (while it&apos;s still up), or check out the transcript at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021151846/http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/06/13/john-oliver-s-tribute-to-orlando-that-terrorist-dipshit-is-vastly-outnumbered.html">Daily Beast.</a></p>
