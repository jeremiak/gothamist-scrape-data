<p>While some people were having fun <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150103062957/http://nypost.com/2014/01/04/oklahoma-couple-have-white-wedding-during-nyc-blizzard/">getting hitched</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150103062957/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/03/best_blizzard_photo_area_man_relaxe.php">hanging in the hot tub</a> after the winter storm hit the city this week, at least one mailman was dealing with the soggiest of situations. A postal truck <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150103062957/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2014/01/03/postal-worker-rescued-from-ice-water-during-high-tide-near-shrewsbury-river/">got stuck in</a> four feet of ice water in Monmouth Beach, NJ yesterday. </p>

<p>&quot;I saw him and I started screaming for him to stop and he just plowed into the river,&quot; neighbor Carrie Tenuto, who was shoveling her walkway at the time, told CBS. It seems multiple people got stuck on this particular road, which is located near the Shrewsbury River. &quot;It floods here very easily and if we get a nor&apos;easter we get slammed here,&quot; resident Frank Dicopoulos added. Hey, it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150103062957/http://gothamist.com/2010/12/27/what_is_worse_than_getting_your_car.php">could have been worse.</a></p>
