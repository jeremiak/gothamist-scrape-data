<p>As we <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140711170403/http://gothamist.com/2014/07/04/where_to_find_the_best_illegal_fire.php">learned earlier today</a>, Inwood is the most popular neighborhood in NYC for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140711170403/http://gothamist.com/tags/illegalfireworks">illegal fireworks</a> (as per 311 complaints). It&apos;s not that surprising, considering that locals have gathered around Dyckman Street for the last 25 years for an unsanctioned fireworks competition/bonanza. Learn all about the hallowed tradition via the short documentary below, &quot;The Incredibly Spectacular Dyckman Fireworks Co.,&quot; which was filmed last year on July 4th in the neighborhood.</p>

<p>As you can see in the doc, filmed by Jonathan Ullman, people bring batches of fireworks, set them off, then scurry as cops arrive. Once they disperse, another group sets off their fireworks, leading to &quot;a cat-and-mouse game&quot; as one person puts it. Cops <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140711170403/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/04/nyregion/manhattans-illegal-fireworks-a-july-4-tradition-american-independence-day.html?ref=nyregion&amp;_r=0">tell the Times</a> they&apos;ll be extra vigilant though: &quot;We&#x2019;ve rescheduled people who are going to work the night, we&#x2019;re bringing in people on overtime and we&#x2019;re bringing people from other precincts,&quot; Deputy Inspector Chris Morello, of the 34th Precinct, said. &quot;If they see fireworks, they&#x2019;re going to make the seizure, they&#x2019;re going to make the arrests.&quot;</p>

<p>That would deter locals though: &quot;We&#x2019;re not really celebrating Independence Day,&#x201D; said Hugo Joel Collado. &quot;We&#x2019;re really celebrating our &#x2019;hood.&quot;</p>
