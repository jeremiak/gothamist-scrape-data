<p>If we&apos;ve learned anything from the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430034947/http://thesexysaxman.com/">Sexy Sax Man</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430034947/http://gothamist.com/tags/clarenceclemons">Clarence &quot;Big Man&quot; Clemons</a>, it&apos;s that saxophone players can occasionally be cool. And the video below of an epic sax-off on the subway certainly falls in the...well, they don&apos;t <em>look</em> cool, but it&apos;s not-uncool.

<p>We&apos;ve seen enough <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430034947/http://gothamist.com/tags/viralmarketing">&quot;viral&quot; videos</a> to have a healthy skepticism about this one&#x2014;maybe it was staged, but we&apos;d rather have a musical sax-off any day of the week than <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430034947/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/21/video_l_train_filled_with_sleeping.php">creepy sleeping people.</a> However, as pleasant as the sax-off is, whatever is going on at 1:22 does not seem okay. </p>
