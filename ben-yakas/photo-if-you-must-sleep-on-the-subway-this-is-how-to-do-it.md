<p>We spend so much time focusing on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509000326/http://gothamist.com/tags/subwayetiquette">brie eaters and beer mamas who frequent our beloved mass transit system</a>, we sometimes forget that heartwarming things happen on the subway too. Just take the two tuckered-out men above, whom <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509000326/https://twitter.com/FrancisChaos">a tipster</a> spotted on a half-full F train this morning around 7:40 in Park Slope: &quot;I [have] to say that they looked so peacefully adorable, and I think everyone else did too, even if they pretended not to care, that no one really faulted them for taking all those seats, on the morning rush-hour.&quot;  </p>

<p>And who could blame him for being touched by the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509000326/http://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=http://www.jildorshoes.com/images/products/BlowfishHobbitGreyFlannel_Front_300.jpg&amp;imgrefurl=http://www.stylehive.com/bookmark/blowfish-hobbit-grey-fabric-jildor-shoes-since-1949-449520&amp;h=250&amp;w=279&amp;sz=13&amp;tbnid=xk3ycLNiYQvnVM:&amp;tbnh=97&amp;tbnw=108&amp;zoom=1&amp;usg=__5KUXmptfczr_GajRl7bEVA85zjY=&amp;docid=UPBl8QjzN60LXM&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=v0NpUqHjNtL_4APgzYCQCg&amp;ved=0CEQQ9QEwAw">&quot;Hobbit shoes,&quot;</a> Heisenberg hat and intertwining limbs. &quot;Anyhow, seeing them put a smile on my face,&quot; our tipster said, adding that he was so moved by the display of affection, he &quot;stayed on the train all the way to the 50th-rock center stop, just to make sure no one bothered them.&quot; This certainly turned out much better than <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509000326/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/13/video_rat_in_subway_car_crawls_over.php">the last time we fell asleep on the train.</a></p>
