So we crunched the numbers, and it turns out he actually has <em>nine children</em>, by eight different women, in six states. It all sounds pretty, pretty messy, considering that none of 26-year-old Cromartie&apos;s kids are older than five. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160921112046/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/national/how_jets_big_daddy_goes_the_whole_GfZbp5YDG78i7laEsFtJIK?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">The Post says</a> mother No. 6 is &quot;a corporate lawyer and former Miss Black North Carolina&quot; and Cromartie&apos;s sister once claimed that mother No. 1 a &quot;pot-smoking prostitute.&quot;</p>

<p>No. 6, Rhonda Patterson, claims that Cromartie dumped her a week before they were supposed to get married, when she was six months pregnant: &quot;It&apos;s easy to get wrapped up in the lifestyle that came with being engaged to someone in the NFL -- first-class flights, shopping on Rodeo Drive, living in his Atlanta mansion. It made it easier to overlook the red flags.&quot;  Cromartie lives with his wife, aka mother No. 8, and apparently Skype helps him stay in touch with some of the other kids.</p>
