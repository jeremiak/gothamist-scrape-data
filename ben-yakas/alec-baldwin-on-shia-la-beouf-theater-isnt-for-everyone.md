<p>Yesterday, it was announced that Shia LaBeouf would not be making his Broadway debut in <em>Orphans</em> this spring due to &quot;creative differences&quot; over his role. Of course, &quot;creative differences&quot; seems like a boilerplate excuse, which has led everyone from the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427165032/http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/gossip/confidential/shia-exit-leaves-orphans-tough-stage-article-1.1269334">Daily News</a> to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427165032/http://www.nypost.com/p/pagesix/baldwin_shia_way_beef_sryapDDbiP62s0fzLSIXjM">NY Post</a> to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427165032/http://www.vulture.com/2013/02/labeouf-left-play-because-of-beef-with-baldwin.html">Vulture</a> to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427165032/http://www.buzzfeed.com/lyapalater/the-brief-but-mysterious-saga-of-shia-labeouf-dropping-out-o">Buzzfeed</a> to speculate on what <em>really </em>happened behind the scenes of the star-studded production. Today we spoke to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427165032/http://gothamist.com/tags/alecbaldwin">Alec Baldwin</a>, who will now be starring <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427165032/http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/02/21/ben-foster-will-replace-shia-labeouf-in-orphans/?smid=tw-share">opposite Ben Foster</a> in the play, about what he thinks happened: <strong>Theater &quot;isn&apos;t for everyone, and he wanted to move on,&quot;</strong> Baldwin told us.</p>

<p>Baldwin, who has been dealing all week <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427165032/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/19/alec_baldwin_5.php">with a NY Post photographer&apos;s allegation</a> that he used a racist epithet <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427165032/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/20/exclusive_alec_baldwin_witness.php">during a physical confrontation</a>, compared TV work to the Tour De France (&quot;a grueling long journey&quot;), movie work to jogging (&quot;gotta have a good pace, time is money&quot;), and theater to golf (&quot;slow everything way down, line up every shot&quot;). &quot;There are some people who can do all three of those things,&quot; he said. &quot;And then there are some people who can&apos;t.&quot;</p>

<p>But insiders told the News and Post that the problems ran deeper than that: one source <a href="www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/gossip/confidential/shia-exit-leaves-orphans-tough-stage-article-1.1269334">told the News</a> that LeBeouf has clashed with director Daniel Sullivan during the past week and a half of rehearsals (he smashed his hand through a door at one point, then apologized to Sullivan), and that he treated the role like he was an action star on a movie set. A source <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427165032/http://www.nypost.com/p/pagesix/baldwin_shia_way_beef_sryapDDbiP62s0fzLSIXjM">told the Post</a> a similar thing, noting LaBeouf &#x201C;was fired because he wasn&#x2019;t good in the role.&#x201D; When the News and Post can agree on something, you know things are really weird.</p>

<p>The whole situation escalated today after LaBeouf &lt;ahref=&quot;https://twitter.com/thecampaignbook&quot;&gt;took to Twitter and posted several emails between himself and various crew members that implied that friction between himself and Baldwin was what caused him to exit. Outlets such as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427165032/http://www.vulture.com/2013/02/labeouf-left-play-because-of-beef-with-baldwin.html">Vulture</a> ate that up, despite some of the inconsistencies, including the fact LaBeouf was the one apologizing in most of the correspondences (&quot;subject: Apology&quot;), and he ripped off an Esquire article in one email.</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="201302_lbemail2.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427165032im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/201302_lbemail2.jpg" width="640" height="422"> <br> <i> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427165032/https://twitter.com/thecampaignbook/status/304329020831592448">via Twitter</a></i></div> <p></p>

<p>As <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427165032/http://gawker.com/5985954/shia-labeouf-plagiarized-his-apology-to-alec-baldwin-from-esquires-how-to-be-a-man">Gawker pointed out</a>: &quot;It soon became apparent that LaBeouf&apos;s &quot;confessional&quot; tweets were less about being humble and more about humblebragging.&quot;</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="201302_lbemail1.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427165032im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/201302_lbemail1.jpg" width="640" height="496"> <br> <i> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427165032/https://twitter.com/thecampaignbook/status/304333854578204672/photo/1">via Twitter</a></i></div> <p></p>

<p>&quot;I found his posting private emails to be odd,&quot; Baldwin said of that. &quot;Everyone involved feels odd about that.&quot; But he was more conciliatory about LaBeouf and the nature of theater work: &quot;This doesn&apos;t happen often, but it does happen. People being replaced in the cast of these ventures happens because they&apos;re wrong for the part, or exhibiting signs they don&apos;t want to be there. Sometimes people take a job and then they realize, &apos;Oh god, what have I gotten myself into?&apos;&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I don&apos;t know what his thinking is, what went on there,&quot; he concluded. <strong>&quot;I just know at some point, everybody decided he wanted to go.&quot;</strong></p>
