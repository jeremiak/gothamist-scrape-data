<p>A couple who miss the good old bad days of the Lower East Side have spent the exorbitant price of $1 million <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429072511/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/lower_east_stuy_FwM5GQXQ9IEcIUF8rSmUiI">to move into an apartment in Bed-Stuy</a>. &#x201C;It reminds us of what the Lower East Side used to be like; that is why we bought there,&#x201D; said Mara Singer, who represents fashion and still-life photographers. If only the couple&apos;s friends could see the idealized neighborhood that they see, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429072511/http://www.theonion.com/articles/sometimes-i-feel-like-im-the-only-one-trying-to-ge,11249/">where that rundown old health clinic is turned into a tattoo parlor, and that Last Supper mural is replaced with one featuring Radiohead or a stylized corporate octopus.</a></p>

<p>These pioneers of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429072511/http://gothamist.com/tags/gentrification">gentrification</a>, Singer and photographer husband David, have bought a two-bedroom, two-bath penthouse duplex on Lexington Avenue, which includes a 600-square-foot private roof deck. According <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429072511/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/lower_east_stuy_FwM5GQXQ9IEcIUF8rSmUiI">to the Post</a>, this was a record-setting price for an apartment in the neighborhood, although Singer noted, &quot;it is still so much cheaper than Manhattan in so many ways.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;We have been living on and off [on] the Lower East Side for 25 years,&quot; Singer said. &quot;We do love it, but Soho House is coming, the neighborhood is changing and it is just different. We like the old Lower East Side.&quot; Yeah, things really haven&apos;t been the same down there ever since <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429072511/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/05/les_residents_say_adult_kickball_le.php">those kickball leagues invaded the neighborhood</a>, displacing all the heroin addicts and gangs.</p>

<p>&quot;We are loft people, but the new one is a more industrial, raw space,&quot; Singer said. &quot;It&#x2019;s not overdone, over-renovated and sanitized. It still has the old New York flavor, which doesn&#x2019;t happen anymore,&#x201D; she added, without any indication of self-awareness. </p>

<p>The only thing that could make this story any better is if the four-story condo building used to be, like, a frozen-food factory or something...which it was. &#x201C;It still has the magic,&#x201D; Singer said. &#x201C;They didn&#x2019;t get rid of the beauty. They left a lot of it, which is what is so amazing.&#x201D; As we always say, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429072511/https://twitter.com/jakedobkin/status/340548227067674624">nostalgia is death</a> unless it involves converted frozen-food factories.</p>
