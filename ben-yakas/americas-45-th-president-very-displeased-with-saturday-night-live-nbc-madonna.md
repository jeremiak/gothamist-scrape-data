<p>While being interviewed by Fox News Channel&#x2019;s Sean Hannity last night, Donald Trump took a break from promoting <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170130015842/http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/trump-is-all-in-on-an-infowars-approved-voter-fraud-theory.html">Infowars conspiracy theories</a> and engaging in a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170130015842/http://deadline.com/2017/01/donald-trump-sean-hannity-waterboarding-david-muir-kidnap-child-1201895285/">shared fantasy about waterboarding</a> to complain, once again, about his archenemy, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170130015842/http://gothamist.com/tags/snl"><em>Saturday Night Live</em></a>. Trump is apparently still deeply upset about SNL writer Katie Rich&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170130015842/http://gothamist.com/2017/01/23/snl_writer_suspended_indefinitely_a.php">tweet about his son Barron</a>, calling her tweet a &quot;disgrace.&quot; </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170130015842/http://deadline.com/2017/01/donald-trump-sean-hannity-saturday-night-live-attack-barron-disgrace-1201895245/">Deadline has</a> the transcript: </p>

<blockquote>&#x201C;Your 10-year-old&#x2026;What a wonderful, smart, charming kid. And then, they attack him; that&#x2019;s got to hurt you and Melania,&#x201D; Hannity asked.

<p>&#x201C;Well, Saturday Night Live - a person from Saturday Night Live was terrible,&#x201D; Trump responded. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s a failing show, it&#x2019;s not funny. Alec Baldwin&#x2019;s a disaster. He&#x2019;s terrible on the show and, by the way, I don&#x2019;t mind some humor but it&#x2019;s terrible. But for them to attack, for NBC to attack my 10-year-old son -&#x201C;</p>

<p>&#x201C;Horrible,&#x201D; Hannity jumped in.</p>

<p>&#x2018;It&#x2019;s a disgrace,&#x201D; Trump said, finishing his thought.</p>

<p>&#x201C;He&#x2019;s a great boy. And it&#x2019;s not an easy thing for him. Believe me,&#x201D; Trump added.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>On Inauguration Day, Rich, who has been a writer with SNL since 2013, tweeted, &quot;Barron will be this country&apos;s first homeschool shooter.&quot; After an outcry, Rich deleted the tweet then apologized: &quot;I sincerely apologize for the insensitive tweet. I deeply regret my actions &amp; offensive words. It was inexcusable &amp; I&apos;m so sorry.&quot; She was suspended by SNL <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170130015842/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/23/arts/television/katie-rich-snl-suspended-barron-trump-tweet.html">indefinitely</a> soon after. </p>

<p>A statement released on Tuesday by the White House press office said, &quot;It is a longstanding tradition that the children of presidents are afforded the opportunity to grow up outside of the political spotlight. The White House fully expects this tradition to continue.&quot; Meanwhile, the comedy community, including Dan Harmon and Paul F Tompkins, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170130015842/http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/01/snl-katie-rich-suspended-barron-trump-comedians">has rallied around Rich.</a></p>

<p>Continuing down his list of petty grievances, Trump also lashed out at Madonna during the Hannity interview: &quot;Honestly, she&apos;s disgusting. I think she hurt herself very badly. I think she hurt that whole cause,&quot; Trump said, referring to Madonna&apos;s remarks at the Woman&apos;s March last weekend. &quot;I thought what she said was disgraceful to our country.&quot; For what it&apos;s worth, Trump has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170130015842/http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2017/01/27/donald-trump-didn-t-think-madonna-was-disgusting-when-he-lied-about-her-wanting-to-date-him.html?via=twitter_page">a nasty, sexist habit</a> of calling women who speak out against him &quot;disgusting&quot;&#x2014;he also once was rumored to have been romantically pursuing her, to the point that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170130015842/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/05/16/donald-trumps-john-miller-interview-is-even-crazier-than-you-think/?utm_term=.7762e2f43304">he allegedly posed as his own publicist</a> to try to plant stories in the tabloids claiming he had rejected <em>her</em> advances. </p>
