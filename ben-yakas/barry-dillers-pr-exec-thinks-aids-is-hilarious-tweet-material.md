<p>Perhaps someday, racists, bigots, homophobes, sexists, trolls, and generally unfunny people are going to learn that they don&apos;t HAVE to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425145611/http://gothamist.com/tags/twitter">tweet every single thought that pops into their heads</a>. But until then, we&apos;ll probably see more tweets like the one above, sent out by professional public relations person <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425145611/https://twitter.com/JustineSacco">Justine Sacco</a>, a NY-based PR chief at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425145611/http://iac.com/">IAC</a>. You know, Barry Diller&apos;s IAC, which is the parent company of things like OKCupid, Vimeo, The Daily Beast, Match.com, CollegeHumor, and more. Something tells us she&apos;s not going to like what is awaiting her when she turns her phone back on.</p>

<p>Sacco, who describes herself as &quot;CorpComms at IAC. Troublemaker on the side. Also known for my loud laugh&quot; on her Twitter profile, seems to have a history of tweeting strange, not particularly funny things that are at times mildly offensive, though more often than not just peculiar and slightly off-putting. Here are some of her greatest hits:</p>

<p>IAC gave this statement <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425145611/http://valleywag.gawker.com/iac-just-contacted-me-with-this-comment-this-is-an-o-1487384090">to Valleywag</a>: &#x201C;This is an outrageous, offensive comment that does not reflect the views and values of IAC. Unfortunately, the employee in question is unreachable on an international flight, but this is a very serious matter and we are taking appropriate action.&#x201D;</p>
