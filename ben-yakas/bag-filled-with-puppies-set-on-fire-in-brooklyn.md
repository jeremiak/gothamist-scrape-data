<p>Police are looking for a group of men who set a garbage bag filled with dogs on fire in Brooklyn over the weekend. The incident was captured on surveillance camera at a soda distribution center on East 91st Street in Canarsie around 1:30 a.m. on Saturday. &quot;I couldn&apos;t stand to look at it. I don&apos;t even like to talk about it. It was a horrible thing to do to a dog,&quot; Sammy Omar, who found the charred remains of an adult pit bull and four puppies, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130512021338/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local/new_york&amp;id=9017163">told ABC</a>. &quot;It was torture. The puppies were all burned up.&quot;</p>

<p>In the surveillance video, two men <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130512021338/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Dogs-Fire-Garbage-Bag-Dumpster-Warehouse-Brooklyn-Canarsie-195481621.html">can be seen</a> getting out of a van and carrying a large black garbage bag to a pile of trash beside a dumpster; they then lit a small fire. As the fire starts to grow, the group takes off. Officials note it is unclear whether the dogs were alive or dead before they were set on fire. </p>

<p>&quot;We saw the dogs burned up. The babies burned up too, it was horrible seeing,&quot; Omar added. &quot;There are sick people out there. I hope they get caught. It wasn&apos;t nice. I hope they pay the price.&quot;</p>

<p>An ASPCA spokesman tells us: &quot;Necroposies are being performed on the five dogs and we&#x2019;re continuing to investigate. Anyone with information about the case is encouraged to call the NYPD or the ASPCA&#x2019;s Humane Law Enforcement department: 877-THE-ASPCA.&quot;</p>
