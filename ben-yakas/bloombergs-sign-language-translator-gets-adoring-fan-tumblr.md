<p>As <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170327125753/http://boingboing.net/2012/10/29/nyc-mayor-bloombergs-asl-int.html">Boing Boing put it</a>, she was &quot;like a human emoticon for one of the nation&apos;s most expressionless mayors.&quot; And now, days after she gestured her way into our hearts, she has gotten the adoring Tumblr that she deserves, which you can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170327125753/http://signlanguagelady.tumblr.com/">check out and contribute to here.</a> </p>

<p>For what it&apos;s worth, our own <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170327125753/https://twitter.com/jenist/status/263319682952601600">Jen Carlson</a> got to meet her briefly this morning, and reports that she doesn&apos;t seem too jazzed up about her newfound fame. When asked about what people were referring to her on the internet as, she said, &quot;Yeah they gave me a name... I don&apos;t know I have to look, &apos;hot sign language&apos; something...&quot; [walks away shuts door behind her!].</p>
