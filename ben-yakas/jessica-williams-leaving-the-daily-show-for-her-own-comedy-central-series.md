<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028111548/http://gothamist.com/tags/dailyshow">The Daily Show</a> ended its spectacular run on Comedy Central last year when Jon Stewart left the show to pursue other&#x2014;wait, it&apos;s still on? Oh right, of course it&apos;s still on, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028111548/http://variety.com/2016/voices/columns/comedy-central-daily-show-1201740385/">how could we forget.</a> Unfortunately, now that we know it&apos;s still on air, we won&apos;t even get to enjoy the best part of the current show, as correspondent <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028111548/http://gothamist.com/tags/jessicawilliams">Jessica Williams</a> announced today that she is leaving the show for good to work on her own sitcom for Comedy Central.</p>

<p>&quot;I feel so many emotions,&quot; the 26-year-old Daily Show correspondent <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028111548/http://www.ew.com/article/2016/06/29/jessica-williams-leaving-daily-show?xid=entertainment-weekly_socialflow_twitter">told EW</a>. &quot;I feel like I&apos;m growing up and graduating.&#x201D; Although she only went around telling her coworkers about the news this week, her last field piece &quot;on Bernie Sanders supporters that are going to vote for Trump&quot; will be aired tomorrow.</p>

Williams, who joined the show in 2012, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028111548/http://variety.com/2016/tv/news/comedy-central-jessica-williams-jordan-klepper-daily-show-1201742710/">signed a development deal</a> with Comedy Central last March, putting the writing on the wall in terms of her exit. She&apos;ll now be working on writing, producing, and starring in a pilot for a half-hour scripted series, co-produced by <em>Broad City</em> writer Naomi Ekperigin. She explained the idea for the show:</p>

<blockquote>I&#x2019;ve had this idea for a while about a young woman who is a feminist and who imagines herself to be &#x201C;woke.&#x201D; I think that a lot of the time, we have this idea that when you are, like, &#x201C;woke&#x201D; &#x2014; and please always put this in quotations! &#x2014; that you should always have your shit together. But I know that often for me, as a black woman of color, I feel like I&#x2019;m supposed to represent these ideals and values that I was taught as a young lady. Like I&#x2019;m supposed to carry myself in a special type of way, but oftentimes I&#x2019;m, like&#x2026; I&#x2019;m still in my 20s, and still kind of a mess. So it&#x2019;s a show about somebody in their 20s who has all these social ideas, but still does not have it together. [Pauses] And she&#x2019;s, like, goofy and silly and funny!

<p>The main thing about the show is that I&#x2019;m excited to, in a silly and funny way, be able to explore ideas of feminism and race and LGBT issues &#x2014; things that I care about and that I talk about on <em>The Daily Show</em> and that I deal with on [her podcast] <em>2 Dope Queens</em>.</p></blockquote><p></p>

There isn&apos;t much talk about current host Trevor Noah, but when asked about her favorite memory of doing the show, she was quick to bring up her old mentor:</p>

<blockquote>Doing live shows in the studio with Jon [Stewart] were some of my favorite moments. Every now and then, I had the ability to make Jon laugh, and that to me was really fun. Sometimes he&#x2019;d laugh, and sometimes he&#x2019;d put his script to his face because something was really funny. He wouldn&#x2019;t just do it just because &#x2014; he&#x2019;d do it because he genuinely thought it was funny. Those are some of my favorite moments that I&#x2019;ll never forget.</blockquote>

<p>As for whether or not she might be interested in returning to the late night television world someday, she left the door ajar: &quot;Yeah, definitely,&quot; she said. &quot;I feel like that&#x2019;s something I would do years down the line, once I&#x2019;ve sort of figured it out and want, like, a job that I do every single day. [Laughs] I definitely think that that&#x2019;s in my futch. That&#x2019;s short for future.&quot;</p>
