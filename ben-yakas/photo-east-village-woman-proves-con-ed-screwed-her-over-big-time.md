<p>Are you a giant midtown tower? Then you&apos;ve <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160507202137/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/10/even_giant_midtown_towers_get_over.php">probably been overcharged</a> by Con Edison. Are you someone who got through last summer&apos;s heatwave intact? Then you&apos;ve <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160507202137/http://gothamist.com/2012/08/27/con_ed_guesstimated_your_electric_b.php">probably been overcharged</a> by Con Edison. Are you a resident of New York City? Then you&apos;ve <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160507202137/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/28/con_ed_charged_nyc_customers_over_t.php">probably been overcharged</a> by Con Edison. But at least one customer noticed such a mistake in time to do something about it&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160507202137/http://www.reddit.com/r/nyc/comments/1aclh8/coned_estimated_by_electric_bill_this_month/">this Redditor got a bill</a> for over $500 (as you can see below) because &quot;they didn&apos;t send someone to read the meters in my building.&quot; In the end, she had it adjusted to $73.</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="31513coned2.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160507202137im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/31513coned2.jpeg" width="640" height="653"> <br> <i> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160507202137/http://www.reddit.com/r/nyc/comments/1aclh8/coned_estimated_by_electric_bill_this_month/">via Reddit</a></i></div> <p></p>

<p>Moral of the story: always assume Con Ed is ripping you off, always check your bill closely, and when in doubt, read your own meter&#x2014;it&apos;s actually <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160507202137/http://www.coned.com/customercentral/meter-reading.asp">not that difficult to do!</a></p>
