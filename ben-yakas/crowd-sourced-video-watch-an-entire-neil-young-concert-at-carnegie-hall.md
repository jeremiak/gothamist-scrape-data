<p>Earlier this month, Neil Young did four consecutive, sold-out performances at Carnegie Hall that were met with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429153450/http://www.billboard.com/articles/events/live/5862604/neil-young-at-carnegie-hall-live-review">rapturous</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429153450/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/08/arts/music/temperamental-neil-young-starts-run-at-carnegie-hall.html">praise</a>. The setlists for the &quot;heavenly acoustic&quot; solo performances were packed with some of his most iconic songs from the late &apos;60s and early &apos;70s, with helping servings of <em>After The Gold Rush</em> and <em>Harvest</em> tunes (as well as some surprises from <em>Time Fades Away</em> and a few folk covers). <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429153450/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/neil-young-stuns-with-a-spellbinding-carnegie-hall-show-20140107">Rolling Stone called it</a> &quot;without a doubt, one of the greatest Neil Young shows of the past decade, at least when he wasn&apos;t playing with Crazy Horse.&quot; </p>

<p>Considering that tickets were going for thousands of dollars by the end of the week, you probably weren&apos;t able to go. But now, fans have made a crowd-sourced full-length concert video of Young&apos;s performance from January 7th. Check it out below.</p>
