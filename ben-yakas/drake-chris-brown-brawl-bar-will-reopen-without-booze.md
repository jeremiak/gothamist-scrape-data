<p>Earlier this month, an out of control <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130916142735/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/14/chris_brown_tweets_photo_of_injured.php">bottle brawl</a> at West Village club <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130916142735/http://gothamist.com/tags/wip">Work In Progress (WiP)</a> caused a wake of destruction&#x2014;Chris Brown had his chin scratched, Drake was ticketed, 25 other people were physically injured (including an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130916142735/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/14/photos_tourist_claims_she_was_hit_b.php#photo-1">Australian tourist</a> and an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130916142735/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/22/tony_parker_sues_soho_club_over_dra.php">Olympic basketball player</a>), Rihanna&apos;s reputation was endangered, and WiP and the Greenhouse club where it&apos;s located were both shut down. But a deal has now been reached <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130916142735/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/chris-brown-drake-brawl-site-slated-reopen-article-1.1104916">to bring both back by early July</a>...except they won&apos;t be allowed to serve any booze for now. Sounds like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130916142735/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/02/mobile_sperm_bar_seeks_donors_for_d.php">mocktails</a>, cutting edge energy drinks, and quiet games of pinochle are back in style!</p>

<p>According to the News, city Attorney Adam Hirsch told Manhattan Supreme Court Judge Geoffrey Wright that the NYPD and club owners made a deal, with the club paying a fine and hiring more security managers. They can reopen July 8th&#x2014;however, they won&apos;t be able to serve alcohol until the state liquor authority <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130916142735/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/27/drakechris_brown_brawl_bar_loses_li.php">restores their license.</a></p>

<p>Capt. Nicole Papamichael, executive officer of the 1st Precinct, told residents at a community meeting that the NYPD had been trying to shut down the clubs for months now&#x2014;she said they responded to approximately one or two reports of felony assault and 10 to 12 reports of grand larceny every week. &quot;Most of our complaints are Century 21, for shoplifting, and Greenhouse,&quot; Papamichael said, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130916142735/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20120629/soho/nypd-tried-shut-down-chris-brown-drake-club-before-brawl">according to DNAInfo</a>. &quot;If we took them away, [crime] would go down 50 percent.&quot; At least now she can better understand why <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130916142735/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/28/nypd_all_up_in_the_club_knows_if_yo.php">certain parties wanted to keep the club open.</a></p>
