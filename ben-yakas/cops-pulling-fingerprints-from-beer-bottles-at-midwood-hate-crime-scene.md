<p>Friday morning in Midwood, on the anniversary of the end of Kristallnacht, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111113190308/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/11/vandals_celebrate_kristallnacht_by.php#photo-6">vandals torched three cars</a>, tried to burn a fourth, and scrawled anti-semitic graffiti on a nearby van and benches. Police are investigating the incident, which took place in the heavily Orthodox Jewish section of Ocean Parkway, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111113190308/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/12/nypd_investigating_anti-semitic_mid.php">as a hate crime</a>. And they are hopeful that beer bottles left at the scene by the perps <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111113190308/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/cops-lifting-fingerprints-dna-27-empty-beer-bottles-found-anti-semitic-arson-attack-article-1.976848">will yield some results</a>: &#x201C;We&apos;ve recovered from the scene 27 empty Corona bottles, so those will be tested for fingerprints as well as DNA,&#x201D; Brooklyn District Attorney Charles Hynes said.</p>

<p>Hynes also confirmed that police don&apos;t think it&apos;s just bad luck that the attack occurred a day after the anniversary of Kristallnacht, when Nazis attacked synagogues and other Jewish establishments in 1939. &#x201C;Whoever it is is reasonably intelligent because I don&#x2019;t think it&#x2019;s a coincidence at all that they chose to do this horrific thing that near the anniversary of Kristallnacht,&#x201D; Hynes said.</p>

<p>The graffiti written near the cars included swastikas and lines like &quot;f the Jews.&quot; A van nearby had &quot;KKK&quot; written on it. Police recovered at least four gas containers&#x2014;as well as a dozen beer bottles&#x2014;from the block of Ocean Parkway, between Avenues I and J. One detective described the scene: &#x201C;There were Coronas everywhere. Looks like they had a party.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Community members and politicians, including State Assemblyman Dov Hikind, state Sen. Eric Adams and civil rights attorney Normal Siegel, will be marching today in a &#x201C;Walk for Tolerance&#x201D; as the investigation continues: &#x201C;We&#x2019;re not going to stand for it. We&#x2019;re not going to let them stop us from walking, from living, from being Jewish,&#x201D; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111113190308/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2011/11/13/community-marches-in-unity-following-midwood-hate-crime/">one resident told CBS</a>. &#x201C;We&#x2019;re not going to let them stop us from doing that. We&#x2019;re upset.&#x201D;</p>
