<p>It may seem like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171030200951/http://gothamist.com/tags/shakeshack">Shake Shack</a> has infiltrated the bellies of every neighborhood in the city, but there are still plenty of areas that have not been slathered in shack sauce and graced with some <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171030200951/http://www.businessinsider.com/why-people-wait-in-line-for-shake-shack-cronuts-iphones-2014-6">very long lines</a>. But that&apos;s all about to change for Morningside Heights: Shake Shack is planning on opening a new location there, across the street from Columbia University by the end of 2017. </p>

<p>The Columbia Spectator <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171030200951/http://columbiaspectator.com/arts-and-entertainment/2017/01/26/shake-shack-open-former-ollies-spot-116th-and-broadway?platform=hootsuite">confirmed the news</a> that they will open a location at the southwest corner of 116th Street and Broadway. It&apos;s a space that used to be occupied by an Ollie&apos;s Noodle Shop, but was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171030200951/http://gothamist.com/2015/03/04/ollies_noodles_explosion.php">nearly destroyed</a> in a fire there back in 2015 (and is believed to have started inside Ollie&apos;s). The space has been boarded up and empty since then.</p>

<p>&quot;For seven or eight years I have said to our team, &apos;Guys, can&#x2019;t we get a Shake Shack up near Columbia and Barnard?&apos;&quot; Shake Shack CEO Randy Garutti told the Spectator. &quot;I have said for years before that this spot, the only spot I really want, is that old Ollie&#x2019;s spot on 116th and Broadway.&quot; Gail Beltrone, Barnard&#x2019;s vice president for campus services, added that they had over 50 possible tenants try to get into the space before they settled on Shack as the &quot;best fit&quot; for the student community and the neighborhood.</p>

<p>While you&apos;ll have to wait until later this year for it to actually open, you can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171030200951/http://gothamist.com/2017/01/23/shake_shack_app_free_burgers.php">sign up for a special app</a> before the end of February and pick up a free ShackBurger from one of their dozens of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171030200951/https://www.shakeshack.com/locations/">other locations</a> around the city. </p>
