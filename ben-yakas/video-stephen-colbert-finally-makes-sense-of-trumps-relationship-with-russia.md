<p>With so many questions swirling around Donald Trump and his various cabinet members&apos; alleged ties to Russia, it would take a real gumshoe to try to make sense of it all. Thankfully, in lieu of that, we have Stephen Colbert and his trusty &quot;Figure-It-Out-A-Tron&quot; here to figure out why Trump went from instant statesman faux-orator back to Captain Twitter Bananas.</p>

<p>Using just a chalkboard, Colbert cracks the case by drawing up all the names of the various officials linked to Russia, and starts putting P&apos;s (for Putin, that&apos;s all they stand for, stop asking questions) next to their names until Trump &quot;is drowning in P, which again, stands for Putin...Just drink it in.&quot; As he concludes the segment, &quot;This could really leave a stain on his legacy.&quot;</p>

<p>In the opening monologue, Colbert chronicled Trump&apos;s weekend tweet-a-thon and his predilection for mixed analogies: &quot;Wait, you just said it was McCarthyism. Now it&apos;s Nixon/Watergate? Pick your historical analogy! &apos;This is the Pearl Harbor of Hindenburg Great Depression D-Days finale of <em>Lost</em>.&apos;&quot; He also tried to distract Trump with the shiny travel ban and shared the latest episode of &apos;Real News Tonight.&apos;</p>

<p>Cartoon Trump was also visited by the cartoon ghosts of presidents past.</p>

<p>And Colbert talked to Anderson Cooper about his media diet (he now mutes Trump on Twitter) and his relationship, or lack thereof, with Kellyanne Conway. </p>
