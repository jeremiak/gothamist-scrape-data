<p>With Donald Trump&apos;s second week as president coming to a close with a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170205191520/http://www.abcactionnews.com/news/state/president-trump-to-visit-florida-this-weekend">well-deserved vacation,</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170205191520/http://gothamist.com/tags/sethmeyers">Seth Meyers</a> decided to offer a progress report on how Trump has been doing. Considering how mundane things have been, we can&apos;t imagine he had much to talk about. </p>

<p>&quot;We&apos;re less than two weeks into Trump&apos;s presidency, and yet somehow it already feels like it&apos;s been two years,&quot; Meyers said. &quot;The first two weeks of the administration have brought into focus the duality of the Trump presidency, and the difficulty the press has in deciding what to cover.&quot; He goes on to cover both the constitutional crises, like the fight over the immigration and refugee travel band, and the mundane weirdness, like thinking Frederick Douglass might be alive. &quot;Who among us wouldn&#x2019;t panic if asked to recite stuff we learned in high school,&quot; Meyers said.</p>

<p>After revisiting the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170205191520/http://gothamist.com/tags/muslimban">Muslim ban</a> controversy, Meyers showed a bunch of clips of Trump and his various surrogates referring to it as a ban, even as spokesperson Sean Spicer has denied it is a &quot;ban.&quot; &quot;Yeah, where could the lying, dishonest media possibly get the idea that this is a ban?&quot; Meyers asked. &quot;That&apos;s a classic case of gotcha journalism, in that they gotcha on camera saying &apos;ban&apos; like a million times.&quot;</p>
