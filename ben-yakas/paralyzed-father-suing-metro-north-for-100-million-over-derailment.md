<p>A father who was paralyzed in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509135200/http://gothamist.com/2013/12/01/multiple_people_killed_in_fatal_met.php#photo-1">Metro-North train derailment</a> this past December is suing the agency for $100 million. Samuel Rivera, 39, a Metro-North heating and air conditioning mechanic, was on the train that derailed near the Spuyten Duyvil station on Dec. 1st. Altogether, 4 people died and over 60 were injured in the crash. &quot;I constantly live with nerve pain in my arms &amp; hands, muscle spasms that painfully twist &amp; turn my spine, and bed sores that never seem to heal,&quot; Rivera said in a statement today. &quot;I must say you don&apos;t realize what you have until it&apos;s gone; simple things like walking and hugging your kids.&quot;</p>

<p>Rivera was riding into the city with his his 14-year-old son Sammy Jr. when the incident happened: &quot;I was watching the <em>Walking Dead</em> on Netflix,&quot; he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509135200/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/man-paralyzed-metro-north-derailment-forgives-engineer-article-1.1750849">told reporters in Westchester</a> today. &quot;I looked up and said, &apos;Man, this train is going fast.&apos; A few minutes later I heard a clunking noise from the train engine and then I was flying in the air,&quot; he said. He was later told that his body smashed into an overhead luggage rack, but he only remembers talking to his son while on the ground: &quot;I remember telling him, &apos;I don&apos;t think I&apos;m going to make it. Take care of mommy,&apos;&quot; Rivera said.</p>

<p>Rivera, who also has a 1-year-old daughter, has no movement of his legs and very little in his arms, and doctors say he has a less than 1% chance of walking again. The train&#x2019;s engineer, William Rockefeller, had been going 82 mph around a 30 mph curve, and later told a union head <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509135200/http://gothamist.com/2013/12/03/metro-north_train_operator_was_zone.php">he had &quot;nodded&quot; and zoned out</a> just before the train derailed. A federal assessment of Metro-North management operations later revealed that the agency&apos;s managers&apos; focus on timeliness of trains <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509135200/http://gothamist.com/2014/03/14/metro-north_unsafe.php">has created &quot;safety-critical shortfalls&quot; within the system.</a></p>

<p>Rivera says Metro-North hasn&apos;t abandoned him, but he needs money for round-the-clock care. And he forgives Rockefeller: &quot;People make mistakes,&quot; he said. &quot;It happens. His mistake just ended up as a major tragedy. I do forgive him.&quot;</p>

<p>You can read his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509135200/http://www.lohud.com/story/news/local/westchester/ossining/2014/04/09/statement-victim-paralyzed-metro-north-bronx-derailment/7501195/">full statement</a> below.</p>

<blockquote>I am writing this statement to describe how the December 1 Metro-North train derailment has affected my family and me. I have not previously spoken publicly because my main concern up to now was to recover from my injuries.

<p>I am a proud American of Puerto Rican descent, a proud New Yorker, a proud conservative, a proud resident of Ossining, New York, and a proud railroader employed by Metro North Railroad. I love my Oakland Raiders, let&apos;s go Yankees, and I&apos;m forever with the Knicks. I take great pride in everything I do, from building and racing model radio controlled nitro cars, work-related repairs and projects, and working on my house. In fact, I never hired a contractor: I did everything in my house myself. I will always be a firm believer in the family. I love my wife dearly and words can&apos;t express how much I love my kids. My wife and I attend all our son&apos;s football and basketball games together.</p>

<p>After this derailment I was left as a C5 quadriplegic, leaving me with no movement of my legs and very little movement of my arms. Although the derailment left me with paralysis and I probably will never walk again, I remain at peace with myself. I do forgive Mr. Rockefeller, but it&apos;s extremely hard to forget the results of his mistake. I constantly live with nerve pain in my arms &amp; hands, muscle spasms that painfully twist &amp; turn my spine, and bed sores that never seem to heal. I must say you don&apos;t realize what you have until it&apos;s gone; simple things like walking and hugging your kids.</p>

<p>Despite my injuries and discomfort, I am grateful to Metro North for remaining by my side during this rough stage of my life and not abandoning an injured employee. I appreciate their efforts in modifying my home so I can return home and live with my family as soon as possible. Never have I worked for a better employer than Metro North Railroad. I showed up on time to work everyday, never punched in late, loved my job and enjoyed the company of my fellow co-workers. Any legal action I am taking against Metro North is to protect my family&apos;s financial future. My care will cost hundreds of thousands of dollars each year.</p>

<p>Days after my injury with many sleepless nights I realized that seat belts or safety restraints are not installed on any train I&apos;ve ever ridden on. It is my opinion that seat belts or some kind of safety restraint should be available for commuters to use at their own discretion. Had safety restraints been available for use that morning, I would have used them. Perhaps we would not be here today. Perhaps there would have been no fatalities and fewer injuries. I&apos;m going to make it my goal to push for legislation to install safety restraints on all public transportation subsidized by federal or state money. It&apos;s also my opinion that any transportation agency that receives federal or state money for their operation should provide some sort protection for the public.</p>

<p>The Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008 enacted by Congress which mandated the installation of PTC (Positive Train Control) by 2015 does not do enough to protect the public from severe injuries. PTC may prevent locomotive collisions and human error but it&apos;s not going to prevent derailments from faulty infrastructure or a sudden wrath of nature in which rails can become obstructed, such as by a landslide on the tracks.</p>

<p>I would like to thank my friend Andrew Forrester, the FDNY, the ICU staff of St. Barnabas Hospital, Dr. Reza Yassari and his staff of Montefiore Hospital, and Dr. Stampas of Burke Rehabilitation Hospital. A special thanks to Burke&apos;s 2 West Spinal Cord therapist for pushing me to the limits, for the laughter, and for picking me up when I was down. Thanks to the Burke&apos;s 2 West Spinal Cord nurses &amp; nurse aids for their care and compassion. Thank you to all our friends in Croton Harmon and the village of Ossining for their support.</p>

<p>I send my deepest condolences to the families who lost their love ones and my prayers for a speedy recovery go out to the rest of the injured commuters of this tragedy.</p></blockquote><p></p>
