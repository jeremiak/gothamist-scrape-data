<p>This past week, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429100554/http://www.timeout.com/london/feature/1153/lies-to-tell-tourists?nc">Time Out London published</a> their newest list of &apos;Lies to Tell Tourists&apos;, a backhanded love letter from residents to visitors, filled with misdirection and miseducation. And while we mostly try to play nice with tourists, even when they ask us <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429100554/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/23/what_do_tourists_learn_from_nyc-bas.php#photo-1">where Central Perk is</a>, we can&apos;t help but have some fun now and again, like with the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429100554/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/19/tourists_now_have_their_own_sidewal.php">Tourist Lane</a>. In that spirit, what are some lies that you tell tourists? Here are our favorites:</p>

<ul>
	<li>&quot;You&apos;re required by law to give a cigarette to anyone who requests one.&quot;</li>
	<li>&quot;You pay for a Metrocard by putting your credit card into the slot at the turnstiles.&quot;</li>
	<li>&quot;That I Heart New York shirt makes you look like one of us!&quot;</li>
	<li>&quot;The Applebees in Times Square is a great place to pick up women.&quot;</li>
	<li>&quot;Manhattan ends at 125th Street.&quot;</li>
	<li>&quot;Little Italy is full of authentic Italian stuff.&quot;</li>
	<li>&quot;Don&apos;t forget to tip your subway train conductor.&quot;</li>
	<li>&quot;The NYU campus is famous for its beautiful architecture.&quot;</li>
	<li>&quot;When you hear the bells of St. Patrick&apos;s ring, you should fire your gun in the air.&quot;</li>
	<li>&quot;You pronounce Houston Street like the city in Texas.&quot;</li>
	<li>&quot;You can&apos;t have the real New York Experience until you&apos;ve been to Madam Tussaud&apos;s.&quot;</li>
	<li>&quot;Yeah, the line to the Empire State Building is pretty reasonable.&quot;</li>
	<li>&quot;It&apos;s no big deal to eat on the subway.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Cops never troll Central Park looking for bikers to ticket.&quot;</li>
	<li>&quot;Serendipity is definitely worth the wait.&quot;</li>
	<li>&quot;I live in Woody Allen&apos;s old apartment.&quot;</li>
	<li>&quot;The only open cabs are the ones WITHOUT the lights on.&quot;</li>
	<li>&quot;The best shopping is on Canal Street.&quot;</li>
	<li>&quot;Your skirt is too short to ride a bike.&quot;</li>
	<li>&quot;42nd Street is that way.&quot;</li>
</ul>
