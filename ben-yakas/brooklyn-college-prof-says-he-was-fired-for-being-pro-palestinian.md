<p>A Brooklyn College adjunct professor is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170326032149/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/anti_israel_prof_canned_4VKrWweVduClYCw7HDUCJO?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">claiming</a> that he was fired because of his pro-Palestinian politics. College officials say that Kristofer Petersen-Overton, 26, was fired from teaching a Middle East politics class because he didn&apos;t have a Ph.D. But Petersen-Overton thinks it was because of political pressure from outside the college. &quot;It&apos;s pretty clear that this was politically motivated. I don&apos;t blame the pro-Israel crowd. I blame the administration for caving in to the pressure,&quot; said Petersen-Overton.</p>

<p>&quot;[He] simply did not have the credentials to be teaching at the graduate level,&quot; said Brooklyn College spokesman Jeremy Thompson. Petersen-Overton thinks that he was fired after complaints came from Assemblyman Dov Hikind. Hikind recently faxed a letter to the school alleging the adjunct professor has written several academic papers that are anti-Israeli, and attempt to understand suicide bombers. &quot;<strong>This guy was literally radical and one-sided.</strong> Whatever your point of view is, if you&apos;re a teacher you&apos;re supposed to present both sides,&quot; said Hikind, defending himself <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170326032149/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2011/01/27/2011-01-27_propalestinian_views_cost_me_my_job__prof.html">to the News.</a> This isn&apos;t Brooklyn College&apos;s first brush with Middle East controversy: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170326032149/http://gothamist.com/2010/08/30/brooklyn_college_alumn_cuts_school.php">last summer</a>, an alumnus cut his alma mater out of his will because freshman were assigned a book by a &quot;radical pro-Palestinian.&quot;</p>
