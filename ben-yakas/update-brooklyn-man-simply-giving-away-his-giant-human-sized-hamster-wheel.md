<p><strong>[Disappointing Update Below]</strong> There too few times in life when one has an opportunity to run on a human-sized hamster wheel&#x2014;and there are even fewer times when one gets the opportunity to <em>own</em> their own human-sized hamster wheel. But now is your opportunity to do both: a Brooklyn man is giving away the room-filling, human-sized hamster wheel which he built himself. And he&apos;s getting rid of this larger-than-life item because it&apos;s ruining his friendships.</p>

<p>We contacted Sandra Z. Zzz after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502235108/http://newyork.craigslist.org/brk/zip/4133843238.html">spotting his Craigslist ad</a> this morning: &quot;CAN ACCOMODATE UP TO 200 LBS. FULLY FUNCTIONAL. NOT RECOMMENDED FOR HOUSES WITH SMALL CHILDREN OR ANIMALS. 50 LBS OF SHREDDED NEWSPAPER ALSO AVAILABLE.&quot; Zzz, who said he was in the middle of using the wheel when we called him, told us that he constructed the metal piece over the course of a year. He insists it isn&apos;t an art project: &quot;I made made it so that I could run in it,&#x201D; he said. &quot;Exercise, novelty fun.&quot;</p>

<p>Sadly, it&apos;s taken a toll on his social life: &quot;I can&#x2019;t make any friends anymore. Any time I bring one of my friends over, there will be like a hamster wheel, like too much of a conversation piece. I can&#x2019;t function as a normal human being anymore.&#x201D; He explained further, &quot;When I have a great conversation with someone and I bring them over to my house and there&#x2019;s a hamster wheel, it&#x2019;s this whole thing, then we talk about my childhood and stuff, it&#x2019;s too much.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Zzz is dedicated to giving the wheel away to someone soon (&quot;A lot of people have been calling me about it, just have to find the right match for the hamster wheel.&#x201D;), so if you&apos;re interested, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502235108/http://newyork.craigslist.org/brk/zip/4133843238.html">you better act quickly.</a></p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: Sometimes a free human-sized hamster wheel is just too good to be true: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502235108/http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2013/10/human-size-hamster-wheel-craigslist-brooklyn.html">Daily Intel also interviewed</a> Mr. Sasha Z. Zzz, and discovered afterwards that the giant hamster wheel actually belonged to Seattle man Luke Trerice. </p>

<p>Zzz had told us he would send us his address to come see the wheel, so this explains the delay in getting that. Now we don&apos;t know whether we&apos;ll ever trust anyone giving away a giant hamster wheel again.</p>
