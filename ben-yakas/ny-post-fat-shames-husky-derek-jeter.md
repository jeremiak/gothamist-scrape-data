<p>Yankees captain <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426153532/http://gothamist.com/tags/derekjeter">Derek Jeter</a> is still rehabilitating since he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426153532/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/14/derek_jeter_done_for_season_after_i.php">suffered a fractured left ankle</a> in the first game of the ALCS this year. The NY Post <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426153532/http://www.nypost.com/p/sports/yankees/exclusive_photo_captain_munch_QNmVyqVl7eIPeKPH0sR53H">caught a glimpse of him</a> at a hotel on South Beach in Miami yesterday, and responded by dubbing him &quot;Derek Eater&quot; on their back cover. We haven&apos;t seen fat shaming this bad since Betty Draper made sweet love to whipped cream in season 5 of <em>Mad Men</em>.</p>

<p>Of course, it&apos;s kind of hard to tell if Jeter actually is &quot;fat,&quot; as they allege, or if the photographer just caught him on a windy day at a very bad angle. He&apos;s certainly no <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426153532/http://www.tumblr.com/tagged/fat-lee-adama">Fat Lee Adama</a>. And regardless, there&apos;s a good reason for why he may have added a few pounds this offseason: general manager Brian Cashman told them Jeter has been in a non-weight bearing situation and will continue to be until January. In other words, he can&apos;t really work out right now. Hopefully Jeter has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426153532/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/31/ladies_get_ready_for_your_derek_jet.php">a lot of signed baseballs ready</a>&#x2014;because it&apos;s going to take a lot of one-night stands to get over the sting of the Post.</p>
