<p>A Westchester man <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420034253/http://www.lohud.com/article/20140207/NEWS02/302070120/Pelham-High-grad-missing-Mexico-way-recreate-scene-Shawshank-?odyssey=tab%7Ctopnews%7Ctext%7CNews&amp;nclick_check=1">has gone missing</a> in Mexico while on a motorcycling trip of the country. Pelham High School grad Harry Devert, 32, quit his finance job to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420034253/http://www.anewyorkertravels.com/">travel the world</a> last year. But he hasn&apos;t been heard of since January 25th; he had told friends that he was headed to Zihuatanejo, specifically to the beach that featured prominently in the climax of the film <em>The Shawshank Redemption</em>. Now his friends and family <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420034253/https://www.facebook.com/helpfindharry">have launched a social media campaign</a> to try to find him.</p>

<p>&quot;Just got an hour and a half long escort out of some area it was too dangerous for me to be. Stopping for lunch and ... voila Internet,&quot; he wrote in his last correspondence to his girlfriend, Sarah Schiear, via WhatsApp, on Jan. 25th. &quot;Gonna get back on the road soon. Apparently there&apos;s another military escort waiting for me in some other town...I&apos;m running way late because of the crazy military stuff...hopefully get a chance to talk to you tonight when I (hopefully) finally arrive.&quot;</p>

<p>Devert, who left Westchester for his trip in December, planned to travel through Mexico down to South America. He last checked in at Uriangato, Mexico, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420034253/http://instagram.com/anewyorkertravels">on his Instagram account.</a> &quot;My son is a great communicator and he always lets me know&#x2014;because I&apos;m anxious&#x2014;as close as he can where he&apos;s going to be or if he&apos;s going to be out of touch,&quot; his mother, Ann Devert, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420034253/http://www.cnn.com/2014/02/08/world/americas/missing-american-mexico/index.html">told CNN.</a> She became especially worried when he didn&apos;t call her on January 29th, his late father&apos;s birthday: &quot;And when he didn&apos;t, I felt a misgiving but I thought maybe it would take a couple of days,&quot; she said. &quot;He didn&apos;t call.&quot;</p>

<p>Devert hoped to write a book about his experiences traveling around Latin America, and make a career out of his travels, according to his mother. &quot;He always tells me, &apos;I take risks but I&apos;m not an idiot,&apos; &quot; she added.</p>
