(AP)</i></div> Last week, President Obama <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505163201/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/31/obama_christie_tour_sandys_damage_i.php">surveyed Hurricane Sandy&apos;s damage</a> in the Garden State with new BFF NJ Governor <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505163201/http://gothamist.com/tags/chrischristie">Chris Christie</a>&#x2014;but he didn&apos;t step foot in NYC. Obama had offered to come by, but Mayor Bloomberg politely declined because of the clean-up effort (&#x201C;We&#x2019;ve got a lot of things to do&quot;). But now that things have calmed down a bit, Obama will <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505163201/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/obama-sandy-destruction-nov-15-article-1.1199560">swing through town next Thursday</a>. And Bloomberg is just &quot;thrilled&quot; about the drop in. <p></p>

<p>No, really, he&apos;s not being sarcastic, even though Bloomberg often comes across like Randy Marsh in the recent &quot;Sarcastaball&quot; episode of <em>South Park</em>. &quot;We&apos;re honored to have him,&quot; Bloomberg said while taking questions during his afternoon press conference <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505163201/http://gothamist.com/2012/11/09/watch_live_soon_bloomberg_introduce.php">on the new Rapid Repair program.</a> &quot;When the first visit was, the president and I agreed it just wasn&apos;t the time to come to NYC, because so much stuff was happening...we&apos;re very happy to have him.&quot; This will be the first time Bloomberg and Obama have seen each other since <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505163201/http://gothamist.com/2012/11/01/bloomberg_endorses_obama_for_presid.php">Bloomberg endorsed the president.</a></p>

<p>Bloomberg was quite defensive when he was asked about rejecting the president&apos;s initial offer. &quot;That&apos;s not true, I didn&apos;t ask him not to come, we had a conversation about where it would be most effective,&quot; Hizzoner said. &quot;He can&apos;t go every place every time and we&apos;re thrilled to have him come.&quot; Maybe someone mixed up the real Bloomberg with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505163201/http://gothamist.com/2012/11/04/videos_snl_unleashes_louis_ck_linco.php#photo-2">his SNL doppelg&#xE4;nger</a>:</p>
