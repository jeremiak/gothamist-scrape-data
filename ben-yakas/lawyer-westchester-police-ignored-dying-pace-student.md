And witnesses have told him that Henry allegedly was handcuffed and left on the road for up to 15 minutes without medical attention while medical teams treated a less seriously injured officer at the scene.<p></p>

<p>&#x201C;I have absolutely been told that, [and if it&apos;s true] then it&#x2019;s reprehensible...I&#x2019;m trying to get to the bottom of what in the world happened,&#x201D; he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408191736/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/pace_football_star_lawyer_dying_7oZLK51O6Kmgu3kRBvQJtO">told reporters</a> yesterday. Sussman added that it was too early to say whether the family would file a lawsuit against police. According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408191736/http://gothamist.com/2010/10/19/state_police_to_probe_police_shooti.php">Mount Pleasant police</a>, a Pleasantville cop knocked on Henry&apos;s window outside a &quot;rowdy&quot; scene at a shopping center, but Henry accelerated, with the cop on his hood, so the other cop fired; another police officer also fired when Henry drove towards him. According to witnesses, Henry had been told he had to move because he was blocking a fire lane.</p>

<p>In a statement today, the family said: &#x201C;<strong>The images and reports of our beloved son being handcuffed and left without medical attention for several minutes after he was shot are too much for us to bear right now</strong>, yet they represent part of the real truth from that evening...While we had been assured of an objective investigation, we are deeply troubled by the various and conflicting accounts reported of the incident that lead to our son&#x2019;s tragic passing.&#x201D;</p>
