<p>There&apos;s been a lot of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502152410/http://gothamist.com/tags/rollingstones">Rolling Stones</a> news lately: they have a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502152410/http://store.universal-music.co.uk/restofworld/the-rolling-stones/grrr-greatest-hits/icat/rollingstones-grrr/">new greatest hits album</a> coming (with two new recordings), there&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502152410/http://www.rollingstones.com/2012/08/30/crossfire-hurricane-a-new-film-from-the-rolling-stones/">a new documentary</a> premiering on HBO in November, and they&apos;re rumored to be playing a few live shows to celebrate their 50th anniversary (including <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502152410/http://gothamist.com/2012/08/30/rolling_stones_to_play_barclays_cen.php">two at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn</a>). Now you can add one more thing to that list: MoMA will host a Rolling Stones film retrospective from November 15th to December 2nd. </p>

<p>The exhibition opens with a rare screening of Robert Frank&apos;s <em>S-8 Stones Footage from Exile on Main Street</em> (1972), and <em>Cocksucker Blues</em> (1972), both chronicling the Stone&apos;s 1972 North American cross-country tour (and all the debauchery and drugs that came along with it). The exhibition closes with screenings on December 1st and 2nd of Peter Whitehead&apos;s <em>The Rolling Stones Charlie Is My Darling - Ireland 1965 </em>(1965/2012), making its debut after an absence of more than 45 years and offering never-before-seen footage. </p>

<p>In between, there will be classics such as the 1969 tour documentary <em>Gimme Shelter</em> (1970), Mick Jagger&apos;s starring role in <em>Performance</em> (1970), and Keith Richards in a suit in <em>Chuck Berry Hail! Hail! Rock &apos;n&apos; Roll</em> (1987). There&apos;ll also be plenty of concert footage&#x2014;everything from <em>The T.A.M.I. Show</em> (1964) to <em>The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus</em> (1968/1996) to Hal Ashby&apos;s <em>Let&apos;s Spend the Night Together</em> (1983) and Martin Scorsese&apos;s <em>Shine a Light</em> (2008).</p>

<p>And of course there will be plenty of their classic, silly, Mick Jagger-strutting, Keith Richards-sneering, pre and post-MTV music videos. Below, we&apos;ve picked out some of our favorites to whet your appetite. If Charlie Watts looks bored or Jagger is making a ridiculous face, everything is probably alright with the world!</p>
