<p>It seems there&apos;s only one type of person who can get away with seriously messing up a cop car: a firefighter. The above photos were taken last night at Amsterdam Avenue near West 181st Street, where over 150 firefighters <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501072500/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/24/4-alarm_fire_ravages_washington_hei.php">battled a huge four-alarm blaze</a> at a five-story building. It seems that FDNY needed to break out the outrigger to stabilize a fire truck during ladder deployment. And in the process, it crushed the cop car from top to bottom. Oopsy!</p>

<p>According to FDNY, four firefighters and one civilian were treated for minor injuries, but no one was hurt otherwise. As for the outrigger, their spokesman had no information about it. You can see a few more photos <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501072500/http://statter911.com/2013/01/23/if-a-picture-paints-a-thousand-words-i-bet-999-of-them-coming-from-one-nypd-officer-this-morning-were-expletives/">at Statter 911</a>, who adds that the incident happened &quot;between FDNY&#x2019;s Ladder 45 and an NYPD car from the 33rd Precinct.&quot; </p>

<p>One NYPD officer who goes by the handle <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501072500/http://www.reddit.com/user/10-13">10-13</a> on Reddit <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501072500/http://www.reddit.com/r/nyc/comments/175dy3/it_doesnt_matter_who_you_are_dont_block_the_fire/">gave this explanation</a>: </p>

<blockquote>Both PD and FD respond to fire alarms, as FD and PD work together on these kinds of jobs. Usually, a patrol car is a lot closer to the scene than a firehouse is, as the fire trucks are inside of the station until they are called.

<p>Now, on occasion, a PD car will be parked outside of the scene when the police are inside of the building evacuating people if a fire is present. If a police car needs to get damaged because FD needs to set up to rescue/control a fire, so be it.</p>

<p>This isn&apos;t some sort of grudge or anything... it&apos;s police and fire department work. We do work together, you know.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>Well, that might be news to some of the less forgiving gentlemen over at the unofficial cop message board, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501072500/http://theerant.yuku.com/topic/56253/Ouch-33-PCT?page=1#.UQGMWEqlsrw">Thee Rant.</a> </p>
