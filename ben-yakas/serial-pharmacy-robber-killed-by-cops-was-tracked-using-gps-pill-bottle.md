<p>Police <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140520004310/http://gothamist.com/2014/05/16/robbery_suspect_fatally_shot_by_cop.php">fatally shot a serial pharmacy robber</a> on the Upper East Side yesterday. Police say that Scott Kato, 45, robbed HealthSource Pharmacy, at Second Avenue and East 68th Street, around 1:30 p.m. Friday; they say Kato was believed to have robbed that particular pharmacy five times since 2011. Police were able to track Kato down quickly yesterday because he stole a decoy pill bottle equipped with a GPS device.</p>

<p>Kato, who had taken various bottles of pills (prescription painkillers and erectile-enhancement pills) and cash from the pharmacy, was confronted by cops at a service road near the FDR Drive on 96th Street around 2 p.m. Police say they fatally shot him after he reached for a gun. &quot;I heard the 10 shots fired and saw a swarm of cops,&#x201D; witness Oneil Dixon <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140520004310/http://nypost.com/2014/05/16/cops-shot-robber-dead-as-he-fled-scene-sources/">told the Post</a>. &quot;Cops surrounded him and he pulled a gun on the cops. The guy was stupid. Where did he think he was going to go?&quot; Kato served about 16 years in prison during two stints between 1990 and 2008 for sexual abuse and robbery convictions.</p>

<p>The NYPD started tagging drugstore prescription bottles with GPS chips in hopes of tracking thieves <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140520004310/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/15/pill_thieves_beware_nypd_plans_to_a.php">last year</a>; the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140520004310/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/17/nyregion/robbery-suspect-tracked-by-gps-and-killed.html?ref=nyregion&amp;_r=1">NY Times reports</a> that this is the first known case in which a decoy bottle helped police track down a suspect.</p>
