<p>What&apos;s the deal with the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428180625/http://gothamist.com/tags/brooklyncyclones">Brooklyn Cyclones</a> hosting a &quot;Seinfeld Night&quot; in honor of the 25th anniversary of the show&apos;s debut?? Well sir, the deal is that this event is happening on July 5th, to commemorate the 1989 broadcast of &quot;The Seinfeld Chronicles,&quot; and it looks like a true <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428180625/http://gothamist.com/tags/seinfeld"><em>Seinfeld</em></a> aficionado was involved in planning it, because it is a totally sponge-worthy event. </p>

<p>Here&apos;s a rundown of all the Seinmoments <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428180625/http://www.brooklyncyclones.com/news/?article_id=1758">you can look forward to</a>:</p>

<ul>
	<li>MCU Park will known as Vandelay Industries Park for one night only.</li>
	<li>Mailmen in uniform get to throw out a ceremonial first pitch (&quot;Hello Newman!&quot;)</li>
	<li>Anyone who has a business card indicating that they are in fact a &quot;Latex Salesman&quot; will also receive a free ticket to the game.  If we call the number and it&apos;s some apartment on the Upper East Side, you won&apos;t qualify for the freebie. </li>
	<li>Fans can visit the information table for an &quot;airing of grievances.&quot;</li>
	<li>Closest to the pin / whale&apos;s blow hole competition (&quot;Is that a Titleist?&quot;)</li>
	<li>The foul poles will be known as Festivus Poles.</li>
	<li>&quot;Low-Talking&quot; PA Announcer.</li>
	<li>Elaine Dancing Contest</li>
	<li>Everyone Runs the Bases Post-game...but anyone named Jerry gets a head start (Take that Duncan Meyer).</li>
	<li>Game of &quot;Risk&quot; on the Concourse</li>
	<li>Cereal eating contests</li>
	<li>Anyone named George Costanza will be allowed to join our radio broadcast as a color analyst for an inning</li>
	<li>Players in puffy shirts for batting practice.</li>
</ul>

<p>If this inspires anyone to get a fake &quot;George Costanza&quot; ID, then clearly the Cyclones are making the world a slightly better place (related: how do teens even get fake IDs these days?). Single-game tickets for the momentous event will go on sale on May 10th. The &#x201C;Magic Loogie&quot; bobblehead will only be given out to the first 2,500 fans through the gates, so make sure you get to the stadium early, lest you want to deal with 2,500 shit-eating Newman-esque grins.</p>
