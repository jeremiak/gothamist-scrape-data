<p>Fake MTA posters are a dime a dozen at this point&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429104757/http://gothamist.com/2009/04/17/subway_alert.php">Y Train signs</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429104757/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/28/did_you_get_a_free_ride_on_the_subw.php">free subway rides</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429104757/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/21/map_hipster_friendly_mta.php">hipster signs</a>, heck, we&apos;ve even made <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429104757/http://gothamist.com/2006/01/05/exclusive_best.php">our own fake signs before.</a> But this year, one intrepid street artist/prankster has dedicated himself to placing <em>Lord Of The Rings</em>-themed MTA posters around the subway stations (as you can see above). </p>

<p>As fans of all things Tolkien around these parts&#x2014;from the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429104757/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/08/is_this_the_greatest_ny_times_corre.php">NY Times corrections</a> to the latest <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429104757/http://gothamist.com/tags/lordoftherings"><em>The Hobbit</em> films</a>&#x2014;we were particularly pleased by the incredibly specific signage filled with excerpts from the books and images of some of Tolkien&apos;s finest creatures (Mirkwood Spiders, Treebeard, Nazgul). The posters are the work of one William Puck, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429104757/http://puckworks.blogspot.com/">who has a blog keeping track of each sign as they go up</a> (you can see more of the posters there).</p>

<p>We&apos;ve reached out to Puck to try to ask him a bit more about his project, especially because there&apos;s one part we can&apos;t quite figure out: all of the signs direct people to puck.info for &quot;travel info, travel tools, widgets, app, and more.&quot; While this is likely just mirroring the MTA&apos;s &quot;go to mta.info&quot; language, there is no address for his own blog, and there really IS a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429104757/http://www.puck.info/">puck.info</a>. So is it just an oversight, or is Puck secretly working to spread viral marketing for a Polish travel website? </p>
