<p>An enterprising New Jersey college student with a fervent belief in preparedness has unleashed an emergency <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140316000517/http://gothamist.com/tags/condoms">condom</a> delivery service at his school. Sophomore Kyle McCabe dons a flashing siren helmet to transform into <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140316000517/http://condam.net/">CondAM</a> (Condom Ambulance) to deliver safe sex to the students at the College of New Jersey. And the 19-year-old is <em>very</em> passionate about safe sex: &#x201C;Some friends and I have all run into a similar problem,&#x201D; McCabe <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140316000517/http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2012/12/new-jersey-college-students-call-condom-ambulance-for-protection/">told ABC</a>. &#x201D;I just sort of would rather people call me instead of going through with any sort of sexual encounters unprotected.&#x201D;</p>

<p>McCabe first thought of the idea last year, but it&apos;s really picked up steam (and a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140316000517/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/condam-delivers-condoms-straight-students-doors-article-1.1263625">decent</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140316000517/http://gawker.com/5984213/new-jersey-college-student-starts-emergency-condom-delivery-service-for-students-who-lack-protection">amount</a> of press) since last October, when he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140316000517/http://www.facebook.com/condomambulance">started the Facebook page</a>. Students can order by calling, texting or  filling out an online form, and McCabe will be there in minutes&#x2014;he adds that the company is now &quot;a registered Limited Liability Corporation&#xFEFF; AND I make each student sign a waiver of liability at the point of purchase.&quot;</p>

<p>And his businesses is only bound to get bigger: two condom brands&#x2014;Lifestyles and Glydes&#x2014;have reached out and offered to partner with him. He&apos;s open 24/7, and says he gets about 30-40 orders during peak weekend hours. There are drawbacks though: &#x201C;At like 2 or 3 a.m. and I&#x2019;m sitting with my girlfriend and I get a call,&#x201D; he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140316000517/http://www.tcnjsignal.net/2013/01/29/condam%E2%80%99s-world-wide-recognition-delivery-success-is-no-easy-job/">told TCNJ&#x2019;s Signal</a>. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s a little hard to get up and go full speed. But I know if I get a call there&#x2019;s kids in need &#x2026; I&#x2019;m happy to do it.&#x201D; Heh heh heh, he said &quot;do it.&quot;</p>
