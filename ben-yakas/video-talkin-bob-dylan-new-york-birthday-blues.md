In \"Hard Times In New York,\" he takes a more comical approach to the subject: \"From Washington Heights to Harlem on down/Thereâs a-mighty many people all millinâ all around/Theyâll kick you when youâre up and knock you when youâre down\"", "credit":""};galleryObj['photo_4'] = photo;</script>

Most importantly, Dylan absorbed elements of Van Ronk\'s larger-than-life personality, as well as his interpretative skills: \"He turned every folk song into a surreal melodrama, a theatrical piece...Every night I felt like I was sitting at the feet of a timeworn monument...\<strong\>Later, when I would record my first album, half the cuts on it were renditions of songs that Van Ronk did.
