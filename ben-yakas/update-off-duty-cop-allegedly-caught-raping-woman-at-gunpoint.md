The suspect flashed what appeared to be a police badge at the victim around 6:45 a.m., near the intersection of Park Terrace West and West 217th Street, before forcing himself upon her; witnesses who were walking by saw the rape, and called 911. &quot;They apparently caught the guy in the act,&quot; a neighbor <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150421233023/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/police_investigate_rape_in_inwood_jWF9FLkkhXANS0UofRArKL">told the Post.</a></p>

<p>The victim, who is in her 20s, was on her way to work when the suspect stopped her and asked for directions. He demanded she follow him where he wanted, and when she refused, he flashed the badge and then took out his gun. The attack took place in the rear courtyard of a building on Park Terrace West. </p>

<p>A neighbor <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150421233023/http://www.dnainfo.com/20110819/washington-heights-inwood/man-with-badge-rapes-woman-at-gunpoint-inwood-sources-say">told DNAInfo that</a> he saw what appeared to be a man and woman outside his window having sex after waking up to loud noises. When he confronted the man, saying, &#x201C;dude, I live here,&#x201D; the suspect responded by holding up his hand, saying, &quot;just give me a minute.&quot; The neighbor also noticed the gun and badge, and called 911. The suspect is currently in custody and charges are pending. </p>
