<p>A Bronx woman has been arrested and charged with fatally stabbing her husband in a homeless shelter. According to police, Patricia Nimmons, 55, is accused of stabbing her 50-year-old husband in the torso inside the homeless shelter room they shared on Prospect Avenue around 9 p.m. Friday night. &quot;I heard them fighting, there were pots falling and I heard them scuffling around,&quot; neighbor Jake Pankey <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130827093631/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/bronx/woman-stabs-husband-death-fight-bronx-homeless-shelter-article-1.1429584">told the News</a>. &quot;Then I heard one of them say &apos;Be quiet. Be quiet.&apos; After that there was nothing. No sound. Then I saw the EMTs show up, then the police.&quot;</p>

<p>The man was rushed to Lincoln Medical Center with Nimmons by his side, where he died. &quot;When the ambulance came and they put him in she got in with them,&quot; said witness Rosemary Nieves. &quot;She looked scared. Her eyes were really wide. She looked nervous and scared.&quot; Nieves added that Nimmons has a history of mental issues: &quot;He would cook Jamaican food in the kitchen...he was a decent man. He got up and worked,&quot; Nieves said. &quot;His wife was a different story though. She wasn&apos;t all there.&quot;</p>

<p>Nimmons has been charged with second degree murder, manslaughter and criminal possession of a weapon.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: According <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130827093631/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20130817/morrisania/bronx-woman-kills-husband-claims-was-self-defense-cops-say">to DNAInfo</a>, Nimmons told cops that her husband had come home from work shortly before the incident, and the two got into a heated argument. She said that her husband had picked up a stick and started to beat her with it, so she stabbed him in self-defense.</p>
