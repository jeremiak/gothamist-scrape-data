<p>You probably already know that in recent years cops have embraced social media as a tool for finding criminals. Ray Kelly often touts <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408145455/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/02/nypd_is_trolling_facebook_youtube_t.php">Operation Crew Cut</a>, which uses the Facebook activity of alleged gang members to string together <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408145455/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/24/nypd_murders_down_33_in_2013_thanks.php">charges of organized crime</a>, as one of the main reasons why the murder rate <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408145455/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/09/new_yorkers_go_24_hours_without_sho.php">has dropped off so much recently.</a> But that&apos;s not the only thing cops use Facebook for: Port Authority cops <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408145455/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20131113/washington-heights/suicidal-teen-gets-help-after-papd-reaches-him-on-facebook-officials-say">successfully reached out</a> to a suicidal 18-year-old who threatened to jump off the George Washington Bridge yesterday. &#x201C;We&apos;ve used Facebook to verify a threat and access pictures, but this is the first time we&#x2019;ve used social media to reach out to someone in a case like this,&quot; said Port Authority Lt. Thomas Michaels.</p>

<p>The unidentified 18-year-old NJ resident posted a picture of the GW Bridge with the words &#x201C;I&apos;m thinking of jumping&quot; on his Facebook page on Tuesday afternoon. A friend saw the post and contacted the Port Authority Police Department; Michaels gave out a Facebook photo of the college student to his officers, and left a message on the teen&#x2019;s Facebook page with his number, encouraging him to call him. </p>

<p>And he did. &#x201C;He was a young kid in a really bad place. We talked about it for a while, and I told him about my troubles in college,&#x201D; Michaels <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408145455/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/facebook-cops-thwart-george-washington-bridge-suicide-article-1.1515528">told the News</a>. &#x201C;Then he told me he was in a bus (near the bridge), and we started talking about some of the stops coming up. And I convinced him to get off at one of the stops.&#x201D; The teen did get off the bus at the next stop, and was taken to a local hospital for observation.</p>
