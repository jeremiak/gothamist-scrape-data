<p>In addition to West, Scott-Heron&#x2019;s daughter, Gia, sang the Bette Midler ballad &#x201C;The Rose,&#x201D; and members of Scott-Heron&#x2019;s touring band&#x2014;including multi-instrumentalist Glen Turner and saxophonists Vernon James and Bilal Sunni-Ali&#x2014;performed two of his hits, &#x201C;Better Days Ahead&#x201D; and &#x201C;The Bottle.&#x201D;</p>
