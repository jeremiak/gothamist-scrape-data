                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="10314mta.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20140206184804im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/10314mta.jpg" width="640" height="481"> <br> <i> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140206184804/http://www.flickr.com/photos/mtaphotos/11727460084/">MTA&apos;s flickr</a></i></div> <p></p>

<p>Subway service has been understandably <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140206184804/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/03/subway_flights_blizzard_nyc.php">a bit slow today</a> because of the snow storm&#x2014;and it appears it&apos;ll remain that way for most of the weekend as well. The MTA announced that, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140206184804/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/02/thanks_blizzard_no_express_subway_s.php#photo-1">like last night</a>, all express service will be suspended as of 5:45 p.m. Friday. Limited express service <em>may</em> resume tomorrow, but it also...may not. &quot;Service can be curtailed or suspended on an individual line or route basis as conditions warrant,&quot; they write.</p>

<p>All local service will continue the same over the weekend, and all planned work has been cancelled. Make sure to check <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140206184804/http://alert.mta.info/">MTA.info</a> tomorrow for the latest updates on service. If you want to see what the MTA does to keep the tracks clear during snow and weather-related emergencies, watch the video below.</p>
