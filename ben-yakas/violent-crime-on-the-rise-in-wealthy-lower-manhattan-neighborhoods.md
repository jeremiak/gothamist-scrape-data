<p>According <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130517065429/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/03/shootings_murders_down_in_first_qua.php">to recent NYPD data</a>, shootings in NYC fell by 24% while murders dropped by 30% in the first quarter of this year, compared with the same period of time in 2012. However, it seems that violent crimes&#x2014;including rape, felony assault and grand larceny&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130517065429/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/felony_crime_spike_4zHVGLWLaA32L2ve4VZUHK">has risen dramatically</a> in the first three months of 2013 in many affluent lower Manhattan neighborhoods, including Chelsea, Gramercy Park, TriBeCa, SoHo and Midtown South.</p>

<p>&#x201C;We are the new 42nd Street before it was cleaned up. All of those problems came here,&#x201D; Robert Ziegler, the co-owner of the Boots &amp; Saddle bar on Christopher Street in the Village, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130517065429/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/felony_crime_spike_4zHVGLWLaA32L2ve4VZUHK">told the Post</a>. &#x201C;I&#x2019;ve been here for 15 years, and this last four or five years is the worst I thought I&#x2019;d ever see it. But these past few months, it&#x2019;s gotten worse.&#x201D; </p>

<p>The biggest change has been to the West Village&#x2019;s 6th Precinct, which has reported 44 felony assaults so far this year (compared to 16 in 2012), while grand larceny jumped 36.6 percent to 351 incidents (compared to 257 in 2012). You can see the changes <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130517065429/http://www.nyc.gov/html/nypd/downloads/pdf/crime_statistics/cs006pct.pdf">in the weekly CompStat reports</a> the NYPD puts online. The 13th Precinct (Gramercy) and the 1st Precinct (TriBeCa, SoHo and the Financial District) each reported five rapes since January, up from two each in the same period in 2012; Chelsea&#x2019;s 10th Precinct recorded four rapes, up from none a year ago, and saw a 61.5 percent hike in felony assaults, from 13 to 21.</p>

<p>However, it wasn&apos;t all bad news: Chinatown, the Lower East Side, and the East Village all saw crime drop across the board. Overall, the Manhattan South area has seen rapes jump 30.8 percent so far this year; grand larceny is up 9.5 percent; felony assault is up 9.4 percent; burglary went up by 1 percent, car thefts fell 5.9 percent, robberies dropped 18.6 percent, and murders fell by 2 percent.</p>
