<p>There are lots of hoity-toity luxury buildings, especially in Manhattan, that ban dogs, probably because the building owners had miserable childhoods. Hovering just below those happiness-free condos are the weird in-between buildings that try to have their cake and eat it, usually via contradictory pet regulations. A new luxury building on the Upper West Side has become the latest to join that illustrious crowd.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150409161627/http://www.westsiderag.com/2014/08/28/dog-paws-banned-from-lobby-of-new-luxury-rental-building">West Side Rag reported</a> this week that Hawthorne Park, located at 160 West 62nd Street overlooking Lincoln Center, has banned dogs over 15 pounds from the premises&#x2014;but only for the stated reason that they don&apos;t want any puppies touching the ground of their precious marble lobby. Yes, the building has reportedly made it a rule that every dog has to be carried by its owner into the elevator.</p>

<p>&quot;They&#x2019;re concerned the dogs are going to urinate or pass stool, so I think that&#x2019;s their excuse,&quot; renter Joe Ventel <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150409161627/http://nypost.com/2014/08/31/luxury-building-bans-dogs-from-touching-lobbys-marble-floors/">told the Post</a> about the building, a 339-unit residency where one-bedrooms start at $5,000 a month. &quot;I thought it was silly. Usually the dogs are well-trained, especially the small dogs.&quot; The lease only specifies that a dog must be under 15 pounds&#x2014;but you will be yelled at if your Lily, Daisy or Fozzie dare fall prey to gravity. </p>

<p>Hawthorne Park isn&apos;t just particular about where and how a pet may touch its hallowed grounds&#x2014;they also apparently don&apos;t want residents&apos; plants urinating or passing stools. &quot;I had a plant in the hallway for two minutes and was told it was an obstruction,&quot; one non-dog-owning resident griped.</p>

<p>Anyway, even if you can micro-manage where a curious doggy puts its paws down, you can&apos;t control whether or not they <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150409161627/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2014/08/30/police-believe-dog-accidentally-started-lacey-township-fire/">turn on the stove and accidentally burn down the building.</a></p>
