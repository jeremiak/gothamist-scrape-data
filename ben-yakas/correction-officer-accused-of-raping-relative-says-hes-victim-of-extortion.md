<p>Yesterday, an off-duty correction officer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130826232755/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/14/off-duty_correction_officer_arreste.php">was arrested for allegedly raping</a> a woman at gunpoint in Brooklyn. Eddie Colon, 49, has been accused of raping his wife&apos;s 31-year-old relative in a Bed-Stuy building he owns and she lives in. The alleged rape occurred while one of the woman&apos;s four children was calling from another room. But Colon claims that this is all part of an extortion plot against him: &quot;The violence started after the consensual sexual relations when the [woman]tried to extort money,&quot; said defense lawyer Peter Troxler.</p>

<p>According <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130826232755/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/city-correction-officer-charged-rape-claims-sex-consensual-victim-extortion-plot-article-1.1427817">to the News</a>, Colon and his wife&apos;s relative had been intimate since she was 17, but their relationship ended last year. The woman claims that Colon held her at gunpoint last Sunday morning, covered her mouth when she attempted to scream for help, ripped off her clothing, and raped her.</p>

<p>Troxler admits the sexual encounter did occur, but he says the woman had renewed their relationship in a series of text messages over the last couple weeks. He also claims that one of the woman&apos;s children is Colon&apos;s, and she punched him in the face, requiring two staples.</p>

<p>Colon has been charged with rape, assault, criminal use of a firearm, unlawful imprisonment, menacing, and criminal obstruction of breathing in the incident.</p>
