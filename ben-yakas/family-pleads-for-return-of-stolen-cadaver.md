<p>The body of the mother of seven and grandmother of 21 was stolen a week ago from a mausoleum at St. Charles Cemetery in East Farmingdale; she had been buried there for more than 11 years. The family has offered a $30,000 reward, and police say they will throw in another $5,000 for any information about the crime. &quot;We solely want to put her at peace, as she wanted. The family has been devastated by this. I can&apos;t imagine that anyone would have to go through something like this, it&apos;s just mind boggling,&quot; said grandson Vincent Longo.</p>

<p>Suffolk County District Attorney Thomas Spota said the culprits could face up to four years in prison if convicted of desecrating a cemetery. He added that while cemetery vandalism is a somewhat common occurrence, the theft of a body is &quot;extremely rare.&quot;</p>
