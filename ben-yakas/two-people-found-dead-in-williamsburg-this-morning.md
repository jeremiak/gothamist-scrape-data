<p>A man was found dead in a stalled construction site in Williamsburg earlier this morning. According to police, the victim was found at South 5th Street between Driggs and Bedford Avenue around 8:30 a.m.&#x2014;the location was next to a spot where Rubulad parties used to take place. You can see photos of the scene above. Police initially have called it a &quot;possible homicide.&quot; We&apos;ll update as we learn more.</p>

<p>In a separate incident, another man <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429053737/https://twitter.com/NYScanner/status/216895554721030145">was found dead</a> hanging from a building also in Williamsburg. That victim was found at 95 South 10th Street, and was pronounced dead at the scene. No other information was available at this time, but we&apos;ll update once we learn more.</p>
