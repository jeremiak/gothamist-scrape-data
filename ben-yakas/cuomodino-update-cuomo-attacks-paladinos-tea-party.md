<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="92910cuomo.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20111106102024im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/92910cuomo.jpg" width="240" height="175" class="image-left"> </span>It seems that the more voters <strike>get to know</strike> pay attention to Carl Paladino, the less they like what they find: a new <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111106102024/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/09/29/2010-09-29_poll_this_guy_unfit_to_be_gov.html">Marist/Daily News poll</a> found that over 60 percent of voters find Paladino to be unelectable after being told of his antics, including his incessant rants, bestiality emails and nutty policies. &quot;<strong>People don&apos;t find this style to be attractive</strong>,&quot; Marist Poll director Lee Miringoff deadpaned. But just because people are actually noticing Paladino&apos;s nuttiness doesn&apos;t mean his gubernatorial opponent Andrew Cuomo is looking that much better. Jeez, are we all turning into <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111106102024/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/28/lazio_drops_out_doesnt_back_anyone.php">Rick Lazio&apos;s</a>?</p>

<p>After lots of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111106102024/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/26/cuomodino_update.php">criticism</a> for his &quot;Rose Garden&quot; campaign, Cuomo finally attacked Paladino and the Tea Party <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111106102024/http://www.leagle.com/unsecure/news.do?feed=yellowbrix&amp;storyid=150424658">head-on</a>: &quot;<strong>There&apos;s no place in New York for Tea Party politics...Carl Paladino&apos;s Tea Party...is a party that has extremist views</strong>,&quot; he said after a meeting with black leaders in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111106102024/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/27/barron_supporters_crash_cuomos_harl.php">Harlem</a> on Monday. This was a big about-face from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111106102024/http://albanysinsanity.wnymedia.net/blogs/2010/09/22/andrew-cuomo-claimed-yesterday-that-he-is-the-real-tea-party-candidate/">two weeks ago</a>, when he pledged solidarity with the frustration of Tea Party members: &#x201C;I&#x2019;ve been saying everything you just said from the beginning of this campaign,&#x201D; said Cuomo when asked about the Tea Party&#x2019;s message.</p>

<p>Cuomo also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111106102024/http://www.nydailynews.com/blogs/dailypolitics/2010/09/cuomovision-andrew-cuomo-hits.html">appeared for an interview</a> on <em>Good Day New York</em> Tuesday morning, where he talks about coming from the &quot;old school of work,&quot; criticized Paladino&apos;s &quot;extremist&quot; views, and reiterated that he will debate Paladino, but was reluctant to commit to any time or date for it.
