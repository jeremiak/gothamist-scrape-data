<p>Nothing gets the mercury boiling for parents like their innocent babies being exposed to hardcore pornography: a recent &quot;porno paintings&quot; exhibit in a Lower East Side gallery <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140410050749/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/preteen_sexxx_ed_outrage_OrGlFfj0xXdrsB8f4Xb3RM">is causing quite a stir</a> in the neighborhood. Because the last thing any responsible parent wants to be forced to do is explain bondage to their kids: &quot;I definitely disapprove of this being on display near my daughter&apos;s school. I don&apos;t want to have to be answering questions in reference to those dirty paintings. It sickens me that little kids could see that right there through those windows,&quot; said Elvin Almonte, whose five-year-old daughter attends neighboring PS 42. Well, five does seem a bit young for talking about threesomes.</p>

<p>The &quot;Porno Paintings&quot; exhibit, by artist <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140410050749/http://www.nicholasweber.com/">Nicholas Weber</a>, is visible to anyone walking by the Windows Gallery on Orchard Street, including the kids who go to PS 42 next door. Owner Dino Eli said that police have visited three times in the last two weeks because of complaints by the school and a nearby church. One PS 42 teacher said the principal did lodge a complaint &quot;but was told nothing could be done. It&apos;s horrible.&quot; Teacher William Garley was even more harsh in his critique: &quot;<strong>That&apos;s pretty disgusting. Our kids walk by there. Our children shouldn&apos;t see something like that.</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>The paintings depict threesomes, foot fetishists, and other hardcore scenes (see more <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140410050749/http://artefuse.com/2011/05/check-out-porno-paintings-by-nick-weber-at-orchard-windows-gallery/">here</a>) inspired by stills taken from the porn visuals, but Weber defended them, saying children are exposed to much worse: &quot;<strong>They&apos;re afraid it&apos;s going to corrupt the kids, when kids can watch people getting shot on TV</strong>,&quot; he said. He started making them because he &quot;was conflicted about how something that is bad could be beautiful. They are not photographs -- they take about six months to paint.&quot; </p>

<p>But some parents just don&apos;t think they should have to talk to their kids about the birds, the bees, and the guy sucking a woman&apos;s toes: &quot;That&apos;s not art; that&apos;s just porn. When little kids see that, they will ask questions. That shouldn&apos;t be out here,&quot; said Joanna Morillo. In that case, she better keep those kids away from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140410050749/http://gothamist.com/tags/ihaveprettyfeet">newspapers starring Rex Ryan</a> as well.</p>
