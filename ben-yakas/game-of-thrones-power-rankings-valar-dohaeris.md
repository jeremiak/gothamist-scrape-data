<p>After <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160628205932/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/29/who_is_still_alive_going_into_seaso.php">all the gif recaps</a> and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160628205932/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/28/game_of_thrones.php#photo-1">passionate interviews</a>, <em>Game Of Thrones</em> is back! In tonight&apos;s season premiere, we learned not to stare at giants too long, we met the much-talked-about Mance Rayder, and we discovered that scorpions can have human faces. Since the show is all about how people jockey for power, we&apos;ve decided to follow along this season with our <em>Game of Thrones</em> Power Rankings&#x2014;aka, who is <em>owning</em> this week.</p>

<p><strong><em>Game Of Thrones</em> Power Rankings, Week 1:</strong></p>

<p>1. <strong>Tywin Lannister</strong>: The new Hand of the King has seven kingdoms to keep track of, but he can always find time to be a mean old bastard to Tyrion. &quot;To teach me humility, the gods have condemned me to watch you waddle about wearing that proud Lion, which was my father&apos;s sigil and his father&apos;s sigil before that. But neither gods nor men will ever compel me to turn Casterly Rock into your whorehouse.&quot; </p>

<p>2. <strong>King Joffrey &quot;The Worst&quot; Baratheon</strong>: Clearly terrified and intrigued by his future wife, Margaery Tyrell. He&apos;s very powerful, but he&apos;s definitely the worst. </p>

<p>3. <strong>Robb Stark</strong>: The King in the North is dealing with his mommy issues, but he&apos;s happily married and successfully leading his army. If only he could fight someone...</p>

<p>4. <strong>Daenerys Targaryen</strong>: Her dragons are big enough now that they&apos;re eating giant fish, she survived an assassination attempt, and she&apos;s shopping for an army (The Unsullied), which is something you can just do, it seems. She&apos;s not very happy about this whole slavery thing, but she does have DRAGONS, so who cares. Dragons are cool. </p>

<p>5. <strong>Mance Rayder</strong>: The leader of the Wildings made his debut by gossiping about girls with Jon Snow. He&apos;s obviously very powerful, but the fact he seems to trust Jon Snow doesn&apos;t reflect very well on him.  </p>

<p>6. <strong>Margaery Tyrell</strong>: She&apos;s not scared of getting her blue dress ruined (&quot;I have others&quot;), she&apos;s into charity work, and she looks amazing no matter what she does. She&apos;s like a less prissy Kate Middleton for Westeros. Cersei should be nervous.</p>

<p>7. <strong>Cersei Lannister</strong>: With Tywin Lannister back in King&apos;s Landing and Margaery Tyrell angling for control of petulant, miserable Joffrey, Cersei doesn&apos;t have quite the same amount of oomph as she used to. But on the plus side, she can still make her little brother feel like shit!</p>

<p>8. <strong>Ser Bronn of the Blackwater</strong>: He&apos;s become a knight of the realm, got a pay raise from Tyrion, and best of all, had the first sex scene of the new season. Things are looking good for this sellsword.</p>

<p>9. <strong>Jon Snow</strong>: The Wildings are impressed he killed Quorin Halfhand, so he&apos;s got a bit of an edge to him right now. And no one told him he knows nothing this week! But is it so hard to maybe smile once in a while? </p>

<p>10. <strong>Stannis Baratheon</strong>: He&apos;s still the Lord of Light&apos;s special chosen one or whatever, but he definitely isn&apos;t getting laid, and it&apos;s showing.</p>

<p>11. <strong>Tyrion Lannister</strong>: Has lost a considerable amount of power since the battle of Blackwater, and is considerably glum about his facial scars and the fact his father doesn&apos;t love him (and his sister tried to kill him). At least he didn&apos;t lose his nose (or his wits). </p>

<p>12. <strong>Catelyn Stark</strong>: Well, she&apos;s locked up in a cell in Harrenhal because of her stupid decision to send Jamie Lannister with Brienne of Tarth to King&apos;s Landing. But she&apos;s still the mother of the King in the North. </p>

<p>13. <strong>Sansa Stark</strong>: She&apos;s vulnerable now that she&apos;s not betrothed to Joffrey, she has Littlefinger ogling her, and her only friend (handmaiden/Tyrion&apos;s lover) Shae refuses to play games with her. But um...at least no one has raped her yet!</p>

<p>14. <strong>Jorah Mormont</strong>: Smells like piss, according to the Unsullied master. Also, got kind of shown up by Ser Barristan Selmy.</p>

<p>15. <strong>Davos Seaworth</strong>: He survived the battle of Blackwater! But he&apos;s still stupidly loyal to humorless Stannis Baratheon, who is all about Melisandre. After calling her his &quot;enemy&quot; in front of Stannis, he traded being shipwrecked for a dungeon.</p>

<p><strong>The Viserys Targeryen Memorial Least Powerful Person Of The Week Award</strong>:<br>
<strong>Samwell Tarly</strong>: Well, he didn&apos;t die when he came face-to-face with a White Walker, so, that&apos;s a start. Then again, he didn&apos;t send the ravens, and that was his ONLY job. </p>

<p><strong>Not Applicable</strong>: We didn&apos;t have any time to catch up with Arya Stark, Bran Stark, Hodor, Jamie Lannister, Brienne of Tarth, Varys, The Hound, and Theon Greyjoy. But don&apos;t worry, because many of them and lots of new characters will be appearing next week. Until then, here&apos;s the theme song the way we always hear it.</p>
