According to reports, 52-year-old vendor Horace Coleman allegedly fired three to six shots around 1:30 p.m. Thursday in front of the Crown Diner at the corner of 161st Street and Gerard Avenue. The two victims&#x2014;60-year-old newspaper vendor Douglas Watkins and an unidentified 41-year-old&#x2014;were both hit in the abdomen. They are both listed in stable condition now.<p></p>

<p>Investigators <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407150859/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2012/08/23/suspect-arrested-after-shooting-near-yankee-stadium/">told CBS that</a> Coleman owns a water stand in the concourse area, and witnesses said Coleman was seen arguing with Watkins over the spot before the shooting. &quot;He turned around and shot the man in the newsstand, then he turned around and shot down the block, a couple of bullets,&quot; said witness Debbie Haughton. &quot;I don&#x2019;t know whether he hit somebody. They say he hit another person. Then he turned back, leaned over the man in the newsstand, and shot him again.&quot;</p>

<p>Local vendor Leroy McGrant <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407150859/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/bronx/vendor_gun_rage_8C9ZLIdmo2upOYnykJi5FN?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Bronx">told the Post</a> the shooting was caused by a turf war gone haywire: &#x201C;One guy wanted the spot, the other guy had it, and that was what the argument was about,&quot; he said. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s a simple argument that got out of hand. One guy just took it too far, and lots of people got hurt.&#x201D; Coleman, who previously served three years at the Clinton Correctional Facility upstate for a drugs arrest, has been taken into custody. His mother told the Post, &#x201C;He&#x2019;s just working hard, trying to make an honest living. He&#x2019;s been selling water every day for 10 years. He&#x2019;s got a family to take care of.&#x201D;</p>
