<p>A &quot;water condition&quot; at the 59th Street-Columbus Circle subway station in Manhattan caused extensive delays on eight separate subway lines during this morning&apos;s rush hour commute. But you likely already knew this, because you took those lemons and turned them into some <em>Lemonade</em> listening time.</p>

<p>According <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110093025/http://www.amny.com/transit/train-delays-caused-by-flooding-at-59th-street-columbus-circle-mta-says-1.12237624">to amNY</a>, the flooding was caused by a problem in a building on the street level just after 7 a.m. this morning. B train service was suspended, and the M line was partially suspended up until just after 10 a.m., but you already knew this because you were able to fit in three Transcendental Meditation technique sessions in one go.</p>

<p>There were also delays on the A and C lines, which gave you the perfect opportunity to apply a little Occam&apos;s Razor to real life situations, and also contemplate your mortality. Who doesn&apos;t love to mull that over!</p>

<p>There were other delays as well on the F, D, E and R lines, but that was awesome, because it gave you the chance to think creatively about solutions to these problems, which you are definitely going to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110093025/http://web.mta.info/faqs.htm">submit to the MTA</a> once your body temperature evens out a bit.</p>

<p>According to the MTA, train service on all those lines has resumed as of 10:20 a.m. &quot;with extensive residual delays.&quot; But that doesn&apos;t phase you, it could always be worse&#x2014;as long as you can see the rats from a distance, that means they aren&apos;t gnawing on your face! </p>
