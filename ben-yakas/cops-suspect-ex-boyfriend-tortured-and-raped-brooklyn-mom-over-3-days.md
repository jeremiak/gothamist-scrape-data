<p>According to a horrific report <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130510151620/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Brooklyn-Ex-Girlfriend-Tied-Up-Rape-Torture-Bed-Stuy-201455111.html">from NBC</a>, police are questioning a man about whether he tortured and raped a Brooklyn mom over three days this week. Sources tell them that the 29-year-old suspect went over to the Bed-Stuy apartment of the 29-year-old victim, who is his ex, on Monday. Then &quot;over the next three days, [he] tied her up, raped her, beat her, stabbed her, slashed her and shaved her head.&quot;</p>

<p>The victim, who has a 2-year-old daughter, was allegedly forced to call the suspect&apos;s mother on Wednesday night and tell her to come get the girl. Neighbors became suspicious when they saw the little girl waiting outside the apartment, and they called police, who discovered both the mother and the ex-boyfriend inside. Not much other information is known at this point, but we&apos;ll update when we learn more.</p>
