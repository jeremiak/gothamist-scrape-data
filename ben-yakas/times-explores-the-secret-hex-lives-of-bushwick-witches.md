<p>Last month, Newsweek <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429062736/http://mag.newsweek.com/2013/10/25/witches-brooklyn-williamsburg.html">had a revealing piece</a> about how millennials across the country are becoming more and more interested in witchcraft, using astrology and tarot &quot;as tools for combating existential angst.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429062736/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/17/nyregion/witches-dance-at-catland-occult-bookstore-in-bushwick.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;_r=1&amp;">The Times followed up</a> that story today by delving into Bushwick witches, centering around the Catland occult bookstore. &#x201C;There&#x2019;s been a magical revival happening in New York City for two to three years,&#x201D; said Damon Stang, the shop&apos;s resident tarot card reader. &#x201C;I think it&#x2019;s a nostalgia that people have for a sense of enchantment with the world.&#x201D;</p>

<p>The store&apos;s three owners, Philip English, 28, Joe Petersen, 25, and Fred Jennings, 28, opened the shop in February in a former plumbing store on Flushing Avenue. &#x201C;There are a lot of practitioners here who came out of the woodwork because this place acted as a beacon,&#x201D; said 25-year-old Sofia Boothman, a photographer from Bedford-Stuyvesant. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s got a darker vibe, a little more intellectual.&#x201D; </p>

<p>Not that it&apos;s all been positive: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429062736/http://www.brooklynpaper.com/stories/36/13/dtg_occultbookstore_2013_03_29_bk.html">an article in Brooklyn Paper</a> about the store&apos;s opening inspired many commenters to label the store another piece of &quot;yupster/hipster sewage,&quot; another sign of mass gentrification. The owners were offended at the hipster charge: &#x201C;It used to be that with witchcraft and the occult, the anger was directed toward perceived diabolism,&#x201D; English said in response. &#x201C;And now it&#x2019;s directed at the idea of hipsterdom or gentrification. I have trouble making the connection. <strong>If you&#x2019;re going to hate us, hate us for the traditional reason to hate us. Call us witches, not hipsters.</strong>&#x201D;</p>
