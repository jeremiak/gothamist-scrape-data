<p>New Year&apos;s Eve celebrating continued into the early hours of Wednesday for one U.S. Marine who allegedly led cops on a car<em> and</em> foot chase in Brooklyn. Christian Rodriguez, 26, has been charged with a DWI after he drunkenly drove through Brooklyn Army Terminal and onto the LIRR tracks. &quot;He was really bombed,&quot; a law-enforcement source <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427145415/http://nypost.com/2014/01/01/drunk-marine-sends-cops-on-car-foot-chase/">told the Post</a>. &quot;He was very nice, very respectful,&quot; they added.</p>

<p>The Post reports that Rodriguez, who lives on Staten Island, was driving his Dodge Charger toward the Verrazano Bridge when he made a right turn off Second Avenue too early, driving through the terminal gate at 63rd Street and &quot;busting the security arm en route to what he thought was the parkway on ramp.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;You can see his tire tracks,&quot; a law enforcement source <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427145415/http://nypost.com/2014/01/01/terror-scare-after-drunk-marine-drives-onto-lirr-tracks/">told them</a>, adding that cops were on full alert for possible terror attacks. &quot;The driver got in down by the water. He was driving on the shoulder all the way until he got to these two pipes sticking up. That blocked him. Then he tried to drive up onto the tracks to get around and got hung up on the rail.&quot;</p>

<p>His car got stuck on a rail bed shared by an LIRR freight line and the N train. He then abandoned the car with the keys in and the motor still running&#x2014;at this point, cops were in pursuit, and concerned about possible terrorist activities, which proved unwarranted. They finally arrested him in a tunnel that runs under Shore Road. Thankfully the pursuit ended without any dancing, which could have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427145415/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCXs4rv-38w">made things much messier</a>. </p>
