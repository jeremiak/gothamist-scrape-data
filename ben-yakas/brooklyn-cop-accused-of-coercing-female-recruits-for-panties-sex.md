If only Lantigua had known that there&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420054155/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/15/panty_profiteer_spills_secrets_of_t.php">a whole vibrant thong trade</a> that can cater to his needs without resorting to crime.<p></p>

<p>Along with the panties, Lantingua allegedly demanded $1,000 and sex whenever he wanted it from the woman, who reported him after their meeting. Officers then found three more pairs of panties inside Lantingua&apos;s locker at the Brooklyn North Task Force. Lantingua, who worked in applicant processing for the NYPD, has been charged with receiving a bribe, official misconduct and coercion.</p>
