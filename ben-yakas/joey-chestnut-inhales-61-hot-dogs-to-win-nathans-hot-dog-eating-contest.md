title: Joey Chestnut Inhales 61 Hot Dogs To Win Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest
---

	
										<p>America&apos;s hero Joey Chestnut EIGHTpeated as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150706205534/http://gothamist.com/tags/nathanshotdogeatingcontest">Nathan&apos;s Hot Dog Eating Champion</a> today in Coney Island. Chestnut, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150706205534/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/04/hot_dog_eating_contest_winner.php#photo-1">who was once again</a> carried into the rainy arena on a Nathan&apos;s-emblazoned throne, ended up devouring 61 hot dogs in 10 minutes, and faced stiff competition from Matt Stonie (who ate 56) and Tim &quot;Eater X&quot; Janus (44). In the words of one of the eager ESPN commentators, it was &quot;the greatest achievement in the history of man.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I knew he was close, this kid is fast,&quot; Chestnut said after he was declared the winner. &quot;The hot dogs were slow, the weather slowed everything down, I could never find my rhythm, so it was a dog fight the entire time.&quot; Chestnut retained his Mustard Belt for the eighth straight year, but things were not so smooth on the women&apos;s side: three-time defending champion Sonya &quot;Black Widow&quot; Thomas lost to 28-year-old Miki Sudo. Thomas ate 27 3/4 hot dogs and buns, while Sudo knocked back 34. </p>

<p>In case you weren&apos;t watching the live broadcast on ESPN, take a gander at a few select screenshots of the patriotic proceedings below.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: Maybe Chestnut wasn&apos;t slowed down by the weather&#x2014;maybe he was slowed down by <em>love</em>. Before the event, Chestnut proposed to his girlfriend of three years, Neslie Ricasa, on camera. </p>
