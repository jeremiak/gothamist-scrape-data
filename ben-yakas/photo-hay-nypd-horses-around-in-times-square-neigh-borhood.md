<p>It&apos;s a little overcast today, but that hasn&apos;t stopped New Yorkers from cutting loose on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131206015746/http://gothamist.com/tags/halloween">Halloween</a> (well, everyone except <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131206015746/http://instagram.com/p/gJKLm-qA3G/">Amare &quot;Wet Blanket&quot; Stoudemire</a>). Even the boys in blue got into the spirit today, as seen in the photo above, taken in Times Square around 10 a.m. this morning. Maybe this NYPD officer is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131206015746/http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/horse-head-mask">meme-savvy</a>, maybe it&apos;s very elaborate <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131206015746/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/14/creepy_horse_head_subway_video_is_p.php">viral marketing</a>, or maybe the officer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131206015746/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZtyvlzVm7Y">just wouldn&apos;t give Johnny Fontane a part</a> in his new movie.<br>
