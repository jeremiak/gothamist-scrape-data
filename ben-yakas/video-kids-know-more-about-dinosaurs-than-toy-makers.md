<p>We already know that kids are serious about their dinosaurs&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120504035348/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/21/worlds_youngest_art_critic_upset_ab.php">our favorite MoMA critic</a> reminded us of that fact last year. So it doesn&apos;t come as that big a surprise kids would know more about Triceratops&apos; and Styracosaurus&apos; than toy makers would&#x2014;but who knew they could give such brutal critiques!

If you don&apos;t mind your kids knowing about evolution, we suggest you take them to learn more from people who know even more about dinos than passionate children, and check out the American Museum of Natural History&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120504035348/http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/permanent/fossils/sauris.html">permanent dinosaur collection</a> (unfortunately, their fantastic <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120504035348/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/14/photos_worlds_largest_dinosaurs_now.php#photo-1">World&#x2019;s Largest Dinosaurs exhibit just ended</a>).
