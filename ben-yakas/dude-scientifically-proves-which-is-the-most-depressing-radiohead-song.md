<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170516201147/http://gothamist.com/tags/radiohead">Radiohead</a> have always had a special gift for making glitchy sad bastard music sound warm, inviting, and irresistibly catchy. But no matter how much you love to dance to &quot;Idioteque&quot; or rock out to &quot;2+2=5,&quot; Radiohead&apos;s speciality, as far as most are concerned, lies in their ability to mine the depths of melancholy and find emotional resonance. (Or maybe I&apos;m just a huge fanboy and it&apos;s really just one-dimensional music for moody people, shut up you&apos;re not my mom.)</p>

<p>Nevertheless! If we can accept the premise that Radiohead specialize in turning depression into aural pleasure, the question remains: which song is the <em>most</em> depressing Radiohead song? Thankfully, data scientist and Radiohead-head Charlie Thompson decided to find out using only the most scientific methods available.</p>

<p>You can read all about his project in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170516201147/http://rcharlie.com/2017-02-16-fitteR-happieR/#analysis">tremendous detail on his site here.</a> The basics are: he used Spotify to measure a song&apos;s valence (a measure from 0.0 to 1.0 describing the musical positiveness conveyed by a track, with high valence meaning joy and low meaning sadness), then used Genius and other programs to pull apart how sad the lyrics are, which he then turned into an overall &quot;gloom index.&quot; </p>

<p>You can peruse the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170516201147/http://rcharlie.com/htmlwidgets/fitterhappier/album_chart.html">gloom index (aka &quot;Data Driven Depression&quot;) here</a>, but the winner was the closing track of their last album, the long-awaited &quot;True Love Waits&quot;! It was followed closely by the likes of &quot;Motion Picture Soundtrack,&quot; &quot;Give Up The Ghost,&quot; &quot;High and Dry,&quot; &quot;Let Down,&quot; &quot;Exit Music,&quot; &quot;Pyramid Song,&quot; &quot;Dollars and Cents,&quot; &quot;We Suck Young Blood,&quot; &quot;Videotape&quot; and &quot;Tinker Tailer Soldier Sailor Rich Man Poor Man Beggar Man Thief.&quot; He writes of the conclusions:</p>

<blockquote>Of all nine studio albums, Radiohead&#x2019;s latest release, &#x201C;A Moon Shaped Pool,&#x201D; boasts the lowest average gloom index. This is driven largely by the fact that its finale, &#x201C;True Love Waits,&#x201D; was the gloomiest song overall. It&#x2019;s also apparent that &#x201C;A Moon Shaped Pool&#x201D; broke a trend of relatively less depressing albums since 2003&#x2019;s &#x201C;Hail to the Thief.&#x201D;</blockquote>

<p>In case you were wondering, he found that the &quot;happiest&quot; Radiohead songs are &quot;15 Step,&quot; &quot;Feral&quot; (whose lyrics are less words and more fun mouth sounds), &quot;Bodysnatchers,&quot; &quot;Jigsaw Falling Into Place,&quot; &quot;Go To Sleep,&quot; &quot;Pakt Like Sardines In A Crushed Tin Can,&quot; and &quot;Airbag.&quot; Hey, if singing an ode to surviving a car crash isn&apos;t joyous, I don&apos;t know what is.</p>
