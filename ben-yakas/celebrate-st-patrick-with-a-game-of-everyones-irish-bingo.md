<p>We&apos;ve already given lots of advice about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130510154948/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/15/map_how_to_avoid_the_st_paddys_day.php">how to avoid</a> the 252nd Annual New York City <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130510154948/http://gothamist.com/tags/stpatricksday">Saint Patrick&apos;s Day Parade</a>, and sent out a PSA about why you should <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130510154948/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/15/st_patricks_video_psa_reasons_not_t.php">tread carefully around mass transit this weekend.</a> But now that the actual day is here and it&apos;s snowing outside (seriously, WTF is up with that?), all we want to do is get into the spirit of the day. And nothing gets us more into the St. Patty&apos;s mood than a game of &quot;Everybody&apos;s Irish&quot; Bingo!</p>

<p>Inspired by a similar game <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130510154948/http://chicagoist.com/2011/03/17/play_everyones_irish_bingo.php">made by Chicagoist</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130510154948/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/17/celebrate_st_patrick_with_a_game_of.php">&quot;Everyone&apos;s Irish Bingo&quot;</a> is the perfect way to celebrate St. Patrick&apos;s Day without having to participate in any drunken debauchery&#x2014;because there is no finer day of the year for people from all walks of life to imbibe a bit too much and frolic in the streets (okay, except for SantaCon). </p>

<p>If you do decide to stalk the streets of Manhattan for any signs of green today (Green snow? Green puke? Green puke upon green snow?), do send any photos of St. Patrick&apos;s Day revelry to tips@gothamist.com or tag them &quot;gothamist&quot; on Flickr!</p>
