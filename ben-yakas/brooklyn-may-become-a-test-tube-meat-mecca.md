<p>Last month, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140130050534/http://gothamist.com/2013/12/04/humans_eating_more_meat.php">it was reported that</a> human beings are eating more <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140130050534/http://gothamist.com/tags/meat">meat</a> than ever. It ain&apos;t easy keeping up with that kind of demand&#x2014;but thankfully, Big Science has been hard at work coming up with a possible solution. A biotech firm is working on growing edible meat in test tubes, and they want to make Brooklyn their headquarters.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140130050534/http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20140126/TECHNOLOGY/301269971/biotech-firm-targets-city-for-shmeat-market">According to Crain&apos;s</a>, tissue-engineering company <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140130050534/http://modernmeadow.com/">Modern Meadow</a> is in negotiations to lease up to 10,000 square feet at the BioBAT facility at the Brooklyn Army Terminal. Initially, the company hopes to grow &quot;genuine leather without having to kill animals or wreck the environment,&quot; generated by harmless biopsies of living animals. </p>

<p>While the company is already in talks with fashion and textile producers about their products, Modern Meadow is also excited about working on creating in-vitro meat. Chief Executive Andras Forgacs thinks the company will begin offering &quot;tastings&quot; in a few years, and will work with chefs to introduce the company&apos;s products as a &apos;delicacy.&apos;</p>

<p>Scientists have already proven that meat <em>can</em> be grown in a test tube (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140130050534/http://www.npr.org/2011/05/18/136402034/burgers-from-a-lab-the-world-of-in-vitro-meat">here&apos;s an in-depth article</a> from NPR about it), but as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140130050534/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/16/meat_from_a_petri_dish_its_really_h.php">of two years ago</a>, they were still trying to figure out if such a thing is commercially feasible. Forgacs obviously believes in it; he&apos;s even hoping to turn the company&apos;s offices into &quot;a leather and meat brewery&quot; that would be the antithesis of a slaughterhouse, educating people about the in-vitro process.</p>

<p>Considering <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140130050534/http://awellfedworld.org/issues/animalprotection">the fact that</a> 10 billion animals are killed per year in the US, and factory farming of livestock <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140130050534/http://www.fao.org/docrep/010/a0701e/a0701e00.HTM">produces 18% of global greenhouse-gas emissions</a>, investing in test tube meat seems like a good idea. And anyway, at this point anything would be better than <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140130050534/http://gothamist.com/tags/pinkslime">pink slimeburgers.</a></p>
