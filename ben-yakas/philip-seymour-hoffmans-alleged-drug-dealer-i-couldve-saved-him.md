<p>In the wake of actor <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406142442/http://gothamist.com/tags/philipseymourhoffman">Philip Seymour Hoffman&apos;s</a> apparent overdose, four suspected heroin dealers were arrested in Manhattan this week. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406142442/http://gothamist.com/2014/02/05/hoffman_heroin_arrests.php">Among them was</a> Robert Vineberg, 57, a jazz musician and admitted heroin user who is currently incarcerated on Rikers. Vineberg <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406142442/http://nypost.com/2014/02/09/hoffmans-accused-dealer-i-couldve-saved-him/">spoke to the Post</a> from there, calling Hoffman his friend and saying he was &quot;devastated&quot; by his death: &quot;I could&#x2019;ve saved him,&quot; Vineberg said. &quot;If I knew he was in town, I would&#x2019;ve said, &apos;Hey, let&#x2019;s make an AA meeting.&apos; If I was with him, it wouldn&#x2019;t have happened. Not under my guard.&quot;</p>

<p>Vineberg, who says he&apos;s known Hoffman for about a year, denied that he sold Hoffman any of the heroin packets that were found in his apartment, although he declined to say whether he ever sold to him in the past. &quot;When we got together, we talked about books. And art. He was a normal guy. You wouldn&#x2019;t know he was an Oscar winner,&quot; he said. &quot;He loved his kids. I offer my condolences to his family.&quot;</p>

<p>Vineberg said he and Hoffman supported each other in their struggles over drug use. &quot;We&#x2019;d text back and forth, &apos;Oh, I got one day on you!&apos; &apos;No I&#x2019;ve got one day on you,&apos;&#x2009;&quot; Vineberg recalled. The last time Vineberg saw him in person in October, he claims Hoffman was high. &quot;When you&#x2019;re clean for that long of a time, your body can&#x2019;t take as much,&#x201D; he said. &quot;Your body doesn&#x2019;t have the tolerance. He was using needles. He was a hard-core addict.&quot;</p>

<p>Hoffman&apos;s death has resonated throughout the AA community in NYC: &quot;I&#x2019;ve been to three meetings since it happened,&quot; a woman named Rita <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406142442/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/09/fashion/Philip-Seymour-Hoffman-AA-addiction-recovery.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;_r=0">told the Times</a>. &quot;There hasn&#x2019;t been one meeting where I haven&#x2019;t heard about it. People in the public eye see it as &apos;We lost a great talent.&apos; People in recovery see it as &apos;We lost a brother in arms.&apos; &quot;</p>

<p>Along with Vineberg, Thomas Kushman, 48, Max Rosenblum, 22, and Juliana Luchkiw, 22, have all been charged with felony drug possession.</p>
