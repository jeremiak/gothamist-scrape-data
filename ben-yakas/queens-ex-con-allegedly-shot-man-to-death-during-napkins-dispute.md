<p>A Queens man has been accused of killing a man after the two got into a bar argument over napkins. Police say the incident was sparked when Fruitquana Hawkins, 33, reached over for a napkin from victim Timothy Tripp&apos;s table at the Edge Bar and Lounge in Jamaica, Queens around 2:30 a.m. on June 14th. Tripp, 35, picked up a wad of napkins and threw them at Hawkins in response: &quot;He said something to the effect of &apos;Get your own napkins,&apos;&quot; a source <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140810020504/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/man-facing-murder-rap-fight-napkins-turned-fatal-article-1.1895685#dfvphoksOzumqk7i.97">told the News.</a></p>

<p>Hawkins then allegedly pulled out a gun and started firing, fatally striking Tripp in the head and chest. Hawkins, who had three prior arrests, had just been let out of prison about a month before the shooting; cops eventually caught up to him after he fled to Georgia, and was brought back to NYC yesterday to face charges.</p>

<p>Tripp owned a clothing store in Queens and was a youth football coach; he is survived by an 11-year-old daughter. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140810020504/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20140807/jamaica/queens-man-charged-with-killing-football-coach-fight-over-napkin">Hawkins been charged</a> with murder, criminal use of a firearm, criminal possession of a weapon and reckless endangerment. </p>
