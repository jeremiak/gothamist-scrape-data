<p>Police say the incident happened just before 10:20 a.m. on a northbound D train. The unnamed male victim was slashed across the face by another straphanger aboard the train while it was in the station at 42nd Street and 6th Avenue. The victim was taken to Bellevue Hospital in an unknown condition. </p>

<p>It&apos;s unclear what preceded the attack. The suspect, whom cops described as a heavyset man, fled the scene after the incident. The investigation is still ongoing. We&apos;ll update as we know more.<br>
