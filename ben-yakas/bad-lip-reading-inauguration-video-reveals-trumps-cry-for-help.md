<p>Watching Donald Trump&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170919005001/http://dcist.com/2017/01/donald_trump_inauguration_live.php#photo-1">inauguration ceremony</a> last week felt like you had stepped through a doorway to another dimension where Paddington Bear is a fashion icon and Jon Voight can gaily dance in the rain. So the Bad Lip Reading version of the inauguration is only slightly more surreal&#x2014;but at least it&apos;s much, much funnier. </p>

<p>They really get the Trump/Pence relationship (&quot;Thank you my prince&quot;) and George W. Bush&apos;s innate goofiness. And this oath of office makes a lot more sense in context: &quot;I gotta get a grip, you saw me squat...you think I won&apos;t fling three eggs at you?...the goldfish of pre-teens never had a chance...I personally have puked in a cage fight...then I chewed an awful lot of cheese...and I stored it in my gut.&quot; Watch below as Trump promises to build a bar in rural Connecticut called &quot;Brown Lady.&quot;</p>
