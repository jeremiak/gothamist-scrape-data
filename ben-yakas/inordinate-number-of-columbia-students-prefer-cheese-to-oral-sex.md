<p>Columbia University&apos;s Bwog has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426151543/http://bwog.com/2013/04/20/we-want-your-wisdom/">an end-of-the-year tradition</a> of asking outgoing seniors to share the knowledge and advice they&#x2019;ve collected from Columbia over their past four years <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426151543/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/04/columbia_fraternitys_pledge_scaveng.php">of poonspeeding.</a> For whatever reason, the most beloved question from their survey concerns whether students prefer oral sex or cheese. This year, one pasteurization aficionado took it upon him/herself <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426151543/http://bwog.com/2013/04/24/oral-sex-or-cheese-the-truth-revealed/">to compile a statistical survey</a> centered around that question. And the person came to the admittedly &quot;unscientific&quot; conclusion that <strong>&quot;58% of seniors overall, then, would seem to prefer cheese to oral sex.&quot;</strong></p>

<p>The study was conducted by reviewing 222 Bwog interviews dating from 2006 to 2012&#x2014;the person found that &quot;a fromage-centric attitude prevailed through the sample.&quot; That only represented 15% of the class, so you never know whether the rest of the class has been swayed by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426151543/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/18/anti-cheese_lobby_unveils_fat_new_a.php">anti-cheese hate groups.</a> You can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426151543/http://bwog.com/2013/04/24/oral-sex-or-cheese-the-truth-revealed/">peruse the whole report here</a>, which Bwog presumes &quot;was actually submitted somewhere at Columbia for a grade.&quot; </p>

<p>And before you hit send on that comment about how this is a pretty silly thing to spend any effort thinking about, is the question really any more absurd than the fact you&apos;re reading this instead of going outside to frolic on a beautiful spring Saturday? Checkmate. Feel free to submit all cheese-related puns, of course.</p>
