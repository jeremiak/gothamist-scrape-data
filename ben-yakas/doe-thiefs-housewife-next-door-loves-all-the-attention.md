<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:230px; "> <img alt="43011cougar.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110501214043im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/43011cougar.jpg" width="230" height="287"> <br> <i>Aspiring reality star Laura Lanham</i></div> This week, Department of Education computer consultant Willard &quot;Ross&quot; Lanham <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110501214043/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/28/doe_contracter_charged_with_stealin.php">was accused</a> of stealing $3.6 million in kickbacks. But the story took a turn for the Bravo when Lanham&apos;s weird relationship with his live-in estranged wife, Laura Lanham, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110501214043/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/29/doe_thief_stole_millions_for_his_co.php">took center stage</a>. And Lanham is perfectly alright with her cougarlife hogging the spotlight: &quot;<strong>My life is already a reality show</strong>...You can&apos;t make this s--- up. My reality is surreal. It&apos;s crazy,&quot; she told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110501214043/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2011/04/29/2011-04-29_sexy_cougar_laura_lanham_wont_talk_about_hubbys_alleged_scam_but_says_she_could_.html">the News</a>.<p></p>

<p>Lanham, who has a 14-year-old daughter and two 20-something stepsons, is extremely proud and forthcoming about her desires: she blogged extensively about her dating life at Cougar Life Diaries, and in 2008, she and her friends created their own mid-life crisis website, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110501214043/http://thehousewivesnextdoor.com/">The Housewives Next Door</a>. &quot;I&apos;m a very attention-hungry girl, and I stopped everything at 22 when I got married...I&apos;m doing what I want to do now,&quot; she <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110501214043/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/li_cougar_on_loose_8sItKA7NJXvLGJcYBumddL?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">told the Post.</a> </p>

<p>She and her husband still live together in their home on Laura Lane, a street he built (with stolen money) and named after her; but they have separate bedrooms, and she doesn&apos;t let their arrangement stand in the way of her social life, including sending nude photos to Playboy and (implicitly) banging &apos;cubs&apos; in white stretch limos. &quot;I&apos;m proud of myself. I&apos;m 42 and I&apos;m in great shape. I&apos;m one of those people--strut your stuff if you have it,&quot; she said.</p>

<p>Of course, there&apos;s that small matter of her children, particularly her daughter who is justifiably mortified of her frisky mom: &quot;[My daughter] has a problem with it. She loves that her mom has cool shoes and loves to dance, but she doesn&apos;t like the other side&#x2014;where her friends are looking at me and think that I&apos;m hot,&quot; she said. And here&apos;s our favorite part: the Post&apos;s &quot;sources&quot; said one of her sons had to endure his friends&apos; bets over which one of them would bed her first. Watch out kids: who knows if the Post has sources among YOUR friends!</p>
