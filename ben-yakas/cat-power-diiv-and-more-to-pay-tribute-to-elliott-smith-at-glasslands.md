<p>It&apos;s been 10 years since singer/songwriter Elliott Smith died from two stab wounds to the chest. To mark the occasion, Glasslands <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502140029/http://www.theglasslands.com/event/385863-elliott-smith-tribute-show-brooklyn/">will host a tribute to Smith</a> featuring the likes of Cat Power, Zachary Cole Smith (DIIV) with Sky Ferreira, Yoni Wolf (WHY?), The Low Anthem, Marissa Nadler and more. And it promises to be way better than <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502140029/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/25/video_madonna_covers_elliott_smith.php">whatever the hell Madonna did with her Smith tribute last week.</a></p>

<p>The show, which will be held on Monday October 21st at Williamsburg&apos;s Glasslands, also includes Luke Temple (Here We Go Magic), Aaron Pfenning (Chairlift / Rewards), Speedy Ortiz&apos;s Sadie Dupuis, Adam Schatz (of Landlady / Man Man / Father Figures), The Perennials, and Tereu Tereu.</p>

Even if you can&apos;t get (or afford) a ticket to the event, you can still donate to Outside In, a Portland-based group helping homeless young people, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502140029/http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/an-elliott-smith-tribute-show">via the Indiegogo page.</a></p>
