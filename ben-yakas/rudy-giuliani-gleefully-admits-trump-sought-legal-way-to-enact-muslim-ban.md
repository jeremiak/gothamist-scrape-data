<p>Donald Trump has been pretty grumpy that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170613135822/http://gothamist.com/2017/01/28/refugees_detained_trump_executive_order.php">his executive order</a> barring immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries has been accurately called a &quot;Muslim ban.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170613135822/http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/1/29/14432362/trump-muslim-ban-statement">He&apos;s so mad!</a> But maybe he should direct some of his anger at his own Minister Of Cybering <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170613135822/http://gothamist.com/tags/rudygiuliani">Rudy Giuliani</a>, who gleefully let the Muslim ban cat slip out of the racist bag this weekend during an interview with Jeanine Pirro on Fox News.</p>

<p>Here&apos;s the most important part:</p>

<blockquote>I&#x2019;ll tell you the whole history of it: When he first announced it, he said &#x2018;Muslim ban.&#x2019; He called me up, he said, &#x2018;Put a commission together, show me the right way to do it legally.&apos; I put a commission together with Judge Mukasey, with Congressman McCaul, Pete King, a whole group of other very expert lawyers on this. And what we did was we focused on, instead of religion, danger. The areas of the world that create danger for us, which is a factual basis, not a religious basis. Perfectly legal, perfectly sensible, and that&#x2019;s what the ban is based on.</blockquote>

<p>Guliani went on to say that despite admitting a moment earlier that Trump was just looking for a loophole to enact his dream of a Muslim ban (and lord knows Trump <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170613135822/https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/01/us/politics/donald-trump-tax.html">loves his loopholes</a>), the ban is based on &quot;places where there are substantial evidence that people are sending terrorists into our country.&quot; Of course, that has already been proven to be entirely incorrect: &quot;No Muslim extremist from any of these places has carried out a fatal attack in the U.S. in more than two decades,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170613135822/http://www.npr.org/2017/01/28/511996783/how-does-trumps-immigration-freeze-square-with-his-business-interests">NPR noted.</a> The Trump administration has also cited a 2015 Obama administration bill which selected the countries cited in the ban&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170613135822/http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/giuliani-says-trump-order-was-legal-way-to-enact-muslim-ban.html?mid=full-rss-di">NY Magazine posits</a> that at the time, that bill &quot;was largely seen as a measure of security theater, following recent terrorist attacks both in the U.S. and around the world.&quot; (This facile claim was also thoroughly debunked <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170613135822/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2017/01/29/trumps-facile-claim-that-his-refugee-policy-is-similar-to-obama-in-2011/?utm_term=.c7948863a0c4">by The Washington Post.</a>)</p>

<p>Let&apos;s see if Mike Pence has any comment for us on this:</p>

<p>If you look over the venn diagram of Muslim nations banned (Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen) and ones not banned, you may notice that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170613135822/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/29/opinion/who-hasnt-trump-banned-people-from-places-where-hes-made-money.html">Trump has business interests in all those countries</a> not affected by the ban. Even though the 19 terrorists in the September 11th attacks were from Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Lebanon and the United Arab Emirates. </p>

<p>&quot;He has significant commercial interests in Turkey and Azerbaijan, is developing properties in Indonesia and Dubai, and has formed companies in Egypt and Saudi Arabia,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170613135822/http://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2017/01/27/511861645/trumps-immigration-freeze-omits-those-linked-to-deadly-attacks-in-u-s">Greg Myre wrote</a>. &quot;His daughter Ivanka said in 2015 that the company was looking at &apos;multiple opportunities in Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Qatar, Saudi Arabia &#x2014; the four areas where we are seeing the most interest.&apos;&quot;</p>

<p>World leaders have largely <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170613135822/http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/30/politics/trump-travel-ban-world-reaction/">lambasted the ban,</a> although the Muslim-majority nations not on the blacklist have remained largely silent. Several Democrats and a handful of Republicans have also taken a stand against the order, including <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170613135822/http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/29/politics/trump-travel-ban-congress-reaction/">John McCain and Lindsey Graham</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170613135822/http://www.politico.com/story/2017/01/trump-mccain-graham-234342">whom Trump then called</a> &quot;weak on immigration&quot; and &quot;looking to start World War III.&quot;</p>

<p>Trump issued a statement yesterday insisting &quot;this is not a Muslim ban, as the media is falsely reporting. This is not about religion &#x2014; this is about terror and keeping our country safe.&quot; </p>

<p>Jake Tapper had some good advice to Trump on staying on message, tweeting. &quot;If @POTUS doesn&apos;t like people saying &quot;Muslim ban&quot; about this Exec Order he should talk to this guy&quot;:</p>

<p>Hey, has Mike Pence weighed in on the ban yet?</p>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Calls to ban Muslims from entering the U.S. are offensive and unconstitutional.</p>&#x2014; Governor Mike Pence (@GovPenceIN) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170613135822/https://twitter.com/GovPenceIN/status/674249808610066433">December 8, 2015</a></blockquote>

<p>In an attempt to clear up any confusion&#x2014;hahahaha, let&apos;s be real&#x2014;in an attempt to distance himself from the widely-panned decision, Congressman Peter King backed off his involvement with it during an interview <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170613135822/http://www.mediaite.com/online/peter-king-clarifies-his-involvement-in-muslim-ban-talks-rudy-is-confusing-two-different-meetings/">with Joe Piscopo on AM 970 The Answer</a>. While he stated at one point that he &quot;fully supports&quot; the executive order, he doesn&apos;t necessarily want his name being historically attached the the order, so he blamed any confusion on Guiliani&apos;s faltering memory: &quot;Rudy is actually confusing two different meetings,&#x201D; he said. &quot;I was at the first meeting that we had with Donald Trump, Rudy&#x2026; and several others. That was in August. And that was focused primarily on domestic security, about surveillance, issues like that. Then there was another meeting October which I was not at; McCaul was on television Friday and we said that he had a meeting with Rudy Giuliani in October and that&#x2019;s when they discussed the executive order.&quot;</p>

<p>As some have noted, the Muslim ban is swiftly turning into a natural evolution of Trump&apos;s paranoia, an attempt to weed out all enemies and dissenters to Trump&apos;s agenda. Check out this thread: </p>
