<p>A man is dead after jumping off a hotel in the middle of Times Square. According to FDNY, the incident happened just before 7:30 a.m. Saturday morning; they say the 37-year-old man jumped off the W New York Times Square Hotel on Broadway near 47th Street.</p>

<p>FDNY add that they initially responded to a call for a cardiac arrest, then confirmed the man had jumped. Police say that the incident is still under investigation. A spokesman for the hotel <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140410041048/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2570920/Person-falls-death-luxury-hotel-New-Yorks-Times-Square.html">told the Daily Mail</a> they were aware of the incident and are cooperating with the investigation. We&apos;ll update with any new information as it comes.</p>

<p><em>If someone you know exhibits warning signs of suicide: do not leave the person alone, remove any firearms, alcohol, drugs or sharp objects that could be used in a suicide attempt, and call the U.S. National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 800-273-TALK (8255) or take the person to an emergency room or seek help from a medical or mental health professional.</em></p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: Police now say the Brooklyn man was spotted by on the roof of the Lunt Fontanne Theatre by someone working out at the hotel&#x2019;s 10th floor gym (which overlooks that roof) this morning. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140410041048/http://nypost.com/2014/03/01/body-of-man-who-jumped-to-death-in-times-square-goes-unnoticed-for-12-hours/">The Post reports</a> that cops aren&apos;t sure when the man jumped, but they seem to believe he jumped from the hotel onto the roof sometime last night and wasn&apos;t found until this morning. &quot;Everybody heard a thump. They thought it was an explosion. It shook the chandelier,&quot; a worker at the theater, where <em>Motown The Musical</em> is currently playing, told them.</p>
