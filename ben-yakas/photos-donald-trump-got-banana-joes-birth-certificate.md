	<p>Snuck <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130326202631/https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump">between tweets</a> about Egypt destroying its civil society with the Muslim Brotherhood and paens to the Tea Party, the world&apos;s foremost combover expert <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130326202631/http://gothamist.com/tags/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> let it known that he was in the company of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130326202631/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/13/photos_banana_joe_the_affenpinscher.php#photo-1">one Banana Joe</a>, the funny-faced affenpinscher who won Best In Show at this year&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130326202631/http://gothamist.com/tags/westminsterdogshow">Westminster Kennel Club</a>. And judging by the photos, they got along &quot;swimmingly&quot;&#x2014;but it brings up so many questions for us: have we lost respect for Banana Joe? Is Trump riding Banana Joe&apos;s <strike>coattails</strike> tail for some easy good will? Did Trump subject Joe to his usual blustering line of questioning? He does have a disturbing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130326202631/http://gothamist.com/tags/birthcertificate">obsession with bloodlines...</a></p>

<p>A Westminster spokesperson told us, &quot;For the past few years, [Westminster Director of Communications] David Frei has been bringing the &#x201C;Best In Show&#x201D; victor to visit with Mr. Trump. This has become a tradition that everyone looks forward to annually. Mr. Trump and his staff are always very gracious.&quot; So sure, no one should blame Banana Joe for traditions that started years before he ascended the ranks of his breed to become a champion. But we will go on record with this: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130326202631/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/12/photos_meet_swagger_the_best-in-sho.php">Swagger would never have done this.</a> But SWAGGER WAS ROBBED.</p>
