<p>Six people were fatally shot and at least seven others were wounded in shooting violence over this weekend. Coming on the heels of a seven day stretch in which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150103064630/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/14/zero_murders_in_nyc_last_week.php">there were  no recorded murders in NYC</a>, four people were killed in the Bronx and two were killed in Brooklyn between Friday night and Sunday morning. </p>

Around 4 a.m., Marco Castillo, 24, was shot to death in the Bronx; police say he was walking down Westchester Avenue when two men approached him, one started a physical fight, and the other man shot him in the head and torso. On Sunday morning around 6:40 a.m., a 38-year-old man was fatally shot in the torso on Boston Road in the Bronx. </p>
