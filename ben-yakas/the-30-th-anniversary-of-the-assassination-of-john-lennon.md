<p>This week marks the 30th anniversary of the assassination of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502151727/http://gothamist.com/tags/johnlennon">John Lennon</a>, who in the years since has attained the title of Greatest Transplant New Yorker Of All Time. On Dec. 8th, 1980, Lennon was murdered by Mark David Chapman on the steps of the The Dakota on the UWS.

He worked on Lennon for 25 minutes with two other surgeons and six nurses, to no avail: &quot;I had no idea who the patient was. It wasn&apos;t until a nurse looked inside his wallet for identification that we realized who it was. In death he looked almost nothing like he looked in life. He was gray, he was gaunt, he had no signs of life. He had no pulse, no blood pressure...He was not breathing. We could have at that moment declared him dead.&quot; Meanwhile, some are still arguing over whether or not Chapman was a lone gunman, and if he was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502151727/http://www.irishcentral.com/story/ent/amyandrews_gossipgirl/cia-link-to-john-lennon-death-possible-says-new-documentary-111330589.html">a pawn of</a> the CIA.
