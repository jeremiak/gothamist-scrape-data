<p>After weeks of anticipation heralded by weeks of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150527205847/http://gothamist.com/2014/06/02/de_blasio_free_stuff.php">Park Slope giveaways</a>, the de Blasios finally left Brooklyn for the pastures of Manhattan, and moved into Gracie Mansion this week. All the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150527205847/http://gothamist.com/2014/07/30/de_blasios_new_york_west_elm_furnit.php">donated West Elm furniture</a> in the world wasn&apos;t going to be enough to pay for this little adventure: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150527205847/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/02/nyregion/cost-of-putting-mayors-family-in-new-home-nears-145000.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;_r=0">according to the Times</a>, the move cost <strong>nearly $145,000.</strong> Below, we&apos;ve broken down exactly how this exorbitant amount was reached.</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>West Elm furniture</strong>: $65,000 (donated by West Elm)</li>
	<li><strong>How much it would have cost if they had just used hollow/plastic West Elm prop furniture</strong>: Some amount much, much less than $65,000, probably in the $1,400 ish range, but that&apos;s just a ballpark estimate. Please contact your local West Elm for more specific information</li>
	<li><strong>Repainting walls, refinishing floors, refurbishing kitchen</strong> (a kitchen located IN THE ATTIC, because who doesn&apos;t love to cook in the attic?): $25,488 (paid for by the NYC Parks Department, who certainly couldn&apos;t have used that money toward <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150527205847/http://archive.advocate.nyc.gov/news/2012-09-15/de-blasio-presses-nypd-parks-dept-security-lack-response-incident-preceding-central-">anything else</a>)</li>
	<li><strong>Increasing the height of every room in the building to accommodate <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150527205847/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/21/photo_giant_de_blasio_takes_the_sub.php">towering giants</a></strong>: Priceless </li>
	<li><strong>Increasing the width of every door frame to better protect the sanctity of Dante&apos;s ever-growing afro</strong>: Also priceless</li>
	<li><strong>Unspecified security measures</strong>: $3,100 (paid for by the mayor&apos;s office)</li>
	<li><strong>How much installing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150527205847/http://www.slomins.com/">Slomin&apos;s Shield</a> would have cost</strong>: $1,289</li>
	<li><strong>How much identity theft protection Lifelock would have cost</strong>: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150527205847/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/19/rudy_giuliani_now_an_identity_theft.php">9/11</a></li>
	<li><strong>Carpet cleaning, relocating artwork &amp; furniture (mostly to storage), performing &quot;decorative touch ups&quot;</strong>: $45,026 (paid for by Gracie Mansion Conservancy, which is funded by private donors)</li>
	<li><strong>Amount of money that could have been donated to charity by private donors if the de Blasios had stayed in Brooklyn instead of moving into a venerable museum</strong>: $45,026 (&quot;Gracie Mansion has not had residents in over 12 years; it had to be turned back into a home,&quot; noted de Blasio spokesperson Rebecca Katz)</li>
	<li><strong>Transporting belongings from Brooklyn to Manhattan</strong>: $6,135.39 (unclear who paid for this)</li>
	<li><strong>How much it would have cost if Dante had helped his dad pack up their things in brown boxes, and then they rented a U-Haul like everyone else does</strong>: $19.95 plus mileage and the promise of another <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150527205847/http://gothamist.com/2014/07/22/video_dante_de_blasio_boat.php">Italian motorboat ride</a></li>
	<li><strong>Cost of dining around the Upper East Side</strong>: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150527205847/http://gothamist.com/2014/07/29/upper_east_side_guide.php">Delicious</a> (and way more than we can afford)</li>
	<li><strong>Strange but sharp reminder that our mayor is no longer a diminutive billionaire who can afford a token salary in exchange for dolling out withering dismissals of critics and journalists</strong>: More priceless every day.</li>
