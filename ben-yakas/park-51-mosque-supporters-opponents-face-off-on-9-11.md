</div></div>					<p>Vying groups of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160810061632/http://gothamist.com/tags/mosque">pro and anti-mosque protesters</a> converged yesterday near Ground Zero as victim&apos;s families mourned their loved ones. Thousands of extremely opinionated people flooded the streets after the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160810061632/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/11/remembering_911_in_nyc.php">somber morning ceremony</a>, where the names of the 2,752 victims of the September 11, 2001 attacks were read. Many mourners weren&apos;t happy with the attention the protesters were garnering: &quot;<strong>It&apos;s their five minutes of fame</strong>...It&apos;s a terrible thing. The true spirit is reflection and getting together,&quot; Dave Milanowycz, whose nephew died on 9/11, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160810061632/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/both_sides_desecrate_vigil_kin_107jwSe3tjO9BHnh4QAbhK">told the Post</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160810061632/http://cognitivecreative.com/">Dan Lurie tells us</a> that despite the huge crowds, it was a largely incident-free day, thanks in part to a tremendous police presence, &quot;While the rhetoric by some on either side might be construed as calls to violence, they were by far the minority, and in the two-and-a-half hours I was there, I saw only three instances where the police had to get involved, and two of those involved the same person.&quot; There were conflicting reports about how many people attended the rallies; the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160810061632/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/rallies_rage_in_downtown_duel_bfR6LhnozVPCPUXAWXReWP">Post says</a> the &quot;estimated 3,000 pro-mosque demonstrators outnumbered the mosque opponents by about 500,&quot; but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160810061632/http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,2017674,00.html">Time says</a> there were far greater numbers of anti-mosque protesters.</p>

<p>The two sides were mostly separate and peaceful, with only a few flare-ups and confrontations, including a man who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160810061632/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/11/man_rips_and_burns_koran_at_ground.php">began ripping and burning a Koran</a>. One Muslim-American, Matthew Paternoster, 25, of Freehold, NJ, was surrounded by about a dozen mosque opponents after confronting them over signs that read &quot;No Obama&apos;s mosque.&quot; &quot;They&apos;re spreading lies. Islam is a peaceful religion, but they&apos;re saying I am part of all this terror,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160810061632/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/09/12/2010-09-12_protesters_reach_fevered_pitch.html">he told the Daily News</a>.</p>
