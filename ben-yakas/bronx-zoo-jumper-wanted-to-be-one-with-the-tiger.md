<p>On Friday afternoon, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424155432/http://gothamist.com/2012/09/21/breaking_man_jumped_into_the_tiger.php">a man was mauled by a tiger</a> after he jumped out of the Bronx Zoo&#x2019;s Wild Asia Monorail and into a tiger den. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424155432/http://gothamist.com/2012/09/22/tiger.php">Authorities initially believed</a> that David Villalobos, 25, jumped on purpose because he &quot;wanted to die.&quot; But from his hospital bed, Villalobos <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424155432/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/bronx/with_tiger_leaped_into_exhibit_wanted_tO6ad2UwxjDMP4zxRRdB0H">told police yesterday that</a> he wasn&apos;t suicidal at all&#x2014;when asked why he jumped, he said &#x201C;everybody in life makes choices,&#x201D; adding that he wanted &quot;to be one with the tiger.&quot;  </p>

<p>Villalobos, who was mauled by an 11-year-old male Amur tiger named Bachuta, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424155432/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/bronx/who_safari_now_0UQtQ5Zrmaa91JuS9MufrN?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Bronx">suffered</a> a broken right shoulder, right ankle, right rib and pelvis and a collapsed lung in the incident. &#x201C;He recalled being dragged by the tiger by the foot, and afterwards being able to pet the tiger,&#x201D; Browne said. &#x201C;No surprise he landed on all fours considering his passion for cats.&quot; Doctors installed a metal rod through Villalobos&#x2019; foot, so he won&apos;t lose it despite being chewed by the tiger.</p>

<p>Browne dryly noted in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424155432/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/23/nyregion/trespassing-charges-expected-against-man-who-leapt-into-tiger-habitat-at-bronx-zoo.html?ref=nyregion">an email to the Times</a> that Villalobos appeared to have a &#x201C;passion for cats.&#x201D; Police now believe the stunt may have been planned&#x2014;Villalobos told cops he rode the monorail over the tiger preserve two weeks ago with his girlfriend. He has been charged with trespassing, and issued a desk appearance ticket.</p>

<p>Villalobos&#x2019; former boss at V-Note, a vegan restaurant on the Upper East Side, described Villalobos as a strict vegan with a nature-centric world view: &#x201C;He was very much into his own belief system&#x2014;into taking care of himself and the world,&#x201D; V-Note&#x2019;s general manager Chris O&#x2019;Neill <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424155432/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/mauled-man-wanted-tiger-commit-suicide-invaded-bronx-zoo-den-article-1.1165436">told the News</a>. &#x201C;Everyone takes care of Mother Earth,&#x201D; O&#x2019;Neill said of Villalobos&#x2019; world view.<br>
