<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150423194407/http://gothamist.com/tags/hurricaneirene">It&apos;s been a long weekend</a>, to put it mildly: Hurricane Irene bore down upon the city, and a patient kind of panic broke loose. Thankfully, the storm wasn&apos;t half as bad as expected, except for flooding, power outages, and no way to get to work tomorrow morning. Mayor Bloomberg was late for every press conference he scheduled, people played rugby in Times Square, and Grand Central was completely (and eerily) empty. A reporter got hit with raw sewage, some idiots went kayaking, and there were lots of hilarious Tweets. There&apos;s still a lot of cleaning up to come, but to end this long weekend, here&apos;s a rainbow over West Orange, with Manhattan and Newark in the distance. See you next weather disaster!</p>
