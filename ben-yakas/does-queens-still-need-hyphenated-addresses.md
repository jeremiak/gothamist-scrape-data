title: Does Queens Still Need Hyphenated Addresses?

But Queens residents <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429184940/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/queens/2011/08/21/2011-08-21_a_dash_of_confusion_why_do_queens_addresses_take_a_hyphen_residents_ask.html?r=ny_local&amp;utm_sourc">have started rebelling against</a> their hyphenated overlords, asking why Queens is the only borough whose addresses are dashed. And there are no easy answers: &quot;No one could tell me. Unless you talk to a historian, it is difficult to get a logical answer,&quot; said Queens resident  Nancy Arjara-Spence, who grew up in the non-hyphenated Bronx.</p>

<p>According to Queens historian Jack Eichenbaum, the dash was first introduced in 1898, when the borough was still a rural area. &quot;Each settlement developed their own little grid or &apos;gridlets&apos; of streets based on geography. The gridlets had familiar street names but many of the numbers were repeated throughout the county. A mailing address had to include the name of the post office and the street name and number,&quot; he said. </p>

<p>As the borough expanded in the 20th century, a master grid was imposed in 1920: &quot;Since then, a typical street address in Queens has the form X-Y and Z. If Z is a street, X is the closest lower-number avenue. If Z is an avenue, X is the closest lower- number street. In both cases Y, after the hyphen, is the house number.&quot; For a full rundown of the Queens street format, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429184940/http://stevemorse.org/census/changes/QueensFormat.htm">check out this article.</a></p>

<p>However, with the advent of zip codes, the hyphen is not actually necessary any longer. US Postal Service spokeswoman Darleen Reid confirmed that: &quot;The right Queens zip code is the main thing we need.&quot;</p>

<p>Queens resident&#x2014;and former Gothamist editor&#x2014;Jaya Saxena told us she has been frequently frustrated because of websites that don&apos;t accept the dash: &quot;I like it, because you can tell immediately from the address what someone&apos;s cross streets are. However, I remember having a problem at one job where they weren&apos;t sending me my paychecks because they wouldn&apos;t accept the address as &apos;25-08.&apos;&quot; Queens resident Will Schwartz was incredulous at the question: &quot;What in the world kind of question is that?<strong>It&apos;s just the way we do our addresses!&quot;</strong></p>

<p>At least there&apos;s no confusion over where The Duke would have stood in this divisive debate: </p>
