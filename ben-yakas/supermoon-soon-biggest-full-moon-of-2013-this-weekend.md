<p>This weekend, the moon will be at its closest point to Earth at the same time that it is full, an event scientists call a &#x201C;lunar perigee,&#x201D; or as we around the office like to howl, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928013924/http://gothamist.com/tags/supermoon">SUPERMOON</a>. The moon will be at its fullest <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928013924/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Super-Moon-Full-Moon-Bright-Big-Sky-212484111.html">on Sunday June 23rd at 7:32 a.m. EDT</a>, but New Yorkers should be able to soak in it Saturday night into the early hours of Sunday morning. Let NASA explain the whole phenomenon to you in the video below.</p>

<p>Last year it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928013924/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/06/supermoon_fail_supermoon_obscured_b.php">was a bit too cloudy to see it</a>, but so far, the weather forecast looks like we&apos;ll have clear skies all weekend. As we&apos;ve explained <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928013924/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/04/dont_start_panicing_supermoon_on_it.php">in the past</a>, SuperMoon is nothing to be frightened of: despite some conspiracy theorists tying SuperMoon with various hurricanes and floods, scientists have dispelled this as mere coincidence. As ever, human paranoia is much more dangerous than any perceived supernatural occurrences. </p>

<p>So get out your cameras, and send your pictures of SuperMoon to photos@gothamist.com, or tag us on Instagram with #Gothamist. And feel free to break out a copy of <em>Dark Side Of The Moon</em> for the occasion, because apparently there will be a laser light show as well.</p>
