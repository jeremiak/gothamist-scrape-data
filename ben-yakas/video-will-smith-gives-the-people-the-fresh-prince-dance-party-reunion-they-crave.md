<p>Will Smith is nothing if not a man of the people, up for a sequel to just about anything he&apos;s been in if people want it (except when it comes <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130827083246/http://insidemovies.ew.com/2013/03/27/will-smith-independence-day-sequels/">to <em>Independence Day</em></a>, for some tragic reason). But Smith&apos;s most beloved role remains that of the titular <em>Fresh Prince of Bel-Air</em>. And this week, Smith and son Jaden brought DJ Jazzy Jeff and Carlton (Alfonso Ribeiro) onstage during an appearance on The Graham Norton Show. Come for the Fresh Prince, stay for the awkward dancing courtesy of fellow guest Heather Graham.</p>

<p>The surprise mini-Fresh Prince reunion included them rapping the theme song and pulling off some of the most famous dances from the show. It&apos;s just too bad Uncle Phil wasn&apos;t around to join in.</p>

<p>Smith must really love Norton&#x2014;the last time Smith was on The Graham Norton Show, he lead the audience on an impromptu sing along of the theme song as well.</p>
