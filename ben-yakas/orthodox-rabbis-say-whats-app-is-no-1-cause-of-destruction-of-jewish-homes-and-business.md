<p>You probably already know that many ultra-Orthodox Jews don&apos;t care much for the internet. You have trouble organizing your sock drawer, while they organized a massive <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504004904/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/21/ultra-orthodox_internet_rally_bans.php">40K person anti-internet rally at Citi Field two years ago</a> AND successfully shut out the media. But there is a new scourge upon the Orthodox community: WhatsApp. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504004904/http://forward.com/articles/192295/whatsapp-spreads-fast-among-ultra-orthodox-and-r/?p=all">According to the Jewish Daily Forward</a>, orthodox Jewish leaders think the social media app, a free alternate to SMS texting akin to Gchat, is tearing apart the community from Boro Park to Rockland County. &quot;The rabbis overseeing divorces say WhatsApp is the No. 1 cause of destruction of Jewish homes and business,&quot; blared the headline of a January article in Der Blatt, the Yiddish-language newspaper published by members of the Satmar Hasidic group. </p>

<p>Orthodox leaders already require families to use filters to block social networking and &quot;inappropriate&quot; material on the internet and smartphones, but WhatsApp has emerged as a way around the filters. Some Brooklyn Jews told the Forward that they use it to spread news about the community, like when <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504004904/http://gothamist.com/tags/MenachemStark">Menachem Stark</a> disappeared. &#x201C;It was very popular during the whole Stark story,&#x201D; said Joseph Oppenheim, a member of the Satmar Hasidic community and the owner of a computer store and Internet cafe in Williamsburg. &#x201C;You couldn&#x2019;t get it on the radio and stuff, so this was the main source [where] people got the news.&#x201D;</p>

<p>&quot;It&apos;s not something they can control,&quot; said another member of the Hasidic community who lives in Williamsburg. &quot;Anything they can&apos;t be in control of makes them nervous.&quot;</p>
