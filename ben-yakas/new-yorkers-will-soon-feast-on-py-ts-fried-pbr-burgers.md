<p>We don&apos;t like to admit it, but New York is stuck in a serious rut. Oh sure, we have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429103310/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/03/behold_the_dunkin_donuts_glazed_don.php">Glazed Dunkin&apos; Donut Breakfast Sandwiches</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429103310/http://gothamist.com/tags/ramenburger">Ramen Burgers</a>, but we&apos;re not really thriving or striving, not <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429103310/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/14/next_level_mcrib_features_bacon_moz.php">compared to the likes of Germany</a>. But thankfully, New Yorkers can start really living again: Philadelphia&apos;s beloved Frankenburger joint, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429103310/http://pytphilly.com/">PYT</a>, is expanding to NYC. And that means they&apos;ll hopefully be bringing along their disgustingly-delicious Fried PBR burgers.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429103310/http://www.zagat.com/b/pyt-is-going-national">Zagat reports</a> that PYT, which opened in Philly&apos;s Northern Liberties in 2009, has signed a deal to expand nationally&#x2014;franchisees are already lined up in New York and DC (though locations have not been set). PYT prides itself on being &quot;Home of America&apos;s Craaaziest Burgers&quot;&#x2014;that includes every possibly combination of fatty fried junk food, from fried Elio&apos;s pizza to fried Twinkies, from fried Krispy Kreme doughnuts to fried shrimp, from fried PBJ sandwiches to fried apple. </p>

<p>There have been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429103310/http://elitedaily.com/envision/food/these-are-the-10-craziest-burger-concoctions-pyt-philly-is-responsible-for-creating/">articles written</a> in honor of their taco shells made entirely out of bacon. And the latest jewel in their crown is the fried PBR burger known as The Beerger: &quot;Pretzel coated Fried PBR on a juicy beef patty, topped with pickles and &amp; mustard -dill aoili.&quot;</p>

<p>So yes, it is time for carnivorous New Yorkers to crawl out of their apartments, unstrap their belt buckles, and gorge. Right after we finish <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429103310/http://gothamist.com/2011/07/11/vegan_fried_kool-aid_comes_to_the_e.php">deep-fried Kool-Aid balls</a>.
