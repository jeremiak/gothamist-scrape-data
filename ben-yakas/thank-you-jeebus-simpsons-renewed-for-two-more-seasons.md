<p>The unpossible <em>Simpsons</em> money dispute that has been threatening the future of the long-running show has been settled: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509152052/http://insidetv.ew.com/2011/10/07/the-simpsons-renewed-by-fox-for-two-more-seasons/">Fox announced late yesterday that</a> it has renewed the show for two more seasons. The announcement didn&apos;t specifiy whether the 25th season would be the show&apos;s last, but it did add: &#x201C;In the words of Homer Simpson, <strong>&#x2018;Woo Hoo! I outlasted Andy Rooney!&#x2019;&#x201D;</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509152052/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/04/the_simpsons_facing_unpossible_mone.php">dispute broke out at the start of the week</a> when Fox studio executives insisted that the cast accept a whopping 45 percent pay cut, or else face the end of the show after the completion of the current 23rd season. Then Harry Shearer, the voice of Mr. Burns and Ned Flanders (among others), laid out the casts&apos; counteroffer: they were willing to take a 70 percent pay cut, if the studio were willing to give them a piece of the back end profits. </p>

<p>In the end, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509152052/http://www.deadline.com/2011/10/fox-renews-the-simpsons-for-two-more-seasons/">two sides settled on a salary cut</a> in the range of 30 percent from the actors&#x2019; current paychecks of $440,000 per episode. So the longest-running primetime TV series will go on for <em>at least</em> two more season. </p>

<p>So despite the fact that many of us will probably not see the new episodes until we stumble onto them after they inevitably shoot into syndication; despite the fact that many feel the show has worn out its welcome with season-after-season of re-heated storylines; and despite the fact that we were kind of getting excited about the prospect of eulogizing the greatest American TV show of all time, we&apos;re happy everything worked out for now. Really, we were only saying &quot;Boo-urns.&quot; Now let&apos;s all give a celebratory strut:</p>
