The report states that students at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150114001418/http://www.opportunitycharter.org/">Opportunity Charter School</a> in Harlem were punched, thrown to the floor and dragged around by their hair, in what &quot;could be considered condoned assaults and abuse of schoolchildren,&quot; that was covered up by school officials.</p>

<p>According to Special Commissioner of Investigation Richard Condon&apos;s report, the academically-struggling Harlem school <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150114001418/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/manhattan_charter_school_abused_FtKyK5HMFIRsEnGvYwn2XK">initialized</a> its own internal investigation of the alleged abuse that &quot;excluded or minimized incidents of &#x2018;physical intervention&#x2019; or &#x2018;physical restraints.&#x2019;&quot; Among those incidents the school did not report were:</p>

<ul><li>A team of &quot;specialists&quot; put a 12-year-old student in a headlock after he became &quot;disruptive&quot; during a science class in May 2008. He ended up with a bloody nose and black eye.
</li><li>One specialist pulled a 15-year-old girl&apos;s head off her desk and dragged her out of the classroom by her hair.
</li><li>Another specialist pushed a 15-year-old student into a door jam head-first.
</li><li>A 14-year-old boy was thrown to the ground and pinned down after he refused to remove what staff referred to as &quot;gang beads.&quot;</li></ul>

<p>The report comes on the heels of similar allegations of abuse at a charter school in Houston, Texas, where video of a special education teacher at Jamie&apos;s House Charter School beating a 13-year-old student was leaked. (<strong>Video below.</strong>) The two-time &quot;Teacher of the Year&quot;-winning Sherri Davis was fired swiftly, and appeared on ABC to defend herself <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150114001418/http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/TheLaw/exclusive-houston-teacher-sherri-davis-accused-beating-student/story?id=10686156">this morning</a>. She didn&apos;t excuse her behavior, but did go on to give a fuller context of the chaotic nature of the school: <strong>&quot;Clearly I do not justify my own response, but what needs to happen&#x2014;there needs to be a system designed that protects the kids...I should not be the protector for the child that was in immediate danger.&quot; </strong></p>
