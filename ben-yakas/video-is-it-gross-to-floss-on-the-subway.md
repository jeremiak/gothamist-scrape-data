<p>As <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429100004/http://gothamist.com/tags/subwayetiquette">subway etiquette</a> aficionados, we&apos;re inundated with all kinds of gross and rude subway behavior, from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429100004/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/15/subway_etiquette_101_please_dont_hu.php">pole huggers</a> to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429100004/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/18/video_subway_spaghetti_spat_sparks.php">spaghetti munchers</a> to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429100004/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/15/video_man_licks_shoe_on_subway.php">shoe lickers</a>. But this is the first time we&apos;ve seen a complaint about flossing: tipster &quot;Jamie&quot; spotted the man in the video below taking advantage of a plastic floss pick on a downtown C Train this morning. She says he wiped it &quot;on his newspaper, continuing to both floss and read the newspaper. <strong>I was appalled and afraid some &quot;stuff&quot; would flick off on me.&quot;</strong> Experience what she felt with the IMAX-esque video below&#x2014;you can practically feel the particles of half-eaten food being flung all around.</p>

<p><iframe src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429100004if_/http://player.vimeo.com/video/54609763?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;badge=0" width="640" height="1127" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen></iframe> </p><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429100004/http://vimeo.com/54609763">Subway Floss Video</a> from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429100004/http://vimeo.com/gothamist">Gothamist</a> on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429100004/http://vimeo.com/">Vimeo</a>.</p><p></p>

<p>At least he was wiping it on a NY Post. We&apos;re torn on this one: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429100004/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHvFFyz2az8">even monkeys have to floss</a> their teeth sometimes! And as many Gothamist staffers noted, at least he was using a pick and not dental tape. But as with most subway etiquette things, the question is: why couldn&apos;t he have flossed at home, BEFORE he was in a public space? Even if it isn&apos;t the grossest thing we&apos;ve seen, we were always taught that it was rude to floss in front of other people under any circumstance.</p>

<p>So, would you be appalled by someone flossing on the subway next to you? Or is this a non-issue compared to that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429100004/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/22/video_when_will_people_get_that_cli.php">maddening nail clipping sound</a>? </p>
