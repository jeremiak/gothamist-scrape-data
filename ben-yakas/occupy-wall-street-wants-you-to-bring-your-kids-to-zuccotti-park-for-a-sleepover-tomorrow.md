</div></div><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120124131556/http://gothamist.com/tags/occupywallstreet">Occupy Wall Street</a> protesters have been hard at work trying to capture the hearts and minds of the middle class, Middle America, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120124131556/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/10/listen_al_sharpton_broadcasts_live.php">mid-level talk show hosts</a>. But now it seems they&apos;re turning their attentions toward a block with slightly less voting power: children. Tomorrow, there will be a Family Sleepover at Zuccotti Park for the sake of &quot;our children&#x2019;s futures.&quot;</p>

<p>The event, hosted by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120124131556/http://www.parentsforoccupywallst.com/">Parents For Occupy Wall Street</a>, will take place from 4 p.m., Friday until 11 a.m. the<br>
following Saturday morning. It was supposed to happen last Friday, except a little stand-off with the NYPD and a last minute cleaning cram got in the way. Below, check out the announcement in full:</p>

<blockquote>Liberty Square, NY &#x2014; A second try. 

<p>The parent founded and run group, &#x201C;Parents for Occupy Wall Street,&#x201D; will be <br>
hosting a Family Sleepover, from 4 PM, Friday, October 21st until 11 AM the <br>
following Saturday morning&#x2014;a second try after being forced to cancel their <br>
planned sleepover last weekend because of a threatened eviction. With the <br>
Family Sleepover rescheduled for this weekend, parents and families in the <br>
greater New York City area are excited to demonstrate their support for this <br>
growing movement creating real change for our children&#x2019;s futures. </p>

<p>Occupy Wall Street is a place for everyone, including families. At the <br>
Family Sleepover, families and children will find arts and crafts, a <br>
children&#x2019;s music sing along, a pizza party, and a bed time story. With the <br>
help of various teacher and parent groups, such as the &#x201C;School for the 99%,&#x201D; <br>
and the Occupy Wall Street Outreach team, the Family Sleepover will have a <br>
sectioned off Child and Family Only area at Liberty Plaza. </p>

<p>Safety is the first measure on everyone&#x2019;s mind. Security and strict <br>
involvement rules will be taken at the event including a check in and check <br>
out system with parent&#x2019;s ID with a Parents for Occupy Wall Street security <br>
person and an hourly headcount. All parents will be required to wear an <br>
identifying T-shirt while working shifts around the hour. The police are <br>
already aware of the group and will be checked in with hourly on the group&#x2019;s <br>
size and location. </p>

<p>The group&#x2019;s goal is to raise awareness of the diversity of people supporting <br>
the movement. In the press, there is an assumption that the only people <br>
supporting the movement are solely homeless or unemployed when that couldn&#x2019;t <br>
be further from the truth. With even a short visit to Liberty Plaza, you <br>
will see all walks of life supporting the movement, including middle class <br>
working families. </p>

<p>With the Family Sleepover, Parents for Occupy Wall Street are Occupying to <br>
speak up for the ones without a voice and make real change, change for their <br>
children&#x2019;s futures. </p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>This isn&apos;t the first attempt at getting kids involved with OWS activities: author Daniel Handler, better known as children&apos;s writer Lemony Snicket, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120124131556/http://occupywriters.com/by-lemony-snicket">posted 13 observations on OWS</a> for kids from his characters witty voice, such as: &quot;People who say money doesn&#x2019;t matter are like people who say cake doesn&#x2019;t matter&#x2014;it&#x2019;s probably because they&#x2019;ve already had a few slices.&quot;</p>

<p>One parent went around Zuccotti asking protesters to explain OWS to their six-year-old daughter, and came out with this video: </p>
