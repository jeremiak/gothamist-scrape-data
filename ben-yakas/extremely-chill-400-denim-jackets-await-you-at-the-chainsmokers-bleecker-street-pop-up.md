<p>The Chainsmokers are many things: a smelly frat house whose wish to become a real boy was granted by a wizard; a living advertisement for online DJ school courses; and of course, a sentient STD that is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170609215940/http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/magazine-feature/7510387/the-chainsmokers-billboard-cover-closer">just as shallow</a> as you might imagine. But they are also the musical id of unbridled, unrepentant capitalism&#x2014;and to that end, they&apos;re selling $400 denim jackets at a pop-up in lower Manhattan this weekend.</p>

<p>The pop-up store, which is located at 205 Bleecker Street (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170609215940/http://gothamist.com/2017/06/01/why_bleecker_street_sucks.php"><em>of course</em></a>), will be open from 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. today, tomorrow and Sunday. The duo who make up the group, whose names I assume are Mr. Chain and Mr. Smoker, apparently will make an appearance there at some point, though nobody knows when. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170609215940/http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/dance/7817714/the-chainsmokers-memories-pop-up-nyc?utm_source=twitter">According to Billboard</a>, those denim jackets were designed by Lauren Kessler, who is the Design Director for The Chainsmokers, which I can&apos;t believe is a real job: &quot;There are only 100 of them in the world, each given a serial number and crafted using recycled bits of old Chainsmokers merch. Those lyrics were handwritten by the guys, so consider standing in line now.&quot; They&apos;re selling other more reasonably priced things as well (like $15 Chainsmokers sunglasses), but it should be noted that even Kanye West, who has been in this game <em>a lot</em> longer than the Chains Who Smoke, didn&apos;t have the cojones to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170609215940/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/19/photos_video_kanye_west_pop-up.php#photo-1">sell $400 jackets to his fans</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170609215940/http://www.stereogum.com/1945883/a-somewhat-surprising-morning-at-the-chainsmokers-pop-up-shop/franchises/sounding-board/">Stereogum has a hilarious and tender</a> write-up of the opening of the pop-up yesterday by writer Kelly Conaboy. Among other things, she met a woman there who&#x2019;d arrived at 2 a.m. to be first on line (&quot;I just feel like they&#x2019;re really fun, cool guys. They seem really chill.&#x201D;), a 12-year-old superfan (who noted unprompted, &quot;They don&#x2019;t seem like total jerks.&#x201D;), and a grown man in a suit showing everyone a photo of Bill de Blasio for unclear reasons. &quot;It&#x2019;s interesting how time expands and contracts relative to the amount of Chainsmokers pop-up store lines in which one is standing at any given moment. (The approximate number of people allowed inside at a time was ten),&quot; Conaboy said.</p>

<p>If you do visit the pop-up, make sure to say hi to all-time #1 Chainsmokers fan <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170609215940/http://twitter.com/bfishbfish">Rebecca Fishbein</a>, who informed me (after gasping for breath and literally kicking at the air) that she would camp out there as long as it took to &quot;pet the spiky hair&quot; of the duo. </p>

<p>In case the smoking chains are reading this, she adds: &quot;Tell them to find me and be my friend. I LIKE THE OLD ONE. You can put this all into your post.&quot;</p>
