<p>Last month, NJ teen <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150409202425/http://gothamist.com/tags/rachelcanning">Rachel Canning</a> moved out of her house and/or was kicked out of her house, and unsuccessfully sued her parents for child support. Rachel, an 18-year-old honors student at Morris Catholic, was accepted to numerous colleges, and said in her suit she wanted her parents to pay for her remaining Catholic school tuition (about $5,300), plus a deposit for college. The suit was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150409202425/http://gothamist.com/2014/03/18/nj_teen_quits_lawsuit.php">eventually dropped</a>, and it now turns out that Rachel never really needed her parents&apos; help with college: &quot;Decision made,&quot; Canning wrote on her Facebook, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150409202425/http://www.nj.com/morris/index.ssf/2014/04/nj_teen_rachel_canning_who_sued_parents_picks_college.html">according to the Star-Ledger</a>. &quot;WNE U class of 2018 BME Major w/ 56,000$ [sic] scholarship.&quot; </p>

<p>WNE refers to Western New England University in Springfield, Massachusets, whose tuition including room and board is approximately $46K for the first year&#x2014;meaning she&apos;ll have an extra $10K for, I don&apos;t know, paying off approximately $13K in legal fees she owes. Unless her parents already took care of it. Considering that Canning had sought child support of $654 per week (in addition to the high school, college, and legal fees), it&apos;s the least they could do.</p>

<p>Originally, Rachel said she wanted to go to the University of Vermont to study biomedical engineering; she was given a $20K scholarship offer there, but this apparently works out better for all parties involved. It&apos;s comforting to know colleges don&apos;t necessarily judge prospective students based on the very public lawsuits they file against their parents. </p>
