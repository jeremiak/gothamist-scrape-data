<p>A teen was carjacked by a bad Samaritan who helped him shovel his car from out of the snow. According to police, the 19-year-old victim was struggling to get his car out of snow  at 75th Street in Ozone Park when Genero Placenia, 18, offered to help. Placenia pushed the car as the victim accelerated from the driver&apos;s seat.</p>

<p>Once the car was free, Placenia asked the victim for a ride to East New York. When they got there, Placenia pulled out a black 9mm High Point gun and kicked the driver out of the car. Placenia also took the teen&apos;s iPhone and $60. Cops were able to locate the stolen car quickly, and tracked Placenia down as he was trying to get rid of his identifying clothing.</p>

<p>Placenia has been charged with robbery, criminal possession of a weapon, criminal possession of stolen property, and resisting arrest. This was the second carjacking-at-gunpoint to occur this week:  Albert Sanders <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140209095726/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/03/building_super_carjacked_while_shov.php">was carjacked</a> in the West Village as he was shoveling snow on Friday. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m OK.
