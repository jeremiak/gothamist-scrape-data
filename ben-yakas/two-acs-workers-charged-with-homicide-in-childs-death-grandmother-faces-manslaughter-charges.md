<p>Last year, severely malnourished four-year-old <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150527002056/http://gothamist.com/tags/marchellapierce">Marcella Pierce</a> died in her Bedford-Stuyvesant apartment weighing a scant 18 pounds and showing signs of other traumas. Her mother, Carlotta Brett-Pierce, was arrested and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150527002056/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/03/malnourished_girls_mother_impatient.php">charged</a> with murder, manslaughter and assault, but yesterday prosecutors <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150527002056/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/24/nyregion/24acs.html?_r=1&amp;ref=nyregion">charged three more people</a>, including two Administration for Children&apos;s Services case workers and the girl&apos;s own grandmother, with contributing to her death. &quot;Baby Marchella might be alive today had these ACS workers attended to her case with the basic levels of care it deserved, or had her grandmother stepped in and put a stop to the shocking abuse she is charged with facilitating,&quot; said Brooklyn DA Charles Hynes.<br>
 <br>
Two former ACS employees <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150527002056/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704050204576218733519618932.html?mod=WSJ_NY_MIDDLELEADNewsCollection">were indicted</a> on charges of criminally negligent homicide&#x2014;it&apos;s believed to be the first time in the city&#x2019;s history that child welfare workers had been charged with homicide in a child&#x2019;s death&#x2014;and Marcella&apos;s grandmother, Loretta Brett, was also indicted on manslaughter and other charges. Brooklyn DA Charles Hynes said, &#x201C;I said at the time we announced the indictment of Marchella&#x2019;s mother that this was not going to be an investigation that was going away. We are going to find out at long last what they&#x2019;re doing at ACS to make sure there are no more child fatalities.&quot;</p>

<p>The indictment charges that the grandmother witnessed the little girl being tied to a bed and her crib many, many times. The indictment also charges that former ACS caseworker Damon Adams failed to make nearly all of the mandated biweekly visits to the Bedford-Stuyvesant home, and falsified ACS records to show he did; Chereece Bell, his former ACS supervisor, is accused of failing to properly oversee and monitor Adams&apos; work with Marchella and her family.</p>

<p>In the wake of Marcella&apos;s death, a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150527002056/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/09/blame_war_in_death_of_malnourished.php">blame war</a> ensued between ACS and nonprofit organization Child Development Support Corporation (CDSC) over who was more to blame for the death. Hynes said that  he was convening a special grand jury to investigate &#x201C;evidence of alleged systemic failures&#x201D; at ACS. Among the cases they may be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150527002056/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2011/03/23/2011-03-23_acs_aware_of_abuse_of_major_gonzalez_jashya_brown_nixzmary_brown__carlos_winbush.html">reviewing</a> are: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150527002056/http://gothamist.com/2009/12/09/babys_death_under_investigation.php">Major Gonzalez</a>, an 11-month-old who died of viral pneumonia in Dec. 2009, and whose parents spent six months in jail for neglect; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150527002056/http://gothamist.com/2008/08/20/2yearold_dies_acs_was_monitoring_fa.php">Jashya Brown</a> a two-year-old victim of battered child syndrome who was found dead in August 2008; and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150527002056/http://gothamist.com/tags/nixzmarybrown">Nixzmary Brown</a>, another severely malnourished seven-year-old whose parents are both serving long sentences in jail for her death.</p>
