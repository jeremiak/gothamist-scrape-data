<p>Two years ago, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408100927/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/01/tupac_the_musical_is_real_casting.php">it was announced</a> that a musical about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408100927/http://gothamist.com/tags/tupac">Tupac Shakur</a>, <em>Holler If Ya Hear Me</em>, was in the works. It took a little longer to put it together than producers expected, but come June, the show will finally make its Broadway debut. And below, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408100927/http://popwatch.ew.com/2014/05/09/holler-if-ya-hear-me-broadway-video-california-love/">via EW</a>, you can get the first sneak peek of what it&apos;ll sound like, with clips of  &quot;California Love,&quot; &quot;Unconditional Love,&quot; and the title track.</p>
