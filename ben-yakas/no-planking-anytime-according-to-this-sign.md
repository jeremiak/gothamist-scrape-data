<p>Just when we finally started paying the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623144657/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/15/videos_celebrities_read_go_the_fck.php">teensiest amount of</a> attention to planking...someone went and started posting the above anti-planking signs in the city. Reddit user cmb320 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623144657/http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/i6d2l/no_planking_anytime_street_sign_spotted_in_nyc/">wrote today</a> that he &quot;had a bunch made at buildasign.com 18&quot; x 12&quot; aluminum.&quot; But is planking really that annoying that it warrants banishment?</p>

<p>Planking involves being photographed lying completely flat on your stomach on stuff in random places...and it&apos;s wildly popular <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623144657/https://www.facebook.com/pages/Planking-Australia/147452668649160">on Facebook</a>. There&apos;s even a small but dedicated <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623144657/http://www.facebook.com/pages/NY-Planking/126527707427863">NY wing</a> of the &quot;sport.&quot; When we first heard about the craze from Australia, we just assumed it was another terrible trend like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623144657/http://gothamist.com/2010/06/09/icing.php">icing</a>, or viral marketing like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623144657/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/24/nude_gaming_party_trend_sweeps_new.php">naked gaming parties</a>. </p>

<p>Then the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623144657/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304906004576371770200241238.html?mod=googlenews_wsj">Wall Street Journal</a> picked up on it, celebrities such as Kristen Bell and Flavor Flav <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623144657/http://articles.nydailynews.com/2011-05-27/gossip/29606285_1_kristen-bell-stunt-construction-site">picked up</a> on it...and we still didn&apos;t <em>get</em> it. At all. But as photographer Katie Sokoler showed us recently, it really is just a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623144657/http://colormekatie.blogspot.com/2011/06/planking.html">silly, fun game</a> to play with friends, and nothing more noxious. And there&apos;s nothing wrong with that! Except, unless, you try to do it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623144657/http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/2011/05/australian_man.php">on a seventh-floor balcony.</a> Don&apos;t do that.</p>
