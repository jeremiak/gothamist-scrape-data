<p>A man was struck by a train last night after sitting on the platform and dangling his legs over the tracks. According to FDNY, the incident happened just after 8 p.m. at the 145th Street Station in Harlem. The 56-year-old man, who was sitting at the end of the platform near the train tunnel, was struck by a southbound 1 train; it severed at least one of his legs. NYPD adds that he was taken to St. Luke&apos;s Hospital in critical condition.</p>

<p>Earlier this week, a young woman was pinned between the subway and platform during a train incident&#x2014;NYPD didn&apos;t know any other information about the incident, but we did receive this video of the painful experience:</p>
