<p>This week, the 28-year-old NYPD officer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509202713/http://gothamist.com/tags/cannibalcop">who was arrested for</a> allegedly attempting to &quot;kidnap women and cook them&quot; was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509202713/http://gothamist.com/2012/11/21/cannibal_cop_planned_to_cook_girl_m.php">denied bail for a third time</a> after prosecutors revealed he had discussed getting some &quot;girl meat&quot; for Thanksgiving. Now, the mother of Gilberto Valle is railing about not being able to see her son since he was arrested, and complaining about the media&apos;s portrayal of him: &#x201C;Look it up in the dictionary, the true meaning of &#x2018;cannibal&#x2019; is that he ate human meat,&#x201D; Elizabeth Valle <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509202713/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/meat-parent-mom-son-cannibal-article-1.1207261">told the Daily News</a>. &#x201C;He hasn&#x2019;t eaten a human being!&#x201D;</p>

<p>&#x201C;This is a parent&#x2019;s worst nightmare from one day to the next, and no one seems to care,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;If I had money to hire a good defense team, my son would be out by now.&#x201D; Valle has been in solitary confinement since his arrest on October 24th: &#x201C;I haven&#x2019;t seen my son. I haven&#x2019;t spoken to my son! Do you think that&#x2019;s fair?&#x201D; she asked. Her son has been charged with conspiracy to kidnap and accessing a computer without authorization.  </p>

<p>Valle referred to her son&apos;s conversations about eating women as &quot;Internet chatter,&quot; and offered up an anecdote about taking care of his dog Dudley as evidence of his humanity: &#x201C;I&#x2019;d call him to bring the dog over. He&#x2019;d say &#x2018;Ma, he&#x2019;s still sleeping, I don&#x2019;t want to wake him up,&#x2019;&#x201D; Valle said. &#x201C;Does that sound like a freaking person who would harm anybody? He wouldn&#x2019;t even wake up the dog!&#x201D;<br>
