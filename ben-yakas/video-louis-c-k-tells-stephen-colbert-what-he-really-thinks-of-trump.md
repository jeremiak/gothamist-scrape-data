<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170405211318/http://gothamist.com/tags/louisck">Louis C.K.</a> stopped by the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170405211318/http://gothamist.com/tags/stephencolbert"><em>Late Show With Stephen Colbert</em></a> last night to promote <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170405211318/http://www.avclub.com/review/louis-ck-gloriously-gloomy-ever-2017-253086?utm_content=Main&amp;utm_campaign=SF&amp;utm_source=Twitter&amp;utm_medium=SocialMarketing">his new Netflix special</a> (and also his upcoming hosting gig on SNL), and he had plenty to say about Trump. While he said he regrets comparing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170405211318/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/05/louis_ck_really_doesnt_want_you_to.php">Trump to Hitler</a> last year, he <em>doesn&apos;t</em> want to take it back, and he explained just why. &quot;Now, I guess he&apos;s not as profound as I thought he was,&quot; he said. &quot;I thought he was some new kind of evil. But he&apos;s just a lying sack of sh*t.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sometimes people lie,&quot; C.K. continued. &quot;&apos;That guy lied, they found out he lied.&apos; And then there&apos;s somebody who lies once in a while, can&apos;t quite stay inside the boundaries of truth, right? Somebody who lies sometimes. Then you have a liar, who&apos;s somebody who has a problem, they can&apos;t help it, they lie a lot. And then you have [Trump] a lying sack of sh*t... They like it, <em>he</em> likes it... It&apos;s insane, he&apos;s just a gross crook, dirty, rotten, lying sack of sh*t.&quot;</p>

<p>In a separate segment, C.K. and Colbert talked about their early experiences working together on <em>The Dana Carvey Show</em>. &quot;Now you&apos;re Stephen Colbert,&quot; C.K. explained. &quot;You&apos;re king of the late night now. You&apos;re a big shot. That&apos;s right, you&apos;re number one. You&apos;re the top of the charts. But at the time, you were just this very weird-looking dude...you were like an alien who studied human behavior, and got close but didn&apos;t quite get there.&quot;</p>

<p>In his monologue, Colbert also got into the ongoing Russia investigation and Trump&apos;s decision to donate his first-quarter salary to the National Parks Service (&quot;It&apos;s a nice change of pace to see Trump pay the settlement money before the screwing&quot;), then laced into Sean Spicer shrinking in size: &quot;This job is really grinding him down, starting from the shins up.&quot;</p>

<p>And in a very adorable bit, Colbert combined Spicer&apos;s &quot;phenomenal&quot; reassurances with the classic Muppets song &quot;Mahna Mahna.&quot;</p>
