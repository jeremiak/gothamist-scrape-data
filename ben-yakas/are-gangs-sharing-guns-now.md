title: Are Gangs Sharing Guns Now?

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="42310guns.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120516093548im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/42310guns.jpg" width="215" height="160" class="image-left"> </span>It seems that rival drug crews are not only <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120516093548/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/21/rival_drug_crew_harmony_on_the_rise.php">sharing lookouts and customers</a> (perhaps in homage to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120516093548/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TF23nDsZhDE">Stringer and Prop Joe&apos;s</a> Utopian vision of criminal enterprising)&#x2014;they&apos;re sharing weapons too! Police <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120516093548/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2010/04/23/2010-04-23_gangs_recycling_crime_guns.html">believe</a> that they&apos;ve noticed a new trend amongst gangs in NYC, with rivals sharing guns rather than heading out of state to restock their illegal firearms. </p>

<p>Cops point as an example to the big <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120516093548/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/17/queens_gang_takedown_unveils_bloods.php">Blood/Crips bust</a> last week, where they discovered a .380 caliber gun that was connected to four different shooters. &quot;<strong>Some of the [crews] didn&apos;t have a lot of guns, but they would just share a gun. They&apos;d pass that gun around</strong>,&quot; said Deputy Chief Robert Boyce, head of the NYPD&apos;s Gang Division. (It sounds like it&apos;s more efficient than the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120516093548/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/04/taxi_share_day_1_results_six_people.php">Taxi Share</a>.) The BBC <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120516093548/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/8451098.stm">reported</a> on a similar trend in England this past January.</p>

<p>Statistics back up the theory: the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120516093548/http://www.atf.gov/">Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms</a> traced 5,135 crime-linked guns recovered in the city last year, down from from 5,537 in 2008, 5,914 in 2007 and 7,059 in 2006. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120516093548/http://gothamist.com/2010/01/27/over_1000_guns_traded_for_cash_in_b.php">Guns For Cash</a> program has proven to be a hugely popular, removing more than 1,000 guns from the streets last month, and though murders are up slightly this year, only 43% of them involved guns, compared with 68% last year, according to Police Commissioner Ray Kelly.</p>

<p>Of course, Kelly couldn&apos;t let an opportunity pass without <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120516093548/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/19/city_council_honors_hate_crime_unit.php">advocating</a> some more for his beloved Stop-and-Frisk program, telling the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120516093548/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2010/04/23/2010-04-23_gangs_recycling_crime_guns.html">Daily News</a> the program limits the number of guns on NY streets: &quot;Quite frankly, they&apos;ll leave it home. If they&apos;re going to do something with it, they&apos;ll carry it for a specific time as opposed to carrying it all the time.&quot;</p>
