title: Why Give To Charity When You Can Send M. Night Back To Film School!

										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="41311mnight.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20140830021636im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/41311mnight.jpg" width="250" height="155" class="image-left"> </span>We think it&apos;s pretty safe to say that most people agree that our collective indulgence of director M. Night Shyamalan has gone too far. Some may argue when the fall happened (post <em>Sixth Sense</em>? Exactly 2/3 of the way into <em>Unbreakable</em>?), but we have yet to meet anyone who has anything nice to say about <em><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140830021636/http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/last_airbender/">The Last Airbender</a></em>. Finally, someone has gotten so fed up with Shyamalan&apos;s twist-filled, narcissistic brand of hokey cinema, they&apos;re trying to raise enough money to send him back to film school.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140830021636/http://mnightschool.org/">M. Night School</a> is trying to get 150,000 film lovers to donate $1 each &#x201C;so we can get him enrolled [at NYU Film School] before he starts principal photography on 1000 A.E.&#x201D; Shyamalan graduated from NYU&#x2019;s Tisch School of the Arts nearly two decades ago, but they think he could use another couple years (or decades) before being let loose with a camera and a one hundred million budget. The site has some downloadable stuff, and offers t-shirts (&quot;I helped send M. Night back to film school&quot;) and a &#x201C;Plot Twist Package&#x201D; (&quot;order a stapler only to find out it was a &quot;________&quot; the whole time!&quot;) for purchase. </p>

<p>They&apos;ve already raised nearly $350 as of this afternoon. They say they plan on taking the money and creating a scholarship in his name...but what if it turns out that M. Night was really behind all of this? He has been fueling his own backlash as a way to set the stage for a major comeback...but then it turns out his whole movie career is just a way of diverting attention from his true, dark secret...that he&apos;s a werewolf from the future?! </p>
