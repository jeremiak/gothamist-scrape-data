<p>Back in 2010, former Goldman Sachs vice president Cristina Chen-Oster and former Goldman associate Shanna Orlich filed a lawsuit against the billion dollar banking firm claiming widespread gender discrimination. Among other things, they called it &quot;a &#x2018;boy&#x2019;s club&#x2019; atmosphere, where binge drinking is common and women are either sexualized or ignored.&quot; And this week, Chen-Oster and Orlich <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140706161713/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2678094/Goldmans-boys-club-Women-accuse-bank-creating-culture-binge-drinking-strip-club-visits-seek-class-action-status-lawsuit.html">announced that</a> they are seeking class action status for their lawsuit.</p>

<p>The two women petitioned a Manhattan judge asking for the right to broaden their lawsuit to represent at least 1,762 female associates and vice-presidents at the firm since 2002. They say they have statements by &quot;former Goldman employees, expert statistical analyses and evidence of earnings and promotions from the firm&apos;s records to support their claims.&quot; Goldman sounded very unimpressed with the development: &quot;This is a normal and anticipated procedural step for any proposed class action lawsuit and does not change the case&#x2019;s lack of merit,&quot; David Wells, a Goldman Sachs spokesman, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140706161713/http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-07-01/goldman-sachs-boys-club-accused-of-mocking-women.html">told Bloomberg.</a></p>

<p>In the original suit, Chen-Oster and Orlich alleged that the company paid female vice presidents up to 21 percent less and female associates 8 percent less than male counterparts; women were promoted more slowly and reluctantly than men; and it was a generally hostile environment for women, where strip clubs were a frequent location for client meals.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140706161713/http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-07-02/a-lawsuit-peeks-inside-the-goldman-sachs-boys-club">In addition</a>, Chen-Oster says she was sexually assaulted by a male coworker at a staff dinner in 1997 and then discouraged from reporting it to human resources. &quot;If Goldman Sachs were a better place for women to work and I thought that I would not be treated differently from men, I would seek a career there,&quot; she wrote in the suit.</p>
