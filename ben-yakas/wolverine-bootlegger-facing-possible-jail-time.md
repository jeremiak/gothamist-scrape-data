										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="4611wolverine.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20140515040243im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/4611wolverine.jpg" width="250" height="188" class="image-left"> </span>Gilberto Sanchez is a very unlucky man: in 2009, he uploaded a bootleg version of the Hugh Jackman technicolor musical <em>X-Men Origins: Wolverine</em> on the internet, which was then downloaded a couple hundred times before being removed. It&apos;s the kind of thing that happens every day on torrent sites for just about every movie, but Sanchez made one grave error: he posted the &quot;work print&quot; (unfinished copy) of the movie more than a month before it was released. And now he could be facing up to three years in an adamantium jail.</p>

<p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m a scapegoat for this. I&#x2019;m gonna get crucified,&#x201D; Sanchez <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140515040243/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/13/nyregion/13wolverine.html">told the Times</a>. Sanchez bought the movie from an asian man selling bootlegs in his Parkchester neighborhood for five dollars. He couldn&apos;t believe how good the quality was, even though there were special effects and music missing: &#x201C;So we see a string pulling up Hugh Jackman,&#x201D; he shrugged later. 20th Century Fox, the studio behind the movie, which was a tentpole summer &quot;event&quot; film, was pissed&#x2014;the FBI tracked Sanchez down two weeks later, and he was arrested. As the News <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140515040243/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/bronx/2011/04/06/2011-04-06_pirate_of_penance_parkchester_man_faces_3_years_for_illegal_upload_of_wolverine.html">hilariously notes</a>, &quot;The mysterious Asian man remains at large.&quot;</p>

<p>Sanchez, a father of one whose parents live with him, pleaded guilty to violating U.S. copyright law last month, and will face sentencing in September; his punishment could range from probation, a slap on the wrist, to a maximum of three years in prison. Sanchez admits he made a &quot;stupid&quot; mistake, and he said he was motivated to post it because of &quot;some sort of Internet prestige thing.&quot; Despite the leak, <em>Wolverine</em> went on to gross over $350 million worldwide at the box office, which brings up another point&#x2014;that movie <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140515040243/http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/wolverine/">sucked</a> more than that time Cyclops abandoned his wife and baby to get back in touch with his ex-girlfriend who his wife was cloned from.</p>
