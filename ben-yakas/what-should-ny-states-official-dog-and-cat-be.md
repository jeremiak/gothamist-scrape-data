We have a fossil (sea scorpion), beverage (milk) and muffin (Apple Muffin). But you know what we don&apos;t have? We don&apos;t have an official man&apos;s best friend to represent us...but that might not be for too much longer.<p></p>

<p>Assemblyman Micah Kellner, an Upper East Side Democrat, and State Senator Joseph E. Robach, a Republican who represents Rochester, are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429093038/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/20/move-over-state-fish-to-make-room-for-a-state-dog/">introducing legislation</a> tomorrow to formally adopt a state dog. A spokesman for Kellner said he would choose a rescue dog, to symbolize the need for people to adopt pets from animal shelters and animal protection groups. They will make the formal announcement about the legislation tomorrow at City Hall, joined by therapy  dog <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429093038/http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100001029752461">Sarge Wolf-Stringer.</a></p>

<p>But you know what else NY State doesn&apos;t have? An official state cat! Hell, even Massachusetts has an official state cat (tabby). Any suggestions?
