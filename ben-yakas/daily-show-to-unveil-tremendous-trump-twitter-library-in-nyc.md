<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170401185201/http://gothamist.com/tags/donaldtrump">President Donald Trump</a> enjoys Tweeting from his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170401185201/https://www.google.com/amp/www.cnbc.com/amp/2017/03/29/donald-trump-apple-iphone-android-unsecured.html">Android or iPhone</a>. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170401185201/http://gothamist.com/tags/dailyshow">The Daily Show</a> has been making  fun of Trump for his Tweets for years&#x2014;and will now pay tribute by creating a library full of them.</p>

<p><em>The Daily Show Presents: The Donald J. Trump Presidential Twitter Library</em> will open in June somewhere in New York (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170401185201/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2017/03/29/trump-presidential-twitter-library-daily-show/">CBS says</a> it&apos;ll be in Manhattan, though there&apos;s nothing in the press release to confirm that just yet). What will be in the Twitter Library? All the tweets! How does one make tweets physical? I don&apos;t know! </p>

<p>The press release reads: &quot;The exhibit will feature a fully interactive and hands-on experience for hands of all sizes, giving patrons the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to memorialize and celebrate the many &apos;unpresidented&apos; moments of President Trump&#x2019;s Twitter history. More details to be announced later.&quot; Wait for details, no leaking details!</p>

<p>To show their enthusiasm, they launched a Twitter account just for the new venture. </p>

<p>If all that seems too high concept for you, well, you better clasp your sweaty palms over your eyes, because there&apos;s a Twitter account which solely features videos of a robot setting fire to print outs of Trump&apos;s Tweets:</p>
