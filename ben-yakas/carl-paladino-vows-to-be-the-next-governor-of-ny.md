<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="6410paladino.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20111014132955im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/6410paladino.jpg" width="250" height="140" class="image-left"> </span>You really can&apos;t keep a kook out of the kitchen: Republican Carl Paladino might have been stung by his poor showing at the GOP convention <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111014132955/http://gothamist.com/2010/06/02/republicans_pick_lazio_to_face_cuom.php">earlier this week</a>, but he has no interest in giving up the <strike>desperate</strike> good fight. The real estate mogul-<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111014132955/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/19/acccording_to_paladino_paladino_not.php">offensive email connoisseur</a> vowed to gather the 15,000 signatures needed to challenge Rick Lazio in a Republican primary. &quot;Today the real fight for reform begins...<strong>I&apos;m the only Republican who should be the next governor of New York. And I intend to be</strong>,&quot; he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111014132955/http://origin.ny1.com/content/top_stories/119728/paladino-continues-run-for-governor-as-blakeman-becomes-gop-senate-designee">said</a>, with Ahab-like intensity.</p>

<p>Paladino only received 7.5 percent of the votes at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111014132955/http://gothamist.com/2010/06/03/lazios_nomination_divides_ny_state.php">fractured</a> convention, coming in a distant third behind Lazio and former Democrat Steve Levy (but still ahead of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111014132955/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/24/post_145.php">Mermal!</a>). The Republican in-fighting has led to serious divisions; Paladino, a multi-millionaire, is closely-associated with the Tea Party, and plans on petitioning to create a Tea Party line. And he said he was willing to spend $500,000 to do so (to date, he&apos;s committed to spend nearly $10 million on his campaign, largely from his own funds). </p>

<p>Political observer Lee Miringoff of Marist College said Paladino could siphon votes from Lazio: <strong>&quot;I think it&apos;s a major distraction and possibly a very serious threat to Rick Lazio.&quot;</strong> Long Island Congressman Peter King agreed: &quot;We have 152 days to win this election. I want to spend all that time campaigning against the Democrats, not campaigning against each other.&quot; But Paladino can take comfort that he&apos;s got Erie County on his side: &quot;Even though Rick has become the nominee of the party, <strong>Erie County is going to stand with Carl Paladino,</strong>&quot; said Erie County Republican Chairman Nick Langworthy.</p>
