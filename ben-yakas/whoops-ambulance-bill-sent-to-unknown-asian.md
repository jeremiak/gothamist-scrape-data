title: Whoops: Ambulance Bill Sent To "Unknown Asian" 
---

	
										<p>Unless the FDNY were attempting to contact <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422202451/https://soundcloud.com/dj-unknown-asian">DJ Unknown Asian</a>, somebody made a serious mistake when they mailed out a letter to &quot;unknown Asian&quot; containing a $784.40 bill for an ambulance ride.</p>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>The FDNY sent out a demand for payment addressed to &quot;Unknown Asian&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422202451/http://t.co/hf23LtI5bG">http://t.co/hf23LtI5bG</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422202451/http://t.co/YjCsIzr3Pv">pic.twitter.com/YjCsIzr3Pv</a></p>&#x2014; New York Post (@nypost) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422202451/https://twitter.com/nypost/statuses/410867677620871168">December 11, 2013</a></blockquote>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422202451/http://nypost.com/2013/12/11/fdny-sends-ambulance-bill-to-unknown-asian/">According to the Post</a>, the bill was sent to someone at The New School&#x2019;s 2 W. 13th St. building on Tuesday. &#x201C;I hesitated to open it but then I was like, &#x2018;Well, I could be an unknown Asian,&#x2019;&#x201D; said Christine Ahn, 29, who works in the dean&#x2019;s office at Parsons The New School for Design. The bill is for a Nov. 1, 2013 emergency in which the patient was transported from an Associated Supermarket on 14th Street to Beth Israel Medical Center on First Avenue. </p>

<p>&quot;When I saw it said &apos;;unknown Asian,&apos; I thought it was racist,&quot; said fellow office assistant Chris Rivera. &quot;I showed it to Christine and her supervisor&#x2014;both of whom happen to be Asian&#x2014;and Christine thought it was sort of disrespectful and rude.&quot;</p>

<p>An FDNY source explained how the nomenclature came to be: someone was transported by EMS that day for a &quot;drug or intoxication&quot; issue, but could not be identified by name: &quot;A person accompanying them said the patient lived in a New School dorm so the EMS workers filled out the form with &apos;unknown&apos; for the first name and &apos;Asian&apos; for the last name, the source said.&quot;</p>

<p>The FDNY is now trying to avoid any such clerical errors happening in the future by not letting any bills be processed that have &quot;unknown&quot; in the name.  The FDNY was previously <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422202451/http://firelawblog.com/2013/09/lawsuit-accuses-fdny-of-discrimination-against-vietnamese-firefighter/">sued for racial discrimination</a> by a firefighter of Vietnamese descent a few months ago; they were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422202451/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/federal-court-overturns-ruling-fdny-intentionally-discriminated-minority-applicants-article-1.1343541">also unsuccessfully sued</a> by the Vulcan Society of black firefighters over racial practices in hiring.</p>
