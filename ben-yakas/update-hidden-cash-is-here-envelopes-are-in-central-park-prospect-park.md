<p><strong>[Update Below]</strong> For too long, New Yorkers have lived lives blissfully free of any &quot;anonymous social experiments for good.&quot; But today, all that changes: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506162653/http://gothamist.com/tags/HiddenCash">Hidden Cash</a> has revealed the location of their first NYC drop this weekend. It seems there are 40 envelopes, each filled with a $50 bill and a silver dollar, hidden in Central Park, likely near <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506162653/http://www.centralparknyc.org/things-to-see-and-do/attractions/pond.html">The Pond</a> at 59th Street and 5th Avenue. </p>

This is all about giving something back to the people, so make sure you Pay It Forward, which we believe is a legally binding term that requires anyone who finds the cash to give it to someone else, preferably someone who knows and/or is Haley Joel Osment. Hey, we don&apos;t make the rules.</p>

<p>Buzi claims there&apos;s no &quot;business motivation&quot; behind his little game, it&apos;s just an opportunity for families to come together, and also maybe for him to feel good about himself and enjoy pulling the strings from afar as humans frantically search for minuscule amounts of cash. But don&apos;t listen to us, we&apos;re just embittered because we didn&apos;t get to interview him first. </p>

<p>Anyway, we&apos;re pretty sure this is how Skynet really first started, so good luck out there!</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: Apparently, Central Park wasn&apos;t enough to sate the appetite of fortune cookie Willy Wonka: Hidden Cash has announced that there are 19 more envelopes hidden around Prospect Park, on the southwest side of Prospect Park road. If you like being the puppet in one wealthy person&apos;s pseudo-altruistic experiment, go forth and prosper.</p>
