<p>Last weekend, after learning all about Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department &quot;spokesman&quot; Pipo-kun, we <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150808124242/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/20/what_are_your_ideas_for_an_nypd_mas.php">asked you</a> for your ideas for an official NYPD mascot. And we got a lot of great suggestions and drawings, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150808124242/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/23/your_ideas_for_nycs_next_top_nypd_m.php#photo-1">including</a> The NYPD Policestopus, Officer Bully, and Texty the Traffic Cop. And it turns out that over at Fark, they took up our cause, and began <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150808124242/http://www.fark.com/comments/6048870/A-mascot-for-NYPD-Let-Fark-handle-it?cpp=1">their own thread</a> for pictures for an NYPD mascot. </p>

<p>Some of their highlights include Stanley StoppenFrisk, a rat with a badge, Kickback Pigeon, Steamy the Steamroller, and the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man from <em>Ghostbusters</em>.  And reader <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150808124242/http://www.theadamcomic.com/">Matt Lubchansky</a> sent in the above picture of Police Lt. Snack Bauer, who is really doing his part to put a positive face on the NYPD in between bathroom breaks.</p>
