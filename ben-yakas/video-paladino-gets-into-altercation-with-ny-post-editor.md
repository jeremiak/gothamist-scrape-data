And so it was yesterday in Lake George when Paladino <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140428063825/http://www.nydailynews.com/blogs/dailypolitics/2010/09/breaking-carl-paladino-gets-in.html">got into an altercation</a> during a Q and A with Post State Editor <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140428063825/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fredric_U._Dicker">Fred Dicker</a>. Dicker wanted to see evidence for claims Paladino made <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140428063825/http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0910/42912.html">in an interview with Politco</a> that Cuomo had cheated on his wife; Paladino shot back that he wasn&apos;t happy with the way Dicker and the Post have been reporting on his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140428063825/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/26/paladinos_wife.php">love child</a>. &quot;<strong>I want to know why you sent your goons after my daughter, Fred. You send another goon to my daughter&apos;s house and I&apos;ll take you out, buddy!</strong>&quot; Paladino yelled (you can see the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140428063825/http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/video/tea-party-candidate-carl-paladino-scuffles-with-reporter-fred-dicker-11764184">video from ABC</a> below).</p>

<p>Paladino&apos;s campaign managing-attack dog Michael Caputo separated the two, and sent Paladino to the men&apos;s room to calm down, while he confronted Dicker: &#x201C;Fred, you&#x2019;re out of line, you&#x2019;re off the Christmas card list.&#x201D; (a reference to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140428063825/http://capitaltonight.com/2010/09/joy-behar-is-off-carls-christmas-list/">criticism from <em>The View</em></a> earlier this week). Caputo and Dicker have an uncomfortable stand-off; Caputo accuses Dicker of working for Cuomo, calling him a &quot;terrible journalist&quot; and &quot;such a biased person.&quot; Dicker eventually leaves, and Paladino reappears to finish the Q and A, referring to the confrontation: <strong>&quot;I don&apos;t send bird dogs to do my dirty work.&quot; </strong></p>

<p>Politicians are fond of using euphemisms such as &quot;slinging mud&quot; to insult their opponents, but if you ever wanted to know what it really looked like, here it is in all it&apos;s grainy cellphone glory.</p>
