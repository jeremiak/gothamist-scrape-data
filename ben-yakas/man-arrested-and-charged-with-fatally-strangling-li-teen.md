<p>An 18-year-old man <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131006173341/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/cops-hunt-teen-killer-article-1.1436343">has been arrested and charged</a> with murdering a young woman on Long Island this week. Maxwell Sherman has been charged with second-degree murder in connection with the death of 18-year-old Lauren Daverin, whose nude body was found on a Rockville Centre footbridge on Thursday. Sherman, who allegedly strangled and beat Daverin to death, also gave a bizarre television interview at the scene of the crime before his bust. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131006173341/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/man_held_in_nassau_teen_slay_eaMFs6dxwPeRKS55dddODK">According to the Post,</a> Sherman told the cameras, &quot;I&apos;m amazed.&quot;</p>

<p>Daverin had been out with friends on the bridge Thursday evening when they left her alone for about an hour. &#x201C;I left her to hang out with other people, then I came back to see if she was still here,&#x201D; David Paiz <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131006173341/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2013/08/24/suspect-charged-in-slaying-of-young-woman-in-rockville-centre/">told CBS</a>. &#x201C;I came back and saw her dead body so I called 911.&#x201D; &#x201C;She was completely naked, and she only had her boots on, and she was just thrown there,&#x201D; his brother, Eric Paiz, added. </p>

<p>It&apos;s unknown whether Sherman and Daverin knew each other before that night. Sherman, who is an unemployed recent high school graduate who lives with his parents, is considered a flight risk, and is being held without bail until his next court date on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Friends described Daverin as a fun-loving &quot;wild child&quot; who loved to dance and hang out at the footbridge: &#x201C;I just started crying. And that&#x2019;s when it hit me that my best friend was really gone,&#x201D; Laura Barabasch said. &#x201C;The bridge we hang out on is a real fun place. I&#x2019;ll come back here to remember her and all the good times we shared,&#x201D; she said. </p>

<p>Daverin&apos;s family has set up <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131006173341/https://www.facebook.com/pages/RIP-Lauren-Daverin/352507004886823">an online eulogy page on Facebook</a>, where an older sister posted: &quot;Every part of my heart is broken and I cannot wait to meet you again in another life and make sure I appreciate every hug and every kiss and every fight. RIP baby, I&apos;m so sorry I have to write this on Facebook instead of telling you to your face.&quot;<br>
