<p>It&apos;s been a long and unlikely road, but we are now just two weeks away from binge-watching the all-new season of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405013108/http://gothamist.com/tags/arresteddevelopment"><em>Arrested Development</em></a>. And tonight, Netflix is giving us our first extended look at it with the first trailer. All the family&apos;s back, and no one really has aged all that much&#x2014;and there&apos;s a wayward ostrich, &quot;The Final Countdown,&quot; and the stair car. &quot;With this car, you might get some stares,&quot; Michael Bluth is told. &quot;I&apos;m used to a car with&#xFEFF; stairs.&quot;</p>

<p>And don&apos;t forget that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405013108/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/10/arrested_developments_frozen_banana_1.php">Bluth&#x2019;s Original Frozen Banana Stand will be coming</a> to America tomorrow&#x2014;it&apos;ll be located  diagonally across from Radio City Music Hall from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. The stand will be giving out free frozen bananas, you&apos;ll be able to take photos inside of it, and some cast members might show up on the Orange Carpet as well. No touching, though.</p>
