<p>A wealthy Upper East Side couple are suing the Cathedral School of St. John the Divine for $415K after they say the school got them to bid on a 30-by-30-inch finger painting by a classroom of kindergartners, rigged the auction, and stuck them with a $50K bill for it. And this very well may be the epitome of rich people problems.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150924025842/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/feelingbidder_bNie678FebHbCaXhiDKnaN">According to the Post</a>, socialite Michelle Heinemann and her investment-banker husband Jon say in the lawsuit that their son, Hudson Cornelius Heinemann, was &#x201C;underappreciated&#x201D; there. &#x201C;Plaintiff&#x2019;s son was consistently left out of school exhibits and films...and was made to go last at nearly everything,&#x201D; the lawsuit states. </p>

<p>Even more ghastly, &#x201C;On one occasion, plaintiffs&#x2019; 5-year-old son was relegated to the role of &#x2018;door-holder&#x2019; and ordered to hold the door for all of the other students.&#x201D; Look, if the Heinemanns wanted their kid to &quot;build humility,&quot; they&apos;d have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150924025842/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/05/magazine/is-avenues-the-best-education-money-can-buy.html?pagewanted=all">sent him to The Avenues.</a> </p>

<p>School administrators allegedly promised to cease all door-holding labors for young Hudson Cornelius if the Heinemann&apos;s gave some donations (including $6K worth of &#x201C;designer clothing items&#x201D; to the auction) and if &#x201C;renowned artist&#x201D; Michelle Heinemann helped Hudson&#x2019;s class create a sellable work of art for the auction. </p>

<p>The Heinemanns agreed to put in the winning bid for the finished finger painting for $3K, but they claim the school had a first-grade teacher named &#x201C;Ms. Bryant&#x201D; drive the bid up to &#x201C;the outrageous sum of $50,000.&#x201D; So the Heinemanns have since pulled Hudson out of the school, and are now demanding compensation for all of the attending costs, including $20,000 tuition to a new school, forfeited class fees for his little sister Hyacinth Cornelia, and Hudson&#x2019;s $60,000-a-year chauffeur. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, does anyone know the German word for &quot;slamming your head against a metal pole to end the pain?&quot;</p>
