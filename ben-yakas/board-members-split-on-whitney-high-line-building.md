										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:250px; "> <img alt="41210whitney.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503150243im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/41210whitney.jpg" width="250" height="144"> <br> <i>The proposed High Line Whitney building</i></div> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503150243/http://gothamist.com/2009/10/12/whitney.php">Expectations were high</a> in the fall that a second downtown branch of the Whitney Museum would finally come to fruition after a few years of limbo, amidst reports that the museum was forging ahead with plans to construct a Renzo Piano-designed building at the entrance of the High Line. Today, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503150243/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/12/arts/design/12museum.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">news comes out</a> that it might have been presumptuous expecting a resolution had come.<p></p>

<p>According to the Times, there has been a split among the 45-member Whitney board of directors as to how exactly to use the $131 million <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503150243/http://gothamist.com/2008/03/19/whitney_museum_1.php">donation</a> given by cosmetics heir Leonard A. Lauder, the biggest donation in the museum&apos;s history.  Although the majority of the board are gung-ho about the High Line building, others don&apos;t think the museum can afford to operate two sites. Lauder himself is supposedly a vocal opponent to the second site, which he views as a vanity project. </p>

<p>The museum currently has over 18,000 works in its collection, but can only display 150 at a time at its current home on the Upper East Side. Co-chairwoman of the board Brooke Garber Neidich said, &#x201C;This isn&#x2019;t just the Whitney dreaming again,&#x201D; and insists the museum can afford it and plans are moving forward; but Gilbert C. Maurer, a longtime board member and former president, said: <strong>&#x201C;This is like the politicians who love to build bridges but hate to paint them</strong>...it&#x2019;s probably possible to build a building. The challenge is how are you going to operate it. And that&#x2019;s worrisome.&#x201D; </p>
