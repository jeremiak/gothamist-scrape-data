<p>There&apos;s a damn good reason why the Comedy Cellar was at the top of our list of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424160448/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/20/best_places_to_catch_comedy_in_nyc.php">favorite comedy clubs</a> in the city&#x2014;it&apos;s the only place where you&apos;re liable to see Chris Rock AND Dave Chappelle perform onstage together on a Tuesday night. And that&apos;s exactly what happened after midnight early this morning, as you can see from the photo above. </p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="22713chappelle.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424160448im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/22713chappelle.jpeg" width="640" height="480"> <br> <i> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424160448/https://twitter.com/MARLONLWAYANS/status/306694388032106496">marlon wayans</a></i></div> <p></p>

<p>The two reportedly did over an hour of standup on stage together&#x2014;Marlon Wayans also joined them for part of the set, it seems (he tweeted the photo above). Chappelle&#x2014;who has been a hard man to find in the last few years&#x2014;also flaunted conventions by smoking cigarettes in the club. If anyone can get away with it, it&apos;s him.</p>

<p>This is as good a time as any to point out that <em>Chappelle&apos;s Show</em> is now ten years old (just like Gothamist). <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424160448/http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/8847357/a-battle-best-chappelle-show-sketch-ever">Grantland had a highly amusing piece</a> in which one super-fan tried to figure out its greatest sketch. In case you&apos;ve forgotten how great the show was, just purify yourself in the waters of Lake Minnetonka.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424160448/http://thecomicscomic.com/2013/02/27/dreaming-up-a-real-comedy-show-with-chris-rock-and-dave-chappelle/">Comic&apos;s Comic has some more details</a> about the evening, including the fact that Rock and Chappelle were on stage for about 40 minutes (Wayans joined them for about 15 minutes), and joked about starting a podcast together, or going on tour together. Here&apos;s one highlights:</p>

<blockquote> Chappelle convinced Rock to text Jay-Z at around 1:30 a.m. After a lack of a reply, they called Arsenio Hall and left a voice-mail message; then later the same for Lenny Kravitz.

<p>&quot;This could be the show,&quot; Chappelle said. &quot;Fireside chats with Chris Rock.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I&apos;m in,&quot; Rock replied.</p>

<p>So are we.</p>

<p>Rock joked that he needs time to prepare for an actual tour, stand-up or otherwise, before committing. &quot;Dave&apos;s like, let&apos;s just do it Wednesday. Unannounced!&quot; he said.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: A reader was also at the show last night, and she sent in the above photo along with another account of it:</p>

<blockquote>Chappelle showed up first right before the end of the last show and went up onstage. Chris Rock showed up shortly after and stood in the back watching his set. Neither knew either were going to be there. Chris surprised Dave by walking onstage and the two did an amazing show together. At one point during the show Chris Rock went through his phone and texted Jay-Z and then tried phoning Lenny Kravitz and Arsenio Hall from onstage. Marlon Wayans showed up for the last 30 min of their set. I&apos;ve seen the two comedians do sets back to back at the Cellar before but never together. It was one for the books. Great night.</blockquote>
