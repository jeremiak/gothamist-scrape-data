<p>We&apos;re only a few weeks away from the premiere of season three of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170919155128/http://gothamist.com/tags/bettercallsaul"><em>Better Call Saul</em></a>, the best show on TV about the origins of a two-bit lawyer that is also deeply educational on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170919155128/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkZ15zBcJTU">&apos;Chicago Sunroofs.&apos;</a> The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170919155128/http://gothamist.com/tags/breakingbad"><em>Breaking Bad</em></a> prequel is set to welcome the Chicken Man himself, Gus Fring, onto the show this year, and in his honor, you&apos;ll be able to visit Fring&apos;s fictional chicken restaurant Los Pollos Hermanos at a two day pop-up in Manhattan.</p>

<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170919155128if_/https://www.youtube.com/embed/e_3WzxpdUc0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>According <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170919155128/http://ny.eater.com/2017/3/28/15096138/los-pollos-hermanos-breaking-bad-better-call-saul-nyc">to Eater</a>, the event is happening April 9th and 10th at 243 Pearl Street, just in time for the Monday, April 10th premiere of <em>Saul</em>. Los Pollos has already popped up in Austin <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170919155128/http://laist.com/2017/03/28/los_pollos_hermanos.php">and LA</a>. The menu displays rancheros plates, breakfast tacos, burritos, and burgers, but they are reportedly only serving curly fries, water, and three dipping sauces&#x2014;but NOT fried chicken.</p>

<p>This is the second BB-related restaurant to show up in NYC, after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170919155128/http://gothamist.com/2016/09/13/breaking_bad_coffee_shop.php#photo-1">Walter&apos;s Coffee Roastery</a> started manufacturing cold brew in Bushwick last fall.</p>

<p>In season two, <em>Saul</em> was funnier (Hoboken Squat Cobbler!), more comfortable with its <em>Breaking Bad</em> roots (Mike&apos;s one man war against the Salamancas), and more tragic (everything involving Chuck and Jimmy&apos;s long-simmering family feud), and we expect it to only continue its ascent in season three&#x2014;which is why it&apos;s one of our <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170919155128/http://laist.com/2017/03/21/spring_2017_tv_guide.php">most anticipated shows</a> of the spring. We hope Kim continues to get more of the spotlight, and we can&apos;t wait to see the long-awaited <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170919155128/http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2017/03/17/inside-breaking-bad-villain-gus-fring-s-explosive-return-to-better-call-saul.html">return of Fring</a>: &quot;Gus is more Gus than Jimmy is Saul, but he&#x2019;s still got a ways to go,&#x201D; Bob Odenkirk said recently. &quot;One of the big stories of season three is him progressing to who he became in <em>Breaking Bad.</em>&quot;</p>
