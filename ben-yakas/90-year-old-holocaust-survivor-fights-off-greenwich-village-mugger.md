<p>A 90-year-old Holocaust survivor successfully fought off a would-be robber in Greenwich Village this week. Gina Zuckerman was walking to a senior center near Fifth Avenue and West 12th Street around noon Tuesday when a woman grabbed her from behind and tried to take her purse. &quot;She pushed me to the ground,&quot; Zuckerman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110091246/http://nypost.com/2016/09/28/grandma-stands-ground-against-purse-snatcher/">told the Post</a>. &quot;She cursed at me: &apos;You stupid idiot! You moron!&apos;&quot;</p>

<p>The mugger threw Zuckerman to the ground and wrestled with her. &#x201C;I was scared,&#x201D; Zuckerman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110091246/http://nypost.com/2016/09/28/grandma-stands-ground-against-purse-snatcher/">added</a>. &quot;She was a little taller than me, and bigger. I did everything I could to defend myself. But I didn&#x2019;t hurt her &#x2014; she hurt me. She dug her nails into my arm and made me bleed.&quot; As they fought, passersby approached, but the suspect lied and said she was Zuckerman&apos;s home health aide. When two cops approached, the suspect fled, leaving Zuckerman on the pavement. </p>

<p>&quot;I would have gladly given her $5&quot; had the mugger just asked, Zuckerman said, noting she only had $10 on her that day anyway. &quot;But I was not going to be beaten for it.&quot; Zuckerman was treated for cuts to her right arm and right middle finger at Mount Sinai Beth Israel. The suspect was last seen wearing a black tank top, red pants, black shoes and carrying a black purse.</p>

<p>Zuckerman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110091246/https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20160929/greenwich-village/greenwich-village-purse-snatcher-90-year-old-woman-fought-fights">told DNAInfo</a> that she worked for 28 years in advertising on Madison Avenue; she also discussed surviving six years of forced labor in Germany, and her plans to vote for Hillary Clinton for president over Donald Trump: &quot;I don&apos;t like the things he says,&quot; she said. &quot;I don&apos;t like rude men. Enough rude men.&quot;</p>
