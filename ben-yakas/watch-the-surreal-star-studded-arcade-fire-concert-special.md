<p>After they <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502140035/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/29/videos_arcade_fire_unveil_new_disco.php">performed two new tunes</a> on SNL last night, Arcade Fire unveiled a 22 minute music/comedy special, &#x201C;Here Comes the Night Time,&#x201D; which was directed by Roman Coppola. They played three more excellent new songs (dance-happy &quot;Here Comes The Night Time,&quot; new wave-y &quot;We Exist,&quot; and the especially awesome Talking Heads-influenced &quot;Normal People&quot;) intermixed with some truly surreal comedy bits from the likes of Aziz Ansari, Eric Wareheim, Bill Hader, Zach Galifinakis, Bono, Ben Stiller, James Franco, and Rainn Wilson. And you can now watch it in full below!</p>

<p>Jason Schwartzman also turned up as a centaur and Michael Cera showed up as a shit-talking bartender who mocked Mumford and Sons. Overall, it was a weird, much welcomed special that could have fit in on Adult Swim&#x2014;even if it doesn&apos;t quite make sense why they did this now, and not closer to the release date of their album (which comes out at the end of October). </p>
