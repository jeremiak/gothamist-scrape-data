<p>The Boston Police Department said today that three new suspects have been taken into custody in connection with the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604105221/http://gothamist.com/tags/bostonmarathon">Boston marathon bombing</a> that left three people dead and wounded over 150 more. The BPD <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604105221/https://twitter.com/Boston_Police/status/329612972521558016">made the announcement</a> just after 11 a.m. this morning. The Boston Globe reports that the three suspects <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604105221/https://twitter.com/BostonGlobe/status/329614234252091392">have been arrested</a>; more details will be released soon, and we will update as soon as the information comes in.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604105221/https://twitter.com/katywithawhy/status/329616930510094336">CBS says they&apos;ve confirmed</a> that the &quot;three suspects were arrested for harboring/aiding the bombing suspects after the fact. These will be federal charges.&quot; The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604105221/http://www.boston.com/metrodesk/2013/05/01/three-additional-people-taken-into-custody-boston-marathon-bombings/dhLzU1e5vfbuhxyjWlBOSP/story.html">Globe adds</a> that all three are college students; according <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604105221/https://twitter.com/BostonGlobe/status/329618560244670464">to their source</a>, all three were connected to suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev at UMass Dartmouth and helped him after the fact.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong>: BPD <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604105221/http://www.bpdnews.com/2013/05/01/update-boston-marathon-investigation/">released a statement</a> noting that there was no threat to public safety, with few other details. But <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604105221/https://twitter.com/nbcnightlynews/status/329622772504473600">NBC is now</a> reporting that the three suspects are Dzhokhar&apos;s college roommates, which hasn&apos;t been confirmed by police yet. In an article <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604105221/http://www.southcoasttoday.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20130422/NEWS/304220318">from South Coast Today</a>, one classmate was quoted as saying Dzhokar didn&apos;t seem to be close with a roommate:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;Him and his roommate didn&apos;t seem to talk much,&quot; said Pine Dale resident Tuyen Nguyen, of Worcester, who lived two doors down from Tsarnaev&apos;s third-floor room and often saw him spend time with a group of fellow Russian-speakers. &quot;I&apos;d see him once a week and we&apos;d never really talk.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>But Dzhokar <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604105221/http://www.itemlive.com/articles/2013/04/19/news/anews00.txt">also allegedly texted</a> the roommate at some point after the bombing: &quot;Hey, you can have all my stuff. I&apos;m going to leave the country.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> The three University of Massachusetts Dartmouth students arrested today have now been identified: Azamat Tazhayakov and Dias Kadyrbayev, both 19, were charged with conspiracy to obstruct justice by plotting to dispose of a laptop computer and a backpack containing fireworks belonging to suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the US attorney&#x2019;s office said in a statement. Robel Phillipos, 19, was charged with making false statements to law enforcement officials in a terrorism investigation, prosecutors said. </p>

<p>On April 19th, three days after the bombing, the three men allegedly removed Tsarnaev&#x2019;s backpack, which contained fireworks that had been opened and emptied of gunpowder, from his dormitory room. They told authorities they threw the backpack and fireworks in the trash &#x201C;because they did not want to get Tsarnaev into trouble.&#x201D;</p>
