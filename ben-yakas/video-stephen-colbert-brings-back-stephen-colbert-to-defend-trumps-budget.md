<p>The real <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170324030554/http://gothamist.com/tags/stephencolbert">Stephen Colbert</a> thinks Trump&apos;s proposed budget&#x2014;which includes cuts to the EPA, Meals on Wheels, and other programs that benefit the poor and elderly&#x2014;is heartless, but he brought on his favorite fiscally conservative pundit to defend the plan: &apos;Stephen Colbert.&apos; And he brought with him another classic segment of &quot;The Werd&quot;: &quot;The primary goal of Trump&apos;s budget is not driving Cheetos to grandpa after he gets the munchies from his glaucoma pot,&quot; this Colbert asserted. &quot;It&apos;s defending America. And these food-addicted seniors haven&apos;t killed any members of ISIS.&quot;</p>

<p>This Colbert defended Office of Management and Budget director Mick Mulvaney&#x2019;s comments that the Trump budget is &quot;compassionate&quot; to taxpayers: &quot;Yes, you can&#x2019;t just focus on helping the needy and forget the people whose taxes pay for it,&quot; he said. &quot;That&#x2019;s like praying for the accident victim who needed a transfusion and forgetting about the guy who&#x2019;s walking around a pint light now. Give that guy a cookie!&quot;</p>

<p>As for Meals on Wheels (&quot;Yes, it&apos;s called Meals on Wheels, but how often do you see a hamburger driving down the highway?&quot;), he argued, &quot;Folks, I know what you&apos;re saying...they brought food to the elderly. Well, technically, yes...and we all know what happens to food after we eat it: we are literally throwing money down the toilet.&quot;</p>

<p>Colbert ended the segment with a nod to his viewers: &quot;My real worry here is that a lot of people might go to house.gov and find out how to call their Congressman and tell them to protect kids and old people,&quot; he said.</p>

<p>Colbert also introduced a new segment: Steve Bannon&apos;s bathtub musings, including, &quot;Birth control turns women into werewolves.&quot; It&apos;s <em>not</em> NSFW, but it&apos;s not exactly safe for your blood pressure. </p>
