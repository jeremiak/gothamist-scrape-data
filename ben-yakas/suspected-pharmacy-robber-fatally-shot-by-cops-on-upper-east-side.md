<p>A robbery suspect was fatally shot by cops today in upper Manhattan. According to police, the incident happened just after 2 p.m. when the unidentified suspect robbed HealthSource Pharmacy on 96th Street and 2nd Avenue on the Upper East Side. The suspect was tracked down by cops and confronted at a service road near the FDR Drive on 96th Street, where &quot;rounds were fired&quot; and the suspect was killed.</p>

<p>Initial reports <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140518230143/https://twitter.com/DeanMeminger/status/467375739965169664">suggest</a> that the robber had been given a fake prescription pill bottle that had a GPS tracker in it, which is how cops were able to find him so quickly. An NYPD spokesperson could not confirm that report, but they said the investigation is still ongoing. Four officers were taken to Cornell Hospital with minor injuries.</p>
