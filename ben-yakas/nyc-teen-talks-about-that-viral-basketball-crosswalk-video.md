<p>There&apos;s a pretty good chance that at some point this week, the video below popped up in your Twitter feed. In it, a man dribbles a basketball across 23rd Street near Madison Square Park; a teen, seemingly at random, challenges him, and wipes out after he pulls a devastating crossover move. The whole thing seemed like such a perfect moment, I was 100% convinced it had been staged&#x2014;the fact that there&apos;s a dude standing completely still in the middle of this chaos only bolstered my belief that this was a YouTube prank or something terrible like that.  </p>

<p>But I&apos;m happy to report that I was <em>partially</em> wrong: it turns out that the dribbler in question, 31-year-old Jahmani Swanson, was out on the streets filming interactions with real New Yorkers for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170101163628/https://whistlesports.com/">Whistle Sports</a>, when 15-year-old Gillian Jordan was recruited to get in on the action. The 4-foot-5 Swanson, who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170101163628/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/12/29/-jahmani-swanson_n_6390982.html">has been dubbed</a> &quot;the Michael Jordan of dwarf basketball,&quot; posted the other angle of the video on his Instagram yesterday:</p>

<p>The video which Jordan posted was taken by her cousin Matthew Geissler. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170101163628/http://www.teenvogue.com/story/teenage-girl-goes-viral-jahmani-swanson-face-off">She told Teen Vogue</a> that they had been eating at Eataly when they saw Swanson filming, and someone asked if they wanted to be in the video. &quot;They told us to go on the other side of 23rd Street and go on the crosswalk. Jahmani came up to me and crossed me up. I was trying to defend him and I accidentally slipped onto the street,&quot; she said. &quot;There were cars honking at us and looking at us like we were crazy because I had just fallen on the street. A lady next to me ran over with a kid in her arms and asked me if I was okay. The other people on the crosswalk and surrounding areas were laughing.&quot;</p>

<p>Despite her fall being viewed million of times over online, she was pretty upbeat: &quot;I think this whole thing is really cool and I&apos;d never expect it to happen to me,&quot; she added. &quot;It&apos;s quite awesome, and I&apos;m glad everyone finds it funny. My mom was on Facebook this morning and saw the video posted, and it had over 2 million views! But Jahmani, the guy who broke my ankles, was really nice about it.&quot; </p>

<p>[<em>Note: in case you were wondering, it doesn&apos;t appear as though she literally broke her ankles, but rather broke them in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170101163628/http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=broken%20ankles">Urban Dictionary sense.</a></em>]</p>
