										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="82416flight.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108034010im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/82416flight.jpg" width="640" height="427" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>A decent <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108034010/http://gothamist.com/tags/timelapse">timelapse video</a> comes with a promise: time is malleable with the right tools, whether you are watching <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108034010/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/03/watch_the_snow_accumulate_with_bliz.php">a blizzard accumulate</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108034010/http://gothamist.com/2016/07/03/video_glide_blissfully_across_the_e.php">a boardwalk roll on for miles</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108034010/http://gothamist.com/2014/04/10/watch_an_entire_episode_of_saturday.php">an episode of SNL</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108034010/http://gothamist.com/2015/11/08/video_how_to_make_an_award-winning.php">an award-winning beard being sculpted</a>. Fast-forwarding through all the tedious stuff can offer a new perspective on something you&apos;ve seen a thousand times&#x2014;like say an airplane landing at LaGuardia Airport. </p>

<p>A pilot took the timelapse video below of flying over Manhattan before coming to land at LGA, and it turns out that once it is slightly sped-up, the whole process looks straight out of a video game. This is certainly more exciting than the ever-more realistic <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108034010/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPaUKisoozY">flight simulator games out there.</a></p>
