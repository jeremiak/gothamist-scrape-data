<p>For anyone with a set of working eyes, the 1985 music video for Mick Jagger and David Bowie&apos;s campy cover of Motown classic &quot;Dancing In The Street&quot; is a work of art on the same level as Caravaggio&apos;s &apos;The Beheading of Saint John the Baptist,&apos; Ingmar Bergman&apos;s five+ hours long <em>Fanny And Alexander</em>, or those Dr. Zizmor subway ads. If you&apos;re the sort of person who has ever thought that the Mona Lisa sure would have been better with some <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160127032915/http://www.amazon.com/elope-335030-Elope-Groucho-Black/dp/B00412WY5C">Groucho glasses</a>, then you&apos;ll appreciate the fact that Mario Wienerroither has improved upon perfection&#x2014;by stripping out the music from the video and leaving behind the foot taps, grunts and water-gulping we always knew was there underneath it all. </p>

<p>Wienerroither has made a habit of stripping the music from videos and replacing them with hilarious silly sounds&#x2014;you can watch <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160127032915/https://www.youtube.com/user/digitalofen/videos">some of his previous videos here</a>, including revisions of Queen&apos;s &quot;I Want To Break Free,&quot; Prodigy&apos;s &quot;Firestarter,&quot; and Shakira&apos;s &quot;Cant Remember To Forget.&quot; In the meantime, enjoy the full version of the original full-jumpsuit version of &quot;Dancing In The Streets&quot; below.</p>
