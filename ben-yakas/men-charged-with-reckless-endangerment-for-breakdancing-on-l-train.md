<p>At the start of 2014, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150303143543/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/02/two_men_charged_with_reckless_endan.php">two men were arrested for breakdancing</a> on a crowded A train, which sparked a debate about the subway etiquette of breakdancing. Several people complained about breakdancers on the L train, and clearly cops have been reading the comments: two more men were arrested for breakdancing on a crowded <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150303143543/http://gothamist.com/tags/ltrain">L train</a> at rush hour. </p>

<p>According to police, 20-year-old Xavier Fowler and a 17-year-old whose name hasn&apos;t been released were arrested last Wednesday around 6 p.m. on the L train near Union Square for breakdancing. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150303143543/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20140326/union-square/men-arrested-for-break-dancing-on-l-train-police-say">DNAInfo reports</a>, they were &quot;blasting music and swinging their arms and feet near passengers&apos; heads.&quot;</p>

<p>Back in January, police said the two men charged for breakdancing had &quot;caused a hazard to themselves and others around them, and made excessive noise by blaring music from a stereo.&quot; Fowler and his accomplice were both charged with reckless endangerment (although Fowler&apos;s charge was reduced to disorderly conduct). </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150303143543/http://gothamist.com/2014/03/25/nypd_now_cracking_down_on_subway_ve.php">As we reported yesterday</a>, arrests of subway vendors have increased more than 80 percent since last March; panhandler and vendor arrests were up 174 percent from this time last year.</p>

<p>Let this serve as another reminder that if you feel the urge to throw self-consciousness to the wind and jerk your body in rhythm while navigating our mass transit system, stick to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150303143543/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/03/everybody_dance_now_videos_of_peopl.php">doing it on the platform a fair distance away from the edge.</a> The only physical movement we want to see on a train is synchronized leg kicks.</p>
