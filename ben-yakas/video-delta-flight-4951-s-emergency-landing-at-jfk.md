Sparks flew as flight attendants told passengers, &quot;Heads down! Heads down!&quot; (you can see video taken by passenger Alessandro Albero below) None of the 60 passengers or three crew members were injured in the landing.<p></p>

<p>Flight 4951, operated by Atlantic Southeast Airlines, was a connection flight headed from Atlanta to White Plains. The crew realized around 8 pm Saturday that the jet&apos;s right wheel was jammed in the up position. The flight was quickly re-routed to land at JFK (you can read the full transcript of the pilot talking to the control tower <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140407091152/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/09/26/2010-09-26_64_souls_and_3000_gallons_of_fuel_head_for_runway_31.html">here</a>), making the landing with only two of its three sets of landing gear. Passenger Jamie Pfeiffer said, &quot;I could feel the vibration, I could feel it bumping&quot; as the wing scraped the runway, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140407091152/http://www.lohud.com/article/20109260410">according to LoHud</a>. &quot;I heard a guy behind me say he saw sparks. The pilot was just awesome,&quot; he added.</p>

<p>As can be seen in photos in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140407091152/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/queens/sparks_fly_as_jet_crash_lands_at_hhbKXOeceSWCJHVArp13TN">the Post</a>, the right plane of the wing virtually detached from the airplane after the incident. &quot;<strong>It was better than the Hudson</strong>,&quot; the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140407091152/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/09/26/2010-09-26_64_souls_and_3000_gallons_of_fuel_head_for_runway_31.html">pilot said</a>, referring to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140407091152/http://gothamist.com/tags/flight1549">U.S. Airways Flight 1549</a>, which made an emergency landing into the Hudson River in January 2009.</p>
