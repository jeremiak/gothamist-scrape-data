<p>A man was run over and dragged by another driver in a road rage incident in Queens just after midnight on Wednesday. Police say that the 29-year-old male victim had just parked his car and was exiting it near 99th Street when the driver of a GMC 1500 Series Sierra pick-up truck (see photo above) was trying to pass and the incident happened. </p>

<p>Apparently the driver couldn&apos;t get by, and a verbal argument between the two men ensued. The pick-up truck driver bumped into the victim, then accelerated more and ran him over, dragging him several feet before fleeing the scene at 101st Avenue. The victim was taken to Jamaica Hospital with abdominal and back injuries, as well as several abrasions.</p>

<p>Anyone with information in regards to this incident is asked to call the NYPD&apos;s Crime Stoppers Hotline at 800-577-TIPS.
