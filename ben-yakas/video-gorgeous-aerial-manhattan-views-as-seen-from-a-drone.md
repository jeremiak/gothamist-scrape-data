<p>Earlier this month, we took some <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502194010/http://gothamist.com/2014/04/05/videos_take_a_helicopter_tour_over.php">helicopter tours of the city</a> to get a gander at the beautiful jagged skyline of car keys. Now here&apos;s another chance to get an aerial perspective of Manhattan&#x2014;this time you can see what the city looks like to a humble <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502194010/http://gothamist.com/tags/drones">drone.</a> The visuals are pretty neat, and it works even better if you mute the extremely irritating music.</p>
