<p>Police executing a search warrant on an unrelated matter in a Brooklyn housing project apartment discovered and confiscated a bizarre exotic animal zoo. Animal Care and Control removed six snakes (one boa constrictor and five pythons), two bearded dragons, two alligators, one gecko, one scorpion and one tarantula from 1625 Dean Street  in the Weeksville Houses at 1:30 p.m. Friday.</p>

<p>It is illegal to have exotic animals inside of public housing projects, according to police. Most of the animals were being kept in fishtanks. Cops didn&apos;t say what the initial search warrant was for. No one was at home during the search though, and no arrests have been made in relation to either the animals or the search warrant.
