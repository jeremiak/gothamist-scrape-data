<p>Open your eyes sheeple: raccoons have infiltrated almost every part of our city! They&apos;re in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150321054033/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/13/raccoon_rummages_through_brooklyn_p_1.php">our libraries</a>, they&apos;re in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150321054033/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/23/raccoon_invades_park_slope_brownsto.php">our brownstones</a>, they&apos;re shopping <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150321054033/http://gothamist.com/2009/07/11/raccoon_finds_its_way_into_john_var.php">at John Varvatos</a>, they&apos;ve <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150321054033/http://gothamist.com/2009/08/18/raccoon_1.php">invaded City Hall</a>, and they basically <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150321054033/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/12/giant_raccoon.php">run the show</a> in the Bronx. And now, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150321054033/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/rabid_fears_in_central_park_dSl8ARxe7LWYzMvY22TM8J?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Manhattan">the Post reports that</a> they&apos;ve begun asserting their dominance in Central Park. &#x201C;The raccoons aren&#x2019;t responding to being shooed away,&#x201D; terrified mother Lori Schechter told them. &#x201C;People think they&#x2019;re cute, but they don&#x2019;t understand the danger.&quot;</p>

<p>In particular, the hoards of raccoons have taken a shining to Rudin Playground near Central Park West and 96th Street, a popular spot for kids parties. After observing nannies feeding the raccoons and then two children by hand, Schechter freaked out: &#x201C;When they&#x2019;re becoming bold enough to be near children, it&#x2019;s a real problem.&#x201D; When she called 311, she was told nothing could be done unless they&apos;re rabid, which the Health Department claims isn&apos;t an issue. </p>

<p>But won&apos;t someone think of the innocent, fear-averse children? &#x201C;It just scares me that my daughter has no fear,&#x201D; mother Meg Heminger said of her one-year-old Ella. &#x201C;Who knows what the animals can do?&#x201D; Watch the video below, and you can see just what they are capable of:</p>
