title: Is This The Greatest NY Times Correction Of All Time?

<p>There really is one NY Times correction to rule them all: last weekend, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509040535/http://bats.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/30/r-a-dickeys-well-named-arsenal/">Gray Lady wrote</a> a cute little piece about well-read Mets knuckleballer R.A. Dickey, and his unusual predilection for naming his baseball bats after <em>Beowulf</em> and <em>The Hobbit</em> references...except it seems someone hasn&apos;t been reading their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509040535/http://www.glyphweb.com/ARDA/">Encyclopedia of Arda</a> lately. </p>

<p>In the original piece, it said: &quot;One bat &#x456;&#x455; called Orcrist th&#x435; Goblin Ax &#x430;nd th&#x435; &#x3BF;th&#x435;r &#x456;&#x455; Hrunting. Dickey, &#x430;n avid reader, &#x455;&#x430;&#x456;d th&#x430;t Orcrist came fr&#x3BF;m <em>Th&#x435; Hobbit</em>; &#x456;t &#x456;&#x455; th&#x435; blade Bilbo Baggins uses &#x456;n th&#x435; Misty Mountains. Hrunting &#x2014; th&#x435; H &#x456;&#x455; &#x455;&#x456;l&#x435;nt, Dickey &#x455;&#x430;&#x456;d&#x2014;came fr&#x3BF;m th&#x435; epic poem <em>Beowulf</em>; &#x456;t &#x456;&#x455; th&#x435; sword Beowulf uses t&#x3BF; k&#x456;ll Grendel&#x2019;s mother.&quot; However, as the correction points out, &quot;Orcrist was the sword used by the dwarf Thorin Oakenshield in the book.&quot; Thus, the Times, and Dickey to a lesser extent, were publicly shamed by Middle Earth enthusiasts the internet over. One <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509040535/http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/h6nyw/im_sure_glad_the_ny_times_made_this_correction/">reddit user</a> aptly reads between the lines: <strong>&quot;Read as: &apos;Please, please, for the love of God just stop writing in about it....&apos; They&apos;ll know better than to fuck with Tolkien fans next time.&quot;</strong></p>
