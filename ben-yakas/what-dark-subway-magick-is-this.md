<p>We are living in an age when almost anything seems possible: Netflix can be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161202111334/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/30/netflix_no_wifi_no_problem.php">downloaded offline</a>! Megalomaniac Twitter trolls can become president! <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161202111334/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/21/us/goat-yoga-oregon.html?_r=0">Goat yoga</a>... is a thing! But spotting a subway car being transported through the streets of NYC is still a surprising and rare sighting that makes us question the nature of reality for a moment.</p>

<p>A tipster spotted the train traveling northbound on Broadway and Dyckman Street last week: &quot;There were at least two of these going up at the same time,&quot; he said. &quot;I didn&apos;t stick around long enough to see how many subway cars passed by in total.&quot; YouTuber DJ Hammers pointed out that this was a new R179 car which was being tested out in the video below.</p>

<p>While one might assume that train cars are more often than not delivered by rail rather than trucking&#x2014;especially considering the fact that so few people spot train cars aboveground&#x2014; that doesn&apos;t seem to be the case <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161202111334/http://www.nycsubway.org/wiki/Subway_FAQ:_How_New_Subway_Cars_Are_Delivered">according to the MTA.</a> Hammers noted <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161202111334/https://www.reddit.com/r/nyc/comments/5e687f/subway_train_seen_traveling_up_broadway_near/">in a Reddit thread</a> on the new cars, &quot;I do know there is precedent for both methods. I also can&apos;t speak for which method is more cost effective though. Bear in mind that FRA regulations prohibit subway cars (which are not FRA-certified) from being towed on their own wheels on main line railroads. You&apos;d have to load them on the flatcars. This is how the R142s were delivered.&quot;</p>

<p>And here&apos;s a video from 2012 that shows the process of moving the train cars:</p>
