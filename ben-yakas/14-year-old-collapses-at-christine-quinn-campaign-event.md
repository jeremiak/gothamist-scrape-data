                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="82513quinnn.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130825223358im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/82513quinnn.jpg" width="640" height="478"> <br> <i> Quinn at the event earlier today; you can see the young woman who passed out in white standing behind her (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130825223358/https://twitter.com/epngo/status/371673911286460416">Emily Ngo</a>)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>For the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130825223358/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/16/christine_quinn.php">second time</a> this summer, a teen collapsed due to heat at a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130825223358/http://gothamist.com/tags/christinequinn">Christine Quinn</a> campaign event. The 14-year-old girl, who is a family friend of Quinn&#x2019;s wife Kim Catullo, suddenly passed out during Quinn&apos;s press conference on the steps of City Hall earlier today. Maybe she was just <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130825223358/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/25/times_endorses_quinn_for_mayor.php">overwhelmed by the good press</a> Quinn got today?</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130825223358/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/christine_quinn_rescues_another_LWQP76W9yvL5oswnVFzX2M">According to the Post</a>, Quinn halted her event to attend to the young woman, helping her walk inside City Hall, and using wet towels to cool her down. Paramedics checked the girl before she went home. &#x201C;The young woman is fine. I don&apos;t think she actually lost consciousness, she just got overheated. She has cooled down,&#x201D; Quinn said. &#x201C;The paramedics were here and her pulse was fine. She&apos;s fine. She was always alert and knew what time of day it was and things of that nature. She is resting.&#x201D; Quinn resumed the event after about 10 minutes.</p>

<p>Back on July 16th, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130825223358/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/16/christine_quinn.php">a City Council intern collapsed</a> during a Quinn press conference in Brooklyn. It took more than 30 minutes for an ambulance to come, even with Quinn putting in a call to NYPD Commissioner Ray Kelly. </p>

<p>After confirming that the 14-year-old was okay, Quinn joked: &quot;I&#x2019;m going to purchase a mayoral tent with me to carry around at all times to keep things cooler in the future.&quot;<br>
