<p>Alec Baldwin <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022042905/http://gothamist.com/2016/09/28/alec_baldwin_will_play_donald_trump.php">made his debut</a> as Donald Trump in last night&apos;s season premiere of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022042905/http://gothamist.com/tags/snl"><em>Saturday Night Live</em></a>, in a cold open devoted to the Trump/Hillary Clinton debate from last week (what else could it have been!).</p>

<p>And Baldwin immediately hit it out of the park with his impression, emphasizing Trump&apos;s monstrously-emphatic orange face and gesticulations in a sketch that did not have to stretch the humor much beyond what was actually said at the debate. That came across in moments like when he recounted Trump&apos;s story about telling Sean Hannity he was against the Iraq War: &quot;I leaned in and whispered in his ear, &#x2018;I&#x2019;m against the war.&#x2019; He leaned in and said, &#x2018;Me too,&apos;&quot; Baldwin-as-Trump said. &quot;Next thing I know I was kissing Sean Hannity.&quot;</p>

<p>This was a marked upgrade from Darrell Hammond&apos;s performance last season as Trump, which had become pretty stale in the face of Trump&apos;s increasing lunacy. Baldwin definitely added an edge which is likely to make the next month&apos;s worth of shows leading up the election must-see-late-night-TV-on-the-weekends-assuming-you-don&apos;t-have-a-social-life, in-which-case-it&apos;s-more-like-must-see-Sunday-morning-clips.</p>

<p>Kate McKinnon, the de facto star of SNL now, perfected her Hillary impression last season, and showed no signs of boredom or complacency this episode, starting the sketch energetically with a pneumonia-laden Clinton performing a revitalizing Willy Wonka-esque tumble. </p>
