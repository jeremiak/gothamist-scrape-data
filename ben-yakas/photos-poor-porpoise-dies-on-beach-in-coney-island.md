	<p>A little over a month after a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130530150605/http://gothamist.com/tags/dolphin">dolphin tragically died</a> after washing up in the toxic Gowanus Canal, another sea mammal has died in Brooklyn: a baby porpoise died after washing up on a beach near the Coney Island Boardwalk on Saturday. Photographer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130530150605/http://www.cassandragiraldo.com/">Cassandra Giraldo</a>, who shot the photos above, told us: &quot;The dolphin was discovered on the shore by Boy Scouts during their Klondike derby, then reported to the police and animal patrol after a representative at the local aquarium evaluated it.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130530150605/http://www.brooklyndaily.com/stories/2013/9/bn_deaddolphin_2013_03_01_bk.html">Brooklyn Daily spoke</a> with Kent Woo, who was organizing that Boy Scouts trip. &#x201C;It was quite a find,&#x201D; he told them, adding that the porpoise appeared sick when he found it near Stillwell Avenue around 8 a.m. that morning. A good Samaritan brought the porpoise back to the water in an attempt to get it to swim away. &#x201C;A half hour passed, then someone walked past and then stripped down to his boxing shorts and took the dolphin out doing the breast stroke,&#x201D; said Woo.</p>

<p>Alas, it was to no avail&#x2014;the porpoise was apparently too sick, and was brought back to shore where it died. If you ever come upon any sick animal like this, make sure you call <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130530150605/http://www.riverheadfoundation.org/">the Riverhead Foundation</a> in addition to NYPD/FDNY&#x2014;the sooner you call, the better chance the animal has of surviving. </p>
