<p>A man survived a scary close encounter with the A train in Manhattan that was captured in a disturbing video. The tipster who sent us a copy of the video told us they believed it was shot at the 175th Street station: <strong>&quot;The man on the tracks in this video is clearly on something as his friend is pleading with him to get off the tracks.&quot;</strong> Warning: the man did survive the incident, but it is still very unnerving footage to say the least. <b>Update</b>: Here&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425174954/http://gothamist.com/2014/04/17/videos_subway_incident.php">footage after the man got out of the tracks</a>.</p>

<p>Initially, the NYPD and FDNY told us they had no recent recorded incidents or EMS transports at that location. The original tipster, who did not record the video and asked to remain anonymous, believed that the man survived. &quot;As ridiculous as it sounds...you always hear those stories about people surviving in the middle of the tracks.&quot;</p>

<p>As for how the tipster got the video in the first place, they told us the person who took the video initially posted it online before facing a backlash from commenters:</p>

<blockquote>Everyone on the post was asking why did he just stand there filming and not help the guy. He said he was wasted too....In the video the guy&apos;s friend asks him to go down and help but he refuses. Well he eventually took the video down in a few hours but not before I downloaded it.</blockquote>

<p>MTA spokesman Kevin Ortiz says the incident occurred this past winter, on December 28th, 2013, around 3:15 a.m. <strong>&quot;The male originally refused medical aid but was forced to go to Columbia Presbyterian hospital as an emotionally disturbed person with EMS,&quot;</strong> Ortiz explained.</p>

<p>Back in 2007, subway hero <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425174954/http://gothamist.com/tags/WesleyAutrey">Wesley Autrey</a> jumped down onto the tracks and pinned 20-year-old Cameron Hollopeter down in the track bed as he was suffering a seizure. Both men survived with minimal injuries. The MTA confirmed that it is possible for a train to roll over someone without coming in contact with them, but as there are different types of train and track configurations, they can&apos;t offer advice on how one should position themselves to avoid the train. </p>

<p>&quot;The best advice is to avoid going on the tracks,&quot; Ortiz said. &quot;Customers who witness someone on the tracks should immediately contact a MTA employee or police officer. Station agents can immediately contact the Rail Control Center who can stop trains from entering the station, cut off power and effectuate a rescue.&quot;</p>

<p>Three years ago, we received a similar video in tone, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425174954/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/21/video_see_someone_bloodied_in_the_s.php">showing a bloodied man in distress on the train tracks.</a> As we said then: if you see someone struggling on the tracks, get help first. Contact an MTA, FDNY, or NYPD employee immediately.</p>
