<p>Between the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408231831/http://gothamist.com/2014/04/27/videos_jerry_seinfeld_turns_up_in_n.php">promos</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408231831/http://gothamist.com/2014/03/30/video_louis_ck_saturday_night_live.php">hosting SNL</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408231831/http://gothamist.com/2014/03/13/louie_returns_in_may.php">moody diner photos</a>, we&apos;re getting very excited about the new season of <em>Louie</em>, which premieres on FX on May 5th. But what exactly is it that makes <em>Louie</em>...<em>Louie</em>? Is it the brilliant way Louis C.K. expands his stand-up routines into existential short films? Is it the anything-can-happen, continuity-be-damned experimentalism? Is it the brutal honesty and depth of emotion C.K. employs in service of his muse? Or is it all the dick jokes? Oh, right, it&apos;s all the dick jokes.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408231831/http://digg.com/video/louis-ck-dicks-supercut-louie">Digg compiled</a> the video above, which proves that the show really is, at its core, a showcase for C.K. to work over every dick joke imaginable&#x2014;and unimaginable, considering his beloved and oft-used <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408231831/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT7xc_XqYO8">&quot;bag of dicks&quot; line</a>. </p>

<p>How can C.K. possibly top himself this season? Let&apos;s look back at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408231831/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/04/louis_ck_talks_upcoming_season_of_l.php">what he said at Paley Fest</a> a few months ago about season four for some insights: &#x201C;There&apos;s some episodes that are just like, let&apos;s really get some basic [dicks] with some of these [dicks]. It was fun to go back to [dicks]. And then there&apos;s other [dicks] that, it&apos;s just gonna piss you off [of your dick].&#x201D; </p>
