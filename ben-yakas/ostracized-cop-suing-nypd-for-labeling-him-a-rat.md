The lawsuit largely stems from the botched investigation of the death of Marcello Lopez in 2005, for which Detective James Griffin was one of the primary investigators. </p>

<p>Lopez was chased and beaten by a group of people in Bushwick after he crashed his car and tried to flee; he died two weeks later, but cops weren&apos;t sure if his injuries resulted from the beating or the car accident. Griffin&apos;s partner, Detective Michael O&apos;Keefe, allegedly failed to interview Lopez while in the hospital, and then pressured Griffin to take the blame, vowing to point the finger at him whether he accepted or not. &quot;I wasn&apos;t going to take the blame for something I didn&apos;t do. I refused to do it,&quot; Griffin said. After he reported O&apos;Keefe to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150804142343/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/28/stories_from_the_nypds_internal_aff.php">Internal Affairs</a>, colleagues threatened him, refused to work with him and scrawled &quot;rat&quot; on his locker. He was transferred two times thereafter and faced similar hostility in the workplace; according to his suit, one supervisor, Lt. Michael Miltenberg, stared at him in front of other cops and said, <strong>&quot;There&apos;s a rat in here.&quot;</strong></p>

<p>The likely reason O&apos;Keefe wanted Griffin to take the blame was because O&apos;Keefe is no stranger to controversy&#x2014; he came to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150804142343/http://www.nytimes.com/1992/09/13/opinion/the-lesson-of-washington-heights.html">notoriety</a> in 1991, when he shot Jose Garcia in Washington Heights, sparking riots and reports of police brutality. He was eventually cleared of any wrong doing. An internal investigation found O&apos;Keefe in fault for the Lopez investigation, and he retired last year. Earlier this year, allegations about police corruption and stat &quot;juking&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150804142343/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/05/brooklyn_cops_secret_recordings_rel.php">pervaded</a> Brooklyn&apos;s 81st division, which also prompted an officer to be labeled a &quot;rat.&quot;</p>
