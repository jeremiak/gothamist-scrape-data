<p>If you&apos;re like us, then you probably already feel like you&apos;ve seen at least half of the 2012 summer blockbuster, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161337/http://gothamist.com/tags/thedarkknightrises"><em>The Dark Knight Rises</em></a>. Between the Wall Street battles, the 59th Street Bridge filming, and the Newark Catwoman sightings, we&apos;ve pieced together that the movie will focus around the dark underbelly of street closings. The final chapter of the acclaimed Christopher Nolan-helmed Batman films is due in theaters next July, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161337/http://www.comicbookmovie.com/fansites/JoshWildingNewsAndReviews/news/?a=50574">you&apos;ll have a chance to see</a> the first six minutes of the film in theaters in just a few weeks! </p>

<p>The six-minute opening sequence of the film will be shown at select IMAX screenings of <em>Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol</em> starting on December 16. The filmmakers also did this for 2008&apos;s <em>The Dark Knight</em>, with a prologue centered around the Joker&apos;s introductory bank heist&#x2014;so you can likely expect this one to revolve around new villain Bane.</p>

<p>However, you won&apos;t have too many options to see the prologue in the NY-area: the only cinema in NYC showing it will be Lincoln Square 13 with IMAX. The Palisades IMAX in West Nyack will also be showing it, as well as the IMAX at the Tropicana in Atlantic City. You can see the full <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161337/http://www.avclub.com/articles/heres-where-you-can-see-those-first-six-minutes-of,66005/">list of participating theaters here.</a></p>
