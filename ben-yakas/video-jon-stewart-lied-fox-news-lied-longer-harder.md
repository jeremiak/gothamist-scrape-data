<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="62211stewart.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20111120013445im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/62211stewart.jpg" width="640" height="386" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>When Jon Stewart <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111120013445/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/20/video_jon_stewart_says_the_times_bi.php">ripped Fox News on Fox News</a> on Sunday, he argued at one point that the station was actively harming its audience with its distortions: &quot;Who are the most consistently misinformed media viewers? The most consistently misinformed? Fox, Fox viewers, consistently, every poll.&quot; Last night on <em>The Daily Show</em>, he admitted that he himself had been misinformed on that point...and then proceeded to list 21 statements by Fox that independent fact-checking organization PolitiFact has proven to be false. Watch below:</p>

<p>As you get a hint of from the screenshot above, Stewart was eventually crowded out of the screen by all the falsities&#x2014;he was so tired from recounting all the lies at one point, he needed a snack for an energy burst &quot;to climb Mount Fib.&quot; Stewart cited two &quot;Lie of the Year&quot; awardees (&quot;A government takeover of health care&quot; and health care &quot;death panels&quot;), five Pants on Fires and 14 False ratings. Politifact has all of the articles referenced by Stewart <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111120013445/http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2011/jun/22/jon-stewarts-politifact-segment-annotated-edition/">in one place here</a> (which stretches from 2009 to this month).</p>

<p>Stewart summed it up with this metaphor: &quot;Fox News is like a lying dynasty. <strong>They&apos;re like the New England Patriots. Of lying! Without the patriots part, because we all know, patriots cannot tell a lie.</strong>&quot;</p>
