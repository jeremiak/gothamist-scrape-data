<p>Recently, President Obama <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429162057/http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/05/31/presidential-proclamation-lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-pride-mon">officially declared</a> June the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Pride Month, and events are going on across the five boroughs all month. Today, a few hundred members of Staten Island&apos;s LGBT community <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429162057/http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2011/06/staten_island_gay_pride_parade.html">came out for</a> their march, culminating with a festival in Tompkinsville Park at 4 p.m. later this afternoon. And tomorrow, there is the 19th Annual Queens Lesbian, Bisexual, and Transgender Pride Parade and Festival taking place in Jackson Heights.</p>

<p>The Parade starts at noon on 37th Avenue from 85th Street to 75th Street in Jackson Heights; there will also be a multicultural festival concurrently from noon to 6 p.m. on 75th Street and 37th Road between 74th and 77th Streets. This year&#x2019;s Grand Marshals will be Miss New York 2010, Claire Buffie, NYS State Senator Tony Avella, and SALGA (South Asian Lesbian and Gay Association). Chis Calvert, co-chairperson of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429162057/http://www.queenspride.com/">Queens Pride</a>, the festival organizing committee, said: &quot;Queens Pride is thrilled by the President&apos;s proclamation and is pleased to host the kick-off for the month of Pride celebrations in New York City. Our parade offers LGBT organizations a real opportunity to draw awareness and visibility.&quot;</p>

<p>The second annual Harlem Pride event is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429162057/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/02/harlem_pride_confuses_enrages_harle.php">coming up on</a> on Saturday, June 25, in Marcus Garvey Park from noon to 6 p.m. The celebration includes a barbecue, bowling and a dance party, but it has been met with resistance (and confusion) in some corners of Harlem, including one pastor who said, &quot;If children start to believe it is okay to be gay, they will think it&apos;s okay to be a pedophile or have sex with animals. It&apos;s a slippery slope.&quot; </p>
