<p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160921112102/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/19/nyc_pot_decriminalization_could_hap.php">hopes were high that</a> Governor Cuomo&apos;s push for the decriminalization of small amounts of pot in NYC would finally pass as part of the new state budget. But we were obviously expecting too much from Albany: after a week of closed door negotiations, lawmakers couldn&apos;t come to an agreement. &quot;This is ugly. There&apos;s no other way to call this,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160921112102/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/21/new-york-marijuana-reform_n_2927771.html">said Gabriel Sayegh</a>, director of the Drug Policy Alliance&apos;s NY office. &quot;It&apos;s ugly and it&apos;s embarrassing to be a New Yorker when they can&apos;t pass this one simple fix. They just kicked this can down the field before they go on vacation.&quot;</p>

<p>Governor Cuomo had been pushing for the change in the law, which would make possession of 15 grams &quot;in open view&quot; a violation,  and answerable by a summons instead of a misdemeanor. But on Thursday, Cuomo announced that he had reached an agreement with Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver and joint state Senate leaders Dean Skelos and Jeffrey Klein on a state budget&#x2014;but there was no mention of the marijuana decriminalization. </p>

<p>The proposed reforms &#x201C;got caught in the horse trading and political posturing,&#x201D; Assemblyman Karim Camara, a Brooklyn Democrat, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160921112102/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/22/nyregion/out-of-one-gram-of-marijuana-a-manufactured-misdemeanor.html?_r=2&amp;">told the Times</a>. He added that Senate Republicans offered to permit a vote on the marijuana reforms in exchange for increasing the number of bullets allowed in an ammunition magazine, from 7 to 10. &#x201C;I think it&#x2019;s unconscionable,&#x201D; he said.</p>

<p>Now, lawmakers will go on a three-week vacation; there&apos;s still a chance the change can be made when they return, but as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160921112102/http://www.thedailychronic.net/2013/16470/as-nyc-pot-busts-continue-new-york-lawmakers-pass-on-marijuana-reform/">The Daily Chronic</a> points out, &quot;it is certainly delayed and possibly derailed without having the impetus of the budget agreement behind it.&quot; </p>

<p>&#x201C;I am gravely disappointed that this budget failed to enact justice for the more than 44,000 individuals arrested last year based on a flawed law. Not only does allowing these arrests directly impact the lives of individuals and their communities, they are a gross misappropriation of city and state resources, and a waste of officer manpower that can be spent on more pressing law enforcement matters,&#x201D; said Assemblyman Karim Camara, Chair of the New York State Black, Puerto Rican, Hispanic and Asian Legislative Caucus.</p>

<p>&#x201C;This is an issue that cannot wait.  Our tens of thousands of youth arrested annually under unfair practices shouldn&#x2019;t have to wait,&#x201D; said Assemblymember Robert Rodriguez.  &#x201D;They deserve better&#x2014;they deserve justice and equality.  And they deserve it now. We need to end this policy that has plagued our communities for too long  and make public view possession a violation.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Possession of small amounts of marijuana was decriminalized in New York State in 1977 for 25 grams or less, as long as it&apos;s not in public view. But the NYPD, especially under the Bloomberg and Giuliani administrations, has widely disregarded this law, and the department&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160921112102/http://gothamist.com/tags/stopandfrisk">stop-and-frisk policy</a> has been instrumental in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160921112102/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/01/nypds_low-level_marijuana_possessio.php">driving up the numbers of pot possession arrests.</a> Despite that, even <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160921112102/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/04/bloomberg_cool_with_cuomos_plan_to.php">Bloomberg said he was in favor</a> of decriminalizing small amounts of pot in NYC. </p>
