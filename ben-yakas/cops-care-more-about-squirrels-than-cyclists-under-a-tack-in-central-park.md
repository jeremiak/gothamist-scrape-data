<p>It seems that the uneasy alliance of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150812005701/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/27/oh_the_humanity_cyclist_sues_pedest.php">pedestrians, bicyclists</a> and squirrels that form the circle of life in Central Park (also known as &quot;Simbaringaneuensis&quot;) has started breaking down. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150812005701/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/bike_tire_tacks_rXnyuiIvvw7lFpoWS8qJtM">According to the Post</a>, someone who really hates bicyclists has been leaving thumbtacks across the Park Drive in the mornings, injuring up to a dozen cyclists so far. And as you can imagine, cops are making it a priority to stop the suspect before someone gets really hurt: &#x201C;<strong>We have more important things to worry about, like people getting shot and squirrels getting run over</strong>,&#x201D; one cranky cop told the Post. &#x201C;A flat tire is not the crime of the century.&#x201D; Try telling that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150812005701/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnZpFkSJaE8">to Larry David.</a></p>

<p>&#x201C;I was paying close attention to everything around me, and I was looking for major hazards like potholes, not things like thumbtacks,&#x201D; cyclist and Manhattan attorney Steve Vaccaro said, describing what happened to him the morning of July 3rd. &#x201C;I rode over it and my tire instantly deflated, and after that I fell to the ground. I ripped the skin off my elbow and it&#x2019;s pretty sore, but I don&#x2019;t have any broken bones.&#x201D; Rider Ben Noble said it was chaos in Central Park, the likes of which he hasn&apos;t seen anywhere in the world in his 42 years on this Earth: &#x201C;I&#x2019;ve ridden thousands of miles in here, and I&#x2019;ve seen maybe two people in three years with flat tires. <strong>And that morning I saw easily 12 people with flat tires.&#x201D;</strong></p>

<p>Tension seems to be high between runners and cyclists, according to Jonathan Giahn, a memeber of a triathlon team called Asphalt Green. He believes he knows who is to blame: &#x201C;I really don&#x2019;t want to point fingers, but some think it could have been a disgruntled runner,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;There is kind of a rivalry in the park between cyclists and runners.&#x201D; Ehh, it&apos;s possible, but what about those pizza-eating, acorn-hoarding squirrels? Or those <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150812005701/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/01/raccoons_invade_central_park_shooin.php">terrorist raccoons???</a> </p>
