										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:230px; "> <img alt="92910bloomberg.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406184742im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/92910bloomberg.jpg" width="230" height="160"> <br> <i>AP</i></div> In a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406184742/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/09/29/2010-09-29_mike_likes_cop_statistics_but_please_dont_quota_him_on_that.html">letter to Gov. Paterson</a>, asking him to kill a measure that would make it illegal for cops to set quotas for summonses, arrests and stop-and-frisks, Mayor Bloomberg wrote: &quot;For an employee whose function it is to issue parking tickets, a measurement clearly relevant to job performance is the number of summonses issued over the course of a reasonable period of time.&quot; (Of, course, the Mayor doesn&apos;t call &apos;em quotas in the letter, but we all know what he means!)<p></p>

<p>Governor Paterson ultimately <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406184742/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/16/paterson_signing_bill_ending_massiv.php">signed that measure into law</a> against Bloomberg&apos;s wishes, but the letter will live on as evidence in whistleblowing former police officer Adrian Schoolcraft&apos;s  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406184742/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/29/bed-stuy_serpico_vows_to_bring_quot.php">lawsuit against the city</a>.  Still, mayoral spokesman Jason Post said, &quot;Knowing how many summonses a traffic agent writes is responsible management, not a quota,&quot; while police spokesman Paul Browne insists that this is just <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406184742/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/11/nypd_on_quota_recordings_just_good.php">&quot;good management.&quot;</a> But, as one Gothamist commenter put it, <strong>&quot;You can hand somebody a pile of dog poop and tell them it&apos;s a bouquet of roses, [but] it still smells like shit.&quot;</strong></p>
