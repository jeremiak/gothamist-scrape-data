Levy Itzhak Rosenbaum, 60, admitted that he bought kidneys for cheap in Israel then sold them to needy people in America for huge sums of money. &quot;I am what you call a matchmaker...I&apos;ve never had a failure,&quot; he was caught on tape telling an FBI informant posing as a potential client.<p></p>

<p>Rosenbaum <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111030170851/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2011/10/27/2011-10-27_brooklyn_blackmarket_kidney_broker_pleads_guilty_to_selling_israeli_organs_to_de.html">bought kidneys off of</a> Israelis for around $10,000, then sold them here for $120,000 or more; he was the first person in the United States ever charged with the trafficking of live human organs. Rosenbaum was arrested two years ago as part of a massive federal sting operation, which led to the arrests of 46 people, including three New Jersey mayors, two state legislators, and more than 20 candidates for public office.</p>

<p>Caught bragging on tape about his expertise in the illegal organ selling trade, Rosenbaum was known around Brooklyn as the &#x201C;go-to&#x201D; guy with kidney connections for those who did not want to wait for a suitable donor organ, or did not qualify to be placed on a transplant list. He pleaded guilty to brokering three illegal transplants, as well as one count of conspiracy. He faces up to five years in prison, and possible deportation to Israel.</p>
