<p>Yesterday, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425175340/http://gothamist.com/2013/12/07/cops_shoot_man_who_allegedly_attack.php">police shot a man in Brooklyn</a> who they say attacked them with a cane. Dairon Bledsoe, 27, allegedly was spotted hitting an empty marked cop car in Bedford-Stuyvesant around 10:30 a.m. Saturday. According to police, Bledsoe struck a female officer in the face with his cane, breaking it into two, and was then shot by another officer. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425175340/http://nypost.com/2013/12/07/cops-shoot-man-swinging-cane-at-cop-car/">But locals tell the Post</a> cops used too much force on the suspect: &#x201C;Several people warned the police that he was emotionally disturbed, but the police proceeded to chase him down,&#x201D; a witness named Jason told them. &#x201C;It seems like an overreaction.&#x201D;</p>

<p>&#x201C;He didn&#x2019;t hit the cop car,&#x201D; Luis Acevedo, 51, added. &#x201C;The cops came and started looking at the car. There was nothing wrong with it. We told them. They still went after him.&#x201D; According to police, Bledsoe&apos;s blow caused bruising, swelling and lacerations to the officer&apos;s face, and he was preparing to strike her again when the other officer fired and hit him in the upper torso area.</p>

<p>Acevedo disputes this recollection of events: &#x201C;They didn&#x2019;t give him no warning,&quot; Acevedo said, claiming the man didn&apos;t strike the officer. &quot;They just shot him. The guy fell down right on the floor. We thought he was dead.&quot; The Post notes that surveillance video shows the victim &quot;taking a wild swing at the cop.&quot; &#x201C;I saw [the officer] panicking,&quot; said Lenora Johnson, who says Bledsoe definitely was waving his cane around. &quot;It happened so fast. It was horrifying.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Bledsoe was taken to Kings County Hospital, where he is in stable condition. He&apos;s been charged with felony assault, assault on a police officer with a deadly weapon, assault on a police officer, menacing, attempted criminal mischief and criminal possession of a weapon. Both officers were taken to Wyckoff Hospital and are in stable condition.</p>
