<p>Beggars might be not be choosers, but muggers apparently are: the Central Park robber <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150701002847/http://gothamist.com/2013/12/28/tourist_robbed_at_gunpoint_in_centr.php">who mugged a tourist and a Brooklyn resident</a> in the park on Saturday morning apparently rejected one of his victims&apos; flip phones. &quot;Once he saw my phone, he looked at it like, &apos;What the f-k is this?&apos; and gave it back to me,&quot; Kevin Cook <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150701002847/http://nypost.com/2013/12/29/central-park-mugger-rejects-flip-phone/">told the Post.</a></p>

<p>&quot;It&apos;s like a 3-year-old generation Windows phone,&quot; said Cook, 25, a New York Sports Club salesman. &quot;I guess he didn&apos;t think he could get anything for it,&quot; Cooke added. &quot;It&apos;s kind of humorous.&quot; Cook was walking with a 24-year-old friend, who was visiting from out of town, on West 64th Street near West Drive when they were approached by two men around 12:30 a.m. Saturday morning. </p>

<p>Altogether, a leather briefcase, non-flip cell phone, debit and credit cards, a passport and $113 cash were stolen from the two men. No arrests have been made, and police say the investigation is ongoing.</p>
