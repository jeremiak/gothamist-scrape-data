<p>This afternoon, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426235623/http://gothamist.com/tags/giants">Giants</a> lost to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426235623/http://stats.newyork.cbslocal.com/fb/recap.asp?g=20131006019&amp;utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter">Philadelphia Eagles 36-21</a> for their fifth straight horrible loss of the season. This is their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426235623/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/22/the_giants_just_played_their_worst.php">worst start</a> to a non-strike season since <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426235623/https://twitter.com/SportsCenter/status/386951937356083200">Ronald Reagan was president</a>&#x2014;and it pretty much guarantees that they will not make the playoffs (since no 0-5 has ever made the playoffs). Check out some appropriately depressing stats and reactions below.</p>

<p>There really isn&apos;t any silver lining for Giants fans at this point. But uh, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426235623/https://twitter.com/richarddeitsch/status/386959542312898560">at least they&apos;re not the Jaguars.</a> </p>
