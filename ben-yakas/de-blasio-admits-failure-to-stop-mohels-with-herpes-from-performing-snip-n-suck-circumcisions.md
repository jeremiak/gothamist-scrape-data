<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170402033603/https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20170309/borough-park/neonatal-herpes-infection-ritual-jewish-circumcision-orthodox-mohel">Six babies</a> have developed herpes following circumcisions since Bill de Blasio became mayor, and his administration is now changing course on the issue in an attempt <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170402033603/http://www.politico.com/states/new-york/city-hall/story/2017/03/de-blasio-will-ban-mohels-linked-to-neonatal-herpes-from-performing-metzitah-bpeh-110804">to stop</a> mohels who have infected babies with herpes from performing the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170402033603/http://gothamist.com/tags/snipnsuck">metzitzah b&#x2019;peh ritual</a>. </p>

<p>Health Commissioner Mary Bassett said yesterday that two of the six mohels who infected the babies have been identified and ordered to stop performing the ritual. Yet the administration won&apos;t release the names of the mohels: &quot;We have defended the department&apos;s decision in court not to make these names available. People are entitled to their privacy,&quot; she said. As a result, the City will rely on parents to ask their mohel if they have been banned by the health commissioner.</p>

<p>The ultra-Orthodox Jewish community in NYC <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170402033603/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/12/ultra-orthodox_sex_abuse_whistleblo.php&quot;">has been criticized for failed attempts</a> to police itself in the past, so it&apos;s an open question whether what amounts to the honor system will make a difference this time. But at least de Blasio is acknowledging the current policy is a failure: &quot;We tried a new policy. It didn&#x2019;t work either &#x2014; which I&#x2019;m very unhappy about,&#x201D; de Blasio <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170402033603/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/manhattan/nyc-barred-men-practicing-jewish-circumcision-article-1.3013127">said at a press conference</a> in Queens yesterday. &quot;I don&#x2019;t think those community leaders did all they could have done. So now we&#x2019;re going in a different direction.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We&#x2019;re going to do a much more intensive effort to educate parents, particular mothers, as to the dangers of this practice,&quot; he continued. &quot;And we&#x2019;re going to say to them, it&#x2019;s important to ask the mohel&#x2014;if you choose to engage in this practice, that&#x2019;s your right, and we respect religious freedom&#x2014;but ask the mohel if they are infected with herpes. And if they are, you should find a different mohel. It&#x2019;s as simple as that.&quot;</p>

<p>The &quot;metzitzah b&apos;peh&quot; ritual is the circumcision practice in which a mohel sucks the blood from a freshly snipped foreskin of a baby boy. Outside of the ultra-Orthodox community, the ritual is shunned by Jews, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170402033603/http://failedmessiah.typepad.com/failed_messiahcom/2014/07/why-do-haredim-do-metzitzah-bpeh-the-dangerous-circumcision-related-practice-that-has-killed-and-mai-345.html">is considered</a> by many to be an ancient tradition based on &quot;a long-discredited medical theory from the Iron Age before the dawn of the Common Era.&quot;</p>

<p>Under the Bloomberg administration, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170402033603/http://gothamist.com/2012/09/13/snip-n-suck_circumcision_blood_libe.php#photo-1">the Board of Health ruled</a> that &quot;parents need to be aware of the opinion of experts,&quot; and unanimously passed circumcision consent forms that required Orthodox Jewish parents to sign a waiver before their infant could undergo the procedure. The City <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170402033603/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/12/jewish_groups_sue_city_over_snip-n-.php">was immediately sued</a> by ultra-Orthodox Jewish groups who claimed their First Amendment rights were violated.</p>

<p>When he was first running for office, de Blasio <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170402033603/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/04/mayoral_candidates_mostly_agree_sni.php">criticized the Bloomberg administration</a> for not reaching out to the community, but stopped short of promising to dispose of the consent forms. He later used the consent forms as a way to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170402033603/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/27/both_mayoral_candidates_are_panderi.php">win over ultra-Orthodox Jewish voters</a> and further separate himself from Bloomberg, saying, &quot;I would start over and change the policy to find a way to protect all of our children but also respect religious tradition.&quot;</p>

<p>As <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170402033603/http://failedmessiah.typepad.com/failed_messiahcom/2013/09/shame-bill-deblasio-promises-satmar-that-in-exchange-for-votes-he-will-repeal-informed-consent-metzitzah-b-peh-123.html">Failed Messiah put it</a> at the time, &quot;Bill De Blasio Promises Satmar That In Exchange For Votes, He Will Repeal Informed Consent For Dangerous Haredi Circumcision Practice.&quot; The ultra-Orthodox Jewish factions generally vote in blocs&#x2014;Failed Messiah notes that this Aharonite Satmar faction alone is worth 10,000+ votes. On election night in 2013, one ultra-Orthodox Jewish voter in South Williamsburg <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170402033603/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/11/voter_fraud_attempts.php">bluntly told us</a>, &quot;I don&apos;t know the meaning of democracy, I just vote what they tell me to do, because maybe they&apos;ve made deals with the politicians.&quot;</p>

<p>De Blasio <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170402033603/http://gothamist.com/2015/09/09/snip_n_suck_circumcision.php">made good on that promise</a> in 2015, with the Board of Health nixing the consent forms. The city instead directed health officials to distribute <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170402033603/http://www.nyc.gov/html/doh/downloads/pdf/std/before-the-bris-brochure.pdf">a brochure</a> to ultra-Orthodox Jewish parents titled, &quot;Make a safe bris for your baby.&quot; </p>

<p>Over 20 babies in NYC <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170402033603/http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/02/21/nyc-orthodox-jews-in-talks-over-ritual-after-herpes-cases/23798751/">have been infected with herpes</a> since 2000 because of the ritual, and at least two have died because of it. Israeli doctors studying the herpes infection <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170402033603/http://failedmessiah.typepad.com/failed_messiahcom/2013/03/israeli-doctors-find-delayed-reaction-herpes-infection-caused-by-dangerous-haredi-cicumcision-rite-789.html">also believe</a> it may be the cause of the noticeably higher number of learning disabled children in Hasidic communities.</p>
