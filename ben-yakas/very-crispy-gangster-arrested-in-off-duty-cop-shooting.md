<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:313px; "> <img alt="10711mcd.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20111203044203im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/10711mcd.jpg" width="313" height="225"> <br> <i>The crime scene on Monday (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111203044203/http://www.wpix.com/news/wpix-off-duty-cop-shot,0,5434909.story">via PIX11</a>)</i></div> A teenage member of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111203044203/http://gothamist.com/tags/verycrispygangsters">Very Crispy Gangsters</a> has been charged with the shooting of an off-duty cop <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111203044203/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/04/state_of_emergency_demanded_after_o.php">earlier this week</a>. Eric Greenidge, 18, is accused of firing several shots at rival gang members in a McDonalds parking lot in East New York Monday; officer Dawn Foster was hit in the crossfire, but survived. But officers are angry that Greenidge has been given bail: &#x201C;In the annals of lousy calls, this one is particularly bad and it needs to be rectified before this thug hurts or kills anyone else,&#x201D; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111203044203/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/police_rage_at_cop_shooter_bail_P4nALN1b4tM83yxObXjteK?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">said Patrick Lynch</a>, president of the Patrolmen&apos;s Benevolent Association.<p></p>

<p>Greenidge, who is on parole for a robbery conviction, had been targeting members of the rival Rock Starz gang when a stray bullet pierced Foster&apos;s right arm. Foster, a 17-year NYPD vet, was able to drive to her mother&apos;s nearby home, where she called 911. Greenidge was charged with assault and criminal possession of a weapon, but his bail was only set at a measly $25,000 cash or $50,000 bond, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111203044203/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2011/10/07/2011-10-07_charge_bklyn_teen_gangbanger_in_straybullet_shooting_of_cop.html">which enraged Lynch</a>. &quot;Given the level of violence on our streets and the proliferation of guns in this city, how bail can be granted to a convicted criminal under these circumstances defies logic,&quot; he said.</p>
