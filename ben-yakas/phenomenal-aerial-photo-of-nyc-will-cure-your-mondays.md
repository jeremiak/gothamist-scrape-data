The art of eloquent griping is part of what defines us as New Yorkers. We complain about Bloomberg and his incessant nannying, about the cost of cab fare to JFK, about the rent being too damn high. We complain about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130601153446/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/09/rambo_everyone_wants_a_piece_of_god.php">neighborhood names</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130601153446/http://gothamist.com/tags/santacon">inebriated Santas</a>, and the <href="http: 2013="" gothamist.com="" 01="" 02="" have_you_become_complacent_to_the_r.php"="">ubiquitious rats. We complain about our commutes and &quot;hipsters&quot; and the rising cost of cigarettes, not to mention the everyday headaches that inevitably arise from living in a city with eight million egos. We complain about being so busy but God forbid the Internet goes down for five seconds; we complain about people who complain and none of this is contradictory. We are constantly in motion. <p></p>

<p>So it&apos;s refreshing to catch a glimpse of ourselves from afar&#x2014;to step back and let everything fall silent for a moment. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130601153446/http://andrew-kenney.com/">Andrew Kenney</a> took this gorgeous photo the other day while landing at LaGuardia. This <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130601153446/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ts5Hgb-3Pcw">jagged skyline of car keys</a> is exactly what we want to see every time we come home. It&apos;s important to remember that our world is bigger than the cost of a pack of smokes.</p>

<p>As <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130601153446/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Kunitz">Stanley Kunitz</a> wrote, &quot;I can scarcely wait till tomorrow / when a new life begins for me / as it does each day / as it does each day.&quot;</p>
