<p>A Long Island man <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408141550/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/long-island-man-struck-speedboat-found-dead-robert-moses-bridge-article-1.1101251">was found dead</a> several hours after he was thrown into the water when a powerboat driven by an allegedly drunk 26-year-old hit his fishing boat. Police say they found 39-year-old Christopher Mannino&#x2019;s body under the Robert Moses Causeway in Long Island&#x2019;s Great South Bay around 1:30 p.m. Saturday, after a nine hour search. The pilot of the speedboat which hit his boat, Brian Andreski, was charged with boating while intoxicated.</p>

<p>Mannino <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408141550/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/deadly_long_is_boatinghorror_KT4o16iPGMQ9dig7op6o5K">went missing around 5 a.m.</a> Saturday morning after Andreski&apos;s 25-foot Skater speedboat struck the side of the 1967 38-foot Hatteras that Mannino and four others were in. Mannino was thrown into the ocean; the other passengers, who were all on their way to a shark-fishing tournament, were unhurt. Andreski and a passenger in his boat were also thrown over because of the crash, but both were found soon after and suffered non-life-threatening injuries.</p>
