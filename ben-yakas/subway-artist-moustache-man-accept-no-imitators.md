<p>You might not immediately recognize his moniker, but you certainly pass by his handiwork in the subways every day&#x2014;Moustache Man has been <em>the guy</em> when it comes to drawing fake moustaches on movie posters for the past year. He may not be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170227034038/http://gothamist.com/2009/01/23/posterboy_street_artist.php">Poster Boy</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170227034038/http://gothamist.com/2010/01/06/video_dickchicken_revealed_sort_of.php">Dickchicken</a>, but he has been receiving an ample amount of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170227034038/http://impudentways.blogspot.com/2011/03/imtimate-conversation-with-moustache.html">publicity</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170227034038/http://blog.hyperquake.com/moustache-bandit/">recognition</a> for his work. People really <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170227034038/http://bitchcakescommutes.blogspot.com/search/label/Moustache%20Artist">like him</a>! But the time for polite conversations about cookie dusters has come to an end&#x2014;Moustache Man has started <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170227034038/http://www.reddit.com/r/nyc/comments/i5hdl/moustache_there_can_only_be_one/">fighting back</a> against his imitators!</p>

<p>You can see the original work of Moustache Man, who also goes by Moustache Bandit and Madcap Moustache Man, all over the city&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170227034038/http://www.flickr.com/photos/thesweetchuck/5482722427/">here</a> are but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170227034038/http://www.flickr.com/photos/_pauletto/4630445588/">a few</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170227034038/http://www.flickr.com/photos/jimkiernan/5723342894/">examples</a>. While he obviously doesn&apos;t have any kind of ownership over his signature, it seems that people (or one person) have been copying it&#x2014;so the question is...how can we tell the real ones from the imitators? And why does he care so much?</p>

<p>What we do know is, Moustache Man does take his work seriously, even if it didn&apos;t start that way. In an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170227034038/http://subwayartblog.com/2011/05/05/the-man-behind-the-moustache/">interview with Subway Art Blog</a>, he gave his ethos about what he does:</p>

<blockquote>At it&#x2019;s simplest level, it&#x2019;s a quick joke meant to give commuters something to smile about while they&#x2019;re waiting for the subway, coming off from a long day at work, or getting stabbed on the D train. And that&#x2019;s certainly how it started. But for me it&#x2019;s evolved into part of this broader movement of subverting advertisements. Especially in New York, where we&#x2019;re bombarded with ads everywhere we go, it feels more and more like we&#x2019;re part of a one-sided conversation. We&#x2019;re getting these ridiculous images and dumb catchphrases shoved down our throats (&#x201C;Good Afternoont!&#x201D;), why shouldn&#x2019;t we be able to talk back? So many ads are so laughably stupid that a cartoonish moustache just seems to fit. On another level, it&#x2019;s a return to hand-written form in a technology driven age where we type so much that some of us have actually forgotten how to write cursive.

<p>Also it&#x2019;s about war or something.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>For what it&apos;s worth, we still think <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170227034038/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ3y44UGahw">this is the one true Moustache Man</a> in New York City.</p>
