<p>As Bruce Springsteen once sang, &quot;Everything dies baby, that&apos;s a fact/but maybe everything that dies one day comes back as a Wendy&apos;s.&quot; That logic held true for the Queens Boulevard Wendy&apos;s, which has been better known to New Yorkers as McDowell&apos;s from <em>Coming To America</em>, Eddie Murphy&apos;s first and greatest foray into playing multiple characters on film. The building&apos;s outer facade hasn&apos;t changed much since the 1988 film, so it is with great sadness we relay the message that it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509221424/http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2013/06/14/queens-boulevard-loses-a-movie-icon-disguised-as-a-fast-food-joint/?mod=WSJBlog">will soon be demolished to make way</a> for a $105-million, six-story structure with luxury apartments and ground-floor stores. So long to Golden Arcs and Big Micks.</p>

<p>In case you aren&apos;t familiar with the fantastic film, McDowell&apos;s is the Queens restaurant that Murphy&apos;s character Prince Akeem goes to work for when he&apos;s pretending to be a poor foreign student. McDowell&apos;s was restaurateur Cleo McDowell&apos;s blatant attempt to copy McDonald&apos;s, with the &quot;Big Mac&quot; becoming the &quot;Big Mick&quot; (&quot;both contain two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles and onions. But they use a sesame seed bun. My buns have no seeds.&quot;). </p>

<p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s sort of a historical landmark for me,&#x201D; John Amos, who played McDowell in the film, said to the Wall Street Journal. &#x201C;There is an attachment to the brick and mortar, but everything crumbles in time and you have to make way for the new stuff. I guess they call it progress, and in the process we lose a lot of memories.&#x201D; Louie Anderson, who played a cashier in the film, also lamented the loss: &#x201C;Wow! For me, it was not so much a hamburger stand as a chance to appear in a movie that became somewhat iconic,&#x201D; he said. </p>

<p>Anderson <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509221424/https://twitter.com/LouieAnderson/status/345979356327337984">also tweeted about the closing</a> after TrivWorks tried to get the name <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509221424/https://twitter.com/search?q=%23McDowells&amp;src=hash">trending on Saturday</a>. Even though the film is over two decades old, its legacy has endured in affectionate ways, including <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509221424/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/29/coming_to_america_restaurant_gets_t.php">hilarious and obsessively specific reviews on Yelp</a>. While we&apos;re very sad McDowell&apos;s is being turned into some anonymous condos, at least the neighborhood won&apos;t be terrorized by some guy that looks like Samuel L. Jackson anymore:</p>
