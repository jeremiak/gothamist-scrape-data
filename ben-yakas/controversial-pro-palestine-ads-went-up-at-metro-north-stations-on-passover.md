<p>A new nationwide campaign of pro-Palestinian ads comparing Israel to apartheid-era South Africa went up at Metro-North stations on Monday&#x2014;which happened to be Passover. The ad states, &#x201C;Americans Give Israel $3 Billion Per Year! End Apartheid Now! Stop U.S. Aid To Israel.&quot; It was sponsored by American Muslims for Palestine, a national grassroots advocacy organization. And everyone&apos;s favorite virulent Islamaphobe Pamela Geller is pissed off about the &quot;latest blood libel against the Jews.&quot;</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="32713ad1.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429010551im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/32713ad1.jpeg" width="640" height="227" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>She <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429010551/http://www.wnd.com/2013/03/vicious-anti-israel-ads-in-new-york-subway/">writes in a post about the ads</a>, which will appear at 25 Metro North stations and run for four weeks&#x2014;that her group, American Freedom Law Center , plan to unveil a new campaign in response to this one to &quot;expose the lies and massive deceit about ongoing Islamic tyranny.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>This anti-Israel ad is exactly the technique that Hitler&#x2019;s minions used. If you read the writings of Goebbels, the Nazi narrative was that they were the victims. They were the put-upon ones. That&#x2019;s how they sold annihilation. And this is the same thing. It&#x2019;s not surprising that Islamic supremacists would appropriate the propaganda methods of the Third Reich, as they partnered with Hitler and shared the same goal.</blockquote>

<p>Other commuters interviewed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429010551/http://whiteplains.dailyvoice.com/news/anti-israel-ads-westchester-train-stations-spark-debate">by the White Plains Daily Voice</a> didn&apos;t seem quite as offended by the ads as Geller: &#x201C;I feel like the side that decided to put the ad out seems to care about their opinion more than the other side,&#x201D; said Rasheda Oakman. &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t think there&#x2019;s anything wrong with it; I just think if there&#x2019;s someone out there who supports an issue and has the means to publicize that, then that&#x2019;s fine.&#x201D;</p>

<p>But Scott Richman, regional director of AJC Westchester, a Jewish advocacy group, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429010551/http://www.lohud.com/article/20130326/NEWS/303260055?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter&amp;nclick_check=1">told The Journal News that</a> the ad&apos;s message &quot;completely false.&quot; &#x201C;It&#x2019;s an attempt to demonize Israel, linking it to the terrible apartheid regime that existed in South Africa,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s a ridiculous allegation. With apartheid in South Africa, blacks were not citizens and could not vote. In Israel, Palestinians constitute 20 percent of the population. They are full citizens.&#x201D;</p>

<p>The MTA makes it clear in a disclaimer on the poster that it does not endorse the opinions expressed in the ad, which also includes the apartheid-comparing quote from Nobel Peace Prize-winner Desmond Tutu. &#x201C;I&#x2019;ve been very deeply distressed in my visit to the Holy Land; it reminded me so much of what happened to us black people in South Africa,&#x201D; the quote reads.</p>

<p>This is far from the first controversial transit ad from either side on the debate: last September, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429010551/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/12/controversy_over_pro-palestine_ads.php">a different pro-Palestinian ad</a> went up at Metro-North stations. And Geller has spent <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429010551/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/21/pamela_gellers_new_anti-islam_ad_in.php">a lot of time and money</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429010551/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/20/judge_mta_violated_first_amendment.php">successfully forcing</a> the MTA to run her group&apos;s advertisements reminding commuters <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429010551/http://gothamist.com/2012/09/25/vandals_label_hateful_subway_ads_ha.php">to fear and loathe Muslims.</a><br>
