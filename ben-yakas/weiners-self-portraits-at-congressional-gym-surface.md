<p>If Rep. Anthony Weiner thought that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160811055512/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/11/nancy_pelosi_calls_for_anthony_wein.php">announcing</a> he was heading to rehab for his excessive sexting would stop the bleeding of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160811055512/http://gothamist.com/tags/anthonyweiner">Weinergate</a>, he was evidently very wrong: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160811055512/http://www.tmz.com/2011/06/12/anthony-weiner-representative-congress-house-of-representatives-gym-locker-room-photos-pictures/">TMZ has uncovered</a> new &quot;self-portraits&quot; of Weiner, which he took on his Blackberry at the House Members Gym. And it appears that Weiner really, really likes to cradle his balls.</p>

<p>Click through above to see several of the newly surfaced pics. TMZ and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160811055512/http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20070689-503544.html">CBS both confirmed</a> with Congressional sources that the semi-nude pics were taken in both the gym floor and the locker room of the House Members Gym, in the basement of the Rayburn House Office Building. They also say they&apos;ve confirmed that the pics were sent online to at least one woman. </p>

<p>In all, 11 photos were captured of Weiner in various states of undress at the gym, looking slightly less buff than he did in his other <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160811055512/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/06/weinergate_weiner_waxes_extremely_g.php#photo-1">topless pics</a>. You can see the rest of the pics <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160811055512/http://photos.tmz.com/galleries/anthony_weiner_at_the_congressional_gym">here</a>. At least now we have a better idea why he doesn&apos;t want to resign: that gym looks really awesome.</p>
