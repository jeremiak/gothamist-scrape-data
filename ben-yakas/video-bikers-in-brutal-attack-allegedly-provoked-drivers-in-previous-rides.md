                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="10613motor.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203064812im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/10613motor.jpg" width="640" height="436" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>Officials are still trying to sort through <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203064812/http://gothamist.com/tags/motorcyclerallyroadrage">last Sunday&apos;s violent group motorcycle ride</a>, in which a group of motorcyclists brutally beat the SUV driver who collided with at least one rider. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203064812/https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?v=164712113732707">Street FX Motorsport &amp; Graphics has uncovered</a> footage purportedly recorded and uploaded by the same motorcyclist who uploaded the disturbing video of the attack&#x2014;in the video below, you can see a group of motorcyclists repeatedly breaking the law and getting into an altercation with a driver. </p>

<p>You can see the motorcyclists driving down Fresh Pond Road in Ridgewood&#x2014;among other things, they run through red lights, cut off other drivers, and drive in the middle of the road, the wrong side of the street and on the sidewalk. Then around 1:15 point, you can see a group of them swarming a Prius, and one motorcyclist aggressively hitting the passenger side window.</p>

<blockquote>We have all no doubt seen the Range Rover episode that we posted a few days back...What the bikers DIDN&apos;T want you to see, is that they make a habit of these deliberate intimidation techniques year after year. Here is some footage that the original poster had boasted about on his youtube account, and then when shit hit the fan, subsequently removed (no doubt to try make their case as &apos;innocent enthusiasts&apos; look more legitimate).. While I certainly feel for the guy that got ran over (if it is indeed true that all he was doing was &quot;helping the fallen rider&quot;), however in light of these new videos coming to surface, it would definitely NOT seem like the kind of crowd I would want ANYTHING to do with...</blockquote>

<p>It&apos;s hard to tell for sure whether this is the same group who attacked the SUV&#x2014;but Street FX adds in the comments that the video &quot;came from the same biker&apos;s YouTube channel. Circumstantial evidence, but it demonstrates the type this bloke surrounds himself with.&quot; It also appears as though there are riders in both videos (you can see the SUV incident below) wearing red jackets with diamond-shaped emblems on the back.</p>
