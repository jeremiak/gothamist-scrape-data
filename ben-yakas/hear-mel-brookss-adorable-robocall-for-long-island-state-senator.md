<p>National goddamn treasure <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110010328/http://gothamist.com/tags/melbrooks">Mel Brooks</a> is not someone you&apos;d normally associate with politics (unless it involved <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110010328/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgRFQJCHcPw">MERCHANDISING</a>). But Brooks has a great-nephew who happens to be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110010328/http://toddkaminsky.com/">Todd Kaminsky</a>, a State Senator for State Senate District 9 on Long Island. Kaminsky, a Democrat, is currently up for re-election, and has enlisted Brooks in the effort by using his unmistakable voice in an adorable robocall.</p>

<p>Brooks previously did robocalls for Kandinsky in April when he was in a special election to replace Dean Skelos (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110010328/https://soundcloud.com/egeismar/mel-brooks-robocall-for-todd-kaminsky">hear that one here</a>). Here&apos;s what he says in the latest call: </p>

<blockquote>Hello! This is Mel Brooks. Yes, it really is Mel Brooks. Although my real name is Melvin Kaminsky. I&apos;m calling you on behalf of my nephew; actually my great nephew, Todd Kaminsky, who is running for reelection as your State Senator. I&apos;m very proud of Todd. Not only is he a great nephew&#x2014;but he also happens to be a great State Senator. He&apos;s not only smart and talented, but he is absolutely honest&#x2014;which is pretty rare for people in my family. Now, the election is this Tuesday, so write this down. Mel Brooks says: &apos;Vote for Todd Kaminsky on November 8th!&apos; Did you write it down? Good. OK. Do me a favor. Do Long Island a favor. Vote for Todd Kaminsky on Tuesday, November 8th. Write it down again!</blockquote>

<p>&quot;Uncle Mel has always encouraged and supported me, and I&#x2019;m thrilled that he&#x2019;s helping me remind voters to get out and vote on Election Day,&quot; Kaminsky said. You can hear it below.</p>

<p>Kaminsky isn&apos;t the only local politician calling in favors from his famous relatives this election season&#x2014;Amy Schumer recorded an ad on Pandora for her cousin, Sen. Chuck Schumer.</p>
