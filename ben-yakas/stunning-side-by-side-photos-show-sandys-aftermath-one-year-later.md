                            <p>Almost a year ago, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140205185321/http://gothamist.com/tags/hurricanesandy">Hurricane Sandy</a> clobbered the tri-state area, leaving behind a wake of destruction from which the city <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140205185321/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/23/a_year_after_sandy.php">is still recovering</a>. Next week marks the one year anniversary of the devastating storm, and in anticipation of it, photographers including John Moore, Spencer Platt, Andrew Burton and Bruce Bennett went around taking pictures of multiple sites around NY and NJ to show areas that suffered damage during Sandy and how those locations look today. The photos are a compelling look at the lasting impact of the hurricane, and how much (or, in some cases, how little) we&apos;ve recovered from the damage.</p>
