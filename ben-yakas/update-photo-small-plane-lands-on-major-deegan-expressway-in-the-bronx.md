<p>A small plane landed on the Major Deegan Expressway in The Bronx this afternoon. According to officials, the plane made an emergency landing just before 3:30 p.m. on the northbound Major Deegan near Exit 12 (E. 233rd Street) in Van Cortland Park. Four people, including the pilot, were onboard the plane; the three passengers, one man and two women, suffered only minor injuries. We&apos;ll update as we learn more information.</p>
