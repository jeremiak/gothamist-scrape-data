<p>Twenty-eight years ago today, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150112091825/http://gothamist.com/tags/bernhardgoetz">Bernhard Goetz</a> was riding the 2 train when he was confronted by four teens who he said were trying to mug him; Goetz fired five times at them with his unlicensed Smith &amp; Weston, injuring 18-year-old James Ramseur and friends Darrell Cabey, Barry Allen and Troy Canty, all 19. The dramatic shooting sparked a national conversation about vigilante justice&#x2014;even in high schools. Below, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150112091825/http://pbump.net/o3b">watch a vintage video</a> of a high school news show asking students about it. </p>

<p>Ramseur, who had been holding a screwdriver, lapsed into a coma. Goetz was acquitted of attempted murder, but served eight and a half months for gun possession charge. Last year, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150112091825/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/23/man_shot_by_bernhard_goetz_found_de.php">Ramseur died in an apparent suicide</a> 27 years after the incident. Goetz had told us in an e-mail: &quot;It sounds like he was depressed.&quot;</p>

Maybe his suicide was a statement, but I haven&apos;t figured it out.&quot; Goetz was apparently referring to the many years Ramseur served for raping, sodomizing and robbing a pregnant woman in 1986.</p>
