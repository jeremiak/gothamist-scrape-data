<p>In one corner, we have Justin Bieber fanatics, who came into Times Square today to catch a glimpse of their hero during an appearance on MTV&apos;s &quot;The Seven&quot; (the Bieb has been in town doing press for his movie, <em>Never Say Never</em>, making appearances on &quot;The Daily Show&quot; and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120102222217/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/03/video_justin_bieber_booed_at_last_n.php">at MSG</a> for a Knicks game). In the other corner, we have protesters <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120102222217/http://www.observer.com/2011/politics/hundreds-egyptians-rally-times-square">rallying against</a> Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and his crackdown on protesters in Cairo. And lo and behold, from the looks of it, humanity didn&apos;t let us down this time! Do the Mubarak demonstrators really outnumber the True Beliebers? Must be Photoshop. </p>
