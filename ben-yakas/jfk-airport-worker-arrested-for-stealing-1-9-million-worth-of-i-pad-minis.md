<p>Last Monday, 3,600 of the shiny new Apple iPad minis&#x2014;worth around $1.9 million&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503143738/http://gothamist.com/2012/11/15/thousands_of_ipad_minis_stolen_from.php">were stolen from JFK Airport</a> in what police believed was an inside job. And their suspicions have proved to be true: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503143738/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/queens/jfk_airhead_busted_in_ipad_heist_zCVuIAxuJJkSjovrJ6yXLO?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Queens">cops have now arrested</a> JFK employee Renel Rene Richardson for his part in the crime. According to the court papers, police were led to him because he allegedly made suspicious inquiries to co-workers about the shipment and where forklifts might be found.</p>

<p>The caper went down after 11 p.m. on Monday when the thieves used one of the airport&#x2019;s forklifts to load two pallets of the tablet computers into a truck. Police believe Richardson had two accomplices in the heist at the Cargo Air Services building, which is where he also worked&#x2014;it&apos;s also where the notorious <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503143738/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lufthansa_heist">1978 Lufthansa heist</a> (made famous by <em>Goodfellas</em>) took place. Authorities believe Richardson was the inside man who served as the lookout while his two conspirators took the gadgets. </p>

<p>Police haven&apos;t caught the two accomplices yet, and it&apos;s unclear whether the iPads have been recovered. As for those two other suspects, they better hope that life doesn&apos;t imitate <em>Goodfellas</em> in any other respects.</p>
