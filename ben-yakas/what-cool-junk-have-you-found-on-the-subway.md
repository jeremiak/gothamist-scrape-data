<p>This past week, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508161634/http://gothamist.com/2011/07/29/giant_refrigerator_abandoned_on_sub.php">somebody left a giant refrigerator</a> on the B/D/F/M platform at the West 4th St station; and today, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508161634/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/spring_street_tv_station_PhPwAXcMpfmd8sVVnUBLEJ?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">Post reports</a> that two television sets were also abandoned at the 6 train&apos;s Spring Street station. This isn&apos;t exactly a new phenomenon or trend (although the Post might have you believe so), but it got us thinking: what cool junk have <em>you</em> found on the subway?</p>

<p>After years of an incredibly inadequate MTA lost and found department&#x2014;during <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508161634/http://gothamist.com/2007/12/14/subways_lost_an.php">a test of it</a> in 2007, only three of 26 items successfully made it to the office&#x2014;the MTA redesigned their web-based <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508161634/http://lostfound.mtanyct.info/lostfound/">Lost &amp; Found claims system</a>. However, let&apos;s just say that in our recent experiences, we&apos;ve found there&apos;s still a lot of room for improvement in their system.</p>

<p>We&apos;ve <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508161634/http://gothamist.com/2005/12/19/found.php">come across</a> cobras, prosthetic legs, computer mouses, dentures, crutches, boom boxes, and we&apos;ve heard of people coming across everything from used cooking pots to discarded trumpets. An &quot;exasperated&quot; MTA worker told the Post he&apos;s seen even larger items: &quot;I&apos;ve seen futons and sofas, bicycles, shopping carts.&quot; So what is the coolest item you&apos;ve come across on the subway...and have you ever taken an item you found?</p>
