<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428161741/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_AJ0l-JBLY">According to</a> Family Radio preacher/rambler Harold Camping, the Apocalypse is due to start tomorrow at 6 p.m. standard time in every time zone around the world (most likely with an earthquake). And as you might imagine, people are preparing for it in all the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428161741/http://gothamist.com/tags/judgmentday">ridiculous and amusing ways</a> you could hope for...after all, when else will you get to use those <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428161741/http://twitter.com/#!/amandaameer/status/71566820791951360">Rapture pick-up lines</a> you&apos;ve been saving up?</p>

<p>Seriously, Rapturists are all about the earthquake: former MTA worker Robert Fitzpatrick, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428161741/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/13/less_than_192_hours_to_go_until_doo.php">who spent</a> $140,000 of his own money on an ad campaign for Doomsday, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428161741/http://www.silive.com/northshore/index.ssf/2011/05/staten_island_prophet_of_doom.html">told SILive</a> that he just wanted to get out of dodge before the quake begins: &quot;I believe that I will be raptured [instantly transported to heaven]; I hope so, I don&#x2019;t want to be here for the earthquake.&quot; But keep in mind it&apos;s only the start of the end of the world tomorrow, not the actual end&#x2014;the universe won&apos;t explode until five months later, on Oct. 21. </p>

<p>Just because we&apos;ll have a five month lay-away period on the Apocalypse doesn&apos;t mean some May 21st believers think you need to pay your rent anymore: &#x201C;<strong>Am I making my last phone bill? No, I&#x2019;m not paying my cell phone right now because I&#x2019;m going to push it off to the end of the month,</strong>&#x201D; LI resident Jeffrey Hopkins <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428161741/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2011/05/20/long-island-man-convinced-the-end-is-near-stops-paying-bills/">told CBS</a>. He also gave them his own grisly preview of tomorrow, but at least he provides a time stamp on when the earthquake will hit NYC: &#x201C;A huge earthquake that&#x2019;s going to wipe out New Zealand and the Fiji islands and that earthquake is going to move with the time zones.<strong> It&#x2019;s going to take about 17 hours for it to hit New York.&quot;</strong> </p>

<p>In a completely unforeseen turn of events, many New Yorkers seem unconvinced by the prophecy, and have turned to the lowest form of humor to cope with the upcoming tragedy: sarcasm. &quot;It&apos;s a downer...I still haven&apos;t been to [hip Lower East Side restaurant] Beauty &amp; Essex. And don&apos;t I have at least a year to get married or do any of the other things I want to do?&quot; personal trainer Sharon Gordin <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428161741/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/nyers_last_laugh_wOnh3yjjzXqQ3mIlXUUWNO?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">told the Post</a>.</p>

<p>Even some fellow Rapture enthusiasts don&apos;t think Camping&apos;s prediction will turn out to be true: &quot;Nobody knows the exact day when these things are going to happen...&quot;He is misinterpreting the Bible. He&apos;s a false teacher,&quot; Steve Wohlberg, who has written more than two dozen books about the End of Days, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428161741/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/2011/05/20/2011-05-20_end_of_days_not_coming_on_may_21_author_steve_wohlberg_says_but_were_heading_tow.html">told the News</a>. He did praise Camping for his charisma and ability to motivate his followers, but warned, &quot;In my mind, Harold Camping has quite an account to render with God when judgment day comes.&quot; It&apos;s always a bad sign when you&apos;re considered the fringe <em>on</em> the fringe.</p>

<p>But Raptures and Apocalypses aren&apos;t all about death, doom and gloom: they&apos;re also opportunities to have fun on the internet!

<blockquote> As someone who will not be saved I&apos;m looking to make the most of my remaining time here. If YOU&apos;RE someone who WILL be saved and you live in a higher end apartment in one of the more desirable neighborhoods in Brooklyn I&apos;d be interested in subletting until your return...I am slightly flexible on rent, but I think the true benefit would be knowing that on your return you&apos;ll find your domicile has been well cared for and no matter how long you&apos;ve been gone there will be no chance of me trying to hold on to it.</blockquote>
