										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="81411construction.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150915013355im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/81411construction.jpg" width="250" height="362" class="image-left"> </span>Two years ago, the eagle eyes at the NY Post spied some <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150915013355/http://gothamist.com/tags/worldtradecenter">World Trade Center</a> workers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150915013355/http://gothamist.com/2009/06/28/some_wtc_construction_workers_enjoy.php">enjoying some alcoholic beverages</a> during their lunch breaks, and broke the shocking news that construction workers sometimes drink on the job. And today, to their utter disbelief, the Post reports that WTC hardhats <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150915013355/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/ground_zero_booze_crews_get_sloshed_nWsVmMt99XeJNb8NnYyHWI">are still boozing</a> at lunchtime at the same spots they did two years ago.  </p>

<p>The dallie says they spotted two dozen workers go north from the site each day at about 11:45 a.m. and pack into two Murray Street watering holes&#x2014; Eamonn&apos;s Irish Bar &amp; Restaurant and Uncle Mike&apos;s&#x2014;for their hourlong lunch breaks. They say most of the union workers skipped lunch in favor of beer, whiskey and vodka, while trading stories about their hazardous job: &quot;I got hit by a two-by-four the other day, bro. It went boom...I got a concussion, bro. They wanted me to go to a hospital,&quot; they overheard one Heineken drinker, with a large bandage on the back of his bald head, say. </p>

<p>More than 3,000 construction workers have been hard at work at WTC in the past three years. With less than a month before the 10th anniversary of 9/11, the plaza and 9/11 museum pavilion <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150915013355/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/27/exclusive_world_trade_center_progre.php#photo-1">seem just about complete</a>, and workers have reached the 78th floor of 1 World Trade Center. A Port Authority insider told the Post that they don&apos;t need any bad press right now: &quot;This is the last thing we need. We can&apos;t have monitors for all those workers.&quot; After the initial allegations of drinking two years ago, the PA investigated and fired several workers. And PA spokesman Ron Marsico says that checks on workers have continued: &quot;We do have a zero-tolerance policy. If we determine a worker is intoxicated on the job, we will move to terminate him, and we&apos;ve done so in the past.&quot;</p>
