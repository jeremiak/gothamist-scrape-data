<p>There&apos;s a fantastic <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161216145302/http://www.vulture.com/2016/12/seth-meyers-late-night-c-v-r.html">profile piece in Vulture</a> this week about how <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161216145302/http://gothamist.com/tags/sethmeyers">Seth Meyers</a> has embraced his political voice and turned the show into must-watch late night TV under President-elect Trump. In addition to showing the process by which the show is put together, <em>Late Night</em> writer Sal Gentile described how Meyers and the writers want to fight the proliferation of propaganda and misinformation through segments like &quot;A Closer Look,&quot; which is &quot;well-suited to the period we&apos;re about to enter &#x2014; we can be sort of a daily check-in with reality.&quot;</p>

<p>In this week&apos;s first check-in with reality, Meyers examined Trump&apos;s reaction to the CIA&apos;s report on Russia hacking the election, and his preference for giving away free hats over listening to intelligence briefings. Meyers also looked at Exxon CEO Rex Tillerson, Trump&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161216145302/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/12/us/politics/rex-tillerson-secretary-of-state-trump.html?_r=0">just-announced pick</a> for Secretary of State, and his close ties to Putin.  &quot;Stop telling us to, &apos;stay tuned,&apos;&quot; he said, referring to Trump&apos;s tendency to treat politics like a reality TV game show. &quot;You&apos;re President-elect for the next four years. Like it or not, we&apos;re all fucking tuned.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;We&apos;re about to enter a potentially dangerous period: a president with a weird affinity for authoritarians and dictators, appointing plutocrats to his cabinet and fighting with America&apos;s own intelligence agencies,&quot; Meyers said. &quot;I don&apos;t see how Trump can get away with all this. Unless he finds a way to distract us all for the next four years.&quot; Like with, say, free hats.</p>
