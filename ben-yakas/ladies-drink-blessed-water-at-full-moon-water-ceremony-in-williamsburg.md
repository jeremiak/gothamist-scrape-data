<p>Are you looking for the most Brooklynish Brooklyn event in all the land, something you could perhaps participate in on a lazy Sunday? Then you&apos;re clearly in luck this weekend: there&apos;s a full moon tomorrow night, which <em>everyone knows</em> means there&apos;ll be a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420052644/http://carriagehousebirth.com/event/full-moon-water-ceremony/">Full Moon Water Ceremony</a> happening in Williamsburg. And it&apos;ll be taking place at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420052644/http://carriagehousebirth.com/">Carriage House Birth</a>, the birthing collective run by Domino Kirke, sister of <em>Girls&apos;</em> Jemima Kirke. Barring <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420052644/http://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/03/06/fashion/the-monocle-returns-as-a-fashion-accessory.html?referrer=">a monocle dress code</a>, what more could you possibly want? </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420052644/http://bedfordandbowery.com/2014/03/cure-sundays-hangover-by-drinking-blessed-water-at-a-full-moon-ceremony/">Bedford and Bowery points out</a> the event, in which women (and women only, sorry dudes) celebrate the full moon and Mother Gaia and babies and everything that is pure in this world by drinking blessed water from a sacred bowl. </p>

<blockquote>Join us for a sacred circle of sisters to celebrate the Full Moon! We will be working with the element of water to increase our ability to &#x2018;flow&#x2019; with all of the challenges life blesses us with. Each month we will focus our intentions of love and gratitude into our sacred water bowl to re-crystalize the water with our positive thoughts, a powerful practice shown in the beautiful photographs of Masaru Emoto. We, and the Earth, are more than 70% water. Living in NY we are surrounded by this beautiful element. The Full Moon is the most powerful time for working with water, &#x2018;the Mother of All&#x2019;. After the ceremony we will drink the water blessed with love and gratitude into our bodies, re-setting the water within us to resonate with those magnified intentions. The remaining water will be poured into the East River, surrounding our city!</blockquote>

<p>The event starts at 6 p.m., so you&apos;ll have plenty of time beforehand to sleep-in, devour brunch, waste time on the internet, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420052644/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/16/realestate/for-starters-the-upper-east-side.html?referrer=">hate-read the Times</a>, and whatever else you love to do on Sundays. And for any dudes who feel left out, East Village occult store Enchantments will be hosting a co-ed celebration of the full moon from 5-8 p.m. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420052644/https://www.eventbrite.com/e/march-full-moon-ceremony-tickets-10400725851">You can buy tickets here.</a></p>
