<p>A man was stabbed in the neck by another customer at a Chelsea sex shop last night.</p>

<p>Police say the incident happened around 12:40 a.m. at 725 Video, a 24-hour sex shop on 6th Avenue near 23rd Street. The two men, neither of whom worked at the shop, were engaged in an argument (it&apos;s unclear what it was about) when the 20-year-old suspect stabbed a 54-year-old man in the neck. The suspect fled the store, and the victim was taken to Bellevue Hospital in stable condition.</p>

<p>&quot;I heard people fighting, looked over and next thing I know a guy is bleeding on the ground,&quot; a witness <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108030039/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/chelsea-sex-store-shopper-stabs-man-54-neck-argument-article-1.2814162">told the Daily News</a>. &quot;The guy stabbed him in the throat and just ran out the door.&quot;</p>

<p>Police described the suspect as wearing a green shirt with a white stripe, a black jacket and blue jeans. No arrests have been made, and the investigation is ongoing.</p>
