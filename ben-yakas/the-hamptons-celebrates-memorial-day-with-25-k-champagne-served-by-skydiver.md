<p>It feels comforting to know that in a world in which so many things are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150513081535/http://gothamist.com/tags/gaymarriage">changing for the better</a>, some things will always remain the same: hot dog hookers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150513081535/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/25/hot_dog_hooker_arrested_for_prostit.php">will keep hot dog hooking</a>, Chris Christie and Snooki <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150513081535/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/25/chris_christie_and_snooki_meet_stil.php">will never be friends</a>, and the club elite in the Hamptons will always find the douchiest ways imaginable to imbibe ridiculously expensive alcohol. Because everyone knows that the only thing cooler than a $25K bottle of champagne is a $25K bottle of champagne chilled during a 10,000-foot free-fall and served by a skydiver. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150513081535/http://www.nypost.com/p/pagesix/high_end_hamptons_bubbly_bdKLJuMAvTisUm79I7jP2I">The Post has a report</a> about some of the more decadent happenings during Memorial Day Weekend from the center of linen-pants land. Derek and Daniel Koch&#x2019;s Day &amp; Night brunch at Gurney&#x2019;s Inn in Montauk is responsible for the skydive service described above. The skydiver will be carrying a &quot;chilled&quot; magnum of Dom P&#xE9;rignon Ros&#xE9; Luminour &#x201C;delivered to your table by parachute.&#x201D; If airborne alcohol isn&apos;t quite your bag, you can always spring for the $30K methuselahs of Dom P&#xE9;rignon at club Pink Elephant, which sounds like the type of party Stefon might show up for some light pre-gaming.</p>

<p>But there&apos;s an important reason why these elite tennis dabblers overcompensate with these kinds of pricey shenanigans, and it&apos;s not just to try to stave off the inevitability of death that looms over all of our lives: the Hamptons way of life as we know it is being threatened by daytripping, beer-swilling outsiders. &#x201C;There was a time when you had to be on the inside to be part of the Hamptons, and that&#x2019;s not true anymore,&#x201D; East Hampton-based author Steven Gaines <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150513081535/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/26/nyregion/as-boozy-invaders-hit-beach-hamptons-sound-snooki-alert.html?hp">told the Times</a>. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s become a tourist stop, and it has lost some of its exclusivity.&#x201D;</p>

<p>&#x201C;You don&#x2019;t want to come across as snooty, but it&#x2019;s about peace and quiet for all of us,&#x201D; said Dayna Winter, a registered dietitian and a year-round Hamptons resident. She may have accidentally stumbled upon the true source behind this nefarious conspiracy to turn the Hamptons into another Jersey Shore: mother nature. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s not a party scene; it&#x2019;s not what we want it to become,&quot; she said.<strong> &quot;With the devastation of Sandy, we&#x2019;re all a little nervous.&#x201D;</strong></p>
