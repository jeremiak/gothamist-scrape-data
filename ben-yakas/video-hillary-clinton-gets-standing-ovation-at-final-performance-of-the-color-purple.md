<p>When Vice President-elect Mike Pence attended a showing of <em>Hamilton</em> in November, he was greeted with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170111180507/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/19/mike_pence_gets_booed_at_hamilton_w.php#photo-1">resounding boos</a> and a plea for tolerance from the cast. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170111180507/http://gothamist.com/tags/hillaryclinton">Hillary Clinton</a> elicited a dramatically different reaction yesterday when she attended the final performance of <em>The Color Purple</em> on Broadway, receiving multiple standing ovations from the audience as well as another round of applause after being acknowledged on stage by the cast.</p>

<p>Clinton was attending the show with husband Bill and daughter Chelsea, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170111180507/http://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/01/08/theater/hillary-clinton-the-color-purple-closing-performance.html?smid=fb-nytimes&amp;smtyp=cur&amp;referer=http://m.facebook.com">according to the Times</a>. Actress Patrice Covington, who gave a farewell speech on behalf of the cast after the show, pointed her out toward the end: &#x201C;There&#x2019;s a lot of really awesome famous and notable people here today,&quot; she said. &quot;I&#x2019;m not going to call all of them out &#x2014; I know you already know them,&quot; looking in Clinton&apos;s direction before the crowd erupted once more in applause.</p>

<p>One theatergoer summed up the frustration of many who were there: &quot;I was having every emotion I&#x2019;ve tried to get rid of over the past few weeks,&#x201D; Jordan Serpone told the Times, noting he shook Clinton&apos;s hand at one point yesterday. &quot;She shouldn&#x2019;t be here. She should be planning her cabinet.&quot;</p>

<p>Clinton has made sporadic <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170111180507/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/25/hillary_clintons_neighbors_create_h.php">public appearances</a> in the weeks since the election&#x2014;she also has been the subject of some very far-fetched rumormongering regarding <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170111180507/http://gothamist.com/2017/01/06/imagen_mayor_hillary.php">what she might do next.</a> <br>
