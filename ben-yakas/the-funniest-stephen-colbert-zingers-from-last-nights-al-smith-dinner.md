<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203072914/http://gothamist.com/tags/stephencolbert">Stephen Colbert</a> was the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203072914/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/18/nyregion/at-al-smith-dinner-colbert-doesnt-spare-politicians.html?_r=0">keynote speaker</a> at the 68th annual Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation charity dinner last night at the Waldorf Astoria&#x2014;and he spent the full 14 minutes of his speech zinging NYC&apos;s rich and powerful. And that motley crew included Christine Quinn, Ray Kelly, Cardinal Timothy Dolan, Governor Andrew Cuomo, and of course, diminutive Mayor Bloomberg: &#x201C;In all seriousness, tonight is really about the littlest among us,&#x201D; said Colbert. &#x201C;Speaking of which, is Mayor Bloomberg here? Mayor Bloomberg can you stand on your chair or something? Or wave something, sir?&quot;</p>

<p>Here were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203072914/http://www.politico.com/story/2013/10/stephen-colbert-al-smith-dinner-98520.html?hp=l12">some of the highlights</a>:</p>

<p><strong>Dolan</strong>: &#x201C;I have great respect for Cardinal Dolan, though I do have to say sir, it is not easy when you&#x2019;re wearing that outfit. In that cape and red sash, you look like a matador who&#x2019;s really let himself go,&#x201D; he said to Dolan, who was among dozens seated on stage. &#x201C;Did you not see the invite?&#x201D; he added. &#x201C;It said &#x2018;black tie&#x2019; - not &#x2018;flamboyant Zorro.&#x2019;&#x201D;</p>

<p><strong>Quinn</strong>: Future mayor of New York City Christine Quinn is with us tonight. I&#x2019;m sorry, I wrote that a long time ago. I apologize. Is she here? She&#x2019;s not here. I thought she was a shoo-in, I really did. I mean, New York City is the only place in the world where the lesbian candidate was too conservative.&#x201D;</p>

<p><strong>Cuomo</strong>: &quot;[It&apos;s] an honor to be here on the stage with you. I didn&#x2019;t know how you could possibly tear yourself away from the excitement that is Albany on a Thursday evening. I believe it&#x2019;s all-you-can-eat iceberg lettuce night at the Sizzler.&#x201D;</p>

<p><strong>Kelly</strong>: &#x201C;Are you alone tonight or did you bring the whole biker gang?&quot; [The crowd audibly cringed] &quot;I&#x2019;m in trouble&#x2026;I gotta change my door locks.&#x201D;</p>

<p><strong>Bloomberg</strong>: &quot;You&#x2019;re a wonderful mayor, sir. You&#x2019;re very patient, very patient with such jokes, very patient man, and also very tiny, very tiny man. The real reason he doesn&#x2019;t want drink cups larger than 16 ounces is because he&#x2019;s afraid he might drown in one.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Video of the event, which raised $3 million for childrens&#x2019; charity, isn&apos;t online yet. In the meantime, go ahead and watch five minutes of Colbert breaking character on his show below.</p>
