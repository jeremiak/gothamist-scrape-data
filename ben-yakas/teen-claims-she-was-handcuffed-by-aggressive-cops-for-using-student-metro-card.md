<p>A 15-year-old Harlem student claims she was roughed up, handcuffed, and detained by aggressive cops who mistakenly thought she was too old to be using a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150107121054/http://gothamist.com/tags/studentmetrocard">student MetroCard</a>. &#x201C;They called me liar,&#x201D; Alexis Sumpter <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150107121054/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/harlem-teen-cuffed-held-metrocard-flap-article-1.1126674">told the News</a> of the July 26 incident. &#x201C;Then they grabbed me by my arms and flung me up the stairs. I kept saying, &apos;I&#x2019;m only 15&#x2014;why are you guys doing this?&apos; They said they didn&#x2019;t owe me an explanation.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Sumpter, who attends Harlem Village Academies, was on her way to her first day at a marketing internship on Canal Street when two plainclothes cops spotted her using her student MetroCard at the 125th Street Station. &#x201C;They didn&#x2019;t approach me in a calm manner and they were very rude the whole time,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;They were talking to me like they were trying to show they were superior to me.&#x201D; The DOE confirmed the card is valid until Aug. 17.</p>

<p>The cops demanded to know how old she was, but didn&apos;t believe her when she said she was 15&#x2014;she told them she didn&apos;t have ID because she had recently been mugged for her iPhone and wallet. She says a third cop joined them, and pressed her face to a wall while the other two cuffed her. Cops called her father, who vouched that she was 15; still not believing her, they called her mother, who rushed over <em>with her daughter&apos;s birth certificate</em>. Alexis was held in custody for 90 minutes altogether, and wasn&apos;t arrested or given a summons; but she did go to the hospital because the handcuffs caused swelling on her wrists.</p>

<p>Alexis says she avoids that train now: &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t want to see them again,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t want to have to go through that again.&#x201D; The whole situation sounds eerily similar to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150107121054/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/02/student_arrested_for_36_hours_by_ny.php">frivolous arrest of a 21-year-old female student</a> who was held by NYPD for 36 hours for not carrying ID in Riverside Park&#x2014;Sumpter&apos;s situation also calls to mind the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150107121054/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/08/couple_arrested_for_dancing_on_subw.php">Charleston-dancing couple who claims they spent 23 hours in custody</a> for dancing while waiting for the subway. <br>
