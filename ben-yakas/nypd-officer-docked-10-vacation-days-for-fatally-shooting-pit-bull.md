Officer Andre Jeter pleaded guilty to departmental charges in the 2009 shooting of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130222032140/http://gothamist.com/tags/pitbull">pit bull</a>, to avoid an NYPD trial. Jeter was accused of shooting the dog an excessive number of times during the altercation. &#x201C;It is an unusually heavy penalty for a dog shooting. But it shows how they go over every shooting with a fine-tooth comb,&#x201D; a police source told the News.<p></p>

<p>The incident occurred on June 8, 2009, when Jeter and his partner, Officer Ansari Kalil were patrolling the Breukelen Houses in Canarsie. Responding to reports of a pit bull owner making threats to another man, the officers followed the suspect to the roof. &#x201C;When they opened the door to the roof the pit bull charges out and jumps on [Kalil], knocking him to the ground and biting him on the wrist,&#x201D; said Deputy Inspector Kim Royster, an NYPD spokeswoman. &#x201C;The officer struggled with the dog and gets the dog off him, but now the officers can&#x2019;t get the door open. The dog heads up the stairs towards them and that&#x2019;s when they fire.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Jeter fired three times, and Kalil fire twice. The dog fell to the ground still alive; that&apos;s when Jeter fired two more shots, killing the dog. While Kalil wasn&apos;t charged with anything, Jeter was charged for firing those last two shots when he was &#x201C;no longer in danger.&#x201D; </p>

<p>In November, an Upper East Side man was arraigned for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130222032140/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/17/pit_bull_may_have_been_used_by_owne.php">bludgeoning his roommate to death</a>, using his pit bull as a weapon in the attack. And last summer in Trenton, a pit bull <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130222032140/http://www.nj.com/mercer/index.ssf/2011/06/trenton_pit_bull_survives_afte.html">survived being shot in the head</a> by a police officer during a foot chase.</p>
