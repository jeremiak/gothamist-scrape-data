<p>A woman was arrested after a terrifying incident in which she allegedly shoved another woman into an oncoming train earlier this week.</p>

<p>Police say the incident happened around 5 p.m. on Monday at the Prince Street station in SoHo. The 50-year-old victim, whose name hasn&apos;t been released, was waiting for a northbound N train when the suspect, 62-year-old Patricia Abraham, allegedly approached her from behind and shoved her into the oncoming train.</p>

<p>Remarkably, the woman was not killed in the incident&#x2014;she bounced off the side of the train. The victim then boarded the train to escape her attacker, and reported the incident to police when she got off. She suffered injuries to her shoulder, neck and back in the incident.</p>

<p>Transit police spotted Abraham on Tuesday at the Union Square station, and arrested her. She has been charged with assault and reckless endangerment, and was taken to Bellevue Hospital for an evaluation.
