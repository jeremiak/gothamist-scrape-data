Victim Luis Ruiz was trying to cross the street against the light around 9 p.m. last night at the intersection of Rockaway Parkway and Ave J when he was struck by a green Mitsubishi Montero that was traveling northbound on Rockaway. He was then fatally struck by another car, who fled the scene. &#x201C;I saw him crossing the street but the light was green. I tried to yell to him but it was too late,&#x201D; a witness <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504134536/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/klyn_man_killed_in_hit_and_run_accident_lZu3FK03Lpg1P8aCFh68KK">told the Post.</a><p></p>

<p>According <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504134536/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Brooklyn-Deadly-Hit-Run-Canarsie-Rockaway-Avenue-J-165815006.html">to NBC</a>, the Mitsubishi driver slammed on the brakes to try to avoid hitting Ruiz. But while he was on the ground from the first hit, a second car&#x2014;a dark-colored sedan&#x2014;ran over him. Ruiz, a widower and former merchant marine who lived three blocks from where he was struck, was pronounced dead at the scene. The driver of the Mitsubishi stayed at the scene, and no charges were filed against him; police are searching for the other driver who fled.</p>
