<p>We&apos;ve <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130510161702/http://gothamist.com/2005/03/09/warm_yourself_at_alta.php">long been fans</a> of West Village candlelit joint Alta and its Mediterranean-style tapas food, but anyone who ate there last week might be reconsidering doing so right about now. The Department of Health sent out a warning yesterday that anyone who ate dessert there last week may be at risk of contracting Hepatitis A, which is spread by putting something in your mouth that has been contaminated with traces of fecal matter from an infected person. </p>

<p>According to the warning, any patron who ate dessert at Alta from March 23rd - April 2nd is considered at risk and is recommended to receive a preventive vaccine. The infected staff member, a woman in the pastry kitchen, has since been fired: &#x201C;That employee traveled to Mexico and was infected with hepatitis A,&#x201D; Alta manager Manny Solano said outside the restaurant last night. &#x201C;We are working closely with the Health Department to ensure the safety of our customers and our employees as well.&#x201D;</p>

<p>The restaurant owners estimate that about 3,000 people may have visited during the 11 day period, with about 15% having eaten dessert&#x2014;so approximately 450 people are at risk. Symptoms include jaundice (yellowing of eyes and skin), fatigue, abdominal pain, nausea, and diarrhea. </p>

<p>Thankfully, no cases have been reported yet, but the city will offer free vaccinations at its Chelsea Health Center at 303 Ninth Ave. today and tomorrow from 2 to 6 p.m. and Monday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. to anyone who is worried. </p>

<p>In a shocking coincidence, patrons at the restaurant last night were told that they couldn&apos;t order any desserts because the oven was broken. &#x201C;I think it&#x2019;s a little suspicious that the oven is broken on the same night that the press is here telling us that the pastry chef had hepatitis,&#x201D; Martine Seiden <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130510161702/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/pass_on_the_pastry_A7jAP60rbsOuILnZBktLuM">told the Post.</a></p>
