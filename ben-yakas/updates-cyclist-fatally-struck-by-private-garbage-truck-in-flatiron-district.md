<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130803002735/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/pedestrian_fatally_struck_by_truck_MuWC6gDILFPLDvz2VxMTGM?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20Manhattan">According to the Post</a>, the victim was a cyclist who was headed eastbound on East 23rd Street. The blonde woman, who they say appeared to be her in 60s, was not wearing a helmet. &quot;He clipped her, and she just rolled and fell underneath the wheel,&quot; said street vendor and witness Greg Lamans. &quot;Her legs ended up where her arms would be. Her legs were above her head.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: Witness Wendy Slater, who took the photo below, told us she got to the scene about 15 minutes after the incident occurred: &quot;The woman was still under the garbage truck. Her bike and purse were on the sidewalk in front of Spin,&quot; she said. As of 3:15 p.m., &quot;the truck is still here. The M23 that was behind it is still here too. They are just now removing her body.&quot; </p>
