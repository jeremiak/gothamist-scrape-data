<p>Setting aside all the mental and physical health benefits, exercise can only lead to crippling self-doubt, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429201518/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/26/adult_nyers_now_paying_to_take_rece.php">infantilism</a>, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429201518/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/02/new_trend_exercise_is_destroying_ma.php">adultery.</a> Here&apos;s yet another reason never to get off the couch: exercising can get you in trouble with the law. That&apos;s what happened to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429201518/https://twitter.com/petershankman/with_replies">Peter Shankman</a> this week when he was given a summons for running in Central Park too early in the morning. &quot;Most people who&apos;ve gotten in touch think it&apos;s a bogus charge, and have mentioned end of the month quotas as a reason I didn&apos;t just get a warning,&quot; he told us today.</p>

<p>Shankman, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429201518/http://shankman.com/">who is</a> an &quot;author, entrepreneur, speaker, and worldwide connector,&quot; was stopped by cops around 4:30 a.m. on Thursday morning while running near 85th Street on the East Side of the park. Here&apos;s his account of what happened, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429201518/https://www.facebook.com/PeterShankman/posts/10151946754021674?stream_ref=10">via Facebook</a>:</p>

<blockquote>At 4:30 this morning in Central Park, at mile 2 of my ten mile run, I was stopped by the police and given a summons for exercising in the park &quot;before it opened.&quot; Apparently, Central Park doesn&apos;t &quot;open&quot; until 6am, and my exercising (running) in the park before 6am is illegal. Note - Running in the park. Not &quot;performing sex acts for crack,&quot; or &quot;laying down explosive charges,&quot; but &quot;running.&quot; Because apparently, a 215 pound man running through Central Park at just over a 9:10 pace is a threat to Manhattan.

<p>To answer the question of why I was running so early - I needed to do ten miles today as part of Ironman training. If I didn&apos;t start that early, I wouldn&apos;t be done before my first meeting of the day.</p>

<p>A &quot;hey, buddy, the park doesn&apos;t open until six, you need to run on the sidewalk outside&quot; from the police officer wouldn&apos;t have sufficed? Apparently not, since he made it clear that his boss was in the car with him, so he had to write me up. </p>

<p>I now get to go to court in May and fight this. What a waste of taxpayer money, and my time. Ridiculous.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>Seeing as how he&apos;s someone <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429201518/http://shankman.com/about/">who is &quot;redefining the art of networking,&quot;</a> he also tweeted his frustrations:</p>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>It&apos;s almost 9am, and the good news is that I haven&apos;t been given a summons for anything so far this morning.</p>&#x2014; Peter Shankman (@petershankman) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429201518/https://twitter.com/petershankman/statuses/439397915938013184">February 28, 2014</a></blockquote>

<p>Technically speaking, the cops were right: Central Park is closed between 1 a.m. and 6 a.m. But Shankman says there was no signage where he entered the park at 63rd Street and Central Park West indicating this (&quot;No gates, no signs, no traffic cones blocking my way&quot;), and he&apos;s done this early morning run before without a hitch.</p>

<p>&quot;Knowing the law now, I get the spirit of it, i.e., the park closes at 1 a.m. to avoid people sleeping on the benches, or camping out, or etc,&quot; Shankman told us. &quot;But I don&apos;t feel I violated that&#x2014;I didn&apos;t &quot;break the curfew&quot; by staying out late&#x2014;I came in early to workout. And therein lies the irony&#x2014;I was trying to get in better shape&#x2014;exactly the point of all the other laws the last 12 years have seen, from no smoking in bars to no big gulps full of sugary sodas.&quot;</p>

<p>Shankman added that the officer who wrote him the ticket was completely professional and doing his job: &quot;Could he have just given me a warning? Sure. But I don&apos;t think for a second that he was rude, or bullying, or anything like that.&quot; He plans on fighting the ticket in court. </p>

<p>At least he learned a very valuable lesson: exercising is never worth the risk.</p>
