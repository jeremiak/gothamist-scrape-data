<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170319164226/http://gothamist.com/tags/sethmeyers">Seth Meyers</a> came up with the perfect analogy for Donald Trump after a week in which he stumbled on everything from health care to immigration to his bullshit wiretapping claims. While Trump continues to try to brag about how much he&apos;s accomplished in office, Meyers retorted, &quot;Trump has done more in office the way a toddler helps out in the kitchen. He may be trying, but by the time he leaves, there&#x2019;s snot on the fridge and a shoe in the dishwasher.&quot;</p>

<p>But the thing which really sets Meyers off is Trump&apos;s latest proposed budget cuts, which include the EPA, the National Endowment for the Arts and...Meals on Wheels. That last one definitely hit close to home:</p>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">My mom, who is also my hero, is a Meals on Wheels volunteer so I had some thoughts in tonight&apos;s A CLOSER LOOK <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170319164226/https://t.co/qAVTZPLL6Y">https://t.co/qAVTZPLL6Y</a></p>&#x2014; Seth Meyers (@sethmeyers) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170319164226/https://twitter.com/sethmeyers/status/842554812893974528">March 17, 2017</a></blockquote>

<p>&quot;Cuts to the Environmental Protection Agency? Saw that coming,&quot; Meyers said. &quot;The only environments you care for are fairways and greens and that endangered marshland you call a haircut. Cuts to the National Endowment for the Arts? Again, not surprised. The only art you like are paintings of yourself where they take out the neck fat. But Meals on Wheels? Meals on Wheels? How dead inside do you have to be to not want old people to get food? Your heart is so small it makes your tiny hands look like catcher mitts&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;Old people voted for you,&quot; he continued. &quot;Your key demographics were old people and older people. They believed you when you said you cared about them. There&apos;s nothing more lowlife than lying to the elderly. You should know that&#x2014;you&apos;re 70. Don&apos;t you hate it when people [Melania] lie to you and say things like, &apos;I&apos;ll try to make it down next week, it&apos;s just I&apos;m on Kayak and there&apos;s just no flights.&apos;&quot;</p>
