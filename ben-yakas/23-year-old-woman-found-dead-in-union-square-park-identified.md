<p>Yesterday morning, a young woman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150722235104/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/09/woman_found_dead_in_union_square_pa.php">was found dead</a> in Union Square Park. Police have now identified the woman as 23-year-old homeless woman Kayla Mitchell. Residents of the park say Mitchell, originally from Massachusetts, had been a mainstay for a long time, and had lived there for much of the last year with her dog Buster. &#x201C;She was terrific,&#x201D; homeless friend, David Welsh, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150722235104/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/gal_dead_in_union_sq_FNiXqHp72eIfDLjc81XNaK">told the Post</a>. &#x201C;She had a gorgeous laugh.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Mitchell&apos;s body was found by a Parks Department employee around 7:30 a.m. Thursday in a grassy part of the park under a tree, opposite 10 Union Square East. Police said the cause of death has not yet been determined, but investigators do not suspect any criminality was involved. Another homeless man, Jay Kidd, told the Post he&#x2019;s talking to police about keeping 8-month-old Buster, who had to be dragged away from his owner&#x2019;s body.</p>
