<p>There are grifts <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140221070734/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocCWEBSC4-0">involving John Cusack</a>, and then there are grifts involving people <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140221070734/http://www.hulu.com/watch/1080">faking deadly diseases.</a> But Long Island prosecutors say this is no <em>Arrested Development</em> plotline: a 21-year-old woman has been arrested and accused of pretending to have ovarian, stomach, bone and brain cancer to trick her family and strangers into sending her money for &#x201C;treatment&#x201D;&#x2014;which actually was a serious heroin addiction.</p>

<p>&#x201C;This defendant perpetrated an absolutely despicable scam,&#x201D; said Suffolk DA Thomas Spota. &#x201C;<strong>There was no cancer, no chemotherapy, no radiation, and no medical bills. There was just heroin.&#x201D;</strong> Where does this rank on the scale with faking leukemia <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140221070734/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/10/worst_bridezilla_ever_woman_indicte.php">for a free wedding</a>?</p>

<p>Prosecutors say that over the last 13 months, Brittany Ozarowski, of Medford, bilked her family, friends and strangers out of thousands of dollars <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140221070734/http://www.brittanyozarowski.com/">through her website</a>, which bares the heading &quot;Help Save My Life.&quot; She writes on the page:</p>

<blockquote>In September of 2011 I was diagnosed with stage two ovarian cancer as well as stomach cancer. After multiple treatments of both radiation and chemotherapy I had beaten cancer as of December 2011.

<p>I was cancer free until they had found a tumor on my left hip in February 2012. That is when I found out that I have bone cancer. The cancer has spread to my spine as well as my brain. So once again I was in need of radiation treatments as well as chemotherapy treatments.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>Ozarowski <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140221070734/http://www.newsday.com/long-island/suffolk/da-medford-woman-lied-about-cancer-to-get-money-for-heroin-1.5044890">also claimed</a> she was in a terrible car accident, and she had a Facebook page sharing a lengthy story about her severe injuries, all of which prosecutors say was completely untrue. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140221070734/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2013/04/10/da-l-i-woman-faked-having-cancer-to-get-money-for-drugs/">According to CBS</a>, Ozarowski told former classmates at Newfield High School that her hair didn&#x2019;t fall out due to special vitamins. Detectives said she forged letters and documents from doctors and hospitals to keep up the facade, and wouldn&apos;t accept rides to her treatments.</p>

<p>&#x201C;The truth is she is a 21-year-old drug addict with four open narcotics cases and we have strong evidence she forged doctors&#x2019; notes to avoid court appearances,&#x201D; Spota said.</p>

<p>Among her alleged victims was Walter Warren, who lost his 19-year-old son, Kenny, to lymphoma in 2007. &#x201C;Her story was so compelling,&#x201D; he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140221070734/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/she_cancer_1OiOefJmc9VkLXUJ83ev2O">told the Post</a>. &#x201C;I got very emotional when I met her, because it brought back a lot of really tough memories. I wanted to help.&#x201D; Warren took part <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140221070734/http://www.brittanyozarowski.com/fundraiser">in several fundraisers</a>, including a dinner dance and a charity dog-grooming, to raise money for Ozarowski.</p>

<p>Her family was allegedly duped as well: Ozarowski&apos;s father Thomas McDermott cleaned out his retirement savings to donate $25,000. Ozarowski&#x2019;s grandmother sold her Selden home several months ago and gave her $100,000 to pay for phantom treatments at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Hospital. </p>
