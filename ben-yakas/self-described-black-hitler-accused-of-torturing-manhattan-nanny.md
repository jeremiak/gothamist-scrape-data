<p>A Manhattan man <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140410041108/http://nypost.com/2014/03/06/black-hitler-allegedly-tortured-held-nanny-hostage/">has been arrested</a> for allegedly kidnapping and torturing his grandson&apos;s nanny for three days in his East Side apartment. Sherman Gamble, 54, allegedly held the 22-year-old woman in his East 23rd Street home between 9 p.m. Saturday and 7 p.m. this past Tuesday. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140410041108/http://nypost.com/2014/03/06/black-hitler-allegedly-tortured-held-nanny-hostage/">Police sources tell the Post</a> that Gamble, who owns Cut Rate Construction, choked the woman until she passed out, &#x201C;beat her with a fist, pulled her hair out and beat her with a cellphone on the head.&#x201D; He also allegedly &quot;rolled up a newspaper and shoved it down her throat, and shouted, &apos;<strong>I am going to kill you. You don&#x2019;t know who I am. I am the black Hitler.&apos;</strong>&quot; The victim is a nanny for Gamble&apos;s 9-year-old grandson; he was reportedly home during the weekend as well.</p>

<p>The woman only escaped when she convinced Gamble to let her go to the bank; she admitted to Beth Israel Hospital, where she was treated for bruising, swelling and pain over her entire body. Gamble has been charged with attempted murder, kidnapping, assault, strangulation, reckless endangerment and weapons possession.</p>

<p>Gamble has been arrested at least five times before, including once for assaulting one of his children. But his ex-wife, and mother of one of his kids, defended him <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140410041108/http://nypost.com/2014/03/06/black-hitler-allegedly-tortured-held-nanny-hostage">to the Post</a>: &quot;It&#x2019;s hard for you to believe that he would torture someone,&quot; Audrey Bailey said. &quot;I&#x2019;ve known him for most of my life and he&#x2019;s not that type of person. That sounds a little funny to me. I am very shocked. That&#x2019;s not the person I know.&quot;</p>
