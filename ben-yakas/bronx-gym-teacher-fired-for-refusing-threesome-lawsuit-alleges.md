<p>A Bronx gym teacher <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405030252/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/education/gym-teacher-fired-refusing-threesome-boss-boyfriend-suit-article-1.1752090">claims she was fired from her job</a> because she turned down a threesome with a fellow gym teacher and her boyfriend. Carisa Gaylardo says in a lawsuit that she was fired from Riverdale Kingsbridge Academy last year due to the efforts of tenured gym teacher Sofia Memos, who waged a campaign against her after Gaylardo rejected repeated advances. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405030252/http://nypost.com/2014/04/10/ex-gym-teacher-claims-she-was-fired-for-refusing-threesome-suit/">Gaylardo claims that</a> Memos &quot;propositioned [her] by text message and in person to engage in an inappropriate romantic and salacious relationship with her and her boyfriend.&quot; About a month after Gaylardo said thanks but no thanks, Gaylardo claims Memos and a second gym teacher created a false story about Gaylardo having an inappropriate relationship with a student.</p>

<p>A schools investigation found that Gaylardo and the teen had traded 1,000 text messages between February and March of 2013. But Gaylardo says she was just a mentor to the teen, who was juggling three sports and school&#x2014;and both the teen and the teen&apos;s mother came to Gaylardo&apos;s defense, filing affidavits supporting the teacher. </p>

<p>&#x201C;It is wrong that such a good person...is suffering simply for helping me with my struggles,&#x201D; the teen wrote. Her mom added that Gaylardo is &quot;a blessing to my daughter and the rest of our family...She is the greatest role model in my daughter&apos;s life.&quot;</p>

<p>But Memos wrote in her complaint to school officials that, &quot;I have observed a rapport between them that had made me feel uncomfortable.&quot; She called their behavior &quot;flirtatious&quot; and added: &quot;Gaylardo&#x2019;s unprofessionalism has only encouraged it by allowing (the student) to come into our office on many occasions to just chat. I have witnessed them giggling and laughing together many times.&quot;</p>

<p>Gaylardo contends that she was put on a list of people not eligible to teach in city schools because of Memos&apos; accusations and &quot;simply on the frequency of communications without any finding of inappropriate contact or intent.&quot; </p>
