<p>Err...right. We were obviously wrong about the batmobile <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161438/http://twitter.com/#!/God_Damn_Batman/status/61509451936563200">going green</a> for Earth Day. Tipster <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161438/http://twitter.com/#!/Ewingweber">@Ewingweber</a> sent these photos <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161438/http://evgrieve.com/2011/04/batmobile-we-presume.html#EastVillage">to EV Grieve</a>, taken on East 10th Street just east of Second Avenue this morning. You can see more photos of the strange car, which depicts Batman standing on some wolves, there. Could this be a hint at the next <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161438/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/30/batman_destined_to_return_again_and.php">Batman redesign</a>? No, it cannot. It would make for a pretty cool <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161438/http://gothamist.com/tags/taxioftomorrow">Taxi of Tomorrow</a> design though. And Batman having his own wolfpack does sound like the high concept stuff of summer-movie-mashup millions, maybe ala one of those classic Abbott and Costello films.
