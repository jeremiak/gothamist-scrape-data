<p>As he has done every year since 1982, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170626013904/http://gothamist.com/tags/woodyallen">Woody Allen</a> has been working on a new movie; this one is slated to be released later in 2017. And after dipping his toes back into the Hudson River with last year&apos;s <em>Cafe Society</em>, it seems his latest film will bring Allen back to his hometown borough. </p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170626013904/http://www.woodyallenpages.com/2017/02/wonder-wheel-name-woody-allens-2017-film-justin-timberlake-kate-winslet/?utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=misclinks&amp;utm_source=article_body&amp;utm_content=intra">Woody Allen Pages</a>, the new movie is called <em>Wonder Wheel</em>, after the famous ferris wheel located in Coney Island. This marks the director&apos;s first return to the Boardwalk since 1977&apos;s <em>Annie Hall</em>. The Wonder Wheel happened to make a cameo in that movie as well.</p>

<p>The film, which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170626013904/http://www.woodyallenpages.com/2016/10/everything-know-woody-allens-2017-film-kate-winslet-justin-timberlake/">reportedly takes place</a> in the 1950s in and around the amusement park, stars Kate Winslet, Justin Timberlake, Juno Temple, Jim Belushi, and at least a few former <em>Sopranos</em> cast members (including Paulie!). There are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170626013904/http://www.woodyallenpages.com/2017/02/wonder-wheel-release-details-netherlands-france-australia/">already release dates</a> for France, Netherlands, Australia and more, but no definite release for America yet, although it&apos;s speculated it could come sometime in July 2017.</p>

<p>&quot;I feel the Wonder Wheel is not just a piece of old New York, it&#x2019;s New York itself,&quot; Steven Vourderis, who runs the Ferris wheel with his brother Dennis, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170626013904/http://www.brooklynpaper.com/stories/40/8/all-new-woody-allen-movie-named-wonder-wheel-2017-02-24-bk.html?utm_source=20170216&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=link&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter">told Brooklyn Paper</a>. &quot;It&#x2019;s a modern marvel and who better to highlight it and Coney Island than Woody Allen? It&#x2019;s terrific that he named it after the Wonder Wheel, it really is.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Woody Allen movies are always a big event and the fact that it&#x2019;s set here and named after the Wonder Wheel, I feel this will help further highlight the amusement park,&#x201D; added Dick Zigun, the so-called &apos;Mayor of Coney Island.&apos; &quot;And I know this means much to the continuing legend of Coney Island. It&#x2019;ll keep the lore alive.&quot;</p>

<p>Timberlake <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170626013904/http://variety.com/2016/music/features/justin-timberlake-trolls-cant-stop-the-feeling-woody-allen-pharrell-1201898888/">spoke to Variety</a> about the movie back in the fall: &quot;All day I&#x2019;m thinking about what Woody was going to say to me on set, like, &#x2018;Man, he&#x2019;s gonna annihilate me.&#x2019; I think we all have a level of anxiety. I have it. I&#x2019;ve had panic attacks.&quot;</p>
