No?  Then how about some seafood?  Many years ago, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504170231/http://gothamist.com/2005/08/13/watch_out_for_the_tailgate_courtesy_squad.php">tailgate fascists</a> made an unsuccessful bid to squash the spirits of tailgating men and women across the tri-state area with their Draconian rules. But today, an even greater <strike>trend</strike> enemy is threatening tailgaters: gourmet grillers.</p>

<p>A new <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504170231/http://weber.mediaroom.com/index.php?s=43&amp;item=149">Weber Tailgating Study</a> reveals that nearly fifty percent of tailgaters are no longer satisfied with the standard tailgating fare, such as burgers, hot dogs, chicken.

While basic tailgaters spend an average of $106 per tailgate, gourmet grillers spend $165 per tailgate.</p>
