<p>Actor Alec Baldwin is no stranger to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160708072034/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/29/alec_baldwin_2.php">unhappy</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160708072034/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/19/alec_baldwin_punches_photographer_c.php">run-ins</a> with the paparazzi&#x2014;and earlier on Sunday, he was involved in yet another such altercation. Baldwin told us he was assaulted by a NY Post photographer near his East Village apartment, and called the cops to file a formal complaint against him. But it seems the photographer is planning on accusing Baldwin of using a racial epithet against him. &quot;If you want to paint a picture of me that is a denigrating picture, I&apos;ve seen that,&quot; Baldwin told us. &quot;If you want to put words in my mouth...I&apos;ve certainly had my moments. But this is not one of them. I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever uttered a racial epithet to someone in my lifetime.&quot;</p>

<p>Baldwin said he was returning home from the gym when the altercation took place. &quot;This guy was right up in my face as I crossed University Place,&quot; he told us, saying the photographer&#x2014;who may have been following him due to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160708072034/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/17/grad_student_blames_alec_baldwins_w.php">recent lawsuit against his wife</a>&#x2014;was acting aggressively. &quot;I get to the other side of the street, and he bumped into me.&quot; He believes it was a very deliberate provocation: &quot;He banged into me with his shoulder, because he was right on top of me with the camera,&quot; he added. &quot;In my mind, it was deliberate. I&apos;ve had that happen before. It happens sometimes, because they want to bait you, they want you to do something.&quot;</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2013_01_alecpostracist.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160708072034im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/2013_01_alecpostracist.jpg" width="400" height="209" class="image-right"> </span>Baldwin noted some of his previous experiences with photographers from The Post and other local dailies, recalling one time around <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160708072034/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/01/photos_alec_baldwin_finally_ties_th.php#photo-1">his wedding last summer</a> to Hilaria Thomas when a photographer tripped and sat on a baby in a stroller while trying to get a photo of him. &quot;My wife is pregnant and I&apos;m trying to make sure she has as much peace as possible,&quot; he said. &quot;Who knows what these people can do.&quot;</p>

<p>So after he got home, Baldwin called the cops; two cop cars and four officers, who he said were nothing but kind and professional, responded and took his complaint. He also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160708072034/https://twitter.com/ABFalecbaldwin/status/303197871254167554">tweeted about the experience.</a> The photographer, who was still there at the time, claimed he was a former cop himself, and was able to provide valid ID to prove it. Considering that, Baldwin is perplexed by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160708072034/https://twitter.com/ABFalecbaldwin/status/303319247029956608">what happened later</a>: &quot;My publicist has informed me that the &quot;photographer&quot; from the Post is claiming I called him a racial epithet, prior to me contacting NYPD,&quot; he tweeted. </p>

<p>He further explained to us: &quot;When they were there, no one made any mention of anything. While police were here, you&apos;d figure that&apos;d be an opportune time for this guy to really attempt to tar me in some way. But there was no mention of anything I said to him, no one said anything about me saying the N-word or taunting him or anything. <strong>So it was after the fact. He wants to say I used some racial slur against him</strong>.&quot;</p>

<p>As he put it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160708072034/https://twitter.com/ABFalecbaldwin/status/303322478028148736">in a separate tweet</a>, &quot;Why did the photographer make no mention of this when the cops showed up? Cops make rather good witnesses.&quot; We&apos;ve contacted The Post for comment about the confrontation, but they have not responded as of publication. </p>

<p>Baldwin is clearly frustrated that these kinds of interactions keep happening, although he is not too concerned about people taking the photographer&apos;s accusations seriously: &quot;I don&apos;t think anyone who knows me would think that was possible.&quot; </p>

<p>He had strong words for the newspaper however: &quot;The Post will stop at nothing&#x2014;that&apos;s what The Post is. Their function is to denigrate people, humiliate people, reduce people, make excuses for people who are their political partisans. It&apos;s a highly biased, highly politicized group of people. However, I&apos;m stunned that they would resort to that.&quot; He concluded, <strong>&quot;Even for The Post, this is a new low.&quot;</strong></p>
