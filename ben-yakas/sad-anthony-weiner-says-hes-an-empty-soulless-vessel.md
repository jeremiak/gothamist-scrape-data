<p>The clock may be resting perilously at 14:59, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160902222958/http://gothamist.com/tags/anthonyweiner">Anthony Weiner</a> is still finding ways to stay in the public eye, whether it means <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160902222958/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/10/in_very_awkward_interview_with.php">submitting to interviews with Sean Hannity</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160902222958/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/23/weiner_finally_throws_inevitable_pl.php">throwing tantrums over little kid&apos;s pee.</a> GQ <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160902222958/http://www.gq.com/news-politics/newsmakers/201311/anthony-weiner-carlos-danger-new-york-mayor?mbid=gqpr">has the latest look</a> at the former candidate, and it may be the saddest peek into the Carlos Danger&apos;s psyche yet&#x2014;it&apos;s one in which he calls himself &quot;an empty, soulless vessel,&quot; arrogantly dismisses the reporter, and clings onto the notion that he was just not born at the right time to be mayor: &#x201C;And maybe if the Internet didn&#x2019;t exist? Like, if I was running in 1955? I&#x2019;d probably get elected mayor.&#x201D; </p>

<p>The piece, &quot;The Year of Living Carlos Dangerously,&quot; pointedly starts with reporter Marshall Sella offering Weiner his theory about sexting and the hypocrisy of the electorate: &quot;Weiner mulled over my generational theory, then called it &apos;overly simplistic,&apos; which is what people always say when they want to gain the intellectual high ground on a topic.&quot; Even after he&apos;s been ridiculed in public for his arrogance, even with the opportunity to put a final spin in one of the last post-mortem pieces on his failed campaign, Weiner can&apos;t help himself.</p>

<p>Weiner admits he rationalized the sexting (&quot;I thought, &#x2018;This person&#x2019;s my friend. Why would they turn on me?&#x2019;&quot;) and that he and wife Human Abedin have had &quot;a very rough time&quot; of it lately, but he clams up when asked if they&apos;re staying together: </p>

<blockquote>&#x201C;One thing I&#x2019;m grateful for is that now I&#x2019;m under no obligation to answer anything like this,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;But we&#x2019;ve had a very rough time. It causes me a great deal of pain in the way she gets reported and the way she gets discussed. Her treatment in the press has been rough. It pains me because I deserve it. She doesn&#x2019;t.

<p>&#x201C;I duck it as best I can,&#x201D; he added, &#x201C;but her reputation has become the Woman Who Married an Idiot and Stuck with Him. More of it rolls off my back, because that&#x2019;s the way I am constitutionally. She&#x2019;s more sensitive. I&#x2019;m just an empty, soulless vessel, so it doesn&#x2019;t hurt me as much.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Weiner delivered that last remark with an utter lack of humor.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>The whole piece is interesting, if also absolutely depressing. If you&apos;re looking for something to cheer you up after that, please read <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160902222958/http://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/men-of-the-year/home/winners-2013/icon-noel-gallagher">this delightful GQ interview with Noel Gallagher</a>, in which he finally tells off those pretentious people who like reading and writing books: &quot;The winner of the Pulitzer Prize [for fiction]. What a c***. Whoever that is, has got to be. I don&apos;t get it. Book sellers, book readers, book writers, book owners - f*** all of them.&quot;</p>
