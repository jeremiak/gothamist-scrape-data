<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170702224721/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/09/emma_watson_will_be_leaving_books_a.php">Back at the start of November</a>, Emma Watson snuck around the city hiding Maya Angelou&apos;s book <em>Mom and Me and Mom</em> inside various subway stations. It seemed like a very nice way to promote literacy! And it didn&apos;t include any references to <em>Harry Potter</em>, which is especially good because The Important People have decided <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170702224721/https://theoutline.com/post/1181/liberals-your-harry-potter-political-references-are-embarrassing">they hate that now</a>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the whole world has gone to shit since then: Donald Trump has been doing his best to jumpstart a new Nativist movement that would prevent a foreigner like Watson from even stepping inside a subway station (this is only a slight exaggeration). Watson&apos;s feminist credibility <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170702224721/http://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/news/a43494/emma-watsons-boobs-are-not-the-downfall-of-feminism/">has been undermined (or something)</a> because of a <em>Vanity Fair</em> cover. The Beyhive is angry because Watson <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170702224721/http://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/news/a43596/emma-watson-feminism-beyonce-fans/">said something three years ago</a> (I can&apos;t keep up!). And also along the way, Watson somehow found the time to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170702224721/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwakIBYEI0M">embrace bestiality</a>!? It all makes those days of blissfully hopping from station to station without seeing a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170702224721/http://gothamist.com/tags/swastika">swastika carved into a seat</a> seem like a very long time ago indeed. </p>

<p>Thankfully, we now get the chance to turn back time for a moment, as <em>Vanity Fair</em> has finally released video of Watson hiding the books. &quot;So read it please, then bring it back and leave it for someone else to find it, you pass on the good deed, pass on love,&quot; she says about her &apos;new library&apos; under the streets of New York.</p>

<p>In a separate video, Watson also gave out advice to strangers at Grand Central, via an iPad, for $2. It turns out she&apos;s very into being kind! My conclusion from all of this, as someone who has never seen a <em>Harry Potter</em> movie or anything she has ever been in (except for her cameo in <em>This Is The End</em>, which was pretty funny!), is that Emma Watson is a force for good in the world, and hopefully she will quote me on that and/or ask me to hide books with her next time she is in town. Kind people are <em>my</em> kinda people :) </p>
