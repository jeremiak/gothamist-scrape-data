<p>This week, homeless coder Leo Grand finally released <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428114546/http://gothamist.com/2013/12/10/leo_the_journeyman_coder_releases_f.php">his first app</a>, &quot;Trees For Cars,&quot; after more than three months of work on it. Grand, who learned how to code thanks to 23-year-old programmer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428114546/http://gothamist.com/tags/PatrickMcConlogue">Patrick McConlogue</a>, goes into detail about how it has changed his life in the video below: &quot;I can work at Google, I can work at SpaceX, I can build a server. This is going to change my life in a magnificent way.&quot;</p>

<p>Grand&apos;s story <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428114546/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/22/nyc_entrepreneur_promises_to_teach.php">blew up across the internet</a> after McConlogue, who passed Grand each day on his way to work, offered him a deal: he&apos;d give Grand $100 and be on his way, or he&apos;d teach Grand to code. Grand took him up on the offer, and despite <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428114546/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/14/code_homeless_arrested.php">a few hiccups</a>, was responsible for nearly every aspect of the app, from the concept and execution down to the name. The app encourages environmental awareness and creates a healthy competition amongst users to save the most CO2. </p>

<p>And as you can see above, Grand was excited about the launch: &quot;Negative comments or haters, i think they&apos;ll end up changing their minds once the app is completed.&quot; He was also asked about the most painful thing for him: &quot;That I&apos;m a bum and I&apos;m homeless. But it&apos;s not painful to me. I think what you mean to say is, what is the most hurtful thing someone can say to you. That would have to be, &apos;this person is dumb and not intelligent... and not good looking.&apos;&quot;</p>
