<p>Everyone&apos;s favorite Nazi-sympathizing Times Square costumed character has been sentenced to one year in jail for a failed plot to extort the Girl Scouts. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150310162350/http://gothamist.com/tags/antisemiticelmo">Anti-Semitic Elmo</a>&#x2014;a.k.a. Adam Sandler, who is really named Dan Sandler&#x2014;was arrested in June for trying to extort $2 million from the Girls Scouts by threatening crazy allegations, plus stalking and harassing a Girl Scouts employee. &#x201C;I accept the fact I committed a crime, but I&#x2019;m not in anyway sorry to the Girl Scouts organization,&#x201D; he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150310162350/http://nypost.com/2013/10/09/evil-elmo-gets-year-in-jail-for-girl-scouts-extort-plot/">told the court at sentencing.</a></p>

<p>Sandler had been employed by the Girls Scouts as a temp for a computer programming project from 2007-2008. After <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150310162350/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/18/anti-semitic_elmo_admits_he_tried_t.php">he was arrested in June 2012</a> for harassing people and going on rants about Jews, he started sending &quot;alarming&quot; and &quot;bizarre&quot; emails to a Girl Scouts supervisor (including nude photos). Among other things, he allegedly wrote, &quot;I will show up at Girl Scout functions and other places that parents and kids congregate and hold signs, connecting the Girl Scouts&#x2026; with the Cambodian Rape Camp man.&quot;</p>

<p>Sandler justified his actions with statements he made in court calling the group &#x201C;very corrupt&#x201D; for working with drug companies &#x201C;to promote off-label marketing of products.&#x201D;</p>

<p>&#x201C;This is not the case of someone in the back room of the office trying to embezzle money,&quot; he added. &#x201C;This is more of a protest, like laying down in an intersection.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Well, laying down in an intersection seems like an appropriate metaphor for a man who routinely shouted anti-Semitic curses at children. Since you won&apos;t get a chance to hear his public protests in person anytime soon, relive some of his greatest hits in the videos below.</p>
