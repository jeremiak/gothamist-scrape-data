<p>A woman was found hanging from a tree in Prospect Park early this morning. According to police, they received a 911 call about the incident around 6:45 a.m. Sunday morning. The body of the 27-year-old woman was found near the corner of West Drive and Prospect Park West, close to the park&apos;s picnic house.</p>

<p>A witness <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429063352/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/woman-found-hanging-tree-prospect-park-article-1.1805022">told the News</a> that her husband was in the park around 4:30 a.m. and &quot;heard a big crash&quot; sometime a little later. The woman&apos;s husband said that another person who was in the park at the time came running toward the picnic tables yelling, &quot;There&apos;s a body!&quot;</p>

<p>The NYPD says that no criminality is suspected, and the death is believed to be a suicide.</p>
