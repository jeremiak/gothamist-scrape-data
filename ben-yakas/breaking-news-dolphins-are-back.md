										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none" style=" width:634px; "> <img alt="8711dolphins.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031072027im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/8711dolphins.jpg" width="634" height="476"> <br> <i>One of the dolphins swimming in the East River <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031072027/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/05/d.php#photo-6">last year</a> (Bill Hannan of FDNY Marine Company 6)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>It&apos;s been over a year since the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031072027/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/05/d.php#photo-6">last report of</a> dolphins swimming in the polluted Newtown Creek and the East River. But just like Kenny Loggins, we&apos;ve been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031072027/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPSA3dZO13s">keeping the fire burning bright</a> waiting for their glorious return. And today seems to be our lucky day: we just received a report that a school of dolphins have been spotted off of City Island, and NYPD Harbor Unit are on the scene. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031072027/http://gothamist.com/2009/06/29/dolphins_visit_new_york_waters.php">Two years ago</a>, a pod of dolphins was spotted off the south end of City Island. So perhaps this is the dolphins&apos;s version of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031072027/http://gothamist.com/tags/fleetweek">Fleet Week</a>: swimming into our city once a year, catching a matinee of <em>Mamma Mia</em>, and delighting the living daylights out of us. If anyone is nearby, or has any pictures of the dolphins, send it to us at tips@gothamist.com or tag them as &quot;Gothamist&quot; on Flickr. </p>
