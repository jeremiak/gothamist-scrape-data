<p>The Bronx public school teacher whose past as a sex worker made her front page fodder announced her resignation <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412180024/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2011/01/21/2011-01-21_former_craigslist_hooker_and_mexican_stripper_melissa_petro_resigns_as_public_sc.html">yesterday</a>. In the fall, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412180024/http://gothamist.com/tags/melissapetro">Melissa Petro</a> was bounced from teaching art at Public School 70 in Mount Eden to the rubber room, after an essay she wrote on being a Craigslist prostitute led to her picture being plastered on the dallies. The Department of Education was reportedly embarrassed by the incident, and was seeking to fire her for &quot;conduct unbecoming&quot; her profession.</p>

<p>Petro was defiant in the face of the story. In December, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412180024/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/melissa-petro/writing-from-the-rubber-r_b_792093.html">she wrote</a> a piece for the Huffington Post in which she said, &quot;The DOE may be embarrassed by the New York Post, but I am not. I have no regrets and have done nothing I&apos;m ashamed of. I have worked hard to become the woman I am today&#x2014;a woman of dignity and grace, not to mention a competent teacher as well as an accomplished writer. I do not deserve to be shamed or punished or made to feel useless, and yet here I sit in &quot;reassignment.&quot;&quot; She gave <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412180024/http://gothamist.com/2010/12/07/hooker-turned-teacher_guess_what_te.php">more interviews</a>, including one with Marie Claire in which she spoke about spending her wastrel days in the rubber room penning a memoir on the public&apos;s dime: &quot;I&apos;m paid my full salary to sit in what amounts to detention.&quot; </p>

<p>In the end though, she must have decided it wasn&apos;t worth going through to an administrative trial; instead, she will remain on the payroll until the end of April, for the time she would have stayed employed had she insisted on a disciplinary hearing. In addition, according <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412180024/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/01/21/teacher-with-sex-worker-past-resigns/?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">to the Times</a>, she has agreed to never seek employment in the city public schools ever again.</p>
