<p>Staten Island Congressman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508155343/http://gothamist.com/tags/michaelgrimm">Michael Grimm</a> became national news this week after he threatened an NY1 reporter on camera after the State Of The Union speech. Jon Stewart was having none of that last night on The Daily Show, calling out Grimm for his bullying&#x2014;although he admits that &quot;&apos;I will throw you off this f-----g balcony&apos; is a relatively standard and traditional Staten Island goodbye.&quot;</p>

<p>But mostly, Stewart was upset that Grimm would go after a beloved NY1 reporter. &quot;You know what&apos;s almost more upsetting than knowing that Republicans from day one planned to sabotage the administration in every way that they knew how?&quot; Stewart asked. &quot;Or that the guy threatening to hurl a NY1 reporter off a balcony is not a thug in a <em>Batman</em> film, but someone we elected to Congress? Or that the public persona these folks display is so radically different from how they behave otherwise? It&apos;s that he went after a NY1 reporter...NY1 is the pulse of our city.&quot; After all, who else is going to literally <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508155343/http://www.patspapers.com/">read the newspaper to you in the morning</a>?</p>
