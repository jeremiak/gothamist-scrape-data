<p>Everyone loves <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160304073917/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/23/photos_sfs_much-loved_mission_chine.php#photo-1">Mission Chinese</a>, right? NY Times <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160304073917/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/26/dining/reviews/12-restaurant-triumphs-of-2012.html">reviewer Pete Wells</a> would snort rails of chawanmushi if chef Danny Bowien&apos;s laid it in front of him; he had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160304073917/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/25/dining/reviews/mission-chinese-food-nyc-restaurant-review.html?pagewanted=all">such an orgasmic time</a> at the Orchard Street location, he had to channel the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160304073917/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hammer_of_the_Gods_(book)">hammer of the gods</a> in his review. But there are some traditionalist dissenters, including Benjamin Cost, food editor of Gothamist sister site (okay, more like autonomous satellite in the far East) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160304073917/http://shanghaiist.com/">Shanghaiist</a>. He recently visited Mission Chinese in NYC to see what all the hype was about, and was bitterly disappointed by the &quot;astoundingly awful&quot; food.</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160304073917/http://shanghaiist.com/2013/04/11/mission_chinese_mission_failed.php">read the full takedown here</a>, but we have excerpted the highlights below:<br>
</p><ul>	<li>&quot;The rap music was raw, the decor wild, but the food was astoundingly awful, the worst I&apos;ve had since I gagged on that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160304073917/http://shanghaiist.com/2013/02/11/review_of_pizza_huts_shrimp_tempura.php">pizza with wasabi mayonnaise, shrimp tempura, and hot dogs</a> from Pizza Hut China.&quot;</li><br>
	<li>The Kung Pao Pastrami was &quot;not particularly hot, just senseless, the culinary equivalent of a baby banging on pots and pans.&quot;</li><br>
	<li>One recommended special Hainan Eggplant: &quot;It sounded about as absurd as &quot;Peking Kale&quot; (who says you gotta use a duck?) but I was willing to let the flavors speak for themselves. They did not. What I got were slimy, morgue-cold blocks of inedible eggplant.&quot;</li><br>
	<li>Behind the ironic hairstyle, tats, and &quot;bad boy&quot; image, you have to know how to cook. Then again, perhaps Daniel Bowien&apos;s success proves that you don&apos;t.</li></ul><p></p>
