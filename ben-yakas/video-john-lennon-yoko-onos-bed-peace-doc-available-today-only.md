<p>In 1969, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502151652/http://gothamist.com/tags/johnlennon">John Lennon</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502151652/http://gothamist.com/tags/yokoono">Yoko Ono</a> held two week-long Bed-Ins for Peace in Amsterdam and Montreal, as a non-violent way of protesting the Vietnam War and promoting peace. And what better way to spend a rainy Sunday afternoon than watching an exclusive 70-minute documentary about Lennon and Ono trying to sell peace like ad agencies sell soap!</p>

<p>Yoko Ono <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502151652/http://twitter.com/#!/yokoono/status/102573832119910400">has put up</a> the &quot;Bed Peace&quot; documentary of those hectic two weeks on YouTube for this weekend only&#x2014;keep in mind that it&apos;s only available till midnight tonight, so you better get watching. There&apos;s fantastic footage of the young couple in bed patiently doing interviews with various reporters and personalities, playing with Ono&apos;s daughter Kyoko, and recording &quot;Give Peace A Chance&quot; (with Timothy Leary, Tommy Smothers, Dick Gregory, Murray the K all singing along). Early in the documentary, there is also a delicate solo acoustic version of Beatles classic &quot;Because&quot; (at 1:37). </p>

<p>Below, check out Ono&apos;s letter to fans about the documentary:<br>
 <br>
</p><blockquote>Dear Friends,<p></p>

<p>In 1969, John and I were so na&#xEF;ve to think that doing the Bed-In would help change the world.<br>
Well, it might have. But at the time, we didn&apos;t know.</p>

<p>It was good that we filmed it, though.<br>
The film is powerful now.<br>
What we said then could have been said now.</p>

<p>In fact, there are things that we said then in the film, which may give some encouragement and inspiration to the activists of today. Good luck to us all.</p>

<p>Let&apos;s remember WAR IS OVER if we want it.<br>
It&apos;s up to us, and nobody else.<br>
John would have wanted to say that.</p>

<p>Love, yoko</p></blockquote><p></p>
