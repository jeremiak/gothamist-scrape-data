<p>There are only seven weeks left of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160314165234/http://gothamist.com/tags/breakingbad"><em>Breaking Bad</em></a>, so we&apos;ll take any excuse to pay homage to one of our favorite TV shows of all time. Do Or Dine owner and chef <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160314165234/http://gothamist.com/tags/justinwarner">Justin Warner</a> stumbled upon the above <em>Breaking Bad</em> crocheted artwork on the north side of the west entrance to the G train at Bedford and Nostrand today.</p>

<p>&quot;I didn&apos;t notice it yesterday. I tend to be pretty observant,&quot; he told us of the item, which he dubbed a &quot;crotchitti.&quot; He added that there was a tag on it for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160314165234/http://www.londonkaye.com/">Londonkaye</a> reading, &quot;to brighten your day.&quot; Of course, if it were truly in the spirit of the show, it would say something like, &quot;I&apos;m a blowfish, yeeeah blowfishing this up!&quot; or &quot;Crochet, bitch!&quot; </p>
