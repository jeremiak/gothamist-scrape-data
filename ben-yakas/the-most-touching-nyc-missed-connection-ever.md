										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="012914cover.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429220601im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_arts_john/012914cover.jpg" width="640" height="474"> <br> <i> (From Adrian Tomine&apos;s beloved 2011 New Yorker cover.)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>Usually, we only turn to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429220601/http://gothamist.com/tags/craigslist">Craigslist</a> when we are in desperate need of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429220601/http://gothamist.com/2013/12/13/what_will_you_do_with_12_tons_of_ro.php">12 tons of rock salt</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429220601/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/17/brooklyn_man_giving_away_his_giant.php">human-sized hamster wheels</a>. But whether it&apos;s the temperatures or the holidays or just general depression, this winter has felt long and blue already. Maybe that&apos;s why we were so touched <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429220601/http://newyork.craigslist.org/brk/mis/4301059953.html">by this Craigslist posting</a>, written by a man who briefly got married to a redheaded NYU student on a whim, lost track of her when he had to travel to Japan to care for his dying father, then saw her for the first time in 25 years on a packed L train last week.</p>

<p>Unlike some of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429220601/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/08/missed_connection.php">other &apos;poetic&apos; Craigslist missed connections</a> we&apos;ve seen, most of which rely on the purple prose of a college sophomore trying to channel Rumi, there&apos;s something understated about this one. Or maybe we just have a lot of empathy for people who have fallen in love with women who count The Replacements among their favorite bands.</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="creg2.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429220601im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/creg2.jpeg" width="640" height="218" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>This could always just be some dude looking for a taste of viral fame; this could be a made-up short story <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429220601/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/25/viral_videos_nyu.php">for some NYU class</a> on the internet. Maybe the woman was mortified to see the man she briefly married, or didn&apos;t even recognize him. But it&apos;s a good story right now, as is, and we wouldn&apos;t ask for anything more today.    </p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: The Craigslist post is now down, either because the poster was overwhelmed by the attention, or they reconnected and now want to rekindle their romance in private, or it was all a fake fantasy intended to remind us that everything uplifting on the Internet is the product of some hoax concocted in somebody&apos;s lonely basement. Everything considered, we very much hope it is not the latter.</p>
