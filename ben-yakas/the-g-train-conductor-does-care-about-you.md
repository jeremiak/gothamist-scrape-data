<p>We all know the G Train certainly has its fair share of service issues <em>every </em>weekend, and almost definitely <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412163805/http://gothamist.com/2010/10/12/service_alert_the_g_train_doesnt_ca.php">does not care</a> about you. But that doesn&apos;t mean that its conductors aren&apos;t trying to do their part to make your late night schlep home a bit more enjoyable. Which would explain this conductor&apos;s movie-commercial-voiceover <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412163805/http://gothamist.com/2010/02/07/audio_g_train_conductor_gives_perfo.php">vocal magic</a> that one straphanger caught on video at the Bergen street stop last night. We&apos;d take this over that abrasive robot lady any day.</p>
