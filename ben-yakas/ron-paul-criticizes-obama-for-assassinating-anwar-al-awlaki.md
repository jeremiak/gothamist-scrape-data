<p>Earlier today, the U.S.-born al Qaeda leader and terrorist recruiter Anwar al-Awlaki <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150622130422/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/30/american-born_al_qaeda_leader_anwar.php">was killed in Yemen</a> by a missile fired from an American drone aircraft. In the wake of the death of al-Awalki, the first time since the Sept. 11 attacks that an American citizen had been deliberately targeted and killed by American forces, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150622130422/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/2011/09/30/2011-09-30_ron_paul_gop_presidential_hopeful_blasts_president_obama_for_assassinating_anwar.html?r=news&amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+nydnrss%2Fnews+%28News%29&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader">Ron Paul is not happy</a>: &quot;If the American people accept this blindly and casually that we now have an accepted practice of the President assassinating people who he thinks are bad guys, I think it&apos;s sad.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150622130422/http://gothamist.com/tags/ronpaul">Paul</a> criticized President Obama for ordering the missile strike against al-Awlaki without a trial, adding &quot;I don&apos;t think it&apos;s a good way to deal with our problems.&quot; The Council on American Islamic Relations also had mixed feelings about the strike: &quot;While a voice of hate has been eliminated, we urge our nation&apos;s leaders to address the constitutional issues raised by the assassination of American citizens without due process of law.&quot; </p>

<p>On the other hand, Police Commissioner Ray Kelly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150622130422/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/international/born_al_qaeda_leader_anwar_al_awlaki_eN9PTqfDSnJkp62pGVOkbK">praised Obama</a> for his decisive move: &quot;The death of Anwar al-Awlaki is a welcome, signature event. Having transformed the regional al Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula into a terrorist organization with global reach, he targeted Americans like no other, and he was a powerful recruiter of terrorists in the United States.&quot; In addition, Rep. Peter King, the Chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, was practically giddy, saying it was a &quot;great success in our fight against Al Qaeda.&quot; </p>

<p>Kelly also said that NYC police are on alert to possible revenge attacks: &quot;We know al-Awlaki had followers in the United States including New York City, and for that reason we remain alert to the possibility that someone might want to avenge his death,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150622130422/http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/09/30/us-yemen-awlaki-newyork-idUSTRE78T46520110930">he told reporters</a> today. </p>
