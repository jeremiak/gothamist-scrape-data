<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170609175046/http://gothamist.com/2016/12/26/gothamist_end_of_year_favorites.php">funniest show on Broadway</a> in 2016 is coming to Netflix in 2017... I mean, it still technically takes place on Broadway where it was filmed, but now it&apos;ll be on Broadway <em>on Netflix</em>. <em>Oh, Hello On Broadway</em>, starring Nick Kroll and John Mulaney as infamous tuna lovers/prankers Gil Faizon and George St. Geegland, will be released on June 13th, so everyone who didn&apos;t get a chance to experience all the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170609175046/http://www.aquariumdrunkard.com/2017/06/07/john-mulaney-the-aquarium-drunkard-interview/#more-52863">Steely Dan jokes</a> in person can enjoy them from the comfort of their couches.</p>

<p>In case you&apos;re not familiar with the premise (and if you aren&apos;t, what&apos;s wrong with you?!), <em>Oh, Hello</em> began as a popular <em>Kroll Show</em> sketch before taking on a life of its own with the show. In it, Geegland, a failed screenwriter, and Faizon, a failed actor, put on an autobiographical play about getting kicked out of their rent-controlled apartment, complete with one-sided phone calls, SECRETS, raccoon heartbreakers, and their famed talk/prank show, &quot;Too Much Tuna.&quot; There&apos;s improv, surprise celebrity guests, and as Rebecca Fishbein <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170609175046/http://gothamist.com/2016/12/26/gothamist_end_of_year_favorites.php">put it</a> last year, &quot;by the time Geegland and Faizon collapse after a frantically-choreographed ballet number, you too will want to fall down on the floor, heaving with laughter and craving a tuna fish sandwich.&quot;</p>

<p>If you want a very brief sampling of what the aforementioned improv/celebrity guest portion of the show is like, check out two interviews between the hosts and Faizon and Geegland&apos;s hero, Alan Alda.</p>

<p>Mulaney and Kroll will celebrate the release by appearing at the 92Y in character next Tuesday for an evening of conversation moderated by John Oliver. Tickets are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170609175046/https://www.92y.org/event/oh-hello-again?timeout=true">still available here</a> (though be warned, they are pretty pricey). But if you can&apos;t go, you can always watch their 2015 appearance there.</p>
