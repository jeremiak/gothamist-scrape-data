										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="2011_06_anthonyhuma.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170316193855im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/2011_06_anthonyhuma.jpg" width="640" height="466"> <br> <i> The couple in 2011 (AP)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>The first <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170316193855/http://gothamist.com/tags/anthonyweiner">Anthony Weiner</a> sexting scandal (<em>Weinergate</em>) in 2011 was a supreme political tragi-comedy; the sequel (<em>Return Of Carlos Danger</em>) leaned wholly toward the comedically absurd; but the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170316193855/http://gothamist.com/2016/08/29/anthony_weiner_sexting_saga.php">finale to the trilogy</a>, in which Weiner allegedly sexted a Trump-loving Republican while in bed with his son, is just depressing and disappointing, like so many third movies in trilogies (see: <em>The Dark Knight Rises</em>, <em>Godfather III</em>, <em>Spider-Man 3</em>, <em>X-Men: The Last Stand</em>, <em>Superman: Richard Pryor Edition</em>). And now his wife, top Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin, is finally kicking him to the curb.</p>

<p>&quot;After long and painful consideration and work on my marriage, I have made the decision to separate from my husband,&quot; she said in a statement this morning. &quot;Anthony and I remain devoted to doing what is best for our son, who is the light of our life. During this difficult time, I ask for respect for our privacy.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170316193855/http://nypost.com/2016/08/28/anthony-weiner-sexted-busty-brunette-while-his-son-was-in-bed-with-him/">The NY Post broke</a> the scandal on the front page today after obtaining images from the woman, a &quot;40-something divorcee ... [who] is his polar opposite politically: a self-avowed supporter of Donald Trump and the National Rifle Association who&#x2019;s used Twitter to bash both President Obama and Clinton.&quot; The woman told the Post they had been sexting via Twitter from January of 2015 up until this month. </p>

<p>At one point, he sent her a image of him in bed with his son: &quot;The cringe-inducing image, which shows a bulge in his white, Jockey-brand boxer briefs and his son cuddled up to his left, wrapped in a light-green blanket.&quot; Weiner, who acknowledged that he knew the woman and they have been friends for some time, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170316193855/http://nypost.com/2016/08/29/anthony-weiner-deletes-twitter-amid-new-sexting-scandal/">deleted his Twitter account</a> after the latest scandal broke. The Daily News also announced they will <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170316193855/http://www.thedailybeast.com/cheats/2016/08/29/anthony-weiner-out-at-daily-news.html?via=desktop&amp;source=copyurl">no longer run columns</a> by him.</p>

<p>When the first sexting story broke in 2011, Abedin <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170316193855/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/08/weiners_wife_blindsided_by_his_sext.php">was reportedly &quot;blindsided&quot;</a> by Weiner&apos;s admissions about his texting proclivities, but decided to stay with him through the scandal and work on their marriage (she was also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170316193855/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/08/anthony_weiners_wife_huma_abedin_is.php">pregnant at the time</a> with their son).</p>

<p>When Weiner made his first comeback attempt to run for mayor in 2013, she appeared <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170316193855/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/22/anthony_weiner_announces_mayoral_ru.php#photo-4">in his campaign video</a>, sitting next to him as he admitted, &quot;Look, I made some big mistakes and I know I let a lot of people down. But I&#x2019;ve also learned some tough lessons. I hope I get a second chance to work for you.&quot; That comeback, of course, was derailed by the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170316193855/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/23/unsubstantiated_allegations_of_wein.php">Carlos Danger sexting saga.</a></p>

<p>In <em>Weiner</em>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170316193855/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/25/weiner_trailer.php">the recently-released documentary</a> about that 2013 comeback attempt, it showed that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170316193855/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AFlOAGnRCY">Abedin had been very actively involved</a> with her husband&apos;s campaign. There were even scenes of her dealing with the fallout of the second scandal in real time. As the description of the scene below reads: &quot;How does she react after finding out her significant other had been sexting behind her back with 22 yr. olds? She asks &apos;What&apos;s your press statement going to be?&apos; with zero emotion.&quot;</p>

<p>Last summer, Trump used Weiner as a punchline for his barbs against Hillary Clinton and Abedin.</p>

<p>And just a few weeks ago, while talking to the NY Times Magazine, Weiner was cagey in responding to a question about his past scandals. And we&apos;re talking about someone who not-so-long-ago <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170316193855/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/17/sad_anthony_weiner_admits_hes_an_em.php">got deep with the Times</a> about his flaws, calling himself &quot;an empty, soulless vessel.&quot; </p>
