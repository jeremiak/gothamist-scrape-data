										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:260px; "> <img alt="71611cat.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507003302im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/71611cat.jpg" width="260" height="231"> <br> <i>Not Eddie, but an equally...curvy cat</i></div> Well, we have now confirmed that hawks cannot really carry 15-pound cats: this week, a hawk swooped down and snatched a chubby white kitty on the Upper West Side, leaving his owner frantically scrambling to find him...only to discover that the hawk had almost immediately dropped the cat a few doors down the block.<p></p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507003302/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2011/07/16/2011-07-16_fat_cat_eddie_gets_snatched_up_by_hawk_but_dropped_in_neighbors_garden_due_to_we.html">News spoke to the unnamed owner</a> of Eddie, the plump cat who was targeted by a red-tailed hawk earlier this week. The owner became aware of the abduction when she heard the &quot;raspy kreeing of a red-tailed hawk capturing its prey&quot; mixed with the cat&apos;s sad mews, and found evidence of the attack. The owner looked all over the neighborhood, and started putting up fliers, which gained their own attention <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507003302/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/07/09/hawk-vs-cat/">by the Times</a> for their blunt wording: <strong>&#x201C;The sign said something like, &#x2018;If you find the cat&#x2019;s body, please give us a call&#x2019;...I thought it was very odd, but it&#x2019;s New York,</strong>&#x201D; said Cathy Konciak.</p>

<p>But after seeing the fliers, a neighbor recognized Eddie, and let the owner know the hawk had dropped him in the garden of a building a few doors down, barely 50 feet away. Eddie, who was no worse for wear, must have fallen at least five floors: &quot;I can only imagine Eddie bounced off the umbrella like in the cartoons,&quot; the owner said. She summed up the situation succinctly: <strong>&quot;The moral of the story is essentially: Your flaws can be an asset. In Eddie&apos;s case, his chubbiness saved him.&quot;</strong> And now, we shall spend the rest of the day <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507003302/http://www.neatorama.com/2006/05/08/top-15-amazingly-ginormous-fat-cats/">looking up</a> photos of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507003302/http://fatcatlover.blogspot.com/">curvy cats.</a></p>
