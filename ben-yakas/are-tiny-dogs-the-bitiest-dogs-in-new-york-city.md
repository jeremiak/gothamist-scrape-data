title: Are Tiny Dogs The Bitiest Dogs in New York City?

<p>With the snow slowly melting into the crevices of the sidewalks, people are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150608084849/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/17/melting_snow_reveals_sidewalks_fill.php">rather upset</a> at all the dog poop they now find themselves trudging through. But we&apos;re much more concerned with being bitten by a dog: there were 3,609 bites recorded in the city last year, the highest annual number of dog bites on record <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150608084849/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/li_yippers_big_nippers_EsuEAx5j7TkzZArVFttI0J?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">according to</a> the Health Department. And some of the most vicious bitches based on that data? Teeny-weeny Chihuahuas and Shih Tzus.</p>

<p>Altogether, the DOH told us that reported dog bites in NYC have declined greatly over the past decade, from a high of 5,519 in 2000. Unsurprisingly, pit bulls were the city&apos;s most bitey dog last year, with 815 nibbles, accounting for nearly a quarter of all bites. Rottweilers were next, but they were followed by tiny nippers Shih Tzus (who had only five less bites than the Rottweilers), Chihuahuas and standard poodles. Dr. E&apos;Lise Christensen, an animal behaviorist at NYC Veterinary Specialists, thinks it has to do with the handbag-domain that small dogs are often forced into: &quot;<strong>Small dogs may frequently be put in situations that are more provocative than, say, a Labrador is exposed to. For example, most people don&apos;t take their Labradors to Bloomingdale&apos;s</strong>.&quot; She calls it the &quot;poor little rich dog&quot; effect, or as we think of it, the Paris Hilton-effect.</p>

<p>Dog bites have been the cause of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150608084849/http://gothamist.com/2010/12/21/dog_bites_man_man_sues_bar.php">many</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150608084849/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/28/dog_bite_victims_get_their_own_lawy.php">lawsuits</a>, have forced Martha Stewart to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150608084849/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/14/not_a_good_thing_dog_bites_martha_s.php">get stitches</a>, and have even <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150608084849/http://gothamist.com/2010/12/06/plane_diverted_after_dog_bites_two.php">diverted airplanes</a>. We&apos;re just surprised more people haven&apos;t <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150608084849/http://gothamist.com/2010/10/08/breaking_news_man_actually_bites_do.php">bitten back</a> at them.</p>

<p>Anthony Jerone, who runs a dog-training school in Queens, thinks that part of the reason the tiny dogs are unusually aggressive is that they don&apos;t have any concept of sizes: &quot;Dogs don&apos;t know how big they are. Whether they are a 5-pound Chihuahua or a 100-pound Lab, they act out of instinct.&quot; As much as we love hanging out with dogs, all this biting talk makes us appreciate our cats even more. And you certainly can&apos;t play bowling laser cat with a dog:</p>
