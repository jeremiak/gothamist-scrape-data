<p>We&apos;ve already learned so much about the fascinating slang of state-mashing, wall-building, America First, Breitbart aficionados&apos; subculture, you&apos;d think there was nothing else left to learn. But <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170925130511/http://gothamist.com/tags/samanthabee">Samantha Bee</a> took a deep dive into the Deep State, one of the far-left and far-right&apos;s favorite conspiracy fever dreams, to try to figure out just what sort of misinformation is being drilled into our president&apos;s gullible eye holes via cable news networks.</p>

<p>&quot;[Sean Spicer] wants you to believe that these rogue deep-state infiltrators are poison-blooded Mole People and not just bland paper pushers who locked into government jobs with benefits,&quot; Bee said. Instead, Bee suggested we all think about federal employees as terrified passengers on a bus that&#x2019;s &quot;now being driven by a feral paranoid monkey.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;They&#x2019;re not trying to kick him out of the drivers seat,&quot; she continued. &quot;They know we chose the monkey to be the bus driver because Hillary used email, and is a woman&#x2014;and they respect that. They&#x2019;re just trying to turn the wheel slightly while the monkey is masturbating, so we don&#x2019;t run over a cliff. And, frankly, even the monkey should be in favor of that.&quot;</p>

<p>Bee also checked in to see how Democrats are handling life after that &quot;mild setback&quot; in November. She found that the &quot;Resistance&quot; has been doing a lot more than just resisting Trump&#x2014;they&apos;ve also resisted showing up to vote in major elections. She was particularly horrified that just less than 12 percent of voters turned out for the LA mayoral race: &quot;That&apos;s less than the percentage of Los Angeles that turned out to audition for the <em>Mr. Belvedere</em> reboot,&quot; she said. &quot;Were you too busy periscoping your avocado toast from the set of your web series to ensure that [Eric Garcetti] didn&apos;t wind up in charge of your city?&quot;</p>

<p>She also focused on Steve King for her recurring segment, &quot;What Does A White Dude Have To Say To Get Fired.&quot;</p>

<p>And if you&apos;re craving more Bee, she announced she&apos;s hosting a &quot;Not the White House Correspondents&#x2019; Dinner&#x201D; event several hours before the annual black-tie gala. As reported <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170925130511/http://thehill.com/blogs/in-the-know/in-the-know/324140-samantha-bee-to-hold-anti-trump-event-hours-before">by The Hill</a>, the invitation states the event will feature &quot;bottomless cocktails and assloads of fancy fingerfoods,&#x201D; followed by a taping of <em>Full Frontal.</em></p>

<p>Also, Time Out New York has a cover story on Bee declaring her &quot;Woman of the Year.&quot; Why they&apos;re giving out year-end awards in March, we&apos;ll never know. </p>
