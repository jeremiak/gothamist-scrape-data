<p>Police have released a photo of the hit-and-run driver <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502121814/http://gothamist.com/2014/05/10/27-yr-old_in_critical_condition_aft.php">suspected of fatally running over</a> a 27-year-old auto mechanic in Gowanus earlier this month. Victim Felipe Castro was repairing a Ford Expedition parked halfway on the sidewalk in front of Samba Transmission &amp; Auto Repair (where he worked) on Third Avenue near 7th Street around 7:30 a.m. on May 10th <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502121814/http://gothamist.com/2014/05/11/auto_mechanic_dies_after_being_stru.php">when he was struck</a> by a driver in a black Nissan. That driver has now been identified by police as 35-year-old Miguel Morales.</p>

<p>A witness who was also driving in the neighborhood at the time said that he didn&apos;t believe Morales saw Castro. &quot;This guy behind me [in the Nissan] kept beeping at me,&#x201D; Kero <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502121814/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/man-clings-life-hit-and-run-accident-article-1.1787255">told the News</a>. &quot;The guy shifted over to the bike lane. He had to be doing 40 to 45 MPH for sure.&quot; He said that Morales sideswiped the bumper of the car Castro was working on, and then hit Castro: &quot;He hit the guy and the guy went flying and slammed into a parked car head-first.&quot;</p>

<p>Morales then fled the scene, but not before Kero was able to get his license plate number. Cops describe Morales as 5&apos;7&quot; tall and weighs 225 pounds, and say he was driving a 2013 Nissan Altima. <br>
 <br>
