<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150511170720/http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505263_162-57584771/boston-bombings-suspect-dzhokhar-tsarnaev-left-note-in-boat-he-hid-in-sources-say/">CBS reports that</a> when Boston marathon bombing suspect <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150511170720/http://gothamist.com/tags/bostonmarathon">Dzhokhar Tsarnaev</a> was hiding out in a boat in Watertown before his capture last month, he left a note that doubled as a confession. &quot;When you attack one Muslim, you attack all Muslims,&quot; Tsarnaev reportedly wrote. Sources say the note reads as part manifesto, part suicide note, and part justification for the killing of innocent people&#x2014;but we&apos;re sure <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150511170720/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/12/dumb_teenagers_support_alleged_bost.php">some lovestruck teenagers</a> will still find this very romantic indeed.</p>

<p>The note was found scrawled with a marker on the interior wall of the cabin of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150511170720/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/20/after_exchanging_gunfire_boston_bom.php#photo-1">Watertown resident David Henneberry&apos;s beloved vessel</a>. Sources added that the bombings were retribution for U.S. military action in Afghanistan and Iraq, and called the Boston victims &quot;collateral damage&quot; in the same way Muslims have been killed during the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. He also said he didn&apos;t mourn for his older brother Tamerlan, who was killed during a chaotic shootout with police, because he was already a martyr in paradise and he expected to join him there. </p>

<p>The note is expected to be used during Tsarnaev&apos;s trial; CBS says it paints a clear picture of the brothers&apos; motive, &quot;consistent with what he told investigators while he was in custody.&quot; It also seems to refute theories that the younger brother had been pressured into the plan by his older brother.</p>
