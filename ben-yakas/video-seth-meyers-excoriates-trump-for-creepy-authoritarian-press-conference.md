<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170115142451/http://gothamist.com/tags/sethmeyers">Seth Meyers</a> may have found the humor in Trump&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170115142451/http://gothamist.com/2017/01/12/videos_the_best_late_night_comedian.php">Pissghazi crisis</a>, but he was much more concerned about the way Trump handled his first press conference as President-elect this week. &quot;Trump&apos;s hostility toward the press is the kind of thing you usually see in authoritarian regimes,&quot; Meyers said. &quot;In fact, in an especially creepy move, Trump stocked the press conference with employees who laughed at his jokes and shouted out supportive answers to his rhetorical questions.&quot; (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170115142451/http://gothamist.com/2017/01/12/trump_press_conference.php">While also turning away some reporters</a>, because there was, supposedly, &quot;at capacity.&quot;)</p>

<p>This wasn&apos;t the only aspect that Meyers found creepy: there was also his &quot;plan&quot; to resolve his conflicts of interest via a massive pile of blank documents (&quot;Even if you were doing a middle school play, you&apos;d write something on the folders to make it look real!&quot;) reporters were not even allowed to look through. &quot;The reason why this is so troubling is because having a president with such a massive and opaque business empire is an open invitation to unconstitutional bribes or other types of financial coercion,&quot; he added. But hey, at least &quot;You are fake news&quot; might make it into the lexicon as a sassy comeback or the new &quot;Bye, Felicia.&quot;</p>

<p>After one clip regarding the Trump dossier, Meyers noted, &quot;That&apos;s the President-elect joking about how he couldn&apos;t have been in a room where Russian prostitutes were urinating on each other because he&apos;s a germaphobe, just for a &apos;where we&apos;re at as a nation,&apos;&quot; he said. &quot;Also, and I know it&apos;s a waste of time to keep pointing this stuff out, but in a 2015 Hollywood Reporter article, Trump said, &apos;I&apos;m not germaphobic.&apos; But whatever, up is down, black is white, we should just all admit we&apos;re living in the Upside Down with Barb.&quot;</p>
