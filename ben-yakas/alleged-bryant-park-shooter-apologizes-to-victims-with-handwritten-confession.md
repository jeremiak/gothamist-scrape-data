<p>Last month, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150626154728/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/10/cops_questioning_16-year-old_suspec.php">a 16-year-old</a> was hit with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150626154728/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/11/bryant_park_shooting_suspect_wanted.php#photo-1">two counts of attempted murder and other charges</a> for opening fire on ice skaters at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150626154728/http://gothamist.com/tags/bryantpark">Bryant Park</a>. Now suspect Corey Dunton has apologized to both of his victims, one of whom may never walk again, in a handwritten three-page confession, which you can read in full below. &#x201C;I never thought I see this day where my life is shattered and I have shattered a young boy&#x2019;s life as well,&#x201D; he wrote. &#x201C;Some or most people might hate me for what I have done. I hate myself as well.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Dunton, who has six prior arrests, allegedly tried to mug 20-year-old Javier Contreras and take his pricey Marmot coat at the ice skating rink on November 9th; innocent bystander, Adonis Mera, 14, was also shot in the back, and he may never be able to walk again. &#x201C;The prospects don&#x2019;t seem very optimistic but there is always hope,&#x201D; said Manhattan Assistant District Attorney James Lin of Mera, who is still hospitalized. &#x201C;He has no movement below his waist.&#x201D;</p>

<p>&#x201C;I am sorry. I apologize to Adonis and his family for being [reckless] and ending [any] dreams or hopes Adonis had in life because in my life I&apos;ve been careless and blame everyone else for mistakes,&#x201D; Dunton wrote in the note, in which he accepted full responsibility for the shooting. &#x201C;I wish I could take it all back turn back time don&#x2019;t we all...I just hope those two boys recover.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Dunton also allegedly repeatedly told cops, &#x201C;I&#x2019;m going down for this, I f&#x2014;ked up,&#x201D; after being arrested for the shooting. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150626154728/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20131203/midtown/teen-says-goodbye-sick-mom-after-admitting-ice-rink-shooting-court-docs">According to DNAInfo</a>, Dunton was overheard talking to his mother while in custody: &quot;Ma, it&apos;s over. Promise me you&apos;ll take care of yourself, promise me.&quot;</p>

<p>Adonis&apos;s mother <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150626154728/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/suspect-bryant-park-ice-skating-shooting-indicted-article-1.1536121">was unmoved</a> after part of the note was read in court this week: &#x201C;I finally got to see the animal who shot my son,&#x201D; Arislenis Martinez, 44, said. &#x201C;I wanted to rip his head off...a lot of thoughts went through my mind. I wish I could say them out loud.&#x201D;</p>
