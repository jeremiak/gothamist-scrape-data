<p>As anyone who has seen the Pauly Shore documentary <em>Jury Duty</em> knows, our legal system can sure be a strange beast. Sometimes <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150103065846/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/18/man_drops_dead_during_jury_duty.php">people die</a> to get out of jury duty, sometimes they <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150103065846/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/06/judge_sentences_racist_juror_to_ind.php">fake being racist</a>, and sometimes sometimes very good dogs are called in to serve their country. That&apos;s what happened to German Shepherd IV Griner, who was recently summoned by the Cumberland County Clerk of Courts. &quot;I got the mail and I look at it, and I&#x2019;m like IV Griner, this is my dog&#x2019;s name,&quot; said the dog&apos;s owner, Barrett Griner.</p>

<p>&quot;I&#x2019;m wondering like, What is this? Something from the county office about her vaccinations or something? Like, why is my dog getting mail?&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150103065846/http://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/weird/Dog-Chosen-for-Jury-Duty-255184841.html">Griner told NBC.</a> As for how the mix-up occurred, it&apos;s all because of the IV: Griner&apos;s full name is Barrett Griner IV. He named his female dog IV (as in Ivy) as a &quot;play on words.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;This happens many times,&quot; explained Cumberland County Judiciary Coordinator Dennis Moffa, who said all jury summonses are computer-generated. &quot;As an example, if you had John Henry IV, sometimes the notice might just say Henry IV. I think that the computer probably randomly picks some things that are probably not as on point as they should be.&quot; Griner says he&apos;s previously received jury summonses that included his full name, so he still isn&apos;t sure whether he was called this time or not.</p>

<p>&quot;She [the dog] might be good for a cat burglar case or something like that,&quot; Griner added. &quot;The whole thing was just really, really funny.&quot; And now we&apos;ll spend the rest of today picturing what an all-dog jury might look like. Probably something like this:</p>
