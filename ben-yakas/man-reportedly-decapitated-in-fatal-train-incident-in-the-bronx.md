<p>A man was fatally struck by a train in The Bronx this morning. According to police, the incident happened just before 11 a.m. at the elevated Mount Eden subway station at Jerome Avenue and East Mount Eden Avenue. The unidentified man was struck by a southbound 4 train as the train pulled into the station. Police believe he jumped in its path; the MTA adds that the person appears to have been decapitated.</p>

<p>There&apos;s no service between Burnside Avenue and 149th Street in both directions while the investigation continues. One person who was on the train at the time tweeted about what she saw: </p>
