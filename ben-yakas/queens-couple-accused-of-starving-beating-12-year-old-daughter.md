<p>A Queens couple <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141022183450/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Child-Starve-Beat-Queens-Girl-Ranot-ACS-Hospital-Surgery-Girl-Tendon-Ozone-Park-Arrest-Police-270025041.html">has been arrested</a> for allegedly starving and beating their 12-year-old daughter over the last two years. The victim, Maya Ranot, weighed just 58 pounds when police found her in May; she was lying in a pool of blood from a gash caused when her stepmother, 31-year-old Sheetal Ranot, allegedly slashed her with the end of a broken metal broom handle. It was an injury that was deep enough to reveal the bone on her wrist.</p>

<p>Maya was taken into protective services, and recovered enough to describe to police years of torture and neglect at the hands of her stepmother and biological father, 46-year-old taxi driver Rajesh Ranot. Among other things, they are accused of repeatedly hitting her with everything from baseball bats to wooden rolling pins; they allegedly locked her in her bedroom and starved her for &quot;extended period of times;&quot; Rajesh also was charged with repeatedly forcing his daughter to take cold showers while he beat her with his hands and other objects.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141022183450/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2014/08/05/ozone-park-couple-accused-of-beating-starving-12-year-old-girl/">Officials said</a> Maya feared coming forward about the horrid abuse because she was worried her four step-siblings would be separated and sent away. &quot;Despite the bruising and scarring on her body which served as a silent testament to the violence and cruelty she purportedly endured, it is alleged that for a long time this emaciated child was fearful of disclosing the true nature of her injuries or those responsible for her suffering for fear that her younger step-siblings would be taken away by authorities and placed in foster care,&quot; Queens District Attorney Richard Brown said in a statement. &quot;Fortunately, she found the courage to speak up.&quot;</p>

<p>Rajesh has been charged with second- and third-degree assault, first-degree unlawful imprisonment and endangering the welfare of a child; he faces up to seven years in prison. Sheetal has been charged with first- and second-degree assault and endangering the welfare of a child, and could face up to 25 years in prison.</p>

<p>Neighbors had nothing but bad things to say about the couple: &quot;He was the kind of guy who would be your friend and smack you at the same time,&quot; a 51-year-old neighbor named Trinny <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141022183450/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/queens-parents-jailed-unspeakable-child-abuse-da-article-1.1892446">told the News</a>. &#x201C;You could not trust him.&#x201D; One of Rajesh Ranot&#x2019;s former in-laws also told them, &quot;It&#x2019;s about time they locked him up. Everyone is afraid of him...How could he do this to his own daughter?&quot;</p>

<p>Monir Uddin, a clerk who has worked for years at a Queens deli Rajesh once owned, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141022183450/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/06/nyregion/queens-couple-are-charged-in-severe-abuse-of-daughter.html?_r=0">summed it up to the Times</a>: &quot;These are not decent people.&quot;</p>
