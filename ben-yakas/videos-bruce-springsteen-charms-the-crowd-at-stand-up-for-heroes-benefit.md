And when he came out, he explained why the event was so special to him: &quot;What I do is I imagine America for a living, and I put it into a song, and it was something that gave my life enormous purpose&#x2014;and still does&#x2014;and meaning. And it&apos;s not something I could do truly or freely without the sacrifice or service of the men and women sitting in front of me.&quot;</p>

<p>Highlights included a gorgeous duet with wife Patti Scialfa on <em>Tunnel Of Love</em> classic &quot;Tougher Than The Rest&quot; (which you can see above), a very fun acoustic take on &quot;Working On The Highway,&quot; along with acoustic versions of &quot;We Take Care Of Our Own&quot; and &quot;Land Of Hope And Dreams.&quot; Surrounded by comedians such as Jon Stewart, Rickey Gervais, Mike Birbiglia, Robin Williams and Patton Oswalt, Springsteen couldn&apos;t help but tell <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131108231947/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWLpIAC8RuI&amp;feature=plcp">his own golf joke.</a> </p>

<p>In other Springsteen news, we were quite disappointed he didn&apos;t play &quot;4th of July, Asbury Park (Sandy)&quot; during the Hurricane Sandy benefit concert on NBC the other week&#x2014;but it turns out he did play the song last week at Penn State. Watch below!</p>
