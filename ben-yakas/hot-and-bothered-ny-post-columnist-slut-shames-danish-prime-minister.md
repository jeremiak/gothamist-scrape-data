<p>The <strike>world</strike> conservative media <strike>was outraged</strike> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160419220706/http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/12/11/obama-creates-international-incident-with-selfie-at-mandela-service/">feigned outrage </a> after President Obama was caught <strike>taking a selfie</strike> having his photo taken at Nelson Mandela&apos;s <strike>somber funeral</strike> exuberant memorial service. Oh sure, it was a four hour long arena memorial filled with colorful dancing and singing, and the photographer who took photos of the infamous selfie said people <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160419220706/http://news.yahoo.com/obama-funeral-selfie-152731325.html">were blowing it way out of proportion</a>, but no matter. The manufactured condemnation merry-go-round is in full swing, and it&apos;s all worth it, because the centrifugal force has given the world another colorful projectile vomit from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160419220706/http://nypost.com/2013/12/12/obamas-flirt-with-danish-prime-minister-is-a-disgrace/">the NY Post&apos;s resident catlady Andrea Peyser</a>. She thinks Obama needs to apologize to the American people for so clearly flirting with that Danish tramp.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160419220706/http://gothamist.com/tags/andreapeyser">Peyser</a> deconstructs the photos of Obama from the memorial like one of those drones from AMC&apos;s dearly departed <em>Rubicon</em>, and uses Sherlock-like leaps in judgement to psychoanalyze Obama&apos;s relationship with his wife and Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt. Let us count all the ways Peyser slut-shames and unnecessarily harasses Thorning-Schmidt for her part in causing Obama to lose &quot;his morality, his dignity and his mind:&quot; </p>

<ul>
	<li>&quot;Danish Pastry&quot;</li>
	<li>&quot;Denmark&#x2019;s voluptuously curvy and married prime minister&quot;</li>
	<li>&quot;Not to be outdone by the president&#x2019;s bad behavior, the Danish hellcat hiked up her skirt to expose long Scandinavian legs covered by nothing more substantial than sheer black stockings.&quot;</li>
	<li>&quot;cross-legged Danish cupcake, who is known in Copenhagen as a fan of America&#x2019;s randy TV show &#x201C;Sex and the City.&#x2019;&#x2019;&quot;</li>
	<li>&quot;Thorning-Schmidt placed her hands dangerously close to Obama&#x2019;s side. The president&#x2019;s cackling head moved inches from the Danish tart&#x2019;s and yards away from his wife&#x2019;s.&quot;</li>
	<li>&quot;a blonde bimbo who hadn&#x2019;t the sense to cover up and keep it clean.&quot;</li>
	<li>&quot;the Danish hottie&quot;</li>
	<li>&quot;the gentle gams of the Danish object of his desire.&quot;</li>
	<li>&quot;Thorning-Schmidt saw nothing wrong with the public display of middle-aged lust.&quot;</li>
<li>It was the memorial equivalent of a bodice-ripper.</li>
</ul>

<p>Did you know that the NY Post is a newspaper that gets printed every day and distributed throughout America&apos;s capital of media and culture?</p>

<p>To be sure, the Post isn&apos;t the only upstanding rag in the world that is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160419220706/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2522249/Kinnocks-son-gay-rumours-flirty-blonde-PM.html">getting in on the action</a> with Thorning-Schmidt, but they are by far <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160419220706/http://nypost.com/2013/12/10/michelle-annoyed-by-obamas-selfie-at-mandela-memorial/">the stupidest.</a> And Peyser&#x2014;who has never met a woman she couldn&apos;t <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160419220706/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/15/andrea_peyser_if_you_watch_reality.php">slut-shame</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160419220706/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/08/sharpton_calls_cain_a_hypocrite_pey.php">in public</a> by channeling <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160419220706/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/16/andrea_peysers_hate-filled_rant_on.php">every ugly</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160419220706/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/08/andrea_peyser_wants_lindsay_to_go_f.php">self-loathing</a> fiber in her <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160419220706/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/11/hooker-turned-teacher_is_a_whore_wi.php">libelous body</a>&#x2014;is their prize horse. </p>

<p>Ah shit, who are we kidding. All we want in this world is an hour alone with the cream of Queens, an auburn-haired hottie with gams like sexy tree trunks. This cross-legged, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160419220706/http://gawker.com/5410904/andrea-peyser-lesbian-racist">bi-curious, somewhat-racist</a> cupcake is the object of our pre-middle aged lust, and we see nothing wrong with fantasizing about this hellcat hiking up her skirt and exposing nothing but the sheer blackness of her soul. </p>
