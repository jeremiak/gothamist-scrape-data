</div></div>					<p>The Queen Of Stormy Weather wasn&apos;t too kind to many outdoor events in the city yesterday&#x2014;even the &quot;rain or shine&quot; annual World Naked Bike Ride <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170325070452/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/12/naked_bike_riders_scared_off_by_a_l.php#photo-1">was postponed</a> till July. But no storm clouds could stand in the way of people and their colorfully attired pets: the first annual Pet Day at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170325070452/http://www.wonderwheel.com/">Wonder Wheel Park</a> took place yesterday, which included the Coney Island Pet Costume Contest. </p>

<p>According to photographer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170325070452/http://colormekatie.blogspot.com/">Katie Sokoler</a>, who attended the event, there was a small but enthusiastic turnout, which went by quickly because of the rain (she adds that &quot;the rainbow guy won&quot;). In addition to the contest, the Coney Island History Project invited people to take a souvenir photo of your small pet &quot;riding&quot; our Steeplechase horse or Kiddie Whip Car...except no one showed up apparently. Click through for some photos of the event above.</p>
