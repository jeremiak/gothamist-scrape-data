<p>One person <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140410034953/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/23/nyregion/gas-leak-kills-man-at-long-island-mall.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">was killed and 27 others were injured</a> after a carbon monoxide leak at a mall on Long Island on Saturday. Legal Sea Foods and two other restaurants at the Walt Whitman Mall in Huntington Station, Cheesecake Factory and Panera Bread, were evacuated around 6 p.m. yesterday. Legal Sea Foods manager Steven Nelson, 55, and an unidentified woman, were found suffering from carbon monoxide poisoning in the building&#x2019;s basement.</p>

Twenty-six other people, mostly restaurant and rescue workers, including three cops and four medics, were also hospitalized because of carbon monoxide. All 26 are in stable condition and are expected to be released from the hospital today. </p>

<p>According to Suffolk County Police Commissioner Edward Webber, investigators are still trying to determine what caused the leak, and are focusing on the building&apos;s heating system. </p>
