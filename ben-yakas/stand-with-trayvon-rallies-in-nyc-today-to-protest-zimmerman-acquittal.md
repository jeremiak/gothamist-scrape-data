<p>After George Zimmerman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130827154851/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/13/george_zimmerman_found_not_guilty_i.php#photo-1">was acquitted</a> in the killing of Trayvon Martin in Florida, rallies sprung up all across the country last night. Multiple peaceful rallies are scheduled to happen around NYC today as well: at 1 p.m., there will be a protest <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130827154851/https://twitter.com/lex6m/status/356401173038776321">at the Harlem State Building</a> at W. 125th Street and 7th Avenue. At 2 p.m., there&apos;ll be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130827154851/https://twitter.com/VibeMagazine/status/356265292915159040">one at Union Square</a>. There is also one at 5 p.m. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130827154851/https://twitter.com/LifeInGotham/status/356331972878024705">at Borough Hall</a> in Brooklyn, and then another <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130827154851/https://www.facebook.com/events/677623498930010/">rally at 6 p.m. at Union Square.</a></p>

<p>Last night, nearly 50 demonstrators with signs and candles in plastic cups gathered in Union Square after the verdict was announced. &quot;It&apos;s hard to comprehend what I saw on the television screen tonight ... If (Zimmerman&apos;s) able to get off this easily, what example does this set for people like him?&quot; Aaron Black, a consultant from the Bronx, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130827154851/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/cops-clear-union-square-zimmerman-protesters-article-1.1398335">told the News</a>. &quot;I&apos;m shocked. He should be doing jail time. I am fuming right now.&quot; Those protests were broken up by police around 2 a.m. </p>
