<p>A Chicago street artist who became known for tagging subway cars and buildings across the East Coast <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170317155800/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/queens/subway_graffiti_artist_busted_caused_3zwiYlolBupAzXro8ap7RI">was arraigned</a> in Queens court today. Chicago resident Zebadiah Arrington, 19, was charged with causing thousands of dollars of damage to seven A, F and 7 trains over the last three years, tagging the cars with his signature &quot;ZEB&quot; moniker. </p>

<p>Arrington, a Chicago Art Institute student, would make several trips a year to NYC to graffiti lines such as &quot;Bomb the System,&quot; &quot;Year 2010 Yo,&quot; &quot;Nyke&quot; and &quot;Slugs,&quot; onto the Queens trains. He was allegedly caught when he emailed photos of his work to friends back home. Arrington, a member of the Chicago-based national graffiti crew known as &quot;Chicago&apos;s Most Wanted,&quot; is also a suspect in tagging incidents in Boston, Philadelphia, and New Jersey.  &quot;Zebadiah Arrington is a very unusual young man. He&apos;s having a hard time channeling his creative output in a productive way,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170317155800/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/11/04/2010-11-04_graffiti_artist_zebadiah_arrington_known_as_zeb_nabbed_for_emailing_photos_of_hi.html?r=news">said his lawyer</a>, Florian Miedel. </p>

<p>You can see more of his work <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170317155800/http://www.flickr.com/photos/41804908@N07/4424707147/">here</a>. In an interview with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170317155800/http://www.bombingscience.com/index.php/blog/viewThread/2376">Bombing Science</a>, he sounds quite content with how his career is progressing: </p>

<blockquote>Looking back on how I got into photography, I feel that my art has expanded outside of the realm of graffiti and into the realm of documentation, and photo journalism. The first time I picked up a camera was to create an image of a graffiti piece I did on a cardboard box, and to make it look like as if it were a real wall in the photograph. Then I started taking photos of the actual walls I began to paint, and now I have ventured outside of the wall and am more interested in the surrounding environments.</blockquote>

<p>The arrest comes in the wake of the unveiling of the massive underground street art <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170317155800/http://gothamist.com/2010/10/31/the_underbelly_project.php">Underbelly Project</a> last weekend, which went undetected by NYPD and MTA workers for over a year.</p>
