title: Madoff's New Gig: Working On Ethics Courses For Biz Schools

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="4911madoffbars.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20111031140809im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/4911madoffbars.jpg" width="365" height="329" class="image-left"> </span>After years of silence, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111031140809/http://gothamist.com/tags/bernardmadoff">Bernie Madoff</a> has been giving a very few select <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111031140809/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/16/madoff_banks_had_to_know_he_was_run.php">interviews</a> the last couple months. We&apos;ve learned that he thinks the banks were complicit with his massive Ponzi scheme, he feels terrible about what he&apos;s done to his family, and he&apos;s not quite sure if he&apos;s a sociopath or not. In a brand new, intense interview <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111031140809/http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/a29d2b4a-60b7-11e0-a182-00144feab49a.html#axzz1J3stik8U">with the Financial Times</a>, Madoff retold the whole twisted story of his rise and fall in the money world, and also claimed to possibly have a new job opportunity: developing ethics courses for some of the elite businesses schools in the country.</p>

<p>After setting &quot;ground rules&quot; for the interview, Madoff said he took complete responsibility for his actions, and begins telling his tale. Financial Times writes that it&apos;s a particularly well rehearsed one: &quot;In the flesh, Madoff spins a credible tale of how a renegade entrepreneur conquered Wall Street and was drawn into crime by personalities and forces he could not control. It sounds almost convincing.&quot; Among the stranger details to emerge from the interview: Madoff has become a big fan of Danielle Steele novels, he &quot;blinks intensely and often&quot; like a poker tell, and several business schools, including Harvard and Northwestern, have allegedly approached him, and asked him to work on ethics courses. A spokesman for Harvard <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111031140809/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/2011/04/09/2011-04-09_bernard_madoff_claims_business_schools_want_him_to_help_work_on_ethics_courses.html">told the News</a> that &quot;it seems unlikely&quot; Madoff meant the institution had reached out to him.</p>

<p>With all the intricate details of his financial scheme, the whole sprawling article is worth a read-through. Madoff also addresses the Mets&apos; involvement in his scheme, and said the Wilpons had no idea what was going on. &#x201C;<strong>They were totally unsophisticated. Their mistake was over-extending themselves with the team, with that leverage</strong>,&#x201D; Madoff said. He also said that individuals should not be pursued by Irving Picard, the trustee who is representing a group of Madoff victims, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111031140809/http://gothamist.com/tags/wilpons">is suing</a> the Wilpons company Sterling Equities for $1 billion. &#x201C;I do not think that Picard will be successful in clawing back money from individuals, including the Mets family. He shouldn&#x2019;t. If they can claw money back from the average person who was involved, then who will ever invest in a hedge fund ever again? But the banks are different,&quot; Madoff said.</p>
