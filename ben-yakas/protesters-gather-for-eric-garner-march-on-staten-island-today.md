Thousands of people have begun gathering on Staten Island for today&apos;s much-anticipated <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428171405/http://nationalactionnetwork.net/wewillnotgoback/">We Will Not Go Back march</a> against police brutality. Led by Rev. Al Sharpton and his National Action Network, the march is held in solidarity with the family of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428171405/http://gothamist.com/tags/ericgarner">Eric Garner</a>, the Staten Island man who was killed when a cop placed him in a chokehold during an arrest last month.</p>

<p>Hundreds of cops are also expected to be at the march; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428171405/http://gothamist.com/2014/08/22/heavy_police_presence_expected_at_s.php">some sources say their presence</a> would be &quot;as unthreatening as possible,&quot; while others said they&apos;ve been instructed to bring their &quot;hats and bats&quot;&#x2014;riot gear comprised of helmets and nightsticks.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428171405/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/23/opinion/staten-island-protest-over-eric-garner-chokehold-death.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;_r=0">In an editorial today</a>, the NY Times about de Blasio&apos;s response to the protests: &quot;In one sense, the protesters have already won. The Garner case is not being brushed aside; the Staten Island district attorney has said he will present it to a grand jury, and the involvement of several other oversight bodies seems to assure a thorough investigation. What is less certain &#x2014; and this is the larger point of the protest &#x2014; is whether aggrieved residents will achieve some level of faith in the future of policing in Mayor Bill de Blasio&#x2019;s New York.&quot;</p>

<p>Sharpton, Garner&apos;s family, former Gov. David Patterson and more organized at Mount Sinai United Christian Church this morning, calling for a peaceful demonstration. Check out some tweets from the ground below.</p>
