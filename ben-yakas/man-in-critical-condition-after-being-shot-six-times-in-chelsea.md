<p>Three suspects are in custody and a man is in critical condition after he was shot six times in Chelsea last night.</p>

<p>Police say the incident happened around 22nd Street near 6th Avenue just before 1 a.m. Sunday morning. The 44-year-old victim, whose name has not been released, was walking along 22nd Street when he was shot six times in the torso, leg and groin. The man was taken to Bellevue Hospital, where he is currently in surgery and listed in critical but stable condition.</p>

<p>A team of plainclothes police officers were in the area when they heard several shots ring out. They saw a black Mercedes-Benz sedan double-parked, and a man run toward the vehicle from the direction where the shots were heard. A quick chase ensued, which ended on 19th Street near Park Avenue when the Mercedes made a sudden stop and cops rear-ended them. </p>

<p>Three men were arrested: Ramel Harkless, 38, was charged with assault, criminal use of firearm and criminal possession of a weapon; Joseph Saunders, 43, was charged with criminal possession of a weapon; and Barry Wiles, 46, was charged with criminal possession of a weapon and reckless endangerment. </p>

<p>Police are still trying to determine the cause of the shooting, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161019101225/http://abc7ny.com/news/3-suspects-arrested-after-man-shot-in-manhattan/1557482/">they believe</a> the suspects knew the victim. </p>
