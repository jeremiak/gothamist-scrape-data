<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150928231927/http://gothamist.com/tags/StrandBookstore">The Strand Bookstore</a> is one of our <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150928231927/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/16/the_best_classic_stores_in_nyc.php">favorite places</a> in NYC, but that doesn&apos;t mean they&apos;re perfect: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150928231927/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20131114/greenwich-village/strand-books-yanks-warning-signs-for-sprinklers-used-douse-homeless?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter#slideshow_modal_slot_1">DNAInfo reports that</a> The Strand regularly uses its sprinkler system to deter homeless people from sleeping beneath its red awning. </p>

<p>Up until last week, there were signs posted reading, &#x201C;Warning: Sprinkler System Will Run Periodically From 10:30 PM-9:00 AM&#x201D; on the walls of the shop at the corner of East 12th Street and Broadway. &#x201C;It was to keep people from sleeping out there,&#x201D; one Strand bookseller <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150928231927/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20131114/greenwich-village/strand-books-yanks-warning-signs-for-sprinklers-used-douse-homeless?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter#slideshow_modal_slot_1">told DNAinfo</a>. &#x201C;People used to sleep over there and in the morning we have to put out the book carts, so it was a little bit difficult and uncomfortable for some people.&quot;</p>

<p>Strand manager Eddie Sutton denied the sprinklers were used to drive away the homeless, saying they were there to clean the sidewalk, but homeless neighborhood regulars say otherwise: &#x201C;It was bad because you get soaking wet,&quot; said Michael Pilgrim, 44, who sleeps across the street from The Strand. &quot;If you&#x2019;re lying there and you don&#x2019;t know about it, everything is going to get soaking wet &#x2014; all your personal belongings. You&#x2019;re going to freeze, basically.&quot;</p>

<p>NYC is currently <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150928231927/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/19/bloomberg_thinks_homelessness_is_go.php">dealing with</a> a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150928231927/http://gothamist.com/tags/homeless">homeless epidemic</a> not seen since the Great Depression; approximately 50,000 people <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150928231927/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/18/the_american_dream_in_action_homele.php">spend the night</a> in NYC homeless shelters.</p>

<p>A publicist for the Strand has not responded to a request for comment. </p>
