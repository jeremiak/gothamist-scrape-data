<p>At the start of the new year, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170624095535/http://gothamist.com/tags/alecbaldwin">Alec Baldwin</a> promised to keep playing Donald Trump on SNL for as long as he could, then cryptically <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170624095535/http://gothamist.com/2017/01/11/alec_baldwin_considering_performing.php">dropped the news</a> that he was also in discussions about &quot;other venues we might pursue to further express our gratitude and admiration for the Trump administration.&quot; While we initially assumed that meant more TV work, it turns out Baldwin has actually been working <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170624095535/http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/newsbrief/index.html?record=1222">on a satirical book</a> about Trump titled, <em>You Can&#x2019;t Spell America Without Me: The Really Tremendous Inside Story of My Fantastic First Year as President Donald J. Trump.</em></p>

<p>The faux-memoir will be written by Baldwin and Kurt Andersen, who in addition to being a novelist and host of WNYC&apos;s &quot;Studio 360&quot; was also a founding editor of Spy Magazine, which famously poked fun at Trump for years, coining the phrase &quot;short-fingered vulgarian,&quot; which infuriates Trump to this day. The book is scheduled to be released in November, and Baldwin will read the audiobook as Trump.</p>

<p>&quot;I didn&apos;t think this former hobby of mine would return with this ferocity,&quot; Andersen <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170624095535/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/01/arts/kurt-andersen-alec-baldwin-to-write-satirical-book-about-president-trump.html?_r=0">told the Times today</a>. He explained that he was impressed by Baldwin&apos;s impersonation because it is extreme, &quot;and with a guy like Donald Trump, to be effective it needs to be extreme.&quot; </p>

<p>As for their methodology for writing the book, Andersen said, &quot;I think we&apos;ll be channeling and amplifying the real Trump. Writing for a five- or 10-minute sketch is different than writing a book, which has to be a narrative...It&apos;ll be sharp. I&apos;m going to start talking like Trump: It&apos;ll be great! It&apos;ll be fantastic! But it will be sharp. It won&apos;t just be fun-loving.&quot;</p>

<p>Baldwin added, &quot;I think it&apos;s fair to say that Kurt will do most of the writing. We have that arrangement whereby he doesn&apos;t put on the wig, I don&apos;t open up a Word document.&quot; He also offered some optimistic thoughts: &quot;There will be a moment when this will be over. When Trump will fade into ignominy and take with him his ability to outstrip satire.&quot;</p>
