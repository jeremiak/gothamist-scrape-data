Which leaves only one question: who has the best theme song? </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160724091659/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/26/sports/baseball/26songs.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">According to</a> the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160724091659/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/26/wall_street_journal_unveils_greater.php&lt;br /&gt;
">anti-WSJ</a>, the Mets theme, &quot;Meet the Mets,&quot; takes the cake! The Times recaps the history of both that tune and the Yankees fight song, &quot;Here Comes the Yankees,&quot; and finds marked differences in the legacy and use of each ditty. &quot;Meet the Mets,&quot; which was written by Ruth Roberts and adopted by the team in their second season of existence, &quot;manages to express the team&#x2019;s unaggressive image.&quot;</p>

<p>On the other hand, Lou Stallman&apos;s Yankees theme is much more agressive, something &quot;George Steinbrenner could have composed.&quot; And while &quot;Meet the Mets&quot; has endured for the Mets, played at Citifield, in promotional ads on SNY and as the opening song for broadcasts on WFAN, the Yankees song only gets played in a reduced instrumental form before and after WCBS Radio broadcasts. </p>

<p>So which song&#x2014;audio of both are after the jump&#x2014;do you think is the best?</p>
