<p>A Long Island father <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504151143/http://www.newsday.com/long-island/nassau/cops-dad-charged-in-death-of-baby-left-in-car-1.5930845">has been arrested</a> after his 7-month-old son died in a parked car where the temperature reached at least 119 degrees. Devon Fenner, 25, has been charged with criminally negligent homicide in the death of his son Dominick on Tuesday. It&apos;s believed the infant was left in the vehicle for a half hour.</p>

<p>Fenner <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504151143/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Man-Arrest-Left-Baby-Car-Death-Long-Island-Police-220528991.html">told detectives</a> that he accidentally forgot to take Dominick out of the 2003 Toyota after dropping off his girlfriend at work and taking two other kids, a 7-year-old son and 4-year-old girl, to day care at 1 p.m. that day. The driver&apos;s side window had been rolled down slightly: &quot;Unfortunately, cracking the window on a 90-degree day doesn&apos;t do much,&quot; said Insp. Kenneth Lack, a Nassau police spokesman. The temperature inside the car on Tuesday afternoon was written as 119 degrees in the criminal complaint.</p>

<p>Fenner called 911 when he realized he had left the child inside the car, and he wasn&apos;t breathing anymore. He was declared dead around 2:30 p.m., and Fenner was immediately arrested. Police <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504151143/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/baby_left_to_die_in_hot_car_dv5AKXilU68D6EV5lNBSXI">said they found</a> a &#x201C;misdemeanor&#x201D; amount of marijuana on Fenner, and will determine if he was high at the time.</p>
