<p>This week, Donald Trump <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170914120029/http://dcist.com/2017/02/trump_administration_officially_rev.php">rescinded protections</a> for transgender students that had allowed them to use bathrooms of their own choice. Both <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170914120029/http://gothamist.com/tags/sethmeyers">Seth Meyers</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170914120029/http://gothamist.com/tags/stephencolbert">Stephen Colbert</a> came out with strong segments castigating Trump over his hypocrisy on the issue, with Colbert devoting the opening of <em>Late Show</em> to giving Trump the middle finger.</p>

<p>&quot;Speaking of things getting worse... Donald Trump said transgender students can&apos;t use the bathrooms they want to use,&quot; Colbert said at the top of his monologue. &quot;We should have seen this coming, because if there&apos;s one thing Trump is famous for, it&apos;s telling people where to pee.&quot; As for the administration&apos;s argument that this is strictly a legal concern, Colbert added, &quot;Oh, grow a pair. Is there a more cowardly phrase than, &apos;this is a state&apos;s rights issue&apos;?&quot;</p>

<p>Colbert also responded to reports that Trump staffers show the news he consumes includes a steady stream of praise to stave off any Twitter tirades (&quot;we do know he likes a steady stream&quot;) by airing his own &quot;Real News Tonight&quot; broadcast with all the news Trump really wants to hear.</p>

<p>Seth Meyers also attacked Trump over the transgender bathroom law changes: &quot;First, you demonize Muslims, then immigrants, and now the transgender community,&quot; he said. &quot;There&apos;s apparently this fear that transgender kids are using it as ruse to sneak into restrooms and grab people by the genitals, but if you&apos;re looking for the kind of person who would do that, you need to look no further than the Oval Office.&quot;</p>

<p>And in the &quot;A Closer Look&quot; segment, Meyers covered how Republicans have been handling&#x2014;or not handling&#x2014;heated town hall protests with angry constituents. &quot;GOP town halls have gotten so rowdy that even just mentioning the name of the vice president will earn you a defining round of boos,&#x201D; Meyers said. &quot;You have to give it to Mike Pence. He&#x2019;s the only guy who can get booed at a Broadway musical in Manhattan, a town hall in Utah and a minor league baseball game in his home state of Indiana.&quot;</p>
