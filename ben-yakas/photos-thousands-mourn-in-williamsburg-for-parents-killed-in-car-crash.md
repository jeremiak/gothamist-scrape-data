Early Sunday morning, a young Orthodox husband and his pregnant wife <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504151211/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/03/young_pregnant_couple_killed_in_cra.php">were both killed in a car crash in Brooklyn</a> while on their way to the hospital. Nathan and Raizi Glauber, both 21, were killed in the tragic crash; despite Raizi Glauber being six months pregnant, their baby was born prematurely. (<b>Update, 3/4</b>: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504151211/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/04/baby_whose_parents_were_killed_in_w.php">The baby has died</a>.) As you can see in the photos above, thousands of people took to the streets of Williamsburg today to mourn the young couple.</p>

<p>Several local politicians have already acknowledged the incident in speeches today. Councilman Stephen Levin <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504151211/https://twitter.com/RabbiZee/status/308313567449452545">is calling on</a> the DOT to immediately place a traffic signal at the intersection of Kent Avenue and Wilson Street, where the crash occurred. At a rally to announce his candidacy for Brooklyn Borough President, Senator Eric Adams opened up his speech <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504151211/https://twitter.com/RabbiAFriedman/status/308313286493999105">with a moment of silence</a> in remembrance of the couple. </p>

<p>The couple, who had been married for less than a year, were on their way to Long Island College Hospital around 12:30 a.m. &quot;for a wellness check,&quot; said an NYPD spokeswoman. &quot;It was sudden,&quot; Sarah Gluck, Raizy Gluber&apos;s cousin, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504151211/http://www.cnn.com/2013/03/03/us/new-york-crash-baby/index.html">told CNN</a>. &quot;She just wasn&apos;t feeling well and they just, they went to check it out.&quot; According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504151211/https://twitter.com/HQSatmar/status/308119054810501120">Satmar Headquarters Twitter</a>, &quot;Early report from 90pct: Hit and Run Driver of BMW involved in Glauber accident was heavily intoxicated, speed is estimated at over 60mph.&quot;</p>

<p>A witness at the scene <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504151211/http://www.vosizneias.com/125402/2013/03/03/williamsburg-ny-serious-accident-claims-life-of-mother">told VIN News</a> what he saw: &#x201C;I wasn&#x2019;t there when it happened, but I was nearby and when I saw the fire department and Jewish ambulances coming, I ran over,&#x201D; Shulem Amram said.  &#x201C;The fire department had to cut open the car. They took off the windshield and the roof and took the male out of the car and laid him down. A few seconds later, they noticed the woman lying under the tractor trailer.&#x201D; Initially it was reported that the baby was delivered by EMTs from the Hatzolah ambulance service, but now officials say the baby was delivered via emergency C-section at Bellevue Hospital.</p>

<p>The baby, who is just four pounds, is currently in stable condition in the ICU at Bellevue Hospital, and expected to live. Isaac Abraham, a community leader in Williamsburg, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504151211/http://mobile.nytimes.com/2013/03/04/nyregion/expectant-couple-killed-on-way-to-hospital.xml">told the Times</a>, &quot;Most of the resources are going to the child to make sure he gets all the medical attention he needs.&quot;  Police are still searching for the driver of the BMW that hit the Glauber&apos;s car, who fled the scene on foot.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504151211/https://twitter.com/THE_SHEESER">family friends on Twitter</a>, the video below shows Nathan (Nachmen) Glauber dancing during Purim last week.</p>
