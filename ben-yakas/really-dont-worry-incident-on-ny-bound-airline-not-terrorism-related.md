										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="aapic0911.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170319125843im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/aapic0911.jpg" width="225" height="179" class="image-left"> </span>We&apos;ve <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170319125843/http://twitter.com/#!/NYScanner/status/112972168719106048">just been hearing word</a> that there were three people locked in the bathroom of a NY-bound American Airlines Flight, refusing to come out. Two F-16 Flight Jets were called in to shadow the flight&#x2014;but DON&apos;T WORRY! The pilot is in communication, reporting there is no threat level and the passengers have &quot;returned to their seats.&quot; The flight is about to land at JFK momentarily, the situation seems to have been resolved, and several <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170319125843/http://twitter.com/#!/AntDeRosa/status/112976623065763840">law enforcement officials</a> confirm the incident was not terrorism-related. </p>

<p>So one thing to keep in mind for the future: try not to suspiciously lock yourself in the bathroom of an airline on 9/11. </p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: According <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170319125843/http://twitter.com/#!/CNBCbrk/status/112995133561118720">to NBC</a>, at least two, possibly three, passengers aboard the AA Flight 34 <strong>were drunk and refused to follow flight attendant instructions</strong>. So another thing to keep in mind when you fly on an airplane on 9/11: don&apos;t be a drunken idiot.</p>
