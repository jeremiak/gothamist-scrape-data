<p>On Friday night, a 23-year-old jogger <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170312234658/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/30/23-year-old_female_jogger_tasered_d.php">was Tasered during an attempted sexual assault</a> in a Queens park. The incident happened around 7:25 p.m. in Forest Park near Metropolitan Avenue and the Jackie Robinson Parkway. The suspect, who police released the above sketch of, Tasered the jogger from behind, stole her iPhone, then attempted to sexually assault her. &#x201C;That&#x2019;s really scary,&#x201D; fellow park jogger Katelyn Levin <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170312234658/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/queens/joggers-high-alert-stun-gun-attack-article-1.1303621?localLinksEnabled=false">told the News</a>. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m horrified by the thought that there is a predator on the loose with a stun gun.&#x201D;</p>

<p>The suspect dragged the woman into the bushes, and she reportedly fought him off; according <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170312234658/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Woman-Tasered-Sexually-Assaulted-Queens-Forest-Park-200737001.html">to NBC</a>, a couple walking their dog came upon the attack in progress, startling the man, who then ran off. The woman was taken to Queens General Hospital for injuries to her neck.</p>

<p>Police are warning joggers in that park to be wary, but as has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170312234658/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/12/teen_speaks_about_getting_beaten_wi.php">been previously noted</a>, security at parks around the city is almost non-existant at this point. &#x201C;I hate guns,&#x201D; Levin told the News. &#x201C;But seriously, it&#x2019;s getting to the point where women in New York need to carry weapons to protect themselves.&#x201D;</p>

<p>The suspect is described as being a M/W, 35-40 years old, 5&apos;9&quot;,  medium build, last seen wearing a gold hoop earring, navy blue hooded sweatshirt, navy blue track pants with reddish/brown hair and facial hair. </p>

<p>Anyone with information in regard to this incident is asked to call Crime Stoppers at 1-800-577-TIPS (8477).  The public can also submit their tips by logging onto <a href="WWW.NYPDCRIMESTOPPERS.COM">the Crime Stoppers website</a> or by texting their tips to 274637 (CRIMES) then enter TIP577.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: Geoffrey Croft of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170312234658/http://nycparkadvocates.org/">NYC Park Advocates</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170312234658/http://awalkintheparknyc.blogspot.com/">A Walk In The Park</a> expanded upon the matter of park security to us: &quot;There have been a number of sexual assaults in that park over the years including two rapes in 2011. We need dedicated officers for our parks.  Once again we are calling on the city to restore the Park Enforcement to at least the 1990&apos;s levels which was 450 officers&#x2014;currently we have less than one-third of that. Also as a reminder it is never a good idea to jog with ear phones in parks.&quot;</p>
