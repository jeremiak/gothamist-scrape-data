<p>This week, the internet <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161254/http://laist.com/2013/08/23/ben_affleck_is_the_new_batman_possi.php#photo-1">collectively hyperventilated into a paper bag</a> after learning that <em>Surviving Christmas</em> star Ben Affleck would play Batman in the upcoming sequel to <em>Man Of Steel</em>. There were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161254/http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2013/08/23/ben-affleck-batman-casting/2691833/">thinkpieces</a> galore, thinkpieces <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161254/http://www.forbes.com/sites/markhughes/2013/08/24/6-reasons-the-internet-is-wrong-about-ben-affleck-as-batman/">about the thinkpieces</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161254/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/ben-affleck-as-batman-negative-613619">desperate petitions</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161254/http://mashable.com/2013/08/23/ben-affleck-batman-memes/">memes</a>, and tortured philosophical comic universe discussions (wasn&apos;t it Descartes who asked if Daredevil could also be Batman?). Comedian and all around reasonable guy <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161254/http://gothamist.com/tags/pattonoswalt">Patton Oswalt</a> called for a moratorium on the hysteria today: &quot;No matter how many times you post your stupid &quot;Fire Ben Affleck from Playing Batman&quot; petition, I&apos;m going to delete it and block you. Take a deep breath, and think for a second.&quot;</p>

<p>You can see <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161254/https://www.facebook.com/pattonoswalt/posts/10151671848187655">his full Facebook plea</a> on behalf of Affleck and his rocky career below:</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="82413oswalt.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161254im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/82413oswalt.jpg" width="640" height="603"> <br> <i> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161254/https://www.facebook.com/pattonoswalt/posts/10151671848187655">via Facebook</a></i></div> <p></p>

<p>Hey, Joss Whedon <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161254/http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2013/08/24/joss-whedon-ben-affleck/2694733/">agrees with him</a>! He knows something about making good comic book movies. So <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161254/http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/9594200/the-summer-no-mailbag">does Bill Simmons</a>. Here&apos;s his take on the surprising casting news for good measure:</p>

<blockquote>I don&apos;t have a defense, more of a theory. On the face of it, Affleck taking a massive risk like this makes no sense whatsoever. He just spent the past six years rebuilding his career, reestablishing himself as an A-lister and completing one of the greatest comebacks in Hollywood history.

<p>But here&apos;s the thing &#x2026;</p>

<p>I don&apos;t think it was enough for him. I think he&apos;s still in &quot;Eff You&quot; mode from all the abuse he took during the Bennifer era, for people writing him off, and for the Academy not giving him that Best Director nomination for Argo. And obviously, he&apos;s been on fire with career decisions for the last few years and feels like he can&apos;t do anything wrong. So this is part hubris and part &quot;Eff You&quot; &#x2014; Affleck knew taking that Batman part would be polarizing, he knew he didn&apos;t need it financially or professionally, and he didn&apos;t care. If he pulls it off, now it&apos;s not just one of the great Hollywood comebacks ever, it&apos;s THE GREATEST Hollywood comeback ever.</p>

<p>So really, this is the Hollywood equivalent of the 2007 Pats trying to go 19-0 post-Spygate. Ben Affleck is trying to run up the score on us right now. How can you not respect him for this?</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>Are you convinced you can give Affleck a chance? Or will you just tell your kids that Batman is dead?</p>
