<p>Tons of musicians, friends, and admirers have offered their own remembrances and tributes to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503153326/http://gothamist.com/tags/loureed">Lou Reed</a> in the four days since he died. But today, his wife Laurie Anderson submitted her own notice <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503153326/http://easthamptonstar.com/Obituaries/20131031/Lou-Reed#.UnKw_F57aZs.email">to The East Hampton Star</a>, and it&apos;s a doozy: &quot;He died on Sunday morning looking at the trees and doing the famous 21 form of tai chi with just his musician hands moving through the air.&quot;</p>

<p>You can read the whole thing:</p>

<blockquote>To our neighbors:

<p>What a beautiful fall! Everything shimmering and golden and all that incredible soft light. Water surrounding us.</p>

<p>Lou and I have spent a lot of time here in the past few years, and even though we&#x2019;re city people this is our spiritual home.</p>

<p>Last week I promised Lou to get him out of the hospital and come home to Springs. And we made it!</p>

<p>Lou was a tai chi master and spent his last days here being happy and dazzled by the beauty and power and softness of nature. He died on Sunday morning looking at the trees and doing the famous 21 form of tai chi with just his musician hands moving through the air.</p>

<p>Lou was a prince and a fighter and I know his songs of the pain and beauty in the world will fill many people with the incredible joy he felt for life. Long live the beauty that comes down and through and onto all of us.</p>

<p>&#x2014; Laurie Anderson<br>
his loving wife and eternal friend</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>And below, watch what is believed to be Reed&apos;s final live performance, singing Velvet Underground classic &quot;Candy Says&quot; with Antony at Salle Pleyel in Paris on June 3rd this past summer.</p>
