<p>At <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502235833/http://gothamist.com/2012/11/07/watch_live_soon_bloomberg_gives_upd.php">his afternoon press conference</a>, Mayor Bloomberg announced a new interactive way for people in need of housing because of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502235833/http://gothamist.com/tags/hurricanesandy">Hurricane Sandy</a> to connect with people who have room to take in those without heat and power. Already, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502235833/https://www.airbnb.com/s?collection_id=7046134">136 people have opened up their homes</a> for free to people affected by Sandy via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502235833/https://twitter.com/Airbnb">Airbnb</a>. And you can too if you have the space!</p>

<p>It comes at exactly the right time, now that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502235833/http://gothamist.com/2012/11/07/fema_closes_hurricane_assistance_sh.php">FEMA and the Red Cross are both curtailing operations</a> on Staten Island, Coney Island, and the Rockways because of the Nor&apos;Easter blowing through town. Airbnb aren&apos;t charging any fees from housing arrangements made, but guests will need to provide credit card information in order to verify identity. </p>

<p>&quot;If you live close to an affected area and have an extra house, an extra room, or even a spare couch, we encourage you to sign up to help,&quot; Airbnb <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502235833/http://blog.airbnb.com/airbnb-is-partnering-with-mayor-bloomberg-to">wrote on its blog.</a> And considering the considerable challenges of finding housing for 20-40K people whose homes were damaged during the storm, it&apos;s something a lot of people could really use right now.</p>
