<p>As one of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170223083042/http://ijr.com/2016/01/524208-snl-loves-to-slam-gop-but-heres-a-look-at-all-the-cast-members-whove-gone-conservative/">only a few</a> outspokenly conservative former cast members of <em>Saturday Night Live</em> (see: Dennis Miller, Victoria Jackson, Jon Lovitz, Rob Schneider), Joe Piscopo has enjoyed a robust second career in Republican circles, at least since he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170223083042/http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/aug/14/piscopo-confessions-of-a-disillusioned-democrat/">swore off the Democratic Party in 2014.</a> Between his morning radio talk show and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170223083042/http://observer.com/2016/11/piscopo-reaching-out-to-county-party-gop-chairs-concerning-2017-guv-run/">shmoozing with</a> Republicans at the Republican National Convention, Piscopo has been working hard to revive his fading career as the guy who impersonates Frank Sinatra. And now he&apos;s ready to take it to the next level and potentially throw in his hat for the New Jersey gubernatorial race. He seems to be trying to take the Trump route there.</p>

<p>Although he is registered as an Independent, Piscopo has been flirting with running for office specifically as a Republican since at least last fall, when he told anyone who would listen that he wanted to run for NJ governor. He even <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170223083042/http://observer.com/2016/10/comedian-piscopo-feels-out-2017-nj-gubernatorial-bid-with-christie/">made overtures</a> with Chris Christie and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170223083042/http://observer.com/2016/11/piscopo-reaching-out-to-county-party-gop-chairs-concerning-2017-guv-run/">county party GOP chairs.</a> He continued his push over the winter, which led to video explainers like the one below, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170223083042/http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2016/10/is_joe_piscopo_thinking_of_running_for_nj_governor.html?utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_source=twitterfeed">via NJ Advance</a>. </p>

<p>All the speculation reached a critical mass today, with the NY Times making his political assertions credible with their story, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170223083042/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/20/nyregion/joe-piscopo-new-jersey-governor.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=second-column-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news">&quot;Joe Piscopo Considers Running for Governor of New Jersey. No Joke.&quot;</a> They describe Piscopo working the crowd at John Catsimatidis&apos; recent <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170223083042/http://gothamist.com/2017/01/30/panda_panda_panda.php">Black and White Panda Fundraising Ball</a>: &quot;I&#x2019;m very serious about it,&quot; Piscopo told them. &quot;I&#x2019;ve never been more serious about anything in my life.&quot; He already has Catsimatidis&apos;s support (&quot;to the maximum&quot;) and New Jersey pollsters think his name recognition could potentially take him places: &quot;Whether that turns into actual approval and support among New Jersey residents and New Jersey voters, that&#x2019;s another story, but I think there&#x2019;s a lot of ground that every candidate has to cover,&quot; Ashley Koning, the director at the Eagleton Center for Public Interest Polling at Rutgers, told the Times.</p>

<p>But the underlying story here is one that has been scurrying around ever since Trump became the official Republican candidate for president last year: what sort of reverberations would there be once a two-bit reality TV star who doesn&apos;t pay his debts became a national political figure? How many other has-beens and loudmouths with public recognition would look at Trump and say to themselves, &quot;I could do that too&quot;? While there have been other show-biz celebrities who have parlayed their fame into a political career (Jesse Ventura, Al Franken, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Ronald Reagan), none degraded the public discourse like Trump has, bursting the door open to the possibility of a real life <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170223083042/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGUNPMPrxvA">President Dwayne Elizondo Mountain Dew Herbert Camacho.</a> </p>

<p>And make no mistake: Piscopo&apos;s newly-revived political ambitions were inspired by Trump, and any campaign he runs would likely be modeled on Trump as well. Piscopo eagerly campaigned for Trump during the election (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170223083042/http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2016/03/joe-piscapo/">&quot;Get out of the way, the Trump train is coming!&quot;</a>), and directly credits him with sparking his political ambitions. The Times says that Piscopo received encouragement on the campaign trail from the likes of Reince Priebus and Rudy Giuliani. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170223083042/http://abc7ny.com/politics/comedian-joe-piscopo-considering-a-run-for-new-jersey-governor/1650583/">As ABC put it:</a></p>

<blockquote>Piscopo has never campaigned for or held office, but considered running in 2004. What&apos;s different now? He said he feels emboldened by the against-all-odds victory of President-elect Donald Trump, whom he spoke for recently at a Florida rally.

<p>&quot;When I saw Mr. Trump in Tampa and he invited me to speak, I saw it was contagious. It was the movement. It wasn&apos;t the machine,&quot; he said.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>While ABC&apos;s experts were dubious about the possibility of replicating Trump&apos;s success, Piscopo has already started planting seeds in the bed Trump shat in. That includes a platform that aligns very closely with Trump&apos;s, in both substance and lack thereof: &quot;Mr. Piscopo has not done any of his own polling or started putting together a campaign staff,&quot; the Times writes. &quot;The bedrock of his policy centers largely on ideas to &apos;bring back jobs,&apos; a phrase familiar to anyone paying attention to the 2016 campaign.&quot; (Interestingly, there is one area in which Piscopo breaks from most Republicans, including Trump: he is adamantly pro-union, though we&apos;ll see whether that holds up come election season.)</p>

<p>Piscopo has also been following in Trump&apos;s ideologically-extreme footsteps by making appearances on Alex Jones&apos;s show, and doing things like calling the IRS a &quot;criminal organization&quot; and making fun of Hillary Clinton&apos;s coughing. </p>

<p>Whether he&apos;ll follow through on his ambitions, and whether the state of NJ really wants another blustery Republican after eight years of dealing with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170223083042/http://gothamist.com/tags/chrischristie">a corrupt bully who sold his soul for a chance at being Trump&apos;s meatloaf bitch</a>, remains to be seen. As Trump is now learning, governing is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170223083042/http://www.politico.com/story/2017/02/trump-reality-promises-235198">a lot harder than campaigning,</a> which could potentially scare off Piscopo.</p>

<p>But for what it&apos;s worth New Jersey, it actually could be worse.</p>
