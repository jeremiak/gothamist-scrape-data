<p>A 35-year-old cyclist <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031041133/http://gothamist.com/2016/07/02/brooklyn_cyclist_fatality.php">was fatally struck</a> by a hit-and-run driver in Williamsburg early Saturday morning. The victim has now been identified as one of the co-founders of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031041133/http://www.bikestocknyc.com/">Bikestock</a>, which operates self-serve bike repair vending machines in Brooklyn, Manhattan and Massachusetts.</p>

<p>Friends <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031041133/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/cyclist-pedestrians-struck-brooklyn-bronx-incidents-article-1.2696872">told the Daily News</a> that Matthew Von Ohlen had been headed home from a shift as a bartender at Apotheke in Manhattan when he was struck. Police say he was headed east on Grand Street near Graham Avenue in the bike lane when the driver of a black Chevy Camaro crashed into him around 2:20 a.m. Saturday. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031041133/http://nypost.com/2016/07/02/cyclist-killed-in-hit-and-run/">The Post has</a> graphic surveillance footage of the collision, which you can see below.</p>

<p>Von Ohlen suffered severe trauma to his body and was taken to Bellevue Hospital, where he was pronounced dead. &#x201C;He was killed like a dog in the street,&#x201D; neighbor Joanne Bascetta, who left flowers at the site where he was struck, told the Daily News. &quot;He&#x2019;s someone&#x2019;s child. It&#x2019;s heartbreaking. I just came out for support. I feel so bad for the family.&quot;</p>

<p>Von Ohlen started Bikestock with partner Joseph Huba in 2013. Here&apos;s his bio from the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031041133/http://www.bikestocknyc.com/about-bikestock/">company&apos;s website:</a></p>

<blockquote>Matthew lives and breathes cycling. A Minneapolis native, Matthew was lucky to grow up with the city&#x2019;s extensive greenway system, which connects the city&#x2019;s many lakes and creeks with the Mississippi River. Having spent the last five years bartending and tour managing, you could say Matthew is a people person.

<p>Matthew sees biking as a way to stay fit and to decrease his environmental impact, and is a strong advocate of year-round ridership. A Lawrence University graduate, Matthew has a B.A. in Anthropology, and is currently a mixologist at New York City&#x2019;s celebrated Apotheke.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>&quot;I loved Matt like a brother,&quot; Huba told The Post. &quot;It&#x2019;s really, really, really tough to lose someone like that.&quot;</p>

<p>Police add that the investigation is ongoing.</p>
