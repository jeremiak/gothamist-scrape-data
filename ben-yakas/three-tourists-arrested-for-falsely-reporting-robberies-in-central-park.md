<p>We know the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140401010019/http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304744304579250521791383050">54.3 million people</a> who visited NYC last year had certain expectations about what they would find here&#x2014;would they be accosted by a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140401010019/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/31/tourist_attacked_by_hammer-wielding.php">hammer-wielding local</a>? Would they be a prime witness to a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140401010019/http://gothamist.com/tags/subwayfight">crazy subway fight</a>? Alas, the reality for most visitors to de Blasio&apos;s NY is probably a little more boring than that. Which may be why three tourists decided to make up crimes and report them to cops. &quot;These people do this all the time,&quot; a Central Park officer told Parks Advocate Geoffrey Croft. &quot;They must see us on TV and say, &apos;This will be easy,&apos; but more often than not they get caught. They just don&apos;t think it through.&quot;</p>

<p>According <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140401010019/http://awalkintheparknyc.blogspot.com/2014/03/central-park-police-arrest-3-tourists.html">to A Walk In The Park</a>, the three tourists&#x2014;two from Finland and one from Australia&#x2014;made up false robbery reports in two separate incidents in the past two weeks. Cops say Finnish natives Pinja Pesonen, 27,  and Antti Vuorisalo, 34, walked into the Central Park precinct a little before 1 p.m. this past Tuesday and claimed that two white men had grabbed the women&apos;s handbag while they walked along East Drive near East 74th Street inside Central Park.</p>

<p>They filed a written report and drove around the area with cops looking for the suspects. When cops couldn&apos;t find any witnesses or surveillance footage, they pressed the couple for more details, and they recanted their statements and admitted they lied. They were both arrested and charged with filing a false police report. </p>

<p>And this wasn&apos;t the first time this happened recently: on March 16th, Australian tourist Larisa Ryan, 41, told cops she had been robbed of her iPad and iPhone at 72nd Street and West Drive also in the park. When police again couldn&apos;t find any evidence, the woman  confessed she had lied about the robbery with the plan to collect an insurance payment. She was arrested and charged with filing a false written statement to police, and pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct. <br>
