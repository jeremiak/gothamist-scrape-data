<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509165218/http://online.wsj.com/article/AP3b4030bb9c2e4aefbf4a6a14120421a9.html">A fire earlier today</a> has shuttered the Tick Tock Diner in Midtown&#x2014;and authorities believe it was caused by a discarded cigarette. The fire started in the facade of Tick Tock Diner, which is housed at 303 W. 34th Street in the New Yorker Hotel building, around 10:15 a.m. There was a packed house in the popular diner for Sunday brunch, and patrons didn&apos;t seem to mind a little smoke: &quot;We seat 300 people and it was a Sunday morning, so people were waiting on line,&quot; waiter Steve Tsiolis <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509165218/http://www.dnainfo.com/20111218/midtown/fire-breaks-out-at-tick-tock-diner-on-34th-street">told DNAInfo</a>. &quot;People kept eating. They didn&apos;t want to leave their food.&quot;</p>

<p>The fire started small, but quickly grew, with flames extended to the second floor of the building. &quot;You couldn&#x2019;t see any flames. All you saw was everybody coming out and smoke. The whole place was smoked out,&quot; said Luigi Forgione, who had just eaten at the diner before the fire started. They were able to get it under control without any injuries though.</p>

<p>Diner owner Alex Sgourdos <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509165218/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/smoking_kills_business_cig_fire_JNQKyY3aSfVIUOBcgSZfUL">told the Post that</a> firefighters told him the flames were sparked by a tossed smoke that rolled off the sidewalk and became wedged underneath the restaurant&apos;s metal fa&#xE7;ade, which has wood underneath. Sgourdos added that he plans to reopen Tuesday.</p>
