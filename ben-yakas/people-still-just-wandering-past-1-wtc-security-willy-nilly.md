<p>There have been a series of embarrassing security breaches at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408105304/http://gothamist.com/tags/wtc">One World Trade Center</a> in recent months, including a 16-year-old who snuck in and a trio of men who BASE jumped off the top. That led to several security changes for the building, including the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408105304/http://gothamist.com/2014/03/29/head_of_security_at_1_wtc_resigns_p.php">resignation of the head of security</a> for 1 WTC. After all this bad press, surely random people are no longer able to leisurely stroll into the site undetected, right? Err, nope.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408105304/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/1-World-Trade-Center-Security-Breach-Man-Walks-Past-Security-Guard-254991891.html">According to NBC</a>, a man with a backpack walked through an open gate at 1 WTC where a construction truck was exiting just before 5 p.m. on Wednesday. There was a security guard there, but he apparently <em>didn&apos;t notice</em> the man. The man, whose name hasn&apos;t been released, was eventually stopped by a different security guard a few minutes later once he was already inside the structure. He was escorted out and not charged with anything.</p>

<p>It turned out the man had an appointment in the building, but it still doesn&apos;t excuse the fact he was able to get so far in after all these other glaring security breaches. Security clearance for that guard has now been revoked. Good that that&apos;s done, but there&apos;s no explanation how he missed someone waltzing in. Didn&apos;t they already fire <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408105304/http://gothamist.com/2014/03/26/fired_half-blind_1_wtc_guard_agrees.php">the partially-blind guard who was snoozing on the job</a> the night 16-year-old Justin Casquejo snuck in?  </p>
