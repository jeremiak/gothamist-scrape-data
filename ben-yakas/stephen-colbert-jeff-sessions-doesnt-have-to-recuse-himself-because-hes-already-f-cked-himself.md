<p>After news broke this week that Attorney General Jeff Sessions <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170914134809/http://gothamist.com/2017/03/02/trump_loves_jeff.php">lied under oath to Congress</a> about meeting with Russian officials during the campaign, Sessions offered to recuse himself from any Russian investigations amid calls for his resignation. </p>

<p>&quot;Both sides of the aisle have called for Sessions to recuse himself from any Russian investigation, and this afternoon, Sessions agreed,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170914134809/http://gothamist.com/tags/stephencolbert">Stephen Colbert</a> said last night. &quot;You called yourself a campaign surrogate. Then you lied under oath that you never met with the Russians. So you don&apos;t have to recuse yourself, because you&apos;ve already fucked yourself.&quot;</p>

<p>Colbert also had a fun segment in which the Late Show&apos;s own personal anonymous White House leaker gave Colbert the latest Russia gossip.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170914134809/http://gothamist.com/tags/sethmeyers">Seth Meyers</a> also covered the Sessions drama with his latest A Closer Look segment, and was particularly tickled by Sessions&apos;s evasive answers about what he did or did not remember regarding his contacts with Russia: &quot;I guess we shouldn&#x2019;t be surprised, since leprechauns always talk in riddles.&quot;</p>
