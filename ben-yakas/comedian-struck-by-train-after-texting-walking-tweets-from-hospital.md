<p>This week, a woman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522035325/http://gothamist.com/2014/02/13/woman_struck_by_b_train_in_lower_ma.php">was struck by a train</a> after she slipped and fell on the platform while texting and walking. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522035325/http://lizadye.tumblr.com/">Liza Dye</a>, 25, was run over by a southbound B train at the Broadway-Lafayette Station around 10 a.m. Thursday. The train operator thankfully saw her fall and activated the emergency brake, but the first car rolled over her, injuring her legs. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522035325/https://twitter.com/lizadye">Dye</a>, a stand-up comedian, has sent out a few mostly cheery tweets from Bellevue Hospital since the incident.</p>

&quot;She&#x2019;s very tired. She&#x2019;s very weak,&#x201D; her mom, Geraldine, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522035325/http://nypost.com/2014/02/14/woman-run-over-by-train-a-comedian-jokes-after-fall/">told the Post</a>. &#x201C;I did not want her to go to New York. She thinks she&#x2019;s invincible.&quot; She&apos;s currently in a neck brace, and could still lose her leg, but is staying positive by all accounts. &quot;Knowing Liza, she&#x2019;ll probably do standup in her bed. I can visualize it. That&#x2019;s her spirit,&quot; her mom said. &quot;I&#x2019;m crying my eyes out and she&#x2019;s cracking jokes.&quot; Her great aunt <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522035325/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/woman-texting-subway-platform-falls-racks-hit-train-article-1.1615324">told the News</a> that she&apos;s &quot;already joking about it.&quot;</p>

<p>Dye, who had been scheduled to perform Friday night at a Valentine&#x2019;s Day show at The Stand in Gramercy Park, is a frequent performer at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre. Her star has certainly been on the rise lately: she was named <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522035325/http://www.thelmagazine.com/newyork/30-under-30-the-young-brooklynites-we-envy-most/Content?oid=2341053&amp;showFullText=true">one of L Magazine&apos;s &quot;30 Under 30&quot;</a> and she was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522035325/http://www.npr.org/2013/11/20/246311451/for-key-and-peele-biracial-roots-bestow-special-comedic-power">name-checked by Key and Peele</a> as someone ready for SNL. </p>
