<p>We don&apos;t think <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160116002340/http://gothamist.com/tags/ghostbusters"><em>Ghostbusters III</em></a> is filming in NYC right now, unless Dan Akroyd has given up on his dreams of a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160116002340/http://www.shortlist.com/entertainment/films/exclusive-dan-aykroyd-talks-ghostbusters-3">JJ Abrams-esque reboot</a> and just started filming his own <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160116002340/http://swededcinema.com/">sweded version.</a> Otherwise, maybe this gentleman in the perfect replica Ghostbusters gear at the 96th Street station got lost on his way to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160116002340/http://instagram.com/p/a5mTEOn_J3/">hang with his bros at the Supanova Expo</a>. Or maybe he&apos;s a lonely Keymaster looking for his flute-playing Gatekeeper.</p>
