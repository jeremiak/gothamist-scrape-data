A new 700-page book makes <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430034759/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/new-espn-book-guys-have-188689">those allegations</a> and much more about the sports network boys club.</p>

<p>&quot;Those Guys Have All the Fun: Inside the World of ESPN,&quot; written by authors James Andrew Miller and Tom Shales&#x2014;who wrote a similarly exhausting account of the behind the scenes world of Saturday Night Live&#x2014;takes an in-depth look at the rise of the sports network giant, with lots of stops along the way for strange anecdotes about the &quot;glorified frat house.&quot; Below are some highlights from the tome, per <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430034759/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/party_jockin_rollin_GNqzTMRZqilioX4jxFCmyL/1">the Post&apos;s preview</a> of the forthcoming book:<br>
</p><ul><br>
	<li>Former ESPN general counsel Andy Brilliant provided many anecdotes to the authors about some of the worst behavior in the early days of the network&#x2014;he said that he and his &quot;entourage&quot; would run amok in their ESPN-owned apartment on 47th Street, with &quot;liquor, drugs, hookers.&quot; Brilliant also talks about his secretary, who was being pimped out of the Manhattan ESPN office by the company&apos;s mailroom guys in order to maintain her coke habit. &quot;<strong>The receptionist was a really good-looking girl, and she was b---ing FedEx guys in the bathroom after work hours,&quot;</strong> Brilliant said.</li><br>
	<li>About those Christmas party &quot;orgies&quot;: &quot;A couple of them were drunken orgies, but who could blame these people in the middle of nowhere? <strong>It became like a big frat party. There were a lot of drugs being done in the bathroom. There was quite a bit of screwing going on afterward, a lot of it extramarital</strong>,&quot; said Brilliant.</li><br>
	<li>&quot;There was a lusty sex life there. There was screwing in the hallways. OK, maybe not in the hallways, but there were a couple of stairwell stories,&quot; said former reporter Sal Marchiano.</li><br>
	<li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430034759/http://gothamist.com/tags/keitholbermann">Keith Olbermann</a> joined the network in 1992 as an anchor for &quot;SportsCenter,&quot; and is credited with helping to make ESPN a household name. But despite being a &quot;genius&quot;, a lot of people hated him.  &quot;I was enraged by Olbermann. Guys like that just piss me off, you know, because there&apos;s no loyalty. It&apos;s just me, me, me,&quot; said ESPN chairman emeritus Herb Granath. When Olbermann left in 1997, many were relieved, including fellow ESPN anchor Bob Ley: &quot;<strong>Our long national nightmare is over, huh? We felt not so much relief when Keith left as unrestrained f--king joy</strong>.&quot;</li><br>
	<li>Recently retired NBC Sports executive Dick Ebersol talked about an incident in 2006, when NFL commentator Sean Salisbury sent pictures of his &quot;junk&quot; from his phone while at a gambling table: &quot;ESPN basically has to have one of their talent talk about Hitler or put a picture of their d--k on a phone -- which is what the Salisbury guy did -- before [they won&apos;t] do anything about any of these various crazies, because they don&apos;t have to. Nobody can touch them.&quot;</li><br>
	<li>They also touch upon the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430034759/http://gothamist.com/tags/stevephillips">ugly 2009 incident</a> involving ESPN baseball analyst and former Mets GM Steve Phillips, who was fired after his affair with a 22-year-old production assistant was revealed: &quot;<strong>ESPN suspending Steve Phillips as a commentator because he&apos;s a married man having an affair with an employee is like going to Harlem and saying we&apos;re going to arrest all black men who cross the street</strong>,&quot; said John Lack, a vice president at ESPN.</li><br>
