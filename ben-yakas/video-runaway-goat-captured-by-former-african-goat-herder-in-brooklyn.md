<p>Considering the fact that the name &quot;Gotham&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150912092535/http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=gotham">derives from Old English for</a> &quot;homestead where goats are kept,&quot; we&apos;re actually surprised we don&apos;t get more incidents like this: a runaway goat was spotted running around Fulton Avenue just before 1 a.m. last night in Bedford-Stuyvesant. As one onlooker <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150912092535/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local/new_york&amp;id=8983689&amp;rss=rss-wabc-article-8983689">told ABC</a>: &#x201C;First, me, I was like, &#x2018;Oh snap, a goat.&#x2019;&#x201D; Check out video below.</p>

<p>&quot;I was just walking across the street to get some Popeye&#x2019;s, I come around the corner and the next thing I know I see a goat coming around my way, galloping toward me,&#x201D; a witness <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150912092535/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2013/02/07/runaway-goat-cornered-in-brooklyn-parking-lot/">told CBS</a>. &#x201C;Banging his head against two doors, to no avail, then it started running &#x2019;cause the cops were after it.&quot; Police were called in by passersby, and the goat was eventually cornered close to Interfaith Medical Center. </p>

<p>At that point, hospital security guard Seydou Ndiaye, who was once a goat herder in West Africa, grabbed a rope, formed a lasso, and tried to corral the animal: &#x201C;I told them &#x2018;Do not harm the animal, it&#x2019;s an easy animal, it&#x2019;s very friendly but it just was a little scared,&#x2019;&#x201D; Ndiaye told CBS. After hiding behind cars and darting from cops, Ndiaye was able to grab him by the horns.</p>

<p>Officers brought the goat to the ASPCA in Manhattan; it&apos;s still unclear where the animal came from. This has been your daily reminder that you&apos;ll never know when you&apos;ll need a goat herder around&#x2014;but one day you will.</p>
