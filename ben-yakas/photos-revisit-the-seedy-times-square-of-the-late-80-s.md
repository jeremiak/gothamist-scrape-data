</div></div>					<p>The tourist-friendly, M&amp;M;&apos;s-shilling pedestrian plaza that is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507080100/http://gothamist.com/tags/timessquare">Times Square</a> in 2014 is a far cry from the porn-addled streets of Times Square circa 1988. While it&apos;s now a veritable safe haven for costumed Disney characters, it was once the land of opportunity for peep show purveyors and two-bit hustlers. Which is exactly what artist <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507080100/http://www.mitchoconnell.com/">Mitch O&apos;Connell</a> loved about it. &quot;Way back in the late &apos;80s, right before 42nd Street was sweep clean and purified with Disney goodness, you could still enjoy the historic New York location in all its noisy, colorful, rude and vivid glory,&quot; he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507080100/http://mitchoconnell.blogspot.com/2013/11/vintage-1980s-snapshots-of-seedy-and.html">writes on his website.</a></p>

<p>Above, you can see some of the snapshots he took of the area throughout the late &apos;80s, when the then-aspiring illustrator would visit NYC trying to sell his work: &quot;I wish I had taken 1000 more photos (and gone back at night) of the amazing buildings and people that could only be found there, but at least I got a handful of snapshots of the long gone cool decaying seediness of that bustling stretch of real estate!&quot;</p>
