<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429060621/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/09/breaking_bad_recap_dont_touch_my_mo.php">Last week</a> on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429060621/http://gothamist.com/tags/breakingbad"><em>Breaking Bad</em></a>, Todd was blinded by science, Walt freaked out, and Hank met the neo-Nazis. This week, Walt had a barrel of laughs, Jesse got chained, and Flynn worked the cash register. Let&apos;s talk about the newest episode, &quot;Ozymandias,&quot; below.</p>

<p><strong>Everything That Could Have Happened Basically Happened:</strong> Before we get into this, let&apos;s just list all the crazy shit that happened:</p>

<ul>
	<li>We flashbacked to the freakin&apos; pilot, just to pour the salt on the wound</li>
	<li>Gomey is dead</li>
	<li>Hank is dead</li>
	<li>Walt tells Jesse about Jane&apos;s death</li>
<li>Walt still <em>really</em> wants Jesse to die</li>
	<li>Skyler and Marie tell Flynn about Walt</li>
	<li>Jesse is a prisoner of the neo-Nazis</li>
<li>Jesse&apos;s face</li>
	<li>Skyler and Walt fought like maniacs over a knife, Flynn called the cops on Walt</li>
	<li>Marie breaks down because Hank is <em>dead</em></li>
<li>The police know, or will soon know, everything</li>
	<li>Walt fully transforms into rage-spouting Heisenberg...except it turns out he was (partially) doing so to protect Skyler from the police </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>That Flashback:</strong> Walt&apos;s still the teacher, Jesse&apos;s still the smartass. &quot;The reaction has begun,&quot; Walt tells Jesse, and sixty episodes later, we&apos;re watching the end result of that reaction... which we guess is a trove of murderous neo-Nazis unleashing heavy artillery on doomed a few outnumbered DEA agents. Once upon a time, a middle-aged man with cancer donned his tighty whities and took control of his life by producing meth&#x2014;it was thrilling for Walt, it was thrilling for the audience, and it is painful now. Hank&apos;s victory has been stolen from him; Jesse won&apos;t get his revenge; Walt won&apos;t have his family; Marie won&apos;t have her husband; Flynn isn&apos;t innocent anymore. Were you pacing around the room more than you were sitting down? I was.</p>

<p><strong>Ozymandias</strong>: We thought the title of this week&apos;s antepenultimate episode was a nod to Walt&apos;s place as the king whose empire lies in ruin, or the watcher who is left to observe the debris. But it was really about the masochistic genius from whose mind this devastating, thrilling episode sprang: </p>

<p>Before the episode, Gilligan humbly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429060621/http://www.tvfanatic.com/2013/09/breaking-bad-exclusive-vince-gilligan-teases-heart-attack-conclu/">told TVFanatic</a>, &quot;I tell ya, this next episode (entitled &#x201C;Ozymandias&#x201D;), I think for my money, is the best episode we ever had had or ever will have.&quot; He really wasn&apos;t joking&#x2014;this was the ABQ edition of the Red Wedding, only with emotional Armageddon instead of dead direwolves. </p>

<p><strong>&quot;You Can Have Any Future That You Want:&quot;</strong> Walt is good at talking his way out of tight tight tight corners&#x2014;sure, sometimes he&apos;s gotten help from legally-savvy junkyard owners, but more often than not he&apos;s relied on his own craftiness. He thinks he&apos;s pretty good at it too. (Remember when he bragged to Skyler in season 5.1 about swaying Jesse back onto his side?) </p>

<p>But he&apos;s too jumbled to realize what a folly it is begging for Hank&apos;s life with Uncle Jack And The Good Time Neo-Nazi Gang. He clings to the notion that they can work this out, if only Hank would listen (a few episodes ago, it was &apos;if only Jesse would listen&apos;). He still thinks money and intellect can help him get out of any situation. Hank gives it to him straight: <strong>&quot;You&apos;re the smartest guy I&apos;ve ever met, and you&apos;re too stupid to see he made up his mind ten minutes ago.&quot;</strong></p>

<p><strong>Hank&apos;s Last Stand:</strong> First there was his cowboy line, &quot;My name is ASAC Schrader, and you can go f**k yourself.&quot; And then, &quot;Do what you&apos;re gonna d...&quot; He lost to Walt in the end, but he carried himself in a way that I think he&apos;d be proud of&#x2014;as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429060621/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/maureen-ryan/breaking-bad-ozymandias_b_3931402.html">Maureen Ryan put it</a>, he had a moral backbone, the kind which Walt can&apos;t recognize anymore.</p>

<p><strong>Parallel Lines On A Slow Decline:</strong> When Walt breaks down on the desert floor after Hank is killed, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429060621/http://i.imgur.com/E60ZhXV.gif">he looks exactly like Gus</a> did when his partner was killed before his eyes by the cartel. Later on, Skyler has the same look on her face after Walt takes Holly.</p>

<p>Then there was Skyler repeatedly asking Walt, &quot;Where is Hank,&quot; just like she asked Hank, &quot;Am I under arrest&quot; and she yelled at Marie to &quot;Stop talking.&quot; There&apos;s also a &quot;Crawl Space&quot;-like shot of Walt&apos;s family getting farther away from him after the brutal knife fight with Skyler and his warped insistence that they were still a family. </p>

<p><strong>Flynn Calls The Cops</strong>: Speaking of which: Walt has always justified his actions as necessary steps toward providing for his family. So it makes a twisted, fitting sense that his son&#x2014;the last person close to Walt who doesn&apos;t know that he is the danger&#x2014;is the one who ultimately calls the police on him. &#x201C;I need the police. My dad&#x2014;he pulled a knife on my mom. He attacked her. He&#x2019;s dangerous. I think he might have killed somebody.&#x201D; That&apos;s gotta kill Walt, especially right after he robotically bellowed, &quot;We&apos;re a family.&quot;</p>

<p>Think about how much information Flynn has had to process over the course of a few hours: his father is a meth kingpin, his uncle is dead, his father may have killed his uncle, his mother was complicit in everything, his father maybe kidnapped his sister, and as far as we can tell, there was no time for any breakfast. </p>

<p><strong>Walt&apos;s Monstrous Compassion:</strong> Walt had two moments: first, when he offers all his cash to the neo-Nazis to save Hank. Then there&apos;s his episode-ending call to Skyler. Some people seemed a little confused about it, because it was confusing. </p>

<p>Walt&apos;s whole &quot;you crossed me&quot; speech was calculated, a way of putting some distance between himself and Skyler to try to protect her. He emphasizes certain phrases (&quot;illegal, immoral&quot;) to take the blame in front of the cops, to make Skyler seem like a prisoner, and ultimately to ensure that Holly has her mama.</p>

<p>This is the hardest thing he can do&#x2014;in his mind, it&apos;s another major sacrifice he has to make for his family, just like cooking meth, killing Gus, and blackmailing Hank were. This is where we hit the gray matter: he tells Skyler she never appreciated his sacrifices, and he means it.</p>

<p>He&apos;s apologizing to Skyler for everything he&apos;s done by being so vicious, by painting her as a victim. At the same time, he&apos;s tapping into deep wells of his own rage (the kind we saw on display when he told Jesse about Jane). Even when he&apos;s doing something selfless, it&apos;s tinged with viciousness and ego. </p>

<p>Just look at the way Walt calls her a &quot;bitch&quot;&#x2014;the only other time he&apos;s sincerely used Jesse&apos;s mantra is when he called Gretchen a &quot;bitch&quot; in season 2, in the midst of a brutal conversation during which Heisenberg crept out in particularly ugly fashion. He said it with the exact same tone this time as well. </p>

<p>I often take it for granted how amazing all the major actors are on the show, but Bryan Cranston and Anna Gunn are especially incredible in this scene, registering so many different levels of self-awareness through their eyes and their silences. They both look like they&apos;ve been punched in the gut at different points.</p>

<p>And there&apos;s a wonderful symmetry in the episode between the flashback scene and this final one. We saw Walt tell Skyler one of his first lies, we saw him excited about his new baby; now we may have seen one of his last lies, and the last time he&apos;ll see Holly.</p>

<p><strong>Won&apos;t Somebody Think Of Huell</strong>: If a Huell falls asleep in a safehouse and Hank and Gomey are both dead, will anyone know to feed him?</p>

<p><strong>The Final Scene Shot For The Show</strong>: According to Aaron Paul, the final scene shot for <em>Breaking Bad</em> was actually tonight&apos;s flashback to Walt and Jesse in the desert. He explained to Rolling Stone:</p>

<blockquote><strong>What was the final day on set like?</strong>

<p>There&#x2019;s a scene in the sixth episode of the final eight that they were saving for the final day. Bryan and I were shooting inside of this thing, and after a take, we heard someone say, outside the doors, &#x201C;That&#x2019;s a wrap.&#x201D; For about a minute, Bryan and I couldn&#x2019;t get the courage to open the door and walk out. When we came out, everyone was crying. I was holding it in, but once I told Bryan how thankful I was to have him next to me for this crazy ride, that&#x2019;s when I broke down. </p></blockquote><p></p>

<p><strong>Next Week:</strong> Something tells us we take our first trip (or at least watch Walt make the decision to head to) New Hampshire, aka the &quot;Granite State,&quot; the name of the penultimate episode. We know from the preview that Jesse is still chained up like a dog, Walt talks to Saul, and Hank is still dead. We also know, thanks to Gilligan, that Walt will get a new pair of glasses.</p>
