<p>If we learned anything from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160822033619/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/17/white_lady_wears_afro_for_enlighten.php">the exploits of afro blogger Michelle Lapidos</a>&#x2014;whose &quot;Before and Afro&quot; site was a unsentimental mix of sincere, racist, and tone-deaf&#x2014;it&apos;s that you can&apos;t just change your black afro to a blonde one and expect everything to be alright. Now, another earnest young white woman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160822033619/http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:0CnqCWWw4owJ:hiremegrantland.com/?p=1446+&amp;cd=2&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us">has written a post chronicling her experiences living in Harlem</a>, &quot;an urban Norman Rockwell painting tucked away next to the Hudson River.&quot; Except this post was taken down in less than two days because of the intense negative reaction it elicited.</p>

<p>With several <em>Sex and The City</em> references at hand, writer Ivy Jacobson described her rationale for moving to Harlem (her roommate chose it) and how she&apos;s learned to love a neighborhood where &quot;there are no women on macrobiotic diets dictating to nannies on the sidewalks.&quot; Lest you miss the point, the post was titled &quot;A Match Made In Harlem: A White Girl Reports From NYC&#x2019;s Legendary Neighborhood.&quot; As with Lapidos, it seems that her excitement over her own narrative blinds her to some of the more offensive throwaway statements she tries to make about &quot;big, black thugs.&quot;</p>

<p>There are uncomfortable cliches: &quot;Women in my neighborhood let their husbands have it in the middle of the street, often wearing tropical-colored get-ups.&quot; And her attempts at humor fall short on several occasions: &quot;From a real estate perspective, the pre-war architecture of my neighborhood is incredible, I don&#x2019;t live in a shoebox and the rent is reasonable. <strong>And from a thug perspective, my address lends me a bit of street cred. The cashier at my bodega says I keep it real</strong>.&quot; One commenter pointed out how she described the &quot;exotic&quot; elements of the neighborhood: </p>

<blockquote>Do you realize you are insulting people of color by comparing them to trinkets, museum pieces, tourist sights for you to behold? ...Don&#x2019;t act like you&#x2019;re some great messiah for moving into some legendary &#x201C;forbidden land.&#x201D; The people there are PERFECTLY happy without your racist input.</blockquote>

<p>You can only see the post <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160822033619/http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:0CnqCWWw4owJ:hiremegrantland.com/?p=1446+&amp;cd=2&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us">as a Google cache</a> right now, because to their credit, the post was taken down from the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160822033619/http://hiremegrantland.com/">Hire Me Grantland</a> website pretty quickly. Site founder <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160822033619/http://hiremegrantland.com/?p=1507">Matt Ford explained</a>:</p>

<blockquote>The article in question was taken down for several reasons. Once frightening comments were made on this site &#x2014; which are moderated for coherence, spam and profanity regardless of the article - and on Twitter, we reached a state of emergency.

<p>HMGL &#x2014; and I personally &#x2014; apologize as sincerely as I humanly can to those who were hurt by this or any piece.</p>

<p>I also apologize deeply and profoundly to the story&#x2019;s author for putting her in a compromising position.</p>

<p>For the record, no one receives any money off this site save for our host, GoDaddy, and WordPress, who I pay out of pocket.</p>

<p>Today has been a very trying day for this website, usually a source of joy to those who work on it and read it. I am quite literally sick to my stomach for any distress caused.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>We&apos;ve contacted Ford for further comment. But don&apos;t walk away thinking <em>everyone</em> hated the post, you can still see on the cache page that the first six comments were overwhelmingly sunny and supportive... and likely all from the writer&apos;s family and friends: &quot;That&#x2019;s my girl scout! Living the dream in NYC! I am so happy and proud of you, Ivy. Former Girl Scout leader of Ivy! Barbara!&quot; Yes, we do feel a little sorry for her and hope she can put this behind her (now that we&apos;ve blogged about it).</p>
