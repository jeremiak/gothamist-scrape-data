Rev. Al Sharpton was joined by the family of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428200249/http://gothamist.com/tags/ericgarner">Eric Garner</a>, the Staten Island man who died after cops put him in a choke hold during an arrest last month, today at his National Action Network headquarters in Harlem. They announced there will be a march across the Verrazano Bridge on August 23rd demanding justice for Garner. In addition, Garner&apos;s mother and family reflected on his death and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428200249/http://gothamist.com/2014/08/01/eric_garners_death_ruled_a_homicide.php">medical examiner&apos;s report</a> that it was a homicide; Garner&apos;s mother, Gwen Carr, said her first words after hearing his death had been ruled a homicide were, &quot;Thank you, Jesus.&quot;</p>

<p>Garner&apos;s family was joined by actress Alfre Woodard, Rev.

<p>For his part, Mayor de Blasio seemed nonplussed by his son being put into the debate: &quot;Dante is a very sophisticated young man, and very knowledgeable,&quot; de Blasio <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428200249/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/rev-al-sharpton-free-drag-dante-de-blasio-raging-debate-race-police-tactics-mayor-friday-article-1.1889312?false">told reporters</a>. &quot;He understands he happens to be in the public eye.
