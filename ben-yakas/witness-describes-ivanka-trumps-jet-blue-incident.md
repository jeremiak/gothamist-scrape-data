<p>Yesterday, a couple <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021063412/http://gothamist.com/2016/12/22/ivanka_trump_jetblue_why_god.php">was kicked off a JetBlue flight</a> before it left JFK after they expressed their displeasure with fellow passengers Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner. Brooklyn lawyer Dan Goldstein and his husband Matthew Lasner, a Hunter College professor, and their child were removed from the San Francisco-bound flight around 10:30 a.m. Thursday. But <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021063412/http://www.tmz.com/2016/12/22/ivanka-trump-flight/">while TMZ</a> and other outlets initially reported that Goldstein was &quot;screaming&quot; and &quot;out of control&quot; when he confronted Trump, at least one eyewitness had a very different take on the incident.</p>

<p>Marc Scheff, who sat in the &quot;next row up from Ivanka,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021063412/https://www.facebook.com/marcscheff/posts/10157953789185430">wrote in a Facebook post</a> that Goldstein did not yell, but was agitated when he realized who else was sitting in coach. </p>

<blockquote>When he got on and saw her, sitting behind me, he said &quot;oh my god. This is a nightmare&quot; and was visibly shaking. He said &quot;they ruin the country now they ruin our flight!&quot; (Context: Boarding and therefore the flight was delayed because they needed to get on first through some other way)

<p>He did not yell. He was also not what I would describe as calm. Agitated for sure. His husband behind him was very calm. His son is adorable and sharply dressed.<br>
When the JetBlue staff went back to speak to the man I overheard Ivanka say to them &quot;I don&apos;t want to make this a thing.&quot; My assessment is that she was happy to let the man take his seat. She handled the situation calmly and with class. Security made the call to remove the man.</p>

<p>And for good reason. The man&apos;s calm husband had tweeted earlier that his husband was &quot;chasing them down to harass them.&quot;</p>

<p>I did not witness his actual removal some rows back. If he screamed, I didn&apos;t hear it.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>Lasner wrote a series of now-deleted tweets before and after the confrontation occurred: In the initial tweet, sent out around 9:15 a.m., he wrote, &quot;Ivanka and Jared at JFK T5, flying commercial. My husband chasing them down to harass them. #banalityofevil.&quot; Then about an hour later, Lasner wrote, &quot;Ivanka and Jared on our flight. My husband expressed displeasure in a calm tone, JetBlue staff overheard, and they kicked us off the plane.&quot; In a final tweet, about 20 minutes after that, he tweeted the photo of Ivanka with the caption, &quot;Ivanka just before @JetBlue kicked us off our flight when a flt attendant overhead my husband expressing displeasure about flying w/ Trumps.&quot;</p>

<p>Personal politics aside, Scheff thought the airline made the right decision to remove the family from the flight: &quot;Honestly, if I was her security I would have made the same call. I don&apos;t  think the man was capable of violence, sure. But I would worry that he would leave his seat or cause a scene in some way. And his husband had tweeted that he planned on doing that.&quot; He added, &quot;I&apos;m less concerned about verbal attacks on Ivanka Trump than I am about the attacks on our civil liberties and institutions by the incoming administration.&quot;</p>

<p>White House press secretary <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021063412/http://nypost.com/2016/12/23/trump-grateful-jetblue-kicked-ivanka-heckler-off-plane/">Sean Spicer told NBC</a> that the President-elect was &quot;obviously disappointed but he&#x2019;s proud that JetBlue took the appropriate action.&quot; In another interview, he called the incident harassment and &quot;un-American,&quot; adding, &quot;Ivanka is the epitome of class and grace. And I think she exhibited that yesterday. This individual &#x2026; put out a tweet that he wanted to go and harass her. And JetBlue made the right call by doing that. But Ivanka and Jared and the kids were trying to enjoy a private moment.&quot;</p>

<p>After they arrived in San Francisco, the Trump-Kushner clan then boarded a private jet to Hawaii; it&apos;s unclear why they weren&apos;t flying a private jet to begin with. For what it&apos;s worth, in a rare show of local tabloid unity, both <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021063412/http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/no-fly-zone-treat-trump-family-respect-due-article-1.2920670">the Daily News</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021063412/http://nypost.com/2016/12/22/fellow-passenger-is-glad-jetblue-booted-agitated-ivanka-heckler/">NY Post</a> were in agreement that Goldstein should have been removed for the plane outburst.</p>
