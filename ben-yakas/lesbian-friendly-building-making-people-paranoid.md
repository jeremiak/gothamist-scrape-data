<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="103110lopez.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412163812im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/103110lopez.jpg" width="180" height="411" class="image-left"> </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412163812/http://gothamist.com/2010/10/30/new_yorkers_head_to_some_rally_in_d.php">Yesterday</a> at the Rally To Restore Sanity and/or Fear, attendees were treated to several collage-like montages of media talking heads listing all the things we need to be afraid of, including flip flop, bedbugs and hurricanes. There&apos;s one new thing to add to that list: conspiratorial lesbian-controlled low-rent apartment buildings! </p>

<p>According to Roberto Caballero, a former Lower East Side Democratic district leader, a seven-unit building on East 11th Street near Avenue B has tacitly become a lesbian-only building, favored by well-to-do lesbians such as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412163812/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margarita_L%C3%B3pez">Margarita Lopez</a>, the $187,000-per-year Housing Authority board member and one-time city councilwoman, and Rosie Mendez, a current councilwoman (and Lopez&apos;s protege). &quot;<strong>I find it strange that no man has ever moved in. I would consider that a form of discrimination</strong>,&quot; Caballero, who is &quot;openly gay,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412163812/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/city_officials_among_gal_only_tenants_JIWPNImAB6ZrmNBKIHA8LN">told the Post</a>. Maybe what&apos;s angering Caballero the most is the fact that units sell for an astoundingly low $250 apiece, plus capital improvement fees (and with the rule that apartments can&apos;t be sold for profit). More than half the building&apos;s 12 tenants are reportedly lesbians (does the Post know this because they all play <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412163812/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/13/is_softball_gay.php">softball</a>?), and Lopez admits that new tenants tend to be friends-of-friends: &quot;the apartments are not marketed. It&apos;s through word of mouth to the people we know in the community.&quot;</p>

<p>The building in question was once owned by the city, but was given away for very little in 1989 at a time when the neighborhood was overrun by junkies and drug dealers. Lopez and five other women renovated the gutted building, in return for $630,000 in building funds&#x2014;most of it in the form of charity and taxpayer grants and loans. Initially, residents had to qualify as low-income, but once they&apos;re accepted, they&apos;re in for life, even if they start making more money. Just like membership in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412163812/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay_Mafia">Lavender Mafia</a>.</p>
