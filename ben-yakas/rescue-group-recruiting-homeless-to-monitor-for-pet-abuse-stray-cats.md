<p>Based on our experience dealing with various groups, most animal rescue organizations in the city are doing their best to help abused and neglected pets with incredibly limited resources&#x2014;they can&apos;t be everywhere at once, as much as they&apos;d like to be. But the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130114084101/http://guardiansofrescue.org/">Guardians of Rescue</a> have realized there is one segment of the city&apos;s population that is generally on the streets at all hours: the homeless. And they&apos;ve begun recruiting homeless people to help monitor for pet abuse and guard <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130114084101/http://gothamist.com/tags/cats">cat</a> traps.</p>

<p>&#x201C;In the middle of The Bronx, I wouldn&#x2019;t want a regular volunteer staying out until 4 a.m.,&#x201D; explained Robert Misseri, the group&#x2019;s president, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130114084101/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/it_lady_and_the_tramp_FvsurQ4xBYlB4Nz2y1SXyO">to the Post</a>. &#x201C;If I have a 70-year-old volunteer set a trap, I don&#x2019;t want her out all night watching it.&#x201D; But he reasons that homeless people &quot;will be up anyway. The homeless are always on the streets, and wherever there are stray people, there are stray animals.&#x201D; So the group has started The BARTER (Bringing Animal Rescue to Every Resource) initiative&#x2014;homeless people get rewards for helping the groups.</p>

<p>Those rewards include gift cards to places like Subway and clothing donations; in exchange for guarding a kitty cage all night, they&apos;d get a $25 gift card, plus an additional $25 card if a cat is nabbed. Any homeless people that can bring information on animal abusers can get up to $500 in gift cards. &#x201C;They are our eyes and ears,&#x201D; Misseri said, noting they are especially helpful at identifying people selling puppies on street corners in &#x201C;marginalized sections of Manhattan.&#x201D;</p>

<p>&#x201C;A lot of us on our own would want to become involved, but getting food for it is a bonus,&#x201D; 22-year-old homeless man Gregory Beylin, who has been living on the street for about four years, told the Post. &#x201C;It gives people a reward.&#x201D; </p>

<p>That&apos;s not the only new stray kitty initiative going on: feral cats in Washington Heights can now ditch the styrofoam boxes and hang out <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130114084101/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/uptown/city-kitty-high-rise-pops-washington-heights-article-1.1238502">at a five-story &#x201C;Kitty High Rise&#x201D;</a> at the Morris-Jumel Community Garden in the neighborhood. It&apos;s one of eight locations that have been chosen for the innovative outdoor shelters.
