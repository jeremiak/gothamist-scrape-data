Walter Sumpter was found with a gunshot wound to the chest outside 254 W. 154th St. just after midnight Friday. The shooting took place outside his girlfriend&apos;s 17th birthday party at a local community center: &#x201C;It all took place outside. The girl wasn&#x2019;t there, but it looks like a friend of the gunman called him and told him [Sumpter] was there,&#x201D; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120104090010/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/rival-beau-kills-girlfriend-man-17th-birthday-party-cops-article-1.999162?localLinksEnabled=false">a source told the News.</a><p></p>

<p>The community hall doesn&apos;t allow alcohol, and patted down the approximately 25 party attendees before they entered. One witness described hearing the gunshots <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120104090010/http://gamma.dnainfo.com/20111230/harlem/teen-shot-killed-harlem">to DNAInfo</a>: &quot;I was busy ducking. There are things happening that you don&apos;t want to see.&quot; Friends and family gathered Friday afternoon to put up a memorial to Sumpter outside the Police Athletic League&apos;s Harlem Center near his home on Morningside Avenue and West 119th Street: &#x201C;He was a boy that loved to make everybody laugh, no matter what,&#x201D; a 16-year-old girl, whose cousin was Sumpter&#x2019;s best friend, told the News. &#x201C;My cousin and I are bawling in tears right now. &#x201D;</p>

<p>Ruqqiyah Husam, program manager for the Police Academy League center, said Sumpter, whose nickname was &quot;Reck,&quot; was a regular attendee of the night program three days per week, playing basketball, using computer center and game room and participating in job readiness programs. &quot;He was well-mannered and a jokester. He had a lot of personality and wasn&apos;t disrespectful,&quot; she told DNAInfo.</p>
