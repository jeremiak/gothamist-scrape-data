<p>The jury is still out on whether Philadelphia <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429183645/http://gothamist.com/tags/sixthborough">is really the 6th borough or not</a>, but there&apos;s no doubt that we love <em>It&apos;s Always Sunny In Philadelphia</em>&#x2014;and judging by the reaction to news this week of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429183645/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/07/finally_a_beer_brewed_just_for_alwa.php">Dayman Coffee IPA</a>, it seems you love the show too. So we&apos;d be remiss in not pointing out that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429183645/https://twitter.com/MacwellMcDonald">a very dedicated <em>Sunny</em> fan</a> has mapped out all the Philly-area locations used in the show. Creator and star Rob McElhenney <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429183645/https://twitter.com/RMcElhenney/status/289170300111831041">took notice</a>: &quot;This is insane. How long did this take to do?&quot;</p>

<p>These online maps are certainly a lot easier to understand than any of the maps <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429183645/http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x7mjwj_it-s-always-sunny-in-philadelphia-t_fun">the gang has come up with over the years.</a> One caveat: if you&apos;re looking for the actual Paddy&apos;s Pub, you&apos;ll have to travel a lot farther to find it. In reality, the gang&apos;s bar is located at 548 Mateo Street in Los Angeles, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429183645/http://virtualglobetrotting.com/map/its-always-sunny-in-philadelphia-bar/view/?service=0">as you can see here.</a> </p>

<p>If you&apos;re looking for more real life <em>Sunny</em> products, there&apos;s lots of gold over at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429183645/http://www.dicktowel.com/dicktowel.html">DickTowel.com</a>, though they are surprisingly lacking in Fat Mac Hawaiian shirts. We really won&apos;t be satisfied until we can get our very own kitten mittens&#x2014;the perfect solution if your cat makes TOO MUCH NOISE and is constantly STOMPING AROUND ALL THE TIME.</p>
