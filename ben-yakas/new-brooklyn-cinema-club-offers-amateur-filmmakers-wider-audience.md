										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="51411cinemaclub.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408152428im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/51411cinemaclub.jpg" width="220" height="310" class="image-left"> </span>Have you ever asked yourself, &quot;Why can&apos;t cinema events be a little more like concerts?&quot; A new film screening series based in Williamsburg certainly did, and if you&apos;re a small-time filmmaker, or just a cinephile who&apos;s a little tired of the indie film circuit, then the &quot;club&quot; may be right up your alley.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408152428/http://www.cinemaclub.us/">Cinema Club</a> approaches film screenings as if they were putting on a concert: they pair a headliner, an influential and likely well-known film, with a submission based &quot;amateur&quot; opening act. There&apos;s no charge to submit, and anyone can submit any content for consideration. Tonight is their first double screening at indieScreen, a bar and movie theater next to Glasslands on Kent Ave in Williamsburg. </p>

<p>For the inaugural screening, they&apos;ll be showing <em>Nothing Yet</em>, a music industry-related film &quot;made by a couple of kids from Ridgewood,&quot; as the opener at 8:30 p.m., and classic black-and-white mockumentary <em>Man Bites Dog</em> at 10:30 p.m., a must-see French film about a charismatic, chatty serial killer. Each individual movie is $6, or $10 for the double feature. You can check out more info on how to submit <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408152428/http://www.cinemaclub.us/submissions.html">here</a>, and buy tickets <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408152428/http://www.cinemaclub.us/">here</a>. Hopefully they&apos;ll be able to resist the lure of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408152428/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Serbian_Film">Serbian snuff films</a> for future screenings. </p>
