<p>This week marks the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160912081713/http://espn.go.com/new-york/nfl/story/_/id/9078984/tim-tebow-new-york-jets-deal-hits-one-year-anniversary">one year anniversary</a> of the Jets making the fateful decision to trade for part-time quarterback/full-time proselytizer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160912081713/http://gothamist.com/tags/timtebow">Tim Tebow</a>.

Below, we&apos;ve compiled a list of the biggest highlights from Tebow&apos;s first year with the team. Here&apos;s to many, many more!</p>
