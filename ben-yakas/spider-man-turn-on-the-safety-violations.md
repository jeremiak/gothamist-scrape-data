<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508000835/http://gothamist.com/tags/spider-man:turnoffthedark"><em>Spider-Man: Turn Off The Dark</em></a> <strike>shitshow</strike> marketing nightmare just keeps racking up wins: the much-maligned musical <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508000835/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/13/nyregion/13spiderman.html?_r=1&amp;partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">has been hit</a> with two safety violations from the New York State Department of Labor over the accidents that have befallen the cursed production.
