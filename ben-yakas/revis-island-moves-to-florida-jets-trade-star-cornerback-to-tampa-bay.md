<p>For months, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130527061533/http://gothamist.com/tags/jets">the Jets</a> have been locked in a staring contest with star cornerback <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130527061533/http://gothamist.com/2010/01/22/manhattan_re-named_revis_island.php#photo-1">Darelle Revis</a> over contract negotiations. Today, it seems the situation has finally be resolved the way everybody thought it would go: the Jets have agreed in principal to send Revis to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, pending a physical. And with the Jets set to open their season at home against Tampa Bay, it sets up the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130527061533/https://twitter.com/MySportsLegion/status/326023894882455554">likely scenario</a> of Mark Sanchez throwing a touchdown <em>to</em> Revis.</p>

<p>&#x201C;There&#x2019;s a .001 chance this deal doesn&#x2019;t happen, so I don&#x2019;t want to say it&#x2019;s done,&#x201D; one source <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130527061533/http://sports.yahoo.com/news/nfl--sources--jets-have-agreement-in-principle-to-trade-darrelle-revis-to-bucs-150815922.html">told Yahoo</a>. &#x201C;There&#x2019;s always a chance something could go wrong, but it&#x2019;s unlikely.&#x201D; Revis has been seeking a deal worth in the range of $15 million to $16 million per year, something the Jets&#x2014;who are entering rebuilding mode&#x2014;weren&apos;t willing to meet. The Daily News says the Jets already <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130527061533/http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/football/jets/myers-revis-jets-rebuild-lacks-foundation-article-1.1323402">look like an expansion team.</a></p>

<p>The Jets will receive multiple draft picks, including the 13th overall choice, from the Buccaneers assuming Revis passes his physical, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130527061533/http://espn.go.com/new-york/nfl/story/_/id/9195939/new-york-jets-trade-darrelle-revis-tampa-bay-buccaneers-pending-physical-source">ESPN reports</a>. This means that the Jets, who already have the ninth pick, will be in place to pick up two quality players. Or, in typical Jets fashion, they&apos;ll probably trade both picks away before the draft for, oh, maybe some signed Peyton Manning football cards, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130527061533/http://kissingsuzykolber.uproxx.com/2009/11/coach-ryan-brings-in-the-jaguar.html">an actual jaguar</a>, and the rights to Tim Tebow&apos;s life story.</p>
