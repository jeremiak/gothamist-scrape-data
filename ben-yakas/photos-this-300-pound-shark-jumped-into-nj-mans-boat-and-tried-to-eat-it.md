<p>Besides those occasions when we <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717104339/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/11/man_spotted_selling_live_shark_on_t.php">buy one on the subway</a>, we rarely are anywhere where we could come face-to-face with a shark. NJ angler <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717104339/https://www.facebook.com/trrostron">Tom Rostron, Jr.</a> is someone who actively seeks out sharks, but even he thought it was too early in the season for any real action when he went scouting with a friend this week on the Manasquan River. That is until a 303-pound, 8-foot, 4-inch mako shark leapt into the bow of his 31-foot boat...and tried to eat the boat.</p>

<p>&#x201C;It was epic. He back flipped right in,&#x201D; said Clint Simek, who was out with Rostron on the boat off of the Jersey coast Tuesday. They were scouting optimal fishing spots for a series of three upcoming fishing tournaments, one of which has a grand prize of $25K. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s real early in the season for sharks. Usually you don&#x2019;t go shark fishing with only two guys in a boat,&#x201D; Rostron <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717104339/http://www.app.com/article/20130607/NJSPORTS06/306070012/Fishermen-show-boat-damaged-by-mako-shark?nclick_check=1">told Asbury Park Press</a>. &#x201C;But Clint and I wanted to pre-fish the tournaments. <strong>We had no intentions of boating the biggest fish we ever have.</strong>&#x201D;</p>

<p>&#x201C;At first we were in shock when he was in the boat. Then he started thrashing and we were like &#x2018;Oh My God, we have a big problem, this thing is going to eat us,&#x2019; &#x201D; Rostron added, saying wood and Fiberglass filled the air as the shark smashed with his tail and bit with its mouth. &#x201C;He just chomped it all up,&#x201D; he said. This mako was the first caught inshore this season as far as Rostron knows. &#x201C;Pretty amazing. Probably never going to happen again in our lives,&#x201D; Rostron said. <br>
