<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506173219/http://gothamist.com/tags/knicks">The Knicks</a> keep finding new creative and boneheaded ways to lose basketball games: last night, Tyson Chandler reverse-dunked on his own head as the Knicks lost to the woeful Orlando Magic in double overtime. It&apos;s understandable that fans are frustrated by this lost season&#x2014;but one fan took things a bit too far by making threats at the world&apos;s #1 Eagles aficionado <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506173219/http://gothamist.com/tags/jamesdolan">James Dolan</a> on Twitter.</p>

<p>&quot;James Dolan, it&#x2019;s officially time to die,&#x201D; 19-year-old Johnny Giamella, son of a NYC cop, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506173219/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/teen-threatens-knicks-owner-james-dolan-officials-article-1.1654749">allegedly tweeted</a>. &quot;Death to James Dolan,&quot; he alleged tweeted afterwards. Giamella also allegedly posted pictures of himself holding a gun to the camera and a sharp metal object to his neck. The criminal complaint adds that Giamella tweeted a naked photo of himself holding a gun over his penis.</p>

<p>Giamella has been charged with harassment. Dolan takes things like this very seriously, according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506173219/https://twitter.com/DMArtestQB">Daniel Artest</a>, brother of Metta World Peace. Peace announced last night on Twitter that his agent was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506173219/http://espn.go.com/new-york/nba/story/_/id/10501351/new-york-knicks-buy-metta-world-peace-beno-urdih">working on a buyout</a> with the Knicks after barely playing this season. His brother then went on a Twitter tirade about the Knicks organization, and in particular, Dolan&apos;s paranoia about the media and obsession with what Artest was tweeting.</p>

<p>Artest has deleted most of his tweets about the &quot;trash organization&quot; at this point (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506173219/http://www.sportingnews.com/nba/story/2014-02-22/metta-world-peace-ron-artest-daniel-artest-knicks-woodson-management-fans-">Sporting News has some screenshots though!</a>), but Daily News&apos; Knicks beat writer Frank Isola captured the tone (and some of his tweets) as well:</p>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>I might Fire my agent and sign with CAA sports agency.

The coaching staff , front office n some of the players are signed with CAA.

<p>Oh yeah: Beno Udrih is also trying to arrange a buyout with the team. Which means there will soon be two open spots on the roster&#x2014;could this mean we&apos;ll soon see <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506173219/http://grantland.com/the-triangle/chris-smith-and-the-new-york-knicks-conspiracy/">the return of the chosen one to MSG?</a></p>
