<p>After regaling us with stories of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150409201648/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/24/video_tom_hanks_performs_full_house.php">texting with <strike>Bruce</strike> BROOOOOOCE Springsteen and performing slam poetry about <em>Full House</em></a>, America&apos;s Most Beloved Thespian Tom Hanks showed up on <em>The Colbert Report</em> last night&#x2014;not to promote his new movie <em>Cloud Atlas</em>, but to show off some awesome costume ideas, including Oscar-denied heroes, Fed Ex employees, other classic Hanks characters, and...Matt Damon. &quot;My career speaks for itself,&quot; Hanks reminded viewers, &quot;and is available on DVD and Blu-Ray! You know, it makes a great sugar-free alternative to Halloween candy, what with America&apos;s childhood obesity epidemic.&quot; Watch below.</p>

<p>Colbert&apos;s hero, Bill O&apos;Reilly, refused to jump into the fray after Colbert&apos;s brilliant bit about Indiana Senate candidate Richard Mourdock (see below) and his rape comments: &#x201C;Fellas, you may not be aware of this, but in 1920, women got the right to vote...If you&apos;re about to talk about rape, stab yourself in the eye with a pencil!&quot; But <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150409201648/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/bill-oreilly-colbert-stewart-mourdock-383351">he did comment</a> about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150409201648/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/stephen-colberts-playboy-interview-super-381970">Colbert revealing that he got some supportive advice from him</a> when he was just starting out: &quot;I don&#x2019;t even remember giving him that advice....I thought the advice I gave Colbert was &#x2018;get out of the business.&#x2019; I think that&#x2019;s what I told him. He didn&#x2019;t take it.&quot;</p>
