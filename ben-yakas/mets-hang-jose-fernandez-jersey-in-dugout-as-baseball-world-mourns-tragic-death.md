<p>Miami Marlins pitcher Jos&#xE9; Fern&#xE1;ndez, one of the best young pitchers in the league, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110093937/http://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/17632541/miami-marlins-ace-jose-fernandez-dies-boating-accident">was killed</a> in a boating accident early this morning, and all of the baseball world has been mourning and paying tribute to him today. Mets star Yoenis Cespedes, who emigrated from Cuba like Fern&#xE1;ndez, hung up a No. 16 Fern&#xE1;ndez jersey before today&apos;s game against the Philadelphia Phillies.</p>

<p>While Cespedes asked not to speak to reporters before the game, several other Mets players <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110093937/http://nypost.com/2016/09/25/cespedes-moving-tribute-as-mets-mourn-jose-fernandez/">spoke about the death</a> of the 24-year-old pitcher: &quot;On behalf of the Mets organization and certainly all of the players and coaches, we&#x2019;re all saddened by the news. This is not only one of the greatest pitchers in the modern game, but one of the finest young men you&#x2019;d ever meet,&quot; manager Terry Collins, who named Fern&#xE1;ndez to the NL All-Star team this season, said.</p>

<p>The Mets are set to play the Marlins in a three game series starting Monday: &quot;It&#x2019;ll be hard for all of baseball,&quot; Collins said of Monday. &quot;I certainly understand the Marlins&#x2019; situation tomorrow will be very hard. It&#x2019;s going to be a tough night for everybody. But we&#x2019;ll get through because we have to...Everybody that&#x2019;s ever played the game knows it has to go on. But it&#x2019;s going to be a tough night for a lot of people, Jose [Reyes] probably more than anybody because he played with and knows him probably better than anybody. [It&apos;s] one of those games that I&#x2019;m not sure we look forward to playing.&quot;</p>

<p>Fern&#xE1;ndez and two friends were on a 32-foot boat off of Miami Beach <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110093937/http://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/17632541/miami-marlins-ace-jose-fernandez-dies-boating-accident">when the incident happened</a> early Sunday morning. The Coast Guard found the boat overturned after 3 a.m. today; all three people were killed, with two of the victims found under the boat, and a third found in the water. None were wearing life jackets. The Coast Guard added that alcohol and drugs did not immediately appear to have played a role in the accident, and Fern&#xE1;ndez was not driving the boat (which did not belong to him).</p>

<p>&quot;All of baseball is shocked and saddened by the sudden passing of Miami Marlins pitcher Jos&#xE9; Fern&#xE1;ndez,&quot; Major League Baseball commissioner Rob Manfred said in a statement. &quot;He was one of our game&apos;s great young stars who made a dramatic impact on and off the field since his debut in 2013. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family, the Miami Marlins organization and all of the people he touched in his life.&quot;</p>

<p>Fern&#xE1;ndez was named National League Rookie of the Year in 2013 (he made his major league debut against the Mets), and was a two-time All-Star during his injury-interrupted four season career. Despite that, he was frequently hailed as the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110093937/http://www.slate.com/articles/sports/sports_nut/2016/09/marlins_pitcher_jose_fernandez_was_the_future_of_baseball.html">future of baseball</a>.

Three times he was intercepted by the Coast Guard, sent back and imprisoned. On the fourth time he made it to Mexico, but not before his mother fell overboard, and the 15-year-old Fernandez dove in to the surging waves to save her life.&quot;</p>

<p>He was reunited with his grandmother, who stayed in Cuba after he left, during the 2014 season opener, when she saw him pitch for the first time since he left the country at age 15.</p>
