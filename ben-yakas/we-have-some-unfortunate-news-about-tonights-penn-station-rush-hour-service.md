<p>&quot;Amtrak has advised us that the repairs to damaged track will take a matter of days, unfortunately,&quot; LIRR President Patrick Nowakowski said in a statement. &quot;Because of that, we must continue to operate on a reduced schedule until all repairs have been safely completed. We have offered support and any assistance they need to help speed these repairs.&quot;</p>
