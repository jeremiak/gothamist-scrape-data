<p>It&apos;s been way too long since we&apos;ve heard an obscure Kinks song in a movie&#x2014;but thankfully, director <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501175501/http://gothamist.com/tags/wesanderson">Wes Anderson</a> is back to (hopefully) fill that hole in our life. Below, you can see the trailer for his latest film, <em>The Grand Budapest Hotel</em>. It looks much more comical and slapstick than his emotional recent works, the trailer picking up the rhythm of the frantic lightning sequence from <em>Moonrise Kingdom</em>. And there are lots of mustaches!</p>

<p>And of course, it&apos;s got an all-star cast headed by Anderson newcomers Ralph Fiennes and Tony Revolori. There are also appearances by Anderson regulars like Edward Norton, Adrien Brody, Willem Dafoe, Jeff Goldblum, Jason Schwartzman, Tilda Swinton, Bill Murray, and Owen Wilson. The film will be released in March 2014.</p>
