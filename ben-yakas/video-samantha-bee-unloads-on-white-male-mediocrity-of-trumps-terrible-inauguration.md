<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170925130752/http://gothamist.com/tags/samanthabee">Samantha Bee</a> hasn&apos;t been on air since the very busy weekend in Washington, so she jumped right into the inauguration and the machinations of our idiot president last night on <em>Full Frontal</em>. &quot;Friday, the world watched America swear in, as its 45th president, the concept of white-male mediocrity,&quot; she started. &quot;Oh yeah, it really happened&#x2014;Donald Trump laid his little pussy-grabbing paw on top of two more books than he&apos;s ever read in his life and spoke the most solemn vow he&apos;s uttered since his third wedding.&quot;</p>

<p>Calling the inauguration a surreal and terrifying affair, she had some particularly harsh words for &quot;Goldman Sachs Wormtongue&quot; Steve Bannon, who has been filling Trump&apos;s mouth &quot;with more Nazi code than Enigma. Are you the only 70-year-old man in America who doesn&apos;t watch The History Channel?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;President Trump delivered his pet frog&#x2019;s &#x2018;Morning in Dystopia&#x2019; speech to a mall that had more empty white space than the Republican plan to replace Obamacare,&quot; she added. At least the pre-inauguration concert was &#x201C;surreal and fucking hilarious...Trump&#x2019;s concert was like his cabinet. Male, overwhelmingly white, and devoid of any A-list talent.&quot; Watch it below.</p>

<p>In the next segment, Bee moved onto Trump&apos;s post-inauguration bout of presidential insanity, complaining about crowd sizes and how the Women&apos;s Marchers hurt his feelings. She then turned things over to Milk, featuring the GW Sirens and Capital Blend, singing a protest song.</p>

<p>And in the other major segment, Bee sent correspondents to the inauguration to create a Werner Herzog-esque documentary about the lukewarm festivities. </p>
