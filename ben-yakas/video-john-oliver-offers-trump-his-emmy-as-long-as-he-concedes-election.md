<p>Donald Trump has been acting like an oversized orange brat on an extended temper tantrum for most of this election season, so it&apos;s only fair that we treat him like a child. To that end, John Oliver has something which Donald Trump desperately wants: a real honest-to-goodness Emmy award. And he&apos;ll even give it to him...as long as he concedes the election on November 8th like a good little member of a functional Democracy.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Oliver can&apos;t understand how Trump bombed so hard at the Al Smith dinner last week: &quot;Of all the negative things you could, should, and are morally-obligated to say about Trump, being unentertaining is not one of them,&quot; Oliver said. &quot;This wasn&apos;t a town hall or a debate, this was a $3,000-a-plate fundraising gala at a moth-eaten Manhattan hotel organized by the Catholic Church, a real estate owning, male-dominated, sex scandal-plagued organization with whom Trump obviously shares a uniquely unqualified interior decorator.&quot; Losing the white bow tie crowd is bad, but bombing with Henry Kissinger, the world&apos;s leading authority on horrific bombing, is just SAD.</p>

<p>In the longer segment, Oliver dived into the extent and root of the country&apos;s epidemic of opioid addiction, ripping into the pharmaceutical industry for decades of deceptive practices that he said got Americans hooked on drugs. </p>
