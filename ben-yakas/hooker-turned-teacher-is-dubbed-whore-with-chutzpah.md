                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:240px; "> <img alt="21110petro.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20140216055200im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/21110petro.jpg" width="240" height="196"> <br> <i>Melissa Petro</i></div> <p></p>

<p>Yesterday, the Bronx public school teacher who resigned from teaching after her writings about working as a Craigslist sex worker got her on the front page of every local rag <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140216055200/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/10/hooker-turned-teacher_now_repped_by.php">hitched her wagon</a> to notorious celebrity lawyer Gloria Allred. But we couldn&apos;t figure out <em>why</em> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140216055200/http://gothamist.com/tags/melissapetro">Melissa Petro</a> did, especially since she had already agreed not to sue the Board of Education or the city. But it turns out she has more civic concerns in mind: she <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140216055200/http://www.amny.com/urbanite-1.812039/controversial-teacher-to-start-program-for-at-risk-kids-1.2677567">told reporters</a> yesterday that she was developing a creative writing program for teens at risk for sexual exploitation. But our favorite Post columnist wasn&apos;t so charmed by her announcement: &quot;This is one whore with chutzpah,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140216055200/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/idiot_prosti_teacher_didn_learn_8EAtuBny1YT3vDdgGHfe4M?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">wrote</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140216055200/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/06/wal-mart_1.php">Walmart-loving</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140216055200/http://gothamist.com/2010/08/30/nyc_andrea_peyser_wants_to_kill_you.php">geese-hating</a> Andrea Peyser.</p>

<p>After months of silence, trapped in one of the city&apos;s rubber rooms, Petro <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140216055200/http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-504083_162-20031489-504083.html">defended herself</a> and her writings to reporters at the news conference: &quot;My writing existed long before I was teaching. I write for adults, I write on sites that speak to adults, I don&apos;t think my students could comprehend my work - and if they did, they deserve an A,&quot; she said. Although, err, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140216055200/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/idiot_prosti_teacher_didn_learn_8EAtuBny1YT3vDdgGHfe4M?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">Peyser disagrees</a> with her assessment of her former students: &quot;[she] thinks her Bronx art students are too dumb to understand Petro&apos;s written ravings about her career as a proud and empowered slut.&quot; Peyser goes to town on Petro, mocking her &quot;brown sky-high platform do-me pumps,&quot; calling her &quot;clueless,&quot; and pointing out her &quot;high-pitched, little-girl lisp&quot; while cackling <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140216055200/http://nelsonhaha.com/">&quot;ha ha.&quot;</a> </p>

<p>And she is especially incredulous that Petro could be teaching children again: &quot;Petro announced&#x2014;get this&#x2014;that she&apos;s reinventing herself as a crusader for &quot;social justice&quot; and plans to work with teens at risk for sexual exploitation. Holy cow! This woman is allowed to get her hands on more kids?&quot; Ahh Peyser: whether you&apos;re giving Rudy Giuliani <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140216055200/http://gothamist.com/2010/08/09/andrea_peyser_gives_rudy_giuliani_p.php">parenting advice</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140216055200/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/item_YZeK9UiloG21oenXvcRWgM;jsessionid=C22AEFBBFA7E2AFF634B79E2FDAB1D38">fetishizing</a> long legs, never stop your crazy.</p>
