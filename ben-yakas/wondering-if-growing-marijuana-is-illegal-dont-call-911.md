<p>Who among us hasn&apos;t thought they could get away with growing one measly marijuana plant for personal usage in their home? Now, who among us has had to urge to call 911 to ask if growing marijuana is <em>really</em> illegal? In this case, 21-year-old marijuana enthusiast Robert Michelson, of Farmington, Ct, suffers for all our sins. As <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170405063617/http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2011/02/pothead_arrested_for_asking_a.html?mid=twitter_DailyIntel">Daily Intel</a> writes, Michelson was interested in growing his own plants&#x2014;he even bought all the seeds and materials needed for it online. But something was itching at him still. So <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170405063617/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/41427345/ns/local_news-hartford_ct/">he called</a> 911. The phone conversation that ensued is presented to you below without commentary; suffice to say, police showed up at his house shortly after the call, he was charged with possession, and he&apos;s now out on $5,000 bail:</p>
