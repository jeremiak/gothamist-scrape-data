<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170914133437/http://gothamist.com/tags/stephencolbert">Stephen Colbert</a> has full confidence in the legislators who are trying to pass the new Obamacare Lite bill (a.k.a. Trumpcare), and doesn&apos;t understand why you don&apos;t feel confident: &quot;So, if you&apos;re worried about losing your healthcare, do not worry. It&apos;s safely in the hands of the guy Googling, &apos;why don&apos;t we tax the sun?&apos;&quot;</p>

<p>But if Republicans really hate the new healthcare bill so much, Trump at least has a rock solid backup plan: let Obamacare fail and blame the Democrats. &quot;Okay, hold on there, chief,&quot; Colbert said. &quot;You&apos;re in charge now. If you let health care collapse, I don&apos;t think we&apos;ll blame the Democrats, we will blame you. That&apos;s like a firefighter letting a house burn down to make the space heater look bad.&quot;</p>

<p>As for the controversy over what to call the bill, he noted that the White House has asked people not to call it Trumpcare, because apparently anything with the suffix -care will be viewed unfavorably by conservatives. &quot;That&apos;s important, because conservatives don&apos;t want to be associated with caring,&quot; Colbert said. &quot;Or, maybe Trump doesn&apos;t want to attach his name to something that no one likes...although that has never stopped him before.&quot; </p>

<p>As for how Trump might ultimately win conservatives over, Colbert added, &quot;He has invited them to strike a deal over a few frames at the White House bowling alley. Yeah, Trump wants to be there as the Republicans throw their balls away.&quot;</p>

<p>And over on The Daily Show, Trevor Noah and Jordan Klepper sang a little ditty for Trump&apos;s &quot;forgotten man.&quot;</p>
