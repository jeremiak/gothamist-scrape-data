<p>Over the last couple of months, we&apos;ve become huge fans of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150527004726/https://twitter.com/Cmdr_Hadfield">Chris Hadfield</a>, the Canadian astronaut who has been in command of the International Space Station since last winter. He&apos;s taken some absolutely <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150527004726/http://gothamist.com/tags/chrishadfield">amazing photos of NYC</a> from space, shown us what happens when you <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150527004726/http://now.msn.com/chris-hadfield-astronaut-cries-in-space-to-show-tears-dont-fall">cry in zero gravity</a>, and even sung a duet <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150527004726/http://www.slate.com/blogs/bad_astronomy/2013/02/10/orbital_duet_astronaut_chris_hadfield_sings_a_duet_with_bare_naked_ladies.html">with one of the dudes from Barenaked Ladies</a>. Hadfield is heading back to Earth today, but he came up with the perfect farewell video: below, watch as Hadfield covers David Bowie&apos;s seminal &quot;Space Oddity&quot; in outer space. He&apos;s literally floating in the most peculiar way&#x2014;and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150527004726/https://twitter.com/DavidBowieReal">the real Bowie approves</a>!</p>
