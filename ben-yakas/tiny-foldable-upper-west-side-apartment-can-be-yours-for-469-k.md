<p>Are you sick and tired of your decadent one bedroom apartment? Are you feeling guilty that you have room for an armoire AND a closet? Are you anxious that you can&apos;t stretch out and touch both walls of your home? Then we have got the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508072905/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/22/the_folding_apartment.php#photo-1">perfect place for you</a>: a 450-foot foldable apartment on the Upper West Side has been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508072905/http://www.sothebyshomes.com/nyc/sales/0019482">put on the market</a> for the bargain price of $469,000. Check out a video tour of the digs below.</p>

<p>Third-grade-teacher Eric Schneider bought the apartment on West 73rd Street for $235K in 2005. He enlisted architects Michael Chen and Kari Anderson <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508072905/http://www.normalprojects.com/unfolding-apartment/#.U4n5nFhdW19">of Normal Projects</a> to redesign the apartment, building a ginormous blue closet thingy that turns the studio space into a four-in-one unfolding box, with a bedroom, living room, office and closet all inside. Schneider ended up paying another $70K altogether for the box, along with bathroom renovations, cabinetry, kitchen appliances, furniture and dishes.</p>

<p>This is certainly a better bargain than the 420-square-foot folding studio which recently <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508072905/http://gothamist.com/2014/03/20/tiny_foldable_studio_on_market_for.php#photo-1">went on the market for $995K.</a> Just make sure your <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508072905/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/30/murphy_beds.php">eyes are wide open about Murphy Beds</a> if you are really thinking about purchasing the apartment.</p>
