It&apos;s a rare pleasure to get a peek inside the landmark Williamsburgh Savings Bank, which was closed in the mid-00s and converted into luxury condos. We got a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429215526/http://gothamist.com/2009/04/23/williamsburgh_savings_bank.php#photo-1">taste of the interior in 2009</a>, when photographer Nathan Kensinger shot it while still under construction, but the building is now completely closed to the public. Thankfully, photographer Hannah Frishberg didn&apos;t let that stand in her way&#x2014;she snuck past a guard to get onto the roof of the building and take the above photos this summer.</p>

<p>She was able to shoot photos from the observation deck, a construction deck, and then from inside and just below the clock dome on various occasions. Frishberg wrote of the experiences:</p>

<blockquote>Climbing the Williamsburgh Savings Bank Clock Tower makes you feel like you&apos;re king of Kings County. The borough just flattens out at a certain point, you&apos;re so high up. From one level it&apos;s an overwhelming sea of brownstones dotted by high rises, but then a few floors higher and it&apos;s just an endless sea of light,  and you&apos;re on top of New York. 

<p>I managed to sneak in...by walking past the security guard. It was late, and he hardly looked up from whatever he was watching. I tried going during the day a few weeks later though, and either they had a new guy or they&apos;d changed the policy or something, but they asked me to call whomever I was going up to visit.</p></blockquote><p></p>
