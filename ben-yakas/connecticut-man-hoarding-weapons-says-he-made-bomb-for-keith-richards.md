(AP)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>Last week, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160215165856/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/03/guns_explosives_250_gallons_of_jet.php">authorities discovered a large cache</a> of more than 150 guns, 250 gallons of jet fuel, and small explosives inside a stately Fairfield home. Joseph Callahan, 69, has been charged with 112 counts of illegal possession of explosives, six counts of first-degree reckless endangerment and one count of the manufacture of bombs. And for some reason, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160215165856/http://www.ctpost.com/local/article/Oklahoma-City-bomb-making-chemicals-in-Fairfield-4879318.php">he told police</a> he was making a bomb for fellow Connecticut resident, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160215165856/http://gothamist.com/tags/keithrichards">Keith Richards.</a></p>

<p>The beloved Rolling Stones guitarist, whose continued survival despite ingesting every drug ever invented is a testament to existence of God, lives in Weston, Conn., a town near Callahan&#x2019;s home in the Greenfield Hill section of Fairfield. Cops <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160215165856/http://nypost.com/2013/10/09/nutjob-wanted-to-bomb-rolling-stones-keith-richards/">told the Post</a> they were skeptical about the plot, presumably because no one besides Mick Jagger and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160215165856/http://nursethehate.blogspot.com/2008/06/nurse-hate-hate-keith-richards.html">maybe this guy</a> hate Keef. </p>

<p>But Callahan did allegedly brag to cops that he had ammonium nitrate in the house: &#x201C;That&#x2019;s the chemical used in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing,&#x201D; he said. Callahan&apos;s lawyer Richard Meehan said the explosives were only a hobby and his client never wanted to hurt anyone: &quot;He is a delightful gentleman who never had any intention to make a bomb and never intended to hurt anybody,&quot; Meehan said. Just don&apos;t be shocked if we later learn that Callahan is a member of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160215165856/https://www.facebook.com/MickJaggerFanClub">this Facebook group.</a></p>
