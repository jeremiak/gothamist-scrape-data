title: Video: Gentleman Offers Handshake After Getting Sucker Punched

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none" style=" width:640px; "> <img alt="111311suckerpunch.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130222022123im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/111311suckerpunch.jpg" width="640" height="423"> <br> <i>&quot;Exactly. Exactly.&quot; Exactly?</i></div> <p></p>

<p>Is it a show of respect to shake the hand of the man who sucker punched you? Based on the video below, we&apos;re going to have to remember that next time we get into a gentleman&apos;s disagreement on the subway. The video uploader described the scene leading up to the fisticuffs at Times Square: &quot;Man exits turnstile, pushed kid out the way, kid said &apos;What the hell,&apos; man returns, states &quot;I&apos;m waiting,&apos; the kid gives him a beat down. If you want to push and talk crap, you should back it up.&quot;</p>

<p>You can hear the victim say &quot;I&apos;m waiting&quot; (at :06 second mark) as he gets in the teen&apos;s face&#x2014;it may not be a <em>classic</em> sucker punch, but it doesn&apos;t seem like the man expects the teen to go all <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130222022123/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8Y-Fk4ZsDI">Pacquiao on him.</a> Somebody else (possibly the uploader) keeps saying &quot;exactly&quot; in the background after the punching is finished&#x2014;but <em>exactly</em> what? What has been made more exact? The saddest part, of course, is that the puncher doesn&apos;t even accept the handshake. How can we encourage NYers to try and kill each other like civilized people?</p>
