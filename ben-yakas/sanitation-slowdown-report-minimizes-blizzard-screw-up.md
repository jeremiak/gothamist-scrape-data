<p>Yesterday, the Department of Investigation released their long-awaited report on the alleged <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160115074634/http://gothamist.com/tags/slowdown">sanitation &quot;slowdown&quot;</a> during last winter&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160115074634/http://gothamist.com/tags/blizzageddon">Blizzageddon.</a> And they ultimately found that there was no conspiracy to purposefully slowdown as revenge for department budget cuts. You can get the full report <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160115074634/http://www.nyc.gov/html/doi/downloads/pdf/june11/pr36snow_60311.pdf">here</a>. Thanks to it, one local politician may be facing contempt charges.</p>

<p>Most of all, the DOI found that the problems with the blizzard cleanup on December 27 stemmed from &#x201C;significant difficulties in their snow removal operations.&quot; Among those factors were heavy traffic, a large volume of 911 calls, an order to not put salt on the ground, and a lack of proper chains on DSNY trucks&apos; tires. Oh, and the fact that a snow emergency wasn&apos;t declared by the Mayor, who was down in Bermuda during the storm. But what about all those witnesses who said they saw workers just sitting around in their trucks while the storm swirled around them?</p>

<blockquote>Other DSNY trucks that appeared to the public to be doing nothing were stuck with DSNY employees instructed to stay with trucks - creating a negative impression with the public. While stuck with their trucks, DSNY employees were observed napping, or buying coffee or food, again leaving an impression with members of the public that employees were not doing their job.</blockquote>

<p>They did find that four sanitation workers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160115074634/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/02/slowdown_report.php">bought beer at</a> a Brooklyn deli after their trucks got stuck. One of the men admitted that he and two others bought the beer and returned to their vehicle to drink it. Video footage recovered from the deli have been handed over to DSNY for disciplinary action. You can watch that footage <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160115074634/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/city_report_details_sanitation_blunders_Q17GroYNyxwhyGhxluMbVP">here.</a></p>

<p>Councilman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160115074634/http://www.gothamist.com/tags/danhalloran">Dan Halloran</a> may also be facing charges. Halloran had said that five city workers told him of the deliberate slowdown, but the DOI could not confirm the account. Halloran has refused to name the workers he said he spoke with, asserting attorney-client privilege, but now, federal prosecutors <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160115074634/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2011/06/03/2011-06-03_new_york_sanitation_workers_did_not_sabotage_snow_blizzard_cleanup_in_december_i.html">may hit him with</a> a contempt of court charge for refusing to cooperate with an investigation.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160115074634/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2011/06/03/investigation-report-released-of-allegations-into-december-blizzard-slowdown/">According to</a> CBS, Halloran said that while the report &#x201C;highlights some serious deficiencies, mismanagement and employee misconduct,&#x201D; he believes that &#x201C;disturbing questions&#x201D; still remain: &#x201C;My constituents expect me to shed a light on problems and come up with solutions, and I am going to do that, even when it makes the powers that be uncomfortable.&quot;</p>
