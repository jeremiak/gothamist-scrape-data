										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left"> <img alt="71412cop.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160409055923im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/71412cop.jpeg" width="220" height="284"> <br> <i style=" width:220px; ;display:block"> Jose Ramos</i></div> This week, a former NYPD officer embroiled in the ongoing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160409055923/http://gothamist.com/tags/ticketfixing">ticket-fixing scandal</a> was accused of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160409055923/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/12/alleged_ticket-fixing_cop_and_wife.php">plotting to kill a witness who is planning to testify against him</a>. Former officer Jose Ramos, a 17-year veteran, allegedly made arrangements to hire a hit man to whack the unidentified witness, who is prepared to testify against Ramos in a separate drug case. Ramos&apos; wife Wanda Abreu was also indicted for the murder plot, but she sounds like she&apos;s planning her escape route. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160409055923/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/bronx/tix_fix_wife_breaks_faith_KYHyUh2BBTCBIu6bvgJOVM">The Post asked her yesterday in jail</a> whether she still loved her husband, and she responded, &#x201C;I love my kids, and I miss them...Talk to my lawyer&#x201D; And when her lawyer was asked if she would stick by her husband through the legal case, he replied, &#x201C;I cannot answer that.&#x201D;<p></p>

<p>Both have been charged with conspiracy to commit murder. According to Bronx prosecutor Omer Wiczyk, the two borrowed money from Ramos&#x2019; NYPD pension to pay for the hit. Ramos allegedly was heard on tape encouraging his wife to pull the trigger on the deal: &#x201C;Go ahead&#x2014;do it! But do it right away.&#x201D; Their target was a confidential informant who spent time in Who&#x2019;s First Barber Shop II, on East 149th Street in the Bronx, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160409055923/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/11/nypd_ticket-fixing_investigators_ta.php">the barbershop Ramos and his family owned</a><a> (and Ramos worked at for many years).</a></p><a>

</a><p><a>Abreu&#x2019;s lawyer, Sandra Marte, said her client &#x201C;maintains her innocence. We&#x2019;re still trying to figure it all out. There were many conclusions made by the district attorney versus reality and facts.&quot; Ramos has been in jail since last October because of the ticket-fixing scandal&#x2014;</a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160409055923/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/22/mayor_bloomberg_defends_ticket-fixi.php">his chatter with drug dealers</a> on tapped phone lines instigated the department&apos;s massive ticket-fixing probe in the first place. Rikers corrections officers said Abreu had shown up at the jail &#x201C;once or twice a week&#x201D;</p>

<p>Ramos is also accused of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160409055923/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/19/cop_allegedly_took_flatscreen_tv_in.php">taking flat-screen TVs</a> in exchange for fixing tickets, and is one of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160409055923/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/28/hundreds_of_cops_gather_in_support.php">16 NYPD employees who were indicted</a> last year in the Bronx DA&apos;s ticket-fixing case. On top of all that, Ramos has been charged with making a heroin buy and delivery while on duty, in uniform and driving a squad car, AND of ripping off $50,000 from a police undercover posing as a drug dealer and revealing the identity of a confidential informant.</p>
