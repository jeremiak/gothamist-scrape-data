<p>Mayor Bloomberg just won&apos;t learn his lesson about the Jinx Gods: during the mayor&apos;s weekly radio show yesterday, Bloomberg <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426153409/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2011/01/15/2011-01-15_mayor_bloomberg_plans_parade_says_rex_and_jets_will_dispatch_patriots_and_go_in_.html">declared</a>, &quot;<strong>The Jets are going to the Super Bowl. You heard it from me.&quot;</strong> Last October, he made the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426153409/http://gothamist.com/2010/10/08/bloomberg_plans_yanks_parade_route.php">same kind of prediction</a> about the Yankees; they were eliminated by the Texas Rangers in the ALCS less than two weeks later. At least he didn&apos;t plan a parade this time: &quot;I don&apos;t want to jinx &apos;em,&quot; he added. </p>

<p>The Mayor <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426153409/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/new_york_beams_with_jet_pride_22U3wBIDCwDx9fX4GBWIwN?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">also praised</a> Rex Ryan for his bountiful spirit: &quot;He&apos;s all this stuff. He&apos;s out there cheering, &apos;We&apos;re going to beat this guy,&apos; &apos;This is my target,&apos; whatever. That builds the brand, and it builds the Jets as an economic value to the city.&quot; Of course, the Mayor being the Mayor, he couldn&apos;t help but let his business-is-everything ethos slip out, even about sports: &quot;All this stuff is good. Sports, even if you don&apos;t like it, your livelihood depends on it, your tax rates depend on it. We want New York teams to be successful.&quot;</p>
