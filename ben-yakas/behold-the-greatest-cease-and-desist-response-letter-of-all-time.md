										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="61913lawyer.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150415015154im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/61913lawyer.jpeg" width="640" height="457"> <br> <i> Lawyer Stephen B. Kaplitt</i></div> <p></p>

<p>Now, we&apos;ll admit that we don&apos;t have too much experience with cease-and-desist letters&#x2014;but we are familiar with snarky, smart-ass <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150415015154/http://gothamist.com/tags/lawyers">lawyers</a> who seem to relish any opportunity to put a frivolous allegation or lawsuit in its place. And seen in that light, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150415015154/http://abovethelaw.com/2013/06/how-to-write-a-great-response-to-a-cease-and-desist-letter/">the letter below</a> penned by attorney <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150415015154/http://www.kaplittlegal.com/biography.html">Stephen B. Kaplitt</a> on behalf of New Jersey resident <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150415015154/http://www.joekrakoviak.com/about-team-krakoviak/about-jake-freivald">Jake Freivald</a> is practically a work of art. Kaplitt obviously picked the wrong line of work&#x2014;he should have been a blogger.</p>

<p>It all started when Freivald, who runs the rudimentary site <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150415015154/http://westorange.info/">westorange.info</a>, received a cease-and-desist letter from Richard D. Trenk, the township attorney for West Orange, claiming that his website is very very &quot;confusting [<em>sic</em>]&quot;: &quot;The use of the Township&#x2019;s name is unauthorized and is likely to cause confustion [sic], mistake or to deceive the public and may be a violation of the Township&#x2019;s federally protected rights.&quot; You can read the full letter, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150415015154/http://localforums.org/westorange/forum/index.php?PHPSESSID=fcff7e135ecac778412af786add61e47&amp;topic=55.0">which Freivald typed out, here.</a></p>

<p>Then came <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150415015154/http://localforums.org/westorange/forum/index.php?PHPSESSID=fcff7e135ecac778412af786add61e47&amp;topic=101.0">the response letter</a>, which you can read in full below. Suffice to say, it is a level of ownage that would even impress <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150415015154/https://twitter.com/ZODIAC_MF">the mighty Zodiac Motherfucker.</a></p>
