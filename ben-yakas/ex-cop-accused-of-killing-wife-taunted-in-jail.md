I said &apos;You ain&apos;t even a real man for hurting that pretty lady,&apos;&quot; said Joel Gutierrez, an accused drug dealer. <p></p>

<p>Adovasio went <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110327041719/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/16/bronx_mother_disappears_estranged_e.php">missing</a> on March 11 after having a fight with Coello. Surveillance video allegedly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110327041719/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/16/bronx_mother_disappears_estranged_e.php">showed</a> a man dragging a duffel bag &quot;big enough to hold a body&quot; to a car. Adovasio&apos;s body was found five days later; Coello was questioned by police, but refused to give a DNA sample. Coello allegedly admitted to several people that he killed his wife, which was not lost on his fellow inmates: &quot;<strong>We gave it too him pretty good. I&apos;ve done some bad things, but that guy&apos;s evil,</strong>&quot; an inmate who gave his name as Julian told the News.</p>

<p>Inmate Ronaldo Simms, who was locked up for fighting, said Coello better watch out if he ends up in state prison: &quot;Those boys don&apos;t like cops,&quot; Simms said he told Coello during his 20-hour stay. Previously, reports have indicated that Coello has kept a stoic, tough veneer about the accusations, but one corrections officer who witnessed the events of the evening said he thought the gravity of the situation was starting to get to Coello: <strong>&quot;You could tell reality was setting in. He went off by himself and just watched the floor. He didn&apos;t sleep.&quot;</strong></p>
