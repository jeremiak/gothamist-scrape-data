<p>For most New Yorkers, the least favorite part of NYC is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150310101600/http://gothamist.com/tags/timessquare">Times Square</a>, the Disneyfied midtown tourist vortex occupied by marauding costumed characters and comedy club ticket hawkers. And yet, according to a new Twitter-generated public sentiment survey, Times Square is actually the happiest place in NYC.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150310101600/http://www.necsi.edu/research/social/newyork/">Researchers at the New England Complex Systems Institute (NECSI)</a> generated the data in their research by classifying over 600K tweets: &quot;using key words, phrases and emoticons to determine the mood of each tweet, this method, combined with geotagging provided by users, enables us to gauge public sentiment on extremely fine-grained spatial and temporal scales.&quot; In other words, the people who bother to tweet about where they are and use emoticons or words like &quot;overjoyed&quot; are the people who are &quot;happiest&quot; close to Times Square, which makes us feel a little better. They can have it!</p>

<p>&quot;We find that public mood is generally highest in public parks and lowest at transportation hubs, and locate other areas of strong sentiment such as cemeteries, medical centers, a jail, and a sewage facility,&quot; the report, <em>Sentiment in New York City: A High Resolution Spatial and Temporal View</em>, states. </p>
