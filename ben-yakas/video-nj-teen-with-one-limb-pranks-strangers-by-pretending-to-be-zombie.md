<p>A New Jersey teen who was born without an arm and both legs has become an internet sensation after posting videos in which he terrifies unsuspecting shoppers by pretending to be a zombie. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503234241/https://twitter.com/nicksanto534">Nick Santonastasso</a>, 17, was profiled <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503234241/http://blog.nj.com/njv_bob_braun/2010/03/nj_14-year-old_boy_born_with_o.html">by the Star-Ledger</a> in 2010 when he first learned how to walk with prosthetic legs. But he&apos;s gained international attention this week thanks to two &quot;Zombie pranks&quot; he pulled in a Bayville grocery store. Watch them below.</p>

<p>&#x201C;To inspire and entertain at the same time. It&#x2019;s a dream job. Trust me guys, plenty more funny content will be coming out soon. Thank you,&#x201D; he said to his followers on Vine. He left out the part about terrifying strangers, but hey, they are pretty funny videos.</p>

<p>This isn&apos;t Santonastasso&apos;s only brush with zombies: one of his fans, Johnny Pope, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503234241/https://www.change.org/petitions/get-nick-santonastasso-on-walking-dead-please-robert-kirkman-put-nick-on-walking-dead#">started a petition on Change.org</a> to get him a role on AMC&apos;s <em>The Walking Dead.</em> &quot;Nick has made the best out of his physical situation [sic] and it would great if he could work as a zombie on up coming walking dead episode,&quot; Pope wrote. </p>

<p>When he was younger, Santonastasso also appeared on The Today Show with Tiki Barber:</p>
