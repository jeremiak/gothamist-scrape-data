<p>It&apos;s time yet again to dive into the world of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428182455/http://gothamist.com/tags/nytimes">hacky NY Times</a> trend stories, the ugly goiters hanging off the otherwise still functioning NY Times body. Except we&apos;re very happy to report that this one isn&apos;t <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428182455/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/16/ny_times_trolls_brooklyn_hipsters_w.php">as desperate as usual</a>! In today&apos;s exploration of young people&apos;s fascinating short-sightedness, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428182455/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/09/realestate/all-over-but-the-lease.html?adxnnl=1&amp;pagewanted=all&amp;adxnnlx=1370722831-tbdVbnpRxpqXvo3ijQ57Uw">the Times comes to the conclusion that</a> living with your ex after you break up is probably a terrible idea, especially if you&apos;re just doing it to save money on rent.</p>

<p>And that idea, as any <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428182455/http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20698892,00.html">Bethenny Frankel aficionado </a> already knows, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428182455/http://www.today.com/health/living-ex-practical-or-really-really-toxic-1C9894534">seems like a fair, if obvious, point to make.</a> But of course, the NY Times couldn&apos;t get to that point without taking some detours into hilarious anecdotal town. Take a peek at our five favorite ones below.</p>

<p>1. <em>That which has a beginning will surely have an end:</em> &quot;Cassandra Seale and Mike Byhoff moved in together in 2010 after about a year of dating. <strong>He was 26 and worked at Gawker. She was his 24-year-old intern; they both seem a bit sheepish about the clich&#xE9;</strong>. &#x201C;He was in charge of training the interns,&#x201D; Ms. Seale said, quickly adding, &apos;but we didn&#x2019;t start dating until after.&apos;&quot;</p>

<p>2. <em>Red flags</em>: &#x201C;She had always lived in not the best areas of Brooklyn,&#x201D; Mr. Byhoff said. &#x201C;<strong>She liked me, but a really big thing for her was she always wanted to live in Manhattan.&#x201D;</strong></p>

<p>3. <em>Absence makes the heart grow spaghettier</em>: &quot;That sent Ms. Kovar back to Greenpoint, where she and Mr. Lambert tried again to make cohabitation work. It didn&#x2019;t, and <strong>Ms. Kovar took a leave of absence from her job at the Meatball Shop</strong> and moved back to her family home in Philadelphia.&quot;</p>

<p>4. <em>There are worse things then bad credit scores</em>: &quot;Ms. Tagliamonte tracked down the woman, who had no idea that her credit was being ruined by an ex who was squatting in an apartment for which she was legally responsible. The young woman immediately called her former boyfriend, who within 24 hours paid the outstanding $9,000 in full. <strong>&apos;The threat of a lawsuit and going to court was obviously not as threatening as getting an angry call from an ex-girlfriend,&apos; Ms. Tagliamonte said.</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>5. <em>The truest thing ever written</em>: &quot;She cited many friends she had seen follow the same path. &apos;There are kind of these parallel narratives of people our age doing this,&apos; she said, &apos;and it kind of all seems to end the same. <strong>Our generation does a really good job of assuming that they can beat the odds.&apos;&quot;</strong></p>
