<p>A Brooklyn man has been arrested and charged with beating his live-in boyfriend to death. Shaun Woolford, 31, was found in a pool of blood around 3 p.m. inside his Gates Avenue apartment in Bedford-Stuyvesant Wednesday. Boyfriend Devineil Brown, 25, banged on a neighbor&apos;s door around that time: &#x201C;He said he walked into the apartment and found the victim lying on the floor,&#x201D; a police source <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130624075510/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/jilted-boyfriend-beats-ave-hairdresser-death-article-1.1199229">told the News</a>. Except cops later grilled Brown and said he confessed to bashing in Woolford&#x2019;s head during a fight.</p>

<p>Brown has been charged with murder and criminal possession of a weapon. Woolford&apos;s family said the two had recently split after five years together, and Woolford &quot;was in the process of finding his own apartment,&#x201D; Nahkia Williams said of her cousin. &#x201C;They had off-and-on problems, but I didn&#x2019;t think it was to that extent.&quot; </p>

<p>Woolford, who was a stylist, was described as generous and kind by coworkers. &#x201C;All he wanted to do was shop and do hair,&#x201D; stylist Nakia Ray told the News. &#x201C;He was put on this Earth to shop, look good and do hair. They always say God takes his angels back early.&quot; Friends and neighbors of Brown are in shock over the accusations: &quot;[Brown] was always a good guy,&quot; Andrea Burch, who has known Brown since he was a child, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130624075510/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20121108/bedford-stuyvesant/man-found-dead-with-head-trauma-gates-avenue-apartment">told DNAInfo</a>. &quot;He was no troublemaker on the block. I&apos;m just devastated.&quot;<br>
