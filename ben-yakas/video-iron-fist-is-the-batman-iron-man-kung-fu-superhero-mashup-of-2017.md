<p>First, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170612134726/http://gothamist.com/tags/daredevil"><em>Daredevil</em></a> turned Hell&apos;s Kitchen into a credible (if hard to see) warzone; then <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170612134726/http://gothamist.com/tags/jessicajones"><em>Jessica Jones</em></a> made a bold commentary on the horrors of male entitlement (and punching); and last year, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170612134726/http://gothamist.com/tags/lukecage"><em>Luke Cage</em></a> brought the best soundtrack in the superhero game to Harlem (with all due respect to <em>Guardians Of The Galaxy</em>). Now, Netflix will complete their superhero lineup (give or take The Punisher, but let&apos;s not get into that right now) with <em>Iron Fist</em>, which is set to premiere in March. </p>

<p>Below, you can see the first full trailer for the series, which makes it look like a) one part <em>Batman Begins</em> (dead parents, kid gets martial arts training in Asia); b) one part <em>Iron Man</em> (rich heir returns from the dead, has to weigh the responsibilities of his company and his soul); c) <em>Doctor Strange</em> (kung fu battles, but with white people); d) and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170612134726/https://twitter.com/alisonwillmore/status/828993086479011841">Your Most Embarrassing College Hookup.</a> </p>

<p>Finn Jones (Ser Loras Tyrell from <em>Game Of Thrones</em>) stars as Danny Rand, the titular man with the iron fist who happens to be a living weapon of sorts; he is joined by Jessica Henwick as Colleen Wing, Jessica Stroup as Joy Meachum and David Wenham as Harold Meachum. Many Netflix Marvel alums will pop up in the show as well, including Carrie-Anne Moss as Jeri Hogarth, Rosario Dawson as Claire Temple, and Wai Ching Ho as the villainous Madame Gao (last seen in <em>Daredevil</em>). Here&apos;s the synopsis for the show:</p>

<blockquote>Fifteen years after being presumed dead in a plane crash, Danny Rand (Finn Jones) mysteriously returns to New York City determined to reclaim his birthright and family company. However, when a long-destined enemy rises in New York, this living weapon is forced to choose between his family&#x2019;s legacy and his duties as the Iron Fist. </blockquote>

<p>Later this year, Iron Fist will team up with the other aforementioned heroes to form <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170612134726/http://ew.com/tv/2017/01/18/defenders-marvel-netflix-ew-coverage/"><em>The Defenders</em></a> and likely battle a lot of ninjas in the pitch black of Hell&apos;s Kitchen, because we all know how that goes.</p>

<p>In the meantime, check out a few more teaser trailers for the show below:</p>
