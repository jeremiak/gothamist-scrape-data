	<p>Last week, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604141924/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/16/nj_couple_arrested_after_finding_se.php">a NJ man &quot;found&quot; a severely abused dog</a> in a trash bag on the side of a NJ highway&#x2014;but later the supposedly good Samaritan and his wife were arrested and charged with multiple counts of animal cruelty against the 7-year-old cocker spaniel. That dog, named Samurai (or Sammy), is slowly recovering from his many injuries at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604141924/http://www.facebook.com/RedBankVeterinaryHospital?ref=ts&amp;fref=ts">Red Bank Veterinary Hospital</a>, as you can see from the photos and videos below. And he&apos;s gained quite a following: &#x201C;This dog has become a celebrity,&#x201D; Victor Amato of the Monmouth County SPCA <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604141924/http://www.nj.com/monmouth/index.ssf/2013/03/video_photos_malnourished_neglected_dog_recovering_at_red_bank_animal_hospital.html#incart_m-rpt-1">told NJ.com</a>. &#x201C;[He still] has a lot of hurdles to overcome.&#x201D;</p>

<p><iframe width="640" height="480" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604141924if_/http://www.youtube.com/embed/at-BtZUECzU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>Keith Morgan told cops he found the dog on the side of the highway in Wall Township, New Jersey on Thursday, after his wife Shauna spotted a moving garbage bag. Upon opening the bag, he said he &quot;started to cry and I couldn&apos;t understand that anyone could be that cruel..my heart dropped.&quot; Sammy had a skin infection, ear infection, open wounds and sores after years of abuse and neglect.</p>

<p>Initially, they named the dog &quot;Morgan&quot; after the man who found him. But by Friday, Amato and others were having doubts about the story. It was soon discovered that the dog had been registered to the Morgans. &#x201C;The dog was registered in Brick, NJ to these people [the couple] in 2007,&quot; Amato said. &quot;We know that the dog is at least 7 years old, but it looks much older than 7.&#x201D; Amato now estimates the dog to be 13 or 14 years old. </p>

<p>The couple was taken into custody on Friday. Keith Morgan was charged with animal cruelty by abandonment of a sick or maimed animal, filing a false report with law enforcement, interfering with an investigation, and animal cruelty by failure to provide sustenance and causing unnecessary suffering. His wife was also charged with animal cruelty by abandonment and by failure to provide sustenance. The couple was issued a disorderly persons summons and faces a maximum of six months in jail and $1,000 fine on each count.</p>

<p>In the past few days, Sammy has been able to eat a little dry food along with his liquid diet, and has been able to stand up and walk slowly. He&apos;s received letters of support and calls from as far away as England, Japan and Australia. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604141924/http://www.nj.com/monmouth/index.ssf/2013/03/video_photos_malnourished_neglected_dog_recovering_at_red_bank_animal_hospital.html#incart_m-rpt-1">Amato added that</a> if Sammy keeps doing well with his recovery, the hardest thing will be deciding who to give him to, because of all the interested parties.</p>
