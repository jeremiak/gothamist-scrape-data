<p>There are so many iterations of the obscure 1990s NBC television comedy program <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425173041/http://gothamist.com/tags/seinfeld"><em>Seinfeld</em></a> that exist today, it&apos;s almost as if it were still on air: there&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425173041/https://twitter.com/SeinfeldToday">Modern Seinfeld</a>, there&apos;s Modern Seinfeld parody <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425173041/https://twitter.com/Seinfeld2000">Seinfeld2000</a>, there&apos;s new Jerry Seinfeld <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425173041/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/jerry-seinfeld-debuts-5-minutes-421903">standup material</a>, there&apos;s even multiple quasi-<em>Seinfeld</em> reunions. We can now add one more to the list: Pete Holmes&apos;s &#x201C;New Material Seinfeld,&#x201D; a blue felt puppet who wears a tiny Jerry Seinfeld wig and is completely indistinguishable from real life Jerry.</p>

<p>Hardwood floors, typewriters and bars: it&apos;s uncanny how similar &quot;New Material Seinfeld&quot; and real life Jerry are. Let&apos;s try out own: what&apos;s the deal with purposefully bad Seinfeld impressions??!? Why do we enjoy them so much??!? Why does Larry David <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425173041/http://www.complex.com/pop-culture/2013/11/larry-david-modern-seinfeld">hate them so much</a>??!? Why isn&apos;t the puppet named Sein<em>felt??!?</em> Airplane food!?! <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425173041/https://twitter.com/seinfeldtweets/status/3536028767">Space-time continuum</a>?!?</p>

<p>This is the third time the felt Seinfeld has appeared on Holmes&apos;s show. Watch the first two times below.</p>

<p>If time is a flat circle, then <em>Seinfeld</em> always has and always will be, whether in felt form or flesh.</p>
