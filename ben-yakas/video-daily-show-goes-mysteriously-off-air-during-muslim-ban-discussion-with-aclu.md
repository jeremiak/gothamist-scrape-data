<p>Trevor Noah was engaged in a passionate discussion about Donald Trump&apos;s Muslim travel ban last night with Anthony Romero, the executive director of the ACLU, when something very strange happened&#x2014;the screen cut to black. </p>

<p>The blackout, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170626180257/http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv/daily-show-blacks-muslim-ban-discussion-article-1.2961174">which possibly affected</a> millions of TV sets, lasted about a minute; all that could be seen on the screen was a small Comedy Central logo in the bottom right hand corner of the screen. </p>

<p>Comedy Central later confirmed that it was just a glitch that caused the mistake, but the fact that so many people&#x2014;including Noah himself&#x2014;were concerned about censorship is probably a bad signpost for where all of our heads are at right now. </p>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">OK. Just a broadcast glitch. It&apos;s not happening yet people. See you tomorrow good people!</p>&#x2014; Trevor Noah (@Trevornoah) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170626180257/https://twitter.com/Trevornoah/status/826660082150686720">February 1, 2017</a></blockquote>

<p>The actual interview with Romero is very good, and you can watch the entire thing&#x2014;glitch free&#x2014;below.</p>

<p>Noah, who said the ban had &quot;all the consideration of a drunken Vegas wedding&quot; in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170626180257/http://time.com/4655120/trevor-noah-refugee-ban/">a piece earlier this week</a>, also dived into the firing of acting Attorney General Sally Yates in his opening piece. </p>
