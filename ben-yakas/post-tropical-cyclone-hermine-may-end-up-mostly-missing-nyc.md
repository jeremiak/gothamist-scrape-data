<p>Post-Tropical Cyclone <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161113145345/http://gothamist.com/tags/hermine">Hermine</a> (formerly Tropical Storm Hermine, nee Hurricane Hermine, pronounced <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161113145345/http://nypost.com/2016/09/04/youve-been-pronouncing-labor-day-storm-hermine-wrong/">her-MEEN</a>, but friends call her Herm) is bearing down on the East Coast today after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161113145345/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/04/us/hurricane-hermine-tropical-storm-florida-damage.html?smid=tw-nytnational&amp;smtyp=cur&amp;_r=0">causing major damage</a> in Florida at the start of the holiday weekend. But as meteorologists have pointed out this morning, the storm isn&apos;t so much bearing down on the tri-state area as it is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161113145345/https://weather.com/news/news/hermine-east-coast-impacts-carolinas-virginia-maryland-new-york-new-jersey-delaware">&quot;meandering&quot; toward it</a>. After all the anticipation and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161113145345/http://nypost.com/2016/09/03/hermine-leaves-deadly-trail-of-destruction-as-it-barrels-up-coast/">weathermongering</a>, NYC may barely feel any effects from Hermine.</p>

<p>Hermine drifted farther out to sea than anticipated last night, which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161113145345/http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/04/us/weather-hermine/index.html">CNN reports</a> will lessen the storm&apos;s impact on coastal New Jersey, Delaware and NYC (there still could be bad weather for parts of eastern Long Island, Rhode Island and Massachusetts). Even outlets more prone to hyperbole (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161113145345/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Hermine-Nears-New-York-New-Jersey-Storm-Surge-Likely-392279351.html">NBC</a>: &quot;Nat&apos;l Hurricane Center Warns of &apos;Life-Threatening Inundation&apos;&quot;) admit that the current course of the storm is headed eastward, &quot;potentially reducing many of its impacts.&quot; Though there are still some concerns...</p>

<p>Nevertheless, a tropical storm warning has been issued for New York City, Long Island and parts of Westchester County through tonight, with the worst coming early into Monday morning. Local beaches <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161113145345/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2016/09/04/tropical-storm-hermine-nyc/">are closed</a> to swimming, surfing, and bathing today, and moderate coastal flooding is still possible. </p>

<p>&quot;As Hermine approaches, we are taking every action necessary to protect New Yorkers and our most vulnerable infrastructure across downstate,&quot; Governor Cuomo said in a statement. &quot;We are monitoring the storm&apos;s progression around the clock and, while the latest forecasts spare our state from the brunt of the storm, I have directed emergency response officials to pre-deploy high axle vehicles and swift water rescue teams in the event of localized flooding. I urge residents and visitors to check local weather reports before traveling [Sunday] and Monday and to stay informed by using NY Alert&#x200E;.&quot; </p>

<p>Mayor de Blasio delivered his own update on the storm via Twitter:</p>
