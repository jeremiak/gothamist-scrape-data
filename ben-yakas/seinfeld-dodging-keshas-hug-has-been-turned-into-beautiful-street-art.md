<p>If you&apos;re anything like me, you can still remember the exact place you were when you first saw the iconic video of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171030202648/http://gothamist.com/2017/06/07/seinfeld_rule_of_hugs.php">Jerry Seinfeld masterfully avoiding a hug from Kesha</a> on the red carpet for the David Lynch Foundation&apos;s &quot;A Night of Laughter and Song.&quot; (For the record, I was where I am right now: sitting at my desk at work. <em>Unforgettable</em>.) That moment has now been preserved for future generations (or at least people who can visit it in the next months before it gets taken down) in a beautiful piece of street art in Melbourne, Australia. </p>

<p>It was created by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171030202648/https://www.instagram.com/lushsux/">Lush</a>, who has a thing for turning viral memes like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171030202648/https://www.instagram.com/p/BVKJLjmHkdM/?taken-by=lushsux">Salt Bae</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171030202648/https://www.instagram.com/p/BVJI_dRH2sL/?taken-by=lushsux">Tiger Woods&apos; mugshot</a> into art.</p>

<p>Since the hug denial heard round the world, Seinfeld has explained his snub: &quot;I don&#x2019;t hug a total stranger,&quot; he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171030202648/http://extratv.com/2017/06/08/jerry-seinfeld-on-denying-kesha-a-hug-and-their-off-camera-exchange-afterward">told <em>Extra</em></a>. &quot;I have to meet someone, say hello, I gotta start somewhere.&quot; He also didn&apos;t really know who Kesha was: &quot;I&#x2019;m 63, I don&#x2019;t know every pop star&#x2026; I don&#x2019;t know everyone,&quot; he added. &quot;I was right in the middle of an interview, it was a little off.&quot; Maybe if she had picked a better moment, things would have gone differently&#x2014;or maybe not, because no one, regardless of celebrity, should be forced to hug/make physical contact with another human being if they are uncomfortable with it, even if it is offered out of love. </p>

<p>Anyway, if you want to rewatch the priceless interaction, which is basically like a lost <em>Seinfeld</em> episode, click below.</p>
