Witness Silver Serin, who took the photos above and is the owner of the nearby <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170404211759/https://www.facebook.com/ZingaraVintage/?pnref=about.overview">Zingara Vintage</a>, wrote in a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170404211759/https://www.facebook.com/erinesilvers/posts/10212720046860433">Facebook post</a> about coming upon the whale:</p>

<blockquote>What a sad day on the beach. What a magnificent beast. She is enormous and washed up in the storm last night. When you look at a whale, it&apos;s hard to think of it as a mammal. I was looking for hair on her huge rubbery body. I found some whiskers on her snout. From the very front, she looks like a sea lion, or a manatee. Her tail spanned about 8 feet and she is about 20 feet long. She is soft. Very soft. I can imagine her gliding through the ocean. Her eyes are enormous, about the size of baseballs. And her ridges are deep and flexible. What a sight to behold. I wonder just what killed her. How old she was. Will her family miss her. Poor creature.</blockquote>

<p>Whales <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170404211759/http://gothamist.com/tags/whale">can be frequently spotted</a> swimming near Rockaway Beach and other parts of the city, and they unfortunately wash ashore fairly commonly as well; the last one <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170404211759/http://gothamist.com/2017/01/13/dead_whale_washes_ashore_near_lagua.php">happened in January</a> near LaGuardia Airport.</p>
