title: Did De Blasio's Snowplows Snub The UES Or Is The NY Post Deranged?

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150625105303/http://gothamist.com/tags/billdeblasio">Bill de Blasio</a> had to deal with a major snowstorm just a few days into his tenure as mayor earlier this month&#x2014;and by all accounts, he did a fine job handling it, though everyone may have been too distracted by him <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150625105303/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/03/de_blasio_winter_storm_update_serio.php">performing a striptease</a> to fully assess the response. But the second major snowstorm yesterday has proved to be slightly more divisive, at least if you live on the Upper East Side and/or work at the NY Post. The tabloid cried havoc and let slip the dogs of class warfare today, blaming de Blasio for &quot;leaving the 1-percenters in the cold&quot; by not plowing parts of the UES last night&#x2014;regardless of whether that was actually true or not.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150625105303/http://nypost.com/2014/01/21/upper-east-side-residents-feel-spurned-after-plow-delay/">The Post cited</a> the city&apos;s snow plow tracker as evidence that no plowing was done between East 59th and 79th Streets and between Second and Fifth Avenues. As you can tell from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150625105303/http://www.newseum.org/todaysfrontpages/hr.asp?fpVname=NY_NYP&amp;ref_pge=gal&amp;b_pge=2">today&apos;s front cover,</a> this little narrative was exactly what they ran with. They also went out and elicited the riled up quotes they needed to sell it: </p>

<blockquote>&#x201C;He is trying to get us back. He is very divisive and political,&#x201D; said writer and Life-long Upper East Sider and mom Molly Jong Fast of Mayor de Blasio.

<p>&quot;By not plowing the Upper East Side, he is saying, &apos;I&apos;m not one of them.&apos; But we have everyone in this area on the Upper East Side. We have rich people, middle class people, and housing projects. We have it all.&quot;</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="012214bus.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150625105303im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_arts_john/012214bus.jpg" width="300" height="325" class="image-left"> </span>&quot;I can&apos;t believe de Blasio could do this. He is putting everyone in danger,&#x201D; added fellow resident Barbara Tamerin. &quot;I can barely get around and I&apos;m on snow shoes! All of the buses are stuck and can&#x2019;t go anywhere. He&#x2019;s crazy. We need Mayor Bloomberg back!&quot; Hell, reading all these quotes, we felt our blood pressure rising as well. Who <em>wouldn&apos;t</em> be mad if their streets were specifically not plowed, regardless of income or area?</p>

<p>The only problem with this little narrative? It&apos;s not specifically too truthy. Sanitation Commissioner John Doherty&#x2014;who served under Bloomberg <em>before</em> de Blasio&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150625105303/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2014/01/21/sanitation-comm-map-showing-no-plowing-on-ues-was-due-to-bad-gps-on-salt-truck/">explained the reason</a> the PlowNYC website showed there had been no snow removal on the UES was due to a faulty GPS system on a salt spreader. </p>

<p>The other problem? Too many cars on the UES: &#x201C;Traffic also created a big problem for us in that area. I think any of the reporters, or anybody who was in that area this afternoon were reporting, nothing is moving in the area,&#x201D; Doherty said. &quot;The longer it takes those cars to move, the longer it takes for us to get in there and salt those streets, and that&#x2019;s what part of the problem was,&#x201D; he said.</p>

<p>But who can argue with a quote like this: &quot;De Blasio is trying to hurt the more wealthy people by ignoring us but there&#x2019;s no logic to that,&#x201D; Martin Cisse told the Post. &quot;There are a lot of blue collar working people out here driving trucks and trying to get around too.&quot; Oh sure, the backend of that quote may somewhat contradict their whole thesis that this is revenge on the 1%. And sure, the Post may not have gotten quotes from residents in other parts of the city that weren&apos;t plowed immediately either. And hey, whatever delays there were in plowing the UES may very well be totally normal in other parts of the city during previous snowstorms, but there&apos;s no denying that de Blasio CLEARLY wanted to stop rich people from leaving their apartments today as political revenge because that makes <em>so much sense.</em></p>

<p>&quot;I think the city handled it very well,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150625105303/http://politicker.com/2014/01/bill-de-blasio-defends-snow-response-as-he-shovels-his-sidewalk-again/">de Blasio told reporters</a> while shoveling his sidewalk in Brooklyn this morning. &quot;There&#x2019;s always, look, there&#x2019;s always going to be isolated incidents and there&#x2019;s always going to be situations where the snow comes up rapidly, as it did for a few hours there, it really sped up and intensified, sadly right before the evening rush hour...But the minute they had the streets clear&#x2014;in other words there was not traffic in the way&#x2014;sanitation did a remarkable job.&quot; </p>

<p>Is it ideal that there&apos;s a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150625105303/http://instagram.com/p/jeZC41QOPK/">backup of slush on subway stairways</a> on the UES? Is it news when there&apos;s a backup of slush on subway stairways in any part of the city? Is the UES a very precious neighborhood whose residents need to be coddled by the city during weather crises? Did de Blasio order Bloomberg&apos;s Sanitation Commissioner to punish the One Percent? Is the NY Post a ridiculous newspaper? Are any of these questions rhetorical?</p>
