<p>There&apos;s one totally rad video of a professional skateboarder <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170111153133/http://gothamist.com/2013/12/06/watch_a_gif_of_skateboarder_jumping.php">jumping over the subway tracks</a>, and suddenly everyone thinks they&apos;re Tony Hawk. But as the straphanger in the video below learned the hard way, she is no Tony Hawk&#x2014;she&apos;s not even <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170111153133/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/10/video_two_dudes_jump_across_subway.php">these stupid dudes</a>, nor is she <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170111153133/http://gothamist.com/2015/02/11/dont_jump_into_subway_tracks.php">$5 richer today.</a> She&apos;s just a person who appears to have hurt herself doing something very ill-advised.</p>

<p>The video, which was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170111153133/https://www.instagram.com/i_punch_smuts/">first posted on Instagram</a>, appears to have taken place at one of the subway platforms at Penn Station in Manhattan this week. We&apos;ve contacted the uploader to get more details. </p>

<p>Suffice to say, no matter how bored you&apos;re feeling with your life, it&apos;s not worth taking after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170111153133/http://gothamist.com/2015/06/25/subway_jump_subpar.php">Darwin Award nominees of the recent past</a>. If you&apos;re going attempt to jump over anything in the subway (note: Gothamist does not endorse this), at least follow the path of your elders.</p>

<p>Even if you will it, sometimes it&apos;s still just a dream.</p>
