<p>Today is Earth Day, and everyone has got Mother Gaia on their minds&#x2014;Mayor Bloomberg&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424164717/http://twitter.com/#!/nycmayorsoffice">Twitter</a> is green, your free Starbucks coffee <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424164717/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/22/earth_day_dining.php">is &quot;green,&quot;</a> and some confused souls probably think it&apos;s still that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424164717/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/19/free_two_boots_pizza_is_one_way_to.php">other green day</a>. But according to a recent study, not everyone is so jazzed about living sustainably. A majority, in fact, think it&apos;s downright girly.</p>

<p>According to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424164717/http://blogs.ogilvy.com/blogs/web/29811/OgilvyEarth/Blog;jsessionid=FIe166vFftgh+PpwZYFrGQ**.node2?p_p_id=Dispblogs&amp;p_p_lifecycle=1&amp;p_p_state=normal&amp;p_p_mode=view&amp;p_p_col_id=column-1&amp;p_p_col_count=1&amp;_Dispblogs_struts_action=%2Fext%2Fui%2Fview_blogs&amp;_Dispblogs_entryId=169776">study by OgilvyEarth</a>, 82 percent of Americans think that going green is &quot;feminine.&quot; They found that more men identified as &quot;Green Rejecters,&quot; and women made up the majority of the &quot;Super Greens,&quot; the most active group of green advocates. And at the core of the problem was some sort of gender insecurity:</p>

<blockquote>Our ethnographic research in the homes of mainstream Americans confirmed the finding,<strong> with the men we spoke to admitting they refrained from green activities like carrying reusable totes and even driving hybrid vehicles because they felt girly or self-conscious.</strong> Clearly sustainability marketing needs its Marlboro Man moment.</blockquote>

<p>The Onion backed up their study with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424164717/http://www.theonion.com/articles/green-considered-feminine,20161/">their own &quot;interviews&quot;</a> with people-on-the-street, including one man who very reasonably said, <strong>&quot;Well, once all of the women save the world, I intend to give them the best sex of their lives, so it all works out in the end.</strong>&quot; OgilvyEarth gave some suggestions on how <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424164717/http://yourlife.usatoday.com/your-look/story/2011/04/FTC-to-issue-new-green-guidelines-address-tsunami-of-marketing-claims/46329674/1">marketers</a> can woo males to go green: &quot;These men see conquering issues of sustainability in their own lives as a personal challenge, a problem to solve, and something ordinary men don&#x2019;t have the know-how or competence to handle.&quot; So...it&apos;s all about flattering them, ladies and/or corporations! Because they&apos;ll never learn to recycle without the enticement of sexual favors.</p>

<p>But really dudes...is there anything &quot;feminine&quot; about killing your girlfriend and composting her, like the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424164717/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/42711922/ns/technology_and_science-science/">co-founder of Earth Day did</a>? Check and mate, men.</p>
