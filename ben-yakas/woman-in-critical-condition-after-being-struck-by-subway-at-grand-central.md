<p>Witness Bonnie Ingram <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405025459/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/woman-hit-subway-fainting-grand-central-article-1.1559264">told the News</a> that a man had tried to grab her but lost his grip. &#x201C;He was frantic,&#x201D; Ingram said. When paramedics arrived, the woman &quot;was still conscious. Her eyes were open, but you could tell she was in a daze. She wasn&#x2019;t speaking. I think she was in shock ... She was bleeding all over the place.&quot;</p>

<p>Earlier this week, a person died after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405025459/http://gothamist.com/2013/12/23/person_dies_after_throwing_herself.php">jumping in front of a train</a> in Brooklyn. According to the MTA, 147 people have been struck by subways so far in 2013, and 53 people have been killed&#x2014;in 2012, 141 people were struck by subways, and 55 were killed. </p>
