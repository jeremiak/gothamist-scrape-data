<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508140656/http://gothamist.com/tags/stvincents">St. Vincent&apos;s Catholic Medical Center</a> was founded in 1849; it was shuttered in 2010 due to the hospital&apos;s dire financial situation (they first filed for bankruptcy in 2005); and it will be transformed into $3,500 per-square-foot apartments as of 2015. Because what NYC needs more than anything else right now are more luxury condos. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508140656/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/27/realestate/where-st-vincents-once-stood.html?hp">The Times reports</a> on the project known as the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508140656/http://www.thegreenwichlane.com/">Greenwich Lane</a>, a 200-unit condominium, five building complex that will take up half the block between West 11th and West 12th Streets, Seventh Avenue and Avenue of the Americas. Here&apos;s the nut of it all:</p>

<blockquote>Many of the units will be large enough to accommodate growing families, but there is no mistaking that this will be a luxury development. <strong>Prices at the $1 billion project will average $3,500 a square foot &#x2014; among the highest for new condos downtown and well above average for developments in the city. </strong>Move-ins are expected in the summer of 2015.

<p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s an exhilarating new chapter, because the speculation about what it is, is over,&#x201D; said James Lansill, a senior managing director of the Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group, which is handling sales.</p>

<p>&#x201C;It feels terrific to show it off to the marketplace,&#x201D; he added, &#x201C;because simultaneous to any controversy that was happening, there&#x2019;s been a tremendous buildup of interest in the project.&#x201D;</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>Sure, people are more excited about putting down a few millions dollars for property than the loss of health care, and a NYC institution, in the neighborhood. But okay, this sounds pretty bad, but there&apos;ll be some housing for low-income families, right? &#x201C;There is really something for everyone,&#x201D; said Samantha Rudin, a vice president of the Rudin Management Company and Global Holdings, which developed the project. Oh that&apos;s great! Wait... </p>

<blockquote>Still, only a select few may be able to walk away with a home. Even the most affordable unit won&#x2019;t come cheap: a one-bedroom at 155 West 11th Street, the largest of the Greenwich Lane&#x2019;s 5 main buildings, with 83 units, will be listed at $2.05 million.</blockquote>

<p>&#x201C;This project will make the neighborhood more wealthy, more homogeneous,&#x201D; said Andrew Berman, executive director of the Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation, who fought against the project for years. &#x201C;In terms of the positive results for the community, it&#x2019;s really hard to see what they are.&#x201D;</p>
