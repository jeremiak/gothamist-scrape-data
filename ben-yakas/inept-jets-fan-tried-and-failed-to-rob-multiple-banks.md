<p>Between buttfumbling, the Tim Tebow debacle, and the fact their whole franchise has kind of hit the crapper, it&apos;s no surprise that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130608075457/http://gothamist.com/tags/jets">Jets fans</a> are feeling a little desperate and despondent right now. One such Jets fan decided to take out his frustrations by attempting to go on a bank robbing spree on Friday in Manhattan&#x2014;except, just like his beloved team, he failed more often than not at the task at hand.</p>

<p>The suspect attempted to rob five banks in a 75 minute span Friday afternoon, and only succeeded in two of those endeavors. First he tried to rob a Chase on Broadway at W. 96th St. at 12:51 p.m., but the teller <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130608075457/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/jets-fan-0-for-4-robs-bank-5th-article-1.1340757?localLinksEnabled=false">just stared at him</a>, and he fled without any money. Then he tried a Chase on Broadway and W. 61st St. at 1:16 p.m., but again fled without any money. He tried a Capital One on W. 57th St. and Sixth Ave. at 1:32 p.m., and was finally successful, leaving with an unknown amount of cash&#x2014;that time he faked as if he had a gun in his jacket.</p>

<p>But the suspect pushed his luck, and failed to get anything at a Bank of America on W. 57th St. near Fifth Ave. as the clock ticked toward 1:40 p.m. The spree ended successfully at a Capital One Bank on Fifth Ave. and W. 37th St. just after 2 p.m. That time, he wrote a note demanding cash.</p>

<p>Police believe this is the same suspect who robbed two banks on April 12th in Manhattan that took place within 20 minutes of each other. The suspect is described as being 25-30, 5&apos;10&quot;-6&apos;0&quot; and 180-200 pounds. He was last seen wearing a dark leather jacket with a gray shirt with a NY Jets logo.</p>

<p>Anyone with information in regards to this incident is asked to call the NYPD&apos;s Crime Stoppers Hotline at 800-577-TIPS. The public can also submit their tips by logging onto the <a href="WWW.NYPDCRIMESTOPPERS.COM">Crime Stoppers Website</a> or texting their tips to 274637(CRIMES) then enter TIP577.</p>
