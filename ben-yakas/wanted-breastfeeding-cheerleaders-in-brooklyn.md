<p>The Bloomberg administration <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130527165857/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/19/true_nanny_state_bloomberg_will_pro.php">has been a very active promoter</a> of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130527165857/http://gothamist.com/tags/breastfeeding">breastfeeding</a>, launching Latch On NYC last year and keeping baby formula <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130527165857/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/29/nanny_bloomberg_wants_hospitals_to.php">under lock and key</a> to try to encourage moms to exclusively breastfeed at first. Now comes the next phase of their initiative: the city is looking to hire someone to encourage breastfeeding in parts of Brooklyn. Annual salary: $73,000.</p>

<p>The program <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130527165857/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/city_buys_moms_breast_friend_3NwwssbaDoxlgC5rZGNtXP">will focus on</a> areas in Bedford-Stuyvesant and Brownsville to &#x201C;encourage and support&#x201D; suckling. The initiative seems to be focusing on education and outreach to low-income households; the job will include home visits, consultations, and community mobilization, with a particular focus on &#x201C;male involvement in breast-feeding.&#x201D; </p>

<p>Here&apos;s the job description:</p>

<blockquote>The Breastfeeding Empowerment Zone (BFEZ) Project will target specific geographic areas within North/Central Brooklyn (Bedford-Stuyvesant and Brownsville) to provide comprehensive, multi-level initiatives to encourage and support breastfeeding, addressing both gaps in breastfeeding education and practice as well as broader social determinants of health. The BFEZ Project will focus on male involvement in breastfeeding, local capacity building and economic development, community mobilization, community education and media, and direct services comprised of breastfeeding consultations, home visits, and support groups.</blockquote>
