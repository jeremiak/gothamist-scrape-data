<p>As Harry Nilsson <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604142246/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ePPd-EQ19U">once sang</a>, &quot;Dreams are nothing more than wishes/and a wish is just a dream/you wish to come true.&quot; It&apos;s a line that the NY Post would be wise to heed, based on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604142246/http://www.nypost.com/p/pagesix/late_night_seth_J7RplneQOrOZPc167GeAtI">their anonymously-sourced report today</a> that Seth Meyers is definitely maybe in line to replace Jimmy Fallon once he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604142246/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/22/so_albany_tonight_show_with_jimmy_f.php">likely probably</a> takes over &quot;The Tonight Show.&quot; Based on his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604142246/http://gothamist.com/tags/snl">&quot;Weekend Update&quot;</a> work on SNL, Meyers could ease into the late night chair pretty easily, even if he is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604142246/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/20/the_top_15_candidates_to_replace_ji.php">no Ant-Man or Julie Klausner.</a></p>

<p>But the Page Six report doesn&apos;t seem like anything more than a well-placed rumor to gauge public interest in Meyers. The anonymous source told them, &quot;Lorne Michaels wants Seth to take over from Fallon. It would be perfect for him. Tina Fey&apos;s name had also come up, but she has said she was too busy to do it.&quot; Recently, Meyers was cagey about whether he was interested in taking over for Fallon: &quot;Nobody could do that job as well as Jimmy Fallon,&quot; Meyers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604142246/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/19/seth-meyers-snl-should-end-when-lorne-michaels-retires_n_2907527.html">said during a discussion</a> with New York Times reporter Bill Carter at the 92Y on Monday. He added that he would not take hosting jobs on <em>Jeopardy!</em>, <em>The View</em> or Keith Olbermann&apos;s old spot on Al Jazeera. </p>

<p>There&apos;s a lot of evidence that Meyers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604142246/http://www.hollywood.com/news/tv/55005164/seth-meyers-replacing-jimmy-fallon-tonight-show">could flourish in the position</a>, even if he&apos;s not our <em>favorite</em> &quot;Weekend Update&quot; host of all time. Now, if Meyers co-hosted &quot;Late Night&quot; with Stefon, that would be something. Actually, just give the show to Stefon, and let&apos;s be done with it. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604142246/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/20/the_top_15_candidates_to_replace_ji.php">Or Ant-Man.</a> </p>
