<p>It&apos;s hard out there for a boarder this year: there was a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509212850/http://gothamist.com/2011/07/23/details_about_dramatic_arrest_of_uw.php">skateboarding groper</a> running amok near Columbia University this summer, giving a bad name to skateboarders everywhere. In addition, boarders have been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509212850/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/13/columbus_circle_facing_skateboardin.php">driven out of Columbus Circle</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509212850/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/07/skateboarding_hooligans_ruining_eas.php">the East River Esplanade</a> for being &quot;hooligans.&quot; There&apos;s nowhere for these outcasts of society to practice their art anymore&#x2014;except for the subway!</p>

<p>The video was taken by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509212850/http://www.slapmagazine.com/">Slap Skateboarding Magazine</a>. According to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509212850/http://www.mta.info/nyct/rules/">NYC Transit Rules of Conduct</a>, it&apos;s a violation to stand on a skateboard on the subway; jump the turnstile or enter the system improperly; move between end doors of a subway car whether or not train is in motion; and damage subway or bus property&#x2014;all of which the skaters in this video do. But what&apos;s cooler: skating in the subway, or skating in an Earthquake-ravaged town?</p>
