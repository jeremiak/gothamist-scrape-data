<p>Bobby Moynihan is leaving <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170716213919/http://gothamist.com/tags/saturdaynightlive"><em>Saturday Night Live</em></a> after nine seasons, following this weekend&apos;s season finale with The Rock. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170716213919/http://deadline.com/2017/05/bobby-moynihan-departing-saturday-night-live-9-seasons-1202096596/">The news</a> was somewhat expected, considering that Moynihan&apos;s CBS comedy pilot, <em>Me, Myself &amp; I</em>, was picked up to series in the fall. But it was only confirmed yesterday at the CBS upfronts. &quot;My life&apos;s dream was to be on that show and I don&apos;t ever want to leave, but the [CBS] show did get picked up so we&apos;ll see,&quot; he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170716213919/http://www.eonline.com/news/853896/bobby-moynihan-leaving-saturday-night-live-my-life-s-dream-was-to-be-on-that-show">said yesterday</a>. &quot;[SNL] was the best...That&apos;s all I wanted to do.&quot;</p>

<p>Moynihan, like fellow SNL vet Kenan Thompson (who also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170716213919/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kenan-thompson-snl_us_58fdedc3e4b018a9ce5cbb02">has been the subject</a> of speculation for the same reason, although nothing has been announced yet), has been a glue guy over recent seasons. He wasn&apos;t always the standout star of a sketch&#x2014;although he did have his moments, of course, with characters like Drunk Uncle, second-hand news reporter Anthony Crispino, or my beloved Riblet&#x2014;but he knew how to add just enough to make every sketch a little funnier and a little weirder. He could handle impressions (Newt Gingrich, Snooki, Guy Fieri, Chris Christie, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170716213919/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/16/video_alec_baldwins_trump_turns_int.php">Ken Bone</a>) as well as he could handle physical comedy; he knew when to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170716213919/http://gothamist.com/2015/05/17/videos_louis_ck_snl.php#photo-10">go over-the-top</a> with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170716213919/http://gothamist.com/2017/05/07/watch_snl_mock_morning_joe_engageme.php">an expression</a> in the background of a skit, or reel it in and play the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170716213919/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/13/videos_chris_hemsworth_will_ferrell.php#photo-3">straight man.</a></p>

<p>And as I&apos;ve mentioned (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170716213919/http://gothamist.com/2014/12/14/videos_martin_freeman_saturday_nigh.php?gallery0Pic=4#photo-2">in at least</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170716213919/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/04/photos_videos_saturday_night_live_p.php#photo-1">four SNL reviews</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170716213919/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/06/videos_saturday_night_live_turns_in.php#photo-1">over the</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170716213919/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/13/snl_videos_ariana_grande_does_doubl.php?gallery0Pic=12">years</a>), he was a perennial scene-stealer who could drop into an otherwise bombing sketch and run away with it in less than 20 seconds. Just look at the time he appeared as a depressed Teddy Bear in an otherwise forgettable sketch about Miley Cyrus <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170716213919/http://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/video/vmas-backstage-cold-open/n41620?snl=1">at the MTV Video Music Awards,</a> or the time he hilariously <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170716213919/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/21/video_kristen_wiig_stars_in_two_wei.php">popped up in a top hat and no pants</a> for a very surreal Thanksgiving feast. This ability has extended to some of his work in films as well, as with his scenes in <em>Sisters</em>.</p>

<p>Here are just a few favorite Moynihan-led segments and characters I love, starting with <strong>Mornin&apos; Miami</strong>:</p>

<center><div itemprop="video" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/VideoObject"><iframe src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170716213919if_/http://player.theplatform.com/p/NnzsPC/widget/select/media/guid/2410887629/822de11d95cd2e31ae5d37ed8f9444ff" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" seamless="seamless" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></center>

<p><br>
<strong>Second-Hand News Correspondent Anthon Crispino</strong> has easily made over 10 appearances on the show. How could anyone dislike someone with such a wind-swept mullet and high vocal range?</p>

<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170716213919if_/https://www.youtube.com/embed/6t7h2VyEm4M" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>He played one half of <strong>Broderick &amp; Ganz</strong> and showed off his extremely natural hand acting: </p>

<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170716213919if_/https://www.youtube.com/embed/C8_3jS9wd9w" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>Here he is as <strong>Guy Fieri</strong>, whose Full Throttle Christmas Special is the stuff of holiday nightmares:  </p>

<div itemprop="video" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/VideoObject"><iframe src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170716213919if_/http://player.theplatform.com/p/NnzsPC/widget/select/media/guid/2410887629/3a3a63df8cb39fb1081361a768c174f7" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" seamless="seamless" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

<p><br>
<strong>Movie Night</strong> is a great example of how Moynihan could steal an entire sketch just by singing the Farmers Insurance jingle:</p>

<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170716213919if_/https://www.youtube.com/embed/I6_0BUvxZ68" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>Then there&apos;s <strong>Drunk Uncle</strong> who has made many fun appearances on Weekend Update (including the times he brought <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170716213919/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/07/videos_melissa_mccarthy_hosts_best.php#photo-1">Peter Drunklage</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170716213919/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/29/videos_saturday_night_live_returns_1.php#photo-7">Meth Nephew</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170716213919/http://gothamist.com/2013/12/15/videos_saturday_night_live_4.php#photo-7">Drunker Uncle</a>&#x2014;we&apos;re holding out hope he makes an appearance this weekend): </p>

<p><br>
When he wanted to get physical in a silly sketch such as <strong>American Ninja Warrior</strong>, he was truly committed to his pratfalls:</p>

<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170716213919if_/https://www.youtube.com/embed/sK-iyzpZGPk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>And who could forget Michael Che&apos;s sweet, innocent high school friend Riblet:</p>

<div itemprop="video" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/VideoObject"><iframe src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170716213919if_/http://player.theplatform.com/p/NnzsPC/widget/select/media/guid/2410887629/2866697" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" seamless="seamless" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
