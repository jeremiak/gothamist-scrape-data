<p>It&apos;s the moment we&apos;ve all been waiting for: 3 p.m. on Thursday afternoon! It&apos;s time for morning-turned-evening-turned-afternoon news host Katie Couric to sit down for her exclusive interview with Notre Dame football star Manti Te&apos;o <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160525141712/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/23/manti_teo_admits_he_lied_about_fake.php">about his fake dead girlfriend</a> who never existed despite them falling asleep on the phone ever night. Let&apos;s get this started!</p>

<p><strong>2:55 p.m.</strong>: Missed opportunity: why didn&apos;t ABC do a Te&apos;o/crossover with <em>General Hospital</em>? At least Lennay Kekua could have made a surprise appearance.</p>

<p><strong>3:01 p.m.</strong>: Who else forgot Katie Couric was still on TV?</p>

<p><strong>3:06 p.m.</strong>: &quot;Are you the stupidest man alive? Or just the second stupidest man alive?&quot; That might have not been a direct quote.</p>

<p><strong>3:10 p.m.</strong>: Te&apos;o on his life since December 6th, when he first was told that Kekua wasn&apos;t a real person: &quot;My whole reality was she was dead...and then she was alive.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>3:12 p.m.</strong>: &quot;I wasn&apos;t as forthcoming about it, but I didn&apos;t lie. And I never was asked, &apos;Did you see her in person,&apos;&quot; Te&apos;o said. &quot;Aren&apos;t you splitting hairs a little bit Manti?&quot; Couric really bringing the HEAT now. Te&apos;o says he&apos;s most ashamed that he lies to his father.</p>

<p><strong>3:14 p.m.</strong>: While we&apos;re at commercial break, some updates from this afternoon: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160525141712/http://deadspin.com/5978713/?utm_campaign=socialflow_deadspin_twitter&amp;utm_source=deadspin_twitter&amp;utm_medium=socialflow">You can listen to voicemail messages</a> left on Te&apos;o&apos;s phone by the person he believed was Kekua. Also, alleged hoaxer Ronaiah Tuiasosopo, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160525141712/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/24/manti_teo_hoaxer_admits_he_called_t.php">who admitted he pretended</a> to be a girl on the phone at times, had &quot;intense feelings&quot; for Te&apos;o; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160525141712/http://www.tmz.com/2013/01/24/ronaiah-tuiasosopo-intense-feelings-manti-teo-hoax/">TMZ claims he</a> &quot;never had a serious physical relationship with anyone and created a female persona online as a way to vent his feelings.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>3:20 p.m.</strong>: Te&apos;o explains he wasn&apos;t in a four-year relationship with the fake woman: &quot;I knew of her...she had boyfriends, girls who I knew. It was a friend relationship, but it didn&apos;t start to pick up till my Junior year.&quot; But, &quot;from the pictures she seemed very beautiful.&quot;</p>

<p>Hopefully Couric will ask the question we&apos;re all wondering/dreading: Were they having phone sex?</p>

<p><strong>3:22 p.m.</strong>: Couric asks, &quot;Are you gay?&quot; Awkward laugh from Te&apos;o: &quot;No. Far from it. Faaaaar from it.&quot; Well then.</p>

<p><strong>3:28 p.m.</strong>: &quot;Why in the world didn&apos;t you go visit...the women you called the love of your life?&quot; Couric rightly asks. But they were going to meet during a layover in San Diego! Right before her &quot;accident&quot;! And then she was in a coma! And he was two hours away! And he couldn&apos;t tell his parents he was going to be late!</p>

<p>Couric speaks for us all when she says: &quot;Manti, that really doesnt make sense to me.&quot; He responds: &quot;It doesn&apos;t make sense to me either.&quot; At least he&apos;s definitely being honest now.</p>

<p><strong>3:31 p.m.</strong>: After she &quot;came out of her coma,&quot; Te&apos;o said he &quot;jumped for joy, you know: &apos;she&apos;s out,&apos; &apos;shes talking...&apos; And I was like &apos;see they were right, I do help her.&apos;&quot; Couric: &quot;Either you&apos;re the most naive person on the planet or this is the saddest story ever written.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>3:36 p.m.</strong>: Listening to Kekua&apos;s voicemails. Te&apos;o notes: &quot;It didn&apos;t sound like a man. It...sounded like a woman. If he somehow made that voice, that&apos;s incredible. That&apos;s some incredible talent to do that every single day.&quot;</p>

<p>EXCLUSIVE: Te&apos;o&apos;s sleeping habits revealed. &quot;Whenever I sleep I lock my door.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>3:42 p.m.</strong>: Te&apos;o explains his mindset on December 8th, when he spoke about his dead girlfriend in the press even though he had &quot;talked&quot; to her two days before. &quot;If you say that she&apos;s alive, what would everybody think? And what are you going to tell everybody...who you inspired?&quot;</p>

<p>Te&apos;o told his mother &quot;the truth&quot; on Christmas Day. But first, paper towel commercials!</p>

<p><strong>3:44 p.m.</strong>: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160525141712/https://twitter.com/BuzzFeedSports/status/294545966223220736">Big hat tip to Buzzfeed for this .gif</a> of Te&apos;o&apos;s &quot;Faaaaar from it&quot; moment. </p>

<p><strong>3:50 p.m.</strong>: &quot;I am proud of his character,&quot; said Te&apos;o&apos;s mom. &quot;It just hurts to see, ya know, his picture, his name being displayed as someone that is dishonest.&quot; Te&apos;o has some trouble getting tears to come out, but we can confirm there was snot!</p>

<p>Te&apos;o&apos;s father: &quot;He&apos;s not a liar. He&apos;s a kid. He&apos;s a 21-year-old kid trying to be a man.&quot; When we come back, we&apos;ll discuss what should happen to alleged hoaxer Tuiasosopo. But first a word from our sponsors, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160525141712/http://www.anapolschwartz.com/practices/transvaginal/what-is-transvaginal-mesh.asp">Transvaginal Mesh</a>!</p>

<p><strong>3:56 p.m.</strong>: Couric asks Te&apos;o what he would say to Tuiasosopo if he saw him in person: &quot;I&apos;d just say you hurt me,&quot; Te&apos;o said. &quot;But after that I&apos;d say, hey. draw nearer to your family, because that&apos;s what I did. Aaaaand after one more look at the audience, who are all wearing bright primary colors (seriously: if you want to get a ticket, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160525141712/http://www.katiecouric.com/faq/">you have to</a>), we&apos;re done! </p>
