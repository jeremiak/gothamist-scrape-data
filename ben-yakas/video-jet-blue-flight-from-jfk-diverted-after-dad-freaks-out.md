<p>This has not been a good week for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140617173702/http://gothamist.com/tags/jetblue">JetBlue</a>: first a Massachusetts mom claimed that a flight attendant <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140617173702/http://gothamist.com/2014/06/14/mom_claims_bathroom-barring_jetblue.php">wouldn&apos;t let her daughter go to the toilet</a>, which resulted in the child urinating on herself. Now, a flight from JFK to Las Vegas had to be diverted to Detroit after a passenger royally freaked out. You can see what happened onboard in the video below, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140617173702/http://7online.com/news/exclusive-video-unruly-passenger-causes-jetblue-flight-from-jfk-to-divert/113897/">via ABC.</a></p>

<p>The flight took off around 6:20 a.m. on Saturday from JFK. It&apos;s unclear exactly what prompted the incident, but ABC notes the man was traveling with family members, and was apparently yelling at them; at one point, a woman believed to be his daughter yells, &quot;Dad, stop!&quot; Flight attendants had to break out the zip-ties (though <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140617173702/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/05/uruly_passenger_groped_and_choked_b.php">not any duct tape</a>) to restrain him. After they landed, the man was transported via police custody to Oakwood Hospital. </p>

<p>ABC adds one other passenger&apos;s terrifying theory of what might have happened: &quot;One passenger said <strong>it seemed as if the man was sleeping and woke up in a nightmare and lost his mind</strong>.&quot; So that totally won&apos;t make us anxious next time we fly, nope.</p>
