<p>Last year, a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140216072242/http://gothamist.com/tags/beastieboys">Beastie Boys</a> superfan <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140216072242/http://gothamist.com/2013/12/18/should_there_be_a_beastie_boys_squa.php">started a campaign</a> to rename an area in the Lower East Side &quot;Beastie Boys Square.&quot; LeRoy McCarthy chose the intersection of Ludlow and Rivington Streets (currently the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140216072242/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/22/nyregion/in-area-saturated-with-bars-a-proposal-to-add-one-more-draws-opposition.html">epicenter</a> of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140216072242/http://ny.curbed.com/archives/2006/11/16/introducing_hell_square.php">Hell Square</a>) for the honor because the cover of <em>Paul&apos;s Boutique</em> was taken at 99 Rivington Street. And the local community board will vote on the name this week, so here&apos;s your chance to get it together and make some noise for your favorite band.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140216072242/http://nypost.com/2014/01/12/push-to-rename-corner-beastie-boy-square/">The Post says</a> that CB3 will consider the name this Tuesday, but according <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140216072242/http://www.nyc.gov/html/mancb3/html/calendar/calendar.shtml">to the city&apos;s website</a>, the meeting (which is open to the public) is happening Wednesday at 6:30 p.m. at University Settlement at Houston Street Center (located at 273 Bowery). </p>

<p>McCarthy has collected over a thousand signatures so far <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140216072242/https://www.change.org/petitions/beastie-boys-square">via an online petition.</a> If it passes the CB, it&apos;ll then have to be approved by the City Council. But McCarthy isn&apos;t too worried, what with the council members&apos; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140216072242/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/31/john_liu_enjoys_watching_brad_pitt.php">historically diverse tastes</a>: &quot;They [City Council] are knowledgeable of hip hop, a lot of them were raised on hip hop &#x2014; at their Sweet Sixteen parties and bar mitzvahs &#x2014; so you don&#x2019;t have to explain to them who Biggie Smalls was. They don&#x2019;t necessarily have the preconceived negative approach to all hip hop.&quot;<br>
