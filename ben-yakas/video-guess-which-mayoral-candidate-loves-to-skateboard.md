                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="81113liu1.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928014046im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/81113liu1.jpg" width="640" height="426"> <br> <i> It&apos;s Liu!</i></div> <p></p>

<p>Current NYC Comptroller <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928014046/http://gothamist.com/tags/johnliu">John Liu</a> hasn&apos;t been able to inspire the headlines that fellow mayoral candidates Anthony Weiner and Christine Quinn have; he doesn&apos;t take the sorts of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928014046/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/09/best_photo_of_nyc_2013_candidate_wi.php">goofy photos</a> that make John Catsamatidis endearing (albeit in a Garbage Pail Kids kind of way); he hasn&apos;t <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928014046/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/10/de_blasio_yeah_that_guy_running_for.php">gotten himself arrested</a> and he hasn&apos;t had a sex scandal (as far as we know). Really, the most interesting thing about Liu us that he thinks <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928014046/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/31/john_liu_enjoys_watching_brad_pitt.php"><em>Troy</em> is a great movie</a>. He&apos;s kind of boring (give or take a federal campaign finance scandal). But can any of those other candidates do an ollie?</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928014046/http://livewire.talkingpointsmemo.com/entry/nyc-mayoral-candidate-rides-reporters-skateboard-video">According to Hunter Walker</a> of Talking Points Memo, Liu borrowed the reporter&apos;s skateboard and took it for a spin outside the They Might Be Giants concert at the Prospect Park Bandshell in Brooklyn Saturday night. It seems Liu was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928014046/http://politicker.com/2012/12/the-way-they-were-mayoral-candidates-in-high-school/#slide3">an avid skateboarder</a> in his youth (his yearbook quote includes: &quot;Keep on running and/or rolling.&quot;), though Liu admitted he hadn&apos;t been on one in awhile.</p>

<p>Of course, Liu would probably have to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928014046/http://gothamist.com/tags/subwayskateboarding">subway skateboard</a> to really make some headway with the all important 11-17 voting demographic, but it still adds a bit of personality. So at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928014046/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/09/comptroller_battle_2013_what_questi.php">the next Comptroller debate</a>, the real question is: do either Eliot Spitzer or Scott Stringer have the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928014046/http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=steeze">steeze</a> to lead? </p>
