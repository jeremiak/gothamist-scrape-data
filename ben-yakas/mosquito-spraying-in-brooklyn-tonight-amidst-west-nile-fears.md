<p>There&apos;s only been one reported human case of the West Nile virus this year in New York City&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407165459/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/26/first_2012_human_west_nile_infectio.php">on Staten Island</a>&#x2014;but with one of the largest-ever national outbreaks of West Nile around the country, health officials are hedging their bets all over. And with West Nile having been detected <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407165459/http://gothamist.com/2012/08/10/west_nile_now_detected_in_all_five.php">in all five boroughs</a>, the city has been spraying neighborhoods with high or increasing mosquito populations&#x2014;and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407165459/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/West-Nile-Nassau-County-Outbreak-Virus-Mosquito-167164175.html">that&apos;ll include various parts of Brooklyn tonight.</a></p>

<p>Health officials will spray Marine Park, Flatlands, Georgetown, Canarsie, East Flatbush, Mills Basin, Mills Island, Spring Creek, and Starrett City. The spraying is expected to begin at 8 p.m. tonight, and last through 6 a.m. Friday&#x2014;residents are advised to stay indoors during spraying.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407165459/http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvbid/westnile/USGS_frame.html">According to the CDC</a>, 1,118 illnesses have been reported so far this year, about half of them in Texas. In an average year, fewer than 300 cases are reported by mid-August. There have also been 41 deaths this year. Since it was first detected in the U.S., 252 New Yorkers have been diagnosed with West Nile Virus.</p>

<p>Don&apos;t be surprised if this isn&apos;t the last spraying in Brooklyn: as you can see in the report above, the West Nile Virus has been detected in zip codes covering Prospect Heights, Prospect Park, Park Slope, Windsor Terrace, and Bushwick.
