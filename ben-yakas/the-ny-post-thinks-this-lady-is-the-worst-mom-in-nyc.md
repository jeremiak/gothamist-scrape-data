<p>We&apos;ve come across a lot of potential candidates for &quot;worst mom&quot; in our time&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151031153727/http://gothamist.com/tags/patriciakrentcil">tan mom</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151031153727/http://gothamist.com/2011/07/21/video_woman_lets_baby_in_stroller_r.php">stroller fight mom</a> come to mind&#x2014;but the NY Post&apos;s highly qualified team of experts on horribleness (no doubt <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151031153727/http://gothamist.com/tags/andreapeyser">Andrea Peyser</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151031153727/http://www.nypost.com/p/entertainment/tv/new_girl_on_top_mBHbR1rcwafv9yieVNDWfN?utm_source=SFnewyorkpost&amp;utm_medium=SFnewyorkpost">Linda Stasi</a> sit on the board of directors) have crunched the numbers and pointed their finger at Dara-Lynn Weiss. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151031153727/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/opinion/opedcolumnists/is_this_nyc_worst_mom_YCxLTNf3mrWVRLBeST8NiL">Their rhetorical headline</a> asks: &quot;Is this NYC&apos;s worst mom?&quot; So our question is: does Weiss, let alone any woman, deserve such unpleasant notoriety? Or is she really <em>that</em> terrible?</p>

<p>In case the name isn&apos;t instantly familiar, Weiss is the mom who wrote a controversial article for Vogue about putting her 7-year-old daughter on a diet, exposing her own warts-and-all unhealthy relationship with food in the process. It came complete with a glamorous photograph of herself and her daughter (see above). That article led to widespread outrage on the web&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151031153727/http://jezebel.com/5895602/mom-puts-7+year+old-on-a-diet-in-the-worst-vogue-article-ever">Jezebel called her</a>, &#x201C;The most fucked up, selfish woman to ever grace the magazine&apos;s pages&#x201D;&#x2014;but it also led to a book deal for Weiss, who wrote the memoir, &quot;The Heavy: A Mother, A Daughter, A Diet.&quot;</p>

<p>This has, in turn, led to more interviews for Weiss, and more accusations that she is exploiting her daughter (having already toxically influenced her self-image) for fame and profit. In one such interview <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151031153727/http://parenting.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/01/15/the-heavy-a-mom-a-7-year-old-and-a-diet/">with the Times</a>, Weiss says she thinks her daughter &quot;should be proud&quot; of her weight loss, and reflects on the controversy around her article:</p>

<blockquote>It&#x2019;s true that after I read all of what came after I wrote the article, I didn&#x2019;t feel like working on the book again for a while. But I came to realize that I was letting myself be scared into silence. The backlash was part of the whole reason I wanted the conversation to continue.

<p>People are so critical of childhood obesity, and then you try to do something about it &#x2014; to help your child &#x2014; and they&#x2019;re critical of that, too. Parents can&#x2019;t win. I wanted to stick up for Bea and myself and my family and our choices. And I did get a lot of support and gratitude from other parents who are actually in our position, so I felt a bit of an obligation to put something out there that they could relate to about dealing with an obese child. It&#x2019;s not so easy.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>Of course, that damned if you do/damned if you don&apos;t attitude has already been dissected by others, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151031153727/http://gawker.com/5896526/one-way-to-get-a-book-deal-these-days-is-to-starve-and-humiliate-your-child">such as Gawker</a>, who pointed out that the problem with the original piece wasn&apos;t that she took action about her daughter&apos;s obesity, but rather the very public way in which she did: &quot;You are certainly damned if you don&apos;t destroy your kid&apos;s self esteem forever and publish it in a magazine dedicated to deifying anorexia. What choice do you even have?&quot;</p>

<p>The NY Post take a decidedly negative view of the Vogue photoshoot: &quot;So Weiss shamed her daughter as fat in the pages of a national magazine, held the child &#x2014; and herself &#x2014; up to ridicule and scorn. But at least she got that book deal.&quot; They also chide her for wanting to keep her daughter out of it now that she&#x2019;s going on the talk-show circuit, which they call too-little too-late. </p>

<p>In another interview <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151031153727/http://nymag.com/thecut/2013/01/vogue-diet-mom-dara-lynn-weiss-speaks.html">with NY Magazine</a>, Weiss defended her decision to help her daughter &quot;take responsibility&quot; for her own body, saying her daughter was proud of her &quot;achievement:&quot;</p>

<blockquote>I stand by the assertion that obesity is bad, but not because it makes you look bad. Someone can be heavy and healthy and that&#x2019;s great and that&#x2019;s fine. In some ways, I don&#x2019;t think that we should extend body acceptance to situations where the child is unhealthy. For Bea, her blood pressure was high. She went from a normal to a high blood pressure in a year and gained twenty pounds. It was something that was very immediately affecting her health. 

<p>I understand the desire to make a child feel beautiful at any weight. I truly advocate for size acceptance. The culture of body image upsets me and has tortured me personally. I do think we should be able to be different sizes but I draw the line at when it starts affecting her health. I always hear from parents who have overweight kids, &#x201C;I would never say a word to my child about her weight.&#x201D; I don&#x2019;t know that that&#x2019;s the way to preserve a child&#x2019;s self-esteem. The openness and the loving, humorous, supportive way we deal with this issue, I hope, will create an environment where food and weight are not shameful secret things we can&apos;t talk about as a family.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>There&apos;s no denying that there are a lot of complicated, contradicting elements to Weiss&apos; story&#x2014;on the one hand, Weiss was following doctor&apos;s and nutritionist&apos;s recommendations to put her daughter on a diet, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151031153727/http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20666079,00.html">was encouraging her</a> to lose weight by &quot;reducing processed food, increasing fruits and vegetables, and getting a little more exercise.&quot; At the same time, there were the excerpts about her having meltdowns in Starbucks, and her troubling need to push her daughter into the limelight from the start. As a mother <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151031153727/http://nymag.com/thecut/2012/03/mom-reacts-vogues-fat-7-year-old-girl-story.html?imw=">writing at The Cut</a> put it, Weiss&apos; &quot;obsessive narcissism&quot; is what disturbed so many moms. But do you think it warrants &quot;worst mom in NYC&quot; status? </p>
