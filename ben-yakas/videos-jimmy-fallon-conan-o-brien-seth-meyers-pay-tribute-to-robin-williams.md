<p>Although a lot of late night show hosts are on vacation/in reruns this week (namely Jon Stewart, Stephen Colbert, David Letterman, and Jimmy Kimmel), Jimmy Fallon, Conan O&apos;Brien and Seth Meyers are all on air this week&#x2014;and they all paid emotional tribute last night to Robin Williams a day after he was found <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506142952/http://sfist.com/2014/08/11/breaking_robin_williams_dead_at_age.php">dead at 63.</a> </p>

<p>&quot;You&apos;d watch him and you would cry laughing,&quot; Jimmy Fallon said. &quot;And you would think, &apos;I&apos;m never going to see anyone like this human, ever.&apos; It&apos;s just amazing. His brain was always thinking 10 steps ahead of what he was saying. He was like the Muhammad Ali of comedy.&quot; After showing a clip of Williams&apos;s first-ever <em>Tonight Show</em> appearance with Johnny Carson, Fallon ended his segment by standing on his desk (<em>Dead Poet&apos;s Society</em> style) and saying, &quot;O Captain, My Captain&#x2014;you will be missed.&quot;</p>

<p>Conan O&apos;Brien, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506142952/http://laist.com/2014/08/12/video_stunned_conan_obrien_tells_au.php">who was taping his show</a> when he learned the news of his death on Monday evening, told an anecdote about Williams buying him a bike when he was &quot;feeling low&quot; a few years ago due (likely during <em>The Tonight Show</em> brouhaha). </p>

<p>&quot;Out of the blue, Robin Williams buys me a bicycle,&quot; O&apos;Brien said. &quot;It was the most absurd bright orange and bright green bicycle with shamrocks on it. So I called him up and all he could say was, &apos;Does it look ridiculous? Will you look stupid riding it?&apos; He had just that amazing spirit of fun.&quot;</p>

<p>And Seth Meyers also paid tribute, putting an emphasis on the need for more discussions about mental health issues: &quot;The saddest part of this is Robin was battling depression. And if there&apos;s anything we can do to honor his memory, I would hope it would be to use this opportunity to educate us more about this terrible affliction,&quot; Meyers said.</p>
