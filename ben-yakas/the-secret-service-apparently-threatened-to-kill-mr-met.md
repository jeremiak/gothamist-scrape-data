<p>As everyone already knows, Mr. Met is the most beloved mascot in all of sports. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428180622/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/02/duh_mr_met_is_the_consensus_best_ma.php">It&apos;s a fact</a>! Sometimes he&apos;s the only good thing about the Mets! So it boggles the mind to think that back in the late &apos;90s, a Secret Service agent allegedly threatened to kill Mr. Met, bringer of joy to the entire world, if he came too close to President Bill Clinton.</p>

<p>A.J. Mass, who inhabited the spirit of Mr. Met from 1994 to 1997, recounts the experience in his new memoir, &quot;Yes, It&#x2019;s Hot in Here: Adventures in the Weird, Woolly World of Sports Mascots.&quot; Clinton was at Shea Stadium in April 1997 for the 50th anniversary of Jackie Robinson breaking MLB&#x2019;s color barrier. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428180622/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2014/04/17/ex-mr-met-says-secret-service-warned-him-of-kill-shot/">CBS has the important quotes:</a></p>

<blockquote>&#x201C;Now listen to me very carefully. &#x2026; We have snipers all around the stadium, just in case something were to happen,&#x201D; a Secret Service agent told Mass, according to a book excerpt making the rounds. &#x201C;Like I said, do whatever it is you normally do. Nobody will bother you. But approach the president, and we go for the kill shot. Are we clear?&#x201D;

<p>The former Mr. Met wrote that it felt like the agent wasn&#x2019;t &#x201C;only looking into my eyes, but also into my very soul with his blank, unblinking stare.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Then another warning, for good measure.</p>

<p>&#x201C;Approach the president, and we go for the kill shot,&#x201D; the agent told Mass. &#x201C;ARE-WE-CLEAR?&#x201D;</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>There&apos;s only one logical explanation for the inhumane treatment Mr. Met received: the Secret Service agent was forced to threaten Mr. Met because his family was being held by Mr. Met&apos;s greatest foe, the Philly Fanatic.</p>
