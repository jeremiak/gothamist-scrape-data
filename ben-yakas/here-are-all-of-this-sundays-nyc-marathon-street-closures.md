<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161119020001/http://gothamist.com/tags/marathon">NYC Marathon</a> is happening this Sunday, and the NYPD will be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161119020001/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/04/election_terror_threat.php">on high alert.</a> &quot;There are scores of officers in plainclothes that you will not be able to see,&quot; NYPD Chief Carlos Gomez <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161119020001/http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2016/11/2/lined-up--nyc-marathon-finish-line-down-as-nypd-ups-security-presence.html">said this week</a>. &quot;They will be mixing in with the crowds. These are officers that are especially trained to detect hostile activity.&quot; </p>

<p>The marathon kicks off at 8:30 a.m., as it always does, in Staten Island before moving up through Brooklyn, Queens, and Manhattan, making a quick trip to the Bronx, and finally terminating at the south end of Central Park. If you don&apos;t have any horse (or human) in the race, you may want to avoid going out too far (especially above midtown in Manhattan), but if you do have friends and family to cheer on (or you just like cheering on people in general), here are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161119020001/http://running.competitor.com/2016/11/new-york-city-marathon/the-on-the-course-spectators-guide-to-the-nyc-marathon_158152">some tips on where to go.</a></p>
