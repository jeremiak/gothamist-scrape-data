And as you can see from the gallery above, we think it was a <em>tremendogs</em> success. Not only are most of these dogs best of breeds&#x2014;we&apos;re pretty sure they&apos;re scientifically manufactured to make your cute glands swell to <em>awwwwwwwful</em> proportions.</p>

<p>This was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502175232/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/15/photos_behind_the_scenes_at_the_wes.php#photo-1">our second year</a> embedding ourselves in the leash-and-collar wasteland of prize dogs, well-maintained cages, prissy groomers, no-nonsense handlers, absentee owners, besuited judges, and camera-wielding aficionados. We spoke to many of the owners as the day progressed, and were surprised by how many of the puppies were used to this attention&#x2014;and how their owners (or handlers) were fine with strangers coming over and cramming their by turns mustachioed and perfume-drenched faces into the dogs&apos; faces. </p>

<p>The lives of these well-behaved dogs are surprisingly busy&#x2014;most are in dozens of competitions and showings a year, all en route to ribbons, trophies, and hard-earned treats they all deserve. Kathleen Adams, the groomer of 2-year-old Angel, a toy poodle originally from Houston, Texas, told us, &quot;We&apos;re like gypsies&#x2014;we go everywhere.&quot; They had competed in Arkansas, Louisiana, and Florida in recent months alone. </p>

<p>Even the promise or retirement can be a miasma: handler Mandy Carlson told us that her Shih Tzu, 2 1/2-year-old Looker, was the #1 shih tzu in 2012, and won best of shih tzu breed at Westminster. But this was to be her last showing...in America. Looker&apos;s owner plans on taking her to be shown in Taipei after Westminster.</p>

<p>Click through to check out 32 of our favorite pups&#x2014;and don&apos;t forget to also check out the dog we kind of tried to buy, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502175232/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/12/photos_meet_swagger_the_best-in-sho.php#photo-1">Swagger</a>. If you recognize any of the breeds that we missed above, let us know. And we&apos;ll have more Westminster coverage, including a behind-the-scenes look at the (ridiculous) process of dogs being groomed, soon.</p>
