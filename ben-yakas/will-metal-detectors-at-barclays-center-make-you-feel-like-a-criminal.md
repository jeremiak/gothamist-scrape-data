<p>The grand opening of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170325165048/http://gothamist.com/tags/barclayscenter">Barclays Center</a> is only three months away, which means everyone has to start dotting their i&apos;s and crossing their t&apos;s. At a round table meeting between state and Barclays Center officials and community organizations last night, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170325165048/http://parkslope.patch.com/articles/live-blog-barclays-center-operations-round-table-discussion-at-borough-hall">it was revealed that</a> Barclays would have walk-through metal detectors. &#x201C;I was considering getting season tickets, but I don&#x2019;t want to feel like a criminal when I go to a game,&#x201D; longtime fan Robert Master <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170325165048/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/barclays_metal_detectors_dWexsa5OZbXOaaqsXruNRI?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Brooklyn">told the Post</a>. &#x201C;They don&#x2019;t even have metal detectors at [the Nets former home] Prudential Center, and crime is much worse in Newark than Brooklyn.&#x201D; </p>

<p>The Post calls it &quot;a stunning diss to the Borough of Kings,&quot; pointing out that no other sporting venue in the tristate area has them. &quot;This is new technology that is more efficient, more effective, and less intrusive than a wand,&quot; Barclays Center spokesman Barry Baum <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170325165048/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20120627/prospect-heights/barclays-center-will-have-metal-detectors-patdowns">told DNAInfo</a>. &quot;We take security very seriously and these detectors will allow us to most effectively screen arena visitors.&quot;</p>

<p>Borough President Marty Markowitz has previously said he would &#x201C;vehemently oppose&#x201D; use of metal detectors as standard operating procedure. But Robert Sena, director of security for the 18,200-seat arena, added that this really is no big deal: &#x201C;This is not going to be like the airport,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;No one is going to ask to you to take off your shoes and belt.&#x201D; And yet, he conspicuously doesn&apos;t say anything about whether they <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170325165048/http://gothamist.com/2010/11/24/bloomberg_get_over_yourself_and_let.php">might try to touch your junk.</a></p>
