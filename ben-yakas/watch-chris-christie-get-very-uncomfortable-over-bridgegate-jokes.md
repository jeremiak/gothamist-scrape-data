<p>It may shock you to learn that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503154334/http://gothamist.com/tags/chrischristie">Gov. Chris Christie</a>, who has been known to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503154334/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2544378/Vindictive-p-k-Chris-Christie-accused-THIRD-political-revenge-act-Democrats-say-shut-DMV-office-fourth-largest-NJ-city-opposed-him.html">rain hellfire</a> upon his enemies for slights both real and imagined, is not exactly thin-skinned when it comes to jokes at this expense. Christie didn&apos;t fair so well when he hosted a charity roast of former NJ Gov. Brendan Byrne on April 1st, with comedians including Joe Piscopo and Joy Behar at the event. And when Behar turned attention toward Christie and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503154334/http://gothamist.com/tags/bridgegate">Bridgegate</a>, things got awfully uncomfortable awfully fast. Watch as Christie attempts to keep his hands occupied by drinking all the water in the world instead of throttling Behar.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503154334/http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2014/04/14/140414fa_fact_lizza">In the most recent <em>New Yorker</em></a>, writer Adam Lizza evaluates Christie&apos;s political state post-Bridgegate, and starts with this anecdote about the roast:</p>

<blockquote>Joy Behar, the former co-host of &#x201C;The View,&#x201D; was even more pointed. &#x201C;When I first heard that he was accused of blocking off three lanes on the bridge, I said, &#x2018;What the hell is he doing, standing in the middle of the bridge?&#x201D; After another barb, Christie interrupted her. &#x201C;This is a Byrne roast,&#x201D; he said. He stood up and tried to grab her notes. The audience laughed awkwardly. &#x201C;Stop bullying me,&#x201D; Behar said as he sat down. Christie said something out of earshot and Behar responded, &#x201C;Why don&#x2019;t you get up here at the microphone instead of being such a coward?&#x201D; Christie stood up again and moved in front of the lectern as Behar retreated.&#x202F; &#x201C;At least I don&#x2019;t get paid for this,&#x201D; he said.

<p>Christie sat down and Behar continued, though she was noticeably rattled. &#x201C;I really don&#x2019;t know about the Presidency,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;Let me put it to you this way, in a way that you&#x2019;d appreciate: You&#x2019;re toast.&#x201D;</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>Here&apos;s another, slightly more clear look at the awkwardness, this time bookended by an absolutely <em>delighted</em> Chris Matthews who giddily declares, <strong>&quot;&apos;Don&apos;t bully me,&apos; that&apos;s right up there with, &apos;Don&apos;t taze me, bro!&apos;&quot;</strong></p>
