<p>Labor Day Weekend is the symbolic end of the summer, the time of year when beaches begin <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150409161656/http://gothamist.com/2014/08/30/this_is_your_last_chance_to_head_to.php">shuttering their shores</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150409161656/http://gothamist.com/2014/08/29/f_u_summer_friday.php">bitter screeds about Summer Fridays</a> go the way of the dodo. The long weekend provides the chance for a moment of reflection for millions of overworked, underpaid, <em>Simpsons</em>-marathoning Americans.
