<p>Six British rugby players <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131128063656/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/brit_rugby_rats_charged_in_cop_assault_Pej8FC1XMg8Bxy4k98B5zL?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Manhattan">were arrested and charged with assaulting and robbing</a> an off-duty cop and his friend in Manhattan this week. Officer Arif Tasoren, 33, claims the fight started when he and his friend were chatting to a woman at Murray Hill sports bar Mercury Bar around 4 a.m. on Friday. When Tasoren identified himself, one of the players allegedly responded, &quot;We don&#x2019;t care,&quot; while another allegely said, &#x201C;Fuck the police!&#x201D;</p>

<p>Tasoren suffered a fractured nose, a swollen jaw, and cuts to the inside of his mouth that required stitches. The players, who are all from the 1st Battalion of the Royal Regiment of Scotland, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131128063656/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2408431/Six-British-soldiers-charged-duty-New-York-policeman-beaten-bar-brawl-row-girl.html">have been identified</a> as Iosefo Yavala, Iliakini Raderua, Thomas Shute, Felite Vunisarati, Mosese Kuruala and Joeli Raduva. The players are currently on an East Coast exhibition tour, and had just played the NYPD in a rugby match.</p>

<p>All six men were charged with assault; Yavala, a lance corporal, is also accused of stealing the cop&#x2019;s cellphone during the incident. The rugby players, who are all of Fijian origin, claim the off-duty officer and his friend started the fight by referring to one of them as a &#x201C;black bastard.&#x201D; &#x201C;They claim they did so [brawled] after he made a racist remark,&#x201D; said defense lawyer Robert Fisher.</p>
