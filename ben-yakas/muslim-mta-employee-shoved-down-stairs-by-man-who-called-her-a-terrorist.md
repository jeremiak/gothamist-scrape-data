<p>An off-duty Muslim MTA employee was assaulted and harassed by a man at Grand Central this morning who called her a &quot;terrorist.&quot;</p>

<p>The incident happened around 6:20 a.m. this morning, when the 45-year-old victim, an unnamed off-duty Transit employee, was in her uniform and on her way to work. The woman, who was wearing a hijab, was aboard the 7 train when the suspect started yelling at her: &quot;You&#x2019;re a terrorist and you shouldn&#x2019;t be working for the city.&quot;</p>

<p>When they got off the train, the man followed her into the station. The suspect then pushed her down the stairs, injuring both her ankle and knee. The employee was transported to NYU Langone Hospital for treatment, while the suspect fled the scene. No arrests have been made and the investigation is ongoing.</p>

<p>This bias incident comes on the heels of several other similarly alarming ones in recent weeks: over the weekend, a Brooklyn man <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161207143541/http://gothamist.com/2016/12/04/off-duty_muslim_nypd_officer_told_t.php">allegedly yelled xenophobic insults</a> at an off-duty Muslim NYPD officer and her teenage son. Last week, three men <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161207143541/http://gothamist.com/2016/12/02/trumps_amerikkka.php">attacked and harassed</a> a Muslim woman, calling her a terrorist and repeatedly shouting &quot;Donald Trump!&quot; at her. </p>

<p>Gov. Andrew Cuomo released a statement about these incidents today</p>

<blockquote>This is the great state of New York - we welcome people of all cultures, customs and creeds with open arms. We do not allow intolerance or fear to divide us because we know diversity is our strength and we are at our best when we stand united. I have directed the MTA, State Police and Division of Human Rights to work with local law enforcement to investigate these matters. These acts of hate will be pursued and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law, and those responsible will be held accountable.

<p>New York will continue to set the example for the nation - safeguarding our diversity and our differences, and rooting out bigotry and hatred wherever it exists. The work of the Hate Crimes Task Force has never been more urgent and we will continue to crack down on this type of criminal behavior. I wish a speedy recovery for the victim, and want to let her know we are seeking justice for her and for all New Yorkers.</p></blockquote><p></p>
