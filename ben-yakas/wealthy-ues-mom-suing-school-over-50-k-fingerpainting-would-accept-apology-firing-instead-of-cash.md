<p>Over the weekend, we reached peak rich people problems when a wealthy Upper East Side couple <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130807020228/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/30/socialite_parents_sue_school_for_tr.php">sued the Cathedral School of St. John the Divine for $415K</a> after the school allegedly tricked them into bidding on a 30-by-30-inch finger-painting by a classroom of kindergartners, rigged the auction, and stuck them with a $50K bill for it. Now, socialite Michelle Marie Heinemann <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130807020228/http://www.nypost.com/p/pagesix/she_drop_suit_for_apology_Bqqt8KByCypFmiYmlZe8xH?utm_source=SFnewyorkpost&amp;utm_medium=SFnewyorkpost">tells the Post that</a> in lieu of the $415K, she would accept a sincere apology from the school...as well as the firings of at least two staff members. </p>

<p>&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t want a dime from the school,&#x201D; she told them. &#x201C;I want them to acknowledge their egregious conduct. I loved giving to the school. But I don&#x2019;t want it to be in a plot or a scheme.&#x201D; So she wants the school to fire the administrator and teacher allegedly behind that plot.</p>

<p>To sum up said scheme: Heinemann felt her son Hudson Cornelius Heinemann was being &quot;underappreciated&quot; at the school, relegated to the role of &#x2018;door-holder&#x2019; among other things. To get him the appreciation he deserved, Heinemann agreed to donate extra money, help Hudson&#x2019;s class create a sellable work of art, and buy said art at auction for $3K. Except she claims the administrator and teacher drove up the auction to $50K.</p>

<p>With all the attention the lawsuit got, it&apos;s no wonder Heinemann wanted to roll things back a bit with the Post, and try to downplay that huge $415K figure (compensation which includes Hudson&#x2019;s $60,000-a-year chauffeur). So much of the Post article is a list of Heinemann&apos;s previous philanthropic efforts (donating to charities Prize4Life and Southampton Hospital and founded Blankets for Warmth). </p>

<p>Personally, we&apos;re a bit more interested in her artwork (she does refer to herself as a &quot;renowned artist&quot; in the lawsuit). Based on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130807020228/http://www.blacktiemagazine.com/michelle_marie_revised.pdf">this Black Tie Magazine piece</a>, it seems she has <em>A Beautiful Mind</em>-like relationship with triangles.</p>
