<p>Over the course of modern history, our finest food scientists have struggled to keep up with humankind&apos;s demand for more and more elaborate pizzas to sate our desire for cheese-tomato-bread hybrids. That has led to the creation of pizza-adjacent concoctions both brilliant and wildly misguided, from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170615203251/http://gothamist.com/2015/05/28/pizza_on_pizza_pr0n.php">Inception Pizza</a> to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170615203251/http://gothamist.com/2016/05/23/hawaiian_pizza_trend_nyc.php">Hawaiian Pizza</a>, from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170615203251/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/29/russian_nesting_doll_pizza.php">Russian Nesting Doll Pizza</a> to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170615203251/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/14/pizza_bagel_secret_recipe.php">Pizza Bagels.</a> Now, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170615203251/http://sofiapizzashoppe.com/">Sofia Pizza Shoppe</a> has jumped into the pizza wars with their own contribution, one that substitutes pizza innovation for pizza exclusivity: the $38 pizza.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170615203251/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/02/dining/pizza-expensive-sofia-shoppe-nyc.html?smid=tw-nytfood&amp;smtyp=cur&amp;_r=0">The Times has a story</a> on the Sutton Place pizzeria&apos;s $38 pizza, which requires <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170615203251/https://www.eventbrite.com/e/the-doughdicitm-experience-tickets-33848417528">an online ticket purchase</a> and is available only a few nights each week (for a limited number of seatings). The pie, which has been compared to a souffl&#xE9; due to its fluffiness, is called DoughDici; the Times describes it as &quot;a two-inch-tall, puffy-crust pizza with a crisp edge and a blanket of red sauce, fresh mozzarella and grated cheeses.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;We didn&#x2019;t set out to create a pizza event, but once we realized that we wanted it to be an in-house-only pie to best ensure quality, we decided it needed to be a bit more experiential,&quot; Thomas DeGrezia, one of the co-owners of the shop, told them. &quot;Since our shop is so small, we added the stools, reservations and drinks.&quot; </p>

<p>The reason the pizza is so costly, they say, is because the dough is cold-fermented for three days before it is allowed to rise in a oil-lined pan with grated cheese for 12 hours (this provides the fluffy dough for the six-slice pizza). In addition, they use imported flours, &quot;imported, unfiltered, organic Sicilian olive oil,&quot; and four different kinds of cheese. Included in the price are two nonalcoholic drinks as well.</p>

<p>So when you break it down, six slices for $38 is just over $6 a slice, which is still expensive, but it is not close to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170615203251/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/21/1000-pizza-ninos-pizza-new-york-city_n_1615538.html">Caviar Pizza</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170615203251/http://pix11.com/2016/12/31/is-this-the-most-expensive-pizza-in-nyc/">24-Karat Gold Leaf Pizza</a>-levels of decadent. But the price is expected to go up (DeGrezia noted, &quot;It&#x2019;s just way too much work for the price. It&#x2019;s not going to skyrocket, but it is going to be a bit more&quot;) and seating is limited, so make sure to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170615203251/https://www.eventbrite.com/e/the-doughdicitm-experience-tickets-33848417528">book a time here</a> if you want to take the plunge.</p>
