<p>A man is presumed dead, and a woman has been hospitalized after two people attempted suicide off of the George Washington Bridge in separate incidents within minutes of each other on Friday. A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503154721/http://www.nj.com/bergen/index.ssf/2014/04/woman_stopped_from_jump_minute_after_man_plunges_off_george_washington_bridge_police_say.html">Port Authority spokesman says</a> that a 29-year-old South American man was spotted jumping off the south pathway of the bridge on the NJ side just after 7 p.m. yesterday. Harbor police are still searching for the man&apos;s body.</p>

<p>About a minute after that happened, a 24-year-old woman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503154721/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/1-presumed-dead-1-hospitalized-unrelated-gw-bridge-jumps-article-1.1754171">stopped a car in traffic</a> also on the NJ side, got out and climbed over a north walkway railing. Two motorists got out and grabbed her before she jumped: &#x201C;The good Samaritans definitely got there and went above and beyond,&#x201D; said PA spokesman Joe Pentangelo.</p>

<p>The woman, who had several packets of heroin on her, was hospitalized, and could face drug charges. </p>
