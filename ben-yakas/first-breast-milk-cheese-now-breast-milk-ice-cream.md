<p>Last year, there was a whole hullabaloo after news spread that Chef <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602125347/http://gothamist.com/tags/danielangerer">Daniel Angerer</a> had crafted a cheese out of breast milk; but after the controversy blew over, others started getting in on the breast milk market <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602125347/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/12/breast_milk_cheese_its_baaaaack.php">this year</a>. And now, a restaurant in London has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602125347/http://www.slashfood.com/2011/02/24/breast-milk-ice-cream-would-you-try-it/">started selling</a> breast milk ice cream, which is being served to customers in a cocktail glass. Does this mean Andrea Peyser is blessed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602125347/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/11/breast_milk_cheese_again.php">with precognition</a>?</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602125347/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1360225/Baby-Gaga-Breast-milk-ice-cream-sold-London-restaurant-Icecreamists.html">the Daily Mail</a>, Covent Garden-based Icecreamists have named the &#xA3;14 dish Baby Gaga, the name of which translates to &quot;spawn of Lady Gaga.&quot; The drink, which is a combination of breast milk and Madagascan vanilla with lemon zest, is served with liquid nitrogen by specially costumed Baby Gaga waitresses. Icecreamists <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602125347/http://twitter.com/theicecreamists/status/41205702064226305">calls it</a> a &quot;a storm in a D cup.&quot;</p>

<p>The first 50 servings of the delicacy were provided by 35-year-old Victoria Hiley, who gave 30 ounces of milk; but since the first servings have already <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602125347/http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?pid=8711083&amp;l=bdd173a824&amp;id=121161622737">sold out</a>, the restaurant desperately needs more women to provide milk (13 others have since volunteered). They are offering &#xA3;15 for every ten ounces of breast milk&#x2014;will this inevitably result in farms where women are kept in pens and attached to machines? Will it go from &quot;meat is murder&quot; to &quot;breasts are murder&quot;? We also wonder if this is the first step toward a whole industry of breast milk dairy products&#x2014;breast milk butter, breast milk heavy cream, breast milk whipped cream, the possibilities are endless!</p>

<p>If it does come to America, maybe the IRS will agree to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602125347/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/11/business/11breast.html?_r=1">give tax breaks</a> to women who donate breast milk. But an amused Chef Angerer told us he doesn&apos;t think it will get to America, because &quot;people have issues with human fluids.&quot; He added that his breast milk frommage only started as an experiment for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602125347/http://chefdanielangerer.typepad.com/chef_daniel_angerers_blog/whats-new/">his blog</a>, and said he wasn&apos;t tempted to get back into the breast milk business: &quot;Am I gonna serve it in my restaurant? Absolutely not.&quot;</p>
