<p>Everyday, there seems like there&apos;s another survey or study explaining why you hate your body, whether you&apos;re <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150825232629/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/13/we_are_why_you_are_fat.php">healthy or not</a>. A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150825232629/http://www.nydailynews.com/lifestyle/2011/05/27/2011-05-27_its_not_the_big_macs_work_is_whats_making_americans_fat_new_study_finds.html">new study published</a> in the journal PLoS ONE found that your job is making you fat: Workers are burning on average 100 fewer calories on the job than workers did 50 years ago. And a recent survey <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150825232629/http://www.nutrisystemnews.com/2011/05/nutrisystem-diet-index%E2%84%A2-reveals/">by Nutrisystem Diet Index</a> found that nearly fifty percent of Americans would rather give up sex than their favorite dessert for a month!</p>

<p>They found that a majority of those surveyed, overweight or not, admitted to struggling with their weight: more than two-thirds said they&apos;d tried dieting, half those surveyed will only post waist-up (rather than full-body) profile pictures for social networks, and one-third of married people would even rather not talk about their weight with their partner. Suffice to say, it seems like we really hate our bodies! </p>

<p>It&apos;s obvious that everyone of every body size needs some cheering up&#x2014;because although exercising and diet are essential, so is a healthy sense of self. In that spirit, click through for a positive spin on the weight debate: our top ten (or so) songs about loving your <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150825232629/http://www.dimensionsmagazine.com/dimtext/kjn/lyrics/song.htm">big old fat self.</a> </p>
