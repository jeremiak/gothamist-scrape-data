Jay-Z, newly minted <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110410045800/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/05/move_over_gwyneth_jay-z_launches_li.php">lifestyle guru</a> and chicken wing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110410045800/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/13/jay-z_enters_chicken_biz.php">enthusiast</a>, was videotaped March 31 in the locker room at Newark&apos;s Prudential Center with the Wildcats players, moments after they had beaten North Carolina to clinch a berth in the Final Four. </p>

<p>Though the visit was reportedly not for recruitment purposes, the NBA prohibits teams from having excessive contact with college players until they declare for the NBA Draft. The NBA might think that Jay-Z and college basketball is a strange pairing, but we have an even stranger one: Jay-Z and Paul Simon. On his latest album of articulate world pop, <em>So Beautiful Or So What</em> (his best album by a large margin since 1990s <em>The Rhythm Of The Saints</em>), Simon surprisingly invokes Jay-Z during a particularly lucid trip through Brooklyn in the song &quot;Questions For The Angels:&quot; &quot;Downtown Brooklyn, the pilgrim is passing a billboard which catches his eye/it&apos;s Jay-Z, he&apos;s got a kid on each knee, he&apos;s wearing clothes that he wants us to try.&quot; </p>

<p>Simon explained the strange origins of the reference <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110410045800/http://www.avclub.com/articles/paul-simon,53706/">to the AV Club</a>: </p>

<blockquote>Well, a couple years ago, the Brooklyn Academy Of Music did a month of my music, and I would sing a song or two a night, and other artists would perform it. So I would be driving out to Brooklyn, and there was a billboard of Jay-Z right on the other side of the Brooklyn Bridge. It actually existed. The song is sort of dreamy, and it is not very street, you know? It was interesting to me to give a pure photo of what&#x2019;s on the street, just to change the perspective from the questions of the angels to a downtown Brooklyn scene. Because he is walking back, so now I&#x2019;ll just pull you back to see where he is walking before we come to the really big question, which is, &#x201C;If all the humans were gone, would any other living creature really care?&#x201D; That&#x2019;s how Jay-Z came in. You can Google it up&#x2014;Jay-Z billboard. I don&#x2019;t think there are kids actually sitting on his knee, but that doesn&#x2019;t matter anyway. It was just getting Jay-Z in there that was good. It kind of snaps your head around.</blockquote>

<p>Simon adds that he &quot;wouldn&apos;t mind&quot; if Jay-Z returned the favor and included him in one of his songs. We just hope that Jay-Z can find time in his busy schedule to stop by the Beacon when Simon is in town for some shows in May.</p>
