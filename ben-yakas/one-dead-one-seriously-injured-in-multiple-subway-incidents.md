<p>At least one person was killed and another was seriously injured during separate subway incidents this morning that brought mass transit to a halt. A man fell onto the northbound 2 train tracks and was fatally electrocuted just before 7 a.m. this morning; then a man fell on the F train tracks at the Lower East Side-2 Avenue station near East Houston after 10 a.m. </p>

<p>The man in the second incident was taken to Bellevue Hospital in cardiac arrest, according to FDNY. Initial reports from police say that the incident &quot;appears to be an accidental fall.&quot; Due to the investigation, southbound F trains are running on the A line from W 4 St-Washington Sq to Jay St-MetroTech.</p>

<p>After it was diverted for much of the morning, service has been restored to the 1/2/3 trains. We&apos;ve spoken to a witness to that incident, and will have more information about the electrocution soon. </p>
