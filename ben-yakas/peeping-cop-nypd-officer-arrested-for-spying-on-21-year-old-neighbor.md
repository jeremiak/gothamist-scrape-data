<p>An off-duty NYPD officer was arrested Friday and charged with spying on his 21-year-old neighbor. Miguel Gomez, 41, is accused of setting up a surveillance camera in his Bronx building in order to monitor his young female neighbor. Gomez&apos;s mother <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509003253/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/bronx/surveillance-camera-spy-neighbor-article-1.1291046">defended him to the Daily News</a>: &#x201C;My son is a very good boy and wouldn&#x2019;t do a thing like that,&#x201D; 67-year-old Juliana Gomez said.</p>

<p>Gomez, an eight year veteran of the force, was arrested just after 8 a.m. Friday and booked for unlawful surveillance. Police haven&apos;t revealed exactly where in the building the camera was set up, whether Gomez was recording the neighbor, or what Gomez&apos;s relationship with the neighbor was like. It&apos;s assumed he didn&apos;t use police equipment to spy on her, because if so, &quot;he would definitely face additional charges,&#x201D; a police source noted. </p>
