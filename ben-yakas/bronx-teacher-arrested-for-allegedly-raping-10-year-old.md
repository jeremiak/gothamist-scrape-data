<p>A Bronx teacher has been arrested and accused of raping a 10-year-old student today. According to police, 40-year-old PS 386 teacher Anthony Criscuolo was arrested this morning and charged with second degree rape. The NYPD told us that the mother of the victim discovered text messages or e-mails between the teacher and her daughter. </p>

Criscuolo then allegedly took the girl to another school, PS 196, and allegedly raped her in a car in the parking lot. </p>

<p>Criscuolo has been reassigned away from the classroom and students. However, as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130727022827/http://www.metro.us/newyork/news/2013/06/19/bronx-teacher-collared-for-rape-of-student-10/">Metro points out</a>, Criscuolo is a tenured teacher, so he will remain employed by the DOE and receive a full paycheck from the city while the court process unfolds.</p>
