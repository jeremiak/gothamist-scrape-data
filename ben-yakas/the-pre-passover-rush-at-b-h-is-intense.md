<p>The giant <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150404230737/http://gothamist.com/2009/11/19/bh.php">B&amp;H; Photo-Video</a> emporium on 9th Avenue and 34th Street has long observed Jewish holidays...but we never realized just how crazy it can get before they close! Reader <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150404230737/http://streetperformers.tumblr.com/">Michael Tapp</a> took the above photo yesterday, and painted us a picture of the craziness of the scene: &quot;The checkout line an hour before B&amp;H; Photo Video shuts down Passover (8 Days). <strong>The wait was over an hour long and one of the clerks said that this was the busiest he has ever seen the store.</strong> A few B&amp;H; employees couldn&apos;t even figure out where the line started on the 1st floor.&quot;  </p>
