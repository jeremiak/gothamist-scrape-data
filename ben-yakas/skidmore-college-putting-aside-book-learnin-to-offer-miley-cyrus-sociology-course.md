<p>NYU has never been shy about latching onto a front page story and turning it into an educational moment, whether it&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140401005953/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/08/nyu_offering_course_in_occupy_wall.php">Occupy Wall Street</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140401005953/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/25/viral_videos_nyu.php">viral videos</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140401005953/http://nypost.com/2014/03/22/professor-questlove-schools-nyu-students-in-prince-101/">Prince.</a> But it&apos;s not just NYU: it seems like every school is starting a course based around headline-grabbing material (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140401005953/http://entertainment.time.com/2014/01/31/theres-now-a-college-course-about-beyonce-at-rutgers-university/">Beyonce</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140401005953/http://www.theonering.net/torwp/2004/02/18/4870-university-of-wisconsin-talks-elvish/"><em>Lord Of The Rings</em> languages</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140401005953/http://catalog.oberlin.edu/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=32&amp;coid=68043">how to win a beauty pageant</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140401005953/http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-098-street-fighting-mathematics-january-iap-2008/"><em>Street Fighter</em> mathematics</a>) because kids just can&apos;t get #engaged with book learnin&apos; any other way. And this educational ideology has now hit its peak and/or nadir, depending how you look at it: Skidmore College is offering a sociology course all about Miley Cyrus...albeit, a summer course.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140401005953/http://www.dailygazette.com/news/2014/mar/27/0327_miley/">According to the Schenectady Daily Gazette</a>, visiting assistant professor of sociology Carolyn Chernoff will offer a two-and-a-half hour class three days a week on the Saratoga Springs campus this summer. &quot;From Disney tween to twerking machine, Miley Cyrus has grown up in the public eye, trying on and discarding very different identities on-screen and off,&quot; reads Chernoff&#x2019;s course description. &quot;She provides rich examples for analyzing aspects of intersectional identities and media representation.&quot;</p>

<p>Chernoff told them that she was inspired after watching Cyrus perform with Robin Thicke at the Grammys last year: &quot;Sort of the &#x2018;twerk-heard-round the world&#x2019; moment,&quot; she said. &quot;All of a sudden, my students who claimed to be not that interested in Miley Cyrus had so much to say.&quot; If only Wittgenstein had Dougied, maybe someone would make a course about him.</p>

<p>&#x201C;I created it as a creative and rigorous way of looking at what&#x2019;s relevant about sociology and sociology theory,&#x201D; Chernoff added. &#x201C;Miley Cyrus is a surprisingly complicated cultural moment.&#x201D; Chernoff said she&apos;s also contacted Cyrus&apos; publicist, perhaps in hopes of Miley stopping by: &quot;She may well find out. We&#x2019;ll see what happens.&quot; So there&apos;s a chance you could see her in person! Or you could just, ya know, go to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140401005953/http://www.mileycyrus.com/events">one of her many concert dates</a>, and not skip summer classes. Alternatively, Skidmore students <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140401005953/http://www.skidmore.edu/summersession/documents/SUM14_course_descriptions_3_17_14.pdf">could take</a> Introduction to American Government 3 and fulfill a social sciences requirement, or Elementary German 4 (which presupposes no previous study of German!) this summer.</p>

<p>Or they can take a class centered around someone who was recently involved in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140401005953/http://gothamist.com/tags/sineado&apos;connor">a Twitter fight with Sinead O&apos;Connor</a>. Your choice!</p>
