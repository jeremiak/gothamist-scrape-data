<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503021346/http://gothamist.com/tags/timessquare">Times Square</a> may typically resemble a nightmare Epcot Center filled with marauding gangs of copyrighted characters, but sometimes it&apos;s the humans you need to worry about the most. According to police, a &quot;Weed Man&quot; of Times Square got into a physical altercation with the &quot;Beer Man&quot; of Times Square, who is known for carrying a sign reading &quot;I need beer.&quot; And Alien and Predator <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503021346/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/weed-guy-stabs-beer-guy-times-square-article-1.1379660">were called in as witnesses</a>!</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503021346/http://www.ny1.com/content/top_stories/184298/man-arrested-after-argument-between-panhandlers-leads-to-alleged-assault-in-times-square">According to NY1</a>, this &quot;Weed Man&quot; stabbed Wayne Semancik (aka &quot;Beer Man&quot;) during a panhandling turf dispute around 10:15 p.m. at 42nd Street near 7th Avenue. Semancik told them that &quot;Weed Man&quot; (apparently Dwight Laird) spit in his face: &quot;When you spit in my face, darling, I&apos;m going to hit you. I don&apos;t care who you are, how big you are, I&apos;m going to hit you,&quot; Semancik said. &quot;So the man, he pulled out a pen because I was hitting him, and he started stabbing me in the face, and I have five stab wounds in my face right now.&quot;</p>

<p>Laird was arrested, but it&apos;s not clear what he&apos;s been charged with. But at least one truly good thing came out of this whole brouhaha: Alien and Predator have finally learned to work together! Although, the kid in the bottom right of the photo above seems a bit suspicious about this unholy union.</p>
