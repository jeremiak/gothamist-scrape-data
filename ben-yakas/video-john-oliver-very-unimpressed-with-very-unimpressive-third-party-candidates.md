<p>We&apos;ve all been flung into a special kind of hell during this current election cycle (new slogan: &quot;Lice On Rats On A Horse Corpse On Fire 2016&quot;), so it&apos;s understandable a lot of people disenchanted with the two major parties (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021171538/http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2016/09/south-park-season-20-premiere">Giant Douche vs Turd Sandwich</a>) have been looking toward third party candidates as viable options. Unfortunately, as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021171538/http://gothamist.com/tags/johnoliver">John Oliver</a> pointed out this weekend on <em>Last Week Tonight</em>, those third party candidates are somehow even worse. </p>

<p>&quot;The more you look at Gary Johnson and Jill Stein, the more you realize the lack of coverage they complain about so much might have genuinely benefitted them,&#x201D; Oliver said. &#x201C;Because their key proposals crumble under the slightest amount of scrutiny.&quot; Watch it below.</p>

<p>If only Kevin Kline&apos;s character in <em>Dave</em> or the ghost of Martin Luther King Jr. (&quot;assuming he only said the three quotes that white people like&quot;) could run&#x2014;but at least we have write-in candidate Joe Exotic. </p>
