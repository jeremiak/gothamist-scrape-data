The plane, which was piloted by Manhattan resident Keith Weiner and contained his wife, daughter, and her friend, had just taken off from Westchester County Airport when he contacted an emergency control tower to say they needed to make an emergency landing. &quot;He was such a good pilot. He was meticulous, so careful. We used to practice what would happen in the event of an emergency like this -- something had to have gone horribly wrong,&quot; his 85-year-old father William Weiner, also a pilot, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602115058/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/dead_in_plane_horror_lDp5mHjTVlq8FWGBY2fGUO?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">told the Post.</a><p></p>

<p>The family, who lived on West 57th Street, was headed to Montauk on the eastern end of Long Island in the Cessna 210 when the emergency happened. &quot;The pilot advised that he had to return to Westchester County. He was trying to return and the plane went down just short of runway 16,&quot; said FAA spokeswoman Holly Baker. The single-prop plane burst into flames after it crashed in the woods near the runway. Weiner&apos;s father <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602115058/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2011/06/18/2011-06-18_three_killed_after_small_plane_crashes_just_short_of_westchester_county_airport.html">told the News</a> that they were only going on a day trip to get away from the city: &quot;They were going to have a nice lunch.&quot; Weiner, his wife Lisa, their daughter Isabel, and her friend Lucy Walsh all died.</p>
