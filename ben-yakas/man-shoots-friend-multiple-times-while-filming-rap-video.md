<p>A man shot his &quot;best friend&quot; multiple times in the Bronx after the two got into a quarrel while filming a rap video together. Police say the incident happened just after 1 a.m. Saturday morning on Webster Avenue near E. 170 Street. The victim, who police believe is in his 30s, was shot in the torso and legs, and grazed in the head. He was taken to Lincoln Hospital, where he currently is in serious condition.</p>

<p>Local deli owner Ali Abdul, 41, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141005031707/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/man-shot-multiple-times-shooting-rap-video-bronx-article-1.1889779">told the News</a> that he knew the two men from around the neighborhood, and they had always appeared to be &quot;best friends.&quot; He said they were filming a rap video with about 30 other people that evening when they started arguing.  &quot;They were fighting over who&#x2019;s the star, who&#x2019;s better,&quot; said Abdul. &quot;They were drunk. They spit at each other then one guy pulled out a gun and shot the other guy five times.&quot;</p>

<p>The suspect is described as a black man, around 30 years old, 5-foot-10, and weighing 180-210 pounds. He has braids and was wearing a red polo shirt, gray sweatpants and black-and-white sneakers when last seen. No arrests have been made at this time.</p>
