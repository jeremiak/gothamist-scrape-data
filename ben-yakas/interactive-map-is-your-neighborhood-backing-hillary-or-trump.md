<p>Over seven months ago, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110103423/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/08/neighborhood_donation_map.php">RentHop created an interactive map</a> which gave you the general idea of what the political landscape was for any given NYC neighborhood based on political contributions. They&apos;ve now updated the map once more to see where New Yorkers are leaning with just three weeks until the election&#x2014;and while the bulk of the city is firmly supporting Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump <em>owns</em> Staten Island (and parts of southern Brooklyn).</p>

<p>Here are a few highlights of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110103423/https://www.renthop.com/studies/nyc/trump-leads-in-southwest-brooklyn">the latest study</a>, which are all based FEC campaign disclosures:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Hillary Clinton has 27,226 unique donors in NYC (88.8% of active donors)</li>
	<li>Clinton&apos;s strongest zip codes: 11422 (Rosedale), 10452 (Highbridge), 10026 (Central Park North), 11238 (Prospect Heights), 10011 (Chelsea), 11201 (Brooklyn Heights)</li>
	<li>Trump has the support of 3,258 donors in NYC (10.6% of active donors)</li>
	<li>Trump&apos;s strongest zip codes: 11697 (Breezy Point), 10309 (Pleasant Plains), 11414 (Howard Beach), 10306 (New Dorp), 11228 (Dyker Heights), 10474 (Hunts Point)</li>
	<li>Clinton leads Trump in 189 Zip Codes across the five boroughs</li>
	<li>Trump is triumphant over Staten Island, with 534 donors to Clinton&apos;s 319, really huge support, tremendous really, nobody has more support on Staten Island</li>
	<li>But Clinton has almost 95% of donors from Manhattan</li>
	<li>81 people in NYC donated to Gary Johnson, and 69 donated to Jill Stein. Please no one donate anymore to Jill Stein, that is the perfect number of donations.</li>
</ul>
