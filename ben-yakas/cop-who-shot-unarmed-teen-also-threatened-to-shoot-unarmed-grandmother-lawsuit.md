<p>Exactly one year ago today, Officer Richard Haste fatally shot unarmed 18-year-old <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150203005009/http://gothamist.com/tags/ramarleygraham">Ramarley Graham</a> in his Bronx apartment. Several months later, Haste <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150203005009/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/13/officer_surrenders_to_faces_charges.php">pleaded not guilty to first- and second-degree manslaughter charges</a> in the teen&apos;s death. To mark the anniversary, Graham&apos;s family <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150203005009/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20130201/edenwald/cop-threatened-shoot-ramarley-grahams-grandmother-suit-says">has filed a lawsuit against the NYPD</a> in which they claim that after shooting Graham, Haste threatened to shoot Graham&apos;s sobbing grandmother, then took her in for hours of intimidating and questioning.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150203005009/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/03/cop_kills_unarmed_18-year-old_in_hi.php">The teen was killed</a> on February 2nd, 2012 after Haste and other officers allegedly observed him buying drugs and followed him to his Bronx home. Haste <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150203005009/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/05/video_nypd_kicks_in_door_before_sho.php">could be seen on surveillance footage</a> with other officers as they attempt to kick open the door to the Graham residence. After they gained entry, Haste ran upstairs and found Graham in his bathroom. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150203005009/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/04/bronx_teen_did_not_struggle_with_po.php">officer allegedly yelled</a>, &quot;Show me your hands! Gun! Gun!&quot; before shooting Graham once and killing him. The teenager was unarmed, and had been dumping a small amount of marijuana into the toilet.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150203005009/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20130201/edenwald/cop-threatened-shoot-ramarley-grahams-grandmother-suit-says">According to the lawsuit</a>, Graham&apos;s grandmother, Patricia Hartley, was feet away from Graham at the time, and immediately cried out, &quot;Why did you shoot him, why you killed him?&quot; Haste then allegedly pushed Hartley into a vase and said, &quot;Get the f--- away before I have to shoot you, too.&quot;</p>

<p>Hartley&#x2014;who was 58 and weighed 85 pounds at the time&#x2014;had her arm twisted behind her back by Haste after she tried to make a phone call. She was then taken to the 47th Precinct station house, where investigators allegedly called her a &quot;f---ing liar&quot; and claimed she was covering for the dead teen, whom cops believed had thrown a gun out a window.</p>

<p>During the interrogation, officers allegedly showed her a photo of a shot man they claimed was her grandson. They also allegedly dipped their hands into her coffee, then flicked their fingers against a wall to show how blood splatters. Hartley was kept at the station for seven hours altogether.

<p>The lawsuit, which names the NYPD, Haste, Commissioner Ray Kelly and other officers, accuses the NYPD of improperly training officers, unfairly targeting minorities in stop-and-frisks and trying to cover up the shooting. To the last point, the NYPD initially claimed Haste and Graham had struggled with one another and the cop&apos;s 9 mm handgun discharged, which has since been disproven. The lawsuit claims the account was false and &quot;made with the intent to conspire to cover-up the true facts of the incident.&quot;</p>

<p>Also to mark the anniversary, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150203005009/http://www.ny1.com/content/top_stories/176383/vigil--rally-to-mark-anniversary-of-bronx-teen-s-shooting-death">a vigil and rally are planned</a> for today in the Bronx; family, friends and neighbors will march to the 47th Precinct station house.<br>
