<p>Louis C.K.&apos;s Beacon Theater <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602141302/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/19/louie_cks_5_comedy_special.php">comedy special/internet experiment</a> turned out better than anyone could have expected: in the 12 days since the special was put online for $5, Louis has made more than a million dollars! And he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602141302/https://buy.louisck.net/news">announced on his website</a> that he is donating $280,000 to five different charities: &quot;The thing is still on sale. I hope folks keep buying it. If I make another million, I&apos;ll give more of it away. I&apos;ll let you know when that happens because I like you getting to know what happened to your 5 dollars and bringing awareness to the bla bla bla.&quot; Aww: come for the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602141302/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzbURUrgQao&amp;feature=related">bag of dicks</a>, stay for the benevolence.</p>

<p>Louis C. K. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602141302/http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/12/22/online-sales-of-louis-c-k-special-cross-1-million-mark/">explained that</a> he would use $250,000 to pay for the special, spend another $250,000 in bonuses to people who work for him, and keep $220,000 for himself: &quot;Some of that will pay my rent and will care for my childen [sic]. The rest I will do terrible, horrible things with and none of that is any of your business. In any case, to me, 220k is enough out of a million.&quot; He further expanded on all this in an interview with Jimmy Fallon last night:</p>

<p>Our favorite part is when he describes the charities he is giving money in typical Louis C.K. form, including The Fistula Foundation (&quot;It&apos;s a place for these women who get raped, and then I give them money&quot;), Green Chimneys (&quot;Where kids that nobody likes, they go to this place&quot;) and Charity Water (&quot;They build water things when people are thirsty&quot;). And he gives a substantial hint at a major overhaul toward which the rest of his money will be going.</p>
