<p>Since legendary rock and roller <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429153500/http://gothamist.com/tags/loureed">Lou Reed</a> died of liver disease, there have been outpourings of emotional tributes and remembrances to the man across the internet. We&apos;ve seen his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429153500/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/01/laurie_andersons_beautiful_eulogy_t.php">last live performance</a> and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429153500/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/31/six_perfect_photos_of_lou_reed_plus.php#photo-2">last photo session</a> he did&#x2014;and below, you can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429153500/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/videos/lou-reeds-last-words-watch-his-final-interview-20131108">watch the last interview with Reed</a>, which occurred on September 21st. &quot;Sound is more than just noise. Ordered sound is music,&quot; he said. &quot;My life is music.&quot;</p>

<p>Reed sat down with director Farida Khelfa as part of a photo shoot for headphone company Parrot Zik (for whom Reed had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429153500/http://www.parrot.com/zik/usa/">lent his sonic expertise</a>). Reed looks tired (and his eyes look particularly yellowed), but he is just as witty and vivid as you&apos;d hope, discussing various sound techniques, and what sound means to him: &quot;I am very emotionally affected by sound. Sounds are the inexplicable...There is a sound you hear in your head, it&apos;s your nerves, or your blood running. It&apos;s kind of amazing to hear that.&quot;</p>

<p>When asked if his father bought him his first guitar, Reed responds, &quot;My father didn&apos;t give me shit.&quot; He also (sarcastically) mentions that he slept with his guitar and amp, that he was horrified by the sound on CDs, and that he believes the first memory of sound &quot;would have to be your mother&apos;s heartbeat, for all of us.&quot;<br>
 <br>
And when asked why he became a musician, he put it beautifully: <strong>&#x201C;You do what you love&#x2026; or you get arrested.&quot;</strong></p>
