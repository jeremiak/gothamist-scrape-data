<p>Last Wednesday, a group of artists and pizza enthusiasts <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140621230309/http://gothamist.com/2014/06/13/photos_williamsburg_pizza_party.php#photo-1">successfully pulled together a free pizza &amp; beer bash</a> in Williamsburg in honor of the 125th birthday of the cheese-tomato-carbohydrates mashup. The party, which included pizza from around 400 pizzerias in Manhattan and Brooklyn, was a cheesy success&#x2014;and most impressively, was put together in around a week. Organizer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140621230309/http://ronenv.com/videos/">Ronen V.</a>, who manages Standard Creative Studio where the party was held, has put together a video documenting both the lead up and actual event. Check it out below.</p>
