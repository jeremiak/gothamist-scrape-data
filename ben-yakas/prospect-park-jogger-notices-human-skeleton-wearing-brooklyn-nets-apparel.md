<p>Prospect Park is filled with all sorts of interesting things, including <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427122528/http://gothamist.com/2014/05/25/photos_who_is_feeding_these_guinea.php">guinea pigs</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427122528/http://gothamist.com/2014/04/27/videos_feminist_fireworks_fly_over.php">feminist fireworks</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427122528/http://gothamist.com/2014/03/03/goat_head_prospect_park.php">dismembered goat&apos;s heads</a>, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427122528/http://gothamist.com/2014/05/31/prospect_park_trip_wire_leaves_cycl.php#photo-1">cyclist traps</a>. You can now add skeletons decked out in Brooklyn Nets apparel to that list.</p>

<p>Runner Kate Steciw <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427122528/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Runner-Discovers-Bones-Prospect-Park-Lefferts-Gardens-Running-Path-NY-270263911.html">told NBC that</a> she came upon a human skeleton wearing a Brooklyn Nets hat, a t-shirt, goggles and sweatpants yesterday in the park. It was &quot;standing&quot; up on display behind a wrought iron fence near Ocean Avenue in the southeastern part of the park. Surrounding the skeleton were four paintings of flowers; behind it was an American flag. </p>

<p>It sounds as though Steciw didn&apos;t quite believe her eyes at first: <strong>&quot;I took a picture of it and then I got a queasy feeling, because it looked so, so real,&quot;</strong> she said. She called the cops, but had a hard time describing the scene: &quot;I was trying to explain to them that it was a skeleton standing upright, dressed in clothes with objects arranged around it,&#x201D; she said.</p>

<p>Officers removed the skeleton and are investigating the incident now, trying to determine if it is indeed human remains and whether any crime was committed. </p>
