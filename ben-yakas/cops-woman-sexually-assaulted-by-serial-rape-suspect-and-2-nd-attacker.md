<p>Police are still searching for the 20-year-old man <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171015045217/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/06/cops_seek_rapist_terrorizing_queens.php">who is suspected of sexual abuse, rape and robbery</a> in Queens&apos; 112 Precinct, which covers Rego Park and Forest Hills&#x2014;and now the NYPD says he was involved in a fourth sexual assault, this time with a partner. Police say that Ibrahima Ragis and a unidentified partner (who you can see in the sketch above) attacked a 20-year-old woman in front of 97-11 Horace Harding Expressway on June 22. </p>

<p>The unidentified suspect sexually assaulted the woman from behind; the woman, who had been walking with a shopping cart, hit him with it. Then Ragis allegedly ran up to the victim, threw her to the ground and attempted to rape her; the woman fought back and the both men fled. The victim was brought to an area hospital where she was treated for bruising and lacerations to her body.</p>

<p>Ragis is also wanted for three other sexual assaults since May. He is suspected of sexually abusing and robbing a 19-year-old woman at knifepoint May 19 in Forest Hills; he is suspected of raping a 17-year-old woman in front of her Forest Hills home at knifepoint on May 28; and he is suspected of robbing a 22-year-old woman in her Forest Hills home. </p>

<p>Anyone with information is asked to call the NYPD&apos;s Crime Stoppers Hotline at 800-577-TIPS. The public can also submit their tips by logging onto the Crime Stoppers Website at WWW.NYPDCRIMESTOPPERS.COM or texting their tips to 274637(CRIMES) then enter TIP577.</p>
