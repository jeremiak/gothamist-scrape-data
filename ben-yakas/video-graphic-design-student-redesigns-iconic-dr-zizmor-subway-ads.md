<p>Regardless of what he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509165615/http://gothamist.com/2014/04/11/dr_zizmor.php">looks like in real life now</a>, Dr. Zizmor&apos;s iconic ads are an integral part of the subway. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509165615/http://www.headachesolutioncenter.com/meet-dr-lagstein.php">Dr. Marvin Lagstein</a> just doesn&apos;t quite cut it, ya know? But one graphic design student at the School of Visual Arts had an aesthetic allergic reaction to the ads&#x2014;and made the controversial decision to &quot;redesign&quot; them.</p>

<p><iframe src="//web.archive.org/web/20150509165615if_/http://player.vimeo.com/video/88725938" width="640" height="387" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen></iframe> </p><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509165615/http://vimeo.com/88725938">Cleaning Dr. Zizmor&apos;s ads</a> from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509165615/http://vimeo.com/user14608894">Hyo Hong</a> on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509165615/https://vimeo.com/">Vimeo</a>.</p><p></p>

<p>&quot;&#x200B;&#x200B;&#x200B;&#x200B;&#x200B;&#x200B;New Yorkers are familiar with the iconic Doctor Zizmor&apos;s Beautiful Clear Skin subway posters,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509165615/http://www.hyohong.com/">Hyo Hong</a> wrote us. &quot;As a designer, having to see this ad everyday in my commute really bothered me. Therefore, I had to do something about it.&quot; She said she&apos;s &quot;improved&quot; 26 of his posters so far, and promised to do more, although we haven&apos;t encountered any in real life recently.</p>

<p>It&apos;d be one thing if Hong had decided to update the ads to make them <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509165615/http://gothamist.com/2014/04/11/dr_zizmor.php">align with reality</a>&#x2014;but her decision to use a bland white covering definitely does <em>not</em> improve on the Lisa Frank-esque perfection of that &apos;clear skin&apos; rainbow. </p>

<p>So if you happen to run into Hong putting these up, it is every New Yorker&apos;s solemn duty to direct her to a different ad, like say, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509165615/http://gothamist.com/2014/02/07/lucas_talks_venmo_subway_ads_the_ab.php">those Lucas Venmo ads</a>. Even he agrees his mustache could use some pruning.</p>
