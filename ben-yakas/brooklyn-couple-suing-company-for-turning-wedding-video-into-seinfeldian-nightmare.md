<p>Everyone knows that marriages <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425173043/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suAhGfVr_4U">are man-made prisons</a> in which you have to ask permission to use the bathroom and lose the ability to watch TV while eating. Despite that, some people still actually <em>want</em> to get married, including Brooklyn couple Monica Nickchemny and Felix Komrash, who tied the knot in September 2012. But according to a new lawsuit, their wedding was transformed into a <em>Seinfeldian</em> nightmare thanks to the video production company who had a slightly different artistic vision for their nuptials.</p>

<p>&quot;When I was watching my wedding video it sounded like I was watching an episode of <em>Seinfeld</em> with the sound effects in the background,&quot; Nickchemny <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425173043/http://nypost.com/2014/02/07/couple-sues-film-company-over-seinfeld-esque-wedding-video/">told the Post</a>, referring to sitcom-style clap tracks. &quot;I was hysterical. I almost had a nervous breakdown.&quot; According <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425173043/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/brooklyn-couple-sue-ridiculous-wedding-video-article-1.1606131#ixzz2sfa5jOCj">to their lawsuit</a>, the couple paid $12,750 to film company Visualez in August 2011 to produce a wedding video and a short &quot;love story&quot; clip to play during the ceremony. </p>

<p>In addition to the laugh track, the video was missing the cocktail hour, the dessert table and the signing of the Jewish marriage agreement. Oh, and there was this: &quot;They wanted [Komrash] to wear women&apos;s clothes, he would look like a woman, I would have to put him in a dress and he would fall in love with me. It was a very stupid story,&quot; said Nickchemny. </p>

<p>Of course, the Post adds that Nickchemny did want the company to produce a <em>Coming to America</em>-style film with Komrash cast in the Eddie Murphy role, so the whole video seemingly started from an artistically questionable place (it also at least somewhat explains the concept behind the transvestite concept). </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425173043/http://visualaz.com/">Visualaz</a> is run by Igor Boshoer, whose credits include the effects in <em>The Wolf of Wall Street</em>. So the couple should be glad that no drool was involved. </p>
