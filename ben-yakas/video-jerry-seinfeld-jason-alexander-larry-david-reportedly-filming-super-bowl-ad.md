<p>Earlier this week, <em>Seinfeld</em> fans were a little verklempt after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426211951/http://gothamist.com/tags/seinfeld">Jerry Seinfeld</a>, Jason Alexander and Larry David <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426211951/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/13/jerry_seinfeld_jason_alexander_are.php#photo-1">were all spotted</a> loitering around <strike>Monk&apos;s</strike> Tom&apos;s Restaurant on the Upper West Side. We were told by separate people at the restaurant that they were filming an episode of <em>Comedians In Cars Getting Coffee</em> and/or a Super Bowl commercial. Well, according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426211951/http://www.tomsrestaurantdocumentary.com/">Gian Franco Morini</a>, who is directing a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426211951/https://twitter.com/@TomsRestDoc">documentary about Tom&apos;s</a>, it was a Super Bowl ad. And you can see more footage of the three comedians at Tom&apos;s below.</p>

<p>Among other things: someone asks Larry David about the &quot;mysterious project&quot; Seinfeld alluded to in his Reddit AMA last week&#x2014;that project, it turns out, is likely <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426211951/http://www.showbiz411.com/2014/01/11/exclusive-larry-david-and-jerry-seinfeld-consider-a-broadway-debut?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=exclusive-larry-david-and-jerry-seinfeld-consider-a-b">a Broadway or off-Broadway play which David has written</a> and Seinfeld may star in. Either way, David said this had nothing to do with that.</p>

<p>You can also see the crew using a snow machine in front of Tom&apos;s. The gear they were using to film it was marked &quot;Comedian&apos;s,&quot; but the use of the snow machine does signal that this is not for Seinfeld&apos;s unadorned web show.</p>

<p>Regardless of what <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426211951/https://twitter.com/Seinfeld2000">Jery and Garge</a> were up to that day, we know one thing for certain: Larry David definitely does not want to buy a chocolate bar from the Inside Edition camera man. </p>
