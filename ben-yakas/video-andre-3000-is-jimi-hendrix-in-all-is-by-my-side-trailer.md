<p>Despite the big <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506145425/http://gothamist.com/tags/outkast">Outkast festival reunion tour</a> this year, it&apos;s been almost a decade since Andre 3000 has made any significant new music. But it hasn&apos;t just been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506145425/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7hxkAClnF4">Gillette Fusion ProGlide Styler ads</a> keeping him away from the studio: Andre 3000 spent a significant chunk of time working on the long-awaited Jimi Hendrix biopic, <em>All Is By My Side.</em> You can see the official trailer below.</p>

<p>We&apos;ve been skeptical about Andre 3000&apos;s acting prowess based on some of his previous films (<em>Four Brothers</em>, <em>Semi-Pro</em>, <em>Idlewild</em>), but he definitely seems to have captured Hendrix&apos;s unique cadences and vibe in an uncanny way. Early reviews (the film premiered at the Toronto Film Festival last year and SXSW this year) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506145425/http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/jimi_all_is_by_my_side/">have been surprisingly positive</a> so far, with many singling out Andre 3000 (&quot;genius casting&quot;) and noting that it&apos;s more of a mood piece than a conventional biopic (partially because the film didn&apos;t have the right to use Hendrix&apos;s original songs).</p>

<p>The film, which was directed by <em>12 Years A Slave</em> writer John Ridley, will be released on September 26th. The movie charts the early part of Hendrix&apos;s career, the period around his still-incredible debut, <em>Are You Experienced</em>, and also stars Imogen Poots, Hayley Atwell, Ruth Negga and Adrian Lester. </p>
