<p>Early Friday morning, a 29-year-old woman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231090038/http://gothamist.com/2014/04/04/woman_falls_to_her_death_in_william.php">fell to her death</a> from a building in Williamsburg after she attempted to climb into her boyfriend&apos;s apartment via a kitchen window. &quot;I climbed out there and held her while she was fading,&quot; Alex Douglas, 42, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231090038/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/allegedly-drunk-brooklyn-woman-dies-fall-boyfriend-house-article-1.1746055">told the Daily News</a> about comforting his girlfriend Hannah Shaw after the fall. &quot;I&#x2019;m exhausted. I can&#x2019;t sleep. It&#x2019;s been horrible.&quot;</p>

<p>Douglas and Shaw, who have been dating for a year and a half, got into a fight Thursday night while out at Lucky Dog. Douglas said Shaw told him she was going back to her place on S. 4th Street: &quot;She ended up not going home. I ran into her on the street outside my place with some other guy,&quot; said Douglas. &quot;I did invite her in &#x2014; and then told her to leave. I told her not to come over.&quot;</p>

<p>Police say Shaw, who was drunk at the time, went to the roof and attempted to climb down into the apartment through the kitchen window by holding onto a set of hanging cable wires for support. She fell and landed on a roof three floors below his fourth-floor apartment; Douglas had to crawl through a neighbor&apos;s window to get to her. She was rushed to Woodhull Hospital around 4:40 a.m., where she was declared dead.</p>

<p>Police say no criminality is suspected, but the investigation is ongoing.</p>

<p>Shaw, an aspiring fashion designer who designed her own jewelry, had launched Hannah Shaw Designs after she moved to NYC in 2007, and recently worked for landscaping company Jungle Design NYC. &quot;This is just a really tragic accident. She was a lovely roommate. She was always happy and so kind and caring so much,&#x201D; Ada Vesti, a Swedish book publisher who lived with Shaw and another woman, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231090038/http://nypost.com/2014/04/04/drunk-woman-falls-to-death-in-williamsburg/">told the Post</a>.</p>

<p>Her mother, Jane Tawney, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231090038/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20140404/williamsburg/woman-falls-death-from-boyfriends-fire-escape-after-fight-sources-say">told DNAInfo that</a> she last talked to her daughter a week ago, and their last words exchanged together were, &quot;I love you.&quot; &quot;Never, never forget to say that,&quot; she added.</p>
