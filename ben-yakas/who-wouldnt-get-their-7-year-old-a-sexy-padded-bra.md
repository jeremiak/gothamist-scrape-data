But it seems that some other clothing companies have attention-envy&#x2014;Abercrombie and Fitch are swilling the cup of controversy with their latest product aimed at pre-teens: sexy padded bras and bikinis.<p></p>

<p>Parents <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151031005852/http://www1.whdh.com/news/articles/local/12003880493293/abercrombie-fitch-sells-padded-bikini-tops-to-young-girls/">are outraged</a> that the company has created a line of push-up bras and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151031005852/http://www.abercrombiekids.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/CategoryDisplay?catalogId=10851&amp;storeId=10101&amp;langId=-1&amp;topCategoryId=12103&amp;categoryId=71459&amp;parentCategoryId=12174">bathing suits</a> for girls as young as seven-years-old. &quot;That&#x2019;s weird. There&#x2019;s no need for that...I just don&#x2019;t think that there&#x2019;s a reason for 7-year-old girls to be worried about having their bodies look good. They should be playing,&#x201D; said Allie Ellis. </p>

<p>Professor Gail Dines of Wheelock College adds that the products are dangerous for young girls: &#x201C;It gets young girls to think about themselves in sexual ways before that&#x2019;s developmentally appropriate...<strong>It sends out really bad signals to adult men about young girls being appropriate sexual objects, objects of sexual desire for young men.</strong>&quot; </p>

<p>The company has since removed the &quot;push-up&quot; from their website, but the padded bras remain under the title &quot;lightly lined&quot; or &quot;striped triangle.&quot; Abercrombie isn&apos;t the only company getting in on the sexy tween trend: U.K. discount retailer Primark <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151031005852/http://www.foxnews.com/health/2010/04/14/department-store-pulls-padded-bikini-bras-kids/">has pulled</a> a line of sexy padded bikinis for young girls from its shelves after complaints from child protection agencies.</p>
