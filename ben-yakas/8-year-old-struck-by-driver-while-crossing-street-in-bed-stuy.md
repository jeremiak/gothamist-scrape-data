<p>An 8-year-old boy was struck by a driver while crossing the street in Brooklyn on Friday evening. According to police, the incident happened at the intersection of Fulton and Utica Avenues just before 6 p.m. on Friday in Bed-Stuy. &quot;I heard a thump. It was pretty hard,&quot; witness McKenzie Small <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140610001032/http://nypost.com/2014/06/06/8-year-old-boy-critically-injured-in-car-accident/">told the Post</a>. &quot;He was laying on his stomach. He wasn&#x2019;t moving at all. People were screaming and crying, &apos;Oh my God, it&#x2019;s a child! It&#x2019;s a child!&apos;&quot;</p>

<p>Police say that the boy, whose name hasn&apos;t been released, had tried running south to north across Fulton in the crosswalk, but against the pedestrian signal. Eastbound traffic on Fulton was stopped due to traffic, but westbound traffic was still moving; he was struck by the front bumper of a 2012 Honda in the westbound lane. </p>

<p>The driver of the car remained at the scene, got out, and tended to the child. The child suffered injuries to his jaw and pelvis, and was taken to Kings County Hospital in serious condition. No charges have been filed or are expected against the driver.</p>

<p>In a separate incident, a 50-year-old cyclist was fatally struck by a hit-and-run driver in Queens Friday as well. Police say Wayne White was cycling in the vicinity of North Conduit Avenue and 225 Street when he was fatally struck. The driver fled the scene, no arrests have been made and the investigation is ongoing.</p>
