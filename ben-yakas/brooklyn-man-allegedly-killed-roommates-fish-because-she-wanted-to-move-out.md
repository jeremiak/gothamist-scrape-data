<p>Breaking up with a roommate can be a very emotional experience, but there is never ANY call for violence against our water-breathing brothers and sisters. Yet, that&apos;s exactly what Jos&#xE9; Santiago allegedly did, according to roommate Brenda Alvarez: &#x201C;They were my babies! I can&#x2019;t have children, so my pets are like my kids,&#x201D; she <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130527035640/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/watery_grave_SuCz8WdyaGs63xQJVpxWXN?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Brooklyn">told the Post</a> about her fish, Bonnie and Clyde. &#x201C;They were beautiful fish and cost about $25 each. Wouldn&apos;t a more appropriate, and equally powerful, response have been to passive-aggressively blast Billy Joel&apos;s &quot;Movin&apos; Out&quot; for hours on end?</p>

<p>Alvarez, 45, said she wanted to move out of their shared Nostrand Avenue apartment because of growing tension with Santiago, who she&apos;s known since she was a kid. She says he attacked her before turning on the fish:  I started packing, but he kept antagonizing me,&#x201D; Alvarez recalled. &#x201C;Then he went crazy!&#x201D; </p>

<p>She says he flushed one of the fish down the toilet, then put another in a bag and tied it: &#x201C;When I saw him kill my fish I went berserk!&#x201D; Alvarez said. Santiago has been arrested and charged with animal cruelty and assault; he allegedly told cops that Alvarez attacked him, leaving a mark on his forehead.</p>

<p>&#x201C;I did everything for him, and the only thing I ever asked him to do was the laundry,&#x201D; Alvarez added. &#x201C;So, why did he do this to me?&#x201D;</p>
