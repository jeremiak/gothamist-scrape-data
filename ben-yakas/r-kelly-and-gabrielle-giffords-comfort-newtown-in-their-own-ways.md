<p>The students who survived the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130325040146/http://gothamist.com/tags/newtownshooting">tragic shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary School</a> in Newtown, Connecticut in December <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130325040146/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/poignant_peace_wEMm1DfsmCxjAEznCYN4OJ?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Local">returned to school this week</a>, only a few weeks after 20 of their classmates and six of their teachers and administrators were killed. Former Congresswoman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130325040146/http://gothamist.com/tags/gabriellegiffords">Gabrielle Giffords</a>, who was shot in Arizona two years ago, and her husband Mark Kelly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130325040146/http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/conn-lt-govs-office-giffords-meeting-planned-18128300">visited Newtown today</a> for a private meeting with families of the victims. Meanwhile, R. Kelly has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130325040146/http://www.vulture.com/2013/01/listen-to-r-kellys-song-about-newtown.html">released his own tribute</a> to the survivors of the shooting, &quot;I Know You Are Hurting,&quot; which you can hear below.</p>

<p>This week, Giffords also sat down with Mayor Bloomberg in a private session; according <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130325040146/http://news.yahoo.com/blogs/ticket/bloomberg-meets-gabrielle-giffords-gun-control-153733526--politics.html">to Yahoo News</a>, it was the first time Bloomberg and Giffords had met in person and they talked for &quot;nearly an hour. Immediately after the shooting, Giffords&apos; husband Mark Kelly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130325040146/https://www.facebook.com/Capt.MarkKelly/posts/436932369695360">released his own statement on Facebook</a> calling on officials to address the gun control issue:</p>

<blockquote>I just woke up in my hotel room in Beijing, China to learn that another mass shooting has taken place - this time at the Sandy Hook Elementary School in CT. My thoughts and prayers are with the families of the victims and the entire community of Newtown, CT. I just spoke to Gabby, and she sends her prayers from Tucson.
<br><br>
As we mourn, we must sound a call for our leaders to stand up and do what is right. This time our response must consist of more than regret, sorrow, and condolence. The children of Sandy Hook Elementary School and all victims of gun violence deserve leaders who have the courage to participate in a meaningful discussion about our gun laws - and how they can be reformed and better enforced to prevent gun violence and death in America. This can no longer wait.</blockquote>
