<p>Generally speaking, we prefer when our subway entertainers are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130529005658/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/11/video_happiest_headbanger_in_brookl.php">headbangers sporting Chris Cornell-circa-1988 locks</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130529005658/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/25/video_subway_straphanger_rocks_out.php">time travelers from 1996.</a> But once in a while, a true professional slips down into the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130529005658/http://gothamist.com/tags/rats">land of the rats</a>, determined to strut their stuff au natural. Canadian crooner Michael Bubl&#xE9; did just that this morning, putting his traditional pop vocals to the test at the Lincoln Square subway stop in Manhattan, a place where no amount of Juno awards can help win over the crowd. Check out some videos of the unannounced performance below&#x2014;he may not <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130529005658/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/03/video_unhinged_subway_performance_o.php">have the chops of Terrane</a>, but he can carry a tune alright. </p>
