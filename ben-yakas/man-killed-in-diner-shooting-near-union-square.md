The shooting took place at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150806155503/http://www.goodstuffdiner.com/">Good Stuff Diner</a> on W. 14th St. between 6th and 7th avenues around 4:45 a.m. According to early reports, two groups of men were engaged in a heated argument. &quot;I heard boom, boom, boom, and then came out into the restaurant and saw everyone running and screaming. <strong>It was like a scary movie. Blood was all over (and) I ran back into the kitchen to protect myself</strong>,&quot; Bruce Angel, who was working in the diner&apos;s kitchen when the gunshots rang out, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150806155503/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2010/10/23/2010-10-23_shootout_at_manhattan_diner_leaves_one_man_dead_as_argument_between_two_groups_g.html?r=news">told the News</a>. <p></p>

<p>The unidentified man who was killed was reportedly shot three times in the back and twice more in the back of the head, and died instantly. A worker at the next door 7-11 reported the shooting to police: &quot;A woman ran in screaming, &apos;I need the phone, someone&apos;s been shot!&apos; I saw people run out and there was panic outside,&quot; said Raj Gobal. Patrons say that it&apos;s not unusual for an early morning fight to break out between drunken customers at the restaurant, but never anything this extreme. &quot;It&apos;s shocking. It&apos;s a very good diner. I come here every morning for breakfast,&quot; said local resident said Abrim Muljan. Below, you can see a video showing the body being put into the ambulance.</p>
