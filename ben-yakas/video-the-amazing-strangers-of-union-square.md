<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120617023958/http://gothamist.com/2010/11/26/normal_bob_documents_union_square_w.php">Last week</a>, graphic artist and Union Square anthropologist Normal Bob was put under the NY Times microscope for a closer look at the weird and woozy world of Union Square Park which he lovingly covers on his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120617023958/http://normalbobsmith.com/">website</a>. Now, you can see some of those strange characters without any of the hassle of actually hanging out in the park&#x2014;Bob put up a video with footage of those &quot;Amazing Strangers,&quot; set to the song &quot;New York, I Love You But You&apos;re Bringing Me Down,&quot; by LCD Soundsystem. Among other things, the video includes lots of people nodding off, a man sucking on a woman&apos;s toes, odd dancing, and fights galore. </p>
