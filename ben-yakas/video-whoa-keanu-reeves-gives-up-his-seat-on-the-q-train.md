<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430052533/http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/n62lf/keanu_reeves_the_dude_has_class/">top post on Reddit</a> this morning isn&apos;t a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430052533/http://www.quickmeme.com/meme/35g9ov/">Rick Perry meme</a> or a story about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430052533/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1331769/Doctors-stunned-conjoined-twins-share-brain-thoughts.html">telepathic conjoined twins</a>: it&apos;s a video of Keanu Reeves on the Q train, giving up his seat for another straphanger last summer. Why is this video suddenly popping today? Who are we to question the internet! </p>

<p>Reeves is no stranger to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430052533/http://forum.bodybuilding.com/showthread.php?t=125321561&amp;page=1">having his photo</a> taken <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430052533/http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/gxqwp/if_you_spotted_keanu_reeves_on_the_subway_what/">on the subway</a>, but it still doesn&apos;t give any clues as to why this video is a hit now. One theory floating around: perhaps it&apos;s because of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430052533/http://keanureeves-celebfan.blogspot.com/">diehard Keanu fans</a> are tired of Ryan <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430052533/http://fuckyeahryangosling.tumblr.com/">&quot;Hey Girl&quot;</a> Gosling stealing the meme limelight from last year&apos;s darling, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430052533/http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/keanu-is-sad-sad-keanu">Sad Keanu</a>. Still, this is only Reeves&apos; second best subway video:</p>
