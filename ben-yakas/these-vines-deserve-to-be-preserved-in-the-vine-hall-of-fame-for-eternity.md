<p>Sad news reverberated through the social media sphere today <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170502072733/http://sfist.com/2016/10/27/vine_withers.php">when Twitter announced</a> that Vine, the video format perfect for capturing the strangeness of the online universe in six second loops, will be discontinued in a few months. During just three years of existence, Vine provided an essential tool for bloggers, vloggers, blooper junkies, meme mavens, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170502072733/http://www.businessinsider.com.au/who-is-vine-star-logan-paul-profile-2016-10">highly unlikable social media stars</a> who used it to unlock their creativity and/or fart into the wind in small, succinct bursts of wonder and weirdness. Enjoy the limelight while it lasts, Snapchat. Your time is coming.</p>

Anyone who has ever seen &quot;Bowie At Home&quot; knows what a monumental loss this is.</p>

In honor of the passing of such a malleable, ADD-addled platform, outlets <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170502072733/http://digg.com/2016/vine-is-dead-and-so-is-my-soul">across</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170502072733/http://jezebel.com/here-are-a-mere-few-of-the-best-vines-a-eulogy-to-vine-1788289419">the Internet</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170502072733/http://www.theverge.com/2016/10/27/13438638/best-vine-list-twitter-shutdown-dead">are posting</a> their favorite Vines (this is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170502072733/http://jezebel.com/the-best-vines-i-found-while-high-and-alone-in-2015-1746739092?utm_campaign=socialfow_jezebel_twitter&amp;utm_source=jezebel_twitter&amp;utm_medium=socialflow">a classic of the genre</a>). While they were doing that, I was being bombarded with Vines by my coworkers, which made me hysterically laugh even as the deluge of videos crashed my computer.</p>

<p>I never was a Vine fanatic like some, but it always seemed like a perfect medium to me, one that cut through the dead air &quot;conversational&quot; bullshit of so many other social media platforms (in the same spirit, I was a big fan of the Dadaist <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170502072733/http://www.businessinsider.com/whats-happened-to-7-million-app-yo-now-that-the-hype-has-died-2014-9">Yo app</a>, which was one of the all-time genius dumb ideas). It was a medium that leant itself to all killer, no filler content&#x2014;how many other platforms could reward <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170502072733/https://vine.co/v/MuzPTKxzpYB">joyous</a> spontaneous <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170502072733/https://vine.co/v/ibJ0WrFgaja">dancing</a>, capture the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170502072733/https://vine.co/v/O2mLuHPdEuY">blink-and-you&apos;ll-miss-it wonder</a> of live TV, and turn children into <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170502072733/https://vine.co/v/eIYLdg7KHDh">rap video stars</a>? The fact that Vine brought us Conner O&apos;Malley, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170502072733/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/20/videos_meet_the_crazed_vine_guy.php">my personal Vine hero</a>, is enough to justify its existence. </p>
