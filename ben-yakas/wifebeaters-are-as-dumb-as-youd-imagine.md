title: Wifebeaters Are As Dumb As You'd Imagine
---

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="22611beater.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110707174609im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/22611beater.jpg" width="240" height="188" class="image-left"> </span></p>

<p>According <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110707174609/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/26/nyregion/26tapes.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">to the Times</a>, it is often hard for lawyers to prosecute domestic violence cases, because 75 percent of the time, the women who were victimized stop helping prosecutors, often after speaking to the men accused of abusing them. Thankfully, prosecutors have one thing going for them: wifebeaters like to brag, and they are really, really dumb about it.</p>

<p>Since last year, every prisoner telephone call at every NYC jail, except calls to doctors and lawyers, has been recorded. And out of all the criminals, domestic abusers can&apos;t help but discuss, justify, confess and threaten their family members about their crimes. &#x201C;We have the ability now to prove what we&#x2019;ve always suspected, which is that the defendants in domestic violence cases are in constant contact with their victims, and they use various means and methods to try to have the case dropped,&#x201D; said Scott E. Kessler, the domestic violence bureau chief in the Queens district attorney&#x2019;s office. Here are some highlights/excerpts from those conversations:</p><ul><li>Eric Persaud told his girlfriend,<strong> &#x201C;I need you to prepare the kids to start lying.&quot;</strong> He had been charged with burning her face with a hot iron as she knelt in view of their children. He also told her, &#x201C;I need you right now in my corner,&#x201D; and that he had a strategy: she should vanish for the trial. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m smarter than you,&#x201D; he said in one of his 437 calls from Rikers Island.</li><p></p>

<p>	</p><li>Juan Mighty told his brother he was surprised at all the blood after he used a kitchen knife on his longtime girlfriend: &#x201C;I just stuck her like a little,&#x201D; he said. He blamed his actions on jealousy.</li><p></p>

<p>	</p><li>Ishaaq Rahaman, who was charged with scratching his girlfriend with keys, sweet talked her, and urged her not to tell the prosecutor anything useful: &#x201C;Basically tell him things like this: &#x2018;It was just a misunderstanding. I love him. We want to get married and we want to have children together,&#x2019; Say something nice like that, anything like that, you know what I&#x2019;m saying, baby?&#x201D; </li><p></p>

<p>	</p><li>Mohamed Khan, who was charged with slicing his wife&#x2019;s head and shoulder with a meat cleaver, was recorded telling his wife that he was a &#x201C;brand new&#x201D; man and had been under the spell of a &#x201C;passion of love.&#x201D; </li><p></p>

<p>	</p><li>One Brooklyn defendant called his victim from jail 1,200 times.</li></ul><p></p>
