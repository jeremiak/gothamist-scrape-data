<p>Less than two weeks ago, NYC&apos;s Department of City Planning removed the paywall from the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424140647/http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcp/html/bytes/applbyte.shtml">PLUTO dataset</a> (it used to cost $1,500 for the full set). The PLUTO (Primary Land Use Tax Lot Output) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424140647/http://www.socrata.com/blog/new-york-city-opens-pluto-tax-lot-dataset/">dataset contains</a> land use and geographic data for tax lots across the five boroughs. It&apos;s a treasure trove of city data&#x2014;and now thanks to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424140647/https://twitter.com/andrewxhill">Andrew Hill</a> and the folks at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424140647/http://blog.cartodb.com/post/57786792357/pluto-is-back">CartoDB</a>, you can look through <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424140647/http://andrewxhill.github.io/cartodb-examples/scroll-story/pluto/index.html#0">all the maps in an orderly fashion here.</a></p>

<p>If you&apos;ve ever wanted to know how much land in each borough is city owned, or how tall the skyline of Manhattan really is, or how many buildings were constructed pre-1900, or where people are walking up the most flights of steps (the winner: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424140647/http://andrewxhill.github.io/cartodb-examples/scroll-story/pluto/index.html#22">16 flights!</a>), you get the drift: you should check out the maps now!<br>
