<p>A 41-year-old Bronx elementary school teacher <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140616214136/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/bronx-teacher-pleads-guilty-raping-10-year-old-student-article-1.1829215">has pled guilty</a> to raping a 10-year-old student. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140616214136/http://gothamist.com/tags/anthonycriscuolo">Anthony Criscuolo</a>, who taught at PS 386, is expected to be sentenced to 14 years in prison, along with 18 years of post-release supervision. He could have faced 25 years in jail if they had gone to trial, but, &#x201C;in order to not further traumatize this young victim, it was determined that this plea agreement was in her best interest,&#x201D; the Bronx District Attorney&#x2019;s office said in a statement.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140616214136/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/21/appalling_email_from_teacher_to_all.php">The rape came to light</a> last year after the young girl&apos;s mother found appalling sexually explicit emails Criscuolo sent the girl the day after he raped her in the back of a car: &#x201C;I was too rough. Sorry. It&#x2019;s normal,&#x201D; he wrote to the fifth grader. &#x201C;You may feel pain for a few days.&#x201D; He also asked, &#x201C;How did it feel for you?&#x201D;</p>

<p>Criscuolo had informed the girl she was going to receive an award the night of the rape&#x2014;he even forged a letter about the award on school letterhead to give to her mother. The girl&apos;s parents allowed him to take her to the award ceremony; but he instead took her to a parking lot and raped her in his car.</p>

<p>Before the rape, Criscuolo had been &quot;wooing&quot; the girl for months, sending her suggestive emails and buying her gifts, including an iPod Touch. &quot;He used to always have a favorite student who was a girl. He got her a ring and everything &#x2014; a real ring, a diamond ring,&quot; one former student <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140616214136/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/20/family_of_10-year-old_allegedly_rap.php">said last year</a>. &quot;They were acting like they were married.&quot;</p>
