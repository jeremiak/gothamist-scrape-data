<p>Tourists: if they&apos;re not <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131118082025/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/24/tourists_fight_back_against_corrupt.php">getting</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131118082025/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/28/tourist_sues_antique_shop_for_selli.php">ripped off</a> or attacked by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131118082025/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/31/tourist_attacked_by_hammer-wielding.php">hammer-wielding locals</a>, then they&apos;re probably bringing a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131118082025/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/24/psa_to_everyone_dont_bring_your_gun.php">loaded gun to the Empire State Building</a>. Either way, they&apos;re definitely getting ripped off&#x2014;unless they decided to get hammered and skip out on their bill. Police say that&apos;s exactly what happened to one Canadian tourist visiting Manhattan last week. And after he skipped the bill, he allegedly punched (and shattered) a glass door, then punched two police officers.</p>

<p>Daniel Engler, 22, was arrested last Friday at The Chester restaurant in the Gansevoort Hotel after just such a scene allegedly occurred. According <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131118082025/http://nypost.com/2013/11/14/tourist-fights-cops-after-ditching-hotel-bar-check/">to the Post</a>, Engler tried to leave the restaurant without paying around 11 p.m.; he shattered the glass door with a punch, then a bartender apprehended him. </p>

<p>He allegedly screamed, &#x201C;F&#x2014;k you, I ain&#x2019;t going anywhere with you!&#x201D; as cops arrived. Then he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131118082025/http://thevillager.com/2013/11/14/police-blotter-week-of-nov-14-2013/">ended up in a scuffle</a> with two of them, allegedly reaching for both officers&apos; guns and punching them both. One officer was taken to the hospital with a shoulder injury. Engler has now been charged with criminal mischief, assault, obstructing governmental administration and resisting arrest.</p>
