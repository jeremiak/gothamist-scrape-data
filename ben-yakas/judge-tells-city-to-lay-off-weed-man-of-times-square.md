<p>Remember the &quot;Weed Man?&quot; No, not the NJ guy who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150303143500/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/07/the_man_gets_in_the_way_of_njweedma.php">tried to change his name to &quot;NJWeedman.com&quot;</a>&#x2014;the Times Square Weed Man who became ubiquitous around Midtown for carrying a sign reading &quot;Help! I need money for weed.&quot; Last summer, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150303143500/http://gothamist.com/2011/07/27/weed_man_fights_for_his_right_to_be.php#photo-3">he filed a lawsuit against the city</a> complaining that his First, Fourth and 14th Amendment rights had been violated by repeated arrests. And now it seems <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150303143500/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/21/nyregion/beggar-seeking-money-for-marijuana&lt;a href=" -wins-a-victory-in-court.html?_r="2&amp;partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&quot;">that a judge has agreed with him.</a></p>

<p>Joshua Long, a 30-year-old North Carolina native, generally stands outside the Planet Hollywood on Broadway, between 45th and 46th streets with his sign&#x2014;he claims to make about $200 during a four- or five-hour shift. In his lawsuit, he argued that he had been illegally harassed and arrested &#x201C;while lawfully begging and promoting marijuana tolerance.&#x201D; Judge Shira A. Scheindlin has now approved a stipulation in which the city agreed that the police would use their &#x201C;best efforts&#x201D; not to harass or arrest Long without cause. </p>

<p>Long, who was arrested five times between May 2010 and June 2011, is still seeking compensatory and punitive damages and lawyers&#x2019; fees. Ryan Shaffer, an assistant corporation counsel in the city&#x2019;s Law Department, said the stipulation was not an admission of wrongdoing, and that it &#x201C;simply recognizes what has always been understood: to the extent that Mr. Long is behaving lawfully and not blocking pedestrian traffic, he can stand on the sidewalk with his sign.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Of course, the most ironic thing about all this is that Long claims he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150303143500/http://gothamist.com/2010/11/27/willie_nelson_has_post-thanksgiving.php">doesn&apos;t even smoke marijuana anymore</a>!</p>
