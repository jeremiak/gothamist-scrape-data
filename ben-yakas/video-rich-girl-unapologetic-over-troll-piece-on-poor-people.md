                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="101913rich.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20140209095629im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/101913rich.jpg" width="640" height="428"> <br> <i> via Facebook</i></div> <p></p>

<p>Nothing gets the internet more hot and bothered than a racist and/or sexist and/or classist <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140209095629/http://gothamist.com/tags/trolls">troll</a>&#x2014;and the latter route is the one rich 20-year-old college student Rachael Sacks took this week with her tone deaf article <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140209095629/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/17/rich_girl_begs_poor_people_to_have.php">all about how poor people judge her and shit.</a> Sacks, who is also a self-professed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140209095629/http://thoughtcatalog.com/rachael-sacks/2013/09/confession-im-a-chronic-female-masturbator/">expert on female masturbation</a>, is unapologetic over the article and the outcry, as you can see in the video below. And considering that she made <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140209095629/http://www.newseum.org/todaysfrontpages/hr.asp?fpVname=NY_NYP&amp;ref_pge=lst">the cover of the NY Post</a>, why should she be!</p>

<p>Sacks <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140209095629/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2466231/Rachael-Sacks-Wealthy-college-student-does-regret-essay-poor-people.html">told the Daily Mail</a> about how it must have been &quot;a really slow horrible news day&quot; for her article to have jumped to the stop of CNN. She claims it is &quot;reverse elitism&quot; to assume people are going to relate you for something they don&apos;t know: </p>

<blockquote>No, I&apos;m not repentant about what I said. I don&apos;t regret what I said. If people paid attention and realized what I was saying it&apos;s that you shouldn&apos;t shame people for what they are, what they have, you shouldn&apos;t have to pretend to be poor to make people like you, that&apos;s stupid. You should be who you are and other people should accept it.</blockquote>

<p>Of course, there&apos;s a fundamental flaw in her logical, considering the fact that Sacks began her piece with an assumption that a supermarket cashier is thinking uncharitable thoughts about her. So she&apos;s assuming that poor cashier (who she assumes is poor) is judging her for being rich is a projection of her own insecurities&#x2014;but at least she acknowledges that her problem is an insignificant one: &quot;The criticism and the attention is stupid. I&apos;m young, I&apos;m irrelevant, why don&apos;t you care about other things?&quot;</p>

<p>But hey, if you write it, they will come&#x2014;and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140209095629/https://twitter.com/RAnSacks">come they have on Twitter</a>. Sacks seems to be taking things in stride at least, and perhaps has started to become aware of the fact she will greatly regret this piece in a few years when it comes up on every Google search about her:</p>
