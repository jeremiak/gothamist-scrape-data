<p>Over the weekend, photographer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504140953/http://allenhenson.com/">Allen Henson</a> went out on the town with model Cheyenne Lutek to expand upon their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504140953/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/11/nsfw_photos_get_ready_for_more_topl.php#photo-1">topless eating</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504140953/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/09/yes_women_can_go_topless_in_nyc_but_1.php">photoshoot last week</a>, and happened to run into <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504140953/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/14/nypd_boobs_naked_diner_poses_with_c.php">some very friendly cops</a>. &quot;A nice stroll on a New York Summer evening. With @Cheyenne_Lutek and a couple of NYC&apos;s finest boys in blue,&quot; he tweeted. But no boob goes punished with the NYPD: the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504140953/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/boobs-nypd-cops-pose-photo-nude-woman-article-1.1400606?localLinksEnabled=false">Daily News reports that</a> the two officers are under investigation.</p>

<p><strong>&quot;One of them just couldn&apos;t stop grinning,&quot;</strong> Henson noted. &quot;The other one was kind of awkward.&quot; Police sources told the News that the Internal Affairs Bureau is investigating the matter, though it appears likely the probe will be handed to the cops&apos; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504140953/http://www.nytimes.com/1991/04/15/nyregion/integrity-control-officers-policing-the-police.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm">integrity control officer</a>, who aren&apos;t always <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504140953/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/19/nypd_integrity_officers_mom_caught.php">as noble</a> as you&apos;d like to believe.</p>

<p>The officers are officially allowed to pose for pictures with people, but because of the <em>nature</em> of this particular photo, they&apos;re likely to get a slap on the wrist (even if it&apos;s just a verbal one). Which doesn&apos;t exactly seem like the best message to send to officers who are already mighty confused about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504140953/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/15/cops_told_not_to_arrest_topless_wom.php">the city&apos;s topless laws.</a></p>
