Jackie Barcliff, 44, has been charged with attempted murder, rape and criminal sex act against the woman who was here for the Occupy Wall Street anniversary. Police have also charged Barcliff with raping a 14-year-old on August 12th in midtown; he allegedly offered the teen a place to stay overnight and then raped her during the night.</p>

<p>The attack at the East River took place around 2 a.m. on Monday, September 10th; the victim, who sustained a broken pelvis and other serious injuries in the attack, later told police that she recognized Barcliff from previous OWS demonstrations. Cops referred to Barcliff as a fellow OWS protester who &quot;has frequented other OWS gathering sites in lower Manhattan in the past.&quot; </p>
