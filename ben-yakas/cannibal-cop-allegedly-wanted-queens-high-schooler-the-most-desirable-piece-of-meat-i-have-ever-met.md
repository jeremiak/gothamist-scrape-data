<p>We&apos;re inching closer to the actual trial of former NYPD officer Gilberto Valle, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508194352/http://gothamist.com/tags/cannibalcop">the alleged &quot;cannibal cop&quot;</a> who is accused of wanting to eat &quot;girl meat&quot; for Thanksgiving and planning to butcher and eat his own wife, among other things. But in the meantime, more weird details keep getting released in the pre-trial: the latest is that Valle <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508194352/http://pix11.com/2013/02/14/cannibal-cop-targeted-catholic-high-school-softball-player-prosecutors/#axzz2KygLF2g3">had been targeting</a> an 18-year-old Queens high school softball player: &#x201C;The most desirable piece of meat I have ever met,&#x201D; Valle allegedly e-mailed a friend in April 2012.  &#x201C;She is a must-have.&#x201D;</p>

<p>The girl, who was a star player on the Archbishop Molloy HS girls&#x2019; softball team, graduated in 2012. Valle also graduated from Archbishop Molloy about ten years before. Prosecutors want to include phone logs from May 5th, 2012&#x2014;they believe Valle thought there was softball practice that day, and implicitly, will argue he was looking for her in particular. In August 2012 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508194352/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/cannibal_cop_eyed_hs_girl_judge_T1bz85HxIWEovzFlH7NFYK?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Local">he allegedly referred to her</a> again, noting &quot;My oven is pretty big, and I can take the racks out.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Manhattan Federal Court Judge Paul Gardephe hasn&apos;t decided about that yet, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508194352/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/judge-denies-troubling-evidence-cannibal-article-1.1264745">but he ruled yesterday</a> against including other pieces of evidence which he said were &quot;likely to disgust and sicken the jury.&quot; That includes a video of a goat being slaughtered, and an online chat between Valle and an alleged conspirator named &quot;Moody Blues&quot; who bragged about having eaten a 5-year-old girl. &#x201C;There is no claim that Mr. Valle conspired to kidnap a five year old,&#x201D; the judge said. &#x201C;It would have an unfair, prejudicial effect on the defendant.&#x201D;</p>

WPIX also talked to Valle&apos;s father, Gilberto Valle, Sr., about how his son is doing: &#x201C;&#x201D;He&#x2019;s very strong, he&#x2019;s holding up. I&#x2019;m very proud of him.&#x201D; He added he didn&apos;t believe any of the charges against him.</p>
