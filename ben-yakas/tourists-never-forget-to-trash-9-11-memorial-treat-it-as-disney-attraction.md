<p>Earlier this summer, people were appalled after bratty little kids from Junior High School 292 in East New York <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150523014129/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/24/little_brats_kicked_out_of_911_memo.php">were kicked out of the 9/11 Museum and Memorial</a> for throwing baseballs and trash into the reflecting pool. But it seems there&apos;s another group has been treating the memorial as their own personal &quot;Disney attraction:&quot; tourists. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150523014129/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/it_play_ground_zero_now_qAzM19XpnqwuoAbdwOmC9J">According to the Post</a>, first responders and victims&#x2019; families have been complaining about tourists treating the solemn memorial like Rye Playland. One tourist &#x201C;spilt coffee all over my son&#x2019;s name...after she arose from sitting on the names,&#x201D; a relative wrote to Bill Doyle of the Coalition of 9/11 Families. First responder Marianne Pizzitola said she saw people acting &#x201C;like this was a park or playground.&#x201D;</p>

<p>&#x201C;People laughed and took pictures smiling, and so many people leaned on the tablets with all of my friends names engraved in them, holding Starbucks cups, like it was a kitchen table,&#x201D; Pizzitola, head of the FDNY EMS Retirees Association, wrote in a letter to Memorial President Joe Daniels.</p>

<p>But not everyone is upset about the cheerful atmosphere: &#x201C;I have always assumed that as time goes by, people will come there for gentle recreation &#x2014; walking, sitting in the dappled sunshine, even picnicking &#x2014; so I am rather surprised that anyone thinks this is not acceptable behavior,&#x201D; said Kathy Bowden, who lost her brother in the attacks.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Post says there are more guards out there now policing the memorial in anticipation of of the upcoming 9/11 anniversary, to prevent scratches or damage to the monument&#x2014;previously, a custodian <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150523014129/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/28/police_investigating_allah_wakbar_g.php">found the words &quot;Allah Wakbar&quot;</a> written on a granite seat at the memorial.</p>
