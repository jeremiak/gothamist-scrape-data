<p>A Queens principal has been removed from her position after she was accused of having sex with a guard, an assistant professor, and a student&apos;s parent. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150224062124/http://nypost.com/2014/05/04/queens-principal-probed-over-sex-in-school-during-class-hours/">According to the Post</a>, Annie Schmutz Seifullah, 35, was escorted out of the 7th-12th-grade Robert Wagner Secondary School of Arts and Technology in Long Island City on Thursday after she was accused of having sex there during school hours at various times with various partners. </p>

<p>&quot;We are appalled by these disturbing allegations and acted swiftly to remove the principal while the matter is under investigation,&quot; a Department of Education spokesman said. &quot;This type of alleged behavior is completely unacceptable for any DOE employee.&quot; </p>

<p>The accusations came from a student&apos;s father who had been dating Seifullah since last year. That father, whose name hasn&apos;t been released, came forward because he felt she &quot;played me for a fool&quot; and cheated on him: &quot;Ms. Seifullah clearly used her power and position as principal to...seek several sexual partners at her school,&quot; he told the Post.</p>

<p>Among other things, the father gave investigators three DOE laptops he obtained while living with Seifullah; they allegedly contain multiple photos and videos of Seifullah engaging in sex acts. There was audio of Seifullah admitting she engaged in oral sex with an NYPD school-safety agent in the school security office, and with a visiting assistant principal in a book-storage room during school hours.</p>

<p>It seems she cheated on him with at least one of those two men, because the dad yelled at her on the tape, &quot;You gave him [expletive deleted] while my child was in the building.&quot;</p>

<p>Seifullah joins a long list of city educators who have been accused of sexual wrongdoing in school, including a Bronx principal <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150224062124/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/17/creepy_bronx_high_school_principal.php">who found copy machines sexy</a>, a principal and assistant who were embroiled in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150224062124/http://gothamist.com/2010/11/14/doe_seeking_to_terminate_lesbian_ad.php">a love affair that turned into <em>Fatal Attraction</em></a>, and a principal who saw her <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150224062124/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/03/students_plaster_school_with_princi.php">sexy photos plastered all over school by students.</a></p>
