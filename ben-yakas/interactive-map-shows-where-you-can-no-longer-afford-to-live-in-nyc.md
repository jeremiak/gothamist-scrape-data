<p>We live in a city in which our mayor argues that a lack of housing is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150310065918/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/19/bloomberg_thinks_homelessness_is_go.php">a &quot;good sign&quot; of a vibrant economy</a>, so here&apos;s a question that&apos;s on most people&apos;s minds every waking moment: where the hell can we find <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150310065918/http://gothamist.com/tags/affordablehousing">an affordable place to live</a> in NYC in 2013? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150310065918/http://vizynary.com/2013/10/30/where-in-new-york-city-has-property-become-more-expensive/">Chris Walker analyzed</a> market value changes between 2008 and 2012 on nearly a million residential properties across NYC to build the data visualization on housing prices you can see below. (Click on the map to drag it.)</p>

<p>Short analysis: Manhattan and Western Brooklyn have unsurprisingly continued to skyrocket over the last four years. Greenpoint, Chelsea, Southern Brooklyn, parts of Harlem and the Garment District have all exploded in prices; housing prices are also on the rise in the south Bronx. More surprising: they are on the decline all over Queens and eastern Brooklyn. </p>

<p>So despite <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150310065918/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/17/bushwick_residents_fleeing_for_ridg.php">certain reports to the contrary</a>, we guess Ridgewood is still the way to go. Of course, take comfort knowing that everywhere in NYC is overpriced, it&apos;s probably not going to get better in the immediate future, and we&apos;ve been stuck in a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150310065918/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/09/ny_times_reportage_on_brooklyn_gent.php">gentrification loop for over two decades now</a>. Did we say take comfort? We meant take shelter. Ya know, if you can afford to. </p>
