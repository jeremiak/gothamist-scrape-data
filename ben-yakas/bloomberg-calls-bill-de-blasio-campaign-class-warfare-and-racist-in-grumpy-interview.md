<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428101359/http://gothamist.com/tags/bloomberg">Mayor Bloomberg</a> recently sat down <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428101359/http://nymag.com/news/politics/bloomberg/in-conversation-2013-9/">with NY Magazine for a major interview</a> chockfull of classic Bloombergisms, an interview in which he accuses the Bill de Blasio campaign of racism, dismisses poor people with air conditioning, reveals his abiding love for Russian billionaires, and generally contemplates his legacy. The whole thing is really worth reading, as it encapsulates everything wonderfully entertaining and terrifyingly real about Bloomberg&apos;s don&apos;t-give-a-fuck attitude (to be fair, there&apos;s lots of acknowledgement of his good work for the city as well). But seeing as how the interview has already provoked an outcry on Twitter, we&apos;ve picked out some of the highlights of it for you below.</p>

<p>You&apos;re not really poor if you have air conditioning, so stop complaining:</p>

<blockquote>So if that&#x2019;s what you describe as income inequality&#x2014;that&#x2019;s just not an apt description. One of the things that&#x2019;s different today is the poor&#x2014;80 percent [nationally] have air-conditioning. Seventy percent have cars. When we grew up we didn&#x2019;t have air-conditioning. Air-conditioning in the schools, the subways. Are you crazy? Now, by most of the world&#x2019;s standards, you ain&#x2019;t poor. The old measure just looked at your income. It didn&#x2019;t look at what services you need. I&#x2019;m not being cavalier about it, but most places in the world our poor are wealthy. There&#x2019;s a lot of tragedy around the world.</blockquote>

<p>Bloomberg doesn&apos;t <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428101359/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/19/tell_us_what_bloombergs_legacy_is_n.php">coddle the rich</a>, he coddles your stomach:</p>

<blockquote><strong>People still say, &#x201C;Bloomberg is in the tank for Wall Street.&#x201D; </strong>
I&#x2019;m in the tank for industries in New York City! That&#x2019;s my job. That&#x2019;s the way people here eat!

<p><strong>But you have defended the financial industry when it&#x2019;s done bad things.</strong><br>
Oh, yes, sure. And they have done some bad things. I suppose everybody has, every industry has. But the mortgage crisis was not the exclusive creation of the banks. We all wanted everybody to get a mortgage regardless of whether they could afford it, and that eventually leads to euphoria and exaggeration and to sloppiness and a variety of those things. But Fannie and Freddie were as guilty as everybody. I&#x2019;m not taking the banks off the hook. But I don&#x2019;t think that just because you&#x2019;re a banker you should be vilified.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>Bloomberg&apos;s wary of making any endorsements...but he basically endorses Quinn:</p>

<blockquote>Whether you are in favor of Chris Quinn becoming mayor or not, I will tell you this: She did a very good job for seven and a half years of keeping legislation that never should have made it to the floor, that would have been damaging to the city, from ever getting there. And she deserves a lot of the credit for what&#x2019;s gone on in the city in the last seven and a half years.

<p>I thought the Times was right in their editorials on Lhota and Quinn. I&#x2019;m very pleased about that.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>Bloomberg thinks de Blasio&apos;s campaign is racist because he used his mixed-race family to...acknowledge he&apos;s in a mixed-race family? Hey, it&apos;s not like Bloomberg <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428101359/http://www.nysun.com/editorials/the-real-extremists/77441/">ever pointed out he is Jewish to attract the Jewish vote.</a></p>

<blockquote>I mean he&#x2019;s making an appeal using his family to gain support. I think it&#x2019;s pretty obvious to anyone watching what he&#x2019;s been doing. I do not think he himself is racist. It&#x2019;s comparable to me pointing out I&#x2019;m Jewish in attracting the Jewish vote. You tailor messages to your audiences and address issues you think your audience cares about.

<p>But his whole campaign is that there are two different cities here. And I&#x2019;ve never liked that kind of division. The way to help those who are less fortunate is, number one, to attract more very fortunate people. They are the ones that pay the bills. The people that would get very badly hurt here if you drive out the very wealthy are the people he professes to try to help. Tearing people apart with this &#x201C;two cities&#x201D; thing doesn&#x2019;t make any sense to me. It&#x2019;s a destructive strategy for those you want to help the most. He&#x2019;s a very populist, very left-wing guy, but this city is not two groups, and if to some extent it is, it&#x2019;s one group paying for services for the other.</p>

<p>It&#x2019;s a shame, because I&#x2019;ve always thought he was a very smart guy.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428101359/http://gothamist.com/tags/stopandfrisk">Stop-and-frisk</a> is the best nah-nah-nah I can&apos;t hear you:</p>

<blockquote>The judge is just wrong. We have not racial-profiled, we&#x2019;ve gone where the crime is. I don&#x2019;t have any doubts that she will be reversed right away. The question is, will our successor continue the battle? I cannot get involved in the next administration, nor should I. But for something like that I would certainly make my views known.</blockquote>

<p>He has no regrets about how he handled Occupy Wall Street:</p>

<blockquote><strong>Could there have been a compromise with Occupy Wall Street that didn&#x2019;t involve running them out in the middle of the night? </strong>
We waited two months, which I think was more than adequate. I was worried that a court would say that you haven&#x2019;t given them enough time, so we waited what I thought was a reasonable amount of time. Then we called in everybody and said, &#x201C;Tonight, this is what we&#x2019;re doing.&#x201D; I had at various times during the two months discussed options with the Police Department and the Fire Department and the Health Department and the Sanitation Department and legal counsel. So when it came time I said, &#x201C;Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!&#x201D; And they executed it.

<p><strong>So no second thoughts?</strong><br>
None whatsoever.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>He&apos;s not out of touch, he didn&apos;t buy the election, why do people keep bringing those things up:</p>

<blockquote><strong>When people say, &#x201C;He bought a third term,&#x201D; does that bother you?</strong>
Number one, it isn&#x2019;t even accurate. I mean, people vote. And the same organizations that carry those criticisms kept raising their ad rates. Talk about duplicitous.

<p><strong>The broader criticism is that because of your wealth you don&#x2019;t have a feel for the way people really live in the city.</strong><br>
Will you show me all of the man-in-the-street, sympathetic, mayoral candidates? The last time I met one of them on the subway was a long time ago. Let&#x2019;s not get too carried away. You want to make a bet that whoever&#x2019;s the next mayor skips security at the front gate of City Hall? You want to make a bet they don&#x2019;t have an office with everybody else? Come on. This is ridiculous.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>Everyone is happy living in a nanny state <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428101359/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/18/watch_fran_lebowitz_hilariously_psy.php">except Fran Lebowitz</a>:</p>

<blockquote>Fran Lebowitz is probably the only person whose life I haven&#x2019;t saved.</blockquote>

<p>Seriously, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428101359/http://nymag.com/news/politics/bloomberg/in-conversation-2013-9/">go read the full thing</a>&#x2014;especially if you want to know what landmark Bloomberg &quot;jokingly&quot; wouldn&apos;t mind named after him. Already, de Blasio <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428101359/http://politicker.com/2013/09/mayor-bloomberg-blasts-bill-de-blasios-class-warfare-and-racist-campaign/">has been asked about</a> the quotes, telling NY Observer &#x201C;if that&#x2019;s exactly what he said, it&#x2019;s obviously inappropriate and I&#x2019;m surprised to hear him say it.&#x201D; Below, check out some of the reactions of Twitter to the interview: </p>
