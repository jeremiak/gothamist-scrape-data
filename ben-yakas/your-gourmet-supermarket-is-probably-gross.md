<p>Just because you&apos;re paying $20 for organic Alaskan salmon from your upscale local grocery doesn&apos;t mean it&apos;s any cleaner than the frozen chunk of fish that&apos;s been sitting at D&apos;Agostino&apos;s for days: state inspectors gave <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140405232037/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/even_posh_stores_in_the_gross_ery_Za17j5RoiYkRwE60wIBnGL?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">failing grades</a> to 151 supermarkets and gourmet specialty shops in Manhattan during their most recent 2010 state inspections. Blast, we just broke our <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140405232037/http://www.snpp.com/episodes/BABF09">third monocle this week</a>!</p>

<p>Among the worst offenders was the Whole Foods in Columbus Circle, which had 31 problems last year, including wastewater that was allegedly backing up into the meat area and olives mixing around the olive bar (oh my heavens!). Inspectors destroyed 44 pounds of ground beef after finding it was contaminated with turkey meat; the store also failed its re-inspection earlier this month, and was fine $1,200. Last fall, a tipster <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140405232037/http://gothamist.com/2010/10/16/how_the_meat_is_prepared_at_whole_f.php">sent us</a> the above photo from the Whole Foods at Union Square, noting that the prepared foods (cooked, prepared turkey breasts) were being carted upstairs alongside filthy garbage cans and employees with dirty dustbins. Another tipster <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140405232037/http://gothamist.com/2010/10/23/more_gross_conditions_from_the_city.php">sent us photos</a> of workers from Agata &amp; Valentina dropping their gourmet fish on the sidewalk for several minutes.</p>

<p>Other upscale supermarkets who were given violations include the East Village Barnyard Cheese Shop, whose nine problems included having only scalding hot water in the bathroom; Chelsea Market grocery BuonItalia, which had 13 problems that included a cracked door to the caviar case and three pounds of anchovies that inspectors tossed; and Hudson Yards deli The Hamptons Market Place, which had 12 problems that included an improperly designed gelato dispenser.</p>
