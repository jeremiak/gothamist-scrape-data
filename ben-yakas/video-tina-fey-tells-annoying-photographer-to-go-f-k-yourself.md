<p>All week, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509173838/http://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/tina-fey-responds-to-taylor-swifts-comments-in-vanity-fair-it-was-just-a-joke-201363#ixzz2Mn360nLP">tabloids</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509173838/http://www.etonline.com/news/131321_Tina_Fey_Responds_To_Taylor_Swift/index.html">paparazzi</a> have been doing their best <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509173838/http://www.grantland.com/blog/hollywood-prospectus/post/_/id/70441/dear-internet-stop-trying-to-make-the-tina-fey-taylor-swift-feud-happen">to ignite</a> a flame war between singer/famous young person Taylor Swift and beloved comedians <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509173838/http://gothamist.com/tags/tinafey">Tina Fey</a> and Amy Poehler, all because Fey and Poehler made a (pretty tame) joke about Swift at last month&apos;s Golden Globes. Fey was confronted by a photographer (see the video below) and asked about the non-feud while crossing the street in the West 70&apos;s in Manhattan yesterday, and she responded appropriately, &quot;Go f--k yourself.&quot; It seems she&apos;s learned a thing or two <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509173838/http://gothamist.com/tags/alecbaldwin">from her old co-star.</a></p>

<p>To recap this stupidity: at the Golden Globe awards, Fey and Poehler joked about Swift&apos;s dating life (see the video below), warning her to &#x201C;stay away from Michael J. Fox&#x2019;s son,&#x201D; and maybe consider taking a little &quot;&apos;me time&apos; to learn about herself.&quot; Vanity Fair then asked Swift about it for their cover story this month, and she decided to quote Madeline Albright without quoting her: &#x201C;You know, Katie Couric is one of my favorite people, because she said to me she had heard a quote that she loved, that said, &#x2018;There&#x2019;s a special place in hell for women who don&#x2019;t help other women.&#x2019;&#x201D; </p>

<p>Swift is 22 or 23 or whatever years old&#x2014;she&apos;s young and famous and living in a very bright spotlight, and she has the right to date whomever she wants and write whatever semi-biographical, semi-embarrassing lyrics about said experiences, and then go out and repeat the cycle all over again. But Fey and Poehler are also allowed to make fun of her, as a public person who makes funny decisions, like dating Jake Gyllenhaal&#x2014;and their jokes were rather gentle about it, anyway. And really, it doesn&apos;t sound like either side cares that much about it&#x2014;at least not as much as certain parts of the internet would like them to.</p>

<p>Poehler of course had the best reaction to this whole thing, because she is the best: &quot;Aw, I feel bad if she was upset,&quot; she <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509173838/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/amy-poehler-taylor-swift-i-426113">told Hollywood Reporter.</a> &quot;I am a feminist, and she is a young and talented girl. <strong>That being said, I do agree I am going to hell. But for other reasons. Mostly boring tax stuff</strong>.&quot;</p>
