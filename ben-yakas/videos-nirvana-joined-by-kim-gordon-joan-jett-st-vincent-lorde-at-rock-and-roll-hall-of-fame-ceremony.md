<p>Nirvana, KISS, Hall &amp; Oates, Peter Gabriel, Cat Stevens, The E-Street Band and Linda Ronstadt <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429153440/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/11/nyregion/rock-and-roll-hall-of-fame-welcomes-its-newest-members.html?ref=music">were all inducted</a> into the Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame at Barclays Center last night. Amongst the many highlights of the evening was the night-ending four-song set from the surviving members of Nirvana (Dave Grohl, Krist Novoselic, Pat Smear), fronted by Joan Jett (&quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot;), Kim Gordon (&quot;Aneurysm&quot;), Annie Clark (&quot;Lithium&quot;), and Lorde (&quot;All Apologies&quot;). Watch those clips and a whole lot more below!</p>

<p>Here&apos;s Nirvana&apos;s introduction by Michael Stipe of REM. &quot;This is not just pop music,&quot; he said at one point during the 17 minute speech. &quot;This is something much greater than that.&quot;</p>

<p>Here&apos;s the acceptance speech by the band along with Kurt Cobain&apos;s widow Courtney Love, his mother Wendy O&#x2019;Connor, and his daughter Francis Bean Cobain. O&apos;Connor noted that her son &quot;would have been so proud. He&#x2019;d say he wasn&#x2019;t, but he would be.&quot;</p>

<p>Here are a few short clips of Gordon rocking the fuck out.</p>

<p>And here&apos;s Lorde, who was born a few years after the song was released, doing &quot;All Apologies&quot; (with Novoselic on accordion!).</p>

<p>It&apos;s worth noting that no one pulled a move like Rush&apos;s Alex Lifeson, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429153440/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-zV4GaElko">whose speech last year</a> at the ceremony consisted solely of: &quot;blah blah blah, blah blah blah, blah blah, blah? Blah blah blah.&quot;</p>

<p>Nirvana may have been the biggest name, but there were plenty of other heavyweight performances. Most of it isn&apos;t online, but a few clips have surfaced already. First up is Cat Stevens performing &quot;Wild World.&quot;</p>
