<p>As we all know from reading <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504135738/http://www.askmen.com/top_10/cars/top-10-reasons-women-cant-drive.html">AskMen.com</a>, men are always and forever better drivers than women, because &quot;men invented cars and have been piloting them with greater skill since day one.&quot; Since <em>day one</em>! Unfortunately, some male drivers are still insecure about their inherent mastery of the motor vehicle, and one thin-skinned man/driver/p.o.s. allegedly hit a woman who criticized his performance behind the wheel. </p>

<p>Police have arrested 25-year-old Alex Hernandez for hitting a 50-year-old woman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504135738/http://gothamist.com/2014/08/19/video_driver_who_made_u-turn_to_run.php">with his car in The Bronx this month</a>. The woman, whose name hasn&apos;t been released, was crossing the street at Bruckner Boulevard and West 138th Street at 1 p.m. on August 18th when the incident happened. Police sources <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504135738/http://www.nydailynews.com/blogs/theshack/nabbed-cops-grab-bronx-man-accused-running-woman-criticized-driving-blog-entry-1.1918552">told the News</a> that the woman yelled at Hernandez, who was driving a white sedan at the time, as he drove by. Hernandez then allegedly made a U-turn, drove back, and hit the woman.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504135738/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20140819/mott-haven/hit-and-run-driver-rams-woman-after-she-pushed-friends-safety-witnesses">Witnesses told DNAInfo</a> that the woman pushed two men, Henry Maldonado and Julio Carrillo, out of the way of the car. &quot;I felt angry, man,&quot; said Maldonado, who added that the three all lived in the same building and had gone out for coffee together that day. &quot;It was unnecessary.&quot;</p>

<p>The woman was taken to Lincoln Hospital in critical condition, and is reportedly on the mend now. Hernandez allegedly fled the scene of the crime, and wasn&apos;t arrested until yesterday. He has been charged with vehicular assault, failure to notify accident, and failure to report accident. </p>
