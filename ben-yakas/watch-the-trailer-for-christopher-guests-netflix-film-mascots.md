<p>It&apos;s been three years since his very under appreciated HBO one-season wonder <em>Family Tree</em> and nearly a decade since his last full-length feature (the slightly underwhelming <em>For Your Consideration</em>), but Christopher Guest has finally gotten the band back together for his latest mockumentary, <em>Mascots</em>. </p>

<p>The movie, which will open in select theaters and be available on Netflix on October 10th, dives into the weird and colorful world of sports mascots as they compete for the World Mascot Association championship&apos;s Gold Fluffy Award. (Not a real thing, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021121504/http://associationsnow.com/2015/03/mascots-now-association-call/">the National Mascot Association</a> is.)  In other words, it&apos;s like <em>Best In Show</em> for furries, which sounds pretty great to us. Check out the trailer below, which includes some classic Fred Willard verbal buffoonery and the finest Parker Posey dance moves one could hope for. And it even looks like Guest has been going to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021121504/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVoL4nIMRAA">Corky St. Clair&apos;s</a> hairdresser again.</p>

<p>Most of the Guest regulars are back, including Jane Lynch, Parker Posey, Fred Willard, Ed Begley Jr., Jennifer Coolidge, John Michael Higgins, Bob Balaban, and Christopher Moynihan (conspicuously absent: Eugene Levy, Catherine O&apos;Hara, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021121504/http://gothamist.com/2008/01/08/michael_mckean.php">Michael McKean</a>); they&apos;ll be alongside <em>Family Tree</em> star Chris O&apos;Dowd and Zach Woods, a human being whose whole comedic persona was basically forged out of side characters in Christopher Guest movies (see: his roles in <em>Silicon Valley</em>, <em>The Office</em>, <em>Veep</em>).</p>

<p>Guest <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021121504/http://www.ew.com/article/2016/09/01/mascots-trailer-christopher-guest">explained to EW</a> how he and co-writer Jim Piddock decided to focus on mascots after the HBO show ended: &quot;He thought this world of mascots would be interesting to do a real documentary about,&quot; Guest said. &quot;I said, &apos;Well, I don&#x2019;t know about that, but I certainly know I can do this the way I do it.&#x2019; I had an interest in this myself going back quite a way. When my kids were small, we would go to places that had mascots. I found it odd, I guess.&quot;</p>
