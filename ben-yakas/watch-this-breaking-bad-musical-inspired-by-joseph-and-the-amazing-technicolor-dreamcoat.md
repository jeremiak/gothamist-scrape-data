<p>We&apos;re already halfway done with the edge-of-your-seat final season of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424154146/http://gothamist.com/tags/breakingbad"><em>Breaking Bad</em></a>, and the thought of saying goodbye to Walter White, Jesse Pinkman and friends makes us want to take a long trip to Belize with Old Yeller. Thankfully, we&apos;ll always have the DVDs and live musicals inspired by Andrew Lloyd Webber to hold onto&#x2014;wait, what? That&apos;s right: below, watch an hour-long <em>Breaking Bad</em> musical inspired by Andrew Lloyd Weber&apos;s <em>Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat</em>.</p>

<p><em>Walter White and the Amazing Blue Crystal Meth</em> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424154146/http://losangeles.ucbtheatre.com/performances/view/28703">was performed</a> earlier this summer at the Upright Citizens Brigade theater in Los Angeles. It&apos;s quite a fun ride through the first 5.1 seasons of the show (it ends with Hank&apos;s big W.W. toilet revelation). The shows is littered with fantastic, obsessive details from the show; highlights include Hank&apos;s hilarious theme song &quot;Hank&apos;s On The Case!&quot; (skip to 12:45), Walt singing about understanding what it feels like to be a man after every horrible deed, Gale&apos;s amazingly goofy solo song &quot;Be My Friend,&quot; Hank and the Cousins performing a dance fight, Mike sweeping the ground for &quot;I&apos;ll Take Care Of It,&quot; Skyler singing her ode to &quot;Silverfish,&quot; and a <strike>pitch</strike> bitch perfect Jesse singing &quot;I&apos;m In Love With You Bitch&quot; when he meets Jane.</p>
