<p>A Crown Heights woodworker has been renting out part of his warehouse as a trailer park for tourists to be able to experience the authentic Brooklyn trailer park life. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150413013615/http://nypost.com/2013/09/08/brooklyn-artist-rents-out-grungy-trailers-to-tourists/">Post profiles</a> artist <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150413013615/http://kellamclark.com/">Kellam Clark</a>, who has been advertising the Dean Street campers on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150413013615/https://www.airbnb.com/">Airbnb</a> since May. &quot;After a few months, it became clear this is an experience people really enjoy,&quot; Clark told them. &quot;They enjoy being close to and being a part of what New York is in their mind.&quot;</p>

<p>There are three campers (1954 Shasta trailer with a twin bed, a 1968 four-bed Shasta, and a four-person Avion trailer) and three rooms in the actual warehouse to rent. The trailers have a refrigerator and stove, but neither work. There&#x2019;s one bathroom for all guests inside the warehouse. There&apos;s a peephole behind a mirror in the bathroom. We&apos;re sure <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150413013615/http://gothamist.com/tags/gentrification">there are some New Yorkers</a> who would gladly pay top dollar for this experience as well.</p>

<p>It&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150413013615/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/13/your_airbnb_rental_listing_is_illeg.php">also technically illegal</a>&#x2014;a judge ruled in May that Airbnb users are violating a state law prohibiting landlords from renting out apartments for fewer than 30 days. Which means if anyone asks, you have to say you are working on a project while there. It also means that watching normal TV programming isn&apos;t allowed (because &quot;advertisements are like acid on the brain&quot;) and Clark and his fellow artists &#x201C;reserve the right to be nude when it is not inappropriate.&quot;</p>

<p>The reviews have been mixed to say the least: one reviewer called it &quot;the real Brooklyn experience,&quot; adding, &quot;Even if the area and the first glance may give you a wrong impression, it is a great place to stay.&#x201D; A Berlin tourist called it the worst night of her life. &#x201C;We flew in terror after the first night. In the handout we received at the beginning we were asked not to open the door for the police &#x2014; no matter what they say and how they would try to get in.&#x201D;</p>
