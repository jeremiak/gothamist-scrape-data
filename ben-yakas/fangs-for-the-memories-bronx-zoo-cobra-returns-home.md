<p>After nearly a week of panic and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528113657/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/31/missssssssssssssing_bronx_zoo_cobra.php">pun-filled</a> stories, <em>Cobra Watch 2011: Black Adder&apos;s Revenge&#x2014;A Bronx Zoo Tale!</em> has finally come to an end. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528113657/http://gothamist.com/tags/egyptiancobra">Egyptian Cobra</a> who had gone missing last Friday was found &quot;alive and well&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528113657/http://www.bronxzoo.com/multimedia/headlines/cobra-found.aspx">yesterday</a> by Bronx Zoo employees inside a nonpublic area of the zoo&#x2019;s Reptile House, not far from where she disappeared. The two-foot-long lady is back in her cage now, but she wrote us that she was plotting her escape once again: &quot;<strong>I plan to rally my Bronx Zoo Cobra Nation and send a clear message that I, even while incarcerated, can reach outside this Reptile House and make my presence known.</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>We won&apos;t be a rattle-tail about who is behind the Bronx Zoos Cobra Twitter/Email, but her last <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528113657/http://twitter.com/BronxZoosCobra/status/53802533159829504">tweet</a> backs this up: &quot;Just regurgitated my iPhone. Oh, it&apos;s ssso on now. You&apos;ll never guess what&apos;s coming. #freethebronxzooscobra.&quot; Zoo officials said the Reptile House would remain closed for several days while they investigated how the snake had gotten free...since Bronx Zoo Director Jim Breheny admitted on &quot;The Early Show&quot; this morning that they <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528113657/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2011/04/01/earlyshow/living/petplanet/main20049601.shtml">still weren&apos;t exactly sure</a> how she esssssssssscaped. </p>

<p>Some of the cobra&apos;s Twitter followers were disappointed that she wasn&apos;t really having a whirlwind adventure around the city during her escape: &quot;Wait...the snake just April fooled us all. He was hiding at the zoo all along,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528113657/http://twitter.com/CaMacKid/status/53586681969909762">tweeted</a> CaMacKid. &quot;The Bronx Zoo snake never made it out of the zoo. Bigger disappointment than <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528113657/http://gothamist.com/2009/10/15/and_in_colorado_little_boy_floats_a.php">balloon boy</a>,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528113657/http://twitter.com/sarahplease/status/53583881219227648">tweeted</a> sarahplease. Others were convinced that this was a publicity stunt by the Bronx Zoo, which Breheny denied this morning: &quot;Obviously, that certainly wasn&apos;t our intent with this whole thing. We were honest and, when we issued the statement, we knew it was going to be news. But we were, I think, taken aback by the sensation of the social media. And you know, although we appreciated everyone&apos;s goodwill toward us and support, I mean, we were concentrating on recovering the animal. Because it was a serious situation. &quot;</p>

<p>So what&apos;s next for the cool-headed cobra? Since she hasn&apos;t been named yet, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528113657/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2011/03/31/2011-03-31_bronx_zoos_deadly_escaped_egyptian_cobra_is_caught__near_the_reptile_house.html">News announced</a> that they are going to have a naming contest in conjunction with the zoo, with details to be announced soon. </p>

<p>As for her own asp-irations, Animal Planet <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528113657/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/april-fools-bronx-zoo-cobra-173924">announced today</a> that they are planning to air a two-hour documentary on the snake, and it is <em>absolutely positively undoubtedly not</em> an April Fool&apos;s Day joke. As for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528113657/http://www.theonion.com/articles/american-media-reports-news-other-than-zoos-escape,19866/">the media</a>, they&apos;ll have to go back to reporting on much <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528113657/http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2011/03/and_now_a_tortoise_has_gone_mi.html">slower news.</a></p>
