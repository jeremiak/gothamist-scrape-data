This weekend, the second annual <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502140021/http://gothamist.com/tags/cbgbfestival">CBGB Fest</a> took over musical venues around the city. One of the highlights was yesterday&apos;s massive show in Times Square&#x2014;thousands of people showed up to watch My Morning Jacket, Grizzly Bear, Divine Fits, The Wallflowers, Lisa Loeb, and a DJ set by James Murphy. Jim James of My Morning Jacket described playing in Times Square as &quot;incredibly surreal and beautiful, like playing Red Rocks if Red Rocks was made of computers and light. The crowd had great spirit! God Bless NYC!&quot; </p>

<p>Loeb <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502140021/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/my-morning-jacket-rock-times-square-at-cbgb-festival-20131013">was careful with her words</a> during her set: &quot;It&#x2019;s very strange to be playing a CBGB Festival in Times Square. <strong>When I lived in New York City, those two things were...different.</strong>&quot; But as Ed Droste from Grizzly Bear pointed out, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502140021/http://instagram.com/p/fYv_-2zXj7/">almost everyone had an amazing time.</a> Check out lots of amazing photos by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502140021/http://www.sachynmital.com/">Sachyn Mital</a> above, and some videos of many of the bands below.</p>
