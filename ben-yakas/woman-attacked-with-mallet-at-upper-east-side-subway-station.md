<p>A woman was sexually harassed and assaulted with a mallet at an Upper East Side subway station this week.</p>

<p>Police say the incident happened around 9:30 p.m. on Tuesday. The victim, Alexis Gonzalez, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025113344/http://nypost.com/2016/06/15/woman-attacked-with-mallet-after-buying-metrocard/">told the NY Post</a> she was buying a MetroCard when a man and his girlfriend got angry with her for unknown reasons. &quot;I heard the man saying sexual slurs about me and my friend. He said to the female he was standing with &#x2018;which one do you want?&apos;&quot; she told the Post.</p>

<p>The man&apos;s companion became enraged, threatening to &quot;fuck her up.&quot; Gonzalez says she and a friend tried to quickly walk away, but the woman followed her: &quot;She followed us down the stairs and now we&#x2019;re all on the platform, I was afraid she was going to try to push me into the train,&quot; Gonzalez told the Post. &quot;She spit at me again and this time it landed on my chest.&quot;</p>

<p>Then the woman allegedly took out a rubber mallet out of her purse and hit her over the head. &quot;She hit me with all her might, I ended up having a one-inch laceration and needed to get two staples to close it up,&quot; she said.</p>

<p>Gonzalez got on the train, but soon realized she was bleeding from the back of her head. &quot;I told my friend to touch the back of my head because it had started to swell and I had a huge knot,&quot; she explained. &quot;Her hand was covered in blood and I realized blood was dripping all down my back&#x2026; I started to panic because I realized I was really hurt.&quot;</p>

<p>She got off at the Lexington Avenue/51st Street stop and was transported to Metropolitan Hospital Center for treatment. Police describe the suspect as a woman in her mid-20s, about 5-feet-8-inches and 135 pounds.  </p>
