<p>New York state has come up with a new way to combat counterfeit licenses: black-and-white photos. Starting in July, New Yorkers who need new licenses <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150805103232/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/17/nyregion/new-york-state-will-fight-fake-licenses-with-new-tactics.html?ref=nyregion&amp;_r=1&amp;">will get a hard plastic card with monochromatic photos</a>&#x2014;that&apos;s right, your face will pop up multiple times on the new cards. The only way they could make them look any cooler is if they automatically photoshopped a cigarette dangling out of the driver&apos;s mouth, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150805103232/http://i.imgur.com/JATDa.jpg">switched the face with Camus.</a></p>

<p>In throwing out the bendable color cards, New York is following in the footsteps of Virgina, who adopted the new license style in 2009. Pam Goheen, a spokeswoman for the Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles, told the Times that the department had not seen a &#x201C;credible&#x201D; forgery of a Virginia license since, adding that those who tried had failed miserably. &#x201C;They&#x2019;re really awful,&#x201D; she noted. Forgers are deterred because the new licenses are laser engraved on rigid polycarbonate, a hard material that makes a &quot;sound like a compact disc when dropped.&quot;</p>

<p>The NY Times has a wonderful little feature on the evolution of the driver&apos;s license <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150805103232/http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/03/17/nyregion/17licenses-evolution.html?ref=nyregion">you can see here.</a> And if the lady in the above photo looks at all familiar to you, she should: Jason Feifer noticed as much, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150805103232/http://newyorklicenselady.tumblr.com/">started a Tumblr dedicated</a> to following the well-traveled life of &quot;mediocre stock photography.&quot;</p>
