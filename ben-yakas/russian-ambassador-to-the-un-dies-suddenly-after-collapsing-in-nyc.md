<p>Before becoming the Russian ambassador to the UN in May 2006, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170223082723/https://www.rt.com/news/377988-russian-ambassador-churkin-un-dies/">he served as</a> ambassador to Belgium, ambassador to Canada, and liaison ambassador to NATO and the Western European Union.
