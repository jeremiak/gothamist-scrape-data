<p>Business owners, residents and city officials haggled last year over bringing a new homeless shelter to Greenpoint, one which some <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131031162633/http://www.brooklynpaper.com/stories/33/36/wb_sheltermain_2010_09_03_bk.html">locals said</a> would have brought down the neighborhood. After much heated <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131031162633/http://thebrooklynink.com/2010/10/29/17576-nuances-lost-in-greenpoint-homeless-shelter-debate/">debate</a>, the proposal was rejected. But yesterday, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131031162633/http://www.brooklynpaper.com/stories/34/14/wb_mcguinness_2011_4_8_bk.html">Brooklyn Paper reports</a> that Community Board 1 was presented with another proposal for a 200-bed men&#x2019;s shelter to be placed on McGuinness Boulevard. </p>

<p>&quot;I wish we didn&#x2019;t need any shelters. I&#x2019;d would love to build more housing, but the city has a legal and moral responsibility it has embraced,&#x201D; said Bowery Residents&#x2019; Committee Executive Director Muzzy Rosenblatt. He argued in favor of converting a four-story industrial warehouse at Clay Street into a transitional housing center for homeless men suffering from substance abuse and mental illness. For the most part, the 150-plus residents who came to the meeting had the same questions and arguments against the shelter as they did last year. So did Greenpoint Counclman Steve Levin: &quot;I was hoping I wouldn&#x2019;t be back here this soon. My position has not changed &#x2014; 400 McGuinness Blvd. is not an appropriate place for a [homeless] center.&#x201D;</p>

<p>&#x201C;Putting your facility in the middle of all that will deteriorate that community in that area. We don&#x2019;t need a big shelter where you&#x2019;re going to bus people here from other places,&#x201D; said Christine Holowacz, a Newtown Creek Monitoring Committee member. Others pointed to existing three-quarter houses on Manahttan Avenue where drugs are traded that could attract recovering addicts seeking treatment: &quot;You&#x2019;re giving them a drug source. If you wanted to help them, put them somewhere not so close from a site where people are struggling too.&#x201D;</p>

<p>All over the city, locals have been fighting the expansion of homeless shelters and SRO&apos;s (single room occupancy) entering their neighborhoods, including the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131031162633/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/05/uws_residents_fight_against_inevita.php">Upper West Side.</a> This reflects a trend that goes all the way up to Albany&#x2014;the state moved to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131031162633/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/24/state_budgets_first_victim_is_a_pro.php">effectively shutdown</a> Advantage, a city program intended to reduce homelessness. But The Coalition for the Homeless <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131031162633/http://www.coalitionforthehomeless.org/blog/entry/important-information-for-current-advantage-tenants/">points out</a> that the city has been given a court order to continue to pay Advantage rents for current Advantage tenants for the month of April, though things are not looking good for the future.</p>
