Kelly Lopez-Roldan, 22, was arrested for the murder of 24-year-old Antoine Scott. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502174408/http://www.dnainfo.com/20111207/washington-heights-inwood/man-found-stabbed-death-washington-heights">He was found</a> with stab wounds to his chest shortly before 2:30 a.m. at 450 W. 164th Street. And <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502174408/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/preg_ma_kills_her_kids_dad_98MObljFl7ebII0rUR7OBO">sources tell the Post</a> that Lopez-Roldan plans to argue she committed the act in self-defense.<p></p>

<p>Scott allegedly let himself into Lopez-Roldan&apos;s apartment Wednesday morning with a spare key, and started punching her in the face. A police source told the Post that Lopez-Roldan managed to break away and grab a kitchen knife, which she plunged twice into Scott&#x2019;s chest. &#x201C;There was blood everywhere. It looked like he was running around for a while,&#x201D; the source told them. Roldan&#x2019;s 4-year-old son by another man was also sitting on the bed at the time.</p>

<p>Despite the fact the couple already had one child and Lopez-Roldan was four months pregnant with their twins, the two were living separately. Police said they had a volatile relationship, including past incidents involving police and claims of domestic violence. &#x201C;The couple was always fighting, about three times a week,&#x201D; Anthony Rodriguez, the building&#x2019;s custodian, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502174408/http://theuptowner.org/2011/12/07/east-harlem-man-stabbed-to-death-in-washington-heights/">told The Uptowner</a>. &#x201C;From what I hear, there have been noise complaints about the couple.&#x201D;</p>
