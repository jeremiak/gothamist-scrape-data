<p>It&apos;s that time of year again: tomorrow is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503231335/http://gothamist.com/tags/toplessday">National Go Topless Day</a>, a celebration of women&apos;s legal right to bare their breasts in public. The annual event event has become a venerable NYC tradition, albeit one that sometimes attracts <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503231335/http://gothamist.com/2012/08/26/photos_topless_day_in_bryant_park_w.php#photo-1">awkward, creepy onlookers.</a> So be prepared to see some breasts if you happen to be in midtown tomorrow, and don&apos;t act like a gawking tourist.</p>

<p>According <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503231335/http://gotopless.org/gotopless-day">to their BoobMap</a>, this year&apos;s gathering will start in Bryant Park just after noon on Sunday in Bryant Park&#x2014;participants will march to Times Square and back, with the event ending around 4:30 p.m. As ever, women have the choice of going fully topless, or wearing red tape &quot;to hide their (infamous!) nipples.&quot; Men are encouraged to wear a bikini top to show their support (which will be available there).</p>

<p>And never forget: it is completely legal <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503231335/http://gothamist.com/tags/topless">to go topless in NYC</a>. Just keep in mind that it&apos;s still not legal to go <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503231335/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/19/heres_nsfw_video_of_woman_taking_na.php">completely nude in public.</a></p>
