<p>In the wake of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120603172638/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/13/abandon_ship_donald_trump_pulls_out.php"> embarrassing implosion of</a> his planned GOP presidential debate in Des Moines&#x2014;better known as <em>Donald Trump&apos;s Very Classy GOP Presidential Primary Debate</em>&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120603172638/http://gothamist.com/tags/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> has made good on his threat to abandon the Republican party. Trump <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120603172638/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/45782222/ns/politics-decision_2012/t/donald-trump-breaks-gop-eyes-independent-bid/#.TvYGDCNWp4U">has officially changed his voter registration</a> in New York state from Republican to &quot;unaffiliated.&quot; Which means Trump is that much closer to joining the &quot;party&quot; of Michael Bloomberg, Ross Perot, Kinky Friedman, and John Tyler, leaving open the hilarious, tantalizing possibility of him fake-running for president as an independent.</p>

<p>And <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120603172638/http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2011/12/23/trump-dumps-gop/?hpt=hp_t2">according to Trump aide Michael Cohen</a>, this is all the Republicans own damn fault: Trump was &quot;disgusted with the way Republicans are handling&quot; the payroll tax cut extension, saying the actions of Republicans were partly to blame for his party change. Previously, Trump <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120603172638/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/09/trump_desperate_for_excuse_to_drop.php">used a similar excuse</a> to get out of the debate in a, um, <em>dignified</em> manner: he claimed that Republicans (except for Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum) would only agree to participate if he promised not to run for president as an independent&#x2014;it definitely wasn&apos;t because Trump conjured up an &quot;unwanted circus-like atmosphere.&quot; Definitely not.</p>

<p>At least this gives Trump more time for his two passions: endlessly promoting his reality TV show, <em>Celebrity Combover Apprentice</em>, and golf. To that end, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120603172638/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/donald-trump-signs-20-year-deal-run-york-city-golf-construction-bronx-ferry-point-park-article-1.996360?localLinksEnabled=false">Trump&#x2019;s company has signed</a> a 20-year license deal to operate the 18-hole Jack Nicklaus Signature course under construction at Ferry Point Park in the Bronx. Trump&apos;s organization, to their credit, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120603172638/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/15/central_park_carousel_was_disgustin.php">did a good job credibly running</a> the Central Park carousel. Of course, we can almost certainly guarantee Trump had nothing to do with that himself&#x2014;who has time to run a company when they can be luxuriating amongst <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120603172638/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/18/video_inside_donald_trumps_private.php">&quot;yards and yards of gold silk?&quot;</a></p>
