The New Pornographers, the effervescent Canadian pop gang led by red headed-songwriter AC Newman and red headed-chanteuse Neko Case, strolled into town last weekend for headlining shows at Terminal 5 and Bell House. They played a generous 24 song set before a packed crowd at the former Saturday night, barely pausing as they jumped from song to song, each stuffed with dementedly catchy hooks upon hooks. It was as sugary as a Snapple, but Newman is a tricky songwriter, always finding ways to subvert expectations and throw in the surrealist lyrics imaginable. The band played the bulk of new album <em>Together</em>, along with raging highlights from their whole discography, including &quot;The Electric Version,&quot; &quot;The Laws Have Changed,&quot; &quot;Myriad Harbour,&quot; and five songs from their masterpiece, <em>Twin Cinema</em>. The night ended with a rendition of &quot;Testament To Youth In Verse,&quot; with an extended audience singalong of &quot;no&apos;s&quot; led by the ever compelling Dan Bejar. If you enjoy pop music in any of its wild forms, you&apos;d be remiss in missing The New Pornographers next time they&apos;re in town: their jelly donuts are filled with substance.  <p></p>
