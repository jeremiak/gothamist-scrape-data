										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="030217baldwin1.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170627115315im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/030217baldwin1.jpg" width="640" height="415" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>Fresh off the announcement that he&apos;s writing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170627115315/http://gothamist.com/2017/03/01/alec_baldwin_trump_memoir.php">a fake presidential memoir</a> as Trump, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170627115315/http://gothamist.com/tags/alecbaldwin">Alec Baldwin</a> appeared on <em>Jimmy Kimmel Live!</em> last night to talk about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170627115315/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCx9k7qSilQ">his daughters</a>, his new movie <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170627115315/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KeO21ZcS1fk"><em>Baby Boss</em></a>, the possibility of him <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170627115315/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjhDaw5i45w">hosting the Oscars</a>, and of course his Trump impression. &quot;You can kinda suggest the voice, or suggest the way they look, but you have to try to think of who he is,&quot; Baldwin explained. &quot;To me, Trump is someone who is always looking for a stronger, better word, and he never finds it...He&apos;s a pamphlet thesaurus.&quot; </p>

<p>Unfortunately, the interview included one section in which Baldwin insulted fellow comedians doing Trump impressions, seemingly calling out Anthony Atamanuik (who impersonated Trump excellently throughout the campaign, especially on <em>@Midnight</em>) in particular, dismissing him as &quot;a guy who&apos;s on the Internet.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It&apos;s interesting that now that [Trump&apos;s] not going to the White House Correspondents&apos; Dinner, there are people who are lobbying to play Trump at the White House Correspondents&apos; Dinner,&quot; Baldwin told Kimmel. &quot;There&apos;s a couple guys on the internet who are like, &apos;No, please. I&apos;m the only man who should play Trump.&apos; There&apos;s a lot of Trump competition, I got sucked into this.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No one will top you on this,&quot; Kimmel replied. &quot;Nobody even knows who these guys are, don&apos;t worry about it.&quot;</p>

<p>I mean, technically-speaking, Atamanuik <em>did</em> lobby for the WHCD gig by pinning the tweet below to his account (he acknowledged it was &quot;uncouth&quot;) and also retweeting dozens of people calling on him to host. Personally speaking, I don&apos;t see why this should be a source of shame either way&#x2014;lobby for the gigs you want, be proud of your impression, it&apos;s a very good and nuanced one! </p>

<p>It&apos;s certainly not a good look for Baldwin and Kimmel to be belittling other, lesser known comics on national television...but it&apos;s also disingenuous for Atamanuik to say he wasn&apos;t lobbying via social media when he clearly was. This, of course, doesn&apos;t mean it&apos;s cool for Baldwin to be a dick when he holds most of the power in this argument.</p>

<p>Now, as for the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170627115315/http://decider.com/2016/10/04/alec-baldwin-donald-trump-impression-snl-anthony-atamanuik/">rumored accusations</a> that Baldwin cribbed part of his Trump impression from Atamanuik (which seems far-fetched to me, Baldwin&apos;s impression seems different enough from Atamanuik&apos;s that the plagiarism accusations don&apos;t hold water), fellow comedian James Adomian (who played Bernie Sanders to Atamanuik&apos;s Trump in various debate sketches) waded into the tiff on Twitter with some extra spicy accusations. </p>

<p>On the one hand, <em>again</em>, Baldwin shouldn&apos;t talk shit about hard-working comedians who have half his platform and resources. If you do that, especially on national television, you&apos;re going to get a heated response (a lot of comedians aren&apos;t known for their calm demeanors). On the other hand, Adomian&apos;s attacks seem over-the-top and baseless to me. But why are we fighting over this, there&apos;s enough room for everyone&apos;s Trump impressions! Now, as long as Baldwin can refrain from responding, we can all move on&#x2014;  </p>
