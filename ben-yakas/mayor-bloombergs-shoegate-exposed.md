One stuck out in particular: a piece in the Post that purported that the billionaire Mayor only has two pairs of work shoes. It was just cutesy enough, and sufficiently frugal, that we said, &apos;sure, that could be.&apos; But the Mayor pulled the rug out from under us during a speech at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412161456/http://www.zimbio.com/pictures/yKewMUhJwoo/QVC+Presents+FFANY+Shoes+Sale+Benefit+Breast/5R0kRluBoX9/Michael+Bloomberg">QVC&#x2019;s FFANY shoe sale event</a> on Wednesday, when he joked, &#x201C;A story emerged recently that shocked many in your industry, leaving them confused, perplexed, maybe even a little bit hurt. I&#x2019;m talking about the stunning revelation in the September 20th edition of the New York Post, <strong> that I, Michael R. Bloomberg, 108th Mayor of the City of New York, may not have purchased a new pair of work shoes in ten years&#x2026;if it&#x2019;s in the Post it must be true.&#x201D; </strong><p></p>

<p>Intrepid fashion reporters from <em>People </em>were determinded to get to the bottom of the story, so the next day at the Empire State Pride Agenda fall dinner, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412161456/http://stylenews.peoplestylewatch.com/2010/10/15/michael-bloomberg-new-york-mayor-shoes/">they asked</a> the Mayor if the Post story were true. He responded with a cheshire cat smile, &quot;You have to talk to my press secretary who made up the story...<strong>Yeah, I do probably have half a dozen pairs, but it is true. I probably only wear one black and one brown and that&#x2019;s about it</strong>. I&#x2019;d love to tell you I&#x2019;m a big fashionista.&quot;</p>
