<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161201104537/http://gothamist.com/tags/wesanderson">Wes Anderson</a> hasn&apos;t released a movie since the charmingly melancholy <em>The Grand Budapest Hotel</em> in 2014, but he&apos;s hard at work on his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161201104537/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5104604/?ref_=nm_flmg_dr_1">untitled ninth feature film</a>, a stop-motion movie about dogs due out in 2018 (and featuring the vocal talents of Bryan Cranston, Ed Norton, Bob Balaban, Jeff Goldblum, and of course, Bill Murray). </p>

<p>But sensing that the world is thoroughly lacking in quirky escapist entertainment in these dark times, Anderson teamed up with H&amp;M; for a Christmas-themed advertisement. The four-minute long short, titled &quot;Come Together,&quot; brings back fond memories of the highly underrated <em>The Darjeeling Limited</em>&#x2014;complete with Adrian Brody starring as Conductor Ralph.</p>

<p>This is far from the first time Anderson has dipped his finely-manicured toes in the commercial advertisement waters: he previously shot short films and ads for the likes of Prada, American Express, AT&amp;T;, Hyundai, Stella Artois and SoftBank. Just think of them as shots of bespoke espresso to tide you over until the real deal. You can check a few of those out below.</p>
