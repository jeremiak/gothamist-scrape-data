<p>While most people were smart enough not to go <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160902002609/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/27/cops_crack_down_on_kayaking_during.php">kayaking</a> last night during <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160902002609/http://gothamist.com/tags/hurricaneirene">Hurricane Irene</a>, some did head to Times Square to have a bit of fun. A ragtag group of participants in the NYC Police and Fireman World Games, whose games <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160902002609/http://2011wpfg.org/">were all cancelled</a> on Saturday and Sunday, gathered in Times Square last night just before the hurricane arrived to play a pick-up game of rugby! There was also some people playing hockey, and a makeshift slip &apos;n slide put down for Times Square revelers. Watch some videos of them frolicking in the rain below, as well as an Australian who is particularly bemused that he could still buy a copy of <em>When Harry Met Sally</em> at the Times Square DVD Depot:</p>
