title: Those 60 Orphaned Palm Trees Have New Homes Now

                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="PALMS230.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20131030025129im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/PALMS230.jpg" width="640" height="427" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>Earlier this month, we learned that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131030025129/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/11/do_you_need_30000_worth_of_palm_tre.php">the fate of 60 imported palm trees</a>&#x2014;formerly owned by late restauranteur Steven Greenberg&#x2014;were up in the air. Greenberg had brought them from Florida in 2006, and put them atop 230 Fifth&apos;s rooftop bar every summer (sending them back to Florida for the winter), but they grew too big for the rooftop. Well good news: the trees all have new homes! So all you nice people can stop writing us offering to &quot;take some of them or all of them off [our] hands.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131030025129/http://nypost.com/2013/10/26/orphaned-palms-take-root-thanks-to-post/">According to the Post</a>, various people came to pick up the trees, which are worth around $60K, for free on Friday. That included restaurateur Sean Sheridan, who took eight of them to put in his BayHouse Restaurant in Breezy Point, Queens (which was destroyed during Hurricane Sandy). </p>

<p>&#x201C;I was reading my favorite newspaper when I learned about the palm trees. They are a home run for us,&#x201D; Sheridan said, apparently referring to the Post, which what? Isn&apos;t that like admitting you think <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131030025129/http://gothamist.com/tags/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> is a very good businessman? Of course the Post handled the praise with Trump-ian humbleness, headlining their piece, &quot;Orphaned palms take root, thanks to Post.&quot;</p>
