<p>We&apos;re still mourning the end of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509173840/http://gothamist.com/tags/30rock"><em>30 Rock</em></a> (by re-watching the final two seasons, no less), but some fans got a chance for some in-person catharsis last night at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509173840/http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/02/28/30-rock-and-the-celebrity-cameo-that-got-away/">a panel with a group of writers from the show</a> at the Paley Center for Media. Tina Fey discussed the importance of wearing a bra onstage, dropped storylines (Pete and Jenna hooking up?), and revealed the one guest they could never snag: the one-and-only <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509173840/http://gothamist.com/2009/05/08/dr_z.php">Dr. Zizmor</a>. &#x201C;Zizmor turned us down,&#x201D; Fey said before giving her impression of Mrs. Zizmor&apos;s reaction to the suggestion. &#x201C;[She] was like, &#x2018;He&#x2019;s a doctor.&#x2019;&#x201D; </p>

<p>Fey <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509173840/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/tina-fey-oscar-hosting-not-425115">was also on Letterman</a> this week discussing her new movie <em>Admission</em>, her interest in hosting the Oscars (not interested), spending time with her kids (&quot;Santa Claus brought us a dog,&quot; she said, mentioning she is allergic to dogs, &quot;because Santa Claus hates me.&quot;), and life after <em>30 Rock</em>: <br>
&quot;The fact that we did seven years and finished it and nobody went to jail is a great source of pride,&quot; she said, adding that the post-<em>30 Rock</em> era is &quot;Google Alerts time,&quot; where she gets word of the exploits of Tracy Morgan (&quot;ohh&quot;) and Alec Baldwin (&quot;oooooohh...&quot;).</p>
