<p>Whether you&apos;re <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420034228/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/12/videos_dont_forget_to_work_out_when.php">at the gym</a> or on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420034228/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/18/videos_this_man_has_been_dancing_al.php">Staten Island</a>, nothing perks up a day like a little voluntary body movement. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420034228/http://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/new_york_city/entry/dancing_is_a_vertical_expression_of_a_horizontal_desire/">Dancing may be</a> a vertical expression of a horizontal desire, but it&apos;s also a delightful thing that can keep you warm in bitterly cold weather.</p>

<p>And it&apos;s especially sweet when you catch someone just doing their thing without a care for the people around them. We certainly would have loved if our childhood crossing guard had the moves of the person in the video above. Of course, such devil-may-care ebullience is perfectly acceptable on the street level; just don&apos;t try to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420034228/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/02/two_men_charged_with_reckless_endan.php">bring these moves</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420034228/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/08/couple_arrested_for_dancing_on_subw.php">down into the subway.</a></p>
