<p>Last month, a 31-year-old woman was accused of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150525003437/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/28/video_cops_say_this_woman_shoved_ma.php">fatally shoving a man</a> onto the subway tracks in Queens in one of two very high-profile <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150525003437/http://gothamist.com/tags/subwayshoving">subway shovings</a>. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150525003437/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/queens/pusher_he_died_fighting_RVSXTnf8tQx3BYOdp1OqBL?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Queens">The NY Post sat down for an exclusive jailhouse interview</a> with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150525003437/http://gothamist.com/tags/erikamenendez">Erika Menendez</a>, who has been accused of shoving 46-year-old Sunando Sen into the path of a 7 train, allegedly because she hates &quot;Hindus and Muslims&quot; because of 9/11. She expanded on that in the long, confusing interview; among other things, she said she self-medicates for her bipolar disorder with pot: &#x201C;If I smoked a blunt that day, I wouldn&#x2019;t have pushed him.&#x201D; </p>

<p>&#x201C;My mind was just racing that day. I was mad. I was just angry,&#x201D; she told them. &#x201C;I was homeless. I was hungry. I was fighting with my boyfriend. [Sen] came running up the stairs, and I just got up and pushed him.&#x201D; She added that he &#x201C;was trying to shake me off&#x201D; at the last second to no avail. As for the whole &quot;Hindus and Muslims&quot; part, she said she was most angry about the destruction of the World Trade Center: &#x201C;I&#x2019;m not mad about the people. I&#x2019;m mad because I liked the buildings,&#x201D; Menendez said. &#x201C;I just wanted to hurt Muslims and Hindus ever since [9/11].&#x201D;</p>

<p>The Post says she was &quot;emotionless&quot; for most of the interview, but when the subjects of Muslims or Hindus came up, &quot;her eyes lit up and she became very animated&quot;&#x2014;she told them, &#x201C;I&#x2019;ve been beating up Muslims and Hindus for a long time. I just want to hurt them. I would punch them.&quot; Menendez&apos;s former boyfriend <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150525003437/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/02/ex-boyfriend_says_subway_shoving_su.php">previously said that</a> she has long hated Muslims: &quot;She would say, &#x2018;I can&apos;t stand being around these people,&#x2019;&quot; John Goelz said. &quot;I kept telling her you can&apos;t blame every person you see.&quot;</p>

<p>She  has been charged with second-degree murder as a hate crime, and faces 25 years to life in prison if found guilty.</p>
