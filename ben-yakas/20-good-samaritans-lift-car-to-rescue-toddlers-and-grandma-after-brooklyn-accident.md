The 71-year-old driver, who was getting out of a parking space on Moore Street near Humboldt Street around 2:30 p.m. Friday, accidentally backed up onto the sidewalk, pinning 51-year-old Elizabeth Castillo underneath, and also hitting her 3-year-old grandson, Tyrese Owens, and 17-month-old Tashaya Spivey. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504134436/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Woman-Toddlers-Struck-Car-Elderly-Driver-Brooklyn-Humboldt-Moore-172872851.html">According to NBC</a>, about 20 good Samaritans all rushed to help them by lifting the car up: &#x201C;They were trying to run and he just ran them over. It was shocking. I didn&#x2019;t even think, I just ran right over and started to lift the car,&#x201D; Tyrone McCray <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504134436/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/woman-2-kids-hit-elderly-driver-brooklyn-article-1.1176218">told the News</a>. &#x201C;I just wanted to get the kids out. You could see the stroller sticking out.&#x201D;<p></p>

<p>&quot;The babies were under there, so about 20 of us got together, lifted up the car and dragged everybody out,&quot; said Edwin Padua, one of the other good Samaritans. &#x201C;There was so much blood on [Castillo&#x2019;s] face. She was mumbling like she didn&#x2019;t know what happened. The little girl was covered in blood, it was just so scary,&#x201D; said witness Wilfred Soto. The car narrowly missed Tashaya&apos;s mother, who was also walking with them: &#x201C;My daughter was asleep in her stroller. The car just rolled over them,&#x201D; said Anita Spivey. &#x201C;We were screaming, &#x2018;Stop! Stop! There are babies!&#x2019; &#x201D;</p>

<p>Castillo was taken to Bellevue Hospital and put in intensive care with a broken pelvis and abdominal bleeding. Tyrese suffered cuts on his face and a big knot on his head, while Tashaya had a broken right arm, an injury to her left eye and 35 stitches in her head. A 75-year-old passenger in the car <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504134436/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/crushing_backup_UQYkouo3boNDqe1db3qC3J">told the Post</a> she was also shaken up by the accident. The driver stayed at the scene, and has not been charged by police.</p>
