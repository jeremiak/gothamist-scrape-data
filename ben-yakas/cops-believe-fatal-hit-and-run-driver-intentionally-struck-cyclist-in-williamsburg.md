<p>A 35-year-old cyclist <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170927035201/http://gothamist.com/2016/07/03/cyclist_killed_by_hit-and-run_drive.php">was fatally struck</a> by a hit-and-run driver in Williamsburg early Saturday morning&#x2014;and investigators now believe that the driver intentionally struck the cyclist. </p>

<p>Law enforcement sources <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170927035201/http://pix11.com/2016/07/03/victim-idd-photos-released-of-driver-wanted-in-fatal-williamsburg-hit-and-run/">tell PIX11</a> that the driver of a black Chevy Camaro intentionally crashed into Matthew Von Ohen around 2:20 a.m. Saturday as he was headed east on Grand Street near Graham Avenue in the bike lane. </p>

<p>They report, &quot;Investigators believe the driver pulled alongside Von Ohen, slowed down and moved the car partially into the bike lane, where the victim was riding...The driver then hit Von Ohen&apos;s rear tire and as the victim fell off his bike, the driver slammed into him again, running over him and dragging him about 20 to 30 feet.&quot;</p>

<p>Von Ohlen had been headed home from a shift as a bartender at Apotheke in Manhattan when he was struck. The Post has graphic surveillance footage of the collision, which you can see below.</p>

<p><br>
Von Ohlen suffered severe trauma to his body and was taken to Bellevue Hospital, where he was pronounced dead.  &#x201C;He was killed like a dog in the street,&#x201D; neighbor Joanne Bascetta, who left flowers at the site where he was struck, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170927035201/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/cyclist-pedestrians-struck-brooklyn-bronx-incidents-article-1.2696872">told the Daily News</a>. &quot;He&#x2019;s someone&#x2019;s child. It&#x2019;s heartbreaking. I just came out for support. I feel so bad for the family.&quot;</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right"> <img alt="7416cyclist3.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170927035201im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/7416cyclist3.jpg" width="230" height="350"> <br> <i style=" width:230px; ;display:block"> NYPD</i></div> Von Ohlen started Bikestock, which operates self-serve bike repair vending machines in Brooklyn, Manhattan and Massachusetts, with partner Joseph Huba in 2013. According <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170927035201/http://www.bikestocknyc.com/about-bikestock/">to his bio</a> on the company&apos;s website, he &quot;lives and breathes cycling&quot; and &quot;sees biking as a way to stay fit and to decrease his environmental impact, and is a strong advocate of year-round ridership.&quot; <p></p>

<p>Cops are looking for the driver of the vehicle now. They describe the car as a black 2014-2015 Chevy Camaro with gold New York State license plates. You can see surveillance images of the car, which were taken immediately prior to the incident, to the right.<br>
 <br>
Anyone with information in regards to this incident is asked to call the NYPD&apos;s Crime Stoppers Hotline at 800-577-TIPS or for Spanish 1-888-57-PISTA (74782). The public can also submit their tips by logging onto the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170927035201/http://WWW.NYPDCRIMESTOPPERS.COM/">Crime Stoppers website</a> or texting their tips to 274637(CRIMES) then entering TIP577.</p>

<p>Police were out on Grand Street after the incident&#x2014;not stopping and ticketing drivers who were in the bike lane, but rather &quot;catching cyclists running red lights and handing out tickets,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170927035201/http://pix11.com/2016/07/03/victim-idd-photos-released-of-driver-wanted-in-fatal-williamsburg-hit-and-run/">according to PIX11.</a></p>

<p>&quot;When they got to the intersection of Grand and Graham on their way, police officers were there to stop them and hand out pamphlets on cyclist safety,&quot; Greg Fertel, who lives in the neighborhood, told us. &quot;I found this to be pretty enraging&#x2014;I don&apos;t think that this was an issue of cyclist safety.&quot; You can see the brochure below.</p>
