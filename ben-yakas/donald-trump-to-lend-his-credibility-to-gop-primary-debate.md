<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522035650/http://gothamist.com/tags/2012election">2012 GOP presidential primary race</a> has been marred by scandals and buffoonery galore over recent months, including <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522035650/http://gothamist.com/tags/hermancain">sexual harassment accusations</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522035650/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/10/rick_perry_tries_to_make_lemonade_o.php">human gaffe machines</a>, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522035650/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/17/newt_gingrich_owed_tiffanys_500k_se.php">Tiffany shopping sprees.</a> Republicans need someone who can bring <em>class</em> back to the party&#x2014;someone who understands when it&apos;s appropriate to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522035650/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/29/sketchy_draft_dodger_donald_trump_c.php">let the f-bombs fly</a> and who knows the proper way to eat pizza. They need someone <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522035650/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/27/donald_trump_has_enormous_balls_esp.php">who has &quot;enormous balls.&quot;</a> And to that end, professional used car salesman Donald Trump <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522035650/http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/12/02/trump-to-moderate-republican-debate/">will moderate a GOP primary debate.</a></p>

<p>Thanks to conservative magazine and website Newsmax, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522035650/http://gothamist.com/tags/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> will moderate the presidential debate in Des Moines on Dec. 27th. &#x201C;Our readers and the grass roots really love Trump,&#x201D; said Christopher Ruddy, chief executive of Newsmax Media. &#x201C;They may not agree with him on everything, but they don&#x2019;t see him as owned by the Washington establishment, the media establishment.&#x201D; Fair point&#x2014;Trump really is only in the Donald Trump industry. Sure, that may mean he doesn&apos;t have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522035650/http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/newsdesk/2011/04/donald-trump-mark-singer.html">anything resembling an inner life</a>, but who needs introspection when they have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522035650/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/18/video_inside_donald_trumps_private.php">&quot;yards and yards of gold silk?&quot;</a></p>

<p>As ludicrous as it may seem, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522035650/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/08/donald_trump_wants_you_to_vote_for.php">many prominent</a> Republicans really do take Trump&#x2014;who flirted with running for President Of Obama-Is-Not-An-American last spring&#x2014;very seriously. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522035650/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/02/video_berserk_jon_stewart_shreds_tr.php">Sarah Palin</a>, Michele Bachmann, Herman Cain, Mitt Romney and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522035650/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/15/donald_trump_and_rick_perry_bond_ov.php">Rick Perry</a> have all broken bread with Trump for highly-publicized photo ops. And current frontrunner Newt Gingrich is up next: he&apos;s due to meet Trump in NYC <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522035650/http://www.nydailynews.com/blogs/dailypolitics/2011/12/next-on-donald-trumps-list-newt-gingrich">this Monday.</a></p>

<p>We can&apos;t wait to see what Trump has to say about all this <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522035650/http://www.youtube.com/user/trump">on his YouTube rant page</a>. After all, who doesn&apos;t love it when the titan of combover industries  gives himself a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522035650/http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/post/donald-trump-wont-run-for-president-in-2012/2011/05/16/AF14G14G_blog.html">well-deserved handjob</a>?</p>
