The head of the Bronx DA&apos;s homicide bureau, Edward Talty, said that Coello had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110612094742/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2011/03/23/2011-03-23_excop_eddy_coello_accused_of_murdering_his_wife_incriminated_himself_in_crime_sa.html">incriminated himself</a>: &quot;<strong>We have video surveillance, forensic evidence and statements from the defendants own mouth that the night of March 11 and morning of March 12, after strangling her, he carried her dead body, put it in his car, and dumped her in Westchester County.&quot;</strong><p></p>

<p>Coello was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110612094742/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/22/days_after_discovery_of_estranged_w.php">arrested earlier this week</a>, and charged with second-degree murder by strangulation for allegedly killing wife Adovasio, who went <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110612094742/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/16/bronx_mother_disappears_estranged_e.php">missing</a> on March 11 from their Bronx apartment, after having a fight with Coello. Surveillance video <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110612094742/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/22/days_after_discovery_of_estranged_w.php">allegedly showed</a> a man dragging a duffel bag &quot;big enough to hold a body&quot; to a car. Adovasio&apos;s body was found five days later; Coello was questioned by police, but refused to give a DNA sample.</p>

<p>A police source <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110612094742/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2011/03/23/2011-03-23_excop_eddy_coello_accused_of_murdering_his_wife_incriminated_himself_in_crime_sa.html">told the News</a> that Coello had admitted to several people that he killed his wife: &quot;He said it just got out of hand. He was sorrowful with them that he did it.&quot; A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110612094742/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/bronx/prosecutors_believe_killing_nypd_bbofZXIYD8wl7ACcMpESiJ?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">Post police source</a> echoed this account, but added that Coello thought he could beat the rap: &quot;He called a female acquaintance and told her that he killed her, and that he had a good lawyer and thought he&#x2019;d get off.&quot; Coello&apos;s attorney denied these admissions ever happened, and said they would be pleading not guilty. </p>

<p>Adovasio&apos;s family who were in Bronx Criminal Court during the hearing called Coello a monster: &quot;He&apos;s an animal who took away an angel. Our whole family hopes he gets what he deserves,&quot; said Carla Serrero, a cousin of the Bronx mother of four. Even passersby <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110612094742/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/bronx/killer_ex_cop_lied_da_mhS66Sq1CmET944uEbpt8O?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">seemed unnerved</a> by Coello&apos;s stoic attitude: &quot;He was very, very cold. He seemed like he didn&apos;t care...I&apos;ll never forget that stare. He had a cold, cold stare, like he&apos;s pure evil. I can&apos;t believe I came face to face with that guy,&quot; said John Correa, who was waiting for a nephew arrested for fighting when cops marched Coello through a hallway.</p>
