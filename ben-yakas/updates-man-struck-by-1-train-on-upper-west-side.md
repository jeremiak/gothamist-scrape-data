<p>An unidentified <strike>woman</strike> man was struck by a 1 train on the Upper West Side this morning, making it the fourth such subway-related incident this week. According to FDNY, today&apos;s incident happened around 10:20 a.m. at the 86th Street station in Manhattan. Witness Orlando Olier was on the train at the time, and tells us, &quot;When coming into the 86th Street station, the 1 train stopped prematurely. I was in the 4th car and the person seemed to be trapped under the tracks between my car and the one behind it. There were numerous bloodcurdling screams. The transit police evacuated us as the firemen were pouring in.&quot;</p>

<p>FDNY confirmed the victim was taken to Roosevelt Hospital; they said <strike>her</strike> his condition is currently unknown. MTA adds there are no 1 trains between 42nd and 137th, no 3 trains between 42nd and 148th, and southbound 2 trains are running on the 5 line from 149 St-Grand Concourse to Nevins Street.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, a man <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604104453/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/20/breaking_person_reportedly_struck_a.php">was fatally struck</a> by an F train at the Roosevelt Avenue / 74th Street station in Jackson Heights; another man <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604104453/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/20/breaking_another_person_struck_by_a.php">was injured</a> after falling onto the tracks at Columbus Circle that day. And on Thursday, another person <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604104453/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/21/person_fatally_struck_by_train_in_q.php">was fatally struck</a> by an F train in Queens.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: Another witness, Dan Caster, told us he was there around the time the incident happened. He said the 1 train stopped about half way into the station, and then he saw a woman explaining to an MTA worker that she saw something under the train. &quot;I backed away from the cart to give them space,&quot; he said. &quot;The MTA worker looked below the stopped train for a person. He didn&apos;t see anything.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Where I moved away, I heard moans and screams,&quot; Caster told us. &quot;I told the MTA worker I heard something. It was so horrific and people were gathering, I left after that.&quot; He added that he thought it sounded like &quot;a middle aged womans cries.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: Despite initial reports from FDNY, MTA and witnesses all saying the victim was a woman, the MTA now says the victim was actually an Asian male. The MTA says man was found on the roadbed, but it is still unclear whether this was a suicide attempt, an accident or something else. </p>

<p>FDNY added that the man was taken to the hospital in critical condition, but we haven&apos;t been able to ascertain his current condition. Almost four hours after the incident, police said they have no information about the victim, or the incident in general.</p>

<p>We spoke to two other witnesses who were either at or on their way to the station when this happened: Rebecca Perry told us she was hurring to catch the train when she saw the chaos on the platform.</p>

<blockquote>I made it to the platform, and right away, I heard tons of screaming (I think mostly from people who witnessed it, maybe from her too). I turned around, and literally swarms of policemen/firemen were right behind me, running over to the tracks. The people who had been on the platform already then started running towards the stairs as we were being told to leave by the police ... It was ridiculously chaotic. Since I had just gotten there, I didn&#x2019;t know what was going on. I saw one girl crying, and asked her what was going on. &quot;Someone was JUST hit by a train.&quot; Apparently I was arriving only a minute or two after it happened, and someone had called 911 right away. 

<p>When we got above ground, there were tons of people, several police cars and fire trucks everywhere. I hung around for a couple minutes, then saw the M86 cross town bus was waiting there to bring people to the B/C train instead. Cops were guarding the subway entrances so no one could go down. </p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>And an anonymous tipster sent in a few photos (see one above and one below) plus this account:</p>

<blockquote>All I can add is that the first car of the train stopped mid-platform (where I was standing) and I remember thinking it odd that it was going so slowly. When the motorman came out of the first car, I heard him say into his radio (very quietly) that he had hit something. The conductor then announced that there was &quot;someone on the roadway.&quot; The motorman jumped onto the tracks with a flashlight and disappeared onto the express tracks. It took them a very long time to open the doors on the cars &#x2014; I guess as not to flood the platform while the rescuers were trying to get in. 

<p>When the police and fire started to arrive, the radios said that the jumper was North of the platform, and there were police calls to 96th Street as well as 86th Street. The police and fire were clustered around the area near the 87th Street entrance. There was a sizable group of passengers crying, and one wailing uncontrollably, when we were all escorted out of the station.</p></blockquote><p></p>
