Yesterday, the Brooklyn Bridge <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130724063451/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/04/brooklyn_bridge_at_standstill_due_t.php">was closed for over an hour</a> due to an intense standoff between police and a man who was threatening to jump. The 52-year-old man, whose name has not been released, had climbed to the top of the Manhattan Tower of the bridge just before 3 p.m. Saturday. Officers donned harnesses and walked the support cables to the top of the bridge where they were eventually able to talk the man down.</p>

<p>The man steps off the ledge at around the 7:30 mark of this footage. </p>

<p>Detectives Keith Connelly and Gregory Welch were the first officers to arrive at the scene; they were joined by Sergeant John Flynn. After speaking for over an hour, the three of them were able to convince the man he would get the help he needed, and he was removed to Bellevue Hospital for evaluation. </p>

<p>&#x201C;He was clearly in distress, stating he wanted to jump off the top of the bridge,&#x201D; said Sgt. Flynn, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130724063451/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/on_edge_jumper_drama_atop_brooklyn_Vxed8brp4bHbUTPvEB8nGN?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Brooklyn">who explained that</a> the man &#x201C;wanted to talk to us about the problems that he was having.&#x201D; Sgt. Wells added: &#x201C;He was right on the edge. He was ready to go.&#x201D; Many drivers, who were stuck on the bridge during the standoff, got out to watch the scene unfold; when it ended a little after 4 p.m., they cheered for the officers.</p>
