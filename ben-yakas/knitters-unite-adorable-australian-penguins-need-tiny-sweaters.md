<p>By now, we all know that time is a flat circle, that everything we&apos;ve ever done or will do we&apos;re gonna do <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150523163730/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xL3n0L5b8Q">over and over and over again</a>. Three years ago, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150523163730/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/19/psa_please_knit_these_penguins_some.php">a call was sent out</a> to knitters around the world after a New Zealand oil spill had left cute little penguins in need of warmth and protection. And this week, that call for penguin sweaters is going out once more.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150523163730/http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/06/wanted-knitters-to-create-jumpers-for-little-penguins?CMP=twt_fd">According to the Guardian</a>, Phillip Island&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150523163730/http://penguinfoundation.org.au/">Penguin Foundation</a> conservation group is asking for people to donate small knitted jumpers for penguins. Because penguins are losing their WATERPROOFNESS: &quot;If somebody puts oil into the sea&#x2026;a little penguin swimming along pops up to the surface and finds out he&#x2019;s come up in a circle of yukky stuff,&#x201D; said Lyn Blom of the Penguin Foundation. &quot;The first thing he wants to do is get to shore because he loses all of his waterproofness.&quot;</p>

<p>The Foundation has a nifty updated 2014 guide [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150523163730/http://penguinfoundation.org.au/assets/Wildlife-rehabilitation/penguin-jumper-pattern-2014.pdf">PDF</a>] to help you with the sizes (spoiler alert: they&apos;re TINY). Keep in mind that there is some dispute in the penguin community over the effectiveness of the sweaters&#x2014;while many sweaters have been collected and used to warm up penguins and keep them from pecking at oil on their bodies, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150523163730/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/21/the_penguins_dont_need_your_sweater.php">some experts have said</a> that it is &quot;only going to stress it out even more than they already are.&quot;</p>

<p>Indeed, when the call for penguin sweaters went out in 2011, most of those sweaters <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150523163730/http://www.giantflightlessbirds.com/2011/10/the-great-penguin-sweater-fiasco/">never actually went on a live penguin.</a> We&apos;ve contacted Penguin Foundation to get more information about how many sweaters they need and how they&apos;ll be used (some leftover sweaters have previously gone on stuffed penguins and been used to raise money for charities; the Penguin Foundation also distributes the jumpers to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150523163730/http://www.abc.net.au/local/audio/2014/03/05/3957423.htm">other wildlife rescue groups where needed</a>). </p>

<p>If you would rather stay out of the sweater area, or aren&apos;t too good with needles and threads, you can always <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150523163730/https://penguinfoundation.org.au/donation/">donate by adopting-a-penguin.</a> Enjoy the most sweater-conscious song in history while you decide.</p>
