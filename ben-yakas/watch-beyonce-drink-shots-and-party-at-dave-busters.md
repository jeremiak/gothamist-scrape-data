<p>Based on the rapturous reception her new <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144431/http://gothamist.com/2013/12/13/beyday_beyonce_surprises_fans_with.php">surprise self-titled album</a> received, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144431/http://gothamist.com/tags/beyonce">Beyonce</a> is at the top of her game. So it makes perfect sense that she would celebrate said album by renting out Dave &amp; Buster&apos;s in Times Square and throwing a wild album release party featuring Drake, skee-ball and shots galore. </p>

<p>Seriously: after completing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144431/http://gothamist.com/2013/12/20/beyonce_1.php">her show at Barclays Center</a> last night, Beyonce and her crew jumped on their surfboards and headed to Dave &amp; Buster&apos;s for the private album release party. And Beyonce took about 3,000 photos.</p>

<p>Oh, and Drake was there spinning records and giving praise unto the Queen:</p>

<p>If Beyonce was lucky, maybe she got to join the likes of Kim Kardashian, the cast of <em>Harry Potter</em>, and Paul Rudd, and climbed into the giant Crane Game box. Nirvana really is a glass box filled with plush toys.</p>
