Jerry Laraque claims he was fired from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160415145922/http://www.longislandcitycondos.com/building/the-foundry-condominium/">The Foundry</a> in Long Island City after he complained for board members and the property manager that super John Olivieri continually harassed him. That included calling Laraque a &quot;n-----,&quot; &quot;monkey,&quot; a &quot;black piece of s---,&quot; and mocking his Haitian accent and his &quot;big Chicago lips.&#x201D; And it ALSO included Olivieri allegedly soliciting him for oral sex and twice trying to stick his tongue in Laraque&apos;s mouth.</p>

<p>Laraque, who started working at the building as a security guard in 2008 and was promoted to doorman after a few months, said the harassment allegedly started when Olivieri was a painting contractor for the building, and got worse when he was promoted to super. &quot;He humiliated me many times,&quot; Laraque told the News, adding that he complained to many people around the building to no avail. &quot;They sent me to the management, back-and-forth, and nothing was done. They don&apos;t take it seriously.&quot;</p>

<p>Property manager Robert Swiderski says Laraque was fired for poor performance and getting into an argument with another building worker. But Laraque says Swiderski ignored his frequent complaints, saying &quot;I&apos;m not listening to you,&quot; and &quot;This is bull----.&quot; Perhaps Swiderski thought this was all <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160415145922/http://gothamist.com/2009/06/21/ues_doorman_gives_man_a_ski_trip_to.php">just another case of</a> a doorman&apos;s &quot;seriously misguided effort to be social.&quot;</p>
