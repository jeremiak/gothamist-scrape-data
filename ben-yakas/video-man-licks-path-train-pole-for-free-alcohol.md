<p>It&apos;s an age-old dilemma: is a moment in the white hot spotlight of viral fame worth the risk of infection from licking stuff on mass transit? The answer is a resounding yup for this adventurous tourist, who took a page <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170717055143/https://media.giphy.com/media/xT5LMLX0UZn4Eqjq8w/giphy.gif">out of the Bart Simpson playbook</a> and licked a pole on a dare while on vacation in New Jersey and NYC. The man describes himself on YouTube as &quot;drunken alter ego Stu in all his glory. Dares.. bets... drunken antics and general ridiculousness.&quot; (His only other video is of him <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170717055143/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtCAOXO7gV8">having an &quot;Irish breakfast&quot;</a>, so clearly Stu&apos;s career is just getting started, can&apos;t wait to see what he does!) </p>

<p>Hopefully one day someone can inform Stu that he did not actually lick a NYC subway pole, but rather a PATH train to Hoboken, making his claim to fame completely illegitimate. </p>

<p>Despite the fact that they often come in contact with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170717055143/http://gothamist.com/2014/10/10/used_condom_subway.php">used condoms</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170717055143/http://gothamist.com/2015/02/06/subway_bacteria_revealed.php">human excrement</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170717055143/http://gothamist.com/2014/06/01/subway_etiquette_keep_your_feet_but.php">so many butts</a>, licking mass transit and subway poles has become <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170717055143/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/02/video_teen_licks_entire_subway_rail.php">something of a past time</a> for impressionable tourists, drunk guys and dirtbag teenagers. At least Stu got some free drinks for potentially exposing himself to Hepatitis and rotavirus. WORTH IT.<br>
