<p>Last month, a 21-year-old actress <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425145937/http://gothamist.com/2012/09/23/high_risk_sex_offender_charged_with.php">was allegedly beaten and raped</a> by a homeless man in Hudson River Park. Police arrested and charged 25-year-old <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425145937/http://gothamist.com/tags/jonathanstewart">Jonathan Stewart</a>, a registered Level III sex offender, with rape for the September 22nd attack. It turns out <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425145937/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/suspect-loko-remember-raped-woman-article-1.1190719?localLinksEnabled=false">that Stewart told cops</a> he had chugged five Four Lokos while partying that night, and didn&apos;t remember anything that happened: &quot;Did I do something wrong, because I don&apos;t remember because I had Four Lokos,&quot; Stewart told arresting officers. &quot;I don&apos;t know what&apos;s going on. I just woke up.&quot;</p>

<p>Immediately after he was arrested, Stewart <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425145937/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/accused_park_attacker_asked_police_9GgWjAIg6rrXzMgdVGAsdN?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20Manhattan">also told cops that</a> he had been partying with his cousin in the Baruch Houses on the lower East Side. &quot;I drank five Four Lokos, Grey Goose Vodka, smoked marijuana and K2,&quot; Stewart said. He added that he was suicidal &quot;because I&apos;ve been through so much...I was going toward the Brooklyn Bridge and was going to jump off the bridge.&quot; Stewart <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425145937/http://gothamist.com/2012/09/24/hudson_river_park_rape_suspect_trie.php">also reportedly tried to hang himself</a> while in lockup after his arrest.</p>

<p>But a week after he was arrested, Stewart had a slightly different story, telling his parole officer, &quot;All I did was touch her breasts and I made her take off her clothes.&quot; He also said: &quot;I think they&apos;re going to make it a violation because the doctor said the DNA came back negative. I have a defense lawyer and I was arraigned at Bellevue.&quot;</p>

<p>Stewart, who is schizophrenic, was indicted in Manhattan Supreme Court yesterday, where he pleaded not guilty to predatory sexual assault, rape, sodomy and sex abuse. Prosecutors called him a &quot;violent predicate felon,&quot; noting he had served five years in prison for two previous sex assaults. Stewart faces 25-years-to-life in prison if he is convicted of the charges.</p>
