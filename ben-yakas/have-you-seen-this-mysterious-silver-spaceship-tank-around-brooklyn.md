<p>Catching a sight of Ecto-1 parked <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170526151439/http://gothamist.com/2015/09/17/uws_jews_vs_ghostbusters.php">outside your apartment</a> is neat but unexceptional; being awoken by a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170526151439/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/15/car_burns.php">cacophonous car fire</a> is irritating but basic; seeing a subway car <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170526151439/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/30/now_ive_seen_everything.php">floating through the streets</a> is certainly an eyebrow-raiser, but even MTA vehicles have gotta get from A to B somehow. But a spaceship/tank hybrid with Midwest plates in the heart of yupster Brooklyn? It should be illegal to be cynical about such a thing (even if it&apos;s probably illegal to drive it).</p>

<p>&quot;It was parked in front of 10 Ft Single at N 6th and Meeker in Williamsburg,&quot; Reddit user Peanutpickle10, who spotted the vehicle last Saturday, told us. &quot;There were two men, likely father [and] son pair, with no shoes, showing the car off to residents at 277 N 6th Street. It was definitely driving and something that&apos;s been spotted around the area recently.&quot;</p>

<p>Indeed, it&apos;s caught the eye of people all around the borough, parked <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170526151439/http://i.imgur.com/hBFFC5b.jpg">in Bushwick</a>, roaming <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170526151439/https://www.reddit.com/r/nyc/comments/5f9oa7/has_anyone_ever_seen_this_car_in_nyc_before/">around Fort Greene</a>, and cruising down the blocks in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170526151439/https://www.reddit.com/r/nyc/comments/5gbgd3/look_what_car_decided_to_park_in_front_of_my/darrk3o/">Prospect Heights</a>. Another person who spotted it noted, &quot;I caught sight of the driver and he was a total hipster.&quot; The license plate of the vehicle seems to indicate it&apos;s registered in Montana, so maybe that&apos;s the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170526151439/http://www.omaha.com/columnists/kelly/kelly-a-great-place-to-get-going-more-millennials-are/article_48689ea6-946a-502f-92d3-9200373c85bb.html">new Omaha.</a></p>

<p>Thanks <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170526151439/https://www.reddit.com/r/nyc/comments/5f9oa7/has_anyone_ever_seen_this_car_in_nyc_before/">to some well-versed Redditors</a> and our own imaginations, we have a few guesses as to what the vehicle actually is:</p>

<p>-A Burning Man structure (as one Burner friend put it to me, &quot;Not one I&apos;m sure I&apos;ve seen, but it does look like a BM art car&quot;)<br>
