Now, if we can only figure out a way <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110510233304/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/29/science_if_you_binge_on_fatty_food.php">to snort</a> the sandwich into our bodies, we&apos;d truly be set.<p></p>

<p>The sandwich is filled with fries rolled up in a freshly made pita, with a slathering of ketchup and a very garlicky mayo, as well as a token handful of lettuce for good measure. The Voice says that it is &quot;astonishingly good, a kingdom of squish and crunch in its toasted pita, and the price is so cheap, it will cost you less to eat one than to make a meal at home.&quot; </p>

<p>We almost feel insulted that Man&apos;ouChe didn&apos;t go even farther with the concept&#x2014;throwing the lettuce in, for example, feels almost insulting! And the pita is just too healthy; we&apos;d prefer some sort of bacon-infused bun, with a (un)healthy amount of cheese to hold everything together. Of course, we&apos;ll probably need our <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110510233304/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/31/baconair_an_anorexic_kosher_vegetar.php">bacon inhalers</a> at hand to handle all the flavor.</p>
