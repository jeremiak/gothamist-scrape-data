Did your <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412163652/http://gothamist.com/2010/08/26/pot_firefighter_found_guilty.php">firefighter</a> dealer fall through? Did your backup place <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412163652/http://gothamist.com/2010/10/21/where_theres_smoke_theres_a_basemen.php">on Rivington</a> mysteriously shut down? Well we have just the delivery guy for you: lawyer Seth Ginsberg. <p></p>

<p>The defense attorney, who once defended John Gotti Jr,  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412163652/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/the_mob/2010/10/23/2010-10-23_jail_weeds_out_mafia_lawyer.html">was caught</a> with a bag of weed while trying to enter the Metropolitan Correctional Center; he was visiting reputed Gambino soldier and alleged pimp <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412163652/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/21/gambino_family_indicted_on_charges.php">Thomas Orefice</a>. Ginsberg hilariously blurted out, &quot;<strong>How did that get there</strong>,&quot; denied it was his, and like any good mule, swore to federal officers it was his brother&apos;s. Ginsberg&apos;s younger brother submitted a sworn affidavit acknowledging the marijuana bag was his, which was submitted to investigators. Nevertheless, Ginsberg has been banned from the federal lockup, which just means he&apos;ll have more time to meet you at the northwest corner of Washington Square Park, if you give him a couple hours notice.</p>
