<p>Billy Crystal has been in something of a comedy purgatory for some time now, cursed to host the occasional awards ceremony and appear in projects only when summoned <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170925165739/http://variety.com/2015/tv/news/the-comedians-cancelled-billy-crystal-fx-1201547120/">by Josh Gad.</a> But when given the opportunity to reunite with his <em>City Slickers</em> co-star Daniel Stern and hop into a surprisingly cogent <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170925165739/http://gothamist.com/tags/westworld"><em>Westworld</em></a> parody featuring three actual cast members&#x2014;Luke Hemsworth (Stubbs), Ptolemy Slocum (Sylvester) and Angela Sarafyan (Clementine)&#x2014;he wisely jumped at the opportunity, Gad or no Gad (in this case, no Gad). </p>

<p>Watch below as Crystal and Stern bring back Mitch and Phil from the 1991 movie, only this time as hosts at the park&#x2014;hosts who proceed to shoot each other, drink milk, bicker like an old married couple, and make smart alec-y remarks a lot like...any Billy Crystal character ever.</p>
