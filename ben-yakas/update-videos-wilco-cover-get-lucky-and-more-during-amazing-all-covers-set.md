                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="62213wilco.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20140109025820im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/62213wilco.jpg" width="640" height="461"> <br> <i> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140109025820/http://instagram.com/p/a2EPNomGpb/">Brooklyn Vegan Instagram</a></i></div> <p></p>

<p>Yesterday marked the first day of the 2013 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140109025820/http://solidsoundfestival.com/">Solid Sound Festival</a>, founded and curated by the world&apos;s most beloved dad rockers, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140109025820/http://gothamist.com/tags/wilco">Wilco</a>. The band marked the occasion by offering fans the chance to request covers for them to play as part of a special all-request set Friday night. And boy did they deliver, crafting an epic 27-song live mix tape that would put most NYC dive bars to shame.</p>

<p>There were songs Wilco has sprinkled into setlists into the past (like The Band&apos;s &quot;The Weight&quot; and Blue Oyster Cult&apos;s &quot;Don&apos;t Fear The Reaper&quot;), there were covers they were born to play (after all, &quot;Handshake Drugs&quot; is nothing if not a spawn of Television&apos;s &quot;Marquee Moon&quot;), and there were the left-of-field surprises that delighted the crowd&#x2014;like Daft Punk&apos;s &quot;Get Lucky&quot;, which they killed, and which you can hear above. They even played two version of The Beatles&apos; &quot;And Your Bird Can Sing&quot;!</p>

<p>The night opened with Thin Lizzy&apos;s two-guitar stomper &quot;The Boys Are Back In Town&quot; and immediately swivelled into Pavement&apos;s classic &quot;Cut Your Hair.&quot; The Kinks&apos; beautiful &quot;Waterloo Sunset&quot; butted heads with ABBA&apos;s joyous &quot;Waterloo.&quot; They had Yo La Tengo join in on &quot;Tom Courtenay&quot; and set closing &quot;Road Runner,&quot; and they had Tommy Stinson come aboard for a perfect version of The Replacements&apos; classic &quot;Color Me Obsessed,&quot; which you can watch below. </p>

<p>Wilco play another set tonight (which will likely be a more classic, normal Wilco show)&#x2014;but keep an eye out on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140109025820/http://www.nyctaper.com/">NYCTaper</a> over the next week, since he reportedly got a recording of the all-covers show.</p>

<p>More and more of the videos keep getting put online, and it proves once again that Jeff Tweedy cannot sing out of tune. Below, watch them kill Kinks classic &quot;Waterloo Sunset,&quot; Velvet Underground&apos;s &quot;Who Loves The Sun,&quot; Grateful Dead&apos;s &quot;Ripple,&quot; Bob Dylan&apos;s &quot;Simple Twist Of Fate,&quot; a hushed take of Elvis Costello/Nick Lowe&apos;s &quot;(What&apos;s So Funny &apos;Bout) Peace, Love and Understanding&quot;, and The Modern Lovers&apos; &quot;Road Runner.&quot;</p>
