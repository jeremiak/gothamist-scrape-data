<p>A Brooklyn man was fatally struck by a hit-and-run driver in Gerritsen Beach last night. According to police, 32-year-old Bryan Loughran had left the Gather Inn Again bar around 2:45 a.m. Saturday and was walking to his car when he was struck by a driver in a Chrysler. &quot;He was the best,&quot; a Gather Inn bartender named Allyson <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140630205138/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/man-killed-hit-and-run-driver-brooklyn-article-1.1847474">told the News</a>. &quot;He walked with a limp. That&#x2019;s why it took him so long to get across the street.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I was with him for three hours at the bar,&quot; she added. &quot;He only had one drink...I said goodbye to him as he left, and that was it.&quot; Loughran was transported to Beth Israel Hospital, where he was pronounced dead. Police found the Chrysler abandoned a half-mile away. Driver Michael Casale, 50, was later arrested at his home, and charged with leaving an accident resulting in death and aggravated unlicensed operation of a vehicle.</p>
