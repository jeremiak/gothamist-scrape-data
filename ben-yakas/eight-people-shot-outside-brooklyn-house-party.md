<p>Eight people were shot during a Brooklyn house party last night. According to police, the incident happened just before 1 a.m. at a house on East 52nd Street in East Flatbush. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140907114507/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local/new_york&amp;id=9157003">ABC reports</a> that the shooting was instigated after someone was denied entry to the party, and started wildly shooting into a crowd of around 60 people outside the house. &quot;A person in the middle of the crowd just started shooting all around, into the crowd,&quot; a witness <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140907114507/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/shot-barrage-bullets-brooklyn-party-cops-article-1.1386311">told the News</a>. &quot;People were screaming. I started running the other way.&quot;</p>

<p>Another resident <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140907114507/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2013/06/30/shooting-at-east-flatbush-house-party-leaves-8-people-hospitalized/">said to 1010 WINS</a>, &quot;Well, I heard gunshots last night and I hit the floor because it sounded like it was coming into the room. I said somebody must&#x2019;ve gotten shot because it was definitely gunshots.&quot;</p>

<p>Altogether, four men and four women were struck; the victims were transported to Brookdale Hospital and Kings County Hospital. One woman initially was in critical condition, but has since been upgraded to stable after emergency surgery. No arrests have been made yet.</p>
