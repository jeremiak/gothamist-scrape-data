<p>While snow plows were getting stuck in ditches, and Mayor Bloomberg was off getting incredulous or whatever, some people were forced to dig themselves out of the pillowy, unplowed streets unaided. And while there have been some true <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428182359/http://gothamist.com/2010/12/29/tragic_tales_of_too-late_emergency.php">tragedies</a> during the Boxing Day Blizzard, there have also been some nice, man-helping-fellow-man anecdotes. Daddy-O owner Phil Casaceli saw such an incident unfold on Bedford Street in the West Village Monday night, involving none other than Tony Soprano himself: </p>

<p>Casaceli <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428182359/http://www.nypost.com/p/pagesix/gandolfini_blizzard_hero_8c3mW3Wf3SuvIwFQpkhCHM">told the Post</a>: &quot;Bedford Street didn&apos;t get plowed until late Monday night, and the whole street was a 3-foot drift of snow. Somebody driving down the street got stuck in their car around 8 p.m. -- and the next minute, James Gandolfini appeared from another car behind and offered to help out.&quot; Gandolfini, who lives in the neighborhood, spent more than 45 minutes trying to get the car unstuck, with the help of other random strangers who gathered to see the actor in action. &quot;<strong>Some offered to help, and others just watched because you don&apos;t often see Tony Soprano digging people out of the snow. It was a real New York moment. </strong>Somebody had the luck of the draw, and it was James Gandolfini who came to their rescue,&quot; Casaceli said. </p>

<p>Afterwards, Gandolfini changed a $100 bill for $20&apos;s to give out to the other Good Samaritans. In light of this incident, we&apos;re putting Gandolfini on our Good Celebrimaritans list, along with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428182359/http://gothamist.com/2009/11/05/fresh_from_world_series_win_joe_gir.php">Joe Girardi</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428182359/http://gawker.com/396153/how-werner-saved-joaquin-phoenix-in-his-own-words">Werner Herzog</a>, and...well, it&apos;s a work-in-progress so far. At least this settles the debate about whether or not <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428182359/http://gothamist.com/2007/06/10/sopranos_series.php">he died.</a></p>
