<p>As if starring <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160704142623/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/26/watch_david_bowies_short_musical_fi.php">in David Bowie music videos</a> wasn&apos;t already the coolest, Tilda Swinton has currently taken up residency sleeping at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160704142623/http://gothamist.com/tags/moma">MoMA</a>. It&apos;s part of an unannounced, surprise performance piece called &quot;The Maybe&quot; that will be taking place on random days all <strike>month</strike> year (<em>see updated details below</em>&#x2014;<b>update, Monday, 3/25: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160704142623/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/25/tilda_swinton_is_sleeping_at_moma_a.php#photo-1">she&apos;s back at the MoMA</a></b>). A MoMA source told us, &quot;Museum staff doesn&apos;t know she&apos;s coming until the day of, but she&apos;s here today. She&apos;ll be there the whole day. All that&apos;s in the box is cushions and a water jug.&quot;</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="32313tilda2.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160704142623im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/32313tilda2.jpg" width="640" height="480"> <br> <i> Gothamist</i></div> <p></p>

<p>&quot;Tilda Swinton will be doing unannounced, random performance art pieces sleeping in a glass box in the museum,&quot; the source added. &quot;Today is the first performance. Each performance lasts the whole day the museum is open.&quot; Swinton and her box are located near the ticket collectors today, but the box may be in different locations at other performances.</p>

<p>&quot;The Maybe&quot; was first performed in London in 1995 at the Serpentine Gallery; Swinton conceived the performance piece, and asked artist Cornelia Parker to collaborate on the installation. Swinton later re-performed the piece in the Museo Barracco in Rome. Here&apos;s  what the museum has to say about the piece:</p>

<blockquote>An integral part of <em>The Maybe&apos;s</em> incarnation at MoMA in 2013 is that there is no published schedule for its appearance, no artist&apos;s statement released, no no museum statement beyond this brief context, no public profile or image issued. Those who find it chance upon it for themselves, live and in real&#x2014;shared&#x2014;time: now we see it, now we don&apos;t.</blockquote>
