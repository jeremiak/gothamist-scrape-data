<p>There has been a rash of anti-semitic and racist graffiti spotted around NYC in the wake of Donald Trump&apos;s election, and the trend continued this weekend when straphangers spotted swastikas and pro-Trump hate messages on the 1 train.</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="112116swastikas2.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170326060917im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/112116swastikas2.jpg" width="640" height="480"> <br> <i> Joseph L</i></div> <p></p>

<p>Tipster Joseph L sent in the photos above, which he spotted aboard an uptown 1 train he boarded at 23rd Street around 8:15 p.m. Sunday. &quot;All originally looked like the swastika on the seat, but a good spirited rider asked fellow passengers if they has pens, markers, etc. and then transformed them into flowers/stars and even added a few messages of love alongside,&quot; he told us. </p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170326060917/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/reader-spots-swastika-pro-trump-message-manhattan-subway-article-1.2882196">Daily News added</a> that the vandal or vandals used permanent marker in drawing the swastikas. &quot;For me, it was sickeningly ironic that I boarded this train after spending the evening participating in a protest march organized by Jewish Voice for Peace against the hateful sentiment that has become associated with the incoming administration,&quot; Joseph L. added.</p>
