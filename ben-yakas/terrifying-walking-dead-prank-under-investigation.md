<p><em>The Walking Dead</em> returns this weekend for more nihilistic zombie munching and machete-wielding action&#x2014;but just because the show is already a huge ratings bonanza for AMC doesn&apos;t mean the channel doesn&apos;t want to drum up more viral marketing for it. To that end, they released a video of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503193725/http://gothamist.com/2014/02/06/video_walking_dead_prank_scares_the.php">a terrifying prank this week</a> in which &quot;zombies&quot; reached up through a subway grate to scare the shit out of passersby. Except it seems they freaked out NYC officials as well: &quot;We are deeply troubled by this video,&quot; an MTA spokesperson <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503193725/http://pix11.com/2014/02/07/zombie-prank-creator-could-face-charges-after-failing-to-notify-city/#axzz2spoiA9OF">told WPIX</a>. &quot;We have forwarded it to the NYPD and are also conducting our own investigation.&quot;</p>

<p>Permits are required for commercial shoots with actors that use public space, and the MTA says permission was not granted for the company to open up a sidewalk grate. At first, we assumed most of these &quot;scared&quot; people were hired extras, and this was just <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503193725/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/18/everything_about_that_macklemore_su.php">another Macklemore-style lie.</a> But it&apos;s possible AMC just did a really good job of keeping a lid on the prank before releasing the final video. At least a few people did spot the zombies there at the start of last week:</p>

<p>Those AMC folks sure like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503193725/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/17/video_nj_teen_with_one_limb_pranks_1.php">their zombie pranks.</a></p>
