<p>A man was fatally struck by a train in Queens this morning in what police are calling an &quot;apparent suicide.&quot; The incident happened around 11:10 a.m. at the Kew Gardens/Union Turnpike station near Queens Boulevard. Police say the 51-year-old victim threw himself in front of an F train, and was found dead at the scene. No criminality is suspected. </p>

<p>This latest subway death of 2013 comes a little more than a day after a man <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130114084032/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/12/police_man_jumped_in_front_of_q_tra.php">jumped in front of the Q train</a> during rush hour on Friday in Brooklyn. It also comes as the MTA has renewed their intent <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130114084032/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/13/mta_exploring_installing_sliding_do.php">to increase safety measures on subway platforms</a>, which includes an &#x201C;aggressive passenger information campaign&#x201D; to warn straphangers to stand away from the platform edge, and the possibility of sliding doors on select platforms.</p>
