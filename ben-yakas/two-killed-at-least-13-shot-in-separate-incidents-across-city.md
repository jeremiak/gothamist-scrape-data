<p>With summer comes more and more <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140706130139/http://gothamist.com/tags/gunviolence">gun violence</a>: last weekend, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140706130139/http://gothamist.com/2014/06/22/12_people_shot_in_12_hours_in_separ.php">two people were killed and 10 others were shot</a> in separate incidents over the course of 12 hours. And again last night, two people were killed and at least 13 others were shot in separate incidents across the city.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140706130139/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/killed-14-wounded-gun-violence-sweeps-boroughs-article-1.1848401">first fatal shooting</a> happened around 10:20 p.m. when 33-year-old Jason Bragg was found dead with a bullet to the head on 219 Street near 121st Avenue in Queens. Then around 3 a.m., a 28-year-old man was fatally shot in the back when a gunman opened fire on the corner of Tapscott Street and Sutter Avenue in Crown Heights. A 27-year-old woman and 31-year-old man were also shot in the foot and leg. No arrests have been made in either incident, and police say the investigations are ongoing.</p>

<p>As for the other 12 people shot: the violence started when a 10-year-old boy and 25-year-old man <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140706130139/http://gothamist.com/2014/06/29/10-year-old_boy_man_both_hurt_in_co.php">were both shot</a> on Coney Island near the boardwalk just after 7 p.m.  Then around 11 p.m., a man was shot in the foot at E. 99 Street and 2nd Avenue.</p>

<p>The majority of the incidents occurred after midnight: a man was shot in the back around 12:30 a.m. in the Bronx. Four people were shot inside Harlem River Park near E. 139 Street in Manhattan around 2 a.m. That included a 15 and 18-year-old who were both shot in the leg, a woman shot in the torso, and a 21-year-old shot in the foot. The 21-year-old was taken into custody along with two other men in connection with that shooting.</p>

<p>A 40-year-old man was shot in the face on Staten Island outside his home around 3:15 a.m. He was taken to Staten Island University Hospital in critical condition. No arrests have been made in that incident. &quot;This is a busy street, Amboy Road is busy, but it&#x2019;s not an area where you would have a shooting of any kind,&quot; one neighbor <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140706130139/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2014/06/29/violent-night-leaves-at-least-13-shot-in-all-five-boroughs/">told CBS</a> of the shooting. &quot;I mean, we&#x2019;re here five years and this has never happened before.&quot;</p>

<p>Another man was shot in the leg on Bergen Street near Ralph Avenue in Brooklyn around 4 a.m. No arrests have been made in that shooting. Then at 5 a.m., a 24-year-old man was shot at University Avenue &amp; West 195th Street in The Bronx. A 29-year-old man was arrested in connection with that incident.</p>

<p>Finally, the night of violence concluded with a 25-old-man shot twice in the abdomen inside the Linden Houses on Vermont Street and Wortman Avenue. No arrests have been made, and police say that investigation is ongoing. </p>
