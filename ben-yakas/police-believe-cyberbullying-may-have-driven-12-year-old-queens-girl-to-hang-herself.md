Relatives found Gabrielle Molina hanging by a belt from a ceiling fan in her bedroom around 2:15 p.m. on 220th Street in Queens Village. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130729120508/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/queens/qns_kid_hangs_herself_HAiEWK5v5xWQW5wfstzFeP?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Queens">The Post reports</a> that the girl left a suicide note blaming cyberbullying from fellow classmates at Jean Nuzzi Intermediate School 109.<p></p>

<p>Her mom, Glenda Molina, told police that her daughter was depressed over constant online harassment from classmates. &#x201C;She&#x2019;s very quiet, very friendly,&#x201D; said her aunt, Irma Molina. &#x201C;She wanted to dance and sing. She&#x2019;s so young. I don&#x2019;t understand.&#x201D; Molina added that Gabrielle&apos;s sister, 15-year-old Georgie, was the one who initially found her, after the young girl didn&apos;t answer her door.</p>
