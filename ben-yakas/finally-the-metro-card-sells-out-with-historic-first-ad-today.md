										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="10712metro.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150712131701im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/10712metro.jpg" width="640" height="430"> <br> <i> MTA </i></div> <p></p>

<p>It&apos;s been a long and storied road for everyone&apos;s beloved &quot;MetroCard Gold&quot; since it was first introduced in 1997. But the MTA is like a Woody Allen quote about sharks&#x2014;it has to constantly move forward, or it&apos;ll die. And to that end, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150712131701/http://gothamist.com/tags/metrocard">the MetroCard</a> is officially <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150712131701/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/18/mta_now_selling_ads_on_front_of_you.php">selling out</a>. Today, the MTA will start selling a new blue-colored card advertising The Gap, which reads &#x201C;Be Bright NYC.&quot; Hmm, maybe they thought the slogan, &quot;Fall Into The Gap,&quot; might send the wrong message?</p>

<p><iframe width="640" height="480" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150712131701if_/http://www.youtube.com/embed/CCEBoOy0ne8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>The MTA is making no bones about why they are putting ads on the front of the iconic cards for the first time: &#x201C;Opening up the front of MetroCards to advertising gives the MTA a new source of revenue,&#x201D; said MTA Chairman and CEO Joseph J. Lhota. &#x201C;We will monitor public acceptance of ads going forward to ensure that it doesn&#x2019;t interfere with use of the transit system. There is no reason why the MTA shouldn&#x2019;t put every resource it can toward helping its fragile finances.&#x201D; And really, the MTA <em>needs</em> the cash&#x2014;the more we can avoid <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150712131701/http://gothamist.com/2012/09/17/mta_2013_250_rides_no_bonuses_109_m.php">price spikes</a>, the better.</p>

<p>It&apos;s just too bad it&apos;s so gimmicky: according to a press release, the card &quot;encourages New Yorkers to visit Gap&#x2019;s newly remodeled flagship store at 34th Street and Broadway starting October 10, 2012.&quot; Customers who bring the MetroCard with them to any Gap store in the city are entitled to a 20% discount through November 18th. You may not get one so easily though: only about 10% of MetroCards sold throughout the system in a month will have the ad.</p>

<p>And on top of that, the cards are only being sold at 10 stations in Manhattan for now. <br>
So you&apos;ll really have to go out of your way to get a discount on that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150712131701/http://www.gap.com/browse/product.do?cid=78237&amp;vid=1&amp;pid=252559022">oversized turtleneck of your dreams</a>. Check out the full list of stations below.</p>
