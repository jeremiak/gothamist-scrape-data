<p>The city went back to work yesterday, but it&apos;s technically still Christmas (through January 5th!), and our post-holiday season stupor is not going anywhere&#x2014;it&apos;s never a good sign when you find yourself thinking, &apos;if only we could turn back time to two weeks ago, when it was blissful and holiday music was in the air and it was 50 degrees outside.&apos; But while work on the flux capacitor is still ongoing, a little bit of <em>Elf</em> goes a long way for us. The area man in the video below made this homage to Will Ferrell&apos;s effortlessly sweet NYC Christmas movie, <em>Elf</em>: &quot;Decided it would be a great idea to dress up like Buddy Elf and wander around NYC. It was a great idea.&quot; Watch it below, watch the montage from the original film below that, and ask yourself what Buddy would say next time you&apos;re outside and realize you can&apos;t feel your face.</p>
