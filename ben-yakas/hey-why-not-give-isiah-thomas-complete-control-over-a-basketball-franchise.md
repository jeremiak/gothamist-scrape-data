Clippers officially <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506172950/http://sports.espn.go.com/los-angeles/nba/news/story?id=4887981">parted ways</a> with head coach Mike Dunleavy today after nearly seven <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506172950/http://sportscommentary.suite101.com/article.cfm/clippersplayoffrunhistoric">somewhat successful</a> seasons, opening up the possibility that they may hire <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506172950/http://gothamist.com/tags/isiahthomas">Isiah Thomas</a> in his stead&#x2014;Wait, <em>what</em>??<p></p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506172950/http://msn.foxsports.com/cbk/story/Los-Angeles-Clippers-Isiah-Thomas-020510">Fox Sports</a>, the Clippers have reached out to Thomas, the NBA Hall of Famer and current men&#x2019;s basketball coach at Florida International University, to potentially take over<strong> &quot;coaching, general manager and president duties.&quot;</strong> This isn&apos;t the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506172950/http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=4016566">first time</a> the notoriously <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506172950/http://espn.go.com/blog/TrueHoop/post/_/id/12853/the-high-cost-of-dunlea">thrifty</a> Clippers have met with and considered Isiah for a coaching position.</p>

<p>You know, this actually is a completely logical move. Sure, Isiah had a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506172950/http://gothamist.com/2008/04/08/the_tragedy_tha.php">turbulent time</a> in NY, but it isn&apos;t like anybody called his tenure as coach and team president of the Knicks <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506172950/http://nymag.com/news/sports/45787/">&quot;the worst team in sports history.&quot;</a> Sure, he was a little <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506172950/http://gothamist.com/2008/01/03/holy_shit_isiah.php">delusional</a>, didn&apos;t get along <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506172950/http://gothamist.com/2007/12/11/you_cant_make_t.php">with the fans</a>, sparked some <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506172950/http://gothamist.com/2007/09/25/decker.php">sex scandals</a>, and made some of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506172950/http://gothamist.com/2006/02/22/here_comes_stev.php">dumbest trades</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506172950/http://gothamist.com/2006/05/24/knicks_almost_w.php">deals</a> in basketball history. But who wouldn&apos;t give their 13 year-old-kid, who is fantastic at Need-For-Speed, the keys to their multi-million dollar car, even after he wrecked it the first time? </p>

<p>For once, Knicks fans, we can just be glad it&apos;s not us.</p>
