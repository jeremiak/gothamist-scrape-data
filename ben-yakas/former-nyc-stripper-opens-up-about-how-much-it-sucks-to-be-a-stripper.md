<p>Films like <em>The Full Monty</em>, <em>Striptease</em>, <em>Magic Mike</em> and <em>Showgirls</em> make stripping seem like a sex-positive, fun way to make a chunk of change, self-actualize, maybe meet your true love, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508194127/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XO8YeQ60CFY">learn to appreciate the songwriting of Randy Newman</a>. However, according to one former NYC stripper <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508194127/http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1mmxh7/iama_former_male_stripperall_that_glitters_isnt/">who did a Reddit AMA today,</a> it&apos;s more depressing than anything else. </p>

<p>The former stripper, who worked on and off for a decade, described the job as &quot;kinda like your parents house....it&apos;s great to visit but you don&apos;t want to stay too long.&quot; He said he got out of the business due to being sent on one too many &quot;blind calls,&quot; a term he invented to describe a situation when an agency doesn&apos;t have a picture on file, but sends you to a job anyway, sometimes to the disappointment of the customer. He described his epiphany:</p>

<blockquote>I had a &quot;i&apos;m getting too old for this shit&quot; moment in the summer of 2010 when I got kicked out of woman&apos;s house because I wasn&apos;t &quot;hispanic looking enough&quot;....apparently she wanted someone who looked &quot;Dominican&quot;.....I can&apos;t make this stuff up...

<p>i had to change outside in the fucking street when I got kicked out...fortunately the street had no street lights</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>Throughout the thread, the former stripper keeps trying to come up with lurid, jolly anecdotes, but instead lapses into sad reveries. When asked whether he had any enjoyable gigs that &quot;make you want to return to the industry,&quot; he responded:</p>

<blockquote>no.....not the one
actually- there was one and the only thing I remember about it was the fact that i LITERALLY brought home the money I made in a Walmart bag
I felt like Scrooge McDuck with a fake tan and a Adam Lambert haircut that night
other than that I, in retrospect, the fact that I ever stripped as long as I did....<strong>I realized that all those weekends I lost I could have been on LEGIT dates with girls that I could have cultivated deep relationships with</strong></blockquote>

<p>He said his various gigs as &quot;very Groundhogs day like.&quot; He notes that a lot of women are uncomfortable having fully-naked men in their homes, even when they&apos;re strippers. He claims that stripping destroyed his dating life. He believes working as a stripper &quot;will further accentuate that lower self esteem in the long run...Fact is you are not developing self respect or esteem...you are exploiting a facade...you are exploiting something that isn&apos;t true.&quot; </p>

As for his worst experiences: &quot;nipple biting incident in Glens Falls NY and having my cock pulled like fucking turkish taffee in Brooklyn by some drunk pig.....&quot;</p>
