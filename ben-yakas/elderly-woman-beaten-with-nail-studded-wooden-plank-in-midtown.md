Police confirmed the woman was discovered bleeding from the head with bruises all over her body after being attacked by a suspect with a 2-by-4 piece of wood. &#x201C;I stepped outside and saw a woman laying near a puddle of blood,&#x201D; said witness Rasheeda Kin, a security guard at a building nearby.<p></p>

<p>Andre Lineaux, 51, allegedly attacked the woman at East 40th Street near Madison Avenue at around 6:15 p.m. &#x201C;I was just cleaning up and looking out the window when I noticed a guy was following her down the street,&#x201D; said witness Carmarino Mendez. &#x201C;He looked like he was harassing her and yelling at her.&quot; Witnesses say that&apos;s when Lineaux starting hitting her with a five-foot, 2-by-4 piece of wood. &#x201C;I saw him hit her across her face with something and beat her when she fell,&#x201D; said Mendez. </p>

<p>Lineaux has been arrested; the victim was taken to Bellevue, where she is being treated for a laceration to the head, as well as possible skull fracture and possible broken arm.</p>
