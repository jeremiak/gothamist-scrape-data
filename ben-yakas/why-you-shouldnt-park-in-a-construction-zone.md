<p>This close call between a BMW and a construction vehicle was spotted at the corner of Mott and Bleeker Streets. And it is truly a mystery for the ages: how did the BMW get there? Did it parallel park under the arm, or was it there and then the arm came later? Was this some sort of homage <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150627113456/http://www.avclub.com/articles/something-is-wrong,81803/">to that third season <em>Louie</em> episode</a> with the hieroglyphic parking signs and emasculating car destruction? Everything really is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150627113456/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/21/louis_ck_hosting_saturday_night_liv.php">coming up Louis C.K.</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150627113456/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/21/grandma_sues_trader_joes_after_gett.php">today.</a></p>

<p>Dev Brumberger, who took the photo above, adds this: &quot;Honestly we didn&apos;t see any construction happening which made it all the more awkward.  The photo is taken standing on Bleecker. I think the machine was in front of what is/was Planned Parenthood. At first we thought someone decided it looked like a great parking spot but upon closer inspection the car hood is dented so it may have fallen on it.&quot; Below, take a closer look at the hood:</p>
