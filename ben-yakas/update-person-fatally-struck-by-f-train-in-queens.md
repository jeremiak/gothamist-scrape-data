<p>For the second day in a row, a person was fatally struck by an F train in Queens this morning. According to FDNY, the incident happened at 10:34 a.m. at the Briarwood/Van Wyck Boulevard stations. The person was fatally struck by an F train, and was pronounced DOA at the scene. </p>

<p>We&apos;ll update when we learn any more information. The MTA adds that there are delays on the E and F lines as a result of the investigation. Yesterday, a man <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130326200140/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/20/breaking_person_reportedly_struck_a.php">was also fatally struck by an F train</a> at the Roosevelt Avenue / 74th Street station in Jackson Heights; another <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130326200140/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/20/breaking_another_person_struck_by_a.php">man was injured</a> after falling onto the tracks at Columbus Circle as well.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong>: Scarlett F. was on the train when the incident occurred this morning. She told us what happened from her perspective:</p>

<blockquote>The conductor announced that there was a delay to get a customer off the tracks. I did not immediately understand that this meant that the customer was under the train. A few minutes later, police officers walked onto the platform and began to look under the second car of the train. (That is the one I was on.) An MTA official then walked into the car from the first car and instructed the passengers to get off the train and &quot;walk to the left&quot; to avoid walking near the officers that were looking under the train.

<p>As I exited the station, I saw that one of the officers came up from the platform and asked another officer who was holding the exit door if he had any more crime scene tape. (I am not sure if it was to be used to hold exit doors open, for the actual scene of the crime/event, or some other purpose.)</p></blockquote><p></p>
