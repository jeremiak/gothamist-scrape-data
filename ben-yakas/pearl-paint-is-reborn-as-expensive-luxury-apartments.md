</div></div>					<p>Bruce Springsteen <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170326162950/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3eu1gW-bQ8">once sang</a>, &quot;Everything dies baby, that&apos;s a fact&#x2014;but maybe everything that dies someday comes back to life as luxury housing.&quot; And so it goes for the former site of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170326162950/http://gothamist.com/tags/pearlpaint">Pearl Paint</a>, the beloved art supply store on Canal Street that closed down in 2014. According <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170326162950/http://ny.curbed.com/2017/3/24/15048544/tribeca-pearl-paint-art-store-luxury-rentals">to Curbed,</a> the old store has now been converted into four apartments going for over $16,000/month each.</p>

<p>The listings at 57 Lispenard Street just hit the market&#x2014;you can see a few photos from the properties above, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170326162950/http://www.corcoran.com/nyc/Listings/Display/5103176">even more at Corcoran.</a> Unsurprisingly, they are using Pearl as a selling point, as with the &quot;brand new, full floor loft in the stunning residential conversion of the iconic art store, Pearl Paint.&quot; The classic neon sign that once hung outside the store is now installed in the lobby of the building.</p>

<p>As <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170326162950/http://ny.curbed.com/2017/3/24/15048544/tribeca-pearl-paint-art-store-luxury-rentals">Curbed wrote</a>, &quot;Each unit is a full-floor loft measuring 2,365 square feet, with the usual spate of fancy features: wine fridge, nice appliances, radiant floors in the bathroom, you get the idea. Some of the building&#x2019;s prewar details&#x2014;columns in the living room, exposed brick&#x2014;remain, and each apartment has a large &apos;great room&apos; with huge windows.&quot; Perfect for admiring the city skyline as all the unique character steadily bleeds out. </p>

<p>The second floor is going for $16,000/month; the third floor is $16,500/month; the fourth floor is $17,000/month; and the penthouse is going for $18,000/month. It is safe to say that none of us could afford <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170326162950/http://streeteasy.com/building/57-lispenard-street-new_york#tab_building_detail=2">any of those.</a> But hey, this is as good a reminder as any that everything you love in this city will eventually disappoint you and/or be ruined by capitalism. The sooner we all internalize this, the happier we can be admitting <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170326162950/http://gothamist.com/2017/03/24/the_struggle_is_unreal.php">the future is not for us.</a></p>
