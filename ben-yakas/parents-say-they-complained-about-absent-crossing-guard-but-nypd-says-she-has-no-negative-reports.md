<p>On Thursday morning, 6-year-old Amar Diarrassouba <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307035802/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/28/6-year-old_boy_killed_killed_by_tra.php">was killed by a truck driver</a> as he walked to school in East Harlem. It has since come out that crossing guard Flavia Roman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307035802/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/01/school_crossing_guard_never_showed.php">never showed up for work</a> that morning, and had lied about her whereabouts. Now, angry parents of kids at PS 155 near the intersection <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307035802/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/parents_we_had_petition_to_ax_her_fjlyD4lq0XqC4z87REl8UK">tell the Post</a> they have been complaining about Roman and her frequent absences for years. &#x201C;We have been complaining to the school for three or four years about her,&#x201D; said mother-of-two Tara French. &#x201C;I was here at 7:35 a.m. [Thursday], and she was not here.&#x201D;</p>

<p>French said that she and other parents had called 311, and allegedly spoken to the school&#x2019;s safety agent and school officials about the guard, but &#x201C;the school says it&#x2019;s not their responsibility, that we need to talk to the NYPD and sign a petition.&#x201D; Another mom, Lydia Soto, told the Post that she and a dozen local parents signed a petition in 2010 wanting to remove Roman. They also allegedly made an official complaint to the 25th Precinct. </p>

<p>However, both the NYPD and Department of Education spokeswoman said there were no records of any complaints. Police Commissioner Ray Kelly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307035802/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/02/nyregion/guard-was-not-at-east-harlem-crossing-when-truck-killed-boy-6.html">backed that up to the Times</a>: &#x201C;She has a very good history,&#x201D; Kelly said. &#x201C;She&#x2019;s worked on that post, in essence, for 10 years. There were no negative reports. She was very well received and appreciated by the community.&#x201D; Mom Yasmin Neil, who walks her two kids to school everyday, noted: &#x201C;I&#x2019;ve lived here two years and I never knew there was a crossing guard there.&quot;</p>

<p>Amar Diarrassouba was killed shortly before 8 a.m. at the intersection of 117th Street and First Avenue on Thursday, one block from his school. Roma told investigators that she was not at work because she had an unspecified emergency that morning. Kelly added that Roman is unlikely to face any criminal charges, though she has been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307035802/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/01/school_crossing_guard_suspended_aft.php">suspended without pay.</a> &#x201C;She did not notify anyone that she would not be on her post,&#x201D; Kelly said.</p>
