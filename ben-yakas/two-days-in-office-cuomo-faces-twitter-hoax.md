<p>Yesterday, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110226121707/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/01/andrew_cuomo_is_your_new_governor.php">newly sworn-in</a> Governor Andrew Cuomo&apos;s twitter account was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110226121707/http://nyctheblog.blogspot.com/2011/01/did-twitter-suspend-and-delete-new-york.html">mysteriously deleted</a> &quot;due to strange activity.&quot; Shortly afterwards, a new account was linked on Cuomo&apos;s website, called &quot;NYGovernor.&quot; And his initial bio for the twitter was: &quot;<strong>First elected Governor of the State of New York since the Luv Guv. @shellysilver calls me Mario&apos;s Kid. I live with @sandrashm and like classic cars</strong>.&quot; Does Andrew Cuomo have a better sense of humor than any of us realized?</p>

<p>No, probably not. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110226121707/http://nyctheblog.blogspot.com/2011/01/breaking-new-york-governor-andrew-cuomo.html">NYC The Blog investigated</a> the strange twitterings, and discovered that the new twitter account was an incredibly well-maintained hoax that somehow slipped past Cuomo&apos;s handlers eyes. After the initial &quot;Luv Guv&quot; bio raised some eyebrows, the Faux Cuomo updated the bio, upgrading the style of cars he loves and dropping a Jay-Z reference: &quot;I govern the Empire State that&apos;s NEW YORK! (h/t JayZ). (Fake) @shellysilver calls me Mario&apos;s Kid. I live with @sandrashm and like muscle cars.&quot;</p>

<p>After a long series of back and forth tweets with Faux Cuomo, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110226121707/http://twitter.com/nyctheblog">NYC The Blog</a> and upstate reporter <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110226121707/http://twitter.com/NickReisman">Nick Reisman</a> sorted through all the confusion, and Cuomo&apos;s team updated his site with the real new twitter account (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110226121707/http://twitter.com/NYGovCuomo">NYGovCuomo</a>). And the Faux Cuomo even (kind of) admitted to the hoax, tweeting that the P in Andrew P. Cuomo stood for &quot;Phony.&quot; </p>

<p>You can see more screengrabs of Twittergate 2011 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110226121707/http://www.facebook.com/album.php?fbid=10150379357705057&amp;id=406462895056&amp;aid=597341">here</a>. While it may be a little embarrassing that Cuomo&apos;s team allowed the link to appear on his official website, he can take comfort knowing that he&apos;s gotten through the first sort-of scandal of his administration. </p>
