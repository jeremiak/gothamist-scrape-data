<p>Cops are still looking for the cyclist, seen in fluorescent clothing at the bottom of the frame in the surveillance video above. A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406153709/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/20/skateboarder-is-fatally-struck-by-truck-near-union-square/">commenter on City Room</a> who claims to have witnessed the accident gave this account of the incident: </p>

<blockquote>Both the skateboarder and the truck were moving south on University place. The skateboarder was moving along side the truck. A man on a bicycle riding north on University place caused the skateboarder to swerve into the truck with his board and himself going underneath the vehicle. The truck driver was not doing anything wrong and probably could not have seen the Boarder who was moving along the right side of the truck.</blockquote>

<p>Anyone with information about the cyclist seen in the video can contact the NYPD anonymously at 1-800-577 TIPS.</p>
