U guys!! So jaded! ;)&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Update 7:25 p.m.</strong>: You can watch a live stream of Bloomberg&apos;s announcement at 7:30 p.m. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408144126/http://www.nyc.gov/portal/site/nycgov/menuitem.b270a4a1d51bb3017bce0ed101c789a0/index.jsp?pageID=nyc_blue_room&amp;catID=1194&amp;doc_name=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nyc.gov%2Fhtml%2Fom%2Fhtml%2Flive_press_event.html&amp;cc=unused1975&amp;rc=1194&amp;ndi=1">in the link here.</a></p>

<p><strong>Update 8:40 p.m.</strong>: At the press conference this evening, Bloomberg, Kelly and Vance laid out the case against 27-year-old Manhattan resident and al-Qaeda sympathizer Jose Pimentel. &quot;The suspect was a so-called lone wolf, motivated by his own resentment of American troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as al Qaeda propaganda,&quot; Bloomberg said. &quot;He was not part of a larger conspiracy emanating from abroad.&quot;</p>

<p>Pimentel was a follower of extremist cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408144126/http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2011/11/bloomberg_nypd_thwarts_al_qaed.html">according to</a> NYPD Commissioner Ray Kelly; he also often talked about changing his name to &quot;Osama Hussein&quot; after his two &quot;heroes.&quot; Pimentel was allegedly extra motivated after the death of the U.S.-born <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408144126/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/30/american-born_al_qaeda_leader_anwar.php">al-Awlaki in September.</a></p>

<p>Watched since May 2009, Pimintel made incriminating statements to an informant who was working with the NYPD. Authorities felt the need to move in quickly against him Saturday because he had begun &quot;drilling a hole for bombs&quot;&#x2014;he had all the materials ready to complete his bombs and seemed prepared to attack certain of his NYC targets. Kelly added that Pimentel tried to build several nail bombs before authorities arrested him: &quot;We had always planned to take him into custody before he could detonate a fully-operated bomb,&quot; Kelly said.</p>
