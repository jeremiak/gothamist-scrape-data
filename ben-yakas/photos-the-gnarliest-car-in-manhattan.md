But <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508194058/http://www.reddit.com/r/nyc/comments/1v7bg0/if_youre_gonna_have_a_car_in_nyc/">Reddit user Chrisgee</a> has brought one to our attention that begs closer examination: &quot;It&apos;s always parked on 27th between 2nd and 3rd. Owner is a size-able black lady who I believe does all the modifications herself. Every few weeks a new feature is added,&quot; one Redditor wrote. </p>

<p>Based on some other comments, it seems this car has been hanging around the neighborhood for the last five years or more! And the owner takes very good care of it: &quot;A woman owns it and often has the hood popped on weekends working on it,&quot; another Reddit wrote. <strong>&quot;When it backs up it makes the sounds of chirping birds...Seriously.&quot; </strong> It&apos;s pretty cool, but can it take <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508194058/http://www.flickr.com/photos/onesevenone/4041871866/">a thousands photos at once</a>?</p>
