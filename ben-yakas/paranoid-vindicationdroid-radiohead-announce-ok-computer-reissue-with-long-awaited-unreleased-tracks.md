</div></div>					<p>After teasing us with a series of cryptic posters around the world and releasing an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170502194754/http://pitchfork.com/news/73215-radiohead-share-mysterious-new-video-with-ok-computer-lyrics-watch/">equally-cryptic video</a> yesterday, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170502194754/http://gothamist.com/tags/radiohead">Radiohead</a> have announced a 20th anniversary reissue of their landmark album <em>OK Computer</em> called <em>OKNOTOKCOMPUTER</em>, featuring b-sides and three unreleased tracks that fans have been salivating over for two decades. But more importantly: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170502194754/http://gothamist.com/2017/04/25/radiohead_conspiracy_theory_alert_t.php">I WAS RIGHT ABOUT THE RADIOHEAD CONSPIRACY THEORY.</a> NOTHING CAN TAKE AWAY THE EXQUISITE PLEASURE OF SWEET VINDICATION. </p>

<p>Okay, back to Radiohead! The big news is the three unreleased tracks that any Radiohead fan worth their weight in Thom Yorke ponytails is likely already obsessed with: &quot;Lift,&quot; &quot;I Promise&quot; and &quot;Man Of War&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;Big Boots&quot;). All three were played at various times around the <em>OKC</em> period and became fan-favorites. Johnny Greenwood let slip last year that the band was working on &quot;Lift&quot; as well <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170502194754/http://www.stereogum.com/1809610/jonny-greenwood-confirms-radiohead-are-recording-a-version-of-90s-rarity-lift/news/">in an interview</a>: &quot;It&#x2019;s a &#x201C;management-favorite.&#x201D; What people don&#x2019;t know is that there&#x2019;s a very old song on each album, like &apos;Nude&apos; on <em>In Rainbows</em>. We never found the right arrangement for that, until then. &apos;Lift&apos; is just like that. When the idea is right, it stays right. It doesn&#x2019;t really matter in which form.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Lift,&quot; in particular, always seemed like a shoe-in for late &apos;90s rock radio. It was the hit that got away:</p>

<p>The band attempted to record &quot;Man Of War&quot; for <em>The Avengers</em> soundtrack (not the Marvel characters, the Sean Connery/Ralph Fiennes /Uma Thurman film adaptation of the British television series no one remembers for a very good reason&#x2014;it&apos;s really bad), and clips of those tortured sessions appeared in the documentary, <em>Meeting People Is Easy</em>.</p>

<p>And &quot;I Promise&quot; had a bit of an R.E.M. vibe:</p>

<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170502194754if_/https://www.youtube.com/embed/nlWR8hCFg_o" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>It&apos;s a <em>tiny</em> bit disappointing that we aren&apos;t getting any of the other legendary songs which were recorded/attempted during the <em>OKC</em> sessions (that includes &quot;Follow Me Around,&quot; and the original versions of &quot;Last Flowers,&quot; &quot;Nude,&quot; &quot;True Love Waits&quot; and possibly &quot;The National Anthem&quot; and &quot;Knives Out&quot;), but the three being released were definitely the cream of the crop. In addition to those tracks, <em>OKNOTOKCOMPUTER</em> comes with a remastered version of the original 12-track album plus the 8 released b-sides. </p>

<p>The digital version is out June 23rd, and physical editions will ship in July. For superfans, there is also an <em>OKNOTOK BOXED EDITION</em> which will ship July: </p>

<blockquote>Featuring a black box emblazoned with a dark image of a burned copy of OK COMPUTER containing three heavyweight 180 gram black 12&quot; vinyl records and a hardcover book containing more than thirty artworks (many of which have never been seen before) and full lyrics to all the tracks (except the ones that haven&#x2019;t really got any lyrics). Under this weighty tome are yet more surprises: a notebook containing 104 pages from Thom Yorke&#x2019;s library of scrawled notes of the time, a sketchbook containing 48 pages of Donwood and Tchock&#x2019;s &#x2018;preparatory work&#x2019; and a C90 cassette mix tape compiled by the band, taken from OK COMPUTER session archives and demo tapes.</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170502194754/http://gothamist.com/2017/04/25/radiohead_conspiracy_theory_alert_t.php">The reissue was teased</a> in recent weeks with a series of mysterious posters which showed up in Berlin, London, Amsterdam, Brooklyn and more, all featuring the dates &quot;1997 - 2017&quot; (<em>OK Computer</em> was released on May 21st, 1997). <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170502194754/https://www.reddit.com/r/radiohead/comments/67f295/weird_shit_goin_down/">Fans on Reddit</a> found a piece of OK-era concept artwork (compiled online almost five years ago) with a similar picture. The locations of the posters all seemed to correlate with the offices of Beggars Group, of which XL, Radiohead&apos;s label, is a part of. And the band&apos;s longtime producer, Nigel Godrich, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170502194754/https://twitter.com/nigelgod/status/847179253749833732?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref_url=http%3A%2F%2Fgothamist.com%2F2017%2F04%2F25%2Fradiohead_conspiracy_theory_alert_t.php">tweeted a photo</a> of his OK-era recording notebook last month. </p>

<p>You can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170502194754/http://www.oknotok.co.uk/">pre-order the reissue here.</a></p>

<p>And I will leave this here (h/t nicemarmot): </p>
