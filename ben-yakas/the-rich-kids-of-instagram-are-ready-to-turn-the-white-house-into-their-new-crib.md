<p>In his first week in office, President Trump has already <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170127165203/http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/25/politics/donald-trump-build-wall-immigration-executive-orders/index.html">moved to start building</a> a Mexican border wall, promised <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170127165203/http://gothamist.com/2017/01/25/president_gaslight_promises.php">a nonsensical investigation</a> into non-existent voter fraud, readied <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170127165203/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/25/us/politics/refugees-immigrants-wall-trump.html">an executive order</a> barring refugees from Middle Eastern countries, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170127165203/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/25/us/politics/president-trump-white-house.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=b-lede-package-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news">watched a lot of TV</a>, and expressed his confidence <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170127165203/http://deadline.com/2017/01/donald-trump-waterboarding-works-david-muir-video-1201894071/">in the effectiveness of torture</a>. It is more important than ever for news agencies to keep their eye on the ball and hold those in power accountable. But <em>on the other hand</em>, what&apos;s up with Tiffany Trump?!?</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170127165203/http://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/everything-you-didnt-know-about-the-trump-kids-w462636">US Weekly made sure</a> everyone knows where they stand on the Trumps by putting his children on the cover of their latest issue, ensuring themselves a place in collaborators hell. Look, they&apos;re giving Baron a noogie, what adorable goofballs! Don Jr. spent a year as an Aspen ski bum, what a nice thing to brag about! Donald once cheated to make sure he would beat 7-year-old Ivanka at a ski race, how relatable! But the biggest bombshell? Tiffany Trump is a member of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170127165203/https://www.instagram.com/richkidsofinstagram/">Rich Kids Of Instagram</a>, and they are now using her to turn the White House into their personal Snapchat hellscape.</p>

In case you&apos;ve blocked it from your mind, the Rich Kids Of Instagram are a loose collective of vapid flibbertigibbets who happen to be the filthy rich progeny of successful businesspeople, musicians, actors, politicians, etc. Having been afforded all of life&apos;s pleasures without having to do any of the work to get them, they spend their time un-self consciously promoting their various clothing lines and personal brands on Instagram, often to comically absurd effect. </p>

So poor Tiffany, who apparently <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170127165203/http://thehill.com/blogs/in-the-know/297312-marla-maples-trump-shoots-from-the-hip">barely knows her father</a> and was often treated like an afterthought (compared to the other Trump kids) during the campaign, is now the lynchpin for the Rich Kids gang to get a foot in the White House door. The group &quot;is going to make the White House their new locale. They&#x2019;re ready to up their Instagram game big time,&quot; a source told US Weekly. </p>

<p>It seems Tiffany is friends with Andrew Warren (she pops up in a promo for his &quot;Just Drew&quot; clothing line in the video below), who you might remember as the main character of a particularly hilarious NY Times Style Section story last year. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170127165203/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/07/the_style_sections_apotheosis.php">That story was</a> a beautiful love letter to the Instagram-filtering, pajama-partying, method-acting 20-somethings just trying to hustle other rich people into buying their signature handkerchief silk charmeuse slip dresses while snapchatting scenes of their poor live-in housekeeper struggling to do household tasks. And now that crew of Millennial hangers-on can selfie their nights away in the Oval Office.</p>

<p>Anyway, even with all that, we still feel bad for Tiffany, whose anonymous &quot;friend&quot; gave US the saddest pull-quote: &quot;When staying at a Trump hotel, [Tiffany&apos;s] careful not to go overboard on room service,&quot; the friend said. &quot;I&apos;ve heard her say, &apos;I&apos;m lucky to have a room here!&apos;&quot; If this whole father/daughter thing doesn&apos;t work out, at least she can go back to one of the two states <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170127165203/https://heatst.com/politics/exclusive-tiffany-trump-is-currently-registered-to-vote-in-two-states/">she&apos;s registered to vote in.</a></p>
