<p>Considering how many New Yorkers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422200939/http://gothamist.com/tags/cis">are killed every year due to automobile collisions</a>, we sometimes feel lucky just to be able to walk around the city in one piece. Now someone is pitching &quot;Ring Around The Cabbie,&quot; a tiresome, one-person rendition of a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422200939/http://www.npr.org/blogs/codeswitch/2013/10/31/228876599/what-s-so-chinese-about-a-chinese-fire-drill">&quot;Chinese fire drill&quot;</a> (only with random cabs in traffic) as their next ticket to viral notoriety. Not only is this rude to the cab driver and hazardous to the prankster&#x2014;it unnecessarily endangers other drivers, pedestrians, and cyclists.</p>

<p>So you can now add this selfish tool to the ever-growing list of irritating New Yorkers, along with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422200939/http://gothamist.com/tags/paparazzi">paparazzi</a>, people who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422200939/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/11/please_stop_with_the_subway_dance_p.php">try to start subway dance parties</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422200939/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/15/video_annoying_nyu_student_taken_to.php">NYU students</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422200939/http://gothamist.com/2012/08/31/video_is_this_the_most_annoying_bro.php">couples who work out together</a>, people who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422200939/http://gothamist.com/tags/paparazzi">take up too much space on the subway</a>, mouth breathers, people who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422200939/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/03/video_usa_chant_falls_flat_on_l_tra.php">try to start chants</a>, etc.</p>
