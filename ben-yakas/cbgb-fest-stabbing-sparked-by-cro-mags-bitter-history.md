<p>On Friday night, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170514171559/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/06/two_stabbed_during_cbgb_fest_show_a.php">two people were stabbed and one person was bitten</a> at Webster Hall during the Cro-Mags and Sick Of It All show for the CBGB Festival. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170514171559/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/07/this_is_hardcore_cro-mags_founder_a.php">Police arrested Harley Flanagan</a>, former bassist and founding member of Cro-Mags, for the attacks; he&apos;s been charged with assault and criminal weapons possession. It seems this fight was the culmination of decades of bad blood between current and former band members: &#x201C;He&#x2019;s been telling people that he was going to do this s--t,&#x201D; lead singer and band co-founder John &#x201C;Bloodclot&#x201D; Joseph <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170514171559/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/feud_rock_roils_aWmDzxjx0JQxlQeX61NJ1H/1">told the Post</a>. &#x201C;Nobody in the band likes him.&#x201D;</p>

<p>In the video below, taken just after the stabbing, Joseph explains to the Webster Hall crowd why the show was cancelled: &#x201C;You can all thank Harley Flanagan for ruining the night for everyone.&#x201D; </p>

<p>Joseph told the paper he and Flanagan started the band together in the early &apos;80s, but Flanagan continually takes all the credit for himself&#x2014;Joseph claims it was so bad, Flanagan pocketed every cent from their 1986 tour: &#x201C;That caused me to lose my apartment and be homeless in 1987,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;I lived hand to mouth.&#x201D; In general, Joseph describes Flanagan as an out of control character, stalking the LES looking for fights or threatening fans with a baseball bat. </p>

<p>Joseph added that Flanagan had been posting threats on the band&apos;s Facebook leading up the show, and he warned CBGB Fest not to let him in, but he ended up getting a press pass: &#x201C;He shouldn&#x2019;t have been at that show. He showed up at the show with a knife. It shows intent.&quot; Flanagan is accused of stabbing Cro-Mags current bassist Michael Couls, who was cut on his arm and stomach, and William Berario, who was slashed above the eye and bitten on his cheek. </p>

<p>&#x201C;This dude has been a negative thorn in the side of this band forever,&#x201D; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170514171559/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/08/nyregion/behind-stabbing-a-feud-about-a-band-called-the-cro-mags.html?_r=1&amp;partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;pagewanted=all">Joseph told the Times</a>. &#x201C;I hope he gets what&#x2019;s coming to him.&#x201D; Flanagan&apos;s lawyer, Sean Parmenter, said his client was acting in self-defense and was &#x201C;jumped&#x201D; in &#x201C;retribution&#x201D; by his former bandmates.</p>

<p>As for the future of the group, it doesn&apos;t look like Flanagan is wanted back: &#x201C;You could offer me $100,000; I wouldn&#x2019;t do it. I hope his ass goes to Rikers with his swastika tattoo,&#x201D; Joseph said.</p>
