<p>Back in the spring, a tourist sidewalk lane <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406145224/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/19/tourists_now_have_their_own_sidewal.php">magically appeared</a> along Fifth Avenue, separating the chaff of idle skyscraper-gazers from the wheat of get-out-of-our-way natives. At first, rumor had it that it was a piece by British invader <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406145224/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/22/is_tourist_sidewalk_lane_a_banksy.php">Banksy</a>, but it was eventually revealed to be an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406145224/http://gothamist.com/2010/06/08/that_sidewalk_line_dividing_tourist.php">Improv Everywhere prank</a>. But in a new twist today, it seems the British are borrowing the idea to utilize in one of the busiest streets in London.</p>

<p>New West End Company, a group of 600 business owners in the district around Oxford Street, is planning to direct slow movers to walk in a &quot;shopper lane&quot; along store fronts, so that hurried residents and workers can proceed without traffic on the edge of the sidewalks. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406145224/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704164004575547701061890026.html?mod=WSJ_World_MIDDLENews">Wall Street Journal says</a> the idea &quot;echoes a gag played in New York City last May,&quot; attributing it to IE.  There would be no legal consequences to disobeying the lanes, but an &quot;army of privately funded Red Caps&quot; will be used to gently sway people toward their designated lane. </p>

<p>The Fast Lane Campaign had been proposed for Oxford Street as far back <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406145224/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/1049698.stm">as 2000</a>, to help ward off and prevent &quot;pavement rage,&quot; but perhaps it took seeing the idea in action in NYC to finalize their resolve. We spoke to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406145224/http://improveverywhere.com/charlie_todd/">Charlie Todd</a>, founder of Improv Everywhere, about the project, which was a collaboration with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406145224/http://www.jeffgreenspan.com/">Jeff Greenspan</a>: </p>

<blockquote>No, no one has contacted us from London about our project, and I can&apos;t say if we had any influence over it or not.  I will say that our project was intended as a complete joke.  <strong>I think it would absurd to actually have fast and slow lanes on a sidewalk, and even more absurd to have people wearing red hats walking around enforcing it.</strong>  People walk at many different speeds-- &quot;fast&quot; and &quot;slow&quot; doesn&apos;t cover it.  Any true fast walker knows he has to constantly zig and zag through all types of people going all sorts of speeds and directions.</blockquote>
