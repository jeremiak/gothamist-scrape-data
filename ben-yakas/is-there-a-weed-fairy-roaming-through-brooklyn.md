<p>A few years ago, there <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504132752/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/01/mysterious_packages_of_pot_being_de.php">were several reports</a> around the tri-state area of people either finding or receiving mysterious packages of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504132752/http://gothamist.com/tags/weed">weed</a>. We logically credited these allegedly undesired pot deliveries to a mystical Marijuana Fairy, even though we know she is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504132752/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FoeQJCYsMY">just a children&apos;s tale.</a> But <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504132752/http://gawker.com/brooklyn-has-a-weed-fairy-1447739833">Gawker noticed</a> that a real person has actually taken on the mantle of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504132752/https://twitter.com/TheGardenBreath">The Weed Fairy</a>, and has been taping up posters around Brooklyn with a nug of weed attached. Is it too dank to be true?</p>

<p>The Twitter account written on the poster links to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504132752/https://twitter.com/TheGardenBreath">The Garden Breath</a>, who wrote a series of tweets promising that they are &quot;not promoting anything. I just want all of you to feel good,&quot; and that &quot;I&apos;m not Jimmy Kimmel.&quot; There was this mysterious tweet that popped up as well:</p>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504132752/https://twitter.com/pictureplane">@pictureplane</a> I hope that you enjoyed my lil&apos; gift to people last week. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504132752/https://twitter.com/search?q=%23thegardenbreath&amp;src=hash">#thegardenbreath</a></p>&#x2014; Yeni Sleidi (@GooProne) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504132752/https://twitter.com/GooProne/statuses/390956652821626881">October 17, 2013</a></blockquote>

<p>As you can see from the tweet below, The Weed Fairy is going out tonight, so keep your eyes peeled. As long as it doesn&apos;t turn out that this person &quot;owns&quot; a human-sized hamster wheel, we&apos;re willing to go along with this for now. Unless Krokodil becomes involved. There&apos;s nothing fun about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504132752/http://gothamist.com/tags/krokodil">Krokodil.</a></p>

Have a good Friday, everyone.</p>&#x2014; The Weed Fairy (@TheGardenBreath) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504132752/https://twitter.com/TheGardenBreath/statuses/391284259261935616">October 18, 2013</a></blockquote>
