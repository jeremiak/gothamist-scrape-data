<p>Last year, East Village residents were plagued by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150305071849/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/22/east_village_problems_ihop_bacon_sm.php">the succulent, suffocating, overwhelming smell of bacon</a> emanating from their local IHOP. It was finally snuffed out <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150305071849/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/06/ev_ihop_finally_defeats_suffocating.php">this past July</a> thanks to a $40,000 &quot;hog-smog&quot; industrial strength odor-eater. But it seems that even that hasn&apos;t helped too much: &#x201C;Then it was smells&#x2014;sometimes I smelled coffee, other people smelled bacon,&#x201D; local Rena Begleiter <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150305071849/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/union_sq_nabe_is_stinkin_mad_over_UpGo4Wwn0QP2SrjrCDFSjL?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Manhattan">told the Post</a> about the Union Square IHOP. &#x201C;They installed this behemoth to combat it, but the noise from that has been much worse.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Begleiter, an 86-year-old retired insurance broker who lives adjacent to the IHOP, said the air vent sound and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150305071849/http://gothamist.com/tags/bacon">bacon</a> smell have been bothering her for the last year, and it&apos;s just become too much for her. &#x201C;The one thing I always loved about my apartment was it was so quiet and peaceful, and we&#x2019;ll never have that again,&quot; she told them. &quot;The irony of it is I happen to have lost hearing in one ear. I&#x2019;m turning a deaf ear, but there&#x2019;s still that grinding noise.&#x201D; </p>

<p>Begleiter and about 100 other tenants in her building have bandied together to petition to get SOMETHING changed, at least get rid of the hog-eater: &#x201C;I&#x2019;m pissed,&#x201D; said Sandy Berger, who launched the petition effort. &#x201C;The community was never contacted.&#x201D; A Department of Buildings spokesman said that IHOP is &quot;going to have to relocate the equipment. If they fail to do so, we&#x2019;ll revoke their permit.&#x201D; Just don&apos;t hold your breath on it happening this week: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150305071849/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/04/breathe_easy_bacon-scented_ev_ihop.php">it took eight months</a> to just get the damn hog-smog machine installed. And of course, it&apos;s a vicious circle: once the machine is gone, the smell will be back.</p>
