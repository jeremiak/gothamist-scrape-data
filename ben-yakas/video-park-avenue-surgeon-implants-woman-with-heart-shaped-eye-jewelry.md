<p>There are very few things in this life that seem less appealing to us than having a heart-shaped piece of platinum jewelry implanted directly into our eye. But clearly it doesn&apos;t bother Kristina Kovalevskaya, the first woman in NY to undergo just such a procedure. Eye surgeon Dr. Emil Chynn of Park Avenue LASEK implanted the 3.5mm heart on the white of her right eyeball recently&#x2014;you can see a video about the procedure below, but BE WARNED, there is some graphic eye footage in it.</p>

<p>&quot;I&#x2019;m a person who likes extremes,&#x201D; Kovalevskaya, who spent $3,000 for the heart, says very understatedly in the video above. &quot;I want to keep it in my eye as long as possible. I like it, but I&#x2019;m planning to swap it out. I really want to try a new design. Every girl wants to try something new.&quot; Chynn claims the cosmetic procedure is completely safe, if inexplicable: &quot;It&apos;s a very thin piece of platinum that&apos;s designed for insertion on the top of the eye, it&apos;s not in the eye so there&apos;s no risk of blindness or anything at all,&quot; he said. &quot;She could have a little bit of local bleeding. That could go away in a couple days or couple weeks. She could have an infection but we&apos;ll prevent that with antibiotics.&quot;</p>

<p>The American Academy of Ophthalmology <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420054818/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2576742/Beauty-eye-beholder.html">is not quite as jazzed</a> about the procedure: they say there is not &quot;sufficient evidence to support the safety or therapeutic value of this procedure,&quot; and they urge people &quot;avoid placing in the eye any foreign body or material that is not approved by the FDA.&quot;</p>

<p>If you&apos;re a little less extreme, you could probably just get contacts to achieve a similar effect. But if you don&apos;t mind having your eye socket tenderly cut open, and perhaps some localized bleeding, sure, this sounds like a lovely conversation piece for parties. Maybe Chynn, who made the news last year when he offered free procedures to anyone who could get him a date, is using the procedure as a new means of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420054818/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/10/park_avenue_eye_surgeon_offers_free.php">meeting some Ivy league hotties</a>.</p>
