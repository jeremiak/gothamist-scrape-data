<p>A man claims he was drugged and raped by a male nurse&apos;s aide at a Staten Island hospital this past week. The 37-year-old victim, whose name hasn&apos;t been released, was recuperating from pneumonia at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130918061058/http://www.rumcsi.org/Main/Home.aspx">Richmond University Medical Center</a> when the alleged attack occurred on Wednesday. &#x201C;He asked one of the nurses to give me something to help me sleep,&#x201D; the victim <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130918061058/http://nypost.com/2013/09/15/hospital-patient-raped-by-male-nurses-aide-police/">told The Post</a>. &#x201C;He waited for it to take effect and then he told me to come to the bathroom.&#x2019;&#x2019;</p>

<p>The man thinks the aide had given him a dose of Benadryl. When the aide got him in the bathroom, he was pushed against a wall and sodomized. &#x201C;It happened quick,&quot; the patient added. &quot;I was too messed up on medication to do anything about it.&#x201D; The hospital said it suspended the suspect and is cooperating with the police investigation.</p>

<p>Back in 2010, a sonogram technician <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130918061058/http://gothamist.com/2010/01/13/hospital_worker_accused_of_raping_d.php">was charged with raping</a> a female patient while she was on a prescription drug similar to morphine.</p>
