<p>Philadelphia has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021130415/http://www.visitphilly.com/museums-attractions/philadelphia/the-rocky-statue-and-the-rocky-steps/">its Rocky</a>. St. Paul has its <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021130415/https://www.stpaul.gov/departments/parks-recreation/natural-resources/arts-gardens/public-art/peanuts-characters">Peanuts statues</a>. Detroit will get <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021130415/http://www.techinsider.io/robocop-statues-still-coming-to-detroit-2016-2">its RoboCop</a> eventually. Even Bottineau, North Dakota has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021130415/http://www.ndtourism.com/bottineau/family-fun/tommy-turtle-statue">its Tommy The Turtle.</a> And now NYC is joining the ranks of great American cities with iconic statues now that Prospect Park is getting one for Captain America.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021130415/http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/entertainthis/2016/07/05/exclusive-captain-america-75th-anniversary-bronze-statue/86699814/">USA Today reports</a> that a 13-foot-tall bronze statue of Steve Rogers will make its way to Prospect Park for an August 10th dedication ceremony this summer in honor of the superhero&apos;s 75th anniversary.  It&apos;ll make its debut at San Diego Comic-Con from July 20th-24th before heading to the city.</p>

<p>&quot;For the past 75 years, Captain America has inspired generations of fans serving as the ultimate global icon for freedom, strength and doing the right thing,&#x201D; says Paul Gitter, senior vice president of licensing for Marvel at Disney Consumer Products and Interactive Media. You can see a sketched design of the statue above.</p>

<p>As every comic book movie nerd already knows, the character of Steve Rogers hails from Brooklyn Heights, so this isn&apos;t a totally random thing. (HOWEVER, as any real comic book nerd knows, the character actually originally hailed from the Lower East Side, he just had his origin slightly retconned over the years, which is very normal for comic book characters.) The statue features the movie quote &quot;I&apos;m just a kid from Brooklyn&quot; from <em>Captain America: The First Avenger</em> to really hammer home the connection.</p>

<p>As for his pose, Glitter said it was &#x201C;symbolically chosen to showcase the impressive strength of Captain America and his stoic form. Captain America&#x2019;s signature shield also takes prominence, paying homage to his heroism, indestructible power and determination.&quot;</p>

<p>Parks and Prospect Park Alliance confirmed that Captain America will be coming to Prospect Park as a temporary installation this summer, coinciding with Borough President Adams&apos; &quot;A Summer Movie Under the Stars&quot; series. </p>

<p>In spiritually connected news, the directors of the last two Captain America movies, Joe and Anthony Russo, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021130415/http://deadline.com/2016/07/the-russo-brothers-cult-classic-gang-film-the-warriors-tv-paramount-hulu-1201782686/">announced today</a> that they are adapting <em>The Warriors</em> as a one-hour drama with Paramount TV and Hulu. If anyone other than the Russo Brothers were in charge of this, we&apos;d be groaning at the prospect of a remake of an objectively perfect film, but considering what they were able to do with giant comic book movies AND cult classic TV shows (<em>Community</em>, <em>Arrested Development</em>), we&apos;re ready to come out and play. </p>
