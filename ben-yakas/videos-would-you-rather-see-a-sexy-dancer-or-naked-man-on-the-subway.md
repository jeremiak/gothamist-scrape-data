<p>Judging by the amount of ketchup you spilled on those Red Box DVDs, it appears you stayed in this weekend. Surely you want to catch what you missed on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130813084721/http://gothamist.com/tags/subwayvideo">our beloved subways</a> late at night this weekends!</p>

<p>In the first SFW clip, a woman nonchalantly practices some dance moves in front of her fellow straphangers on the J train (the uploader identifies her as a stripper, but come on this is just gyration, does <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130813084721/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAXxkNaRkp8">ANYONE see anything wrong</a> with a little bump n&apos; grind?). </p>

<p>Then in the much more NSFW video below, police are called to a stopped 4 train at Union Square station where a half-naked man is lying across the seats&#x2014;he is forcibly removed from the train by cops. </p>
