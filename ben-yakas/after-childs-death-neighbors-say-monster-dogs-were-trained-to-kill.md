<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:450px; "> <img alt="2011_05_dogbo.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130223085949im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/2011_05_dogbo.jpg" width="450" height="317"> <br> <i>Jayelin Graham, right, and the dog who killed him</i></div> On Friday night, a four-year-old Brooklyn boy <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130223085949/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/28/pet_pit_bull_kills_four-year-old_in.php">was mauled to death</a> by his family&apos;s pet dog. And neighbors are now saying that the Cane Corso dubbed &quot;Machete&quot;, along with the family&apos;s other dogs, were trained to kill by Jayelin Graham&apos;s mother&apos;s boyfriend, Damian Jones: &quot;He would hang stuff on trees or the school yard fence - stuffed animals or footballs - just so his dogs could rip the stuff up. It was an accident waiting to happen,&quot; neighbor Robin Parkinson <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130223085949/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/dad_bragged_about_dog_that_killed_2G5pOCYHxJRYkz8XrGd7GN?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">told the Post</a>.<p></p>

<p>Parkinson said that Jones allegedly bragged about how he trained his dogs, which included a Pit Bull and a Husky mix in addition to the Cane Corso: &quot;I asked him what kind of dogs are those? &apos;Monster dogs&apos; [Jones replied]. He could clear the block with them dogs. He used to punch them in the heads, kick them in the ribs, brutal.&quot; Another neighbor who tried to save Jayelin from the dog <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130223085949/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2011/05/29/2011-05-29_mutant_mutt_was_trained_to_kill_by_owner.html?r=ny_local&amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm">told the News</a>, &quot;He was trained to kill. He had the boy by his throat. The dog was shaking him. He had no chance.&quot;</p>

<p>But Graham&apos;s mother, Saquina &quot;Honey&quot; Jubeark, absolved Jones of any responsibility: &quot;It was not my son&apos;s or [Jones&apos;] fault. The dog had showed no sign of aggression.&quot; She <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130223085949/http://www.ny1.com/content/top_stories/139951/ny1-exclusive--brooklyn-mom-breaks-silence-in-fatal-dog-attack">told NY1</a> she was devastated by the death, but she doesn&apos;t want to lose her three other kids: &quot;My kids know I love them, I&apos;m a good parent, I would understand if I were some mean parent...I didn&apos;t care about my kids. That was not the case. If I could take my son&apos;s place I would, and I can&apos;t. My baby is gone, there&apos;s nothing I can do.&quot;</p>

<p>Jubeark screamed in horror as the dog attacked her son in their apartment on Pacific Street in Brownsville just after 9 p.m. Friday, where police found Jayelin with bite wounds on his head, neck and torso. Family friend Ashley De La Cruz described the brutal attack to NY1: &quot;We seen what happened. The dog was over the baby. He wouldn&apos;t move, and Jaylen was just laying there...he was laying in a puddle of blood and they couldn&apos;t get the baby out.&quot; Another neighbor, &quot;Jah&quot;, said he shattered a window and tried to rescue the four-year-old: &quot;You could tell by the blood that he dragged the kid from the bedroom into the living room. I screamed move and the dog dropped the kid and went into a defensive position. He was staring at me. The baby was dead. The blood was down all around the abdomen.&quot;</p>

<p>Police say conditions inside the home were not good&#x2014;they found animal feces and urine inside. You can see a video taken from inside the home <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130223085949/http://www.wpix.com/news/wpix-dog-maul-dead-story,0,3496505.story">here</a>. Police sedated and removed the dog, as well a German shepherd. According <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130223085949/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/29/nyregion/boy-4-is-mauled-to-death-in-brooklyn.html?_r=2&amp;ref=nyregion">to the Times</a>, the Brooklyn district attorney&#x2019;s office and the city&#x2019;s health department were investigating the situation.</p>

<p>Graham&apos;s other family members were devastated by the attack: &quot;What a horrible way to die. I have a lot of frustrations, a lot of emotions, a lot of anger,&quot; said the boy&apos;s great-grandfather, Ameer Jamaal-Uddin. </p>
