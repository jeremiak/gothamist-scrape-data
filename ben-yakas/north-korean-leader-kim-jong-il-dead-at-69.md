<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506161558/https://twitter.com/#!/CNBC/status/148603226156040192">According to</a> the Wall Street Journal, North Korea State TV is saying that Kim Jong Un will lead North Korea; Jong Un, Jong Il&apos;s third son, who is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506161558/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/01/world/asia/a-year-on-north-koreas-dear-young-general-has-made-his-mark.html">thought to be in his late 20s</a>, was his designated successor. Kim Jong Il inherited power after his father, North Korean founder Kim Il Sung, died in 1994. Here are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506161558/http://www.businessinsider.com/kim-jong-un-2011-12?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed:+businessinsider+(Business+Insider)#he-was-born-on-january-8-in-1982-or-1983-1">ten things that are known</a> about Jong Un, including the fact he idolizes Michael Jordan and Arnold Schwarzenegger, speaks multiple languages, and has his own theme song.</p>

<p>Jong Il&apos;s life <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506161558/http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5iTw-88o2Asu7W4nBuctnIApFwgXQ?docId=c6dda027fa894a72a08da2f8494093f5">was shrouded in mystery and rumor</a>, especially when it came to his health. He was believed to have had diabetes and heart disease, and is also believed to have suffered a stroke in 2008. Despite becoming even more reclusive in the years after the stroke, he made sure to be photographed on trips to China and Russia looking healthy.</p>

<p>The BBC points out some of the contradictions and criticisms of Jong Il <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506161558/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-10745725">in this obituary</a>:</p>

<blockquote>The world&apos;s only hereditary communist ruler, he was criticised for flagrant human rights abuses and for threatening the stability of the region by pursuing a nuclear weapons programme and testing long-range missiles.

<p>...</p>

<p>He was said to have personally ordered the shooting down of a South Korean airliner in 1987.</p>

<p>The South Korean media portrayed him as a vain man, a playboy with a bouffant hairstyle and sporting platform shoes in order to appear taller.</p>

<p>Anecdotal evidence suggests he was not as stupid as his southern neighbours made out, though his over-fondness for food and drink was probably true.</p></blockquote><br>
