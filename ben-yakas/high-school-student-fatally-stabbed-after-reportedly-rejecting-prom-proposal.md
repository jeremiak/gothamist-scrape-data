<p>A teenage girl was fatally stabbed to death by a classmate after she reportedly rejected his prom proposal. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160312020315/http://blog.ctnews.com/connecticutpostings/2014/04/25/report-student-stabbed-at-law-high-in-milford/">According to police</a>, Maren Sanchez, 16, was fatally stabbed by a 16-year-old male classmate, whose name hasn&apos;t been released, just before 7 a.m. this morning at Jonathan Law High School in Milford, Connecticut. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160312020315/http://connecticut.news12.com/news/police-female-student-dies-after-stabbing-at-jonathan-law-high-school-in-milford-1.7824169?qr=1">Connecticut News 12 reports</a> that the male student had asked Maren to go to prom, and when she said no, &quot;he allegedly tried to strangle her, push her down the stairs and stab her in the throat.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There was blood on her neck. It was awful,&quot; 16-year-old Sam Garcia, a junior at the school, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160312020315/http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/chi-connecticut-high-school-stabbing-20140425,0,6826220.story">told Chicago Tribune</a>. &quot;I saw the girl lying on the stretcher when they took her out.&quot; The suspect was subdued by teachers immediately after the attack, and is in custody. No charges have been filed yet.</p>

<p>The school was locked down after the stabbing, and students were completely dismissed by 9 a.m. Police have not confirmed the incident&apos;s connection to a prom rejection: &quot;We&#x2019;ll get the bottom of it or how it happened or why it happened,&quot; said Milford police chief Keith Mello. The prom was scheduled for 7 p.m. tonight at the Vazanno&apos;s Four Seasons, but has been postponed.</p>

<p>Maren, who reportedly had a boyfriend, was junior class president at the school, and an active volunteer in the community: &quot;She was an athlete, she was in the National Honor Society. She helped out with other athletic teams. She was very well respected and liked,&quot; Superintendent of Schools Dr. Elizabeth Feser <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160312020315/http://www.courant.com/community/milford/hc-milford-school-stabbing-0426-20140425,0,3011040.story">told reporters.</a></p>
