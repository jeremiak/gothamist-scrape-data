<p>A woman survived after she was shoved onto the train tracks in front of an oncoming Metro-North train in Westchester earlier today. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131128060128/http://www.lohud.com/article/20130925/NEWS02/309250039/Woman-pushed-front-train-White-Plains-Metro-North-station-suspect-custody-video-">According to LoHud</a>, the victim, who is in her 20s, was shoved onto the tracks just after 11 a.m. this morning at the White Plains train station. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131128060128/http://nypost.com/2013/09/25/woman-survives-being-pushed-in-front-of-train/">The Post reports</a> the woman was struck by an empty northbound train, but she only sustained leg trauma during the incident. She was taken to Westchester County Medical Center, where she is in stable condition. Police also apprehended a homeless man in his late 30s; he is being interrogated by cops, but hasn&apos;t been charged yet.</p>

<p>This incident comes on a day when the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131128060128/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/25/con_ed_feeder_loss_suspends_metro_n.php">Metro North New Haven line was suspended</a> due to a broken high-voltage electricity feeder (and it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131128060128/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/25/con_ed_it_could_take_weeks_to_repai.php">may take weeks to fix</a>). &#x201C;We had a day already of heck, because the New Haven Line&#x2019;s been down and then this happens,&quot; said witness Gary Waxman, who complained about the increase in homeless people around the station. &quot;It&#x2019;s a tragedy. They have to get rid of the homeless people in front of the station here. It&#x2019;s a detriment.&#x201D;</p>
