<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150322045020/http://gothamist.com/tags/billdeblasio">Mayor de Blasio</a> has been in office for nearly three months, but you&apos;re not really Hizzoner until you&apos;re forced to wear an embarrassing costume: de Blasio was formally initiated by the press with a public round of humiliation at the annual <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150322045020/http://gothamist.com/tags/innercircle">Inner Circle</a> political roast last night. Highlights, if they may so generously be called that, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150322045020/http://www.newsday.com/news/new-york/bill-de-blasio-enlists-celebs-to-poke-fun-at-himself-at-show-1.7476621">included</a> a ventriloquist act with Steve Buscemi, grousing by Upper East Siders (they want a moat), snow removal and tardiness yuks, a round of Jeopardy with Al Sharpton, a <em>Honeymooners</em> sketch with his wife and Cynthia Nixon (topped off with a big dip and kiss), and de Blasio sporting a Dante wig to end the night. Check out some clips below.</p>

<p>Other sketches included Buscemi in character as Nucky Thompson interviewing for the post of czar of snow removal and enforcement; Nixon and Chirlane McCray poking fun at their &quot;experimental&quot; past; the mayor mocking his own approval ratings and Carmen Fari&#xF1;a&apos;s cluelessness; and a cameo from frenemy Al Roker.</p>

<p>Reviews were mixed&#x2014;but then again, who can really top <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150322045020/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/27/photos_mayor_bloomberg_shows_his_uh.php">Spider-Man Bloomberg</a> or drag Rudy Giuliani?</p>
