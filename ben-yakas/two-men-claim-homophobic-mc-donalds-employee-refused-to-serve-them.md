<p>It&apos;s hard enough justifying a trip to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150927065024/http://gothamist.com/tags/mcdonalds">McDonald&apos;s</a> when the McRibs are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150927065024/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/13/the_disgusting_depressing_truth_beh.php">saut&#xE9;ed in piglet tears</a>&#x2014;it&apos;s even harder when it&apos;s super sized with a side of rampant homophobia. Two Manhattan men are suing McDonald&apos;s claiming that an employee at the Hamilton Heights location mistakenly assumed they were gay, then refused to serve them because of it.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150927065024/http://nypost.com/2013/11/17/men-run-out-of-mcdonalds-with-homophobic-taunts-lawsuit/">According to the Post</a>, Willis Washington Jr. and Horace Stevenson III were at the McDonald&apos;s around 2:30 a.m. last December when the incident occurred. A fellow customer started things off by saying &#x201C;he had a problem with gay people and that the gay lifestyle was not what God wants.&#x201D; The men ignored him, but then the cashier joined in the homophobia and refused to serve them. </p>

<p>Washington and Stevenson then said they were pushed out of the store. Stevenson dialed 911 when the cashier &#x201C;actually handed one of the customers a metal pipe from behind the counter and motioned to him that he should hit plaintiffs with it.&quot; The two men fled the store, then returned when police arrived&#x2014;except they were blamed for the incident, and handcuffed. Charges were dropped against both men, who say they were &quot;severely humiliated, mentally anguished and emotionally and physically distressed.&quot; Which is how a lot of people feel after eating McDonald&apos;s. <br>
