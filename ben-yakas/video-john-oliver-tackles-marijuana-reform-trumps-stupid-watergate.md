<p>Last night <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170403185751/http://gothamist.com/tags/johnoliver">John Oliver</a> dove back into Trump&apos;s &quot;stupid Watergate,&quot; focusing on the controversial actions of House Intelligence Committee chairman Devin Nunes: &quot;Devin took what appears to be an unnecessary trip to tell what appears to be unimportant news to what may have been the source of the news itself,&quot; Oliver said. &quot;So what Nunes brought to light has turned out to be a bunch of smoke and mirrors as convoluted as it is pointless. Truly, it is the <em>Now You See Me</em> of revelations.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But wait, because Stupid Watergate found a way to get even stupider,&quot; he continued. &#x201C;Because the surveillance Nunes was studying concerned the Trump transition team, of which one member was, you guessed it, Devin f---ing Nunes.&quot; (Check out a longer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170403185751/http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2017/04/02/john-oliver-goes-off-on-devin-f-cking-nunes.html">transcription of the piece here</a>.)</p>

<p>For the main attraction, Oliver took a longer look at conflicting federal marijuana laws, how they contradict with the generally positive public sentiment toward the drug, and how they pose serious&#x2014;and legally devastating&#x2014;problems for even law-abiding citizens. &quot;Legal marijuana businesses have struggled to get bank accounts because at the federal level they are still seen as criminal enterprises, so if banks took their deposits, that could be considered money laundering. This has meant that the businesses have had to operate all-cash,&quot; Oliver explained, as but one example.</p>

<p>&quot;Listen, I&#x2019;m not saying there shouldn&#x2019;t be laws that place sensible restrictions on marijuana as there are with other substances,&quot; Oliver concluded. &quot;But our federal laws desperately need to be brought up to date.&quot;</p>
