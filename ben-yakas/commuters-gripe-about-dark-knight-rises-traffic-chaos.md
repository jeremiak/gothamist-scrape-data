<p>This weekend, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161342/http://gothamist.com/tags/thedarkknightrises"><em>The Dark Knight Rises</em></a> continued its filmic assault on NYC by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161342/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/12/the_dark_knight_rises_over_the_59th.php">taking over the upper span of the 59th Street Bridge</a>. Not everyone was thrilled to have Batman and Bane battling in their backyard though&#x2014;the filming caused massive traffic jams today. &#x201C;Right now I don&#x2019;t want to watch that movie,&#x201D; one driver <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161342/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2011/11/12/filming-for-the-dark-knight-rises-leads-to-heavy-traffic-near-ed-koch-queensboro-bridge/">complained to CBS.</a> &#x201C;It&#x2019;s getting outrageous here in New York. All their filming, all this ridiculous filming and we aren&#x2019;t getting anything for it,&#x201D; another driver said. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161342/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Batman-Movie-Queensboro-Bridge-Traffic-Delays-Closures-Concerned-Calls-133767938.html">According to NBC</a>, some people who didn&apos;t get the memo about the filming were as annoyed as they were worried there was a jumper at the bridge: &quot;People honestly believe it was a real person in a Batman costume suspended on the bridge, and we had to try to assure the public -- no, it was the movie shoot,&quot; said a woman who answered phones at the 108th Precinct. &quot;And it had been advertised on the radio, on the news.&quot;</p>

<p>Below, you can check out a couple videos of the <em>Dark Knight</em> crew filming on the bridge:</p>
