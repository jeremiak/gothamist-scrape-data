<p>Earlier this week, candy shop enthusiast 50 Cent was tasked with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425231425/http://gothamist.com/2014/05/28/video_50_cent_throws_the_worst_firs.php">throwing the ceremonial first pitch</a> at a Mets/Pirates game. It turned out to be the single worst ceremonial first pitch in the long history of terrible ceremonial pitches&#x2014;this is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425231425/http://knowmore.washingtonpost.com/2014/05/29/this-chart-suggests-that-50-cents-first-pitch-was-indeed-the-worst-ever/">a scientific fact</a>. The pitch was so bad, 50 Cent told Good Morning America that he was pulled over by some cops who just wanted to make fun of him.</p>

<p>&quot;You know what, I actually got pulled over by New York City Police,&quot; he said this morning. &quot;They pulled me over in my car. He pulled me over and I said &apos;I got my license,&apos; right because I was a little nervous, as soon as he pulled me over, I was like &apos;what&apos;d I do?&apos; <strong>And then he said, &apos;you know that pitch was terrible.&apos;... He didn&apos;t give me a ticket, nothing. He said, &quot;I don&apos;t want to mess up your day because you made me laugh.&apos;&quot;</strong></p>

<p>But sweaty hands and sloppy aim isn&apos;t enough of an explanation for some people: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425231425/http://www.ibtimes.com/was-50-cents-awful-first-pitch-pr-stunt-blooper-corresponds-new-album-animal-ambition-1591467">International Business Times</a> and the NY Post think that the slip-up was a purposeful PR stunt to drum up attention for 50 Cent&apos;s new album. &quot;He did it so he would get all the press,&quot; an insider <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425231425/http://pagesix.com/2014/05/30/50-cents-botched-first-pitch-a-publicity-stunt/?utm_campaign=SocialFlow&amp;utm_source=P6Twitter&amp;utm_medium=SocialFlow">told the Post</a>. &quot;He&#x2019;s got a new album coming out, a new TV show on Starz and he wants to launch a tour.&quot; Of course, an &quot;insider&quot; could just refer to someone who stays indoors a lot, so we&apos;ll take the Post&apos;s sources with a grain of salt.</p>

<p>Anyway, while we all mull over how real real life really is, let&apos;s wind back to the days when an artist could be respected for his corny sexual metaphors, and not his terrible throwing arm:</p>
