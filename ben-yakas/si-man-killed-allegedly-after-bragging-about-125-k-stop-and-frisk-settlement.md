<p>A Staten Island man <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140226194657/http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2014/01/police_id_homicide_victims.html">was fatally shot</a> yesterday, allegedly after he bragged about a $125K stop-and-frisk case settlement. Kenrick Gray, 34, was fatally shot in the head around 6:15 p.m. last night in Stapleton in what police are calling a botched robbery. A second victim, 41-year-old Noland Whistleton, was shot in the leg, and also killed. </p>

<p>Gray was falsely stopped-and-frisked and arrested by NYPD officer Michael Daragjati in April 2011. Daragjati, who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140226194657/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/17/staten_island_cop_arrested_allegedl_1.php">was also caught on tape</a> boasting that he had &quot;fried another n----,&quot; was eventually <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140226194657/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/23/staten_island_cop_sentenced_to_57_m.php">sentenced to 57 months in jail.</a> Gray, who had 22 prior arrests, mostly for drugs, received a $132,500 settlement, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140226194657/http://nypost.com/2014/01/22/drug-dealer-slain-after-bragging-about-125k-stop-frisk-court-win/">sources tell the Post</a> that is why he was targeted.</p>

<p>&quot;Mr. Gray recently made known throughout hood that he received the windfall and that very foolish boast did cost him his life,&quot; their source said. &quot;He has been running his mouth about getting the settlement and apparently the assailant caught wind of that and tried to rob him. There was a struggle and he was shot.&quot; Darren Brown, 27, has been taken into custody in connection with the shooting, but no charges have been filed yet.<br>
