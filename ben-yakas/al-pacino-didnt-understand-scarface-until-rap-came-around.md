<p>This week, actor <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507075855/http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/filmblog/2011/aug/22/sean-penn-tree-of-life">Sean Penn confessed</a> that he didn&apos;t entirely <em>get</em> the Terrance Malick-helmed movie he starred in, <em>Tree of Life</em>... but may he just needs to look at the movie through other people&apos;s eyes! It seems that&apos;s just what <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507075855/http://gothamist.com/tags/alpacino">Al Pacino</a> needed to appreciate his 1983 blockbuster <em>Scarface</em>: &quot;The hip-hop people and the rappers got together and they made a video and they talked about the movie. <strong>I don&apos;t think anybody&apos;s ever talked about it as articulately and clearly. I understood it better having heard them talk about it</strong>,&quot; Pacino <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507075855/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1669640/al-pacino-scarface-hip-hop.jhtml">told MTV News</a> at a &quot;Scarface&quot; Blu-ray release party on Tuesday night.</p>

<p>Pacino was referring to the 2003 documentary <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507075855/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0395694/">&quot;Scarface: Origins of a Hip-Hop Classic,&quot;</a> in which rapper such as Diddy, Nas, Method Man, Raekwon, Ghostface Killah and Snoop Dogg pay tribute to the film, and analyze its impact on them. Pacino gave credit to those rappers for making the movie into the lasting cultural phenomenon it is today: &quot;I mean, they really get it and they understand it, and that&apos;s a great thing. They&apos;ve been very supportive all these years. I think they&apos;ve helped us tremendously,&quot; he said. Hopefully Pacino won&apos;t need anyone to help him appreciate his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507075855/http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2011/08/post_35.html">Phil Spector wig</a>.</p>
