<p>Despite his reputation as the cooking world&apos;s Han Solo, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002040822/http://gothamist.com/tags/anthonybourdain">Anthony Bourdain</a> loves a lot of things in this world, including <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002040822/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/19/watch_anthony_bourdain_and_eric_rip.php">day drinking</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002040822/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/20/would_anthony_bourdain_eat_human_fl.php">human flesh</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002040822/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/06/video_the_big_gay_ice_cream_shop_op.php">gay ice cream</a>, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002040822/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/07/anthony_bourdain_lets_it_all_hang_o.php">letting it all hang out.</a> But it seems he&apos;s not fan of New Yorkers&apos; favorite fratvomit holiday, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002040822/http://gothamist.com/tags/santacon">SantaCon</a>. As you can see from the tweets below, he hates it so much, he invokes his nemesis Guy Fieri&apos;s name.</p>
