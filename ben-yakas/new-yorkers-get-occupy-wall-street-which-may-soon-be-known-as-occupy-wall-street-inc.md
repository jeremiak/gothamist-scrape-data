<p>Another week, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111030170735/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/17/poll_new_york_city_approves_of_occu.php">another poll</a> which suggests that a majority of New Yorkers agree with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111030170735/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/21/schoolkids_field_tripping_to_occupy.php">schoolchildren</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111030170735/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/21/is_occupy_wall_street_is_nycs_new_a.php">tourists</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111030170735/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/13/photos_al_gore_comes_out_in_support.php#photo-1">Al Gore</a> in supporting <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111030170735/http://gothamist.com/tags/occupywallstreet">Occupy Wall Street</a>&#x2014;and even those who don&apos;t support it are understanding OWS&apos;s message. According <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111030170735/http://www.quinnipiac.edu/x1318.xml?ReleaseID=1668">to the new Quinnipiac poll</a>, 58 - 28 percent agree with the views of the Wall Street protesters, and 60 percent understand the protesters&apos; views &quot;fairly well&quot; or &quot;very well.&quot; &quot;Most New Yorkers, even upstaters and suburban voters, say they get the Wall Street protesters&apos; message,&quot; Carroll said. &quot;And by 2-1, voters agree with the complaints about bankers and Wall Streeters,&quot; said Maurice Carroll, director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute. </p>

<p>An overwhelming four out of five voters support the protesters&apos; right to demonstrate. Carroll added that, &quot;There&apos;s wide approval for the one specific message that&apos;s being heard Downtown&#x2014;support for a continued state &apos;Millionaire&apos;s Tax.&apos;&quot; Of course, these are very similar results to Quinnipiac&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111030170735/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/17/poll_new_york_city_approves_of_occu.php">last poll</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111030170735/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/13/photos_al_gore_comes_out_in_support.php#photo-1">Reuters/Ipsos&apos;s poll</a> the week before that. The poll doesn&apos;t mention whether this means voters support a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111030170735/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/26/fox_news_alleges_acorn-led_occupy_w.php">ACORN-controlled socialist cabal</a>, but it likely means voters agree that James O&apos;Keefe dresses like Ringo Starr.</p>

<p>Of course, you might be referring to OWS as Occupy Wall Street Inc. very soon: in the wake of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111030170735/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/23/finances_causing_strife_at_occupy_w.php">increasing internal criticism</a> (particular from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111030170735/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/21/drummers_at_occupy_wall_street_dema.php">those drummers!</a>), the Finance Committee branch of OWS <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111030170735/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970203687504577000320434317092.html?mod=googlenews_wsj">has been meeting with lawyers and accountants</a> to get a handle on donations and spending. As a result, they may need to incorporate and apply for 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status, which may result in serious changes for the leaderless movement&#x2014;including naming leaders. &quot;We want accountability. It&apos;s a challenge every time to vote when we want to move a tent or take out the trash,&quot; said Brooklyn artist/writer Chris Cobb, who has been helping plan the movements next big event: Occupalooza.</p>
