<p>After turning over <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021172440/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/14/john_oliver_president_trump.php">its episode last week</a> to sifting through the ashes of 2016, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021172440/http://gothamist.com/tags/lastweektonight"><em>Last Week Tonight</em></a> is done for the year&#x2014;but John Oliver isn&apos;t going anywhere, as he told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021172440/http://gothamist.com/tags/stephencolbert">Stephen Colbert</a> this weekend during a post-election conversation between the two that turned into something the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021172440/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/21/arts/stephen-colbert-john-oliver-trump-live-conversation.html?src=twr&amp;smid=tw-nytimes&amp;smtyp=cur&amp;_r=0">Times described</a> as a &quot;group-therapy session.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The danger of &apos;just live your lives, and the sun will come out tomorrow&apos; is, that&#x2019;s true for some people, so it&#x2019;s very easy to forget that it&#x2019;s very much not for others,&quot; Oliver said, according <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021172440/http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2016/11/john-oliver-donald-trump-stephen-colbert?mbid=social_twitter">to Vanity Fair.</a> &quot;That&#x2019;s the danger. If you&#x2019;re lucky enough that your life can become routine, it&#x2019;s easy to not feel the hurt of those whose routine is going to be shattered. Not everyone is going to be okay. So it&#x2019;s incumbent upon all of us to remember that.&quot;</p>

<p>The event, a fundraiser for the Montclair Film Festival, had been booked weeks in advance, and was called, &quot;Wow, That Was Weird: A Post-Election Evening With Stephen Colbert and John Oliver.&quot; (Colbert resides in Montclair, and his wife is president of the board of the festival.) The lightheartedness of the title was belied by the seriousness of what&apos;s happened in the days since the election, and neither comedian minced words about their immediate fears.</p>

<p>&quot;I&#x2019;m all for &#x2018;give him a chance,&#x2019; but don&#x2019;t give him an inch,&quot; Colbert said <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021172440/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/21/arts/stephen-colbert-john-oliver-trump-live-conversation.html?src=twr&amp;smid=tw-nytimes&amp;smtyp=cur">at one point</a>. &quot;I believe everything he said and I remember everything he said, and it&apos;s horrifying.&quot;</p>

<p>Colbert <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021172440/http://www.rawstory.com/2016/11/this-is-horrifying-john-oliver-and-stephen-colbert-reflect-on-trump-presidency-at-new-jersey-benefit/">continued</a>, &quot;Everyone tried to stop him and they didn&apos;t. He owes them nothing. He goes on a balcony and he says to the crowd, &apos;Shall I do it?&apos; And they say, &apos;Yes. It shall be so.&apos; And the balcony is Twitter&#x2014;that&apos;s the balcony for him.. and that&apos;s what scares me, is that he owes the checks and balances of Washington nothing because they tried to stop him and they couldn&apos;t. He&apos;s a vindictive person. So it&apos;s all going to be fine.&quot;</p>

<p>The two discussed the difficulty of writing jokes about this particular campaign: &quot;You try and take things of substance and then put some sugar on it to make it palatable,&quot; Oliver explained. &quot;But there was so little of substance, this whole campaign, it&#x2019;s just like a diabetes-inducing amount of sugar.&quot; </p>

<p>They talked about their annoyance at the rise of &quot;fake news&quot; stories, and how it&apos;s different from what they did at The Daily Show (&quot;The fact that they call this stuff fake news upsets me, because this is just lying,&quot; Colbert said), their feelings on Trump&apos;s sense of humor or lack-thereof (&quot;I don&apos;t think he&apos;s funny, I think he&apos;s mean,&quot; said Colbert; &quot;I&#x2019;m sure he can take a joke,&quot; Oliver said, &quot;No, we know that&#x2019;s not true, either.&quot;), ideological bubbles in the media (&quot;I don&#x2019;t know what the word means, &#x2018;echo chamber,&#x2019; Colbert said. &quot;Am I supposed to not value criticism and science?&#x201D;) and Colbert&apos;s bizarre election night Showtime special which turned into a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021172440/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/09/video_stephen_colberts_election_spe.php">real-time horror documentary</a> as the results came in.</p>

<p>&quot;My audience was sobbing openly,&quot; Colbert said, calling the special &quot;the hardest thing I&#x2019;ve ever done in my professional life.&quot; He added that because there were lots of prepared bits that had been done assuming Hillary Clinton would win, there are &quot;two and a half whole shows of material&quot; we&apos;ll never see.</p>

<p>Oliver said he tried watching the special that night as well: &quot;I turned on Showtime like 11:02 and I saw your face and seven seconds later I&apos;m like, &apos;Nah ...&apos;&quot;</p>
