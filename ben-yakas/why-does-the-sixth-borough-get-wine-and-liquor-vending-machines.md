title: Why Does The Sixth Borough Get Wine AND Liquor Vending Machines?

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:250px; "> <img alt="4221winekiosk.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110515091236im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/4221winekiosk.jpg" width="250" height="167"> <br> <i>AP</i></div> It was bad enough when Pennsylvania got its first self-serve wine kiosks <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110515091236/http://www.lehighvalleylive.com/breaking-news/index.ssf/2010/06/pennsylvania_liquor_control_bo_1.html">last year</a>, with thousands of bottles available at the click of a button in grocery stores. But now, they&apos;ve gone too far: the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board is on the verge of approving a pilot program <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110515091236/http://www.lehighvalleylive.com/breaking-news/index.ssf/2011/04/pennsylvania_to_test_liquor_sa.html">to sell</a> hard liquor out of those wine vending kiosks. Why is the sixth borough at the cutting edge of alco-vending machine technology???<p></p>

<p>The machines require buyers to swipe their identification and breathe into a sensor to make sure they&apos;re old enough and sober enough to purchase alcohol. But while they&apos;re on the cusp of getting all sorts of liquor in their stores, we haven&apos;t even been able to get approval to sell wine in grocery stores! We came <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110515091236/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/29/wine.php">ever so close</a> last year, when former Gov. David Paterson supported the move as a means to raise revenue for our depleted deficit, but it still didn&apos;t pass. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110515091236/http://www.observer.com/2010/real-estate/whine-about-wine-grocery-stores">Big Liquor</a> is just too powerful a lobby in NYS! Instead, we just have to keep ourselves contented with desperate 4 a.m. trips to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110515091236/http://gothamist.com/2009/11/04/wine_not_7-eleven_to_start_selling.php">7-Eleven</a> to get our wine fix. </p>
