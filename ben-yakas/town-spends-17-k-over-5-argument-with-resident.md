<p>The town of Bridgewater, NJ went to great lengths to prove that stubbornness isn&apos;t a character flaw, but rather a costly reward unto itself, after they ended up in a fight with one resident over a $5 fee for a CD. Tom Coulter <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171101193204/http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2010/12/bridgewater_spends_17k_to_defe.html">filed a complaint</a> with the New Jersey Government Record Council in October 2008 arguing that he should pay the actual cost of the CD, 96 cents, to get a recording of a council meeting, not the $5 he was charged. The state council agreed recently; altogether, the town of Bridgewater paid more than $14,000 in legal fees defending the case, and had to pay $3,500 to Coulter for his legal fees. Adding insult to injury, the town had to give him a $4.04 refund too.</p>
