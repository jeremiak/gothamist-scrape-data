										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:300px; "> <img alt="51811kelly.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430235925im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/51811kelly.jpg" width="300" height="187"> <br> <i>AP</i></div> Because the NYPD couldn&apos;t handle the rigorous task of tracking their own tickets and summonses as is, leading to a wide-scale investigation into a massive <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430235925/http://gothamist.com/tags/ticketfixingscheme">ticket-fixing scheme</a>, NYPD Commissioner Ray Kelly announced a new unit <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430235925/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2011/05/18/2011-05-18_nypd_creates_new_unit_that_will_stop_cops_from_fixing_tickets_in_court_commissio.html">specifically dedicated</a> to preventing cops from fixing tickets. We like Kelly&apos;s new motto: when you&apos;ve been caught with your pants down, form a new NYPD unit to investigate who pantsed you...especially if it turns out you pantsed yourself. So much for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430235925/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/20/oh_duh_ticket-fixing_has_always_exi.php">common courtesies</a>. <p></p>

<p>&quot;In response to disturbing indications that some police officers failed to appear or otherwise willfully undermined a case in court, we are creating a new Court Monitoring Unit within the Internal Affairs Bureau,&quot; Kelly told City Council. More than 400 cops could be facing disciplinary charges in the massive ticket-fixing probe; in the course of that investigation, officials have uncovered other more serious crimes captured on wiretaps, including conversations in which cops arranged to meet and pay for dates <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430235925/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/15/ticket-fixing_probe_reveals_cops_ho.php">with hookers</a>, as well as officers who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430235925/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/11/a_surefire_way_for_a_cop_to_get_fre.php">accepted bribes</a>. &quot;We&#x2019;re committed to ensuring integrity at every turn. That&#x2019;s why we&#x2019;re bolstering IAB&#x2019;s staff to give this new unit the resources it needs to pursue any sign of manipulation of the system,&quot; Kelly said today.</p>

<p>Kelly has formed at least two other reactionary units in the last few years to combat/investigate internal police corruption&#x2014;there is the special IAB unit <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430235925/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/02/tow_truck_operator_says_cop_gave_hi.php">dedicated to</a> cracking down on parking placard abusers and unmarked police vehicles; and in January, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430235925/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/05/kelly_forms_panel_to_explore_stat_m.php">he created</a> a panel to explore stat manipulation allegations, which was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430235925/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/06/haters_question_motives_behind_kell.php">widely criticized</a>.</p>

<p>Kelly&apos;s new IAB unit will work separately from the probe current going-on investigating the allegations. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430235925/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/nypd_forming_unit_to_deal_with_ticket_YzltXysz23z8QJVuUz9slM?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">He reiterated</a> what Mayor Bloomberg said <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430235925/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/22/mayor_bloomberg_defends_ticket-fixi.php">last month</a> about the new electronic system to track tickets: &quot;It allows tickets to be scanned into a centralized database. This ensures proper tracking and makes it more difficult, if not impossible to misdirect or hide a summons,&quot; he said. Of course, someone should probably mention that to the cops who&apos;ve figured out new ways to beat <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430235925/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/24/cops_figured_out_ways_to_beat_elect.php">the new system.</a></p>
