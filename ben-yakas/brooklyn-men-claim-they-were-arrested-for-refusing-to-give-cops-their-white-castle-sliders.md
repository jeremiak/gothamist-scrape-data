<p>If you already love <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150221180618/http://gothamist.com/tags/whitecastle">White Castle</a>, then you probably <em>really</em> love White Castle&#x2014;the cult around the burger-slinging chain extends from movie franchises to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150221180618/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/15/video_inside_white_castles_valentin.php">Valentine&apos;s Day specials</a> to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150221180618/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/05/white_castle_now_in_scented_candle.php">scented candles.</a> Two Brooklyn men claim that the power of White Castle is so overwhelming, it led to cops arresting them when they refused to hand over their sliders to them.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150221180618/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/brooklyn-men-sue-nypd-white-castle-article-1.1722336">Brooklyn residents Danny Maisonet and Kenneth Glover say that</a> they procured White Castle meals on Halloween 2012 (just after Hurricane Sandy) when they ran into cops who were rounding up a group of men suspected of looting a supermarket on Neptune Avenue. The cops allegedly demanded their food (the Daily News notes: &quot;it&#x2019;s unclear if they were kidding or starved out of their minds&quot;), and Maisonet and Glover obviously refused.</p>

<p>It&apos;s unclear exactly how things escalated, but the two men claim they were then struck with flashlights by the officers, handcuffed, and charged with obstructing government administration and disorderly conduct. Officer Angelo Pizzarro wrote in the complaint that Glover and Maisonet were standing in his way and forced him to walk around them while dealing with the alleged looters, and we all know how hard walking around objects or people can be. Shockingly, all the charges against them were ultimately dismissed.</p>

<p>This would have never happened if the two men had gotten a craving for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150221180618/http://gothamist.com/tags/sbarro">Sbarro.</a></p>
