And yet Dr. Boris Sachakov, the Picasso of proctology, was arrested yesterday and charged with $3.5 million in Medicare fraud, stemming from the <em>6,593 hemorrhoidectomies</em> and other procedures he performed in a year long period, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170830042833/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/09/23/2010-09-23_backside_doc_is_slapped_by_feds_hes_nabbed_in_medicare_fraud.html">according to the Daily News.</a></p>

<p>Sachakov, who performed his art at the Colon and Rectal Care of New York in Brighton Beach, was a tireless solo practitioner who fought for his patients&#x2014;he claims to have performed 85 hemorrhoidectomies worth $60,020 in bills <em>on one patient alone in a 20 month period</em>. But who are we to question genius? According to his billings, he occasionally was forced to perform for more than 24-hours straight. But this is because he was so dedicated to his true calling!</p>

<p>It was between February 2009 and January 2010 that he truly ascended to the next level, allegedly performing 6,593 procedures in that blindingly brief period; the next busiest proctology clinic in the country during that time billed Medicare for a mere 381 procedures&#x2014;because they recognized they&apos;d never have the gifts that Sachakov had! Sachakov, 41, faces ten years in prison if convicted of the Medicare fraud, but the greater damage would be to our society; the loss of such an artist would be profound, and deeply felt in the bowel of our collective souls.</p>
