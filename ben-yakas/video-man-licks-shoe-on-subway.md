<p>We already know that most people <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508212500/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/22/should_eating_on_the_subway_be_outl.php">don&apos;t approve</a> of eating on the subway, but this...this is different, to say the least. A tipster sent us the video below, which shows a man furiously licking his shoe on the 5 train last Wednesday around 9:30 p.m. Take a look:</p>

<p>You can read a poem written by the video uploader about the shoe licker <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508212500/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-1lao5UUac&amp;feature=youtu.be">here.</a> This video certainly makes the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508212500/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/18/video_subway_spaghetti_spat_sparks.php">subway spaghetti spat</a> from last month seem practically normal in comparison. Maybe he&apos;s trying to get to the shoe&apos;s delicious tootsie roll center? We suppose we&apos;re just glad he wasn&apos;t trying to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508212500/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rd6rUo7Htso">eat it</a>.</p>
