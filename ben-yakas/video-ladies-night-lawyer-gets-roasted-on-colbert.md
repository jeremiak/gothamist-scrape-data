                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="4111hollander.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20131129114443im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/4111hollander.jpg" width="640" height="434" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>Anti-feminist lawyer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131129114443/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/14/bizarrely_sexist_lawyer_losing_war.php">Roy Den Hollander</a> has been waging a not-so-silent war against Ladies&apos; Nights for the last <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131129114443/http://gothamist.com/2007/12/17/its_ladies_nigh.php">few years</a>, fighting what he calls the systematic destruction of society caused by bars giving free or reduced admission to women. Last September, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131129114443/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/01/ladies_nights_ruled_legal_sexist.php">court ruled</a> that Hollander was unable to prove clubs broke discrimination laws by attracting ladies with cheaper drinks, which only enraged him more. And last night, he was featured on The Colbert Report for his &quot;Difference Makers&quot; segment. In the clip, he rails against feminists, and admits he may be suffering from PMS: Persecuted Male Syndrome. Watch the video below (including some great footage of his &quot;hip hop dancing&quot;):</p>

<p>Even if he can&apos;t get 100,000 armed guys to protest with him, Hollander promises: &quot;I&apos;m going to fight the feminists until my last dollar, my last breath, and if there&apos;s anything after death, I will fight them for eternity.&quot; Our favorite detail about the lawyer provocateur: his ex-wife was a Russian mafia prostitute who used to be mistress to a Chechnyan warlord!</p>
