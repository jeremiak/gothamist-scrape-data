<p>After the Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame Ceremony finished up last night at Barclays Center (more on that soon!), the surviving members of Nirvana&#x2014;Dave Grohl, Pat Smear, and Krist Novoselic&#x2014;headed over to the 350-capacity Saint Vitus venue in Greenpoint to play a secret show around 2:30 a.m. They brought along many of the same performers who joined them at Barclays, including Annie Clark (of St. Vincent), Joan Jett, Kim Gordon, J Mascis (of Dino Jr.) and John McCauley (of Deer Tick) to perform a 16-song set. Check out a few clips below.</p>

<blockquote>Everyone was seemingly zonked out of their minds at the venue, including a teetering Annie Clark and a giggly crowd pogoing along to the Seattle band&apos;s classic output. I joined, and tried my best not to slam into Mascis, Carrie Brownstein, Butch Vig, Jack Endino, and countless others as I maneuvered around the venue. I did OK, but was too knee deep in whiskey to really take score. 

<p>Hands down the best moments go to mega-ripper J Mascis, who tore through &quot;School&quot; and &quot;Penny Royal Tea,&quot; solos and all. What a fucking guitar god. Kim&apos;s vocal only performance of &quot;Aneurysm&quot; was similarly badass and inspired.</p>

<p>In all, an insane evening that I never thought I would ever see in my lifetime&#x2014;the members of Nirvana reforming to play their old favorites. It was all a big, whiskey-soaked dream. Shit this cool doesn&apos;t happen in real life, does it? </p></blockquote><p></p>
