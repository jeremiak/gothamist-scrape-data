<p>Here is the latest reminder that nothing you see on the internet is real: earlier this week, radio station K-98.3 posted photos of a 7-year-old&apos;s birthday invitation, upon which one mother declined to let her son attend citing her disapproval of the &#x201C;lifestyle&#x201D; of the birthday girl&apos;s gay parents. Well, the whole thing was a hoax by DJs Steve Harper and Leeana Karlson, who finally copped to the whole thing in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427162022/http://www.k983.com/morning-show/2014/02/14/a-message-from-steve-leeana">an apology letter to listeners</a>: &quot;We were attempting to spur a healthy discourse on a highly passionate topic, but we made a mistake by misleading our listeners into thinking that this specific situation actually existed.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Tommy will NOT attend,&quot; the fake mom wrote on the fake birthday invitation to the fake gay dads who had invited her fake son to a fake &quot;tie dye party.&quot; The fake mother explained the rationale behind her fake decision: &quot;I do not believe in what you do and will not subject my innocent son to your &#x2018;lifestyle.&apos; I&#x2019;m sorry Sophia has to grow up this way. If you have an issue or need to speak to me [redacted].&quot; </p>

<p>But none of this was real, rather a way for some wannabe Long Island shock jocks to spark a national conversation about same-sex households and gay parenting and tie dye party etiquette, because radio is at the cutting edge of social media discourse these days. The last time a radio prank was cutting edge <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427162022/http://www.ibtimes.com/war-worlds-radio-broadcast-turns-75-listen-orson-welles-famous-hoax-1447470">was circa 1938.</a></p>

<p>Here&apos;s their full apology:</p>

<blockquote>Dear K-98.3 Listeners,
<br><br>
On Wednesday, we told you the story of Sophia&apos;s birthday party, and one parent&apos;s objection to the same-sex household of Sophia&apos;s parents.  We also posted the invitation on our Facebook page, and invited comments from our followers.
<br><br>
This story was, in fact, totally fictitious, and created by the two of us.  This was done without the knowledge of K-98.3 management or ownership.
<br><br>
We were attempting to spur a healthy discourse on a highly passionate topic, but we made a mistake by misleading our listeners into thinking that this specific situation actually existed.
<br><br>
We are very sorry that we perpetuated this falsehood, even after it was clear that it had taken on a &apos;life of its own.&apos;  We deeply apologize for violating your trust, and we will work hard to regain that trust.
<br><br>
Sincerely, 
<br><br>
Steve &amp; Leeana</blockquote>

<p>The original <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427162022/https://www.facebook.com/KJOY98.3">Facebook posts</a> have since been deleted, and Steven and Leeana&apos;s individual Facebook page seems to have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427162022/https://www.facebook.com/steveandleeana&#x200E;">disappeared completely.</a> So let this be a lesson: never trust a radio personality unless they work for an NPR affiliate. </p>
