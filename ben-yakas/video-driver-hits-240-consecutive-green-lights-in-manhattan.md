<p>Over two years ago, after we wrote about a driver who hit <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171012072216/http://gothamist.com/2014/03/01/video_the_zen_pleasure_of_hitting_5.php">55 consecutive green lights</a> in a row, taxi driver Noah Forman took it upon himself to best that record. He ended up <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171012072216/http://gothamist.com/2014/03/29/video_taxi_driver_hits_over_100_con.php">hitting over 100 lights in a row</a>. But Forman isn&apos;t one to rest on his laurels and sleepdrive (wait, that sounds like a bad idea) through life. Instead, he decided to break his own record earlier this month, and hit over 240 green lights in a row in Manhattan.</p>

<p>You can watch his highlight reel from the drive, which took place on December 3rd, below.</p>

</p><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171012072216/https://vimeo.com/196039784">NOAH 240</a> from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171012072216/https://vimeo.com/shawnswetsky">Shawn Swetsky - Post Production</a> on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171012072216/https://vimeo.com/">Vimeo</a>.</p><p></p>

<p>Forman, who has now started driving a TLC black car for rideshare companies like Uber, told us that after the 100+ video, he tried to get up to 200 lights in a row. &quot;But I wasn&apos;t satisfied with that number, these two years have gone by and much has changed, people are driving slower, stopping in random places, crossing four lanes of traffic,&quot; he said. &quot;More trucks are out at night, a lot more uber cars are on the road...I was hoping to push my goal up to a large number like 500 green lights, but I&apos;ll settle for this: no stopping, smooth, well mostly smooth sailing, for an estimated 240 lights, one yellow, all the rest green.&quot;</p>

<p>If, for some reason, you really want to watch his entire ride in real time, go ahead and spend 26 minutes inside Forman&apos;s car below.</p>

<p><em>N.B.: This is not an endorsement of speeding or rushing to make a green light. Nobody should challenge themselves <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171012072216/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/30/video_driver_claims_record_for_fast.php">to speed around the city</a>&#x2014;but as Sonic Youth once put it, feel free to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171012072216/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKCNF9Yo6ZA">kneel before the green light</a>.</em></p>
