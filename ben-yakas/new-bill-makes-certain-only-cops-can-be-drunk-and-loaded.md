<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:240px; "> <img alt="91610drunkcop.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120605124810im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/91610drunkcop.jpg" width="240" height="192"> <br> <i>Gun rights sold separately </i></div> Hey all you cops, with your uniforms and your billy clubs and your fancy tasers: you like to go out for a drink after your shift, have a little taste, we get that. Sometimes you bring your gun with you. Well, you&apos;re officially on notice: those days of getting plastered and crawling across the bar floor shooting at the mice and the dust are numbered, thanks to a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120605124810/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/09/16/2010-09-16_drunk_and_packing_ok_if_youre_a_cop.html">new bill that won&apos;t allow you to drink and carry a weapon.</a><p></p>

<p>Or not. The new bill, which aired at a City Council meeting on Wednesday, would subject licensed gun owners to a possible year in jail and $10,000 fine if they&apos;re over the limit and armed&#x2014;except for cops. State law prevents the city from including on-duty or off-duty cops in the measure, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120605124810/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/09/16/2010-09-16_drunk_and_packing_ok_if_youre_a_cop.html">according to</a> Public Safety Committee Chairman Peter Vallone Jr. Mayor Bloomberg tried to get a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120605124810/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/15/carrying_gun_while_drunk_not_a_good.php">similar bill</a> passed earlier this year, but it was blocked by the NRA. Imaginatively, the NRA said this new bill was &quot;a new tactic&quot; to undermine gun rights. </p>

<p>&quot;If automobiles are dangerous with a drunken driver behind the wheel, it should be obvious that the same principle applies when someone carries a gun while intoxicated,&quot; Arkady Gerney, a mayoral criminal justice aide, testified. But cops are covered by departmental penalties for carrying their firearms and drinking even when off-duty. And thank God for that, or else we would never again such classic news stories as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120605124810/http://gawker.com/5567186/drunk-cop-fires-gun-inside-boyfriends-patrol-car++on-video">&quot;Drunk cop fires gun inside boyfriend&apos;s patrol car&quot;</a> again!</p>
