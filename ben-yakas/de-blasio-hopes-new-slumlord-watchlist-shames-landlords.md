When a landlord gets a violation for a health and safety problem, they ignore it in many cases and then they ignore it and then they ignore it again,&quot; he told the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160413095205/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/08/31/2010-08-31_slumlords_are_playing_dirty_so_well_play_hardball_say_city_pols.html">Daily News</a>. </p>

<p>Helena Wong, who works with tenants as director of CAAV Organizing Asian Communities, agrees about a lack of consequences: &quot;They use loopholes to delay the process. They say, &apos;Okay, I&apos;ll fix it, I&apos;ll fix it,&apos; and they even sign an agreement saying they&apos;ll fix it, but that doesn&apos;t mean it will get fixed.&quot; While continuing to fight for more fines for scalawag landlords, De Blasio hopes the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160413095205/http://www.pubadvocate.nyc.gov/landlord-watchlist">new list</a> shames some landlords into fixing their places, and that Mayor Bloomberg will sign a City Council-approved bill requiring every building to register all owners with a 25% stake, using a <em>real address</em>, not a post office box.</p>
