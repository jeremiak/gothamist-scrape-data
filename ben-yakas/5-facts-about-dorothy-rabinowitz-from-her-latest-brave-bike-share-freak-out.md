<p>Everyone&apos;s favorite out-of-touch reactionary conservative Dorothy Rabinowitz took another swig from that giant bottle of anti-biking alcohol she keeps hidden under her desk today. The Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150110130527/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/01/video_conservative_who_represents_m.php">who previously preached about</a> how Citi Bike <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150110130527/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/08/video_extremist_anti-bike_share_col.php">has destroyed everything good and beautiful about NYC</a> in two pieces for the Journal, sat down for a lunchtime <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150110130527/http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2013/06/dorothy-rabinowitz-lets-loose.html">interview with <em>New York</em> over the weekend</a> to further expand on her belief that bike share is destroying America. But on the bright side, we learned some fun facts about her in the process.</p>

<ul>
	<li><em>Dorothy Rabinowitz Believes In Aliens: </em>&#x201C;I realized it was like some science-fiction thing,&#x201D; Ms. Rabinowitz recalled. &#x201C;<strong>The pods have landed, only they&apos;ve landed with the racks, and they&apos;re coming with allies called bicyclists</strong>. The activating force behind all of the fury was the racks, instruments of aesthetic torture.&#x201D;</li>
	<li><em>Dorothy Rabinowitz Is Completely Blinded By Her Own Extremist Hypocrisy, So She&apos;ll Keep Lecturing You About Wanting To &quot;Do Good&quot; For The World, You Naive, Middle Class Fools!: </em>&#x201C;I&apos;m talking about the much less recognized world of entitled, middle-class and upper-middle-class riders in the city who think they are serving a noble cause. It&apos;s basically their very identity that they are special people, that they&apos;re helping the environment, and nobody has ever instilled any notion in them of the necessity of following a traffic rule.&#x201D;</li>
	<li><em>Dorothy Rabinowitz Is An American Hero Standing Up To Bike Share Nazis, Ostensibly Led By Hitler In A Helmet: </em>&#x201C;People walk up to me and say, &apos;I&apos;m so glad you said that about the bikes.&apos; I say, &apos;What the hell are we whispering about? <strong>What is this, East Germany?&apos; But it&apos;s an instinct, because what can we do about it?</strong>&#x201D;</li>
	<li><em>Dorothy Rabinowitz Doesn&apos;t Believe In Polls That Disagree With What She Believes Because...Did Nazis Use Polls? Let&apos;s Assume Nazis Used Polls. So Only A Nazi Would Believe A Poll: </em>&quot;A May poll showed that Citi Bikes are very popular, with 72 percent support. &apos;<strong>I think that&apos;s a false poll. Many polls are false, but I think this is one of the falsest</strong>. I have a strong feeling that about a year from now many politicians are going to be spending a lot of time distancing themselves from the bike-share program,&apos; she said. &apos;Wait until January.&apos;&quot;</li>
	<li><em>If Someone Can Prove To Dorothy Rabinowitz That More Than One Cyclist In NYC Has Stopped For A Red Light, We Are Allowed To Admit Her To An Asylum: </em>&#x201C;Unless I was having too much wine after dinner, I actually saw somebody on a bike stop at a red light,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;Once. That may have happened. <strong>If it happens more than once, I will submit myself to psychiatric examination on the grounds I&apos;m having a delusion.&#x201D;</strong></li>
