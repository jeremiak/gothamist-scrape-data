<p><em>Sully</em>, Clint Eastwood&apos;s film about Captain Chesley Sullenberger and the plane that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161113152307/http://gothamist.com/tags/miracleonthehudson">landed in the Hudson River in 2009</a>, will make an emergency crash landing in theaters tomorrow. Despite the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161113152307/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/30/watch_tom_hanks_play_sully_in_first.php">initial impression</a> that this movie would be like Denzel Washington&apos;s <em>Flight</em> but with fewer stakes, the film has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161113152307/http://www.metacritic.com/movie/sully">gotten great reviews</a> across the board. Well, there is one exception: the government accident investigators involved in the real-life investigation after the crash have taken umbrage with being depicted as the villains of the story.</p>

<p>&quot;We&apos;re not the KGB. We&apos;re not the Gestapo,&quot; Robert Benzon, who led the National Transportation Safety Board&apos;s (NTSB) investigation, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161113152307/http://bigstory.ap.org/article/8def306d398340fd8a80d232c96e43b7/real-life-investigators-object-portrayal-sully-movie">told AP.</a> &quot;We&apos;re the guys with the white hats on.&quot; The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161113152307/http://gothamist.com/2016/09/02/sully_movie_101.php">main conflict</a> of the film is that investigation: simulations showed that Sully could have made it back to the airport, which raised questions during the NTSB&apos;s meticulous 18-month investigation about whether Sully&apos;s performance had been affected by other factors.</p>

<p>&quot;Until I read the script, I didn&apos;t know the investigative board was trying to paint the picture that [Sully] had done the wrong thing. They were kind of railroading him into &apos;it was his fault,&apos;&quot; Eastwood said of the film. Benzon, who is now retired, added, &quot;These guys were already national heroes. We weren&apos;t out to embarrass anybody at all.&quot;</p>

<p>For what it&apos;s worth, Sully, who acted as an advisor on the film, disagreed with the tone the initial script took toward the investigators, and requested the real names of the NTSB members be taken out. &quot;He said, &apos;These are people who are not prosecutors. They are doing a very important job, and if, for editorial purposes, we want to make it more of a prosecutorial process, it ain&apos;t fair to them,&apos; &quot; said Tom Hanks. &quot;That&apos;s an easy thing to change.&quot;</p>

<p>Sully also appeared on <em>Late Show with Stephen Colbert</em> last night to promote the film, although he may also have just wanted to show off his mustache-free upper lip. &quot;I cut it off after two years of lobbying, my wife finally convinced me it was time for a clean look, time for a change, and she was right,&quot; he noted. Thankfully, Colbert had a backup &apos;stache for him. Check it out below.</p>
