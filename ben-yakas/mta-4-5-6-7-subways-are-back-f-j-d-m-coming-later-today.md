For the first time since <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141102031006/http://gothamist.com/tags/hurricanesandy">Hurricane Sandy</a> touched down in the city at the start of the week, Manhattan and Brooklyn have been re-connected via the transit system. Gov. Andrew Cuomo and MTA Chairman Joe Lhota confirmed that the 4/5/6/7 subways are back in full service as of 10 a.m. this morning; and the F/J/D/M should be back sometime this afternoon. And as you can see from the flooded subway tunnel photos above, they had a lot of work to do to get to this point.</p>

<p>&quot;I have never met people so dedicated and so much in love with what they do. New Yorkers should know that,&quot; Lhota said at the press conference. The 4 train is operating between Woodlawn in the Bronx and New Lots Avenue, Brooklyn&#x2014;running express in Manhattan and local in Brooklyn. It&apos;s especially good news for Brooklyn Nets fans headed to tonight&apos;s home opener against the Toronto Raptors today. </p>

<p>The 5 is operating between Eastchester/Dyre Avenue in the Bronx and Flatbush Avenue in Brooklyn; it&apos;s running express in Manhattan, and local in Brooklyn and the Bronx. The 6 train is operating between Pelham Bay Park and Brooklyn Bridge-City Hall as a local. And the 7 Line has been restored between Flushing-Main Street and 42 Street-Times Square.</p>

<p>Other updates on lines: the L train is flooded, wall to wall, ceiling to floor&#x2014;it may be back sometime next week. The A train will begin service Monday morning, from Lefferts to 168th Street; and they&apos;re not sure when the C train might be back yet. And <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141102031006/https://twitter.com/NYTMetro/status/264741323511320576">according to the Times</a>, Lhota said the Q train is expected back this afternoon, and the 2/3 by tomorrow.</p>
