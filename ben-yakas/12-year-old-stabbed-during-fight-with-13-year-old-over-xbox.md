<p>A 12-year-old was allegedly stabbed after getting into a fight with a 13-year-old in Queens over an Xbox. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140221070713/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/xbox-dispute-sees-queens-boy-stabbed-cops-article-1.1548264">According to the News</a>, the 12-year-old accused his 13-year-old neighbor of having his Xbox video game console (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140221070713/http://nypost.com/2013/12/15/boy-sliced-in-fight-over-xbox-controller/">the Post says</a> the fight was over an Xbox remote control). The two boys argued about it, until the older boy apparently took out a butter knife. </p>

<p>The 12-year-old didn&apos;t back down, and tried to grab the knife from the older boy&#x2014;that&apos;s when he accidentally stabbed himself in the stomach. He was taken to Jamaica Hospital with a small puncture wound. &#x201C;That boy is a very good child,&#x201D; neighbor Doreen White, said of the victim, who goes to school with her granddaughter. &#x201C;He doesn&#x2019;t come out from his house unless he&#x2019;s riding his bike. He never has a problem or beef with anybody. I never hear him out here fighting.&#x201D;</p>

<p>The older boy admitted to holding the butter knife, and has been charged as a minor with menacing. Back in 2012, a 20-year-old man <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140221070713/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/man-stabbed-22-times-tempers-flare-xbox-live-argument-article-1.1127305">was stabbed 22 times</a> over an Xbox argument; and in 2010, a 9-year-old Harlem boy was fatally stabbed by a family friend when they <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140221070713/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/anthony-maldonado-9-stabbed-death-video-game-visiting-family-harlem-article-1.457158">got into a fight over a Playstation.</a><br>
