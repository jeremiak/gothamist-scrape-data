<p>Remember when it was revealed that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021120214/http://gothamist.com/tags/hillaryclinton">Hillary Clinton</a> left the September 11th memorial due to a mysterious bout of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021120214/http://gothamist.com/2016/09/11/hillary_clinton_left_sept_11th_memo.php">&quot;overheating?&quot;</a> And remember when it was then revealed that Hillary Clinton actually was suffering from a mysterious bout of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021120214/http://gothamist.com/2016/09/12/pnemonia_clinton_sick.php">&quot;pneumonia?&quot;</a> And remember when it was further revealed that Hillary Clinton was actually dead? Wait, could you repeat that last thing...</p>

<p>ABC anchor Joe Torres made the verbal flub during the 6 p.m. news broadcast on Sunday, the same day that Clinton had revealed her pneumonia diagnosis amid much health speculation. Although there was no on-air correction to the mistake either during that broadcast or any subsequent one, ABC did <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021120214/http://www.trunews.com/article/nyc-news-station-accidentally-reports-hillary-clintons-death">clarify to TruNews</a>, &quot;Torres inadvertently said &#x2018;death&#x2019; when he meant to say &#x2018;health.&#x2019; It was clear from the context of the story, the reporters&#x2019; information and graphics on the screen that Secretary Clinton was alive and recovering.&quot;</p>

<p>Seems pretty simple right? A tiny, completely explainable mistake. Certainly not worth any extra investigation or thought.</p>

<p>But where there is Hillary Clinton deathwatch smoke, there is Hillary Clinton deathwatch fire.</p>

<p>The moral of this story, I think, is that Hillary Clinton is probably dead, and Donald Trump will be our supreme leader <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021120214/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/15/us/politics/donald-trump-health-dr-oz.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=first-column-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news">until he explodes</a>, taking us all with him.</p>
