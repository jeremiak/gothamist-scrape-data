<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430032235/http://gothamist.com/tags/subwaysurfer">Subway surfing</a> is the most x-treme NYC sport, the ultimate x-pression of rebellion in a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430032235/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/24/patsy_grimaldi_doesnt_approve_of_yo.php">world run amok</a>. Sure, there&apos;s a decent chance you will cause massive delays for fellow straphangers, seriously <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430032235/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/05/subway_surfer_seriously_injured_aft.php">injure yourself</a>, suffer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430032235/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/30/subway_surfer_suffers_head_injury_a.php">a head injury</a>, or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430032235/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/31/homeless_man_dies_from_subway_surfi.php">die</a>&#x2014;but at least you&apos;d get some truly righteous x-equies.
