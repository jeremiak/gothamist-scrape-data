<p>Yesterday, a dolphin <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130317012857/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/13/breaking_dolphin_spotted_in_east_ri.php">was spotted swimming around</a> in the East River &#x2014;the most heavily trafficked, overly contaminated waterway on the Eastern seaboard&#x2014;near 96th Street. The animal has since been identified <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130317012857/http://www.facebook.com/riverheadfoundation/posts/10151521567007597">by the Riverhead Foundation</a> as a bottlenosed dolphin; the group is continuing to monitor the dolphin there today. Despite it being a highly unusual place for a dolphin to end up, they maintain that the dolphin doesn&apos;t appear to be injured&#x2014;but there is still some cause for concern: &#x201C;He&#x2019;s not a healthy animal, but he&#x2019;s not at death&#x2019;s door. He&#x2019;s thin, but he&#x2019;s swimming very well,&#x2019;&#x2019; Kim Durham <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130317012857/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/some_finny_business_in_east_river_8fKeYsjARwNG6ICafyPDJM?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Local">told the Post.</a></p>

<p>They added in a Facebook update today, &quot;The dolphin was diving and swimming normally and there were no observable injuries noted. The dolphin continued to utilize a large area of the river and was avoiding the vessel during the observational period.&quot; It&apos;s unclear what Riverhead might do if the dolphin decides to stay in the area longer; Durham had told us that it would be difficult trying to herd him anywhere: &quot;Typically they don&apos;t go where you want them to go.&quot;</p>

<p>So for now, they&apos;ll continue to monitor the dolphin, and wait for it to leave the area on its own&#x2014;and hopefully we won&apos;t end up with a situation like the dolphin who became <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130317012857/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/25/the_dolphin_trapped_in_the_gowanus.php">trapped in the toxic Gowanus Canal</a> in January. As long as it doesn&apos;t suddenly develop the ability to walk on land, we think we&apos;ll be okay.</p>
