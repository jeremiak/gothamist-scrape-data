<p>A Rabbi <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150911224328/http://failedmessiah.typepad.com/failed_messiahcom/2013/12/haredi-mohel-botches-bris-causes-life-changing-injury-to-child-456.html">has been sued</a> for accidentally severing a baby boy&apos;s penis during a Jewish bris ceremony. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150911224328/http://www.brismilahpgh.com/The_Mohel.html">Rabbi Mordechai Rosenberg</a>, who has been an Orthodox mohel in the Pittsburgh area since 1990, has been sued for causing a &quot;catastrophic and life-changing injury&quot; to the baby, whose identity has not been released. </p>

<p>The circumcision ceremony occurred at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Squirrel Hill on April 28th of this year. The baby was rushed to a local hospital where doctors performed an emergency micro-surgery to reattach the dismembered penis. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150911224328/http://pittsburgh.cbslocal.com/2013/12/27/rabbi-sued-after-baby-injured-during-circumcision/">Sources told CBS that</a> surgery took eight hours, the baby needed six blood transfusions, and was subsequently hospitalized for nearly two months. The baby <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150911224328/http://triblive.com/news/adminpage/5277845-74/child-mohel-circumcision#axzz2o2kTLYgJ">also went through</a> leech therapy, because &quot;leeches help a body accept reattached parts by promoting blood flow and tissue regeneration.&quot;</p>

<p>Sources tell CBS that the reattachment procedure was successful, although doctors don&apos;t know whether he&apos;ll have problems later in life. &#x201C;Sometimes, it doesn&#x2019;t always work,&#x201D; said plastic surgeon Dr. Joe Losee, who wasn&apos;t involved with this particular surgery. &#x201C;When you&#x2019;re reattaching a portion where you include nerves, sometimes the nerves don&#x2019;t heal well beyond where you reattached it. So there are limitations for sure.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Rosenberg, who is a &#x201C;certified mohel by the American Board of Ritual Circumcision,&quot; has continued to practice as a mohel since the incident. He told KDKA, &#x201C;I am trained in this,&#x201D; and called the case a &#x201C;tragic accident&#x201D; and a &#x201C;horrible situation.&#x201D; The families lawyer agrees: &#x201C;That is extraordinarily serious and is extraordinarily rare,&#x201D; said attorney David Llewellyn.</p>
