<p>Here&apos;s something you don&apos;t hear about too much these days, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140206183618/http://gothamist.com/tags/badolddays">the future is barreling toward us</a>: a tourist and his Brooklyn friend were robbed at gunpoint in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140206183618/http://gothamist.com/tags/centralpark">Central Park</a> last night. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140206183618/http://gothamist.com/2013/12/28/bill_clinton_to_swear_in_bill_de_bl_1.php">Four days and counting, people.</a></p>

<p>According to police, the 24- and 25-year-olds were on West 64th Street near West Drive when they were approached by two men around 12:30 a.m. Saturday morning. &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t move, don&#x2019;t make noise or I&#x2019;ll kill you,&#x201D; one of the suspects said as he pulled out a gun, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140206183618/http://nypost.com/2013/12/28/tourists-robbed-at-gunpoint-in-central-park/">the Post reports</a>. &#x201C;What you got? Don&#x2019;t move, give me your money,&#x201D; a second suspect asked.</p>

<p>Altogether, a leather briefcase, cell phone, debit and credit cards, a passport and $113 cash were stolen from the two men. No arrests have been made, and police say the investigation is ongoing. </p>
