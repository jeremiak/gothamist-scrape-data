<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170923162129/http://gothamist.com/tags/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a>, a man who says with a straight face that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170923162129/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/03/08/21-times-donald-trump-has-assured-us-he-respects-women/?utm_term=.ff6d11ea07d9">no one respects women as much as Donald Trump</a>, celebrated International Women&apos;s Day today <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170923162129/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-tweeted-international-womens-day_us_58bfe3e7e4b054a0ea663890">by tweeting his tremendous support</a> for all the ladies in the country this morning. What a guy! </p>

<p>But perhaps a more appropriate way to mark International Women&apos;s Day would be to remember exactly how little Trump actually respects women (excluding his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170923162129/http://theconcourse.deadspin.com/a-complete-ish-history-of-donald-trumps-obsession-with-1787304637">one good daughter</a>, of course). To that end, someone has quietly plastered the East Village with posters printed with Trump&apos;s infamous hot mic sexual assault monologue. </p>

<p>You can see more photos up <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170923162129/http://vanishingnewyork.blogspot.com/2017/03/grab-em.html?m=1">at Jeremiah&apos;s Vanishing New York</a>. In case you&apos;ve forgotten the details of the poetic monologue, the posters read: </p>

<blockquote>&#x201C;I did try and fuck her. She was married.
I moved on her like a bitch,
But I couldn&#x2019;t get there.
And she was married.
You know I&#x2019;m automatically attracted to beautiful.
I just start kissing them. It&#x2019;s like a magnet. Just kiss.
I don&#x2019;t even wait.
You can do anything&#x2026;
Grab them by the pussy.
You can do anything.&#x201D;

<p><em>The President of the United States of America</em></p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>For old time&apos;s sake, here&apos;s the original leaked audio:</p>
