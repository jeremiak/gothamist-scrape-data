<p>Amidst his ongoing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170510192640/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/tv-ratings-colbert-fallon-race-tightens-999607">ratings war</a> with Jimmy Fallon and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170510192640/http://gothamist.com/2017/05/04/stephen_colbert_trump_joke.php">#FireColbert campaign</a> (don&apos;t forget about the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170510192640/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2017/05/09/no-stephen-colbert-is-not-being-investigated-by-the-fcc-for-his-trump-joke/?utm_term=.e44041eba626">FCC investigation confusion!</a>), Stephen Colbert brought in the big guns to celebrate his 20th year on late night TV: a memorable reunion episode with a bunch of his old friends from <em>The Daily Show</em> (that wasn&apos;t lame/purely nostalgic).</p>

<p>In a post-monologue sketch, Colbert staged a flashback to his last day at <em>The Daily Show</em> in 2005, bringing out younger versions of Jon Stewart, Samantha Bee, Rob Corddry, Ed Helms and John Oliver (who played Steve Carell, who was otherwise not available&#x2014;maybe the best part of the entire thing was seeing a photoshopped poster for <em>The 40-Year-Old Virgin</em> with Oliver&apos;s face on it). </p>

<p>&quot;There&apos;s never gonna be another president this good for comedy,&quot; Bee said at one point about then-president Bush. &quot;I mean, this guy does something ridiculous at least once a month. I know there&apos;s one thing for sure: there&apos;s no scenario under which I will ever say, &apos;God, I wish George W. Bush was president.&apos;&quot;</p>

<p>Among the best parts: Corddry&apos;s favorite comedians were Bill Cosby and Jared Fogle (&quot;They will never let you down&quot;); Oliver-as-Carell setting off to Hollywood to become a serious actor (with a terrible British accent); Stewart hoarding yogurts in the fridge; and the traditional pre-show prayer.</p>

<p>After the flashback, Colbert sat down with Stewart to catch up on all the latest news, including Trump firing Comey, Bill O&apos;Reilly&apos;s ousting, Stewart&apos;s beard texture (&quot;soft as an angel&apos;s ass,&quot; though that last word was bleeped out), and Colbert&apos;s recent controversy over a Trump-Putin oral sex joke.</p>

<p>Stewart came to Colbert&apos;s defense on that one: &quot;The things you say, even if they&#x2019;re crass or even if they are in some ways not respectful enough to the office of the presidency, we can insult, he can injure,&quot; Stewart said. &quot;It&#x2019;s the difference between insult and injury. And for the life of me I do not understand why in this country we try to hold comedians to a standard we do not hold leaders to. It&#x2019;s bizarre.&quot;</p>

<p>Colbert also asked Stewart about whether he misses responding to big news stories in real time, as with the Comey firing: &quot;There are nights where I find myself sort of impotently shouting into the abyss, which if you think about it, wasn&#x2019;t that different from what I did on a nightly basis,&#x201D; Stewart said. &quot;The process of making the show somehow became entwined with my process, with making sense of things that I didn&apos;t understand and the two sort of merged at some level. So I miss that and the people like you, and all the great people who were around it.&quot; However, he added, &quot;the things that I&#x2019;ve gained in terms of time spent with family and things like that, I wouldn&#x2019;t give up.&quot;</p>

<p>After that, Colbert brought out the entire crew to reminisce about their <em>Daily Show</em> auditions, trade inside jokes, tell backstage stories (Colbert offered a priceless anecdote about running from the Klan during a bit), play clips of early field pieces from each of them, and make fun of Stewart&apos;s enormous suits. It really was like &quot;a group of students coming back to see Mr. Holland,&quot; as Stewart said at one point. </p>

<p>There was also a short cold open in which Stewart and Colbert were interns working for Trevor Noah (who, like Trump, also has his own Coke button).</p>

<p>During his monologue, Colbert talked about the then-breaking news that Trump had fired FBI Director James Comey, and all things Trump/Russia/Flynn. &quot;That shows no gratitude at all. I mean, did Trump forget about the Hillary emails that Comey talked about?&quot; Colbert asked. Impersonating Trump, he added, &quot;Thanks for the presidency, Jimmy. Don&apos;t let the door hit ya where the Electoral College split ya.&quot;</p>
