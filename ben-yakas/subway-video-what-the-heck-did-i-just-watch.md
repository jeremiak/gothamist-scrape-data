<p>I&apos;ve seen plenty of weird subway stuff over my years here at Gothamist&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170717030117/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/18/video_woman_gives_very_happy_straph.php">butt bongos</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170717030117/http://gothamist.com/2014/05/20/commuters_subjected_to_children_pra.php">children torturing adults</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170717030117/http://gothamist.com/2014/10/10/used_condom_subway.php">subway condoms</a>, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170717030117/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/15/video_man_licks_shoe_on_subway.php">shoe licker</a>&#x2014;but I could at least identify what I was seeing with those vids. This...this is...it&apos;s like...you know? </p>

<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170717030117if_/https://www.youtube.com/embed/NuL2DuxPOwY" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>The video, which was first <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170717030117/https://www.facebook.com/mike.yi1/videos/10154295193741266/">uploaded to Facebook</a> last week, shows...well, that&apos;s what I&apos;m wondering. What <em>does</em> it show? Is it performance art? Is it some sort of religious mashup? Is it a rorschach test? Does your answer to this indicate what kind of profession you should be pursuing? <br>
 <br>
Here are my top guesses:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Very low budget The Residents cosplay gone wrong</li>
	<li>Sushi performance art</li>
<li>Those <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170717030117/http://gothamist.com/2014/05/20/commuters_subjected_to_children_pra.php">recorder children</a> all grown up</li>
	<li>A desperate attempt at viral marketing for a new season of <em>True Detective</em></li>
<li>Hypnotized by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170717030117/http://gothamist.com/tags/zardulu">Zardulu</a></li>
	<li>Just some people with too much time on their hands</li>
<li>I don&apos;t know what you&apos;re talking about, I don&apos;t see anything when I play the video, it&apos;s just a blank screen</li>
</ul>
