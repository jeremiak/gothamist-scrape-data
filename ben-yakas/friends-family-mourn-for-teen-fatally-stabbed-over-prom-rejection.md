<p>Yesterday, a teenage girl <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140624121913/http://gothamist.com/2014/04/25/high_school_student_fatally_stabbed_1.php">was fatally stabbed to death</a> by a classmate after she reportedly rejected his prom proposal. Maren Sanchez, 16, was fatally stabbed by a 16-year-old male classmate just before 7 a.m. Friday at Jonathan Law High School in Milford, Connecticut. &quot;The unprovoked attack on Maren has unfortunately for our family resulted in the permanent loss of Maren Victoria Sanchez&#x2014;a bright light full of hopes and dreams with her future at her fingertips,&quot; said the victim&apos;s cousin Edward Kovac <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140624121913/http://www.wfsb.com/story/25339366/stabbing-reported-at-jonathan-law-high-school-in-milford">in a statement</a>. </p>

<p>Around 200 students and parents from the school gathered at Walnut Beach to pay tribute to Sanchez (see above); many of the students were dressed in the gowns and tuxedos they had been planning to wear to their prom, which was supposed to happen last night but has since been postponed. Sanchez was instrumental in organizing the junior prom; the school noted it will be naming her prom queen when it does happen, as voted by her fellow students. &quot;She had the prom queen type of personality. I just felt she deserved it,&quot; senior Crystal Johnson <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140624121913/http://www.nhregister.com/general-news/20140425/jonathan-law-high-school-students-community-mourn-milford-stabbing-victim-maren-sanchez">told the New Haven Register.</a></p>

<p>Sanchez was stabbed multiple times with a kitchen knife, including in the face and chest. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140624121913/http://www.wfsb.com/story/25339366/stabbing-reported-at-jonathan-law-high-school-in-milford">Associated Press is reporting</a> that the suspect, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140624121913/http://nypost.com/2014/04/25/teen-girl-stabbed-to-death-after-rejecting-prom-proposal/">whom the Post has</a> identified as Chris Plaskon, stabbed Sanchez after she declined to be his date to the junior prom; police would not comment, only saying they are still investigating and it was &quot;an isolated incident.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;He asked her to the prom right there, and she rejected him,&quot; Imani Langston, a junior who described herself as Sanchez&#x2019;s best friend, told the Post. Other friends told them that the suspect and Sanchez had been friends for many years, but she had already started dating fellow student Jarrod Butts, with whom she was going to prom.</p>

<p>&quot;Chris has had a crush on Maren for as long as I could remember,&quot; said &#xAD;junior Mick Murray, another friend. &quot;All three of them grew up together.&quot; That student, who was immediately arrested and charged with murder, is being kept on suicide watch at an adolescent psychiatric ward.</p>

<p>&quot;The last day I saw her, she was showing me her prom dress. She was so excited,&quot; another friend, Megan Gossett, told the Post.</p>

<p>Sanchez &quot;told me about her prom dress, she told me how she got asked to prom,&#x201D; Langston added. &quot;We were just laughing, talking about what we were going to do when we got there, how many pictures we were going to take.&quot;</p>
