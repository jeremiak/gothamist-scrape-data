<p>Union Square is host to a bevy of unique bizarros, to the point that the square has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150820013250/http://gothamist.com/2010/11/26/normal_bob_documents_union_square_w.php">its own anthropologist</a>, Normal Bob. And among Bob&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150820013250/http://normalbobsmith.com/">many subjects</a> is Roman, who has gained some notoriety because of a campaign <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150820013250/http://www.vimeo.com/26500746">earlier this summer</a> to &quot;stop ageism&quot; by lowering the age of consent. Now, Roman has taken up a new cause: butt sniffing. Watch him explain his new &quot;fart smeller movement&quot; in a video <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150820013250/http://www.joeyboots.com/2011/09/03/can-i-smell-your-butt/">taken by Joey Boots</a> below, as well as convince two young women to let him try out his art:</p>

<p>Roman&apos;s latest sensory project stems from an earlier one in which he face sat for peace...with a sign that read &quot;sit on my face for peace.&quot; You can watch a bit of that below, if you are so inclined:</p>

<p>As <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150820013250/http://www.normalbobsmith.com/amazingstrangers/122.html">Normal Bob put it</a>, the newest projects have at least solved one problem for Roman:  &quot;You see, no one knows who the hell you&apos;re talking about when you say &apos;Roman got thrown out of the park yesterday!&apos;&quot; Now he has a catchy name: the Fart Smeller. Or, as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150820013250/http://animalnewyork.com/2011/09/the-union-square-butt-sniffer/">AnimalNY put it</a> (and our preferred nomen), the butt sniffer.</p>
