<p>What is fear? Is it a movie starring Marky Mark? Is it the 1991 album by Toad The Wet Sprocket? Is it the feeling one gets when Jason Terry starts <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429103229/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/03/holy_knck_knicks_hang_on_to_take_ou.php">hitting his shots in the fourth quarter</a>? None of those things compare to this though: the MTA is reportedly planning to shutdown the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429103229/http://gothamist.com/tags/ltrain">L Train</a> during Memorial Day Weekend and the weekend of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429103229/http://northsidefestival.com/">Northside Festival</a> to do track work. Which can only mean one thing: chaos reigns.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429103229/http://www.thelmagazine.com/TheMeasure/archives/2013/05/06/change-of-plans-the-l-train-will-be-running-during-northside">According to L Mag</a>, who run the Northside Festival, &quot;An email late last Friday from the MTA informed us that, while the L will still be shut down during Memorial Day weekend, service will continue as usual during Northside, with repairs now scheduled for the weekend of June 22-24.&quot;</p>

<p>Desperate times call for desperate measures, which is what led a motley assemblage of NYC politicians (State Senator Daniel Squadron, Congressmembers Carolyn Maloney and Nydia Velazquez, Senator Martin Dilan, Assemblyman Joseph Lentol, Borough President Marty Markowitz, and Councilman Stephen Levin) to team together to <strike>beg</strike> ask the MTA in a letter (see below) to reconsider this death sentence on holiday weekend brunch plans. &quot;We understand that planned maintenance to the subway system is essential and shutdown dates will never be ideal,&quot; they write, &quot;but it is very important that the MTA follow through on its commitment to community engagement and reschedule these shutdowns.&quot;</p>

<p>Will the MTA hear these politicians cries, pull <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429103229/http://www.newnownext.com/downton-abbey-recap-christmas-special/02/2012/">a <em>Downton Abbey</em></a>, and hand down a last-second reprieve? Or will the disemboweled fox of Lars Van Trier&apos;s dreams ruin our chance to see The Walkmen again?  </p>
