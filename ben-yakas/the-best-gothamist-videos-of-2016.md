But as many sophisticated urban survivalists know, there is an extraordinary amount of perfectly good, even gourmet, food set out every night in sanitary bags outside city delis, bakeries, restaurants, and supermarkets. </p>

This fuzzy, pinstriped guy has a short, hazy history, as he was never fully embraced by the franchise. Dandy was &quot;a failure,&quot; according to the NY Times, but we would argue that he just wasn&apos;t given enough of a chance to succeed.</p>

Erickson got the job, and went on to create some of the most famous Muppets, including Miss Piggy and Statler &amp; Waldorf. She is also the same woman who created Dandy!</p>

The protesters are there to protest abortions, but Stella tells me that they believe &quot;anyone patronizing the clinic is killing babies, whether or not you&#x2019;re here for abortion care. Your money is supporting abortion, so, they&#x2019;re against you.&quot;</p>
