<p>When we hear IKEA, we think of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717092920/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/25/ikea_finds_horse_in_its_meatballs_i.php">horse meatballs</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717092920/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/23/ikea_monkey.php">monkeys</a>, and that hilarious <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717092920/http://www.hulu.com/watch/387672"><em>Louie</em> episode</a>&#x2014;but we don&apos;t normally associate the Swedish domesticity warehouse with romance. Not so for Shirley and Berkely Smith, who originally met at an IKEA in New Jersey over seven years ago. The two <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717092920/http://www.nj.com/union/index.ssf/2013/06/newark_couple_marry_in_the_sam.html">tied the knot</a> this past weekend, and they did so at the most romantic place they could think of: IKEA.</p>

<p>The two met in 2005 at an IKEA in Elizabeth, N.J.&#x2014;their meeting was facilitated by Shirley&apos;s then 14-year-old daughter Jashirele Stewart: &quot;My daughter had gotten suspended from school so we were in there doing some shopping,&quot; Shirley Smith <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717092920/http://gma.yahoo.com/blogs/abc-blogs/couple-says-ikeas-framing-department-170754435.html?vp=1">told Good Morning America</a>. &quot;He was in there. I saw him right when he came in, and I checked his finger to make sure he wasn&apos;t married. I followed him for about an hour.&quot; </p>

<p>Jashirele approached Berkely on her behalf: &quot;He said to her, &apos;I don&apos;t give my number to little kids,&apos; so she brought him over to me,&quot; Shirley Smith said. &quot;I was thinking, &apos;Oh, my God. I&apos;m going to have a heart attack.&apos; But we&apos;ve been best friends ever since.&quot; When they decided to get married recently, they knew they wanted to at least get a photo in the aisle where they met.</p>

<p>&quot;I called and explained we wanted it to be just him and I in that section, and just take a picture and that&apos;s it,&quot; said Shirley. &quot;I didn&apos;t want to distract the customers or cause a big fuss, but they said they&apos;ll do it even better.&quot; So in the end, IKEA was the location for the wedding, and they gave the couple a heap of gifts as well. </p>

<p>&quot;It came out to be so beautiful,&quot; Shirley Smith said. &quot;It was better than I ever hoped.&quot; All this time, we&apos;ve been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717092920/http://www.forbes.com/sites/markgibbs/2013/01/07/are-corporations-people-in-the-carpool-lane/">arguing about</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717092920/http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/money/smallbusiness/columnist/strauss/story/2012-08-06/strauss-corporations-are-not-people/56830998/1">whether corporations</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717092920/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702303740704577524823306803692.html">should be</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717092920/http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/07/the-supreme-court-still-thinks-corporations-are-people/259995/">considered people</a>, but maybe we&apos;ve been asking the wrong question&#x2014;we never stopped to consider whether corporations <em>can feel love.</em></p>
