<p>Whether they&apos;re doing your laundry or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151031153753/http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/news/hamilton-mom-2-sons-guilty-in-1-2m-mortgage-fraud-case-1.2694310">laundering</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151031153753/http://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/NJ-Mom-Daughter-Accused-in-Money-Laundering-Scheme-255366931.html">your dirty money</a>, Moms are the best! But sometimes moms get tired of all that laundry...and all that emotional laundering. Which is apparently what happened to mom Natasha Harrow, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151031153753/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/mom-dumps-8-year-old-ues-corner-article-1.1895453">who is accused of abandoning</a> her 8-year-old son Elijah on the Upper East Side with $4 in his pocket. &quot;You always wanted me to go away,&quot; she told him, according to court papers. &quot;I&apos;ll go away.&quot;</p>

<p>Cops say Elijah wandered around for about two hours alone on June 22nd until some good Samaritans saw him &quot;standing forlornly&quot; on First Avenue and E. 86th Street, and informed police. Natasha wasn&apos;t tracked down until almost two weeks later. When she was questioned by police this week, she admitted to leaving him, although she disputed the location: &quot;No, I left him at 96th St. and Second Ave.,&quot; she said, according to court papers.</p>

<p>Natasha Harrow has been charged with abandonment of a child and endangering the welfare of a child. Elijah is being cared for by his grandmother in Brooklyn, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151031153753/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/mom-dumps-8-year-old-ues-corner-article-1.1895453">according to the News.</a></p>
