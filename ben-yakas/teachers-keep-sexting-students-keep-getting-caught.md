But it seems that some teachers just can&apos;t enjoy inappropriately flirting with students unless there&apos;s some sort of digital trace to later be used against them. For two city teachers and one assistant principal, that was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151007022056/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/sext_educators_end_up_with_no_class_yvk5LdhQMa2s3XIjq5TGXN">exactly the case recently</a>.</p>

<p>First, there&apos;s Rivky Love, a 36-year-old math teacher at Edward R. Murrow HS in Brooklyn, who went through a long administrative trial over her insistent texting to a female student. Love allegedly called the girl her &quot;best friend and sister,&quot; and would send her tons of messages late at night, such as, &quot;husband not here...kids asleep...have dinner with me.&quot; Another said &quot;Love you,&quot; and when the student didn&apos;t respond to her texts during winter recess, Love wrote furiously, &quot;I AM SO MAD AT YOU. YOU HATE ME. YOU FORGOT ABOUT ME.&quot;</p>

<p>There was also an allegation that Love offered to give the student a copy of an upcoming test, which she said was only a joke. Weeping on the stand, Love admitted improper conduct, but denied any sexual motive; she was suspended for six months without pay.</p>

<p>Then, there&apos;s Thomas Coleman, the former assistant principal at University Neighborhood HS in Manhattan, who was accused of sending 112 texts over a three month period to a female student who had just graduated. Those texts included at least four pictures, one of which was allegedly of (presumably his) genitals. Coleman denied the allegations, but was fired.</p>

<p>And lastly, there&apos;s Homer Panteloglou, who exchanged nearly 1,800 texts and 318 calls with a female student at the HS of Finance &amp; Economics in Manhattan. He was forced to pay a $7,000 fine, agree to training and was assigned a non-permanent classroom job at Richard Green HS of Teaching in Manhattan. </p>
