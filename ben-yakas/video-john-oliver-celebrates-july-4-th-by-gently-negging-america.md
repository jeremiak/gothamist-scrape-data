<p>Like <em>almost</em> all other original programming (looking at you, <em>Preacher</em>), <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021145203/http://gothamist.com/tags/lastweektonight"><em>Last Week Tonight</em></a> was off this week for the July 4th holiday weekend. But John Oliver did take some time out of whatever the British equivalent of barbecuing is (mutton stewing?) to remind Americans of what we&apos;re all missing out on when we declared independence and kicked Britain out of the country. </p>

<p>Watch below as Oliver toasts to British accents (&quot;From sea to shining sea, [Americans] speak like you just burnt your tongue on a hot apple pie&quot;), bowler hats, meat pies, the Queen, and glorious pessimism. As he concludes, &quot;So take a moment on this July the 4th to think about all that you left behind, and I think you&apos;ll realize, honestly, you are probably way better off the way things are.&quot;</p>
