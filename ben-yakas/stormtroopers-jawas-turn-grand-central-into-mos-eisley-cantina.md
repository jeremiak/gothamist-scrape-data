Characters from the <em>Star Wars</em> universe were spotted around 42nd Street, promoting Saturday&apos;s release of the nine-disc <em><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160105162309/http://www.starwars.com/news/starwars_blu-ray.html">Star Wars: The Complete Saga</a></em> Blu-Ray edition. Not everyone was thrilled to encounter Wookies, Ewoks and Stormtroopers: <strong>&quot;I really don&apos;t have time to deal with these Star Wars characters outside Grand Central,</strong>&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160105162309/http://twitter.com/#!/paintitgold/status/114304714518179840">tweeted Kenyon Cory.</a> Captain Kirk <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160105162309/http://www.treknews.net/2011/09/15/william-shatner-says-star-wars-was-derivative-of-star-trek-video/?utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;utm_medium=twitter">shares your pain</a>, Kenyon.</p>
