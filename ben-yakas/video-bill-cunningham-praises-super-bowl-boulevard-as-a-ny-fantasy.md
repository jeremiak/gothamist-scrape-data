<p>Many New Yorkers&#x2014;including <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406143510/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/30/anti_superbowl_activities.php">some outspoken Gothamist staffers</a>&#x2014;have been less than thrilled with all the Super Bowl hoopla that has invaded our city this week. It&apos;s hard to blame them when &apos;Super Bowl Boulevard Engineered by GMC&apos; is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406143510/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/31/super_bowl_kills_flowers.php">killing orchids and local businesses</a> while turning midtown into even more of a commuter&apos;s nightmare. But leave it to legendary photographer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406143510/http://gothamist.com/tags/billcunningham">Bill Cunningham</a> to cut through the corporate crap and find a silver lining in all this: &quot;[I&apos;m] caught up in the midst of Super Bowl madness that is just like a giant spaceship arrived on Broadway in Times Square!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I hardly know a football from a tennis ball, I never thought I&apos;d be caught up in this, but it&apos;s wonderful, absolutely wonderful&quot; he says in the video above. &quot;The spirit really is like a mid-winter carnival. It&apos;s really a New York fantasy, if ever there was one.&quot; Cunningham may not know much about football, but he was in Times Square <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406143510/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/08/photos_bill_cunningham_spotted_at_g.php#photo-1">documenting the Giants ticker tape parade</a> after their 2012 Super Bowl victory. </p>
