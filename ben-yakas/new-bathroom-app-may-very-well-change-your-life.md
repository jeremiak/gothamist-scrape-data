										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="9811toilet.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150817072113im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/9811toilet.jpg" width="640" height="427" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>Let&apos;s say you&apos;re visiting the National 9/11 Memorial and Museum, and suddenly realize that you <em>really</em> have to go to the bathroom. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150817072113/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/22/whoops_911_memorial_and_museum_has.php">closest public toilets</a> in the area are at the discount department store Century21...but the lines are out the door. What do you do? A new phone app which pairs up pee-ers in need with strangers&apos; toilets may be the perfect solution.</p>

<p>The smart phone app, CLOO, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150817072113/http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-20102617-1/cloo-app-rents-your-restroom-to-semi-strangers/">is based on</a> what we&apos;d call a revolutionary idea: what if there were a social network for going to the bathroom? &quot;CLOO&apos; turns any private bathroom into a public bathroom accessible to your friends &amp; friends of friends using your social media connections,&quot; the company explains <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150817072113/http://www.cloo-app.com/">on their website.</a> </p>

<p>The program finds potential loo&apos;s through your friends on Facebook, Foursquare, and Twitter. You then send a toilet request and the person decides whether or not to rent out their bathroom to you for a (small) fee. As long as no one <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150817072113/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/23/man_steals_toilet_from_brooklyn_apa.php">steals your toilet</a>, we think the idea sounds keen! Check out a demo of the program below:</p>

<p>So far, many people are skeptical about the idea, if not downright indignant at the mere suggestion: &quot;Why would you want a complete stranger in your house? There are plenty of places to use the bathroom. Go to a restaurant, buy a cup of coffee, and use the bathroom there,&quot; Connecticut resident Amy Mass <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150817072113/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/2011/09/08/2011-09-08_cloo_app_helps_people_who_need_to_use_bathroom_find_strangers_willing_to_open_up.html">told the News.</a> But we&apos;re just wondering if this is secretly the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150817072113/http://www.slate.com/blogs/xx_factor/2011/09/07/grindr_for_women_can_the_gay_hookup_app_go_straight_.html">straight version of the gay hookup Grindr app</a> we keep hearing is in the pipeline.</p>
