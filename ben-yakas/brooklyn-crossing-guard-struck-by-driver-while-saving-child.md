<p>A Brooklyn crossing guard was struck by a driver after she pushed a child out of the way of an oncoming car. Police say that Shameeka White, 37, was run over at the intersection of Atlantic and Ralph Avenues in Bedford-Stuyvesant on Wednesday morning.  According to FDNY, she was taken to King&apos;s County Hospital with serious but non-life threatening injuries.</p>

<p>White&apos;s union, Local 372 AFSCME, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425175324/http://www.brooklyneagle.com/articles/brooklyn-crossing-guard-injured-car-atlantic-ave-2014-04-10-014300">told the Brooklyn Eagle that</a> the car&#x2019;s driver &quot;roared up the street blindly passing a stalled bus that blocked his view of the child, the school crossing guard and the traffic signs clearly stating his turn was illegal.&quot; They added that White sustained a fractured left arm and knee, as well as ankle sprains to her left leg. </p>

<p>&quot;Shameeka White is a heroine, our wonder woman, who thought quickly, pushed the child out of harm&#x2019;s way and allowed her body to take the full force of a speeding car,&quot; Local 372&#x2019;s President Santos Crespo, Jr. told them. White, a mother of two children, has been a crossing guard for 10 years. Police add that the driver has not been charged, and the investigation is ongoing.</p>

<p>The incident happened <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425175324/http://gothamist.com/2014/04/09/atlantic_avenue_gets_a_new_25_mph_s.php">on the same day that city officials announced</a> plans to install retimed stoplights, increase NYPD enforcement, and enact a 25 mph speed limit on an eight mile stretch of Atlantic Avenue.</p>
