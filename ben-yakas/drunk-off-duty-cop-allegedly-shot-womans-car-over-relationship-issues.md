<p>An off-duty NYPD officer has been accused of shooting a woman&apos;s car in NJ yesterday. Cops say that Sergeant Wanda Anthony, who works out of the 122nd Precinct in Staten Island, was arrested in Watchung, NJ for shooting the other woman&#x2019;s car around 3:30 a.m. Wednesday. This officer is not to be confused with the two other allegedly drunk off-duty cops who shot people in the past week.</p>

<p>According <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427145409/http://nypost.com/2014/04/30/latest-drunk-nypd-officer-cuffed-accused-of-shooting-womans-car/?utm_campaign=SocialFlow&amp;utm_source=NYPTwitter&amp;utm_medium=SocialFlow">to the Post</a>, Anthony was coming home from a date with a man &quot;when his wife stormed out of the house and confronted her,&quot; leading to Anthony shooting the car. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427145409/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/nypd-allegedly-shoots-gun-drunk-chief-article-1.1774643">The Daily News says</a> this was Anthony&apos;s <em>former</em> boyfriend, and she shot at his new girlfriend. </p>

<p>Anthony fled the scene, but was later pulled over and charged with driving while intoxicated. She may face other charges for the shooting as well. This is believed to be the third drunken shooting incident involving NYPD officers in the past week, and the second to happen on Wednesday. </p>

<p>NYPD Officer Brendan Cronin <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427145409/http://gothamist.com/2014/05/01/drunk_cop_shoots_randomly.php">was arrested Wednesday morning</a> for allegedly shooting a stranger six times (non-fatally) in the town of Pelham after a night of drinking. And last Thursday, Detective Jay Poggi <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427145409/http://gothamist.com/2014/04/24/drunk_nypd_detective_shoots_partner.php">allegedly shot his partner</a> in the wrist while drunk as well.</p>

<p>&quot;We&#x2019;re very concerned with a number of reports,&quot; Police Commissioner Bill Bratton said. &quot;I, personally, am very disturbed about the number of incidents in recent weeks that are part of a longer-term problem of inappropriate use of alcohol by members of our department.&quot;</p>

<p>The week before these incidents, three other officers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427145409/http://gothamist.com/2014/04/19/3_off-duty_cops_arrested_for_drunk.php">were all arrested</a> for unrelated drunk driving incidents.</p>
