A next-door neighbor spotted the baby, along with a white and red rose, on the stoop of a home on 28th Street, near Ditmars Boulevard. &quot;[She] saw all the toys in the yard, and decided to leave her with the family with the babies,&quot; speculated resident Stephen Katehis.<p></p>

<p>The baby, whom police described as either white or Hispanic, was taken to Elmhurst Hospital, and is in stable condition. &quot;The baby is fine. The mother has not been found yet, but police are canvassing local hospitals,&quot; a police source <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422144351/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2011/08/19/2011-08-19_newborn_girl_found_outside_building_inside_a_shoebox_police_say.html">told the News.</a> The Administration for Children&apos;s Services <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422144351/http://www.ny1.com/content/top_stories/145396/police-search-for-parents-of-newborn-found-in-shoebox">says that if</a> the parents are not found within a day, the baby will be placed in foster care.</p>

<p>A neighbor who was walking home around 3:30 a.m. last night said she heard a baby crying, but thought it was coming from indoors: &quot;I really wish I had gone with my instincts and gone up the steps, but it was late and dark and you don&apos;t expect that. I&apos;m so happy the baby is all right,&quot; said Shazi Dossani. The newborn joins an illustrious list of (fictional) little balls of cute who were given up early on, including Moses, Harry Potter, and the Penguin.</p>
