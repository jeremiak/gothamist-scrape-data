<p>Ever since <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406145917/http://gothamist.com/tags/davidbowie">David Bowie</a> made his surprise announcement about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406145917/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/01/listen_now_to_the_excellent_new_dav.php">excellent new album <em>The Next Day</em></a>, everyone has been wondering if he&apos;d tour again. And it seems his wife Iman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406145917/http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/music-arts/bowie-wife-lets-slip-rocker-planning-tour-article-1.1288314?localLinksEnabled=false">may have let slip</a> that he will: &quot;We have a 12-year-old in school, so we are stuck, we can&apos;t travel,&quot; she told fashion magazine Grazia. &quot;Our schedule is around her, so I don&apos;t know. <strong>We&apos;ll have to go visit him, but we won&apos;t be on tour with him because she&apos;s in school [in New York.]</strong>&quot; </p>

<p>Rumors and speculation have run rampant since Bowie unveiled &quot;Where Are We Now?&quot; on his 66th birthday in January, a decade after his last album (<em>Reality</em>) and his last tour, which ended with him enduring several health problems. Bowie initially sounded reluctant to tour, but guitarist Gerry Leonard <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406145917/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/david-bowie-guitarist-gerry-leonard-odds-of-a-tour-are-50-50-20130220">speculated to Rolling Stone that</a> there were 50/50 odds that he&apos;d end up back on the road: &#x201C;A couple of times, when we played back one of the more kick-ass tunes from the new record, he&apos;d be like, &apos;This would be great live!&apos; Of course, everyone was like, &apos;What? Did he just say that?&apos; But other times he&apos;d just roll his eyes if someone brought up playing live.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Longtime producer Tony Visconti also speculated that there is a chance he might, at very least, perform one or two standalone: &quot;He says that he will only play if he feels like it, but no tour. Like, if wanted to do the odd show in New York or, I don&apos;t know, London, he would if he felt like it.&quot; But considering the orgiastic reception the new album has received (it might be his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406145917/http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1551810/david-bowie-vs-bon-jovi-for-no-1-on-next-weeks-billboard-200">first #1 record in America!</a>), maybe he&apos;s been galvanized into touring. </p>

<p>Either way, we&apos;ll be there if and when he does play live. If you doubt how great he is live, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406145917/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/19/listen_to_david_bowies_secret_great.php">just click here to listen to Bowie live</a> at Nassau Coliseum in Long Island in 1976, one of the only documents of the epic Station To Station tour. Or watch him perform at the Meltdown Festival in 2002 above, or the Live From the 10 Spot below.</p>

<p>At least we feel assured that if he does play live, one way or another, he&apos;ll play here.</p>
