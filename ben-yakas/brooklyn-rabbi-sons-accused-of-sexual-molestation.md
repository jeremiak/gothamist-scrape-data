Rabbi Gershon Kranczer, 58, has been accused of sexually abusing two underage relatives; the eldest victim, a 20-year-old woman, told a co-worker at a Brooklyn yeshiva that she was sexually assaulted by the rabbi. The co-worker went to police, who soon discovered that three of the woman&apos;s relatives, aged 19, 17 and 8, were also abused in the Rabbi&apos;s home.</p>

<p>Rabbi Kranczer and his 21-year-old legally-blind son Asher fled to Israel on Monday night. The rabbi&apos;s 24-year-old son, Yechezkel Kranczer, turned himself in to the NYPD Thursday, and was arrested on a variety of charges, including multiple counts of sexually abusing relatives aged 17 and 20. The third son who has been accused, a 15-year-old, also turned himself in, and was charged with sexually abusing an 8-year-old relative.  The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522122059/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/nypd_hunting_klyn_dad_sons_who_abused_X6HMlarveG6Zd20GhXEeLJ?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">Post&apos;s article</a> suggests the victims are Kranczer&apos;s daughters.</p>

<p>The 20-year-old woman said she had been abused by the Rabbi for over 15 years; he is the former head of Yeshiva Tehila L&apos;Dovid, but he abruptly resigned from the yeshiva three months ago. Rabbi Kranczer has 14 children, all between the ages of 10 and 28; those under the age of 18 were removed and placed into the care of the Administration for Children&apos;s Services this week. The NYPD is coordinating with Israeli police to track down the Rabbi and his son.</p>
