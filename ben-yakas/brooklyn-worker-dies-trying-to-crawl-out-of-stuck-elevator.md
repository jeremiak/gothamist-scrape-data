<p>A 25-year-old man working at the Brooklyn Navy Yard died yesterday after he got stuck in an elevator and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130507054726/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/man_killed_in_elevator_mishap_at_DC4ihs9dzsxXGtUP9yMNeJ">attempted to crawl out</a>. Inunion Tursunov, 25, was leaving the Flushing Avenue building around 10:30 p.m. when the elevator got stuck between the fourth and fifth floors due to a power outage. In the darkness, Tursunov was able to pry open both of the doors&#x2014;but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130507054726/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/worker-dies-crawl-elevator-article-1.1335057">he slipped and fell through a gap</a>, falling to the bottom of the elevator shaft. </p>

<p>A security guard on duty heard Tursunov land on the ground and called police. Emergency workers rushed him to Brooklyn Hospital, where he died. It&apos;s not yet clear what caused the power outage. <br>
