</div></div><p>It&apos;s been a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120503195640/http://gothamist.com/tags/blizzageddon">long, confusing week</a>, we&apos;re starting to lose track of all the events of the Blizzageddon, and nobody has shared a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120503195640/http://gothamist.com/2010/12/29/woman_shares_two_bottles_of_rum_wit.php">bottle of rum</a> with us. Thankfully, we can piece together the shards of our wintry memories with the help of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120503195640/http://www.nma.tv/">Next Media Animation</a>. They <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120503195640/http://www.nma.tv/bloomberg-blamed-mishandling-snowpocalypse/">plow through</a> the miasma of snow stories with their usual grace, taking time for visual jokes incorporating &quot;Fresh Direct,&quot; Mayor Bloomberg&apos;s height, &quot;lazy&quot; sanitation workers, and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120503195640/http://gothamist.com/2010/12/12/giants_will_play_favre_and_vikings.php">Metrodome collapse</a>. But between this, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120503195640/http://gothamist.com/2010/12/30/mta_fare_increase_gets_animated_tre.php">MTA fare hike</a>, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120503195640/http://www.nma.tv/walmart-threatens-york-city-merchants/">Walmart</a>, it&apos;s got us wondering: has NMA set up a permanent NYC branch? (Also, are they <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120503195640/http://gothamist.com/2010/12/29/2_days_into_blizzageddon_bloomberg.php">JDS fans</a>?)</p>
