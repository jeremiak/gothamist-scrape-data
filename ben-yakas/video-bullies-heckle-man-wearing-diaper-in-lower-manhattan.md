<p>Look, there are a thousand reasons why an adult might wear a diaper: incontinence, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429164336/http://gothamist.com/2013/12/10/ny_woman_who_wore_cocaine_diapers_g.php#photo-1">cocaine smuggling</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429164336/http://www.wikihow.com/React-when-Your-Spouse-Is-Wearing-Diapers">sexual experimentation</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429164336/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/23/bloombergs_advice_for_success_dont.php">post traumatic Bloomberg stress</a>, etc. Whatever reason the man in the video below had for walking around 14th Street near 2nd Avenue in a diaper, that&apos;s his business. But these insensitive passersby felt compelled to make fun of him either way. Because clearly there is nothing funnier than the word &quot;doody.&quot;</p>

<p>Sure it&apos;s out of the ordinary to see a person wearing a diaper in public. But if someone isn&apos;t bothering you, and you have nothing nice to say about them, then perhaps you shouldn&apos;t turn on your camera and pathetically start to mock another human being. At best, all you&apos;re going to do is draw comparisons to the rednecks from <em>Deliverance</em>&#x2014;but, you know, more doody-obsessed. This is NYC&#x2014;if you can&apos;t handle people getting weird and freaky on the street, move back to Staten Island.</p>
