<p>Beloved indie singer/songwriter/&apos;90s pinup idol <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502142137/http://gothamist.com/tags/stephenmalkmus">Stephen Malkmus</a> laid out his whole misunderstood personality on Pavement&apos;s first album, <em>Slanted And Enchanted</em>, in one insistent cry: &quot;I&apos;m trying.&quot; Last night at Webster Hall, a packed crowd was treated to both sides of Malkmus: the elder indie statesmen&#x2014;melodically aloof <em>and</em> a guitar guru&#x2014;with an energetic 20-song set that proved he really is still trying, despite appearances.</p>

<p>Twelve of the songs played last night came from the band&apos;s latest Beck-produced album <em>Mirror Traffic</em>, which found the Jicks&apos; subduing their instrumental chops in favor of focusing on Malkmus&apos;s supernatural melodic abilities. The band, now featuring drummer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502142137/http://gothamist.com/2007/11/05/jake_morris_dru.php">Jake Morris</a> (of The Joggers), was particularly tight, running through the new tunes with energy and glee (despite being exhausted, as Morris told us after the show). </p>

<p>&quot;Tigers&quot; had the pull of a lost Alex Chilton gem, &quot;Forever 28&quot; was ELO for the indie crowd, &quot;Senator&quot; is the hit-that-should-be, and &quot;Brain Gallop&quot; climaxed in a wonderful duel guitar solo. The band also pulled out some new tunes (&quot;Planetary Motion,&quot; &quot;Independence Street&quot;), some crowd-pleasing classics (headbanging set opener &quot;Baby C&apos;mon,&quot; romantically adrift &quot;Animal Midnight&quot; and, by request, set-closing fan favorite &quot;1% of One&quot;) and one killer cover (Sweet&apos;s &quot;Love Is Like Oxygen&quot;).</p>

<p>Malkmus has long been unfairly plagued by a certain critical analysis of his personality which has proven detrimental to appreciating his music. Stanley Kunitz&#x2014;two-time Poet Laureate, Pulitzer Prize winner, and founder of Poet&apos;s House&#x2014;once remarked that people constantly misjudged who he was because of his success (he always saw himself as a gardener first and foremost). There seems to be a similar disconnect for Malkmus: the popular narrative is that he&apos;s a slacker relic, but his aloofness masks just how much of a stylized, classic rock guitar God he&apos;s transformed into in recent years&#x2014;and it also masks just how much he cares about what he does, which was apparent last night.</p>
