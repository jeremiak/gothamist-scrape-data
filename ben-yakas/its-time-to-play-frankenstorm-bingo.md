<p>You&apos;re not going to be able to leave your apartment for the next couple days, thanks to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140206172139/http://gothamist.com/tags/frankenstorm">FRANKENSTORM</a> and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140206172139/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/27/mta_may_will_probably_shut_down_at.php">systemwide MTA shutdown</a> that was announced this morning. So you might as well get drunk, right? To that end, we&apos;ve updated out <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140206172139/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/26/play_hurricane_irene_bingo_drinking.php">Hurricane Irene Bingo</a> from last year, and given it a Sandy twist. It&apos;s guaranteed to make obsessively watching the news/refreshing your browser that much more entertaining. </p>
