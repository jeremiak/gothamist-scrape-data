<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170407061250/https://www.youtube.com/user/BadLipReading/videos">Bad Lip Reading</a> videos are timeless Internet treasures, whether they&apos;re turning <em>Game Of Thrones</em> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170407061250/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/16/video_game_of_thrones_transformed_i.php">into &quot;Medieval Land Fun Time World Park,&quot;</a> making whole NFL seasons <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170407061250/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w8n0L3uUCE">fly by</a>, or turning Trump&apos;s nightmare inauguration <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170407061250/http://gothamist.com/2017/01/25/trump_bad_lip_reading.php">into something viewable</a>. But they&apos;ve upped their game for their latest video, on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170407061250/http://gothamist.com/tags/starwars"><em>Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens</em></a>, by getting Luke Skywalker himself, Mark Hamill, to do the voice of Han Solo. He has more lines here than he did in the entire real movie!</p>

<p>Watch below as BLM reveals the alternative stories behind every character: BB-8 is really a demonic killing machine; Kylo Ren is really into finger puppets and quoting Buffalo Bill; Princess Leia loves fraps; Chewbacca is a neurotic babe magnet; everyone notices Snoke&apos;s genitals; and Admiral Ackbar is the most adorable creature in the galaxy. </p>
