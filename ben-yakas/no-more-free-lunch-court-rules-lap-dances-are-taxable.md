<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:260px; "> <img alt="61011showgirls.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629175852im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/61011showgirls.jpg" width="260" height="195"> <br> <i>Is this high art?</i></div> When you get a lap dance, do you ever catch yourself thinking, &quot;gee whiz, this really is a fantastic dramatic and/or musical art performance&quot;? Because according to a NY state appeals court, nobody thinks that way&#x2014;the court <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629175852/http://www.timesunion.com/local/article/Court-Lap-dances-aren-t-tax-exempt-1417984.php">has ruled that</a> private lap dances are not artistic performances, and are therefore not tax exempt. Try telling that to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629175852/http://www.nydailynews.com/gossip/galleries/divas_who_dominate/divas_who_dominate.html">Shakira</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629175852/http://popcrush.com/rihanna-loud-tour-lap-dance/">Rihanna</a>, and (NSFW) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629175852/http://www.metacafe.com/watch/839070/elizabeth_berkley_lap_dance_from_showgirls/">Nomi Malone</a>!<p></p>

<p>&quot;The record reflects that the clubs&apos; dancers are not required to have any formal dance training and...often rely upon videos or suggestions from other dancers to learn their craft,&quot; the judge <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629175852/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2011/06/10/2011-06-10_lap_dance_tax_court_says_erotic_dances_are_not_an_art_and_subject_to_state_sales.html">wrote in the ruling</a>. Nite Moves, an adult &quot;juice bar&quot; on Route 9 in Latham, NY has been fighting an audit since 2005; state officials found that the club owed nearly $125,000 in sales tax on door admission charges and private lap dance sales.</p>

<p>But the club argued that its dancers were &quot;dramatic or musical arts performances&quot; not subject to sales tax; in NY,  a sales tax must be paid on admission to or for the use of any place of amusement except for dramatic or musical arts performances. Nite Moves lawyer, Andrew McCullough, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629175852/http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/06/10/us-tax-lapdance-idUSTRE75953C20110610">told Reuters that</a> the company plans to appeal the decision: &quot;We brought in the foremost expert in the field. She is the one in this country who has made a complete and detailed study of the art of exotic dance and if they are not going to believe her I don&apos;t know who you believe.&quot;</p>
