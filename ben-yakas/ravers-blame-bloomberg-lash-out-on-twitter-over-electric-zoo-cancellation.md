<p>Earlier today, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150303142110/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/01/electric_zoos_last_day_cancelled_du.php">the city announced that</a> the final day of the Electric Zoo electronic music festival on Randall&apos;s Island has been cancelled after two people died and four others were hospitalized due to MDMA-related illnesses. While many people on social media expressed concern about the deaths and the rampant drug culture of electronic festivals, some were pissed off that the mayor&apos;s office &quot;ruined&quot; their fun. Below, take a frustrating stroll through the feeds of people who don&apos;t understand why everyone is getting in the way of their vibes&#x2014;including a lot of people who think Bloomberg is to blame.</p>
