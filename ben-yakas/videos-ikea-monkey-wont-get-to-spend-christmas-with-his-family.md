<p>Earlier this month, a little monkey wearing a smart coat <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161022113314/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/10/reminder_coat-wearing_ikea_monkey_i.php">was found wandering around an Ikea</a> in Toronto, Canada. We&apos;ll never know whether Darwin the monkey was looking for a Stenstorp kitchen cart or a Klingsbo coffee table, but we do know he won&apos;t get to crawl around any Expedit shelving systems this Christmas: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161022113314/http://www.thestar.com/news/gta/article/1305553%E2%80%94ikea-monkey-darwin-must-stay-at-sanctuary-for-christmas-judge-rules">A judge has ruled that</a> the monkey must stay at the sanctuary where it is now being held until at least mid-January. &#x201C;How would you feel to see your child in a cage and be with him outside the cage?&#x201D; said owner Yasmin Nakhuda&#x2019;s husband, Sam, outside court.</p>

<p>Justice Michael Brown denied a request for weekend visitation away from the sanctuary, but said the family could visit him there&#x2014;but the Nakhuda&apos;s were not having that. Sam told reporters that visiting the sanctuary would be &#x201C;damaging to Darwin. I don&#x2019;t know if human beings are capable of understanding this. I don&#x2019;t know if the judge is capable of understanding this,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;Darwin is not a dog, he&#x2019;s not a cat, he&#x2019;s not lizard. He&#x2019;s 93 per cent human DNA.&#x201D;</p>

<p>The judge definitely didn&apos;t understand that point: he called Darwin &#x201C;personal property&#x201D; and &#x201C;not a human being,&#x201D; and said the focus would be on &#x201C;preserving&#x201D; the property until a later date. Nakhuda was fined $240 (Canadian dollars) for keeping a prohibited animal.

But at least he can take comfort in knowing that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161022113314/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZKJKCNuUUg">Andy Serkis is doing everything he can</a> to change hearts and minds about monkeys.</p>
