										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="22411muppets.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160115074629im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/22411muppets.jpg" width="640" height="358" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>We&apos;ve been on an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160115074629/http://gothamist.com/tags/lcdsoundsystem">LCD Soundsystem</a> kick ever since the band announced their final show at MSG earlier this month. And all the ensuing chaos and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160115074629/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/21/lcd_soundsystem_ticketgeddon_now_wi.php">conspiracy theories</a> couldn&apos;t eclipse the fact that the band has made some pretty terrific music, including &quot;Dance Yrself Clean,&quot; the first track from their final album <em>This Is Happening</em>. An unofficial video was released today for the song, and it features the Muppets (and a young Cookie Monster) performing it to a delighted crowd of onlookers in Brighton, England. Directed by Javier Douglas, the piece also includes scenes of Animal and Cookie getting hammered on Kronenbourg on the beach. It&apos;s the rare video which makes the song even better. Check it out below:</p>

<p>Of course, this isn&apos;t the first time a Muppet has rocked out to an LCD Soundsystem song. The music video for the single &quot;New York I Love You But You&apos;re Bringing Me Down&quot; from their 2007 album <em>Sound of Silver</em> features a love-lorn and solitary Kermit singing the torch song at different locations around the city.</p>

<p>Were you able to get tickets to one of the four <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160115074629/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/12/lcd_soundsystem_fight_scalpers_with.php">added dates</a> at Terminal 5? Those shows sold out in less than an hour, according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160115074629/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/digest-lcd-soundsystem-sell-out-four-more-farewell-shows-dave-matthews-band-to-host-summer-music-festivals-20110222">Rolling Stone</a>. And because of some of the measures the band took to ensure there wouldn&apos;t be more scalper problems this time, there aren&apos;t any available on StubHub. But you can still get tickets to the MSG show <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160115074629/http://www.stubhub.com/lcd-soundsystem-tickets/lcd-soundsystem-new-york-4-2-2011-1051789/">on April 2</a> for a couple hundred (or thousand) dollars.</p>
