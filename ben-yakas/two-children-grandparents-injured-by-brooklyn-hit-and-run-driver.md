<p>Two children and their grandparents were seriously injured after a hit-and-run driver hit a livery driver during a crash in Brooklyn yesterday.</p>

<p>Police say the incident took place around 7 a.m. on Dewitt Avenue in East New York. The four victims, whose names haven&apos;t been released, were in the livery cab headed west on Dewitt when a woman driving a BMW swerved around a parked car and slammed into them. </p>

<p>The BMW driver kept going, hitting an SUV up the block; the impact was so strong the BMW ended up wedged underneath the other vehicle. According <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161107213254/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/hit-and-run-driver-injures-grandparents-2-kids-article-1.2688006">to the Daily News</a>, witnesses told police that the driver and a male passenger got out of the car and ran off.</p>

<p>&quot;They all ran from the accident,&quot; another witness <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161107213254/http://nypost.com/2016/06/25/two-injured-in-multi-car-crash-in-brooklyn/">told the Post</a>. &quot;The [neighbors] were trying to contain them, but they got away.&quot;</p>

<p>The two children, ages 3 and 10 according to the Post, and their grandparents were taken to Brookdale University Hospital in stable condition. Police say no arrests have been made, and the investigation is ongoing.</p>
