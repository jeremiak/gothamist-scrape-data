<p>You <em>don&apos;t</em> need Dr. Phil or Tony Robbins! Dylan&apos;s magical formula is just what many of us need to hear going into the next week: shut the fuck up and help someone out, you narcissistic piece of shit (our words, not his). Or as he more eloquently put it: &quot;Instead of adding to the sadness of the world, why not lend a hand, help somebody out. And not just on Christmas. Why don&apos;t you give it a try year-round?&quot; If that isn&apos;t quite enough of a nod in the right direction, just watch Dylan bounce around in wig and Santa hat&#x2014;this man KNOWS things.</p>
