Today, NJ Gov. Chris Christie defended NJ Transit&apos;s decision: &quot;We&apos;re supportive of the action taken by NJTransit,&quot; Christie spokesman Michael Drewniak <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150621161301/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/09/16/2010-09-16_christie_njtransit_right_to_can_koranburn_creep.html">told the Daily News.</a><p></p>

<p>Fenton was terminated for violating the NJ Transit code of ethics (reader MNS points to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150621161301/http://www.state.nj.us/ethics/docs/ethics/uniformcode.pdf ">this document</a>, although it&apos;s unclear if this is the guideline referred to by NJ Transit), though he was off-duty at the time. Despite his actions, some politicians are questioning whether Fenton&apos;s constitutional rights were violated: &quot;What he did was self-centered. He didn&#x2019;t care about anyone else but himself, and he put people lives in jeopardy, but it had nothing to do with his responsibilities on the job. And most importantly, it&#x2019;s protected by the First Amendment,&#x201D; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150621161301/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2010/09/15/burning-koran-pages-gets-worker-fired/">said State Sen. Ray Lesniak</a>, of Union County.</p>

There is now a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150621161301/http://www.facebook.com/home.php#!/pages/Help-Derek-Fenton/147335451970406?v=wall&amp;ref=ts">Facebook group</a> called &quot;Help Derek Fenton,&quot; where some Fenton supporters are trying to help him find a new job. And his neighbors are also defending him: &quot;Part of being in America is that you have freedom of religion, freedom of speech. Would I burn the Koran? No, because they are extremists, yes. But there are people who follow that are not like, but should not get fired over something &#x2026; I don&#x2019;t see how they could have violated his rights that way,&#x201D; said neighbor Christine Gaccione.</p>
