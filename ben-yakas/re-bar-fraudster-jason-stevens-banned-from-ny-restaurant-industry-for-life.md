<p>Earlier this month, infamous reBar owner <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429063402/http://gothamist.com/tags/jasonstevens">Jason Stevens</a> agreed to a plea deal that ensures he&apos;ll spend 3 1/3 to 10 years in prison for tax fraud. Stevens pled guilty to grand larceny and four counts of criminal tax fraud in the second degree after he allegedly didn&apos;t pay millions of dollars in taxes over the last couple years. And now, Stevens has been formally banned for life from the NY restaurant and catering industry.</p>

<p>&quot;[Stevens is] permanently enjoined from participating or engaging in any manner in the operation, ownership, control, management, or oversight of any restaurant, catering and/or reception hall, or food venue in the State of New York,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429063402/http://nypost.com/2014/07/02/rebar-owner-banned-from-restaurant-industry-for-life/">reads the order</a>, issued by Brooklyn Supreme Court justice Loren Bailey-Schiffman.</p>

<p>Stevens, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429063402/http://gothamist.com/2014/06/13/rebar_fraudster_jason_stevens_agree.php">who reportedly owes</a> around $6 million in taxes, has agreed to pay $1 million to couples who have filed complaints with the attorney general. The only problem is, he allegedly doesn&apos;t have any money&#x2014;and whatever he does have is expected to go to the government first. Attorney General Schneiderman did say that he will have liens filed against him for almost $1.1 million in restitution to 73 couples plus $64,000 in civil penalties and costs. But that&apos;s still barely half of the 200+ couples who were screwed when he suddenly shuttered the gastropub in late May.</p>

<p>On a more positive note: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429063402/http://www.littleredbeanproductions.com/">Little Red Bean Productions</a> teamed up with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429063402/http://www.theknot.com/">The Knot</a> to give a complete wedding to former reBar couple Ashleigh Holden and Eric Charlson, who lost around $15K to Stevens. They also honored former reBar event managers Tyler Lindsay and Katherine Cassell, who have been tirelessly working (often for free) to help couples salvage their weddings in the immediate aftermath of reBar&apos;s shuttering. Couples <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429063402/https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/help-the-canceled-rebar-weddings">who were raising money on Indiegogo</a> donated $1,800 to the two as a token of gratitude.</p>
