<p>At the end of a long day of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130519152809/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/14/video_fox_news_anchor_tucker_carlso.php">fly fishing</a>, you don&apos;t want to see people <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130519152809/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/12/video_man_shaves_on_the_subway_and.php">shaving on the subway</a>; you don&apos;t want to see <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130519152809/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/13/photo_why_you_should_care_about_sag.php">their butt cracks</a>, you don&apos;t want to hear them <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130519152809/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/06/video_preppy_drunk_racist_punishes.php">singing rap lyrics</a>, and you don&apos;t want to put up with some teens strumming Guster songs on their acoustic guitar. The aggravated older gentleman in the video below does his best to prevent said teens from getting their acoustic on, first by appealing to their humanity (&quot;I pay for transportation, not music!&quot;), and then by loudly singing a capella over them. </p>

<p>Somehow, two generations come together as the teens play along with the man as he sings, &quot;fuck you&quot; and &quot;shut up!&quot; It all ends with laughter and everyone having a surprisingly good time. We wonder whether the man would have been as aggravated about his subway ride if he had been faced with female robots:</p>
