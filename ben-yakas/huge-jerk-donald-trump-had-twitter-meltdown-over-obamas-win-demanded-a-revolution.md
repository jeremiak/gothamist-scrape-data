<p>At this point, it almost goes without saying that classy used car salesman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150910050045/http://gothamist.com/tags/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> is a completely irrelevant combover nightmare whose only skill is his inexplicable ability to keep himself in the public eye. And yet, when Trump starts calling for a revolution in the midst of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150910050045/https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump">a full-blown Twitter meltdown</a>, it seems like one of those times worth rehashing this stuff, the better to point and laugh. Even Brian Williams couldn&apos;t help but poke the bear (&quot;who has driven well past the last exit to relevance&quot;) live on NBC&#x2014;watch below.</p>

<p>In the sobering light of the day, Trump has had enough sense to delete some of his more incendiary tweets, including one in which he put on his Zapata hat <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150910050045/http://wilwheaton.tumblr.com/post/35185641646/if-you-read-this-from-the-bottom-up-you-can-watch">and declared</a>: &quot;He lost the popular vote by a lot and won the election. We should have a revolution in this country!&quot; But the people weren&apos;t ready for those truth bombs&#x2014;here are some of the bright and cheery tweets he didn&apos;t delete. SPOILER ALERT: R.I.P. Democracy, Nov. 6, 2012.</p>

<p>Sadly, Trump <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150910050045/http://gawker.com/5958376/i-cant-stop-crying-america-died-donald-trump-and-victoria-jackson-melt-down-on-twitter">can still look at Victoria Jackson</a> and know he didn&apos;t have the most undignified Twitter breakdown last night. But this morning, it seem Trump caught wind of Williams&apos; diss, and paused from his diatribes about the end of America to rail against that &quot;boring&quot; &quot;dummy:&quot; </p>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>Brian Williams was never a smart guy but always passes himself off as such.

<p>Trump&apos;s allegiance with Republican candidate Mitt Romney is detailed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150910050045/http://www.buzzfeed.com/mckaycoppins/the-donald-problem">in this great Buzzfeed feature</a>: A Trump source said of The Donald, &quot;He played very well with blue-collar-type Republicans, and the campaign saw that. If you have no education, and you work with your hands, you like him. It&apos;s like, &apos;Wow, if I was rich that&apos;s how I would live! The girls, the cars, the fancy suits. His ostentatiousness is appealing to them.&quot;</p>
