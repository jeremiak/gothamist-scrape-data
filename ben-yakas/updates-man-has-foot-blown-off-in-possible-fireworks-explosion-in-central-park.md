<p>The FDNY confirmed that the man had a &quot;partial amputation&quot; around 10:50 a.m. in the park near 5th Avenue and E 68th Street. Initial reports and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025130031/https://twitter.com/AlexSilverman/status/749623881040687104">witnesses at the scene</a> indicate he lost his foot (and possibly part of his leg) in the explosion. Some witnesses claim it was a firework that caused it; one witness <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025130031/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2016/07/03/central-park-explosion/">told CBS</a> that the man &quot;was climbing a rock structure and stepped on something that &apos;exploded.&apos;&quot;</p>

Another witness said he tried to keep the victim conscious after the explosion: &quot;I saw his friends standing there panicking,&quot; said John Murphy. &quot;I saw the young man laying on the grass. His foot is all but gone. His friends claimed he was walking down the rocks and he stepped on it. It looks like there was an explosion.&quot;</p>
