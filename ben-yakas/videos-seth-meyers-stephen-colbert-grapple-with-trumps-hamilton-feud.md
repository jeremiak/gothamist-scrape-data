<p>Pundits have been torn on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161124181440/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/19/mike_pence_gets_booed_at_hamilton_w.php#photo-1">Donald Trump/<em>Hamilton</em> feud</a> which dominated the news cycle this weekend: was it a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161124181440/http://www.vox.com/2016/11/19/13685762/donald-trump-hamilton-distraction">purposeful distraction</a> from Trump&apos;s real scandals (including the Trump University <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161124181440/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/18/president-elect_trump_may_settle_tr.php">fraud settlement</a>, his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161124181440/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/19/foreign_diplomats_lining_up_to_stay.php">conflict-of-interest business dealings</a> while President-elect, and selections of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161124181440/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/18/wtf_is_happening_here.php">racists</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161124181440/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/18/wtf_is_happening_here.php">Satan-lovers</a> to his cabinet), or an important gesture packed with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161124181440/http://www.vulture.com/2016/11/why-the-hamilton-pence-incident-matters.html">big, ominous meaning</a>? Seth Meyers came down on the former side, calling it &quot;a distraction from a far bigger story...that will one day be told in the hit Donald Trump musical, <em>Scamilton</em>.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You may recall that a common criticism of the Clintons was how they enriched themselves financially <em>after</em> leaving office,&quot; he said. &quot;Well, Trump is proving yet again that he is the anti-Clinton by enriching himself <em>before</em> he takes office.&quot; Check it out below.</p>

<p>After tackling the Trump University settlement, Stephen Colbert also got into the <em>Hamilton</em> incident, and seemed to take it a bit more seriously&#x2014;especially the terrors of the theater: &quot;First of all, Mr. Trump, the only president who gets to complain about the theater is Lincoln,&quot; he said. &quot;Second, I don&#x2019;t know where you got this idea that the theater is safe. I&#x2019;ve seen <em>Cats.</em> You think you&#x2019;re safe, but then all the cat people start coming off the stage and try to sit in your lap and crawl up the walls! President Trump: Build the Fourth Wall!&quot;</p>

<p>Colbert then premiered his own hip-hop musical take on the incident to teach future generations about the feud: &quot;How does an orange bully, son of a bitch and a con man/ grabbing pussy with Gary Busey, no taxes evident/ grow up to be a hero and the president?&quot;</p>
