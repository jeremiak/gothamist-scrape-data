<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161104032936/http://gothamist.com/tags/conanobrien">Conan O&apos;Brien</a> doesn&apos;t normally get the kind of headlines he did six years ago when TeamCoco was all the rage, but he&apos;s been quietly making <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161104032936/https://theringer.com/the-talk-show-that-time-forgot-e6cf1bbcaab">consistently good</a> late night television since his move to TBS (and occasionally reaching the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161104032936/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Za8BtLgKv8">surrealist heights</a> of his best work). So we were quite excited to see how he did this week as he returned to NYC for some <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161104032936/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/08/conan_obrien_is_doing_a_week_of_fre.php">free shows at the Apollo Theater</a>&#x2014;and last night&apos;s first episode, in which Conan walked around the streets of Harlem getting to know people, buying bootleg CDs, and getting a makeover, was a winner.</p>

<p>One of those &quot;great neighbors&quot; Conan met was Viviane, whom he then invited onstage during the show to belt some Stevie Wonder. </p>
