Well, there&apos;s a new name to be added to the Donald&apos;s web of tackiness: a real estate mogul with ties to Trump has been arrested under suspicion of involvement with an international high-class prostitution ring. Yes, the man who pimps out <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161101184834/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/05/apprentice_auditions_drew_ex-wall_s.php">desperate Wall Street guys</a> on <em>The Apprentice </em> may be buddies with a real-life pimp. It&apos;s called street cred.<p></p>

<p>Tevfik Arif, 57, is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161101184834/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/2010/10/01/2010-10-01_donald_trump_pal_tevfik_arif_busted_in_turkey_for_allegedly_running_hooker_ring_.html">accused of setting up</a> trysts between wealthy businessmen and Eastern European models, some of whom were underage, aboard a $60 million yacht which was once used by the Turkish leader Mustafa Ataturk. Businessmen reportedly paid $3,000 to $10,000 per night to bed Russian and Ukranian prostitutes aboard the 450-foot luxury yacht named the Savarona. Ten models, two of whom were underage, were detained by police, along with ten other men reportedly involved with the ring.</p>

<p>Arif founded the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161101184834/http://bayrockgroup.com/">Bayrock Group</a>, which co-developed the Trump SoHo and the Trump International Hotel and Tower in Fort Lauderdale. Bayrock also developed the Trump International Hotel and Tower Phoenix, the Waterpointe, a residential development in Whitestone, Queens, and the Riverhead Resorts in Suffolk County, L.I. There are also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161101184834/http://www.patrickmcmullan.com/site/search.aspx?t=person&amp;s=Tevfik+Arif">photos online</a> from the 2007 launch party for the Trump SoHo Hotel, showing Trump and Arif together, along with Trump&apos;s children  Eric, Donald Jr., and Ivanka. A spokesman for Trump said he hasn&apos;t talked to Arif &quot;in years.&quot;</p>
