<p>This week, debunked doomsday prognosticator Harold Camping popped up from suspended animation <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111018082634/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/12/the_rapture_always_knocks_twice_jud.php">to remind us that</a> the Rapture was coming on October 21 (only 7 days left!). But in this thoroughly depressing picture above, it seems that Judgment Day has come early for noted Christian evangelist Kirk Cameron. The <em>Left Behind</em> auteur turned 41 on Wednesday&#x2014;but it seems all his candles have ascended to the heavens...along with drinks...and anything resembling joy. </p>

<p>The more you examine the picture, the more depressing it gets: the woman hovering by the door. The half-eaten sub. The single candle. &quot;We couldn&apos;t find any champagne, but we did find this one bottle of orange juice!&quot; The only thing left behind were those darn Subway sandwiches. What, nobody could find any of God&apos;s graceful, perfectly shaped bananas?</p>
