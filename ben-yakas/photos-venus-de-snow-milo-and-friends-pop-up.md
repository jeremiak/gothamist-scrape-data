</div></div>					<p>Earlier today, we <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406160138/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/27/12000_words_on_last_nights_snow.php">oohed and aahed</a> at pretty photographs from last night&apos;s surprisingly substantial storm. Along with the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406160138/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/27/flaming_cars_all_around.php">burning cars</a>, narwhal <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406160138/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/27/snow_migration.php">sightings</a>, and scantily clad <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406160138/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/27/scantily_clad_nyu_co-eds_strip_down.php">co-eds</a>, we&apos;ve been impressed by many of the snowmen that have been crafted during this storm, including an especially impressive rendering of Venus de SnowMilo on 47th St between 1st and 2nd ave. in Manhattan, made by reader Lawrence. </p>

<p>If you have any more pictures of snowmen, snowwomen, or any snowcreatures, you can tag them as  &quot;gothamist&quot; on flickr or send them to us at photos@gothamist.com. </p>
