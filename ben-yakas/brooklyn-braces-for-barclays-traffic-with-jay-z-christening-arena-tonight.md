<p>Tonight is the big opening night at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505163204/http://gothamist.com/tags/barclayscenter">Barclays Center</a>&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505163204/http://gothamist.com/tags/jayz">Jay-Z</a> plays the first of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505163204/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/09/jay-zs_brooklyn_concert_dates_septe.php">three concerts</a> tonight to christen the big arena in the middle of Brooklyn. And as was expected, along with big name concerts and a basketball team comes massive amounts of traffic congestion. Oh, and there are also some small protests in the area, AND who knows what&apos;s going on with the weather today. So driving in Brooklyn right now would be really, really stupid.</p>

<p>There&apos;s a major gridlock alert in place for the areas near Barclays. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505163204/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Barclays-Gridlock-Alert-Jay-Z-Downtown-Brooklyn-Mass-Transit-Driver-171640631.html">According to NBC</a>, drivers should avoid Flatbush Avenue from Tillary Street to Grand Army Plaza, and Atlantic Avenue from the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway to Bedford Avenue, as well as streets near the Manhattan and Brooklyn Bridges. So this is what every weekend in Prospect Heights/Park Slope/Downtown Brooklyn is going to be like from now on! </p>

<p>In addition to the gridlock, there&apos;s an Occupy Wall Street Guitarmy sit-in in response to Jay-Z saying some negative things about the movement <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505163204/http://gothamist.com/2012/09/09/jay-z_confused_by_occupy_wall_stree.php">earlier this month</a>; there&apos;s also a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505163204/http://www.aycrimescene.com/node/5">&quot;virtual rally&quot;</a> against the arena, although that obviously won&apos;t affect your commute. Thankfully, if you are going to the show tonight, or you&apos;re unlucky enough to live nearby the arena, you have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505163204/http://gothamist.com/2012/09/18/check_out_these_photos_of_the_new_b.php#photo-1">that slick new subway entrance</a> which was recently <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505163204/http://gothamist.com/2012/09/21/photos_video_welcome_to_barclays_ce.php#photo-1">given Mayor Bloomberg&apos;s blessing</a>: &quot;There is as much mass transit under this building than there is under any place in NYC, even in Manhattan.&quot;</p>
