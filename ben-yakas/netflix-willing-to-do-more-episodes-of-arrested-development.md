Whether you binged on all 15 episodes Sunday morning or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130809082359/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/28/did_the_arrested_development_reviva.php">watched two episodes and raised your hook in disappointment</a>, you probably have an opinion about the long-awaited new season of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130809082359/http://gothamist.com/tags/arresteddevelopment"><em>Arrested Development</em></a>. There have already been episode recaps, comparisons to seasons past, roundups of the best jokes, diatribes about the missed opportunities and stilted pacing. As creator <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130809082359/https://twitter.com/MitchHurwitz/status/339531275817865216">Mitch Hurwitz noted</a> though, &quot;even those not into it are so positive!&quot; This has been a grand experiment in television making and viewing, whether you were disappointed or elated by the new episodes&#x2014;there&apos;s no doubt that the Bluth&apos;s story isn&apos;t done, and there should be more AD. And Netflix has now gone back on their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130809082359/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/25/netflix_will_only_produce_one_seaso.php">wary earlier statements</a> and said they would gladly produce more episodes.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130809082359/http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2013/05/29/netflix-willing-to-make-more-episodes-of-arrested-development/?mod=WSJBlog">On CNBC this morning</a>, Netflix CEO Reed Hastings said that the company would be interested in doing a fifth season of AD, but it wasn&#x2019;t just up to them. &#x201C;<em>Arrested</em> is unique, because that&#x2019;s really up to the talent. If the talent were willing to do more, and interested in that, I&#x201D;m sure we would be willing.&#x201D; </p>

<p>The AD cast and crew have long said this 4th season was really Act 1 of a story that would lead directly into a full AD movie. But as Maeby says in her POV episode (&quot;Senioritis&quot;) as a parallel to the final line of the original series finale (Season 3&apos;s &quot;Development Arrested&quot;), maybe AD really does work better as a TV show. And maybe with enough time to plan these things out, the cast can work their schedules out to make sure they can all be in the same place at the same time, instead of relying on green screens, guest stars and sweat lodges.</p>

<p>Because the key question of the fourth season seems to be: what happens to these ridiculous people when they no longer have family to rely on, to act as their checks and balances? And for a show whose comedic heart beat hardest due to the interactions between the nine core Bluth members, that question on a macro level becomes: what happens to the show when it no longer has those family dynamics to rely on? As anyone who has watched the new episodes knows, it becomes something very different (but no less unique). But that&apos;s a discussion for another day (after I finish the final few episodes of the season).<br>
