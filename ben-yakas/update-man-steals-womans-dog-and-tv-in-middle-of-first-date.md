<p>Dating is, categorically, stupid: if your date isn&apos;t <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140423012739/http://gothamist.com/2014/03/19/queens_man_sues_okcupid_after_date.php">swindling you</a> out of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140423012739/http://gothamist.com/2014/04/05/cancer_survivor_says_she_was_conned.php">thousands of dollars</a>, then they&apos;re probably <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140423012739/http://gothamist.com/2014/04/02/spurned_okcupid_date_steals_womans.php">stealing from you</a>. But it&apos;s one thing to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140423012739/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/29/recession_tip_make_matchcom_suckers.php">use someone for a free meal</a>, and another thing to steal a woman&apos;s dog AND her TV in the middle of their first date.</p>

<p>According <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140423012739/http://www.dailyrecord.com/article/20140418/NJNEWS/304180037/Dover-woman-s-dog-TV-stolen-during-first-date?nclick_check=1">to The Daily Record of Parsippany</a>, a NJ woman told cops she met &quot;Joel&quot; on a dating website, and went on a first date with him this past Thursday. The woman told officials that Joel was at her house and she became &quot;occupied in another room,&quot; leaving him alone for a little bit. When she re-entered the room, Joel was gone, and had taken her Yorkie Violet and her flat-screen TV. The TV is valued at $3,000 and the dog at $4,000. And that doesn&apos;t even factor in the emotional cost of deflated pride and hurt feelings, which has got to be worse than <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140423012739/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/26/ny_times_a_bad_credit_score_is_like.php">a bad credit score.</a> </p>

<p>The woman, whose name hasn&apos;t been released, believes Joel might live in Elizabeth, NJ. Joel is described as Hispanic and about 5 feet 9 inches tall. He wore a black hooded jacket, blue jeans and black boots on the date. His vehicle was described as &quot;a gold-colored Mercedes, possibly from 2004 or 2005, with black and beige leather interior and tinted windows.&quot; On the bright side...at least he wasn&apos;t interested in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140423012739/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/25/photos_cannibal_cop_called_himself.php#photo-1">more than her dog and TV</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: Here&apos;s a mostly happy ending: the woman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140423012739/http://www.dailyrecord.com/article/20140419/NJNEWS14/304190028/Dog-and-TV-stolen-during-first-date-returned-to-Dover-home-Saturday">told cops</a> that her dog had been tied, by its leash, to the television and left in the front yard of her home sometime yesterday. Cops now know the real identity of &quot;Joel,&quot; and charges could still be filed in the incident, pending his cooperation in the case. </p>
