<p>An NYPD officer was injured in the line of duty last night when he was struck by an airborne bike in Brooklyn. According to cops, they were responding to reports of shots fired in front of 959 St. Mark&#x2019;s Avenue near Albany Avenue just after 2 a.m. Sunday. Apparently, debris started being thrown from some of the upper floors onto them&#x2014;including a bike.</p>

He was taken to Kings County Hospital in serious condition, where he needed stitches to close the wound. Two other officers were injured when a fight broke out as they were arresting the suspected gunman. </p>

<p>Cops are unsure whether the person who threw the bike was arrested, which probably means the person wasn&apos;t. It&apos;s also unclear whether cops were attempting to do any field interviews at the time.</p>
