<p>Since they <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502140022/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/29/videos_arcade_fire_unveil_new_disco.php">took over</a> <em>Saturday Night Live</em> a few weeks ago and premiered a bunch of new songs during a surreal 22 minute music/comedy special, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502140022/http://gothamist.com/tags/arcadefire">Arcade Fire</a> have been a little quiet. A little <em>too</em> quiet, considering that their highly-anticipated new album <em>Reflektor</em> is due to be released in just a few weeks. But it seems the publicity machine is starting up again: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502140022/http://www.brooklynvegan.com/archives/2013/10/arcade_fire_aka.html">Brooklyn Vegan spotted</a> the above flyer this weekend in Red Hook. Arcade Fire Tube <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502140022/https://twitter.com/ArcadeFiretube/status/389383938306629632">confirms it</a>: &quot;It&apos;s definitely happening. Got confirmation from Arcade Fire&apos;s management. Only question is where.&quot;</p>

<p>So you better start planning out your costume. In the meantime, re-watch that bizarre special below, and appreciate Michael Cera:</p>
