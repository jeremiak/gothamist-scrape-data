<p>Yesterday, Dylan Farrow opened up in public for the first time <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501174741/http://gothamist.com/2014/02/01/dylan_farrow_writes_open_letter_abo.php">about allegedly being sexually abused</a> by adoptive father <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501174741/http://gothamist.com/tags/woodyallen">Woody Allen</a>. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501174741/http://www.tmz.com/2014/02/02/woody-allen-dylan-farrow-child-molestation-knicks-game/">TMZ caught up</a> with Allen (along with daughter Manzie Tio) after last night&apos;s Knicks loss at MSG, and tried to ask him about the piece. As you can see in the video below, an uncomfortable-looking Allen ignores his questions, then fiddles with his smartphone.</p>

<p>Allen&apos;s lawyer, Elkan Abramowitz, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501174741/http://www.motherjones.com/mixed-media/2014/02/dylan-farrow-woody-allen-open-letter-nytimes-sexual-abuse">sent Mother Jones the following statement</a>: &quot;It is tragic that after 20 years a story engineered by a vengeful lover resurfaces after it was fully vetted and rejected by independent authorities. The one to blame for Dylan&apos;s distress is neither Dylan nor Woody Allen.&quot; Retired Litchfield County state attorney Frank Maco <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501174741/http://nypost.com/2014/02/02/statute-of-limitations-means-woody-allen-cant-be-prosecuted/">told AP</a> that the statute of limitations on the accusations ran out at least 15 years ago.</p>

<p>&quot;Woody Allen is a living testament to the way our society fails the survivors of sexual assault and abuse,&quot; Farrow wrote in the column <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501174741/http://kristof.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/02/01/an-open-letter-from-dylan-farrow/">for the NY Times.</a> Farrow also called out other celebrities, such as Cate Blanchett, Louis C.K., Diane Keaton and Alec Baldwin, in the piece for continuing to work with Allen. Baldwin initially responded to people tweeting at him about it, but those have since been deleted&#x2014;all that is left are the two RTs below he made.</p>
