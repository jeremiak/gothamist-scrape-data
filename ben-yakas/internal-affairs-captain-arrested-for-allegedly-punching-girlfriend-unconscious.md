Nicole McFarlane, 38, at her Queens home at 1:43 a.m. yesterday. McFarlane said Wright twice kicked the driver-side door, then hit her so hard she was knocked out. She woke up as cops were transporting her to Jamaica Hospital; her left eye and jaw were swollen and bruised.<p></p>

<p>McFarlane allegedly initially told cops that a stranger in a black Explorer had gotten out and punched her, but surveillance video showed there were discrepancies in her account of the incident. She later admitted it was Wright. &#x201C;I know I f--ked up. I know I shouldn&#x2019;t have done that,&#x201D; Wright told cops as he was being arrested, according to court documents. </p>

<p>He has been charged with third-degree assault, criminal mischief and harassment; he has also been suspended without pay. The Post adds that Wright, a 16-year NYPD veteran, helped oversee the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319100608/http://gothamist.com/tags/ticketfixing">massive Bronx ticket-fixing scandal</a>.</p>
