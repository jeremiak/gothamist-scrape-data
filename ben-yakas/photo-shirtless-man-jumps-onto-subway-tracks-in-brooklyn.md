<p>A shirtless man jumped onto the subway tracks in Brooklyn early this morning, bringing service to a standstill. According to the MTA, the D/N/Q trains were delayed last night around 1:15 a.m. due to a police investigation at DeKalb Avenue. An FDNY spokesman confirmed that they received a call about an emotionally disturbed person, whom they transported to Methodist Hospital. The NYPD press office had no information about the incident, but multiple people tweeted about the man jumping onto the train tracks&#x2014;and one uploaded the photo you can see above.</p>

<p>We contacted the MTA for more information, but they said they were too busy dealing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130915221123/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/13/power_outage_at_west_81st_st_stops.php">with another subway incident</a> to be able to help. We can respect that. For what it&apos;s worth, there was at least one fully naked person spotted at a subway station yesterday: </p>
