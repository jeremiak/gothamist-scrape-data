<p>Oh hey, everything just got completely ominous outside, like that moment in <em>Antichrist</em> when the disemboweled fox starts talking. Will chaos reign? According <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428150400/http://forecast.weather.gov/showsigwx.php?warnzone=NYZ072&amp;warncounty=NYC061&amp;firewxzone=NYZ072&amp;local_place1=&amp;product1=Severe+Thunderstorm+Warning">to the National Weather Service</a>, kind of: NYC is under severe thunderstorm warning for the afternoon. That means there&apos;ll be strong winds, heavy rains, and flooding. At least you have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428150400/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/11/spend_the_rest_of_your_day_playing.php">a fun Gatsby game to play</a> while you wait this one out.</p>
