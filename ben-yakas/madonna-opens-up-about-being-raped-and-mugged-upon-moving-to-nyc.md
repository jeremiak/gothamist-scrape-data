<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203074831/http://gothamist.com/tags/madonna">Madonna</a> opened up in an intimate new essay about being raped and mugged when she first moved to NYC back in the late &apos;70s. &quot;New York wasn&apos;t everything I thought it would be,&quot; Madonna writes <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203074831/http://www.harpersbazaar.com/magazine/cover/madonna-interview-1113?click=pp">in the November 2013 issue of Harper&#x2019;s Bazaar</a>. &quot;It did not welcome me with open arms. <strong>The first year, I was held up at gunpoint. Raped on the roof of a building I was dragged up to with a knife in my back, and had my apartment broken into three times</strong>. I don&apos;t know why; I had nothing of value after they took my radio the first time.&quot;</p>

<p>Madonna first moved to NYC in 1978 around the age of 20. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203074831/http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/gossip/madonna-raped-knifepoint-article-1.1476599">According to</a> Lucy O&#x2019;Brien, author of the  2007 biography &#x201C;Madonna: Like an Icon,&#x201D; she didn&apos;t report the rape, though it left her &#x201C;crying and shaking on the roof.&quot; O&apos;Brien also posits that Madonna used the terrible experience as fuel for her ambitions: &#x201C;Her anger at the attack came out afterward in a need for complete sexual control,&#x201D; O&#x2019;Brien said. &#x201C;Sex became a mask, a way of psychologically turning the tables on her attacker...She encountered her own worst possible scenario, becoming a victim of male violence, and thereafter turned that full-tilt into her work, reversing the equation at every opportunity.&quot;</p>

<p>Madonna writes more about her initial impressions of NYC, how she paid rent by posing nude for art classes, and how she had to &quot;dare&quot; herself every day to keep going in her attempts to become a professional dancer:</p>

<blockquote>The tall buildings and the massive scale of New York took my breath away. The sizzling-hot sidewalks and the noise of the traffic and the electricity of the people rushing by me on the streets was a shock to my neurotransmitters. I felt like I had plugged into another universe. I felt like a warrior plunging my way through the crowds to survive. Blood pumping through my veins, I was poised for survival. I felt alive.

<p>But I was also scared shitless and freaked out by the smell of piss and vomit everywhere, especially in the entryway of my third-floor walk-up.</p></blockquote><p></p>
