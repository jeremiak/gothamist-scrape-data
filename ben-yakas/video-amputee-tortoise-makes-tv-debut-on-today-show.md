<p>Meet Gamera, a 12-year-old, African spur-thighed tortoise whose leg had suffered a severe thermal injury and tissue damage. So doctors from Washington State University&apos;s College of Veterinary Medicine <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507102159/http://wsunews.wsu.edu/pages/publications.asp?Action=Detail&amp;PublicationID=26782&amp;TypeID=25">amputated his left front leg</a>, and gave him a prosthetic wheel, making him the world&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507102159/http://www.care2.com/greenliving/yu-chan-bionic-turtle-video.html">second bionic turtle</a>. And this morning, he made his television debut on the <em>Today</em> show. Watch the little guy wheel around below:</p>

<p>Gamera&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507102159/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamera">named after</a> the fictional giant, flying turtle from a popular series of Japanese giant monster films produced in 1965. He&apos;s three pounds heavier than he was before the operation, but the tortoise now has a chance to outlive us all! But as Dr. Nickol Finch notes in the video, just because you&apos;ve been through a traumatic experience doesn&apos;t mean that other tortoises are going to like you. It&apos;s a tough world out there for a bionic reptile, so Gamera better learn not to give a hoot, just like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507102159/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3Hl4V9uDPU">this bird did.</a></p>
