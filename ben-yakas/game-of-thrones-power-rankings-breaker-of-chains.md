This week, Littlefinger was creepy, Margaery was confused, and Tywin got to multitasking. GOT is all about how people jockey for power, so click through for our season 4 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504194840/http://gothamist.com/tags/gameofthronespowerrankings">Game of Thrones Power Rankings.</a></p>

<p><strong>Game Of Thrones Power Rankings, Week 3:</strong></p>

<p><strong>1. Tywin Lannister:</strong> A very strong episode for Tywin, who mourned for his grandson in his own way: by immediately moving on and taking Tommen under his (manipulative) wing, teaching him about the birds and bees, and forging a new alliance with Dorne.</p>

<p><strong>2. Daenerys Targaryen:</strong> Micturating warriors aside, this was a classic Dany ending for GOT, yet another moment of triumph for the Mother Of Dragons, Breaker Of Chains. It subverted expectations by withholding an episode-ending battle, but also felt somewhat underwhelming compared to some of her past triumphs. But perhaps that is the point: she doesn&apos;t need to use her dragons necessarily to flex her muscles. </p>

<p><strong>3. Queen of Thorns/Olenna Tyrell:</strong> Tywin talks about the importance of wisdom&#x2014;and no one is wiser than the Queen of Thorns. And few can wring as much emotion out of a line like, &quot;There he was lying on a table.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>4. Red Viper/Prince Oberyn Martell:</strong> Oberyn lays out his philosophy succinctly: &quot;Make sure you fucked your fill before <em>that</em> day.&quot; Oberyn hates Lannisters and is a passionate practitioner of polyamory&#x2014;but with his role in the trial and the small council, he&apos;s becoming more integrated into life at King&apos;s Landing...which can only end badly. </p>

<p><strong>5. Littlefinger:</strong> It&apos;s been a long time since we last saw Littlefinger (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504194840/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/06/game_of_thrones_power_rankings_the.php">&quot;The Climb,&quot;</a> the sixth episode of season 3, when he was sailing for the Vale of Arryn), so...did he always whisper so much? And doesn&apos;t it seem very convenient that he was ready to whisk Sansa away right after Joffrey&apos;s death?</p>

<p><strong>6. Margaery Tyrell:</strong> &quot;One of my husbands preferred the company of men and was stabbed through the heart, another was happiest torturing animals and was poisoned at our wedding feast. I must be cursed.&quot; Her grandmother is right: her circumstances <em>have</em> improved remarkably.</p>

<p><strong>7. Cersei Lannister:</strong> She is convinced Tyrion killed Joffrey, ignoring his basic decent nature and the funky smell of the set-up because she can only view the world through her prism&#x2014;of course she thinks everyone is as ruthless and miserable as her. Also interesting: was this the first time she acknowledged her and Jamie&apos;s parentage out loud? </p>

<p><strong>8. Tommen Lannister:</strong> Hey, the Rickon of the Lannisters is now the new king! Time to start paying attention to him!</p>

<p><strong>9. The Thenns:</strong> &quot;I&apos;m going to eat your dead momma and I&apos;m going to eat your dead poppa.&quot; In an episode filled with uncomfortable (Littlefinger/Sansa), cynical (The Hound/Arya) or disturbing occurrences (Jaime/Cersei), they still stand out as the most gruesome characters around.</p>

<p><strong>10. Stannis Baratheon:</strong> Stannis (and his storyline) has been stuck in a holding pattern since the battle of the Blackwater, but hopefully things will start moving forward now that Ser Davos has decided to forge his boss&apos; name. Stannis does sum himself up nicely with one line: &quot;I will not become a page in somebody else&apos;s history book.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>11. Jon Snow:</strong> People are starting to turn to him for leadership&#x2014;after all, he&apos;s only one who knows how totally screwed the Watchers of the Wall are right now.</p>

<p><strong>12. Daario Naharis:</strong> Daario 2.0 finally stands out&#x2014;by pulling an Indiana Jones.</p>

<p><strong>13. Jaime Lannister:</strong> &quot;Why have the gods made me love a hateful woman?&quot; And with that, we have the single most disturbing, horrible scene of the season thus far. Jaime has becoming a significantly better person since the last time he was in King&apos;s Landing, but this is a sobering reminder that he may never totally be redeemable.</p>

<p><strong>14. The Hound:</strong> It seems his charms has its limits: he throws out his &quot;code&quot; like that, because the world is a cruel place and he sure knows it. &quot;I just understand the way things are. How many Starks they got to be behead before you figure it out?&quot;</p>

<p><strong>15. Arya Stark:</strong> Arya may think The Hound is the worst shit in the Seven Kingdoms, but we know for sure that he isn&apos;t. We wouldn&apos;t be surprised if we heard her regurgitating his words in a season or two.</p>

<p><strong>16. Tyrion Lannister:</strong> Even when he&apos;s locked up, abandoned by his friends &amp; family, and forced to send his one loyal squire away, he still gets some of the funniest lines of the episode: &quot;Say what you will of Cersei, she loves her children. She is the only one I&apos;m certain has nothing to do with this murder, which makes it unique as King&apos;s Landing murders go.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>The Viserys Targaryen Memorial Least Powerful Person Of The Week Award: </strong>  Good for <strong>Samwell Tarly</strong>, doing the right thing by his beloved Gilly. Just because he&apos;s powerless to stop his fellow brothers from lying awake at night picturing her doesn&apos;t mean he&apos;s not a Good Guy. </p>

<p><strong>The Joffrey Baratheon Good Riddance Award:</strong> <strong>Joffrey</strong> is still dead, so this one&apos;s easy.</p>

<p><iframe width="640" height="480" src="//web.archive.org/web/20150504194840if_/http://www.youtube.com/embed/qYNeT2nzEgA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p><strong>The Hodoriffic Honorary Minor Character Of The Week Award:</strong> Never has there lived a more loyal squire than the future <strong>Ser Podrick Payne</strong>. </p>

<p><strong>Rickon Watch 2014: Is Rickon Still On This Show? </strong> Remember that time  Robb wanted to say goodbye to Rickon before heading to King&apos;s Landing in Season 1, and he couldn&apos;t find him, so he just left? That&apos;s the story of Rickon&apos;s life.</p>

<p><strong>The Remember Roz Sexposition Quotient: </strong> After a mostly boob-free episode last week, we&apos;re hit with our most graphic orgy yet, with five writhing, naked bodies chit chatting and butt slapping. As Oberyn puts it, &quot;When it comes to war I fight for Dorne. When it comes to love, I don&apos;t choose sides.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Way Beyond The Wall:</strong> Considering how (relatively) focused last week&apos;s episode was, this was a <em>very</em> sprawling episode, and we got to see almost every major storyline. Even so, we still didn&apos;t have enough time to see Bran&apos;s crew, no sign of the Boltons/Freys (and Reek), and The Brotherhood Without Banners remains MIA. Mance Rayder? I hardly know her.</p>

<p>Until next week, let&apos;s revisit last week&apos;s big death with a compilation of people&apos;s reactions:</p>
