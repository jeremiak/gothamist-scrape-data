<p>Police <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522151635/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local/new_york&amp;id=7964551">arrested</a> 62 people in the past 24 hours as part of a massive undercover drug bust in Queens. Since last August, police have purchased (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522151635/http://queensda.org/newpressreleases/2011/february/baisley%20park_rochdale%20village%20II_02_16_2011.pdf">pdf</a>) over $100,000 worth of crack cocaine, heroin, marijuana, oxycodone, ecstasy and BZP from the suspects, who range in age from 16 to 62, as part of &quot;Operation Stampede.&quot; </p>

<p>The suspects were members of nine affiliated crews (including &quot;Team New $,&quot; &quot;Weed Crew&quot; and &quot;Get $ Crew&quot;), and based in two Jamaica, Queens housing complexes (the Baisley Park Housing Development and Rochdale Village). Queens District Attorney Richard Brown <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522151635/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2011/02/17/2011-02-17_cops_bust_up_drug_ring_terrorizing_two_queens_housing_complexes_in_operation_sta.html">added that</a> thirty three of the purchases came within 1,000 feet from local school MS 72: </p>

<blockquote>&#x201C;The vast majority of the residents of these two housing complexes are decent, hard-working citizens who have been virtually held hostage by the gangster lifestyle of a relatively few individuals who are alleged to have operated with near impunity - <strong>allegedly selling a cornucopia of illegal drugs in their building stairwells and in the parking lots of a nearby fast food restaurant and pharmacy, while a seemingly defiant ten are alleged to have sold their illicit products near neighboring schools on more than thirty separate occasions.</strong>&#x201D; </blockquote>

<p>Altogether, police <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522151635/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/queens/undercover_sting_nets_drug_dealers_VVDjjigXePjLW0Epy9QHwM">seized</a> 60 pounds of marijuana, stashes of other drugs, $30,000 in cash, eight firearms and six cars in the bust. Fourteen people have been indicted and charged with criminal sale of controlled substance, criminal possession of a weapon and criminal sale of a weapon, and could face up to 25 years in prison.</p>
