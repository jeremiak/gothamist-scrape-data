<p>Everything this week has been coming up pizza, thanks to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502140011/http://gothamist.com/2013/12/07/hear_macaulay_culkins_pizza-obsesse.php">anti-folk band The Pizza Underground</a>, a group that changes all the lyrics of Velvet Underground and Lou Reed songs to pizza references. The group, which includes actor and noted <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502140011/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQ5IWLT6q34">pizza enthusiast</a> Macaulay Culkin, is set to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502140011/http://gothamist.com/2013/12/11/macaulay_culkins_pizza_underground.php">play a free show tomorrow</a> at Baby&apos;s All Right in Williamsburg. In the meantime, you can watch a 15 minute short film on the group, which includes their entire first live show at Sidewalk Cafe from last month.</p>

<p>The band first formed in Feb. 2012, but Culkin only joined up a few months ago, leading to the first live shows (and recording of their massive Lou Reed/VU medley at his house). The group will play this Friday at 7 p.m. at Baby&apos;s All Right, with free pizza provided <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502140011/https://twitter.com/BabysAllRight/status/410917538613063680">by Williamsburg Pizza</a>, so get there early.</p>

<p>We asked <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502140011/http://www.adamkuban.com/">Adam Kuban</a>, founder of the essential pizza blog Slice which is followed by the group on Twitter, what he thought of their pepperoni-infused sound:</p>

<blockquote>As a fan of pizza and the Velvet Underground, I love the concept. It&apos;s absurd, of course, but it&apos;s also stupidly clever. And let&apos;s not forget that Macaulay Culkin has a history with pizza&#x2014;he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502140011/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQ5IWLT6q34">has it delivered in memorable fashion</a> in &quot;Home Alone,&quot; and has the concierge at the Plaza order him <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502140011/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGa2SyMd5Vk">a limo and pizza</a> in &quot;Home Alone 2.&quot; Maybe he can work in a reference to those scenes in expanded versions of Pizza Underground songs&#x2014;though he may hate being associated with those movies, I have no idea.</blockquote>

<p>In addition to Culkin, the band includes Phoebe Kreutz, Matt Colbourn, Deenah Vollmer, Austin Kilham. The group has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502140011/http://thepizzaunderground.tumblr.com/">a very amusing Tumblr</a> along with a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502140011/https://twitter.com/cheesedayz">Twitter account</a> and a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502140011/http://thepizzaunderground.bandcamp.com/">Bandcamp page</a>.
