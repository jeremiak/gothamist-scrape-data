<p>Last night, a few hundred Jedi enthusiasts crammed into Washington Square Park for a giant <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150321214720/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/30/lightsaber_battle_coming_back_to_ny.php">Lightsaber Battle</a>. There <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150321214720/http://newyork.metromix.com/events/standard_photo_gallery/lightsaber-battle-2011/2833107/content">were demonstrations of</a> proper lightsaber technique, people dressed as Sith Lords, lots of children and various non-<em>Star Wars</em> characters, including zombies, ninjas and even a Pikachu, all partaking in the fun. There was even some under-the-radar <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150321214720/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4b80v8TvrHY">lightsaber battle betting</a> going on. </p>

<p>Kevin Bracken, one of the organizers of the event, told us: &quot;Last night&apos;s lightsaber battle was phenomenal! 500 lightsabers were reserved in advance, and easily 1000 people showed up. I am happy we can put on big family-friendly events; so many parents and kids last night. The Arch in the park made for an epic backdrop, and my favorite moment of the night was setting up an epic Braveheart-style skirmish with deafening cheers from each side.&quot;</p>

<p>Click through for some photos from the event, and below, check out some videos of <em>Star Wars</em> chants, lightsaber rattling, and one person&apos;s very serious saber moves.</p>
