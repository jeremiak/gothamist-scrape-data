<p>Four people were injured this afternoon after two motorists collided, sending one vehicle careening into scaffolding in midtown Manhattan. According to the NYPD, the yellow cab hit into a 2011 Nissan Pathfinder around 2:50 p.m. at 42nd Street and 1st Avenue; the SUV jumped the curb as a result, striking the nearby scaffolding and causing it to collapse. The NYPD spokesperson says at least one pedestrian was hit by the scaffolding. </p>

<p>&quot;It was quiet one second, a nice day. Then, you hear a loud crash. It was an unmistakable sound of a crash,&quot; witness Mario Fernandez, a tourist from Spain, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130908043611/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/people-injured-taxi-suv-crash-scaffolding-midtown-article-1.1447031#ixzz2e3E4ZdvA">told the Daily News</a>. &quot;The cab driver was on the floor. He was bleeding. He looked like he was hurt bad. There was a woman in the back seat. She had a handkerchief in her head, bleeding.&quot; </p>

<p>An FDNY spokesperson said four patients (including both drivers) were taken to nearby hospitals in serious condition, but as of this afternoon all are expected to survive.</p>
