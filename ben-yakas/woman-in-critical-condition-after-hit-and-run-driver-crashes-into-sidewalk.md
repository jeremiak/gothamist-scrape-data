<p>A woman is in critical condition, and another person was injured, after a driver careened onto the sidewalk in midtown Manhattan earlier today, crashing into a pole. Police say the incident happened around 8:30 a.m. Saturday on West 34th Street and Tenth Avenue. The driver of the car, which was a Dodge Durango, struck a fire hydrant and bus stop sign pole; the pole then fell onto a woman, who was critically injured. &quot;I heard a loud bang. I went outside and saw a lot of people gathered around. There was one person on the ground unconscious. And there was a girl trying to wake her,&quot; deli worker Tenzin Kunsang <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140604034302/http://nypost.com/2014/05/31/driver-crashes-into-pole-that-falls-on-top-of-woman/">told the Post.</a></p>

<p>The woman, believed to be in her 40s, suffered severe head trauma and was bleeding from the nose, head and mouth. She was taken to Bellevue Hospital in critical condition, along with another man who was injured in the crash (but is in stable condition). </p>

<p>The driver <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140604034302/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/pedestrians-injured-critical-suv-driver-careens-manhattan-sidewalk-article-1.1812357">abandoned his car</a> and fled the scene: &quot;He looked down at the two people and grabbed his head,&quot; a witness told the Post. &quot;He went back to the car, then looked at the people again and then I don&#x2019;t know what happened to him.&quot; </p>

<p>Cops describe the suspect as bald and in his 30s, and the Post adds he goes by the name &quot;Stanley.&quot;</p>
