<p>We know where to get good coffee near <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429120639/http://gothamist.com/2014/02/05/coffee_map.php">every subway station in Manhattan</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429120639/http://gothamist.com/2014/02/13/nyc_coffee_map.php">Brooklyn and Queens</a>. We know where to get the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429120639/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/23/best_iced_coffee.php">best iced coffee</a> and how to make <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429120639/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/03/steve_albini_gives_us_the_famous_el.php">fluffy coffee</a>. But what if you&apos;ve got a hankering for the most expensive latte in NYC? Don&apos;t worry, because a new coffee bar in Greenpoint has you covered.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429120639/http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/eats/behold-7-latte-article-1.1614894">The Daily News reports</a> that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429120639/http://budin-nyc.com/">Budin</a>, a cafe that opened this week on Greenpoint Avenue, is home to a $7 licorice-flavored latte. Why is it so expensive? it may have something to do with the fact that three other countries are involved with its production: the coffee beans are grown in Ethiopia and roasted in Norway, and the anise syrup and raw licorice powder are both from Denmark.</p>

<p>&quot;Each component is of a high caliber that is rarely seen in the states,&#x201D; co-owner Elliot Rayman told the News. &#x201C;They come together in a unique flavor all its own.&quot; Other coffee purveyors are crying foul: &quot;<strong>There is nothing, nothing, nothing that will make a latte $7 &#x2014; except hubris,&#x201D;</strong> Peter Longo, the owner of Porto Rico Importing Company, told them. &quot;It&#x2019;s the emperor&#x2019;s new clothes.&quot;</p>

<p>At the end of the day, this is still a bargain compared to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429120639/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/15/the_most_expensive_starbucks_coffee.php">a $23.60 coffee from Starbucks,</a> or a $30 coffee <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429120639/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/27/cat_poop_coffee_goes_for_30_a_cup.php">made of cat poo.</a></p>
