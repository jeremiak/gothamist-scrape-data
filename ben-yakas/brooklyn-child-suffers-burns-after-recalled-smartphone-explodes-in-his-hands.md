<p>This week, Samsung issued a recall of their Galaxy Note7 smartphones after several incidents in which its lithium-ion batteries had exploded and caused fires. One Brooklyn six-year-old learned it the hard way when the smartphone burst into flames in his hands as he was playing with it.</p>

<p>The boy&apos;s grandmother, Linda Lewis, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021114602/http://nypost.com/2016/09/11/recalled-samsung-phone-explodes-in-little-boys-hands/">told the Post</a> he was using the phone at home in East Flatbush around 8 p.m. on Saturday when the incident happened. &quot;The child was watching videos on the phone when the battery exploded,&quot; she said. &quot;It set off alarms in my house.&quot;</p>

<p>The child was taken to Downstate Medical Center with burns to his body. &quot;He is home now,&#x201D; Lewis added, noting the family had been in contact with Samsung. &quot;He doesn&#x2019;t want to see or go near any phones. He&#x2019;s been crying to his mother.&quot;</p>

<p>Just a few days ago, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021114602/http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/samsung-galaxy-note7-users-urged-turn-off-phones/story?id=41983208">urged consumers to turn off</a> their Galaxy Note7&apos;s and exchange them for other phones. &quot;When these batteries overheat and burst, the results can be dangerous,&quot; the CPSC said in a statement. &quot;These incidents have occurred while charging and during normal use, which has led us to call for consumers to power down their Note7s.&quot;</p>

<p>Samsung confirmed it was working with the commission to complete the terms of the recall. &quot;New Note7 replacement devices will be issued to exchange program participants upon completion of the CPSC process. In the interim, consumers can return their Note7 for another device,&quot; said Tim Baxter, the president of Samsung Electronics America. &quot;Our collaboration with the CPSC, carrier partners and via our own communication channels is aimed at ensuring all Note7 users are aware of the issue and understand their options.&quot;</p>

<p>The company noted that there have been at least 35 reported cases of phones with &quot;a battery cell issue&quot; as of last week. That includes a man in Massachusetts who says <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021114602/http://boston.cbslocal.com/2016/09/04/samsung-galaxy-note-7-recall-phone-explodes-winthrop/">his phone exploded</a> as it was charging overnight; a Florida man <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021114602/http://abc11.com/news/florida-mans-smartphone-explodes-catches-jeep-on-fire/1504142/">whose phone exploded</a> and engulfed his Jeep in flames; and an Australian man <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021114602/http://www.technobuffalo.com/2016/09/06/note-7-explosion-recall/">whose phone exploded</a> as he slept. </p>

<p>As the NYPD reminded us earlier this year, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021114602/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/16/cellphone_pillow_fire.php">sleeping with your phone</a> is not a good idea no matter what brand phone you use&#x2014;and that sometimes <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021114602/http://gothamist.com/2015/02/28/man_says_he_suffered_3rd_degree_bur.php">includes iPhones too!</a></p>
