<p>For months now, we have been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144334/http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x1abwt7_beyonce-haunted-music-video_music">haunted</a> by rumors that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144334/http://gothamist.com/tags/beyonce">Beyonce</a> and Jay Z would be getting divorced. It has basically ruined our summer, and caused us to become incredibly suspicious of the one-world authoritarian government known as the New World Order, aka the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144334/http://gothamist.com/tags/illuminati">Illuminati</a>. &apos;Why would they set thousands of years of careful planning aflame in one fell swoop?&apos; we cried into an uncaring void. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144334/http://gothamist.com/2014/08/15/alert_beyonce_is_definitely_maybe_p.php">We&apos;d just about resigned ourselves</a> to living in a world in which Bonnie divorces Clyde. <em>We should have known better.</em></p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="82814bey3.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144334im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/82814bey3.jpeg" width="640" height="521"> <br> <i> Beyllumination</i></div> <p></p>

<p>Beyonce&apos;s father and former manager Mathew Knowles dropped a bombshell during the Roula &amp; Ryan show on 104.1 KRBE in Houston this week. He claimed that the divorce rumors were a &quot;Jedi mind trick&quot; orchestrated to &quot;ignite&quot; ticket sales for the couple&#x2019;s On The Run Tour.</p>

<p>&quot;I know, because we&apos;ve done this,&quot; he was quoted as saying, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144334/http://radaronline.com/exclusives/2014/08/mathew-knowles-beyonce-jay-z-divorce-rumors-solange-elevator-fight/">according to Radar</a>. &quot;From experience, there&apos;s a tour going on. So you sometimes have to ignite that tour. It&apos;s called a Jedi mind trick. The Jedi mind trick fools you a lot.&quot; When asked whether the infamous elevator incident was part of the ruse, he added, &quot;All I know is the Jedi mind trick. Everyone&apos;s talking about it. Ticket sales went up. Solange&apos;s album sales went up 200%!&quot; </p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="82814bey4.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144334im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/82814bey4.jpeg" width="640" height="411"> <br> <i> Beycationing</i></div> <p></p>

<p>We don&apos;t know what to believe. On the one hand, Jedi mind tricks sound EXACTLY like something the Illuminati have up their sleeves (although they would prefer you refer to them as &quot;persuasive arguments&quot;); on the other hand, body language experts think they were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144334/http://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/jay-z-desperate-show-love-4103498">trying a wee bit too hard</a> to look loving at the VMAs and Solange <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144334/http://www.mstarz.com/articles/35839/20140826/beyonce-jay-z-mtv-vmas-fight-snaps-over-solange-knowles-banned-backstage.htm">was reportedly banned</a> from backstage. Also, the whole world watched Hayden Christensen kill all the Jedis.</p>

<p>Matthew Knowles <em>is</em> Beyonce&apos;s father, and for a very long time acted as her manager and professional guru. But he was fired several years ago, and has had little to do with her ascendence to biggest pop star on the planet. He claims he has close relations with his daughter though: &quot;We still talk every Sunday. She&#x2019;s still the humble, generous person that she&#x2019;s always been.&quot;</p>
