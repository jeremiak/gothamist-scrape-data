<p>The urban cowboy <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110090746/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/27/urban_cowboy_bridge.php">who held up traffic</a> and baffled rubberneckers on Monday when he moseyed down the Outerbridge Crossing toward Staten Island has now been arrested for animal cruelty. </p>

<p>Police <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110090746/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/29/sometimes_the_bear_he_eats_u.php">had already confiscated</a> Tod &quot;Doc&quot; Mishler&apos;s two horses after the incident (he also received two summonses), but he was only arrested Thursday morning after the ASPCA evaluated the horses&apos; health and found that they had multiple injuries and were extremely malnourished. </p>

<p>An NYPD spokesman tells us Mishler was charged with &quot;torture, injure, not feed animal.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It&apos;s not good,&quot; one police source <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110090746/http://nypost.com/2016/06/30/urban-cowboy-gets-jailed-for-animal-cruelty/">told the Post</a> about the horses, named Hope &amp; Charity. &quot;They have multiple injuries, open sores, underweight, dehydrated. One had lameness due to an obstruction in his hoof.&quot;</p>

<p>The 80-year-old Mishler, who frequently rides his horses cross-country to raise awareness about child hunger, previously <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110090746/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2016/06/27/horses-outerbridge-crossing/">told CBS</a> that his dream is to &quot;ride across the country and let the people know that we have the money to feed every starving child in the world.&quot; But he&apos;s become something of a controversial figure&#x2014;a Facebook group called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110090746/https://www.facebook.com/groups/1226309250735954/">&quot;Stop Doc Mishler&quot;</a> has argued that he is neglecting his horses. In 2011, he was arrested in Wisconsin and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110090746/http://host.madison.com/wsj/news/local/crime_and_courts/man-accused-of-neglect-reunited-with-horses-charge-to-be/article_5678d22a-c93d-11e0-a259-001cc4c03286.html">accused of neglecting and underfeeding the horses</a>, but those charges were later dropped.</p>

<p>For his part, Mishler <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110090746/http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2016/06/outerbridge_cowboy_unsure_of_h.html#incart_river_index">told SI Advance</a> that he was mistreated by officials, and just wanted to get his horses back. &quot;In Montana, they hang horse thieves,&quot; he noted.</p>
