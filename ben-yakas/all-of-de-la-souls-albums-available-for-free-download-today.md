<p>Unless someone&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429152211/http://gothamist.com/2014/02/13/photos_brooklyn_man_proposes_to_gir.php#photo-1">gotten 15 French Bulldogs for you</a>, this is probably going to be the best thing that happens to you today: pioneering hip hop group De La Soul are making <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429152211/http://www.wearedelasoul.com/">their entire catalog available for free download</a> over the next 25 hours.</p>

<p>&quot;It&apos;s about allowing our fans who have been looking and trying to get a hold of our music to have access to it,&quot; Posdnuos <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429152211/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/de-la-soul-to-make-entire-catalog-available-for-free-20140213">explained to Rolling Stone</a>, noting that the myriad number of samples on their albums have prevented them from being able to release their albums on most digital services (including iTunes and Spotify). &quot;It&apos;s been too long where our fans haven&apos;t had access to everything. This is our way of showing them how much we love them.&quot;</p>

<p>Besides being Valentine&apos;s Day, today marks the 25th anniversary of their landmark debut album <em>3 Feet High and Rising</em>. The music will be available for download from 11 a.m. Eastern time Friday until noon on Saturday. Keep in mind that some people <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429152211/https://twitter.com/search?q=de%20la%20soul%20dropbox&amp;src=typd">had trouble downloading this morning</a> (it seems Dropbox-related), but it should hopefully be back up soon.</p>

<p>The band are also planning on releasing their first new album in a decade, <em>You&apos;re Welcome,</em> in the coming months. &quot;We&apos;re just getting in the mode of constantly giving people new music,&quot; Posdnuos added. &quot;With us, we&apos;ve sat a long time without releasing an album. It&apos;s high time we start releasing a bunch of stuff because it&apos;s there.&quot;</p>
