<p>A Bronx woman is suing the city claiming that an NYPD officer coerced her into a date, drugged her, raped her, and left her with a black eye. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140608214345/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/alleged-false-arrest-leads-150m-lawsuit-city-article-1.1819114">The Daily News reports that</a> Erica Noonan, 31, claims in her $150 million lawsuit that Office Carlos Becker pulled her over for drunk-driving in March 2013; he allegedly videotaped her butt while she was in custody, then pressured her into a date by promising to help with her case. When <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140608214345/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/24/nypd_officer_takes_woman_he_arreste.php">they went on that date</a> about two weeks later, she woke up the next day in his bed with a black eye and little memory of how she got there.</p>

<p>Becker, 31, allegedly sent Noonan hundreds of texts during this time, including one in which he said he would &quot;talk to the district att&quot; about her arrest. She claims Becker ordered her a drink at the date that made her feel groggy, and he told her she had somehow given herself the black eye. &quot;It is my sincere hope that the NYPD takes measures to ensure that another citizen is not violated, as I was, at the hands of a police officer,&quot; she wrote in the suit.</p>

<p>You can see some of their text messages below:</p>

<p>Becker <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140608214345/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nypd-loses-badge-texting-dating-dwi-bust-article-1.1407221">had been charged</a> with misdemeanor official misconduct for the arrest, and the judge acknowledged that he committed several other acts that could have been characterized as misconduct; but he got off because, as the News put it, &quot;the cop&#x2019;s videotaping of the woman&#x2019;s backside was reprehensible but not an unauthorized use of a police function.&quot; Noonan&apos;s DWI charge was eventually dropped completely.</p>

<p>Noonan is accusing the officer and the city of excessive force, negligent training, assault, battery, false arrest, rape, libel, malicious prosecution, abuse of authority, harassment and other violations. </p>
