<p>An ultra-Orthodox cantor <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140521030007/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/17/nyregion/brooklyn-cantor-pleads-guilty-in-sexual-abuse-case.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">has pleaded guilty to sexually abusing</a> a teenage boy&#x2014;and he&apos;s only facing months in jail as a result. Baruch Lebovits, 62, was previously convicted of eight counts of molestation, but that case was overturned in 2012 on a technicality. And this week, Lebovits <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140521030007/http://nypost.com/2014/05/16/orthodox-jewish-man-admits-to-sex-8-times-with-teenage-boy/">fully admitted</a> that he engaged in oral sex with a teenage boy on eight different occasions in 2004 and 2005.</p>

<p>Lebovits <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140521030007/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/09/post_135.php">was sentenced</a> to 10 &#xBD; to 32 years in prison in 2010 for raping children in Borough Park. At the time, Brooklyn Supreme Court Justice Patricia DiMango <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140521030007/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/13/rabbi_sentenced_for_eight_sexual_ab.php">showed no mercy</a>, telling the court, &quot;It is important for the courts to send a clear message that abusing and harming children will not be tolerated.&quot;</p>

<p>But his conviction was reversed on a series of technicalities. According <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140521030007/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/17/nyregion/brooklyn-cantor-pleads-guilty-in-sexual-abuse-case.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">to the Times</a>, an appeal&apos;s court decided Lebovits &quot;had been deprived of a fair trial because prosecutors took too long to turn over a detective&#x2019;s notes about a witness.&quot; The case became <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140521030007/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/12/nyregion/after-ugly-campaign-finding-little-grace-in-brooklyn-district-attorneys-exit.html?ref=michaelpowell">emblematic of problems</a> under former Brooklyn DA Charles Hynes in prosecuting sexual abuse cases among ultra-Orthodox Jews. </p>

<p>Current DA Ken Thompson <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140521030007/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/17/brooklyns_new_da_intervenes_in_orth.php">wrote a letter</a> to Hynes asking that he stop working on the case last fall, fearing that Hynes would offer Lebovits a plea deal. The victim didn&apos;t want to testify again though, and prosecutors ended up offering Lebovits four to 12 years; but Justice Mark Dwyer lowered that to a two-year sentence, &quot;citing those given to others who had pleaded to similar crimes.&quot;</p>

<p>So under his current plea deal, Lebovits will receive credit for the 13 months he has already served under the previous conviction (on the same charges). As a result, he&apos;ll only serve a few months in jail, at most. </p>
