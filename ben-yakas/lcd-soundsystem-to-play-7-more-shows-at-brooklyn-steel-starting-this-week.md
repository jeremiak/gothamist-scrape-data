<p>LCD Soundsystem must have really enjoyed their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170612212315/http://gothamist.com/2017/03/28/lcd_soundsystem_brooklyn_steel.php">five show residency</a> at new Williamsburg music venue <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170612212315/http://gothamist.com/tags/brooklynsteel">Brooklyn Steel</a> in April, because they&apos;re coming back to do it again later this week. The band announced today that it will play seven shows in nine days starting this Friday. </p>

<p>The band will perform at the venue Friday June 16th and Saturday June 17th, then Monday June 19th, Tuesday the 20th, and Wednesday the 21st, and will conclude with performances on Friday the 23rd &amp; Saturday the 24th. Tickets go on sale to the public at 10 a.m. on Thursday June 15th&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170612212315/http://www.bowerypresents.com/event/1505767-lcd-soundsystem-brooklyn">go here to buy tickets then</a>.<br>
 <br>
The band is gearing up to release a long-awaited (and as-yet untitled) fourth album sometime this summer after reuniting in the winter of 2015/2016, less than five years after a very grand, very public breakup tour. They&apos;ve <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170612212315/http://gothamist.com/2017/05/04/lcd_soundsystem_2017_songs.php">already released</a> two new songs, &quot;Call The Police&quot; and &quot;American Dream,&quot; both of which they performed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170612212315/http://gothamist.com/2017/05/07/videos_chris_pine_sings_and_dances.php#photo-1">on <em>Saturday Night Live</em></a> in May. </p>

<p>You can expect to hear those tunes at the new shows; at least two other new tunes, &quot;Tonight&quot; and &quot;Emotional Haircut,&quot; were also played at the Brooklyn Steel residency in April. James Murphy has also been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170612212315/https://www.facebook.com/lcdsoundsystem/posts/10158816788330444">giving Facebook updates</a> on the state of the album, which he estimates could be released as early as July (though more likely August). </p>
