<p>Stop me if you think that you&apos;ve heard this one before: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501213902/http://gothamist.com/tags/morrissey">Morrissey</a>, the king of maudlin (but hilarious) gloom, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501213902/http://dcist.com/2013/03/morrissey_cancels_23_us_tour_dates.php">has had to cancel</a> the remainder of his U.S. tour in recent weeks because of multiple serious illnesses. He recounted his recent experiences during <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501213902/http://music.msn.com/music/article.aspx?news=797337">an interview on Mexican radio station Reactor 105.7</a>, revealing that doctors have advised him to give up his career as a touring musician. But you can&apos;t just take the hand out of the glove: &quot;I have been cautioned to, but it&apos;s difficult for me because it&apos;s very ingrained in me.&quot;</p>

<p>Morrissey, 53, has been here before&#x2014;after The Smiths broke up, after <em>Kill Uncle</em>, and after the relative career lows of <em>Southpaw Grammar</em> (super underrated!) and <em>Maladjusted</em>, people clamored for him to give it all up. And both times, he returned refreshed, with career highlights including <em>Your Arsenal</em> and <em>You Are The Quarry</em>.</p>

<p>During the interview, Morrissey opened up in detail about suffering from a bleeding ulcer, double pneumonia, and Barrett&apos;s esophagus, a condition in which the patient&apos;s esophagus takes on an acidic lining similar to the one found in the stomach. </p>

<blockquote>I had a very bad time. I had internal bleeding and I was rushed into hospital and I had lost a lot of blood. They tried to patch me together over the following five weeks but it didn&apos;t work. ... I was on lots of IV drips for almost five weeks, and each time it seemed as though I was back to robust health I would decline ... I had lost so much blood I had become anemic, but I&apos;m still receiving ongoing treatment and I am very optimistic now.

<p>It almost became absurd the number of things that happened to me, but everything just attacked me at once. The double pneumonia -- everything was really a result of the fact I had lost so much blood, so the immune defenses were very, very low and couldn&apos;t cope with anything, so therefore the slightest gust of wind and I would have a terrible cold.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501213902/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/13/videos_morrissey.php">Having seen him</a> on the earlier leg of his tour, we&apos;re very pleased Morrissey has seemingly no intentions of heeding his doctors&apos; warnings. While we, of course, don&apos;t want anything bad to happen to Morrissey&#x2014;nor do we want him to die onstage while singing &quot;You Have Killed Me&quot; with a thousand orgiastic hands shoved toward his slightly unbuttoned shirt&#x2014;we can&apos;t quite imagine a world without Morrissey around. </p>

<p>As he sang not so long, &quot;You don&apos;t like me but you love me/Either way you&apos;re wrong/You&apos;re gonna miss me when I&apos;m gone.&quot; For now, Morrissey is just going to have to stretch out and wait until he&apos;s not still ill. Is it really so strange to say that these things take time to heal? Keep working <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501213902/http://articles.latimes.com/2013/jan/17/entertainment/la-et-jc-morrissey-memoir-when-20130117">on those fabled memoirs</a>&#x2014;don&apos;t look back in ten years and say you started something you couldn&apos;t finish! Next thing you know, everyone will ask, &apos;well, I wonder where that charming man went?&apos; The golden lights will shine once again, and then everyday really will be like Sunday.</p>
