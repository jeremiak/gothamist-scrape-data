<p><strong>[UPDATE BELOW]</strong> It seems like nothing has been going right for the formerly Hasidic Jewish reggae performer Matisyahu ever since <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141023062331/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/13/matisyahu.php">he shaved his locks</a>. Matisyahu showed off his new look at the 6th annual Festival of Light Hanukkah Tour this week at Music Hall of Williamsburg. But <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141023062331/http://www.papermag.com/2011/12/matisyahu_snaps_attacks_photogrpaher.php">according to</a> Paper Magazine photographer Rebecca Smeyne, it wasn&apos;t all huge disco dreidels and giant menorahs: she claims Matisyahu kicked her in the face and broke her camera&apos;s expensive flash during Wednesday night&apos;s sold out show.</p>

<p>Smeyne&#x2014;an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141023062331/http://rebeccasmeyne.com/">accomplished and experienced photographer</a> who has shot more than 600 bands in the past five years for places such as Vice, Spin, Rolling Stone and more&#x2014; described the experience <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141023062331/http://www.papermag.com/2011/12/matisyahu_snaps_attacks_photogrpaher.php">in a long post on Paper&apos;s website</a>: </p>

<blockquote>After 12 flash shots over a few minute period (the camera gives me this data), Matisyahu stepped toward me, off the stage. The person in front of me moved and the next thing I knew Matisyahu&apos;s foot was on my face and I fell to the ground. At first I assumed he was trying to crowdsurf, that he wasn&apos;t deliberately trying to step on me. But when I got up, he was in the middle of the audience. When I turned to look at him, he charged at me and attempted to forcefully wrestle the camera away from me. I had the camera strap wrapped around my wrist several times, and I held the body tightly with both hands. Finally, he ripped the external flash off the top of the camera, leaving wires exposed.</blockquote>

<p>After some prodding, she talked with Matisyahu&apos;s manager,  who said he saw the whole thing, apologized for his behavior, and said it was &quot;out of character.&quot; He also gave her &quot;a fat stack of bills&quot; to settle the damage on the camera. Matisyahu later tweeted his apologies, and also sent out an official statement on the incident, blaming it partly on the flash camera: &quot;I regret what transpired when I tried to remove the camera from the photographer&apos;s hands last night. As an artist on stage, it is very distracting and disorienting to have a camera flashing in your face for an extended period of time. I reacted impulsively out of frustration and for that I apologize.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141023062331/http://www.flickr.com/photos/rebecca_rs/sets/72157594552450437/">Smeyne</a> noted that she had pre-arranged a photo pass through Matisyahu&apos;s publicists, and that there was no mention of restrictions in terms of photography or flash. But in the wake of the incident, some people blamed Smeyne for using the flash: &quot;Oh come on. Any concert photographer should know better than to be using those huge annoying flashes at shows. And 12 of them in like 2 minutes? You probably blinded him. I probably would have kicked you in the face too,&quot; was one such response, from a  commenter named Hal. </p>

<p>Some of the reactions were so strong, Paper founder and publisher David Hershkovits <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141023062331/http://www.papermag.com/2011/12/matisyahu-gate_some_comments_o.php">felt the need to comment</a>, and he rebuked those who sought to blame the victim: &quot;So let&apos;s get it straight once and for all. There is never an excuse to use violence against a woman. Period.&quot; </p>

<p>UPDATE: Smeyne sent us this statement:</p>

<blockquote>I&apos;d like to add, in regards to the term &quot;kick&quot; which I used in my original tweet right after the incident: He looked at me, stepped toward me and put his foot and weight on my face, as well as other parts of my body. (He obviously wasn&apos;t just attempting to crowdsurf because immediately after this is when he charged at me and violently tried to take my camera then broke off the flash, just as I described in my account for Paper). It would be more accurate to say he &quot;stepped on my face.&quot;

<p>At a venue of this size, with no photo pit, with only a few photographers, it&apos;s common to use flash for some shots. Usually I&apos;m surrounded by colleagues using at least some flash at shows of this capacity. It&apos;s too bad there weren&apos;t any at this show, because they probably would have gotten some crazy shots! If there had been restrictions about flash, I would have gladly complied.</p></blockquote><p></p>
