<p>One of the most striking moments <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120531071019/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/01/breaking_occupy_wall_street_protest.php">captured on video</a> during yesterday&apos;s Occupy Wall Street confrontation with police at the Brooklyn Bridge came when police arrested a young looking girl in a green <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120531071019/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Invader_Zim_characters#GIR">GIR hat</a>. Frustrated protesters yelled that &quot;she&apos;s just a girl&quot;&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120531071019/http://twitter.com/#!/pmocek/status/120235852000538624">some claimed as young as 13</a>&#x2014;anger erupted over her <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120531071019/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/02/more_than_700_reportedly_arrested_a.php#photo-1">seemingly overly-agressive arrest</a>.</p>

<p>And the Times, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120531071019/http://www.buzzfeed.com/provincialelitist/nypd-will-arrest-children-at-occupywallstreet-pro">Buzzfeed</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120531071019/http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/oct/02/occupy-wall-street-nypd-tactics?newsfeed=true">Guardian</a>, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120531071019/http://gawker.com/5845775/police-corral-arrest-occupy-wall-street-protesters-on-brooklyn-bridge">Gawker</a> all took note. You can see the fired-up scene when she was arrested in the video below:</p>

<p>It seems more likely now that she just <em>looks</em> young, but is of age. People are looking for her&#x2014;there are several relevant <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120531071019/http://www.reddit.com/search?q=girl+arrested&amp;restrict_sr=off&amp;sort=new">Reddit threads</a>-and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120531071019/http://boingboing.net/2011/10/02/occupy-wall-street-video-of-nypd-arresting-what-is-said-to-be-a-13-year-old-girl.html">Boing Boing wrote</a> about the mystery. But the question we&apos;re wondering is: is she a symbol of a flawed law enforcement response? Or were protesters groping to find instances of NYPD brutality?</p>
