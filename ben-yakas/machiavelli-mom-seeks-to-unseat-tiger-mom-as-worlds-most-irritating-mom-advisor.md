<p>Unless you&apos;re getting it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151031153732/http://www.inquisitr.com/605971/justin-bieber-gets-unsolicited-advice-from-vanilla-ice-on-top-of-everything-else/">from Vanilla Ice</a>, unsolicited advice is the worst&#x2014;as Jezebel <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151031153732/http://jezebel.com/5967288/fuck-you-unsolicited-advice">aptly put it</a>, &quot;this type of help can be passive aggressive and often serves the person offering more than it does the person receiving.&quot; And yet, that hasn&apos;t stopped plenty of people (and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151031153732/http://www.glamour.com/">magazines</a>) from making a living doing so. Today, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151031153732/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323646604578400804035071688.html?mod=wsj_share_tweet">the Wall Street Journal published a piece</a> by one such adviser&#x2014;and in it, &quot;Machiavelli Mom&quot; does everything she can to unseat <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151031153732/http://gothamist.com/tags/tigermom">&quot;Tiger Mom&quot;</a> as the world&apos;s most irritating unsolicited mom advice-giver.</p>

<p>Author <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151031153732/http://suzanneevansbooks.com/author/">Suzanne Evans</a>, who is the author of the forthcoming &quot;Machiavelli for Moms: Maxims on the Effective Governance of Children,&quot; said she was inspired by several maxims from Machiavelli&apos;s &quot;The Prince&quot; to use duplicity, deceit and ruthless cunning to parent her four children (and her husband). </p>

<p>That includes pitting two of her kids against each other for better grades (the loser got nothing &quot;<strong>other than the shame</strong> of losing the competition&#x2014;to his younger sister no less, as I reminded him&quot;), lying to her kids about going on vacations without them (&quot;<strong>Don&apos;t feel guilty for lying to your kids if it makes you happy and relaxed</strong>&#x2026;because having a happy, relaxed mom always benefits a child&quot;), disciplining her special-needs child with harsh punishments, and uh, forcing her husband to get a vasectomy in this creepy scene:</p>

<blockquote>Either way, the maxim came in handy one night when my husband got into bed, pulled close to me and said, &quot;You know, I&apos;d really like to have another kid.&quot; To which I replied, &quot;That&apos;s nice, honey, but what you&apos;re going to have instead is a vasectomy.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>And how did she force him to do it? &quot;My husband resisted this edict at first, but when I told him that until he accepted it he shouldn&apos;t expect any affection in bed, he quickly agreed to an appointment with a doctor.&quot; As NY Times editor Patrick LaForge <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151031153732/https://twitter.com/palafo/status/320554257159962626">put it</a>, &quot;She is either brilliantly cynical or barking mad.&quot; Or as Paul Ford <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151031153732/https://twitter.com/ftrain/status/320549090595328000">tweeted</a>, &quot;Look out TIGER MOMS now it&apos;s MACHIAVELLI MOMS to make you want to RIP YOUR GODDAM FACE OFF from EXHAUSTED HORROR.&quot;</p>

<p>It sounds like Evans had an exhausting home life, and did what she needed to do to bring some semblance of order to it, even if it meant being a bit harsher to her children than other parents would approve of. But it also seems like all that &quot;power&quot; went to her head rather quickly, curdling into the hubris that led her to write a creepy book instructing others about how to be more like her&#x2014;and if a husband or two gets a little emasculated along the way, or if a child is taught that shame is an acceptable state of mind, so be it. </p>

<p>At the same time...at least she didn&apos;t <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151031153732/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/20/the_ny_post_thinks_this_lady_is_the.php">fat shame her 7-year-old daughter in a national magazine</a>!</p>
