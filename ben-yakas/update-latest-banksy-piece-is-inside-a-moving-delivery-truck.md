Forget fake photoshops of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510022728/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/05/williamsburgs_farting_banksy_seems.php">Farting Banksy</a>&#x2014;the latest real piece from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510022728/http://gothamist.com/tags/banksy">Banksy</a> on his whirlwind month-long open air street art tour of NYC is <em>on the move</em>. Banksy took a break from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510022728/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/04/new_banksy_goes_up_in_bushwick.php#photo-1">his &quot;musical&quot; exploits</a> to convert a delivery truck into a gorgeous mobile garden (which includes a rainbow, waterfall and butterflies). <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510022728/http://www.banksy.co.uk/">And he promises</a> that the truck will visit a different location every evening from dusk, starting in the East Village tonight.</p>

<p>The address of the meat market the truck is parked in front of in the first picture above is East Village Meat Market, #1, 139 2nd Ave, New York, NY 10003. <strike>However, what is believed to be the truck has been spotted as of 12:30 p.m. at 124 Mott Street between Grand Street and Hester Street</strike>. False alarm!</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="10513truck3.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510022728im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/10513truck3.jpg" width="640" height="480"> <br> <i> FALSE ALARM</i></div> <p></p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: It turns out the truck on Mott Street was <em>not</em> Banksy&apos;s truck&#x2014;it had the wrong plate and was not a GMC (and according to a tipster, was empty inside). Which means the hunt is on for the real truck&#x2014;let us know where it is if you find it!</p>

<p><b>UPDATE 8 p.m.</b>: It&apos;s on St. Marks Place between 2nd and 3rd Avenues!</p>
