<p>The flu epidemics, the sexual assaults, the explosives-obsessed heroin addicts, the hipster bars, the subway singers&#x2014;there comes a point when we could really use a break from the hustle and bustle of everyday NYC life. But the thought of missing out on the latest <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150413042954/http://gothamist.com/tags/metzitzahbpeh">snip-n-suck court decision</a> is just demoralizing. What&apos;s a diehard New Yorker to do? Norwegian Cruise Line has the solution: they&apos;ll be launching <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150413042954/http://www.breakaway.ncl.com/experience/?NYC=true">a NYC-themed cruise ship</a> in May that promises all the splendor of Midtown combined with all the pleasure of the open seas.</p>

<p>Yes, who needs <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150413042954/http://gothamist.com/tags/staycation">Staycations</a> anymore when they can have Vaca-staytions! And the crown jewels of the cruise? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150413042954/http://www.psfk.com/2013/01/nyc-cruise-ship.html">Three Sabrett hot dog carts</a>, the same ones found on the streets of NYC. &#x201C;As a New Yorker, I&#x2019;ve been a fan of Sabrett&#x2019;s,&quot; said Kevin Sheehan, CEO of Norwegian Cruise Line. &quot;Since we are launching New York&#x2019;s ship, it made complete sense to bring New York&#x2019;s favorite hot dog to Norwegian Breakaway.&#x201D; Hopefully these dogs will inspire as much self-loathing and nervous stomach gurgling as the real life ones do.</p>

<p>Besides the hot dogs, there&apos;s the artwork on the outside of the ship, courtesy of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150413042954/http://www.petermax.com/">Peter Max</a>: &#x201C;The artwork is a composite of New York City and cosmic imagery&#x2014; the Statue of Liberty, the Manhattan skyline, a giant sunburst, planets, stars, and musical notes,&quot; he explained <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150413042954/http://parkwestgallery.wordpress.com/2012/09/04/revealed-norwegian-breakaway-hull-art-by-peter-max/">to Park West Gallery</a>. &quot;That&#x2019;s my New York! And now Norwegian Breakaway is my New York cruise ship &#x2018;canvas.&#x2019;&#x201D;</p>

<p>Otherwise, there doesn&apos;t seem to be <em>that</em> much else about the cruise that&apos;s distinctly New Yorky. But we have some suggestions: what if the boat were filled with cabbies who insist they don&apos;t have to take you to the midnight buffet? Or how about twenty competing &quot;Original Ray&apos;s&quot; pizza outlets?</p>
