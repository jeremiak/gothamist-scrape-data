										<p>Airplane delays are a major problem in NYC (our airports are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502161703/http://gothamist.com/2009/10/08/new_york_city_1_for_flight_delays.php">the worst in the nation when it comes to this!</a>), and have been known to stress even the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502161703/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/05/photo_rex_ryan_stranded_at_jfk_airp.php">most levelheaded</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502161703/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/18/jets_qb_geno_smith_kicked_off_airpl.php">travelers out.</a> It&apos;s understandable that stressed-out folks might try to distract themselves while trapped in a limbo with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502161703/http://nypost.com/2014/01/23/nyc-airports-are-the-worst-for-amenities-study/">truly crappy amenities</a>&#x2014;but that doesn&apos;t mean the below video of travelers undergoing a laughter yoga session is not a living nightmare come into being. </p>

<p>As the uploaded notes, the late night flight from JFK to Chile was delayed for four hours earlier this week. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502161703/http://www.laughteryogasalonnyc.com/laughteryogasalonnychome.html">Francine Shore</a>, a laughter yoga stylist and coach who was on that flight, led the group in a 20 minute laughter yoga session with a seated laughter meditation while they waited, after getting the airline staff&apos;s permission. </p>

<p>The uploader calls it &quot;unreal,&quot; which is certainly one way of putting it, although we may have gone with &quot;completely the last thing we ever want to see when we&apos;re stuck in a hermetically-sealed nightmare-place with strangers dear god make the cackling stop.&quot; Shore doesn&apos;t just limit herself to performing laughter yoga with people trapped in one spot&#x2014;in the fall, she organized a laugh yoga flashmob in Columbus Circle, which you can see below.</p>
