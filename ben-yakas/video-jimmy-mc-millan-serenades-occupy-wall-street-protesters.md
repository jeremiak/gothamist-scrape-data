<p>Noted protest singer and <em>Deep Throat</em> aficionado <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160129151831/http://gothamist.com/tags/jimmymcmillan">Jimmy McMillan</a> has been stopping by Zuccotti Park to visit <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160129151831/http://gothamist.com/tags/occupywallstreet">Occupy Wall Street</a> protesters frequently over the last three weeks. Someone caught him performing a new mostly spoken-word song&#x2014;we&apos;ll venture a guess that it&apos;s titled &quot;Wall Street&quot; or &quot;Listen To This, Listen To This, Listen To This&quot;&#x2014;all about how the constitution gives you the right to protest and picket and vote for the wrong person. Watch that below, as well as two other videos from other times he popped up downtown&#x2014;including one in which McMillan goes off on a rant about Ron Paul.</p>
