<p>[UPDATE BELOW] A woman was struck by a train in downtown Manhattan this morning. According to FDNY, the incident happened just before 10 a.m. at the Broadway-Lafayette station.

<p>A source tells us the woman may have jumped in front of the oncoming train and sustained a serious leg injury, but is expected to survive (Update: at least one witness claims the woman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430035312/https://twitter.com/ChiaraAtik/status/433981394541613056">slipped and fell onto the tracks</a>). MTA service has been delayed as a result: there is currently no B train service in both directions between W 4 Street and Atlantic Avenue and no D service in both directions between W 4 Street and DeKalb Avenue.</p>

<p>Northbound F trains are running on the A line from Jay Street to W 4 St-Wash Square, and Forest Hills bound M Subway Line Icon trains are terminating at Chambers Street.

<p><strong>Update</strong>: Police now say that the woman, who is believed to be between 20-30 years old, was texting on her cell phone on the edge of the southbound B platform when she slipped in front of the oncoming train. She fell under the first car, and sustained a knee injury. She is in stable condition at Bellevue, and no criminality is suspected.</p>
