And Peter Shankman, a social media entrepreneur, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170320032147/http://shankman.com/the-best-customer-service-story-ever-told-starring-mortons-steakhouse/">swears on his</a> &quot;entire professional reputation and all I hold dear to me that the story below was in no way staged, planned in advance, or in any way faked.&quot;<p></p>

<p>Shankman, a self-described steak connoisseur, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170320032147/http://consumerist.com/2011/08/mortons-delivers-man-steak-at-airport-after-he-jokingly-asks-for-one-in-a-tweet.html">was flying back</a> to Newark after meetings in Tampa on Wednesday; realizing he wouldn&apos;t get home till late, he sent out the jokey tweet asking for the steak from Morton&apos;s Steakhouse, which he frequents. He turned his phone off, got on the flight, and forgot about it till he landed two-and-a-half hours later:</p>

<blockquote>Looking for my driver, I saw my name, waved to him, and started walking to the door of EWR, like I&#x2019;d done hundreds of times before.

<p>&#x201C;Um, Mr. Shankman,&#x201D; he said.</p>

<p>I turned around.</p>

<p>&#x201C;There&#x2019;s a surprise for you here.&#x201D;</p>

<p>I turned to see that the driver was standing next to someone else, who I just assumed was another driver he was talking to. Then I noticed the &#x201C;someone else&#x201D; was in a tuxedo.</p>

<p>And he was carrying a Morton&#x2019;s bag.</p>

<p>Now understand&#x2026; I&#x2019;m a born-and-raised New York City kid. It takes a lot to surprise me. A LOT. I see celebrities on the Subway. I see movies being shot outside my apartment, and fake gunfire from any given CSI show, five days a week. I&#x2019;m immune to surprises.</p>

<p>Except when they&#x2019;re like this.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>Afterwards, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170320032147/https://twitter.com/#!/petershankman/status/103987011144265730">he Tweeted</a> the above photo and wrote, &quot;Oh. My. God. I don&apos;t believe it. @mortons showed up at EWR WITH A PORTERHOUSE!&quot; As Shankman notes in his post about the incident, he was joking when he made the first Tweet, and he calculated that the closest Morton&apos;s Steakhouse was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170320032147/http://maps.google.com/maps?saddr=1+Riverside+Sq+Mall+%23+274,+Hackensack,+NJ+07601-6358+(Morton&apos;s+the+Steakhouse)&amp;daddr=EWR&amp;hl=en&amp;sll=40.859876,-73.945149&amp;sspn=0.658498,1.454315&amp;geocode=FTcpcAId9F6W-yGeHsZIMCPhoSnfbaBVdvrCiTEQgIIjjj8HaQ%3BFfDibAIdQSaU-yGG8tfFN7Tzsw&amp;mra=pd&amp;vpsrc=0&amp;t=h&amp;z=11">23.5 miles away from Newark Airport</a>, which meant they were able to cook the meal and send it out there in under three hours. It&apos;s important to note that Shankman does have over 100K followers on Twitter, and has written books about &quot;outrageous P.R. stunts that work,&quot; but Shankman swears the story is true, and instead points to Morton&apos;s as an example of a company who take social media seriously:</p>

<blockquote>I think it&#x2019;s about Morton&#x2019;s knowing I&#x2019;m a good customer, who frequents their establishments regularly. If you look at their Twitter stream, Morton&#x2019;s is known for always being on the ball, thanking those who mention they&#x2019;re eating there.</blockquote>
