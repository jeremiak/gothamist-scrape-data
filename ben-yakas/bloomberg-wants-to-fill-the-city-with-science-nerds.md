title: Bloomberg Wants To Fill The City With Science Nerds

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="121610nerds.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120124125624im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/121610nerds.jpg" width="240" height="149" class="image-left"> </span></p>

<p>You might not realize it because of all the incredible <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120124125624/http://gothamist.com/2010/12/16/harlem_inventor_creates_anti-sag_de.php">innovations</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120124125624/http://gothamist.com/2009/10/20/inventor_thinks_outside_the_pizza_b.php">inventions</a> that are bursting from the city on a regular basis, but NYC has a bit of an inferiority complex when it comes to the sciences and engineering. Oh sure, we know everything when it comes to fashion, media and finance, but we&apos;re lacking those basic, nerdy fundamentals that could take us to the next level. Thankfully, Mayor Bloomberg and his administration have finally turned their attentions to this problem, by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120124125624/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/bloomberg_administration_wants_new_oJ5sMQ8pzWqLx7DcB6qSSM">trying to woo</a> academic institutions to build a top-tier applied-science facility here. </p>

<p>And don&apos;t think they aren&apos;t willing to give you a little something-something if you come here: &#x201C;To make it happen we are prepared to make a significant capital contribution and possibly offer city sites,&#x201D; said Robert K. Steel, deputy mayor for economic development, according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120124125624/http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2010/12/16/city-seeks-to-lure-top-science-university/">Wall Street Journal</a>. The city has humble ambitions: to become an East Coast version of Silicon Valley (Boston <strike>doesn&apos;t</strike> never counts). Some sites that are being considered for the new institution include city-owned Navy Hospital Campus at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, development sites on Governor&#x2019;s Island, the Goldwater Hospital Campus on Roosevelt Island and the Farm Colony on Staten Island. </p>

<p>Mayor Bloomberg said: &#x201C;New York City has all the ingredients to compliment an applied science and engineering hub: a highly educated global population, unparalleled financial and business community to provide capital and support for new ventures and existing top-notch institutions performing cutting-edge research. We want to capitalize on those strengths.&#x201D; Maybe he&apos;ll take a page from his own playbook, and hire a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120124125624/http://gothamist.com/tags/cathieblack">very well-qualified businesswoman</a> who has tons of scientific experience to run the whole thing without any fuss.</p>
