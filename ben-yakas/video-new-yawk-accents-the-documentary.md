Here&apos;s the lovely trailer (some NSFW language): </p>

<p>Quinlan says that her film, <em>If These Knishes Could Talk</em>, is all about how the NY accent has changed as the city has changed: &quot;what it is, how it&apos;s evolved and if it&apos;s disappearing as the city changes. I&apos;ve been lucky enough to film low-level mobsters and highfaluttin&apos; writers, actors and directors, including Pete Hamill, Amy Heckerling and James McBride.&quot; She trying to raise funds to complete the film, including doing editing and post-production work. She&apos;s already raised our attention to one unique, endangered, only-in-NY creature: the Stasian, an asian Guido from Staten Island.</p>
