<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="21911yorke.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602125830im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/21911yorke.jpg" width="250" height="175" class="image-left"> </span>The music world lit up <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602125830/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/18/happy_friday_radiohead_releases_new.php">yesterday</a> when alternative rock Gods Radiohead released their 8th album, <em>The King Of Limbs,</em> a day early, having announced the album only four days prior after a three-and-a-half year gap. The band also released a music video for skittery, seductive lead single &quot;Lotus Flower,&quot; featuring singer Thom Yorke in bowler hat, writhing like a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602125830/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQWq9XjT8mY">wacky waving flailing arm inflatable tube man</a>. His unique sense of dance is so entrancing, some have taken to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602125830/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4FQ1KkrBH0">imitating</a> the video, while others made some creative edits to the video; the results are now compiled on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602125830/http://dancingthom.tumblr.com/">Dancing Thom</a> tumblr. Here are some of our favorites:</p>

<p>Thom + &quot;Single Ladies&quot;<br>

<p>The instant reactions to the album have been all over the map: the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602125830/http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2011/02/18/radioheads-the-king-of-limbs-strikes-beautiful-balance/">WSJ said</a> the album &quot;balances beautifully the band&#x2019;s gift for melodic rock, energetic electronic rhythms and crafty musical experimentation. Quietly assertive, engaging and accessible, it&#x2019;s a worthy successor to &#x201C;In Rainbows,&#x201D; their 2007 release.&quot; The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602125830/http://www.torontosun.com/entertainment/music/2011/02/18/17330041.html">Toronto Sun wrote</a> that this wasn&apos;t the album fans were expecting: &quot;It&apos;s understated and introspective. There are no big anthems, no singalong choruses &#x2014; virtually no choruses at all, in fact, just layers of skittery rhythms, dreamscape sonics and atmospheric vocals.&quot; Musician Flying Lotus was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602125830/http://www.ateaseweb.com/2011/02/19/flying-lotus-flower-radiohead-vs-the-king-of-beats/">overwhelmingly happy</a> with the album, which many have noted bears a lot of similarities to the electronic music he has been making. </p>

<p>Some fans were so underwhelmed by the 37 minute album, there is now a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602125830/http://musicsnobsanonymous.blogspot.com/2011/02/king-of-limbs-double-album.html">conspiracy</a> that the eight tracks on <em>The King of Limbs</em> is only half of the whole record. It seems very unlikely that the band would release more new music right away, but considering that they&apos;ve been in the studio recording for over three years, and Yorke played at least another half dozen new songs live solo last year (including fan favorites &quot;The Present Tense&quot; and &quot;The Daily Mail&quot;), it seems incredibly likely that we could get another album within the next year or so, in the same vein as the <em>Kid A</em>/<em>Amnesiac </em>releases.</p>
