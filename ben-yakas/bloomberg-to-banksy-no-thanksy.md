<p>Considering how much <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150613043308/http://gothamist.com/tags/bloomberg">Mayor Bloomberg</a> just <em>loves</em> graffiti art&#x2014;the man launched an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150613043308/http://www.nyc.gov/portal/site/nycgov/menuitem.c0935b9a57bb4ef3daf2f1c701c789a0/index.jsp?pageID=mayor_press_release&amp;catID=1194&amp;doc_name=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nyc.gov%2Fhtml%2Fom%2Fhtml%2F2003b%2Fpr195-03.html&amp;cc=unused1978&amp;rc=1194&amp;ndi=1">Anti-Graffiti Task Force</a> within FOUR months of taking office&#x2014;it&apos;s not really that surprising that he doesn&apos;t have anything positive to say about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150613043308/http://gothamist.com/tags/banksy">Banksy&apos;s</a> current open air tour of NYC. &quot;I&apos;ll leave it up to our Department of Cultural Affairs,&quot; he said today during a press conference, &quot;<strong>but look, graffiti does ruin people&apos;s property and it&apos;s a sign of decay and loss of control.&quot;</strong></p>

<p>Not that there&apos;s anything wrong with ART, because Bloomberg loves ART, he really does, but who really thinks street art is <em>ART </em>ART, I mean, could you buy it for tens of thousands of dollars or hang it in an ART museum in a special Bloomberg ART WING? Because that&apos;s real ART, not this $60 crap that is lowering property values, I mean sheesh. </p>

<p>&quot;Art is art,&quot; he said during the announcement about the city&apos;s third Water Tunnel. &#x201C;And nobody&#x2019;s a bigger supporter of the arts than I am. I just think there are some places for art and there are some places [not for] art. <strong>And you running up to somebody&#x2019;s property or public property and defacing it is not my definition of art. Or it may be art, but it should not be permitted</strong>. And I think that&#x2019;s exactly what the law says.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Of course, this could all be part of the master plan&#x2014;how much do we <em>really</em> know about this Michael Rubens Bloomberg anyway? Wouldn&apos;t posing as a billionaire control freak with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150613043308/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/10/bloomberg_feels_sorry_for_losers_wh.php">ambitions to remake the world</a> be the perfect cover for a street artist trying to infiltrate and smash <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150613043308/http://www.theonion.com/articles/area-grandmother-comes-forward-as-banksy,17604/">dominant capitalist paradigms</a>?</p>
