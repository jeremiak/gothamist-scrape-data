<p>The high-ranking Department of Education official who was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412175250/http://gothamist.com/2010/12/10/doe_official_charged_with_sexual_as.php">arrested and accused</a> of sexually torturing his wife with hammers, nails and hangers pleaded not guilty yesterday to first-degree rape, one of several charges he is facing. Official Laurence Harvey, who made $165,000-a-year from his DOE gig (he is currently suspended), is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412175250/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2011/01/15/2011-01-15_educrat_laurence_harvey_denies_raping_torturing_wife_for_supposedly_being_unfait.html">being held</a> on charges of assault, aggravated possession of a weapon, kidnapping and unlawful imprisonment. And his wife has accused him of at least three instances of abuse.</p>

<p>Harvey is accused of raping his wife in their Manhattan home in 2007; he then allegedly assaulted her this past May because he believed she had been unfaithful and needed to be &quot;taught a lesson.&quot; According to police, the education official tied her up with duct tape and assaulted her by &quot;shoving a hammer and nail in her vagina and taking pictures&quot; while saying &quot;this is how whores are treated.&quot; His wife didn&apos;t report either assault until last month, after he attacked her yet again, this time allegedly punching her in the mouth and slapping her in the face, all because she asked where he was going out.</p>
