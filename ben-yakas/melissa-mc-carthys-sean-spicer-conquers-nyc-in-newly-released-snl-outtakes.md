<p>Melissa McCarthy&apos;s impression of White House spokesperson Sean Spicer has become a national phenomenon since she first rammed her podium into a crowd of fake reporters on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170716214139/http://gothamist.com/tags/snl"><em>Saturday Night Live</em></a> in February. McCarthy took the impression to the next level last weekend when she travelled through the streets of Manhattan <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170716214139/http://gothamist.com/2017/05/14/spiceys_back_melissa_mccarthy_snl.php#photo-1">as part of a sketch</a> in which Spicer was frantically searching for Trump (set to the Simon &amp; Garfunkel classic, &quot;The Only Living Boy In New York&quot;). It was a great sketch&#x2014;but the outtakes from it may be even better.</p>

<p>Watch below as she struggles to grab hot dogs, screams Trump&apos;s name while in traffic, gets serenaded with love from eager fans, and roasts in the sun: &quot;I just need a couple minutes in a bush to get it together.&quot;</p>
