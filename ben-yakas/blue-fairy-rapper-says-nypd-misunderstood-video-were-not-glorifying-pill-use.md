<p>This week, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130510161518/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/15/video_nypd_arrested_blue_fairy_and.php#photo-1">the NYPD arrested 32 people</a> who they say were involved with buying and selling prescription drugs, cocaine, heroin, guns, and other drugs on Staten Island. They were particularly jazzed about arresting Sharissa Turk, who they described in a press release as &quot;a 22-year-old who plays a blue fairy in an amateur music video rhapsodizing prescription drug abuse.&quot; But according to Incite DaRiot, Turk&apos;s fiance and the producer of the &quot;My World Is Blue&quot; song, police completely misunderstood their intentions with the video: &quot;We&apos;re not glorifying pill use, we&apos;re showing that you&apos;ll literally end up in jail, the fucking gutter, or worse.&quot;</p>

<p>Incite&#x2014;who is one-half of rap group &quot;White Trash Clan&quot; with his partner Anonymous, aka Daniel Haley (Incite also requested we use his rap name)&#x2014;said the duo made the video last summer as an attempt to make fun of the pervasive drug culture of Staten Island. &quot;I knew at some point this is gonna be controversial,&quot; he told us, calling the video a parody. &quot;The general idea was to show how people on Staten Island are. It&apos;s ridiculous, there are people going to different doctors, making up different shit about their injuries. We just thought: &apos;people will understand where we&apos;re coming from.&apos;&quot;</p>

<p>Haley, 27, said he had been hooked on pills years ago: &quot;To say I would glorify that, families get all fucked up from this shit, I never would,&quot; he told us. &quot;People think we&apos;re out there promoting it&#x2014;we&apos;re trying to spread awareness.&quot; Neither Haley nor Incite were arrested during the NYPD raids. &quot;Oxycodone is just huge. kids getting high on that,&quot; Haley added. &quot;The kids think since they&apos;re doing prescription pills, it&apos;s not as bad as heroin, cocaine, it isn&apos;t gonna fuck you up. But they destroy lives.&quot;</p>

<p>As for &quot;blue fairy&quot; Turk, who works at Edible Arrangements, she has been accused of selling Oxycodone to an undercover cop on three separate occasions. Incite admitted she did have a drug problem, but insisted she isn&apos;t a drug dealer, and police had lumped her in with other suspects she had nothing to do with. &quot;She&apos;s not connected to any of these other people, whoever they are, she was not involved in any of the other crimes that took place,&quot; he said. &quot;Cops probably thought she was more involved than she was. But they realize now she&apos;s not a player, she&apos;s just someone involved in a few incidents.&quot;</p>

<p>As for why the cops singled her out, Incite admitted the video may not have helped her, despite their intentions: &quot;I think the police may have been offended [by the video]. They were probably inquiring who these people are, who is this girl, why are they making fun of the cops.&quot; Considering the fact the police included a description of her role in the video when announcing the arrest, this seems likely. This is how they described her:</p>

<blockquote>Turk appears in the video, which shows people dancing inside Duane Reade drug stores as well as in and around various Staten Island locations. The video, titled, &#x201C;My World is Blue,&#x201D; rhapsodizes drug use and culture on Staten Island, with lyrics like &#x201C;I can stop when I want to / I&#x2019;m not addicted / I don&#x2019;t take pills / crush and sniff it / Blue is my world in this life how I live it / Come out to Staten Island, pay a little visit.&#x201D;</blockquote>

<p>&quot;The video was made to show the downfall of drug users, and bring attention to the epidemic that every Staten Islander is fully aware of. We thought, &apos;Let&apos;s take a risk, let&apos;s address something that&apos;s really serious,&apos;&quot; Incite said. &quot;We know people have family members that have died because of this shit, so we didnt want to make fun of it.&quot;</p>

<p>Incite added that Turk had been placed into an outreach drug rehabilitation program: &quot;Something good did come out of something bad&#x2014;the good thing is she is getting the help that she needs.&quot; If she completes it, Incite said the charges would be expunged from her record.</p>

<p>Neither man is apologetic about the video though. &quot;We did it to promote awareness of problem of pills,&quot; said Haley. &quot;The video went from 8,000 views to 25,000 views in a few days, that&apos;s another couple thousand people aware there&apos;s fucked up stuff going on. If that&apos;s all that comes out of this, then mission fucking accomplished.&quot;</p>
