<p>Earlier this week, Netflix kicked off their major promo campaign for the new season of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522122327/http://gothamist.com/tags/arresteddevelopment"><em>Arrested Development</em></a> by launching <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522122327/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/08/arrested_developments_frozen_banana.php">the Bluth&#x2019;s Original Frozen Banana Stand Worldwide Tour in London</a>, because there&apos;s always marketing in the banana stand. But they promised that the stand would also make its way across the pond, and now we know where and when that&apos;ll be: this Monday May 13th, the stand will be located diagonally across from Radio City Music Hall from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. </p>

<p>The stand will be giving out free frozen bananas, you&apos;ll be able to take photos inside of it, and most likely, some cast members will show up on the Orange Carpet as well&#x2014;as you can see above, Michael Cera, David Cross, Jeffrey Tambor, Alia Shawkat, and Tony Hale all popped by the London location this week. But please, no touching if they are there.</p>

<p>While you try to come up with some excuse to leave work for an hour in the middle of the day Monday, check out <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522122327/http://laist.com/2013/05/10/new_arrested_development_spoilers.php">more tantalizing details about the upcoming season.</a> And maybe think twice before you try to prove once and for all whether there is money in the banana stand.</p>
