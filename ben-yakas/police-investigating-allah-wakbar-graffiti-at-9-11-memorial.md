<p>The police are investigating a possible hate crime at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150528011157/http://gothamist.com/tags/911memorial">9/11 Memorial and Museum</a> today. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150528011157/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/World-Trade-Center-Memorial-Hate-Crimes-Graffiti-160710855.html">According to NBC</a>, a custodian found the words &quot;Allah Wakbar&quot; written on a granite seat at the memorial on Tuesday. The graffiti was written in pink and black marker on a seat in the plaza area between the north and south pools.</p>

<p>The NYPD Hate Crimes Task Force believes it was written there around 10:30 p.m. Tuesday, but that area has no security cams on it. The phrase has since been removed by power wash, but the investigation is ongoing. This is only the latest incident to take place at the memorial&#x2014;last week, a bunch of bratty middle schoolers who were on a trip to the site <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150528011157/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/24/little_brats_kicked_out_of_911_memo.php">were kicked out of the memorial</a> for throwing baseballs and trash into the reflecting pool. As one of them so eloquently put it: &#x201C;No one was disrespecting. It wasn&#x2019;t nothing like that. No one was being serious. Everyone was kind of bored and it was just something to do.&#x201D;</p>
