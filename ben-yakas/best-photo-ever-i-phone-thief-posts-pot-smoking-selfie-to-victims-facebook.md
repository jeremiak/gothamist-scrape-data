<p>It&apos;s one thing to join the ranks of this city&apos;s many hopelessly stupid <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604141859/http://gothamist.com/tags/iphone">iPhone thieves</a>&#x2014;it&apos;s entirely another thing to accidentally make yourself the poster child for such stupidity. According to cops, the iPhone thief you can see up top accidentally posted photos of himself taking some big hits of weed onto the victim&apos;s Facebook page&#x2014;because her phone was linked with her Facebook account to automatically post any photos.</p>

<p>Cops say the thief stole the phone from the 27-year-old victim on March 2nd near East Tremont Avenue and the Grand Concourse in the Bronx at around 3 a.m. The suspect jumped the victim then ran off with her phone; the woman was unharmed in the attack. </p>

<p>Anyone with information in regards to this incident is asked to call Crime Stoppers at 1-800-577-TIPS (8477).  The public can also submit their tips by logging onto the Crime stoppers website at WWW.NYPDCRIMESTOPPERS.COM or by texting their tips to 274637 (CRIMES) then enter TIP577.<br>
