<p>Yesterday, it was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150730152914/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/16/bizarre_love_triangle_nypd_edition.php">reported</a> that the wife of a Bronx NYPD precinct commander had been beaten by two masked men on Valentine&apos;s Day; officials then began investigating a sordid police love triangle between her husband and another officer. But it turns out that Tsui D&apos;Adamo <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150730152914/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2011/02/17/2011-02-17_wife_of_nypd_deputy_inspector_lied_when_she_said_masked_black_man_beat_her_up_co.html">was lying</a> to police the whole time&#x2014;especially the part about two <em>black men</em> beating her up.</p>

<p>D&apos;Adamo <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150730152914/http://www.lohud.com/article/20110216/NEWS03/102160374/-1/newsfront/Clarkstown-cops-probe-beating-of-NYPD-official-s-wife-outside-New-City-home">told police</a> that two black men, one wearing a bandanna around his face, assaulted her Monday afternoon, punching and kicking her to the ground. The week before, someone slashed the tires of the department car of Deputy Inspector John D&apos;Adamo, commanding officer of the 52nd Precinct in the Bronx. D&apos;Adamo also said someone approached her last week and threatened her. But there were inconsistencies with D&apos;Adamo&apos;s story, and her bruises didn&apos;t match up with her account of the beating. &quot;She put up a good act and the officers at the scene were convinced that she was traumatized,&quot; said Clarkstown Police Capt. Michael Sullivan.</p>

<p>Eventually, they caught her in the lies: &quot;Our detectives had their doubts and brought her back in for questioning. She admitted she made up the story of being beaten,&quot; said Sullivan. She <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150730152914/http://www.lohud.com/article/20110216/NEWS03/102160374/-1/newsfront/Clarkstown-cops-probe-beating-of-NYPD-official-s-wife-outside-New-City-home">admitted</a> that the she made up the assault story and that her wounds were self-inflicted, and she also admitted that she slashed her husband&apos;s tires. D&apos;Adamo as taken to a Rockland County hospital for a psychiatric evaluation and has yet to be charged with filing a false report. </p>

<p>Having said all that, the cops over at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150730152914/http://theerant.yuku.com/topic/38808/52-Pct--s-wife-hauled---Psyche-Ward-made--entire-assault-sto?page=1">Thee Rant message board</a> are somewhat dubious of the whole story, as they were yesterday; one in particular has a different theory as to what happened: &quot;She has to take the hit, so he woulnt get fired for assaulting her. She wants her 1/2 of his pension. If hes fired she gets nothing. Play the EDP game and she avoids the collar as well. Good lawyer. A buddy at the pension section says that He tried to retire today but was denied due to an active IAB investigation. HMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM?&quot;</p>
