<p>Some days, it feels like we&apos;ve seen every possible <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151108083113/http://gothamist.com/tags/subwayvideo">iteration of bad</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151108083113/http://gothamist.com/tags/subwayetiquette">subway behavior</a> here at Gothamist HQ. And yet, people keep coming up with new variations and mutations of our favorite gross themes. And that&apos;s just what you get <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151108083113/http://www.youtube.com/user/saragita/about">with the video below</a>, in which an older gentleman gets some electric shaving done on the subway, then tops it off with some blatant, full-fingered nose explorations.</p>

<p>You might be saying to yourself&#x2014;hey, he&apos;s an older feller, we should cut him some slack, right? No, we believe he should know better, a lot better than your average <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151108083113/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/15/video_man_licks_shoe_on_subway.php">shoe-licking</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151108083113/http://gothamist.com/tags/clippingnails">toe-nail clipping</a> #YOLO hooligan. Oh sure, maybe if he was using an Army-issued straight razor, we might not be having this conversation (although we definitely would be linking you to <em>Un Chien Andalou</em>). But all you have to do is look at the expression on the face of this man&apos;s poor neighbor, who is doing her best to slowly shift out of range from the hairs falling down like splinters. </p>

<p>And then he dips into his nostril like a dog digging up some <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151108083113/http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/galleries/2013/02/11/richard-iii-mona-lisa-more-famous-skeletons-photos.html#b0ce4131-e82d-4364-9f6b-f0bf34c2241e">Bulgarian vampires.</a> On the other hand, when it comes down to it, maybe we&apos;d rather be seated next to a subtly gross straphanger than one who happens to be channelling the coke-fueled disco moves <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151108083113/http://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/16/movies/disco-legend-but-no-feathers.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm">of Richie Rich.</a> </p>
