<p>For too long, America has had been severely lacking in bicycles that bring the motherfucking ruckus. But <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150920034442/http://gothamist.com/tags/wutangclan">Wu-Tang Clan</a> has heard your cries, and teamed up with State Bicycle Co. to release <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150920034442/http://www.statebicycle.com/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=wutangbike">a line of bicycles</a>! Because bikes rule everything around you, they are selling &quot;custom-outfitted fixed gear and single speed road bikes to commemorate the Wu&apos;s 20th year of bringing the ruckus and shaping urban street culture.&quot;</p>

<p>The fixed gear bike, which comes in Wu-Tang&apos;s beloved black and yellow color (&quot;unmistakable markings of the Wu&quot;), includes an engraved Wu-Tang branded stem holding a set of bullhorn handlebars atop the painted chromoly TIG-welded frame. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150920034442/http://www.statebicycle.com/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=wutangbike">It costs $599</a>, with an expected shipping date of November; they add that it&apos;s likely to sell out, so you better jump on this if you really want to ride it to your <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150920034442/http://gothamist.com/2011/07/27/apply_today_for_an_internship_at_wu.php">Wu-Tang internship</a> while wearing your <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150920034442/http://consequenceofsound.net/2013/08/buy-the-wu-tang-clan-christmas-sweater/">Wu-Tang holiday sweater.</a> </p>
