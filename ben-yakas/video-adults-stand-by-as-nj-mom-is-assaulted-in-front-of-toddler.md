<p>NJ police are looking for a woman who was caught on video <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503001010/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/video-woman-savagely-beaten-front-2-year-old-article-1.1844867">viciously beating another woman</a> in front of her 2-year-old child. The suspect, whom police have identified as 25-year-old LaTia Harris, can be seen in the video below repeatedly punching the 27-year-old victim while a group of other adults stands around watching; the only person who tries to help the victim is the victim&apos;s child.</p>

<p>Harris, a McDonald&apos;s employee, allegedly followed the victim out of the store while still on duty, leading to the fight around 7 p.m. on Tuesday evening in Salem, NJ. The victim, whose name hasn&apos;t been released, has limited vision in her left eye, numerous contusions, a broken nose, and was also threatened with being shot during the attack. Harris is facing charges of aggravated assault and two counts of making terroristic threats.</p>

<p>&quot;There is a moral and social breakdown in the fabric of our, society which is clearly evident when a woman gets pummeled in broad daylight in front of her child while a dozen people pull out their phones to record the incident instead of calling for help,&quot; Salem Chief of Police John J. Pelura III said, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503001010/http://www.nj.com/salem/index.ssf/2014/06/salem_video_beating_suspect_latia_harris_still_sought_by_authorities.html#incart_m-rpt-1">according to South Jersey Times</a>. &quot;There is so little regard for human life &#x2014; by the actor and the bystanders.&quot;</p>

<p>The victim told the cops that the fight started when Harris assaulted her and &quot;accused her of spreading rumors about her [Harris] and her manager.&quot;  Cops add that Harris has not shown up at her job at McDonald&apos;s since the attack.</p>
