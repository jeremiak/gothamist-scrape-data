<p>On Wednesday, former Patriots star tight end Aaron Hernandez <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405015004/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/26/former_patriots_star_aaron_hernande.php">was arrested and charged with murder</a> in the death of Odin Lloyd. More details about the case have now emerged, including a possible motive for the slaying: according <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405015004/http://www.boston.com/metrodesk/2013/06/27/former-patriots-player-aaron-hernandez-probed-two-more-murders-law-enforcement-officials-say/0GPNwDdsU4nguqnB2LADYM/story.html">to the Boston Globe</a>, police are investigating 23-year-old Hernandez for two other murders. &#x201C;The motive might have been that the victim knew [Hernandez] might have been involved,&#x201D; an official told them.</p>

<p>Hernandez, who was cut by the Patriots shortly after being arrested yesterday, was picked up in connection with the shooting of 27-year-old semi-pro football player Lloyd, who was dating the sister of Hernandez&apos;s fiancee. Lloyd&apos;s body was found at a North Attleboro industrial park on June 17, about a half-mile from Hernandez&#x2019;s home. Hernandez and Lloyd had been spotted together, along with two other men, the night before he was found. </p>

<p>Hernandez <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405015004/http://abcnews.go.com/US/patriots-star-aaron-hernandez-charged-murder/story?id=19492508#.UcxuYT7oiCY">has pleaded not guilty</a> to murder and firearms charges in that case. But cops are now probing the deaths of Daniel Abreu and Safiro Furtado, who were both fatally shot just after 2 a.m. on July 16, 2012 in Boston. Investigators believe a fight broke out at a club in the South End between those two men and a group that included Hernandez. After the fight, Abreu and Furtado left:</p>

<blockquote>Abreu, who was driving, stopped at a traffic light on Shawmut Avenue, about to make a left onto Herald Street, when a silver or gray SUV with Rhode Island license plates pulled alongside the sedan. Someone from the SUV opened fire, killing Abreu, 29, and Furtado, 28.</blockquote>

<p>During yesterday&apos;s arraignment, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405015004/http://deadspin.com/reports-hernandez-under-investigation-for-role-in-2012-598421755">the prosecutor claimed that</a> Hernandez had become angry with Lloyd two days before his death, after he had seen him talking to a &quot;certain group of people&quot; at a club.<strong> &quot;You can&apos;t trust anyone anymore,</strong>&quot; the prosecutor claims Hernandez said before meeting Lloyd on the night of the murder.</p>
