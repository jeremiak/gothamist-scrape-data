<p>A teen was arrested this week in the stray-bullet shooting of a young Bronx mom&#x2014;and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160521053329/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2011/08/24/2011-08-24_gunman_couldnt_stand_cutting_in_line_so_he_shot_2.html">police say that</a> the fatal accident occurred because of a petty argument over line-cutting. Jeffry Ramirez, 19, confessed to mistakenly shooting 24-year-old mom Yaritza Pacheco at a bodega on E. 174th Street early Sunday morning. And it all started because one of Ramirez&apos;s friends cut in line of another man: <strong>&quot;The guy went and got more people with guns...I went home and got a gun,</strong>&quot; Ramirez told cops of the incident.</p>

<p>Ramirez&apos;s friend cut in front of 23-year-old Leonard Shoulders at the bodega; when Shoulders returned with guns and backup, Ramirez told police he &quot;was afraid of those guys,&quot; so he then went and got his own gun, which he had bought for $400 the previous month. Pacheco, a manager at an Applebee&apos;s restaurant, had gone to the bodega to get a sandwich, and was walking to meet her boyfriend and 4-year-old daughter when she was hit. Shoulders was also hit in the leg.</p>

<p>Ramirez admitted that he threw the gun in the Bronx River, then booked a one-way JetBlue flight to the Dominican Republic and rushed to JFK, where cops arrested him on the plane. Ramirez <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160521053329/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2011/08/22/2011-08-22_man_arrested_in_shooting_death_of_mom_yaritza_pacheco_24_by_stray_bullet.html">has been charged</a> with second-degree murder, manslaughter and criminal possession of a weapon</p>

<p>Pacheco&apos;s family and friends are devastated by the loss: &quot;She was a very loving mother -- everything centered around her daughter, that&apos;s all she lived for. She was a beautiful person, so sweet.&apos;&apos; her friend Angela Applewhite <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160521053329/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/bronx/stray_bullet_cuts_down_bronx_mom_3daexLYH42N8gOrGOCCY5L">told the Post.</a> Ramirez expressed remorse for the slaying:  &quot;I feel very bad about what happened.&quot; But his lawyers think that police may have coerced Ramirez to get their confession: &quot;I think there was some inappropriate ... police conduct.&quot;</p>
