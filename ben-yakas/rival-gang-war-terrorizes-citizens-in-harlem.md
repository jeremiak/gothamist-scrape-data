One veteran cop told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150724053343/http://nymag.com/news/features/establishments/68516/">NY Magazine</a>, &#x201C;A few years ago, you would see kids 19, 20 years old. <strong>Now these kids are babies&#x2014;15, 14&#x2014;and they are vicious.</strong> They will shoot you in a heartbeat and not think twice about it.&#x201D;<p></p>

<p>Based on a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150724053343/http://pulse.yahoo.com/_2YNTVBW3WGRPESM2KTH2W27QGY/blog/articles/57358?listPage=index">long listing</a> of the many different gangs in Harlem, 2MF operate out of the Drew Hamilton Houses, near W 144th street and 8th avenue, while the 40 Wolvez are down the block on W 140th st. Police believe the turf battle between the two led to the death of 2MF member Jeffrey Bradshaw, 18, who was shot dead on Adam Clayton Powell Blvd; and George White, 15, who was killed twelve days later, leaving a party after Bradshaw&apos;s wake. Neighbors <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150724053343/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/10/28/2010-10-28_deadly_gang_war.html">tell the Daily News</a> that shootings are a regular occurrence in their neighborhood, &quot;but no one is saying anything.&quot; There has not been much written about the two groups, but one can easily find <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150724053343/http://www.myspace.com/190939506">MySpace accounts</a> for many <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150724053343/http://www.myspace.com/younggunzzz140">teens</a> affiliated with the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150724053343/http://www.myspace.com/marcusthehustler">groups</a>, and get a sense of their world.</p>

<p>One mother of three, Maria Sille, told the News that she is planning to move her children (currently ages 3, 6 and 13) away from the street as soon as she can, revealing just how perilous the situation can be. &quot;I&apos;ll move anywhere. My son is 13. At that age, I don&apos;t want him out after 7 p.m.<strong> If I don&apos;t take my son out of here, the gangs will take him.</strong>&quot;</p>
