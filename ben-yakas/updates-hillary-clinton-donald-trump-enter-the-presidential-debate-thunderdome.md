<p><strong>Update 9:50 p.m.</strong> Watching a notably tired and sniffily Trump trading niceties with Clinton for the opening of the debate, I wonder: How did we get here? How are we really here right now? And that was <em>before</em> the yelling started. </p>

<p>To his credit, Donald does seem to have turned the tint down on his tan from &quot;cheeto&quot; to &quot;unripened clementine.&quot; But it feels like Clinton has been far more in control of the conversation, with Trump interjecting pithy comments (&quot;It&apos;s all words, it&apos;s all soundbites&quot;) in flustered attempts to take back the wheel. Clinton noted early on that her website would be fact-checking Trump in real time, and she has consistently pointed out his lies and contradictory quotes. The only time things seemed to work in Trump&apos;s favor was when he brought up Clinton&apos;s deleted emails (which Clinton directly addressed and apologized for at one point). </p>

<p>It&apos;s gotten to the point that Trump&apos;s team is deleting his Tweets as the debate goes on and Clinton calls out more and more of his own words.</p>

<p>Clinton went after Trump for not releasing his tax returns (&quot;there&apos;s something he&apos;s hiding&quot;): &quot;Maybe he&apos;s not as rich as he says he is.&quot; For his part, Trump doesn&apos;t think you learn anything from tax returns. Then again, Trump also thinks that being audited for 15 years is something to be proud of. And that not paying income taxes &quot;makes me smart.&quot; Something something airports!?!?!</p>
