<p>During <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506021939/http://gothamist.com/2014/02/13/video_bill_de_blasio_updates_nyc_on.php">his press conference this morning</a>, Mayor de Blasio started things out by noting that the snowfall had been &quot;heavier and faster than predictions,&quot; with more accumulation than the National Weather Service had expected. &quot;There is the illusion that you can have perfect information and perfect decisions,&quot; he said at one point. Well, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506021939/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/16/video_al_roker_says_hes_sharting_al.php">beloved sharter</a> Al Roker wasn&apos;t happy about that. Cry havoc and let slip the Tweets of war:</p>

<p>In the middle of the presser, a reporter asked de Blasio about Roker&apos;s comments: &quot;I respect Al Roker a lot, watched him on TV for many, many years,&quot; he said with a chuckle. <strong>&quot;It&apos;s a different thing to run a city than to give the weather on TV.&quot;</strong> </p>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Mr. Mayor, I could never run NYC, but I know when it&apos;s time to keep kids home from school</p>&#x2014; Al Roker (@alroker) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506021939/https://twitter.com/alroker/statuses/434013915345719296">February 13, 2014</a></blockquote>

<p>And because he never wants to be left out of any petty squabbles, Gov. Chris Christie chimed in with his own unsubtle subtweet:</p>
