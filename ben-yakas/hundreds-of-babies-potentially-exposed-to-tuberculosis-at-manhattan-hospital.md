<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150103064641/http://www.stlukeshospitalnyc.org/index.aspx">St. Luke&apos;s-Roosevelt Hospital</a> started contacting patients and parents yesterday to inform them that a maternity ward worker <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150103064641/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/hospital-exposed-babies-tb-article-1.1502816">tested positive for tuberculosis</a>, possibly inadvertently exposing hundreds of babies to the disease. &quot;We want to assure everyone that we are taking swift and comprehensive steps to address the situation,&quot; the hospital said in a statement. &quot;If you were recently a patient at Roosevelt Hospital and are not notified within the next few days, then you were not in contact with the infected staff member.&quot;</p>

<p>The employee hasn&apos;t been identified, and it&apos;s unclear how long the employee had it, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150103064641/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Tuberculosis-Manhattan-Hospital-Exposure-Maternity-Ward-St-Lukes-Roosevelt-229978491.html">the parents who notified NBC</a> about the infection gave birth more than two months ago. &quot;Few individuals exposed to someone with TB become infected because infection generally occurs after continuous exposure over several hours,&quot; the hospital added in the statement. &quot;Still, we are taking the extraordinary precautions that we have to address this issue.&quot;</p>

<p>Tuberculosis is an airborne bacterial infection that mostly affects the lungs; it is &quot;extremely curable&quot; if detected and treated. In June, it was reported that there was a TB outbreak in parts of The Bronx (Tremont and portions of the Crotona, Belmont and Claremont sections); in 2008, there was a TB case reported <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150103064641/http://gothamist.com/2008/06/18/tb_case_at_brooklyn_elementary_scho.php">at a Brooklyn elementary school.</a></p>
