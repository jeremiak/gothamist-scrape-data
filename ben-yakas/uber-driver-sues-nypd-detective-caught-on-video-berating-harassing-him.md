<p>Last year, an NYPD detective <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170310025522/http://gothamist.com/2015/03/31/courtesy_professionalism_stfu.php">was captured on video</a> berating and harassing an Uber driver who had the gall to point out the officer wasn&apos;t using his signals while attempting to park. That video racked up more than four million views, leaving driver Humayun Chaudry &quot;humiliated&quot;&#x2014;and now he&apos;s suing the detective and the NYPD for the incident.</p>

<p>The incident took place around 2 p.m. on March 30th, 2015 near the West Side Highway. Chaudry, 33, was about to make a left when he came behind Detective Patrick Cherry in an unmarked car. Cherry was attempting to park without using his blinker or hazard light at a green light; Chaudry came up next to him and gestured for him to use his signal, then drove away. </p>

<p>Cherry then chased him down, pulled him over, and his passenger at the time captured the interaction below: </p>

<p>&quot;When you&apos;re driving up my ass, when I&apos;m trying to park the car, and then you have to do something with your hands,&quot; the officer yelled at the driver. &quot;People are allowed to park their cars on the side of the street without your interference and then you&apos;re opinion about what&apos;s going on. Especially when the person you do it to are the police!&quot;</p>

<p>Cherry then offered Chaudry a &quot;lesson&quot; on interacting with cops: &quot;I got news for you and use this lesson, remember this in the future: don&apos;t ever do that again,&quot; Cherry said. &quot;The only reason you&apos;re not in handcuffs going to jail and getting summonses in the precinct is because I have things to do, that&apos;s the only reason that&apos;s not happening, because this isn&apos;t important enough for me. You&apos;re not important enough.&quot;</p>

<p>Cherry <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170310025522/http://nypost.com/2015/04/03/demoted-cop-who-berated-uber-driver-i-sincerely-apologize/">was investigated</a> by the Civilian Complaint Review Board, who revealed he had been the subject of a dozen prior complaints. Cherry later issued an apology on TV: &#x201C;I apologize. I sincerely apologize,&quot; he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170310025522/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/New-York-NYC-NYPD-Taxi-Driver-Uber-Cop-Video-Tirade-NYC-Detective-298585531.html">said to NBC.</a> &quot;That&#x2019;s not who I am, that&#x2019;s not who I&#x2019;ve been and that&#x2019;s not how I conducted myself as an officer in New York City.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170310025522/http://nypost.com/2016/06/26/uber-driver-files-suit-against-nypd-cop-who-berated-him-city/">Chaudry says</a> he&apos;s barely been able to work since the incident happened. It&apos;s unclear how much he is seeking in the lawsuit.</p>
