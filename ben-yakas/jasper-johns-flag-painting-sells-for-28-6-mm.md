The wax and paper collage was the highest selling item of the 31 works at auction from the art collection of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170425122305/http://gothamist.com/2008/11/05/michael_crichton_dies_at_66.php">late</a> author Michael Crichton. The buyer wasn&apos;t identified, but a Christie&apos;s spokesman said it was purchased by a gallery or other business, rather than an individual.</p>

<p>Johns, who will turn 80 on Saturday, painted at least 20 versions of the &quot;Flag&quot; series in the mid-1960s while living in NYC. He sold this one to Crichton in 1973. It was estimated beforehand to get around $15 million at auction; Johns previous auction record was$18 million in 2007 for &quot;Figure 4&quot; painting. The winning bidder <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170425122305/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/05/12/2010-05-12_jasper_johns_flag_from_collection_of_late_scifi_author_michael_crichton_nets_286.html">told</a> the Daily News, &quot;It&apos;s a very fair price. It&apos;s an iconic picture, and <strong>it&apos;s probably the last opportunity we&apos;ll have to obtain a picture by one of the great American masters.&quot;</strong></p>
