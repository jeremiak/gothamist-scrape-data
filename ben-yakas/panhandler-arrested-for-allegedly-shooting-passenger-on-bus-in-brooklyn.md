<p>A panhandler was arrested yesterday after he allegedly shot a passenger in the hand on a bus in Brooklyn. Police say the incident happened just before 10 a.m. Friday aboard a B12 bus on New York Avenue in East New York. Witnesses say beggar Sean McTerrel, 47, was harassing the passengers onboard for money, including 32-year-old victim Jowainza Maloney. &quot;The arguing was because nobody wants to give the guy who was shooting any money,&quot; rider Carlina Nichols <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504134927/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2014/01/31/witnesses-panhandler-fired-gun-wounded-man-on-bus-in-brooklyn/">told CBS.</a></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504134927/http://nypost.com/2014/01/31/rider-shot-in-hand-on-brooklyn-bus/">The Post reports</a> McTerrel was asking a mother with her baby for change when Maloney stepped in and told him, &#x201C;You&#x2019;re a grown man. You need to go get a job. Stop asking people for money.&quot; McTerrel allegedly told the bus driver he was going to kill Maloney, then threatened Maloney and made racist comments. &quot;He just pulled out a gun, and the guy ran towards him just to hold him; to hold the gun,&quot; Nichols said. &quot;And when he held the gun, the man fires just all kinds of gunfire. It just went all over.&quot;</p>

<p>While struggling with McTerrel, Maloney was shot in the hand. &quot;The bullet went just past my face,&#x201D; Nichols added to the Post. &quot;I&#x2019;m just checking myself to see if I&#x2019;m shot. I was in shock.&quot; The bus driver kept driving despite the shots, and stopped the bus in front of the 73rd precinct. McTerrel and Maloney continued wrestling on the street there: &#x201C;We rolled off the bus because the front door was open,&#x201D; Maloney <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504134927/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/gunman-starts-firing-b12-mta-bus-brooklyn-article-1.1597937">told the Daily News</a>. &quot;I saw my life flash in front of me. I was just trying not to be killed.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He basically tussled him down so he wouldn&#x2019;t hurt anyone else on the bus,&quot; Nichols said. &quot;He&#x2019;s really a hero.&quot; McTerrel has been charged with attempted murder, assault, weapon possession and reckless endangerment. Maloney was taken to Brookdale University Hospital, where he is in stable condition. &quot;I was fighting for my life,&#x201D; Maloney added. &quot;If I hadn&#x2019;t done anything, it would have been worse.&quot;</p>
