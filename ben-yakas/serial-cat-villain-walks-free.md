Sean Lynde, 37, had been charged with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430044908/http://gothamist.com/2009/08/21/man_accused_being_serial_cat_killer.php">killing</a> five of his girlfriend&apos;s cats between <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430044908/http://gothamist.com/2009/08/22/accused_cat_killer_plead_not_guilty.php">October 2008 and January 2009</a>.

<p>The deal was made with the ex, Rachael Strate&apos;s, blessing, because it &quot;spares&quot; her from having to testify in court. Nonetheless, Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Michael Obus was not supremely pleased with the deal, saying <strong>&quot;If not for her desires, this would be hard to accept.&quot;</strong> Lynde also pleaded guilty to a charge of criminal contempt for violating a court order to stay away from Strate&#x2014;he&apos;d posted a picture of her on Craigslist along with an ad soliciting sex.</p>
