<p>Three pre-teens and one teen were arrested this week in connection with three separate <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150103064722/http://gothamist.com/tags/knockout">&quot;knockout&quot; game-style attacks</a>. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150103064722/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20131219/crown-heights/four-young-students-arrested-alleged-knockout-attacks-police-say?utm_content=tomostrowski%40gmail.com&amp;utm_source=VerticalResponse&amp;utm_medium=Email&amp;utm_term=Four%20Young%20Students%20Arrested%20in%20Alleged%20%27Knockout%27%20Attacks%2C%20Police%20Say&amp;utm_campaign=Four%20Young%20Students%20Arrested%20in%20Alleged%20%27Knockout%27%20Attacks%2C%20Police%20Saycontent">DNAInfo reports that</a> a 14-year-old girl and three other children, aged 10 and 11, were arrested for three assaults which took place in October and November. &quot;Kids are kids &#x2014; when you&#x2019;re talking 10 and 11 year olds getting involved in these type of things, sometimes they don&#x2019;t realize the magnitude of what they&#x2019;re doing,&quot; said George Fitzgibbon, the 71st Precinct&apos;s new commanding officer.</p>

<p>The victims of the three attacks included an 11-year-old who was punched in the face, &quot;a youth who was hit with a rock while walking home from school and a youngster who was &quot;mushed&quot; in the face with a plastic bag.&quot; Fitzgibbon added that none of the attacks were motivated by any racial or religious bias, but added, &quot;The only commonality is that basically all the victims were Jewish.&quot;</p>

<p>The minors have all been charged with assault, endangerment and criminal mischief; their names are being withheld because of their ages. Police are still investigating several other &quot;knockout&quot; attacks that occurred in NYC this fall. There&apos;s still a whole lot of debate whether any of these attackers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150103064722/http://www.ibtimes.com/inside-brooklyns-knockout-game-scourge-racial-war-or-just-senseless-game-1511256">were targeting Jews in particular</a>, or whether the media <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150103064722/http://gothamist.com/2013/12/18/video_jon_stewart_thinks_media_may.php">has overhyped the story.</a></p>
