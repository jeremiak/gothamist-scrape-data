<p>Last night was the first Congressional Correspondents&#x2019; Dinner&#x2014;or what would have been the 67th Radio-TV Correspondents&#x2019; Dinner&#x2014;and the annual roasting included several hit-and-miss performances. Freshman Sen. Rand Paul <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110402132343/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/03/31/rand-paul-newt-gingrich-wives_n_843085.html">mocked</a> Newt Gingrich (&quot;He may have more war positions than he&apos;s had wives&quot;), Rep. Cedric Richmond jabbed at NPR, while Rep. Ben Quayle <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110402132343/http://www.newsbusters.org/blogs/nb-staff/2011/03/31/open-thread-ben-quayle-roasts-politico-and-everyone-else-whca-dinner">called</a> Politico &quot;the worst media outlet in history&quot; (Politico in turn <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110402132343/http://www.politico.com/click/stories/1103/weiner_wilmore_score_laughs.html">said his</a> &quot;caustic routine drew little more than an awkward silence from the large audience&quot;). But the overwhelming winner of the night was none other than Redditor and Mayoral enthusiast <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110402132343/http://gothamist.com/tags/anthonyweiner">Rep. Anthony Weiner</a>. Watch the video below:</p>

<p>Weiner, who has been on a bit of a comedic kick lately, mocked himself heartily: he started his speech, &quot;I want to keep my remarks brief, because I&apos;m double parked outside and the last thing I need is a ticket,&quot; referring to his owing $2,180 in unpaid Washington DC parking tickets. He joked about his last name (his great-grandfather, who &quot;changed&quot; his last name, was &quot;Harold Shmuck&quot;), and recommended that John Boehner &quot;embrace&quot; his funny-sounding name as well. He talked about his belief in &quot;mandatory gay marriage,&quot; and had this yuck about Michelle Bachmann: &quot;<strong>Michelle Bachmann...she&apos;s probably not here. She&apos;s campaigning in Iowa, and organizing in that important caucus state, because she&apos;s running for president. [pause] That&apos;s all I have for that joke.&quot; <br>
</strong><br>
Weiner also referred to his own well-documented Mayoral aspirations when he spoke about Rahm Emanuel&apos;s absence: <strong>&quot;Who knew that what it takes to be Mayor of a big city is to be a hot-tempered, arrogant, loud Jew with nine-and-a-half fingers? Who knew? And in other words, I&apos;ve taken a job at Arby&apos;s as a meat cutter.&quot;</strong> He also spent some time mocking his &quot;1970s Jew Fro&quot;, comparing his yearbook picture with Rachel from <em>Glee</em>, Jennifer Grey, and Horshack from <em>Welcome Back Kotter.</em> He also had some fun with clips from his appearances on FoxNews. </p>

<p>Weiner was so funny to some, it&apos;s getting some Redditors extra paranoid: yesterday, Weiner <a href="://blog.reddit.com/2011/03/rep-anthony-weiner-answers-your-top.html">answered</a> the top five most upvoted questions from his Reddit AMA comment thread (which jumped into the top biggest threads on the site). <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110402132343/http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/gewy2/rep_anthony_weiner_avoids_your_top_question_about/c1n58lm">Some Redditors</a> are convinced Weiner &quot;trolled you guys hard&quot; with his vague answer to a question about marijuana. You be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110402132343/http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=mEiJ24FfKzg#at=158">the judge.</a></p>
