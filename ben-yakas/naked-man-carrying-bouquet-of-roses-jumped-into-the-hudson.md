<p>A man is presumed dead after he stripped off his clothing and jumped into the Hudson River in The Bronx yesterday. Witnesses told the Post and News that they saw the man in Roberto Clemente Park in the Bronx carrying a large urn and a bouquet of red roses around 10:20 a.m. Saturday. &quot;He was determined to take his life. Once he hit the water he started shaking. He was throwing water in his face. He was trying to hold his face under,&quot; witness Christina Burtos <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502180521/http://nypost.com/2014/05/24/naked-man-carrying-red-roses-jumps-into-nyc-river/">told the Post.</a></p>

Burtos added that a fisherman tried to throw him a rod at one point, but he wouldn&#x2019;t take it: &quot;He was saying, &#x2018;No, no!&apos;&quot; Police say he left behind a cell phone and note, but no ID. No body has been recovered, and the investigation is ongoing.</p>
