<p>Last week, we watched in horror <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509212839/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/16/police_search_for_men_in_beating_of.php">as three men viciously beat up a man</a> who scolded them for spitting on the L train. Now, police <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509212839/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Subway-Attack-Video-L-Train-Suspect-Arrest-Tayari-McClellan-134358323.html">have arrested</a> one of the alleged attackers in the beating. Tayari McClellan, 19, of Brooklyn, has been charged with assault and harassment after an anonymous tipster called the NYPD&#x2019;s Crime Stoppers hotline. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509212839/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/ex-con-tayari-mcclellan-arrested-l-train-assault-article-1.981721">Police say</a> McClellan has eight prior arrests for robbery, assault and fare evasion. Watch the video of the confrontation below the jump.</p>

<p>Police are still searching for the other two assailants in the video. The Post was able to locate the victim, 25-year-old Daniel Endara, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509212839/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/17/l_train_rider_speaks_out_about_subw.php">who spoke out about the incident</a>, and why he stood up to the men on the same evening as his own birthday celebration. Among other things, he had harsh words for voyeurs who stood by and watched him getting beaten: &#x201C;I feel we&#x2019;re in a generation that laughs at people getting beat up. That isn&#x2019;t entertainment. They should have at least called the cops.&#x201D;</p>
