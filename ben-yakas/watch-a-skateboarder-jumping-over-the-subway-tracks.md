<p>Earlier this year, we <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150412232518/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/20/photo_skateboarder_jumps_over_subwa.php">received a dramatic photo</a> of a skateboarder jumping over the tracks at the 145th Street stop in Harlem. This photo, shot by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150412232518/http://www.allenying.com/">Allen Ying</a>, came from a video shoot for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150412232518/http://mandibleclaw.blogspot.com/">MandibleClaw</a> (aka director Colin Read). His video, &quot;Tengu: God of Mischief,&quot; is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150412232518/http://mandibleclaw.bigcartel.com/product/tengu-gods-of-mischief-pre-order">now available to order</a>&#x2014;and someone has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150412232518/http://www.reddit.com/r/skateboarding/comments/1s57wz/ollie_the_subway_tracks_gif_finally/">already uploaded</a> a full gif of the daring subway ollie, which you can see below. </p>

<p><br>Read <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150412232518/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/26/video_not_every_subway_skateboarder.php">wrote previously</a> about the shoot, &quot;We waited till about 5 a.m. to get this trick but it was worth it. I wasn&#x2019;t sure [skateboarder] Koki was going to do it when we went down, but after a few run ups he landed it first try.&quot; You can see two trailers for the video below, including one in which Koki wipes out while trying to do the jump (skip to :24 in the first video).</p>

<p>Adding to the danger of the already wildly dangerous shoot, Koki was jumping TOWARD the third rail. &quot;People online have been saying he should&apos;ve come from the other side, so he wasn&apos;t going toward the third rail, but it would have been impossible,&quot; Ying explained <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150412232518/http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2013/03/skateboarder-jumps-over-nyc-subway-tracks.html">to Daily Intel</a>. &quot;We had scouted the subway pretty well. This spot is probably the only one where that was doable.&quot;</p>

<p>According to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150412232518/http://www.mta.info/nyct/TransitAdjudicationBureau.html">NYC Transit Rules of Conduct</a>, it&apos;s a violation just to STAND on a skateboard on the subway. And considering the rather frequent <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150412232518/http://gothamist.com/tags/subwayfatalities">subway fatalities</a>, we wouldn&apos;t recommend any amateur skateboarders try this out anytime soon. But if you want one more taste of &quot;Tengu,&quot; check out ManibleClaw&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150412232518/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/13/video_there_aint_no_skateboarding_l.php">previous subway skateboarding video</a> from 2011.</p>
