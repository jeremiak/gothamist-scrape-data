<p>Along with massive amounts of snow this winter, NYC has also had to deal with treacherous conditions due to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420040208/http://gothamist.com/2014/02/14/photos_nyc_ice_slush.php#photo-1">slush lakes and ice lagoons</a>. Large parts of the sidewalks have been transformed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420040208/http://gothamist.com/2014/02/06/the_city_is_your_skating_rink.php">into personal skating rinks</a>, to delight of personal injury attorneys everywhere. The risk of slipping on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420040208/http://gothamist.com/tags/ice">ice</a> (especially <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420040208/http://gothamist.com/tags/blackice">black ice</a>) is incredibly dangerous and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420040208/https://www.google.com/search?q=slipped+ice+died&amp;oq=slipped+ice+died&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0.1642j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;espv=210&amp;es_sm=91&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=dies+after+slipping+on+ice">possibly life threatening.</a> There&apos;s nothing funny about it&#x2014;unless you&apos;re this dad. In that case, it is possibly the funniest thing to ever exist. </p>

<p>&quot;I&apos;m not laughing at you, I&apos;m laughing with you,&quot; says Alan, the father who narrates the video in between fits of laughter instead of, ya know, warning the kids about the ice. It&apos;s unclear exactly where this video takes place (though it seems to be some location where the kids are not used to watching out for ice), but that just makes it all the more universal.  Alan is your dad, he&apos;s my dad, he&apos;s the personification of <em>noooo daaaaaad stop ittttt</em> taken to its logical, somewhat evil conclusion. He&apos;s filled with mirth at the sight of young children wiping out again and again, and nothing can sate his lust. His laughter contains multitudes&#x2014;you can&apos;t help but be amused by his joyful reaction to six minutes of pratfalls. And he is now the poster child for Dadenfreude.  </p>
