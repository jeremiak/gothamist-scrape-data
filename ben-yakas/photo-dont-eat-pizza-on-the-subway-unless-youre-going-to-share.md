<p>Putting aside certain <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171015163942/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/10/potato_chip_peacemaker_stops_fight.php">potato chip peacemakers</a>, our feelings about eating on the subway <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171015163942/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/27/food_fight_state_senators_want_to_o.php">have been made abundantly clear:</a> if you <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171015163942/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/18/video_subway_spaghetti_spat_sparks.php">eat spaghetti</a> on the subway, you&apos;re going to have a bad time.
