A new grand jury probe is targeting up to 40 Bronx cops, including delegates from the city&apos;s largest police union, for a ticket-fixing scheme. &quot;Guys are being asked what do they know about cops getting gifts or asking for gifts. They&apos;re talking about indictments for larceny. They&apos;re talking about indictments for bribery. ... It&apos;s not going to be pretty,&quot; one source <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160304023727/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2011/04/09/2011-04-09_up_to_40_bronx_cops_eyed_in_grand_jury_ticketfix_probe__bribery_larceny_charges_.html">told the News</a>. Noted scofflaw Anthony Weiner must really be wondering what he&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160304023727/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/29/anthony_weiner_owed_2180_in_dc_park.php">doing wrong</a>.<p></p>

<p>Internal Affairs investigators pulled summons records from all 12 Bronx precincts between August 2009 through last June. The investigation was jump started with a separate Internal Affairs probe into a delegate suspected of having ties to a drug dealer. During that investigation, the officer, who is on modified duty, was heard on a wire asking a PBA delegate to fix a summons. The source told the News that over two dozen cops are suspected of making summonses disappear in exchange for gifts, a felony. At least 10 others are suspected of lesser crimes, including losing tickets that they had &quot;taken care of.&quot; We thoroughly condemn this type of behavior...unless of course a cop wants to help us out with a few outstanding tickets.</p>
