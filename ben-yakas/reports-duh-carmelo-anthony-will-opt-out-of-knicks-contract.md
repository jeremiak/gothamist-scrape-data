<p>It&apos;s been several merciful months since we&apos;ve seriously thought about the bruised and battered corpse of a basketball organization that is the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506172256/http://gothamist.com/tags/knicks">New York Knickerbockers</a>. All good things must come to an end, and so it is with a heavy sigh that we turn our attention back to the Knicks and their latest drama: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506172256/http://gothamist.com/tags/carmeloanthony">Carmelo Anthony</a> is reportedly planning to opt out of his contract with the Knicks and test the waters of free agency. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506172256/http://espn.go.com/new-york/nba/story/_/id/11119636/carmelo-anthony-new-york-knicks-opt-contract">Nothing is official</a> until tomorrow, but everyone is confirming it anyway.</p>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Can confirm that Carmelo will opt out. Actually submitted his formal ETO letter on Friday stating his intentions to do so, per a source.</p>&#x2014; Chris Herring (@HerringWSJ) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506172256/https://twitter.com/HerringWSJ/statuses/480768816280915970">June 22, 2014</a></blockquote>

<p>So much for the Phil Jackson <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506172256/http://nypost.com/2014/04/30/phil-jackson-has-two-hour-dinner-with-carmelo-anthony/">wine-and-dine</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506172256/http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/basketball/knicks/phil-jackson-advises-carmelo-anthony-opt-contract-article-1.1811389">factor</a>. The Chicago Bulls reportedly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506172256/http://www.cbssports.com/nba/writer/ken-berger/24593842/draft-buzz-bulls-seeking-help-for-derrick-rose">really want him</a>, and a lot of other teams are interested but may or may not have the space for him (Dallas, Miami, Houston, Boston). This doesn&apos;t necessarily mean Anthony is leaving of course&#x2014;he can still re-sign with the Knicks for a maximum contract worth $129 million over five years; he can only sign a max deal worth $96 million over four years with another team. If we&apos;ve learned anything from Chris Tucker, it&apos;s that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506172256/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0spLaQ0Gzjo">money talks.</a></p>

<p>And so we are left with lots of questions: is Melo just trying to get the Knicks to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506172256/https://twitter.com/AzazNYK/status/480766648547549185">pay him the max amount</a>, or is he actually interested in starting over in Chicago? Are there any other suitors who can afford him? What the hell <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506172256/https://twitter.com/KnicksFanBlog/status/480757238743572481">kind of team would they be</a> without Melo? If Melo leaves, will the organization blow up the team? Why <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506172256/https://twitter.com/ecualibrium/status/480804012778725377">the fuck</a> did we trade for Andrea Bargnani? Are there any free agents who would be willing to come here at this point? Why are the Knicks <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506172256/https://twitter.com/gbnypat/status/480767065435828224">so sad</a>? </p>
