<p>Sports Illustrated announced today that it has named Yankees Captain and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110704124012/http://gothamist.com/2009/11/19/derek_jeter_lands_on_post_cover_wit.php">sometime Post</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110704124012/http://gothamist.com/2009/11/13/jeter_slums_it_for_movie_lands_on_p.php">Cover-Model</a> Derek Jeter its Sportsman of the Year.
