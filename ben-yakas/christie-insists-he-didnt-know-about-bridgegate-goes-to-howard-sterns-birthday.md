<p>A day after a former top Port Authority official <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508154937/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/31/port_authority_official_claims_chri.php">claimed &quot;evidence exists&quot;</a> proving Gov. Chris Christie knew about the lane closings on the George Washington Bridge, Christie has steadfastly denied any wrongdoing in the ongoing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508154937/http://gothamist.com/tags/bridgegate">Bridgegate scandal</a>. &quot;Mr. [David] Wildstein&apos;s lawyer confirms what the Governor has said all along&#x2014;he had absolutely no prior knowledge of the lane closures before they happened and whatever Mr. Wildstein&apos;s motivations were for closing them to begin with,&quot; Christie said <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508154937/http://www.state.nj.us/governor/news/news/552014/approved/20140131d.html">in a statement</a>. &quot;The Governor denies Mr. Wildstein&apos;s lawyer&apos;s other assertions.&quot;</p>

I&apos;m here to bring all praise from New Jersey to Howard Stern,&quot; Christie said on stage. He then introduced &quot;one of New Jersey&apos;s favorite sons, one of my good friends, and a great artist,&quot; Jon Bon Jovi, who performed &quot;Wanted Dead Or Alive.&quot;</p>

<p>Christie only stayed at the event for about 30 minutes before leaving. Stern defended Christie before the event: &quot;I happen to be a Chris Christie fan, and I think he&apos;s been very good for New Jersey, so I would be upset to see him get into that kind of trouble, because...it&apos;s one of these things like Watergate, it shouldn&apos;t happen, it&apos;s chickenshit. But he&apos;s a great governor, so I&apos;d like to see him succeed.&quot;</p>
