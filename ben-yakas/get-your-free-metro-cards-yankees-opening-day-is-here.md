And the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111119031331/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/20/yankees_fueled_by_underdog_status.php">&quot;underdog&quot;</a> Yankees are hyped up to make a deep postseason run, regardless of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111119031331/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/30/for_2011_yankees_starting_pitching_1.php">questionable rotation</a>. Of course, ESPN is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111119031331/http://espn.go.com/blog/new-york/yankees/post/_/id/13830/will-opening-day-be-a-rainout">reporting</a> that today&apos;s 1 pm game against the Detroit Tigers is &quot;iffy&quot; because of the weather. But that doesn&apos;t mean you shouldn&apos;t hop on a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111119031331/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/28/water_taxi_will_taxi_you_to_basebal.php">one-way water-taxi</a> to the Bronx, since you&apos;re guaranteed to have a ride home!<p></p>

<p>Because no matter what, at least one Yankees fan will be at the stadium doing her thing: City Transportation Commissioner Janette Sadik-Khan <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111119031331/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/bronx/fare_ball_for_bomber_fans_5MCis7jrCrBZ5LIOWzwYFL?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">will be distributing</a> free MetroCards as part of her anti-drunken-driving campaign today. The campaign hopes to dissuade people who have had a few too many drinks from driving home after the game. &quot;We have the best &apos;designated drivers&apos; in the world in our city&apos;s subways and buses, and if you&apos;re going to drink on Opening Day, take the train,&quot; said Bronx Borough President Ruben Diaz Jr., who will join Sadik-Kahn there.</p>

<p>Ace CC Sabathia will get the start, if today&apos;s game does happen, against the Tigers&apos; Justin Verlander. You can check out the starting lineups <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111119031331/http://espn.go.com/blog/new-york/yankees/post/_/id/13825/here-we-go-game-1-tigers-yankees">here.</a> Here&apos;s hoping that the game isn&apos;t postponed, and Martha Stewart gets to blog from first base <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111119031331/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/14/yankees_opening_day_through_martha.php#photo-1&gt;again this year&lt;/a&gt;. In other news, the Mets will play against the Florida Marlins tomorrow (if there is no snow storm), hoping to keep their undefeated season perfect.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
