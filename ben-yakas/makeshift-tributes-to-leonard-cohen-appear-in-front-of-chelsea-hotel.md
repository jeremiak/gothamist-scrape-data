<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161117083949/http://gothamist.com/tags/leonardcohen">Leonard Cohen</a>&#x2014;poet, sage, musician, lover&#x2014;died <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161117083949/http://laist.com/2016/11/10/leonard_cohen_has_died.php">last week</a> at the age of 82. It was another deeply-felt loss in a week filled with such losses for much of the nation&#x2014;and as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161117083949/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/12/bowie_memorial.php">with David Bowie</a> at the start of the year, many New Yorkers paid tribute to Cohen by putting flowers, letters, photos and more outside the famed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161117083949/http://gothamist.com/tags/chelseahotel">Chelsea Hotel</a> in Manhattan.</p>

<p>Cohen will forever be tied to the Chelsea Hotel because of his 1974 classic, &quot;Chelsea Hotel #2&quot; (from the highly underrated <em>New Skin For The Old Ceremony</em>), which detailed a sexual encounter with Janis Joplin there. In later live performances, Cohen would often recount the story of how they met in an elevator while introducing the tune: &quot;She was riding it with as much delight as I was. Even though she commanded huge audiences, riding that elevator was the only thing she really knew how to do,&quot; Cohen says in the clip below. </p>

<p>&quot;Finally, I gathered my courage,&quot; he continued. &quot;I said to her, &apos;Are you looking for someone?&apos; She said, &apos;Yes, I&apos;m looking for Kris Kristofferson.&apos; I said, &apos;Little lady, you&apos;re in luck, I&apos;m Kris Kristofferson.&apos; Those were generous times, and even though she knew I was somewhat shorter than Kris Kristofferson, she never let on. A great generosity prevailed in those doomed decades.&quot; (Note: Cohen later came to regret naming Joplin as the subject of the song, telling the BBC that it was &quot;an indiscretion for which I&apos;m very sorry, and if there is some way of apologizing to the ghost, I want to apologize now, for having committed that indiscretion.&quot;)</p>

<p>Cohen&apos;s son Adam released his own tribute to his father on social media, thanking fans for their sympathy and remembering his father as only he could: &#x201C;As I write this I&#x2019;m thinking of my father&#x2019;s unique blend of self-deprecation and dignity, his approachable elegance, his charisma without audacity, his old-world gentlemanliness and the hand-forged tower of his work.&quot;</p>
