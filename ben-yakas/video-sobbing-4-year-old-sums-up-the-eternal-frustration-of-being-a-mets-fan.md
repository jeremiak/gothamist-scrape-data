<p>The Mets may be on the verge of a surprise subway series sweep of the Yankees, but it&apos;s a mirage in the middle of a vast, Citi Field-spanning desert. Take away Matt Harvey and David Wright, and you&apos;ve got Ike Davis and Jeremy Hefner as the cornerstones of a fantastic Double-A team. The sobbing child in the video below has realized that fact&#x2014;he&apos;s also had an epiphany that his parents have trapped him into a life of being a Mets fan. It&apos;s a life of looking at called strike threes with the bases loaded, a life of staring at our free-spending brothers in the Bronx in awe and ire. We all just want one chance at being a winner, kid. We all do.</p>
