<p>An asthmatic grandmother who has been accused of assaulting one of her children was dragged out of her apartment by cops while naked earlier this month. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141005012226/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/nypd-officers-drag-naked-brooklyn-woman-apartment-video-article-1.1889292">News has video of the incident</a>, showing 48-year-old grandmother Denise Stewart being yanked naked out of her Brownsville apartment on July 13th, after cops responded to a domestic disturbance call. You can hear the woman calling for oxygen (amidst a LOT of screaming) as she stood naked in her hallway for over two minutes, surrounded by around a dozen (mostly male) cops.</p>

<p>Stewart fainted at one point during the incident. &quot;It&#x2019;s disgusting and embarrassing. I&#x2019;ve been married 16 years. It took my husband 10 years to see my nakedness,&#x201D; she <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141005012226/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/nypd-officers-drag-naked-brooklyn-woman-apartment-video-article-1.1889292">told the News</a> this week. &quot;I didn&#x2019;t do nothing wrong.&quot; Cops said they were called to the building over a disturbance, but not given an apartment number; they heard shouting from Stewart&apos;s apartment, and say that her 12-year-old daughter had &quot;visible injuries&quot; to her face. The 12-year-old allegedly told officers her mother and older sister had beaten her with a belt.</p>

<p>Stewart was arrested and charged with assaulting a police officer, resisting arrest, acting in a manner injurious to a child and criminal possession of a weapon. Stewart&apos;s 20-year-old eldest daughter, Diamond, was charged with resisting arrest, acting in a manner injurious to a child and criminal possession of a weapon. Stewart&apos;s 24-year-old son Kirkland was charged with resisting arrest; the 12-year-old was also charged with assaulting a police officer, criminal mischief and criminal possession of a weapon.</p>

<p>The family claims that Diamond Stewart&apos;s 4-year-old son was pepper sprayed by cops in the ensuing incident. The family&apos;s lawyer, Amy Rameau, said the disturbance call came from a different apartment on an upper floor, and cops went to the wrong apartment. She added that the city&apos;s Administration for Children&apos;s Services was called to investigate but didn&apos;t find any evidence of neglect, nor injuries to the 12-year-old as cops claimed. &quot;They manhandled (Stewart) and behaved in a deplorable manner,&#x201D; Rameau told the News. &quot;She feels completely mortified. This is about human dignity.&quot;</p>

<p>The incident happened a few days before cops placed asthmatic <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141005012226/http://gothamist.com/tags/ericgarner">Eric Garner</a> in a fatal chokehold in Tompkinsville.</p>
