<p>Last week, a reader <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110805202328/http://gothamist.com/2011/07/29/reader_claims_sleepys_mattress_pad.php#photo-1">wrote us to relate</a> her bedbug tale of woe&#x2014;she claimed that a mattress protector pad from Sleepy&apos;s came with a side dish of two bedbugs, and that Sleepy&apos;s had been uncooperative with her appeals to pay for fumigating her apartment. But it seems the reader&apos;s attempts to &quot;apply some external pressure&quot; onto the company worked&#x2014;as we heard straight from the mouth of Sleepy&apos;s COO, Adam Blank: &quot;She has been taken care of completely, and now she&apos;s a happy Sleepy&apos;s customer.&quot;</p>

<p>Blank called us earlier this week to confirm that he had become aware of the accusations after our story, the situation had been handled, and a deal had been worked out. He said he had spoken to the reader himself after her odyssey into the frustrating world of customer service, and noted, &quot;we make our customers happy.&quot;</p>

<p>The reader previously told us that the company had acknowledged that the bedbugs were inside the pad, but Blank seemed a bit dubious about that, and said that it had never been fully established whether the  dead adult and small living bug our reader found were in fact bedbugs: </p>

<blockquote>A bedbug can&apos;t come out of a sealed package that comes directly from our manufacturer. Bedbugs feed on blood from humans, that&apos;s what they need to survive. In a sealed package that comes from a manufacturer, there&apos;s no food source for them to be alive.</blockquote>

<p>We contacted the reader to ask whether Blank&apos;s summation of the situation was correct: &quot;While I am not at liberty to discuss the details and wouldn&apos;t say I am a &apos;happy Sleepy&apos;s customer&apos;, I am satisfied with the outcome.&quot; For future reference, the NYC Department of Consumer Affairs told us that consumers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110805202328/http://www.nyc.gov/html/doh/bedbugs/html/home/home.shtml">in this situation</a> should file a complaint with the DCA by calling 311 or using their online complaint form. </p>
