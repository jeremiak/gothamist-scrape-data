<p>Former American Idol winner and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151224140032/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-pLZiWVA2k">Toyota saleswoman</a> Kelly Clarkson tweeted about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151224140032/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/29/kelly_clarkson_reveals_she_is_part.php">her love for Ron Paul this week</a>, pledging to vote for him if he wins the Republican presidential nomination. As a result, many of her followers attacked her, sending her a barrage of angry tweets. But the Ron Paul Nation is nothing if not fiercely loyal, and they had her back in a big way <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151224140032/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/kelly-clarkson-album-sales-surge-ron-paul-presidential-endorsement-article-1.999207">as sales of her latest album surged</a> because of her support for Paul. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151224140032/http://www.amazon.com/Stronger-Kelly-Clarkson/product-reviews/B005HPY8LU/ref=cm_cr_dp_synop?ie=UTF8&amp;showViewpoints=0&amp;sortBy=bySubmissionDateDescending#R1HT91DGQZ84FO">As one Amazon user</a> wrote, &quot;I have been a Kelly Clarkson fan for many years, however this is the first album I have purchased of hers. I am doing so to show my appreciation of her support for Ron Paul. I am hopeful that her continued support will allow other artists to show their support as well! RON PAUL 2012!&quot;</p>

<p>Clarkson&#x2019;s <em>Stronger</em> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151224140032/http://money.cnn.com/2011/12/30/news/kelly_clarkson_ron_paul/">climbed from</a> #38 to #7 on Amazon&#x2019;s sales list between Thursday, when she tweeted about Paul, and Friday afternoon. As of now, the album has inched up further to #2 on Amazon; it is also at #12 on Apple&#x2019;s iTunes Album Chart. And the legion of Paul fans showed their appreciation for Clarkson&apos;s intelligence in supporting Paul in the album reviews. Here are a couple highlights:</p>

<blockquote>I was always a casual fan of Kelly Clarkson&apos;s because she is really so talented you couldn&apos;t ignore her if you have an ear for talent like I do. That being said, I became a real fan when I learned she was intelligent, too! Ron Paul fans will give you the shirt off their backs, but they&apos;ll also help you sell your music!!! I bought your album &quot;stronger&quot; today, and although I already know of all the songs, I can&apos;t wait to listen to them again knowing that you are a RP supporter!!!</blockquote>

<blockquote>Kelly Clarkson is a talented singer and has put out some good music but I&apos;m lending my support because of her choice to step up and speak her voice! I respect her for supporting Ron Paul, it&apos;s great to see someone as influential as her support a worthy candidate while others try to tear him down! Go Kelly Clarkson and go Ron Paul!!!!</blockquote>

<blockquote>She is Smart and Strong Enough to Endorse Ron Paul...so we are all buying her excellent album. It just shot from 41st to 1st on Amazon! Great album! Pay attention, Hollywood! Be brave enough to endorse the pro-minority-rights, pro-gay-rights Ron Paul, and you may get a similar bump!</blockquote>

<blockquote>I&apos;m a new Kelly Clarkson fan. I just bought her album &apos;Strong&apos; and I&apos;m really enjoying it. 

<p>Ron Paul 2012! </p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>Clarkson&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151224140032/http://www.whosay.com/kellyclarkson/content/180496?code=IVK1c5E">initial tweet read</a>, &quot;I love Ron Paul. I liked him a lot during the last republican nomination and no one gave him a chance. If he wins the nomination for the Republican party in 2012 he&apos;s got my vote. Too bad he probably won&apos;t.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151224140032/http://www.whosay.com/kellyclarkson/content/180513?code=lEs1c5W">She later responded</a> to criticisms in a followup tweet: &quot;I am really sorry if I have offended anyone. Obviously that was not my intent. I do not support racism. I support gay rights, straight rights, women&apos;s rights, men&apos;s rights, white/black/purple/orange rights. I like Ron Paul because he believes in less government and letting the people (all of us) make the decisions and mold our country. That is all. Out of all of the Republican nominees, he&apos;s my favorite.&quot;</p>
