Since he started his historically dumb &quot;campaign,&quot; and in particular, began chugging the birther kool-aid, he has succeeded in enraging people from every walk of life, from comedians to TV hosts to entire countries. But who hates The Donald the most? Click through as we take a look at some of Trump&apos;s greatest enemies.</p>
