<p>There really are websites for Trump supporters to date each other&#x2014;TrumpSingles <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170317190328/http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2016/06/11/dating-website-attracts-donald-trump-supporters-looking-love/85747414/">is a real app</a>, though who knows whether anyone is using it&#x2014;but Seth Meyers and his team at <em>Late Night</em> have come up with their own version, Trump Mingles, a tremendous and fantastic tool that is neither sad nor failing. &quot;I just started kissing her, I couldn&apos;t even wait,&quot; one man said in a testimonial. &quot;When you&apos;re a Trump Mingle user, they let you do it.&quot;</p>

<p>Meyers also had a couple of things to say to overtly-racist Iowa Representative Steve King about his overtly-racist tweets about other people&apos;s babies. &quot;In case you&apos;re still wondering if your tweet was racist, you got a shoutout from David Duke,&quot; he said. &quot;As a general rule of thumb, when the former grand wizard of the KKK chimes in to say he agrees with you, it&apos;s time to re-examine your stance. If you make a pork chop and Guy Fieri says, &apos;This is delicious,&apos; throw out the recipe.&quot;</p>

<p>Stephen Colbert started off his show by assessing Winter Storm Stella (a.k.a. Winter Storm Crazy Balls) and talking to one of the <em>Late Show&apos;s</em> &quot;standing outside&quot; team members, Brian Stack. &quot;My eyes and ears are stinging, and my ears are gonna snap off Stephen, can I please come back in?! I&apos;m not a meteorologist!&quot; Stack said. &quot;For the love of god have mercy! Is this about the yogurt I took out of the fridge, I thought that was for everybody!&quot;</p>

<p>Colbert later delved into Paul Ryan&apos;s struggles to convince people the GOP healthcare bill doesn&apos;t suck, and the audio of him vowing to fight Trump that was leaked by Breitbart. &quot;So, why would Breitbart, a far-right website, go after Ryan at this vulnerable time?&quot; Colbert asked. &quot;Well it turns out, they think the new healthcare plan isn&apos;t conservative enough, because, &apos;it does not repeal ObamaCare.&apos; Yeah, 24 million people losing health insurance doesn&apos;t go far enough, they want health care as the founders intended: dying at 35 of Scrivener&apos;s Dropsy.&quot;</p>
