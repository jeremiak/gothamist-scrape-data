<p>It hasn&apos;t even been a week since the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504194827/http://gothamist.com/2014/06/16/game_of_thrones_power_rankings_the_4.php">season finale</a> of season four of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504194827/http://gothamist.com/tags/gameofthrones"><em>Game Of Thrones</em></a>, but we&apos;re already desperately craving some of Hot Pie&apos;s wolf bread. The night is dark and full of terrors, but at least we have this nifty video compilation of every death from season four to tide us over while we continue work on our Hodor erotic fan fiction. </p>
