<p>We&apos;ve seen the worst of the worst when it comes to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160115212000/http://gothamist.com/tags/subwayetiquette">poor subway behavior</a>: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160115212000/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/30/photo_bros_bring_patio_furniture_on.php">bros with patio furniture</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160115212000/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/28/memorable_photo_sleepy_man_hangs_br.php">dudes hanging brain</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160115212000/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/15/etiquette.php">banana peel seat hogs</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160115212000/http://gothamist.com/2012/11/30/two_young_ladies_filmed_giving_thei.php">blow job express trains</a>, etc. But here&apos;s a more subtle subway faux pas: tipster RC spotted the woman above lounging on the subway with her shoes off yesterday. &quot;Shoes off with no fucks to give,&quot; as he put it. </p>

<p>This breaks the most basic tenet of subway etiquette: <strong>respect other people&apos;s space.</strong> You&apos;re in public&#x2014;you shouldn&apos;t treat the subway like your living room, which means you shouldn&apos;t cut your nails, or spit on the ground, or take your shoes off.  Since scientists have yet to perfect Smell-O-Vision, we don&apos;t know how pungent this woman&apos;s feet were, but we&apos;d always rather play it safe and not risk even a passing whiff of sock stench. </p>

<p>Having said that, what&apos;s worse: showing off your socks on the subway, or wearing sandals? Would you rather see cotton or exposed toes?</p>

<p>Anyway, we can all agree that show licking is worse than all these things:</p>
