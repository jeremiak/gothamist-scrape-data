<p>It&apos;s a new year, but the costumed characters of Times Square are up to their old, creepy tricks: a man who dresses as Woody from <em>Toy Story</em> was arrested yesterday for allegedly touching &quot;numerous girls&quot; in Times Square.</p>

He has been charged with forcible touching and sex abuse of several women. </p>

<p>Tim Tompkins, President of the Times Square Alliance, said: &#x201C;This is the latest in a long series of disturbing incidents that reinforce our belief that these costume characters must be licensed and regulated. We are looking forward to working with the new administration and City Council to come up with an equitable and effective regulatory solution.&#x201D; We&apos;ve contacted the NYPD to get more information about the charges, and will update when they respond.</p>

<p>Woody joins a motley crew of creepy costumed characters who have been arrested in recent years for very bad behavior: that includes the Spider-Man <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150928065613/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/11/spider-man_allegedly_attacks_mom_in.php">who allegedly attacked a mom</a>, the Cookie Monster <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150928065613/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/09/times_square_cookie_monster_called.php">who allegedly shoved</a> a two-year-old, the Super-Mario who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150928065613/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/20/super_mario_groper_times_square_bus.php">allegedly groped a tourist</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150928065613/http://gothamist.com/tags/anti-semiticelmo">anti-Semitic Elmo</a> (who is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150928065613/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/09/unapologetic_anti-semitic_elmo_gets.php">currently incarcerated</a>), and of course, the &quot;Weed Man&quot; of Times Square <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150928065613/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/22/times_square_weed_man_arrested_afte.php">who got into a physical altercation</a> with the &quot;Beer Man&quot; of Times Square. We&apos;ll see if this latest arrest finally leads to the NYPD <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150928065613/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/11/times_square_cookie_monster_costume.php">licensing and fingerprinting the costumed characters</a>. Or not:</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: The NYPD told us that Vasquez was arrested on Thursday after he allegedly attacked two women in Times Square that day. Vasquez, who lives in Clifton, NJ, was charged with three counts of forcible touching and sex abuse. <br>
