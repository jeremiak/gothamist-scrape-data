<p>A few weeks ago, <em>Seinfeld</em> fans were a little verklempt after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427122536/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/13/jerry_seinfeld_jason_alexander_are.php#photo-1">Jerry Seinfeld, Jason Alexander and Larry David were all spotted</a> loitering around <strike>Monk&apos;s</strike> Tom&apos;s Restaurant on the Upper West Side. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427122536/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/16/video_jerry_seinfeld_jason_alexande.php">We were told</a> by separate people at the restaurant that they were filming an episode of <em>Comedians In Cars Getting Coffee</em> and/or a Super Bowl commercial. Seinfeld finally <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427122536/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2014/01/30/on-wfan-jerry-seinfeld-reveals-new-details-about-mysterious-project/">offered a few details</a> about the secret project to WFAN yesterday, and at least confirmed the most important thing: this is a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427122536/http://gothamist.com/tags/seinfeld"><em>Seinfeld</em></a> reunion of some sort, with multiple other characters from the show involved. Sweet fancy Moses!</p>

<p>Seinfeld, who appeared on WFAN&#x2019;s &#x201C;Boomer &amp; Carton&#x201D; show Thursday to mostly talk all things Super Bowl, said confusingly that the project was neither a commercial nor an episode of his web series, but at the same time, it&#x2019;s &#x201C;not not those things, either. It&#x2019;s a secret project.&#x201D; Ok...</p>

<p>Thankfully, the show&apos;s producer, Al Dukes, was as unsatisfied with Seinfeld&apos;s evasions as we were, and pressed Jerry into doing a game of 20 questions about the project. He said the project is &quot;a short-ish form,&quot; Jason Alexander is playing George Costanza, Larry David was involved but behind-the-scenes, it&apos;s longer than 60 seconds, it was filmed at other locations other than Monk&apos;s (but not Jerry&apos;s apartment), other <em>Seinfeld</em> characters are involved, he thinks this is a one-off project, and we&apos;ll see it &quot;very very soon.&quot;</p>

<p>We&apos;re still not convinced this project won&apos;t air during the Super Bowl, considering the timing. But maybe it&apos;s only online. Or maybe Seinfeld has concocted a way to transmit new <em>Seinfeld</em> footage directly to our brains. What if <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427122536/https://twitter.com/Seinfeld2000">Jarry from future</a> come back to change Gorge past? </p>
