<p>We were really, really hoping that things wouldn&apos;t go this way, but it is what it is: we&apos;re very sad to report that the dolphin <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502121806/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/25/bdolphin_reportedly_stranded_in_the.php#photo-1">who got trapped in the Gowanus Canal this afternoon</a> has died. According <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502121806/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2013/01/25/dolphin-stranded-in-gowanus-canal/">to CBS</a>, the dolphin struggled, then stopped moving just after 5:30 p.m. after getting wedged between a rock and a pillar below the Union Street Bridge. Even worse, Aaron Stewart-Ahn was there <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502121806/https://twitter.com/somebadideas/status/294941897548521472">when it happened</a>: &quot;Myself &amp; an ecologist were there at the moment the dolphin died. He cried out. Lifeless breached on concrete piling. Police put up tape.&quot;</p>

<p>The dolphin got stuck in the canal sometime around noon on Friday. As far as we could see, it was struggling for most of the day, surfacing to breathe irregularly. Police and members of the Riverhead foundation were hoping that high tide might have helped the dolphin free itself, but it was obvious that the mammal was injured in some way when it got to the canal.  </p>

<p>Jerry, a worker in the area who lives in Staten Island, had told us: &quot;I feel bad for him. The water&apos;s contaminated. I hope he comes out alright. That&apos;s dirty water. Very disgusting water. The water&apos;s supposed to go all the way around and go back into the ocean, but they&apos;re working on the other end so it doesn&apos;t go out, so it stays here.&quot;</p>

<p>Stewart-Ahn also tweeted this:</p>
