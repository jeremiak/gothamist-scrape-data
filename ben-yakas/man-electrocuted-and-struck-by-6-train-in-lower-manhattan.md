<p>A man was electrocuted and fatally struck by a train in lower Manhattan last night. According to police, the man touched the third rail on the downtown side of the Spring Street station around 10:30 p.m. Thursday. He was then struck by a 6 train and dragged into the tunnel.</p>

<p>&#x201C;This guy was all burnt up,&#x201D; witness Joe Deroski <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505122932/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/subway_electrocution_NnnKVpqWcfpl3JZ6lLs9sN?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20Local">told the Post</a>. &#x201C;We came off the train and all you could smell was burning flesh. He looked like he had been on fire.&#x201D; The victim was pronounced dead at the scene; police haven&apos;t released his name yet. It&apos;s unclear how or why the man ended up on the tracks. </p>
