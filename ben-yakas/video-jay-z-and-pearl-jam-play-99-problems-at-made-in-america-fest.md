<p>According <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130223024353/http://globalgrind.com/entertainment/beyonce-jay-z-made-in-america-walking-through-crowd-photos">to Global Grind</a>, Jay-Z and Beyonce also strolled through the crowd during the fest (in the VIP area), which makes them &quot;down to Earth,&quot; or something. Pearl Jam played for over two hours before Jay-Z&apos;s surprise appearance, mixing hits (such as &quot;Jeremy,&quot; &quot;Alive,&quot; &quot;Better Man&quot; and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130223024353/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNO9ZLZoOQs&amp;feature=plcp">&quot;Daughter&quot;</a>) with b-sides (&quot;WMA&quot;) and covers (&quot;Blitzkrieg Bop,&quot; &quot;Rockin&apos; In The Free World&quot;). Below, watch the band tackle their cover of The Who classic, &quot;Love Reign Over Me&quot;:</p>
