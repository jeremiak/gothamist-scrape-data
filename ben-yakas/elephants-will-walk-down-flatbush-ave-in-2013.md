<p>Earlier this week, it was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170326020719/http://gothamist.com/2010/12/07/ringling_bros_banished_to_nj_next_y.php">reported</a> that the Ringling Brothers and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus will be skipping town to Jersey for the time being. But <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170326020719/http://brooklynpaper.com/stories/33/51/all_barclayscircus_2010_12_17_bk.html">Brooklyn Paper reports</a> today that the circus will soon have a new home in Brooklyn&#x2014;at the Barclays Center. One of the productions of the &#x201C;Greatest Show on Earth&#x201D; will take up residency at the future home of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170326020719/http://gothamist.com/tags/nets">Nets</a> in March 2013, about six months after the arena is slated to open. </p>

It almost makes one forget about all those <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170326020719/http://gothamist.com/tags/nets">irate protests and furious residents.</a></p>
