<p>Earlier this year, citizens of honorary sixth borough Philadelphia <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140624002316/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/11/philly_terrorized_by_swiss_cheese_m.php">were living in terror of a local man</a> who had been approaching women in his car and asking them to put a slice of swiss cheese on his penis and perform sexual acts on him. Cheese enthusiast Christopher Pagano, 42, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140624002316/http://articles.philly.com/2014-06-20/news/50741577_1_montco-man-deleon-flasher">has now pleaded guilty</a> to harassing four women; he&apos;s been sentenced to eight years probation and must go to sex offender treatment. </p>

<p>In addition, he&apos;s been banned from driving, except to work, church and doctors; he also must stay away from his victims. As far as we know, he has not been given any restrictions on his cheese intake.</p>

<p>Pagano, a married father of a 12-year-old girl, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140624002316/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/16/alleged_philly_swiss_cheese_masturb.php">had been facing</a> 25 years in jail if he had gone to trial. This was the third time Pagano had been arrested for cheese-related crimes; he was previously arrested in 2006 and 2009 for soliciting prostitutes to perform cheese-sex acts on him. </p>

<p>Gabby Chest previously claimed she had an encounter with the Swiss Cheese Pervert in 2012, when a &quot;really strange guy&quot; messaged her on OKCupid with a very specific request: &quot;He said he was looking for someone to perform masturbation on him with cheese,&quot; Chest said. &quot;He kept saying how strong his urges were and how desperate he was to find someone to help him with them.&quot; You can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140624002316/http://www.phillymag.com/news/2014/01/11/norristowns-swiss-cheese-pervert/">read the full message she received here.</a></p>
