<p>Former and current NYU instructors are a strange lot: sometimes they are into <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130807022316/http://gothamist.com/2012/09/05/james_francos_former_nyu_professor.php">suing James Franco</a>, or (allegedly!) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130807022316/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/15/nyu_professor_arrested_for.php">taking upskirt photos of women</a>. Sometimes they <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130807022316/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/03/visiting_nyu_professor_fat-shames_p.php">fat-shame PhD candidates</a>, or yell <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130807022316/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/02/former_nyu_teacher_arrested_after_b.php">at dogs indiscriminately</a>. The latest NYU alum in the news is Heleen Mees, who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130807022316/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/ex-nyu-professor-arrested-stalking-citigroup-chief-economist-article-1.1388739">has been arrested for stalking and harassing</a> former lover and Citigroup chief economist Willem Buiter. &#x201C;What can I do to make it right? Shall I lick your b---s?&#x201D; Mees allegedly wrote in one email. If only licking b----s could make everything in a relationship right.  </p>

<p>Mees, 44, had been involved in an &#x201C;intimate relationship&#x201D; with Buiter, 63, a few years ago; Mees, a one-time adjunct at NYU, had dedicated her doctoral thesis to him. After the relationship went bad, Mees allegedly sent him a barrage of emails containing sexual come-ons, photos of herself masturbating and images of other naked women. She asked &#x201C;Shall we adopt a child?&#x201D; and also wrote &#x201C;Hope your plane falls out of the sky&#x201D; (though hopefully not in the same message).</p>

<p>Mees also allegedly targeted Buiter&#x2019;s economist wife, Anne, and children, sending them messages as well. &#x201C;She was constantly e-mailing him, calling him and texting him,&#x201D; a law-enforcement source <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130807022316/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/stalker_prof_busted_LxjxgsLwWRJjPxBtsUkkHO">told the Post</a>. &#x201C;She wanted him...The guy got fed up and was like, &#x2018;That&#x2019;s it! This chick has to go away.&#x2019; &#x201D;</p>
