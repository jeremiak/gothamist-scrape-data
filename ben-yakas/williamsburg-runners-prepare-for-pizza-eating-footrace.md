<p>Last week, Williamsburg was treated to a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140626042959/http://gothamist.com/2014/06/13/photos_williamsburg_pizza_party.php#photo-1">free pizza &amp; beer bash</a> in honor of the 125th birthday of the cheese-tomato-crust mashup. But clearly that wasn&apos;t enough carbs for some people: next Wednesday, there will be a #NYCPizzaMile starting at McCarren Park. If you&apos;ve ever wondered what it would be like to be a mother bird&#x2014;chewing and regurgitating <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140626042959/http://gothamist.com/tags/pizza">pizza</a> for your baby bird, only in this case, the baby bird would be the pavement upon which you will most certainly be vomiting&#x2014;then this is the event FOR YOU.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140626042959/http://www.grubstreet.com/2014/06/pizza-mile-williamsburg.html">According to Grub Street</a>, the event is taking place next Wednesday, June 25th, at 8 p.m. starting in McCarren Park. It&apos;s hosted by Brooklyn Running Company and Williamsburg Pizza, two businesses which probably shouldn&apos;t be discussed in the same sentence, but hey, it&apos;s 2014 and there are apps devoted to texting you the word &quot;yo,&quot; so this is relatively reasonable.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140626042959/https://www.facebook.com/WilliamsburgPizza/photos/a.360258180673088.49991.360063540692552/550244458341125/?type=1">a Facebook post on the event</a>, participants are required to eat one slice of pizza per every mile (it&apos;s a 4 mile run altogether). The fastest runner wins a $30 gift card to Brooklyn Running Company and one free pie from Williamsburg Pizza. You&apos;ll also have the satisfaction of being able to tell all your friends about that one time you thought running and eating pizza at the same time was a fun idea.</p>

<p>This isn&apos;t the first (or only) pizza run in NYC&#x2014;there&apos;s been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140626042959/http://nycpizzarun.com/">one in lower Manhattan</a> for several years now. But this IS the only one in Williamsburg, and Williamsburg is the only place to get <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140626042959/http://gothamist.com/2014/04/24/diy_doughnut_williamsburg.php">syringe doughnuts,</a> so what are we even talking about here, of course this is the most important Pizza Run in America. This is a landmark moment for pizza.</p>

<p>Then again, our leading scientists still haven&apos;t come up with a way to make <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140626042959/http://laughingsquid.com/pizza-bed-a-conceptual-bedding-set-design-that-looks-like-a-delicious-slice-of-pepperoni-pizza/">pizza beds</a> a reality, so we probably still have a long way to go until pizza is accepted as a viable running food.</p>
