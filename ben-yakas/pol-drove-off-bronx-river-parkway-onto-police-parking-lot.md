                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:260px; "> <img alt="6511crash.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130801101736im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/6511crash.jpg" width="260" height="170"> <br> <i>The section where the car fell off the Bronx River Parkway</i></div> An up-and-coming Democratic politician from the Bronx <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130801101736/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/bronx/rising_pol_star_takes_plunge_RhHi5Fn4yVTOFx0AtKEFRJ?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">drove off of</a> the Bronx River Parkway, allegedly after a fight with a lady friend, yesterday morning. Bronx district leader Michael Robles, 28, and a 22-year-old female companion survived the 30-foot fall without a scratch. The car landed on top of a pickup truck in the parking lot of Bronx Police District 12. Or as one commenter comically put it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130801101736/http://theerant.yuku.com/topic/41811/Car-plunges-off-Bronx-River-Parkway">at Thee Rant</a>, &quot;He deliberately kamikazied the District 12 parking lot as a protest against the NYPD!!&quot;<p></p>

<p>Robles and the woman were arguing before the crash, which occurred just before 8 a.m. Saturday morning. Police <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130801101736/http://www.myfoxny.com/dpp/news/car-falls-into-bronx-building-20110604-lgf">also believe that</a> he was speeding at the time; Robles lost control of the car, struck a median, swerved across two lanes of traffic, through a chain-link fence and into the air. His Acura 2005 SUV landed on a pickup truck in the parking lot of the 12th district station on East 180th Street. </p>

<p>Robles, who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130801101736/http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/2009/05/bronx_dems_nomi.php">first interned</a> for Ruben Diaz Jr. when he was 14, told police he had &quot;lost focus,&quot; but refused to elaborate on what their argument had been about. He did thank one person for saving him: &quot;He&apos;s the only one who could save me and He did today,&quot; he told the Post.</p>
