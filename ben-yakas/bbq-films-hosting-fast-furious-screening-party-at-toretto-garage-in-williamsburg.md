<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021115053/http://gothamist.com/tags/BBQFilms">BBQ Films</a> has already staged immersive film viewing experiences with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021115053/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/09/ghostbusters_party_2016.php"><em>Ghostbusters</em></a><em>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021115053/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/20/photos_scenes_from_a_good_ghostly_b.php#photo-1">Beetlejuice</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021115053/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/10/photos_hundreds_of_blood_ravers_soa.php#photo-1">Blade</a></em> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021115053/http://gothamist.com/2014/03/24/back_to_the_future.php#photo-1"><em>Back To The Future</em></a> parties (to name just a few). But those were all warmups for the most important film/BBQ hybrid experience in cinematic history. </p>

<p>You better hide your <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021115053/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlYCSz23G1M">baby oil</a> and breakout the Corona, because a <em>Fast and the Furious</em> BBQ Film experience is coming to Brooklyn.</p>

<p>As everyone who is a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021115053/http://gothamist.com/2015/03/26/fast_furious_hot_take.php"><em>Fast &amp; Furious</em> loyalist/obsessive</a> already knows, barbecuing is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021115053/http://www.ew.com/article/2015/07/03/fast-furious-6-ultimate-barbecue">VERY important</a> tradition for Dominic Toretto and the Happy Time Vroom Vroom Gang, making this event <em>incredibly</em> appropriate. BBQ Films sent out an email to loyal fans today announcing the event later this month in Williamsburg:</p>

<blockquote>On Friday, July 29th, VILLAIN will become Toretto&apos;s Garage for one night only, and yes, ticket price includes dinner (we&apos;ll skip the tuna). The Toretto Family Cookout will feature all the transportive theatrical sets and performances that BBQ Films guests have come to expect, as well as 10-second cars and 2001&apos;s gearhead classic, The Fast and The Furious.</blockquote>

<p>For $45, you get to, &quot;share a meal with the Toretto Family, catered by a fan favorite; learn how to replace those piston rings you fried last week; grab a seat to the screening of 2001&apos;s <em>The Fast &amp; The Furious</em>; snag a limited edition garage-ready poster; and experience all the transportive theatrical sets and performances that BBQ Films guests have come to expect.&quot; For $85, you get all that plus &quot;reserved seats right in front, four furious drinks, and an exclusive gift.&quot; Perhaps it will be the gift of saying grace before the bountiful meal?</p>

Until then, as the French say, &quot;Fallait que t&apos;aille &#xE0; l&apos;&#xE9;glise sinon pas de barbecue.&quot;</p>
