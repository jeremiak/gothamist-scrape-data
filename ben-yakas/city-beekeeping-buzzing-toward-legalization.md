The Daily News <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170926205554/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2009/12/18/2009-12-18_hivefive_city_to_end_beekeeping_ban.html">reports</a>, &quot;The buzz began recently when a sustainable-food group - Just Food - and other bee enthusiasts begged health bosses to allow New Yorkers to keep the stinging insects.&quot; </p>

<p>Bees had been placed on a list of harmful &quot;wild animals,&quot; that includes lions, pit vipers, and crocodiles, under the city health code. Fines can range between $200-$2000 for maintaining a rooftop hive, which according to the News &quot;more than 500 New Yorkers&quot; already do. Health officials have now determined that stings by honeybees are rarely harmful and will hold a public hearing on the proposal early next year.</p>

<p>One colony can yield up to 150 pounds of honey, which sells for $10 a pound, according to Amy Blankstin of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170926205554/http://www.justfood.org/">Just Food.</a> Liane Newton, the incoming organizer of the New York City Beekeeping Meetup Group, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170926205554/http://www.onearth.org/article/nycbees">told OnEarth</a>, &quot;We&apos;re very pleased to be able to encourage proper beekeeping training without feeling like we are skirting the law.&quot; </p>
