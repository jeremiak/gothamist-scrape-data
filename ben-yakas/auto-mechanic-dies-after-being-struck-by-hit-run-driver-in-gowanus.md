<p>Yesterday, a 27-year-old auto mechanic <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502121817/http://gothamist.com/2014/05/10/27-yr-old_in_critical_condition_aft.php">was struck by a hit-and-run driver</a> in Gowanus. Felipe Castro, was repairing a Ford Expedition parked halfway on the sidewalk in front of Samba Transmission &amp; Auto Repair (where he worked) on Third Avenue near 7th Street around 7:30 a.m. Saturday when he was struck by a driver in a black Nissan. Castro was taken to New York Methodist Hospital in critical condition, and has since succumbed to his wounds. &quot;He was a very happy...lovable person, a caring person,&quot; Castro&#x2019;s wife, Mguelina Gonzalez Hernon, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502121817/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/man-clings-life-hit-and-run-accident-article-1.1787255">told the News.</a></p>

<p>A witness who was also driving in the neighborhood at the time said that he didn&apos;t believe the suspect saw Castro. &quot;This guy behind me [in the Nissan] kept beeping at me,&#x201D; Kero told the News. &quot;The guy shifted over to the bike lane. He had to be doing 40 to 45 MPH for sure.&quot; He said that the driver sideswiped the bumper of the car Castro was working on, and then hit Castro: &quot;He hit the guy and the guy went flying and slammed into a parked car head-first.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502121817/http://nypost.com/2014/05/10/man-fighting-for-his-life-after-hit-and-run-in-brooklyn/">Kero adds</a> that he followed the Nissan down to 14th Street before he lost him&#x2014;&quot;He kept beeping at cars in front of him ...He was swerving a lot&quot;&#x2014;but he was able to get his license plate number and give it to police. No arrests have been made yet, but cops say the investigation is ongoing.</p>

<p>&quot;He didn&#x2019;t drink, he didn&#x2019;t smoke, he just worked and went straight home,&#x201D; added Castro&apos;s wife, who noted they have a four-year-old daughter. &quot;I don&#x2019;t want what he did to just go away,&#x201D; she said of the hit-and-run driver. &quot;He just destroyed his life.&quot;</p>
