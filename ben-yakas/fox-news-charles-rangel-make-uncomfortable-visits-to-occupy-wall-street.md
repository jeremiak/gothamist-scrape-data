<p>Following <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160307091731/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/01/breaking_occupy_wall_street_protest.php">yesterday&apos;s tense rally at the Brooklyn Bridge</a> which led to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160307091731/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/02/more_than_700_reportedly_arrested_a.php#photo-1">over 700 arrests</a>, hundreds of Occupy Wall Street protesters continued to demonstrate <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160307091731/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2011/10/02/2011-10-02_occupy_wall_street_protesters_return_to_demonstration_hours_after_being_arrested.html">after being released</a> by police.  &quot;You go to Italy, you eat gelato. You go to a protest, you expect to be arrested. Nobody gets spooked by the arrests,&quot; said Baruch College student Daniel Levine. And as the coverage of the protest has increased, many celebrities and politicians have attempted show solidarity&#x2014;and some have had uncomfortable experiences.</p>

<p>According <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160307091731/http://www.observer.com/2011/10/geraldo-rivera-and-fox-news-come-down-to-occupy-wall-street/">to the Observer</a>, Geraldo Rivera came down to Zuccotti Park Sunday morning to cover the protests for Fox News. They say he was immediately mobbed by people. They say they saw him interview one protester about his cause before cutting him off mid-sentence; he was also asked by a <em>Vice</em> writer about the legality of what the NYPD did on the bridge. You can see his response below:</p>

<p>Rep. Charlie Rangel tried to lend his support to protesters before the arrests started yesterday...but was chased away. According to witnesses, Rangel was giving an informal speech to the crowd when a man started taunting him and then came toward him. &#x201C;Charlie was saying how they need to have more people down here to support this. That&#x2019;s why he was there...This heckler came out of the crowd and went after him,&quot; said Councilman Charles Barron, who was near him when the incident occurred. Rangel wasn&apos;t hurt, and other protesters came to his defense.</p>

<p>Actor Mark Ruffalo <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160307091731/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/10/02/occupy-wall-street-celebrities-_n_991066.html#s383611&amp;title=Mark_Ruffalo">tweeted about the events</a> at the Brooklyn Bridge, Roseanne Barr made a speech, while Yoko Ono expressed her <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160307091731/http://imaginepeace.com/archives/12671">&quot;love&quot; for OWS</a>. Previously, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160307091731/http://gothamist.com/tags/occupywallstreet">protesters have had support from</a> the likes of celebrities and intellectuals including Cornell West, Susan Sarandon,  Russel Simmons, Tom Morello and Michael Moore. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160307091731/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/30/occupy_wall_street_welcomes_nyc_tra.php">This past week</a>, the Transit Workers Union Local 100 said they were planning a rally on October 5 to explicitly express their support.</p>

<p>As if all that weren&apos;t enough, the Department of Homeland Security has warned financial companies to be wary of a cyber attack from the group Anonymous, saying that &#x201C;publicized events&#x201D; like Occupy Wall Street may motivate the group...even though members of the group <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160307091731/http://gothamist.com/tags/anonymous">have publicly been involved with</a> the protests from the beginning, including <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160307091731/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/26/anonymous_outs_nypd_officer_who_all.php">revealing the identity of</a> the officer who pepper-sprayed protesters. OWS spokesman Patrick Bruener <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160307091731/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/business/hackers_joining_wall_street_protests_q1ghamyb6FnIrSRFqKPvCK">told the Post that</a> Anonymous were allies, but they didn&apos;t agree with all their methods: </p>

<blockquote>Anonymous stands in solidarity with us, and they&#x2019;re nonviolent. They have legitimate grievances&#x2014;they have reasons to be upset with the way the Internet works&#x2014;but sometimes the way they put that out there isn&#x2019;t beneficial.</blockquote>

<p>Below, in case you missed out on yesterday&apos;s activities, or want to relive your favorite moments, you can watch nearly an hour and 20 minutes of the &quot;full protest.&quot;</p>
