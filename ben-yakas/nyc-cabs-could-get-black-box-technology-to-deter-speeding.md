<p>Despite the de Blasio administration&apos;s commitment to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422200934/http://gothamist.com/tags/visionzero">Vision Zero</a>, there&apos;s been a surge of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422200934/http://gothamist.com/tags/pedestrianfatalities">pedestrian fatalities</a> so far in 2014, including <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422200934/http://gothamist.com/tags/cooperstock">a 9-year-old boy who was fatally struck</a> by a cab driver on the Upper West Side in front of his father. That cabbie wasn&apos;t handed criminal charges and kept his license, which is more par for the course than anyone would like: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422200934/http://gothamist.com/2014/02/09/cabbies_keep_driving_despite_fatal.php">only two taxi drivers out of 16</a> involved in fatal or serious crashes since 2009 have had their licenses revoked. But de Blasio had a plan to hold cabbies more accountable in the future: taxi black boxes.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422200934/http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2014/03/nyc_eyes_plans_to_prod_taxis_t.html">According to AP</a>, de Blasio wants to outfit cabs with &quot;black-box-style data recorders and devices that would sound warnings&#x2014;or even pause the fare meter&#x2014;for going too fast.&quot; Paul Steely White, who runs Transportation Alternatives, told them that such a plan could influence drivers all over the city, because cabbies&apos; driving &quot;dictates behavioral norms to other drivers.&quot;</p>

<p>The Taxi and Limousine Commission says it is &quot;still exploring the ideas,&quot; but it seems many cabbies are upset that de Blasio is singling them out for scrutiny, despite the fact that only approximately 4 percent of the roughly 200,000 vehicles involved in accidents citywide last year were yellow cabs.</p>

<p>This isn&apos;t a new idea: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422200934/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/01/05/a-black-box-for-taxicabs/">back in 2009</a>, windshield-mounted cameras (under the model name MacBox III) were proposed. Those boxes were slightly different, designed to record data on vehicle use, road accidents and other information. &quot;This technology is being used effectively throughout the for-hire vehicle industry, and it is saving them considerable amounts of money on their insurance costs,&quot; then-TLC chairman Matthew W. Daus said at the time. &quot;More importantly, however, we believe this pilot program has very real potential to help us deter accidents and save lives.&quot;</p>

<p>That plan didn&apos;t come to fruition, and black boxes remain mostly in the realm of the theoretical right now: &quot;It&apos;s unclear whether anyone has developed devices linking speed and fare meters, but experts say it&apos;s feasible,&quot; AP wrote.<br>
