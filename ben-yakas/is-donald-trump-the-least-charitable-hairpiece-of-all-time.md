title: Is Donald Trump The Least Charitable Hairpiece Of All Time?

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="41311trump.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110413230817im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/41311trump.jpg" width="250" height="355" class="image-left"> </span>There&apos;s a lot of things we could debate about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110413230817/http://gothamist.com/tags/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a>: is he seriously running for president? Does he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110413230817/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/07/dont_worry_america_donald_trump_wil.php">really think Obama wasn&apos;t born in the US</a>? Is that his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110413230817/http://gothamist.com/2010/11/23/frank_gehry_doesnt_like_donald_trum.php">real hair</a>? If that is his real hair, why doesn&apos;t he do something about it? Does he not realize that people are staring at him? But there&apos;s one thing that has always seemed rather irrefutable: Trump is pretty darn rich (or else <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110413230817/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/16/business/media/16trump.html">he&apos;ll sue you</a>). Now here&apos;s another thing that seems rather irrefutable: Trump is pretty darn cheap when it comes to charitable donations.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110413230817/http://www.thesmokinggun.com/documents/celebrity/trump-least-charitable-billionaire-109247">Smoking Gun got</a> fed up with listening to all of Trump&apos;s blatherings about &quot;birther&quot; this and &quot;new season of <em>Celebrity Apprentice</em>&quot; that, so they did some research into how Trump has spent his vast wealth (he said he had &quot;seven billion fucking dollars in the bank&quot; at his celebrity roast) over the past 20 years. What they discovered was that Trump did not have much enthusiasm when it came to charity: from 1990 through 2009, he has personally donated a total of <strong>just $3.7 million</strong> to his foundation, which was incorporated in 1987. The billionaire is not even the largest contributor to his own charitable organization&#x2014;the World Wrestling Entertainment, who have given over $5 million, is.  </p>

<p>Overall, the Trump foundation has &quot;made charitable contributions totaling a paltry $6.7 million&quot; over the past two decades. Compared to the philanthropy of other high-profile tycoons like Bill Gates, Warren Buffett, Larry Ellison, Ted Turner, Michael Bloomberg, David Geffen, or S.I. Newhouse, it&apos;s a pitiful amount. Bloomberg donated $235 million to charity in 2008 alone! They note that in the aftermath of &quot;national tragedies like September 11 and Hurricane Katrina,&quot; Trump conveniently misplaced his checkbook, and the donations he has made to organizations such as New York Rescue Workers Detoxification Fund are &quot;mere crumbs falling from his overflowing plate.&quot; </p>

<p>Trump, who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110413230817/http://www.trump.com/Donald_J_Trump/Donald_J_Trump.asp">describes himself</a> as an &#x201C;ardent philanthropist&#x201D; whose charitable activities are &#x201C;an integral part of his ethos&quot; on his website, did find the money to make certain political contributions in 2010&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110413230817/http://www.unelected.org/donald-trump-donates-to-democrats-including-harry-reid-in-2010">to Democrats</a>. Last year, the mogul made a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110413230817/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/20/magazine/20Emanuel-t.html?pagewanted=2&amp;_r=1">donation</a> of $50,000 to Rahm Emmanuel, $2,400 to Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, $2,000 to Democratic Congressman Anthony Weiner, $4,800 to Democratic Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, and $10,000 to the NY Democratic Party, among others.</p>

<p>Trump is still doing well in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110413230817/http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2011/04/12/cnn-poll-trump-tied-for-first-in-gop-horserace/">silly CNN polls</a>,  tied with Mike Huckabee for first choice among Republican candidates&#x2014;of course, more than four out of ten Republicans also don&apos;t want him to run at all. But hey, on the plus side, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor thinks that this whole presidential run bullshit is just that: bullshit. &quot;<strong>No, I don&apos;t think he is really serious when we see a campaign launch on the birther issue</strong>,&quot; Cantor <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110413230817/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/04/13/eric-cantor-donald-trump-_n_848612.html">said on CNN</a> when asked about Trump, whom he said he wouldn&apos;t support come election time. Hopefully Trump will give this all up soon, and get back to doing what he loves doing most: </p>
