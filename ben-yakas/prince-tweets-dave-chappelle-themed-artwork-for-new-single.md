<p>When Prince suddenly announced that he was tweeting under his backing band <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150710220916/https://twitter.com/3rdeyegirl">PRINCE 3RDEYEGIRL&apos;s</a> Twitter account, we knew we&apos;d be in for something special. So far, we&apos;ve gotten <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150710220916/https://twitter.com/3rdeyegirl/status/367480764322955264">weird selfies</a>, and a whole lot <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150710220916/https://twitter.com/3rdeyegirl/status/368152765958078465">of self-awareness</a>. But best of all, we now know that Prince is not only <em>aware</em> of Dave Chappelle&apos;s amazing parody of him&#x2014;he&apos;s using his likeness as the cover for his new single.</p>

<p>Prince (or someone in his camp) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150710220916/https://twitter.com/3rdeyegirl/status/368508455914455041">tweeted out the above photo</a> late Friday afternoon, along with a link to the video excerpt of new tunes &quot;Breakfast Can Wait,&quot; and the caption, &quot;Game: Blouses.&quot; The tune actually sounds pretty good, a bit like a more R&amp;B; takeoff of his classic &quot;Starfish And Coffee.&quot; </p>

<p>But it&apos;s great to know Prince appreciates Chappelle&apos;s classic sketch (watch it below, again, as many times as you can) as much as the rest of the world does&#x2014;and that he has a sense of humor about himself, even if he has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150710220916/http://chicagoist.com/2013/07/01/when_prince_says_no_photos_prince_m.php">no sense of humor about concert photography and videography.</a></p>
