<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161209164748/http://gothamist.com/tags/sethmeyers">Seth Meyers</a> returned from his extended Thanksgiving break last night and jumped right back into the swing of things with a new Closer Look segment focusing on some of the highlights of Donald Trump&apos;s last week, including false claims of voter fraud, general denial of basic facts, and his insensitive handling of foreign policy. &quot;In a little over a month, Trump will be in charge of our relationships with the rest of the world, and when you&apos;re dealing with major foreign powers in conflicts in unstable regions, facts really do matter, whether you believe in them or not,&quot; Meyers said.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161209164748/http://gothamist.com/tags/trevornoah">Trevor Noah</a>, who finally went viral last week when he debated <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161209164748/http://gothamist.com/2016/12/01/tomi_lahren_daily_show.php">conservative commentator Tomi Lahren</a>, picked up on Trump&apos;s tweeting addiction, casting blame on those around him for enabling his worst behavior: &quot;They know what he&apos;s doing, they know when he&apos;s doing something wrong,&quot; he said. &quot;Here&apos;s my view: a drunk is a drunk, but the person who encourages him to drive? That&apos;s an asshole. And Trump has a lot of assholes around him.&quot;</p>

And <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161209164748/http://gothamist.com/tags/stephencolbert">Stephen Colbert</a> also looked at Trump&apos;s foreign policy blunders from the weekend, including Trump&apos;s phone call with the prime minster of Taiwan. &quot;Since they both speak Chinese, maybe Trump didn&apos;t know which nation was which,&quot; Colbert said. &quot;So here&apos;s an easy way for Donald Trump to remember which China we talk to: sir, it&apos;s the one where they make your ties.&quot;  </p>
