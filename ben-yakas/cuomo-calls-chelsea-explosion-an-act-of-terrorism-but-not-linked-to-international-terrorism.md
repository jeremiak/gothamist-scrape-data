<p>Gov. Andrew Cuomo <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170405173650/http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/18/us/new-york-explosion/">gave an update</a> on the explosion that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170405173650/http://gothamist.com/2016/09/17/chelsea_explosion.php">injured dozens of people</a> on a Manhattan block last night. Although Mayor de Blasio previously said the &quot;intentional&quot; Chelsea explosion was not related to terrorism, Cuomo took things one step further: &quot;A bomb exploding in New York is obviously an act of terrorism.&quot; He hastened to add, &quot;At this time there&apos;s no evidence of an international terrorism connection with this incident, but it is very, very early in the investigation.&quot;</p>

<p>Cuomo reiterated de Blasio&apos;s statement that there was no threat to NYC, but to &quot;err on the side of caution,&quot; Cuomo said nearly 1,000 extra NY State Police and National Guard will be deployed in the city. </p>

<p>Expanding on his terrorism claims, Cuomo said during the solo press conference, &quot;We&apos;re not going to let them win. We&apos;re not gonna let them win. What do they want? They want to instill terror. That&apos;s what they want. They want to make you afraid. They want to make you worry about going into New York City or New York State. They want to make you worry about going across a bridge or a subway. We&apos;re not going to let them instill fear, because then they would win.&quot;</p>

<p>He added that subways should be up and running as normal by Monday morning&apos;s commute: &quot;I want New Yorkers to be confident when they go back to work on Monday that New York is up and running and we&apos;re doing everything that we need to do.&quot;</p>

<p>As many in the media pointed out this morning, the disconnect between Cuomo and de Blasio&#x2014;a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170405173650/http://gothamist.com/2015/06/30/mayor_de_blasio_is_sick_tired_of_go.php">rivalry</a> fueled <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170405173650/http://gothamist.com/2016/08/23/cuomo_hates_vacation.php">by ego</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170405173650/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/15/yr_mom_better_pack_a_snickers_tmw_deblahzero.php">playground</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170405173650/http://gothamist.com/2015/11/11/such_huge_friends.php">taunts</a>&#x2014;created unnecessary confusion and led to the somewhat contradictory language. And it all could have been avoided, if the two men had done the press conference together rather than stagger their pressers an hour apart. Or if they, ya know, had just talked to each other before speaking.</p>

<p>At least Cuomo and de Blasio were able to put their differences aside long enough to tour the area this morning while standing within proximity to each other.</p>
