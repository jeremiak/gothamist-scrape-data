<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right" style=" width:240px; "> <img alt="4111silver.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629175412im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/4111silver.jpg" width="240" height="360"> <br> <i>AP</i></div> April Fools Day can be a stressful day for many, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629175412/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/01/today_the_guggenheim_got_painted_re.php?gallery0Pic=6#gallery">between the</a> Improv Everywhere faux-attack videos and the actually-not-so-ridiculous dog highchairs. It must be especially tough for politicians, who are used to receiving lots of strange mail on a good day. Assembly Democratic Speaker Sheldon Silver was one of a handful of politicians <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629175412/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/01/state-police-investigating-e-mail-to-lawmaker/">to receive</a> one such rambling, threatening email today, and as with everything today, police weren&apos;t sure how seriously to take it.<p></p>

<p>The email, which had the subject line &quot;Time to Kill,&quot; was sent to Silver, Brooklyn Assemblyman William Colton, Senate GOP Majority Leader Dean Skelos, and several other NY Assembly members by a man who identified himself as a state worker. He complained about the state budget and labor union battles among other things <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629175412/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/2011/04/01/2011-04-01_sheldon_silver_dean_skelos_received_threatening_emails_from_man_claiming_to_be_s.html">in the email</a>:</p>

<blockquote>At this point, I don&apos;t care what happens with the New York State budget. My group is going to do everything possible to provoke terrorist attacks on New York by al-Qaida, and by Tea Party nut cases.

<p>...</p>

<p>At first I thought I might pull out a gun at my State office and kill a bunch of these dummies that I work with. But I doubt that would provide me with the satisfaction I am looking for,&quot; it continues. &quot;Understand with whom you are dealing. I am not crazy. I am a terrorist. I stand for all of the people who don&apos;t have a voice. Truly, I hope the Governor harms and enrages a great many people. They will supply soldiers for my war.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>Police officials said they were &quot;treating it seriously&quot;, but added that there was no indication of any real, credible threat. It seems like it&apos;s been that kind of day for everyone, filled with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629175412/http://abcnews.go.com/US/best-april-fools-day-hoaxes-2011/story?id=13274831">empty reports</a> about Ann Coulter getting her own PBS program and whatever Google Motion is supposed to be. And now we can&apos;t tell real kidnappings from fake kidnappings, and we&apos;re hungry, and we&apos;re grumbly! We need a serious break from the agita of this &quot;humorous&quot; day...we need something to calm us down...</p>
