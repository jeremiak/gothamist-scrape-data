<p>A 58-year-old man was fatally struck by a train on the Upper West Side this morning. Victim John Williams was struck by a southbound D train at the subway station at West 72nd Street and Central Park West around 6:45 a.m. Williams was taken to St. Luke&apos;s Hospital where he was pronounced DOA. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131006174851/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2013/04/06/man-hit-killed-by-subway-train-at-72nd-street/">Police told CBS that</a> the man had climbed down onto the tracks to retrieve something when he was struck by the train.</p>

<p>MTA officials tell us the D was running local early this morning. Police add that Williams lives at West 175th Street; it&apos;s unclear how he ended up on the tracks, and cops are still investigating the incident.</p>

<p>This is the fourth subway-related incident in the last three days. A man was fatally struck by a northbound E train at 7th Avenue and 53rd Street in Manhattan around 7:45 p.m. Thursday night. FDNY adds that he apparently jumped in front of the train, and died at the scene. A 56-year-old person was struck by a train around 1:30 a.m. Friday at Fulton Street and Ralph Avenue; that person was taken to Kings County Hospital, but his or her condition is not known.</p>

<p>And on Thursday morning, a 23-year-old Florida man <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131006174851/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/05/cops_believe_florida_tourist_was_fa.php">was fatally struck by a train</a>. Cops believe that Bobby Legrand Guin, who had recently moved to NYC, had dropped a wad of $50 and $20 bills onto the tracks and had jumped down to retrieve them when he was struck by a northbound local A train.
