The incident happened around 2:30 p.m. on Monday, when the 28-year-old victim was accosted by the suspect while cycling on the bridge toward Manhattan. The suspect threatened the cyclist, forced him off the bike, jumped on, and fled toward Delancey Street.<p></p>

<p>But two other cyclists chased the suspect and were able to wrestle the bike back&#x2014;they were also able to take a photo of the suspect as he fled on foot (you can see the picture to the left). The victim sustained minor injuries due to the altercation. All this reminds us of They Might Be Giants&apos; John Linnell, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406153735/http://gothamist.com/2008/01/22/john_linnell_th.php">who once told us</a> about his bike being stolen from him on the very same bridge by a man brandishing &quot;what looked like a scimitar.&quot;</p>

<p>Bicycle thefts <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406153735/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/30/bike_thieves_love_williamsburg_four.php">have quadrupled</a> in Williamsburg&apos;s 94th Precinct since last year&#x2014;96 bikes were reported stolen in the first six months of 2012, up from 24 last year. Police describe the suspect as 40-50 years old, 5&apos;9&quot;, 180 lbs, with a dark complexion and black hair. Anyone with information is asked to call Crime Stoppers at 1-800-577-TIPS (8477). </p>
