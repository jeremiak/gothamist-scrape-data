<p>We feel comfortable keeping track of where <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508162956/http://gothamist.com/tags/rats">rats</a> are in our city <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508162956/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/24/this_nyc_rat_map_will_show_you_wher.php">from behind a computer screen</a>, but we know there are those New Yorkers who have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508162956/http://ratfanclub.org/report1.html">pet rats</a>, some of whom carry them <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508162956/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/20/video_woman_takes_her_baby_rats_for.php">under their hats</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508162956/http://gothamist.com/tags/sadratman">in their mouths</a> for safekeeping. It&apos;s one thing to have one as a <em>pet</em>&#x2014;it&apos;s another thing to affectionately &quot;save&quot; a filthy, disease-carrying subway rat. </p>

<p>De Blasio could certainly learn something from this woman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508162956/http://gothamist.com/2014/02/02/staten_island_chuck_doesnt_bite_de.php">about handling animals.</a></p>
