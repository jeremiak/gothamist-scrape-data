<p>Taking a peek at what fellow straphangers are reading on the subway isn&apos;t the only way to get an idea of what literature New Yorkers are devouring. To really check the pulse of the city, we turn to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170101152233/http://gothamist.com/tags/nypl">New York Public Library</a>, which released its annual list of most checked out books for the year this week. And at the top of this year&apos;s list was <em>The Girl On The Train</em> by Paula Hawkins, and <em>Between the World and Me</em> by Ta-Nehisi Coates, as well as both novels by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170101152233/http://gothamist.com/tags/harperlee">Harper Lee,</a> and Mindy Kaling&apos;s memoir.</p>

<p>A few takeaways from the info: James Patterson and Danielle Steele are still insanely popular, especially in Staten Island (they nabbed the top four spots there), but oddly, Patterson&apos;s most recent novel <em>NYPD Red 4</em> wasn&apos;t one of the top 10 books systemwide despite appearing on the individual Manhattan, Bronx and SI lists (I don&apos;t know what the significance of that is, but it is deeply significant). Despite being over a year and a half old, Harper Lee&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170101152233/http://gothamist.com/2015/02/05/harper_lee_controversy.php">mostly-authorized</a> long-awaited second novel <em>Go Set A Watchman</em> remains a big hit&#x2014;it&apos;s also one of only two books in the top ten systemwide to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170101152233/https://www.nypl.org/press/press-release/december-28-2015/new-york-public-library-announces-top-book-check-outs-2015">also appear on last year&apos;s list</a> (the other, of course, was <em>The Girl On The Train</em>). Last year&apos;s number one book in the Bronx, a TASC test prep volume, fell to number two behind Patterson, but was still the most popular book in at least six different NYPL locations.</p>

<p>If you <em>really</em> love lists and data and knowing what every neighborhood is reading, then you can dive into the three lists of top books checked out at every individual branch in the Bronx, Manhattan and SI. Some special shoutouts to outliers, like: all the Deadpool super fans at the Bronx Library Center; all the Beyonce fans in Mott Haven; the John Irving fans in Spuyten Duyvil; the residents near 53rd Street just trying to minimize their lives; the drama fans at Library for the Performing Arts who ride or die for Tennessee Williams; and the residents of South Beach trying to break some world records.</p>
