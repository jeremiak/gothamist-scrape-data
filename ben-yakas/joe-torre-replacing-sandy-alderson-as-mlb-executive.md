It certainly isn&apos;t good timing: while Torre took the reins of the Yankees at the start of their resuscitation as the best team in baseball, Alderson took over in the midst of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110707173308/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/04/trustee_suing_mets_owners_for_300m.php">Madoff mess</a>, and is suffering through it now. But according <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110707173308/http://hardballtalk.nbcsports.com/2011/02/25/joe-torre-to-replace-sandy-alderson-as-mlbs-executive-vice-president-for-baseball-operations/">to reports</a>, Torre will be named the new as MLB&apos;s executive vice president for baseball operations, the job Alderson held before getting cajoled into the accepting the Mets job. </p>

Torre, who is still <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110707173308/http://gothamist.com/tags/joetorre">beloved</a> by NY fans, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110707173308/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/17/don_mattingly_to_replace_joe_torre.php">retired</a> as manager of the LA Dodgers at the end of last season. He was replaced in the Dodgers by former Yankee Don Mattingly; meanwhile, we continue our never-ending, silent campaign to hand over the reins of the entire MLB to former Mets manager and Connecticut public servant <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110707173308/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/15/ex-mets_manager_continues_being_the.php">Bobby Valentine</a>. </p>
