The plane circled around JFK dumping fuel; although the plane could fly with just one engine working, it was told to come back to the airport. Nobody was hurt, and now reports say that the blown engine may have been caused by a &quot;bird strike,&quot; similar to what happened to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509165131/http://gothamist.com/2009/01/15/plane_crash_in_hudson.php">U.S. Airways Flight 1549</a>.</p>
