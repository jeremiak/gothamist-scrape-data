<p>As if we needed any more reminders that the Apocalypse is only <em>nine days away</em> since we saw that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150921011848/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/04/only_17_days_until_the_apocalypse_y.php">terrifying billboard</a> hovering over the BQE last week, the End Times have been spotted cruising around Manhattan today. Reddit users have spotted the giant trucks (including the above left, which is from 48th and 6th), promoting the &quot;awesome news&quot; that the end of the world will be here in just a week from Saturday...on the same day that Chelsea Handler <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150921011848/http://www.beacontheatre.com/events/lies-that-chelsea-told-me0511.html">comes into town</a>. Could it really just be a coincidence?</p>

<p>The Judgment Day campaign is the handiwork of Christian radio station WFME 94.7; the call letters stand for &quot;Where Faith Means Everything,&quot; but it is better known as FamilyRadio. The date is based on the radio ramblings/preachings of Harold Camping, who says there is a five-month judgment period after May 21, just like when you apply to buy a handgun (the world won&apos;t be completely obliterated until Oct. 21). Camping talked <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150921011848/http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2011/05/a_conversation_with_harold_cam.html">to Daily Intel</a> about his prophecy, which he is entirely sure is going to come to be. He gave a preview of what May 21 will be like: </p>

<blockquote>In other words, when we get to May 21 on the calendar in any city or country in the world, and the clock says about &#x2014; this is based on other verses in the Bible &#x2014; when the clock says about 6 p.m., there&#x2019;s going to be this tremendous earthquake that&#x2019;s going to make the last earthquake in Japan seem like nothing in comparison. And the whole world will be alerted that Judgment Day has begun. And then it will follow the sun around for 24 hours. As each area of the world gets to that point of 6 p.m. on May 21, then it will happen there, and until it happens, the rest of the world will be standing far off and witnessing the horrible thing that is happening.</blockquote>

<p>On the plus side, besides the &quot;awful suffering&quot; most of us will endure, Camping does say that Jewish people <em>can</em> go to heaven (if they &quot;accept the whole Bible&quot;), and that there&apos;s no point for anybody to give to charity anymore...because the end of the world &quot;is absolutely going to happen without any question.&quot; We&apos;ve decided that we&apos;re going to stop grooming ourselves entirely as well, just in case he&apos;s right.</p>
