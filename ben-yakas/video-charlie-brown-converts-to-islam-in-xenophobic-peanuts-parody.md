It turns Charlie Brown&apos;s Christmas Special into some sort of very uncomfortable jihadist joke. As Mande put it, &quot;I still can&#x2019;t get over how profoundly fucked up and confusing it is. That said, pleeeeeease watch.&quot;</p>

<p>Leary, who starred in the FX show <em>Rescue Me</em> for seven seasons, is known for his provocative comedy style, which has brought him controversy with statements about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150416030317/http://gawker.com/5092737/denis-leary-slams-ridiculous-autism-fakers">autism</a>. While Leary is probably trying to shock his fans out of their pre-holiday stupor&#x2014;fueled by a never ending stream of wallpaper Christmas tunes&#x2014;we had a very tough time sitting through this particularly xenophobic one-note joke. </p>

<p>Of course, Leary is nothing if not an equal-opportunity offender, so <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150416030317/http://www.whosay.com/DenisLeary/videos/108116">he also posted a video</a> of Santa Claus partaking in some of his favorite illicit activities, among other things. Watch below&#x2014;because who doesn&apos;t want to listen to Leary sing a jaunty anti-Christmas song!</p>
