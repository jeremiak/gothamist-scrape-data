<p>Ever since he escaped four hung juries, &quot;Deadlock Don&quot; John Gotti Jr. has been focused on trying to bring his life story <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170429030229/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/22/deadlock_don_making_a_movie_about_h.php">to the big screen</a>. He&apos;s already <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170429030229/http://gothamist.com/2010/12/16/director_of_the_notebook_in_talks_f.php">snagged</a> director Nick Cassavetes, of <em>The Notebook</em> and <em>My Sister&apos;s Keeper</em>, for the project. And yesterday, Gotti Jr., Cassavetes and producer Marc Fiore met with actor John Travolta, who is in &quot;serious negotiations&quot; to play &quot;Teflon Don&quot; John Gotti Sr. in the film. </p>

<p>The Post got a chance <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170429030229/http://www.nypost.com/p/entertainment/movies/gotti_travolta_meet_over_dinner_HxWlBLeqUqfbMura3E3zHL">to spew</a> some of their favorite mafia cliches (&quot;he made him an offer he can&#x2019;t refuse&quot;) and some photos of the two men dining together. After the meal, Gotti called Travolta a &quot;tremendous actor&#x201D;-saying he was &quot;totally confident&quot; Travolta would nail the part playing his dad. But if the star of <em>Grease </em>seems like a funny choice to play the fearsome mobster, then you&apos;d be even more surprised who is in talks to play the younger Gotti: according <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170429030229/http://www.tmz.com/2011/01/26/john-travolta-john-gotti-jr-junior-movie-teflon-don-nick-cassavetes-marc-fiore-biopic/">to TMZ</a>, producers are trying to get <em>General Hospital</em> star and Oscars host <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170429030229/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/22/deadlock_don_making_a_movie_about_h.php">James Franco</a>!</p>
