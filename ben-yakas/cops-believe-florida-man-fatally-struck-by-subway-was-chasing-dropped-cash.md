<p>Yesterday morning, a 23-year-old Florida man <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150411081710/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/04/florida_man_fatally_struck_by_a_tra.php">was fatally struck by a train</a> on the Upper West Side. Bobby Legrand Guin was struck by a northbound local A train at the Cathedral Parkway-110th Street station around 5:15 a.m. Thursday morning. Police now say they believe he had dropped a wad of $50 and $20 bills onto the tracks and had jumped down to retrieve them when he was struck. &#x201C;There was money on the tracks and in his hand,&#x201D; a police source <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150411081710/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/man-killed-train-tracks-money-cops-article-1.1307879">told the News.</a></p>

<p>Guin, who studied business at Florida State University and Northwest Florida State College, had recently moved to NYC for work, according to friend Joey Morphy. &#x201C;He applied at countless business jobs. He moved to New York to have better chances. We were all rooting for him in our small town.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Guin was the first of three people who were struck by trains between Thursday and Friday mornings: another man was fatally struck by a northbound E train at 7th Avenue and 53rd Street in Manhattan around 7:45 p.m. last night. FDNY adds that he apparently jumped in front of the train, and died at the scene. Then a 56-year-old person was struck by a train around 1:30 a.m. Friday at Fulton Street and Ralph Avenue; that person was taken to Kings County Hospital, but his or her condition is not known. </p>
