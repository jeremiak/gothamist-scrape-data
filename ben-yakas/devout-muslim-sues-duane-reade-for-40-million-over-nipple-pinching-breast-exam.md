<p>A fashion magazine editor and devout Muslim <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130727005706/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/tourist-sues-duane-reade-fondled-exam-article-1.1377529?localLinksEnabled=false">is suing Duane Reade for $40 million</a>, claiming that a former Manhattan pharmacist sexually assaulted her during a bogus breast examination. Hayat Ammouri, 42, claims in her suit that pharmacist Monesh Hanoman tricked her into the breast exam during a free blood-pressure test at a Lexington Avenue Duane Read&#x2014; and then proceeded to grope her and pinch her nipples.</p>

<p>The lawsuit states: &quot;She agreed, reasonably thinking that this is a type of examination that could be offered by...a health-care professional wearing a white Duane Reade-issue robe...the distinctive dress of physicians.&quot; It&apos;s rare to come across someone with such respect for the distinctive white Duane Reade-issue robe, but Ammouri was visiting from Lebanon on April 22nd when the incident occurred. <strong>&quot;Hanoman then sadistically and perversely rubbed Ms. Ammouri&apos;s breasts and shockingly pinched her nipples for approximately four minutes,</strong>&quot; court papers allege.</p>

<p>Ammouri <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130727005706/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/rxxx_at_duane_reade_D3xpIb07dvy6pu3dz11ipI?utm_source=SFnewyorkpost&amp;utm_medium=SFnewyorkpost">told her cousin the next day</a> about the odd &#x201C;exam.&#x201D; The cousin immediately called police; they were told by Duane Reade that Hanoman had been fired. &#x201C;Upon learning of this incident, we conducted a prompt investigation and the individual involved is no longer employed by Duane Reade,&#x201D; said spokesman Calvin Peters. &#x201C;We truly regret that this occurred.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Despite this, Hanoman&apos;s father told the News that he thought his 26-year-old son was still working there. &#x201C;My son would never do something like this,&#x201D; Lachman Hanoman told them. And thus, the ongoing debate of doctor vs pharmacist may have been settled:</p>
