<p>Though they were unsuccessful in their pursuit of slugger Albert Pujols, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111209135343/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/08/show_me_the_a-rod_money_pujols_take.php">who signed with the Los Angeles Angels Of Anaheim today</a>, the Miami Marlins have plenty to be happy about this offseason; yesterday they introduced the keystone of the new team, their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111209135343/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/05/mets_break_fans_hearts_again_reyes.php">$106 million star</a> Jose Reyes. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111209135343/http://espn.go.com/mlb/story/_/id/7327149/jose-reyes-says-miami-marlins-showed-was-wanted">Reyes told reporters that</a> the Marlins really made him feel wanted&#x2014;they even arranged a midnight meeting the night he became a free agent. Reyes sounded particularly disappointed that the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111209135343/http://gothamist.com/tags/mets">Mets</a> made almost no effort to keep him in town, which general manager Sandy Alderson later addressed: &#x201C;If you&#x2019;re asking whether I should have sent him a box of chocolates, perhaps I should have done that. But on the other hand, the box of chocolates would have cost $106 million.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Reyes will become one of the cornerstones for the new-look Marlins, who have added a big name manager (Ozzie Gullien), <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111209135343/http://www.miamiherald.com/2011/12/07/2536153/miami-marlins-sign-buehrle-wait.html">pitcher Mark Buehrle</a>, All Star closer Heath Bell, and um, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111209135343/http://mlb.sbnation.com/2011/10/7/2474722/miami-marlins-ballpark-home-run-structure-what-is-that-gaaaaaaaaah">this really really amazing home run display.</a> While <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111209135343/http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2011-12-07/news/sfl-jose-reyes-miami-marlins-transcript-20111207_1_logan-morrison-gaby-sanchez-free-agency">the team feels</a> they&apos;ve &quot;transformed [their] offense into one of the better offenses in the National League East,&quot; trouble may be brewing: star Hanely Ramirez <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111209135343/http://blogs.sun-sentinel.com/sports_baseball_marlins/2011/12/hanley-ramirez-stories-continue-spinning-out-of-control.html">has reportedly been balking</a> at the team trying to move him from shortstop to third base to accomodate Reyes. </p>

<p>The fact remains that the Mets have been bleeding former and current All Stars for the past year&#x2014;and even team insiders are convinced the team will suck <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111209135343/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/06/mets_officials_reportedly_expect_te.php">till at least 2014.</a> The team <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111209135343/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204770404577082912358344188.html">did make some minor deals</a> in the past few days, trading underperforming outfielder Angel Pagan to the San Francisco Giants for outfielder Andres Torres and reliever Ramon Ramirez; they also signed free-agent relievers Frank Francisco and Jon Rauch. It may be time for Mets fans to resign themselves to rooting for the Red Sox this season&#x2014;after all, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111209135343/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/30/red_sox_hire_charismatic_former_met.php">new manager Bobby Valentine</a> is sure to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111209135343/http://espn.go.com/boston/mlb/story/_/id/7327830/new-boston-red-sox-skipper-bobby-valentine-hates-new-york-yankees">provide a lot of fun.</a></p>
