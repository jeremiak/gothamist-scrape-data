After a failed attempt at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505163329/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/25/obama_prospect_park_close.php">shutting down Prospect Park</a>, President Obama snaked his way through Brooklyn yesterday to tour a Crown Heights high school and throw out affection on many local fixtures. And it all culminated in Obama declaring Brooklyn &quot;cool&quot; and paling around with Bill de Blasio at Junior&apos;s. </p>

<p>&#x201C;When I was living here, Brooklyn was cool, but not this cool,&#x201D; Obama <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505163329/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/education/obama-heads-brooklyn-tour-p-tech-school-article-1.1496651">told students at P-Tech</a>, the Pathways in Technology Early College High School. Obama lived in a brownstone on Second Street in Park Slope after he graduated from Columbia University in 1984. &#x201C;Barclays Center hadn&#x2019;t been built yet,&#x201D; he noted.</p>

<p>After <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505163329/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20131025/crown-heights/president-obama-p-tech-studentsstarted-something-american-education">touring the school</a>, Obama was feeling generous with his praise, hailing Mayor Bloomberg as &#x201C;an extraordinary mayor for this city&#x201D; and &#x201C;a leader throughout the country for the past 12 years.&#x201D; Then Obama and de Blasio went to Junior&apos;s together, where Obama gushed over him telling patrons, &#x201C;Do you know your next mayor here?&#x201D;</p>

<p>Before leaving, Obama got two cheesecakes to go &#x2014; one plain and one strawberry.<br>
&#x201C;We&#x2019;ll be eating it on Air Force One,&#x201D; he told employees.</p>
