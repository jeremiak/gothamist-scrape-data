One such possum snuck his way into the Bryant Park subway station this morning, and people freaked out: &quot;People were screaming, &apos;ah! it&apos;s a possum,&apos;&quot; a police officer at the scene <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131006151600/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/bryant_park_possum_spotted_walking_2PSYklGfil5yIZDEckGfyO?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=">told the Post</a>. &quot;People got scared. It was pretty big.&quot;</p>

<p>Cops first spotted the little guy near Sixth Avenue and 42nd Street walking down the subway stairs around 8:30 a.m. Once straphangers started climbing on seats and running for the stairs, the possum was understandably frozen in its tracks. Officers from the NYPD&#x2019;s Emergency Services Unit were able to corner and lasso the possum into a cardboard box. </p>

<p>&#x201C;They couldn&#x2019;t exactly stop and frisk the possum,&#x201D; a police source yukked to the Post. &#x201C;We don&#x2019;t get these calls everyday.&#x201D; The possum was eventually released into Central Park, unless it was released somewhere on Wall Street, which might explain the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131006151600/http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/nasdaq-halts-trading-over-technical-glitch/2013/08/22/7c886348-0b4b-11e3-b87c-476db8ac34cd_story.html">Nasdaq trading halt today.</a> Hey, if a squirrel <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131006151600/http://qz.com/117970/were-not-saying-its-squirrels-just-that-squirrels-have-taken-down-the-nasdaq-before/">could do it</a>, then a possum could definitely do it too.</p>
