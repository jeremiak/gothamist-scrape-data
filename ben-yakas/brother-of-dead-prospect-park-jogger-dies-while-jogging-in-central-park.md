<p>Vegan author Rynn Berry <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140624131733/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/10/previously_unidentified_prospect_pa.php">died after suffering a heart attack</a> while jogging in Prospect Park on New Year&apos;s Eve&#x2014;and now his half-brother <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140624131733/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brothers-die-jogging-10-days-article-1.1588106">has also suffered a fatal heart attack</a> while jogging. Peter Berry, 60, died while jogging through Central Park on January 19th&#x2014;just 10 days after his half-brother died. &quot;It&#x2019;s been a shock for the family,&quot; Charles Berry, the last surviving brother, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140624131733/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brothers-die-jogging-10-days-article-1.1588106">told the News</a>. &quot;It&apos;s been terrible. It&apos;s still hard to believe.&quot;</p>

<p>Peter, who worked in tax and corporate trust law, was an avid bicyclist and squash player. &quot;Peter was in very good shape,&quot; said Charles. &quot;He was incredible with his yoga &#x2014; very limber.&quot;</p>

<p>Rynn, an avid jogger and self-published author of <em>The Vegan Guide to New York City</em>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140624131733/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/07/can_you_help_id_this_jogger_who_col.php">languished for days</a> in a Park Slope hospital before his brother Charles identified him. Rynn was taken off life-support 10 days before his brother Peter succumbed to the same fate. &quot;It&apos;s sort of a tragic coincidence,&quot; said Martin Rowe, a friend of Rynn. &quot;Two men who in some form or another took care of themselves... Yet this happened.&quot;</p>
