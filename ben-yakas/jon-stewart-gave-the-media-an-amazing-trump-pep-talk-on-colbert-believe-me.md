<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170624004610/http://gothamist.com/tags/jonstewart">Jon Stewart</a> made one of his mandated bimonthly visits to <em>Late Show with Stephen Colbert</em> last night to take a break from ranting at animals and deliver an important pep talk to the media about their breakup with Donald Trump (and also giggle a lot with Colbert). And much <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170624004610/http://gothamist.com/2017/02/01/jon_stewart_colbert_trump.php">like his last appearance</a>, in which he wore a dead animal on his head and read fake presidential orders, this felt like an instant classic segment which made us long for Stewart to be back on air on a weekly or daily basis. </p>

<p>&quot;Hey media, I heard Donald Trump broke up with you,&quot; Stewart said after going through some lowlights of Trump&apos;s recent media bashing. &quot;Stings a little, doesn&#x2019;t it? Finally thought you&#x2019;d met your match: a blabbermouth who&#x2019;s as thin-skinned and narcissistic as you are. Well, now it&#x2019;s over. Well, good riddance, I say! Kick. Him. To. The. Curb.&#x201D;</p>

<p>&quot;Media, it is time for you to get your groove back. Because let&apos;s face facts, you kinda let yourself go a little bit for these past few years. Put on a few pundits. Obsessing 24 hours a day 7 days a week about this one guy...And the whole time you&#x2019;re all chasing after Donny, the rest of us are thinking, &apos;Can&#x2019;t you see he&#x2019;s an asshole?&apos;&quot;</p>

<p>&#x201C;No, you try to defend him. &#x2018;Oh, no, no, that&#x2019;s just primaries Donald. That&#x2019;s just election Donald. You&#x2019;ll see. We can change him. He&#x2019;ll get presidential!&apos;&quot; Stewart continued. &quot;Yeah, how&#x2019;d that work out? It didn&#x2019;t. You know why? Because 70-year-old men don&#x2019;t get less cranky or racist as time goes by.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Look, media, I&#x2019;m not saying the breakup is going to be easy. You&#x2019;re going to see your ex swiping far-right with every Tom, Drudge, and Breitbart. And, from what I heard, they do anal,&quot; Stewart said before asking Colbert whether he got &quot;them&quot; cancelled for using the word &apos;anal&apos; on air. &quot;But here&#x2019;s my point, media. This breakup has given you an amazing opportunity for self-reflection and improvement. Instead of worrying about whether Trump is un-American or if he thinks you&#x2019;re the enemy or if he&#x2019;s being mean to you or if he&#x2019;s going to let you back in the briefings, do something for yourself. Self-improvement, take up a hobby. I recommend journalism. You know, I think this breakup is going to be the best thing that ever happened to you.&quot;</p>
