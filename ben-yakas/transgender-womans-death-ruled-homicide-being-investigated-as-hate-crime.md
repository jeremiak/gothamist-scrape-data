<p>The death of a transgender woman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429162033/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/23/transgender_woman_dies_after_saturd.php">who was brutally beaten in Harlem</a> last week has been ruled a homicide. Islan Nettles, 21, was with another transgender woman when she was beaten by a group of men during an argument around 11 p.m. on Saturday; she succumbed to her injuries on Thursday. The medical examiner says Nettles <a href="&gt;http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/24/nyregion/beating-death-of-transgender-woman-is-investigated-as-hate-crime.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">died from blunt impact injuries</a> to her head; cops are now investigating whether the suspect used antigay epithets during the attack. </p>

<p>Police <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429162033/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/transgender_victim_dies_8zlTCPuhtOYWYkW29VBAtL">say that</a> they believe the incident was sparked after 20-year-old suspect Paris Wilson made a pass at Nettles and was shocked to learn she was not born a woman. The man got into a fight with Nettles and her friend after that, which led to the beating near West 148th Street near 8th Avenue&#x2014;directly across the street from the housing bureau&apos;s Police Service Area 6 precinct.</p>

<p>Nettles&apos; mother, Delores, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429162033/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20130823/hamilton-heights/mother-of-fatally-beaten-transgender-woman-calls-for-justice">told DNAInfo that</a> friends told her that Islan was with two other transgender women when a group of eight men began following them up the boulevard and hurling homophobic insults and slurs. &quot;They were taunting them. They were saying f--, hatred slurs, like gay, she-male,&quot; she said. Wilson was initially charged with Assault in the Third Degree and Harassment in the Second Degree, but those charges will likely be upgraded now. </p>

<p>Nettles was an intern assistant designer at Ay&#x2019;Medici, a Harlem fashion company. &quot;He knocked my baby out on the floor,&quot; Dolores Nettles said. &quot;He was out cold and he kept beating and beating and beating. Half of my baby&apos;s brain is missing out of his head. His eyes is closed shut...He deserves life in prison because he took a life,&quot; </p>
