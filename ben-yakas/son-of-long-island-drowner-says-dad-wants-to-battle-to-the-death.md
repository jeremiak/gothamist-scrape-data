After reportedly sending wife Evana Roth <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604004434/http://gothamist.com/2012/08/04/drowned_li_man_threatens_wife_tells.php">threatening messages</a> for exposing him, Roth <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604004434/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/dead_reckoning_beW7FQwn7pF7kOb5JHehPI?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Local">has turned his ire toward his son</a>, Jonathan, who claims he&apos;s in hiding because his dad has been leaving him threatening, profanity-filled voice mails. And <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604004434/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/05/nyregion/whereabouts-of-raymond-roth-suspected-of-faking-his-death-still-unclear.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">according to the Times</a>, Roth is back in NY. <p></p>

<p>Before the &quot;drowning,&quot; Roth sent a number of emails to his son detailing the plan; Evana believes Roth is angry with 22-year-old Jonathan because he left those emails open, which is how Evana ended up seeing them and ruining his plot. Jonathan says his girlfriend answered one call from Roth, in which he angrily told her, &#x201C;If you don&#x2019;t put him on the phone, you&#x2019;re going to be sorry. I&#x2019;m on my way back. You&#x2019;re going to be sorry.&#x201D; Then came the alleged threatening voice mail:</p>

<blockquote>Still not a man, huh, Jonathan? Can&#x2019;t even answer your own phone...Listen, tough guy. You say you&#x2019;ve been to the Marines and you can kill and everything else. When I get back, you are gonna do just that. One of us is going to die.</blockquote>

<p>Jonathan, who described his father as an abusive alcoholic, still doesn&apos;t understand why his father is so angry with him, and swears he didn&apos;t leak the emails to his stepmom. But Evana says Jonathan is a habitual liar, like his father: &#x201C;One thousand percent, Jonathan is lying,&#x201D; she told the Post. &#x201C;He&#x2019;s scared, he&#x2019;s in major trouble. He didn&#x2019;t foil the plan. He was involved in it. He&#x2019;s trying to stay out of jail.&#x201D;</p>
