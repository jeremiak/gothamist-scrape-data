But there&apos;s one place which bucked all the trends, one place which just can&apos;t seem to do things the way the rest of the city does them: Staten Island.<p></p>

<p>There were 18 murders in Staten Island overall <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412184407/http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2011/03/staten_island_ran_counter_to_p.html">last year</a>, accounting for only 3 percent of the city&apos;s 536 homicides. Of those 18 deaths, eight were stabbing or slashing deaths, three deaths were from blunt force trauma, and six were shootings. In all, nine of those cases were the result of domestic violence, and didn&apos;t involve a gun at all&#x2014;five of those victims were children allegedly slain by their parents or caretakers, and another three parents allegedly killed by their adult offspring. </p>

<p>That includes the tragic case of Leisa Jones, who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412184407/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/23/si_fatal_fire_a_possible_murder-sui.php">police believe</a> cut her oldest three children&apos;s throats before setting her apartment on fire; and Eric Bellucci, who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412184407/http://gothamist.com/2010/10/22/si_double_murder_suspect_gives_para.php">is accused of</a> killing his parents with a hunting knife. At least Staten Island still has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412184407/http://gothamist.com/tags/ps22">PS 22</a> going for it...oh, and all the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412184407/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/10/staten_island_sees_fifth_hate_crime.php">hate crimes</a>.</p>
