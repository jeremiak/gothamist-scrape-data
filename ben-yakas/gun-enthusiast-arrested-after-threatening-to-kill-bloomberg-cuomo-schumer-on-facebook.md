<p>Some people still haven&apos;t learned that cops take <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130226023747/http://gothamist.com/tags/facebook">Facebook threats</a> very seriously: a 49-year-old Nanuet man <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130226023747/http://www.lohud.com/article/20130221/NEWS03/302210067/Nanuet-man-charged-death-threats-Obama-allies">has been arrested</a> after he allegedly compiled a Facebook Hit List and made threats against Mayor Bloomberg, Governor Cuomo, Senator Schumer, and other politicians. Police also found two rifles, bayonets, ammunition, a sword, knife and body armor at Lawrence Mulqueen&apos;s home. He has been arrested and charged with making terroristic threats, illegally possessing weapons and harassment.</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="22213gun2.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130226023747im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/22213gun2.jpeg" width="640" height="480"> <br> <i> Weapons found at Mulqueen&apos;s home (Clarkstown Police)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>Police were initially tipped off to Mulqueen vis his landlady, who filed a harassment complaint against him on Wednesday; she told police about his Facebook page, which was under a different name. On it, he said he was &#x201C;anxious to start killing various public officials&#x201D; and wanted &#x201C;all followers of President Barack Obama dead,&#x201D; calling them &#x201C;traitor scum&#x201D; and declaring &#x201C;death to them all.&#x201D; In addition to Bloomberg, Cuomo and Schumer, Mulqueen also called out Rep. Nita Lowey, Rep. Nancy Pelosi, Sen. Harry Reid and members of the Congressional Black Caucus.</p>

<p>&#x201C;I can&#x2019;t say what his intentions were or how serious his threats were,&#x201D; Sgt. Glenn Cummings of the Clarkstown police. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s better to be pre-emptive about these things rather than wait.&#x201D; Cumming <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130226023747/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2013/02/21/nanuet-man-accused-of-threatening-cuomo-bloomberg/">told 1010 WINS that</a> he believes Mulqueen was angry about gun legislation. &quot;I think what may have particularly have gotten his ire in the past month or two were the various legislations enacted with respect to the rights to possess a firearm. I think that was particularly upsetting to him,&quot; he said. &quot;One posting which was posted about a month ago said that if anybody ever came to take the arms, they would suffer the consequences.&quot;</p>
