<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="5411ryan.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110509171103im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/5411ryan.jpg" width="640" height="397" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>Noted motivational speaker and snack enthusiast <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110509171103/http://gothamist.com/tags/rexryan">Rex Ryan</a> turned up on <em>The Colbert Report</em> last night to talk about his new memoir, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110509171103/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/27/rex_ryan_pens_autobiography.php">&quot;Play It Like You Mean It.&quot;</a>  You can watch the interview below, including this gem: <strong>&quot;You ever look at a sunset and say, &apos;I&apos;d like to see somebody tackle that&apos;?&quot;</strong></p>

<p>Overall, Ryan was a bit dumbstruck at points in the conversation (&quot;I&apos;m afraid to answer&quot;), but smiled his way through questions about the royal wedding, the NFL strike, having the Jets play touch football, and the importance of &quot;tackling, catching balls.&quot; He did seem optimistic about owners and players coming to some agreement soon though: &quot;Someone&apos;s going to be eating breakfast soon.&quot;</p>

<p>Colbert gave some insights <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110509171103/http://twitter.com/#!/StephenAtHome/status/65625745392795648">in a Tweet</a> about how he got ready for the interview: &quot;To prepare for my interview with Rex Ryan, I watched the first 7 seasons of &apos;Coach.&apos;&quot; The other great line from the interview came right at the end of the piece: &quot;Your dad is a famous coach, Buddy Ryan. You&apos;re Rex Ryan.<strong> Is everyone in your family named after a dog?&quot;</strong></p>

<p>Ryan also showed up on <em>The Late Show with David Letterman</em> on Monday night, where he talked about the draft, called out the Patriots and Giants, and was asked whether he saw Brett Favre <strong>&quot;taking pictures of his thing.</strong>&quot; Watch it below:</p>
