<p>Another day, another poll lending credibility to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629201942/http://gothamist.com/tags/donaldtrump">Donald Trump&apos;s</a> <em>very serious</em> presidential campaign: Trump <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629201942/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/national/trump_in_full_gallup_FUK9qa4cZnhoUK0oqUKJdN?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">was tied</a> for first place with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629201942/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/2011/04/23/2011-04-23_glenn_beck_to_mike_huckabee_youre_thinnedskinned_and_shouldnt_run_for_president_.html">&quot;thin-skinned&quot;</a> Mike Huckabee in the newest Gallup poll of Republicans&apos; choices for the 2012 presidential nomination. But isn&apos;t it a bit hypocritical for someone who didn&apos;t vote in primary elections for more than two decades to run in a primary himself?</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629201942/http://www.ny1.com/content/top_stories/137902/donald-trump-s-primary-voting-record-spotty--records-show">NY1 reviewed records</a> from the City Board of Elections, and found out that Trump didn&apos;t vote in a primary election in a 21-year period. Before last year&apos;s GOP primaries, the previous time he did vote was in the 1989 NYC mayor&apos;s race&#x2014;when Rudy Giuliani beat businessman Ronald Lauder. He also missed several Republican presidential primaries, including 1988 when George Bush was nominated and 1996 when Bob Dole was; he missed the the 2001 and 2005 primaries for NYC mayor when he became a Democrat; and in 2002, he skipped both the Democratic primaries for statewide offices as well as the general election. </p>

<p>Trump told NY1 over the phone that he begged to disagree with the facts, and threw in a veiled threat for good measure: <strong>&quot;I voted in every general election&#x2026;You&#x2019;re going to pay a big price because you&#x2019;re wrong...I have records that I voted and so does the Board of Elections&#x2026;I signed in at every election.&quot;</strong> The Associated Press <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629201942/http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gpck3FYItFzb3rZSohO5mJKGextw?docId=2b5e546f640140739c0c59ae3b3129ef">also reviewed the records</a> and found the same information; his lawyer Michael Cohen defended his voting record to them: &quot;For one of the greatest international businessmen who travels all over the country and the world, his voting record is very, very good.&quot; They couldn&apos;t reach Trump himself, but maybe he is planning to send them <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629201942/http://www.salon.com/news/politics/war_room/2011/04/22/donald_trump_writes_to_salon/index.html">a handwritten note.</a></p>

<p>But why waste time focusing on things like <em>voting records</em> when we can just read hilarious Trump quotes! MSNBC has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629201942/http://firstread.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2011/04/22/6512995-the-quotable-donald-trump-">compiled a list</a> of some of the best of Trump&apos;s pithy one-liners about other celebrities and politicians. Here are some of our favorites:</p>

<ul>
	<li>On Rosie O&apos;Donnell: &#x201C;She went to my wedding. She had lots and lots of cake, and I&apos;ll tell you what, she is a terrible human being.&#x201D;  </li>
	
	<li>On Kevin Federline: &#x201C;You know when somebody likes you, you say &#x2018;Hey.&#x2019; So, I totally changed my mind. I think Kevin Federline is fantastic.&#x201D;</li>
	
	<li>On Rod Blagojevich: &#x201C;I don&apos;t say he&#x2019;s a rocket scientist.&#x201D;</li>
	
	<li>On Michael Jackson: &#x201C;Yes, he&apos;s a friend of mine. I mean, he&apos;s a good guy. You know, he&apos;s a little different.&#x201D;  </li>
	
	<li>On Richard Branson: &#x201C;I&apos;m not a man of the people, right? He is. But the fact is that, you know, as far as Branson&apos;s concerned, I doubt -- I personally don&apos;t see how he could be a billionaire. He&apos;s in the airline business. Who&apos;s a billionaire in the airline business?&#x201D; </li>
