<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504151159/http://gothamist.com/tags/warontots">War On Tots</a> continues: police are looking for a thief who allegedly stole $500 from a 3-year-old. Which might make you wonder what a 3-year-old was doing with $500 in the first place, unless he had taken out a loan to rent the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504151159/http://www.businessinsider.com/most-expensive-birthday-parties-2012-7?op=1">sickest shark tank</a> for his birthday. Except it turns out the child was a little thief himself!</p>

<p>Okay, that&apos;s not really true: according to police, the child was inside of a liquor store E. 163rd Street around 10:50 p.m. last Friday with his 43-year-old mom when he spotted the cash in her pocket. He took it out unbeknownst to her, all of which cops believe the suspect observed. The suspect, who is in his 30s, then removed the money from the child&apos;s hand and fled the store.</p>

<p>Anyone with information in regards to this grand larceny is asked to call the NYPD&apos;s Crime Stoppers Hotline at 800-577-TIPS. The public can also submit their tips by logging onto <a href="WWW.NYPDCRIMESTOPPERS.COM">Crime Stoppers</a> or texting their tips to 274637(CRIMES) then enter TIP577.</p>
