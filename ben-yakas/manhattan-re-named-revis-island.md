                            <p>At the well-attended <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131216173633/http://gothamist.com/2010/01/20/gang_green_rally_scheduled_for_time.php">pep rally</a> for the Jets in Times Square yesterday, Mayor Bloomberg <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131216173633/http://www.silive.com/jets/index.ssf/2010/01/not_just_times_square_all_of_manhattan_to_be_re-named_revis_island.html">announced</a> that Manhattan Island would be (unofficially) re-named &quot;Revis Island&quot; as long as the Jets were still in the playoffs. It&apos;s named after the All-Pro cornerback who has stifled and overwhelmed the league&apos;s top wide receivers this year (including twitter-enemy <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131216173633/http://gothamist.com/2010/01/06/bedroom_experience_proves_to_ochoci.php">Ochocinco</a>), and who the Mayor called &quot;the NFL defensive player of the year, as far as I&apos;m concerned.&quot; (You can see the sign hanging in Times Square above, along with some other creative &quot;Revis Island&quot; designs.)</p>

<p>Jets fever is really bursting the mercury this week: first there were those <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131216173633/http://gothamist.com/2010/01/20/rex_ryan_and_his_reported_7000_calo.php">7000 calorie meals</a>, then a kid was actually named <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131216173633/http://gothamist.com/2010/01/20/fan_names_kid_jets_jets_go_to_playo.php">J.E.T.S.</a>, then we all believed in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131216173633/http://gothamist.com/2010/01/21/mark_sanchez_believes_in_his_beard.php">Mark Sanchez&apos;s beard</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131216173633/http://stuffedcannoli.com/">Stuffed cannolis</a> on Stanton Street started selling green Jets themed cannolis (pistachio with extra green sprinkles), and now this. It&apos;s Revis Island now, we just rent space in it.<br>
