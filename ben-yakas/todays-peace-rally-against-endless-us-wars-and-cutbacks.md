<p>Today, the United National Antiwar Committee and the Muslim Peace Coalition, representing national and local Muslim organizations in the U.S., held a massive <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150228100425/https://nationalpeaceconference.org/Home_Page.html">anti-war rally</a>. The rally, against America&#x2019;s endless wars and cutbacks in the U.S., seems to be a grab bag of various ongoing crises and issues in American foreign policy. They write on their website:</p>

<blockquote>WE DEMAND Bring U.S. Troops, Mercenaries and War Contractors Home Now: Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan! End the sanctions and stop the threats of war against the people of Iran, North Korea and Yemen. No to war and plunder of the people of Latin America, the Caribbean, Africa! End U.S. Aid to Israel! End U.S. Support to the Israeli Occupation of Palestine and the Siege of Gaza!</blockquote>

<p>Hundreds of protesters started at Union Square at noon, with a cadre of performers and speakers getting things underway; they then walked downtown along Broadway. Tipster <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150228100425/http://tomslaughter.tumblr.com/">Tom Slaughter</a> took the above photos at Broadway and Prince early this afternoon. The event ends with a rally at Foley Square till 6 pm. If you have more photos from the rally, send them to tips@gothamist.com, or tag them as &quot;Gothamist&quot; on Flickr.</p>
