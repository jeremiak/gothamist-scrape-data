<p>A Brooklyn 7-year-old with severe signs of abuse, including heroin in her system and evidence of sexual abuse, fell out the 6th story window of her family&apos;s apartment this week. According to FDNY, the girl&#x2014;who has not been identified&#x2014;survived the fall from the Gravesend Houses in Coney Island around 7:45 p.m. on Wednesday evening; she is currently in serious condition at Lutheran Hospital with injuries to her head and lungs.</p>

<p>According <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130918041942/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20130712/coney-island/7-year-old-girl-with-evidence-of-abuse-falls-from-sixth-floor-apartment">to DNAInfo</a>, doctors testing her for broken bones and injuries from the fall found signs of sexual abuse, rope marks on her hands and wrists, and traces of opiates in her blood. Investigators are still trying to determine whether she jumped out the window, and if anyone was home with her at the time. </p>

<p>Earlier that day, the girl <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130918041942/http://brooklyn.news12.com/news/7-year-old-survives-6-story-window-fall-at-gravesend-housing-project-in-coney-island-1.5667236">had been reported missing</a>, but police returned her to her family about 20 minutes after the report was made. Officials from the city&apos;s Administration for Children&apos;s Services took custody of the girl&apos;s 1-year-old brother after the incident. No arrests have been made as of yet. </p>
