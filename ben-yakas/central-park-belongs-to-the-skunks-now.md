<p>Over the last several years, skunks have slowly grown more and more bold, staking out new territories across the city in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150517052932/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/28/videos_skunks_love_hanging_out_in_u.php">northern parts</a> of Manhattan, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150517052932/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/18/skunks_continue_their_invasion_of_n.php">Queens</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150517052932/http://gothamist.com/2010/01/20/bronx_residents_live_in_constant_fe.php">The Bronx</a>. But the one-striped beasts are still not satisfied, even with all <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150517052932/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/09/02/a-more-odorous-invader-joins-the-party/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_r=0">the sad husks</a> of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150517052932/http://gothamist.com/2009/09/27/skunks_invade_manhattan.php">NY Times writers</a> left in their wake. And according <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150517052932/http://nypost.com/2014/01/17/skunks-on-the-rise-in-central-park/">to the Post</a>, this has now led to New Yorkers relinquishing Central Park to the skunks, like some misguided form of appeasement. How many more shall fall before <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150517052932/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Horned_Owl">one shall stand up</a>?</p>

<p>Park workers tell the Post that the number of skunk sightings in Central Park in recent weeks has noticeably spiked: &#x201C;We are trying to figure out what&#x2019;s attracting them,&#x201D; one worker said. &#x201C;So far, we can&#x2019;t seem to figure it out.&#x201D; At least two defenseless dogs were sprayed by skunks near West 67th Street and Central Park West this week. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150517052932/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvqJ1mTkEuY">Shit is getting real, people.</a></p>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150517052932/https://twitter.com/106th">@106th</a> You mustve missed my panic when a skunk WALKED TOWARD ME in Central park. Oh Jesus I almost died.</p>&#x2014; Shugah (@Shugah) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150517052932/https://twitter.com/Shugah/statuses/407771094464991233">December 3, 2013</a></blockquote>

<p>Generally speaking, it&apos;s rare to find skunks hanging around Central Park, but like people, perhaps they just can&apos;t stay away from the chocolate bourbon pecan tarts at Le Pain Quotidien. Animal Control officials say they will only take action if the skunk is acting strangely (you know, rabid) and vets say skunks are fine unless you provoke them. </p>

<p>But if you&apos;re looking for a reason to not sleep at night, keep in mind that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150517052932/http://www.nyc.gov/html/doh/html/diseases/cdrab-cp.shtml">rabies can theoretically be spread via skunk spray,</a> so let&apos;s just shut down Central Park and never speak of this again.</p>
