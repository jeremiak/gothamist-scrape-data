Defiant skateboarders are out in full force today for the annual <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140219100551/http://gothamist.com/tags/broadwaybomb">&quot;Broadway Bomb&quot;</a> event, a nearly 8-mile Manhattan race for longboard aficionados in which they skate from West 116th Street by Riverside Park all the way down to the Charging Bull in the Financial District. Over 20 police officers and a dozen cop trucks took over Morningside Heights on Broadway all around W 107th and W 108th Streets this afternoon with orange police nets: &quot;This is a major artery,&quot; a cop told us. When asked how many trap points they set up in the city, we were told, &quot;you ask too many questions.&quot;</p>

<p>Cops were pushing the skateboarders over to Riverside Drive: &quot;We just don&apos;t want them going down Broadway,&quot; another cop said. Skateboarders seemed frustrated; a witness told us they saw at least two people being put into handcuffs closer to Columbia University. </p>

<p>&quot;This is a fun thing, but it&apos;s dangerous with all the traffic,&quot; Robert J. Fibel, 70, who has lived in the neighborhood for over 65 years, told us. &quot;Stupid yellow cabs own this street.&quot; Not all the skateboarders were trapped though&#x2014;check out lots of tweets, vines and instagrams below showing longboarders all across the city.</p>
