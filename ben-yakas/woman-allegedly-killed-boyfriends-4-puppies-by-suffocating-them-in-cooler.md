<p>A New Jersey woman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131013015849/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/American-Bulldog-Puppies-Killed-Food-Cooler-Linden-New-Jersey-Woman-Arrested-226958931.html">has been accused of killing</a> her boyfriend&apos;s four puppies by suffocating them in a food cooler. An unnamed acquaintance told police that Kimberly Matthews, 26, dropped off the blue Igloo cooler with four 5-week-old American bulldog puppies with her last Sunday; Matthews allegedly had a fight with her boyfriend, who breeds American bulldogs, and she threatened to kill the puppies. </p>

<p>&#x201C;She had the dogs in her possession and took them out of their cage and placed them into a cooler for reasons which escape me and apparently the dogs suffocated from inadequate ventilation,&quot; Linden Police Capt. James Sarnicki <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131013015849/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2013/10/08/n-j-woman-charged-after-4-puppies-found-dead-in-cooler/">told 1010 WINS.</a></p>

<p>When Matthews dropped the pups off, she noted that they were &#x201C;probably just sleeping,&#x201D; but the acquaintance quickly realized they were dead and contacted police. Matthews denied responsibility for the dogs&apos; deaths, but has now been charged with four counts of animal cruelty, and a disorderly conduct offense. </p>
