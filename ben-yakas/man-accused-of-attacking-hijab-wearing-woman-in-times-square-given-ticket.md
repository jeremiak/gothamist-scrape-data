<p>Last weekend, a man <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141230183212/http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/2013/09/times_square_ma.php">was arrested in Times Square</a> after he allegedly attacked a woman during a demonstration against the military coup in Egypt. As you can see in the video below, suspect Atef Sabry Abu El Enin, 33, of Washington D.C., hit Rachel Gunnoe, a stay-at-home mom from New Jersey, with her protest sign; he also called her a &quot;fucking terrorist.&quot; But <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141230183212/http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/2013/09/hijab_times_square_atef_sabry_abu_el_enin.php">according to the Village Voice</a>, so far El Enin has only been given a ticket for disorderly conduct.</p>

<p>&quot;I feel like the officers who arrested him and the precinct that he was in, the supervisor, I think that they dropped the ball,&quot; Gunnoe, who wears a hijab, told the Voice. The NYPD says the confrontation is being investigated as &quot;a possible bias incident.&quot; Gunnoe is happy about this, but notes that the detective in charge is &quot;doing what should have been done last Saturday.&quot;</p>

<p>&#x201C;Any American should be able to engage in peaceful protest without fear of assault or intimidation based on that person&#x2019;s religion, ethnicity or national origin,&#x201D; said <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141230183212/http://www.cair-ny.org/blog/cairny_nj_muslim_woman_assaulted_called_terrorist_at_prodemocracy_rally.html">Operations Coordinator Sadyia Khalique</a> of CAIR-NY, America&apos;s largest Muslim civil liberties and advocacy organization. &#x201C;We urge that appropriate charges be brought against the alleged assailant.&#x201D;</p>
