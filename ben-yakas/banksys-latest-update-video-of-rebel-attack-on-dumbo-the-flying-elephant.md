<p>Yesterday, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509023238/http://gothamist.com/tags/banksy">Banksy</a> unleashed his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509023238/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/06/photos_video_banksys_enchanting_mob.php#photo-1">enchanting mobile waterfall truck</a> upon the streets of NYC as the latest piece in his month-long open air street art tour of the city. He&apos;s now <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509023238/http://www.banksy.co.uk/">updated his site</a> with the video below, writing, &quot;I&#x2019;m not posting any pictures today. Not after this shocking footage has emerged...&quot; Warning: if you are easily upset by images of dead cartoon elephants, this video is not for you.</p>

<p>Reading between the lines, this seems like it could be a reference to the neighborhood DUMBO&#x2014;perhaps his latest piece is already there waiting to be discovered, or maybe the waterfall truck will be there later tonight. We&apos;ll update once we learn more information about the scavenger hunt.</p>
