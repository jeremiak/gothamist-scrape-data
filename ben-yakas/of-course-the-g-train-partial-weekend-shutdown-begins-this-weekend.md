                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="051913train.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130807024117im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_lauren/051913train.jpg" width="640" height="480"> <br> <i> Via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130807024117/http://www.flickr.com/photos/62159569@N08/">Scoboco&apos;s flickr</a></i></div> <p></p>

<p>With <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130807024117/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/03/56_million_suckers_to_leave_nyc_for.php">5.6 million suckers leaving the city</a> for the 4th of July weekend, you may have fantasies of a <em>Ferris Bueller&apos;s Day Out</em>-esque romp across the five boroughs, slipping effortlessly between air conditioned, half-empty subway cars. Better hope you don&apos;t have to cross from Brooklyn to Queens: the Greenpoint G Tube will be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130807024117/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/05/g_train_hell_greenpoint_tunnel_will.php">closed for repairs this weekend</a>. </p>

<p>The Greenpoint Tube, which carries the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130807024117/http://gothamist.com/tags/gtrain">G train</a> under Newtown Creek, will be closed for twelve, 53-hour long weekends&#x2014;starting Saturday July 6th&#x2014;to fix damage in the tunnel caused by Hurricane Sandy. The northernmost three stops&#x2014;<strong>Greenpoint Avenue, 21st Street and Court Square</strong>&#x2014;will be closed during these weekend shutdowns. G trains will still operate to and from Church Avenue and Nassau Avenue; a shuttle bus linking the shuttered stops will be provided. </p>

<p>The MTA swears that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130807024117/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/28/just_a_reminder_that_the_subway_is.php">the track work is unavoidable</a>, and they&apos;re working hard to keep your commute as smooth as possible; you can see some more information regarding alternate routes for the G train here [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130807024117/http://web.mta.info/nyct/service/G_GreenpointTunnelWeekendClosure.htm">pdf</a>]. </p>

<p>The closures are planned to start at midnight on each Friday of the following weekends: <strong>July 6-7, 13-14, 20-21; August 3-4, 10-11, 17-18, 24-25; September 7-8, 28-29; October 5-6; December 7-8, and 14-15</strong>. Then everything will be dandy, until next summer, when it shuts down for five hellish consecutive weeks in a row. And, of course, let&apos;s just all hope we don&apos;t have another superstorm in the fall, because that would really put a crimp in everything.</p>
