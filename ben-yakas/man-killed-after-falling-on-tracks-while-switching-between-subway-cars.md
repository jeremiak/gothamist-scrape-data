<p>A 30-year-old man died after falling onto the subway tracks while trying to switch between cars. According to the MTA, the incident happened just before 10 p.m. during last night&apos;s storm, when the as-yet unidentified man fell onto the northbound R train tracks near the 25th Street Station in Brooklyn. The man was reportedly moving between subway cars at the time.</p>

<p>When the man fell, &quot;his right arm got hooked onto the third rail,&quot; a police source <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507113607/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/queens/man-30-electrocuted-falling-subway-article-1.1853425">told the News.</a> He was declared dead at the scene. It&apos;s unclear whether he was drinking before the incident. Police say the investigation is ongoing.</p>

<p>This is not the first time in recent years that a straphanger has fallen onto the tracks while attempting to switch between cars: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507113607/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/12/man_crushed_to_death_between_subway.php">two people died</a> in 2010 that way, and another man <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507113607/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/01/video_man_falls_under_subway_car_in.php">was seriously injured</a> last year. </p>
