We&apos;re always interested in the latest dating <strike>trends</strike> nonsense, especially as it applies to alcohol, shyness, and awkward questions. And wouldn&apos;t you know it, the scientists over at OKCupid have been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150624120022/http://blog.okcupid.com/index.php/the-best-questions-for-first-dates/">examining the data</a> collected from OKCupid&apos;s user profiles, and have come to some <em>very definitive</em> conclusions about how to ask your date what you want to ask without actually asking what you want to ask. 
<br><br>
They give examples such as: 
<ul>
	<li>If you really want to know whether your date will sleep with you on the first date, ask them if they like the taste of beer&#x2014;beer drinkers are 60 percent more likely to be okay with sleeping with someone they&apos;ve just met</li>
	<li>If you want to know if your date is religious or not, ask them if grammar and spelling mistakes annoy them&#x2014;people who are annoyed by those mistakes are twice as likely to be religious</li>
	<li>If you want to know which way your date leans politically, ask them whether they prefer people in their lives to be simple or complex&#x2014;those who prefer complex people are twice as likely to be liberal and those who prefer simplicity are twice as likely to be conservative</li></ul><br><br>
We find the beer-lovers questions especially relevant, seeing as how NY is already a state filled with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150624120022/http://gothamist.com/2010/11/15/report_new_yorkers_binge_drinking_t.php">binge drinking louts</a>, who are so desperate for a taste of hops, we&apos;re willing to get a drink at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150624120022/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/14/duane_reade_wins_over_williamsburg.php">Duane Reade</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150624120022/http://gothamist.com/2010/01/22/burger_king_to_sell_beer_in_times_s.php">Burger King.</a> On the plus side, beer does make for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150624120022/http://gothamist.com/2010/02/08/got_beer_suds_make_strong_bones.php">healthier bones</a> allegedly, and you can always regale your special one-night someone with that tidbit of knowledge during a hangover-curing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150624120022/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/21/coffee_2.php">coffee</a> the morning after.
