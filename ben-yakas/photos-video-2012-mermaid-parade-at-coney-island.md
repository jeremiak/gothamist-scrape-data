<p>Sunny skies over Coney Island welcomed the annual <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130923134006/http://gothamist.com/tags/mermaidparade">Coney Island Mermaid Parade</a> on Saturday. Ronald McDonald was spotted brown-bagging, and a variety of aquatic-themed body-painted ladies and gents spent the day ambling around the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130923134006/http://gothamist.com/tags/coneyislandboardwalk">concretewalk</a>. San Francisco resident Susan Laurita&#x2014;who participated in the parade for the first time yesterday after attending as a spectator for the last 20 years&#x2014;summed up the experience much better than we ever could: &#x201C;It&#x2019;s so funny&#x2014;all of those years, I was in the crowd drunk,&#x201D; she <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130923134006/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/mermaid-parade-hits-coney-island-article-1.1101263">told the News</a>. &#x201C;Now, that I&#x2019;m sober, I still don&#x2019;t even know how to describe this!&#x201D; Check out a lot of photos above (some NSFW!), and a nice video document of the event below.</p>
