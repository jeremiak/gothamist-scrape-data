<p>Stage banter is one of the most underrated qualities of a musical frontman, and its greatest practitioners all have different styles: Bruce Springsteen delivers monologues about lost friends and the saving grace of rock &apos;n&apos; roll, Robert Pollard extols the virtues of alcohol in between hilarious rambles, Lou Reed at his peak was the meanest shit-talker in the world, and Lauryn Hill&apos;s diatribes are world famous. And then there&apos;s Paul Stanley, frontman of the merchandizing collective known as KISS, who has turned the act of shrieking a city&apos;s name, mewling unsubtle sexual innuendo, and screaming the word &quot;TEQUILLLLLLLA&quot; into an art form. </p>

<p>The above 45 minute clip, which has been floating around the internet <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140607204750/http://www.brooklynvegan.com/archives/2014/03/listen_to_an_ho.html">for a bit</a>,  is a redux of the classic Stanley fan-made bootleg, <em>Let Me Get This Off My Chest</em>. It reveals that Stanley is a poet of the mundane, turning phrases such as &quot;CAN WE GET ANY HOTTTTER?&quot; into liquid energy. As The AV Club <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140607204750/http://www.avclub.com/article/more-talk-less-rock-15-masters-of-onstage-banter-2016">put it</a>, Stanley&apos;s &quot;positive-power...insanity made him sound like a hyperactive motivational speaker.&quot; This is a man who can turn the phrase, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140607204750/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/pictures/paul-stanley-of-kiss-20-best-onstage-quotes-20140326/my-goodness-people-0448714">&quot;My goodness, people!&quot;</a> into a rallying cry! </p>

<p>KISS aficionados likely already know about Stanley&apos;s brilliant inability to control his pitch, but for the rest of us, this is a revelation. If you want to experience Stanley in person, KISS is coming to town <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140607204750/http://www.kissonline.com/tour">for several area shows this summer</a> (including Jones Beach and Atlantic City). The only thing that could possibly make it any better is if Axl Rose showed up and demanded Stanley give him some reggae:</p>
