<p>For the second time in under a year&#x2014;and possibly the second time in recorded history&#x2014;New Yorkers managed to go 24 straight hours without shooting, stabbing or slashing each other. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150717082313/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/city-24-hours-murder-article-1.1511412">The Daily News reports</a> the feat was achieved this past Thursday; the last time it occurred was on Nov. 26th, 2012. Too bad the Bad Old Days&#x2122; had to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150717082313/https://twitter.com/Lubchansky/status/399219598106832896">storm back almost immediately afterwards.</a> </p>

<p>The streak was snapped Friday when one man <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150717082313/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/09/man_fatally_shot_in_the_head_two_ot.php">was fatally shot in Brooklyn.</a> But <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150717082313/http://nypost.com/2013/11/06/ray-kelly-in-talks-for-jpmorgan-job/">future bank cop</a> Ray Kelly and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150717082313/http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/media/2013/11/8535598/michael-bloombergs-post-mayoral-day-job-will-be-bloomberg-view">future columnist</a> Mayor Bloomberg were both proud of the achievement: &#x201C;In the last month, we have seen the NYPD do the following: prevent a single homicide from occurring for an entire week &#x2014; a first in New York City; catch the killer in a 22-year-old murder; and now pull off the feat of no murders, no shootings and no stabbings for an entire day in a city of 8.4 million,&#x201D; a spokesman for Mayor Bloomberg said. &#x201C;The examples of why we have the finest police department in the world just keep coming.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Twice in the past year NYC has gone through extended periods without any murders: back in January the city <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150717082313/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/26/nyc_has_9_days_without_murder_thank.php">went nine days without a murder</a> (which some attributed to the cold weather), and more recently, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150717082313/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/14/zero_murders_in_nyc_last_week.php">the city went a full week</a> without any homicides (although there were six traffic fatalities during that period). </p>

<p>As it stands right now, NYC is currently on pace in 2013 to have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150717082313/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/03/nyc_on_pace_in_2013_for_least_amoun.php">the lowest number of homicides in over 60 years.</a> It&apos;s just too bad it&apos;ll all go right out the window <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150717082313/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/01/giuliani_de_blasio_will_totally_bri.php">once Mayor de Pinko is in charge, amirite?</a></p>
