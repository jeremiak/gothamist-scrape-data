<p>Last week, some Fox News anchors mustered up the courage to stop standing idly by as The Muppets <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406171412/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/05/video_of_course_fox_calls_the_muppe.php">brainwashed children with their anti-Capitalist agenda</a>. The new film&apos;s director, James Bobin, finally answered nagging questions around the movie&apos;s purported liberal bias, and refused to acknowledge the well-known fact that Fozzy Bear was always meant to be a stand-in for Trotsky. &quot;It&apos;s a very strange turn of events to hear a question like that. Cable news is 24 hours long so you have to fill it up with something. No, the Muppets are not communist,&quot; Bobin <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406171412/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/muppets-james-bobin-fox-communist-271949">told The Hollywood Reporter</a>. But isn&apos;t that EXACTLY what a communist would say?</p>

<p>Bobin responded to Fox Business host Eric Bolling&apos;s complaints about the movie&apos;s rapping villain (Chris Cooper) named Tex Richman, who Boiling claimed was part of the left&apos;s plan &quot;to manipulate your kids and give them the anti-corporate message.&quot; Bobin argued, &quot;the character of Tex Richman is not an allegory for capitalism in any way. The character is called Tex Richman. It&apos;s a joke. Clearly he is a classic, old school bad guy. He&apos;s bad not because he works for an oil company but because he&apos;s evil. No, it&apos;s not a communist movie in any way.&quot; Oh yeah, and next you&apos;re going to tell us the fact that Kermit is green isn&apos;t part of a sinister environmental agenda.</p>

<p>Elsewhere in the interview, Bobin discussed the enduring popularity of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406171412/http://gothamist.com/tags/themuppets">The Muppets</a> in decidedly Marxist terms:</p>

<blockquote>I think it&apos;s because they are all fundamentally flawed. Fozzy can&apos;t tell jokes, Miss Piggy can&apos;t really act or sing, but they all try their best and I think that&apos;s a very authentic idea. It doesn&apos;t matter if you&apos;re good at anything, just try your best. Then there&apos;s the idea that individually they&apos;re flawed but together they can do amazing things. I think that&apos;s a very nice message and it&apos;s not something you hit people over the head with. It just comes with The Muppets; it&apos;s what they&apos;re about. It&apos;s that kind of innocent try, try, try quality. And it also makes them underdogs. You can&apos;t help but support the underdog.</blockquote>

<p>Underdogs? Individually flawed but communally strong? <em>Try your best</em>? Read between the lines people. The only thing Fox can do to stem the liberal tide is to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406171412/http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/12/09/next-stop-for-cain-foxs-door-is-open/">continue hiring the best reporters and thinkers of our time.</a></p>
