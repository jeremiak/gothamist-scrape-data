<p>On Friday morning, two women <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170211045819/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/30/two_chinatown_women_executed_by_ars.php">were executed</a> and the Chinatown apartment they were in was set on fire. Police <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170211045819/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/chinatown_slay_victims_id_XxaUTXhYMPNKBd3pK0AB1N?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Manhattan">have now identified</a> the two victims: 70-year-old Xiao L. Li, who was shot once at close range, and 36-year-old Yong Hua Chen, who was shot in the right eyebrow and left eyeball. And police now believe the two may have been involved in the sex trade. </p>

<p>Sources told the Post that the apartment building at 83 Henry Street is a known prostitution location. After shooting the two women, the suspect <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170211045819/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/29/two_killed_in_chinatown_fire_this_m.php">then started fires</a> in the bedroom and kitchen of the first floor apartment around 10:30 a.m. Witnesses told cops they saw a young Asian man wearing gloves, despite the sweltering heat, fleeing the building after the fire was ignited.</p>

<p>Neither woman actually lived at 83 Henry Street&#x2014;Li lived on Bayard Street, and Chen lived in a different building on Henry Street. According <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170211045819/http://www.worldjournal.com/view/full_news/19166030/article-%E8%8F%AF%E5%9F%A0%E9%9B%99%E5%B1%8D%E6%A1%88-%E6%AD%BB%E8%80%85%E8%BA%AB%E5%88%86%E7%A2%BA%E8%AA%8D?instance=m1">to World News</a>,  Li has a son and daughter. Cops are still looking for surveillance video, and the investigation is ongoing. </p>
