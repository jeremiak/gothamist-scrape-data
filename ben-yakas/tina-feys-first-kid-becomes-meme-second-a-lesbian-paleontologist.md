<p>Beloved spectacles enthusiast <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509174045/http://gothamist.com/tags/tinafey">Tina Fey</a> has had a busy month, between the release of her book <em>Bossypants</em> and reassuring people about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509174045/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/07/30_rock_alec_baldwin_jk_about_show.php">the future of <em>30 Rock</em></a>. But online, the biggest headlines have involved her two kids: Fey announced on <em>Oprah</em> this week that she was pregnant with her second child, and told Dave Letterman last night that the kid will be financially supported by Oprah the rest of her life, and will probably turn out to be a lesbian paleontologist. Check the video below: </p>

<p>Not to be outdone by her unborn sibling, Fey&apos;s first daughter Alice has become a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509174045/http://www.urlesque.com/2011/04/14/tina-fey-swaggering-alice-meme/">cute meme</a> thanks to her undeniable swagger (see picture above). She was photographed walking around NYC with her mom and dad earlier this week, and has now been photoshopped alongside such classics as Sad Keanu, Prancing Cera and Strutting Leo. </p>
