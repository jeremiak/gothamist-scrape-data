<p>It wasn&apos;t all weddings and drum circles at the <a 11="" 20="" 2011="" href="href=" http:="" gothamist.com="" occupy_wall_street_returns_to_zucco.php"="">newly-neutered Zuccotti Park</a>: five <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111121192916/http://gothamist.com/tags/occupywallstreet">Occupy Wall Street</a> protesters (or OWS hangers-on) were arrested in the past three days for reasons ranging from throwing liquid in a cop&apos;s face to groping a woman. Most prominently, an alleged protester driving a Budget Truck <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111121192916/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/17/occupy_wall_street_tries_to_march_o.php#photo-22">was arrested during Thursday&apos;s &quot;day of action&quot;</a>&#x2014;and police say he had a .45-caliber handgun and 32 rounds of ammunition in the truck.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111121192916/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/17/occupy_wall_street_tries_to_march_o.php#photo-22">We reported on Thursday</a> that police had confiscated the Budget Truck because protesters were allegedly using it to transport tents and chains (see a picture of the truck above). The driver, Joshua Fellows of Youngstown, Ohio, didn&apos;t actually explicitly say he was part of OWS; when asked if he was a protester, Fellows replied, &quot;I plead the Fifth.&quot; </p>

<p>Cops later tracked Fellows down according <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111121192916/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/party_over_but_more_occupy_arrests_2Ouk2G4BfhM3YnQo5lLuMM">to the Post</a>, and found the gun during a search; he was charged with criminal possession of a weapon, arraigned, and was later released. Hopefully that means some <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111121192916/http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/03/05/us-montana-teaparty-idUSTRE7240EH20110305">defender of the second amendment</a> took up his cause. Or maybe he was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111121192916/http://www.examiner.com/pasco-county-independent-in-tampa-bay/tea-party-protesters-bring-their-big-guns-to-protest-rally">a Tea Party member</a> who got lost.</p>

<p>Then yesterday, 22-year-old Zach Breur allegedly groped the breasts and buttocks of a 22-year-old woman. He was charged with two counts of forcible touching. A homeless man cops identified as Michael Doe was busted the same day and charged with criminal mischef after he was spotted tampering with Christmas lights at the park. </p>

<p>A different 52-year-old homeless man was arrested after he allegedly threw an unknown liquid into a cop&#x2019;s face. And 24-year-old Star Bun was arrested after she refused to listen to cops who wouldn&apos;t let her bring her sleeping bag into Zuccotti; she was charged with criminal trespass and resisting arrest.</p>

<p>Of course, it&apos;s worth noting that except for Bun, there are no particular ties as far as we know between any of the other three people arrested&#x2014;the two homeless men and Breur&#x2014;and OWS, besides the fact that they were in the nearby area of Zuccotti Park. Could it be that the NY Post <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111121192916/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/03/the_ny_post_hates_occupy_wall_stree.php">has something against OWS</a>?</p>
