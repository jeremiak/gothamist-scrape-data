<p>We&apos;re all super-stoked about the summer 2012 blockbuster, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161330/http://gothamist.com/tags/thedarkknightrises"><em>The Dark Knight Rises</em></a>&#x2014;from what we can tell, based on all the filming around NYC this fall, it must be a documentary focusing on the dark underbelly of street closings. This week, everyone&apos;s been talking about the six-minute prologue, focusing on new villain Bane, which has been attached <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161330/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/03/where_to_see_the_dark_knight_rises.php">certain IMAX screenings</a>&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161330/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1676025/dark-knight-rises-prologue.jhtml">some have said</a> it &quot;will have your jaw drop,&quot; while others have complained about Bane&apos;s voice. Now, it&apos;s been revealed that a new trailer for the film will accompany <em>Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol</em>, opening on Friday. But thanks to the internet, you can watch a leaked version of the trailer below!</p>

<p>It&apos;s shaky obviously, but it has got us very excited. Highlights include first looks at Anne Hathaway, Marion Cotillard and Joseph Gordon-Levitt; a look at what appears to be a mustachioed, recuperating Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale); Bane (Tom Hardy) destroying a football field; the Batwing in action; and Bane&apos;s chilling line to Batman, &quot;With Gotham in ashes, you&apos;ll have my permission to die.&quot; Hopefully we&apos;ll get a high-quality version soon!</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: The video has been taken down after requests from Warner Bros. But for those who haven&apos;t seen it yet, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161330/http://lmgtfy.com/?q=dark+knight+rises+trailer">there&apos;s always Google!</a></p>
