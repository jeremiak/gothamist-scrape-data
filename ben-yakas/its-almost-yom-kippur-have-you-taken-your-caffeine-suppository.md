It is the Day of Atonement, marked by reflection, praying and fasting. And while Paul Krugman <a hef="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/09/17/happy-yom-kippur-2/?src=twt&amp;twt=NytimesKrugman">is blasting Heart</a> to get in the mood, others are rushing to their local pharmacies to procure their sacred caffeine suppositories. </p>

<p>In preparation for the 25-hour fast, many Jews <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502110715/http://www.jewcy.com/post/angetevka_days_0">have turned to caffeine suppositories</a> as a means of keeping themselves attentive and engaged through the High Holy day, and keep their minds off the feast that awaits them at the end. &#x201C;<strong>It helps&#x2014;you know, it&#x2019;s hard to concentrate when you&#x2019;re fasting and also addicted to caffeine</strong>. Some take it before sundown, but most take it throughout their fasting. These guys love a good loophole,&#x201D; Baruch Herzfeld, an Orthodox Jew who owns a bike store in Williamsburg, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502110715/http://www.brooklynpaper.com/stories/33/39/all_caffeinesuppositories_2010_09_24_bk.html">told Brooklyn Paper</a>. </p>

<p>Because you put it up your tuchus, you avoid breaking the fast, although some scholars debate whether putting any object inside your body is breaking the spirit of the day. &#x201C;We&#x2019;re supposed to do it the old fashioned way&#x2014;I wouldn&#x2019;t advise [suppositories]. <strong>We wanna keep Jews in the synagogue and not in the bathroom</strong>,&#x201D; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502110715/http://www.brooklynpaper.com/stories/33/39/all_caffeinesuppositories_2010_09_24_bk.html">said Rabbi Simcha Weinstein</a>, a Hasidic leader.</p>
