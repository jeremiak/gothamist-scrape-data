<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502142050/http://gothamist.com/tags/davechappelle">Dave Chappelle</a> popped up a few times for some <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502142050/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/27/dave_chappelle_and_chris_rock_perfo.php">unannounced sets</a> at the Comedy Cellar last year (he brought along <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502142050/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/28/photos_video_dave_chappelle_and_chr.php#photo-1">some famous friends</a> as well), but the Funny or Die&#x2019;s Oddball Comedy Festival, which he was on, skipped NYC in favor of a few NJ dates. Chappelle will remedy that grave wrong soon enough though, with his first show in NYC in 10 years.</p>

<p>Chappelle <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502142050/http://theurbandaily.com/2014/03/28/dave-chappelle-nyc-comedy-show/?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter">will perform</a> at Radio City Music Hall on June 19th; tickets for the show go on sale April 4th, but if you are an American Express card member, you can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502142050/http://www.ticketmaster.com/Dave-Chappelle-tickets/artist/803682">buy your tickets</a> through pre-sale on April 1st. </p>

<p>If you do go, you can expect a lot of humorous storytelling, as is his style now. Try not to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502142050/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/30/videos_dave_chappelle_relentlessly.php">heckle him</a> if you can control yourself. And whatever you do, do NOT <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502142050/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/05/video_dave_chappelle_really_hates_h.php">bring up Hartford.</a> </p>
