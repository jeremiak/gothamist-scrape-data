<p>Everyone loves <em>The Lion King</em>, the Tony Award-winning Broadway musical that has been running for approximately 25 years or whatnot. So the cast decided to take a break between shows on June 28th and head down to the A train at 59th Street to surprise straphangers with an a capella performance of &quot;Circle Of Life.&quot; </p>

<p>Everyone on board appears to be having a pretty good time in the video, <em>except</em> for the gentleman who shows up from 1:23-1:34, and seems to have burrowed his fist so deeply into his cheek that he no longer has a cheek, just a wayward facial fist growth that he should probably have checked immediately by a medical professional.</p>

<p>When we said earlier that &quot;everyone&quot; loves <em>The Lion King</em>, we weren&apos;t referring to YouTube commenters, who were, as expected, both killjoys and semi-incoherent in their appraisals of the performance. But packing their misanthropy together congeals into a sort of mind-numbing yet-strangely-beautiful form of angst-ridden poetry. It&apos;s kind of adorable how mad they are.<br>
 <br>
</p><div style="text-align: center;">&quot;I hope it sounded better in person <br>
if someone started singing that loud on my morning commute, I&apos;d blow a gasket XD&#xFEFF;&quot; <br>
&quot;Just a load of annoying and inaudible screaming and shouting!&quot; <br>
&quot;This is super rude&quot; <br>
&quot;This fucking horrendous what a bunch of hacks. learn how to singing you idiots&#xFEFF;&quot; <br>
&quot;If its happen in our TTC Subway am fuckin like to Die but I cant Handle it this shit At all.&#xFEFF;&quot;<br>
&quot;I hate these &quot;love life&quot; people , sing in the fucking shower dickheads&quot;<br>
&quot;Am I the only one who thinks this sounds horrible? <br>
Just a bunch of assholes yelling&quot;</div><p></p>

<p>Anyway, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150607190914/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/19/video_the_only_7_seconds_of_subway.php">this is still</a> our favorite <em>Lion King</em>/subway-related thing ever:</p>
