<p>Despite trading All-Star <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429171750/http://gothamist.com/2011/07/27/bye_bye_beltran_mets_agree_to_trade.php">Carlos Beltran</a> this week, the Mets have been playing some of their best ball of the season lately. In the midst of a five game winning streak that has put them four games above .500, the team defeated the Washington Nationals handily in D.C. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429171750/http://gothamist.com/2011/07/30/last_nights_action_mets_continue_wi.php">last night</a>.
