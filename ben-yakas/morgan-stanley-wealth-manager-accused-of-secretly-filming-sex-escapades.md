<p>A Morgan Stanley wealth manager has been accused of secretly filming several sexual trysts with various women. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131113095354/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/morgan-stanley-bigwig-secretly-taped-sex-romps-prosecutors-article-1.1511592">According to the News</a>, private wealth manager John C. Kelly allegedly filmed having sex with three different women in his E. 69th Street pad between September 2011 and December 2012. &#x201C;In this case, the defendant videotaped three unrelated women while they were performing sexual acts on him in his home,&#x201D; prosecutor Siobhan Carthy said.</p>

<p>&#x201C;Defendant did surreptitiously video record informant engaged in sexual contact with defendant and such images show informant&#x2019;s breasts,&#x201D; the complaint reads. The victim &#x201C;did not consent to such images being recorded and defendant did not have permission or authority to record or possess such images.&#x201D; Another one of the women says her &quot;breast, vagina and buttocks&quot; were all captured on video by him.</p>

<p>One of the women, whose name hasn&apos;t been released, allegedly trashed Kelly&#x2019;s apartment, pouring soda on his computer, in retaliation over the tape. She was arrested, but the case is expected to be dismissed. Kelly has been charged with three felony counts of unlawful surveillance in the second degree; he faces a maximum of four years in prison on each count.<br>
