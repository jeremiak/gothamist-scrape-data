<p>This week, a 13-year-old boy <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150103065851/http://gothamist.com/2014/04/15/13-yr-old_bystander_shot_in_face_du.php">was shot twice in the head</a> by stray bullets while standing outside a Flatbush Avenue pizzeria with his aunt. Victim Gama Droiville was shot once in the right eye and once in the back of the head, and may lose his eye as a result. Kareem Potomont, 21, has now been arrested for the shooting, and Gama says he forgives him: &quot;I forgive him. Let justice come from God,&quot; he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150103065851/http://nypost.com/2014/04/19/teen-boy-shot-in-face-says-he-forgives-shooter/">told the Post</a> from Kings County Hospital. &quot;Hand over your life to Christ. You would be doing good things and not endangering other people&#x2019;s lives.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150103065851/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/18/nyregion/police-capture-and-question-suspect-in-shooting-of-brooklyn-teenager.html?ref=nyregion">Police say</a> Potomont fired several rounds at 24-year-old Eduardo Dolphy, striking him in the leg, just before noon on Monday. Gama, who has been waiting for a bus, was struck in the crossfire. &quot;My cousin said he saw two people arguing, but I didn&apos;t see anything,&quot; Gama <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150103065851/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local/new_york&amp;id=9507128">told ABC</a>. &quot;Then they pulled out guns and started shooting at each other. And I think one of their bullets hit me above my right eye, and I fell to the ground.&quot;</p>

<p>It&apos;s unclear exactly what sparked the shooting, although cops say they believe it &quot;may have stemmed from a local rivalry.&quot; Potomont has been charged with two counts each of attempted murder, assault, possession of a firearm, criminal use of a firearm and reckless endangerment. &quot;I feel he should be locked away for a long time,&quot; Gama added. &quot;I will feel safer if he is not on the streets anymore.&quot;</p>
