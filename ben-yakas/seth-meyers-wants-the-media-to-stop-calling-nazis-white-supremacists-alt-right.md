<p>With a surprising amount of stories <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161211040541/http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-pol-white-nationalists-thinktank-20161119-story.html">popping up</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161211040541/http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/commentary/ct-nazi-hipster-fashy-haircut-20161206-story.html">lately</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161211040541/http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/02/europe/austria-alt-right-identity-movement-martin-sellner/">glamorizing</a> white supremacists, Seth Meyers thinks the media needs to chill the fuck out&#x2014;he doesn&apos;t understand how certain sites could ever confuse hipsters for Nazis, and wants everyone to use the correct language in discussing these people. &quot;&apos;Alt-right&apos; is the name <em>they</em> picked for themselves,&quot; Meyers argued. &quot;If zombies wanted to be called &apos;Post-life brain foodies,&apos; we&apos;d still call them zombies.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Get your shit together, media!&quot; Meyers continued. &quot;Calling Nazis and white supremacists the alt-right is like calling O.J. Simpson a cutlery enthusiast.&quot;</p>

<p>Stephen Colbert also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161211040541/http://dcist.com/2016/12/video_stephen_colbert_tackles_pizza.php">had some strong words</a> to say about the alt-right, in particular those members who have bought into the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161211040541/http://dcist.com/2016/12/what_on_earth_is_pizzagate_why_did.php">Pizzagate conspiracy theory</a> bullshit. </p>
