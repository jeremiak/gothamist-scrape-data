<p>A dead man was discovered on a train in Brooklyn this morning. According to the MTA, the 53-year-old black man was spotted by a conductor on a southbound 4 train near the Utica Avenue station around 7 a.m. Friday. They add that he died of &quot;natural causes.&quot;</p>

<p>The train&apos;s conductor first thought the man, who hasn&apos;t been identified yet, was just sick and unresponsive, before realizing that the man wasn&apos;t breathing. Service was delayed on the line for about 45 minutes on the line because of the discovery. </p>
