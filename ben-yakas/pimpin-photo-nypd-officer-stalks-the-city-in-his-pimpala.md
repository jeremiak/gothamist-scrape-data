<p>We&apos;ve had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131027072411/http://gothamist.com/tags/hipstercop">Hipster Cops</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131027072411/http://gothamist.com/tags/pepperspraycop">Pepper Spray Cops</a>, and even <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131027072411/http://gothamist.com/tags/cannibalcop">Cannibal Cops</a>, but never an honest-to-goodness <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131027072411/https://www.facebook.com/pages/The-3-Bs-of-Life-Bag-Bang-Bounce-If-you-a-pimp-this-the-Motto/102801336454461">bag-bang-bouncing</a> Pimp Cop&#x2014;okay, that&apos;s not true, we have had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131027072411/http://gothamist.com/tags/montygreen">LITERAL pimp cops who allegedly pimped on the side</a>, but we&apos;ve never had a cop who pimped his official NYPD ride with such simple elegance&#x2014;until now!</p>
