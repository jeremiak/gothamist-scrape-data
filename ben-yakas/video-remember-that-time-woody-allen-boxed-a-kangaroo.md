<p>Earlier this month, we <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151021164544/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/02/video_woody_allen.php">revisited a video</a> in which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151021164544/http://gothamist.com/tags/woodyallen">Allan Stewart Konigsberg</a> took a long hard look at himself and his career. And yet, despite getting surprisingly introspective, he failed to mention anything about what is obviously his ultimate career highlight: boxing a kangaroo in 1966 on British variety TV show <em>Hippodrome</em>. </p>

<p>Yes, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151021164544/http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2011/11/21/woody_allen_boxes_a_kangaroo_video.html">it&apos;s been tossed around for a month or so,</a> but it is STILL much, much more enjoyable than <em>Anything Else</em>.</p>
