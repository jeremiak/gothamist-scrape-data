<p>Body painter Andy Golub has been decorating topless women <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429111839/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/20/body_art_in_times_square.php">throughout the city</a> for years while on some sort of quest to make every woman feel like a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429111839/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ThunderCats">Thundercats</a> Easter Egg. But there&apos;s one rule to getting away with nude painting publicly&#x2014;always keep your G-string on. And yesterday, one of Golub&apos;s models/canvases was briefly arrested in Times Square for that offense. &quot;I don&apos;t believe there is truly anything wrong with what I did and with what he was doing,&quot; model Zoe West <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429111839/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/artist_naked_paint_babe_busted_y0pgK16ifCqGWqmjSCoe8O">told the Post</a> after her release.</p>

<p>Golub had warned 21-year-old West that the stunt could land her in jail, but she was game. It took over two hours for Golub to paint her in front of spectators at West 44th Street and Broadway; cops then held her for an hour in the nude. &quot;It was wild. I walked into the precinct, and there were about six cops standing behind the counter. Everyone went, &apos;Whoa! What&apos;s this?&apos;&quot; West <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429111839/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2011/08/31/2011-08-31_gets_nude_nabbed_in_times_sq.html">told the News.</a></p>

<p>At the end of July, Golub and two completely naked models <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429111839/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/20/body_art_in_times_square.php">were briefly arrested</a> on public-lewdness charges in Times Square as well. Golub and West&apos;s lawyer defended the art: &quot;New York State Law prohibits public nudity, except if it&apos;s part of a play, performance, exhibition or show,&quot; said Ron Kuby. West later said cops dropped all charges. </p>
