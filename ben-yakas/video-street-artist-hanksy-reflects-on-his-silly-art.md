<p>Lately, everyone&apos;s favorite Banksy-aping street artist <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160501055710/http://gothamist.com/tags/hanksy">Hanksy</a> has been branching out into non-Tom Hanks territory with odes to many pop cultures figures of past and present, including Ted Danson, the Huxtable family, and Ryan Gosling. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160501055710/http://kskill.com/">Keith Haskel got the chance</a> to accompany him while he put up two pieces in Little Italy (on Aziz Ansari/Iron Man and Jim Gaffigan), and created a mini-doc about him. It turns out that Hanksy just wants to make people happy: &quot;Maybe one day I will be a little more serious...but right now I just want to make myself and other people laugh,&quot; Hanksy said. &quot;It&apos;s so stupid, and that&apos;s why people fucking hate me. Clearly it&apos;s so asinine...People ask me &apos;why?&apos; Why not!&quot;</p>

<p>Or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160501055710/http://tomhanksy.tumblr.com/">as Hanksy himself</a> referred to the video: &quot;Watch me put up street fart and listen while I talk in a super funny distorted voice.&quot; Hanksy was creating these pieces for The Art of Comedy&apos;s installation as part of the NY Comedy Festival, so he had a permit to work that night. But as Haskel told us: &quot;He did ask that I blur his face and morph his voice, as his pieces normally aren&apos;t legal.&quot; </p>

<p>For more Hanksy, check out this long interview <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160501055710/http://www.timeout.com/newyork/things-to-do/hanksy-street-art-interview">with Time Out New York</a>, in which he talks about getting getting shoutouts from the real Tom Hanks: &quot;Every time something like that happens I just smile and go, That&#x2019;s so cool, shit like that can happen to normal people from the Midwest like myself. It&#x2019;s a really flattering&#x2014;and odd&#x2014;experience.&quot;</p>
