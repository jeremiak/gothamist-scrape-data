<p><strong>Update</strong>: The MTA says the Brooklyn-bound F train, which was headed to Sitwell Avenue, is an eight car train, and derailed about 1200 feet south of the 65th Street local station. It was running on the express track, and there have been no reports of injuries yet. The MTA adds they are sending rescue trains to aid passengers, and the FDNY says they are working on &quot;an evacuation plan&quot; with the MTA to get all the passengers onboard off.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: People are still being brought out of the tunnels at the scene as of noon, including a few people on stretchers. Armando Lontoc, 59, lives in the building above where the derailment occurred, and told us he and his daughter felt a rumbling as it happened: &quot;We heard a low rumbling, like [the train] was braking. And my daughter turns to me and says, &apos;It might be our neighbors playing loud music.&apos;&quot;</p>

<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="//web.archive.org/web/20150428173121if_/http://www.youtube.com/embed/QEAa3U6mQyk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>Passenger Mark Udit, 31, told us he was on the front car when the lights suddenly went off. He said that it didn&apos;t feel like the train derailed, but rather like a &quot;severe but regular jolt, as if the car has hit a bump.&quot; The conductor came on and told passengers the train had derailed and it would take awhile to get out. Udit said he had to wait approximately an hour-to-an-hour and a half to get off. </p>

<p>While the first car was mostly undamaged, he saw that the third car was &quot;on a good tilt,&quot; and there were a bunch of mangled seats. Some people in the first car were dizzy because of lack of air, but there were no serious injuries otherwise on that car. You can see video of firefighters <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428173121/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20140502/woodside/f-train-derails-queens">entering one of the cars here.</a></p>

<p>&quot;I thought it was an earthquake,&quot; passenger Caisha Jean Phillipe, 21, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428173121/http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2014/05/02/new-york-city-subway-train-derails-in-queens-officials-said/">told the Wall Street Journal</a>. &quot;I thought it was driving too fast then the train just&quot; stopped. &quot;It was like really scary, we felt like it hit something,&quot; said fellow passenger Gabrielle Hesop. &quot;We thought we crashed into a train, or we thought the train was on fire.&quot;</p>

<p>As of 1 p.m., the train derailment is under control. Altogether, at least 19 people sustained minor injuries, including four with serious injuries. At a press conference, officials said six out of the eight train cars went off of the tracks&#x2014;the front and last cars didn&apos;t. They need to move those trains from the track before service can resume normally, though they promise local service will be back for rush hour (albeit, expect it to be overcrowded). </p>
