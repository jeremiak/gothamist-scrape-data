<p>Things have been very bad in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141129053413/http://gothamist.com/tags/breezypoint">Breezy Point</a>, the tight-knit blue collar beach community in Queens, since <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141129053413/http://gothamist.com/tags/hurricanesandy">Hurricane Sandy</a> hit almost a month ago. As if having their homes destroyed and their community devastated wasn&apos;t enough, Breezy Point residents have been facing a serious uptick in burglaries around the area. And they didn&apos;t even get a break over the Thanksgiving holiday: at least three homes were robbed between Wednesday and Thursday this week.</p>

<p>According <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141129053413/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/queens/looters_steal_giving_EUscZXOhIrFQoaIGq7r6UL">to the Post</a>, those burglaries included a home whose basement art and recording studios, as well as two cars, were lost to Sandy&#x2019;s floodwaters. The thieves stole $400 in two change jars: &#x201C;I&#x2019;ve been putting my best efforts forward into putting my home back together and staying strong,&#x201D; said the home&#x2019;s owner, Robert Bainbridge. &#x201C;This just adds insult to injury.&#x201D; He added: &#x201C;It&#x2019;s a total lack of morals and ethics on their part...Whoever did this is not thinking, &#x2018;This could happen to me.&#x2019; &#x201D;</p>

<p>Another woman whose home was broken into called it a &#x201C;terrible violation.&#x201D; The woman, who didn&apos;t want her name used, said thieves stole her husband&#x2019;s collection of silver half-dollars, worth $25,000, and a pair of stolen watches with sentimental value. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m very uncomfortable. I don&#x2019;t want them coming back here. All I wanted to do was come home,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;We&#x2019;ve lived here for 30 years, and nothing like this has ever happened.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Overall, there were 14 home break-ins from Nov. 12 to Nov. 18, compared with none a year before; in the 28 days before that, there were 48 burglaries, compared to only four reported in that time period last year.<br>
