<p>We&apos;re over three weeks removed from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140428044751/http://gothamist.com/tags/hurricanesandy">Hurricane Sandy</a>, and clean-up efforts from the extensive and debilitating <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140428044751/http://gothamist.com/tags/flooding">flooding</a> are still going on. Police <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140428044751/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/flood_of_evidence_xywnWNUHYX7QRI1KSE3sHJ">are dealing with</a> thousands of pieces of evidence in NYPD storage centers that were damaged, and the MTA is still clearing out some tunnels. Below, you can get another dramatic reminder of how bad the flooding was from this video of the Queens-Midtown Tunnel during the storm. </p>

<p>It took almost two weeks to reopen the tunnel after the storm hit&#x2014;it also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140428044751/http://gothamist.com/2012/11/09/mta_ceo_lhota_apologizes_to_bloombe.php">caused some friction</a> between MTA CEO and Chairman Joe Lhota and Mayor Bloomberg. Lhota had to apologize after he said Bloomberg &#x201C;like an idiot&#x201D; had made arbitrary predictions to reporters about when the tunnel might be open. </p>

<p>The MTA has also released videos of crazy flooding <a href=" http://gothamist.com/2012/11/15/videos_crazy_flooding_at_path_stati.php">at the PATH station in Hoboken</a>, inside <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140428044751/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/30/video_inside_the_totally_flooded_br.php">the Brooklyn Battery Tunnel</a>, and the South Ferry and Whitehall Street Station, which you can see below.</p>
