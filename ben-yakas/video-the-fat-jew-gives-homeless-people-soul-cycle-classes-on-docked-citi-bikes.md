<p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429152239/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/12/stationary_citi_bike.php#photo-1">we reported on the hot new trend</a> that&apos;s been going on as long as bike share has been available&#x2014;people using <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429152239/http://gothamist.com/tags/citibike">Citi Bikes</a> as stationary bikes. A few <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429152239/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/06/12/spinning-on-citi-bikes/?_r=0">monocles were broken</a>, but for the most part, people seemed pretty fine with the idea. Now, TV personality and rapper <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429152239/https://twitter.com/FATJEW">The Fat Jew</a>&#x2014;aka Fabrizio Goldstein&#x2014;has taken things one step further, by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429152239/http://www.thecrosbypress.com/2013/06/20/soul-cycle-for-homeless-people-is-apparently-a-thing-that-is-now-happening-in-new-york-city/">offering free SoulCycle classes</a> on docked Citi Bikes to people identified in a video as &quot;the homeless.&quot;</p>

<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429152239if_/http://www.youtube.com/embed/eABKmjgDGTc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>It&apos;s unclear from the video whether the participants are actually homeless or actors appearing in what<em> seems to be</em> a parody of self-absorbed fitness-crazy trainers. It&apos;s safe to say that Goldstein, whom we saw baring <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429152239/http://laist.com/2013/04/13/nsfw_coachellas_most_insane_belly_drawing.php">some insane belly drawings at Coachella</a>, is joking, and a charitable view of this video is that it makes light of SoulCycle fanatics, not homelessness. Goldstein explains that SoulCycle &quot;is too expensive, it&apos;s not available to everybody&quot; and tells the camera:</p>

<p>&quot;<strong>I want the homeless people of NY to have the opportunity to have sick bodies, they could have really gorgeous bodies</strong>,&quot; he says. &quot;They just need the right workout regiments. And Citi Bike has really opened up a new world to them. It&apos;s a New Yorker helping other New Yorkers get beautiful definition.&quot;</p>

<p>We&apos;ve contacted Goldstein to talk more about this, and we&apos;ll update this later. For now it appears his idea is already catching on. </p>
