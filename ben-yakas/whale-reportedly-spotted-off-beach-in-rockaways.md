<p>According to multiple people, a whale has been spotted just off of Rockaway Beach in Queens this morning. Phillip Pond told us he first saw it surface near the beach at 90th Street while watching a live surf cam around 10:40 a.m. &quot;Breached well out of water,&quot; he said. &quot;Not clear what species, but clearly very large. I watched for a few more minutes and it spouted several times.&quot; As you can see below, other people have been tweeting about it as well.</p>

<p>Rob DiGiovanni, director of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130917001622/http://www.riverheadfoundation.org/index.asp">the Riverhead Foundation</a>, told us they didn&apos;t have any reports about this whale yet, but whales are known to pop up here and there offshore around the city throughout the year: &quot;It&apos;s unusual but not uncommon.&quot; In the last year, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130917001622/http://gothamist.com/tags/whale">at least two whales have been spotted</a> near the Rockaways, including one who waved to the camera and an emaciated one who died on the beach.</p>

<p>DiGiovanni added that people are encouraged to stay 50 yards away from the animal if they&apos;re in the water, and contact Riverhead with any sightings at sightings@riverheadfoundation.org (or call 1-631-369-9829). <br>
