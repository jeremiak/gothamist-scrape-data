<p>Last week, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717095347/http://gothamist.com/tags/citibike">Citi Bike</a> had its long-awaited, much-debated soft launch for all its early adopters. But starting today, anyone with a credit or debit card will be able to take one of these bikes out <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717095347/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/01/video_conservative_who_represents_m.php">for a bit of totalitarian fun</a>. You can now purchase a 24-hour or seven-day pass at any of the 330 Citi Bike stations.</p>

<p>A 24-hour pass is $9.95 and a seven-day pass is $25. However, that entitles you to take as many 30 minute trips as you want. If you go over 30 minutes on any single trip, you&apos;ll have to pay overtime fees. If you go for 30-60 minutes, it&apos;ll cost $4 extra; if you go 60-90 minutes, it&apos;ll cost $13; and for every additional half hour after that, it&apos;s $12. You can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717095347/http://citibikenyc.com/blog/2013/05/31/june-2nd-citi-bike-opens-for-all">find out more information here.</a> </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717095347/http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/better-peddle-pedals-article-1.1360254?localLinksEnabled=false">The Daily News thinks</a> these passes will help Citi Bike make a little more money, but they&apos;re still skeptical that the program can go into the black: </p>

<blockquote>As of 5 p.m. Friday, the company reported signing up 25,276 members at $95 a pop. That totals $2.4 million in revenue for the next year &#x2014; not much when you have 6,000 bikes on the road, 300 computerized docking stations, support vans roaming the city seven days a week, 24 hours a day, a rented warehouse, a computer network and who knows how many workers toiling to keep everything rolling.</blockquote>

<p>But Bloomberg thinks that&apos;s just fine, because the whole endeavor is privately-funded, and is already the largest bike share program in the country. &#x201C;When Citi Bike is fully built out, it will feature 10,000 bikes at 600 stations,&quot; he said during his weekly radio address. &quot;With more people choosing to get around town by bike, it&apos;s important for all of us&#x2014;cyclists, pedestrians, and drivers&#x2014;to follow the rules of the road, so we can keep making our streets safer than ever.&quot; Well, of course <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717095347/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/01/video_conservative_who_represents_m.php">a world famous &quot;practiced denier&quot;</a> would feel that way.</p>
