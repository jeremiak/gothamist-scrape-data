<p><strong>[Update Below]</strong> After changing this year&apos;s stomping grounds <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161211141714/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/25/santacon_2016_williamsburg.php">from Williamsburg</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161211141714/http://gothamist.com/2016/12/08/shelter_in_place.php">to Manhattan</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161211141714/http://gothamist.com/tags/santacon">SantaCon 2016</a> is set to kickoff a day of drunken revelry tomorrow in the Flatiron District around 11 a.m. Or perhaps not, according to some flyers that have been posted around Williamsburg and the East Village in the last day or so. Can locals really singlehandedly cancel a hotly-contested annual tradition with the power of flyers and petitions? </p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="120916santacon2.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20161211141714im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/120916santacon2.jpg" width="640" height="675"> <br> <i> Spotted in Williamsburg (Phil Sheehan)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>The answer to that, as with all questions pertaining to petitions, is almost definitely, &quot;nah.&quot; The flyers say that no congregating in Santa outfits, no throwing up on the sides of buildings, no public sex acts and no excessive drunkenness will be allowed (mind you, those last three things are discouraged by SantaCon organizers as well). The fine print doesn&apos;t offer much in the way of evidence of anything serious:</p>

<blockquote>New York City residents have petitioned to cancel SantaCon 2016 due to the types of people it attracts. This petition received overwhelming support. As a result, SantaCon 2016 and all future SantaCon celebrations have been cancelled within New York City limits. Residents of New York City thank you for your cooperation.</blockquote>

<p>The organization cited at the bottom of the flyer, NYCR, leads to a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161211141714/http://nycresidents.godaddysites.com/">very sketchy and undeveloped Go Daddy website</a>, with no links about their events or causes, almost as if it were slapped together at the last minute so that the flyers had somewhere kinda-sorta-almost authentic to direct people to. Either way, we&apos;ve contacted the group for any other information about the prank. </p>

<p>Kris Kringle, a spokesperson for SantaCon, responded to the flyers as well, writing in an email: &quot;Thoughts from those of us sitting in a production meeting right now: </p>

<ul>
	<li>Santa respects the right to all free speech, which of course includes creative public art (as well as snarky online publications)</li>
	<li>We aren&apos;t sure Santa believes random signs on utility poles whilst ignoring our website &amp; Twitter feed</li>
	<li>Good luck with that</li>
	<li>There are always two sides&quot;</li>
</ul>

<p>Anyway, SantaCon kicks off Saturday morning. Check their Twitter for updated info about the places to visit/avoid.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: A member of NYCR, the group who posted the flyers, explained to us that they have reached out to SantaCon to ask them to stop, but plan on protesting tomorrow if they do not cancel the event. Which will certainly lead to some sensible discourse with already-drunk Santas, we imagine. </p>

<p>&quot;Our country feels so divided right now that we are all searching for things that unify us,&quot; their spokesperson said. &quot;The one thing that I have found that we all have in common is our disdain for SantaCon. Over the past few years myself and others have witnessed several horrible acts including but not limited to; sex acts in aisle 4 of the Duane Reade on 14th and 3rd, countless fist fights, and excessive vomiting.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We have reached out to organizers and asked them to cancel but have not heard back,&quot; they continued. &quot;We hope they will come to their senses. We hope the organizers hear us loud and clear and are aware that we will be out in force tomorrow to stop SantaCon if they don&apos;t cancel.&quot;</p>

<p>They add that anyone interested in spending their Saturday aiding their crusade should meet up at noon Saturday at Bar 13. &quot;We want to make it clear to the young people out there that this is not just a bunch of 40 and 50 year olds and we have several people under the age of 35 planning on participating.&quot; </p>
