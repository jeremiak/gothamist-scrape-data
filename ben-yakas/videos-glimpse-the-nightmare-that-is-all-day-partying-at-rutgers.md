It&apos;s the all-day spring bash that rose from the ashes of Rutgersfest (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150609024227/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/20/shootings_after_snookis_rutgersfest.php">which was permanently cancelled</a> in 2011 after several shootings and Snooki sightings) like a phoenix with a beer bong strapped to its wings. Below, you can check out several videos and vines of the nightmare partying. Or as sophomore Cortney Ludmer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150609024227/http://www.nj.com/middlesex/index.ssf/2013/04/large_disturbance_reported_in.html#incart_river_default">told the Star-Ledger</a>: &quot;It&apos;s college. Live a little.&quot; Just, you know, don&apos;t get set on fire in the process.</p>

<p>Things got so messy, riot police were called in to break up the crowds. &#x201C;Some of the people acted in defiance of police&#x201D; called to disperse the crowd of students, said police Capt. J.T. Miller, explaining why cops started pepper spraying kids. &quot;We were walking home and bam!&quot; said Ludmer. &quot;It looked like a fire extinguisher.&quot; As for the couch burning, well, it gets cold at night, ya know: &quot;It was seven parties that got out of control,&quot; sophomore Gina Pagliaro explained helpfully.</p>
