Building manager John Russo told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111225204518/http://carrollgardens.patch.com/articles/late-night-fire-at-ps-29-destroys-new-playground#c">Carrol Gardens Patch</a> he was planning to call the contractor who built the playground to see if any of it was salvageable. &quot;<strong>This is just heartbreaking. We haven&apos;t even finished painting yet,</strong>&quot; said parent Lisa Trollb&#xE4;ck.<p></p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111225204518/http://bococaland.com/blog/2011/05/08/fire-burns-brand-new-ps-29-playground-in-cobble-hill/">Bococa Land</a>, someone was parking their car outside the playground last night around 12:30 a.m. and &quot;saw 20 ft flames emanating from the schoolyard. They called the fire department and the police are now investigating.&quot; Carroll Gardens Patch adds that according to an e-mail circulated by the school PTA, there was also vandalism around the school. You can see more photos of the damaged playground, including melted slides and burnt pavement, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111225204518/http://carrollgardens.patch.com/articles/late-night-fire-at-ps-29-destroys-new-playground#photo-5973619">here</a>.</p>
