title: Buck Showalter Calls Out Derek Jeter For His Dramatic Acting
---

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="32411jeter.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110329130821im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/32411jeter.jpg" width="250" height="343" class="image-left"> </span>Former <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110329130821/http://gothamist.com/tags/yankees">Yankees</a> manager Buck Showalter is the new manager of division rivals the Baltimore Orioles, and he&apos;s wasting no time stoking the fires of competition. In an interview in the April edition of Men&apos;s Journal, he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110329130821/http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/spring2011/news/story?id=6252444">rips into</a> both the Red Sox and the Yankees, and in particular, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110329130821/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/17/does_anybody_really_think_derek_jet.php">greatest NY athlete</a> Derek Jeter. &quot;The first time we went to Yankee Stadium, I screamed at Derek Jeter from the dugout. Our guys are thinking, &apos;Wow, he&apos;s screaming at Derek Jeter.&apos; <strong>Well, he&apos;s always jumping back from balls just off the plate. I know how many calls that team gets -- and yes, he [ticks] me off.</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>Showalter is essentially accusing Jeter of playacting, publicly calling him out for being overdramatic to get some close calls in his favor. But it&apos;s something which is incredibly common in all sports, let alone baseball. Just earlier this week, Big Baby Glenn Davis <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110329130821/http://deadspin.com/#!5784370/ray-allen-carmelo-anthony-go-down-bloodied-big-baby-davis-just-pretends">took an elbow</a> to the face against the Knicks, and proceeded to flop onto the ground like a beached whale; as Walt Clyde Frazier puts it, he truly has &quot;aspirations of Hollywood.&quot; In soccer, it&apos;s such a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110329130821/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/21/sports/soccer/21diving.html">common occurrence</a>, it has even spawned its own subculture on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110329130821/http://www.slate.com/id/2144625/9">&quot;taking a dive.&quot;</a> </p>

<p>Below, you can see one such example of Jeter exaggerating his injuries. In a game last season against the Rays, he is seemingly hit by a pitch, and awarded first base...even though on replay, you can clearly see that he wasn&apos;t actually hit by the pitch:</p>
