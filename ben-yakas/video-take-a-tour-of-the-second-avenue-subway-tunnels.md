<p>Every few months, we like to check the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507075204/https://www.flickr.com/photos/mtaphotos/">MTA&apos;s Flickr</a> to check the progress of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507075204/http://gothamist.com/tags/secondavenuesubway">Second Avenue Subway</a> line, which has been under construction for approximately 400 years and is expected to be completed in December 2016, give or take other more immediate <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507075204/http://gothamist.com/tags/mta">MTA projects</a> getting in the way. </p>
