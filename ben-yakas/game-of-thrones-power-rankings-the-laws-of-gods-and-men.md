This week, Reek got an assignment, Stannis got some cash, and Tyrion went on trial. GOT is all about how people jockey for power, so click through for our season 4 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504233436/http://gothamist.com/tags/gameofthronespowerrankings">Game of Thrones Power Rankings.</a></p>

<p><strong>Game Of Thrones Power Rankings, Week 6:</strong></p>

<p><strong>1. Thespian Peter Dinklage:</strong> &quot;I did not do it. I did not kill Joffrey, but I wish that I had. Watching your vicious bastard die gave me more relief than a thousand lying whores.&quot; Tyrion, who has been the moral center of GOT ever since Ned Stark&apos;s Manbun was cruelly severed from his torso, has been sidelined for much of season four awaiting trial for a crime he didn&apos;t commit. And although the future for our favorite wine-gobbler is looking decidedly grim&#x2014;even if he does survive the trial-by-combat with a champion, he has severed ties with all his former allies and lovers, except maybe Jaime&#x2014;this was a landmark episode for Dinklage. Call it a symbolic gesture handing him the top spot on the rankings, but the last 20 minutes of the episode were his finest work on the show yet. </p>

<p><strong>2. The Iron Bank Of Braavos:</strong> We finally put a face to the most powerful (and coldly capitalistic) people in the Known World, the pursestrings backing the most powerful person in Westeros. And this is the face (and belly) we got:</p>

<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="//web.archive.org/web/20150504233436if_/http://www.youtube.com/embed/SwpC8_3OkxQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p><strong>3. Tywin Lannister:</strong> The smug smile after Jaime agrees to leave the Kingsguard, go forth, and procreate with someone (who isn&apos;t already a blood relation) tells the story. It seems Tywin was always banking on killing a few birds with one kangaroo court, because Tywin is always a few steps ahead of everyone else in King&apos;s Landing. But as has been a theme this season, man plans and the Gods laugh&#x2014;the mighty Tywin has blind spots like everyone else in the kingdom, including underestimating his younger son (and Stannis Baratheon). </p>

<p><strong>4. Daenerys Targaryen</strong>: Do you think that Missandei introduces Dany with all <em>eight</em> titles to every single subject who comes before her? Aren&apos;t there 212 waiting supplicants outside? Maybe this is a little inefficient use of your time? </p>

<p><strong>5. Red Viper/Prince Oberyn Martell:</strong> Oberyn has been one of the best additions to the cast this season, a vivacious man as driven by hatred as he is by lust&#x2014;a characteristic that, based on his wonderful getting-to-know-you chat with Varys this episode, may ultimately prove his undoing. There&apos;s no time for Oberyn and Varys to kick back at the brothel with some goblets for now however. He&apos;s so very curious about everybody&apos;s motivations at the trial, he almost comes across as innocent (at least compared to the Lannister clan). And he&apos;s become the one true wild card this season; it&apos;s as easy to imagine him coming to the defense of Tyrion as it is him getting used to an uncomfortable detente with Tywin.</p>

<p><strong>6. Cersei Lannister&apos;s Smug Sense Of Satisfaction:</strong> This is what it feels like when all your scheming and manipulations come to fruition! </p>

<p><strong>7. Tyrion Lannister:</strong> This feels right. Sure, things have never been more grim: his allies have betrayed him (Varys), his father has used him as a pawn to manipulate his brother, the people he saved at the battle of Blackwater have turned on him, and worst of all, his lover has destroyed him. But him reaching his limit has been a long time coming, and he unleashed an operatic (and brutally honest) takedown of the court. Tyrion is a survivor, and despite his precarious position, he&apos;s taken his fate back into his hands by demanding a trial-by-combat (yet again: remember, this is how he met Ser Bronn in season one at the Eyrie). </p>

<p>At the very least, he&apos;s put his father over a barrel: </p>

<p><strong>8. Ser Davos&apos; Noble Charm:</strong> Marvel as he utilizes the powers of logic, friendship and loyalty to make an incredibly dour and uninspiring man seem like the only sane person in the seven kingdoms.</p>

<p><strong>9. Stannis Baratheon&apos;s Unwavering Grim Demeanor:</strong> He technically should have the edge on Davos&#x2014;what with him being the rightful heir to the Throne and procuring the finances to back his claim finally&#x2014;but Stannis personifies the word <em>drip</em>.</p>

<p><strong>10. The Westeros Justice System Leaves Some Room For Improvement:</strong> Unless your name is Cersei (or Mace Tyrell, bless his ignorant oafish heart), you probably know for a fact that Tyrion didn&apos;t kill Joffrey. But hey, Tywin&apos;s hands are tied! Everyone is lying so convincingly! Rules <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504233436/http://www.vulture.com/2014/05/explainer-the-game-of-thrones-justice-system-tyrion-trial.html">are confusing</a>! </p>

<p><strong>11. The Sinking Feeling That Ramsay Snow Isn&apos;t Going Anywhere, Is He? We&apos;re Just Going To Be Stuck With Creepy Bug-Eyed Sex Scenes &amp; Psychological Torture For 3-4 More Seasons, And Then When He Does Finally Leave This Mortal Coil, It&apos;ll Be Something Underwhelming, Of Course It Will Be, We&apos;ll Be Lucky To Get A Freak Accident Which No One Sees Coming:</strong> He&apos;s only been in two episodes this season, but that&apos;s two more episodes than Mance Rayder, the Brotherhood Without Banners, and poor, dearly forgotten Rickon. There truly is no justice in Westeros.</p>

<p><strong>12. Jaime Lannister:</strong> Noble Jaime returned this episode, sacrificing his own career to try to save his little brother. He offered a lot of intense reactions shots as he realized what a farce Tyrion&apos;s trial had become&#x2014;but we were more distracted imagining a spinoff (<em>The Kingslayer Brothers</em>) in which Jaime and Tyrion leave their kooky family behind, relocate to Miami, and open <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504233436/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Golden_Palace">their own hotel</a> alongside Don Cheadle and Cheech Marin. </p>

<p><strong>13. Yara Greyjoy:</strong> It was a mostly depressing reunion between Yara and her little brother Theon, highlighted by him literally biting her hand. Who knows if and when we&apos;ll even see her again (unless Ramsay&apos;s plan is to use Reek to take the Iron Islands).</p>

<p><strong>14. Margaery Tyrell&apos;s Conscience:</strong> The camera cuts to her about seven instances during the trial, and each time you can see her brow pinching ever tighter.</p>

<p>15. <strong>The Dawning Realization That The Days Of Happy-Go-Lucky, Whore-Loving, Slappy Tyrion Are Long Behind Us:</strong> RIP Pimp.</p>

<center><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504233436im_/http://s.mlkshk.com/r/YXYR" width="250"></center>

<p><strong>The Viserys Targaryen Memorial Least Powerful Person Of The Week Award:</strong> Even though he happily accepted Dany&apos;s pay-off and wiped the goat blood from his hands (he tripled his investment!), the <strong>Unnamed Goat Herder Of Mereen (Who Also Could Represent All The Common Folks Living Under Daenerys Rule)</strong> is still living on borrowed time. He, and all the other subjects, have no real power in the face of dragons who literally scorch the Earth when they want a snack. Sure, Dany isn&apos;t actively looking to kill anyone right now (give or take a few Masters), but the point is that the farmers and the city workers have no control over their lives. One day you&apos;re tossing stones at goats, the next you&apos;re a pile of bones being presented to the Mother Of Dragons in a giant alternate-universe pyramid.</p>

<p><strong>The Ser Pounce Memorial Most Powerful Pet Of The Week Award:</strong> Uh, sorry about this <strong>Reek</strong>. You don&apos;t even rate as a Viserys anymore&#x2014;you&apos;re just a surprisingly upright version of Bertie, the owl <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504233436/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2573334/Meet-Bertie-owl-afraid-going-outside-loves-helping-owner-make-cup-tea.html">who is afraid to go outside</a>. On the plus side, you do still have <em>excellent</em> grammar (&quot;pretend to be whom?&quot;).</p>

<p><strong>The Hodoriffic Honorary Minor Character Of The Week Award:</strong> Any week there is a swashbuckling, joke-mangling pirate entertaining two naked women in an oversized jacuzzi, he&apos;s going to win. <strong>Salladhor Saan</strong> all the way, and he didn&apos;t even have to wear a puffy shirt!</p>

<p><strong>The Lord Oaf Of Highgarden Oafiest Moment Of The Night:</strong> <strong>Mace Tyrell</strong> has been nothing but a joy ever since he was first dismissively mentioned by his mother, the Queen of Thorns, in season three. He&apos;s mostly lurked on the very edge of the margins of the story since he arrived in King&apos;s Landing to start the season, but he&apos;s making the most of everything he gets. In this episode, that includes becoming Tywin&apos;s lapdog at the Small Council meeting and praising Cersei for her &quot;courage.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Does Everybody In The Known World Know That Joffrey Baratheon Was The Product Of Incest?</strong> Let&apos;s see...Jamie, Cersei, Tyrion, Tywin, The Tyrells, Ned Stark&apos;s Manbun, the Boltons, Littlefinger, Varys, Varys&apos; little birds, Pycelle, Oberyn and everyone at the trial, everyone in King&apos;s Landing has heard the &quot;rumors,&quot; The Iron Bank Of Braavos, probably all of Braavos, so...let&apos;s assume yes. </p>

<p><strong>Rickon Watch 2014: Is Rickon Still On This Show?</strong> As Belle and Sebastian <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504233436/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXAbar6PzRA&amp;feature=kp">once sang</a>: &quot;I feel like dancing on my own/ Where no one knows me, and where I/ Can cause offense just by the way I look.&quot;</p>

<center><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504233436im_/http://s.mlkshk.com/r/YXQV" width="300"></center>  

<p><strong>The Remember Roz Sexposition Quotient:</strong> It was hard to miss this episode&apos;s two nude-friendly scenes, since they came one after the other: first there was Salladhor Saan&apos;s jacuzzi party; then there was the decidedly less fun sight of bug-eyed Ramsay rubbing his spinnerets with his psychotic lover. Not enough Red Viper/Ellaria Sand action though.</p>

<p><strong>Way Beyond The Wall:</strong> Like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504233436/http://gothamist.com/2014/04/13/game_of_thrones_power_rankings_the_2.php">Joffrey&apos;s wedding/death earlier this season</a>, we spent the entire second half of the episode in King&apos;s Landing for the trial, which means we missed out on seeing Jon Snow&apos;s Burgeoning Sense Of Leadership blossom even more (alongside the rest of the Knight&apos;s Watch), Queen of Thorns/Olenna Tyrell, Ser Bronn, Arya + The Hound, Brienne + Pod, Sansa Stark, Littlefinger, Breastfeeding Poster Child Robin Arryn (and Breastfeeding Advocate Lysa Arryn), Bran Stark (along with Hodor/Jojen Reed/Meera Reed), the Thenns, the White Walkers, and the Wildings (Ygritte). As has been their wont, The Brotherhood Without Banners and Mance Rayder were nowhere to be seen.</p>

<p>Until we find out who will be champion for (and against) Tyrion, go ahead and learn how to play the GOT theme song from the comfort of your kitchen:</p>
