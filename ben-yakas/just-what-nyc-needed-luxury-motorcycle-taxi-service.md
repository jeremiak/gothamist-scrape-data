Are limos too much of a hassle? Are buses too crowded, and subways too dirty? Is the idea of riding a bike tantamount to slicing off a finger? Then we have just the perfect transportation for you: Motorcycle Taxis. <p></p>

<p>Starting next month, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150923193727/http://www.motolimos.com/index.html">Moto Limos Club</a> will be opening up the first motorcycle chauffeur and transport service in America, in both NY and LA initially. The fleet will include 15 2012 Honda Goldwing motorcycles, along with a bunch of Bombardier Can Am Spyder motor-tricycles &quot;if the prospect of a two-wheeled taxi scares you.&quot; Because of people&apos;s apprehension about motorcycles, the company said they would only hire riders with 15 or more years of professional experience. The company is targeting an upscale clientele, so memberships range from $125 to $250 to start, and bike rentals are a maximum of $90 an hour for the Goldwing. But here&apos;s the best part, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150923193727/http://www.autoblog.com/2011/04/15/first-motorcycle-taxi-service-headed-for-los-angeles-and-new-yor/">from Autoblog</a>:</p>

<blockquote>Since the club is aimed at businesspeople,<strong> passengers will be provided a Bluetooth-equipped helmet for conference calls on the go.</strong> When the weather turns nasty, Moto Limos Club has all-weather gear to fit over your fancy duds and keep them high and dry, and when it&apos;s freezing, the club promises to provide passengers with a thick blanket to keep the chill at bay.</blockquote>

<p>Let us repeat: Bluetooth-equipped helmets for conference calls on the go. A perfect compliment for that exhaust smell you&apos;ll be carrying around with you all day!</p>
