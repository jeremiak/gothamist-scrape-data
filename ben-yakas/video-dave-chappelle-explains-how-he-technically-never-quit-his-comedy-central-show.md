<p>On the eve of his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509173212/http://gothamist.com/2014/03/28/dave_chappelle_coming_to_radio_city.php">big headlining show</a> at Radio City Music Hall, comedian <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509173212/http://gothamist.com/tags/davechappelle">Dave Chappelle</a> appeared on The Late Show with David Letterman last night, making it his first late night appearance in over a decade. After some chitchat about the ups and downs of being a working comedian as well as a &quot;baby-making machine,&quot; Letterman brought up the elephant in the room that is his beloved Comedy Central show. And despite the fact he clearly hates talking about the subject, Chappelle plowed through the tension and answered Letterman&apos;s questions as best he could: &quot;Technically I never quit. I&apos;m seven years late for work.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It&apos;s like getting divorced in the &apos;50s,&quot; Chappelle, who previously gave television interviews to a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509173212/http://minnesota.cbslocal.com/2013/11/14/one-on-one-with-dave-chappelle/">Minneapolis television station</a>, a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509173212/http://www.okayplayer.com/news/video-dave-chappelle-first-interview-in-5-years.html">San Francisco radio station</a>, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509173212/http://www.guavaleaf.com/video/21681/Dave-Chappelle--Inside-The-Actors-Studio">James Lipton</a>, added. &quot;People didn&apos;t go to Divorce Court, they just looked at their wife like, &apos;Baby I&apos;m gonna go get a pack of cigarettes, I&apos;ll be right back.&apos; And then they just leave with the clothes on their back and make a go of it.&quot; You can watch the whole segment (while it&apos;s still up) below: </p>

<p>Chappelle concluded that he thinks he&apos;s a happier person now, but acknowledges that it&apos;s complicated: &quot;I don&apos;t know. There&apos;s no way of knowing. But sometimes I listen to a Jay Z record and it starts to make me feel bad about some of the choices I made. This guy&apos;s had more fun in two songs than I&apos;ve had in the last 11 years.&quot;</p>
