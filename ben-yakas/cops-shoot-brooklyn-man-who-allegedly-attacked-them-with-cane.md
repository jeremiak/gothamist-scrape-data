<p>Police shot a man in Brooklyn today who they say attacked them with a cane. The incident occurred on Broadway and Lewis Avenue under the elevated subway tracks in Bedford-Stuyvesant around 10:30 a.m. this morning. Cops say a 27-year-old man, whose name hasn&apos;t been released yet, started hitting an empty marked police car with his cane.</p>

<p>Two transit cops at the station heard the commotion, and confronted the man. The man allegedly broke his cane over the female cop&#x2019;s head, and her partner shot him once in the shoulder. &#x201C;The guy fell down right on the floor&#x200E;. We thought he was dead,&#x201D; witness Luis Acevedo <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140301085019/http://nypost.com/2013/12/07/cops-shoot-man-swinging-cane-at-cop-car/">told the Post.</a></p>

<p>The man was apparently so enraged, witnesses say he later jumped out of the ambulance as EMTs tried to treat him. &#x201C;It was crazy,&#x201D; said Wilbert Maclin <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140301085019/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/cops-shoot-emotionally-disturbed-man-attacks-police-car-officer-cane-article-1.1540787">told the News</a>. &#x201C;I saw them put him in the ambulance. He was on the stretcher and he got out of the ambulance &#x2014; about 20 cops jumped him.&#x201D;</p>
