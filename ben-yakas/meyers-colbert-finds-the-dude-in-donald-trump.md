<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170401101053/http://gothamist.com/tags/stephencolbert">Stephen Colbert&apos;s</a> Figure-It-Out-A-Tron has become one of his best bits on <em>Late Show</em>, a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170401101053/http://gothamist.com/2017/03/07/colbert_trump_russia_p_ee.php">reliably funny visual gag</a> that always ends up in a much dirtier (and meaner) place than could be expressed with mere words. He broke it out last night to &quot;visually express&quot; Trump&apos;s relationship with his newest latest congressional minion, House Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes, who looks like a &quot;car salesman who really needs you to help him out here.&quot;</p>

<p>In another inspired bit in the segment above, Colbert also used Tom Clancy novels to explain Trump&apos;s ties to Russia: &quot;The <em>Commander in Chief</em> is reaching the <em>Breaking Point</em>,&quot; Colbert said as books were tossed to him. &quot;Because Trump&apos;s administration is <em>Under Fire</em> for a possible <em>Call to Treason</em>, putting us in <em>Clear and Present Danger</em>, <em>Without Remorse</em>, which is why I&apos;m experiencing <em>The Sum of All Fears</em>.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170401101053/http://gothamist.com/tags/sethmeyers">Seth Meyers</a> also tried to parse Nunes&apos;s uncomfortably friendly and protective relationship with Trump: &quot;Nunes has been running around D.C. like he&#x2019;s James Bond just find out where Trump had dinner.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Democrats have called for the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee to recuse himself from the investigation into Russia&#x2019;s election-related hacking over concerns that he is too close to President Trump to be impartial,&quot; Meyers said. &quot;They want Congress to appoint someone less close to Trump, like Melania.&quot;</p>

<p>He also ended up drawing an unlikely but compelling comparison between Trump and....<em>The Big Lebowski</em>. &quot;Now that you think about it, The Dude and Trump have a lot in common,&quot; he said. &quot;They both had the afros, both obsessed with their rugs, and they both love white Russians.&quot;</p>

<p>And over at The Daily Show, Trevor Noah and Roy Wood Jr. figured out a way to keep Meals on Wheels alive: militarize it. &quot;No mission&#x2019;s going to be perfect,&quot; Wood Jr said. &quot;You have your good days and your bad. But you wake up the next day, you strap up your boots, and you keep tricking the president into thinking that you&#x2019;re part of the military.&quot;</p>
