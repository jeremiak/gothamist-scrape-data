Suing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120605172158/http://gothamist.com/tags/facebook">Facebook</a> for a billion dollars. Facebook and founder Mark Zuckerberg are being <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120605172158/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/2011/04/02/2011-04-02_facebook_and_cofounder_mark_zuckerberg_sued_for_1_billion_over_3rd_intifada_page.html">sued</a> for more than $1 billion over a controversial page that called for a &quot;Third Palestinian Intifada&quot;. It&apos;s the perfect storm of Jews, Muslims, Facebook, and complicated lawsuits!<p></p>

<p>American attorney and activist Larry Klayman, a former Justice Department prosecutor and founder of the conservative public interest group Judicial Watch, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120605172158/http://techcrunch.com/2011/04/01/facebook-zuckerberg-sued-for-1-billion-after-not-removing-a-page-fast-enough/">claims that</a> it took Facebook too long to take down the controversial page calling for violence against Jews. He also claims that the site purposefully kept it up in order to &quot;further their revues and the net worth of the company.&quot; Klayman alleges that the page, which was removed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120605172158/http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-03-29/facebook-removes-page-calling-for-new-palestinian-intifada-against-israel.html">last week</a>,  was only &#x201C;begrudgingly&#x201D; taken down; Facebook says the page initially called for peaceful protest, but was taken down because it indeed descended into &#x201C;direct calls for violence&#x201D; in violation of its policies.</p>

<p>On the page, Palestinians were urged to riot on the streets after Friday prayers on May 15 this year, and commence an uprising in the vein of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120605172158/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Intifada">first</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120605172158/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Intifada">two</a> intifadas: &#x201C;Judgment Day will be brought upon us only once the Muslims have killed all of the Jews.&quot; The page garnered more than 340,000 &quot;likes&quot; while it was up.</p>

<p>Klayman says in the lawsuit that he&apos;s a target now, and he fears for his life since he&#x2019;s been &#x201C;called a Zionist publicly by radical Palestinians and other such Arabic interests.&#x201D; Klayman also brings that damn movie into this: &quot;Apparently, the ethically compromised Zuckerberg has no conscience or sense of right or wrong, as depicted recently in the award winning film &#x201C;Social Network.&quot; As TechCrunch <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120605172158/http://techcrunch.com/2011/04/01/facebook-zuckerberg-sued-for-1-billion-after-not-removing-a-page-fast-enough/">points out</a>, Klayman has sued some pretty big names in the past, including Hillary Clinton, Dick Cheney, Venezuela President Hugo Chavez, the Ground Zero Mosque and the Federal Reserve and the Department of the Treasury. Slate, who wrote an article on him over a decade ago, adds that Klayman also once <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120605172158/http://www.slate.com/id/2317/">sued his mother</a>.</p>
