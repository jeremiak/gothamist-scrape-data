<p>The assault of a woman by a group of teens in Prospect Park was captured on video as bystanders stood and watched. As you can see in the video, which was initially posted to Facebook, three teen girls walk up to the woman, who is sitting on a bench near the Windsor Terrace area. As they start punching, slapping and kicking her, other teens gather and cheer them on.</p>

What we are asking for is the victim, we are asking her to come forward because we need to get these people off the street. And get them the counseling or whatever it is they need. So they won&#x2019;t do this to somebody else. They thought it was fun to kick them literally in their face and laugh about it.&quot;</p>

<p>Police had no other information about the assault, but said they were investigating it. This incident comes on the heels of an incident in which a NJ woman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503001016/http://gothamist.com/2014/06/26/video_adults_stand_by_as_nj_mom_is.php">was caught on video viciously beating another woman</a> in front of her 2-year-old child as bystanders watched.</p>

<p>Anyone with information in regards to this incident can call Crime Stoppers at 1-800-577-TIPS (8477). The public can also submit their tips by logging onto the <a href="WWW.NYPDCRIMESTOPPERS.COM">Crime Stoppers website</a> or by texting their tips to 274637 (CRIMES) then enter TIP577.</p>
