<p>As <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503231331/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/24/breast_is_still_best_national_go_to.php">we warned you</a>, today is National Go Topless Day, a celebration of women&apos;s legal right to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503231331/http://gothamist.com/tags/topless">bare their breasts in public</a>. Topless women and men will be hanging out in Bryant Park and Times Square all afternoon to spread awareness about women&apos;s rights. Unfortunately, the event also inspires gawpers and creeps to come out of the woodwork and do what they do best: gawp and creep (and um, dress up as Uncle Sam). Check out some NSFW photos and tweets about the event so far below, and we&apos;ll have a full recap of the event later.</p>
