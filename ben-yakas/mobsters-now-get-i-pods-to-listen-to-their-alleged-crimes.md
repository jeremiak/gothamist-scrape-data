<p>Reason #73 why being a mobster is the best criminal profession: you can now get your own specifically-tailored iPod in jail! Albeit, you won&apos;t be able to listen to Tony Bennett or Frank Sinatra with it, but you will be able to listen to the government&apos;s audio evidence against you from behind bars. </p>

<p>Thomas &quot;Tommy Shots&quot; Gioeli, alleged boss of the Colombo family and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150215053504/http://gothamist.com/tags/thomastommyshotsgioeli">frequent kvetcher</a>, and Joel &quot;Joe Waverly&quot; Cacace, the family&apos;s consigliere, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150215053504/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/mob_pod_father_Y7tfEtB72Dgi8gJE83AK9K?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">both received</a> the special iPods, which cost $950 each, with hours of FBI wire tap recordings included. Since anyone charged with a crime has the right to examine prosecutor&apos;s evidence against them to prep for trial, the idea of the iPod, suggested by Gioeli&apos;s lawyer, is to speed up that process. Maybe they could throw them a bone and include <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150215053504/http://gothamist.com/2010/10/05/forget_where_mafia_hit_happened_the.php">Mafia Maps</a> in the deal. </p>
