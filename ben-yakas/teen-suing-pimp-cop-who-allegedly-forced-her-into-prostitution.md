<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:200px; "> <img alt="101211pimp.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130619014605im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/101211pimp.jpg" width="200" height="299"> <br> <i>Wayne Taylor</i></div> A teen girl <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130619014605/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/girl_sues_corrupt_cop_for_allegedly_eMCgOIZ2lRAZZNHQaqL9nK?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">is suing the city</a> claiming that a rogue NYPD detective forced her into prostitution when she was 13-years-old. The teen, who is still a minor, and her mother have filed a $25 million lawsuit against the city, the NYPD, and Wayne Taylor, a former city narcotics detective who she says &quot;bought&quot; her and pimped her out.<p></p>

<p>In the suit, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130619014605/http://articles.nydailynews.com/2008-02-14/news/17891572_1_nypd-detective-innocence-answer-charges">the girl alleges Taylor told her</a> that she had been &#x201C;sold&#x201D; to him for $500&#x2014;she was allegedly ordered to tell patrons she was 19, dance naked at parties, and charge up to $80 for sex. She says that if she didn&apos;t follow his directions, Taylor and his girlfriend threatened to either beat or arrest the girl. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130619014605/http://gothamist.com/2008/01/31/cop_and_girlfri.php">girl was held in</a> the home of Taylor and his girlfriend, Zelika Brown, in Jamaica, Queens between January 10 and January 27, 2008, until they &quot;sold&quot; her to another pimp on Long Island&#x2014;she was able to escape from there, and contact the police with her story.</p>

<p>Taylor ended up pleading guilty to attempted kidnapping and served three-and-a-half years in prison before he was paroled in January. Despite the fact that the NYPD were aware of the fact Taylor was involved in illegal activities, the girl&#x2019;s attorney, Robert Tolchin, said they nevertheless kept him on the streets. &#x201C;How do you keep this guy on the job with a shield and a gun and assigned to the narcotics bureau when he has an unresolved petition for for promoting prostitution?&#x201D; the Brooklyn attorney asked.</p>

<p>In 2008, Taylor <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130619014605/http://articles.nydailynews.com/2008-02-14/news/17891572_1_nypd-detective-innocence-answer-charges">spoke to the Daily News</a> shortly before he was found guilty, and defended himself vigorously: &quot;I am 100% innocent of all the charges and all that will come out in court. I guarantee you if I spoke my heart out and told you all the facts, you would walk out here with a totally different outlook.&quot;</p>
