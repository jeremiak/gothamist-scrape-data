<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405030351/http://gothamist.com/tags/amandabynes">Amanda Bynes</a> has allegedly been on a bong-smashing tear over the last 72 hours ever since she was arrested for throwing a bong out the window of her apartment. This morning, Bynes took to Twitter <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405030351/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/25/_view_more_videos_at.php#photo-1">to defend herself</a>, claiming &quot;I only smoke tobacco I don&apos;t drink or do drugs. I&apos;ve never had a bong in my life!&quot; But she has now made some very serious accusations against the NYPD, claiming that an officer sexually harassed her: &quot;He slapped my vagina. Sexual harassment. Big deal.&quot;</p>

<p>Here&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405030351/http://twitpl.us/t/FdV">what she tweeted</a>:</p>

<blockquote>Don&apos;t believe the reports about me being arrested. It&apos;s all lies. I was sexually harassed by one of the cops the night before last which is who then arrested me. He lied and said I threw a bong out the window when I opened the window for fresh air. Hilarious. He slapped my vagina. Sexual harassment. Big deal. I then called the cops on him. He handcuffed me, which I resisted, quite unlike any of the reports stated. Then I was sent to a mental hospital. Offensive. I kept asking for my lawyer but they wouldn&apos;t let me. The cops were creepy. The cop sexually harassed me, they found no pot on me or bong outside my window. That&apos;s why the judge let me go. Don&apos;t believe any reports.</blockquote>

<p>Bynes is no stranger to <a href="o bong was recovered on the sidewalk following her arrest.">tweets about her vagina</a>, but this is the first of any such harassment accusation that she&apos;s made since her arrest Thursday night. According <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405030351/http://www.tmz.com/2013/05/25/amanda-bynes-twitter-sexual-haassment/">to TMZ</a>, Bynes&apos; attorney mentioned yesterday that Bynes was seeking to file a complaint against the NYPD for &quot;inappropriate actions&quot; by the department, but made no specific claims.</p>

<p>Bynes insisted in court that she didn&apos;t throw a bong&#x2014;she told the judge it was a vase. However, in the criminal complaint, the police officer stated, &quot;I observed defendant open the door. And saw a bong on the kitchen counter. When I asked defendant about said bong, and while wearing full police uniform, I observed defendant grab said bong, run to the westbound-facing window, and throw it out the window.&quot; But no bong was recovered on the sidewalk following her arrest.</p>
