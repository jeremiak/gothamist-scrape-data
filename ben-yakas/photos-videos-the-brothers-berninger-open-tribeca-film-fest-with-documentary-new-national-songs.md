Throughout the film, metal fan Tom has complained about the band being too &quot;coffeehouse;&quot; instead of Jack-and-Coke fueled bacchanalias&#x2014;Tom was stuck with lots of footage of people on laptops.</p>

<p>The moment encapsulates Tom&apos;s aimless sadness; it also points to his often hilarious, admiringly-pious belief in keeping things <em>real</em>. And it&apos;s that very quality&#x2014;his ability to eventually look himself in the mirror and admit what a fuck-up he has been&#x2014;that ultimately led to him completing his first feature-length documentary. And making it a damn good one at that.</p>

<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502142103if_/http://www.youtube.com/embed/FUjBue7XggQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502142103/http://gothamist.com/tags/tff2013">Tribeca Film Festival</a> opened last night with the world premiere of that movie: it&apos;s part-backstage rock doc, a glimpse into the everyday happenings of one of the most famous indie rock bands on their biggest tour ever. But even more so, it&apos;s the story of how Tom confronts living in the shadow of his much more successful &quot;golden boy&quot; older brother, lead singer Matt Berninger. </p>

<p>There&apos;s only a handful of concert footage included in the film (make sure you stay till the end though, or else you&apos;ll miss goosebump-inducing video of the band performing &quot;Terrible Love&quot; at BAM in 2010 with Tom doing his darndest to follow Matt as he gallops across the venue), and halfway through the film, Tom is fired from his job as a roadie. The last third of the film just concerns whether Tom can overcome his own low expectations and actually assemble a final product. The support of Matt and his wife Carin Besser, who let Tom move into their daughter&apos;s playroom in order to complete the film, can&apos;t be underestimated.</p>

<p>It&apos;s not much of a spoiler to say that he is able to pull it together&#x2014;having your first major film introduced by Robert DeNiro and Richard Belzer is a credit to that. The film may use The National and the tour as more of a backdrop/jumping off point for an exploration of siblings, but Tom is able to key into the same intimate, bruised tone as their music does. If you&apos;re a National fan, you&apos;ll definitely want to see this; but even if you&apos;re not, this unique documentary speaks to the dynamics of family relationships with candor and humor that never dips into the maudlin or sentimental.</p>

<p>The night transitioned from the premiere to the Highline Ballroom for an afterparty with The National performing a tight 10-song set. Four new songs from their upcoming album <em>Trouble Will Find Me</em> were played, including a propulsive, blistering version of new single &quot;Don&apos;t Swallow The Cap&quot; (or &quot;Don&apos;t Swallow The Crap,&quot; as Matt noted someone on their website&apos;s forum called it), the multi-sectioned rocker (one of the more agressive songs they&apos;ve produced in recent years) &quot;Sea Of Love,&quot; and the beautiful, lilting &quot;I Should Live In Salt,&quot; which Matt revealed was written about Tom (&quot;Don&apos;t make me read your mind, you should know me better than that&quot;).</p>

<p>The show started with a surprise version of &quot;O Holy Night,&quot; done in the style of Hatford, one of Matt&apos;s many tributes to his brother. And the evening ended with Matt again heading into the audience to perform &quot;Terrible Love&quot;&#x2014;only this time, he went looking for Tom, who hugged his legs as Matt screamed lyrics about walking with spiders.</p>
