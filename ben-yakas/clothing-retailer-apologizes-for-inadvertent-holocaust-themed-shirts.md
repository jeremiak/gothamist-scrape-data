<p>Urban Outfitters are no longer the only clothing retailer under fire <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408123835/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/20/urban_outfitters_offends_jewish_lea.php">for stupid sartorial Holocaust references</a>: fashion company Zara has gotten into an online brouhaha today over a striped children&#x2019;s shirt featuring an emblem that looks a whole lot like a yellow Star of David.</p>

<p>The shirt, which retailed for $79, was supposed to have a &quot;sheriff&quot; theme (it has since been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408123835/http://www.zara.com/se/sv/barn/baby-pojke-%25283-m%25C3%25A5nader---3-%25C3%25A5r%2529/tr%25C3%25B6jor/dubbelsidig-t-tr%25C3%25B6ja-%2522sheriff%2522-c271048p2096022.html">removed from the company&apos;s website</a>). After 972Mag <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408123835/http://972mag.com/zara-presents-a-striped-pyjama-with-a-yellow-star-for-your-child/96058/">shined a spotlight</a> on it, online furor grew over the similarity to the uniform Nazis made Jewish people wear during WWII.</p>

<p>&quot;The mentioned T-shirt is no longer on sale in our stores,&quot; the company said in a statement this morning. &quot;The design of the T-shirt was only inspired by the sheriff&#x2019;s stars from the Classic Western films, as the claim of the T-shirt says.&quot; People were particularly outraged because this isn&apos;t the first time Zara&apos;s has gotten in trouble for questionable taste: in 2007, they apologized and withdrew a handbag from stores after a customer pointed out <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408123835/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7002765.stm">that the design featured swastikas.</a></p>

<p>Anyway, at least the company can put this SNAFU behind them and not make it any worse&#x2014;oh wait. &quot;The item does not exist in Israel and as soon as the issue became clear, it was decided the product will be removed from shelves across the world and exterminated,&quot; a spokesman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408123835/http://tech.walla.co.il/?w=%2F4026%2F2780057&amp;m=1">said</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408123835/http://972mag.com/nstt_feeditem/zara-apologizes-says-yellow-star-shirts-will-be-exterminated/">according to 972 Mag.</a></p>
