<p>The four players <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408191705/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/pace_pass_ZKzeM0VzlgS8l7mnXxFlUL?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">were accused</a> of disrupting police efforts to crowd control on a rowdy night last October, when Henry was killed after the car he was driving hit two police officers at a Thornton, NY restaurant. &quot;Hopefully we&apos;ll go forward and get justice, [but] nothing will take away from the loss [of Henry]&quot; said Joseph Romanick, one of the players.</p>

<p>Last month, a Westchester grand jury <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408191705/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/15/no_indictment_in_fatal_police_shoot.php">declined</a> to bring charges against two police officers who shot and killed Henry. The lawyer for one of the officers, Aaron Hess, said at the time, &quot;Sometimes the truth is painful and in this case the painful truth is that D.J. Henry brought about his own death.&quot; Nevertheless, Romanick and the three other players, Yves Delpeche, Daniel Parker, Joseph Garcia, plan to sue for at least $1 million. The Henry family <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408191705/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/12/parents_of_slain_pace_student_plan.php">is planning</a> a $120 million lawsuit against the Pleasantville and Mount Pleasant police.</p>
