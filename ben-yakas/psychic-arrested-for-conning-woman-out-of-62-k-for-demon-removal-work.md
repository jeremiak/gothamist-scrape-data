<p>An Upper East Side fortune teller was arrested this weekend after she allegedly terrified and manipulated a distraught woman out of more than $60K. Among other things, the &quot;psychic&quot; convinced the woman she had a &quot;demon/evil spirit&quot; inside her that was a dead baby the victim&apos;s mother had miscarried before the victim was born&#x2014;and the only way to get it out was through increasingly expensive &quot;demon removal work.&quot;</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="91316psychic2.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021113945im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/91316psychic2.jpg" width="640" height="361"> <br> <i> (Courtesy Bob Nygaard)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>Starting in September 2013, the 35-year-old victim started seeing &quot;Psychic Lisa,&quot; a.k.a. 39-year-old Victoria Nicholes. The victim was experiencing marital difficulties at the time, and Nicholes allegedly convinced her that if she didn&apos;t get rid of the &quot;demon,&quot; the victim&apos;s husband would leave her for a younger woman whom the victim suspected he was having an affair with. If the &quot;demon&quot; wasn&apos;t removed, the victim would never be able to sustain another romantic relationship for the rest of her life.</p>

<p>According to private investigator Bob Nygaard, who has had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021113945/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/26/psychic_organized_crime_family_moth.php">plenty of experience</a> with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021113945/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/04/times_square_psychics_busted.php">similar fraud cases</a>, Nicholes told the victim she was doing &quot;God&apos;s work&quot; and needed to perform rituals in furtherance of the alleged &quot;demon removal work&quot; at an &quot;altar&quot; at a mysterious church which the victim never saw and wasn&apos;t allowed to visit. </p>

<p>First Nicholes allegedly said she&apos;d need $33K in cash ($1K for each year of her age) for special candles and crystals to be used in the cleansing ceremony. Then she allegedly asked for a Rolex Daytona Everose watch with a black dial (valued at $30K) because (<em>here we go</em>) it would be used as part of a ritual that would &quot;spring back time&quot; to before the victim was born, thereby allowing her to remove the demon. </p>

<p>If the victim told anyone about the &quot;demon removal work,&quot; the work would fail.</p>

<p>And even after the ceremony (which also involved white bed sheets and the victim&apos;s urine) and the victim was told she was cured of her demon, Nicholes allegedly continued the scam, allegedly conning the victim into buying a $2,400 tuxedo as an extra precaution in order to &quot;renew her marriage.&quot;</p>

<p>The victim finally got fed up and hired Nygaard to build a criminal case against Nicholes; he used two operatives to conduct undercover stings, allegedly catching Nicholes directly soliciting and receiving money from both. They described Nicholes as &quot;claiming and pretending to tell fortunes, and holding herself out as being able, by claimed or pretended use of occult powers.&quot;</p>

<p>Nicholes was arrested this past Sunday outside her parlor at 880 Lexington Avenue; police say she has been charged with grand larceny, scheming to defraud and fortunetelling. She is accused of deceiving the victim into paying just over $62K altogether. </p>

<p>Nicholes was also arrested this past June for grand larceny; she is accused of conspiring with a Bloomingdale&apos;s employee to receive store credit for unreturned items.</p>
