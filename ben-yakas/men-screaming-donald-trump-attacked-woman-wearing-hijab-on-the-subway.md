<p>A Muslim woman was attacked and harassed by three men who called her a terrorist and repeatedly shouted &quot;Donald Trump!&quot; at her on the subway yesterday.</p>

<p>Police say the incident happened around 10 p.m. on Wednesday, when the 18-year-old victim was waiting for a northbound 6 train at the 23rd Street and Park Avenue station. Three men, believed to be around 21 years old, approached her and started screaming Trump&apos;s name at her. </p>

<p>The men then followed the unnamed victim onto the train, where they continued yelling Trump&apos;s name and called her a &quot;fucking terrorist.&quot; They allegedly screamed other xenophobic things as well, including, &quot;get the hell out of the country,&quot; and &quot;you don&#x2019;t belong here.&quot; Police say they ripped her purse off her shoulder, breaking the strap, then tried to remove her Hijab off of her head. </p>

<p>The victim exited the train at Grand Central and reported the incident to police; the suspects, who she said were drunk, stayed on the train.  </p>

<p>Cops add that no arrests have been made, and the incident is being investigated as a bias crime.</p>
