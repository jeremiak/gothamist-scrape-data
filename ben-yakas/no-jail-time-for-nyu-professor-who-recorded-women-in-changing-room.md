<p>A respected NYU art history teacher <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506161728/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/15/nyu_professor_arrested_for.php">who was arrested last year</a> and accused of being a peeping professor has been sentenced for his misdeeds. Ross Finocchio, 35, plead guilty to two counts of felony unlawful surveillance as part of a no-jail plea deal yesterday. &quot;I hope you accept my heartfelt apology for disturbing your lives,&quot; he said to his victims, who were not in court, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506161728/http://nypost.com/2014/05/21/pervy-professor-gets-probation-for-dressing-room-peeping/">according to the Post</a>. &quot;I was not well&#x2026;[But] I&#x2019;ve done everything in my power to acknowledge wrongdoing.&quot;</p>

<p>Finocchio was caught using his iPhone to spy on young women in the changing rooms at Beacon&apos;s Closet last May. Two women, ages 26 and 28, told cops they were trying on clothes in separate booths when Finocchio&apos;s shoe slide under the partition from the dressing room next door&#x2014;with Finocchio&apos;s phone in it. When he was confronted by store workers and came out of the booth, store manager Stephanie Williams said Finocchio &quot;was sweating profusely,&quot; and she snapped the photo above. </p>

<p>Finocchio said in court that the incidents were triggered by &#x201C;low points&#x201D; in his life, and he has suffered &quot;a slew of collateral consequences,&quot; including losing his teaching position at NYU, as well as gigs as a lecturer at the Met and Sotheby&#x2019;s.</p>
