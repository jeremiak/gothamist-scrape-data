<p>Earlier today, an elderly man was taken into custody after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717104323/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/06/man_attempted_to_commit_suicide_at.php">he attempted to commit suicide in the plaza</a> of the <em>Today</em> show. Queens resident Pak Chong Mar, 76, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717104323/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/man-attempts-suicide-today-show-article-1.1364706?adlasdkjf">told the Daily News</a> that he slashed his wrists as a protest against the IRS, who he claimed had robbed him of millions of dollars. &#x201C;I had to do something desperate to fight the corruption, fight the IRS,&#x201D; Mar said while on a hospital gurney at Bellevue Hospital. &#x201C;They are so powerful.&#x201D;</p>

<p>According to cops, Pak was in the plaza around 7:50 a.m. when the incident happened; he yelled about the IRS and &#x201C;peppermint tea&#x201D; before he pulled out his knife. He was able to cut both his wrists before he was tackled by security. &#x201C;He took him down like a sack of potatoes,&#x201D; a friend of the guard told the News. &#x201C;He&#x2019;s a regular guy, ex-cop, NYPD. It&#x2019;s what he does.&#x201D;</p>
