<p>It&apos;s cute when <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508194129/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqQ2xT5EuoQ">Train sings about</a> the fog rolling in, but it&apos;s not so cute when it happens on an airplane. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508194129/http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/1h3u76/last_night_flying_out_of_jfkthis_happened_and/">Reddit user Fliccolo says</a> she was flying out of JFK on Delta Airlines this week when her cabin filled with smokey fog: &quot;It was starting when we were on the ground then it stayed well on until nearly cruising level. It was at the top of my chest sitting down. I&apos;m of average height so... It was freaky.&quot;</p>

<p>She says she was later told that there was nothing unnatural, or supernatural, going on: &quot;It&apos;s the ac pumping out fog from going thru a bunch of rather violent storms so hot air/ cold air combo of instant interior clouds. I ordered a stiff Don Draper Drink.&quot; People were obviously a bit freaked out, but she said the captain more than made up for it: &quot;My plane of people minded quite a bit. Then also the turbulence and the captain was like fuck it free booze for you poor bastards!&quot; (Delta normally charges up to $7 for drinks.)</p>

<p>This once again proves that it&apos;s probably not a great thing when your flight starts to resemble a heavy metal concert and/or a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508194129/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/04/photo_one_way_to_deal_with_unruly_a.php">bondage-themed Halloween party.</a></p>
