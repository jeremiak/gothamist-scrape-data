<p>We can all agree that besides <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405020412/http://www.questionpapers.net.in/general_knowledge/awareness/important_days.html">Coconut Day</a> and maybe the birth of your first child (but only the FIRST one), the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405020412/http://gothamist.com/tags/superbowl">Super Bowl</a> is<em> the</em> most important day of any given year. So it makes complete sense that Edison, NJ police officer Sgt. Andrew Chupela would (allegedly) prioritize watching the Big Game over, say, doing the police work for which he is paid $145K a year (not including overtime). &quot;We&apos;ve got carjackings. We&apos;ve got graffiti all over town. I&apos;ve got people speeding down my street all the time,&quot; neighbor Thomas DeRienzo <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405020412/http://www.nj.com/middlesex/index.ssf/2014/02/on-duty_edison_police_officer_abandoned_patrol_to_go_home_during_super_bowl_complaint_says.html#incart_m-rpt-1">told The Star-Ledger</a>. &quot;With all the negative publicity, these men have the audacity to continue to laugh in the faces of New Jersey residents?&quot;</p>

<p>Chupela, a 29-year veteran, is being investigated for watching the Super Bowl at home last Sunday when he was on duty. He even left his car in the driveway with the engine idling and his headlights on, presumably so he could jump into it at a moment&apos;s notice once he saw a news report on TV about a crime that had already been committed after the game concluded and after watching Prince guest star on <em>New Girl</em>, because c&apos;mon, how often is Prince on TV?!!?</p>

<p>DeRienzo and his girlfriend were the ones who noticed the idling car, and phoned in a complaint that night. &quot;Whether he was actually watching the Super Bowl or not is irrelevant,&quot; DeRienzo said. &quot;The police vehicle was there for an extended period of time, and that IS relevant. The taxpayers of Edison are getting fleeced by guys like this who think they are above the law.&quot;</p>

<p>Chupela has not been suspended yet, according to Chief Thomas Bryan of the Edison Police Department. &quot;Any and all complaints against a police officer are investigated to their logical conclusion, and if sustained, the appropriate measure of discipline is administered,&quot; Bryan said. But hey, it&apos;s not like he&apos;s cutting corners in any other area.</p>
