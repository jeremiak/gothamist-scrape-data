<p>After years of avoiding the spotlight, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171030070253/http://gothamist.com/tags/davechappelle">Dave Chappelle</a> has become almost ubiquitous in the last year, hosting <em>Saturday Night Live</em>, playing sold out shows across the country, and recording multiple Netflix specials. He&apos;s not done yet: Chappelle will return to NYC for a ten show residency at Radio City Music Hall in August. And he&apos;s bringing along a lot of special guests for it.</p>

<p>The ten date residency will kick off on August 1st, and end on August 24th. Chappelle will be joined by Donald Glover/Childish Gambino (Glover had previously said that his performance at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171030070253/http://gothamist.com/tags/governorsball">Governors Ball</a> would be his only live show of 2017), Erykah Badu, Chris Rock, The Roots, Trevor Noah, Ali Wong, and one &quot;very special guest&quot; who hasn&apos;t been announced yet. </p>

<p>In <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171030070253/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/17/arts/television/dave-chappelle-on-trump-cosby-and-his-netflix-deal.html">an interview with the Times</a> earlier this year, Chappelle talked about his reinvigorated love for performing stand-up: &quot;I could quit my show, and that&#x2019;s one kind of difficulty. But quitting doing stand-up would be another. I&#x2019;m sure everybody gets to a point where they run out of [stuff] to say, and they&#x2019;ve got to take a knee and recharge and be introspective and live their life. But it&#x2019;s hard to not ever come back to. Guys might walk away from it and close the door, but they don&#x2019;t lock it behind. Eddie Murphy always entertains the possibility of doing it again. Even though he doesn&#x2019;t do it, I&#x2019;m sure he thinks about it all the time. It&#x2019;s just one of those things where you&#x2019;ll do it for 10 years, and then you&#x2019;ll think about it for the next 30.&quot;</p>
