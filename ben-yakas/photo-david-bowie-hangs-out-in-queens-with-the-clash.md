<p>This week, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150602084558/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/01/listen_now_to_the_excellent_new_dav.php">we gave our first impressions</a> of the excellent new <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150602084558/http://gothamist.com/tags/davidbowie">David Bowie</a> album <em>The Next Day</em>, which will officially be released on March 12th. Suffice to say, it&apos;s his most vibrant album in 30 years, suffused with subtle hooks, weird (but warm) production touches, and an anything-goes spirit. We&apos;ve plunged into an all-Bowie musical and historical wormhole, which led us to the amazing photo above of Bowie hanging out with Paul Simonon of The Clash after that band&apos;s historic concert at Shea Stadium in 1982. </p>

<p>&quot;The Only Band That Matters&quot; was always a bit wary of rock &quot;dinosaurs,&quot; but it seems they crossed paths with Bowie <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150602084558/http://www.theclashblog.com/david-bowie-and-the-clash/">several times over the years</a>. And that appreciation went both ways: after Joe Strummer died, Bowie said: &quot;The Clash turned punk into a proper political movement, and Joe Strummer showed recently that he still had much of value to say. It is a terrible tragedy to lose him at this early age.&quot;</p>

<p>You can see a video of The Clash performing &quot;Career Opportunities&quot; at Shea Stadium below.</p>
