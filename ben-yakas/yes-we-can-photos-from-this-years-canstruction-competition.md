<p>The 19th Annual New York City charity <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120104125707/http://canstruction.org/">Canstruction competition</a> and exhibition <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120104125707/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/10/100000_cans_turned_into_inventive_s.php#photo-1">has been on display</a> around the World Financial Center for a few weeks&#x2014;but it&apos;ll only be up until tomorrow, so now&apos;s your last chance to go take a look at the can-based art for charity. And even if you CAN&apos;t make it down there, at least you CAN peruse all the art in the photos above!</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120104125707/http://joonbug.com/newyork/cool-shit/Canstruction-Winners-Announced/mIyaWBcfaa7">This year&apos;s creations included</a> replicas of Alexander McQueen&#x2019;s famed Lady Gaga shoes, Angry Birds, the Titanic, a &quot;Don&#x2019;t Walk&quot; sign, the Brooklyn Bridge, and a working QR Code. City Harvest said it will be able to feed over 60,000 New Yorkers with the construction materials. </p>

<p>The Jurors&apos; Favorite award went to NY-based Ginsler and WSP Flack + Kurtz, who partnered up to create &quot;Loaded Dice.&quot; The sculpture is a solid cube of 8,950 cans using 24 different types of food, and revolves around the concept that America&apos;s poor having the odds stacked against them. Below, you can see a time-lapse video of the team assembling it. </p>
