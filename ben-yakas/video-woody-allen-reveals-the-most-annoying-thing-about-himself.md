<p>We were riveted by the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501174809/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/16/epic_woody_allen_documentary_will_f.php">sprawling PBS documentary</a> on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501174809/http://gothamist.com/tags/woodyallen">Woody Allen&apos;s</a> career last year&#x2014;if you&apos;re a fan and you haven&apos;t seen <em>Woody Allen: A Documentary</em>, we <em>highly</em> recommend it&#x2014;but we never saw the below interview before now. Allen has already been asked a million questions about his love of jazz and how much he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501174809/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/01/woody_allen_thinks_annie_hall_is_ok.php">dislikes <em>Manhattan</em></a>, but director Robert Weide decided to try to throw him off with 12 unusual questions he&apos;s likely never been asked before. If you ever wanted to know what Allen thinks is the most annoying thing about himself, watch below.</p>

<p>Some of the questions included: his three movie star crushes (Rita Hayworth, Vivien Leigh, Ava Gardner), the hardest thing he&apos;s had to give up for health reasons (Malteds), the most annoying thing about himself (constant whining), the dead person he&apos;d like to have dinner with (nobody, unless Sidney Bechet picked up the check), the film he has defended not liking (<em>Some Like It Hot</em>), and whether he&apos;d rather sacrifice watching movies or sports (movies, because sporting events &quot;remain thrilling&quot;). </p>

<p>He gave a poignant response to the question of one thing you did as a kid that he&apos;d be furious to learn that his kids did: &quot;I stole, cheated and made fires.&quot; And he was asked to choose between nightmare scenarios: being stuck in an elevator with the power out or stuck in a nice hotel suite with animals and synthetic dance music playing. &quot;This is not a good choice,&quot; Allen responded. &quot;I don&apos;t think I could be in a pet shop that long. It&apos;s a disgusting choice, either case. I don&apos;t think I could do either one.&quot; </p>
