<p>NYU instructors: if they&apos;re not <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150107120550/http://gothamist.com/2012/09/05/james_francos_former_nyu_professor.php">suing James Franco</a> or allegedly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150107120550/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/15/nyu_professor_arrested_for.php">taking upskirt photos of women</a>, then they&apos;re probably having meltdowns in Williamsburg. Former NYU teacher Hans Shmidheiser <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150107120550/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/nyu_nut_bloody_menace_oHIoxhejSD0oU57hW2ezSK">was arrested Friday</a> after he allegedly went on a bizarre rager across Williamsburg, harassing locals and dogs. According to the Post, at one point, he picked up a dog and asked, &#x201C;What the f--k is your name?&#x201D; </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150107120550/http://cims.nyu.edu/~shmid/">Shmidheiser</a>, 30, went on bizarre rampage around 8 a.m. on Friday in the neighborhood. The owner of the dog called cops after that run-in, but Shmidheiser also walked up to a female pedestrian: &#x201C;He said he wanted to go to the hospital because he was drinking a lot of blood,&#x201D; she told the Post. He threw a red liquid at the woman which he claimed was blood; it turned out to be fruit punch.</p>

<p>Shmidheiser has now been charged with menacing and harassment, both misdemeanors. He taught math at NYU from 2004 to 2008; according to his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150107120550/http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=991767">Rate My Professors</a> page, he wasn&apos;t beloved: &quot;The epitome of whats wrong with NYU and its math department in particular. Worst math teacher in my academic career.&quot;</p>
