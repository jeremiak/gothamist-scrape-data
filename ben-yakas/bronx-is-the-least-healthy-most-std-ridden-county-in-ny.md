<p>We already knew the murder rate was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110515213533/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/18/107_spike_in_bronx_public_housing_m.php">pretty bad</a> in the Bronx, but can&apos;t a borough catch a break? In an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110515213533/http://www.countyhealthrankings.org/new-york">annual study</a> that determines and ranks the nation&apos;s counties healthiness, the Bronx was the unhealthiest county in NY state. This is the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110515213533/http://gothamist.com/2010/02/17/study_the_bronx_is_the_least_health.php">second year</a> in a row that the Bronx was ranked last in the state...but at least they can comfort themselves that Brooklyn is starting to catch up!</p>

<p>In the study, by the University of Wisconsin and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, the Bronx <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110515213533/http://www.countyhealthrankings.org/new-york/bronx">ranked last</a> in almost every category, including morbidity and &quot;social and economic factors.&quot; They study found that 26 percent of adults are in poor or fair shape, compared to 16 percent statewide and 10 percent nationwide; they found that there were 8,139 premature deaths per 100,000 people, compared to a state average of 5,933; and single parents households are 63 percent, compared to 20 percent nationally. Especially disturbing: the teen birth rate in the Bronx is twice the national average, and the STD rate is approximately 1300 percent greater than national average&#x2014;they had 1,145 STDs per 100,000 people in the Bronx vs. a national average of 83. To be fair, they were only 250 percent greater than the NY state average.</p>

<p>Brooklyn didn&apos;t fare that much better: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110515213533/http://www.countyhealthrankings.org/new-york/kings">it was ranked</a> 58 overall out of the 62 NY counties. It had especially bad stats with &quot;social and economic factors&quot;, physical environments, and morbidity; they had greater rates of STDs and excessive drinking than the national average. Interestingly, Brooklyn also had a worse ranking of access to healthy foods than both the Bronx and the national rate. Guess the healthy food movement&apos;s impact on Brooklyn has been greatly overstated.</p>
