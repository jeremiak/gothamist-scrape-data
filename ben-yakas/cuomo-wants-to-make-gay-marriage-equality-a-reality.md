<p>You know that old adage that moms love to say: everyday is a gift (filled with Carl Paladino doing something crazy). With all of his crazy <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428101550/http://gothamist.com/tags/carlpaladino">dominating</a> the gubernatorial storyline this week, we feel like we&apos;ve lost track of Andrew Cuomo. Or, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428101550/http://gothamist.com/2010/10/14/paladino_debate.php">&quot;very oily&quot;</a> Cuomo is very purposefully keeping quiet and letting Carl win the election for him. But even well-coiffed politicians must peek out of their rabbit holes for stump speeches and appearances, and Cuomo did just that last night at the Empire State Pride Agenda&apos;s Fall Dinner. And he promised that if he was elected, he would stand up to make marriage equality a reality.</p>

<p>&quot;I don&apos;t want to be the governor who just proposes marriage equality. I don&apos;t want to be the governor who lobbies for marriage equality. I don&apos;t want to be the governor who fights for marriage equality.<strong> I want to be the governor who signs the law that makes equality a reality in the state of New York</strong>,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428101550/http://www.nydailynews.com/blogs/dailypolitics/2010/10/cuomo-to-gay-activists-i-want.html">he said</a> at the gay political event (We certainly haven&apos;t heard <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428101550/http://gothamist.com/2009/10/23/paterson_believes_gay_marriage_bill.php">that line before</a>). He also criticized Paladino, who had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428101550/http://gothamist.com/2010/10/13/paladino_apologizes_for_gay_remarks.php">apologized</a> this week for several controversial statements he made on homosexuality: &quot;We are looking at an extreme political agenda on the other side of the election, and you saw it this week with the LGBT community&#x2014;but it&apos;s not just the LGBT community...<strong>Take nothing for granted because people are afraid, people are anxious and these forces are looking to exploit that</strong>.&quot;</p>

<p>Paladino had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428101550/http://gothamist.com/2010/10/10/paladino_homosexuality_not_an_equal.php">criticized</a> Cuomo earlier this week for attending the Gay Pride Parade with his daughter, and Cuomo has been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428101550/http://www.newsday.com/long-island/politics/spin-cycle-1.812042/guv-race-cuomo-steps-up-charge-of-an-extremist-foe-1.2361599">seizing</a> on Paladino&apos;s speech <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428101550/http://gothamist.com/2010/10/12/cuomo_wont_take_parenting_advice_fr_1.php">all week</a>, positioning himself as the gay-friendly candidate. Of course, Paladino still thinks of himself as gay-friendly too: &quot;<strong>I&apos;ve been a high supporter of the gay community my entire career and I will continue to be,</strong>&#x201D; he said on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428101550/http://www.nydailynews.com/blogs/dailypolitics/2010/10/carl-paladino-ive-been-a-high.html">CNBC yesterday</a>. What are you saying Carl, someone would have to be <em>high</em> to support gay rights?</p>
