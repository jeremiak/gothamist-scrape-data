<p>Yesterday was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150416124806/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/22/swastika-rehabilitation-day_n_1610551.html?utm_hp_ref=weird-news">World Swastika Rehabilitation Day</a>, an occasion to try &quot;to explain the true meaning of the symbol,&#x201D; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150416124806/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/plane_dumb_swastika_boost_8OvrDpnzl5KWtGofFjhHFO?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Manhattan">according to</a> Thomas Kaenzig, a member of the International Raelian Movement and the organizer of the event. Oh, did you not know this was happening? Then you must not have looked up, since a plane flew across Manhattan, across the Jersey Shore and across Long Beach Island with a banner displaying the word &quot;Swastika&quot; along with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150416124806/http://proswastika.org/">the group&apos;s insignia</a> (a swastika intertwined with a Star of David). As you can imagine, people <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150416124806/https://twitter.com/#!/search/realtime/swastika%20plane">were confused</a> and less than enthusiastic.</p>

<p>Kaenzig told the Post, &#x201C;By keeping it taboo, we give credit to the horrific Nazi ideology.&#x201D; But the Raelians&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150416124806/http://altreligion.about.com/od/mythologicalfigures/p/Elohim.htm">who believe that</a> life on Earth was scientifically created by extraterrestrials known as the Elohim&#x2014;might have some trouble convincing people without a bit more context. The Jewish Community Center of Long Beach Island was certainly concerned: &quot;We&apos;re trying to find out&#x2014;what are their intentions?&quot; Don Pripstein, the center&apos;s president, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150416124806/http://manasquan.patch.com/articles/plane-flying-over-lbi-shows-nazi-symbol#c">told Patch.</a></p>

<p>Also not in the Raelians favor: the rehabilitation day also came at a time when there has been an uptick in swastika-related incidents around Brooklyn. There have been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150416124806/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/16/surveilliance_video_released_of_bor.php">at least</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150416124806/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/18/more_swastikas_scrawled_in_borough.php">three of</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150416124806/https://twitter.com/NYCGreenfield/status/216252448589877249">those incidents</a> in Borough Park over the last two weeks alone.</p>
