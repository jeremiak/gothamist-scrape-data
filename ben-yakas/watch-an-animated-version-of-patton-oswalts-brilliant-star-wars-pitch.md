<p>A (not so) long time ago in a <em>Parks and Recreation</em> episode far away, Patton Oswalt visited the show and pulled off an incredible 8+ minute improvised filibuster centering around his ideal plot for <em>Star Wars: Episode VII</em> (which involves a melding of the Marvel and <em>Star Wars</em> universes, and, um, Spider-Chewbacca). Now, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130808171125/https://twitter.com/izacless">Isaac Moores</a> has lovingly animated the whole rant into the nerdgasm video below. </p>
