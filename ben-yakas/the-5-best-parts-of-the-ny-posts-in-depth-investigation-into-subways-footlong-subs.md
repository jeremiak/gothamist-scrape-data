<p>This week, an Australian man demanded answers from Subway after he posted a photo of a Footlong sub <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150710070136/https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=513327888712577&amp;set=o.224383614973&amp;type=1&amp;comment_id=1605511&amp;offset=200&amp;total_comments=576">on Facebook</a> that showed it was <em>only 11 inches long</em>. Matt Corby&apos;s daring questions sparked a revolution, as people began inundating Subway&apos;s Facebook page with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150710070136/https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=o.224383614973&amp;type=1">photos of pathetically meager sandwiches</a>. And thus, the NY Post launched <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150710070136/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/this_hero_is_coming_up_short_RzxQNoGFTSdY0AeooGxBiP">the most important investigation of our time</a>...probably after seeing the story <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150710070136/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/16/early_addition_1185.php">in Early Addition yesterday.</a> Below, we picked out our five favorite moments from their front-page tale of deceit, greed, and grease.</p>

<p><em>They deserve a knuckle sandwich.</em> They start things off right with a classic NY Post lede&#x2014;classic in that it is both a pun AND a promise of violence. Hopefully they can find more ways to enrage their readers over this inconsequential topic. </p>

<p><em>Four out of seven Footlongs&#x2014;purchased at Subway locations in Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens&#x2014;measured only 11 or 11.5 inches, according to the test.</em> Here&apos;s the meat of their story: interns were sent to seven of the <strong>168 NYC-area Subway locations</strong> for this &quot;test&quot;...and their results from this teeny sampling are far from convincing. Our own scientific mathification of their data showed that their seven subs average out to 11.6&quot; each, which means they&apos;re really splitting hairs here. And that is giving them the benefit of the doubt about their measuring methods: who even knows if they measured from the base of the sandwich!</p>

<p><em>&#x201C;<strong>They&#x2019;re cheating us!</strong>&#x201D; said 32-year-old Juan Rivera, who runs a hardware shop in Brooklyn Heights. He eats Subway every other day with his father&#x2014;but now he feels betrayed. &#x201C;That&#x2019;s foul and misleading. They state it&#x2019;s a foot long, so it should be a foot long!&#x201D;</em> There it is: the outrage is starting to boil over. Let&apos;s all keep in mind that the &quot;Footlong&quot; name is a trademark of Subway, and a trademark IS a promise, and a broken promise deserves nothing less than a broken face from a knuckle sandwich. Sure, eating Subway every other day doesn&apos;t sound very healthy or tasty to us, but family traditions are family traditions, regardless of taste buds or clogged arteries. This does remind us: has anyone investigated ballpark footlongs yet? Oh, that&apos;s right&#x2014;nobody cares.</p>

<p><em>And those extra few bites can really add up. If you buy a $7 &#x201C;footlong&#x201D; every other day for a year, an axed extra inch adds up to a loss of roughly $100.</em> More outrage: you are being shanked by the hand of the free market, people who eat Subway an inordinate amount of time! Since you&apos;re already risking costly health problems in the future, the least they could do is give you your money&apos;s worth to begin with. The perfect solution: a knuckle sandwich.</p>

<p><em>Some defended the &#x201C;shrinkage,&#x201D; saying toasted subs come out shorter &#x2014; but The Post&#x2019;s analysis didn&#x2019;t bear that out.</em> <em>Seinfeld</em> reference? Check. Questionable science on bread? Check. Calling a glorified survey an &quot;analysis&quot;? Check plus.</p>

<p>We can&apos;t wait for the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150710070136/http://gothamist.com/tags/andreapeyser">Andrea Peyser</a> column on this scandal.</p>
