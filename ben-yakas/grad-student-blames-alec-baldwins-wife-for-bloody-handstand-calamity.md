<p>Yesterday, Alec Baldwin&apos;s pregnant wife Hilaria Thomas <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130510145710/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/16/alec_baldwins_wife_sued_by_man_over.php">was the subject of a lawsuit</a> by a grad student who claims he suffered yoga injuries in her class that caused a &quot;severe&quot; and &quot;serious&quot; &quot;emotional upset.&quot; The details of 32-year-old Spencer Wolfe&apos;s lawsuit were quite vague&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130510145710/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/pane_and_uffering_xDZB5vtnaT1rjGh71ipATP">but the NY Post has dug up the dirt</a>. It seems Wolfe ripped open his left leg and foot after he lost his balance and crashed into a sixth-floor glass window while performing a handstand during Thomas&apos; yoga class. &#x201C;There was a large amount of blood,&#x201D; one student in the class told them.</p>

<p>Wolfe blamed the incident, which happened on Jan. 15th at Yoga Vida near Union Square, on the &#x201C;overcrowded&#x201D; class and Thomas&#x2019; &#x201C;negligence.&quot; The anonymous student told the Post her classes &quot;gets insanely crowded there,&quot; and Wolfe was forced to perform the handstand too close to the window. That student added that someone screamed, &quot;It&apos;s your fault! It&apos;s your fault!&quot; at Thomas afterwards. But another student said that Thomas instructed Wolfe that he had been doing the handstand incorrectly before he fell. </p>

<p>Wolfe&apos;s left foot smashed &#x201C;straight through the window,&#x201D; the student said; a piece of it cut into his left below the knee, slicing it open in give places. Thomas and one of Wolff&#x2019;s male friends from the class went with him to the hospital. Wolfe&apos;s lawyer, Paul Weitz, said he might have a permanent disability. &#x201C;He can&#x2019;t flex the ankle and the foot points downward. He&#x2019;s in a boot,&#x201D; Weitz told the Post. &#x201C;He is worried whether he&#x2019;ll be able to use his leg normally again &#x2014; and right now it&#x2019;s a waiting game.&#x201D;<br>
 <br>
In case you didn&apos;t notice, all of the Post&apos;s sources and accounts of the class come from anonymous yoga students who were there at the time of the incident&#x2014;to the point that we can&apos;t even tell if there were 1 or 2 students they spoke to, or many more than that. As is his way, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130510145710/http://gothamist.com/tags/alecbaldwin">Alec Baldwin</a> responded to some of the Post&apos;s allegations <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130510145710/https://twitter.com/ABFalecbaldwin">on Twitter today</a>: </p>

<p>Baldwin also mentioned that he filed a formal complaint against a NY Post photographer who was hanging around his apartment this morning: &quot;Thank u 2 NYPD officers who came 2 my home 2day so that I could file a formal complaint against NY Post &quot;photographer&quot; who assaulted me...I slipped and fell on the trail of oil the Post &quot;photographer&quot; left near my bldg. Who do I sue?&quot; So it&apos;s good to hear those two are getting along <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130510145710/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/19/photos_yes_alec_baldwin_is_dressed.php">as well</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130510145710/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/11/alec_baldwin_learns_post_reporters.php">as ever.</a> </p>

<p>Baldwin also couldn&apos;t help but poke fun at Wolfe, whose <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130510145710/http://gawker.com/5984741/alec-baldwins-wife-sued-for-traumatizing-yoga-class">&quot;comedically fancy pedigree&quot;</a> and pretentious novel (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130510145710/http://works.bepress.com/spencer_wolff/1/">Go read it! It&apos;s part com&#xE9;die humaine in the Maghreb!</a>) certainly makes it easy-to-do:</p>
