<p>Infamous reBar owner Jason Stevens was spotted for the first time today after abruptly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140517191211/http://gothamist.com/2014/05/09/dumbo_rebar_closed.php">shutting down his business Friday</a>, stiffing workers and couples <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140517191211/http://gothamist.com/2014/05/10/ex-rebar_employee_local_businesses.php">thousands of dollars</a>. An attorney tells us Stevens was seen at his arraignment in a Brooklyn court this morning. His arrest has not been reported. According to online court records, Stevens was charged with one count of felony grand larceny and multiple felony tax charges at Brooklyn Criminal Court this morning.</p>

<p>In an email, our tipster writes, &quot;I&apos;m a criminal defense attorney in Brooklyn and a colleague of mine just witnessed the criminal arraignment of Jason Stevens. He&apos;s been found! I don&apos;t have all of the details right now, but he&apos;s been charged w/ felonies. He, not surprisingly, made the 30k bail.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140517191211/http://gothamist.com/2014/05/11/rebar_owner_owed_irs_millions_claim.php">Some former employees told us</a> that Stevens made off with around $150,000 in wedding deposit checks and $27,000 in cash. Stevens had been audited by the IRS last year, and those former staffers suggest he owed $2.5-3 million in unpaid sales tax.</p>

<p>It&apos;s unclear so far whether Stevens willingly turned himself in or if he was caught and arrested. The Brooklyn DA did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
