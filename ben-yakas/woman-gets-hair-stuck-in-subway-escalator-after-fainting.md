<p>A woman got her hair stuck in a subway escalator yesterday afternoon after fainting. According to FDNY, the 32-year-old woman was on an escalator at the W. 125th Street train station around 3:20 p.m. when the incident happened. Emergency workers had to shut down the escalator to free her; she suffered cuts to her face, legs and arms, and was taken to a nearby hospital where she is in stable condition.</p>

<p>&#x201C;She looked like she was passed out,&#x201D; witness Sha Johnson <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130813085214/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/ordeal_on_subway_escalator_k0PjTdZzvH8x83J34xoDDL?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=">told the Post</a>. &#x201C;She was wearing shorts and one of her legs was all cut up...I&#x2019;ll probably take the stairs from now on.&#x201D; The Post adds that the woman is an epileptic, and she suffered a seizure which caused the fall, but FDNY and NYPD could not confirm that. <br>
