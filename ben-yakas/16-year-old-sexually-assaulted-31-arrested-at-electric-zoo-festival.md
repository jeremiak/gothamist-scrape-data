<p>The last day of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429104158/http://gothamist.com/tags/electriczoo">Electric Zoo electronic music festival</a> was cancelled by the city on Sunday after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429104158/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/01/ravers_lash_out_on_twitter_over_ele.php">two people died</a> and four others were hospitalized due to Ecstasy-related illnesses. But that wasn&apos;t all that happened: during the first two days of the festival, a 16-year-old girl was sexually assaulted and 31 people were arrested.</p>

<p>According <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429104158/http://awalkintheparknyc.blogspot.com/2013/09/electric-zoo-teen-sexually-assaulted-2.html">to A Walk In The Park</a>, the young girl woke up on Friday under a van in a parking lot with her pants undone and bruises and scratches on her legs. She was taken to New York-Presbyterian Hospital Weill Cornell, where it was determined she had been sexually assaulted. Thirty-one people were arrested over the two days offenses including drug sales, disorderly conduct, resisting arrest and possession of controlled substances; at least two of the arrests were for two felonies.  </p>

<p>Several people spoke to the dailies about the lack of security at the event: &#x201C;Not once was I asked to open it, and not once was I patted down,&#x201D; Andrew Edvin <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429104158/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/queens/city-cancells-final-day-electric-zoo-dance-music-fest-deaths-concergoers-article-1.1442839">told The News</a>. &#x201C;The security and staff along the entrance route did nothing to prevent drugs from being brought in.&#x201D;</p>

<p>A city employee complained to A Walk In The Park about the fact security didn&apos;t check for underage concertgoers: &quot;All the drug use and under-age activity that goes on here every year and now this. And this year they added a third day. And for what, money?  These events have to go. They are putting the public at risk.&quot;</p>
