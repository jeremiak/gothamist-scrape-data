<p>This week, a 14-year-old boy who recorded an &quot;It Gets Better&quot; video earlier this year <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160902035844/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/21/teen_who_recorded_it_gets_better_vi.php">was found dead</a> of an apparent suicide. Jamey Rodemeyer dedicated one of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160902035844/http://hausofjamey.tumblr.com/post/10348560993/thank-you-lady-gaga">his final messages</a> to his hero, Lady Gaga: &quot;Thank you Lady Gaga. For everything you have done for me. Paws up forever.&quot; Gaga <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160902035844/http://twitter.com/#!/ladygaga/status/116634542135189504">has now responded</a> to Jamey&apos;s tragic death by vowing to meet with President Obama to discuss bullying laws: &quot;I am meeting with our President. I will not stop fighting. This must end. Our generation has the power to end it. Trend it #MakeALawForJamey.&quot;</p>

<p>She wrote <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160902035844/http://twitter.com/#!/ladygaga/status/116632826979422208">earlier yesterday</a>: &quot;The past days I&apos;ve spent reflecting, crying, and yelling. I have so much anger. It is hard to feel love when cruelty takes someones life.&quot; Then <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160902035844/http://twitter.com/#!/ladygaga/status/116633801706323969">she tweeted</a> the specifics about Jamey to her followers: &quot;Jamey Rodemeyer, 14 yrs old, took his life because of bullying. http://tinyurl.com/6e7n49s. Bullying must become be illegal. It is a hate crime.&quot;</p>

<p>In an &quot;It Gets Better&quot; video which he made in May, Jamey talked about how he was inspired by Lady Gaga and her message of tolerance; his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160902035844/http://hausofjamey.tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a> is filled with pictures and quotes from the singer as well. Jamey&apos;s mom Tracy Rodemeyer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160902035844/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2011/09/22/earlyshow/living/parenting/main20110002.shtml">told CBS that</a> Jamey had his own message: &quot;For a young kid of 14 and a half, he had a big message, a huge message, that shouldn&apos;t even have to be a message. It should just be common decency to not make people feel worthless and useless on this planet.&quot; She added that she will bury her son Saturday in a Lady Gaga t-shirt which reads, &quot;Born This Way.&quot;</p>
