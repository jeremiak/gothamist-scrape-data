But in the past year, the city has cracked down on those abuses by forming a new unit within the Internal Affairs Bureau just for tracking down such offenders. Now, after nearly 1,700 summons issued to those abusers, some cops are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150512060033/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/04/15/legally-allowing-illegal-parking/?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">complaining</a> that it&apos;s getting in the way of their jobs.</p>

<p>After <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150512060033/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/09/detectives_say_their_cars_shouldnt.php">several instances</a> of the NYPD towing unmarked police vehicles in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150512060033/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/23/detectives_nypd_tow_truck_left_murd.php">middle of operations</a>, the NYPD has decided to allow for exceptions: &#x201C;If you are transporting a complainant or a witness to the court, or to the district attorney&#x2019;s office, for trial preparation, or delivering a large piece of evidence, then you can call and give I.A.B. your license plate number, and you will not be ticketed, or towed,&#x201D; said the department&#x2019;s chief spokesman, Deputy Commissioner Paul J. Browne. All police  have to do is get <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150512060033/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2010/04/15/2010-04-15_wanna_park_detectives_you_gotta_ask_permission.html">permission</a> from their superiors (or whatever other word one might substitute for that) now. </p>

<p>And oh the irony: many officers complained that the Internal Affairs Bureau &quot;would be better served by homing in on more serious allegations of corruption or serious misconduct.&#x201D; One <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150512060033/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/04/15/legally-allowing-illegal-parking/?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">City Room</a> commenter, Jamie, didn&apos;t miss a beat: &quot;<strong>Did NYPD officers just complain about receiving summonses for trivial and picayune reasons and say IA should focus on more serious matters??? Pot calling kettle black, come in pot, kettle calling&#x2026;&quot;</strong></p>
