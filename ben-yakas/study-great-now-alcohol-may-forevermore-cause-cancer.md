<p>We&apos;re still dealing with the fallout from learning that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140816205650/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/05/study_chocoholism_is_actually_a_dis.php">Chocoholism</a> is an actual disease, but this new report really hits us where it hurts. Is there any worse headline <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140816205650/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-1374672/Alcohol-causes-cancer-drink-safe-amount.html">to stumble upon than</a>, &quot;Alcohol causes cancer - even if you drink just over a pint of beer a day... and giving up won&apos;t help&quot;? Whatever happened to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140816205650/http://gothamist.com/2010/08/30/new_study_drinkers_live_longer_than.php">heavy drinkers will outlive nondrinkers</a>, huh Science?</p>

<p>According to a study of 363,988 people reported in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140816205650/http://www.bmj.com/lookup/doi/10.1136/bmj.d1584">the British Medical Journal</a>, one in 10 of all cancers in men and one in 33 in women were caused by past or current alcohol intake. More than 18 percent of alcohol-related cancers in men and about 4 percent in women were linked to excessive drinking. The study found that men who drank more than two (standard-sized) drinks a day and women who drank more than one drink a day were particularly at risk of alcohol-related cancers. Oxford University researcher Naomi Allen, who helps to compile the ongoing study, said,<strong> &quot;This supports existing evidence that alcohol causes cancer and that the risk increases even with drinking moderate amounts.&quot;</strong></p>

<p>Cancer Partners UK medical director Prof. Karol Sikora was a little less Apocalyptic in discussing the results with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140816205650/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-12999000">the BBC</a>: &quot;This is the best data we&apos;ve got and we&apos;re ever likely to get. The take-home message is that the more alcohol you drink, some of the common cancers - the four cancers that have been identified - do increase, and that&apos;s worrying. So the message has to be &apos;look at drinking habits, and reduce.&apos;&quot;</p>

<p>There is one silver lining we are clinging to: the study only <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140816205650/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-12999000">took place</a> in eight countries in Europe. So maybe Western Europeans just have inferior bodies which are prone to cancer, the Metric system, and football obsession? That&apos;s possible, right? Because this study only reflects drinking trends a decade ago, which Allen notes could spell even more doom for our current lot of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140816205650/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/06/studies_kids_think_alcohol_binging.php">binge drinking teenagers</a>: &quot;People are drinking even more now and this could lead to more people developing cancer because of alcohol in the future.&quot; How are we going to break this to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140816205650/http://gothamist.com/2010/11/15/report_new_yorkers_binge_drinking_t.php">the majority of New Yorkers</a>?</p>
