<p>Another day, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508194340/http://live.nydailynews.com/Event/Trial_of_cannibal_cop_NYPD_officer_Gilberto_Valle">more testimony in the trial</a> of alleged <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508194340/http://gothamist.com/tags/cannibalcop">&quot;Cannibal Cop&quot; Gilberto Valle</a>. Among the latest updates: prosecutors say Valle used an NYPD laptop and its national crime databases to look up information on his alleged intended kidnap targets, including former high school classmate Maureen Hartigan. They also said that one of Valle&apos;s targets <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508194340/http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2013/02/witness_in_cannibal_case_nyc_o.html#incart_river">was a fellow NYPD officer</a>, a former supervisor of his. &#x201C;The second girl listed is a cop &#x2014; Evelyn, 33 years old,&#x201D; Valle wrote to a 22-year-old New Jersey man named Michael Vanhise. &#x201C;No I want a reg girl,&#x201D; Vanhise responded.</p>

<p>Agent Anthony Foto <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508194340/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/cannibal_cop_used_nypd_laptop_to_4y1eJBAQcTLSbifctPBP0N?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20Manhattan">testified that</a> Valle claimed after his October arrest that he wasn&apos;t satisfied just talking to people about his fetish of kidnapping, killing and eating women. &quot;He claimed he would not have gone through with it. He claimed he did not enjoy it and he did not know why he was doing it,&quot; the agent said. Friday&apos;s testimony was abruptly ended when Judge Gardephe told jurors that &quot;some legal issues have come up that require his attention.&quot;</p>

<p>Over in England, one of Valle&apos;s alleged conspirators (and &quot;mentor&quot;) &quot;Moody Blues&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508194340/http://www.kentonline.co.uk/kentish_gazette/news/2013/march/1/kent_nurse_in_cannibal_plot.aspx">was arrested along with another man</a> over the alleged plot to kidnap, rape and eat women. &quot;Moody Blues,&quot; aka nurse Dale Bolinger, had told Valle that he had killed and eaten at least two women, and a 5-year-old child, in the past. Those email exchanges have been barred from Valle&apos;s trial as being &#x201C;too prejudicial,&#x201D; but cops were reportedly seen with shovels in the back garden of Bolinger&apos;s Canterbury house.<br>
