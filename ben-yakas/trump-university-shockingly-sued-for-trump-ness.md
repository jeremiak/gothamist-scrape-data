<p>Fashion designer Tarla Makaeff filed the suit against Trump U, which is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160304222928/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/16/trump_universitya_scam.php">already under fire</a> from educators for calling itself a university in the first place. In her suit, she says she was guaranteed a one-year apprenticeship with a personal real estate mentor, and instead got a half-day trip to Home Depot and seminars that were like &quot;infomercials&quot; designed to sell her more classes, an endlessly-looping moebius strip of Donald-isms. Her credit cards were maxed out as she spent huge sums of money for classes, including $34,995 for a &quot;Trump Gold Elite membership.&quot;</p>

<p>Straight-faced, she told the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160304222928/http://www.nydailynews.com/money/2010/05/05/2010-05-05_lawsuit_slams_trump_online_school_as_a_ripoff.html">Daily News</a>, <strong>&quot;I relied on the Trump name and Donald Trump&apos;s reputation as a real estate mogul. I expected nothing less than the best. ... Big mistake.&quot;</strong> Trump U President Michael Sexton called the lawsuit &quot;without merit,&quot; claiming Makaeff &quot;consumed all the services she purchased&quot; and declared herself satisfied in a videotaped testimonial (which definitely <em>doesn&apos;t</em> sound like something out of <em>A Clockwork Orange</em>).</p>
