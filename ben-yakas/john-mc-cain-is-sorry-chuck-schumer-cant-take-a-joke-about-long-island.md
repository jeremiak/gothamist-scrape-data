John McCain, always with the yukking! (AP)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>During a Senate debate about the treatment of enemy combatants, GOP Arizona Sen. (and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160622172518/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/16/ed_harris_makes_his_best_mccain_fac.php">Ed Harris opposite day impersonator</a>) John McCain <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160622172518/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/john-mccain-backs-long-island-slam-article-1.984854">made a throwaway joke</a> about the good people of Long Island: &quot;Last I checked, Long Island was part&#x2014;albeit sometimes regrettably&#x2014;of the United States Of America.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160622172518/http://instantrimshot.com/">Instant rimshot</a>! Sen. Chuck Schumer didn&apos;t find it so funny though, which led to some seriously catty back and forth insults between the two.</p>

<p>After hearing McCain&apos;s comment, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160622172518/https://twitter.com/#!/ChuckSchumer/status/141999102291484673">Schumer soberly tweeted</a>, &#x201C;All of America saw how heroic Long Islanders were on 9/11. Long Island deserves an apology.&quot; McCain later returned to the Senate floor and said Long Island was &#x201C;wonderful&#x201D; and not some unwanted land mass&#x2014;but he also responded directly to Schumer, saying: &#x201C;I&apos;m sorry there&apos;s at least one of my colleagues that can&apos;t take a joke, and <strong>so I apologize if I offended him and hope that someday he will have a sense of humor.&quot;</strong></p>

<p>Schumer couldn&apos;t let this stand, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160622172518/https://twitter.com/#!/ChuckSchumer/status/142006550599438336">tweeted in response</a>: &quot;NYers can take a joke. But if @SenJohnMcCain wants to mock parts of America, stick to Arizona.&quot; Does this mean Schumer and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160622172518/http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/11/30/us-anncoulter-idUSTRE7AS2T320111130">Ann Coulter have more in common</a> than anyone would have ever imagined? Leave it to actual Long Island Rep. Steve Israel to try to clear the air Long Island-style: with a shmear. &quot;If John McCain had ever had a Long Island bagel, he wouldn&apos;t be saying that. I&apos;m going to send some over and then ask him for an update on his views,&quot; he said, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160622172518/http://www.nydailynews.com/blogs/dailypolitics/2011/11/mccain-sadly-concedes-long-island-is-part-of-us-updated">according to the Daily News.</a></p>
