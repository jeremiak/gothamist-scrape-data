<p>A NY man living in Tulsa has filed a lawsuit against his plastic surgeon after he woke up from a rhinoplasty surgery without a nose. Vishal Thakkar <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508151424/http://www.fox23.com/news/local/story/Man-without-a-nose-files-lawsuit-against-Tulsa/m6HVbO4zaE21f05f2-4jQA.cspx">told Fox23 that</a> after his divorce in 2006, he decided to treat himself by getting a nose job. &quot;I decided to do something selfish,&quot; he said. He had eight surgeries alone between 2006 and 2007 because of complications, and then more in 2011: &quot;[The doctor] told me that there was an infection in there and since I was on the operating table and unconscious he had to make the decision,&quot; said Thakkar. Scroll down to see a full photo of what happened to his nose.</p>

<p>Thakkar is suing Dr. Angelo Cuzalina, who is president of the American Board of Cosmetic Surgery; the Oklahoma Medical Board does not show any complaints in his history before this. Something went wrong after the first surgery though: &quot;I had the first surgery and suffered some breathing problems, nothing too bad, but it made it hard to exercise and sleep,&quot; Thakker said. Altogether, Thakker says <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508151424/http://www.ktul.com/story/22504337/man-sues-after-22-nose-surgeries">he underwent 22 surgeries.</a></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508151424/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2337215/Man-suing-cosmetic-surgeon-awoke-rhinoplasty-entire-nose-removed.html">Thakker claims that there</a> were multiple instances when he specifically instructed Cuzalina and his nurses not to take anything from his ears to add as cartilage, but they disobeyed his request: &quot;I woke up with pain behind my ear and I said to the nurses, what part of &apos;Under no circumstances do not touch my ears, do you not understand?&apos;&quot; said Thakkar, who added that Cuzalina emailed him to apologize for that.</p>

<p>During another surgery, Thakkar says the doctor ran out of ear cartilage and had to look elsewhere: &quot;So he cut into my rib cage for cartilage, I didn&apos;t know it then, but I do not believe he is licensed for that kind of surgery!&quot;</p>

<p>In addition to negligence, the lawsuit alleges medical malpractice, malicious prosecution, defamation, intentional infliction of emotional distress, conspiracy and fraud. The lawsuit also claims that Thakker was &quot;&apos;prescribed an excessive amount of medication, enough to kill the patient, if taken, including but not limited to Loratab, Ambien, Valilum, and Oxycodone.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;By the time I am able to breathe without pain and have a human-looking nose, I will have had 30 surgeries on my face thanks to Angelo Cuzalina,&quot; Thakker noted. &quot;There is no way I am going to live like this. It is worse than being dead.&quot; </p>
