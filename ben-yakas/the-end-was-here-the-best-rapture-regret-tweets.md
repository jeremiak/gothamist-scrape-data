										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none" style=" width:640px; "> <img alt="102111rapt.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141101050505im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/102111rapt.jpg" width="640" height="481"> <br> <i>Maybe next time...</i></div> <p></p>

<p>Just as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141101050505/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/12/the_rapture_always_knocks_twice_jud.php">Harold Camping predicted</a>, the Rapture arrived today &quot;very, very quietly&quot;&#x2014;but it seems Camping <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141101050505/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/20/what_will_you_do_the_day_before_the.php#photo-1">left out the part</a> where it left just as quietly, leaving no trace of it ever having been here to begin with. Yes, for the second time this year, Camping&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141101050505/http://gothamist.com/tags/rapture">doomsday prediction</a> turned out to be a big tease. Barring any unforeseen cataclysmic global events, we think we can chalk this <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141101050505/http://gothamist.com/tags/judgmentday">Judgment Day</a> up as a bust. Somebody really needs to tell <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141101050505/http://twitter.com/#!/ElBloombito/status/127442701678419969">El Bloombito</a>: &quot;Los occupadoros at @OccupyWallStNYC should vamos out of el zuccotti parko por que Harold Camping dice el rapturo es coming! Cuidado!&quot;</p>

<p>While our ears have been locked to our trusty ham radio all day, our eyes have been glued on Twitter&#x2014;which is where we noticed Buzzfeed&apos;s &quot;Rapture Regrets&quot; hashtag. From perusing the hundreds of tweets, it seems a lot of people really regret not watching more television. Check out <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141101050505/http://www.buzzfeed.com/mikehayes/the-final-list-of-raptureregrets?utm_campaign=socialflow&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=buzzfeed">some of them here</a>, and below check out all of our favorites:</p>
