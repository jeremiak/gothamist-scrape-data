<p>Are men more likely to cheat and lie to their girlfriends than the other way around? That&apos;s certainly what celebrity rabble-rousing lawyer Gloria Allred believes. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501165815/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/comments_gals_hit_back_at_attorney_adjg3lqFAhjlgnlKkROI2O?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">Allred is representing</a> two women who allegedly badmouthed their ex-lover online on the website liarscheatersrus.com. &quot;I do believe that women should have a legal right to share information with each other, if they feel they have been betrayed in a relationship...We all know who is generally the victim of a lie or cheating,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501165815/http://www.tmz.com/2011/09/14/livestream-gloria-allred-roller-derby-stacey-blitsch-amanda-ryncarz-lawsuit-cheater-lawyer-ex-boyfriend-news-conference/?adid=recentlyupdatedstories">she said</a>. Watch her latest <strike>it&apos;s-all-about-me</strike> press conference below:</p>

<p>Allred&apos;s clients&#x2014;former &apos;roller jam&apos; television star Stacey Blitsch and lawyer Amanda Ryncarz&#x2014;both dated lawyer Matthew Couloute Jr., and say that Couloute jilted them (Blitsch has a son with him). One such anonymous posting <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501165815/http://liarscheatersrus.com/">on the site</a> about Couloute said, &#x201C;Our relationship didn&apos;t last long, as I figured him out pretty quickly, but for others, BE FOREWARNED, HE&#x2019;S SCUM. RUN FAR AWAY.&#x201D; Couloute sued both of them for defamation, and say that they have interfered with his &quot;ability to make a living.&quot;</p>

<p>Biltsch denies writing any posts about Couloute; Ryncarz admits she did, but says her comments were protected by free speech. &quot;I wanted to warn other women in order to protect them from what I suffered,&quot; she explained. Rather than just filing the motion to dismiss the suit, Allred <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501165815/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2037618/Celebrity-lawyer-Gloria-Allred-claims-men-likely-cheat-women.html">took the opportunity to bash man-kind</a> in general at the press conference: &quot;We believe that men are more likely to lie and cheat in their relationships with women than vice-versa...Often the men in a relationship have more money, they have more power (and) they have more resources of every kind.&quot;</p>

<p>All in all, this was one of Allred&apos;s less controversial press conferences&#x2014;her clients should just be glad that this one didn&apos;t involve Allred <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501165815/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/30/video_gloria_allred_simulates_anal.php">repeatedly simulating anal sex with a baseball bat in front of two nine-year-olds.</a></p>
