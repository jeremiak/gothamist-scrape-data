<p>Yesterday, Triumph The Insult Comic Dog <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509165909/http://gothamist.com/2014/06/25/video_triumph_the_insult_comic_dog_1.php">traveled to various bars around Astoria</a> to soak in the &quot;flashmob of horrible BO&quot; and mess with fans of Colombia, Greece and Uruguay. His World Cup Pooping Tour continued last night in Manhattan, where he celebrated with Ivory Coast fans in East Harlem; encouraged English hooligans to headbutt cannolis; complimented Italian fans for &quot;only groping the women with their feet;&quot; and respectfully insulted Japanese fans: &quot;I have noticed that tonight&apos;s game represents the largest penis size differential in the history of World Cup sports. Arigato, arigato, arigato.&quot;</p>
