<p>A man died early this morning after he cut his hand on a bottle in a Brooklyn restaurant. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429165810/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/man_killed_at_brooklyn_restaurant_isNbwfppt6genKCCAhp8mK?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20Brooklyn">Police say the incident</a> happened before 4 a.m. at La Cabana Rodriguez restaurant on Flatbush Avenue near Beverley Road; the man, who hasn&apos;t been identified yet, fell and injured his right hand on the broken bottle. </p>

<p>The man, who is said to be in his 20s, was rushed to Kings County Hospital, but did not survive. Police add that no criminality is suspected, but they are still investigating the incident. </p>

<p>At first glance, this may seem like a mundane headline, but think about it for a moment: a person <em>died</em> from a seemingly common hand injury. How many times have you nonchalantly cut your hand slicing a bagel and laughed it off? How many times have you seen a smashed up beer bottle on the ground and not given a thought to the shards? All of which is to say, if you&apos;re not familiar with First Aid, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429165810/http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/FirstAidIndex/FirstAidIndex">you should be</a> (you can even <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429165810/http://www.redcross.org/mobile-apps/first-aid-app">download an app</a> if it helps)&#x2014;because it really can make a difference.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: The victim has now been identified as Flatbush resident Miguel Jiminez. Sources <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429165810/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/man_killed_at_brooklyn_restaurant_isNbwfppt6genKCCAhp8mK">told the Post that</a> Jiminez got into a fight over the bill with a friend. At first Jiminez pulled out a machete, but friends say he dropped it and the two fought with their fists. At some point, Jiminez fell, landing on a shard of a broken bottle, which slashed his right bicep open. </p>
