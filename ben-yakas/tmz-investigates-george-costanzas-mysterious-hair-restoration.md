<p>In their biggest scoop since learning that Matthew Fox <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425172906/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/29/matthew_fox_detained_after_punching.php">was detained for punching</a> a vagina, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425172906/http://www.tmz.com/2011/09/24/jason-alexander-the-magical-hair-growth-bald-john-travolta-seinfeld/#.Tn4hNtSLZ5a">TMZ has broken open</a> the story of Jason Alexander&apos;s mysterious hair restoration. Is this a massive betrayal of the bald community? Does this count as a hate crime? Let&apos;s all keep some perspective here: as Larry David, official spokesman and poet emeritus of the bald, so eloquently put it in an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425172906/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/07/12/larry-david-curb-your-enthusiasm_n_895714.html">interview with Huffington Post</a>, it&apos;s hard out there for a bald brother, so cut him some slack: &quot;Most actors don&apos;t let themselves get bald. They get transplants or weaves or something. When&apos;s the last time you saw a bald president? <strong>There&apos;ll be a woman and a Jewish president and maybe even a Muslim president before a bald president.</strong>&quot;</p>
