<p>It&apos;s the single hottest day of the year (and maybe of all-time) in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160823144503/http://laist.com/2013/06/30/the_mercury_hit_125_degrees_in_deat.php">certain parts of the country</a>, which seems like an appropriate way for Mother Nature to celebrate the 24th anniversary of Spike Lee&apos;s seminal film about racial tensions and pizza, <em>Do The Right Thing</em>. The movie, which takes place over the course of one long sweltering day in Bedford-Stuyvesant, still stands as one of Lee&apos;s best films, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160823144503/http://www.nytimes.com/1989/06/30/movies/review-film-spike-lee-tackles-racism-in-do-the-right-thing.html">earned him the reputation</a> as &quot;the most distinctive American multi-threat man since Woody Allen.&quot; Below, you can watch four parts of a behind-the-scenes documentary about the film.</p>
