                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="9113reed.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130909121450im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/9113reed.jpg" width="640" height="620"> <br> <i> Heroes take scooters</i></div> <p></p>

<p>Like a lot of his fellow classic rockers (Bob Dylan, Rolling Stones, Paul McCartney, etc), <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130909121450/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/01/lou_reed_recovering_after_liver_tra.php">triumph of modern medicine</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130909121450/http://gothamist.com/tags/loureed">Lou Reed</a> had a checkered path while traversing the &apos;80s. On the one hand, he produced <em>The Blue Mask</em> and <em>New York</em>, two of his career best albums; on the other hand, this was a period when he released <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130909121450/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMxyIs8MkmU">&quot;The Original Wrapper&quot;</a> as a single off the godawful <em>Mistrial</em>. Depending on how you look at it, this 1984 commercial in which Reed shills for Honda Scooters was either a very high or very low point. &quot;Don&apos;t settle for walking,&quot; he says over glimpses of &apos;80s NYC as &quot;Walk On The Wild Side&quot; hums along.</p>

<p>Then again, this isn&apos;t even close to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130909121450/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/24/video_lou_reed.php">the weirdest thing</a> Reed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130909121450/http://gothamist.com/tags/loutallica">has been involved in.</a></p>
