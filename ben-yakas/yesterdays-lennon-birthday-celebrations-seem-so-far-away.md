Yesterday would have been John Lennon&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502151736/http://gothamist.com/2010/10/09/happy_birthday_john_lennon_1.php">70th birthday</a>, and celebrations and tributes took place across the universe. Ex-wife Cynthia Lennon and son Julien unveiled the &quot;Peace and Love&quot; sculpture in his native Liverpool, England. Yoko Ono was joined by son Sean and Ringo Starr (as well as George Harrison&#x2019;s widow Olivia and son Dhani Harrison, among others) for a performance  with the Plastic Ono Band, and to light the Imagine Peace Tower in Reykjavik, Iceland. And in the city, hundreds gathered at the Strawberry Field memorial, across the street from the Dakota apartment building where Lennon and Ono lived for nearly a decade. You can see a video from yesterday below.</p>
