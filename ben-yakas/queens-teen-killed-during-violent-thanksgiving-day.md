According to police, 18-year-old Eric Norman was found dead of a gunshot wound to the head in the driveway of a home on Beach Channel Drive in Far Rockaway around 10 p.m. Thursday. According <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160213203116/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/shootings-stabbings-queens-staten-island-leave-dead-injured-thanksgiving-article-1.982778">to the Daily News</a>, there were seven other shootings during that 24-hour period.<p></p>

<p>Norman, who has prior arrests for drug offenses, was the only fatality among the 11 people who were shot. Police are still investigating the motive behind the death. In addition to the shootings, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160213203116/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/shootings-stabbings-queens-staten-island-leave-dead-injured-thanksgiving-article-1.982778">there were five stabbing incidents</a> during the 24-hour period, which led to at least one fatality. </p>

<p>The victim, a 26-year-old man who hasn&apos;t been identified by police yet, was walking with a friend in Jamaica, Queens, shortly before midnight when they got into an argument with three men. A third party broke it up, but the three men returned a little later, stabbing the man several times in the torso. His friend was knifed once in the torso and was in stable condition at Jamaica Hospital. The third party who had broken up the fight was also allegedly beaten with a baseball bat.</p>
