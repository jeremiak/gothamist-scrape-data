<p>A 52-year-old woman was followed off the subway, harassed, and violently raped by a man in Rego Park in Queens this week. Police say that the woman was getting off the R Train at the 63rd Drive-Rego Park station around 10 p.m. Friday when the suspect began asking for her name and phone number. After she refused, the suspect followed her into a nearby Rite Aid and started harassing her before walking out of the store.</p>

<p>The suspect then waited for the woman to leave the store, and eventually threw her down a flight of stairs at a nearby address, then raped her. The suspect stole the woman&apos;s cell phone and purse as she screamed. &#x201C;I was coming down out of the building; I hear the screaming,&#x201D; neighbor Adrian Ionas <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131006173045/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2013/08/24/police-suspect-followed-harassed-raped-woman-in-rego-park-queens/">told CBS</a>. &#x201C;She was in shock &#x2014; definitely in shock. And then they put her up in the ambulance, and they took her off.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Another local told CBS, &#x201C;This area is really - it&#x2019;s not like that,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s weird how something like that would happen, because I&#x2019;ve been living here for the past, like, 20 years. It&#x2019;s not like this.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Police describe the suspect as a black male in his 20s, about 5 feet 7 inches tall with a mustache. The suspect also told the victim his name was &#x201C;Junior.&#x201D; Anyone with information in regards to this rape is asked to call the NYPD&apos;s Crime Stoppers Hotline at 800-577-TIPS. The public can also submit their tips by logging onto the <a href=" WWW.NYPDCRIMESTOPPERS.COM">Crime Stoppers Website</a>.</p>
