<p>Last night, Stephen Colbert &quot;celebrated&quot; the decampments of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602114351/http://gothamist.com/tags/occupywallstreet">Occupy Wall Street</a> encampments across the country, most prominently <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602114351/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/15/nypd_evicts_occupy_wall_street_clea.php#photo-1">in Zuccotti Park yesterday</a>. He had particular joy in parsing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602114351/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/15/bloomberg_ows_eviction_decision_was.php">Mayor Bloomberg&apos;s mid-day speech</a> in which he rationalized the removal of protesters&#x2014;because after all, even George Washington knew that the First Amendment wasn&apos;t an absolute right: &quot;The Founders never intended indefinite free speech. They assumed after two weeks any protest would be wiped out by small pox.&quot;</p>

<p>He gave supreme credibility to the idea that OWS was prohibiting other people&#x2019;s free speech (&quot;When a drum circle starts in Zuccotti Park, all other music in New York stops.&#x201D;), thanked Bloomberg for sending in well-adjusted police to handle the situation (&quot;helping the wounded and the sick with his two fists, Florence and Nightingale&quot;), and offered a nightmare-ish look into what could have been the future of OWS, comparing those protesters to their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602114351/http://www.truthdig.com/avbooth/item/raw_video_berkeley_police_beat_students_20111110/">vicious Berkeley compatriots:</a></p>

<blockquote>Let&apos;s remember, these so-called &apos;peaceful protesters&apos; could have turned violent like their fellow Occupiers at UC Berkeley last week. Look at these vicious students attacking these billy clubs with their soft jab-able bellies!</blockquote>
