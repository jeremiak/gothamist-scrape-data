Buell, a former &quot;Teacher of the Year&quot; award winner, is in trouble after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170321210359/http://www.clickorlando.com/news/28899713/detail.html">he wrote on his</a> Facebook page, &quot;I&apos;m watching the news, eating dinner, <strong>when the story about New York okaying same sex unions came on and I almost threw up.</strong>&quot;<p></p>

<p>Buell later posted, &quot;If they want to call it a union, go ahead. <strong>But don&apos;t insult a man and woman&apos;s marriage by throwing it in the same cesspool as same-sex whatever!</strong> God will not be mocked. When did this sin become acceptable???&quot; In response to complaints from Facebook friends about his anti-gay comments, Buell wrote, &quot;If one doesn&apos;t like the most recently posted opinion, based on Biblical principals [sic] and God&apos;s law, then go ahead and un-friend me. I&apos;ll miss you like I miss my kidney stone from 1994.&quot;</p>

<p>Buell, a social studies teacher at Mount Dora High School in Mount Dora, Fla., has been suspended from the school under their new social media policy. &quot;Social media is a minefield. People think they&apos;re free to say what they want to, but in some aspects it can come back to haunt you,&quot; said Chris Patton, communications officer for Lake County schools, who helped develop the guidelines. </p>

<p>The teacher tried to explain his remarks <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170321210359/http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2011-08-17/features/os-teacher-gays-facebook-comments-20110817_1_gay-students-facebook-post-personal-facebook-page">to the Orlando Sentinel</a>, and argued that he had posted on his own time on his personal computer: <strong>&quot;It wasn&apos;t out of hatred. It was about the way I interpret things.&quot;</strong> </p>
