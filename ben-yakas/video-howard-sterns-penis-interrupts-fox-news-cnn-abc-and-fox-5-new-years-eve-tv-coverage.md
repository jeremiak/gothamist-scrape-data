<p>There are a lot of silly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406170708/http://gothamist.com/tags/newyearseve">New Year&apos;s Eve</a> traditions in Times Square, from the dropping of the giant symbolic ball to Bloomberg&apos;s choice of sweaters to the adult humans willingly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406170708/https://twitter.com/jessmisener/status/285830054171271168">wearing adult diapers</a> in order to let loose with over a million other people. So is screaming &quot;Howard Stern&apos;s Penis&quot; and &quot;Jimmy Kimmel&apos;s Sphincter&quot; on national TV really that much stranger? It isn&apos;t for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406170708/http://gothamist.com/tags/joeyboots">Joey Boots</a>, who was able to interrupt FOUR news broadcasts (CNN, Fox News, ABC and Fox 5) Monday afternoon with his impassioned nonsense. ABC might not have been very amused, but he sure made the day for those CNN anchors.</p>
