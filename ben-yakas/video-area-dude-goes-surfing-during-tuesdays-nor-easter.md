<p>Dudes have been known to get extreme during winter weather events in the city, whether that meant <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170318221940/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/09/snow_worries_shirtless_dude_runs_in.php">running shirtless through Central Park</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170318221940/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/23/photos_scenes_from_around_nyc_durin.php#photo-1">cross-country skiing</a> through the street, (literally) chilling inside of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170318221940/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/03/best_blizzard_photo_area_man_relaxe.php">aboveground hot tubs</a>, or snowboarding <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170318221940/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/24/video_extreme_man_hitches_rope_to_e.php">off the back of a Jeep.</a> This week&apos;s nor&apos;easter may have been a bit of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170318221940/http://gothamist.com/2017/03/14/march_blizzard_falls_short.php">a blizzard bust</a>, but at least a few area dudes got their jollies in by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170318221940/http://www.fox5ny.com/news/241634094-story">going surfing off Long Beach.</a> And no one had a better time than Adam Winerip, who crashed a Pix11 live report in the middle of the storm.</p>

<p>He was just floating for a mile in the water, can&apos;t you give him a ride to his car?! &quot;This is like my first time surfing,&quot; he told PIX&apos;s Kristin Cole. &quot;You thought this was the best day to go out surfing, for a first-timer?&quot; she fired back in disbelief. Here&apos;s a slightly longer video with the full segment, including the build up to Winerip&apos;s appearance: </p>

<p>Cole was pretty amazed by the run-in:</p>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Craziest moment of day. Heck the week. Um, scratch: my whole year!! <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170318221940/https://t.co/tDGmAZ8gtH">https://t.co/tDGmAZ8gtH</a></p>&#x2014; Kirstin Cole (@kirstincoletv) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170318221940/https://twitter.com/kirstincoletv/status/841679227124604933">March 14, 2017</a></blockquote>

<p>Of course, Winerip was just havin&apos; a laugh, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170318221940/http://www.surfline.com/surf-news/surfer-trolls-local-news-during-winter-storm_146068/">as he explained to Surfline</a> that he has been surfing since he was 13-years-old, and was an ocean lifeguard in Long Beach and Wrightsville Beach (Long Beach Surf Shop referred to him as &quot;a local legend&quot;). &quot;No one else was in the water, so it was sweet, albeit a bit eerie, to have big cold New York surf all to myself,&quot; he told Surfline. &quot;I worked for years on the beach where the train pours out from the city. I&apos;m not kidding when I say that a first time surfer during a Nor&apos;Easter would be far from the most absurd thing to go down on the beach in New York.&quot;</p>

<p>As for whether he was planning on trolling any TV newspeople, he said he didn&apos;t even realize he was live on TV until he got home 20 minutes later. &quot;They were waving me over as I was walking and they must have started the broadcast while I was in route,&quot; he said. &quot;I had no idea they were live. There was no &apos;hey can we interview you?&apos; As I said before, the entirety of the interaction happened on camera. They even got me walking away. Before I paddled out I told my buddy Josh that I was going to surf National to get on the news (that&apos;s where the vans usually hang out during storms). I was only half serious. I was daydreaming a bit in the water about what I would say if I got interviewed.&quot;</p>

<p>Cole took the whole thing in stride, and was particularly delighted the whole thing made <em>Jimmy Kimmel Live</em>:</p>

<p>Oh, and as for how Winerip ended up getting home, he did indeed hitch a ride&#x2014;but not with PIX: &quot;I was able to hitch a ride with the Commissioner of Public Works for Long Beach,&quot; he said. &quot;He was headed East and let me jump in the front seat all wet. Really nice guy. He even hooked me up with a bagel. His name is John Mirando and I met him yesterday. So shoutout to John. If you&apos;re reading this, you&apos;re the real legend.&quot;</p>

<p>The real moral of this story can be summarized thusly:</p>

<p>And if you want one last look at the blizzard-that-wasn&apos;t, this video condenses the entire thing into 10 quick seconds:</p>
