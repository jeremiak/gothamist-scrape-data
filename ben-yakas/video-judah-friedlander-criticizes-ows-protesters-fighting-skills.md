<p>Drummers and marchers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141006044050/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/20/occupy_wall_street_returns_to_zucco.php">weren&apos;t the only ones</a> who returned to Zuccotti Park this week&#x2014;on Friday, comedian and actor (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141006044050/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/08/judah_friedlander_talks.php">and friend-of-Gothamist</a>) Judah Friedlander went down to show support with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141006044050/http://gothamist.com/tags/occupywallstreet">Occupy Wall Street</a>. He also tried to figure out whether he&apos;s part of the 1% or not, and expressed his belief that the protests at UC Davis would have gone a bit differently with a few extra karate chops: &quot;It was a bad display of fighting skills all around. And the aliens, when they invade, who is gonna be there to fight back?&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141006044050/http://www.youtube.com/user/JoeysNewYork">Joey Boots</a> ended up talking to him about the video of UC Davis police <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141006044050/http://sfist.com/2011/11/19/uc_davis_police_brutally_pepper_spray_student_protesters_video.php">brutally pepper spraying student protesters</a>. Friedlander, writer of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141006044050/http://www.judahfriedlander.com/home2.htm">inspirational Karate book</a> &quot;How To Beat Anybody,&quot; was most concerned about the lack of karate chops&#x2014;after all, as everyone knows, aliens <em>are</em> immune to both pepper spray and non-violent protest: </p>

<p>&quot;The kids are just sitting there doing nothing, obviously they don&apos;t know karate. And the fat cops were there just spraying them with stuff, they don&apos;t know karate either. It was a bad display of fighting skills all around. And the aliens, when they invade, who is gonna be there to fight back?&quot; </p>
