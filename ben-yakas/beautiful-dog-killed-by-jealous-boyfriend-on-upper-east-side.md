                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="71013dog.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130930081949im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/71013dog.jpeg" width="640" height="480"> <br> <i> Max</i></div> <p></p>

<p>A dog who was a canine model <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130930081949/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/innocent-dog-killed-vicious-love-triangle-article-1.1394591">was struck and killed</a> by a jealous boyfriend who was allegedly attempting to run over the ex-boyfriend of his girlfriend. Max, a 7-year-old Siberian Husky who was the face of Psyberia Dry Goods clothing line, was fatally pinned against scaffolding at E. 88th St. and Lexington Ave. just before 8 a.m. Sunday. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s ridiculous that he did this over a girl,&quot; owner Dejan Piskacek <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130930081949/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/victim_of_love_LvPRQNlvOtD0QPpESK4e1N">told the Post</a>. &quot;He knew killing my dog would hurt me.&quot;</p>

<p>Wilfredo Vega, 23, was allegedly trying to run over Piskacek, 32, because the two were involved in a love triangle with Vega&apos;s current girlfriend, 22-year-old Angibel Martinez. Piskacek and Martinez were walking Max that morning when Vega either tracked them down or ran into them, and an argument ensued. &#x201C;He threatened to beat me with a baseball bat. He said, &#x2018;You&#x2019;re a b----,&#x2019; flicked a cigarette at me and tried to run me down. I said to him, &#x2018;Let&#x2019;s talk to her and see what she wants to do&#x2019;...I was being a gentleman,&#x201D; Piskacek <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130930081949/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/innocent-dog-killed-vicious-love-triangle-article-1.1394591">told the News</a>.</p>

<p>Martinez eventually got into the car with Vega, but he still tried to run over Piskacek; he missed, tried again, and hit Max instead. Vega &#x201C;broke every bone in Max&#x2019;s body. Max just looks at me and slowly starts passing. He just looks at me like, &#x2018;What&#x2019;s happening?&#x2019; &#x201D; Piskacek told the Post. &#x201C;He didn&#x2019;t even bark. [Vega] squeezed the life out of him.&quot;</p>

<p>Vega, who told cops the dog&apos;s death was an accident, has been charged with attempted assault, reckless endangerment and overdriving, torturing and injuring an animal. He was previously arrested in January for punching his sister at his Queens home, and charged with attacking another person with a baseball bat in Brooklyn.</p>
