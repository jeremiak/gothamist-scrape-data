										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="4711jury.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405014111im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/4711jury.jpg" width="250" height="371" class="image-left"> </span>We all thought that Robert De Niro&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405014111/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/19/deniro_testifies_about_art_fraud_ca.php">testimony</a> in court would prove to be the most dramatic moment in the art theft trial of a gallery director accused of pocketing $77,000 from the sale of De Niro&apos;s father&apos;s paintings. But it turns out that all the really nutty, overly-dramatic stuff was actually going on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405014111/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/fellow_juror_pompous_hillary_acquit_EsM4vCZgWR9UcomXvMgvAL?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">behind-the-scenes</a> between deliberating jurors who name-dropped Hillary Clinton, cursed at each other, and brought 20 million Afghan refugees into the mix.</p>

<p>It sounds like the four days of deliberations in the trial of gallery director Leigh Morse, who De Niro claimed stole two of his father&apos;s paintings, sold them, and pocketed the profits for herself, were wrought with tension and anger. Juror Stanley Cohen <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405014111/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/fellow_juror_pompous_hillary_acquit_EsM4vCZgWR9UcomXvMgvAL?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">told the Post</a> that he wanted to convict Morse of grand larceny, but he was pressured out of his vote by four &quot;emotional&quot; female jurors, led by Maureen White, who was the most &quot;agitated.&quot; He claims that White was in a mad rush to escape the courthouse, so much so that she <strong>&quot;bragged about knowing Hillary Clinton [and] kept saying that 20 million people are in trouble in Afghanistan because she was here.&quot;</strong> White is a voluntary adviser on refugee affairs for the State Department, and wife of Wall Street financier Steven Rattner. </p>

<p>White admits she lost her temper with Cohen, did complain that she needed to get back to the refugees, and called Cohen a &quot;child&quot; at one point, but she says that she and the other jurors agreed that Cohen is a &quot;crackpot.&quot; &quot;He kept saying Morse is a thief, that she&apos;s a crook, that she&apos;s living the high life. He&apos;d say, &apos;She&apos;s indicted. She must be guilty.&apos; <strong>And he wouldn&apos;t pay attention to actual facts. He&apos;s a very, very sad human being,</strong>&quot; White told the Post. Jury foreman Robert Lubeck agreed with her assessment (or just has a big ole crush on White): &quot;I don&apos;t think that her behavior was anything outlandish. She&apos;s a very elegant woman. To make her out to be anything but that is wrong, and inaccurate.&quot;</p>

<p>In the end, Morse was acquitted of the grand larceny charge, but convicted of helping her boss Lawrence Salander (who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405014111/http://gothamist.com/2010/08/04/scheming_fraudulent_art_dealer_sent.php">is serving</a> six years in prison already) defraud other art owners in the $120 million scheme. She&apos;ll face up to four years in prison at sentencing. For his part, Cohen is guilt-ridden that he wasn&apos;t able to help De Niro get justice: &quot;<strong>Tell Mr. De Niro I&apos;m sorry. I tried to get a conviction. It was hopeless.&quot;</strong></p>
