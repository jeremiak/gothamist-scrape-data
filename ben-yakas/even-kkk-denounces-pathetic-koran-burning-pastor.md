Many people blamed the media, and us, for giving a radical, unsubstantial rabble-rouser any attention in the first place. So why are we writing about him again? Because even the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160208020454/http://americanindependent.com/180551/even-the-kkk-deplores-terry-jones-calls-koran-burning-un-american">KKK thinks he&apos;s</a> &quot;ignorant,&quot; &quot;despicable&quot; and &quot;Un-American.&quot; And also because his gun accidentally fired as he was leaving a TV studio last night, and that&apos;s kind of funny.</p>

<p>Jones is in Michigan this weekend&#x2014;he had planned a demonstration against Islamic law in front of the nation&apos;s largest mosque, Dearborn&apos;s Islamic Center of America, today. But he was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160208020454/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703387904576278754067652370.html?mod=googlenews_wsj">tied up</a> while a state court jury deliberated as to whether or not he could, despite being denied a city permit to do so. While killing time, Jones did a TV interview with Fox2; as he was leaving the studio, his gun <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160208020454/http://www.freep.com/article/20110422/NEWS02/110422012/Police-Terry-Jones-accidentally-fired-gun-Southfield-TV-station-parking-lot">went off</a> in his car, putting a bullet into the floorboard. As if that weren&apos;t enough of a sign from the universe to get out of town, Dearborn Mayor Jack O&apos;Reilly Jr. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160208020454/http://tpmmuckraker.talkingpointsmemo.com/2011/04/quran-burning_pastors_gun_accidentally_goes_off_in.php?ref=fpi">wrote in an open letter</a> to Jones: &quot;So, you are coming to protest against an imaginary threat that doesn&apos;t exist in our community.&quot; </p>

<p>And to pour more salt onto the wound, Reddit users discovered a series of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160208020454/http://americanindependent.com/180551/even-the-kkk-deplores-terry-jones-calls-koran-burning-un-american">press releases</a> from the Ku Klux Klan denouncing Jones:</p>

<blockquote>There are without doubt Islamic sects that teach extreme views of Islam but, going down to their level of hatred by burning their books is a dangerous and ignorant way to confront their teachings. The flames made by such unholy fires never die out! The Ku Klux Klan, LLC. opposes this most un-American thinking and activity.</blockquote>

<p>When you make the KKK sound reasonable, you know you&apos;re doing something really wrong.</p>
