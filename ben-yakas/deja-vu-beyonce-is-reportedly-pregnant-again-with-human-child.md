<p>It&apos;s time for a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144510/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/07/video_have_you_heard_beyonces_new_v.php">COUNTDOWN</a>, because Jay-Z didn&apos;t put a condom on it, and now <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144510/http://gothamist.com/tags/beyonce">Beyonc&#xE9;</a> is reportedly pregnant again. After a week <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144510/http://gawker.com/holy-shit-beyonce-is-pregnant-the-baby-conspirace-the-504881547">filled with speculation</a> about her ovaries, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144510/http://www.eonline.com/news/418692/beyonc-pregnant-singer-expecting-baby-no-2-with-jay-z">multiple sources tell E</a> that Beyonc&#xE9; is expecting her second child. If Blue Ivy is the &quot;Crazy In Love&quot; of Beyonc&#xE9;&apos;s womb, does this mean that Unnamed Baby #2 will be the &quot;Baby Boy&quot;? </p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144510/http://www.nypost.com/p/pagesix/baby_no_3Df3DGXjaUgqSJx3UdPWAO">Post published</a> some rumors about the possible pregnancy on Monday; then on Tuesday, Beyonc&#xE9; canceled a Belgium concert due to &#x201C;dehydration and exhaustion.&#x201D; So it was right there in front of our faces, and we couldn&apos;t see the pattern. Unless this is just another elaborate ruse to cover up the fact that Beyonc&#xE9; is using a surrogate to cover up the fact that Solange is actually pregnant and Beyonc&#xE9; is going to be a grandmother <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144510/http://www.buzzfeed.com/jessicamisener/is-solange-knowles-actually-beyonces-daughter">because she is actually Solange&apos;s mother</a> because CONSPIRACY.</p>

<p>Beyonc&#xE9; may have a tough time following up her debut baby, considering she&apos;ll have to top the name Blue Ivy&#x2014;but she need not worry about it too much, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144510/http://beybeyname.com/">thanks to the Bey Bey Name Generator</a>. Whether it&apos;s a boy or girl or full diva, Scarlet Mustard will do just fine we think. </p>
