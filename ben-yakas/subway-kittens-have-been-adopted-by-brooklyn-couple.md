<p>Like the old saying goes, you cat nap you lose: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151205072209/http://gothamist.com/tags/subwaykittens">the adorable kittens who brought subway service to a standstill in Brooklyn</a> for several hours last month after they were spotted frolicking on the train tracks have officially been adopted by a married couple in Brooklyn. And you&apos;ll never guess which mayoral candidate the couple is supporting (hint: not the one <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151205072209/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/31/joe_lhota_would_have_let_subway_kit.php">who is able to justify cat-murder</a>). </p>

<p>Hundreds of people applied to adopt 11-week-old kittens August and Arthur, but Katherine and Keith Lubely were the ones who lucked out. &quot;We don&apos;t really know what made us stand out, since the application didn&apos;t exactly have an essay question,&quot; they <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151205072209/http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2013/10/brooklyn-couple-adopts-subway-kittens-interview.html">told Daily Intel</a>. &quot;Maybe our desire to help rescue animals came through in the few words we were allotted to describe our interest in these guys. That and the fact that we&apos;ve each been cat owners in the past, live in a relatively quiet place, and don&apos;t have kids or other pets.&quot;</p>

<p>Otherwise, the cats <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151205072209/https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.613627698681039.1073741841.125204517523362&amp;type=3">are getting acclimated</a> to their new environment:</p>

<blockquote>August (the black one) is the more adventurous one so far. He has big plans. He has also shown a noticeable preference for freeze-dried cod snacks. Arthur (the gray one) is pretty shy still, but once you&apos;re in with him he is a grade-A cuddler. What&apos;s sweet is that August wants Arthur to come along for all his adventures. He&apos;s not content until his brother is having a good time, too.</blockquote>

<p>Oh, and in case it wasn&apos;t terribly obvious, the Lubely&apos;s are &quot;for sure&quot; supporting Bill de Blasio.</p>
