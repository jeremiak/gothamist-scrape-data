<p>The Empire State Building <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140702082025/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/29/photos_empire_state_building_goes_r.php#photo-1">is multi-colored</a> and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140702082025/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/29/nsfw_foreskin_pride_activists_will.php">Foreskin activists</a> are on their way, which means Pride Weekend is really here. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140702082025/http://gothamist.com/tags/ladygaga">Lady Gaga</a> kicked things off in stirring fashion last night at Pier 26 by singing &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140702082025/http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/music-arts/lady-gaga-moving-speech-gay-pride-rally-article-1.1385915">giving an emotional speech</a> while carrying a rainbow flag: &quot;We are not a niche. We are a part, a big giant part of humanity,&quot; Gaga said. &quot;It&apos;s time for us to be mainstream. I demand the rights! To safe streets!&quot;</p>

<p>Gaga, who was making her first public appearance since she was forced to cancel her &quot;Born This Way&apos; tour due to a hip injury, recounted feeling like an outcast in high school, and how the LGBT community embraced her: &quot;There was a particular crowd who did accept me,&quot; she continued. &quot;There was a particular crowd who made room for me at their table, who held me up when I felt I couldn&apos;t, who loved me for exactly who I was. It was you. You saved me, my friends in the LGBT community, time and time again. And I saw God for the first real time in all of you.&quot;</p>

<p>She also referred to the string of hate crimes against gay people that hit NYC over the last two months: &quot;The violence that has taken place towards LGBTs in the past months is unacceptable here and anywhere,&quot; the singer added.</p>
