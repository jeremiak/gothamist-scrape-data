<p>Are you an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130510154611/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/21/photo_google_co-founder_sports_proj.php">Augmented Reality enthusiast</a>? Do you have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130510154611/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/13/google_glasses_spotted_in_the_east.php">Cyborg envy</a>? Are you sick and tired of companies not taking your damn money already? Well here&apos;s your chance to get in front of the latest technological achievement of mankind: Google is looking for a few people to become &quot;Google Explorers&quot; and try out their Google Glasses...but it&apos;ll cost you $1500.</p>

<p>Google launched <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130510154611/http://www.google.com/glass/start/">a new site for the glasses</a> this week, which gives you a brief introduction to the technology that will one day make you a prime target for subway thieves:</p>

<p>But for anyone whose interest is already piqued by the idea of flashing some attention-sucking face gear, the really exciting part is that you don&apos;t have to cryogenically freeze yourself for a year to get your hands on a pair: all you have to do is explain to Google why you&apos;d make for an enthusiastic guinea pig! </p>

<p>You can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130510154611/http://www.google.com/glass/start/how-to-get-one/">read all the instructions here</a>; you&apos;ll have until February 27th to come up with the right tweets (FINE: or Google pluses) to convince them you are up to the task of wearing Videodrome on your face. But at least you know it&apos;ll be stylish: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130510154611/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/21/technology/google-looks-to-make-its-computer-glasses-stylish.html?_r=0">the New York Times reports</a> Google is working on a deal with snazzy glasses company Warby Parker to &quot;help [Google] design more fashionable frames.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130510154611/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/02/photo_bloomberg_cements_hipster_cre.php">If it worked for Bloomberg</a>, it can work for anyone.</p>
