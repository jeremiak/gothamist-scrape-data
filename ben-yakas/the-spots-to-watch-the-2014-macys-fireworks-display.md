<p>We&apos;ve already told you where you can watch <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150710072636/http://gothamist.com/2014/07/01/nyc_fireworks_2014.php">various fireworks displays around the city</a> tonight, as well as where you can check out some less-than-legal firework displays as well. But that doesn&apos;t quite help if you really want to take in the big shebang: the The 35th Macy&#x2019;s Firework Display, which returns to the East River this year after a brief affair with the West Side. The event starts at about 9:20 p.m. and ends at 9:50 p.m. And below, you can find out all the best spots to view it from, as well as all the relevant street closures.</p>

<p><strong>Where To Watch:</strong> Starting at 4 p.m., New Yorkers can get access to public viewing section on elevated portions of the FDR drive. There are unobstructed views of the sky above the East River over there. The City notes that access points will be closed as the areas fill up (so get there early!), and dogs are NOT allowed in the area. Here are the access points:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Montgomery &amp; South Streets - from the North  (viewing along the FDR between Manhattan Bridge and Montgomery Street)</li>
	<li>Brooklyn Bridge entry from St. James Pl. (Pearl St) &amp; Wagner Pl. (viewing both north &amp; South of the Brooklyn Bridge)</li>
	<li>Broad Street and/or Old Slip at Water Street (viewing between Heliport &amp; south side of Brooklyn Bridge)</li>
	<li>Murray Bertraum HS track and Field facility - at the base of the Manhattan Bridge entrance at Market &amp; Cherry Streets</li>
</ul>

<p>You can also see the display from Brooklyn Bridge Park, South Street Seaport, Brooklyn Heights Promenade, and other parts of the east side of Lower Manhattan. But keep in mind that parts of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150710072636/http://gothamist.com/2014/07/03/some_williamsburg_greenpoint_waterf.php">Greenpoint and Williamsburg waterfront</a> (including North 5th Street Pier, Transmitter Park&apos;s Pier, the upper portion (sloped roof) of Bushwick Inlet Park, and the water&apos;s edge at Grand Ferry Park) will not be accessible.</p>
