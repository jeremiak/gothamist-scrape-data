<p>Our feelings on subway dancing have been well-documented: we generally love when <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150214071211/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/03/everybody_dance_now_videos_of_peopl.php">inspired people get a little funky</a>, but hate when it becomes a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150214071211/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/11/please_stop_with_the_subway_dance_p.php">big dangerous congregation of sweaty bodies on the platform</a>. But breakdancers in subway cars are a whole other beast, and two of them felt the long arm of the law last week.</p>

<p>The NYPD says Shamik Watson, 20, and Andrew Washington, 18, were arrested last Friday for breakdancing on a crowded northbound A train around 12:30 in the afternoon (a.k.a. Showtime). A plainclothes officer who was riding the train spotted the two, and apparently his heart wasn&apos;t moved by their dancing and somersaulting. </p>

<p>Both men have been charged with reckless endangerment for dancing. A police source explained <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150214071211/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20140102/greenwich-village/duo-arrested-for-dancing-on-crowded-subway-car-police-said">to DNAInfo that</a> they &quot;caused a hazard to themselves and others around them, and made excessive noise by blaring music from a stereo.&quot; </p>

<p>This is another reminder that you should be very careful about how you <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150214071211/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjqfGe_80Ck">swivel your hips in Bomont, New York.</a> Then again, if you can pull off the Charleston, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150214071211/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/20/city_pays_75k_to_couple_arrested_fo.php">it might be worth the risk.</a></p>
