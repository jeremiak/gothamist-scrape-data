<p>A Bangaldeshi man claims that he was beaten up on Monday evening hours after the Boston marathon bombings because a group of attackers thought he was &quot;Arab.&quot; Bronx resident Abdullah Faruque, 30, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130522114221/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/bronx/bx_idiots_beat_up_arab_in_revenge_76qKozmZwDUpLUbacqqP3O">told the Post that</a> he was at an Applebee&#x2019;s in the Melrose section of Bronx around 11:30 p.m. Monday when &quot;three or four Hispanic guys&quot; got in his face: &quot;One of the guys asked if I was Arab. I just shook my head, said like, &apos;Yeah, whatever.&apos; I didn&apos;t even know that [the] Boston [bombing] happened because I had a busy day,&quot; Faruque said.</p>

<p>Faruque said he was about to go inside when one man said, &#x201C;Yeah, he&#x2019;s a f--king Arab.&#x201D; The group then attacked him, punching him on the head and body, dislocating his left shoulder and leaving him semiconscious. &#x201C;Before I could grab the door, they started swinging at me,&#x201D; he said of the 90-second beatdown. &#x201C;I&#x2019;ve been jumped before. If you can&#x2019;t win, you back up, you try to protect yourself.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Despite the NY Post being less-than-stellar lately with their reportage on the evens surrounding the bombing, Farauque is the one who thinks his beating was related to the deadly event. When he got home later that evening, he saw news reports about what had happened that day: &#x201C;<strong>I saw the news, and then it hits me: That&#x2019;s why I got jumped</strong>,&#x201D; he added. Police told us no arrests have been made, but confirmed it was being investigated as a possible hate crime.</p>
