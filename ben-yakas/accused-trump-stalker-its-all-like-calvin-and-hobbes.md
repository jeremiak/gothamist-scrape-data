<p>Yesterday, it was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130616021141/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/04/ivanka_trump_fake_stalker_now_a_rea.php">reported</a> that Ivanka Trump enthusiast Justin Massler, aka Cloud Starchaser, had gone from being an alleged stalker to becoming a real fugitive, after he didn&apos;t show up for at least two court dates in Manhattan in the past few months. We spoke to Massler, who is currently in Nevada, and asked him why he didn&apos;t make it to his court date: &quot;I basically am just real low on cash and I lost my I.D. recently so I couldn&apos;t get a plane ticket. I was really hoping they would just be like, &apos;Well, you know, it&apos;s a minor case, so let&apos;s just drop it,&apos; but no, they want to go and issue a warrant, and now I&apos;m a f---ing fugitive.&quot;</p>

<p>Massler, who describes himself as a &quot;fake stalker,&quot; explained to us that he thought he was being hounded because part of his performance art included &quot;writing that I was like the Jewish Messiah,&quot; which he believes angered Trump&apos;s husband, <em>The Observer</em> owner Jared Kushner, who is an observant Jew. This also leads into why Massler is reluctant to accept the plea deal offered by prosecutors, which would include a year of psych treatment:</p>

<blockquote>As for the prosecutors deal, the thing is this: I am not mentally ill and I never was. They want me to accept &quot;mental health treatment&quot; for problems I don&apos;t actually have.

<p>The problem is, prior to this Ivanka Trump Stalking Act, I was also working on a book project about psych wards, and I got myself thrown in a bunch of psych wards intentionally to do research for the book. So as a result, <strong>I have like a long history of being in different psych wards, but it&apos;s all just you know, book research, like Joaquin Phoenix when he flipped out on Dave Letterman, and it turned out to be a documentary.<br>
</strong><br>
And then you know I did the whole King of the Jews routine in a psych ward, and they diagnosed me as schizophrenic: that&apos;s actually why I got that diagnosis, because the psychiatrist is like, &quot;What do you do?&quot;</p>

<p>And I&apos;m like, &quot;Oh basically, I&apos;m the King of Israel, just working on a mission to bring peace to the Middle East with God&apos;s help, also thinking of traveling to Mars later,&quot; and then he all writes, &quot;The subject is delusional, believing himself to be the King of the Jews and a Space Captain.&quot;</p>

<p>I mean to me, it&apos;s all like Calvin and Hobbes, like when Calvin pretended to be Spaceman Spiff. Like I just feel like you can pretend to be the King of Israel, like in make believe, but I guess no one believes in Make Believe anymore.</p>

<p>...<br>
 <br>
Why can&apos;t we just pretend to be the King of the Jews if we want, like you know, Calvin from Calvin and Hobbes pretending to be a Space Captain? To me, honestly, this is all like a game of make believe, and I&apos;m just tired of adults taking the world so seriously. I don&apos;t see the need to be so serious all the time.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>At the core of the problem, Massler told us he is bored, and that boredom (which stems from his &quot;level of intelligence&quot;) is what led to him dropping out of Phillip Exeter Academy, and not attending Harvard (he compares himself to janitorial math genius Will Hunting, from the movie <em>Good Will Hunting</em>, at one point): &quot;I&apos;m not jealous of Ivanka or Jared&apos;s world: I just hate the fact that the world is run by idiots. I honestly have very little respect for Ivanka, Kushner, Donald Trump: the government. I feel like they&apos;re all fools.&quot;</p>
