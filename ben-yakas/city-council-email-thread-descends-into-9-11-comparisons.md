<p>An <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509170931/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/12/22/2010-12-22_councilwoman_melissa_markviverito_stirs_up_tension_among_pols_by_supporting_puer.html">email thread</a> between city council members regarding a Puerto Rican radical ended up in exactly the kind of appropriate place you&apos;d imagine reasonable city council members might take it: the magical land of hyperbolic 9/11 comparisons. </p>

<p>Councilwoman Melissa Mark-Viverito sent out an email asking her colleagues to support the parole of Oscar Lopez Rivera, a leader of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509170931/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuerzas_Armadas_de_Liberaci%C3%B3n_Nacional_Puertorrique%C3%B1a">FALN</a>, who she described as a political prisoner &quot;not accused of causing harm or taking a life.&quot; But Queens Republican Dan Halloran was outraged at the notion, and sent off an angry response to the entire council: &quot;This terrorist, like all terrorists, should rot in jail forever...I guess the 9-11 bombers could make the same argument. They were merely responding to the &apos;evils&apos; of the U.S. Will you be asking for them to be pardoned too?&quot; Mark-Viverito called Halloran&apos;s 9/11 comparison &quot;overblown, inappropriate and offensive.&quot; Hyperbolic Halloran is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509170931/http://gothamist.com/tags/danhalloran">best known</a> for his crusade to take down power-hungry Traffic Agent &quot;Big Bad Dan&quot; Chu...and for maybe being a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509170931/http://gothamist.com/2009/11/02/queens_council_race_descends_into_p.php">pagan.</a></p>
