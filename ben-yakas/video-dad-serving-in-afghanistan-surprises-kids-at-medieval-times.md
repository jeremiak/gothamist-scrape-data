<p>Medieval Times is a joyous place under just about any circumstances, but it was especially so for two NJ children yesterday when they were reunited with their father who has been serving in Afghanistan since November. &quot;I thought it was just a knight that someone was going to come out and we would have to fight him,&quot; 10-year-old Troy <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150103064456/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2014/04/17/new-jersey-staff-sergeant-surprises-family-at-medieval-times/">told CBS about the surprise reunion</a> with his dad, Staff Sgt. Deavin Lee. &quot;It made me feel really happy inside because he was back.&quot; WARNING: it may get a tad bit dusty wherever you are, unless you&apos;re a robot, in which case you should probably have your oil changed.</p>

<p>Troy and his 7-year-old sister Alayna weren&apos;t expecting their father home until Saturday; he&apos;s been gone &quot;for like 106 days&quot; according to Alayna, which god damn, is a hell of a way of putting it. &quot;It was a pretty unbelievable moment,&quot; Lee said. &quot;Like just seeing their faces, like when they finally recognized me. It took a couple seconds, but once it hit them who was actually in front of them, it was a pretty unbelievable moment.&quot; </p>

<p>Lee will get to spend at least three months at home before being redeployed. Now go call your mother and/or father and/or grandparent and tell them you love them you ninny.</p>
