<p>Every year or so, somebody freaks out about the scourge of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501163525/http://gothamist.com/tags/fightclub">organized Facebook fight clubs</a>, sending visions of floppy armed teenagers pulverizing each other&apos;s faces into the minds of parents everywhere. But while <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501163525/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/27/nj_high_school_officials_get_freake.php">NJ high schoolers got in trouble</a> just for <em>uploading</em> random fight videos to a Facebook page last year, Brooklyn police think something slightly more serious may be going on in Fort Greene: &quot;Fight club is organized by kids on Facebook and Twitter, and then they get in a circle and they fight. And where they like to fight is by the mall,&quot; Capt. Peter Fiorillo of the 88th Precinct <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501163525/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20140523/fort-greene/fight-club-outside-atlantic-center-mall-eyed-by-nypd">told DNAInfo.</a></p>

<p>The fighting is reportedly happening just behind the Atlantic Terminal mall, around a windy street near Hanson Place and South Elliott Place. Resident Stephanie Seto, who lives on the corner, says she&apos;s seen dozens of teens gather there between 3-5 p.m. to duke it out: &quot;It&apos;s like watching <em>Fight Club</em> the movie with two kids getting ready to fight and a circle around them,&quot; she said.</p>

<p>Fiorillo said police became extra concerned after someone brought a gun and fired shots in the area on April 18th. &quot;Fortunately no one was hit,&quot; he added, noting no one had been arrested yet and cops are still trying to monitor social media for upcoming fights. &quot;We&apos;ll hear word of a fight and we&apos;ll follow them all day until they get to the trains and head home,&quot; he said. &quot;When we get intelligence that something big is about to happen, we deploy there.&quot;</p>

<p>While we don&apos;t approve of teenage fight clubs (or any fight clubs, except perhaps those that involve <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501163525/http://gothamist.com/2010/02/03/in_tough_times_finance_dudes_duke_i.php">overstressed finance bros punching each other in their faces</a>), we <em>do</em> approve of anything that gets teens back in America&apos;s malls! It was getting <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501163525/http://qz.com/197740/american-teens-dont-hang-out-at-malls-anymore-they-eat-at-restaurants/">mighty dark there for awhile.</a></p>
