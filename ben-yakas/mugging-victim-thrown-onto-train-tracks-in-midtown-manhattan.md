<p>A man was shoved onto the train tracks in midtown Manhattan after getting into a fight with a mugger over his iPhone. According to police, the victim was on a Queens-bound E train around 11:30 p.m. Saturday when the mugger attempted to steal his iPhone and wallet. The two struggled as the train was pulling into the Lexington Avenue-53rd Street station. </p>

<p>The fight spilled onto the platform as the man tried to hold onto his property; after the train pulled out of the station, the victim was shoved onto the tracks. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717103647/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local/new_york&amp;id=9124311">According to ABC</a>, the mugger took off with the wallet, though it&apos;s unclear if he also got the phone.
