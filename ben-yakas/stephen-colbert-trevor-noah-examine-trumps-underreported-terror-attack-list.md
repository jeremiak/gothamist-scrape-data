<p>The Trump administration released a list of &quot;under-reported&quot; terror attacks this week in an attempt to neutralize an overwhelming backlash against their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170914120248/http://gothamist.com/tags/muslimban">immigration and refugee ban</a>, as well as the uproar over Kellyanne Conway&apos;s stunning <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170914120248/http://gothamist.com/tags/bowlinggreenmassacre">fabrication of a terrorist attack</a> in Bowling Green, Kentucky. Except, of course, most of those attacks cited by Trump as under-reported were in fact <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170914120248/http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/07/politics/white-house-terror-attack-list-trump/">well-covered by the media</a>&#x2014;and the administration is still <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170914120248/http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2017/02/08/sean-spicer-makes-up-atlanta-islamist-attack.html">making up fake ones</a> anyway!</p>

<p>As Stephen Colbert pointed out last night, that isn&apos;t the only problem with the list: &quot;The list is loaded with typos like, &apos;attaker&apos; instead of &apos;attacker,&apos; and &apos;Denmakr&apos; instead of &apos;Denmark.&apos; So at least we know Steve Bannon isn&apos;t a grammar Nazi.&quot; Watch below as Colbert points out what&apos;s missing from the list (after all, Colbert is a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170914120248/http://gothamist.com/2017/02/07/colbert_bowling_green_massacre.php">Bowling Green Massacre truther</a>) and dives into Trump&apos;s bathrobe fetish.</p>

<p>Colbert also had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170914120248/http://gothamist.com/tags/johnoliver">John Oliver</a> on as a guest, and they talked about his own immigration status and fears over deportation. He also had some comforting words about the end of the American empire: &quot;If you&apos;re at the tipping point of an empire, then enjoy the dissent, that&apos;s the key thing,&quot; he said. &quot;You get blamed for everything when you&apos;re number one. No one&apos;s pointing at us anymore, we&apos;re irrelevant. Yes, that hurts on the surface, but it&apos;s actually a release, if you really you think about it. Nothing&apos;s our fault anymore, other than historically everything is still fundamentally our fault. Almost every global flashpoint can be traced back to a mustachioed British man drawing a straight line on a map going, &apos;There we go, learn to live with it.&apos;&quot;</p>

<p>Trevor Noah at The Daily Show also dove into the underreported terror list, and he focused on what was missing: &quot;If Trump wants to talk about ignoring terror attacks, let&apos;s start with the terror attacks he&apos;s ignoring,&quot; Noah said. &quot;Because what stands out about this list is that, like an ashy knee&apos;s anonymous meeting, there were no white people in this. No Dylann Roof, no Planned Parenthood shooter, no Pennsylvania barracks attacker, and it&apos;s not like the Trump people didn&apos;t see these attacks, they just don&apos;t like to talk about them.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So here we are once again learning that when a Muslim person commits terror, it&apos;s part of a deadly conspiracy, but when white extremists commit acts of terror over and over again, well that&apos;s merely a continuing series of isolated events,&quot; he added. &quot;It&apos;s like saying, &apos;I&apos;m not addicted to bath salts, that happened one time over 100 consecutive days. That&apos;s all it is, I&apos;m not addicted baby, I&apos;m cool.&apos;&quot;</p>

And to round things out, Seth Meyers followed up on a different thread that maybe has been lost amidst the daily news cycle washing machine that just makes everything dirtier: Trump&apos;s executive order freezing federal hiring on veterans. &quot;This whole thing is just another example of Trump signing these executive orders at haste without thinking about the consequences, and in turn leaving a trail of chaos,&quot; Meyers said. &quot;At first I thought he was just showing off his signature, but now I think he&apos;s going, &apos;Hey, can someone read this to me, I think this might be a terrible idea.&apos;&quot;</p>
