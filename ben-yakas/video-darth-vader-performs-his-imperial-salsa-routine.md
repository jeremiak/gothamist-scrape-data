<p>Between the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160622153623/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/22/darth_vader_robs_bank_photos_oh_yes.php">bank robberies</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160622153623/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/11/is_this_the_greatest_ny_times_parod.php">victory speeches</a>, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160622153623/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/14/princess_leia_meets_darth_vader_on.php#photo-7">subway rides</a>, the Dark Lord of the Sith sure does seem like a regular around these parts.

We keep wondering: what would it take to get Dancing Darth Vader and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160622153623/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/26/nathan_stodola_boba_fett_accordioni.php">Boba Fett Accordionist</a> guy to start a band?</p>
