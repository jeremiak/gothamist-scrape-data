<p>Cops have been known to get a little <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429100045/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/01/video_power-drunk_long_island_cop_a.php">camera shy</a>, to the point of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429100045/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/21/video_cops_harass_man_for_legally_v.php">camera aggression</a> even in the most <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429100045/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/02/video_irate_hipster_cop_hates_elect.php">benign contexts.</a> The surprising thing is when they actually get in trouble for it&#x2014;and that&apos;s what happened to former MTA cop Michael Matrisciano. Although in his case, his offense looked more like a sad vaudeville routine (see video below) than a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429100045/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/15/video_cops_beat_man_resisting_arres.php">nasty</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429100045/http://gothamist.com/2008/07/30/video_of_cop_beating_man_with_baton.php">beatdown.</a></p>

<p>Of course, Matrisciano, 33, wasn&apos;t fired for that offense alone&#x2014;he was slapped with a 42-day suspension due to that video plus another YouTube clip which he allegedly uploaded showing a different uniformed MTA cop &quot;rubbing his crotch area&quot; (that video has since been removed). <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429100045/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/mta-sues-fired-youtube-videos-article-1.1581377">The News says</a> Matrisciano struck a deal to remain employed, but was told that if there was one more &quot;serious violation&quot; he&apos;d be fired. </p>

<p>And after he was found guilty last year of committing auto insurance fraud by falsely claiming he had taken a defensive-driving class, he claims he was given the boot (though <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429100045/http://nypost.com/2014/01/16/mta-cop-caught-shoving-man-files-suit-to-get-job-back/">the MTA says</a> he is currently suspended without pay, Martrisciano&apos;s lawsuit alleges he&apos;s already been fired). For his part, Matrisciano says he wasn&apos;t given a chance to fight the allegations, and also, other cops are <em>sooooooo</em> much worse, it&apos;s so unfair you guys: &quot;[The MTA defendants] were eager to force the plaintiff&apos;s termination while ignoring far more egregious acts by other officers including arrests for insurance fraud [and] domestic violence,&quot; his suit contends.</p>

<p>Matrisciano could learn a lot about what it takes to be a cop from some of his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429100045/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/11/video_dancing_cop_tells_street_vend.php">more stoic fellow officers.</a></p>
