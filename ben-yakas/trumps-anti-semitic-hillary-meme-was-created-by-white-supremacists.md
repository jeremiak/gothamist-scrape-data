And then the Biased Liberal Media went and misconstrued one of his HILARIOUS anti-Hillary memes as anti-Semitic. Who could possibly think that the man who retweets <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016144428/http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/donald-trump-tweets-apparent-neo-nazi-supporter">neo-Nazis</a>, promotes debunked <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016144428/http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/donald-trump-racially-charged-fiction-challenges-gop">racist crime stats</a>, blames <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016144428/http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/06/28/did-a-trump-staffer-make-the-meme-that-nearly-broke-his-campaign.html">sexist Tweets</a> on interns, and gives a platform to users named <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016144428/http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/trump-retweets-apparent-neo-nazi-the-second-time-year">WhiteGenocideTM</a> would possibly be that insensitive?</p>

<p>Trump went so far as to change the Star Of David in the Tweet to a circle (see photos above), not because it was an anti-Semitic dogwhistle for his most bigoted followers, but just because...he didn&apos;t aesthetically like it? It&apos;s unclear <em>why</em> he altered it (WINK WINK), but one thing is for certain: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016144428/https://mic.com/articles/147711/donald-trump-s-star-of-david-hillary-clinton-meme-was-created-by-white-supremacists#.sbfXwuAE0">Mic reports that</a> the meme was created by and featured on a White Supremacist message board a few weeks ago.</p>

<p>There is a trope in superhero stories and daytime television in which the supervillain has a very public falling out with a very trusted former advisor or ally, all as part of a ruse so that follower can infiltrate the halls of power/the good guys and do the supervillains bidding from the inside. (This is also kind of the plot of <em>The Departed</em>.) To that end, former Trump spokesperson Corey Lewandowski, who was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016144428/https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/cnns-hiring-of-corey-lewandowski-insults-the-press--and-women/2016/06/28/0cb2211c-3d4d-11e6-84e8-1580c7db5275_story.html">controversially recently hired</a> by CNN, got to work defending Trump and the meme, and blaming the outrage on &quot;political correctness run amok.&quot; </p>
