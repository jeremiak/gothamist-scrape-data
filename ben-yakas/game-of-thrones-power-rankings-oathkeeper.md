<p>Last week <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504233443/http://gothamist.com/2014/04/20/game_of_thrones_power_rankings_brea.php">on <em>Game of Thrones</em></a>, Littlefinger was creepy, Margaery was confused, and Tywin got to multitasking. This week, the Queen of Thorns told a secret, Brienne got a new squire, and Bran got himself captured. GOT is all about how people jockey for power, so click through for our season 4 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504233443/http://gothamist.com/tags/gameofthronespowerrankings">Game of Thrones Power Rankings.</a></p>

<p><strong>Game Of Thrones Power Rankings, Week 4:</strong></p>

<p><strong>1. Ser Pounce:</strong> Was there ever any doubt? The furriest creature this side of Tormund Giantsbane clearly will be running King&apos;s Landing by season six.</p>

<p><strong>2. White Walkers:</strong> The stars of the final scene of the episode, probably the single creepiest scene on the show since the intro of the pilot. We&apos;ve learned more about them in one shot than we have in four seasons of <em>ominousity</em>. </p>

<p><strong>3. Daenerys Targaryen</strong>: &quot;I will answer injustice with justice.&quot; Dany flexes her royal muscles by exacting some rough revenge on the Masters of Mereen, but her triumphant moment is somewhat undercut by a dose of Very Noticeable CGI camera swooping.</p>

<p><strong>4. Queen of Thorns/Olenna Tyrell:</strong> One mystery down: we now know Olenna and Littlefinger conspired to kill Joffrey (on Olenna&apos;s prompting, and for the sake of her favorite granddaughter). This may be the last time we see the witty, wise Queen Of Thorns for a while, so let&apos;s cherish her (possible) last walk through that damned <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504233443/http://www.southparkstudios.com/clips/c618ok/the-betrayal-garden">garden of betrayal</a>.</p>

<p><strong>5. Littlefinger:</strong> The only thing more chilling than the final shot of White Walkers white walkering Craster&apos;s bastard was Littlefinger whispering about wanting &quot;everything&quot; while stroking Sansa&apos;s shoulder.</p>

<p><strong>6. Margaery Tyrell:</strong> She&apos;s much more ignorant of the machinations of King&apos;s Landing than we might have thought, but she&apos;s clearly a quick learner&#x2014;which came across with her subtle seduction of Tommen. There aren&apos;t many characters who could make such a scene seem sweet, but Margaery, as we know well, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504233443/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/28/game_of_thrones.php">is truly special.</a></p>

<p><strong>7. Jon Snow&apos;s Burgeoning Sense Of Leadership:</strong> Slowly but surely, this is emerging as one of the most compelling storylines of season four. </p>

<p><strong>8. Cersei Lannister:</strong> Is Cersei&apos;s extra cold edge toward Jaime because of what happened last week? Or has he just been a means to an end for her ever since he returned from captivity? </p>

<p><strong>9. Tommen Baratheon:</strong> Sweet, innocent Tommen starts to get some personality this week with his beloved cat and his wide-eyed wonder at the magical creature that is Margaery. If she can keep Cersei&apos;s influence at bay, dare we say, he could make a pretty decent king.</p>

<p><strong>10. Brienne + Pod:</strong> The greatest odd couple teamup in Westeros history since...well, since Arya and The Hound, but this is still a really great, really noble pairing. This can only lead to good things.</p>

<p><strong>11. Jaime Lannister:</strong> Last week, the internet had to grapple with Scumbag Jaime, the guy who pushes little kids out of towers and rapes his sister at the casket of their dead son (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504233443/http://www.avclub.com/article/rape-thrones-203499">give or take some controversial authorial intent</a>). This week we had Noble Jaime, exchanging meaningful looks (and gifts) with Brienne, verbally jousting with Bronn, and reconciling with his brother. It&apos;s hard not to sympathize with that Jaime&#x2014;it&apos;s also hard to forget everything that happened last week.</p>

<p><strong>12. Ser Bronn: </strong> Any episode which gives us this much time with a chatty Bronn is a <em>damn</em> good episode.</p>

<p><strong>13. Podrick Payne&apos;s Smile As The Camera Reveals Jaime&apos;s Final Gift To Brienne:</strong> Also special.</p>

<p><strong>14. Bran Stark:</strong> On the one hand, his story just got quite a bit more interesting, having run into the motley crew at Craster&apos;s Keep at a crucial moment. On the other hand, he really put himself in a bad position by revealing who he was. And Hodor ended up in chains because of him! All we can hope now is that the show isn&apos;t teasing us (again) with a Bran/Jon Snow reunion.</p>

<p><strong>15. Tyrion Lannister:</strong> The saddest man in Westeros spent some quality time with his big brother, and at least re-established their connection. He also confirmed that which everyone in King&apos;s Landing, besides Cersei, already knows: he didn&apos;t kill his shit of a nephew.</p>

<p><strong>The Viserys Targaryen Memorial Least Powerful Person Of The Week Award:</strong> There were a lot of good contenders this week&#x2014;including poor Hodor, sick Jojen Reed, the remaining daughters at Craster&apos;s Keep, and the guy who Locke beat up at Castle Black&#x2014;but we have to give this one to the <strong>Masters in Mereen</strong>, with a special shout-out to the one guy who is cornered in three directions by liberated slaves. And a hearty congratulations to Samwell Tarly for being in this episode and not winning this award.</p>

<p><strong>The Joffrey Baratheon Good Riddance Award:</strong> Even in death, Joffrey is still a dick to his friends...according to TMZ.</p>

<p><strong>The Hodoriffic Honorary Minor Character Of The Week Award:</strong> Lots of minor characters got standout moments this episode (Ser Bronn, Pod, Locke), but we&apos;ll give it to <strong>Grey Worm</strong>. Who would have thought that one of the sweetest scenes in a season four episode would involve two deep members of the show&apos;s bench, a eunuch and a translator.</p>

<p><strong>Rickon Watch 2014: Is Rickon Still On This Show?</strong> Did you know that Rickon named his direwolf after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504233443/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0393735/">a Tim Allen passion project</a>? That&apos;s just a fun fact to know. </p>

<p><strong>The Remember Roz Sexposition Quotient:</strong> After last week&apos;s cornucopia of flesh, things were as chaste as noble Ned Stark this week&#x2014;or at least it would have been were it not for that unfortunate visit with the creeps at Craster&apos;s Keep. Otherwise, the most erotic moment in this episode was Margaery leaving sweet Tommen with a kiss on the forehead.</p>

<p><strong>The Bad Ass Absence Of The Week:</strong> We were really jonesin&apos; for Arya this week, which is why we were glad we came upon this classy, classic clip:</p>

<p><iframe width="640" height="480" src="//web.archive.org/web/20150504233443if_/http://www.youtube.com/embed/OdqLY9357DQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p><strong>Way Beyond The Wall:</strong> Although a lot of ground was covered, there was much less rushing around the seven kingdoms than last week&#x2014;the direction by Michelle MacLaren was stupendous as always, with transitions that made even the most disparate storyline seem connected to others. We didn&apos;t see some major players this week, including Tywin Lannister, Red Viper/Prince Oberyn Martell, Arya and The Hound, Stannis Baratheon and the Dragonstone crew, and the Thenns and the Wildings (Ygritte). Daario Naharis sat it out, no sign of the Boltons/Freys/Reek (except for Locke at Castle Black, of course), and The Brotherhood Without Banners remains MIA. Mance Rayder&apos;s name was mentioned, so good for him.</p>

<p>Until next time, may the sweet sounds of goats bleating send you into the week with your head held high:</p>
