<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161126154259/http://gothamist.com/tags/stephencolbert">Stephen Colbert</a> took a break from the ongoing waking nightmare that is our newly-elected president to try to get back in touch with the spirit of Thanksgiving. And we&apos;re certainly grateful for it, as Colbert took his comedic gifts to the Butterball Turkey headquarters and took over their turkey help hotline for a series of segments. Watch below as Colbert gets into the stuffing/dressing debate, and threatens to call the Army on one very confused woman.</p>

<p>In part two, Colbert handles more adorable questions about stuffing and impersonates Jimmy Fallon. &quot;You know how they say, &apos;Dance like nobody&apos;s watching?&apos; I want to you to cook like nobody is going to eat it.&quot;</p>

<p>And in the spirit of giving, <em>Late Show</em> also put up THREE videos of outtakes from the bit you can enjoy below. </p>
