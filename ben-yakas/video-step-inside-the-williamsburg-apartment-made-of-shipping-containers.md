<p>You may recall pioneering couple <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507073723/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/01/finally_someone_in_williamsburg_is.php">David Boyle and Michele Bertomen</a>, who popped up on our radar after they converted a small plot of land at 351 Keap Street in Williamsburg into a house...made of five shipping containers. Their adventures building a 1,600-square-foot architectural anomaly has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507073723/http://gothamist.com/2013/12/03/family_builds_home_out_of_shipping.php#photo-1">inspired others to embrace the boxed life</a>. The cute couple has opened up about the difficulties of building their home (banks wouldn&apos;t give them a loan). Take a look inside their house in the video below&#x2014;and lest you think living in shipping containers is weird, they&apos;ll get the last laugh next time <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507073723/http://gothamist.com/2012/08/23/how_will_you_celebrate_2011_east_co.php#photo-1">there is an earthquake.</a></p>
