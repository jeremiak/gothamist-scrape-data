<p>A Florida businesswoman claims she was drugged and raped by a stranger at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130802023619/http://gothamist.com/tags/dreamhotel">Dream Hotel</a> in Chelsea this week. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130802023619/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/hotel_rape_shock_hDI544I40K2UkjjGHPjgnO">According to the Post</a>, the unidentified 36-year-old mother of two was having drinks at the hotel&apos;s bar on Thursday evening as she was waiting to meet with a former NFL player when the incident occurred. She believes the suspect drugged her drink: &#x201C;It wasn&#x2019;t like being drunk. I don&#x2019;t have blurred memory. I blacked out,&#x201D; she said. </p>

<p>The suspect, said to be in his 30s, started flirting with her at the bar, but the woman says she rebuffed him. &#x201C;I had plugged my phone in across the room. So I kept walking back and forth to it. He never bought me a drink, but he had to have put something in my drink at that time,&#x201D; the woman told the Post. When she woke up in her room, the top of her dress was pulled down and her cellphone was missing.</p>

<p>The woman, who didn&apos;t realize she had been raped until she got to Roosevelt Hospital, later watched surveillance footage showing her attacker leaving her room with her cellphone and one of her business cards. Police believe they have &quot;good&quot; enough video of the suspect to identify him. &#x201C;I just want them to catch him. I don&#x2019;t want this to happen to anyone else,&#x201D; the woman said. &#x201C;He knew what he was doing.&#x201D;</p>
