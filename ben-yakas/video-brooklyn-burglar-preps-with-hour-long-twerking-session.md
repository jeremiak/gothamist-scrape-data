</div></div>					<p>Even the greatest of burglars need some pumping up to get the job done&#x2014;you don&apos;t just wake up one morning and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150416214548/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK33zPnftWI">steal Whistler&apos;s Mother on a whim</a>. One thief in Clinton Hill decided to get loose before doing a job by twerking for an obscenely long amount of time outside of her target&apos;s apartment building. &quot;Her endurance was rather impressive,&quot; said victim Lindsey Riddle. &quot;I&apos;m not exaggerating when I say she did this for an hour. A couple of my neighbors walked into the building and she&apos;d stop momentarily and then start up hardcore as soon as their backs were to her.&quot; Check out a sped-up snippet of the surveillance video, which shows the suspect putting her thang down, flipping it, and reversing it.</p>

<p>Riddle, a 27-year-old Graphics Coordinator with VH1, says she returned home last Wednesday to find that two packages belonging to her and her boyfriend had been ripped open, with the contents taken out and boxes left behind. They looked through her building&apos;s surveillance footage to find the suspects&#x2014;the twerker kept watch and held the elevator while a man did the actual stealing (you can see screen shots of the suspects above).</p>

<p>But she was much more amazed by what transpired prior to the theft: &quot;The interesting part was what happened before the break-in, in which the woman proceeded to straight up twerk outside of our building. For an entire hour. Rest breaks were had, but she got right back up and dropped it like it was hot, often times on the lap of the man.&quot; Aww, a regular &apos;ol Bonnie and Clyde for the daggering generation. </p>

<p>Riddle has filed a police report with the 88th precinct. At least we can say that no <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150416214548/http://blog.storyful.com/2013/09/10/how-storyful-called-out-the-viral-twerking-video-as-a-fake-on-301-views/#.UqjIemRDvWp">candles</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150416214548/http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/2013/12/10/can-you-fact-check-a-twerking-video/">egos</a>, or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150416214548/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/08/28/miley-cyrus-twerking_n_3830560.html">young lives</a> were destroyed because of this twerking video. </p>
