<p>It&apos;s understandable that you&apos;d be nervous if you decided to publicly propose to your special someone on the Jumbotron at Yankees Stadium. It happens all the time, and usually there is a lot of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110105531/https://twitter.com/zack_hample/status/729836065452924928">booing involved</a>, because life is not like the now-classic Sandra Bullock/Ryan Reynolds vehicle <em>The Proposal</em> (oh, how we wish it were more like that, how we wish). But there&apos;s nervous, and then there&apos;s deer-in-headlights, life-flashing-before-your-eyes public misery. </p>

<p>And that&apos;s what one man experienced for a few minutes last night when he dropped the ring <em>right</em> as he was seconds from proposing and his face was plastered on the big screen.</p>

<p>Thankfully, this story had a happy ending: &quot;It only took about five minutes to find the ring, but it felt like it took like an hour,&quot; the man <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110105531/http://deadspin.com/yankees-fan-proposes-live-on-camera-loses-ring-1787163638">told reporters afterwards</a>, noting the ring turned up in the cuff of his now-fiancee&apos;s pants. Maybe real life is a little more like <em>The Proposal</em> than we ever realized.</p>
