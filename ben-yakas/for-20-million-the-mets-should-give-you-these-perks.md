<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120109105134/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/21/sports/baseball/to-attract-potential-investors-mets-add-perks-to-the-deal.html?_r=1&amp;ref=sports">NYTimes has a feature today</a> on some of the incentives being offered to investors willing to give $20 million to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120109105134/http://gothamist.com/mt/mt-search.cgi?search=mets&amp;__mode=tag&amp;IncludeBlogs=1&amp;limit=30&amp;page=1">financially struggling Mets</a>. The club is looking for approximately 10 <strike>suckers</strike> minority share owners&#x2014;their investments would give them four percent stakes in the team each, while leaving Fred Wilpon and Saul Katz as majority owners. And seeing as how they&apos;re not going to attract any <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120109105134/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/15/of_course_donald_trump_wants_to_buy.php">Donald Trumps</a>, the organization is sweetening the pot with some added perks, such as access to Mr. Met, an exclusive fantasy camp, and business cards reading &quot;owner.&quot; But if someone&apos;s gonna help bail out the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120109105134/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/06/mets_officials_reportedly_expect_te.php">perpetually-disappointing</a> Mets, we think some better incentives might be in order:</p>

<ul>
	<li>A pass to skip the line at the CitiField Shake Shack.</li>
	<li>Jerry Seinfeld will name <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120109105134/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/17/jerry_seinfeld_preps_for_post-reyes.php">a pet after you</a>.</li>
	<li>You <strike>can</strike> must try out at spring training. This team isn&apos;t going to pitch itself.</li>
	<li>You get to choose the intro songs for players&#x2014;hope Mike Pelfrey likes the soothing sounds of Christopher Cross! </li>
	<li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120109105134/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/30/red_sox_hire_charismatic_former_met.php">A Bobby Valentine Memorial Moustache</a>, for those times when you really want to watch the game from the dugout...in style.</li>
	<li>David Wright will show up at your child&apos;s Super Sweet 16. No promises whether he knows how to Dougie.</li>
	<li>Keith Hernandez will <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120109105134/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boyfriend_(Seinfeld)">help you move</a>. And will help you <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120109105134/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fucxG-he2qU">keep the gray away.</a></li>
	<li>Permanent exemption from participating in things like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120109105134/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/19/mariah_careys_husband_wants_to_brea.php">&#x201C;Nick Cannon Hug Night.&#x201D;</a></li>
	<li>Ron Darling and the SNY team will drive you to games...and narrate that drive.</li>
	<li>Oh, and this isn&apos;t much of an incentive, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120109105134/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/15/mets_3.php">you&apos;ll owe Bobby Bonilla</a> approximately $120K a year until 2035. Thanks! </li>
</ul>
