According to police, 28-year-old Ronis Garcia was found fatally stabbed inside an apartment building in Hunts Point just before 7:30 a.m. Saturday. Both women were arrested, and accused each other of the stabbing: &quot;One woman said she was [Garcia&#x2019;s] ex-wife. She said the other girl stabbed him and the other girl turns around and goes, &apos;No, b****, you stabbed him.&apos; They were going back and forth at each other,&quot; a witness <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130927200519/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/bronx/man-killed-break-fight-women-article-1.1423658">told the News</a>.</p>
