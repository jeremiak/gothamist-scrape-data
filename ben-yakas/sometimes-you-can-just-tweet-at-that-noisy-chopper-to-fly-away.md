<p>If you&apos;ve ever been woken up at 6 a.m. by the sounds of a low-hovering helicopter, then you know how <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151207093807/https://twitter.com/JohnBr0">John Brophy</a> felt yesterday. He woke up to the frustrating sound of a chopper hovering about 100 feet from his apartment on Friday morning&#x2014;but instead of curling up in a ball under a pile of pillows, he did some detective work on Twitter, found that ABC reporter <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151207093807/https://twitter.com/ChopperDanRice">Dan Rice</a> was the one in the chopper, and asked him nicely if he could fly a bit higher. And he did!</p>

Any chance you could fly about 100ft higher? Right below you.. Your chopper is rather noisy :)</p>&#x2014; John Brophy (@JohnBr0) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151207093807/https://twitter.com/JohnBr0/statuses/368324418339995648">August 16, 2013</a></blockquote>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151207093807/https://twitter.com/ChopperDanRice">@ChopperDanRice</a> much better! Thanks :)</p>&#x2014; John Brophy (@JohnBr0) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151207093807/https://twitter.com/JohnBr0/statuses/368326027111837696">August 16, 2013</a></blockquote>

<p>&quot;I went up to my roof and I could see some fire engines on the local &apos;BQE&apos; freeway - that was what they were filming,&quot; Brophy explained <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151207093807/http://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1khzgo/6am_this_morning_i_was_awoken_by_a_man_hovering/">on Reddit</a>. &quot;I Twitter searched BQE and he had just tweeted a message about it before he posted that photo.&quot; And in case you were concerned that Rice was tweeting-and-choppering, worry not:</p>

As the reporter and cameraman, I am free to tweet away!!</p>&#x2014; Dan Rice (@ChopperDanRice) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151207093807/https://twitter.com/ChopperDanRice/statuses/368390495229460480">August 16, 2013</a></blockquote>
