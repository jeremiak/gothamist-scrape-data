<p>Yesterday <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504141208/http://project.wnyc.org/dogs-of-nyc/">WNYC presented a cool map</a> that broke down neighborhoods by most popular dog names and breeds&#x2014;who knew there were so many dogs named Pepsi (26), but none named Coke?&#x2014;but in their dogged attempts to catalog the names of their canine overlords, they ignored the most important statistics on dogs available: where they&apos;re pooping. Or more specifically, where their owners aren&apos;t cleaning up their poop and infuriating their neighbors. But we didn&apos;t stop at dog doo; this interactive map shows where New Yorkers are reporting a variety of dog complaints to 311&#x2014;you can see all the barking, poop, and unleashed dog complaints in the interactive map below:</p>

<p>Some interesting tidbits from the map: Staten Island (and the more suburban parts of the city) love to complain about dogs. Bay Ridge has some serious problems with neighborhood dogs, while the Upper West Side has a lot of unleashed mutts. People in Chelsea and Williamsburg get more annoyed by the barking than any of their neighboring hoods&#x2014;same for Bushwick, Park Slope, Marine Park and Morris Park. Surprisingly, despite the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504141208/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/21/poop_alley.php">great Dog Poop War of 2012</a>, there were very few poop complaints in Gramercy Park. But who needs city agencies when you have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504141208/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/16/spotted_sign_calling_out_dog_owners.php">passive-aggressive notes</a>!</p>
