<p>Not to generalize, but most of the time when we come across <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429203915/http://gothamist.com/tags/sexualharassment">sexual harassment</a> in the workplace lawsuits, it involves gross older men talking about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429203915/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/12/ny_assemblyman_accused_of_sexually.php">boners</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429203915/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/30/manhattan_woman_allegedly_crotch-gr.php">crotch-groping.</a> But not so for Joseph Jackson, who has filed a lawsuit against tech public relations firm <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429203915/http://www.opencomms.com/">OpenCommunications</a> because two female coworkers allegedly wanted to have a &quot;bang sesh&quot; with him. Like, really really wanted to.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429203915/http://valleywag.gawker.com/private-relations-tech-pr-firm-sued-for-rampant-sexual-1531842512">Valleywag reports</a> that OpenCommunications is a small Manhattan firm that represents startups like Yext and Fiverr (yes, that is how both those words are spelled), along with the likes of AOL and Hearst. According to the suit, which you can read in its full multi-numbered form above, Jackson was routinely harassed by his coworkers, who groped his arms, &quot;sexually whispered&quot; things in his ear, and discussed his penis size. </p>

<p>Coworker Sally O&apos;Dowd allegedly compared him to her &quot;hot young Puerto Rican lover Apollo,&quot; while Katie Campisano allegedly texted him pointedly, &quot;When are we going to have our bang sesh?&quot; On top of all of this, Jackson claims that when he brought his complaints to CEO Andy Morris, he called him a &quot;hater&quot; and brushed him off, allegedly telling Jackson, &quot;I don&apos;t understand what the problem is. You&apos;re doing good here.&quot; Hell, had he played his cards right, Jackson probably could have spearheaded the Fivexterrr merger!</p>
