<p>A group of masked ATM burglars who are accused of perpetrating 62 thefts in Brooklyn and Queens over the last 14 months <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140603150655/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/NYC-Burglary-Crew-Bleach-DNA-Movie-The-Town-Ben-Affleck-132076738.html">have been caught</a>. Four suspects (a fifth one was already in custody) are accused of stealing over $200K; police say they used a signature &quot;splash and dash&quot; technique, splashing the crime scene with bleach, to destroy DNA evidence. And <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140603150655/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/11/clorox_crew_on_atm_robbing_rampage.php">just as we predicted</a>, the robbers admitted to cops that they were inspired in that respect by the 2010 Ben Affleck movie, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140603150655/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nt0CRt8335M&amp;feature=related"><em>The Town</em>.</a></p>

<p>The burglars, whose crime spree allegedly began in August 2010, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140603150655/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2011/10/19/2011-10-19_thieves_inspired_by_the_town_poured_bleach_on_atms_cash_registers_to_erase_dna_i.html">said that in addition to</a> the splash and dash, they also cut power to their target locations and used miners&apos; headlamps to see what they were doing in the dark. Except unlike the movie, in which Affleck and his Bah-ston cohorts hit big banks, the Clorox Crew mainly robbed small business owners, including delis, discount stores, candy shops, and pizzerias.</p>

<p>The four suspects have all already confessed to a certain amount of the burglaries: Amaurys Hernandez, 26, admitted he took part in 11 burglaries; Andy Lopez, 31, confessed to three; Roy Gonzalez, 24, said he was involved in 24 of the crimes; and Miguel Colon, 29, admitted to two. </p>
