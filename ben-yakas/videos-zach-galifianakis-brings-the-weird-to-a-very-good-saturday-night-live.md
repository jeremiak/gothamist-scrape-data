All during this incredibly up-and-down <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717092751/http://gothamist.com/tags/saturdaynightlive"><em>Saturday Night Live</em></a> season, we&apos;ve noted that even though good writing can elevate a mediocre host, nothing compares to an episode of SNL with a great host. Last night&apos;s episode was a testament to that: Zach Galifianakis brought all of his weird, barely-keeping-it-together, confrontational energy to the table dring a set of sketches that were thin on inspiration and big on perspiration. Not everything worked as well as we had hoped, but this was still one of the better episodes of the season.</p>

<p>Eschewing the usual dead-in the-water political cold open or a laughless press conference, things started off with a visit to &quot;Fox and Friends&quot;, which has slowly turned into one of the most dependable recurring sketches in the current cast&apos;s back pocket. The Jason Collins-inspired confessions and the visit from Mayor Bloomberg were both fun; but the best part, as ever, was the &quot;corrections&quot; list at the end.</p>

<p>Galifianakis killed it in his opening monologue, ratcheting up the surreal half-jokes and weird gestures (twirling around to see the band&apos;s reaction at times). They may have been typical Galifianakis bits, but he makes them work every time. He got to play a dragon costume-wearing <em>Game Of Thrones</em> fan on a GOT game show who wasn&apos;t asked any GOT-related questions; he was fantastic as a disgruntled Jennifer Anniston impersonator in a sketch with guest appearances by <em>Hangover</em> co-stars Bradley Cooper and Ed Helms; and in one of the best sketches of the night, he played &quot;Racist Jim&quot; apologizing to his coworkers at the M&amp;M; Store for...a lot of things.</p>

<p>The other standout sketch of the evening was a two-parter revolving around Galifianakis hosting a public access show. First we got to see the awkward, anger-prone host run through the show in real time; then the episode ended with the finished product, inserted Jon Hamm appearances and everything. Judging by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717092751/http://www.hitfix.com/monkeys-as-critics/recap-saturday-night-live-zach-galifianakis-and-of-monsters-and-men">reactions around the web</a>, it was a love it or hate it affair&#x2014;and we definitely loved it.</p>

<p>Click through for those highlights, plus Martha Stewart giving crazy eyes on Match.com, Michael Jordan&apos;s wedding performers, the return of James Carville on Weekend Update, Fred Armisen taking on Google Glass, and musical performances by Of Monsters Of Men.</p>
