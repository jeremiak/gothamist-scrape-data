Recurring <em>Law &amp; Order</em> actress Lenore Harris <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120124131424/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/yelp_has_arrived_cULfzEMMVXgYLPNGYzl5eJ?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">was reunited with her 17-year-old Pomeranian yesterday</a>, a few days after the dog was stolen from her in a CVS on the Upper West Side. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s a great holiday New York story,&#x201D; said Lenore&#x2019;s sister, Rosalind Harris, an actress who played Tzeitel in the movie <em>Fiddler on the Roof</em>.<p></p>

<p>Lenore, who played public defender Marya Levinson in several episodes of <em>Law &amp; Order</em>, took her dog Mottel to the CVS drugstore at 93rd Street and Broadway Tuesday night, putting his carrier in her shopping cart. She turned to speak to the pharmacist and &#x201C;it wasn&#x2019;t even a minute. I turned around and the dog was gone.&#x201D; Employees said they saw a man rush out the store with the bag. Lenore, who teaches speech at the HB Studio acting school, was distraught to say the least: &#x201C;I know this sounds dramatic, but you want to commit suicide. I wanted to kill myself.&#x201D;</p>

<p>She and her sister spent $1,500 giving out fliers, plastering posters around the neighborhood, and hiring drivers to help them search. Then on Wednesday night, Sonya Thorpe and her 9-year-old daughter Naomi saw the bag with Mottel at the bus stop at 96th Street and First Avenue: &#x201C;I opened the bag and said, &#x2018;Oh my God, he&#x2019;s so cute,&#x2019; &#x201D; said Thorpe. They identified the dog thanks to his microchip, and helped reunite owner and pet soon after. Today, Lenore said she&apos;d be taking Mottel for a special grooming and bath after his ordeal, &#x201C;so he enters the new year sparkling.&#x201D;</p>
