<p>The dad of the severely abused 4-year-old who died <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501171601/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/09/body_of_4-year-old_who_died_in_midt.php">after falling off a bathroom ledge in a Midtown apartment</a> this week says he was a &quot;loving father&quot; in a jailhouse interview. &quot;I was a loving father. That&apos;s all that matters,&quot; Okee Wade <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501171601/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/exclusive-myls-dobson-dad-loving-father-article-1.1576680">told the Daily News</a>. His son, Myls Dobson, died while in the care of Kryzie King, a transgender performer who had been identified by cops as Wade&apos;s girlfriend. But Wade claims he has never heard of that person, and seemed more interested in talking about his sexual preferences than his son: &quot;They put in the paper that I was dating a transsexual,&quot; he said. &quot;That&apos;s just wrong! I like women. I don&apos;t date men and I don&apos;t date transsexuals.&quot;</p>

<p>Doctors who examined the toddler&apos;s body <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501171601/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/10/myls_dobson_the_4-year-old_who.php">discovered lacerations, bruises and cigarette burns</a>; King allegedly admitted to abusing the young boy, &quot;giving him corporal punishment&quot; in order &quot;to control him.&quot; Wade had sole custody of the child since he was taken out of his mother Ashlee Dobson&apos;s custody in 2011; Administration for Children&#x2019;s Services (ACS) accused her of child neglect, something which the boy&apos;s grandmother confirmed: &quot;She would punch him and she would slap him. She&#x2019;s not a person to have children,&#x201D; Orquidia Wade said. </p>

<p>Wade reportedly left Myls with King on December 18th, before getting arrested in New Jersey on an outstanding warrant for bank fraud. And due to a loophole in the system, ACS was not informed that Wade had been arrested: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501171601/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20140111/midtown/loophole-child-safety-law-placed-4-year-old-hands-of-suspected-killer">DNAInfo reports</a> that &quot;there is nothing on the books that requires NYPD officers to notify child welfare workers when they arrest a suspect who is the primary caregiver of a kid.&quot;</p>

<p>When officers asked Wade if he had any children, he told them that a friend was caring for Myls. Since Wade had never been flagged for child abuse, officers weren&apos;t required to contact ACS. &quot;Unless we have a feeling that he&apos;s keeping something from us or we know something more about his background, there&apos;s nothing we have to do,&#x201D; a police source told them.</p>

<p>After Myls was removed from his mother&apos;s care, ACS monitored Wade and Myls for a year, but the supervision ended September 2012. &quot;Unfortunately, once ACS&apos; involvement with a family has concluded, the agency no longer has oversight authority,&quot; ACS spokesman Michael Fagan said. &quot;As instructed by the mayor, we are launching a thorough review of the case to learn what happened and might have been done differently to serve the child welfare needs of the little boy.&quot;</p>

<p>Another source told DNAInfo that no one from the family inquired with ACS about the whereabouts about Myls between Wade&apos;s arrest on December 18th and his death on January 8th.</p>
