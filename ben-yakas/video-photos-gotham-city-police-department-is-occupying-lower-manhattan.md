<p>As <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161407/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/05/this_weekends_dark_knight_rises_fil.php">we wrote about earlier today</a>, obscure indie film <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161407/http://gothamist.com/tags/thedarkknightrises"><em>The Dark Knight Rises</em></a> was shooting around Wall Street all day (as it will be doing tomorrow as well). Director Christopher Nolan watched as over a thousand extras filled up lower Manhattan, performing as Gotham City cops and a group of rebels clashing on the streets of Gotham, exchanging fake gunfire in the process. Check out some videos below.</p>

<p>Actor Matthew Modine, who is believed to play a cop, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161407/http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/movies/batman-occupies-wall-street-dark-knight-films-fight-scene-downtown-article-1.972691">was on set</a> leading the police, and Christian Bale&#x2014;Batman himself&#x2014;was due on set later in the day. Above, check out photos from today&apos;s shoot&#x2014;you can see more <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161407/http://www.comicbookmovie.com/fansites/debbiedowner/news/?a=49423">photos at Comicbookmovie.com</a>. </p>

<p>Below, check out a few videos from today&apos;s shoot of what will undoubtedly turn out to be an epic battle.</p>
