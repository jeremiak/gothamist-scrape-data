<p>Remember discmen? Remember Woodstock &apos;99? Remember pogs and floppy discs and Sugar Ray and Blockbuster and Bob Barker? All those things may be distant memories of decades past (as if!), but the dream of the &apos;90s will come back to life in 2017 at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161226053833/http://gothamist.com/tags/alamodrafthouse">Alamo Drafthouse</a> for a special January film series celebrating the &apos;90s classics with the best soundtracks.</p>

<p><em>The Alamo Drafthouse Brooklyn Presents Original Motion Picture Soundtracks: The 90s</em> kicks off on January 2nd with a movie party for <em>Wayne&apos;s World</em>, which we might add still holds up pretty schwing-ingly (this is a bad joke). That same week, you can see <em>Hackers</em> (The Prodigy are ripe for a comeback), <em>Velvet Goldmine</em> (especially nice because it&apos;s happening the same week of what would have been David Bowie&apos;s 70th birthday). Those films are followed by <em>Fear</em> (&quot;Wild Horses!&quot;) and <em>Clueless</em> (Luscious Jackson, The Muffs, Cracker). </p>

<p>Later in the month, you can revisit Oliver Stone&apos;s <em>Natural Born Killers</em> (Leonard Cohen, Nine Inch Nails, Cowboy Junkies, and a Bob Dylan rarity on that soundtrack); <em>Pump Up The Volume</em> (Pixies, a Concrete Blonde cover of Cohen, more Cowboy Junkies); then there&apos;s <em>The Bodyguard</em> (Whitney Houston), <em>Trainspotting</em> (Iggy Pop, Lou Reed, Blur), <em>Set It Off</em> (Queen Latifah, Busta Rhymes, Bone Thugs-N-Harmony), <em>Pulp Fiction</em> (Dick Dale, Urge Overkill); and the series finishes on January 30th with <em>New Jack City</em> (featuring Ice-T and music by Color Me Badd). <br>

You can get more information about the movies and  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161226053833/https://drafthouse.com/nyc/program/january">buy tickets here</a>. And if you&apos;re sitting their incredulously wondering, &quot;Where the fuck is <em>High Fidelity</em>?!? Where is &quot;Dry The Rain&quot;?!?! Everything is bullshit!&quot; then just calm down, it&apos;s okay&#x2014;HF might seem like a quintessential &apos;90s text, but it was actually released in 2000. </p>
