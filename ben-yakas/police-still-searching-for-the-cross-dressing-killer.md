<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:225px; "> <img alt="51911jones.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130703153524im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/51911jones.jpg" width="225" height="308"> <br> <i>Ronnell Jones</i></div> Yonkers police are getting mighty frustrated that they have yet to be able to capture <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130703153524/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/22/police_hunt_cross-dressing_alleged.php">Ronnell Jones</a>, aka the &quot;cross-dressing killer,&quot; who they believe has been hiding in not-quite-plain sight for months now. &quot;I would certainly classify him as a cold-blooded killer. <strong>And yes, in my 30-plus-year career in law enforcement I have not encountered somebody hiding from law enforcement for a vicious murder wearing women&apos;s clothing</strong>,&quot; Yonkers Police Commissioner Ed Hartnett <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130703153524/http://www.myfoxny.com/dpp/news/yonkers-police-male-suspect-now-disguised-a-woman-20110518">told Fox</a>. <p></p>

<p>During a botched burglary in summer 2010, Jones and two accomplices allegedly shot and killed two people: wheelchair-bound Kasheem Little, aka &apos;Killa Kash,&apos; and &quot;the leader of the Strip Boyz gang,&quot; and Carlton McLeod. They also injured four others, including a 5-year-old boy who was shot in the arm, and a 17-year-old girl shot in the chest while begging for her life. The two accomplices were both caught and charged with murder, attempted murder, robbery, burglary and weapon possession, but Jones was able to slip away, thanks to his predilection for cross-dressing. </p>

<p>But Hartnett doesn&apos;t want people losing sight of the severity of his alleged crimes just because he dresses in wigs and women&apos;s clothing: &quot;We believe he is a vicious criminal. And we are asking the public to help us capture him.&quot; Police believe he may be back in Yonkers hiding out amongst friends or girlfriends, but have yet to locate him. But Hartnett vows to apprehend him eventually: <strong>&quot;We don&apos;t care if he&apos;s wearing high heels and skirt, we&apos;re going to get him.&quot;</strong></p>
