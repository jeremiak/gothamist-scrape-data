<p>A Queens car thief has been arrested for allegedly stealing an SUV, and then attempting to sexually assault the 13-year-old girl who was sleeping in it. According to police, Kapri Dickson, 23, stole the Ford Explorer just before 6 p.m. Thursday on Sutphin Boulevard and 109th Avenue. The 28-year-old owner of the car told police that his 13-year-old niece had been sleeping in the backseat of the unlocked car; the uncle and a family friend had run into a bodega and left the keys in the ignition when the theft occurred. </p>

<p>The teen woke up during the drive, screamed, and started kicking the driver&apos;s seat; Dickson then allegedly pulled the car over, pulled down his pants, and attempted to sexually assault her. The teen resisted and attempted to push him off her, and Dickson allegedly struck the teen in the face, breaking her nose, and threw her out of the car. </p>

<p>Dickson, who has one prior arrest for selling drugs, was arrested soon after, and has been charged with sex abuse, kidnapping, attempted sexual assault, grand larceny auto and possession of stolen property.</p>
