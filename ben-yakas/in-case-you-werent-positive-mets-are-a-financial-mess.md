(via Daily Show)</i></div> A lot has changed in a few years for the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110325125717/http://gothamist.com/tags/mets">Mets</a>: in 2009, they were the second most valuable team in the MLB, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110325125717/http://www.forbes.com/2009/04/22/yankees-mets-baseball-values-09-business-sports-intro.html">worth</a> $912 million, and averaged over 3 million fans a year. But according <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110325125717/http://blogs.forbes.com/monteburke/2011/03/23/special-report-inside-baseballs-debt-disaster/">to Forbes</a>, their value has dropped 13 percent from last year. The Mets are now worth $747 million, attendance at Citifield fell by 600,000 last year, and they are approximately $450 million in debt. The Post has even taken to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110325125717/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/amazin_lide_kMmvx8bLEWT1FQk94K1LQP?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">calling them</a> the &quot;New York Debts.&quot; Guess this proves once and for all that a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110325125717/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/19/mets_1.php">$1 billion lawsuit</a> really isn&apos;t a good thing.<p></p>

<p>Forbes <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110325125717/http://blogs.forbes.com/nathanvardi/2011/03/23/the-new-york-mets-need-a-financial-miracle/?utm_source=allactivity&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=20110323">thinks</a> it&apos;ll take a (financial) miracle for Fred Wilpon and Saul Katz to retain majority ownership of the team at this point, something the two have sworn <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110325125717/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/16/wilpons_vow_not_to_give_up_controll.php">to do</a> time and again as they&apos;ve begun the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110325125717/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/18/mlb_approves_three_bidders_for_mets.php">process</a> of selling a minority share of the team. </p>

<p>On the plus side, the team has been trimming the fat for the past few weeks, getting rid of some deadweight, including overpaid albatrosses Oliver Perez and Luis Castillo. And wouldn&apos;t you know, both players have signed with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110325125717/http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-03-24/nationals-sign-ex-mets-pitcher-perez-to-minor-league-deal-mlb-com-says.html">division rivals</a>! Castillo even signed with the dread Frillies, but the joke was on them: Castillo didn&apos;t bother to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110325125717/http://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/news?slug=ycn-8127242">turn up</a> for his first game with the team, skipping the first two days of camp.
