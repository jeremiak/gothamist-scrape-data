<p>It wouldn&apos;t be hyperbolic to say that all the grifters we&apos;ve come across have been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150710001201/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/13/nobody_can_resist_the_romeo_grifter.php">pretty</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150710001201/http://gothamist.com/2010/01/29/dating_site_grifter_convinced_women.php">pretty</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150710001201/http://gothamist.com/tags/hipstergrifter">pretty</a> shady characters. One such gold-digging, elderly-pillaging con woman, Cher Thompson, was sentenced to a seven-year prison term this week, after she <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150710001201/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2010/12/22/2010-12-22_golddigger_gets_maximum_sentence_for_scamming_dementia_patient_braindamaged_husb.html">pleaded guilty</a> to fleecing more than $100,000 from two disabled, lonely old men, including one who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150710001201/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/old_digging_gal_KQJYG6IH2Um446sNDM1BZM">suffered</a> from a traumatic brain injury. She apologized for being &quot;such an inconvenience to them,&quot; but if she could turn back time, would she? And what screams apologetic like wearing a skin tight purple, off-the-shoulder top to your court hearing (as she does in the pic of the News site)? </p>
