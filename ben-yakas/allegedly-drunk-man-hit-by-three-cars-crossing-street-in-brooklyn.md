<p>An allegedly drunk man was hit by three cars while crossing the street in Brooklyn on Saturday. According to police, the incident happened around 12:55 a.m. when the unidentified 30-year-old man was attempting to cross Nostrand Avenue and Beverley Road in East Flatbush. Witness Ravi Hunter <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427145453/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/klyn_triple_hit_run_TKs30Frynl1UmvZeYVyXNJ">told the Post he saw</a> the man get hit by three cars in a row, with all the drivers leaving the scene: &#x201C;His bone was showing, and his flesh was showing,&#x201D; he said, noting skin on the victim&apos;s leg and buttocks was hanging off. &#x201C;It was just like the meat was ripped from his body.&#x201D;</p>

<p>The man was first clipped in the face by the mirror of a Ford SUV; then a black car ran him over; then a white van hit him. The driver of that van got out for a moment according to Hunter: &#x201C;Everyone was telling [the driver] to stay and wait for the police, but he just left,&#x201D; said Hunter. &#x201C;That could be me. They left him like trash in the street &#x2014; like he was garbage. Whether he was drinking or not, he shouldn&#x2019;t be run over like an animal.&#x201D; Hunter noted that the other drivers may not have realized they hit a person. &#x201C;Maybe they thought it was a bag,&#x201D; Hunter said. &#x201C;It was just devastating to see that.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Hunter also said that he didn&apos;t think the man had the right of way to cross the street at the time of the incident. &#x201C;He was groaning and doing a little talking,&#x201D; Hunter said. &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t know what he was saying, but I could smell the alcohol on his breath.&#x201D; Cops said he was taken to Kings County Hospital in stable condition, and is expected to survive. </p>
