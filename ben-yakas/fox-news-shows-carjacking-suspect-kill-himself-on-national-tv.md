<p>Fox News <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170310060928/http://www.foxnews.com/us/2012/09/28/suspected-carjacker-leads-arizona-police-on-high-speed-chase/?test=latestnews">was airing a dramatic car chase</a> in Arizona around 3:30 p.m. this afternoon when they inadvertently showed live footage of the suspect fatally shooting himself in the head. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170310060928/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZttwwbM-AU&amp;feature=youtu.be">You can see the video here</a>&#x2014;but be warned that it is very graphic. Immediately after it aired, host Shepard Smith <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170310060928/https://twitter.com/StephLauren/status/251767316726026240">apologized</a>: &quot;We&apos;re all very sorry. That didn&apos;t belong on TV. I personally apologize that that happened.&quot;</p>

<p>According to MyFoxPhoenix, police said the suspect carjacked a red Dodge Caliber, and had been driving up to 110 MPH. Here&apos;s a transcript of what Smith says during the video as he narrates the chase:</p>

<blockquote>He&apos;s looking kind of erratic, isn&apos;t he? Um, I don&apos;t know, no, look at this, he&apos;s just running, oh my, well, it looks like he&apos;s a little disoriented or something, it&apos;s always possible the guy could be on something...oh, [off screen: woah, oh my god] get off, get off, get off, get off, get off, get off&#x2014; get off it, GET OFF IT&#x2014;GET OFF IT</blockquote>

<p>Below, you can see video of Smith apologizing. Here&apos;s what he said exactly:</p>

<blockquote>Well, some explaining to do. While we were taking that car chase and showing you, when the guy pulled over and got out of the video we went on delay. That is why I didn&#x2019;t talk for about ten seconds. We created a five-second delay. If you bleep back the DVR five seconds, like that. We wanted to see in the studio what was happening five seconds before you did so if anything went horribly wrong, we would be able to cut away from it without subjecting you to it.

<p>And we really messed up. We&#x2019;re all very sorry. That didn&#x2019;t belong on TV. We took every precaution we knew how to take to keep that from being on TV. I personally apologize to you that happened. Sometimes we see a lot things we don&#x2019;t let get to you because it is not time appropriate, it is insensitive, it is just wrong. And that was wrong. And that won&apos;t happen again on my watch. And I&apos;m sorry</p>

<p>We&apos;ll update you on what happened with that guy and how that went down tonight on &quot;The Fox Report.&quot;</p>

<p>I&apos;m sorry.</p></blockquote><p></p>
