<p>Between relentless <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160221203951/http://gothamist.com/2014/03/04/union_square_starbucks_employee_cla.php">sexual harassment</a>, having to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160221203951/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/22/starbucks_baristas_must_share_tips.php">share tips with supervisors</a>, and dealing with crotchety New Yorkers, baristas have it hard enough as it is. The city won&apos;t even legally allow them <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160221203951/http://gothamist.com/tags/catcafe">to have a kitten around</a> their stores! But there&apos;s yet another hardship baristas have been enduring: repetitive stress injuries from slinging coffee.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160221203951/http://nypost.com/2014/05/04/baristas-feeling-the-grind-with-repetitive-stress-injuries/">The Post brings us</a> the story of Samantha Lino, a 23-year-old former Starbucks barista who quit after her stress injury got bad enough that she was forced to start wearing an arm brace. Lino first felt a pain in her elbow last June, and soon learned from her doctor that she had &quot;medical epicondylitis,&quot; a.k.a. golfer&apos;s elbow. Lino ultimately quit her job when the pain wouldn&apos;t go away.</p>

<p>&quot;I&#x2019;ve seen all kinds of barista injuries,&quot; Phaeleau Cunneen, a certified hand specialist at SPEAR Physical Therapy in Manhattan, told the Post. &quot;It&#x2019;s very common, and usually chronic.&quot; Barista wrist, as it&apos;s called, has led some owners to re-design their stores to be ergonomically safe or retrain their workers to take the physical pressure off their vulnerable joints, according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160221203951/http://www.foodrepublic.com/2011/07/29/barista-wrist-its-real">a report from Food Republic</a>.</p>

<p>Alex Bernson, a barista advocate who writes for the site Sprudge, did a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160221203951/http://sprudge.com/real-talk-barista-health-in-the-workplace-part-one.html">survey of 475 city baristas last year</a>, and found that 47% of them suffered repetitive stress injuries they attributed to their jobs; 20% had heart palpitations or chest pains; and 62% thought their job/intake of coffee had caused emotional problems and depression.</p>

<p>While physical therapy, meds, and surgery might be the only options to help with stress injuries, we think more cats would probably help with the depression.<br>
