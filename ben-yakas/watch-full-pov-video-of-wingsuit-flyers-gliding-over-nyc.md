<p>Last week, five skydivers wearing wingsuits <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150420192012/http://gothamist.com/2014/05/19/wingsuit_manhattan_skydive.php#photo-2">jumped from a plane flying over Lower Manhattan</a> as part of a carefully choreographed stunt organized by Red Bull. These Red Bull Air Force members jumped from an altitude of 7,500 feet, reached speeds exceeding 120 mph, and were on a barge in the Hudson River in about two minutes. We previously got a tease of the jump, but below you can watch it in full from the skydivers&apos; perspective.</p>

<p>As you can see in the video below, the jump almost never happened&#x2014;and considering all the red tape Red Bull had to go through to make it happen, isn&apos;t likely to happen again anytime soon.</p>
