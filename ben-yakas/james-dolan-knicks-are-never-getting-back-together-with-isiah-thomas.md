<p>Local amateur musician <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509223026/http://gothamist.com/tags/jamesdolan">James Dolan</a> is not known for his warm and fuzzy relationship with the press&#x2014;reporters are more likely than not to say <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509223026/http://observer.com/2007/11/life-in-knicks-hell/">it&apos;s miserable trying to report on the Knicks</a> under Dolan&apos;s iron fist. But Dolan sat down for a rare <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509223026/http://nypost.com/2013/11/22/james-dolan-dishes-on-isiah-his-garden-teams/">one-on-one interview with the Post</a> today to talk about The Eagles. Oh, and he also talked a little about sports, including the current state of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509223026/http://gothamist.com/tags/knicks">Knicks</a> and Isiah Thomas.</p>

<p>Here&apos;s the good news: Isiah&apos;s never, ever coming back! Of course, Dolan would love to have him back, but he&apos;s afraid Thomas might kill himself or something if he did come back.</p>

<blockquote>Do I think he deserves another shot? Yeah. It just can&#x2019;t be here. And I think he&#x2019;s talented. I think he&#x2019;s particularly talented at finding basketball talent. But I think he&#x2019;s probably dismayed at this point. But I don&#x2019;t see him coming back to New York. I couldn&#x2019;t do that to him, and I couldn&#x2019;t do that to the organization. He would probably do it as my friend but I couldn&#x2019;t do it to him or his family. And you know what the press would do here. We&#x2019;re interested in getting better and that situation would be such a distraction that it would actually hinder our ability to get better.</blockquote>

<p>Considering the fact that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509223026/http://gothamist.com/tags/isiahthomas">Knicks fans and reporters shudder</a> any time there&apos;s a managerial change because of the looming specter of the return of Isiah Thomas, which has seemed a foregone conclusion at different points over the past several years, this is progress! Dolan may not want to throw his good friend under the bus, but he is <em>finally</em> acknowledging that there is no way in hell Thomas could ever be an effective manager of the Knicks in this lifetime.</p>

<p>Other tidbits from the interview: Dolan doesn&apos;t regret Amare Stoudemire&apos;s $100 million deal even though they&apos;ll likely only get one productive year out of it. Dolan supports coach Mike Woodson, and still stubbornly believes this current Knicks team can win a championship. He&apos;s quietly hired McKinsey &amp; Company, a Manhattan-based global management consulting firm, to &quot;reprocess&quot; both the Knicks and Rangers. </p>

<p>Dolan also thinks he&apos;s a better team owner than &quot;nobody&quot; (I shit you not): &quot;They may not like what I&#x2019;m doing but it&#x2019;s much better than having nobody there. Nobody there just leaves you in despair.&quot; Considering the Thomas years and subsequently disappointing &quot;revival&quot; years, this is highly debatable. </p>

<p>But most importantly, Dolan wants to talk about The Eagles.</p>

<blockquote>MV: How important is music to you? Obviously you have the band [J.D. and the Straight Shot], you&#x2019;ve been trailing the Eagles, you&#x2019;ve opened for them. How much of that defines you?
JD: You are not what you own. Music is a big piece of who I am. I don&#x2019;t own music. I create music, and I play it, but I do not own it. So if you want to get to know me, you&#x2019;ll see music as a big piece of who I am.
MV: The Eagles come to you and say, &#x201C;Come on up and play one song with us.&#x201D; Which song do you pick?
JD: Whoa &#x2026; I love so many Eagles songs &#x2026;
MV: That&#x2019;s the curveball question.
JD: They start off their show with a song called &#x201C;Whatever Happened to Saturday Night&#x201D; &#x2026; maybe because I haven&#x2019;t heard it as much as others but I love that song. And it&#x2019;s just Glenn [Frey] and Don [Henley] sitting on amplifiers, playing guitars and to me that&#x2019;s how I grew up playing music.</blockquote>

<p>Of course he loves the fuckin&apos; Eagles.</p>
