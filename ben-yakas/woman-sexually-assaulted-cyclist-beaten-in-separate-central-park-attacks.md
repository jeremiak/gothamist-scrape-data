<p>A woman was sexually assaulted and robbed, and a male cyclist was beaten and robbed in separate incidents in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161014183050/http://gothamist.com/tags/centralpark">Central Park</a> on Monday.</p>

<p>Police say the 27-year-old woman was walking along a path at East Drive near East 104th Street around 9:30 p.m. Monday when the incident happened. She was attacked from behind by a man who dragged her into a wooded area. He pulled her T-shirt over her head, blocking her vision, and sexually assaulted her, attempting to rip off her pants. </p>

<p>Police say the man grabbed her iPhone and walked away from the victim, but then came back and kicked her in the head before fleeing the scene. The woman was taken to St. Luke&apos;s Hospital for treatment. The suspect is described as being in his mid-30s, with a &quot;scruffy&quot; beard, wearing a dark jacket and orange t-shirt.</p>

<p>In a separate incident, a 47-year-old man riding a Citi Bike was beaten and robbed by a group of teens near 95th Street and East Drive around midnight Monday. Victim Jacob Angstreich <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161014183050/http://nypost.com/2016/10/11/jogger-sexually-assaulted-while-running-in-central-park/">told the NY Post</a>, &quot;One of them intercepted me &#x2026; as I was getting closer to him he told me to &#x2018;get off the bike&#x2019; &#x2026; and then he punched me and knocked me off the bike,&#x201D; he said. &quot;I fell off the bike and fell over a little fence onto the grass side of the road and he grabbed the bike and started to ride off &#x2026; it was pretty scary, I was trying to size up what it was they wanted.&quot;</p>

<p>The group of five teens took his iPhone 7 and fled. The incident is similar to one that occurred <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161014183050/http://abc7ny.com/news/2-mugged-in-central-park-for-iphones/1549487/">on Friday</a>, when 21-year-old Narish Singh was followed by a group of male teens as he was leaving the park around 11:30 p.m. The men, who stole his smartphone, told him to &quot;run his pockets,&quot; which the suspects also told Angstreich.</p>

<p>Police add that no arrests have been made, and the investigation is ongoing.</p>
