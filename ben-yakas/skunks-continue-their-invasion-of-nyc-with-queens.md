I am absolutely scared to death,&quot;</strong> said victim Anne Burke, whose dog Jesse was sprayed by the beast with one stripe.</p>

<p>Residents believe that the skunks are coming from Forest Park, hiding out in cemeteries near freight railroad tracks along 70th Ave. and Otto Road before making their way to side streets off Metropolitan Ave. between 69th St. and 73rd Place. City Councilwoman Elizabeth Crowley has proposed a law requiring the city Health Department to issue warnings to property owners harboring skunks, raccoons and possums; but its important to note that a skunk spraying does not qualify as grounds for a skunks removal by the city or state&#x2014;that can only happen if it bites or scratches you. </p>

<p>The Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn and Queens, which runs the St. John&apos;s Cemetery in Middle Village, views the skunks as God&apos;s creatures: &quot;It&apos;s really just a natural habitat for them,&quot; said spokesman Rev. Kieran Harrington. Which is a serious problem for some people: &quot;<strong>This is what we&apos;re up against. They&apos;re telling you they&apos;re part of the environment. No, they&apos;re not,&quot;</strong> said local Barbara Oddo.</p>
