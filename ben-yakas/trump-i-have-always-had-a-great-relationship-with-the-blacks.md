<p>If you haven&apos;t gotten your fill of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150713112807/http://gothamist.com/tags/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> mockery yet today, Post editor (and noted Carl Paladino <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150713112807/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/30/video_paladino_gets_into_altercatio.php">enthusiast</a>) Fred Dicker did an interview with him this morning, which reporter Azi Paybarah was live tweeting <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150713112807/http://twitter.com/azipaybarah">here</a>. Some highlights: Trump said &quot;I want to run as a Republican. I don&apos;t want to run as an independent;&quot; he scolded the Daily News for their coverage of him; and he declared proudly, <strong>&quot;I have always had a great relationship with the blacks.&quot;</strong> Is Trump suddenly going to start <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150713112807/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulworth">spitting truth</a>?</p>

<p>You can listen to audio from the interview <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150713112807/http://www.observer.com/2011/politics/trump-always-had-great-relationship-blacks">here</a>. Despite his great relationship with the blacks, Trump admitted he would probably have trouble getting support from African-Americans voters. He probably can&apos;t count on the vote of last night&apos;s guest on <em>The Daily Show</em>, Tracy Morgan, who showed up wearing a Knicks jersey. He told Stewart that he has President Obama&apos;s birth certificate in Brooklyn, and Trump &quot;can come get it if [he] wants to see it.&quot; He also added that he has some people uptown in Manhattan checking Trump out:</p>
