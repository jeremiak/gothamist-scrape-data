<p>With President Bannon&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170319050237/http://gothamist.com/tags/muslimban">refugee and immigration ban</a> not going away anytime soon, bodega and grocery store owners around NYC are planning on shutting down tomorrow in protest.</p>

<p>According to a press release, Yemeni-American merchants have declared a shutdown of their bodegas and grocery stores on Thursday from noon to 8 p.m. to send a message to the Trump administration that they and their families play a vital role in the economic and social fabric of our city. </p>

<blockquote>There are 4 - 6,000 bodegas and grocery stores owned by Yemeni Americans across the city. Initially [it was] suggested they close from 8am - 8pm, but many did not want to disrupt the lives of the very people they serve daily who buy coffee in the morning or children that buy snacks on the way to school. Even in times of struggle, they want to serve their community and their customers.</blockquote>

<p>There will also be a rally held at 5:15 p.m. at Brooklyn Borough Hall (209 Joralemon St. in the back of the building facing the plaza) where some of the merchants <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170319050237/https://thinkprogress.org/new-york-muslim-community-ban-af0d151200fd#.i0ygtccvx">will share the impact</a> the ban has had on them and their loved ones. Many have family members still applying to residency, and whose visa applications <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170319050237/https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/28/new-york-yemenis-trump-immigration-ban-reaction">are now on hold.</a></p>
