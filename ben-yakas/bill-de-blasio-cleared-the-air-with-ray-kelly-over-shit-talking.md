<p>Police Commissioner <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150103064651/http://gothamist.com/tags/raykelly">Ray Kelly</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150103064651/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/15/ray_kelly_insulted_by_mayoral_candi.php">shit-talked to Playboy this month</a> about how all the Democratic mayoral candidates treated him like shit during their campaigns. In particular, he called out Mayor-elect <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150103064651/http://gothamist.com/tags/billdeblasio">Bill de Blasio</a> as &quot;absolutely&quot; full of shit. De Blasio cleared the air with him yesterday over those comments: &#x201C;I had a good conversation with him [Friday], and I have a clear agenda I want to implement,&#x201D; de Blasio <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150103064651/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/bill-de-blasio-cleared-air-top-ray-kelly-article-1.1519151">told reporters</a>. &#x201C;It was a good conversation. We cleared the air, and we&#x2019;re moving forward.&#x201D; Oh to have been a fly on the wall for that incredibly uncomfortable two minute or so conversation! </p>

<p>De Blasio added that he expects Kelly will &quot;work very productively and positively with us&quot; as they transition to the new administration, led by new Police Commissioner Anyone-But-Ray. However, neither de Blasio nor Kelly&apos;s camp would say whether any apologies were given from either side. &#x201C;I have worked with him for over 20 years, respect him, obviously disagree with him on some core issues,&quot; de Blasio said. &quot;I&#x2019;m certain we&#x2019;re going to have an effective transition.&#x201D; &#x201C;They spoke,&#x201D; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150103064651/http://nypost.com/2013/11/16/de-blasio-ray-kelly-clear-air-after-top-cop-blasted-candidates/">added</a> loquacious NYPD spokesman John McCarthy.</p>

<p>At least one of those mayoral candidates agreed with Kelly: &#x201C;Ray Kelly is right to feel betrayed! He was a punching bag for my fellow candidates in the primary, in a disgusting display of pandering,&#x201D; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150103064651/https://twitter.com/SalAlbaneseNYC/status/401325512875720704">tweeted Sal Albanese</a>, who came in last in the primary. </p>

<p>One other comment Kelly made in the interview got people talking as well: when asked whether he understands why &quot;some young men of color who have been stopped for no reason may hate your guts,&quot; Kelly responded:</p>

<blockquote>The notion of hatred has been stirred up by a small number of advocacy groups that have done a great job at marketing this concept. You might read something snarky on Twitter, but I could take you right now to 125th Street in Harlem and young men will stop me for my picture and give me a very favorable and friendly greeting. They understand that we&#x2019;re saving lives in their community, that they&#x2019;re the ones at risk.</blockquote>

<p>The Daily News <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150103064651/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/uptown/ray-kelly-double-mixed-response-harlem-article-1.1518905">decided to test out his theory</a> by taking a Kelly cutout uptown and seeing how people responded. &#x201C;Ray Kelly is part of a racist, white supremacist system,&#x201D; said Harlem book vendor Gerry Louis. &#x201C;Stop-and-frisk doesn&#x2019;t make us safer. He continues to criminalize our community.&#x201D; Well then.</p>
