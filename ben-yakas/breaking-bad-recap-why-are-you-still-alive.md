<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429214323/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/16/breaking_bad_recap_1.php">Last week</a> on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429214323/http://gothamist.com/tags/breakingbad"><em>Breaking Bad</em></a>, Walt had a barrel of laughs, Jesse got chained, and Flynn worked the cash register. This week, Todd gave Jesse ice cream, Saul went to Nebraska, and Walt watched &quot;Mr. Magorium&apos;s Wonder Emporium.&quot; Let&apos;s talk about the newest episode, &quot;Granite State,&quot; below.</p>

<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="//web.archive.org/web/20150429214323if_/http://www.youtube.com/embed/4ww1Q5hBFAA?list=PLF579DA1151B2CD70" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p><strong>New Hampshire Winter Sun</strong>: Despite having a longer running time than last week&apos;s emotional Armageddon of an episode, &quot;Granite State&quot; pushed on the brakes a tiny bit, the better to enjoy a few beautiful, still, dead-eyed moments in New Hampshire with Mr. Lambert (and he didn&apos;t even have to pay us to do so!). After six straight episodes that spanned approximately a week, we finally fill in the details on what happened to Walt that led him to return to ABQ. And to do so, we had our first big time jump since season 5.1 finale &quot;Gliding All Over.&quot;</p>

<p>Since it may have been a bit confusing, here&apos;s the timeline in the second half of the episode: Walt has spent (at least) 3-4 months in New Hampshire by the time he reaches out to Flynn. Walt has too much hair for only one month to have passed; the relationship between Walt and Mr. Vacuum Cleaner Repairman has the feel of routine; and most importantly, this wasn&apos;t the first time Mr. Vacuum Cleaner Repairman had brought chemo to Walt. </p>

<p>Logistically speaking, the show also had to make sure to skip ahead enough to reach his 52nd birthday&#x2014;we know a few months passed between &quot;51&quot; (the fourth episode of season 5.1) and &quot;Gliding All Over&quot; as Walt built up his cross-continent meth empire. The timeline is a little hazy, but it mostly checks out. </p>

<p>On top of this, in terms of emotional beats, Walt needs to be isolated for a longer period; we need to see the angry, petulant ego that defines Walt at the start of the episode wither and decay.</p>

<p>It&apos;s too bad Gilligan didn&apos;t get the extra two episodes he wanted for this half season: if so, maybe Mr. Lambert&apos;s time in New Hampshire could have taken up a whole episode on its own, and we could have dug in and experienced his crushing isolation with &quot;Fly&quot;-like intimacy. It&apos;s a minor quibble though; with only a few strong images&#x2014;Walt muttering &quot;Tomorrow,&quot; too afraid to leave the estate even with his Heisenberg hat on&#x2014;the episode gets it across pretty clearly.</p>

<p><strong>How Much More Unbearable Pain Can Jesse Go Through?</strong>: And/or, how much more can we the audience go through watching Jesse experience unbearable pain? The paper clip escape plan was as doomed as a MacGruber sketch; did anyone really think Jesse would skidaddle out of Camp Neo-Nazi that easily? But who could have seen poor Andrea&apos;s fate coming. She&apos;s a peripheral character who hasn&apos;t been very involved in the show since season four&#x2014;she hasn&apos;t even dated Jesse since early on in the first half of season five. She&apos;s an innocent with a small child, and she has nothing to do with any of this. Except that&apos;s the point: anyone touched by Walt and Jesse are potential collateral damage. </p>

<p>And let&apos;s not forget: the neo-Nazis only knew about Andrea thanks to Walt. That makes two of Jesse&apos;s girlfriends whose deaths were tied up with Walt (even if he didn&apos;t directly cause them). But was it gratuitous to heap even more misery upon Jesse? One or two muttered &quot;bitches&quot; don&apos;t quite make the medicine go down any easier.</p>

<p>Kudos to Aaron Paul: earlier this month, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429214323/http://insidetv.ew.com/2013/09/06/breaking-bad-bryan-cranston-aaron-paul-most-challenging-scene/">he referred to a scene in an upcoming episode</a> as &quot;his toughest test,&quot; and we&apos;d wager Andrea&apos;s death scene was just the one. For a character who has basically been cycling through different variations on one state of being&#x2014;absolutely miserable&#x2014;since the end of season four, he is still able to find new depths, and remain one of the most emotionally raw actors on the show.</p>

<p><strong>&quot;Why Are You Still Alive?&quot;</strong>: It&apos;s the central question of the episode: what is Walt fighting for? Why is he still lashing out (impotently smashing his lamp before the title credits), fighting the fact that <em>he&apos;s lost</em>? He&apos;s lost so badly, he might as well be running away <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429214323/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAp9sFVdERQ">from a rabbit</a>. But no matter how Saul and Mr. Vacuum Cleaner Repairman try to ease him back to reality, he insists he still has business to finish. This husk of a kingpin can&apos;t even keep it together long enough to bully Saul into co-starring in a wintry BB spinoff together without collapsing into a coughing fit.</p>

<p>The question also applies to Jesse: what does his life look like if he survives all this? Will he want to keep living after (inadvertently) causing another person to die? Or like Hank, has Jesse&apos;s fate already been decided ten minutes ago?</p>

<p><strong>&quot;It&apos;s Over:&quot;</strong> Was this the last we&apos;ll ever see of Saul Goodman? Of course not&#x2014;not when the so-called Golden Age Of Television is giving way to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429214323/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/11/breaking_bad_spinoff_better_call_sa.php">Silver Age Of Spinoffs</a>. But this really could be the last time Walter White gets to intimidate everyone&apos;s favorite laser tag enthusiast. If this is how Saul escapes, then we&apos;re just glad he&apos;s headed to Nebraska and not Belize. Saul is the cockroach of the <em>Breaking Bad</em> universe&#x2014;he knows when he&apos;s in over his head, and if that means he has to become &quot;another douchebag with a job and three pairs of dockers,&quot; so be it. At least he has some serious employment opportunities awaiting him:</p>

<p><strong>Mr. Vacuum Cleaner Repairman</strong>: This was an extremely pleasant casting surprise: it turns out that veteran character actor Robert Forster is the guy who makes people disappear, the one Saul&apos;s been trying to push on Walt for several seasons now. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429214323/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B95uV6bZT0w">Max Cherry</a> was perfectly cast as Mike Ehrmantraut 2.0: a professional who took his job seriously, who didn&apos;t rob or murder his (mostly defenseless, cancer-ridden) client once he discovered he had millions of dollars in a barrel. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429214323/http://netw3rking.tumblr.com/post/62035107834/i-didnt-like-it-its-not-a-big-deal">Some critics said they had a problem</a> believing he wouldn&apos;t have turned on Walt, that he would go through the trouble of driving across the country once a month to drop off snacks and newspapers. But the proud professionalism rang true to me, mostly thanks to Forster&apos;s portrayal (like how he asks Walt whether he&apos;d really believe him if he promised to get his money to Skyler and the kids). Plus, he generally seems to have some empathy for Walt</p>

<p><strong>Meth Damon</strong>: Another big surprise in this episode was how much time we spent with everyone&apos;s favorite boy scout neo-Nazi, Todd. That &quot;Opie dead-eyed son of a bitch&quot; showed a true competency for murder and intimidation this episode, while acknowledging his crush on sugar cube addict Lydia Rodarte-Quayle. The romance was turned up to Marvin Gaye-levels this episode, what with Todd threatening Skyler on her behalf and creepily plucking lint from her back. She certainly looks wildly turned on when he mentions the 92% purity.</p>

<p>There was one moment that perfectly summed up everything we need to know about the world&apos;s most polite sociopath: as the neo-Nazi gang watched Jesse&apos;s confession tape, Todd smiles to himself as Jesse describes him shooting Drew Sharpe. It&apos;s a mix of amusement and pride; maybe he&apos;s happy his compatriots know how tough he is, maybe he just thinks it&apos;s cool that someone is talking about him, but either way, it&apos;s a moment that encapsulates who Todd is. And Todd is a creep of the highest magnitude.</p>

<p>Oh, and then there was this plea to his uncle: &quot;This is millions, Jack. No matter how much you got, how do you turn your back on more?&quot; Doesn&apos;t that line remind you of a certain former empire builder?</p>

<p><strong>Remember My Name</strong>: So this is where it all comes together. After a few months isolated in his cabin, Walt finally pulls himself together enough to go call Flynn and try, one last time, to provide for his family. He is justifiably and thoroughly rebuffed by his son, someone who can&apos;t see the gray matter of his twisted logic. &#x201C;It can&#x2019;t all be for nothing,&#x201D; he pleads. But it is. Walt hits his lowest point, and admits defeat by calling the DEA. Finally, there is no more business to be done, no more loose ends that can be tightened or snipped. He resigns himself to a fate that has long been waiting him.</p>

<p>But just like when Walt gave himself up to Hank in the desert two episodes ago, it all went to shit when an unforeseen element is thrown in the mix. Walt sees Gretchen and Elliott Schwartz from his old company, Gray Matter, on Charlie Rose. And he discovers that Walter Hartwell White has already been whitewashed from history&#x2014;they say his only contribution to the company was with the name. Gretchen, his former lover with whom he had a heated exchange in season two, even gives what amounts to a eulogy for Walt. </p>

<p>What really matters to Walt becomes clear: he is Dillinger, he is Jesse James, he is Heisenberg. Walt always wanted recognition for his brilliance&#x2014;that&apos;s why he couldn&apos;t let it go when Hank gave Gale credit for his work in season four. Walt wants to be remembered, just as this season&apos;s slogan warned. </p>

<p>Walt is angry because he has been written out of the story of Gray Matter; he&apos;s angry that his former colleague and lover have usurped his own narrative <em>yet again</em>. But he may also be angry because the interview brings to his attention the fact that someone&#x2014;most likely Jesse and the neo-Nazis&#x2014;is still out there producing his signature blue meth. If his family has completely rejected him, <strong>why is he still alive</strong>? Pride and recognition. Walter White may be dead, but Heisenberg can live on. And that&apos;s how we end up with that chilling, empty final shot of the episode.</p>

<p><strong>Theme Song</strong>: Speaking of which, it was also pretty cool when we heard the full theme song for the first time ever in an episode. </p>

<p><strong>&quot;Ozymandias&quot; Redux</strong>: If you&apos;re still not over the explosive events of last week&apos;s installment, here&apos;s your chance to revisit it: director Rian Johnson tweeted <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429214323/http://imgur.com/a/PrJZ9">a lot of behind the scenes photos along with anecdotes about filming the episode</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Next Week:</strong> We can&apos;t believe it&apos;s all over next week&#x2014;and there&apos;s a lot of plot to go through. Something tells us that the long-awaited M60 showdown will occur sooner in the episode than people expect (and we would wager a certain neo-Nazi gang will be on the other end of the barrel). But there is so much more: will Walt see his family one more time? Will he be arrested as Mr. Vacuum Cleaner Repairman predicted? Who is the ricin for? Jesse, Lydia, Gretchen...or himself? </p>

<p>Vince Gilligan said during Talking Bad that &quot;woodworking&quot; would play into the episode, so make of that what you will. And there&apos;s this:</p>
