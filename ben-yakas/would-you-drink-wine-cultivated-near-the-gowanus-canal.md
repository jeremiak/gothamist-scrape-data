<p>Yeah, we&apos;re willing to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131010072217/http://gothamist.com/2011/07/27/man_shells_out_117g_for_worlds_most.php">spend $117,000 on one bottle of wine</a>, or slurp down a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131010072217/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/08/finally_a_guide_to_pairing_mcdonald.php">Voveti Prosecco with our Big Mac.</a> We love <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131010072217/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/17/born_in_the_united_states_of_red_an.php">wine so much</a>, we&apos;re even willing to accept an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131010072217/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/01/just_a_little_alcohol_might_lead_to.php">elevated risk of breast cancer</a>. But we may have finally met a wine we dare not drink: a Brooklyn man <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131010072217/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/getting_polluted_on_wine_OIt50DnTcGtl14Hf37ma5L?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">has been cultivating a massive, 50-foot grapevine</a> a few blocks from the Gowanus Canal. Because who <em>wouldn&apos;t</em> want <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131010072217/http://gothamist.com/2007/10/03/do_not_go_swimm.php">gonorrhea-rich vino?</a></p>

<p>Joseph Mariano, 73, a retired computer programmer for the Department of Environmental Protection, has been an amateur winemaker since 1994&#x2014;and he laughs in the face of people&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131010072217/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/27/video_gowanus_canal_will_consume_us.php">Gowanus Canal fears</a>. &#x201C;People are afraid of everything&#x2014;from secondhand smoke to wine made near the canal,&#x201D; he told the Post. &#x201C;I once fell into the canal&#x2014;and I&#x2019;m still here.&#x201D; Mariano says he learned his technique from his grandfather, Angelo D&#x2019;Amore of Bushwick: &#x201C;I used to go inside the room where he made it, and smell it. I&#x2019;m sure I used to drink it too.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Mariano and wife Linda moved to the neighborhood in 1976; he shared some of his Gowanus-inspired paintings with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131010072217/http://pardonmeforasking.blogspot.com/2009/10/joseph-mariano-visit-with-gowanus.html">Pardon Me For Asking</a> a few years ago. The newest batch of the delicacy he&apos;s labeled Vinum Nostrum, Latin for &#x201C;Our Wine,&#x201D; will be ready to drink by next September. As for the flavor, the Post says the local soil (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131010072217/http://www.winesnw.com/news_reviews/newsandreviews_technical_terroir.htm">&#x201C;terroir&#x201D;</a>) imparts a fruity nose to the rich, amber-colored Gowanus spirit, with hints of pear, apricots and peach. &#x201C;I have no fear about it. It has a very unique flavor,&#x201D; said Mariano.</p>
