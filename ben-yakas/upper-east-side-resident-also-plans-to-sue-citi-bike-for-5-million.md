                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="10313citi.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20131128051438im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/10313citi.jpeg" width="640" height="480"> <br> <i> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131128051438/http://www.flickr.com/photos/scottlynchnyc/9453141271/">scoboco&apos;s flickr</a></i></div> <p></p>

<p>Yesterday, two pedestrians announced that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131128051438/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/02/citi_bike_tripped_me.php">they were planning to sue Citi Bike</a> after they both tripped over the sidewalk-gray racks. Today, a third person has announced similar plans: a 63-year-old Upper East Sider is suing the city for $5 million after she tripped over a docking station. Which is kind of like the time I tripped over a root while playing soccer at summer camp and decided to sue the tree for $5 million.</p>

She says she took a tumble because the base of the dock looked like the street. In her notice, she says the station&apos;s raised base  &quot;was camouflaged with the roadway.&quot;</p>

<p>Howard Orlick, a 52-year-old legally blind man, is suing Citi Bike for $500 to cover the cost of his medical bills from his trip. Lachonne Shelton, 50, is suing for $1 million after she injured her &quot;knees, left elbow, back and neck&quot; after tripping. Presumably all three people injured by the docks could be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131128051438/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrMf8MRQ0dc">assuaged by a tiny harmonica solo</a> under the right conditions.</p>
