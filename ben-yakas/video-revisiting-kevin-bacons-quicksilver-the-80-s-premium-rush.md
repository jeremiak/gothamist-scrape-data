<p>Although the recent Joseph Gordon-Levitt bike messenger flick <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406153731/http://gothamist.com/tags/premiumrush"><em>Premium Rush</em></a> has inspired some <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406153731/http://gothamist.com/2012/08/27/first_kill_all_the_ignorant_anti-bi.php">controversial reviews and worthy discussions about</a> the city&apos;s relationship with bikers, it has been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406153731/http://www.boxoffice.com/statistics/movies/premium-rush-2011">somewhat of a bust at the box office</a>. Which means that it probably won&apos;t take the place in our heart reserved for <em>Quicksilver</em>, the classic, awful &apos;80s bike messenger movie starring Kevin Bacon: &quot;You&apos;re smart, you have brains, and you throw it all away on a god damn bicycle?&quot;</p>

<p>The movie has it all: there&apos;s the &apos;80s synth-heavy soundtrack; Bacon going from a pinkie ring wearing stock broker to a bad ass cyclist; the biking tips (&quot;Street sign says one way east...I go west&quot;); the extreme cycling tricks (&quot;risk is purely personal, and power is in your every move&quot; as the voiceover puts it); young Laurence Fishburne in a very brief role; and even though it&apos;s set in San Francisco (and was largely filmed in LA), everyone has a NY accent! This is the film Bacon <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406153731/http://fayesvideo.blogspot.com/2011/08/quicksilver.html">once called</a> &quot;the absolute lowest point of my career.&quot; </p>

<p>It&apos;s still possible that <em>Premium Rush</em> could become the cinematic time capsule of NYC&apos;s relationship with cycling in the early part of the 21st century. But it&apos;ll never be the definitive bike messenger movie for one simple reason: no film can hope to scale the heights of <em>Quicksilver</em> without having a bicycle dancing scene.</p>
