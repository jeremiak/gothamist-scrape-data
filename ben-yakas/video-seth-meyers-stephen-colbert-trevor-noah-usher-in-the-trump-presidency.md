<p>Donald Trump will soon be sworn in as the 45th president of the United States, and a large chunk of the country&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170914125648/https://twitter.com/brianstelter/status/822260558191874049">easily 6 in 10 adults</a>, if we want to get really specific&#x2014;are terrified of what that means for our future. Our favorite late night comedians tried to reckon with all this last night in their own ways. </p>

<p>For Seth Meyers, that meant taking a closer look at Trump&apos;s preparations for the inauguration (including coming up with his 2020 slogan, which seems like jumping the gun to put it mildly), and the fact that he&apos;s still not divested from his private businesses, which some scholars see as a violation of the constitution: &quot;I guess that explains the schedule,&quot; he said. &quot;Noon swearing in, 3 p.m. inaugural parade, 6 p.m. impeachment hearing.&quot;</p>

<p>Stephen Colbert brought back his beloved &quot;Stephen Colbert&quot; alternate persona (this guy is Gasbag Colbert, Comedy Central&#x2019;s Gasbag Colbert&apos;s identical brother, to be clear) to thank Obama for eight years of leading this country, in a way only he could: &quot;Well, well, well,  at long last our America-hating, secret Muslim, lead-from-behind, terrorist fist-bumping, hopey-changey apologist in in chief is leaving office,&quot; he said.</p>

<p>Colbert devoted his opening monologue to the looming specter of President Trump: &quot;We all knew this day would come, it&apos;s inevitable. Like death and never seeing his taxes.&quot;</p>

<p>Finally, Trevor Noah brought the darkest take about our reality star president and his endless pursuit of self-promotion: &quot;How is that a president?&#x201D; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170914125648/http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2017/01/19/the-daily-show-s-trevor-noah-previews-trump-s-inauguration-we-re-so-f-cked.html">he asked</a> in disbelief. &#x201C;Oh, guys, we&#x2019;re so fucked.&quot; </p>
