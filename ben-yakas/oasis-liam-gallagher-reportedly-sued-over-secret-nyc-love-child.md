                            <p>Over the weekend, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928023451/http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/5012295/British-rock-star-fears-secret-love-child-will-break-up-his-marriage.html">The Sun reported that</a> a married &quot;responsible&quot; British rock star was desperately trying to keep his NYC love child a secret, for fear that his wife would dump him. In the midst of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928023451/http://laist.com/tags/corymonteith">a lot</a> of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928023451/http://gothamist.com/tags/georgezimmerman">terrible news</a>, the anonymous report provided some momentary distraction and sparked some fun online debate: could it be Chris Martin? Sting? Gavin Rossdale? But according <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928023451/http://www.nypost.com/p/pagesix/rocker_in_love_child_suit_6ATv0MZmc6b0L77FLDNrHO">to the Post</a>, the true baby daddy is none other than former Oasis singer Liam Gallagher, one of the most quotable, irresponsible rock stars in all of history. And Gallagher is now <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928023451/http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2013/07/17/liam-gallagher-love-child_n_3610993.html">suing the NY Post</a> over the report. </p>

<p>The unidentified woman, who is in her 30s and specializes in interviewing celebrities, claims she had an affair with Gallagher in NYC last year, and had a child as a result. She&apos;s suing him for a reported $3 million in Manhattan Family Court. According to The Sun&apos;s source, Gallagher, who has been married to Canadian singer and actress Nicole Appleton since 2008 and has three children, has been doing everything he can to keep things under wraps. &#x201C;This man will do anything to keep this under wraps,&quot; a source told The Sun. &quot;He wants nothing to do with the kid and is prepared to pay big bucks to keep this a secret.&quot; </p>

<p>Gallagher has made no secret of his love for NYC: he bought <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928023451/http://curbed.com/archives/2012/08/06/oasiss-liam-gallagher-buys-piedaterre-on-central-park.php">a $2.5 million pied-&#xE0;-terre</a> on Central Park South last year. There&apos;s also never been a secret about the fact that he lives a life that allows him to literally smell like cigarettes and alcohol at all times. We&apos;re talking about a man who has routinely <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928023451/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/in-the-news--liam-gallagher-bad-boy-cant-stop-looking-back-in-anger-1148670.html">fought his own fans</a>&#x2014;he was even <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928023451/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2292141/Liam-Gallagher-rock-n-roll-Mothers-Day-hes-banned-pub-twice.html">kicked out of a pub twice on Mother&apos;s Day this year</a> due to his bad behavior. </p>

<p>Regardless of whether Liam is or is not the rock star in question, there&apos;s one thing for sure: mocking Mumford and Sons as people who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928023451/http://www.nme.com/news/beady-eye/67943">&quot;eat lentil soup with their sleeves rolled up,</a>&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928023451/http://www.nme.com/news/beady-eye/68000">cursing off his brother</a>, or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928023451/https://twitter.com/liamgallagher/status/226057621424197632">cursing off his brother</a> some more, nobody gives great quote like Liam. </p>
