title: Post Continues Its Crusade To Get Sleeping MTA Workers Fired
---

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:250px; "> <img alt="41011sleeppost.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20111031140816im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/41011sleeppost.jpg" width="250" height="159"> <br> <i>A past Post cover</i></div> The Post <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111031140816/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/mta_agent_sneak_sleep_JKeEIzQLYyz9NIXNE57TmO?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">has caught</a> another MTA station-booth clerk catching some ill-timed zzz&apos;s. They snapped a photo of the unidentified worker sleeping at the 18th Avenue F train stop in Brooklyn at 4 a.m. Wednesday. The worker is now under investigation as a result, and an MTA spokeswoman said, &quot;It goes without saying that such behavior will not be tolerated by MTA New York City Transit and it is deeply disturbing to us.&quot; But here&apos;s what we&apos;re wondering: why does the Post get off so much on catching MTA workers sleeping?<p></p>

<p>Other news sources, including the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111031140816/http://gothamist.com/2005/03/02/hey_mta_youre_on_candid_cameraphone.php">News</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111031140816/http://gothamist.com/2010/08/05/kindly_old_man_will_likely_lose_job.php">NY1</a>, have occasionally spotted MTA workers sleeping on the job&#x2014;we&apos;ve even gotten in on the action at least <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111031140816/http://gothamist.com/2010/08/15/queens_station_agent_overworked_or.php">once</a>&#x2014;but for some reason, the Post takes particular relish in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111031140816/http://gothamist.com/2010/12/27/jfk_security_guards_fired_for_sleep.php">catching them</a>. They go out of their way to put their pictures on the cover of the paper, like subway maintainer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111031140816/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/04/transit_workers_caught_sleeping_on.php">Frank Ryan</a>, and mercilessly mock their exhausted visages. Do Post writers go from station to station every evening between 3 and 5 am, waiting for agents to nod off? Is that some writer&apos;s beat? Do they get paid overtime for it? This isn&apos;t to necessarily excuse the workers behavior&#x2014;we&apos;re just starting to think the Post might have more in common with Patrick Bateman than we ever realized.</p>
