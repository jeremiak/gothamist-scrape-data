<p>Comedy Central has been absolutely killing it with their original programming lately, including brilliant sketch comedians <em>Key And Peele</em>, the surreal shenanigans of <em>Broad City</em>, reality show-aping <em>The Kroll Show</em>, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408144816/http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/television/2014/04/inside_amy_schumer_season_2_the_most_feminist_show_on_television.html">&quot;sneakily feminist&quot;</a> <em>Inside Amy Schumer</em>. Most of those shows have been able to develop an audience along with a heaping of critical praise. But one of the gems of Comedy Central&apos;s recent lineup, <em>Review</em>, has been mostly flying under the radar&#x2014;and now is your chance to get in on one of the most hilarious programs of the year. </p>

<p><em>Review</em> is a starring vehicle for longtime &quot;oh hey, that guy!&quot; comedian Andy Daly (whom you may recall from <em>Eastbound and Down</em>, <em>MADtv</em>, <em>Semi-Pro</em>, <em>Delocated</em>, or countless comedy podcasts). Daly, a NY native, plays Forrest MacNeil, a critic whose job is to review real life experiences on his program &quot;Review With Forrest MacNeil.&quot; He&apos;s sent questions on the show-within-a-show asking what a divorce&#x2014;or an orgy, or road rage, or eating an insane amount of pancakes&#x2014;is like, and he sincerely (and profoundly) tries to review each experience on a scale of one-half to five stars (there is no such thing as zero stars). </p>

<p>That premise alone could be enough to make a funny show&#x2014;but <em>Review</em> gets even better, and much darker, as the season goes along, and you begin to see how MacNeil&apos;s devotion to his job (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408144816/http://collider.com/review-with-forrest-macneil-review/">extreme criticism</a>) is encroaching upon his &quot;real&quot; life, and that of his family, friends and neighbors. Daly, almost always clad in beige khakis, channels the milquetoast, puppy-like enthusiasm he&apos;s known for and twists it ever so slightly until the show becomes a recurring dark night of the soul (albeit, a gut-busting one). </p>

<p>In the third episode, that manifests as an existential crisis which culminates in a glorious, painful, pancake binge; in episode four, it involves meeting a lawyer while dressed as Batman; and in episode seven, it revolves around the phrase &quot;there all is aching,&quot; which makes for one of the funniest things I&apos;ve seen all year. </p>

<p>And Daly is mostly able to play all this without losing his affable demeanor. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408144816/http://www.avclub.com/review/review-finally-star-vehicle-andy-daly-deserves-201387">As The AV Club</a> put it, &quot;Forrest&#x2019;s story is one of those damnably common vocational irony narratives&#x2014;he&#x2019;s reviewing life, but he&#x2019;s not really living it&#x2014;but the goofy gung-ho spirit Daly gives the character (and the heights of insanity that spirit takes him to) hurdle over clich&#xE9;.&quot;</p>
