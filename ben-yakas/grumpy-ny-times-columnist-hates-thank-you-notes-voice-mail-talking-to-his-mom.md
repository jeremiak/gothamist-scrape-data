	<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="31013bilt.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130313191706im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/31013bilt.jpg" width="640" height="420"> <br> <i> Don&apos;t even bother, Mrs. Bilton&#x2014;just try DMing him (Nick Bilton, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130313191706/https://twitter.com/nickbilton">via Twitter</a>)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>It&apos;d be fair to say that many of us at Gothamist HQ sway a bit toward the curmudgeonly side more often than not&#x2014;although at the same time, we know that life <em>really would be better</em> if only we could get all those <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130313191706/http://gothamist.com/tags/santacon">drunk santas</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130313191706/http://gothamist.com/tags/nopantssubwayride">pants-averse folks</a> off our damn lawn. Having said that, NY Times columnist Nick Bilton one-ups our grumpiness <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130313191706/http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/03/10/etiquette-redefined-in-the-digital-age/">with a diatribe against all non-Twitter communication</a> today. Oh, and he hates &apos;thank you&apos; notes: &quot;Some people, especially older ones, appreciate a thank-you message. Others, like me, want no reply.&quot;</p>

<p>Bilton brings up some good points about changing norms in modern communication: sending an email informing someone you left them a voicemail is kind of annoying, and texting someone for their SXSW lineup seems ridiculous. But asking a friend where they can PAY MONEY to buy your book isn&apos;t that bad, and there&apos;s nothing <em>uncivilized</em> about asking for directions to someone&apos;s house (lest they know a better route than the one you&apos;ll find on Google Maps&#x2014;as a driver, this writer frequently forgoes Google&apos;s directions for that reason).</p>

<p>But we can&apos;t shake the feeling this whole column is one giant cry for help from Bilton: &quot;Of course, some people might think me the rude one for not appreciating life&#x2019;s little courtesies. But many social norms just don&#x2019;t make sense to people drowning in digital communication.&quot; Just substitute &quot;people&quot; for &quot;Nick Bilton,&quot; and voila. He&apos;s someone who&apos;s been Let Me Google That For You&apos;d one too many times; someone who has no patience for &quot;irksome communication.&quot; </p>

<p>This is him sending a flare signal to the world to leave him alone...<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130313191706/https://twitter.com/nickbilton">except on Twitter</a>. He really likes Twitter! His colleagues <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130313191706/https://twitter.com/palafo/status/310828437763919872">razz him on Twitter</a>! He&apos;ll even deign to speak to his mother on Twitter...but only on Twitter. </p>

<blockquote>Then there is voice mail, another impolite way of trying to connect with someone. Think of how long it takes to access your voice mail and listen to one of those long-winded messages. &#x201C;Hi, this is so-and-so&#x2026;.&#x201D; In text messages, you don&#x2019;t have to declare who you are, or even say hello. E-mail, too, leaves something to be desired, with subject lines and &#x201C;hi&#x201D; and &#x201C;bye,&#x201D; because the communication could happen faster by text. And then there are the worst offenders of all: those who leave a voice mail message and then e-mail to tell you they left a voice mail message.

<p>My father learned this lesson last year after leaving me a dozen voice mail messages, none of which I listened to. Exasperated, he called my sister to complain that I never returned his calls. &#x201C;Why are you leaving him voice mails?&#x201D; my sister asked. &#x201C;No one listens to voice mail anymore. Just text him.&#x201D;</p>

<p>My mother realized this long ago. Now we communicate mostly through Twitter.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>Someone really needs to call his mother already. Dude, c&apos;mon, just call your mom. If she doesn&apos;t hear your voice, you could <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130313191706/http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/post/the-case-for-calling-mom-in-one-chart/2012/01/06/gIQAv0c1eP_blog.html"><em>literally</em> be killing her</a>. Unless of course you want to risk this happening to you:</p>
