<p>Longtime NYPD beekeeper <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427170919/http://gothamist.com/tags/AnthonyPlanakis">Detective Anthony &quot;Tony Bees&quot; Planakis</a> only filed for retirement at the start <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427170919/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20140807/civic-center/nypds-in-house-bee-expert-buzzes-off-into-retirement">of this month</a>, but NYC has seemingly been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427170919/http://nypost.com/2014/08/21/nypd-bags-a-nest-full-of-hornets-in-the-bronx/">besieged</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427170919/http://gothamist.com/2014/08/16/cops_kill_deadly_swarm_of_yellow_ja.php">with swarms</a> ever since. We all thought Tony Bees was the hero NYC deserved, but not the one it needed right now. We were all wrong&#x2014;and Tony Bees was called back for duty to deal with 50,000 bees in Queens yesterday.</p>

<p>Planakis and Larry Stone, the &quot;Honeybee Helper&quot; at Stoneridge Apiaries, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427170919/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20140822/elmhurst/retired-nypd-bee-expert-tony-bees-returns-remove-50k-insects-from-home">were called in</a> to remove 50,000 bees living in a ceiling at Gregory Hall Condominium on 51st Avenue and 90th Street. Unlike last week&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427170919/http://gothamist.com/2014/08/16/cops_kill_deadly_swarm_of_yellow_ja.php">culling-by-pesticide</a>, these bees (along with more than a dozen honeycombs) were safely removed from the premises; they will be relocated to a farm upstate.</p>

<p>And with that, Planakis withdrew back into the eternal evening of the city. Like Cincinnatus before him, he had been summoned by the people&#x2014;and even when he was handed absolute authority (over bees), he walked away and returned to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427170919/http://gothamist.com/2014/08/16/cops_kill_deadly_swarm_of_yellow_ja.php">&quot;boredom&quot; of retirement</a>. When you tuck your unstung children into bed tonight, give a quiet thanks. We may never see the likes of him buzzing around again.</p>
