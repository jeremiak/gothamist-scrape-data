<p>New Yorkers know that it is our God-given right to vocally complain about all sorts of trivial and not-so-trivial things, including <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150511171630/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/02/have_you_become_complacent_to_the_r.php">rats</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150511171630/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/13/map_nyers_favorite_things_to_compla.php">street lights</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150511171630/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/24/interactive_map_what_neighborhoods.php">dog poop</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150511171630/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/14/311_dispatcher_describes_most_ridic.php">excessive Jewish holidays</a>, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150511171630/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/11/where_all_calls_go.php#photo-1">refrigerator squeaks.</a> But the number one quality-of-life complaint in NYC? The one complaint to unite a city? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150511171630/http://gothamist.com/tags/noise">Noise.</a></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150511171630/http://bigstory.ap.org/article/noise-no-1-quality-life-complaint-nyc">According to AP</a>, &quot;a city hotline&quot; received more than 260,000 noise complaints last year. We previously <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150511171630/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/14/williamsburg_was_nycs_noisiest_neig.php">looked at 311 data</a> about noise complaints and found that Williamsburg received the most calls about excessive volume. But the city identified a few more areas as frequent sources of complaints, including Times Square, the subways (which we <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150511171630/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/30/subway_noise_is_slowly_making_you_d.php">already knew were making us deaf</a>), DUMBO (which we know <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150511171630/http://gothamist.com/tags/dumbo">all too well</a>), the Rivergate apartment building on 34th Street, and parts of Queens near JFK and LaGuardia.</p>

<p>We can add to this list that Woodside residents are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150511171630/http://furmancenter.org/thestoop/entry/summer-of-311">extremely annoyed</a> by &quot;loud talking.&quot; But there&apos;s such a rich tapestry of things NYers love to complain about that it feels unfair to focus on just one thing&#x2014;not when NYers are being forced to live in proximity <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150511171630/http://gothamist.com/tags/askanativenewyorker">to other New Yorkers</a>, not when parents are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150511171630/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/19/hipster_parents_letting_babies_pee.php">au natural toilet training</a> their children, not when there are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150511171630/http://gothamist.com/tags/nytimes">self-parodying NY Times trend pieces</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150511171630/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/05/les_residents_say_adult_kickball_le.php">adult kickball leagues</a>. And certainly not while there are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150511171630/http://gothamist.com/tags/bikelane">bike lanes</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150511171630/http://gothamist.com/tags/billdeblasio">socialist mayors</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150511171630/http://gothamist.com/tags/hipsters">artesinal-breakfast connoisseurs</a> still around. </p>
