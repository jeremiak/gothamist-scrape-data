<p>A janitor at a Fort Greene middle school has been arrested and accused of raping a woman inside the school. Cops say that Hernan Zapata, 51, raped an adult woman inside of an office at the school; police added that the victim was not a student, the parent of a student or a faculty member. &quot;I don&apos;t know why anyone would say that,&quot; his daughter, 21-year-old Michelle Zapata, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501163528/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/brooklyn-school-janitor-charged-rape-article-1.1754947">told the News</a>. &quot;Whoever said that is going to hell.&quot;</p>

<p>Police say Zapata, who is married and also has a 7-year-old son, was on-duty at the time at the school, and was holding the woman against her will in the office. Zapata has been charged with rape, sex abuse, sexual misconduct, unlawful imprisonment and assault. </p>

<p>&quot;This is the craziest thing that has happened to us,&quot; Michelle Zapata said. &quot;There&apos;s no way he would do this. He&apos;s not capable of something like this. He comes straight home after working, when he&apos;s not working, he&apos;s with us.&quot;</p>
