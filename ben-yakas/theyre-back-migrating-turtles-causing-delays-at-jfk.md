And according to reports, it&apos;s happened again this morning! &quot;THE RETURN&gt;&gt; Turtles creating delays at JFK today as they cross runway 31L,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150514154913/https://twitter.com/NYCAviation/status/216541162679451648">tweeted NYC Aviation</a>. &quot;The turtles seem to have a tendency to make the JFK runway crossing the morning after a major June storm. &#x202A;#turtlepower&#x202C;,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150514154913/https://twitter.com/NYCAviation/status/216542034155147265">they added.</a> As you can imagine, passengers are confused:</p>

<p>This really does seem to happen at least once a year <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150514154913/http://gothamist.com/2009/07/08/turtle_power_closes_jfk_runway.php">around this time.</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150514154913/http://gothamist.com/tags/canadageese">Geese</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150514154913/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/25/loose_puppy_causes_laguardia_to_pla.php">dogs</a> have also caused similar airport delays in the past.  Hopefully they can move these little guys to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150514154913/http://gothamist.com/2011/07/06/should_we_move_the_jfk_turtles_to_p.php#photo-1">somewhere nice like Prospect Park.</a></p>
