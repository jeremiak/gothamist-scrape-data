<p>Last week, Manhattan Borough President Scott Stringer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629211335/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/23/what_side_of_manhattan_is_fifth_ave.php">noticed that</a> there was some perplexing signage on bus stops along Fifth Avenue extending from 110th to 59th Street, identifying the streets as West, not East. Technically, the signs were correct, sitting in the western zone of the street grid, but Stringer argued that they should be changed to better reflect their actual position, and not confuse tourists. And yesterday, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629211335/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/01/nyregion/01signs.html?_r=1&amp;partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">an official verdict</a> was issued by the DOT&#x2014;East siders prevailed!</p>

<p>In a letter to Stringer, the city&#x2019;s transportation commissioner Janette Sadik-Khan wrote that the 50 blocks on Fifth Avenue above 59th street have &quot;no intersections with streets having the prefix &#x2018;West.&#x2019; &#x201D; She agreed that the signs had &#x201C;incorrectly&#x201D; identified the cross streets, and she pledged that the proper prefix, &#x201C;East,&#x201D; would appear by the end of April. Stringer drank in his victory, telling the Times, &quot;There was a real contradiction on the streets. It made sense to clarify what was west and what was east.&#x201D;</p>

<p>This of course didn&apos;t stop some grid purists from grumbling: &quot;The DOT can put up whatever signs it wants. <strong>I will always refer to the west side of Fifth Avenue as the West Side of Manhattan. This won&#x2019;t change a thing in my mind</strong>,&#x201D; said Samuel I. Schwartz, a former transportation commissioner and the traffic engineer believed by many to have coined the term gridlock. Mitchell L. Moss, director of the Rudin Center for Transportation at NYU, countered Schwartz stubbornness, and said it reflected the more pragmatic approach of the city: &quot;The Department of Transportation is putting practice above principle. <strong>This reflects the way New Yorkers perceive the city, not the rules of the grid. The Constitution is subject to interpretation, and so is the street grid of New York</strong>.&#x201D;</p>

<p>As far as we&apos;re concerned, East side to the West side, it&apos;s all no diggity. As long as you don&apos;t forget to bag it up: </p>
