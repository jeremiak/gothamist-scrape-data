<p>Following six seasons and two Super Bowl victories, running back Brandon Jacobs parted ways with the Giants and signed with the San Francisco 49ers. But one adorable six-year-old did everything he could to get Jacobs to stay, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405014336/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/07/adorable_kid_sends_brandon_jacobs_3.php">including sending him the contents of his piggybank</a>: $3.36. Jacobs was so moved by the letter from six-year-old Joe Armento, he decided to visit him while in NJ this week, to play in a bouncy house and pay him back for his contribution. &quot;Lil Joe has made my heart grow,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405014336/https://twitter.com/gatorboy45/status/211503809812365312">Jacobs tweeted.</a></p>

<p>Jacobs brought his five-year-old son, Brayden, to meet Joe and his four-year-old brother Nick, and all four played together in a bouncy house for nearly two hours. &quot;He told me he really wanted to get out there with the kids,&quot; mother Julie Armento <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405014336/http://blogs.sacbee.com/49ers/archives/2012/06/jacobs-repays-six-year-old-giants-fan-with-interest.html">told The Sacramento Bee</a>. &quot;He really wanted to enjoy it, and he did. It was amazing.&quot; Jacobs told them he had a great time: &quot;It was just us in the whole place and we were just going room to room - just bouncing and flipping all over the place, hitting each other with balls, sweating, our shirts filthy. We were just dirty, stinky boys, you know?&quot;</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="62112jacobs2.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405014336im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/62112jacobs2.jpg" width="640" height="427"> <br> <i> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405014336/https://twitter.com/juliearmento/status/215524052239003648/photo/1">via Julie Armento</a></i></div> <p></p>

<p>Jacobs gave Joe a signed Giants football helmet with his former number, No. 27., reading: &quot;To Joe: Thanks for being a fan. God bless, Brandon Jacobs.&quot; You can see that above. He topped it all off by also giving him $5 to pay him back for his monetary contribution: <strong>&quot;He had some interest in there just for being a good kid. He&apos;s worth a lot more than that $5 bill I gave him.&quot;</strong></p>

<p>Jacobs explained why Joe&apos;s letter moved him so much: &quot;I&apos;m at a point in my career when people have stopped believing in me and not believing that I can still play. But that&apos;s not the case. Joe believes in me, gave me a lot of confidence and a lot of want-to. And I&apos;m ready to go. I can&apos;t wait until the season starts.&quot;</p>
