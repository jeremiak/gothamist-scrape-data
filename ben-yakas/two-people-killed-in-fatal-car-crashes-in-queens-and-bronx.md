<p>Two people were killed in separate car crashes in Queens and The Bronx last night. According to cops, the first incident happened around 8:15 p.m. when a pedestrian in his 50&apos;s was struck by a car in The Bronx. The man was struck by a white van as he crossed Baychester Avenue, and suffered fatal head and body trauma; the van left the scene before police arrived. </p>

The driver of the white van eventually turned himself in, and was arrested; charges are currently pending. </p>

<p>The second incident happened around 10:15 p.m., when a 49-year-old man crashed his car while traveling northbound on the Cross Island Parkway near exit 26. He struck the right side guard rail, which caused his Toyota Corolla to flip over and eject the driver. <br>
&#x201C;It was loud. I thought it was the train that runs behind my block,&#x201D; witness John Carter, who lives across the street from where the incident occurred, told the Post. &#x201C;I came over here and see the body just laying right in the middle of the street. It&#x2019;s ugly right there. This is horrible.&#x201D; That driver died at the scene.</p>

<p>And on Long Island, 37-year-old Kyle Norton <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150103062917/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local/long_island&amp;id=9328379">was arrested for drunk driving</a> after he allegedly crashed into a school bus in Brentwood Friday afternoon, fled the scene, and then crashed into a pregnant woman&apos;s vehicle close by. Norton was charged with DWI, Leaving the Scene of an Accident, Aggravated Unlicensed of a Motor Vehicle 3rd Degree, and Criminal Possession of a Controlled Substance 7th Degree. </p>
