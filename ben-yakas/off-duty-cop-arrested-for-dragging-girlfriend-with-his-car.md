<p>An off-duty NYPD officer has been arrested for allegedly dragging his girlfriend from his speeding car and then fleeing the scene. Officials say that Julio Jimenez, 29, was arguing with his girlfriend around 2 a.m. outside the couple&apos;s home in the Bronx on Saturday. The 23-year-old girlfriend, whose name hasn&apos;t been released, was leaning into the backseat of the car when Jimenez allegedly started driving off with his girlfriend only partially inside the vehicle.</p>
