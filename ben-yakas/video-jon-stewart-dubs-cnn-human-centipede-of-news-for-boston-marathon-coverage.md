<p>You may recall that CNN <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150825135908/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/17/arrest_made_in_connection_with_bost.php">messed up in a major way yesterday afternoon</a> when they announced that an arrest had been made in the Boston marathon bombings&#x2014;only to walk back that exclusive an hour later, when it became very clear that no suspect had been identified yet. Jon Stewart and the Daily Show <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150825135908/http://www.politico.com/blogs/media/2013/04/dancing-on-the-graves-of-old-media-161929.html">danced on the graves of &quot;old media&quot;</a> last night, eviscerating CNN for reporting a &quot;news story as imagined by M. Night Shyamalan.&quot; &quot;Oh, it&apos;s exclusive because it was completely f*cking wrong,&quot; Stewart concluded. &quot;Just out of curiosity, did any of your sources end their tip offs to you with the phrase, &apos;Bababooey&apos;?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We&apos;re accustomed to 24 hour news networks thriving on conflict,&quot; Stewart continued. &quot;Generally, though, that conflict is between two outside parties&#x2014;political opponents, pundits&#x2014;but CNN&apos;s reporters have discovered that they can remove the middle man and spend hours of programming fighting amongst themselves. <strong>They have figured out a way to shit in their own mouths. CNN has become the Human Centipede of News</strong>.&quot;</p>

<p>The segment concluded with an exclusive, possibly credible report of an unconfirmed arrest of &quot;a dark skinned male, possibly white, or maybe a woman, it could be a mannish-woman, or an effeminate man.&quot; </p>
