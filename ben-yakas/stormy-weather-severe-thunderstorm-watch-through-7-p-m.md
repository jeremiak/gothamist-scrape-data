<p>Last week, we got excited at the prospect of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428150457/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/01/heads_up_severe_thunderstorm_watch.php">a severe thunderstorm that promised to bring</a> with it 70 mph winds and hail up to two inches in diameter. That storm never materialized, nor did the one that was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428150457/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/04/mother_nature_planning_her_own_fire.php">supposed to ruin our July 4th BBQ</a>. But third time might be the charm:  the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428150457/http://alerts.weather.gov/cap/wwacapget.php?x=NY124CB79A4050.SevereThunderstormWatch.124CB79B6930NY.WNSWOU7.cab62c4ee84d125cf86d1b5af6dfdff7">National Weather Service has issued</a> a severe thunderstorm watch for the NYC area through 7 p.m. tonight. And judging by the clouds that have rolled in, this one might really happen!</p>

<p>Of course, it hasn&apos;t made it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428150457/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/07/some_like_it_hot_temps_expected_to.php">any less oppressive outside</a>, so be careful out there if you&apos;re heading to CBGB Fest in Central Park or Times Square this evening. And you might want to consider ducking back inside if you&apos;re at an outdoor pool right now. While you wait to see if this is for real or another tease, listen to the Go-Betweens classic, &quot;Clouds.&quot;</p>
