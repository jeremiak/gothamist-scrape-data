Dr. Adam W. Levinson, an Assistant Professor in the Division of Robotics and Minimally Invasive Surgery, has been charged with unlawful surveillance in the second degree. But he could be facing even more charges now that police have discovered evidence that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429081059/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/accused-pervert-urologist-pen-camera-peek-women-skirts-new-york-subway-struck-sources-article-1.1128802?localLinksEnabled=false">this wasn&apos;t the first time</a> he utilized his tiny pen camera on unsuspecting female straphangers.</p>

<p>At least 19 other video clips were found in Levinson&apos;s home; the clips allegedly show him following women around the city in streets and subways, including some in which the camera was pointed up the dresses of at least two different women. Police also found more lewd photos, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429081059/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2012/08/03/more-evidence-found-at-home-of-urologist-accused-of-secretly-peeping-up-womans-skirts/">according to CBS,</a> and have seized all his computers, cameras and &#x201C;everything that can hold a digital media file&#x201D; from his home and office.</p>

<p>Levinson was caught on Tuesday by a former TSA agent <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429081059/http://gothamist.com/2012/08/03/former_tsa_agent_caught_alleged_ups.php">who spotted his camera pen</a> clipped to a newspaper during the evening rush hour on a downtown 4 train&#x2014;Sheldon Birthwright told cops he saw Levinson take video of two different women that evening. Mount Sinai has since suspended Levinson, and is &quot;performing its own investigation for the protection of its patients and employees.&quot;</p>
