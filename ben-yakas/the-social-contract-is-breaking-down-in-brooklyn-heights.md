<p>Tis the season for passive-aggressive signs in Brooklyn Heights, it seems: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408102803/http://brooklynheightsblog.com/archives/46829">Brooklyn Heights Blog</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408102803/http://brooklynheightsblog.com/archives/46821">brings the two</a> signs above to our attention. Obviously there have been some issues with disposing trash in the neighborhood. The problem: one sign is adamant that locals should only dispose of dog poop at home or in corner garbages on the street...and the other sign is adamant that locals DON&apos;T use those corner garbages because of the rats. There&apos;s no winning this one&#x2014;but at least you can always throw your trash <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408102803/http://gothamist.com/2012/08/30/will_fewer_mta_trash_cans_mean_fewe.php"><strike>into MTA cans in subway stations</strike></a> away on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408102803/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/23/feds_ok_with_sending_manhattans_tra.php">the Upper East Side.</a></p>
