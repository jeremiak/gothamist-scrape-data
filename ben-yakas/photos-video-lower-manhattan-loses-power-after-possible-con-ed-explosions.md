<p><strong>[UPDATES BELOW]</strong> Large parts of Manhattan below midtown are now in the dark after a reported explosion that may have been at a Con Ed building. &quot;Huge explosion at 14th st. All of downtown is now dark,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161036/https://twitter.com/jcn">tweeted Jesse Chan-Norris.</a> Our own Chris Robbins adds that he saw a &quot;massive explosion here in LES then all went dark.&quot; Check more tweets below, and we&apos;ll update once we learn more. </p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161036/http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2012/10/29/thousands-without-power-before-sandy-makes-landfall/">According to the Journal</a>, Con Ed reports that a substation equipment failure knocked out power for 62,000 customers in Greenwich Village and Lower Manhattan. The utility also briefly lost power at its central command center near Union Square, but reportedly is back up now. Check out the photo below of the explosion that caused the power outage, seen from Williamsburg:</p>

<p>Con Ed spokesman Bob McGee has now confirmed that over 250K customers in Manhattan below midtown are without power. Specifically, he said that &quot;pretty much everyone&quot; south of 39th Street to the Battery are without power. Here are two more pics from inside the blackout:</p>

<p><b>Update</b>: Con Ed said that the substation could be repaired by the end of the week.  It was apparently flooded by 6 feet of water and added, &quot;No Con Edison employees are trapped in a building. The story spreading is a rumor.&quot;  However, the video of the explosion could be real, since there was an explosion </p>
