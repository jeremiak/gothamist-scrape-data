<p>Yesterday, Seth Meyers compared Donald Trump <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170129192705/http://gothamist.com/2017/01/26/seth_meyers_accurate.php">to a cranky toddler</a>&#x2014;and that was <em>before</em> he saw Trump&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170129192705/http://gothamist.com/2017/01/26/president_is_delusional_nbd.php">first televised interview as president,</a> in which he turned his batshit crazy narcissism and conspiracy theorizing up to 11. Meyers attempted to disassemble all of Trump&apos;s many false claims from the interview in a segment last night, from the voter fraud lies to the border wall payment bullshit to his ongoing obsession with the inauguration crowd size. Just about everything Trump ranted about &quot;continues to persist in what is either a lie or a delusion.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;In the end, if you were hoping Trump would use the ABC interview to offer a hopeful, unifying message for the country, you were probably disappointed,&quot; Meyers said. &quot;Instead, he pulled the anchor aside to show him an inauguration photo and once again brag about his crowd size.&quot;</p>

<p>Jimmy Kimmel was equally fascinated by Trump&apos;s trainwreck of an interview, picking apart all the very nice things Trump had to say about himself.</p>

<p>Kimmel also took some of the audio from the interview and matched them up with video from the <em>Justice League</em> cartoon to hammer home how much Trump sounds like a supervillain. </p>

<p>And Trevor Noah over at the Daily Show was also horrified at Trump&apos;s demeanor in the interview, comparing him to Heath Ledger&apos;s Joker.</p>
