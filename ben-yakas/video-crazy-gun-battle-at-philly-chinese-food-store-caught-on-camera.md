<p>Every once in a while, we like to check up on our dearly beloved sixth borough, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130605042807/http://gothamist.com/tags/philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>, and see how things are holding up there. And based on the video below, which captures a harrowing gun battle in a Chinese food store earlier this week, it seems the mood of the city is <em>slightly terrifying</em>.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130605042807/http://www.myfoxphilly.com/story/21758290/dramatic-video-of-man-shooting-into-chinese-food-store-search-is-on-for-suspect">According to police</a>, a man wearing gray sweats carrying a handgun walked up to the door of the Chinese Food store at North 18th Street around 10:30 p.m. on Tuesday. As you can see in the surveillance video, six men are in the lobby of the store when the attacker tries to enter with his gun raised. Four of them dramatically try to hold the door closed while two others duck to the rear of the lobby out of sight. The four men struggle to keep the gunman out, until eventually the suspect steps back and shoots through the glass, striking three of the men.</p>

<p>The three men who were shot were all between the ages of 19 and 22 years-old; their injuries were non-life threatening. Police are still looking or the gun suspect. </p>
