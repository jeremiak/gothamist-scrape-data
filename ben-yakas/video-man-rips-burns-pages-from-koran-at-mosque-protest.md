<p>[<b>Updated with video below</b>] An unidentified man began ripping pages of the Koran and burning them today at a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150209173903/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/10/never_forget_to_pimp_your_ride_to_t.php">protest</a> of the proposed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150209173903/http://gothamist.com/tags/mosque">Islamic community center and mosque</a> near Ground Zero. &quot;<strong>If they can burn American flags, I can burn the Koran. America should never be afraid to give their opinion</strong>,&quot; the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150209173903/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/09/11/2010-09-11_man_ignites_koran_near_ground_zero_apparently_prompted_by_florida_pastor_terry_j.html">Daily News reports he shouted</a>.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150209173903/http://www.politico.com/blogs/maggiehaberman/0910/Quranburner_near_Park51.html?showall">Maggie Haberman</a>, he also screamed, &quot;I&apos;m Mapplethorping the Quran!&quot;  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150209173903/http://animalnewyork.com/2010/09/ground-zero-koran-desecrated/">Animal adds</a> that the man was quickly taken by the NYPD and escorted away from the protest, trailed by a group of reporters.</p>

<p>The News attributes the unidentified man&apos;s behavior to Pastor Terry Jones, who earlier this week threatened to hold a Koran-burning on Sept. 11. But didn&apos;t the man hear, Jones <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150209173903/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/11/florida_pastor_stops_playing_footsi.php">called off the burning</a> this morning on The Today Show! Doesn&apos;t he watch NBC on Saturday mornings?</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: You can see video of the scene, including the man tearing the pages and the resulting media crush, courtesy of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150209173903/http://animalnewyork.com/2010/09/ground-zero-koran-desecrated/">Animal&apos;s Bucky Turco</a>.</p>
