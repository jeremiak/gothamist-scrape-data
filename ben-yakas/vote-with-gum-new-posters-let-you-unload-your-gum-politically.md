										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="102512gum.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170330205123im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_arts_john/102512gum.jpg" width="640" height="480"> <br> <i> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170330205123/https://twitter.com/ceeevoon/status/261505754069073920">Claire Voon</a></i></div> <p></p>

<p>Gun control gibberish, Romnesia, binders full of women, Big Bird, rape apologists, Biden&apos;s swimwear&#x2014;it&apos;s completely understandable if, like Mayor Bloomberg, you&apos;re crabby about having to choose between <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170330205123/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/21/bloomberg_disses_obama_romney_says.php">a turd sandwich or a giant douche</a> during this hotly contested <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170330205123/http://gothamist.com/tags/election2012">election season.</a> So why not let off some steam by voting with your used polyisobutylene!</p>

<p>The above sign was spotted at the northeast corner of 36th Street and 6th Avenue in Manhattan&#x2014;but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170330205123/http://gumelection.com/">judging by their website</a>, it&apos;s spreading around the city to Bushwick and the East Village. So go forth and make sure your used gum really counts for something this election. At this rate, it&apos;s bound to have as good a turnout <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170330205123/http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0781453.html">as the real one.</a></p>
