<p>On <em>Full Frontal</em> this week, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170925123458/http://gothamist.com/tags/samanthabee">Samantha Bee</a> took stock of Democratic in-fighting over what went wrong with the election, focusing on the backlash against &quot;identity politics.&quot; And she tries to differentiate between &quot;loser Stockholm syndrome&quot; and taking talking points from Fox News dummies. &quot;Identity politics is the dismissive term for what we used to call &apos;civil rights&apos; and &apos;equality,&apos;&quot; Bee said, before dismantling Republican arguments that Hillary Clinton didn&apos;t talk about the economy and new jobs. </p>

<p>&quot;Democrats, I know you&apos;re having a rough time,&quot; she said toward the end of the segment. &quot;You hate being lost in the wilderness. You have allergies, and you were reading a book in the corner when your scout leader taught everyone which leaves to avoid. But if your panic over a loss makes you abandon both your principles and the people who actually vote for you, then you&apos;ll be in the wilderness for a decade, or until Trump&apos;s cabinet sells the wilderness to oil companies, so really, about a month.&quot;<br>

<p>She took a break from the &quot;nonstop shit-geyser of presidential news&quot; to do a segment on the equally shitty Ohio &quot;heartbeat bill,&quot; which would ban any abortions in that state once a fetus&apos;s heartbeat was heard, which can happen as early as six weeks. &quot;Six weeks? What the hell Ohio? At six weeks, most women won&apos;t know they&apos;re pregnant&#x2014;especially now, since every time we wake up and realize Trump is president, we all have morning sickness.&quot;</p>

<p>And in another segment, correspondent Ashley Nicole Black went full-<em>Mr. Robot</em> with a piece on Russian hacking. </p>
