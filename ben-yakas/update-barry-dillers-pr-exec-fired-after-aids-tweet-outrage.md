<p><strong>[Update Below]</strong> Yesterday, professional public relations person Justine Sacco, a NY-based PR chief at IAC, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425145609/http://gothamist.com/2013/12/20/barry_dillers_publicist_thinks_aids.php">caused waves of outrage on social media</a> after she made the above tweet about AIDS and Africa. Sacco was en route to Africa when her tweet blew up, sparking a hashtag <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425145609/https://twitter.com/search?q=%23HasJustineLandedYet&amp;src=hash">#HasJustineLandedYet</a>. Sacco, who described herself as &quot;CorpComms at IAC. Troublemaker on the side. Also known for my loud laugh,&quot; eventually deleted her entire Twitter account (you can read <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425145609/http://gothamist.com/2013/12/20/barry_dillers_publicist_thinks_aids.php">some of her more peculiar tweets here</a>). And <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425145609/http://iac.com/">IAC</a> removed her name from its website&#x2018;s media contacts list <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425145609/http://www.businessinsider.com/justine-sacco-landing-live-tweeting-2013-12">by the time she landed.</a></p>

<p>IAC, which is the parent company of things like OKCupid, Vimeo, The Daily Beast, Match.com, and CollegeHumor, gave out this statement about the tweet:</p>

<blockquote>This is an outrageous, offensive comment that does not reflect the views and values of IAC. Unfortunately, the employee in question is unreachable on an international flight, but this is a very serious matter and we are taking appropriate action.</blockquote>

<p>Twitter user <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425145609/https://twitter.com/Zac_R">Zac_R</a>, who lives in Cape Town, picked up on the controversy, and claims he went to the airport (which is close to where he lives) to see her when she landed. He claims he spoke to Sacco&apos;s father (who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425145609/https://twitter.com/lea/status/414395473965772800">might be a billionaire</a>), who allegedly said of his daughter&apos;s twitter faux pas, &quot;I&apos;m so incredibly ashamed of her. She&apos;s a fucking idiot.&quot; You can see some of his tweets of the alleged encounter (plus photos) below:</p>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Yup. Justine didn&apos;t just delete her tweet. She&apos;s deleted her whole account. Cowardice over bravery any day of the week. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425145609/https://twitter.com/search?q=%23HasJustineLandedYet&amp;src=hash">#HasJustineLandedYet</a></p>&#x2014; Zac (@Zac_R) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425145609/https://twitter.com/Zac_R/statuses/414263331835637760">December 21, 2013</a></blockquote>

<p>At least one decent thing came out of this whole mess: the organization Aid for Africa bought the domain <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425145609/http://justinesacco.com/">justinesacco.com</a> and set up a page for donations.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: According <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425145609/https://twitter.com/brianstelter/status/414498850733580289">to CNN&apos;s Brian Stelter</a>, Sacco has indeed been laid off:  &quot;We take this issue very seriously, and we have parted ways with the employee in question,&quot; IAC said in a statement. &quot;There is no excuse for the hateful statements... We hope, however, that time and action, and the forgiving human spirit will not result in the wholesale condemnation of an individual who we have otherwise known to be a decent person at core.&quot;</p>
