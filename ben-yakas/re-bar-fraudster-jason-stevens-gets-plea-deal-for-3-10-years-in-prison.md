<p>Infamous reBar owner <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502102609/http://gothamist.com/tags/jasonstevens">Jason Stevens</a>, who abruptly shut down his business at the end of May, stiffing workers and couples hundreds of thousands of dollars, has agreed to a plea deal. The Brooklyn DA&apos;s office confirmed that Stevens pled guilty to grand larceny 2 and four counts of criminal tax fraud in the second degree today; he is facing 3 1/3 to 10 years imprisonment as a result.</p>

<p>The plea deal does not include any criminal charges related to the wedding clients he screwed over; Brooklyn DA Ken Thompson&#x2019;s office said that stealing couples&apos; money would be a civil matter. As we previously reported, many of the couples who were screwed by Stevens with the shuttering of reBar <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502102609/http://gothamist.com/2014/05/15/rebar_workers_save_day.php">are still planning</a> on joining together for a class action lawsuit. And <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502102609/http://gothamist.com/2014/05/23/stranded_rebar_couple_become_first.php">at least two couples</a> have already filed their own lawsuits against him as well.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502102609/http://gothamist.com/2014/05/11/rebar_owner_owed_irs_millions_claim.php">Some former employees</a> told us that Stevens made off with around $150,000 in wedding deposit checks and $27,000 in cash. Stevens had been audited by the IRS last year, and those former staffers suggest he owed $2.5-3 million in unpaid sales tax. </p>

<p>Couples outside the court today had mixed feelings about the deal: &quot;We&#x2019;re happy to see that he&#x2019;s facing jail time, but we want justice for the brides and grooms, too,&quot; Victoria Friedrich, a teacher who lost nearly $20K on her Feb 2015 reBar wedding, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502102609/http://nypost.com/2014/06/12/rebar-owner-cops-plea-lands-in-jail-for-at-least-3-12-years/">told the Post</a>. &quot;Why is it a crime when you steal from the government but not from citizens?&quot;</p>
