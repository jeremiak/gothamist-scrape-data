<p>Over the weekend, a pit bull puppy <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424161224/http://gothamist.com/2012/08/15/pit_bull_puppy_suffers_broken_neck.php">was hospitalized with a broken neck</a> after being brutally thrown from a moving car in Long Island. Three-month-old pup Joey, who was tossed out in a trash bag, fractured six neck vertebrae when he hit the ground. ASPCA and the Suffolk County SPCA are now offering a combined $20K reward for any information leading to an arrest and conviction in the case.<br>
<span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right"> <img alt="81612dog2.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424161224im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/81612dog2.jpg" width="250" height="250"> <br> <i style=" width:250px; ;display:block"> Joey</i></div> <blockquote>&#x201C;We were both outraged and saddened to hear about this disturbing case of violent abuse, and the callousness that was demonstrated by those responsible,&#x201D; said Matt Bershadker, senior vice president of the ASPCA&#x2019;s Anti-Cruelty Group. &#x201C;While our ultimate hope is that these types of heinous acts never occur, this is a message that cruelty toward animals will not be tolerated. We are pleased to be in a position to help those who are helping Joey.&#x201D;</blockquote><p></p>

<p>&quot;Somebody knows what they did,&quot; Roy Gross, chief of the Suffolk SPCA, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424161224/http://www.newsday.com/long-island/suffolk/aspca-sets-20-000-reward-for-abused-pit-bull-puppy-1.3907910">told Newsday</a>. &quot;Somebody will go in a bar and talk...This person has to be apprehended, taken off the streets and punished.&quot; He noted that serial killers often start as people who abuse and torture animals: &quot;Maybe you don&apos;t care about an animal, but do you care about your fellow human being or a child?&quot; Gross said. &quot;Because people like that have no regard for anybody.&quot;</p>

<p>In addition to his neck injuries, doctors say Joey was malnourished, covered with fleas, and had bite marks on his neck, which might indicate the pup had been used as a bait dog by dog fighters. But on the plus side, the Veterinary Medical Center of Long Island wrote in an update <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424161224/http://www.vmcli.com/">on their website</a> that Joey &quot;slightly moved his front feet early this morning, which is great news! He continues to have a great appetite, and gets stronger every day!&quot;</p>
