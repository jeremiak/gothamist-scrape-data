<p>A Queens bodybuilder is accused of fatally throwing his dog out the third story window of his apartment. Witnesses say that they saw Brooklyn, a Chinese Shar-Pei, thrown out the window of the Long Island City apartment around 8:30 p.m Monday. &quot;I saw it coming out the window. I heard the yelp when it hit the ground. I heard the thud. It just missed a woman,&quot; a witness <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429104647/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2011/09/14/2011-09-14_cruel_lunkhead_tosses_dog_plays_dumb__cops.html">told the News</a>. The dog&apos;s owner, bodybuilder Milan Rysa, later claimed to police that he had been sleeping the whole time. Below, you can see a very sad picture of the dog in the aftermath of the incident.</p>

<p>WItnesses say that Rysa, 30, was playing loud thumping music before the incident occurred. &#x201C;I watched the dog fall from the middle third story window. As soon as the dog hit the ground, I watched the lights in the apartment turn off and the blinds close,&quot; a witness <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429104647/http://global.christianpost.com/news/dog-killed-as-new-yorker-throws-pet-out-of-window-55508/">told the Christian Post.</a></p>

<p>Neighbors told the News that despite <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429104647/http://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.55509548665.68920.521988665">fawning picture albums of the dog on his Facebook</a> (&quot;My Lil Bad Boy&quot;), Rysa routinely abused the animal, keeping him in the public hallway outside his apartment, fenced in by a toddler gate. In addition, they claim he would bring Brooklyn to the roof to go to the bathroom, hurl its feces onto nearby rooftops, then leave the dog unattended for hours as the hot rooftop burned his paws. Rysa has been charged with aggravated animal cruelty and reckless endangerment, and was taken to Elmhurst Hospital Center for a psychiatric evaluation.</p>
