                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="102713homeless.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203045559im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/102713homeless.jpg" width="640" height="425"> <br> <i> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203045559/http://www.flickr.com/photos/fsln/2547485125/">street stars&apos; flickr</a></i></div> <p></p>

<p>Considering the fact that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203045559/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/18/the_american_dream_in_action_homele.php">approximately 50,000 people</a> spend the night in NYC homeless shelters, and there are more people <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203045559/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/24/amount_of_people_waiting_for_public.php">languishing on the waiting list for public housing</a> than there are total public housing units in NYC, it&apos;s safe to say that this city is currently going through its worst <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203045559/http://gothamist.com/tags/homelessness">homelessness epidemic</a> in decades. And the NY Post just realized that today! <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203045559/http://nypost.com/2013/10/27/subways-overrun-with-homeless-as-panhandling-busts-down/">They have a report</a> all about the increased amount of homeless people on the subways&#x2014;and they&apos;re able to connect that with the stop-and-frisk backlash <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203045559/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/24/cops_bitch_to_ny_post_that_stop-and.php">they&apos;ve been touting for months.</a> Don&apos;t they know this is all just <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203045559/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/19/bloomberg_thinks_homelessness_is_go.php">a sign of a vibrant economy?!</a></p>

<p>The amount of homeless has increased 13% since last year, according to the Department of Homeless Services. In connection with that, the number of panhandler/peddler arrests in the subway have increased over the past year, with 409 arrested so far in 2013 versus just 395 in 2012. But because there have been a dramatic decrease in those arrests from 2011, when there was an enormous 930 arrests&#x2014;which were mostly due to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203045559/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/mayor-bloomberg-credit-busting-panhandlers-subways-beg-crackdowns-article-1.159783">a quality-of-life initiative Operation Moving Target</a> which is no longer in play.</p>

<p>So how does this all connect to stop-and-frisk? The Post turns to Councilman Peter Vallone Jr., who chairs the City Council&#x2019;s Public Safety Committee, for the money quote: &#x201C;Police are much more hesitant to be proactive and approach people who may be committing low-level crimes because of anti-NYPD sentiment that&#x2019;s been growing in political circles,&#x201D; he told them. &#x201C;If you are too afraid to approach, then crimes like loitering, open containers and aggressive panhandling will go unpunished.&#x201D; </p>

<p>Yeah, this is because cops are afraid to arrest panhandlers, and not because there&apos;s an alarming <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203045559/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/24/amount_of_people_waiting_for_public.php">lack of affordable housing</a> (the waiting list for affordable housing has soared to 270,000 people; the total amount of occupied public housing units is 178,900), there&apos;s no room in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203045559/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/05/nyc_faces_homeless_epidemic_not_see.php">housing shelters</a> (homeless families make up 78% of people staying in the city&apos;s administrative shelters, a number that has risen by 73% since Bloomberg took office), and what new housing shelters there are are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203045559/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/06/tense_battle_over_potential_greenpo.php">routinely protested</a> by their communities. </p>

<p>But hey, the Post has always been known <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203045559/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/01/ny_post_homeless_freeloaders_enjoy.php">to show the utmost sensitivity when it comes to homeless issues</a>, so we&apos;re sure they didn&apos;t mean anything by this. And it&apos;s not like they ended their piece with a random quote about the subways turning into &quot;Mad Max&quot; because of homeless people, right? Oh wait...</p>

<blockquote>&#x201C;I believe this can turn into &#x2018;Mad Max&#x2019; down here,&#x201D; said Maurice Solomon of The Bronx. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s a safe haven &#x2014; it&#x2019;s warm for them, and people give them food.&#x201D;</blockquote>
