<p>Former <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422150334/http://gothamist.com/tags/mayorbloomberg">Mayor Bloomberg</a> (remember him?) may not be remembered <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422150334/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/02/de_blasio_inauguration.php">quite the way</a> he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422150334/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/19/tell_us_what_bloombergs_legacy_is_n.php">had hoped</a>, but there&apos;s no denying that he dramatically <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422150334/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/17/ny_times_gives_interactive_tour_sho.php">changed the landscape</a> of NYC through bike lanes, new buildings construction, and rezoning. And <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422150334/http://www.streetfilms.org/">Streetfilms</a>, which produces short films about transportation around the world, appreciates him for at least one of these things. </p>

<p>After praising the Bloomberg administration (including out-going NYC DOT Commissioner Janette Sadik-Khan) for their work making streets more livable, they write: &quot;We have similarly high hopes for Mayor de Blasio as he takes office...and look forward to what he and his new NYC DOT Commissioner Polly Trottenberg [will do]. As much as has been done, the large majority of our streets still need reforms, we need drastic policy change, slower speed limits and traffic calming for our most vulnerable citizens. Hopefully, this short gets them excited to top the transportation record of the Bloomberg administration.&quot;</p>

<p>Below, check out their video showing how Times Square, Madison Square, Herald Square, Kent Avenue, the Brooklyn Waterfront, Queensboro Bridge, 9th Avenue, and more spots around Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens have radically changed over the course of Bloomberg&apos;s time in office.</p>
