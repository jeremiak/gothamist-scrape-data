<p>The Occupy Wall Street protests which began in NYC just over a month ago went global this weekend&#x2014;and across the nation, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150418062548/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/2011/10/16/2011-10-16_hundreds_arrested_at_occupy_events_in_chicago_denver_arizona_as_movement_spreads.html?r=news">hundreds of protesters were arrested</a> as cops clashed with demonstrators in Chicago, Phoenix, Denver and Raleigh.

Protesters had assembled a tent city and formed a human chain while refusing to move from the park. Chi-town resident Joseph Eichler wondered why Mayor Rahm Emanuel wasn&apos;t more like a certain local hero: &quot;I&apos;d like to ask why (New York Mayor Michael) Bloomberg let the people stay in the park peacefully and clean up their own mess, and Rahm Emanuel won&apos;t let us do the same.&quot; </p>

<p>In Phoenix, Arizona, about 40 Occupy Phoenix demonstrators were arrested just after midnight after refusing to clear out of Margaret T. Hance Park, similar to Chicago. Twenty-four people were arrested in Denver amid physical clashes with police in Civic Center, near the state capitol building; and 19 people were arrested <br>
in Raleigh, North Carolina after their permit to demonstrate on the grounds of the state capitol expired.</p>
