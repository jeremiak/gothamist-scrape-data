<p>Sometime after the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427162058/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/24/live_blog_katie_couric_interviews_m.php">riveting Katie Couric daytime interview</a> with Manti Te&apos;o, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427162058/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/30/video_fake_dead_girlfriend_hoaxer_a.php">we thought we were finally done</a> with this whole fake dead girlfriend football scandal hoax of the century thing. We <em>really</em> wanted to be done with it&#x2014;but then we heard admitted hoaxer Ronaiah Tuiasosopo perform the voice of Lennay Kekua for Dr. Phil, and had our minds blown. You can watch the clip and hear Tuiasosopo&apos;s insanely realistic female voice <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427162058/http://deadspin.com/5980822/heres-ronaiah-tuiasosopo-attempting-to-perform-what-he-claims-is-lennays-voice-on-dr-phil">over at Deadspin.</a> </p>

<p>Up till now, it seemed impossible that a man could have been behind the voice of Kekua&#x2014;as Te&apos;o told Couric after listening to some of her voicemails, &#x201C;Well, it didn&#x2019;t sound like a man. It sounded like a woman,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;If he somehow made that voice, that&#x2019;s incredible, that&#x2019;s an incredible talent to do that. Especially every single day.&quot; Well, voice analysts completely agree with him: one called him &quot;a true talent&quot; who had abilities the analyst had never seen before. And all three experts told Dr. Phil that his voice matched those from the voicemails.  </p>

<p>So much for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427162058/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/25/manti_teo_hoaxers_female_cousin_may.php">the NY Post&apos;s scoop</a> that one of Tuiasosopo&apos;s female cousins was in on the hoax as well. In the second part of the interview, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427162058/http://www.usatoday.com/story/gameon/2013/02/01/manti-teo-hoax-ronaiah-tuiasosopo-molested-dr-phil/1883207/">Tuiasosopo also revealed that</a> the hoax had &quot;everything to do&quot; with escaping real life, because he had been repeatedly molested by a family friend starting when he was 12.</p>
