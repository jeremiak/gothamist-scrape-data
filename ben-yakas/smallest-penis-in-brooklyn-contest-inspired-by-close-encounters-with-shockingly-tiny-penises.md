<p>This week, micro penis owners all over Brooklyn were given a jolt when Kings County Bar <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504004834/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/17/brooklyn_bar_on_the_hunt_for_the_sm.php">announced their first annual Smallest Penis in Brooklyn pageant</a>&#x2014;the ultimate wet t-shirt contest for infinitesimal penises. We asked bar manager Aimee Arciuolo about what inspired them to start such a tradition, and it turned out to be based in some very personal experiences: &quot;The discussion came about after I had an exceptionally fun and amazing romp with a man who was less than endowed&#x2014;it was actually shockingly tiny, like the size of an acorn,&quot; she told us.</p>

<p>&quot;He came right out and said, &apos;Yes, I know, I&apos;ve got a little pecker. But don&apos;t you worry, we are going to have fun.&apos; And it was great! That guy seriously smashed it UP in the bedroom,&quot; she said. Arciuolo discovered afterwards that many of her girlfriends had had similar experiences; they agreed that &quot;guys like that deserve a prize, and we should hold a goddamn pageant for them! <strong>It should be celebrated, rather than a source of shame!</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The Contest&quot; will be held on Saturday, July 20th starting at 5 p.m. at the bar, located at 286 Siegel Street near the Morgan Avenue L train. You don&apos;t have to worry about going completely nude if you participate, even if you are totally proud of your lilliputian penis: &quot;While nudity is not required, contestants should expect to wear wet underwear (which will be provided).&quot; Aimee gave us more details about the size requirements:</p>

<blockquote>There will be no maximum size requirement to enter, but obvious show-offs will be heckled. I do expect there will be a few giant dicks that come to show off, but if they are over eight inches they will be disqualified and forced to buy a round for the judges. We will provide the gentlemen with a pair of white tighty whitey&apos;s with the SPB logo, and the wetting process will involve water pistols.</blockquote>

<p>There will be two rounds in the contest (&quot;swimwear and eveningwear&quot;), as well as a question-and-answer section in which contestants can share &quot;stories from below the belt.  <strong>We feel that discussing the issue of teeny peenies will turn embarrassing stories into empowerment</strong>.&quot;</p>

<p>As for the reactions so far, they have been pretty mixed: &quot;Our straight male friends and regulars have told me this is the worst idea ever, eyes rolling, huffy puffy and insulted,&quot; Arciuolo told us. &quot;Our female friends and regulars are so excited and have all volunteered their time and energy in construction of the sets, sashes, crowns and scepters.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We hope all kinds of men will apply&#x2014;we have a few brave contestants already&#x2014;this is obviously a pageant for confident people with a sense of humor!&quot; If you don&apos;t bat an eyelash in the face of shrinkage, you can email spb.brooklyn@gmail.com to enter.</p>
