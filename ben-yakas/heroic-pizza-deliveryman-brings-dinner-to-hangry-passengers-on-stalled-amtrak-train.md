<p>When a train breaks down, some choose to revisit <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170615215029/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/21/subway_singalong_u_guys.php">DMX&apos;s catalogue</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170615215029/http://gothamist.com/tags/subwaydelays">impotently rage at the transit gods.</a> But for Mitch Katz, a partner at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170615215029/http://www.capitalassoc.net/team-member/mitchell-katz">CA Wealth Management,</a> it was an opportunity to prove that the old <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170615215029/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQBan9MOy60">Bagel Bites jingle</a> is still the most accurate song ever written: you really can have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170615215029/http://gothamist.com/tags/pizza">pizza</a> anytime.</p>

<p>Katz was traveling on a New York-to-D.C. Amtrak train (Amtrak 161) on Sunday evening when the train experienced mechanical issues and got stuck in Delaware. The train was stuck for over three hours altogether without any air conditioning or cafe onboard, with many passengers getting a bad case of the hangries.</p>

<p>So instead, Katz ordered pizza from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170615215029/http://www.ilovedomspizza.com/">Dom&apos;s NY Style Pizza</a> for passengers&#x2014;and the delivery person walked the tracks to get it up to the train.</p>

<p>The most important thing here is that Katz followed the one rule of ordering food to a train: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170615215029/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/14/photo_dont_eat_pizza_on_the_subway.php">you have to share it with everyone.</a></p>
