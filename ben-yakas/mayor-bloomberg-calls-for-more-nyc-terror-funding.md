										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right" style=" width:250px; "> <img alt="2310bloom.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522122239im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/2310bloom.jpg" width="250" height="317"> <br> <i>AP/Chad Rachman</i></div> Mayor Bloomberg called for more anti-terrorism funding for NYC at a Homeland Security Advisory Council meeting in Midtown this afternoon. Hosted by Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano at the Grand Hyatt Hotel, Mayor Bloomberg, in what passes as a passionate display for him, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522122239/http://nyc.gov/portal/site/nycgov/menuitem.c0935b9a57bb4ef3daf2f1c701c789a0/index.jsp?pageID=mayor_press_release&amp;catID=1194&amp;doc_name=http%3A%2F%2Fnyc.gov%2Fhtml%2Fom%2Fhtml%2F2010a%2Fpr059-10.html&amp;cc=unused1978&amp;rc=1194&amp;ndi=1">stressed that NYC is still a target</a> for terrorists, and challenged Homeland Security to add funding for programs such as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522122239/http://gothamist.com/2010/01/22/sen_schumer_brings_ring_of_sensors.php">&quot;Securing the Cities:&quot;</a><p></p>

<blockquote>Despite the great job that all of our first responders do, we certainly think of ourselves as being in the crosshairs. That is just a fact. And I challenge the Department to continue to work to devise Homeland Security funding formulas that take this fact into higher consideration. 

<p>Commissioner Kelly and I have both been to Washington many times to urge the Federal government to distribute funding solely on threat levels. National security is a national responsibility, and we can&apos;t afford to let local politics get in the way, and trying to spread the money around as pork just is irresponsible at the very least.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>The big question that was not addressed by any parties at the conference was the matter of the 9/11 terror trials, which were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522122239/http://gothamist.com/2009/11/18/polls_americans_but_not_nyers_oppos.php">originally</a> supposed to take place in lower Manhattan. It&apos;s believed that the Justice Dept <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522122239/http://gothamist.com/2010/01/31/obama_keeps_hope_alive_for_ny_terro.php">is reconsidering that plan</a>, in part because of Mayor Bloomberg&apos;s report that it would cost nearly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522122239/http://gothamist.com/2010/01/06/security_for_terror_trials_will_cos.php">$200 million</a> to properly secure the trials. The meeting today comes at an eerily appropriate time, with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522122239/http://gothamist.com/2010/02/03/intel_officials_certain_al_qaeda_wi.php">reports earlier</a> about &quot;certain&quot; Al Qaeda attacks on the U.S. in the next six months.</p>
