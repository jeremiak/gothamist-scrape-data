<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2013_12_papini.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422144320im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2013_12_papini.jpg" width="200" height="288" class="image-right"> </span> An animal shelter worker <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422144320/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Animal-Shelter-Worker-Arrest-Dog-Plastic-Bag-Dumpster-237687051.html">has been arrested</a> for throwing away a one-year-old dog in a plastic bag in a gas station dumpster in Long Island. The Suffolk County Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals says that Michael Papini, 30, was arrested Friday and charged with animal abandonment and animal cruelty for dumping the adorable dachshund mix, who has been named Noelle by rescuers.</p>

<p>&quot;I just happened to look to the side and there was a face looking at me,&quot; Kevin Zabawski, who found the pup, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422144320/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Dog-Rescued-Long-Island-Dumpster-237185541.html">told NBC</a>. &quot;There was this dog in there, and I thought &apos;Who the heck would leave an animal like that in the dumpster?&apos; It&apos;s way too much for me.&quot; Officials think Noelle, who had a pink leash and a pink collar, chewed her way out of the bag. She had severely matted and dirty fur when she was found, but was otherwise in okay health. </p>

<p>As you can see in the Vine below, she&apos;s still plenty curious, and retained all her wonderful doggy derpyness.</p>
