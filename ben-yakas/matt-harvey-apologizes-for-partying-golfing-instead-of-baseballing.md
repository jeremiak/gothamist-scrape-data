<p>Mets pitcher <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170509233141/http://gothamist.com/tags/mattharvey">Matt Harvey</a> pushed aside all talk of who did or didn&apos;t plant a dildo in a locker to formally apologize <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170509233141/http://gothamist.com/2017/05/09/matt_harvey_and_his_hard-partying_l.php">for his behavior</a> over the last week. </p>

<p>&quot;First off, as I just did with my teammates and all the coaches, I apologized for my actions and I do apologize for my actions,&quot; he said. &quot;Obviously, I am extremely embarrassed for my actions and I apologized to my teammates, to the Mets organization, to the Wilpons and all the way down to the Mets fans for doing what I did.&quot; You can see the full apology below. </p>

<p>He confirmed reports that he was out partying at 1OAK til 4 a.m. in the morning on Cinco de Mayo, then headed to the golf course Saturday morning before not showing up to Citi Field later that day for a Mets game. He blamed it on a &quot;migraine&quot; at the time. &quot;Yes, I was out on Friday night past curfew,&quot; he said. &quot;I did play golf Saturday morning and I put myself in a bad place to be ready for showing up to a ballgame and that is my responsibility. I take full blame for that.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am doing everything in my power to make sure that doesn&apos;t happen again,&quot; he added. &quot;Like I said, I&apos;m extremely embarrassed for my actions, and I&apos;m looking forward to getting things back on track and am doing everything I can to help this team win and help this organization moving forward, and they all have my word on that one.&quot;</p>

Whether or not it happens down the road isn&apos;t on my mind.&quot;</p>

<p>Harvey was seen earlier in the day penitently carrying a &quot;sad snack&quot; contained in a Ziploc container&#x2014;both the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170509233141/http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/baseball/mets/matt-harvey-spotted-1st-time-3-game-ban-article-1.3150402">Daily News</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170509233141/http://nypost.com/2017/05/09/matt-harvey-surfaces-for-first-time-since-three-game-ban/">NY Post</a> were on it, in case you missed that riveting turn in the Harvey saga. <br>
