<p>In further proof that everything is, indeed, coming up Milhouse, somebody has finally made some groin-grabbingly great <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509151958/http://gothamist.com/tags/thesimpsons"><em>The Simpsons</em></a> t-shirts, just in time for the holidays (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509151958/http://gothamist.com/tags/gothamistgiftguide">wink wink, nudge nudge</a>). Threadless received 843 submissions for designs from different artists, and ended up picking 29 for their brand spanking new t-shirt collection. Check out <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509151958/http://www.threadless.com/simpsons-t-shirts">the full collection here.</a></p>

<p>Suffice it to say, this is much, much better than the last time someone <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509151958/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/16/simpsons_fashion_week.php">tried to put a sartorial spin on the show</a>. Among our favorites: Mr. Sparkle, Mr. Plow, The Springfield Monorail, and of course, Ralph Wiggum&apos;s yearbook photo. Something tells us these shirts are going to sell out quickly, so don&apos;t be a glavin (and feel free to buy us one too). </p>
