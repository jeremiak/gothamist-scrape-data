<p>NJ resident Michael Howard <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140221141541/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20140117/chelsea/shocker-man-arrested-for-stealing-defibrillator-from-23rd-st-path-station">was arrested this week</a> for allegedly attempting to steal a defibrillator from a PATH station in Manhattan. And this was the <em>second</em> time in as many months that he was arrested for attempting to do so. Is Michael Howard the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140221141541/http://gothamist.com/tags/dariusmccollum">Darius McCollum</a> of defibrillators? </p>

<p>Howard, 20, was spotted with the defibrillator aboard a train at the 33rd Street station at around 1 p.m. on Thursday. Police say Howard resisted arrest, but was subdued after a struggle with officers. Howard was charged with grand larceny and possession of stolen property.</p>

<p>Back in December, Howard <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140221141541/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Man-Steals-Defibrillators-PATH-Station-Manhattan-New-Jersey-240892151.html">was also arrested</a> for stealing a defibrillator from the Newark PATH station. Police could not say what he was planning to do with the defibrillators, but clearly there are only a few options: maybe he&apos;s stuck in an <em>Indiana Jones And The Last Crusade</em> scenario, and Nazis are forcing him to steal as many defibrillators as possible for some nefarious purpose. Or he has a electro-shock fetish. Or someone he knows has a serious medical problem, in which case he really should be more forthcoming with the police about why he <em>needs</em> a defibrillator. Or this has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140221141541/http://breakingbad.wikia.com/wiki/Peter_Schuler">something to do with Franch dressing</a>.</p>
