<p>The late night comedians all had a field day celebrating &quot;Comey Day&quot; last night after the former FBI director testified about his meetings with Donald Trump. No one had more fun than <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170609215922/http://gothamist.com/tags/stephencolbert">Stephen Colbert</a>, whether he was coming up with names for a Trump family law firm (&quot;Lies, Plain &amp; Simple&quot;) or coming up with Comey&apos;s future children&apos;s book (<em>James and the Guilty Orange</em>). </p>

<p>&quot;Comey flat out said the president lied,&quot; Colbert said before showing the clip explaining why he took such detailed notes with his meetings with Trump. &quot;So the only things that raised red flags about his meetings with Trump were: Where, why, what and who.&quot; Comey said he was concerned that Trump might lie: &quot;He thought Trump might lie? That&#x2019;s that razor-sharp F.B.I. instinct in action right there. &apos;Look, fellas, I don&#x2019;t want to get out over my skis here, but I think this dead body might not be alive.&apos;&quot;</p>

<p>Colbert opened the show by inserting himself into the hearing.</p>

<p>But he didn&apos;t let Comey and Trump&apos;s various scandals dominate the whole evening&#x2014;he took a break to talk about Eric Trump&apos;s scandals. Eric, aka &quot;Odo from <em>Deep Space Nine</em>,&quot; was accused this week of possibly funneling money from The Eric Trump Foundation&apos;s children&apos;s cancer benefit back into the family business. During the report, Colbert compared him to &quot;Voldemort with hair,&quot; &quot;the skeleton child from <em>The Nightmare Before Christmas</em>,&quot; and &quot;Beavis plus Butthead.&quot;</p>

<p>Seth Meyers also took a closer look at the Comey hearings: &quot;That&#x2019;s the FBI director, a guy who has dealt with liars and criminals his whole life, walking out of his first meeting with the president and thinking, &apos;I&#x2019;ve got to write this sh*t down.&apos;&quot;</p>

<p>Meyers also noted that at this point, &quot;Our capacity to be shocked has already been so worn down by the Trump presidency, he&#x2019;s like your druggie cousin who can no longer surprise you. &apos;Kevin traded Aunt Janet&#x2019;s cat for Robitussin.&apos; Uh-huh. Did he.&quot;</p>

<p>And Trevor Noah found an unlikely sympathetic figure in all this: &quot;This is the first time I&#x2019;ve ever felt bad for Ted Cruz, because you know he was watching this thinking, &apos;Wait, you guys just now figured out Trump was a liar? He said my dad killed JFK!&apos;&quot; Noah said. &quot;At least, that&#x2019;s what I imagine happened, because no one was actually willing to watch the Comey hearing with Ted Cruz.&quot;</p>
