<p>On Wednesday, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150415101439/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/04/video_man_screaming_i_hate_white_pe.php">a man was arrested in Union Square</a> after allegedly attacking three people in broad daylight without provocation. According to police, suspect LaShawn Marten, 31, has been charged with assault in the incident, which occurred around 2:45 p.m. that afternoon. Cops confirmed that Marten punched the victim in the face, causing his head to hit the ground; the victim then lapsed into a coma at Bellevue Hospital. Police are now investigating the incident as a possible hate crime.</p>

<p>According to sources, Marten had been playing chess in the Square before the incident; he jumped up allegedly shouting &quot;I hate white people,&quot; then struck the first victim (it&apos;s unclear whether he was playing the victim in chess or not). According to witness <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150415101439/https://twitter.com/JoeyBoots">Joey Boots</a>, who came upon the scene after the initial incident, Marten then fought with two other men who came to the victim&apos;s aide. </p>

<p>Boots&#x2014;along with other Union Square witnesses and at least one of the other victims&#x2014;was interviewed by police about the incident yesterday. Boots told us cops have surveillance video (from across the street) that shows the incident: &quot;You can see the guy getting up, taking his shirt off then putting it back on, looking agitated.&quot; He added that police believe the first victim may die due to swelling on the brain. </p>
