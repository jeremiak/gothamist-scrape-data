                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2010_12_bxhs.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20140307041426im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2010_12_bxhs.jpg" width="170" height="163" class="image-left"> </span>A fight between students at a Bronx high school led to a horrible incident for one young teacher yesterday. A pregnant teacher at the Explorations Academy in Claremont tried to break up a fight between two students, was kicked in the stomach by one of the students (it&apos;s unclear if it was an accident or not) and later miscarried.</p>

<p>One student <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140307041426/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/bronx/miscarriage_horror_at_bx_school_6ExDWRb7UeeXnPswVkMooJ?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">told the Post</a> that the other kids came to the teacher&apos;s defense: &quot;Everyone else was just trying to break it up. They saw she fell against the floor. They pushed him [the assailant] up against a wall.&quot; The teacher, who was four months pregnant, fell to the floor and was taken to North General Hospital, where she had a miscarriage.</p>

<p>The Post mentions that another teacher was attacked by a student&#x2014;at JHS 145 in East Harlem, &quot;A14-year-old girl struck a 49-year-old teacher in the face. The teacher was taken to Weill Cornell Medical Center.&quot;</p>
