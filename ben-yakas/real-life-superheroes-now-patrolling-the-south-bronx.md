Though we have yet to see them in person ourselves, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110521081839/http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/13359936">BBC followed them</a> around recently on one of their missions, and it sounded mighty...real: <strong>&quot;Tonight, NYI members are patrolling the notorious South Bronx projects, looking for troublemakers and their victims.&quot;  </strong><p></p>

<p>The group, which includes costumed members Zero, Short Cut, Samaritan Prime, Battlestar, Nitro and Deaths Head, arm themselves with weapons (including a long metal torch that can be used as a club), and they have &quot;martial arts trainers and practitioners on the team.&quot; They gave the BBC an idea of the kinds of cases they&apos;ve handled: We find drunks fighting out, domestic abuse, a robbery, anything like that...I stopped a rape once. A couple of guys were taking a drunk girl home with them. They were talking about all the stuff they were going to do to her. I came up and I told them to get away from her,&quot; said Deaths Head Moth.</p>

<p>The BBC seem kind of clueless about their origins&#x2014;they say at one point, &quot;Crime fighting Hollywood film <em>Kick-Ass</em> is based on them,&quot; which is not true, seeing as how the movie is based on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110521081839/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kick-Ass_(comics)">comic series</a>...but perhaps they meant that the real-life superheroes were inspired by the film. The Brooklyn-based group released a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110521081839/http://issuepedia.org/2011-04-16_To_all_Ladies:_Free_Protection_and_Safety_System">statement on intent</a> on Craigslist late last year, in which they vowed to protect sex workers from the Long Island Serial Killer, but on their regularly-updated <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110521081839/http://www.facebook.com/NewYorkInitiative">Facebook page</a>, they say that they&apos;ve also been patrolling the West Village for muggers.</p>

<p>The group has called their exploits like &quot;a community block watch or safety patrol,&quot; but police haven&apos;t been as supportive of their antics: &#x201C;Block watch? Naw, fuhgetabout that. You&#x2019;ll get shot. The guys in this neighborhood, they&#x2019;ll shoot you and no one will tell us who did it. There&#x2019;s a strong &#x2018;no snitching&#x2019; rule out here,&#x201D; one officer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110521081839/http://www.nypress.com/article-21418-brooklyns-own-superheroes.html">told NY Press.</a> At least none of them are dressed up <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110521081839/http://www.avclub.com/articles/maybe-just-dont-dress-as-batman-at-all-or-you-coul,55978/">like Batman</a>:</p>
