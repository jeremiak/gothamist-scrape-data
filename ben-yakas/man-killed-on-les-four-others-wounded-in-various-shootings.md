<p>Yesterday, Police Commissioner Ray Kelly and Mayor Bloomberg were touting the fact that the city <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131113073518/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/09/new_yorkers_go_24_hours_without_sho.php">went through a 24 hour period this week</a> when no one was shot, stabbed or slashed. However, things have certainly been more violently over the last 24 hours: in addition to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131113073518/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/10/gunfire_at_bryant_park_two_injured.php">violent Bryant Park shooting last night</a>, a man was fatally shot on the Lower East Side and four others were wounded in various shootings around Manhattan and Brooklyn.</p>

<p>According to cops, an unidentified 30-year-old man was shot three times in the courtyard of the Smith Houses on St. James Place on the LES around 4 a.m. this morning. He was taken to New York-Presbyterian-Lower Manhattan Hospital where he died a short time later. No arrests have been made, and the investigation is ongoing.</p>

<p>Around 1 a.m., two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were all shot during a fight in the Carver Houses on E. 99th Street in Manhattan; all three are expected to survive, and no arrests have been made yet. In a separate incident, a 20-year-old woman was shot in both legs at the corner of E. 95th Street and Church Avenue in Brownsville around 5:20 a.m.; she is also expected to survive, and no arrests have been made.</p>
