The 7-month-old black and brown female Calico cat, named &quot;Blackfoot,&quot; turned out to have been shot with a high-powered BB gun or a low caliber rifle; it had a neck wound and a spinal fracture that veterinarians believe was caused by blunt force trauma. <p></p>

<p>After being cared for at Westchester Animal Hospital, Blackfoot <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160823034524/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2013/02/14/putnam-county-spca-hunts-whoever-shot-cat-to-death/">died Feb. 11</a> due to progressive paralysis. &#x201C;Although many feel that feral cats may be a nuisance, it is a crime to harm these animals,&#x201D; said Chief Ken Ross of the Putnam County SPCA. &#x201C;Owned cats, under the law are allowed to roam outside, and when someone takes matters into their own hands, not only are they committing animal cruelty, they may end injuring their neighbor&#x2019;s child or pet.&#x201D;</p>

Authorities are also investigating if these incidents are connected to two other cat beheadings in July several miles away in the Connecticut towns of Oxford and Fairfield.</p>
