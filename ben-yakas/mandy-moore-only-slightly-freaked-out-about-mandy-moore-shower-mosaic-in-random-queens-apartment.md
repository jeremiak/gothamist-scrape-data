title: Mandy Moore Only Slightly Freaked Out About 'Mandy Moore Shower Mosaic' In Random Queens Apartment
---

	
										<p><em>This Is Us</em> isn&apos;t the only place to get your Mandy Moore fix&#x2014;apparently, she is also starring in an off-off-off-off Broadway production inside the shower of some dude&apos;s random Queens apartment. And who among us can say we wouldn&apos;t want to wake up every morning, shuffle sleepily into the shower, and be greeted by the sepia-toned visage of Moore? This is truly a mosaic to remember.</p>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">my friend&apos;s friend bought an apt in Queens and there was a Mandy Moore mosaic in the shower <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170106175852/https://t.co/JtBZ2NBEX1">pic.twitter.com/JtBZ2NBEX1</a></p>&#x2014; Peter W.

<p>As you can see above, Twitter user Peter W. Kaplan tweeted a photo of the striking mosaic, which was taken from the Queens apartment of one of his friends, along with a conversation about its origins. He <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170106175852/http://nymag.com/selectall/2017/01/mandy-moore-mosaic-found-in-shower-of-new-york-apartment.html">told Select All</a> the photo is legit as far as he knows. Moore took the artistic homage in stride:</p>

<p>There is, of course, always the chance this could be another <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170106175852/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/17/brooklyn_man_giving_away_his_giant.php">human hamster wheel</a>, or maybe <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170106175852/http://gothamist.com/tags/zardulu">Zardulu</a> has moved on from animal shenanigans to interior decorating. But there is also a lot of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170106175852/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/28/subway_station_house.php#photo-1">strange art</a> to be found in random apartment buildings. Does anyone know if Ryan Adams has ever lived in Queens? </p>
