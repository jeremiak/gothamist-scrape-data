<p>Yesterday, police released surveillance stills of a man <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151023200332/http://gothamist.com/2014/05/10/68-yr-old_in_critical_condition_aft.php">who viciously beat a 68-year-old in the East Village</a> on Friday evening. The victim was walking down East 6th Street near Avenue D around 8:45 p.m. when the suspect started yelling at him, grabbed and pushed him onto the ground, then kicked him in the head. A concerned neighbor has sent us the surveillance video of the assault in hopes of identifying the suspect: &quot;With access to the security cameras of the building, I managed to retrieve footage of the attack that happened and want to help find and bring this man to justice.&quot;</p>

<p>The neighbor, who asked to remain anonymous, told us the assault happened outside his window: &quot;At first I heard yelling and didn&apos;t think much of it, until a couple of minutes later when I also heard police radios chirping. I looked outside and saw a bloodied man being taken off by a stretcher and into an ambulance.&quot;</p>

<p>The victim was taken to Bellevue Hospital, where he was listed in critical condition as of Saturday. Police don&apos;t know what sparked the incident, nor whether the two men knew each other beforehand. Cops are also offering a $2,000 reward for any information about the assault.</p>
