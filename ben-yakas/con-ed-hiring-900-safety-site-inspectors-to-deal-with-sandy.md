<p>Since <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161018/http://gothamist.com/tags/hurricanesandy">Hurricane Sandy</a> shut off the power for over a million New Yorkers at the start of the week&#x2014;including all of lower Manhattan&#x2014;Con Ed has been working overtime to restore electricity as quickly as possible and get the city back up and running. Currently, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161018/http://www.coned.com/newsroom/news/pr20121102.asp">over 570K customers</a> are still without power, though <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161018/http://gothamist.com/2012/11/02/con_ed_expects_to_restore_power_to.php">Con Ed is hoping</a> to get most of Manhattan restored by tomorrow. But to help with that effort, they&apos;re going to need a few more good men...900ish, to be exact.</p>

<p>Con Ed confirmed to us that it had hired two temp agencies to recruit for Safety Site Inspectors positions in every borough. And since they need people ASAP, they&apos;re waiving background checks in order to get people on the ground working. Check out the full listing below:</p>

<blockquote>ConEdison has IMMEDIATE openings (900) for Safety Site Inspectors stationed in every borough. Duties to include placing yellow safety tape around areas with downed trees ensuring that the public stay away from trees or downed lines. Candidates must have their own vehicle, clean driver&#x2019;s license and work boots. Shifts from 7AM - 7PM, and 7PM - 7AM paying $25 per hour. (Company will waive background checks).

<p>Also, Bi-Lingual Customer Service Reps (any language plus English) stationed in Brooklyn to answer and field incoming calls. $17 per hour.</p>

<p>These positions are open to the public at large.</p>
