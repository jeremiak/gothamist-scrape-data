<p>Former pro football player Brian Holloway&apos;s Labor Day weekend was ruined after he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426151815/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/19/ex-football_player_shames_teens_who.php">discovered that hundreds of teens had broken into his upstate NY home</a> for a massive party which caused thousands of dollars of damage. Holloway, a former Patriots and Raiders offensive lineman, ended up re-posting photographs of many of the teens on a site called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426151815/http://helpmesave300.com/">HelpMeSave300.com</a> in an attempt to &quot;teach our kids to be accountable.&quot; He expected to get apologies from parents and the teens&#x2014;but he told us that to his shock, he&apos;s now been threatened with lawsuits from many of the parents: <strong>&quot;I don&apos;t really understand how they can be upset with me for things their children did.&quot;</strong></p>

<p>&quot;I don&apos;t really understand it,&quot; he told us over the phone today. &quot;They say &apos;you ruined our kids&apos; life.&apos; If my child was breaking into your home and you posted them on the website, posted the material that THEY posted, I would come there and thank you, and I would have my child be an indentured servant until everything was repaired and cleaned up.&quot;</p>

<p>Holloway was in Tampa three weeks ago about to launch his new website <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426151815/http://herleague.net/">Herleague.net</a>, a social media platform for women who love football, when his son spotted Twitter updates about the party and alerted him. &quot;I went right from shock, blew right past furious, and was like, &apos;Wait a minute, they are so way out there,&apos;&quot; Holloway said. As he watched more and more photos from the party show up on Twitter and Facebook, he was appalled: &quot;This isn&apos;t just alcohol. This is alcohol and meth and crack and heroin. It didn&apos;t even make sense.&quot;</p>

<p>He estimates there is $20-40K in damage, including smashed windows and glass doors, an &quot;enormous amount&quot; of graffiti, urine-soaked carpets, holes in the ceilings, and a stolen eagle statue (which has since been returned). On his website (which he referred to as a &quot;warning disclosure&quot;), he asked the teens to come to a picnic for veterans at the home and help clean it up. &quot;These 300 lives are in real jeopardy,&quot; he said. &quot;Why don&apos;t you help clean it up, let&apos;s turn it into something good. Because I don&apos;t want this place to be remembered by the scar of this ridiculous situation.&quot;</p>

<p>He said that so far, only one teen and parent have come forward to help him clean up the damages. He&apos;s already turned over hundreds of the pictures to the local sheriff: &quot;We have names of probably 220 kids so far, we&apos;ll have 300 by this weekend.&quot; He added that he&apos;s not scared of the threats he&apos;s received so far: &quot;They have so much documented evidence, the only term I can use to describe what is going to happen to these teens is &apos;shock-and-awe.&apos;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And how do you intimidate me?&quot; he asked. &quot;I&apos;ve lined up against Lawrence Taylor!&quot; </p>
