<p>There are a lot of dads out there doing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140705202712/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/23/manhattan_dad_charged_for_groping_s.php">their part</a> to make the world a little more embarrassing for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140705202712/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/16/ten_videos_to_get_you_in_the_mood_f.php">us all</a>. Long Island father Richard Ortiz apparently wanted in, because he allegedly drove his daughter and three of her friends to a park in order to fight another girl, then assaulted a teen with a crowbar who tried to stop the fight.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140705202712/http://www.newsday.com/long-island/nassau/richard-ortiz-of-east-meadow-assaults-teen-after-taking-daughter-to-fight-police-say-1.8561047?p=502540">According to Newsday</a>, Ortiz, 45, allegedly drove his 17-year-old daughter and her three friends to Abe Levitt Park in Hicksville around 1:20 a.m. on June 18th (a Wednesday night, no less). The daughter then confronted a group of four other teens in an alleged attempt to start a fight, when the 17-year-old victim stepped in and tried to stop it from happening. Ortiz is accused of then hitting the teen in the head with a crowbar, causing &quot;a large laceration.&quot;</p>

<p>Ortiz, who fled the scene with the four teen girls, has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140705202712/http://7online.com/news/cops-li-dad-brings-daughter-to-fight-hits-boy-with-crowbar/138880/">now been charged</a> with second-degree assault. He has been informally charged with first-degree &quot;gawd daaaaaaaad.&quot;</p>
