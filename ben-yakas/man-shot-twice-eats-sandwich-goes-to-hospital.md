<p>Most of us haven&apos;t been shot, so we really can&apos;t know exactly how we&apos;d react if we were. Would we keep calm and rational? Would we scream hysterically? New Haven resident Miguel Soto III faced just that situation after he was shot twice, near the groin and in the left leg. And he chose to eat a sandwich. Soto, 25, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160312141118/http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5iKPEG_V9I9253mTkRQuT6XY7geGA?docId=9acfe9efb3d647018205df1479bd895c">was shot</a> leaving a New Haven deli on Tuesday. He went home, ate his sandwich, then asked his father to take him to the hospital. Many, many questions come to mind, but only one will keep us from sleeping tonight: what kind of glorious sandwich was it??</p>
