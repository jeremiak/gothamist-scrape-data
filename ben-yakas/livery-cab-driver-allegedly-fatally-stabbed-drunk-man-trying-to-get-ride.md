<p>A livery cab driver allegedly fatally stabbed a drunk man and wounded another drunk man who tried to hail him for a ride early this morning in Queens. According to cops, the two men stopped the livery cab driver around 4:50 a.m. on Roosevelt Avenue in Woodside early Saturday. A 26-year-old man was found with a fatal stab wound to the chest, while the 33-year-old other man had a stab wound to the torso. The second man is in stable condition at Elmhurt Hospital.</p>

There was a verbal exchange, then the driver got out of the car, pulled out a long knife, and stabbed the 33-year-old first; the 26-year-old was fatally stabbed while trying to intervene. </p>
