<p>The Bronx teen who is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502180518/http://gothamist.com/2014/05/31/teen_allegedly_committed_suicide_af.php">presumed to have committed suicide this week</a> after she was caught cheating on a high school exam had dealt with depression for years. </p>

<p>Police are still looking for the body of Omotayo Adeoye, 17, who jumped into Hudson River Greenway near W. 163rd Street on Thursday. Friends and neighbors <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502180518/http://nypost.com/2014/06/01/suicide-student-grew-sullen-and-ran-away-from-home/">tell the Post</a> that Adeoye had lived with depression for at least two years, running away from home repeatedly. &quot;Her family was very worried. They found her walking near the river in Manhattan [last year],&quot; said Pedro Jimenez, the superintendent at Adeoye&#x2019;s Mott Haven apartment building.</p>

<p>&quot;She walked with her head down. She wouldn&#x2019;t look at you, never made eye contact. She seemed stressed all the time,&quot; said neighbor Manzel Jones. &quot;When she ran away [earlier this year], she was gone for three days. Her mother was lying on the floor in the hallway, crying and knocking on doors, asking, &apos;Have you seen my daughter? She didn&#x2019;t come home from school.&apos;&quot; He added, &quot;When she came back, she still looked depressed.&quot;</p>

<p>Adeoye allegedly was caught looking at her cellphone on during an exam by her teacher, Eva Malikova, at the Harlem High School for Math, Science and Engineering on Thursday. Police told the Post that she wrote a suicide note on her German-language exam reading, <br>
&quot;I just want to go away forever on the bottom of the river.&quot; Adeoye was an honors student, and neighbors say she was vocally proud of her scholastic achievements; recently, she had been waiting to hear if she&#x2019;d qualify for a &#xAD;National Achievement Scholarship for college.</p>

<p>Her classmates described her as &quot;really nice and really funny,&quot; and added she was a &quot;lighthearted&quot; presence on the basketball team. &quot;She didn&#x2019;t talk to many people, but if you talked to her, she&#x2019;d talk to you,&quot; said classmate Natalie Sharp. &quot;We had gym class together last year, and she was really fast. I&#x2019;d ask her how she was so fast, and she&#x2019;d crack jokes and say, &apos;I&#x2019;m from Nigeria &#x2014; it&#x2019;s part of my culture.&apos;&quot;</p>

<p><em>If someone you know exhibits warning signs of suicide: do not leave the person alone; remove any firearms, alcohol, drugs or sharp objects that could be used in a suicide attempt; and call the U.S. National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 800-273-TALK (8255) or take the person to an emergency room or seek help from a medical or mental health professional.</em></p>
