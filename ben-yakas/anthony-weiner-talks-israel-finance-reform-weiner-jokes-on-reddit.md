Anthony Weiner</i></div> In honor of the one-year anniversary of Obamacare passing yesterday, Rep. Anthony Weiner <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509002029/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/23/anthony_weiner_taking_questions_on.php">decreed it</a>, &quot;Ask Me Shit On Social Media Day.&quot; And more than anywhere else, he was inundated with questions <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509002029/http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/g9pcr/iama_democrat_who_fights_rep_anthony_weiner_dny/">on Reddit</a>, in a thread which got more than 4000 comments by the end of the day. Some tough issues were addressed, some &quot;weiner&quot; jokes were made, and there were no awkward moments regarding his alleged <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509002029/http://www.nydailynews.com/blogs/dailypolitics/2011/03/anthony-weiner-plays-up-clinton-connections-well-in-advance-of-2013-mayors-rac">mayoral aspirations</a>. Here&apos;s a sampling of some of his responses to those hard-hitting questions on Israel, healthcare, his fear of The Count from Sesame Street, and bike lane jokes gone wrong:<p></p>

<p>On his &quot;unconditional support&quot; of Israel: <br>
</p><blockquote>i dont think i let anyone slide - including my own beloved nation. but i proceed with a set of values that leads me to support Israel strongly: i support democracies. i support nations that have thriving debate and press freedoms. i support nations that respect women. and i support nations that support the rule of law.<p></p>

<p><strong>Israel is not perfect. but they are surrounded by violent enemies.</strong></p>

<p>the plight of the Palestinians is untenable. i pray for two states living side by side in peace. but that can happen only through negotiation.</p></blockquote><br>
He also discussed the differences between Democrats and Republicans:<p></p>

<blockquote>my colleagues are mostly good and honorable people but the gop has a fundamentally different view of the world than I. i see the disparity of income and the pressures on the vanishing middle class and i line up to help those struggling. im a democrat.

<p><strong>they line up to defend the status quo and the winners in the deals. they are Republicans.</strong></p></blockquote><br>
Weiner said he was against a long term extension of the Patriot Act, and &quot;certainly against a permanent extension.&quot; He said that he thought President Obama is <strong>&quot;doing a great job leading the nation and an average job leading our fight.</strong> i think when the president looks out his window he sees a cacophony of disparate voices shouting at each other and feels the need to quietly pursue the best deal for the american people.&quot; He went on to criticize the President for compromising too much, and for not coming to congress before taking action against Libya; he also said he regretted his own great compromise, voting for the Iraq War. <p></p>

<p>On the subject of &quot;weiner&quot; jokes, he said:</p>

<blockquote>i heard my last original weiner gag in the 5th grade.
<strong>&quot;vote for weiner, he&apos;ll be frank&quot;</strong>
(thank you. please tip your waitresses)</blockquote>

<p>About his controversial <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509002029/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/05/mayor_weiners_first_act_would_aboli.php">bike lane quote</a>, he said it was a joke-gone-wrong: <strong>&quot;first it was a joke. but it make the story because we now have open and unnecessary warfare over bike lanes. its a false choice : bike lanes and true civic planning.&quot;</strong> Someone brought up Weiner&apos;s sardonic <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509002029/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/17/video_weiner_sardonically_targets_n.php">Click and Clack speech</a>, and jokingly asked if he would fight to take away funding from <em>Sesame Stree</em>t, &quot;a show about street hoodlums and cookie junkies.&quot; He responded: &quot;I am so with you brother. do we really think that thing that lives in a trash can isnt a freak out to our children? and the vampire that counts stuff?! im scared just talking about it.&quot;</p>

<p>To the question of campaign finance reform, he said:</p>

<blockquote><strong>it is the foundation of so much of what ails the nation today.</strong> the supreme court has become an outgrowth of the pro business wing of the gop. we need a couple of things fast : transparency and improved rights of investors to stop public companies from crash landing on political campaigns.

<p>im a middle class guy. if we dont have public financing soon, congress will have no more weiners. uh, let me rephrase that...</p></blockquote><br>
Weiner added that he&apos;d keep reading through the thread, and return on Friday to &quot;answer the top 5 upvoted questions via video.&quot; So if you have any burning questions for a future mayoral candidate who seems to understand how best to use social media, post your question <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509002029/http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/g9pcr/iama_democrat_who_fights_rep_anthony_weiner_dny/">here</a>. <p></p>
