<p>A man who was able to cut off his ankle monitoring bracelet, which he had due to federal child pornography charges, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426151850/http://www.9wsyr.com/news/local/story/Cicero-man-charged-with-rape-murder-after/guyafstQqkmh7rGjUPveQA.cspx">allegedly abducted and raped</a> a 10-year-old girl and killed her mother. David Renz, 29, has been accused of carjacking 47-year-old elementary school librarian Lori Bresnahan as she was leaving a gymnastics class at a mall in the Syracuse suburb of Clay with her 10-year-old daughter on Thursday night. Renz allegedly tied up both victims, raped the young girl, and fatally stabbed Bresnahan.</p>

At some point, the young girl escaped and was found by a passing motorist, who called 911 and informed them of Renz&apos;s location. It&apos;s unclear how the girl escaped, and also how Renz <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426151850/http://www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/2013/03/david_renz_suspect_in_clay_car.html">was able to remove his ankle monitoring bracelet</a> without police being aware of it.</p>

<p>Renz had been arrested and charged in January with possession of child pornography; he was allowed to remain free under terms that included staying off the Internet and away from places including schools, parks and arcades. He was also required him to be in his home from 9 p.m. to 7 a.m. and to wear an electronic monitor. Renz, who had no prior arrests, admitted using the Internet for the past six years to download about 100 gigabytes of child porn, made up of more than 500 videos and more than 3,000 images.</p>

<p>A neighbor, who asked not to be identified, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426151850/http://www.cnycentral.com/news/story.aspx?id=872395#.UUSPEHzohWm">told CNY Central</a> that the Renz family is quiet and keeps to themselves. The neighbor said there was often periods of months where Renz was not seen at the family&#x2019;s home in Cicero. According to court documents, Renz lost his part-time job at Wal-Mart after his arrest for child pornography, moved in with his mother and hadn&apos;t been able to find other work since.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426151850/http://www.cnycentral.com/news/story.aspx?id=872732#.UUSPoXzohWl">CNY Central also reported</a> that Renz appeared at his arraignment on Friday with a swollen face and a broken nose after being assaulted by inmates at the Onondaga County Justice Center. </p>
