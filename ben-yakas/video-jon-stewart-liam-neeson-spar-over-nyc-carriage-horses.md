<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508155338/http://gothamist.com/tags/liamneeson">Mr Liam Neesons</a> has been a very passionate and outspoken advocate of carriage horses in NYC for years, to the point that he has even claimed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508155338/http://gothamist.com/2009/01/23/video_liam_neeson_would_live_in_nyc.php">he would live in their stables if he could</a>, if only society could accept Liam Neeson living in a horse stable. He cares about these horses so much, he&apos;s willing to titillate NY Post catlady-in-residence Andrea Peyser to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508155338/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/10/liam_neeson_has_very_strong_feeling.php">bring more attention to the issue</a>. Neeson brought his very passionate horse charm offensive to <em>The Daily Show</em> last night. Unfortunately, Stewart wasn&apos;t very TAKEN by his argument. Watch below.</p>

<p>Neeson started by bitching about Mayor de Blasio (&quot;I&apos;m a little pissed off about our newly elected mayor&quot;) who has previously promised to put an end to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508155338/http://gothamist.com/tags/carriagehorses">NYC&apos;s carriage horse industry</a>, before he regaled Stewart with tales of how the horse carriage industry &quot;made the roads of New York,&quot; adding &quot;these guys treat these horses like their children.&quot; Stewart was skeptical, responding: &quot;What, are the roads made out of horse shit?&quot;</p>

<p>Stewart tried to be evenhanded about the debate (&quot;I think the two sides do not trust each other at all&quot;), but Neeson insisted that this is a fulfilling life for horses: &quot;Well, we don&apos;t know. Unless it&apos;s Mr Ed you really don&apos;t know...they could be trained to sit in a field and eat fermented poop...&quot; <br>
