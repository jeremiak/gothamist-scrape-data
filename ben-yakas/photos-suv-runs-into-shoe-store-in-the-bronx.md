</div></div>					<p>Last night, an SUV barreled into a Bronx Payless shoe store, injuring 12 people. The incident happened just after 7 p.m. on Jerome Avenue near East Gun Hill Road. A reader told us, &quot;From what I gather, one SUV was making a U-Turn, was struck by an oncoming SUV, airbag deployed, driver accidentally slammed on the gas, driving straight into the store. Saw two people get carted off, didn&apos;t seem like anyone was killed.&quot;</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504134508/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/bronx/seizure_driver_crashes_hurt_313GymIrTovC07J7EYhARJ">Post reports</a> that an SUV driver had a seizure: &quot;The driver suddenly swerved his Ford Expedition into a parked car outside of a Payless shoe store...Witnesses on the scene said a woman working in the store was thrown under the car after it careened into the shop.&quot;  All told, 12 people were injured, including three of the driver&apos;s passengers and a person in the parked car.  </p>
