<p>A fire broke out at a Whole Foods location in Manhattan this afternoon. According <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429154032/http://www.boweryboogie.com/2013/01/fire-forces-evacuation-of-whole-foods-bowery/?utm_campaign=socialflow&amp;utm_source=socialflow&amp;utm_medium=twitter">to witnesses</a>, the fire broke out around 4:45 p.m. at the Bowery Whole Foods at 95 East Houston Street. They weren&apos;t able to confirm what caused the fire, but a tipster told us it stemmed from the prepared foods section. That tipster also sent in the below video of the scene, noting: &quot;Funny bit is some folks near top of checkout line were begging to be checked out while the sprinklers are spraying and smoke all over store.&quot; After all, those <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429154032/http://wholefoodsmarket.com/about-our-products/whole-deal/sure-deals">365 Everyday Value&#xAE; Complete Body Cleanses</a> aren&apos;t going to buy themselves.</p>

<p>The tipster noted that the evacuation went very smoothly, and &quot;staff were nice and apologetic.&quot; FDNY couldn&apos;t confirm the fire by deadline, but a store worker confirmed that it happened. That worker told us they didn&apos;t know what caused the fire, but they have re-opened. Check out some Tweets from the scene below:</p>
