<p>A Times Square Spider-Man <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140619212128/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/13/spider-man_claims_mom_attacked_him.php">who allegedly assaulted</a> a mom last year because she wouldn&apos;t tip him after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140619212128/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/11/spider-man_allegedly_attacks_mom_in.php">he posed in a photo</a> with her two kids claims that he was just defending himself. But how does the alleged victim know for sure that police caught the right Spider-Man? Apparently radioactive spiders have a very distinct scent.</p>

<p>Philip Williams, 36, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140619212128/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/18/nyregion/accused-of-unheroic-acts-a-spider-man-claims-self-defense.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;_r=0">claimed in court yesterday</a> that 46-year-old Victoria Goreaciuc struck him with a chunk of ice in Times Square in February 2013. Both parties agree that Williams posed for photos with Goreaciuc&apos;s 5 and 7 year old kids, then asked for a tip; when Goreaciuc said she didn&apos;t have cash, Williams cursed at her in front of the kids (his lawyer admits he may have called her a &quot;piece of crap&quot;).</p>

<p>She walked away, but then decided to report the incident and return with her husband a little while later. Williams claims Goreaciuc&#x2019;s husband grabbed him from behind and tried to rip off his backpack.  &quot;I thought I was being attacked, maybe being robbed,&#x201D; he said in court Tuesday, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140619212128/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/18/nyregion/accused-of-unheroic-acts-a-spider-man-claims-self-defense.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;_r=0">according to the Times</a>. &quot;I thought I was being jumped basically.&quot; Goreaciuc claims Williams slugged her in the face unprompted. </p>

<p>Goreaciuc told the court that she could identify Williams solely by the smell of his costume. Never one to let an opportunity for a creepy journalistic endeavors pass them by, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140619212128/http://nypost.com/2014/06/18/mom-knows-spider-man-attacker-by-his-scent-alone/">NY Post sent reporters</a> with a nose for justice out into Time Square to sniff out the truth:</p>

<blockquote>Though the courtroom smell test may seem like something out of a bad &#x201C;Matlock&#x201D; episode, IDing a Times Square-area Spider-Man solely by smell isn&#x2019;t that difficult of a task, The Post learned after running a superhero-odor survey on Tuesday. One stinky Spidey lingered in a fog of his own musk at Broadway and 42nd Street &#x2014; putting forth a distinct melange of cheap deodorant, body odor and stale musk. Despite this, he was demanding people pay for the privilege of standing next to him for photos.

<p>A second web-slinger wannabe, standing in front of Toys &#x201C;R&#x201D; Us, had a slightly sweet and sweaty bouquet that also could have been as good as a DNA test if it were ever to be brought up in court. It was the type of smell that may have struck Goreaciuc&#x2019;s nose during her dust-up with Williams.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>Yup, just another <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140619212128/http://gothamist.com/tags/nypost">day at the NY Post.</a></p>

<p><strong> A Spectacular Update For Daily Bugle Readers:</strong> The Amazing Spider-Man impersonator <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140619212128/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/19/nyregion/times-square-spider-man-found-not-guilty-of-assault.html?ref=nyregion">has been found not guilty</a> of assaulting Goreaciuc. The judge did hit Williams with a $250 fine for harassment, because he cursed around the children. Until next time web-slingers, excelsior! </p>
