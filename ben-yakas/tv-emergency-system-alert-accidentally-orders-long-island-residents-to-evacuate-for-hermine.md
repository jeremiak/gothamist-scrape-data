<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161113150521/http://gothamist.com/2016/09/04/hermine.php">As was expected</a>, Post-Tropical Cyclone <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161113150521/http://gothamist.com/tags/hermine">Hermine</a> took an eastbound turn yesterday, mostly missing the tri-state area. Tropical storm warnings were cancelled for the NYC region, but warnings are still in effect for Suffolk County, as high winds and coastal flooding could <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161113150521/http://abc7ny.com/weather/hermine-spins-out-of-way-of-ny-area;-still-lingering-off-shore/1492844/">still be in the cards for the area.</a> But certainly nothing so bad that it would necessitate a complete evacuation of Long Island&#x2014;which is exactly what some people thought was happening this weekend.</p>

They wanted to inform TV viewers that a voluntary evacuation had been ordered for Fire Island. Unfortunately, only the first part of the message was broadcast around 7:30 p.m. Saturday&#x2014;the part that read an evacuation order had been issued. </p>

<p>&quot;It caused obvious and expected questioning,&quot; Gregory Miniutto, chief of communication for Suffolk County&apos;s Department of Fire Rescue, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161113150521/http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2016/09/emergency_alert_on_tv_mistaken.html">told AP.</a> A spokesperson for FEMA added that officials are investigating what caused the message to be shortened.</p>
