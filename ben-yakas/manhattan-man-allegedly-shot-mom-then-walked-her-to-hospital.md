<p>A Manhattan man has been arrested after he allegedly shot his mom in the back, and then walked her to the hospital. Police say that the 32-year-old son, whose name hasn&apos;t been released, was arrested for shooting his 62-year-old mother inside her apartment at 224 E. 28th Street in Kips Bay just before 9 a.m. Friday. </p>

<p>The son allegedly shot his mom in her back with a .380 Caliber gun, then walked her to Bellevue Hospital before fleeing. He later returned to the crime scene to ask neighbors about her status: &quot;He was standing between for hours and asked what&#x2019;s happening, what&#x2019;s going on,&quot; one witness <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140610001042/http://nypost.com/2014/06/06/off-duty-school-cop-shot-in-her-apartment/">told the Post</a>. &quot;He was very casual &#x2014; that&#x2019;s why nobody paid attention.&quot;</p>

<p>The Post has identified the mom as Edith Ragin, an NYPD school safety agent; she is listed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140610001042/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/nyc-school-shot-home-police-article-1.1819788">in stable condition</a> at Bellevue, and was reportedly the one who told cops her son had shot her. It&apos;s unclear whether it was an accident or on purpose; police add the investigation is ongoing.</p>
