<p>The best part of waking up is Rudy in your cup: Mayor of 9/11 Town <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170929170343/http://gothamist.com/tags/rudygiuliani">Rudy Giuliani</a> joined Guardian Angels founder Curtis Sliwa on his radio show earlier this morning. Giuliani was there to chit-chat and lend support to Sliwa, who is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170929170343/http://www.capitaltonight.com/2011/04/sliwa-takes-a-break-for-prostate-surgery/">taking a hiatus</a> from his many jobs in order to undergo prostate surgery. Giuliani, who has been on a bit of a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170929170343/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/07/video_asked_about_911_giuliani_desc.php">storytelling</a> kick of late, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170929170343/http://www.capitaltonight.com/2011/04/giuliani-on-sick-gotti-film-spitzers-extortion/">ripped into</a> two of his favorite targets during the visit: Eliot Spitzer and the Gambinos. <strong>&quot;This is like having Hitler as a hero,</strong>&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170929170343/http://twitter.com/#!/azipaybarah/status/61030203627012096">he said of</a> the upcoming Gotti movie.</p>

<p>When Sliwa asked whether he thought Spitzer might run for Mayor in 2013, Giuliani laughed out loud: &#x201C;I can&#x2019;t imagine that Eliot Spitzer wants to run for public office again after what he did while he was in the last two public offices as attorney general and as governor.&#x201D; He claimed that Spitzer didn&apos;t just commit &quot;personal misconduct&quot;, and mentioned that his case against former NYSE head Dick Grasso was thrown out of the court: <strong>&#x201C;People forget the guy won his cases basically by extortion out of the courtroom.&#x201D;</strong> As for his own possible <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170929170343/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/22/giuliani_more_willing_to_run_for_pr.php">presidential ambitions</a>, Giuliani remained coy, though he did say, &#x201C;Another four years of this president, and the damage will be irreparable to our economy and our national security.&#x201D;</p>

<p>But he kept his fiercest criticism for the Gambino family, and in particular, John Gotti Jr.&apos;s star-studded <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170929170343/http://gothamist.com/tags/johngottijr">movie project</a>, <em>Gotti: Three Generations.</em> The movie, which has already <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170929170343/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/31/john_travolta_to_play_teflon_don_go.php">netted</a> John Travolta to star as John Gotti Sr., was imagined by Gotti Jr. as a &quot;father-son&quot; story, rather than a straight-forward mafia movie. Recalling his days as a prosecutor, Giuliani called Gotti. Sr.  &#x201C;disgusting&#x201D;, &#x201C;horrible&#x201D; and &#x201C;a dumb moron,&#x201D; and added that the idea of &quot;glorifying this guy who enjoyed showing up at killings because he enjoyed watching them is sick.&#x201D; </p>

<p>Sliwa, also no fan of the Gambinos since, you know, Junior <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170929170343/http://gothamist.com/2007/11/29/sliwa_offers_go.php">allegedly kidnapped and shot him</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170929170343/http://bitterqueen.typepad.com/friends_of_ours/2011/04/curtis-sliwa-takes-on-john-gotti-biopic.html">is petitioning</a> the city to deny film permits to the movie, saying, &quot;To think that [Gotti Jr.] will now be able to profit from his lifetime worth of crimes is beyond the pale.  <strong>To add insult to injury (literally in my case), to allow him to use the streets and locations of our fair city to line his blood laden pockets is absolutely unconscionable.</strong>&quot;</p>
