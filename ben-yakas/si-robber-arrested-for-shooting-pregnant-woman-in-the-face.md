<p>A Staten Island man has been arrested and accused of shooting a pregnant woman in the face during a robbery, resulting in the woman losing her pregnancy. Abdourahmane Seck, 25, has been charged with attempted murder and robbery for allegedly shooting 28-year-old Marisela Vasquez on June 17th.</p>

<p>Police say that Seck and an accomplice approached Vasquez in the vicinity of Castleton and Port Richmond Avenues in Staten Island and demanded her money. When she refused, he shot her in the jaw. She was taken to the hospital, where she <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502174310/http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2013/10/nypd_increases_reward_for_susp.html#incart_m-rpt-2">lost her unborn child</a> due to complications from the injury.</p>

<p>A week later, police say Seck approached an 18-year-old man and demanded money again; when the victim refused, Seck allegedly shot the man in the hand. He allegedly also is responsible for five other robberies which took place on Staten Island between January 10th and January 14th this year. </p>
