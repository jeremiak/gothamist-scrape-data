He pleaded not guilty today to 147 counts of of identity theft, grand larceny, and other charges, and is being held in lieu of $150,000 bail. Osahon allegedly stole victims&apos; personal data via illegal online data traffickers; Manhattan DA Cyrus Vance said Osahon subsequently blew through the cash by buying Tiffany jewelry, Rolex watches, and luxury goods from Louis Vuitton and Bloomingdale&apos;s. But at least he&apos;s keeping his humor about him: As cops were arresting him, he leveled with them, <strong>&quot;What can I say? You&apos;ve got me by the balls.&quot;</strong></p>
