<p>So far, details around the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427122534/http://gothamist.com/tags/seinfeld">secret <em>Seinfeld</em> project</a> have been vague at best: we know that Jerry Seinfeld, Jason Alexander and Larry David <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427122534/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/13/jerry_seinfeld_jason_alexander_are.php#photo-1">were all spotted</a> loitering around Tom&apos;s Restaurant on the Upper West Side. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427122534/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/30/jerry_seinfeld_reveals_secret_proje.php">We know</a> Alexander is playing George Costanza, and multiple other characters from the show are involved. But that&apos;s basically it&#x2014;we&apos;re not sure if it&apos;s a Super Bowl commercial or an internet one-off or a new episode of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427122534/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxhs-O_9BLc">The Merv Griffin Show.</a> But Alexander threw a little bit of cold water on all the excitement today via Twitter:  </p>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>not sure if when all is said and done, you will all think of it as a &quot;reunion&quot; but we hope you enjoy. I&apos;m sure you&apos;ll let us know. :)</p>&#x2014; jason alexander (@IJasonAlexander) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427122534/https://twitter.com/IJasonAlexander/statuses/429266709204058112">January 31, 2014</a></blockquote>

<p>Seinfeld, who let a few details about the project slip on WFAN&#x2019;s &#x201C;Boomer &amp; Carton&#x201D; show this week, was the one who called it a <em>Seinfeld</em> reunion; he also said it is &quot;a short-ish form&quot; film, he thinks this is a one-off project, and we&apos;ll see it &quot;very very soon.&quot; His wife doubled down on that last bit today:</p>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Someone&apos;s excited about a new secret project hitting v.v.v. soon. So soon.&#x2026; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427122534/http://t.co/fMP2kAoSDg">http://t.co/fMP2kAoSDg</a></p>&#x2014; Jessica Seinfeld (@JessSeinfeld) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427122534/https://twitter.com/JessSeinfeld/statuses/429006530462351360">January 30, 2014</a></blockquote>

<p>So are we setting ourselves up for a huge disappointment? Is this like that time Jerry thinks he&apos;s dating a Chinese woman but she actually just changed her name <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427122534/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsKpShq2X6s">from Changstein to Chang</a>? Is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427122534/https://twitter.com/OfficialJLD/status/425077501778354176/photo/1">this the best</a> we&apos;re going to get? It&apos;s all seeming more and more likely, unfortunately. Hope may spring eternal, but as Costanza once said, &quot;I don&apos;t want hope. Hope is killing me. My dream is to become hopeless.&quot;</p>

<p>So we will now become hopeless, and maybe we&apos;ll be pleasantly surprise. Either way, it doesn&apos;t matter, since we&apos;ve already gotten the best <em>Seinfeld</em> reunion we could ever hope for:</p>
