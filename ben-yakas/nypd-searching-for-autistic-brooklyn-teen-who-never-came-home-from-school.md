<p>Police are searching for an autistic Brooklyn teen who never came home from school on Friday. Eliceo Cortez, 14, was supposed to take the school bus home from the Leonard M. Goldstein High School in Manhattan Beach. School officials believe he left with friends to get pizza, but he was last seen at the Sheepshead Bay train station Q line around 2:30 p.m. Friday.</p>

<p>&quot;I&apos;m scared,&quot; his mother, 48-year-old Nancy Reavis, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140519233034/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/14-year-old-autistic-brooklyn-boy-missing-article-1.1796647">told the News</a>. &quot;I know he is terrified. He has never been alone like this.&quot; She added that he regularly cut class, but had never disappeared overnight on his own, and he wasn&apos;t used to riding on the subway. &quot;He doesn&apos;t know how to ride the trains,&quot; Reavis said. &quot;If he&apos;s on the train I don&apos;t know what could be happening to him.&quot;</p>

<p>Eliceo is described as being 6&apos;1&quot;, 135 lbs., with brown eyes, black close cut hair and has a long scar down his back. He was last seen wearing a gray hooded sweatshirt, blue jeans and black converse hi-top sneakers. The family has been putting missing flyers up around Brooklyn all weekend.</p>
