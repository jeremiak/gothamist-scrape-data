<p>The family of the 6-year-old child <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130312034713/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/28/6-year-old_boy_killed_killed_by_tra.php">who was tragically struck and killed</a> by a truck while walking to school in East Harlem plan to file a $50 million lawsuit against the city and the absent crossing guard who wasn&apos;t there the morning of the incident. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130312034713/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/mow_kid_family_suit_jMsEMOc3sHlDoFZWVLtPwL">According to the Post</a>, the family of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130312034713/http://gothamist.com/tags/amardiarrassouba">Amar Diarrassouba</a>, who was killed by the truck on Feb. 28th, also filed a suit in New Jersey against the trucking company, McLane Foodservice Distribution, and the driver, Robert Carroll Jr., for alleged negligence. The family <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130312034713/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/tragic_boy_uncle_lashes_out_at_mike_zMMSiWgKPpngiXWhx76T2M?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Manhattan">also lashed out at Mayor Bloomberg</a> for comments he made in the aftermath of the incident.</p>

<p>&quot;Though we are all grieving for the loss of our young relative, I must take a moment to express our outrage at your colossal insensitivity and total lack of compassion,&quot; Lassina Diarrassouba, Amar&apos;s uncle, wrote the mayor on March 6th. &quot;If you have nothing compassionate to say, it would be better to say nothing at all.&quot; </p>

<p>On March 5th, Bloomberg had responded to a question about the incident by answering more generally to parents about instructing their children to be careful when crossing the street: &quot;We have signs. We try to educate our kids. And parents have a responsibility to talk to their kids and explain to them they have to look before they cross, not let very young ones go out without supervision.&quot;</p>

<p>The way it was initially written, Bloomberg&apos;s words seemed more specifically directed at the Diarrassouba family&#x2014;Amar was walking with his 9-year-old brother Issouf when he was struck crossing First Avenue at East 117th Street. While Diarrassouba understands now that Bloomberg was &#x201C;probably talking to all,&#x201D; he told the Post he still thinks, &#x201C;You have to choose the right time [to comment].&#x201D;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130312034713/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/mow_kid_family_suit_jMsEMOc3sHlDoFZWVLtPwL">In the family&apos;s</a> &quot;notice of claim&quot; against the city, the NYPD and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130312034713/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/02/parents_say_they_complained_about_a.php">crossing guard Flavia Roman</a> on behalf of Issouf, they say: &#x201C;He could have been killed, witnessed his younger brother being struck and dragged by the truck and sustained traumatic and psychological, mental and emotional injuries.&#x201D; Despite mom Mehichta Diarrassouba previously saying the family didn&apos;t blame Roman for her son&apos;s death, the suit argue that Roman &#x201C;deserted her post, abandoning the children who were promised her protection.&#x201D;</p>

<p>&#x201C;She lied that she was on a bathroom break,&#x201D; said Daniel Kim, the family&#x2019;s lawyer. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s not a volunteer position. The city should have a better system in place.&#x201D; Earlier this week, Manhattan BP Scott Stringer joined State Assemblyman Robert Rodriquez and Councilmember Melissa Mark-Viverito <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130312034713/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/04/manhattan_borough_president_scott_s.php">for a press conference outside of the boy&apos;s school</a> to call upon the DOT to introduce more traffic-calming measures, as well as &quot;zero tolerance&quot; for big trucks on narrow, residential streets.</p>
