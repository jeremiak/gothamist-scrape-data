title: Columbine-Threat Teacher Speaks: "I Wasn't Thinking"
---

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:250px; "> <img alt="4811teacher.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412125436im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/4811teacher.jpg" width="250" height="148"> <br> <i>Sabrina Milo and her husband</i></div> Ever since Fort Hamilton High School art teacher Sabrina Milo made <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412125436/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/02/former_rubber_room_teacher_arrested.php">&quot;Columbine-like&quot;</a> threats to bring a machine gun to her Brooklyn school and &quot;settle some scores,&quot; her week has completely gone to shit. After she was arrested, everyone and their <strike>mother</strike> lawyer has given their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412125436/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/04/columbine-threat_teacher_was_just_v.php">opinion</a> on whether her threats were just venting, or something to take seriously. But finally, Milo herself has spoken about the incident: &quot;<strong>It didn&apos;t even occur to me that the foolish statement I made would be perceived as a terrorist threat</strong>,&quot; she <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412125436/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/investigators&amp;id=8060008">told ABC.</a><p></p>

<p>Milo admitted on camera that she did in fact make the threats in the teacher&apos;s lounge: &quot;I started crying and said, &apos;if I had a shotgun and a trench coat, it would be Columbine all over again.&apos;&quot; But she says it was just an expression of her frustration, the kind of gallows humor that teachers need to survive the job, and share with each other: &quot;I wasn&apos;t thinking. It was exercising poor judgment. The door was shut. It was adults. Many times we have gathered together and vented in our own ways.&quot; </p>

<p>Now, after a trip to Rikers Island and having to pay $100,000 bail to leave it, she is fully aware of just how bad an idea it was to say what she did: &quot;If I could go back in time, I would not say it. It&apos;s scary. I am scared because I want to go back to my school and teach. I want to be with my students.&quot; Her students, many of whom have come to her defense in the past week, planned to stage a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412125436/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/06/columbine-threat_teachers_students.php">walkout today</a> in protest of her arrest. </p>
