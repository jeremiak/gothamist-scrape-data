<p>In June, an out of control <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140307050635/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/14/chris_brown_tweets_photo_of_injured.php">bottle brawl</a> at SoHo club <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140307050635/http://gothamist.com/tags/workinprogress">Work In Progress (WiP)</a> left destruction in its wake&#x2014;Chris Brown had his chin scratched, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140307050635/http://gothamist.com/tags/drake">Drake</a> was ticketed, over a dozen other people claimed they were physically injured (including an Australian tourist and an Olympic basketball player), and Rihanna&apos;s reputation was allegedly besmirched. WiP and the Greenhouse club where it&apos;s located were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140307050635/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/23/wip_charged_by_sla_might_close_down.php">briefly shut down</a>, and had their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140307050635/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/27/drakechris_brown_brawl_bar_loses_li.php">booze license revoked</a>&#x2014;now, WiP owner Entertainment Enterprises <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140307050635/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/manhattan_nightclub_slaps_chris_v1qtjGffzxDzFiE84M0wzM">is suing Brown and Drake for $16 million</a> for starting the brawl, which they claim was sparked because the two stars &quot;shared a grudge against the other arising out of their romantic relationships with the same woman.&quot;</p>

<p>There have been various reports about how and why the fight started&#x2014;according to the most salacious sources, a note reading &quot;&apos;I am f--king the love of your life,&apos; was sent from Drake&#x2019;s table to Brown at about 4 a.m. on June 14th. According to their lawsuit, WiP claims both stars arrived &quot;with his own small army of bodyguards, &apos;security&apos; personnel, employees, friends and other members of their entourage, consisting of at least 15 heavily built men trained and/or experienced in hand-to-hand and weapons combat.&quot; But WiP alleges it was Brown and Drake who first came to blows when they &quot;began to fight violently with each other.&quot;</p>

<p>WiP says Brown and Drake specifically ordered their entourages to join in the fight, and their crews &quot;fashioned deadly weapons out of whatever materials they could find, including glasses, alcohol bottles and furniture.&quot; The suit claims:</p>

<blockquote>On defendant Brown and defendant Drake&apos;s instructions, their two posses had at each other, throwing highball glasses laden with alcohol, shattering the handles of bottles of spirits to use as makeshift knives, and even throwing full bottles at each other. Within seconds, defendants filled an already packed nightclub full of flying glass shrapnel.</blockquote>

<p>Besides losing money <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140307050635/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/27/drakechris_brown_brawl_bar_loses_li.php">from being shuttered</a> after the fight, the suit claims the bad publicity from the incident scuttled a $4 million deal to license the Greenhouse name; in addition, the club <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140307050635/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/22/tony_parker_sues_soho_club_over_dra.php">is being sued for $20 million</a> by basketball player Tony Parker over a scratched retina. The club says Brown and Drake need to pay for &quot;ultrahazardous activity,&quot; and adds that the two &quot;should have foreseen that their notoriety and celebrity would ensure that their acts had far reaching and devastating effects.&quot; But if that were the case, then at least one of the two stars would have had the good sense not to leave his own house since, oh, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140307050635/http://perezhilton.com/2012-02-17-court-documents-of-chris-brown-rihanna-beating-released/">sometime in 2009.</a></p>
