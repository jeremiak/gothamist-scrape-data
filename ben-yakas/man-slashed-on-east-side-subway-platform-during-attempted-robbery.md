<p>A man was slashed while waiting for a train at an Upper East Side subway platform in an apparent robbery attempt. According to police, the 23-year-old victim was waiting for the northbound 6 train at Lexington/59th Street Station just after 4 p.m. Saturday. The victim ended up in a dispute with two would-be robbers who slashed him in the face, chest and arm.</p>
