<p>Hugh Jackman has been playing the character Wolverine for the last 400 years in various X-Men/Wolverine/Fox-produced Marvel movies (true fact: I saw the original X-Men movie open at the Ziegfield Theater back in 1617). There have been two different sets of X-Men (who doesn&apos;t love time travel?), two Supermen (four if you count TV), two Batmen, and three different Spider-Men let loose on the world while Jackman has continued doing his thing and being the best there is at what he does. So it&apos;s understandable, and a bummer, that he finally decided it was time to hang up the claws next year. </p>

<p>But superhero movie fans will get one more chance to see Jackman&apos;s iconic portrayal of the character in the third and final Wolverine solo film, <em>Logan</em>, which will be released March 3rd, 2017. And based on the first trailer below, it looks like it&apos;s going to be a unique film for a superhero movie: a depressed buddy flick about the end of mutants featuring Professor X <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110083559/http://nerdbastards.com/2016/10/06/professor-x-is-looking-pretty-ragged-in-logan/">with dementia</a>, Logan with healing problems, Stephen Merchant as the Invisible Man (ok ok, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110083559/http://www.avclub.com/article/our-first-look-stephen-merchants-caliban-logan-all-244347">Caliban</a>), and a little girl with super powers they have to take care of straight out of <em>The Professional</em>.</p>

<p>This will also be the first Wolverine-related movie to have an R rating. We get a glimpse of why in the trailer:</p>

<p>Throughout all of Jackman&apos;s previous eight appearances as Logan, fans have never gotten to see him don his classic &apos;80s uniform. Will the ninth and final time do the trick?</p>
