Four of the five suspects are male, but the female suspect has the words &quot;Hated&quot; and &quot;Loved&quot; tattooed on her arm. Must be a fan of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428161757/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Night_of_the_Hunter_(film)">Charles Laughton</a>?<p></p>

<p>In the latest incident, the five young suspects acted like they were carrying knives, threatening to cut three straphangers on a platform of the Broadway/Lafayette St. station at 7:10 p.m. on October 1st&#x2014;they ended up stealing &quot;an unknown amount of property&quot; before fleeing. </p>

<p>The previous incident occurred around 7:10 p.m. on September 24th, when four of the suspects stole belonging from three people walking into the Broadway/Lafayette Street station&#x2014;one of the robbers flashed a gun. In the first incident, the same four suspects flashed box cutters and stole property from four victims on a staircase inside the Broadway/East Houston Street station at 5:05 p.m. on August 15th, police said.</p>

<p>According to NYPD crime statistics, crime in the subways <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428161757/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/23/blame_apple_subway_crime_jumps_169.php">is up 16.6 percent</a> since the same period last year. But roving gangs of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428161757/http://gothamist.com/teenagers">teenagers</a> are a constant nuisance for the NYPD across the city, whether <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428161757/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/13/columbus_circle_facing_skateboardin.php">they&apos;re skateboarding</a> in Columbus Circle, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428161757/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/31/brooklyn_cyclists_beware_flying_bri.php">throwing bricks</a> onto Navy Street, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428161757/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/02/danger_punk_teens_attacking_bystand.php">hurling snowballs</a> in Park Slope, or ruining our <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428161757/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/25/video_teens_gone_wild_at_wendys.php">Wendy&apos;s dining experience.</a> For your protection, we recommend breaking out the pepper spray at the first sign of any hoody or Justin Beiber-insignia.</p>
