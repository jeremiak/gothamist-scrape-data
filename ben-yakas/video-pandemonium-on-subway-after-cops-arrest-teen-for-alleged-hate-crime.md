<p>A teen was arrested for an alleged hate crime on the 3 train in Brooklyn on Monday afternoon, sparking a chaotic scene when cops arrived to arrest him. The NYPD says Brooklyn resident Stephen Stowe, 17, had harassed a Jewish passenger aboard a southbound 3 train; Stowe allegedly made anti-Semitic remarks to the passenger and stole his phone. When the train got to Eastern Parkway/Brooklyn Museum subway stop, cops came aboard to arrest him. That&apos;s when pandemonium erupted, as you can see in the video below. </p>

<p>The person who uploaded the video wrote: &quot;NYPD is called to assistance on the &apos;3&apos; train in Brooklyn @ Brooklyn Museum. Man resisting arrest and officer calls for backup. Meanwhile, a woman goes rogue and pays the price...&quot; Cops tell us that Stowe resisted arrest by struggling, which you can see in the video. He has since been charged with aggravated harassment as hate crime, grand larceny of property, resisting arrest, and disorderly conduct.</p>

<p>But in the midst of the chaos, around the 4 minute mark, things get even worse when a young woman violently resists arrest. Cops say 22-year-old Brooklyn resident Sheniqua Joseph was &quot;yelling and standing too close to officers, put her hands on officers while they were trying to arrest Stowe, and punched and kicked at an officer.&quot; Joseph has been charged with resisting arrest, obstructing government administration, and disorderly conduct. </p>
