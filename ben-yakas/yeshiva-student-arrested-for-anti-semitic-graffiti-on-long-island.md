<p>A Yeshiva student has been arrested for allegedly scrawling anti-Semitic graffiti at a Long Island Rail Road station on at least eight occasions. According to Nassau County Police, 18-year-old Jonathan Schuster has been accused of vandalizing billboards at the Cedarhurst LIRR station; he allegedly used a black marker to post &quot;anti-Semitic statements that usually included expletives.&quot;</p>

<p>The graffiti incidents have been going on since December 2012. Schuster, a senior at Priority-1: Torah Academy of Lawrence-Cedarhurst in Nassau, has been charged with eight counts of felony criminal mischief in the third degree as a hate crime, eight counts of criminal mischief in the fourth degree and eight counts making graffiti.</p>

<p>Cops apparently pulled out all the stops to catch Schuster: the year-long investigation by the MTA Police Department and the Nassau County Police Department included uniformed patrols and surveillance by undercover detectives. Police have not said whether there was any specific motive behind the graffiti. Separate graffiti incidents at the nearby Lawrence and Hewlett stations remain under investigation.<br>
