<p>The scientists over at the Slate laboratory have crunched the numbers on SEX, and come to some <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405232204/http://www.slate.com/id/2286240">disturbing conclusions</a>: despite being immature, unable to adapt to contemporary life, and generally less-educated, men are the bosses when it comes to premarital sexual relationships. Their main argument: women are losing the sexual economics game, because the main thing women want out of sex is commitment, and the &quot;the market &apos;price&apos; of sex is currently very low.&quot; </p>

<p>Part of their proof? A scientific study where random men approached girls on college campuses and said, &quot;Will you have sex with me right now?&quot;&#x2014;to which most of the ladies said &apos;no thanks,&apos; <em>surprisingly</em>. But three-quarters of men said yes to the same question! Therefore, women biologically do not want to have sex, ever. It may not be &quot;politically correct,&quot; but you can&apos;t argue with <strike>facts</strike> anecdotal evidence (which is what all science is based on, right?). Aren&apos;t we living in an age when women can just enjoy sex, and desire sex, for the sake of sex? Aren&apos;t we also living in an age where, according to a recent <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405232204/http://nymag.com/news/features/70976/">NY Magazine front cover</a> article, men can no longer have orgasms because of all the pornography? </p>

<p>The whole story stinks of trend-baiting, and you know <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405232204/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/18/trend_alert_is_yoga_the_new_golf_fo.php">how we feel</a> about those kinds of articles. But ladies, who needs to worry about icky sex when you can have a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405232204/http://textboyfriend.com/">Text Boyfriend</a>&#x2014;&quot;no overtexting, no drama. He&apos;s fun and cute and he&apos;s all about you!&quot;</p>
