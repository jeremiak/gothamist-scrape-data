<p>Protests erupted across the country after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170303030930/http://gothamist.com/tags/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> signed an executive order banning immigrants and refugees to the United States from seven majority-Muslim countries, resulting in mass confusion among government agencies and setting the stage for lengthy legal battles over the order. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170303030930/http://gothamist.com/tags/sethmeyers">Seth Meyers</a> tried to put all of Trump&apos;s fumbles over recent days into some context on <em>Late Night With Seth Meyers</em> on Monday: &quot;In just the first week of his presidency, Trump has dropped to record-low approval ratings, had two straight weekends of massive nationwide protests, and lost a court battle over a sloppy and discriminatory executive order. Even Trump&apos;s staff seemed confused and uninformed about the order.&quot;</p>

<p>Watch below as Meyers dissects how Trump&apos;s vague platitudes (&quot;I have a very big heart&quot;) curdle into sociopathic mantras: &quot;People who actually do have a big heart don&apos;t walk around bragging about it. I don&apos;t remember Mother Teresa constantly going, &apos;This is so nice of me, right?!&apos;&quot; </p>

<p>As Meyers summarized toward the end, &quot;It&apos;s only been a week, but the Trump administration has already revealed itself to be a government of incompetent authoritarians with nothing but contempt for many of the very basic constitutional principals this country has cherished since its founding.&quot; </p>

<p>Jimmy Fallon also touched on the Muslim ban in a segment in which he impersonated Trump, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170303030930/http://www.vulture.com/2017/01/jimmy-fallon-reveals-donald-trump-wheel-of-decisions-tonight-show.html">it sucked.</a> It suuuuuuuuucked. Don&apos;t watch it. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170303030930/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jimmy-fallon-donald-trump_us_57dbecd4e4b0071a6e06801e">Go fuck yourself</a> Fallon. </p>
