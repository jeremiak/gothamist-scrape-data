<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="41410shit.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629172923im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/41410shit.jpg" width="200" height="84" class="image-left"> </span>The ramblings of an NYU professor who just <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629172923/http://gothamist.com/2010/02/22/nyu_prof_clarifies_school_policy_on.php">wasn&apos;t going to take it anymore</a> have morphed into merch for the student masses. Back in February, Professor <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629172923/http://w4.stern.nyu.edu/faculty/facultyindex.cgi?id=376">Scott Galloway</a> of NYU&apos;s Stern School of Business admonished a student for showing up late to his class (and having the gall to try to begin a discussion about it) by sending his response email ripping him to shreds (and clarifying NYU&apos;s policy on urinating-on-desks in the process) campus-wide. The email concluded with: &quot;Take to heart what I am about to tell you. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629172923/http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=get+your+shit+together">Get your shit together</a>.&quot; </p>

<p>Never ones to let such golden opportunities pass, three entrepreneurial NYU grad students <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629172923/http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2010/04/nyu_professors_admonition_beco.html?f=most-commented-intel-7d5">felt inspired</a>, and adopted &quot;Get your shit together&quot; as their motto. &quot;Everyone we know is completely overscheduled and needs to prioritize everything, from classwork, to getting to the gym, to work with clubs. I am constantly having to motivate myself. And that&apos;s the phrase we use: <strong>It&apos;s like our &apos;Just Do It,</strong>&apos;&quot; said Lisa Zusman, 25. Now they&apos;ve <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629172923/http://www.cafepress.com/nocryinginbscho">printed it up</a> on t-shirts (&quot;Get Your Sh*t Together&quot;), so you too can feel like a harried NYU student.  </p>

<p>We spoke to Professor Galloway and asked him if he thought the students got the underlying message of his email, &quot;I don&apos;t know if they understood the point or not.  I can tell you that I&apos;m making an effort to be more respectful of other people&apos;s time and have better manners--trying to eat my own cooking.&quot;  Galloway also said he had been promised a shirt, &quot;Regardless, I&apos;m hoping my 15 minutes are nearly up as I&apos;d like to get back to focusing on teaching--whole thing has been a bit of a distraction.&quot;  </p>
