</div></div>					<p>Judging by all the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502151758/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/24/lennon_5.php">high quality fan fic</a> going around, John Lennon&apos;s birthday must be coming up soon. And PBS has a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502151758/http://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/episodes/lennonyc/about-the-film/1551/">new documentary</a> of the musical icon, <em>LENNONYC</em>, which focuses on the time in the 1970s when Lennon was semi-retired from music, living a domesticated life living at The Dakota on the Upper West Side with Yoko Ono and son Sean (you can see a clip from it below). The film will run on PBS in November, but because this is Lennon and NYC, Ono announced there will be a special Summerstage premiere on Lennon&apos;s actual birthday, Oct. 9.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502151758/http://www.ny1.com/content/ny1_living/entertainment/126064/yoko-ono-announces-free-central-park-screening-of-john-lennon-documentary">At a press conference</a> with Mayor Bloomberg announcing the documentary at City Hall yesterday, Ono talked about the importance of the city to Lennon, and how it reflected back on him: &quot;<strong>He was one of us. He believed in what the city represents; incredible wisdom, high energy, and incredible love for life. That was John.</strong>&quot; Since the movie was made with Ono&apos;s blessing and input, there&apos;ll likely be some cool home footage never seen before, along with clips from the <em>Double Fantasy </em>recording sessions, and live video.</p>

<p>&#x201C;The period that Lennon lived with his family in New York is perhaps the most tender and affecting phase of his life as a public figure,&#x201D; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502151758/http://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/episodes/lennonyc/about-the-film/1551/">said Susan Lacy</a>, series creator and executive producer of American Masters as well as a producer of the Lennon film. Of course, as many wouldn&apos;t want you to remember, this was also part of the same time period that Ono and Lennon split up numerous times, and Ono <em>arranged </em>for her assistant <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502151758/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_Pang">May Pang</a> to become his lover. Yup, totally normal domesticated stuff!</p>
