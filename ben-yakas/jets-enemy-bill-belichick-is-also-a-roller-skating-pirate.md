<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405014913/http://gothamist.com/tags/jets">Jets</a> have many enemies&#x2014;foot odor, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405014913/http://gothamist.com/2010/08/24/tom_brady_i_hate_the_jets_jets_we_h.php">Uggs Boots spokesmen</a>, the anti-snacktime lobby, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405014913/http://kissingsuzykolber.uproxx.com/2011/09/a-conspiracy-is-afoot-with-the-dunge.html">&quot;Moral Fibrousness&quot;</a>&#x2014;but none more yellow-bellied and pox-faced than Patriots coach Bill Belichick. Rex Ryan <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405014913/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/10/jets_v_patriots_is_also_personal_fo.php">has called</a> their grudge &quot;personal,&quot; and Jets fans have even <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405014913/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/15/jets_fan_sues_pats_for_cheating.php">tried to sue the Patriots</a> after Belichick was caught cheating several years ago. </p>

Does that make Sexy Rexy a ninja?</p>
