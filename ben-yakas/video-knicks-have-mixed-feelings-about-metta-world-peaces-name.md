<p>The tipoff for the 2013-2014 NBA season is still a month away, but it&apos;s never too soon to start talking about the artist formerly known as Ron Artest, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131003083733/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/15/new_york_comes_to_terms_with_metta.php">Metta World Peace</a>. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131003083733/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/11/metta_world_peace_gives_fashion_adv.php">fashion-conscious</a> addition to the Knicks&apos; roster is already making waves with his teammates over his name&#x2014;as you can see in the video below, some (especially Raymond Felton) are not on board with Peace. &quot;I already told him that,&quot; he said. &quot;I&apos;m not gonna call him Metta, I&apos;m not gonna call him Peace, I&apos;m gonna call him Ron.&quot; Iman Shumpert has the best solution: &quot;Let&apos;s call him Duct Tape. That sounds more intimidating.&quot;</p>
