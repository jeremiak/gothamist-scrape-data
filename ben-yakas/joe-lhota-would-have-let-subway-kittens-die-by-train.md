title: Joe Lhota Would Have Let Subway Kittens Die By Train
---

	
										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="83113cat1.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141023020951im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/83113cat1.jpg" width="640" height="458"> <br> <i> &quot;Why does the mayoral candidate want us to die, sir?&quot; (Animal Care and Control of NYC)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>On Wednesday, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141023020951/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/29/video_adorable_kittens_frolic_on_su.php">a pair of adorable kittens frolicking on the train tracks</a> brought subway service to standstill in Brooklyn for several hours as workers tried to rescue them. August and Arthur <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141023020951/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/30/subway_kittens_finally_rescued_will.php">were thankfully rescued</a>, and are now being taken care of at Animal Care and Control Center. But if Joe Lhota was mayor, we maybe wouldn&apos;t have had such a positive outcome. Lhota&apos;s campaign spokesman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141023020951/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/lhota_would_have_let_kittens_get_OkcNwKTVk8pEbh6dVS1BjJ?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Local">the Post</a> that if he were mayor, he would not have stopped the trains: &#x201C;It&#x2019;s not the decision of the mayor, it&apos;s up to the MTA, but he would not shut down the line.&#x201D; And this has inspired rival John Catsimatidis to go on the offensive with the single greatest cat-related political campaign in history.</p>

<p>Catsimatidis was apparently deeply moved by the adventures of the subway kittens, writing this poetic email <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141023020951/http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2013/08/kitten-train-candidates-weiner-lhota.html?mid=twitter_nymag">to Daily Intel:</a></p>

<blockquote>
I am an Animal Lover
Especially CATS
Supposed they were
Baby Rats
Its up to the Policeman on the Scene to make decision
Not the Mayor</blockquote>

<p>And then he started tweeting about it:</p>

<p>Apparently, this incident hit Catsimatidis especially hard because he misses his own fluffball:</p>

<p>For what it&apos;s worth, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141023020951/https://twitter.com/TMannWSJ/status/373810581478060032">there were trains running</a> at different points Wednesday while the cats were still under the third rail, and they weren&apos;t killed&#x2014;but when you get lobbed a softball about animals, you <em>always</em> go the safe route. Lhota is likely still hurting since he had to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141023020951/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/showing_lhota_love_for_late_lab_2So2hVDUM12fZcJ3kQrnpI?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Local">put his 15-year-old dog down earlier this week.</a></p>

<p>As for the other candidates, they all were smart enough to align themselves with pro-kitten stances: Republican candidate George McDonald <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141023020951/http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2013/08/kitten-train-candidates-weiner-lhota.html?mid=twitter_nymag">told Daily Intel</a> this was a good solution for the rat problem, a spokesman for Bill Thompson said he would &quot;work to protect&quot; subway kittens in such a situation, and a spokesperson for Christine Quinn said &quot;Chris would have stopped the trains for the kitties.&quot; </p>

<p>As for Anthony Weiner, whose campaign has hit rock bottom in recent weeks, he&apos;ll apparently do anything to win any supporters at this point: &#x201C;If Anthony is elected mayor, he will not only stop trains for kittens, he will personally crawl over the third rail to do it,&#x201D; spokeswoman Barbara Morgan told the Post.</p>

<p>The kittens, who are around eight-weeks-old, are undergoing physical and behavioral tests, and will receive shots this weekend. They will be transferred to a foster home over the next couple of days, then put up for adoption: &#x201C;They&#x2019;ll be available for adoption in a couple of weeks, after some much-needed TLC,&#x201D; said AC&amp;C; spokesman Richard P. Gentles.</p>
