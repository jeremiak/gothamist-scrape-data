<p><strong>[Update Below]</strong> Johnny Depp, who has had more than his fair share of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170623191307/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/johnny-depp-a-star-crisis-insane-story-his-missing-millions-1001513">unfavorable press</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170623191307/http://www.thedailybeast.com/johnny-depp-does-not-deserve-your-sympathy">lately</a>, added another notch to his bad boy belt this week. At the Glastonbury Festival in England on Thursday, Johnny Depp took the stage and asked the audience, &quot;Can you bring Trump here?&quot; After saying Trump &quot;needs help,&quot; he continued: &quot;When was the last time an actor assassinated a president?&quot; He then seemed to walk it back slightly by saying, &quot;I want to clarify: I&apos;m not an actor. I lie for a living. However, it&apos;s been awhile, and maybe it&apos;s time.&quot;</p>

<p>The NY Times has another <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170623191307/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/23/arts/johnny-depp-glastonbury-trump.html?_r=1">angle of the speech here.</a> &quot;I think he needs help. By the way, this is going to be in the press and it&apos;ll be horrible,&quot; he said during the speech. &quot;But I like that you&apos;re all a part of it.&quot; According to the Times, he reportedly added, &quot;It&apos;s just a question; I&apos;m not insinuating anything.&quot;</p>

<p>For those who completely skipped American history in order to smoke weed and watch <em>21 Jump Street</em> reruns, President Abraham Lincoln was assassinated at Ford&apos;s Theatre in Washington D.C. in 1865 by actor John Wilkes Booth, as Lincoln attended a performance of the play <em>Our American Cousin</em>. John Hinckley Jr., who tried to assassinate Ronald Reagan in 1981, was an aspiring songwriter and Jodie Foster fanatic.</p>

The backlash to his comments has been swift on social media and from various news organization; Fox News ran the headline, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170623191307/http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2017/06/23/johnny-depp-talks-about-assassinating-trump.html">&quot;Johnny Depp talks about assassinating Trump.&quot;</a></p>

<p>Depp&apos;s comment comes a week after the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170623191307/http://www.cnn.com/2017/06/14/politics/alexandria-virginia-shooting/index.html">politically-motivated shooting</a> of Rep. Steve Scalise during a Republicans&apos; early-morning practice ahead of a charity baseball game. It also comes on the heels of a controversy over the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170623191307/http://gothamist.com/tags/shakespeareinthepark"> Public Theater&apos;s production of <em>Julius Caesar</em> in Central Park</a>, which turned Caesar into a Trump-like figure. Several protesters <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170623191307/http://gothamist.com/2017/06/19/caesar_protesters_central_park.php">were arrested</a> for disrupting recent performances.</p>

<p>This is also far from the first celebrity to joke about or allude to the president&apos;s assassination; Kathy Griffin <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170623191307/http://gothamist.com/2017/05/31/kathy_griffin_trump_cnn.php">got in trouble</a> for holding a prop of Trump&apos;s bloody and severed head, losing her job as co-host of CNN&apos;s New Year&#x2019;s Eve program. Earlier this year at the Women&#x2019;s March on Washington, Madonna <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170623191307/http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/23/entertainment/madonna-white-house/index.html">said that</a> she&apos;d &quot;thought an awful lot about blowing up the White House.&quot;</p>

<p>Of course, celebrities saying controversial and violent things about the president is a long-standing tradition on both sides of the aisle, as with Ted Nugent&apos;s many previous calls <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170623191307/http://www.thedailybeast.com/ted-nugent-wants-to-elect-trump-and-kill-hillary-clinton-barack-obama">to kill Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama.</a></p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Depp <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170623191307/http://people.com/politics/johnny-depp-apologizes-for-comments-about-president-trump/">has now apologized</a> for this comments at Glastonbury: &quot;I apologize for the bad joke I attempted last night in poor taste about President Trump,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;It did not come out as intended, and I intended no malice. I was only trying to amuse, not to harm anyone.&quot;</p>
