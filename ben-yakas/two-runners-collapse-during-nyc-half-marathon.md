<p>At least <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429124651/http://nypost.com/2014/03/16/runner-collapses-during-new-york-city-half-marathon/">two people collapsed</a> during today&apos;s NYC Half-Marathon, including one man who suffered a heart attack. That 43-year-old man, whose name hasn&apos;t been released, collapsed on the corner of Water and Wall Streets right at the end of the race, and stopped breathing around 9:40 a.m. He was rushed to New York Presbyterian/Lower Manhattan Hospital in critical but stable condition, and is expected to survive.</p>

He was put in a wheelchair but he refused any more medical attention. &quot;Mo was lightheaded at the finish line and was attended to by our medical team. He was taken to our medical tent for evaluation and released and then met with the press at the media center where he said he was fine,&quot; said New York Road Runners spokesman Chris Weiller. </p>
