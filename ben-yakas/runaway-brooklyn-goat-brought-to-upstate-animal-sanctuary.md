<p>This week, a runaway goat <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151017092130/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/07/video_runaway_goat_caught_running_w.php">was spotted running around Bedford-Stuyvesant</a> in the middle of the night; the goat was eventually caught by hospital security guard Seydou Ndiaye, who happened to have once been a goat herder in West Africa. It&apos;s still unclear where the goat came from, or how it ended up in Bed-Stuy, but at least we know it has ended up in a good place: Wilfred the goat has been taken to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151017092130/http://woodstocksanctuary.org/">Woodstock Farm Animal Sanctuary.</a></p>

<p>And based on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151017092130/https://www.facebook.com/WoodstockFarm">their Facebook updates</a>, it seems he&apos;s adjusting to his new living situation just fine: &quot;Wilfred is safe and warming up in his new place. Apart from [being] a bit thin the vet said he was in good shape so he has had a little snack and will be feasting on hay all night.&quot; After his capture early Thursday morning, the good folks at the Sanctuary mobilized pretty quickly to aid Wilfred (they heard about him on a 5:45 a.m. news broadcast)&#x2014;by 2 p.m. on Thursday, Wilfred was upstate at his new home. And now runaway goat <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151017092130/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRtvqT_wMeY">is never going back&#x2014;he&apos;s right way on a one way track</a>.</p>
