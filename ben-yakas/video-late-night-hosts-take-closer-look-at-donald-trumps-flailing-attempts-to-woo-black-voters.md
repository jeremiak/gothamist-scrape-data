<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161113152251/http://gothamist.com/tags/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> spent the holiday weekend <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161113152251/http://gothamist.com/2016/08/28/ny_times_takes_deep_dive_into_trump.php">once again</a> desperately trying to appeal to black voters who have, thus far, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161113152251/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/07/13/new-polls-in-pennsylvania-and-ohio-show-donald-trump-with-0-percent-of-the-black-vote/">overwhelmingly rejected him.</a> At meetings with community leaders in Philadelphia, a visit to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161113152251/http://www.bbc.com/news/election-us-2016-37267152">a black church in Detroit</a>, and various speeches in between, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161113152251/http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/trump-s-attempts-woo-black-voters-having-opposite-effect-n642331">he has been criticized</a> for his &quot;tone, broad generalizations and statistical bloating&quot; which have only driven more black voters away. But as Stephen Colbert pointed out, at least we got to witness Trump&apos;s signature dance move: &quot;Shift a little left, shift a little right, same thing he does with his immigration policy.&quot;</p>

<p>While Colbert talked to a Trump &quot;spokesperson&quot; about Trump&apos;s campaign scripting all his answers to a church interview, Seth Meyers did an even more extensive dive into Trump&apos;s botched pandering parade. Despite all the racist rhetoric and dog whistles to white supremacists, Trump thought he could &quot;overcome all that by going to a black church in Detroit, and awkwardly swaying back and forth like a dad who brought his kids to a Demi Lovato concert,&quot; Meyers said. &quot;Also I love how anytime Trump engages in even the slightest physical activity, he has to check to make sure his hair is still there.&quot;</p>

<p>And the Daily Show labelled Trump&apos;s charm offensive &quot;Orange Tries To Woo Black.&quot; As Trevor Noah put it, Trump only had three choices: &quot;Barbershops, Tyler Perry movies and black churches.&quot;</p>
