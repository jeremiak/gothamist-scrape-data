<p>We&apos;ve tackled the subject of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510001056/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/25/men_taking_up_room_on_the_subway.php">Male Leg Spreading</a> before, but never quite this wide: we don&apos;t think the gentleman in the photo above, who was spotted on a Brooklyn-bound C train this week, could possibly get any wider without dislocating a hip. He takes man sitting to the extreme, until it practically ventures into <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510001056/http://gothamist.com/2014/08/20/subway_yoga_nyc.php">subway yoga.</a> </p>

<p>But perhaps there is some logic behind his stance that mere straphangers and Gothamist writers can&apos;t glean from a single photo of a moment already lost to the sands of time. Perhaps he&apos;s just keeping the space warm for puppies.</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="82114wid6.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510001056im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/82114wid6.jpeg" width="640" height="621" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>Certainly it&apos;s enough room to fit in a lot of A-list celebrities.</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="82114wide5.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510001056im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/82114wide5.jpeg" width="640" height="621" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>Who are we kidding, it&apos;s enough room to fit in most of NYC.</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="82114wide3.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510001056im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/82114wide3.jpeg" width="640" height="854" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>We salute you, Wide Stance Guy. You are pushing the limits of acceptable leg spreading in society. You&apos;re shaking things up. You are large. You contain multitudes.</p>
