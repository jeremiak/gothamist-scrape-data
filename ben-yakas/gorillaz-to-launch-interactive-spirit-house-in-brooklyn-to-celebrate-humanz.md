<p>After over six years in the wilderness (also known as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170406154114/http://gothamist.com/2015/05/02/photos_video_blur_baptize_brooklyn.php#photo-1">reunion-ville</a>), Gorillaz will return with a new album, <em>Humanz</em>, later this month. To celebrate the release of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170406154114/https://genius.com/a/gorillaz-damon-albarn-explains-why-the-humanz-album-is-meant-for-2017">&quot;club record [with a] weird sort of darkness about it,&quot;</a> Damon Albarn and Jamie Hewlett&apos;s animated group is teaming up with Sonos to launch a series of &quot;spirit houses&quot; for fans to hear new music and interact with the band&apos;s virtual home.</p>

<p>According to a press release, these Gorillaz Spirit House spaces will include &quot;a real-life manifestation of Murdoc, 2D, Russel and Noodle&#x2019;s lounge in Gorillaz&#x2019; own home, offering fans the opportunity to dive deeper into their world through exclusive music and visuals through physical installations and projection mapping technology.&quot; The immersive experience will be brought to life visually and sonically with the new Sonos Playbase, which is their  home theater sound system, and is apparently &quot;incredibly thin,&quot; for what that is worth. </p>

<p>&quot;Come and bathe in high-tech sound, feast on unearthly visuals, and let the experience take you on the ultimate trip,&quot; songwriter and bassist Murdoc Niccals, a fictional animated rock star based on Keith Richards, &quot;said&quot; in the press release. </p>

<p>The event will launch in Williamsburg on April 21st-23rd <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170406154114/http://www.industrianyc.com/event-spaces/#/williamsburg/locations/39-south-5th-st-1426">in an event space</a> at 39 South 5th Street, then continue in Berlin (April 28th-30th) and Amsterdam (May 6th). Entry to the Brooklyn event is free, and fans can register to attend <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170406154114/http://www.sonos.com/en-us/gorillaz-spirit-house-rsvp">here</a>.</p>

<p>If you want to get more of a feel for the new album, Gorillaz have already released four singles from it (well, five if you count the previously-released anti-Trump ode <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170406154114/http://gothamist.com/2017/01/19/video_gorillaz_return_with_anti-tru.php">&quot;Hallelujah Money&quot;</a>). That includes &quot;Saturn Beatz,&quot; which gives you an idea of what kind of funky stuff you&apos;ll find in these spirit houses.</p>
