<p>Three women have been arrested for allegedly assaulting and robbing a woman outside a lesbian bar in the West Village, and then attacking and robbing a couple at a nearby PATH train station. According <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130908090120/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20130905/west-village/women-cuffed-for-assaults-at-lesbian-bar-path-station-police-say">to DNAInfo</a>, Cristal Mojica, 23, Samanthal Pena, 21, and Crystalin Vega, 24, have all been arraigned on felony charges of robbery, attempted robbery and gang assault for the two incidents, which both occurred early Sunday morning.</p>

<p>Cops say that a 24-year-old woman was standing outside <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130908090120/http://henriettahudson.com/">Henrietta Hudson</a> in the West Village around 3:45 a.m. when the three women allegedly took her cell phone. Bar bouncer Dot Katsia said the women denied they had the phone, and knocked her glasses off her face. &quot;You guys can kiss my ass,&quot; one of the women allegedly said as she mooned Henrietta Hudson workers and the alleged victim.</p>

<p>Then around 4 a.m., the women got into an argument with a 39-year-old woman and 45-year-old man in the Christopher Street PATH train station. The women allegedly punched the couple, and stole a Droid Razr phone (worth $550) and an Invicta watch (worth $500). They were caught shortly after by a cop at the scene.</p>
