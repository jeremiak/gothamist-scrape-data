<p>So instead of stress-eating and stress-refreshing the NYTimes, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161111112907/http://digg.com/video/plucking-beard-hairs">watch this guy</a> pluck his beard hairs out one at a time (no judgement!). Listen to an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161111112907/http://www.tastefullyoffensive.com/2016/11/an-acapella-cover-of-ducktales-theme.html">a capella version</a> of the <em>Duck Tales</em> theme song. Gaze at pictures of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161111112907/http://motherboard.vice.com/read/thousands-of-snowballs-on-this-siberian-beach-are-straight-from-a-fairy-tale">thousands of snowballs.</a></p>

<p>Or better yet, soothe your anxious psyche with some much-needed animal content. Below, let yourself fall into a hypnotic state with a 20 minute long video, taken by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161111112907/http://sailorbeware.com/">Amy Finkel</a>, of adorable dogs dressed up in adorable costumes at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161111112907/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/30/basket_of_adorables_and_more_brookl.php#photo-1">18th Annual Great PUPkin Dog Costume Contest</a>, which took place in Fort Greene Park last weekend. </p>

<p>And if you&apos;re still looking for something soothing but a little more politically-relevant, we recommend re-watching this ridiculously satisfying video on a loop for the next eight hours while results come in. Please let this laughing man be right.</p>
