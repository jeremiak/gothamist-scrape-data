<p>After the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130522143039/http://gothamist.com/tags/jets">Jets&apos;</a> emotional <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130522143039/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/16/jets_de-feet_pats.php">victory</a><a> over hated rivals the New England Patriots in the AFC Divisional Playoff this year, the victorious team was understandably running on adrenaline. But no one was more pumped than Jets linebacker Bart Scott, who ran over to ESPN reporter Sal Paolantonio for a post game interview in which he transformed into the Hulk, barking and memorably screaming the phrase &quot;Can&apos;t Wait!&quot; (You can see the video below) </a></p><a>

</a><p><a>Well, it turns out that the phrase was so popular, Scott has now trademarked it. &quot;It took on a life of its own. It really took off on ESPN, it took over on YouTube. My wife said, &apos;You should trademark it.&apos; Once I started to hear people were trying to make T-shirts, <strong>I said, &apos;I tell you what, if anybody is going to benefit off &apos;Can&apos;t Wait&apos;, it should be me,&apos; &quot;</strong> </a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130522143039/http://sports.espn.go.com/new-york/nfl/news/story?id=6181697">said Scott</a>, appearing as a guest at ESPN the Weekend in Florida. </p>

<p>This is the second Jets player to trademark a phrase, after cornerback Darelle Revis trademarked <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130522143039/http://gothamist.com/2010/01/22/manhattan_re-named_revis_island.php#photo-1">&quot;Revis Island&quot;</a> last year. We hope this trend continues with the rest of the Jets: Mark Sanchez could trademark his nickname &quot;Nacho,&quot; Rex Ryan could trademark <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130522143039/http://gothamist.com/tags/ihaveprettyfeet">&quot;ihaveprettyfeet,&quot;</a> and Antonio Cromartie could trademark <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130522143039/http://gothamist.com/tags/antoniocromartie">&quot;terrifyingly-virile.&quot;</a></p>
