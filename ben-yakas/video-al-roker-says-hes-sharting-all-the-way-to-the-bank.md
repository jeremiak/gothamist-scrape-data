<p>While nobody who uses the internet could possibly forget the significance of January 6th, 2013&#x2014;aka the day Al Roker admitted on television to &quot;sharting&quot; in the White House after he underwent gastric bypass surgery&#x2014;you might imagine that Roker is a little embarrassed about the whole incident. But as Roker <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160312221109/http://www.mediabistro.com/tvnewser/al-roker-on-his-white-house-accident-im-laughing-all-the-way-to-the-bank_b162475">told MediaBistro</a>, he&apos;s proud that he spoke out about his gastrointestinal problems&#x2014;if for no other reason than it has made him more money: &quot;At the end of the day, I have a NY Times best seller...so hey, you know what, I&apos;m laughing all the way to the bank.&quot;</p>

<p>That is only one of the <em>three</em> best parts of this brief interview. The other two: the fact that Roker pretends to not know what question the reporter is leading into when she says, &quot;and speaking of indigestion...&quot; And then there&apos;s his unique take on the interweb, and how things go viral due to a website and such: &#x201C;It wasn&#x2019;t until it was picked up by a website&#x2026;the story had been out there for three days, no big deal. But when you put it on a website, then all of a sudden, &apos;Oh whoa&apos;...It&apos;s where we are today.&#x201D; Indeed, it is where we are today.</p>

<p>Lest you want to revisit it, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160312221109/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/07/extra_extra_the_time_al_roker_admit.php">here&apos;s the original</a> interview:</p>

<p>In case you were wondering more about the medical reasons behind Roker&apos;s accident, Dr. Bipan Chand&#x2014;director of Loyola Center for Metabolic Surgery and Bariatric Care&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160312221109/http://www.upi.com/Health_News/2013/01/16/Doctor-explains-why-Al-Roker-pooped-pants/UPI-96321358316122/">gave UPI some insights</a> into the phenomenon known as &quot;dumping.&quot; Or, for the more juvenile amongst us, you can just watch a cartoon recreation of Roker&apos;s incident.</p>
