<p>We know a little something about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160523012215/http://gothamist.com/tags/timelapse">timelapses</a>&#x2014;and the one you can watch below is worth your time. &quot;I shot this film over 4 trips to NYC 2011-2012,&quot; explained photographer Samuel Orr. &quot;The time-lapse sequences you see here were made (mostly) from hundreds of thousands of still images.&quot; Those still images show people pouring over grassy hills, meandering under swaying trees, and splashing in emerald pools&#x2014;all much preferable to sped-up footage of people shivering in the waning sunlight and polishing off the next episode of <em><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160523012215/http://tlc.howstuffworks.com/tv/my-strange-addiction">My Strange Addiction</a></em> along with the bottle of cheap red. </p>

<p>But the video above is just a primer for what Orr really has in mind: a short film (20-25 minutes)&#x2014;made mostly of timelapse sequences&#x2014;that covers a year in the life of NYC. As he explains:</p>

<blockquote>I want to film ice flowing and thawing on area waterways, tidal flats in Jamaica Bay as Horseshoe crabs creep ashore, growing shifts of the forests along the Jersey Palisade and in Central Park, Fog and mist along the rivers, and of course all the seasonal events of the city itself (fireworks over the Hudson, marathons, parades, etc.). In addition, I plan to film sequences that involve the ever-changing nature of NYC, as local neighborhood businesses and landmarks (some unique in the &quot;only in NYC&quot; way) are increasingly priced out of their neighborhoods as the city gentrifies.  These sequences will remember the city that currently is, before &quot;progress&quot; renders much of beyond recognition.</blockquote>
