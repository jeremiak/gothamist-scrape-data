<p>Everyday, real estate hucksters-gone-mad are doing their best to bring their vision of a nightmare NYC packed with imaginary neighborhoods to fruition. The latest bullshit neighborhood to slip into Google Maps? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429074212/http://ny.curbed.com/archives/2012/12/06/rambo_appears_on_google_maps_is_it_now_legitimized.php">RAMBO</a>, or &quot;Right Around The Manhattan Bridge Overpass.&quot; And unlike <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429074212/http://gothamist.com/2012/11/23/apple_maps_is_trying_to_make_lodel.php">with LoDel</a>, this time even the nonsense neighborhood watchmen seem to be okay with it.</p>

<p>Made-up neighborhoods whistleblower Matthew Hyland, who was previously <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429074212/http://gothamist.com/2012/09/10/unpaid_workers_keep_google_maps_hon.php">able to put a stop to</a> &quot;Midtown South Central, told us he had not only come across this acronym before&#x2014;he actually approved it: &quot;A fellow reviewer really wanted it on there and made a convincing argument to keep it. I had originally erased it earlier in the year as I believe it was some kind of joke Curbed played for a stupid neighborhood name contest. It is only 2 by 2 blocks and so we left it without much argument.&quot; It must have been a very convincing argument, since <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429074212/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/10/nyregion/amateur-mapmakers-reshape-new-york-neighborhoods-online.html?_r=0">in a NY Times article on him</a> in September, Hyland noted that he nixed RAMBO because, &quot;I like my maps accurate.&quot;</p>

<p>RAMBO has been floating around <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429074212/http://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/new_york_city/entry/rambo_right_after_manhattan_bridge_overpass/">since 2007</a>, even though <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429074212/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAMBO,_Brooklyn">Wikipedia claims</a> the &quot;rarely used name&quot; was &quot;coined by Brooklyn resident Tony Hall in July 2011&quot; (for the record: we have email proof that Gothamist&apos;s own Jake Dobkin was using RAMBO in 2009). Looking at its <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429074212/http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=RAMBO,_Brooklyn&amp;action=history">Wiki history</a>, there&apos;s been A LOT of activity on the page over the last week, so the fact it is now Google-approved seems to have made an impact. But as Hyland put it, it IS a very tiny area, so perhaps we should let this go&#x2014;but it&apos;s the principle, damnit! Although, perhaps we could somehow use RAMBO as a stepping stone to make <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429074212/https://twitter.com/garthj">Garth Johnston&apos;s</a> dreams of HoBro (centered around the Houston and Broadway location of Hollister) come true.</p>
