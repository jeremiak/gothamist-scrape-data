<p>Earlier <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427134932/http://gothamist.com/2014/06/21/extra_extra_2944.php">this month</a>, a three-unit penthouse combo at The Ritz-Carlton in Battery Park was listed for a mind-boggling $118.5 million, making it the most expensive penthouse listing in NYC. But what exactly do you get for $118.5 million? Find out with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427134932/http://www.nbcnews.com/business/real-estate/nice-shack-exclusive-look-inside-nycs-118m-penthouse-n142611">the CNBC video tour below</a>, since this is almost certainly the closest you&apos;ll ever come to stepping inside this place.</p>

<p>As <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427134932/http://ny.curbed.com/archives/2014/06/20/1185m_ritzcarlton_combo_to_be_nycs_priciest_listing.php">Curbed points out</a>, the three units&#x2014;which are all located on the top two floors of the 40 floor building&#x2014; take up 15,434 square feet of interior space altogether, with 2,193 square feet of terraces; the asking price works out to about $7,600 per square foot. </p>

<p>&quot;This apartment was going to turn heads no matter what we priced it at,&quot; said real estate broker Ryan Serhant. &quot;Just because of the sheer size, the views, because of the finishes and because of what we are offering and because that&apos;s part of my job, as a real estate broker.&quot;</p>

<p>If this is all seems a bit extravagant for your tastes, there&apos;s plenty of other bargains in the city&#x2014;like the $30-60 million apartments that are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427134932/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/29/realestate/manhattan-luxury-high-rise-gets-its-first-residents.html?_r=1">starting to be bought up</a> in the 90-story skyscraper <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427134932/http://gothamist.com/tags/one57">One57</a> on Billionaire&apos;s Row. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427134932/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/04/invisible_billionaires_find_new_yor.php">It&apos;s a bargain!</a></p>
