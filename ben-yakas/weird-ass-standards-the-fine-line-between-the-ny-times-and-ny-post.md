<p>Earlier this week, Mayor Bloomberg <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150222064606/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/28/look_at_the_ass_on_her_stuff_bloomb.php">inadvertently hijacked</a> Christine Quinn&apos;s <em>New York</em> magazine cover story with this tossed-off quote about another woman: &quot;Look at the ass on her.&quot; And that possibly sexist, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150222064606/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/29/bloombergs_ass_appreciation_chalked.php">inappropriately funny</a> comment overshadowed the rest of the piece, a glorified celebrity puff profile meant to make Quinn look like a glam mayoral frontrunner. Bloomberg was finally available for reporters&apos; questioning yesterday, denying it ever happened&#x2014;but in reporting the followup story, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150222064606/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/01/nyregion/bloomberg-denies-commenting-on-womans-derriere.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;_r=0">the NY Times revealed</a> the limitations of its own vocabulary: they&apos;re terrified of the word &quot;ass.&quot;</p>

<p>It&apos;s reasonable enough that they substitute &quot;Woman&#x2019;s Derri&#xE8;re&quot; into the headline, but as you read the article, all you find are watered-down substitutions such as &quot;a woman&#x2019;s attractive backside.&quot; The worst part is that the Times can&apos;t even QUOTE the original comment&#x2014;so if you were reading about this story for the first time, you may not have any clue exactly what Bloomberg said, or what the <em>big</em> deal is. The mayor may be someone who doesn&apos;t &quot;mince words,&quot; but it seems they are when it comes to Bloomberg&apos;s transformation <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150222064606/http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=uuwCrQRoYwc">into Larry David.</a></p>

<p>At the same time, our <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150222064606/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/10/get_used_to_stock_market_volatility.php">hooker</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150222064606/http://gothamist.com/2011/07/02/ny_post_dominique_strauss-kahns_acc.php#photo-1">obsessed</a> friends over at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150222064606/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/mayor_rebutts_derri_err_NGXoaOC6IFZBCH3xFMHRmM?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Local">NY Post</a> and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150222064606/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/bloomberg-denies-checking-ass-article-1.1252190">Daily News</a> had absolutely no problem getting down and dirty in the derri&#xE8;re: both include the original quote within the first two grafs and both include the VERY CLEVER pun &quot;assinine.&quot; The Post also throws in &quot;rear end&quot; in the headline, but the Daily News actually trumped them this time with this crystalline copy:</p>

<blockquote>Days after a magazine reporter claimed he saw the mayor admire a woman in a tight floor-length gown and urge fellow party-goers to &#x201C;Look at the ass on her,&#x201D; Bloomberg blasted the ass tale as ass-inine.</blockquote> 

<p>Oh sure, you could argue that the dailies don&apos;t abide by the same standards as the Times&#x2014;what&apos;s wrong with the NY Times being a bit precious <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150222064606/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/20/lets_count_the_ways_the_times_avoid.php">about naughty words</a>, right? After all, it is a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150222064606/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/26/ny_times_a_bad_credit_score_is_like.php">very serious</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150222064606/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/12/ny_times_asks_should_we_report_the.php">paper</a> that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150222064606/http://gothamist.com/2012/11/18/ny_times_trys_on_thought_catalogue.php">only</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150222064606/http://gothamist.com/2012/08/30/if_you_dont_have_a_chandelier_in_yo.php">publishes</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150222064606/http://gothamist.com/2011/07/25/more_rich_kids_are_flying_private_p.php">very serious</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150222064606/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/19/youre_not_rich_enough_to_read_the_n.php">articles</a> on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150222064606/http://gothamist.com/2010/12/09/if_you_dont_hire_a_bartender_for_yo.php">very serious subjects.</a></p>
