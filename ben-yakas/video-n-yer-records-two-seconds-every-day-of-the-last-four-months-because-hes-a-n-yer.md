<p>In Greek, &quot;nostalgia&quot; literally means &quot;the pain from an old wound.&quot; It&apos;s a twinge in your heart far more powerful than memory alone. A timelapse video isn&apos;t a spaceship&#x2014;it&apos;s a time machine. Ad man <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130607143851/http://www.youtube.com/user/sdrawkcabton88?feature=watch">Dan Toth</a> understands this, probably because he&apos;s seen <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130607143851/http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=suRDUFpsHus">the same <em>Mad Men</em> episode as we have</a>. Sometimes you want to go to a place where you know you are loved. Sometimes you want to go to a place where you can see two seconds of every day of the last four months, because you want, no, <em>need</em> to relive those moments when you played a lot of dodgeball and washed your cat. </p>
