<p>TLC&apos;s hit documentary on ridiculously bad parenting, <em>Toddlers and Tiaras</em>, took the leap from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130729174251/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/09/15/eden-wood-kelly-bensimon_n_964716.html?ref=mostpopular">the small screen to Fashion Week</a> yesterday. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130729174251/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/15/real_housewives_casting_bloodbath_t.php">Former</a> <em>Real Housewives of New York</em> person Kelly Bensimon hosted the &#x201C;Cowgirl Riders Debutante Fashion Show&#x201D; for a bunch of too-innocent-to-understand-how-terrible-their-parents-are six-year-olds in the basement of the Bryant Park Hotel. The headliner of the show was Eden Wood, the breakout star of the TLC freakshow who left the program to pursue <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130729174251/http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20528728,00.html">other equally-sad opportunities</a>. Watch some totally age-appropriate video of her slapping her butt at the event below!</p>

<p>Bensimon defended the Wood&apos;s pageantry after the show <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130729174251/http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2011/09/15/kelly-bensimon-denies-that-she-s-fired-from-real-housewives-eden-wood-on-teeth-whitening.html">to The Daily Beast</a>, who called it &quot;the best fashion show of the week:&quot; &#x201C;That wasn&#x2019;t stripping. That was just her having a little fun, girly moment.&quot; Not that she would necessarily let <em>her</em> kids shake their tutus: &#x201C;I didn&#x2019;t want to push my kids into something they didn&#x2019;t feel good about. But these kids were feeling good about it. And they walked away happy.&quot;</p>
