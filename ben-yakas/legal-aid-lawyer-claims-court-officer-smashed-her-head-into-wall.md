Lawyer Elana Silberman, who has worked for Legal Aid Society since 1989, and witnesses <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130510145341/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/court-officer-smashed-head-wall-lawyer-article-1.1297419">told the News that</a> court officer Babul Miah became enraged at her on March 14 for seemingly little reason. &#x201C;What happened was unbelievable,&#x201D; Silberman told them. &#x201C;This has never happened to me before.&#x201D;<p></p>

<p>Silberman, 50, said she had approached the bench and was talking to another prosecutor on the other side of the rail during a hearing that day. As they discussed a separate case, Miah told her she had to pipe down and take a seat, even though there were other lawyers standing and talking nearby. &#x201C;For reasons I cannot explain, this officer started to get belligerent with Elana,&#x201D; said one witness, who asked not to be identified. &#x201C;She wasn&#x2019;t doing anything wrong.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Miah then screamed at her and demanded she leave the courtroom. &#x201C;He was shouting at her from literally a foot behind,&#x201D; another witness in the packed courtroom told the News. &#x201C;He was trying to embarrass her.&#x201D; Silberman says he violently shoved her from behind as she exited the courtroom, causing her to hit her head against a wall. Silberman was then cuffed and kept in custody for about 90 minutes; she was eventually released without being charged, and taken to the hospital where doctors told her she had suffered a concussion.</p>

<p>&#x201C;We are extremely concerned about our lawyer and how she was treated,&#x201D; said Steven Banks, the Legal Aid Society&#x2019;s attorney-in-chief. &#x201C;The condition and safety of our entire staff is of great concern to us.&#x201D; A court spokesman said, &#x201C;we are trying to determine exactly what transpired&#x201D; during the &quot;unfortunate incident.&quot; At least one fellow Bronx court officer praised Miah: &#x201C;He&#x2019;s a stand-up guy,&#x201D; the officer told the News. &#x201C;And he&#x2019;s kind of a hero around here now.&#x201D;</p>
