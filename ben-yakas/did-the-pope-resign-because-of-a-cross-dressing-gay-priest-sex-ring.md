<p>When Pope Benedict XVI <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160501175317/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/11/pope_benedict_will_resign_for_healt.php">announced earlier this month</a> that he would resign on February 28th, there was a lot of shock and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160501175317/http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/02/15/conspiracy-theories-why-did-the-pope-really-quit.html">confusion</a> around the world. Was he dying? Was he fed up with the responsibilities of being pope? Was he pushed out? Or was there some scandal behind-the-scenes? According to a report in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160501175317/http://www.repubblica.it/esteri/2013/02/21/news/ricatti_vaticano-53080655/?ref=DRL-1">La Repubblica</a>, there was <em>quite</em> a scandal: they allege the Pope resigned in part because of a report which claims gay Vatican prelates are being blackmailed by a network of male prostitutes.</p>

<p>The paper <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160501175317/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/pope-resignation-linked-gay-conclave-report-article-1.1271328">alleges that the Pope</a> was handed the 300-page dossier, which was compiled by three cardinals investigating the theft of Vatican documents by the Pope&apos;s former butler, on Dec. 17, the same day he decided to resign. The report details various gay priests who had sexual encounters with male prostitutes in &quot;a villa outside the Italian capital, a sauna in a Rome suburb, a beauty parlour in the centre, and a former university residence that was in use by a provincial Italian archbishop.&quot; The report also included compromising photos and video, including some of the priests filmed in drag and others caught &#x201C;in the act.&#x201D;</p>

<p>&#x201C;Everything revolves around the nonobservance of the Sixth and Seventh Commandments,&#x201D; a source close to the cardinals who prepared the report told La Repubblica. The Sixth Commandment, &#x201C;Thou shall not commit adultery,&#x201D; is used by the Vatican to refer to homosexuality rather than infidelity.</p>

<p>&#x201C;What&#x2019;s coming out is very detailed X-ray of the Roman Curia that does not spare even the closest collaborators of the Pope,&#x201D; wrote respected Vatican expert Ignazio Ingrao in Panorama, as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160501175317/http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/02/22/priests-in-panties.html">reported by The Daily Beast</a>. &#x201C;The Pope was no stranger to the intrigues, but he probably did not know that under his pontificate there was such a complex network and such intricate chains of personal interests and unmentionable relationships.&#x201D;</p>

<p>The Daily Beast adds that much of this information couldn&apos;t have been too much of a surprise&#x2014;In 2010, investigative journalist Carmello Abbate caught some priests on hidden camera &quot;dirty dancing at private parties and engaging in sex acts with male escorts on church property.&quot; He wrote an expos&#xE9; about it called, &#x201C;Good Nights Out for Gay Priests,&#x201D; and a subsequent book, <em>Sex and the Vatican.</em> Which has led some to wonder what <em>else</em> could be in that 300-page dossier.</p>

<p>Journalist David Gibson, who wrote a biography on Pope Benedict XVI, weighed in on the story <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160501175317/http://davidgibson.religionnews.com/2013/02/22/did-gays-in-the-vatican-drive-benedict-out/">on his blog</a>, and doubted that this scandal was the major factor in the Pope&apos;s resignation: &quot;For one thing, Benedict&#x2019;s resignation was most certainly the result of numerous factors, mainly revolving around the internal problems of the Vatican, of which sexual shenanigans were likely one &#x2014; but hardly the only one, or even the principal one.&quot; Fellow National Catholic Reporter John L. Allen <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160501175317/http://ncronline.org/blogs/ncr-today/thoughts-vaticans-gay-lobby">agreed</a>: &quot;No, Benedict didn&#x2019;t quit under the pressure of a &#x201C;gay lobby.&#x201D; But the perceived disarray in the Vatican, which may well be one part perception and one part reality, probably made resignation look even better.&quot;<br>
 <br>
The Vatican secretariat of state <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160501175317/http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/feb/23/vatican-pope-gay-conclave-reports">issued this statement</a> about the report: &quot;It is deplorable that as we draw closer to the time of the beginning of the conclave &#x2026; that there be a widespread distribution of often unverified, unverifiable or completely false news stories that cause serious damage to persons and institutions.&quot;</p>
