<p>Because of the holiday weekend, we have to wait another agonizing week to see the Red Viper &amp; The Mountain battle it out and decide Tyrion&apos;s fate in the next episode of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504194837/http://gothamist.com/tags/gameofthrones"><em>Game Of Thrones</em>.</a> While we won&apos;t get any Power Rankings this week, we get something just as good (and twice as high): Seth Rogen and Snoop Dogg smoking marijuana and recapping GOT. And it turns out Snoop does a pretty solid Littlefinger impression!</p>

<p>So many questions: did Snoop binge watch GOT in a night? What are &quot;cyclops tears?&quot; Who chose that CGI background? Do the Unsullied lose their testicles AND their penises, or just the former? And most importantly, why hasn&apos;t HBO immediately green lit a <em>Talking Dead</em>-esque GOT recap show with Snoop for crissakes? </p>
