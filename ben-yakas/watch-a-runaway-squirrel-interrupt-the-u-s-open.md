<p>A curious (or more likely, absolutely confused) squirrel interrupted the tennis match between Sabine Lisicki and Vera Dushevina at day 1 of the 2013 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504072155/http://gothamist.com/tags/usopen">U.S. Open</a> this week. Was this the same squirrel who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504072155/http://gothamist.com/2012/08/30/video_squirrel_steals_the_show_at_u.php">interrupted the Open last year</a>? Or was this the <em>ghost</em> of that squirrel, back to haunt all the polo shirt-wearing gawkers who desecrated his gravesite?</p>
