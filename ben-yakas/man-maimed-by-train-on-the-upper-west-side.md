<p>A man was struck by a train on the Upper West Side last night. According to police, the incident happened around 1 a.m. just as the train was arriving at Central Park West and 96th Street. The man was struck by a northbound A train; he was taken to St. Luke&apos;s Hospital in serious condition.</p>

<p>Police said he was likely to survive, but he suffered serious leg injuries that would likely require amputation. It&apos;s unclear what precipitated the incident, but no criminality is suspected.</p>
