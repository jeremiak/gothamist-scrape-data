<p>It seems somebody in Long Island has been taking <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130411001838/http://quotationsbook.com/quote/22550/">James Thurber</a> a bit too seriously&#x2014;a disabled man has been hit with two summonses for laughing too loudly in his own home after a neighbor complained to cops about it. &#x201C;I didn&#x2019;t know it was a crime to laugh out a window,&#x201D; Robert Schiavelli, who has frequent seizures and suffers from neurological impairments, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130411001838/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/it_laughable_sEXykGNgabFDCNlGvdXuBK">told the Post</a>. Hmm, if that neighbor turns out to be Mayor Bloomberg, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130411001838/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/06/bloomberg_war_on_headphones.php">this could explain some stuff.</a></p>

<p>The 42-year-old Schiavelli, who lives with his mother, was given the tickets for &#x201C;disturbing the peace&#x201D; at 6 p.m. on Feb. 12 and 13. He has been charged with acting &#x201C;in such a manner as to annoy, disturb, interfere with, obstruct, or be offensive to others.&#x201D; Schiavelli and his mother claim that the neighbor, Daniel O&#x2019;Hanian, regularly taunts and ridicules Schiavelli about his disability. &#x201C;He tries to intimidate Robert&#x201D; by calling him &#x201C;a retard&#x2019;&#x2019; said 65-year mom Suzanne, who added her son &#x201C;has learned to laugh at him.&#x201D;</p>

<p>O&#x2019;Hanian&#x2019;s wife, Virginia, defended the summonses to the Post: &#x201C;The police investigated and found there was cause. I think the police can answer all your questions. I think the police did what they thought was best.&#x201D; Each ticket carries with it a $250 penalty, or 15 days in jail. Schiavelli&apos;s lawyer Andrew Campanelli was incensed: &#x201C;It&#x2019;s absurd. My client faces 30 days in jail for laughing,&quot; he said. &#x201C;The last time I checked, it was not a crime to laugh &#x2014; except in Rockville Centre.&quot;</p>

<p>As for whether Schiavelli has a Fran Drescher-esque laugh, his mother doesn&apos;t seem to think so: &#x201C;It&#x2019;s an infectious, cute laugh, I love it. It makes me want to laugh,&#x201D; she <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130411001838/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2013/03/06/rockville-centre-man-gets-summonses-for-laughing-too-loudly/">told CBS.</a></p>
