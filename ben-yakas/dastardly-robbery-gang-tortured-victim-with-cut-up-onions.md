<p>Police say that Mejia and the robbery crew would dress up as cops, then conduct a police-style car stop of a drug supplier, brandishing fake badges and using a vehicle outfitted with police lights. In one particular incident, they kidnapped the victim, drove to a trailer home where they tied him up, along with a woman and child, then tortured him with onions: &quot;<strong>The crew placed a bag of onions over the head of one of the male victims to induce him to reveal the location of narcotics. The bag filled with cut-up onions caused the victim to experience a form of asphyxiation</strong>,&quot; said NYPD Detective Therone Eugene of the Drug Enforcement Administration&apos;s Redrum Task Force. Another onion-torture home invasion in Georgia yielded 77 pounds of cocaine and $100,000 in cash.</p>

<p>In addition to the onion ploy, the crew also performed &quot;classic&quot; styles of torture, including &quot;beatings, burning with a hot iron, submerging victims heads in water, and squeezing their testicles with pliers.&quot; The alleged ringleader of the group is 300-pound Franklin De Vargas, who was responsible for more than 100 robberies in NYC, Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Georgia.</p>
