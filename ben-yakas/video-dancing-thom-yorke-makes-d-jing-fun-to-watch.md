<p>Groovy dance freak <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604123041/http://gothamist.com/tags/thomyorke">Thom Yorke</a> and musical soul-mate Nigel Godrich swung by Le Poisson Rouge earlier this month for a DJ set behind Atoms For Peace&apos;s debut album, <em>AMOK</em>. The set, which featured new songs and ones from Yorke&apos;s first solo album <em>The Eraser</em>, was just a taster for the band&apos;s full lineup tour coming later this year. But when you&apos;ve got Yorke in full-ponytail mode contorting his face into a million beautiful twitches, it&apos;s still wildly entertaining.</p>

<p>&quot;Originally, we were just going to DJ and not play any of our shit...Then we got carried away,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604123041/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/videos/atoms-for-peace-spin-default-during-new-york-dj-set-20130328">Yorke told Rolling Stone</a> before the March 14th show. &quot;We&apos;ve basically just cut everything up into its constituent parts. We&apos;ll try to re-cut the tunes live, mixing in loads of other bits and pieces and collaging stuff together.&quot; </p>

<p>Above, watch Yorke and Godrich twitch out and perform &quot;Default&quot; from <em>AMOK</em> with a backdrop of visuals by artist Tarik Barri. Oh sure, he may look a bit like a weird European uncle with his Nirvana-aping t-shirt and up-all-night scruff, but videos like this are yet another reminder to let Yorke be Yorke and just enjoy his merry weirdness.</p>
