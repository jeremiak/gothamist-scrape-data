<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:250px; "> <img alt="41011mobwives.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120603051657im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/41011mobwives.jpeg" width="250" height="250"> <br> <i>The lovely ladies of the new VH1 series &quot;Mob Wives&quot;</i></div> Mobsters can often be quite charming in the movies, but it seems that they&apos;re not nearly as persuasive in real life: several Brooklyn federal judges are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120603051657/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/the_mob/2011/04/10/2011-04-10_not_biting_on_bizarre_bail_pleas_from_mob.html">at their wits end</a> with alleged mobsters and mafia associates bizarre (or entitled) bail requests. Reputed Genovese associate Peter Pace recently complained that his electronic bracelet doesn&apos;t allow him to stroll on his outdoor patio or garden in his backyard. <strong>&quot;Move your tomatoes inside. I don&apos;t want to be bothered with this,</strong>&quot; Judge John Gleeson responded.<p></p>

<p>Reputed Gambino associate Emmanuel Garofalo told a Judge he needed to fly down to Florida to attend traffic school, to complete a four-hour course by May 1, or he would lose his license there. The Judge was unsurprisingly unmoved. Reputed Bonanno associate Neil Messina won his release on $3.1 million bail...and then tried to switch his brother&apos;s bail posting of $200,000 connected to a property with $200,000 in penny stocks. Maybe mobsters just have a better time of it in jail, where they can get perks such as their own <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120603051657/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/02/mobsters_now_get_ipods_to_listen_to.php">specifically-tailored iPod.</a></p>

<p>But even if the mobsters on bail aren&apos;t charming, at least they don&apos;t have their own reality show documenting their every charmless move. But some of their wives and daughters do!  After months of <strike>anticipation</strike> dread, the Post got a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120603051657/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/staten_island/staten_island_tv_mob_scene_9kY7j8d22uNssZ08eoCEHO?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">sneak peek</a> at the new VH1 reality series &quot;Mob Wives,&quot; which features <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120603051657/http://gothamist.com/2010/12/22/new_reality_show_to_tackle_married.php">Karen Gravano</a>, daughter of Sammy &quot;Bull&quot; Gravano, and three other Richmond County mob ladies. </p>

<p>Among the choice dialogue is this gem from the &quot;hulking&quot; Renee Graziano, daughter of Anthony &quot;The Little Guy&quot; Graziano, reputed consigliere of the Bonanno crime family: &quot;A rat is someone who doesn&apos;t mind their f--king business and gets involved with the cop. If you&apos;re a rat, you&apos;re not in my circle. Matter of fact, I&apos;ll make your life so f--king miserable you won&apos;t be able to hang out in anybody&apos;s circle. <strong>That&apos;s me, bitch. Call me a Mafia princess, call me anything you want.</strong>&quot;</p>
