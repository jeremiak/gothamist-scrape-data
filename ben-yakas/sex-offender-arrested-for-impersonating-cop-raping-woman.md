<p>A serial sex offender has been arrested for brutally beating, raping, and robbing a woman while impersonating a cop this week. Jason Forgetta, a 37-year-old Level 3 Sex Offender, met the 26-year-old woman outside a Sunset Park hotel early Wednesday, showing her a gold badge and identifying himself as a police officer. </p>

<p>Cops say she invited him to her room, where he repeatedly punched her in the face, raped and sodomized her. He stole her cell phone, cash and pocketbook before leaving. The woman was able to follow him downstairs and get his license plate numbers; cops caught up to him in Bensonhurst, where they found the fake badge in the car.</p>

<p>Forgetta, a deliveryman for a catering company,  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141119062357/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/ex-con-posed-busted-brooklyn-rape-article-1.1889304">has been charged</a> with rape, robbery and criminal impersonation charges. Cops adds that Forgetta has a long criminal history, including arrests on charges of robbery, car theft and driving with a suspended license. In 2002, he spent a year and three months in prison after he was convicted for raping and punching a woman. </p>

<p>The News adds he also allegedly molested a 15-year-old girl in Williamsburg after being released from prison, and was accused of molesting a 7-year-old girl in 2007. </p>
