title: High School Teacher Discovers Double Stuf Oreos Aren't Really Double Stuffed

<p>After the invention of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427162028/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/27/video_behold_the_worlds_greatest_or.php">Oreo cream-separating contraption</a>, we wept for there were no more worlds to conquer and mankind had finally become master of the Oreo. But a grave and serious conspiracy is now undermining all that progress: an upstate New York high school teacher and his students claim that the Double Stuf Oreo is not actually double stuffed.</p>

<p>Dan Anderson, who teaches a &#x201C;Consumer Math&#x201D; course at a high school in Queensbury, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427162028/http://consumerist.com/2013/08/20/high-school-students-blow-the-lid-off-oreos-double-stuf-theres-only-1-86-times-the-stuf/">tasked his students</a> this past semester with determining whether Nabisco&#x2019;s Double Stuf and Mega Stuf Oreos really are double and mega stuffed. And what they discovered will frighten you: <strong>Double Stuf Oreos were 1.86 times the size of regular Oreos, and the Mega Oreos were 2.68 times the size of regular Oreos.</strong></p>

<p>You can peruse all the experiments that went into the math on Anderson&apos;s blog <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427162028/http://blog.recursiveprocess.com/2013/03/03/oreo-original-vs-double-vs-mega/">here</a>&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427162028/http://blog.recursiveprocess.com/2013/08/20/oreo-verification/">he also verified his work this week</a> after it started getting attention. &quot;After all the attention (I feel really weird about it), the math part of my brain had to verify the findings,&quot; he wrote. &quot;And after all, I&#x2019;d hate to be wrong on the internet.&quot;</p>

<p>Nabisco strenuously defended their stuffing procedures <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427162028/http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/lifestyle/2013/08/double-stuf-oreos-not-all-theyre-stuffed-up-to-be/">to ABC</a>: &#x201C;While I&#x2019;m not familiar with what was done in the classroom setting, I can confirm for you that our recipe for the Oreo Double Stuf Cookie has double the Stuf, or creme filling, when compared with our base, or original Oreo cookie,&#x201D; a spokeswoman said. Hopefully they&apos;ll seek to correct the error soon before this becomes<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427162028/http://gothamist.com/tags/footlong">another Subway footlong sandwich debacle</a> and they break Patrick Stewart&apos;s heart.</p>
