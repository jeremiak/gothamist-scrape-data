<p>An intoxicated man had his leg amputated after he was struck by a train in Queens early this morning. Police say the incident happened around 4:40 a.m. at the 65th Street E/M/R Station in Queens, and that an intoxicated 26-year-old man apparently went onto the tracks to &quot;sleep it off&quot;&#x2014;he climbed into the gap underneath the platform, in particular. He let his leg stretch out, and it was hit by an E train.</p>

<p>The man was taken to Elmhurst Hospital, where he is in stable condition and expected to live. Police add that the victim is from New Jersey, and not believed to be homeless. Police say no one was around him, and the train didn&apos;t see him in time to stop; they called it an &quot;unfortunate accident.&quot;</p>

<p>This latest subway incident comes less than a day after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150528005757/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/19/two_people_killed_another_hurt_in_t.php">two people were killed, and another was injured</a>, by trains in Manhattan and The Bronx. A fourth potential train death <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150528005757/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/19/subway_hero_saved_elderly_man_from.php">was averted thanks to a subway hero</a> in Manhattan as well. And on New Year&apos;s Day, a woman who had attended the Phish New Year&apos;s show as well as a Disco Biscuits concert <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150528005757/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/04/woman_passed_out_on_subway_tracks_a.php">was killed by a train after passing out </a>on the 2/3 train tracks at 34th Street/Penn Station.</p>
