<p>A man has been hospitalized after he was shot in the face by a woman on a bicycle in Brooklyn&#x2014;and police believe the man was not the intended target of the attack.</p>

<p>Cops say the incident happened around 8 p.m. Thursday in front of a building on Montauk Avenue near New Lots Avenue in East New York. Victim Nelson Rivera, 28, was standing there with an unidentified friend when they had an argument with the suspect. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110103755/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/exclusive-woman-bicycle-shoots-man-brooklyn-argument-article-1.2814613">According to the News</a>, Rivera told cops that he turned away and stepped into the lobby as she biked away; she then allegedly came back around, shot him once in the cheek, and fled the scene.</p>

<p>Rivera was taken to Brookdale Hospital in stable condition, and is expected to survive. </p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110103755/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/exclusive-woman-bicycle-shoots-man-brooklyn-argument-article-1.2814613">the News</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110103755/http://nypost.com/2016/10/02/woman-shoots-wrong-man-in-the-face-when-aiming-for-ex/">the Post</a>, witnesses told cops that the suspect was the former girlfriend of Rivera&#x2019;s buddy, who was likely the intended target.</p>

<p>Cops have not released the suspect&apos;s name, but they told the News she has been arrested six previous times. Police add that the investigation is ongoing.</p>
