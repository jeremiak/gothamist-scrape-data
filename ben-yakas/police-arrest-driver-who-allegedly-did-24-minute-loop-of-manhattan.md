<p>Last week, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429165125/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/30/video_driver_claims_record_for_fast.php">a driver released a video claiming</a> he had set the record for the fastest loop around Manhattan. The driver, only identified by the name AfroDuck, went from the FDR Drive around to the Henry Hudson Parkway and back in 24 minutes. Cops <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429165125/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/04/police_investigating_driver_who_did.php">vowed to catch him</a>, and now they believe they have: Christopher Tang, 30, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429165125/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2013/09/06/police-driver-who-posted-record-breaking-speed-lap-around-manhattan-arrested/">has been charged</a> with reckless endangerment, reckless driving, speed violation and traffic device violation for the drive. </p>

<p>&quot;I&apos;ll comment later,&quot; Tang, an East Harlem resident, told reporters while being led away in handcuffs. Cops also impounded his British Columbia-registered blue BMW Z4, which he allegedly drove during the Manhattan lap (you can see <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429165125/http://jalopnik.com/source-says-police-have-arrested-manhattan-speeder-afro-1253640248">a photo of it here</a>).</p>

<p>AfroDuck bragged last week that he wasn&apos;t worried about being caught: &quot;You frankly can&apos;t identify who I am by just looking at the video and records were meant to be broken. I&apos;ll release my name a year from now,&quot; he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429165125/http://jalopnik.com/driver-claims-new-record-for-fastest-lap-around-manhatt-1220993047">told Jalopnik.</a></p>
