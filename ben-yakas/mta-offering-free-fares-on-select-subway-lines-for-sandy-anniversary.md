<p>It looks like that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429152213/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/29/fare_hike.php">$1.9 billion surplus</a> is finally paying dividends: the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429152213/http://gothamist.com/tags/mta">MTA</a> tweeted today that select subway lines will be free on Tuesday to commemorate the one year anniversary of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429152213/http://gothamist.com/tags/hurricanesandy">Hurricane Sandy</a>. According to the MTA, A trains in Rockaways/Howard Beach and R trains in Brooklyn will be free all day. We&apos;ve contacted the MTA for more details about the anniversary fare suspension, and will update when we learn more.</p>
