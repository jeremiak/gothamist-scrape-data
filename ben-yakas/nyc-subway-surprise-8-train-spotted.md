<p>We received a tip today that people had seen a mysterious 8 train roaming through the tunnels of Manhattan, and found the above picture along with this post <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427122552/http://www.reddit.com/r/nyc/comments/ioo7x/8_train/">on Reddit</a>: &quot;A friend of mine grabbed this shot of one of the cars on the 7 train. Can anyone explain this?&quot; Considering that the 8 train hasn&apos;t been in service <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427122552/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8_%28New_York_City_Subway_service%29">since the 1970s</a>, we were curious as well, so we spoke to a representative from the MTA who gave us the low-down on the error: </p>

<p>&quot;Just a mistake.  Signs come with numbers that we don&#x2019;t use like 8 and 9 in case we should ever want to use them. It was probably turned to 8 inadvertently in the yard,&quot; the MTA rep told us. As others surmised, the 8 is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427122552/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unused_New_York_City_Subway_service_labels">a remnant of</a> an older subway rollsign mechanism that happened to be on display&#x2014;in addition to the 8, IRT also has a 10 and 12 in its current rollsigns. However, there have also been rumors that the 8 has been a proposed re-designation of the express 6. So we may very well have an 8 train in the future!</p>
