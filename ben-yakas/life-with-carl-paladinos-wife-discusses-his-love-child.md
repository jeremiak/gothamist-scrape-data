We&apos;ve also learned that Carl Paladino&apos;s wife, Cathy, is a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160728163721/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/23/carl_paladinos_wife_is_a_democrat.php">registered Democrat</a> who&apos;s had a complicated relationship with her husband: not only did he have a love child with his mistress, but he told his wife about it the same week that his son Patrick was killed in a car accident. But she&apos;s ok <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160728163721/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/many_heartaches_of_mrs_paladino_RZHG4hAerxq49GIW1vrr2N/1">with all that</a>: &quot;...my first thought was, <strong>&apos;How lucky. Every child&apos;s a gift.&apos; </strong>That was my thought. I wasn&apos;t angry, you know. I can deal with one family crisis at a time. But to multi-task...It&apos;s not that important.&quot; </p>

<p>The personal back story between Paladino and his wife has been a compelling storyline every since Paladino <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160728163721/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/05/paladino_to_announce_ny_gov_candida.php">first stepped into the race</a> last spring. Neither spouse has shyed away from talking about the their baggage: &#x201C;Everybody knows anyway. And they should know. They should know the background of people, and they should know that it doesn&#x2019;t matter how much money you have, how rich you are&#x2014;things happen. And you deal with them and move on. Every family has problems, &quot; she <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160728163721/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/25/nyregion/25bigcity.html?_r=2&amp;partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">told the Times</a>. Not that she had too much of a choice in the publicity the campaign brought; &quot;[Paladino&apos;s campaign staff] had three words for me: <strong>&apos;Get over it,&apos;</strong> &quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160728163721/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/many_heartaches_of_mrs_paladino_RZHG4hAerxq49GIW1vrr2N/0">she told The Post</a>. </p>

<p>The child, Sarah, is now a fully integrated part of her family Cathy says, and she&apos;s comfortable enough with the situation that she did not object when Carl traveled to Italy last year with Sarah and Sarah&apos;s mother Suzanne Brady (who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160728163721/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/baby_mama_with_carl_knowledge_bCzDEJy1WMhzAUgPbddqAP?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">calls Paladino</a> &quot;a great guy.&quot;). Her pragmatism extends as far back as her first meeting with Paladino in college, when he insulted her on their first date. Their lives remain just as complicated now; with him on the campaign trail and her remaining at home in Buffalo, they don&apos;t see or speak to each other for days at a time: &#x201C;I have a life,&#x201D; she said.</p>
