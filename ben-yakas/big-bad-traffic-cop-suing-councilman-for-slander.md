Chu <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150731013537/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/traffic_agent_ratted_slander_claim_lE3DyJJXjsYH3LO2baPD2J?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">claims</a> Councilman Dan Halloran and his then-chief of staff Dennis Ring defamed him with &quot;false reports&quot; that he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150731013537/http://gothamist.com/2010/06/16/councilman_ticketed_for_pulling_ove.php">drove recklessly</a> with police lights flashing while chatting on a cell phone. According to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150731013537/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/11/04/2010-11-04_traffic_agent_daniel_chu_claims_city_caused_him_2m_damages_for_false_reports_he_.html">Daily News</a>, Chu is filing this lawsuit even though he admitted to those charges during an NYPD disciplinary hearing, where he was demoted to foot patrol. <p></p>

<p>Previously, Chu was called a &quot;legend&quot; for his bad behavior, which included <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150731013537/http://gothamist.com/2010/06/17/councilman_vs_traffic_agent_fracas.php">yelling and cursing</a> at a funeral mourners and being <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150731013537/http://gothamist.com/2010/06/19/traffic_agent_chu_legend_for_breaki.php">unnecessarily abusive</a> with citizens. Councilman Hallorman, who had been given a ticket by Chu for &apos;blocking a crosswalk,&quot; called Chu a &quot;nut job,&quot; and told the News that his lawsuit was, &quot;unbelievable. He&apos;s got an idiot for a lawyer. The city of New York did an investigation and substantiated my claims...The amount of the claim is laughable and the basis of the claim is ridiculous.&quot;</p>
