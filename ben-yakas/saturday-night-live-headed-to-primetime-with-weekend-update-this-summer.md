<p>People can&apos;t get enough of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170327110823/http://gothamist.com/tags/snl"><em>Saturday Night Live</em></a> these days (well, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170327110823/http://www.vulture.com/2017/03/snl-has-never-been-more-popular-and-less-fun.html"><em>most</em> people</a>), with the Trump administration material and frequent guest star turns rocketing the show to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170327110823/http://www.avclub.com/article/saturday-night-live-enjoying-its-highest-ratings-o-249926">its best ratings in over 20 years.</a> There <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170327110823/http://screencrush.com/snl-weekend-update-spinoff-primetime/">have been rumors</a> that the Powers That Be at SNL have been planning to expand Weekend Update into primetime someway or another, and now it seems they have figured it out.</p>

<p>In August, <em>Saturday Night Live: Weekend Update</em> will jump to primetime with four half-hour episodes during what is otherwise a pretty dead month for television. The first episode will air on Thursday, August 10th at 9:00 p.m. </p>

<p>NBC said in a press release, &quot;SNL is having its best season in a quarter of a century&#x2014;how many shows can say that?!&#x2014;so we didn&#x2019;t want them to take the summer off. We&#x2019;re thrilled to have Colin Jost and Michael Che continuing their unique brand of news with fresh &#x2018;Weekend Update&#x2019; shows in primetime this August.&quot; In addition to hosts Jost and Che, other cast members are also expected to appear on the show.  </p>

<p>This isn&apos;t the first time the Jost/Che team stepped out of the Saturday night time slot for some Weekend Update fun&#x2014;last summer, they did bits from both the Republican and Democratic National Conventions.</p>

<p>Not everyone is as excited about the SNL surge as NBC&#x2014;former cast member No&#xEB;l Wells, who was only on the show for the 2013/2014 season, called SNL the &quot;comedy establishment&quot; in an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170327110823/http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/03/noel-wells-saturday-night-live-mr-roosevelt-sxsw?mbid=social_twitter&amp;mbid=social_twitter&amp;mbid=social_twitter&amp;mbid=social_twitter">interview with Vanity Fair.</a> &#x201C;I think telling SNL that they have to accept us is just going to water us down,&#x201D; Wells said regarding fellow castmembers who didn&apos;t last long on the show. &quot;We&#x2019;re much stronger doing our own things. Don&#x2019;t we want to make rock n&#x2019; roll? Why are we all trying to be accepted by all these comedy dinosaurs? SNL has become what it was always trying to make fun of. It&#x2019;s become this big machine. I don&#x2019;t want to be plugged into a machine.&quot; <br>
