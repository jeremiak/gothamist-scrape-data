</div></div>					<p>The 15th annual Poets Walk across Brooklyn Bridge to benefit the newly relocated <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150611145120/http://www.poetshouse.org/">Poets House</a> took place this past Monday. Well over a hundred people gathered outside of One Centre Street in Manhattan in the late afternoon for the event; the crowd then ambled across the Brooklyn Bridge bearing banners and flags, with stops along with way for readings by poets such as Thomas Lux, Anne Carson, Tina Chang (the Brooklyn Poet Laureate), and Galway Kinnell, who read Walt Whitman&apos;s masterful &quot;Crossing Brooklyn Ferry&quot; at the Fulton Ferry Landing. </p>

<p>Also in attendance was noted golf and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150611145120/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/30/bill_murray_reads_poetry_to_constru.php">poetry enthusiast</a> Bill Murray, who Forbes reckons is leading his own <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150611145120/http://blogs.forbes.com/booked/2010/06/15/bill-murray-is-leading-a-poetry-revolution/">&quot;poetry revolution.&quot;</a> So he&apos;s got <em>that </em>going for him.</p>
