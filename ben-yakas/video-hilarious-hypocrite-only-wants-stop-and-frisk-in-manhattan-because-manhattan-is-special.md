                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="81613ny1.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20131004233450im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/81613ny1.jpeg" width="640" height="419" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>Obviously there are a lot of heated opinions about the city&apos;s controversial <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131004233450/http://gothamist.com/tags/stopandfrisk">stop-and-frisk policy</a>, which was ruled unconstitutional by a federal judge this week. But one proud Upper West Side resident has by far the <strike>most logical</strike> craziest perspective on the whole thing. As <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131004233450/http://www.complex.com/city-guide/2013/08/ny1-the-call-racist-lady-stop-and-frisk">Complex</a> reported, Joan from the Upper West Side called into NY1&apos;s nightly 10pm show, &quot;The Call,&quot; on Wednesday, and patiently explained why she&apos;s a-okay with stop-and-frisk ending in the outer boroughs, but dear god, not Manhattan: <strong>&quot;Manhattan is special. Let&apos;s put it this way: we are New York! Brooklyn and Queens and Staten Island, I....I don&apos;t even like talking about those kinds of places!&quot;</strong></p>

<p><iframe src="https://web.archive.org/web/20131004233450if_/http://player.vimeo.com/video/72502225?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" width="640" height="480" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen></iframe> </p><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131004233450/http://vimeo.com/72502225">Joan, from the Upper West Side, on The Call.</a> from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131004233450/http://vimeo.com/user652136">FEK</a> on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131004233450/https://vimeo.com/">Vimeo</a>.</p><p></p>

<p>Host John Schiumo was slightly dumbfounded by the call, assuming at first that Joan was being sarcastic, or perhaps doing an outdated Woody Allen impression&#x2014;but Joan, who is &quot;very active in liberal politics,&quot; was being completely sincere:</p>

<blockquote>Well, in all due respect, think about it this way: affordable housing&#x2014;I mean, New Yorkers accept [this] in the boroughs, but you don&apos;t want those people living around you! Of course, I would be the first to say anyone in Brooklyn and Queens and Staten Island would be prejudiced for that, but I mean, ugh, I&apos;m not a hypocrite!</blockquote>

<p>As Schuimo put it, &quot;That&apos;s one of the funniest things I&apos;ve heard in eight years of this program.&quot; By the way, Joan&apos;s still up in the air about The Bronx, and she&apos;s probably voting for Quinn.</p>
