<p>Under the list of musical team-ups you&apos;d never think could happen, the idea of members of Blur and Oasis collaborating has to be as unlikely as Billy Corgan contributing wah wah guitar to the next Stephen Malkmus record. For crissakes, Noel Gallagher <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504142144/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4151510.stm">said in an interview</a> back in 1995, &quot;I hate that Alex [James] and Damon [Albarn]. I hope they catch AIDS and die.&quot; Any yet here we are: it&apos;s 2013, and Gallagher is performing with Albarn and Graham Coxon of Blur (and Paul Weller)! Listen to the four perform Blur&apos;s classic &quot;Tender&quot; below.</p>

<p>The two sides officially buried the hatchet musically last night at London&apos;s Royal Albert Hall for Britain&apos;s Teenage Cancer Trust charity. Lest this is all blowing your mind a bit too much, rest assured that some things never change: Noel and brother Liam Gallagher <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504142144/http://www.nme.com/news/beady-eye/68000">still hate each other&apos;s guts.</a></p>
