title: Powerless Chelsea Residents Teased By Mistake Con Ed Robocalls

										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="11212powerback.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161015im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/11212powerback.jpg" width="640" height="480"> <br> <i> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161015/http://www.flickr.com/photos/ekonon/8148129093/in/pool-gothamist">ekonon&apos;s flickr</a></i></div> <p></p>

<p>It&apos;s been a confusing day trying to figure out <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161015/http://gothamist.com/2012/11/02/con_ed_expects_to_restore_power_to.php">whether Con Ed would be able to restore power</a> to lower Manhattan below 39th Street, which has been in the dark since <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161015/http://gothamist.com/tags/hurricanesandy">Hurricane Sandy</a> hit the city Monday night. It seems a lot of people in Chelsea have been receiving robocalls about power coming back on in the last hour...except Con Ed says those calls were mistakes.</p>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>Apologies to the folks receiving robocalls from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161015/https://twitter.com/search/%23ConEdison">#ConEdison</a> in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161015/https://twitter.com/search/%23Manhattan">#Manhattan</a> - We&apos;re still on target to have power restored by tmw night</p>&#x2014; Con Edison (@ConEdison) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161015/https://twitter.com/ConEdison/status/264439626519941120" data-datetime="2012-11-02T18:51:34+00:00">November 2, 2012</a></blockquote>

<p>Despite <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161015/http://gothamist.com/2012/11/02/watch_live_soon_bloomberg_gives_lat.php">Mayor Bloomberg&apos;s assurances</a> this afternoon that they would get power back by midnight tonight, Con Ed seems to be playing it safe for now, saying power will be back by tomorrow, <em>no backsies.</em> One tipster wrote us: &quot;My coworker received an automated phone call from ConEd stating his power had been restored.  In the last 5 minutes, he got confirmation from a neighbor that it was a false alarm.  In fact, this is the 2nd instance of ConEd false alarms that I have heard of today (first was a friend of a friend in West Village).  Very not cool.&quot;</p>

<p>Below, check out some tweets of false hope and bitter reality from Chelsea residents. If you live down there and do get power back today, send us a tip about where you are, and we&apos;ll keep updating this post as power gets turned back on.</p>
