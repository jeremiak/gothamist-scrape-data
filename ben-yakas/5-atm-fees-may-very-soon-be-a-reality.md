<p>These fees are big business for banks: ATMs generated $7.1 billion in profits from them last year, according to consulting firm Oliver Wyman. According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160823103633/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703566504576202792887598636.html">the WSJ</a>, the new fees are due to changes in federal regulations on overdraft charges and debit cards&#x2014;banks are scrambling to replace billions of dollars in revenue expected to be lost any way they can. J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co., TD Bank Financial Group, and PNC Financial Services Group have already started testing out the increased fees in other states; it now costs $5 in Illinois and $4 in Texas for people who use a Chase ATM and aren&#x2019;t a bank customer. </p>

<p>&quot;If you have to find revenue somewhere, increasing this surcharge [on noncustomers] is the least unpleasant way of doing it,&quot; said Tony Hayes, a partner in the banking practice of Oliver Wyman. And more increases are expected to come: some banks are increasing charges for checking accounts, and TD Bank recently dropped its policy of letting its customers use other ATMs for free, and now charges $2 a pop. Some are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160823103633/http://blogs.wsj.com/deals/2011/03/16/its-coming-the-5-atm-fee/">comparing</a> these changes to the airline industry, &quot;which is building its business on fees for checked bags, peanuts and other little &#x201C;perks&#x201D; the public used to take for granted.&quot; </p>

<p>Last year, Mayor Bloomberg <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160823103633/http://gothamist.com/2010/12/21/bloomberg_doesnt_want_to_be_atm_gri.php">postponed signing</a> a bill to stiffen fines for illegal sidewalk ATMs because he didn&apos;t want to be a Grinch; but if these fees come to be in NYC, customers will likely balk at the charges, and Bloomberg may not have to worry about ruining anyone&apos;s Christmas this year.</p>
