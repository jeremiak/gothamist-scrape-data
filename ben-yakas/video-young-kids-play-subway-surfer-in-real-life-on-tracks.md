<p>Over <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509174156/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/23/scott_stringer_were_really_on_pace.php">50 people were killed and 150 were injured</a> due to subway-related incidents last year; by our count, there have been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509174156/http://gothamist.com/tags/subwayfatalities">at least 22 deaths</a> this year due to subway fatalities. At least three people <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509174156/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/02/mans_leg_severed_by_1_train_after_h.php">have lost</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509174156/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/24/mans_legs_severed_by_subway_after_f.php">limbs in</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509174156/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/20/man_critically_injured_after_being.php">various incidents</a>. There have been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509174156/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/08/emergency_city_council_meeting_on_s.php">emergency hearings</a> to try to come up with ways to prevent more deaths from happenings. But dumb kids will be dumb kids&#x2014;and some of them will try to play &quot;Subway Surfer&quot; in real life by running across the subway tracks. And then they&apos;ll upload the video to YouTube.</p>

<p>In case you&apos;re not familiar with the game, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509174156/http://kiloo.com/games/subway-surfers">&quot;Subway Surfer&quot;</a> is an app available for smart phones in which the player tries to dodge oncoming trains. A harmless enough game as long as you don&apos;t try to recreate it in real life, obviously. This year alone, a teen celebrating his 18th birthday <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509174156/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/27/birthday_teen_killed_by_2_train_was.php#photo-1">was fatally struck by a train</a> when he was crossing the tracks reportedly on a dare; a 23-year-old was fatally struck when <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509174156/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/05/cops_believe_florida_tourist_was_fa.php">he chased after money he dropped onto the tracks.</a> </p>

<p>In case you&apos;re curious what it looks like when a train is right on top of you, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509174156/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/03/video_this_is_what_it_looks_like_wh.php">watch this video</a>, get it out of your system, and never attempt to go down to the track. Even if you aren&apos;t killed, you certainly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509174156/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/31/photo_this_is_not_how_your_should_w.php">do not want to be these girls.</a></p>
