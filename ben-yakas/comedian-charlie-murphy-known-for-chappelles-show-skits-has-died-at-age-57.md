<p>Murphy was most famous for being a writer and actor on Comedy Central&apos;s <em>Chappelle&apos;s Show</em>, with two of his <em>Charlie Murphy&apos;s True Hollywood Stories</em> sketches becoming huge hits. In one, he recounted a run-in with Prince in the &apos;80s that ended with Prince and his band beating Murphy and his crew in a game of basketball (and then Prince served them pancakes). Prince later confirmed the story, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170420015329/https://books.google.com/books?id=JWqnueNtCT8C&amp;pg=PA99&amp;lpg=PA99&amp;dq=%22the+whupping+is+true.%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=QNbahgSM4n&amp;sig=hi6AjHn-k9cTCmn4QkIhcxDlMyU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiApfD5uZ_TAhXD4iYKHdb-Ce8Q6AEILTAD#v=onepage&amp;q=%22the%20whupping%20is%20true.%22&amp;f=false">saying</a>, &quot;the whupping is true.&quot; You can watch it below.</p>

<p>In another skit, Murphy recounted his tumultuous relationship with Rick James in the &apos;80s, which spawned its own catchphrases and brought James a new level of attention. You can see that sketch, plus James&apos; recollections of the period, below.</p>
