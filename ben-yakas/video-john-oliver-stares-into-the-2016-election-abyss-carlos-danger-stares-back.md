<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021164342/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/10/video_john_oliver_trump_tapes.php">A month ago</a>, after Donald Trump tweeted that everyone should check out the sex tape of a former Miss Universe contestant and the Trump Tapes <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021164342/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/07/trump_what_this_time_oh_god.php">were released</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021164342/http://gothamist.com/tags/johnoliver">John Oliver</a> declared that we had reached rock bottom in this presidential campaign. And then Carlos Danger came back, inspiring this plea for it all to end: &quot;If you look up now, you will see absolutely nothing...we have burrowed through not just rock bottom, but through the core of the Earth, and we&apos;ve come bursting out the other side, startling kangaroos, and we are currently hurtling toward outer space where there is no up, down, light or darkness, just an endless void in which death comes as sweet, sweet relief. Please, let this thing be over soon.&quot; </p>

<p>In the longer, more sobering, and Carlos Danger-free segment of the show, Oliver tackled school segregation and racism, &quot;you know, the problem that <em>Crash</em> failed to solve.&quot; He touches on how NYC is among the most segregated school systems for black students (&quot;Of course racism exists in New York. Have you never seen <em>West Side Story</em>?&quot;) and the funding problems placed on predominantly black schools (&quot;Funding tends to follow white people around the way white people follow the band Phish around&quot;). Watch it below.</p>
