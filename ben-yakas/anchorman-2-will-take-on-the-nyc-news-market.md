<p>Lips have been sealed tighter than a Go-Go&apos;s song when it comes to plot details around the hotly-anticipated <em>Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues</em>. But OBLIGATORY SPOILER ALERT, director Adam McKay told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307024958/http://www.empireonline.com/news/story.asp?NID=36637">Empire Magazine</a> that Ron Burgundy and his news team will be trading in sunny San Diego for NYC in the upcoming film. An insider on the movie, which is currently being shot <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307024958/http://laist.com/2013/03/04/photos_will_ferrell_on_anchorman_set.php">in Atlanta</a>, confirmed with us what&apos;s happening on-set: &quot;They just said it&apos;s actually about the NYC news market, so some scenes will be shot there. I saw the plans last week for a set they&apos;re building here that is the interior of a NY brownstone.&quot;</p>

<p>McKay added that part of the plot will involve the struggle for Burgundy and his news team to adapt to the 24-hour news cycle. &#x201C;San Diego is too close to Ron&#x2019;s heart to go away, but we feel that New York City is the holy grail for all newsmen,&#x201D; he said.</p>

<p>More exciting news: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307024958/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/harrison-ford-signs-anchorman-2-425885">it&apos;s been announced that</a> professional curmudgeon and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307024958/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1126618/">one-time fake newscaster</a> Harrison Ford will play &quot;a legendary broadcaster ala Tom Brokaw&quot; in the film. Ford joins Kristen Wiig (who&apos;ll play Brick Tamland&apos;s new love interest), James Marsden (as Burgundy&apos;s new nemesis) as the major new additions to the <em>Anchorman</em> cast, along with returning members Will Ferrell, Steve Carell, Paul Rudd, Christina Applegate and David Koechner. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307024958/http://www.deadline.com/2013/02/anchorman-2-legend-continues-meagan-good/">Also joining the cast</a> are Dylan Baker, Meagan Good, possibly Terrance Stamp (as a Rupert Murdoch-esque media mogul), and there are also rumors that John C. Reilly will make an appearance (or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307024958/http://www.hitfix.com/news/john-c-reilly-reportedly-joining-anchorman-the-legend-continues">at least a few John C. Reilly lookalikes</a>). Hopefully they&apos;ll all be involved <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307024958/http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/exclusive-adam-mckay-says-anchorman-2-will-have-musical-numbers-wants-murderers-row-of-day-players-in-supporting-roles-20121112">with the musical numbers.</a></p>

<p>And hey, if you&apos;re going to have a Brokaw stand-in and set the film in NYC, maybe there&apos;s also room for a Gothamist stand-in (we do have the scoop on all of the local <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307024958/http://gothamist.com/tags/catfashionshow">cat fashion shows</a>)? Or a Pat Kiernan and Roger Clark NY1 cameo? Although since this film is reportedly taking place in the late 1970s or 1980s, there&apos;s admittedly a much better chance of a Robert Goulet stand-in. After all, he is the Ron Burgundy of Canadian-American crooners.</p>
