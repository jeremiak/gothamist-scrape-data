<p>Greenpoint bar Lulu&apos;s has been a mainstay of the neighborhood for the last decade, but the bar has come under hard times recently. As a result, owner John McGillion wants to take advantage of changing demographics in the neighborhood and turn it into a gay and lesbian bar. The only problem? His landlord specifically wrote in his lease that he can&apos;t do that.</p>

<p>According to the clause in his lease: &quot;The leased Premises shall be used by Tenant as a restaurant and bar. It shall not be used for adult entertainment and shall not be operated as a gay or lesbian bar and/or restaurant.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am barely scraping by on the proceeds of the bar...If I am permitted to operate a gay bar at the premises I believe that I will be able to make a considerable profit,&quot; McGillon wrote in the lawsuit he filed against his landlord, Guard General Merchandise Corp., last week. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140709182605/http://nypost.com/2014/04/20/landlord-bans-brooklyn-club-from-becoming-gay-bar-suit/">He told the Post</a> he&apos;s been battling with the landlord for the last year to make the change to no avail. </p>

<p>&quot;I don&#x2019;t know what their problem is. Who knows? I thought those days were gone,&quot; he said of the lease. &quot;I mean, who cares, today? Gays &#x2014; everybody&#x2019;s got their rights. What&#x2019;s the big deal?&quot; McGillion only has 10 more months on his lease but wants to extend it by two-three years; he thinks he can make 40-50 percent more business as a gay bar.</p>

<p>&quot;They do well because you don&#x2019;t have issues of fighting,&quot; he explained. &quot;They&#x2019;re nice people, they&#x2019;re wonderful to deal with. It&#x2019;s easier. Typically you don&#x2019;t have to offer food.&quot; Well, if this doesn&apos;t work out, he could always turn the bar into a moving tribute to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140709182605/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/02/lou_reed_receiving_death_threats_fr.php">classic Lou Reed/Metallica album, <em>LuLu</em></a>.</p>
