<p>There comes a time in every multi-millionaire comedians life when all the <em>Bee Movies</em>, ill-conceived marriage game shows, and guest appearances on The Tonight Show just don&apos;t fill up the soul. And in that darkest moment, Jerry Seinfeld has turned inward for creative rejuvenation...and launched a new web series. Check out the trailer for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130730000403/http://comediansincarsgettingcoffee.com/"><em>Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee</em></a> below.</p>

<p>Not much is known about the project&#x2014;a spokesman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130730000403/http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/07/05/whats-the-deal-with-jerry-seinfelds-comedians-in-cars-getting-coffee/">told the Times</a> that Seinfeld is &#x201C;letting the content speak for itself for now,&#x201D; and that there would be &#x201C;more to come.&#x201D; What we know for sure: there&apos;ll be lots of high-profile guests&#x2014;including Larry David, Ricky Gervais, Colin Quinn, Bob Einstein, Michael Richards and Alec Baldwin&#x2014;joining Seinfeld for rides in his classic car collection. But the vagueness of the title leaves so much to speculate upon: will they only be talking about cars? Will they be laughing about coffee? Could they be talking about coffee...AND laughing about cars?</p>
