</div></div><p>A fire broke out above a post office in Park Slope this morning. According to FDNY, the blaze started around 9 a.m. at 200 7th Avenue, between 2nd and 3rd Streets. The fire was sparked well above the post office, on the third floor of a four floor building, so it&apos;s unclear to what extent mail was damaged. No injuries have been reported, and we&apos;re guessing local residents will be fine with anything that gets the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130113163145/http://www.fuckedinparkslope.com/home/worst-post-office-ever-happy-tax-day-from-the-7th-ave-usps.html">notoriously slow</a> 7th Avenue post office to light a fire under its ass.</p>

<p>It took firefighters about 30 minutes to get it under control, and firefighters are still on the scene. It is not yet known what started the fire, but we&apos;ll update as more information becomes available. <br>
