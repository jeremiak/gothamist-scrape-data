<p>Since Donald <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170802073622/https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/829384587482656768">&quot;EASY D&quot;</a> Trump ascended to the presidency, the White House has become leakier than a pair of Russian prostitutes hired by Trump to...<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170802073622/http://gothamist.com/2017/01/10/trump_russian_intelligence_blackmail.php">you know.</a> The latest damning report comes courtesy of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170802073622/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-administration-leaks_us_589a45f1e4b04061313a1fbb">the Huffington Post</a>, which paints a picture of Trump as a bumbling, petty executive &quot;more concerned with the adulation of the nation than the details of his own policies &#x2015; and quick to assign blame when things do not go his way.&quot;</p>

<p>The report is largely based off of anonymous sources inside the White House, but Huffington Post did get some others willing to go on the record to discuss Trump&apos;s disturbing state of mind, or lack thereof: &quot;I&#x2019;ve been in this town for 26 years,&quot; said Eliot Cohen, a senior State Department official under President George W. Bush and a member of his National Security Council. &quot;I have never seen anything like this. I genuinely do not think this is a mentally healthy president.&quot;</p>

<p>One of the most alarming anecdotes in the report comes right at the very start, and concerns Trump&apos;s deep ignorance of basic economic matters:</p>

<blockquote>President Donald Trump was confused about the dollar: Was it a strong one that&#x2019;s good for the economy? Or a weak one?

<p>So he made a call &#x2015; except not to any of the business leaders Trump brought into his administration or even to an old friend from his days in real estate. Instead, he called his national security adviser, retired Lt. Gen. Mike Flynn, according to two sources familiar with Flynn&#x2019;s accounts of the incident.</p>

<p>Flynn has a long record in counterintelligence but not in macroeconomics. And he told Trump he didn&#x2019;t know, that it wasn&#x2019;t his area of expertise, that, perhaps, Trump should ask an economist instead.</p>

<p>Trump was not thrilled with that response &#x2015; but that may have been a function of the time of day. Trump had placed the call at 3 a.m., according to one of Flynn&#x2019;s retellings &#x2015; although neither the White House nor Flynn&#x2019;s office responded to requests for confirmation about that detail.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>The Huff Po piece comes on the heels of an equally-scary look at Trump&apos;s life <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170802073622/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/05/us/politics/trump-white-house-aides-strategy.html">from the NY Times on Monday</a>, which painted him as a brooding commander-in-chief who can&apos;t concentrate on policy long enough to understand the Executive Orders he&apos;s signing: &quot;When Mr. Trump is not watching television in his bathrobe or on his phone reaching out to old campaign hands and advisers, he will sometimes set off to explore the unfamiliar surroundings of his new home.&quot; </p>

<p>Leaks are common in any presidency&#x2014;a certain percentage of them are always part of intentional White House communications strategy&#x2014;but Richard Nephew, a State Department expert on Iran sanctions under Obama, offered his theory as to why leaks are already so much more plentiful under Trump: &#x201C;This, I think, is about making it clear that these folks have tried to do the right thing and there is only so much they can do with a hostile administration,&#x201D; Nephew told Huff Po. Those leaks have included everything from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170802073622/http://bigstory.ap.org/article/trump-mexico-take-care-bad-hombres-or-us-might">nasty phone conversations</a> with other world leaders to Trump&apos;s dissatisfaction with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170802073622/http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/318385-report-trump-regrets-hiring-spicer-blames-priebus">his own press secretary</a> to the completely botched <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170802073622/http://gothamist.com/2017/01/31/yemen_raid_trump_fatal.php">Yemen covert military operation</a> that left several Americans and dozens of civilians dead, and all because Trump&apos;s advisors reportedly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170802073622/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/trump-launched-yemen-raid-told-obama-wouldn-article-1.2966736">used his pride against him.</a></p>

<p>Elizabeth Rosenberg, a counterterrorism expert at the Treasury Department under Obama, agreed with Nephew&apos;s assessment: &#x201C;I think it&#x2019;s a cry for help,&quot; she said, adding that staffers are driven by a simple motive: &quot;Incredulity, and the need to share it.&quot; Rick Wilson, a former Pentagon official familiar with intelligence issues who has become a vocal Trump critic, concurs: &quot;The intelligence community is desperately looking for a way to get some leverage in altering dangerous policies away from a catastrophic vector.&quot;</p>

<p>Yes, a non-catastrophic vector would indeed be preferable, if that&apos;s still an option, thanks!</p>
