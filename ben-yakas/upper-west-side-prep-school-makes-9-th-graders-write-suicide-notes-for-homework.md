<p>It&apos;s one thing to make kids do <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150321225026/http://dcist.com/2012/03/bloodthirsty_aliens_cannibalism_ant.php">homework assignments on cannibals and bloodthirsty aliens</a>&#x2014;it&apos;s an entirely different thing to force them to face their own mortality and justify killing themselves for English class. That&apos;s what parents allege that a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150321225026/http://www.yorkprep.org/">York Prep</a> teacher made her students do: &#x201C;We thought this was such an outrageous assignment for a 14-year-old to get,&#x201D; a father of one student there <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150321225026/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/school_suicide_lesson_FT84t7n1joyMsfeiBcMBBL">told the Post</a>. &#x201C;We pay a lot of money to send our kids to the school.&#x201D; Though obviously not enough to shield them from confronting their own mortal coil.</p>

<p>Teacher Jessica Barrish assigned the students to channel May Boatwright from &quot;The Secret Life of Bees&quot; by writing in first person about her legacy and how they wanted to be remembered by her sisters. &#x201C;How would you justify ending your life? What reasons would you give?&#x201D; the assignment asked. Headmaster Ronald Stewart said that &quot;not a single&quot; parent had complained about the assignment before blabbing to the Post.</p>

<p>New School philosophy professor Simon Critchley, who recently taught a suicide note-writing workshop for adults, said he thought the assignment was fine: &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t see why this is inappropriate at all. If it is, then suicide is a taboo, and I simply think we have to think rationally about our taboos,&#x201D; he said. Well sure, as long as it&apos;s not <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150321225026/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/22/bad_nyc_teacher_asks_how_many_times.php">math questions about slavery.</a></p>

<p>This isn&apos;t the first time suicide note-writing has been brought into the classroom: last winter, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150321225026/http://thestir.cafemom.com/teen/148112/heartless_teacher_has_class_write">a French middle school teacher was suspended</a> for asking his 13 and 14-year-old students to pretend they were going to kill themselves, and explain why. </p>

<p>And this isn&apos;t the first time Barrish has made the dailies: in May, she filed a $2 million lawsuit against a former college friend <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150321225026/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/12/upper_east_side_teacher_claims_frie.php">who she claimed destroyed her apartment and murdered her cat.</a> </p>
