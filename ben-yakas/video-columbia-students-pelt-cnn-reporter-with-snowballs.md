<p>Hundreds of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426134258/http://gothamist.com/tags/columbia">Columbia</a> undergrads took some time out of their busy schedules of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426134258/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/27/an_inordinate_amount_of_columbia_st.php">licking cheese off each other</a> to gather on campus for a massive snowball fight after the snowstorm earlier this week. That made for an especially difficult broadcast for CNN&apos;s Jason Carroll, and an especially smirky one for the much drier Anderson Cooper. It&apos;s all fun and games, of course, until <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426134258/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/22/man_hit_by_falling_ice_in_midtown.php">someone loses eye</a>. Hopefully students sobered up after this, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426134258/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/04/columbia_fraternitys_pledge_scaveng.php">donned their finest swimcaps and got back to the important work of flourishing at an Ivy League university</a>.</p>
