<p>We come across a lot of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150511140059/http://gothamist.com/tags/dogs">good dogs</a> in our time, and Zander, the 7-year-old white husky above, is certainly deserving of some extra treats and socks to gnaw on: after his owner was hospitalized with a skin condition, a heartbroken Zander left his Bay Shore home and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150511140059/http://www.myfoxny.com/story/19740226/dog-tracks-down-ailing-owner-at-hospital">travelled more than two miles</a> to the Good Samaritan Hospital Medical Center to be by his side.  &#x201C;He&#x2019;s gotten out in the past, but never gone to that location or anywhere near [the hospital],&#x201D; said owner John Dolan.</p>

<p>Zander, a shelter dog, likely had to go under the Robert Moses Parkway and across a four-lane road to get there. A hospital employee found the dog on the street outside of building where Dolan was being treated, and called the number on his tag&#x2014;Dolan&apos;s number. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s not nonsense that he was at the hospital,&#x201D; Dolan, who is now back at home with Zander, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150511140059/http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2012/10/loyal-dog-leaves-new-york-home-seeks-out-sick-owner-in-hospital/">told ABC News</a>.  &#x201C;He was moping around for the days I was already at the hospital, sitting in my seat and rolled up and depressed.  My wife said he had water in his eyes and looked like he was really sad.&#x201D; He added: &#x201C;It&#x2019;s a cool story and uplifting. Who knows how or why it happened.&#x201D;</p>
