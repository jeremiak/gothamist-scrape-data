<p>A 45-year-old Connecticut man is accused of tricking underage girls into performing sex acts for him online by posing as the lead singer of boy band One Direction. John Eastman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130608004748/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2013/05/31/conn-man-charged-with-impersonating-one-direction-band-member-to-entice-young-girls/">is accused of using the screen name</a> Harry.Styles888 on Skype along with a photo of the singer in order to convince kids he really was the 19-year-old Styles. &#x201C;My hope is that the girl will show me herself on camera and then pose in a sexual manner, or perform some kind of sex act for me to see,&#x201D; Eastman told detectives, according to his arrest warrant.</p>

<p>Officials say that Eastman would sometimes offer concert tickets to the young women in exchange for them posing naked or performing the sex acts online. When cops searched Eastman&apos;s computer, they found more than 500 images of child pornography, including some webcam images of children believed to be as young as 5. Eastman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130608004748/http://www.rep-am.com/articles/2013/05/30/news/local/727722.txt">tried to flee the state</a> after his initial arrest, but was brought back quickly.</p>

<p>Eastman has been charged with first-degree possession of child pornography, employing a minor in an obscene performance and using a computer to entice a minor. He previously spent 10 years on the state&#x2019;s sex offender registry before being taken off of that list in 2009.</p>
