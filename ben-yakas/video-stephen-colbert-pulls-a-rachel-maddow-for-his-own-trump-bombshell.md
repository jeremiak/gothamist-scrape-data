<p>A lot of people were infuriated after Rachel Maddow took viewers on an emotional rollercoaster on Tuesday night when she announced she had Donald Trump&apos;s tax returns...only to go on and on with an excruciatingly long build up to the &quot;reveal,&quot; which turned out to be two pages of a 2005 tax document that you could have just seen online. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170318221806/http://gothamist.com/tags/stephencolbert">Stephen Colbert</a> mimicked her style in a segment last night, throwing out dramatic pause after dramatic pause as he offered his own drawn-out preamble regarding a joke connected to Trump.</p>

<p>The real Rachel Maddow was on <em>The Tonight Show With Ratings Loser Jimmy Fallon</em> talking about those Trump tax returns and how they were obtained and verified. It was bad enough that she got all our hopes up for two pages of whatever&#x2014;but forcing me <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170318221806/http://gothamist.com/2017/02/17/jimmy_fallon_trump_tool.php">to embed a Fallon video</a>? TOO FAR MADDOW. </p>

<p>Colbert has a slightly different theory on how Maddow got those tax returns: he thinks Trump may have been his own leaker. Colbert then took to his microwave camera to get to the heart of this conspiracy: &quot;Follow me here,&quot; he said. &quot;Maybe Trump did leak his own tax returns from the year when he actually paid returns to dispel rumors that he hasn&apos;t paid taxes in 20 years. Or maybe this whole tax thing is just a distraction from the investigation into his connections with Russia. Or maybe that&apos;s just a distraction from the fact that Trumpcare&apos;s dead on arrival. If you think about it, it makes sense. But if you don&apos;t think about it, it makes more sense.&quot;</p>

<p>But at least we learned what it takes to get the White House to confirm some basic facts about the president: &quot;So apparently I think this proves if they think you already have the information, Trump&apos;s team is more than happy to confirm it. I guess now is a good time to tell the White House that someone Fed Ex&apos;d me a urine-soaked videotape.&quot;</p>

<p>Seth Meyers, meanwhile, thinks the real revelation of the tax returns is how he feels about his children: &quot;Specifically the part where he claimed Ivanka and Donald Jr. as dependents and tried to write off Eric as a loss.&quot;</p>

<p>For his &quot;A Closer Look&quot; segment, Meyers looked closer at how the Trump administration consistently tries to discredit the sources of anyone who presents facts that clash with their agenda. &quot;The only constant in all of this is that Trump likes something if it agrees with him, and he hates it if it doesn&apos;t,&quot; Meyers said. &quot;Even when Trump makes a claim in his own words, like when he accused President Obama of wiretapping him, we can&apos;t be sure if we are supposed to take him literally.&quot;</p>
