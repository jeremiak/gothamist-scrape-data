<p>Peel the internet curtains back at Gothamist HQ, and you&apos;ll find more than a few odd traditions and obsessions lurking&#x2014;some of us have Sour Power Straw addictions, some of us hoard whiskey-in-a-can, some of us watch seemingly endless loops of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151223102330/http://heyyeyaaeyaaaeyaeyaa.com/">Heyyeyaaeyaaaeyaeyaa</a>. And some of us blast R. Kelly&apos;s &quot;Ignition (Remix)&quot; every Friday at 5 p.m. with pavlovian precision. This week marks ten years since &quot;Ignition (Remix)&quot; was hot and fresh out the kitchen. It&apos;s the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151223102330/http://www.ilxor.com/ILX/ThreadSelectedControllerServlet?boardid=41&amp;threadid=18110">greatest &quot;weekend&quot; song</a> of all time, and there&apos;s nothing left to do on a Wednesday afternoon but bounce bounce bounce bounce bounce bounce bounce.</p>

<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20151223102330if_/http://www.youtube.com/embed/y6y_4_b6RS8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>It&apos;s hard to know where to start unpacking one of the greatest songs of the &apos;00s, a universal anthem of bounce-ation. It&apos;s always remarkable to us to realize that there really is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151223102330/http://popdust.com/2013/01/22/r-kelly-ignition-original-remix-anniversary/">a non-remix piano-led version of &quot;Ignition&quot;</a> (it appears right in front of the remix on <em>Chocolate Factory</em>!)&#x2014;and it has much filthier lyrics. It was even an R&amp;B; single BEFORE its much better known sequel, though it didn&apos;t really crossover. The &quot;Remix&quot; did peak at #2 on the Billboard Hot 100 Chart though.</p>

<p>And yet, the &quot;Remix&quot; has lived on like universal musical wallpaper, in the background of a million bodgas, limos, clubs, and hotels&#x2014;a genre-defying modern crowd pleaser, up there with Gorillaz&apos;s &quot;Clint Eastwood,&quot; Outkast&apos;s &quot;Hey Ya!,&quot; Beyonce&apos;s &quot;Single Ladies,&quot; and Daft Punk&apos;s &quot;One More Time.&quot; A long time before <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151223102330/http://www.avclub.com/articles/r-kelly-cruise-cancelled-due-to-lack-of-r-kelly,83754/">cancelled cruises</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151223102330/http://austinist.com/2012/05/14/r_kelly_pisses_offon_austin_show_re.php">&quot;intimate nights&quot;</a> at strip clubs, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151223102330/http://gothamist.com/2012/11/20/trapped_in_the_closet_the_musical_m.php">Broadway plays</a>, there were just transcendent singles like this. Oh, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151223102330/http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/culturebox/2008/06/long_live_the_little_man_defense.html">peeing allegations.</a></p>

<p>And the best part is that it&apos;s an unabashedly <em>joyous</em> song whose silly lyrics are deeply self-referential without lapsing into self-parody (or preciousness). On the one hand, it has tons of playful onomatopoeia (&quot;So baby gimme that toot toot /Lemme give you that beep beep;&quot; &quot;Cris-tal poppin&apos;&quot;). Then there&apos;s the spoken word intro (&quot;Go head&apos; on and break em off wit a lil&apos; preview of the remix...&quot;), the pre-chorus which situates Kelly in a car overhearing the song (&quot;Bouncin on 24&apos;s /While they say on the radio&quot;), and then the mighty chorus hook: &quot;It&apos;s the remix to Ignition/hot and fresh out the kitchen.&quot; </p>

<p>As for the bubbly music underneath, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151223102330/http://www.fluxblog.org/">Matthew Perpetua said</a> it best: &quot;Like the best Prince songs, it has an ability to make you feel vicariously smooth and sexy, even if you are not a particularly smooth or sexy person.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151223102330/http://pitchfork.com/features/staff-lists/7693-the-top-500-tracks-of-the-2000s-20-1/">Or as Pitchfork put it</a> when it named the song its 19th favorite track of the 2000s: &quot;You have to work very hard indeed to sound this casual. &quot;Ignition (Remix)&quot; is a lazy, buzzed collage of a night on the town put together with a craftsman&apos;s eye.&quot;</p>

<p>There&apos;s no doubt that &quot;Ignition (Remix)&quot; is R. Kelly&apos;s crowning masterpiece, a single distillation of everything he does well, his &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot;&#x2014;which we guess means, following this poor metaphor to its logical conclusion, that &quot;Trapped In The Closet&quot; is like a never-ending &quot;D&apos;yer Mak&apos;er&quot; (or something). We don&apos;t know how many times a person should bounce per day, but we do know that &quot;Ignition (Remix)&quot; inspired one of the greatest song parodies of all time: Dave Chappelle&apos;s &quot;(I Wanna) Pee On You&quot; and its followup, &quot;Piss On You (Remix).&quot;</p>
