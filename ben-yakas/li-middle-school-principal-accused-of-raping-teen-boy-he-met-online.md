<p>A Long Island middle school principal <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130324005943/http://www.newsday.com/long-island/nassau/police-freeport-middle-school-principal-john-o-mard-had-sex-with-minor-1.4847669">has been arrested and charged</a> with having sex with a teenage boy. John O&apos;Mard, 44, the principal at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130324005943/http://www.freeportschools.org/schools/jw_dodd">J.W. Dodd Middle School</a>, was charged with four counts of third-degree criminal sexual act. And according to detectives, O&apos;Mard had sex with the boy &quot;against his will.&quot;</p>

<p>Police told Newsday that Special Victims Squad detectives arrested O&apos;Mard after an investigation into the Sept. 15th incident. Police said O&apos;Mard met the then 16-year-old victim via an undisclosed online social website, and arranged a meeting. He drove him to his house in Freeport where he &quot;engaged in sexual acts with the victim against his will.&quot; </p>

<p>O&apos;Mard has been &quot;administratively reassigned&quot; by the school district pending the outcome of the investigation.&quot;The district&apos;s commitment to the safety and well being of our students and staff is our number one priority and the district will continue to cooperate with law enforcement during their investigation,&quot; said school superintendent Kishore Kuncham. </p>

<p>In a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130324005943/http://www.freeportschools.org/schools/philosophy_education">philosophy of education statement</a> on the school&apos;s website, O&apos;Mard wrote, &quot;My philosophy presents a vision of excellence and having high standard and expectations for myself and the entire learning organization.&quot;</p>
