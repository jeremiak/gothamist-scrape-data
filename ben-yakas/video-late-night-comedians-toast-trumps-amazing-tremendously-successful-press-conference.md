<p>The &quot;fine-tuned machine&quot; that is the Trump administration achieved another tremendous milestone yesterday when Donald Trump held <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170501203537/http://gothamist.com/2017/02/16/orange_man_yells_at_cloud.php">his first solo press conference</a> as president. It was such a complete and total and utter and incredible and amazing and huge success, Rush Limbaugh said it was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170501203537/https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/832555987299082242">one of the greatest ever</a>! The late night comedians were also across the board impressed with the level of sophistication and nuance Trump brought to the single most batshit crazy press conference in presidential history.</p>

<p>Watch below as Seth Meyers identifies all of Trump&apos;s different tactics for avoiding answering questions on Russia, lists all the historical instances in which presidents had to say they weren&apos;t &quot;ranting and raving&quot; at the media (&quot;Who could forget Lincoln&apos;s tirade at Gettysburg, or FDR&apos;s fireside meltdowns, or Ronald Reagan famously saying, &apos;Mr. Gorbachev, if you don&apos;t tear down this fucking wall, I&apos;m gonna lose my shit!&apos;&quot;), and all the many petty grievances, slights, and false claims Trump pushed. </p>

<p>And don&apos;t forget about his blatantly racist interaction with a black reporter: &quot;It&apos;s racist to assume all black people know each other,&quot; Meyers said. &quot;You don&apos;t know all orange people. Hey Donald, can you set up a meeting with Snookie and the Lorax?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;This was just him, by himself,&quot; Stephen Colbert said at the start of his show about the &apos;stress conference.&apos; &quot;Evidently, he didn&apos;t even bring his meds with him, it was just him, alone.&quot; Colbert was equally impressed with Trump&apos;s ability to deflect all blame from himself: &quot;He started off by defending the rough start his administration has had by immediately attacking America&#x2019;s true enemy: anybody but him.&quot; Watch below as Colbert points out what Trump truly inherited (&quot;You inherited a fortune, we elected a mess&quot;) and has a revelation about his erroneous electoral college boasting: &quot;Do you think 306 is larger than 365? Wow, Betsy DeVos works quick.&quot;</p>

<p>And over at The Daily Show, Trevor Noah discussed how they had to rip up their plans for last night&apos;s show because &quot;Hurricane Trump happened, again.&quot; Noah was also mesmerized by Trump&apos;s insistence on spouting incorrect facts about his electoral victory, and impressed with the NBC News reporters who called him out on it to his face: &quot;I don&#x2019;t know who that reporter is, but he just shoved Trump&#x2019;s face in that like it was a pile of bullshit and he was training a bad dog. &#x2018;Look what you did! Look at it! Bad Trump!&apos;&quot; Noah said. </p>

<p>&quot;You&#x2019;re the president,&quot; he added. &quot;That&#x2019;s the information you were given? If you can&#x2019;t trust your president to get the right information on a Googlable fact, then can you really trust him with the harder stuff? Which, by the way, is everything else the president of the United States has to deal with.&quot;</p>
