<p>JR Smith has forgotten how to shoot, Tyson Chandler looks exhausted, Steve Novak is MIA, and Mike Woodson has permanent shell-shock face&#x2014;and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428180402/http://gothamist.com/tags/knicks">the Knicks</a> face elimination in a stressful Game 5 tonight against the Indiana Pacers. Can they adjust their offense, find their 3 pointer, and push the series back to Indiana? Or will the Pacers book a date with the Heat tonight before a very unhappy Garden crowd? Either way, Reggie Miller is our announcer tonight on TNT, and we&apos;ll keep updating this post with every swish and dish.</p>

<p><strong>9:51 in 1st Quarter</strong>: Carmelo came out hot with 5 points and 2 rebounds&#x2014;he&apos;s so hot, he already has a technical foul. It&apos;s early, but their offense seems to be clicking more now than it has in the last two games. 7-2 Knicks. </p>

<p><strong>4:41 in 1 st Quarter</strong>: Some good signs so far: they aren&apos;t double-teaming Roy Hibbert anymore (and he has two fouls). Iman Shumpert has started hot, and Pablo Prigioni started the game. 14-11 Knicks.</p>

<p><strong>2:47 in 1st Quarter</strong>: JR hits a three! He doesn&apos;t look hungover! Also, Rasheed Wallace <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428180402/https://twitter.com/HerringWSJ/status/335188356109582338">spotted</a>: &quot;And of course Sheed can seen shouting &quot;Ball don&apos;t lie!&quot;</p>

<p><strong>1:45 in 1st Quarter</strong>: Aaaaaaand Jason Kidd can&apos;t hit a layup. Good thing he&apos;s &quot;not out there to score&quot;&#x2014;even when he&apos;s in front of the basket&#x2014;according to Reggie Miller.</p>

<p><strong>End of 1st Quarter</strong>: The quarter ends with a sweet Melo three pointer and a Knicks lead. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428180402/https://twitter.com/TheRealKingFish">Jonathan Fishner</a> gives us his assessment of the first quarter: &quot;Melo looks great, JR making his first shot is huge and Hibbert foul trouble, finally! And I can&apos;t believe Kidd had that layup rim out. The Pacers really miss George Hill.&quot; An interesting stat: Melo/Martin/Stat together, +/- 0 in about 2 min. <strong>19-15 Knicks</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>9:55 in 2nd Quarter</strong>: Stat looks like a mess after two terrible possessions, but Chris Copeland looks great. 23-19 Knicks.<br>
 <br>
<strong>7:20 in 2nd Quarter</strong>: Wally Szczerbiak <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428180402/https://twitter.com/wallyball/status/335193763997687809">believes in Prigioni</a>. We believe. HUGE three-pointer from Copeland. 32-23 Knicks.</p>

<p><strong>4:03 in 2nd Quarter</strong>: Beautiful block by JR Smith. Knicks have been hustling all game. Pacers are beating Knicks on points off turnovers though. Knicks starting to make poor shot selection. 32-29 Knicks. </p>

<p><strong>Half Time</strong>: Fishner says: &quot;Ugly offensive half but the Knicks will take it. Why did Tyson Chandler just do that?!?&quot; But great move on JR&apos;s part, forcing up a shot and drawing a shooting foul on a wild three pointer to end the half. Too bad Reggie Miller has to be a party pooper. </p>

<p>The Knicks are winning 40-34 at halftime. We&apos;d wager that this whole game will be decided in the 3rd quarter...unless the whole game is decided in the 4th quarter. Could there be a 5th quarter? If so, the game will definitely be decided then. Unless there&apos;s a 6th quarter. Definitely, the 7th quarter, at most.</p>

<p><strong>6:31 in 3rd Quarter</strong>: The officiating is officially terrible so far in this game. Copeland knocks down a long three upon entering. COPELAND. ...And then he picks up an offensive foul. Rasheed Wallace is his mentor now. This seems important. 53-44 Knicks.</p>

<p><strong>4:22 in 3rd Quarter</strong>: After a messy drive, another big play by Copeland (making up for his missed three). With every mistake, he does something very right. Fishner: &quot;With Hibbert off the court everything is easier. Look at that! Three chances for the Knicks and they push it to 11.&quot; 59-48 Knicks, largest lead of the game. </p>

<p><strong>End of 3rd Quarter</strong>: If you&apos;re wondering why they&apos;re down by 10, the Pacers are 13/24 from the line. <strong>67-57 Knicks</strong>. </p>

<p><strong>10:00 in 4th Quarter</strong>: Fishner: &quot;Other than Shump who went a little nuts in the first half and is 2-10, all the Knicks are shooting pretty well and they&apos;re at 42% as a team and are 6-15 from three. They&apos;re basically even with the Pacers on the boards (33-32). The difference is the FT shooting for the Pacers and Hibber&apos;s absence. Let&apos;s see if the Knicks can hang on.&quot; 72-65 Knicks.</p>

<p><strong>5:45 in 4th Quarter</strong>: Paul George is playing very well; it seems their strategy is to scare the Knicks into losing this game. Thankfully, Melo has been heating up. 77-71 Knicks.</p>

<p><strong>2:22 in 4th Quarter</strong>: Even Reggie Miller is starting to sound impressed with the Knicks after that swarming defense. Melo is having his way with George, who is trying to avoid a 6th foul. 83-73 Knicks.</p>

<p><strong>1:00 in 4th Quarter</strong>: Pacers have 18 turnovers. Knicks holding things at 83-75 right now. </p>

<p><strong>Game Over</strong>: The Knicks hold on to win&#x2014;85-75&#x2014;thanks in no small part to the Pacers atrocious free throw shooting and copious turnovers. Game 6 will take place on Saturday at 8 p.m. in Indiana. Hopefully the Knicks can steal that one and bring the series back to the Garden.</p>
