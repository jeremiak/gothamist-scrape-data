<p>The NYC Department of Education (DOE) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) have been in a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110226230554/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/04/nyc_parents_dont_want_kids_to_get_c.php">stand-off</a> all year over PCBs in city schools. Despite the EPA&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110226230554/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/11/forget_snow_days_staten_island_kids.php">warnings</a> about PCBs, which have been linked to cancer as well as immune and reproductive system disorders, the city has largely stuck to the attitude, &quot;we just don&apos;t have any money to fix that...and nobody&apos;s died.&quot; But after the EPA <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110226230554/http://www.gothamist.com/2011/02/22/pcbs_found_in_more_brooklyn_schools.php">reported</a> that all nine schools spot-checked this year for PCBs in antiquated lighting fixtures were found to have elevated amounts, the city is changing their tune: Mayor Bloomberg <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110226230554/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703775704576160801982212080.html?mod=WSJ_NY_MIDDLELEADNewsCollection">has finally approved</a> a $708 million plan to replace all the cancer-spewing lighting in city schools.</p>

<p>A DOE official <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110226230554/http://www.ny1.com/content/top_stories/134440/elected-officials-present--700m-plan-to-remove-pcbs-from-schools">told NY1</a> that the aging lighting fixtures at 772 public school buildings, which were installed between 1950 and 1978, will be replaced over a ten year period. The project will be paid for with city capital funds, and will accept bids for the project later this year. The DOE&apos;s critics are surprised it took this long for Bloomberg to snap into action on the issue, which is simpatico with his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110226230554/http://www.nyc.gov/html/planyc2030/html/home/home.shtml">PlaNYC2030</a> initiative. </p>

<p>In addition to replacing more than 564,000 of the leaking, outdated &quot;T12&quot; lights, the city plans <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110226230554/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/mayor_bloomberg_in_deal_to_remove_BoRqKnCRl9S2JLAXVk8rQN?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">to conduct</a> energy audits at its schools and to replace outdated and inefficient boilers in the school system. And on top of the list for replacements is Brooklyn PS 45, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110226230554/http://www.gothamist.com/2011/02/22/pcbs_found_in_more_brooklyn_schools.php">which had</a> PCB levels up to 670,000 parts per million, just a <em>teensy</em> bit above the federal limit of 50 parts per million. We guess this means we shouldn&apos;t expect children to begin adapting and mutating to the PCBs like the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110226230554/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/18/feisty_mutated_fish_living_large_in.php">Atlantic tomcod</a>.</p>
