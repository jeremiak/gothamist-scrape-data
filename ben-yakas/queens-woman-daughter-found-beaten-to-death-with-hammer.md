<p>A woman and her daughter were brutally beaten to death in Queens this morning. According to cops, 56-year-old Estrella Castaneda and 25-year-old Lina Castaneda were found around 12:15 a.m. in their 87th Street home, near Astoria Boulevard, bludgeoned to death with a hammer. Carlos Amarillo, 44, who is believed to be Estrella&apos;s boyfriend, has been arrested and charged with two counts of first degree murder and criminal possession of a weapon.</p>

<p>&quot;Around midnight we heard loud hammering. It was loud. I work in construction so I know what a hammer sounds like. I can&#x2019;t believe it was the sound of someone getting hit. It sounded like someone was swinging that hammer hard,&quot; neighbor Camilo Alvarez <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140424130343/http://nypost.com/2014/01/29/mother-daughter-pair-found-beaten-to-death/">told the Post.</a></p>

<p>Both victims were pronounced dead at the scene. A 7-year-old girl, believed to be Lina&apos;s daughter, was found unharmed in the apartment by cops. &quot;I saw police taking out the daughter,&quot; neighbor Steve Perez <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140424130343/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/women-beaten-death-hammer-wielding-madman-queens-article-1.1594952">told the News</a>. &quot;She was wrapped up in a big coat. She looked scared. She was all hugged up with her arms and legs around the cop.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;They were a quiet family,&quot; he added. &quot;I&apos;d always see them walking down the street to do laundry or to go to school. They looked like they didn&apos;t have a care in the world...The mother and daughter were always together. They even looked alike.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140424130343/http://nypost.com/2014/01/29/mother-daughter-pair-found-beaten-to-death/">Sources told the Post</a> that Amarillo confessed to the crime, accusing them of being &#x201C;witches&#x201D; who were &#x201D;doing voodoo on him.&quot;</p>
