<p>Yesterday <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405025644/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/12/videos_dont_forget_to_work_out_when.php">we were transfixed by</a> a gym rat who brought his perfectly-executed rave moves to his half-hearted weight routine. But even that gentleman can&apos;t compete with the smooth ladies in the video below, who show off their groovy moves to some lively sax music in Grand Central. This group should really hire these smooth operators to dance for them in the future&#x2014;that&apos;s assuming of course that they weren&apos;t already Granny plants.</p>
