                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="072211cat2.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130813082351im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_arts_john/072211cat2.jpg" width="640" height="480"> <br> <i> &quot;It&apos;s a living.&quot; (Flickr User Occipital Lobe)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>If you feel like frying an egg on the sidewalk, today would be as good a day as you&apos;ll get in NYC&#x2014;it&apos;s going to feel like it&apos;s in the upper 90s (and perhaps even triple-digits) today. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130813082351/http://forecast.weather.gov/showsigwx.php?warnzone=NYZ072&amp;warncounty=NYC061&amp;firewxzone=NYZ072&amp;local_place1=Central+Park+NY&amp;product1=Heat+Advisory#.UdgdEj7oiCZ">The National Weather Service has issued</a> a heat advisory for the city, effective until 8 p.m. Sunday, warning it will feel like 99 degrees outside. As Jen Chung put it, the salt of your sweat will mix with the salt of your sweat until you turn into Kramer, screaming, &quot;[this heatwave] is making me thirsty!&quot;</p>

<p>Today will mark the 16th straight day that the temperature will be at or above normal and the 14th day in a row that the low hasn&apos;t dipped below 70 degrees. Those two streaks <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130813082351/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/05/soupy_tropical_weather_for_the_week.php">will continue well into next week,</a> though things should be slightly more palatable (and possibly rainy). </p>

<p>In the meantime, try to take your mind off the weather <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130813082351/http://gothamist.com/2011/07/23/video_ten_songs_to_help_cool_down_d.php#photo-1">with this heatwave playlist</a>, or strap yourself to your A/C unit. Just be grateful you don&apos;t have to swelter outdoors at a wedding in the middle of New Jersey this afternoon...or, ya know, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130813082351/http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-death-valley-continues-to-broiler-after-breaking-record-20130701,0,760166.story">live in Death Valley.</a> </p>
