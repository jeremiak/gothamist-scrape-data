And the more he spouts off <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111031135122/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/07/dont_worry_america_donald_trump_wil.php">nonsense</a> about Obama&apos;s birth certificate, the more it becomes clear that the megalomaniac is serious about becoming the next Fred Thompson, or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111031135122/http://listverse.com/2008/10/15/5-worst-presidential-candidates-who-lost/">John C. Calhoun</a>. But Trump is starting to realize that he may need a stumping point beyond Obama&apos;s mysterious origins. To that end, he&apos;s now added being pro-life, and fighting with the NY Times, to his arsenal of talking points.<p></p>

<p>Last month, when rumors started building that Trump was considering a presidential run, Evangelical voters <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111031135122/http://news.yahoo.com/s/yblog_theticket/20110331/ts_yblog_theticket/evangelical-voters-are-intrigued-by-donald-trump">were intrigued</a>, if not fully convinced, by him. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111031135122/http://www.christianpost.com/news/evangelical-donald-trump-needs-compelling-story-to-win-votes-49324/">Some said</a> he needed a compelling narrative to be able to lure voters to his side. Well lo and behold, here is that narrative: Trump gave a long interview to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111031135122/http://blogs.cbn.com/thebrodyfile/archive/2011/04/08/brody-file-exclusive-donald-trump-explains-pro-life-conversion.aspx">the Christian Broadcasting network</a>, during which he discussed his conversion from pro-choice to pro-life. Here was his explanation:</p>

<blockquote>One thing about me, I&apos;m a very honorable guy. I&apos;m pro-life, but I changed my view a number of years ago. One of the reasons I changed&#x2014;one of the primary reasons&#x2014;a friend of mine&apos;s wife was pregnant, in this case married.

<p>She was pregnant and he didn&apos;t really want the baby. And he was telling me the story. He was crying as he was telling me the story. He ends up having the baby and the baby is the apple of his eye. It&apos;s the greatest thing that&apos;s ever happened to him.</p>

<p>And you know here&apos;s a baby that wasn&apos;t going to be let into life. And I heard this, and some other stories, and I am pro-life.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>But this wasn&apos;t Trump&apos;s only trump card (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111031135122/http://instantrimshot.com/">instant rimshot!</a>). The bajillionaire real estate hairpiece has decided to attack NY Times columnist Gail Collins, who reveals the details behind a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111031135122/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/08/opinion/lweb08trump.html?_r=2">sternly-worded letter</a> Trump wrote in response to her column, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111031135122/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/02/opinion/02collins.html">&quot;Donald Trump Gets Weird.&quot;</a> Among other things, he wrote:</p>

<blockquote>Even before Gail Collins was with the New York Times, she has written nasty and derogatory articles about me.  Actually, I have great respect for Ms. Collins in that she has survived so long with so little talent. <strong>Her storytelling ability and word usage (coming from me, who has written many bestsellers), is not at a very high level.</strong></blockquote>

<p>Meow! The bestselling author then uses his extreme powers of storytelling and word usage to talk some more about the birther crap, which Collins eviscerates in turn in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111031135122/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/09/opinion/09collins.html">her followup column</a>. But back to Trump and his word usage: you know who came to mind as we read his sarcastic letter? Another <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111031135122/http://gothamist.com/tags/carlpaladino">titan of ridicule.</a></p>
