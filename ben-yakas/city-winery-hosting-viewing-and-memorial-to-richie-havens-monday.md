<p>Brooklyn-bred folk legend Richie Havens <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130601080652/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/22/richie_havens.php">passed away last Monday</a> at the age of 72. This Monday, fans will get a chance to say goodbye to him: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130601080652/http://www.citywinery.com/newyork/music-icon-richie-havens-memorial-viewing-at-city-winery-5-29.html">City Winery is hosting</a> an informal viewing of Havens&#x2019; ashes during &quot;an un-ticketed gathering of friends, food, wine, and music.&quot; </p>

<p>City Winery writes, &quot;Richie&#x2019;s presence will be greatly missed at City Winery.  We were fortunate to have him perform here for our Special 40th Anniversary Woodstock Celebration; he embodied the spirit that has been present in the venue since its creation.&quot; <br>
The event will include a full dinner and drinks menu, and Havens&apos; music will be played for all to enjoy. </p>

<p>Richie&apos;s family thanked fans in a statement for their support, and said that per his &quot;very specific wishes,&quot; he was cremated on Tuesday and his ashes were placed in a stone pyramid urn. &quot;Knowing Richie wanted a party rather than a somber memorial, we have decided to schedule a few public events because, as you all know, Richie considered the world his family, and each and every one of you his friends. We think he&apos;d be just fine with one last tour.&#x201D;</p>
