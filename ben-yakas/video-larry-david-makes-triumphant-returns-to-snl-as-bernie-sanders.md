<p>While Alec Baldwin <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171026015144/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/02/video_alec_baldwin_makes_his_debut.php">really did a fantastic job</a> as Donald Trump in the cold open of this weekend&apos;s season premiere of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171026015144/http://gothamist.com/tags/snl"><em>Saturday Night Live</em></a>, completely nailing Trump&apos;s appearance and tone, we were a bit sad to think that the now-classic political sketches between Larry David&apos;s Bernie Sanders and Kate McKinnon&apos;s Hillary Clinton were over. Those halcyon days of SNL season 41, with David flying in every three weeks or so to parody everyone&apos;s favorite socialist-leaning candidate before the Big Orange Monster won the nomination and made this election a horrorshow for the ages, seem so long ago already. </p>

<p>But thankfully, David can&apos;t quit SNL (or Lorne Michaels has some really good dirt on him), because he showed up for a <em>Family Feud: Political Edition</em> sketch featuring Trump and Hillary surrogates. Hearing him complain about elongated greetings makes us feel like we&apos;re home again.</p>

<p>This was another excellent sketch in a strong season premiere: besides the always-excellent David, Kate McKinnon got to play someone who is not Hillary (Trump campaign lunatic Kellyanne Conway), the Trump children made a very creepy cameo (played by Margot Robbie and two of the new cast members), Darrell Hammond (as Bill Clinton) made an appearance to remind us he still lurks backstage at Studio 8H, Cecily Strong unveiled her truly terrifying Lin-Manual Miranda impression, and best of all, Beck Bennett delivered the single best Vladimir Putin impression I have ever seen.</p>
