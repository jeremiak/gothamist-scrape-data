<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170107184517/http://gothamist.com/tags/stephencolbert">Stephen Colbert</a> returned from vacation this week with his own <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170107184517/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygdgOA4aIX0">Mariah Carey moment</a> and a whole lot of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170107184517/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoEKPPZFuZY">Oprah enthusiasm.</a> But like most of us, his attention is mostly turned toward the incessant Twitter blathering by our idiot President-elect. After talking a bit about the GOP&apos;s efforts to repeal Obamacare, he got into the upcoming inauguration and how the &quot;one little shadow hanging over the inauguration is the whole &apos;Russia chose our President&apos; thing.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Our entire intelligence community says that Russia hacked the Clinton campaign but Trump doesn&apos;t buy it,&quot; Colbert said, referencing a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170107184517/https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/816452807024840704">recent Trump tweet</a> (&quot;The &#x2018;Intelligence&#x2019; briefing on so-called &apos;Russian hacking&apos; was delayed until Friday, perhaps more time needed to build a case. Very strange!&quot;). &quot;Yes, I agree&#x2014;very strange for the future commander in chief to use sarcastic quotations about the intelligence agencies he will soon rely on,&quot; Colbert continued, providing his own scare quotes. &quot;Mr. Trump, you know you&apos;re not an outsider anymore shooting spitballs from the sidelines, right? In two weeks you&apos;ll be &apos;president&apos; of the &apos;United States.&apos;&quot;</p>

<p>Don&apos;t miss out on Colbert&apos;s description of Julian Assange as &quot;Hobo Anderson Cooper,&quot; as well as Trump following Emergency Kittens for the pics of cats grabbing humans: &quot;That must be strange for Trump to see, I mean, a man being grabbed by a pussy, that&apos;s so unusual.&quot; And in case you missed it, Colbert had even more on Trump&apos;s Twitter shade game in his monologue from earlier this week.</p>
