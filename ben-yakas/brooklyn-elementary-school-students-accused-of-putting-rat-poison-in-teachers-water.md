<p>Two Brooklyn elementary school students have been arrested for allegedly putting rat poison in their teacher&apos;s water. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140523194818/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2014/05/21/cops-brooklyn-fourth-graders-arrested-for-allegedly-trying-to-poison-teacher/">Cops say that</a> two boys, ages 9 and 12, allegedly put &quot;a substance consistent with rat poisoning&quot; in a 62-year-old teacher&apos;s water bottle at PS 315 in Flatbush on Monday morning. The accusations are serious enough they they have shaken one parent&apos;s faith in the future of humanity: &quot;I think it&apos;s horrible. I just heard about it and I&apos;m in shock, I&apos;m shaking,&quot; one parent told 1010 WINS. <strong>&quot;I was thinking that the children are the future and the future doesn&apos;t seem too promising right now with these things happening in school.&quot;</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140523194818/http://nypost.com/2014/05/21/students-put-rat-poison-in-teachers-water-at-school-cops/">The teacher said she</a> became nauseous after drinking the water; other students later came forward and said they saw the two boys put something in the water. The teacher was treated for her illness and has recovered; the day after the incident, she went to the 70th Precinct station house to report the incident.</p>

<p>The DOE said in a statement: &quot;We are greatly relieved that the teacher  is recovering and we continue to closely monitor this situation. Ensuring the safety of our entire schools community is our priority and while this matter is still under investigation, we will take swift and appropriate action.&quot;</p>

<p>The suspected students have been arrested and charged with reckless endangerment, assault and criminal possession of a weapon. Officials add that the bottle is currently being tested. </p>
