<p>A Brooklyn mom allegedly told police that she killed her 9-year-old son and then attempted to commit suicide by pills. The 40-year-old mother, whose name hasn&apos;t been released, called 911 just before 11 p.m. Friday; when cops arrived at her Bedford-Stuyvesant apartment, they found the child dead of apparent trauma to the head. Neighbor Maribel Otero <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141226033201/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20120707/bedford-stuyvesant/mother-allegedly-confesses-killing-9-year-old-taking-pills">told DNAInfo</a> the mother suffered from cancer: &quot;She had cancer that was eating her up alive, and she was getting smaller and smaller,&quot; she said.</p>

<p>The mother was still alive when police arrived; she was taken to Woodhull Medical Center, where she is currently under observation. Neighbors said she had a violent temper which got worse as her illness progressed; they also said she talked openly about seeking treatment for stomach cancer. &quot;Sometimes she pulled on her hair,&quot; said Raymond Espinal, store manager at nearby Tony&apos;s Grocery, She was smoking too much. No one smokes straight cigars.&quot; He added that the son came in to the store often: &quot;Sometimes he&apos;d come in and his face would look upset, so I&apos;d give him something,&quot; like a treat, said Espinal. &quot;I don&apos;t know what happened to the boy, he was really nice.&quot;</p>

<p>It&apos;s unclear if the father of the boy still lived with the family&#x2014;neighbors told DNAInfo that he was around, and would complain about his wife&apos;s unpredictable temper, while <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141226033201/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/new-york-episode-child-murder-days-brooklyn-mom-allegedly-kills-son-9-commit-suicide-article-1.1109576">the Daily News implied</a> they lived apart, because the child was set to spend this weekend with him.</p>

<p>This comes a day after another apparent murder-suicide attempt, when mom Lisette Bamenga <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141226033201/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/06/bronx_mom_fed_kids_chemical_de-icer.php">allegedly killed her two children</a> with &quot;a fatal drink containing chemical de-icer before slitting her wrists and turning on the gas on her stove.&quot;</p>
