<p>A sex worker who was kidnapped and raped while being held hostage for two terrible days broke her legs and back when she jumped out a sixth-floor window in an attempt to escape, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604141707/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/men-held-escort-hostage-2-days-article-1.1276776">prosecutors said yesterday</a>. Benjamin Gaston and Johnny Jackson have been charged with kidnapping and raping the 28-year-old woman, who was first held hostage in an apartment on W. 92nd Street and Columbus Avenue on November 12th around 4 a.m.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604141707/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/sex_slave_horror_story_c8lOgxg0yETk7v3v8qKZaJ">Prosecutors said that</a> Gaston, who allegedly called the woman to start things off, stole her cellphone, money and identification. They say he hit her and held a pillow over her face, telling her, &#x201C;You&#x2019;re not leaving the apartment &#x2014; you&#x2019;re working for me and making me money.&#x201D; The next day, the woman was taken to another apartment on W. 149th Street where there were six or seven additional men waiting to have sex with her, including Jackson. Gaston told her, &quot;You&apos;ll do what I say here.&quot;</p>

<p>The woman tried to escape however by using her jacket as a rope from the sixth floor apartment&#x2014;unfortunately, she fell to the ground, breaking both her legs and back.</p>

<p>Jackson told cops he was a dupe in the whole thing: &#x201C;A guy I know as Mike asked me if he could use my spare room to run his girl out of and make some money. I told him he could use the room in my apartment and he agreed to give me part of the profit,&#x201D; Jackson said in his statement. &#x201C;He brought a girl over and they stayed in my apartment from Tuesday at about 3 a.m. until Wednesday evening,&#x201D; he added.</p>

<p>&#x201C;My client is an honorably discharged Marine &#x2014; that&#x2019;s all I feel comfortable saying right now,&#x201D; Jackson&apos;s lawyer said. Both men are charged with kidnapping, sex trafficking, criminal sex act, rape and sex abuse. Gaston is also charged with assault. &#x201C;The facts of this crime are truly heinous - these defendants are accused of holding a woman hostage in order to essentially enslave and prostitute her,&#x201D; Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. added.</p>
