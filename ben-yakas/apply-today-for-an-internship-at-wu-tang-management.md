<p>If you aren&apos;t a student of the Wu-Tang Clan, then you should know that cash rules everything around you, so you <em>need</em> to start diversifying your bonds. But if you are an aficionado of everything RZA, GZA, Raekwon and Ghostface Killah, then perhaps it&apos;s time you put your superior Wu-knowledge to good use... as an intern at Wu-Tang Management on Staten Island. We thought this Craigslist post might be a joke, but we spoke with Anders (who posted the listing), and it&apos;s completely real: Wu-Tang Corp. are trying to fill three spots for an internship of an indeterminate amount of time. He told us that some interns <strong>&quot;may go on to become permanent.&quot;</strong> Check out the Wu-Tang job <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427002036/http://newyork.craigslist.org/stn/evg/2493873759.html">Craigslist posting</a> below, as well as a helpful video reminder that Wu Tang knows how to handle portfolios:</p>
