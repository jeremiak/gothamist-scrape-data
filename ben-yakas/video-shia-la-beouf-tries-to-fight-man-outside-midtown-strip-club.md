<p>Strawberry margarita aficionado Shia LaBeouf <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509222839/http://gothamist.com/2014/06/28/then_10_weirdest_parts_of_shia_labe.php">had a very busy week</a> chasing a homeless man around Times Square, smoking and groping his way through a performance of <em>Cabaret</em>, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509222839/http://gothamist.com/2014/06/27/shia_labeouf_allegedly_called_cop_a.php">spitting at cops</a> as he was hauled off to jail. It feels like this came out of nowhere, but there have been recent warning signs: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509222839/http://www.tmz.com/2014/06/29/shia-labeouf-fight-strip-club-nyc/">TMZ has released</a> a bizarre short video of LaBeouf in Midtown a week before his arrest trying to fight a bearded man outside a strip club.</p>

<p>The paparazzi have no idea why the fight was sparked: &quot;LaBeouf is taunting the guy ... trying to convince him to throw a punch,&quot; TMZ write. &quot;The photog says it&apos;s unclear why they were beefing ... moments later LaBeouf peaced out.&quot; He might be a spoiled, grandiose brat on an extended public breakdown who has shown serious signs of mental problems and alcohol dependency, but hey! At least he seems pretty good at shadowboxing!</p>
