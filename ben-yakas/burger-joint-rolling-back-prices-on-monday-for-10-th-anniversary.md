<p>It&apos;s hard to believe it&apos;s only been a decade, but not-so-secret midtown eatery <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429160441/http://www.parkermeridien.com/eat4.php">Burger Joint</a>, the greasy burger place located in the lobby of the fancy Le Parker Meridien Hotel, is celebrating its 10th anniversary on Monday. And they&apos;re offering a pretty sweet deal by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429160441/http://www.facebook.com/BurgerJoint">rolling back prices</a> to what they were when they first opened in 2002 all day on October 1st.</p>

<p>Starting at 11 a.m. on Monday, you can get $4 burgers, $4.50 cheeseburgers, $1.25 french fries, and $2 beer on tap. In addition, they&apos;re going to be selling (and giving away) special limited edition 10-year anniversary t-shirts. </p>
