Appropriately, the Times <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150829002730/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/12/education/12kindergarten.html?_r=1&amp;partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">has uncovered</a> a public school where some of Chua&apos;s work-first, play-never philosophies are being hammered out.</p>

<p>Parents of students at P.S. 101 in Forest Hills, also known as the School in the Gardens, are upset that their kids are making worksheets, not imaginative play. Up until recently, they even required students to form perfect lines at recess! Of course, having a school which values discipline and academic work is certainly different than a mother who inspires people to write, &quot;Hey, thanks for being a borderline pyscho stereotype in order to justify your shitty parenting, Amy Chua.&quot;</p>
