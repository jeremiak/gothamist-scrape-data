<p>If you reach back into the dark crevices of your memory to last September, you may recall that a man <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424155413/http://gothamist.com/2012/09/21/breaking_man_jumped_into_the_tiger.php">was mauled by a tiger after he jumped</a> out of the Bronx Zoo&#x2019;s Wild Asia Monorail and into a tiger den. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424155413/http://gothamist.com/tags/DavidVillalobos">David Villalobos</a>, 25, told police at the time that he jumped because he wanted &quot;to be one with the tiger,&quot; not because of any suicidal impulses. But his mother begs to differ: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424155413/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/bronx/bronx_zoo_tiger_saved_my_son_life_oooc8bK1afWH3J7YPxvG9H">she claims her son&apos;s mind</a> was warped because of Adderall addiction. And she thinks the tiger incident may have saved his life: &#x201C;He was always interested in animals, and we brought him up as a Christian, but Adderall changed his way of thinking,&#x201D; his mom, Fernanda, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424155413/http://www.lawyersandsettlements.com/articles/adderall/interview-adderall-lawsuit-heart-attack-7-18267.html?utm_expid=3607522-0&amp;utm_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F#.UTz3y3zohWk">told Lawyers and Settlements.</a></p>

<p>&quot;We don&#x2019;t fully understand why he jumped into the tiger den and I don&#x2019;t think David understands either, but there is an explanation, and I want this to be said in the courtroom: David said the voices told him to jump in,&quot; she added. &quot;He also told me that he had been planning this for about a year, coincidentally when he first started taking the Adderall.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Villalobos, who was mauled by an 11-year-old male Amur tiger named Bachuta on September 21st, suffered a broken right shoulder, right ankle, right rib and pelvis and a collapsed lung in the incident. He has pleaded not guilty to criminal trespassing at his arraignment, and is due back in court this Tuesday. </p>

<p>According to the Post, Villalobos <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424155413/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/11/bronx_zoo_jumper_hoping_to_make_som.php">has been thoroughly enjoying</a> his 15 minutes of fame: &#x201C;This is a good thing that happened; maybe I can make some money, write a book,&#x201D; Villalobos allegedly told workout buddies. Another friend told the Post he has bragged that the media won&#x2019;t stop calling him, adding that Villalobos was pleased over the fact cops and hospital personnel referred to him as &#x201C;Tarzan.&quot;</p>
