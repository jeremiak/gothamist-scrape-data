<p>In all of our years of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160115213712/http://gothamist.com/2005/08/16/subway_station_sex.php">reporting on</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160115213712/http://gothamist.com/2010/12/12/nsfw_couple_gets_overly_raunchy_on.php#photo-1">other people</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160115213712/http://gothamist.com/2012/11/30/two_young_ladies_filmed_giving_thei.php">hooking up</a> in our <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160115213712/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/05/straphangers_report_the_subway_cont.php">horribly unsanitary</a> mass transit system, there have been very few hard and fast rules (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160115213712/http://instantrimshot.com/">Nailed it</a>).

<p>They don&apos;t even have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160115213712/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCjYRd43tpw">the decency to wear masks</a> while humping! Why would you even <em>want</em> to get shtupped on the stairs? Why would you choose to dry hump on stairs? This is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160115213712/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCZesbr9iss">literally a scene from <em>The Room</em></a> come to life. Don&apos;t these people care about their latissimus dorsi? It would take a truly sick and twisted individual to dream up a scenario in which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160115213712/http://death-by-styles.tumblr.com/post/29666820533/one-shot-game-request-sex-on-the-stairs">smashing body parts together on stairs could possibly induce orgiastic levels of sexual gratification.</a></p>
