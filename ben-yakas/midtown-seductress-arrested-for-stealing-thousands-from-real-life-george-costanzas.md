<p>A woman has been accused of seducing and then ripping off thousands of dollars worth of cash and jewelry from unsuspecting tourists and locals. Quying Boyd, 34, was arrested this week for perpetrating the scam on at least three men in the last two months in midtown Manhattan. We have exclusive footage of one of those encounters below.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425172848/http://nypost.com/2014/05/01/tourists-thought-theyd-get-lucky-but-got-robbed-instead/">Police tell the Post that</a> Boyd first met a 36-year-old Manhattan man at the Chelsea club Avenue on March 15th; he took her back to his apartment across town, &quot;fell asleep,&quot; and found out the next day that his debit card and a $2,500 Celine handbag were missing. Police say Boyd was spotted on surveillance tape using the card to buy more than $500 worth of items at a CVS on Park Avenue South soon after.</p>

<p>Four days after that encounter, Boyd allegedly targeted a 40-year-old tourist. She went back to his hotel room, ordered him to shower, and when he got out, said she was going to get a girlfriend to bring up. He realized about 15 minutes later that 4,500 euros and his Australian passport were missing.</p>

<p>Then on April 1st, Boyd allegedly met a 53-year-old man who brought her back to the Benjamin Hotel, where he was staying. She also ordered him to take a shower; when he got out, she abruptly left. He then discovered $42,200 worth of goods had been taken from a locked safe in the room. </p>

<p>Boyd, who had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425172848/http://mugshot-catalogs.com/booking/4782801/Quying-Boyd">previously been arrested in 2013,</a> was ultimately caught when a security guard at Avenue recognized her on April 29th, and notified cops. She has been hit with several grand larceny charges, and police are investigating to determine whether there are other men she seduced and abandoned.</p>

<p>The moral of this story? Never trust anyone who asks you to shower.</p>
