title: Video: Amazing Footage Of Sun Cutting The Solar Cheese

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:250px; "> <img alt="6811solarstorm.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130511045241im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/6811solarstorm.jpg" width="250" height="253"> <br> <i>AP</i></div> Yesterday, NASA captured some really cool footage of the sun unleashing a massive solar flare, the biggest such eruption scientists have ever seen on the sun. According <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130511045241/http://www.weather.com/outlook/videos/massive-solar-storm-20902#20902">to Weather.com</a>, it emitted &quot;a spectacular coronal mass ejection. The cloud of particles covered an area of nearly half the sun&apos;s surface. A solar flare is an intense burst of radiation that can last from minutes to hours.&quot; <p></p>

<p>Scientists <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130511045241/http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2011/06/110608-solar-flare-sun-science-space/">told National Geographic</a> they were amazed by the event: &quot;This totally caught us by surprise. There wasn&apos;t much going on with this spot, but as it came from behind the sun, all of the sudden there was a flare and huge ejection of particles. We&apos;ve never seen a [coronal mass ejection] this enormous,&quot; said astrophysicist Phillip Chamberlin of NASA&apos;s Solar Dynamics Observatory, one of several spacecrafts that recorded the event. Maybe the sun was just trying to rebuild the ozone layer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130511045241/http://www.goofball.com/jokes/tasteless/Euphemisms_for_FARTING">one poof at a time</a>? Watch two different videos of the event below:</p>

<p>Bad Astronomy blogger Phil Plait <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130511045241/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2011/06/07/the-sun-lets-loose-a-huge-explosion/">said the prominence</a> (a physical eruption of gas from the surface) wasn&apos;t dangerous&#x2014;but it was truly ginormous: &quot;<em>This event blasted something like a billion tons of material away from the Sun.</em> Note the size of it, too: while it started from a small region on the Sun&#x2019;s surface, it quickly expanded into a plume easily as big as the Sun itself! I&#x2019;d estimate its size at well over a million kilometers across.&quot;</p>

<p>Most of the material fell back down to the Sun&#x2019;s surface. Amazingly, this was only classified as a medium-sized solar flare...and yet, this was the equivalent of billions of nuclear bombs exploding. Hopefully this doesn&apos;t mean we&apos;re in store for another Nuclear Man situation, and some ill-advised <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130511045241/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superman_IV:_The_Quest_for_Peace">Quest For Peace</a><a>, in the near future.

<p>And just think: maybe this was only 10-15 percent of the sun&apos;s total expulsion. Maybe it was just making sure that all the planets around it could handle it:</p>
