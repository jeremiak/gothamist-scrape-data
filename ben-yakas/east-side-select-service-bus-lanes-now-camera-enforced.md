										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="111810bus.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150901094847im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/111810bus.jpg" width="100" height="132" class="image-right"> </span>The MTA is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150901094847/http://gothamist.com/2010/10/20/select_bus_service_gets_more_buses.php">very serious</a> about you taking their new SBS M15 Bus Service Lanes seriously. They don&apos;t want you parking your cars or your bikes or you butts in the lane, and they don&apos;t want you driving in it (except to make immediate right turns). Today, they announced that camera enforcement of the Service Lanes along First and Second avenues will formally begin this Monday. And it&apos;ll come with a stiff penalty: any unauthorized use of the bus lanes is subject to a $115 ticket. The MTA has also begun a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150901094847/http://www.streetsblog.org/2010/11/11/bus-lane-cameras-go-live-amid-mta-media-blitz/">charm offensive online</a>, putting up banners ads which read, &#x201C;Riding the bus costs $2.25. Driving in the bus lane costs $115. Bus lanes will now be camera-enforced.&quot; So you have till this Monday to doing something really transgressive in the bus lane unencumbered by the watchful eye of Big Brother.</p>
