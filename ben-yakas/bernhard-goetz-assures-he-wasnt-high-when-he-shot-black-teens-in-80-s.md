<p>On Friday, notorious &quot;subway vigilante&quot; Bernhard Goetz, whose name is practically synonymous with the Bad Old Days&#x2122; of NYC, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504132744/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/02/bernhard_goetz_busted_selling_pitif.php">was busted allegedly selling a very small amount of pot</a> to an undercover cop in Union Square. Goetz has been charged with misdemeanor sale and possession of marijuana for the incident. After he was released from jail yesterday, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504132744/http://nypost.com/2013/11/03/bernie-goetz-i-wasnt-high-when-i-fired-away-in-1984/">he assured the Post that</a> he wasn&apos;t high when he shot four black teens on the subway in 1984: &#x201C;What an odd question! Of course not!&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;I shouldn&#x2019;t have said, &#x2018;Of course not.&#x2019; But to perform as good as that, with shooting, I don&#x2019;t think you could do it stoned.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504132744/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Bernie-Goetz-Arrested-Selling-Pot-Union-Square-230335291.html">Cops say that</a> Goetz, 65 (he turns 66 next Thursday), met the undercover female officer at 15th Street and Fifth Avenue near his Union Square apartment around 5:45 p.m. on Friday. After chatting for a bit, the two walked back to Goetz&apos;s apartment to get $30 worth of weed to allegedly sell to her. &#x201C;It sounds like he was definitely trying to pick her up,&#x201D; a source told The Post. &#x201C;But what a pickup line &#x2014; give me $30.&quot;</p>

<p>&#x201C;This is stupid. I shouldn&#x2019;t have done it,&#x201D; Goetz told cops while in custody, according to the prosecution&#x2019;s account of his arrest. &#x201C;That was all the marijuana I have. I don&#x2019;t have any more.&#x201D; After being released without bail, Goetz compared being locked up to the treatment of carriage horses: &#x201C;You know how some people complain about the way carriage horses are treated? That they are in a small stall? That is mistreatment,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;In a holding cell, you get very bored. You have no newspapers, you have no anything.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Goetz, who is an animal rights activist, also waxed poetic about his love for Union Square park squirrels: &#x201C;I go to Union Square Park, mostly to take care of squirrels. There is a black squirrel that I rescued many months ago who wound up leaving me and wound up in Union Square, and I was taking care of him. And then a few days ago somebody released a little, much smaller, black squirrel &#x2014; which was unprepared &#x2014; and I&#x2019;ve been spending a lot of time looking for that one.&#x201D;</p>
