<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="102110turnpike.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811075058im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/102110turnpike.jpg" width="200" height="168" class="image-left"> </span>Today in stories-to-get-your-blood-boiling: according to a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811075058/http://www.myfoxny.com/dpp/traffic/traffic_news/audit-excessive-perks-for-nj-turnpike-employees-20101019-apx">new audit</a>, the NJ Turnpike has wasted more than $43 million on unnecessary bonuses and perks for employees, even as it has raised toll prices for commuters. Wouldn&apos;t that money be better used going toward getting the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811075058/http://gothamist.com/2010/10/09/trans-hudson_tunnel_not_dead_yet.php">Hudson Tunnel project</a> back up, or wooing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811075058/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/25/nets_inching_closer_to_carmelo_anth.php">Carmelo Anthony</a>, or making the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811075058/http://gothamist.com/tags/jerseyshore"><em>Jersey Shore</em></a> go away forever?</p>

<p>That includes more than $30 million in unjustified bonuses to employees and management in 2008 and 2009; commuters paid for an employee bowling league ($12,000), free E-Z Passes ($430,000), and employee bonuses for working on birthdays and holidays. One employee with a base salary of $73,469 earned $321,985 in a year when all bonuses were included. For comparison, that engorged amount is more than twice as much as the already unnecessarily large amount the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811075058/http://gothamist.com/2010/08/09/new_otb_boss_to_be_paid_125000_a_mo.php">head of the OTB</a> makes!</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811075058/http://gothamist.com/2008/10/10/toll_increases_for_garden_state_par.php">In 2008</a>, the Turnpike toll increased by more than 50 percent, and it is expected to be raised again in 2012 to help deal with NJ&apos;s $11 billion budget gap. &quot;While tolls are going up, the Turnpike Authority is overpaying its employees, overpaying its management, overpaying for its health plan and overpaying for legal services,&quot; said Comptroller Matt Boxer. If <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811075058/http://gothamist.com/2010/10/13/emperor_paladino_vows_to_crush_mta.php">Emperor Paladino</a> were in charge over there, he&apos;d whip this sinkhole of money into shape in no time.</p>
