										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="2213superbowl.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160210152617im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/2213superbowl.jpg" width="640" height="441"> <br> <i> AP</i></div> <p></p>

<p>Every year, the internet celebrates the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160210152617/http://gothamist.com/tags/superbowl">Super Bowl</a> in the trolliest way imaginable: by mocking/emulating the Huffington Post&apos;s infamous &quot;What Time Does The Superbowl Start&quot; SEO-baiting headline from 2011. If you&apos;re like us, then you long for a world in which every website could somehow just reprint that post every year. Thankfully, that is <em>exactly</em> the kind of world we live in. Below, our crack team of SEO scientists have compiled a list of the nine best Super Bowl time-seeking headlines of 2013.</p>

<p>Just to back things up for a moment: as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160210152617/http://deadspin.com/5881720/what-time-does-the-super-bowl-start-he-wrote-as-a-headline-to-game-the-google-results">Deadspin previously summarized</a>, the Huffington Post post existed &quot;for the sole purpose of garnering internet search traffic from the thousands of people Googling &apos;what time does the superbowl start?&apos;&quot; And because it garnered so many hits in such a blatant, whorey manner, everyone has been doing their best to copy it the past two years. That includes us too (although at least <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160210152617/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/05/what_time_does_the_super_bowl_end.php">we tweaked the formula</a> in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160210152617/http://dcist.com/2013/01/what_time_is_the_inauguration_and_o.php">different ways</a>)! Without further adieu, here are this year&apos;s best imitators and homages.</p>

<p>We&apos;d be remiss in not mentioning that this website exists: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160210152617/http://whattimedoesthesuperbowlstart.com/">http://whattimedoesthesuperbowlstart.com.</a> Hilariously, it lists the start time incorrectly, because it&apos;s a perfect thing.</p>

<p>No doubt, there&apos;ll be more of these headlines tomorrow morning (we know we have something in store!). And in case you were still wondering what time it starts: 6:30 p.m. EST. Now as for the tougher question of what time it ends... our best guess? It&apos;s probably occurring simultaneously to our writing about it now, as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160210152617/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternalism_(philosophy_of_time)">Eternalism</a> and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160210152617/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-theory_of_time">B-theory of time</a> might suggest. Therefore, it&apos;s already over and never over, all at once. You&apos;re welcome.</p>
