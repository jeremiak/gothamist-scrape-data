Cuddling with an animal (while under enough sheets to start <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406162101/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbmzHuDAvQo">your own blanket town</a>). So here&apos;s your chance to get your very own winter buddy: police rescued the nine kittens you see above, who are all 3 months old, from an unhealthy living situation, and now the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406162101/http://www.aspca.org/blog/referral-nypd-leads-aspca-rescue-nine-kittens-hoarding-situation">ASPCA is looking for permanent homes</a> for them.</p>

<p>All nine are named after Winter Olympics gold-medal winners: Apollo (Anton Ohno), Aksel (Svindal), Shaun (White), Tara (Lipinski), Sasha (Cohen), Oksana (Baiul), and Adam (Foote). You may note that there are only seven names there, but no worries: they all kind of look identical and are hard to keep track of (except for the orange tabby, who is definitely named Adam). And you can always re-name them Fido or Spot or Ms. Claws &apos;n&apos; Paws or whatever once you adopt them, which you should, because they are great kittens who deserve a shot at a loving owner, and you, dear reader, will certainly do in that department.</p>

<p>If you&apos;re interested in adopting one of them, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406162101/http://www.aspca.org/adopt">visit the ASPCA website</a> or call (212) 876-7700 ext. 4900. </p>
