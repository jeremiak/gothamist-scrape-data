<p>A NJ Transit officer was able to pull a man off the train tracks in Secaucus this weekend, saving the man seconds before a train pulled in. </p>

<p>Officer Victor Ortiz, a 16 year veteran of the NJ Transit Police Department (NJTPD), climbed down from the platform to the tracks at the Secaucus Junction terminal on Friday. NJ Transit police said Ortiz had been called after the man got into a confrontation on a commuter train, then gave chase before lying down on the tracks. </p>

<p>As you can see <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110093922/http://abc7ny.com/news/nj-transit-police-officer-hailed-as-hero-for-saving-man-from-oncoming-train/1488369/">in the video below</a>, the man appears to be refusing to move, but Ortiz is able to pull him away mere moments before the train barrels through. </p>

<p>&quot;NJ Transit could not be more proud of Victor Ortiz and of the New Jersey Transit Police Department and we hope this serves as a stark reminder of what these men and women do every single day to keep us safe throughout this state,&#x201D; NJ Transit said <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110093922/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2016/08/28/nj-transit-officer-saves-man/">in a statement.</a></p>

<p>&quot;Everyday when we put on our uniforms and go to work we do not know the situations that await us, and we must be prepared for anything,&quot; added NJ Transit PBA Local 304 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110093922/http://nj1015.com/watch-moment-nj-transit-cop-pulls-man-off-tracks-split-seconds-from-death/">in a statement</a>. &quot;Without regard for his own safety, Officer Ortiz acted quickly and heroically and was able to pull a man from the train tracks just seconds before a train passed through. We commend Officer Ortiz for his bravery and heroism!&quot;</p>
