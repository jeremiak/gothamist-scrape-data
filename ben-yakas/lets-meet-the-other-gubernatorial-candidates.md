</div></div>					<p>Almost at the same time that Carl Paladino&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160306044752/http://gothamist.com/2010/10/07/paladinos_tv_announcement_revealed.php">television address</a> was going out yesterday, Hofstra University and Newsday <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160306044752/http://eon.businesswire.com/news/eon/20101007006895/en/News-12-Newsday-Hofstra-University-Partner-Bring">announced</a> they would be holding the first (and only?) official debate of the 2010 NY gubernatorial race, and everybody was invited. Paladino was the only one of the seven candidates who hadn&apos;t agreed to the debate as of yesterday, though he has now, no thanks to Cuomo&apos;s shiftiness! Campaign manager Michael Caputo <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160306044752/http://www.nydailynews.com/blogs/dailypolitics/2010/10/team-paladino-on-debating-its.html">told the News</a>: &quot;Andrew Cuomo is playing games with the voters. His fear of addressing the issues has been clear for weeks, and <strong>he accepted the Newsday debate only when he heard Carl had a scheduling conflict. Well, that&apos;s no problem. We&apos;ve changed our plans to accommodate Cuomo&apos;s busy schedule hiding from the voters</strong>.&quot; So let&apos;s meet the candidates who aren&apos;t Paladino and Cuomo!</p>
