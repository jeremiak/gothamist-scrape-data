title: Is A-Rod's Baseball Career Turning Into A Giant Insurance Scam?

                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="110312arod.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130731072623im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_arts_john/110312arod.jpg" width="640" height="515"> <br> <i> (AP)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>This week, the hobbled <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130731072623/http://gothamist.com/tags/alexrodriguez">Alex Rodriguez</a> jumped back into the headlines thanks to some overexcited tweeting about his rehab process that led to Yankees management asking him <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130731072623/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/26/livid_yankees_gm_tells_loose-lipped.php">to kindly &quot;shut the f*** up.&quot;</a> Both sides have spent the last 24 hours trying to walk back that tense public moment, but it&apos;s pretty clear that there&apos;s a major fracture in the A-Rod/Yankees relationship. And it&apos;s starting to appear like the whole thing is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130731072623/http://deadspin.com/the-alex-rodriguez-saga-is-turning-ugly-595981348">turning into a giant insurance scam.</a></p>

<p>There are now two schools of thought about what&apos;s happening behind-the-scenes between the sides: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130731072623/http://espn.go.com/new-york/mlb/story/_/id/9426595/alex-rodriguez-thinks-new-york-yankees-slowing-return-injury-according-source">ESPN sources</a> (likely someone close to A-Rod&apos;s camp) say that A-Rod thinks the Yankees don&apos;t want him back this season so they can collect insurance. &quot;Alex thinks there&apos;s something really off about this situation,&quot; a source told them. &quot;Here we have a doctor declaring him fit to play. You think they would be happy about that.&quot; GM Brian Cashman&apos;s &quot;over the top&quot; response to his tweet cemented his belief that the Yankees have been looking for ways to rid themselves of his albatross-like, $275 million contract: &quot;Alex thinks it&apos;s all about the insurance,&quot; the source said. &quot;How could it not be?&quot;</p>

<p>But on the other hand, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130731072623/http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/i-team/sources-a-rod-hoping-cash-114-m-mlb-nails-article-1.1383664">the Daily News&apos; sources</a> (likely someone close to the Yankees camp) say that A-Rod fears <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130731072623/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/04/a-rod_could_face_100_game_suspensio.php">a long ban due to HGH</a>, and is hoping to cash out and retire with four years left on his contract. If he retires, then he can still get the $86 million he&apos;s owed from 2014-2017&#x2014;and 80 percent would be covered by insurance, which would be a boon to the organization.</p>

<p>So now, two days after he tweeted how excited he was to start playing again, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130731072623/http://www.nypost.com/p/sports/yankees/rod_tells_yankees_he_not_healthy_1AxuB9Cz89HV3w3hUjCEWL">sources tell the Post</a> that&apos;s not the case: &#x201C;He is not ready to play in games,&#x2019;&#x2019; a person with knowledge of the conversation said. &#x201C;He is worried about his health.&#x2019;&#x2019; But the Daily News&apos; source claims it&apos;s all about the money: &#x201C;It&#x2019;s all about him getting his money and not losing it to suspension,&#x201D; their source said. <strong>&#x201C;He knows he&#x2019;s never going to the Hall of Fame. All that&#x2019;s left for him is to make sure he gets his money &#x2014; all of it.&#x201D;</strong></p>
