<p>Two Brooklyn men have been arrested for allegedly brutally beating a Massachusetts man in Greenwich Village early Sunday morning. According to police, 24-year-old victim Kevin McCarron was bashed with a tire iron, baseball bat, and other assault weapons, as well as punched and stomped repeatedly by a gang of men around 5:15 a.m. Sunday in front of Artichoke Pizza on MacDougal Street. You can see a bit of the beating in the graphic cell phone video below. &#x201C;I started screaming for someone to call the police,&#x201D;the 25-year-old woman who recorded the incident <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131010224356/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/man-beaten-bat-tire-iron-village-article-1.1240933">told the News</a>. &#x201C;It was hard to watch.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Police say McCarron was knocked unconscious after the verbal altercation descended into a physical one. He was taken to NY Presbyterian Hospital in critical condition; they noted that he is still listed in critical condition three days later. Six other men who were with McCarron, including his relative Patrick McCarron, all suffered minor injuries. </p>

<p>Two men from Brooklyn have been apprehended and charged in the incident so far. Hatem Farsakh, 24, has been charged with attempted murder and assault. Sherif Rizk, 22, has been charged with gang assault one, assault, and attempted murder. Police noted that those charges are subject to change depending on the condition of the victim. The investigation is still ongoing.</p>

<p>It&apos;s not entirely clear what prompted the assault, but witnesses told the News that one of the attackers may have been sitting on top of the car McCarron and his friends drove into the city that evening. After the verbal confrontation, at least seven attackers grabbed the weapons from the back of another car, beating McCarron unconscious and fracturing his skull. &#x201C;I&#x2019;ve been doing this job for a few years now and I have never seen such a brutal fight,&#x201D; a bouncer at a nearby bar told the News.</p>
