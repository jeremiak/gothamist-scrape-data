<p>This morning, a man <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130326195633/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/20/breaking_person_reportedly_struck_a.php">was fatally struck</a> by an F train in Queens after he reportedly jumped in front of the subway&#x2014;and now there are reports that a man in Manhattan has been injured after falling onto the subway tracks. According the FDNY, the incident happened around 12:15 p.m. at the 59th Street station at Columbus Circle. FDNY said they believed the man had fallen onto the tracks, and was then place on the platform.</p>

<p>They add he was still conscious, though he suffered head injuries. He was taken to Roosevelt Hospital. At least one witness had tweeted that the person <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130326195633/https://twitter.com/alexserna34/status/304278075879854080">jumped in front of a northbound 1 train</a>, but the FDNY didn&apos;t believe that was true. The MTA adds there are delays on the 1 line as a result.</p>
