<p>The beluga whales at Mystic Aquarium have done a lot of adorable things over the years, especially when they&apos;re being serenaded by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141022184004/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/03/video_mariachi_band_serenades_juno.php">mariachi bands</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141022184004/http://gothamist.com/2014/03/15/video_bagpiper_serenades_delighted.php">bagpipers.</a> They continued their cute streak in the newly-uploaded clip below, in which 11-foot Juno thoroughly entertains a group of tiny humans. There sure is nothing as delightful as the delightful screams of delighted children. </p>

<p>The only slight problem? We&apos;re not sure if it really was just &quot;playing.&quot; Mom Michelle Cotton, who took the video, insists that the whale was &apos;teasing&quot; her kids. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141022184004/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/video-mystic-aquarium-beluga-whale-plays-peek-a-boo-kids-article-1.1913149">Daily News calls it</a> a game, saying Juno was &quot;pretending to be a ghost, and says &apos;Boo.&apos;&quot; </p>

<p>But, as many commenters pointed out, that &quot;boo&quot; could just as likely be a blood-curdling war cry. As one person writes, Juno appears to be &quot;completely stressed and that is a very aggressive gesture toward the head of an enemy.&quot; Another person posits that Juno may have actually wanted to <em>eat</em> the children. </p>

<p>Then again, judging by the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141022184004/https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=juno+mystic">many videos online</a>, Juno plays around with a lot of people (mostly kids) without resorting to war cries, and has seemingly learned how to get a reaction out of them. Either way, the video is still pretty adorable thanks to the kids... even if we&apos;re starting to get the distinct feeling that Juno might be a real life Bender.</p>
