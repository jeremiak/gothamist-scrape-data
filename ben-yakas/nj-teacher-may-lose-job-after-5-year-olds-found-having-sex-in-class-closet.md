<p>A NJ teacher may lose her job after two 5-year-olds in her kindergarten class were found naked in a class closet &quot;having sex.&quot; Kelly Mascio, who has taught for more than 15 years at schools in Mullica Township, was suspended without pay last fall after she found the two children, a boy and girl, naked in her classroom bathroom. They explained to Mascio that they were &quot;having sex.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140424033007/http://www.pressofatlanticcity.com/news/breaking/mullica-kindergarten-teacher-could-be-fired-after-finding-students-naked/article_b490fb50-9b8e-11e3-9687-0019bb2963f4.html">According to The Press Of Atlantic City</a>, Mascio immediately reported the incident to Principal Matthew Mazzoni. The police investigated, but found no reason to press criminal charges. Nevertheless, the Mullica Township Board of Education voted this week to bring charges against Mascio through the state to seek to remove her from her position.</p>

<p>Two-hundred people reportedly came out to support Mascio at the meeting: &quot;Our main concern is that the administration has completely forgone all traditional disciplinary avenues available in handling the incident,&quot; said Mullica Township Education Association President Barbara Rheault.</p>

<p>There have been several similar high profile incidents in NYC in recent years: a Queens mom claimed her kindergartner <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140424033007/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/07/kindergartners_mom_says_classmates.php">was sodomized by</a> a gang of 6 and 7-year-olds in a school bathroom. Although <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140424033007/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/08/doe_dismisses_5-year-olds_rape_alle.php">the DOE dismissed</a> those rape allegations, the mom <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140424033007/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/30/mom_sues_city_for_letting_children.php">sued the city</a> for $10 million dollars. And parents of students <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140424033007/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/05/kindergartners_caught_doing_hanky-p.php">in a Washington Heights kindergarten class were enraged</a> after they heard that their children were caught touching and kissing each other in school. </p>
