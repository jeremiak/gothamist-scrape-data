Firefighters are battling a five-alarm fire in a building in Morningside Heights this morning. According to the FDNY, the fire broke out in the basement of a CitiBank on Broadway near West 111th Street around 5:20 a.m. They added that over 120 firefighters have been called to the scene. &quot;It&apos;s a very stubborn fire in a secure building,&quot; an FDNY spokesman told us.</p>

<p>So far, four civilians have been treated for smoke inhalation, and three firefighters have been taken to St. Luke&apos;s Hospital with various minor injuries. Firefighters are still battling the blaze as of 11:15 a.m. So far, it&apos;s unclear what sparked the fire.</p>
