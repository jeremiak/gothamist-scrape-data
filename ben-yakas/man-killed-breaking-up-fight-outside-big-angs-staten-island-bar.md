<p>A man was killed after he tried to break up a fight outside of the Staten Island bar owned by reality TV star Big Ang Raiola. Police say that the 46-year-old victim was found unconscious with severe head trauma outside The Drunken Monkey Bar &amp; Grill in West Brighton around 3:40 a.m. Sunday. &quot;Someone apparently struck him and he cracked his skull on the pavement,&quot; Sgt. Lee Jones <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140613011359/http://www.silive.com/northshore/index.ssf/2014/06/man_killed_trying_to_break_up.html#incart_m-rpt-1">told SILive.</a></p>

<p>Detectives believe that two other men had gotten into a fight in the bar that spilled into the street; they believe the victim was trying to intervene and stop the fight when he was punched. SI Live has descriptions of the perps:</p>

<blockquote>One of the men is described as a 6-foot, 150 pound Hispanic with short black hair and a goatee, wearing a black t-shirt. Police described the other man as a stocky 5-foot-9-inch, 200 pound Caucasian with a shaved head, who was wearing a gray t-shirt with red stripes.</blockquote>

<p>No arrests have been made, and the investigation is ongoing. Big Ang, who came to fame as a star of VH1&apos;s <em>Mob Wives</em>, opened the bar in 2007; she recently <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140613011359/http://gothamist.com/2014/05/06/photos_opening_night_at_big_angs_br.php">opened another location in DUMBO.</a></p>
