<p>Two twin baby boys <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150103064717/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/bronx/baby-tossed-safety-burning-apartment-article-1.1551367">were thrown out of a burning building</a> in The Bronx early this morning&#x2014;and they were thankfully caught by a mailman. Postal worker Jermaine Shirley, 30, first got his wife and child out of their building after smelling smoke around 7 a.m. at 870 E. 220th Street in Williamsbridge. Then he heard neighbor Everdean Codner, 32, calling for help&#x2014;he was on the third floor with his two sons, 11-month-old Israel and Ishmeal Codner. </p>

<p>&quot;They dropped the babies down and I catch them. I just thank God that everyone is safe&#x2014;my wife and kid&#x2014;everyone is safe. I would want everyone to do the same for me,&#x201D; Shirley <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150103064717/http://nypost.com/2013/12/18/hero-catches-twin-babies-from-burning-apartment/">told the Post.</a></p>

<p>&quot;I was ready to catch. One of them, he kind of flipped a little because he was in a full &#x2018;onesie&#x2019; suit, but I catch him,&quot; Shirley added. Codner then had to jump down from the third floor himself. &quot;I thank Jermaine for saving my babies. Now I have a second chance to be a father to my sons,&#x201D; Codner said, describing the fire as terrifying. &quot;The smoke was heavy, it pushed us back inside. I wanted to get my babies out and I ran to the fire escape. I just dropped them. Thank God they are okay,&quot; he said.</p>

<p>The boys were taken to Jacobi Medical Center for evaluation but did not appear injured. Three other people did suffer minor injuries in the blaze. </p>
