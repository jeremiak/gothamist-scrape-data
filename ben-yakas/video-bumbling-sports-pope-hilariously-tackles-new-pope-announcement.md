<p>WFAN&apos;s Mike Francesa is a NY treasure&#x2014;he&apos;s a real life Abe Simpson granted the ego of Kent Brockman, and he happens to also be a semi-beloved sports radio personality. He thinks he&apos;s a genius, while many of his listeners <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130517181651/http://deadspin.com/5982536/mike-francesas-first-two-callers-berated-him-about-stuttering-and-weather-forecasting">just love trolling him on air.</a> But Francesa topped himself yesterday when he interrupted his usual sports talk to report on the new pope...only to realize he has no idea how to pronounce <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130517181651/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/13/white_smoke_means_weve_got_a_new_po.php#photo-1">Jorge Mario Bergoglio&apos;s</a> name. But he didn&apos;t let that deter him!</p>

<p>Before his hilarious attempts at pronouncing the name, Francesa analyzed the conclave as if it were the Hall of Fame induction, wondering, &#x201C;I wonder if you come in the top three of four, does that mean you have a better chance the next time?&#x201D; White smoke looks dark to him! We have a pope! How many votes did it take! He better not be old! </p>

<p>You can listen to the whole ridiculous segment below. We&apos;re just happy that Francesa didn&apos;t ask <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130517181651/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/13/21_people_who_dont_know_what_a_pope.php">is pope human god?</a></p>
