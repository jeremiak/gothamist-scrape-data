<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="12211stripper.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412180056im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/12211stripper.jpg" width="110" height="154" class="image-right"> </span></p>

<p>One of the two strippers from Big Daddy Lou&apos;s Hot Lap Dance Club who were accused and ultimately <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412180056/http://gothamist.com/2010/01/23/stripper_gets_off_scot-free_in_pros.php">acquitted</a> of prostitution charges a year ago has decided to get all hot and litigious. Falynn Rodriguez is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412180056/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2011/01/21/2011-01-21_stripper_falynn_rodriguez_sues_city_for_5m_over_prostitution_charges.html">suing the city</a> for $5 million over her prior arrest. Rodriguez and porn star Alexia Moore were embroiled in the confusing prostitution case, which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412180056/http://gothamist.com/2010/01/21/stripper_prostitution_trial_off_to.php">included</a> semantic errors in the prosecution&apos;s court filings, lesbian defense strategies, and ultimately, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412180056/http://gothamist.com/2010/12/16/pimp_lawyer_big_lou_loses_law_licen.php">downfall</a> of Big Daddy Lou Posner himself. </p>

<p>Rodriguez must have been inspired by the case: she is now accusing the NYPD and the Manhattan District Attorney&apos;s office of bringing trumped-up charges against her which have destroyed her good name, costing her a &quot;loss of reputation and credit, humiliation and mental suffering.&quot; Because really, she&apos;d like to return to her stripping job with some dignity.</p>
