<p>It&apos;s been just over a month since we closed the book on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028104028/http://gothamist.com/tags/saturdaynightlive"><em>Saturday Night Live</em></a> season 41, celebrating the finest of the season with roundups of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028104028/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/02/the_best_live_sketches_of_saturday.php">best live sketches</a> and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028104028/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/01/best_snl_season_41.php">best pre-taped segments.</a></p>

<p>On the opposite end of the spectrum from instant classics such as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028104028/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nn4tP7ogWIA">&quot;Bern Your Enthusiasm,&quot;</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028104028/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ie6LpKOJVf0">&quot;Farewell Mr. Bunting&quot;</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028104028/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJEAGd1bQuc">&quot;Meet Your Second Wife,&quot;</a> there is the treasure trove of cut-for-time sketches that never quite made it to air. It&apos;s a fascinating glimpse into the SNL process, with several of these sketches getting cut during showtime with one host, then re-tried with another host a few weeks later, only to get cut again. Some of the sketches are complete failures or one-note riffs; others are just a little too weird even for the 10-to-1 slot at the end of the show. And there are a couple that&apos;ll make you throw your hands up in the air and wonder how they could have dropped it in favor of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028104028/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/10/snl_videos_russell_crowe.php#photo-6">Horny Henry VIII.</a></p>

<p>SNL has been selectively putting a few online all season, but have really gone wild since the season ended, with five cut-for-time sketches (and one video of &quot;bonus footage&quot;) being put up in the past month. Below, you can watch all 15 cut-for-time sketches that have been released so far.</p>

<p>First up: Drake is the new guy at the office, and he is having a hard time understanding his coworkers&apos; lingo.</p>

<p>Beck Bennett&apos;s character Johnny really doesn&apos;t understand the concept of roasting in this sketch from Chris Hemsworth&apos;s episode. If you like cringe comedy, this is one of the best of the cut-for-time sketches.</p>

<p>Mooney and Beckett, the kings of cut-for-time sketches (if you haven&apos;t been paying attention), brought back their bizarro universe &apos;90s ABC sitcom vibes for a sketch with Ryan Gosling.</p>
