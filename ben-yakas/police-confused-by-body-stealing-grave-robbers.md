Suffolk County police say Mattia Filippazzo&apos;s body was removed from St. Charles Cemetery in East Farmingdale, L.I.&#x2014;while her husband&apos;s body was left in the crypt&#x2014;between Monday night and Tuesday morning. &quot;They took her and not him? I don&apos;t understand anything,&quot; the Filippazzos&apos; daughter-in-law, Louise, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508140216/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/08/26/2010-08-26_thieves_took_her_corpse_left_his_in_fancy_mausoleum_eternity_is_ruined_by_li_bod.html">said to the Daily News</a>, cursing the thieves in Italian.<p></p>

<p>Mattia, the mother of eight, died in 1998 at age 87 and was buried with her husband Stefano, who had died nearly a decade earlier. Police <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508140216/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2010/08/25/family-distraught-after-thieves-steal-body-from-cemetery/">believe</a> the thieves came armed with pry-bars and hammers, breaking into three mausoleums but only carrying one casket outside. Then they pried the casket open and carried the body away separately. Police, who don&apos;t believe the thieves were specifically targeting the Filippazzos, have no leads currently. Their daughter-in-law said, &quot;I can&apos;t believe they would do such a horrible thing. It&apos;s despicable. It&apos;s sick.&quot; </p>

<p>The family is now <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508140216/http://www.newsday.com/long-island/suffolk/family-offers-30g-reward-in-return-of-woman-s-body-1.2238548">offering a $30,000 reward</a> for the return of Mattia Filippazzo&apos;s body.</p>
