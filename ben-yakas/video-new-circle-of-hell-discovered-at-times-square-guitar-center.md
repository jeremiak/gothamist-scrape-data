<p>Every living creature deserves to have a place they can call their own&#x2014;drunks need bars, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501140603/http://gothamist.com/2014/08/09/5_train_taken_out_of_service_becaus.php">bedbugs need subways</a>, and Steve Vai aficionados need Guitar Center. Whether they are trying out whammy pedals, offering a sacrifice to Slash, or just in the mood to show off for strangers, aspiring musicians love to plug in and jam away&#x2014;regardless of what any other musicians are playing. </p>

<p>Thus, you end up with scenes like the one in the video below, which was shot at the newly-opened Guitar Center in Times Square. It&apos;s just like Sartre said: &quot;Hell is other people simultaneously trying and failing to play the &apos;Eruption&apos; solo.&quot; </p>
