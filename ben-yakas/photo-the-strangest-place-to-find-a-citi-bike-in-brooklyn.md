<p>It&apos;s been a busy and eventful week since <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502103130/http://gothamist.com/tags/citibike">CitiBike</a> was officially unveiled on Monday&#x2014;there were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502103130/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/28/citi_bike_day_one_stats_6050_trips.php">thousands of trips logged</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502103130/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/30/art_proceeds_in_petrosino_park_desp.php#photo-1">semi-nude protests</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502103130/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/30/second_attempted_citi_bike_theft.php">thefts</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502103130/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/31/anthony_weiner_and_citi_bike_friend.php">Weiner-sightings</a>, and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502103130/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/31/citi_bike_rider_hospitalized_after.php">first serious injury</a>. We&apos;ve also heard from a lot of CitiBike haters who are convinced CitiBike <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502103130/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/28/citi_bike_is_tearing_one_soho_park.php">destroyed their neighborhood</a> and kicked off <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502103130/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/29/2_people_blame_citi_bike_for_making.php">a subtropical scorpion uprising</a>. Those people wouldn&apos;t even try riding a CitiBike unless it could fly them to the moon&#x2014;except...maybe it can!</p>

<p>That&apos;s based on the above photo, which was posted on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502103130/http://www.reddit.com/r/nyc/comments/1fg9bh/im_pretty_sure_thats_not_how_it_works_citibike/">Reddit last night</a>&#x2014;it seems CitiBikes are ending up in all sorts of interesting, odd places. Did Weiner sprinkle a little pegasus dust on this one? We&apos;ve contacted the uploader to find out whether this is a hoax or someone really got belligerent last night. Just a reminder: if your CitiBike is stolen or gone for more than 24 hours, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502103130/http://citibikenyc.com/faq">it&apos;ll cost you $1000.</a></p>
