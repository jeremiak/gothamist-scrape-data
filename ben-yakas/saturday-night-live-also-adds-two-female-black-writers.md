<p>This week, after months of speculation, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424160408/http://gothamist.com/tags/snl"><em>Saturday Night Live</em></a> finally responded to the criticisms about the lack of diversity in the new cast by hiring a female black comedian. While UCB alum Sasheer Zamata <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424160408/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/06/snl_casts_black_female_cast_member.php">will get the spotlight</a> when SNL returns on January 18th, that won&apos;t be the only change to the show: SNL is also adding two female black comedians in the writer&apos;s room.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424160408/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/saturday-night-live-adds-two-669180">Hollywood Reporter says</a> that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424160408/https://twitter.com/LaKendraTookes">LaKendra Tookes</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424160408/http://www.justleslie.com/">Leslie Jones</a>, who tried out during the sketch show&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424160408/http://gothamist.com/2013/12/12/saturday_night_live_held_secret_aud.php">recent &quot;secret&quot; auditions</a>, have both been hired behind-the-scenes. Tookes is a former news reporter from Florida, while Jones is a comedy veteran who has appeared in everything from <em>The League</em> to <em>Def Comedy Jam </em>.</p>

<p>There are currently no plans to have either appear on-screen, but plenty of SNL writers have made that transition before, including Mike O&apos;Brien and Jason Sudeikis. But their addition to the staff may mark a bigger change on the show than having Zamata out front. </p>
