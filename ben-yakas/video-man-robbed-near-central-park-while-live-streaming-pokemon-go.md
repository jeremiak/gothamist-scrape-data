<p>A man was playing Pokemon Go near Central Park this weekend when he was assaulted and robbed&#x2014;and the whole thing was captured on his livestream. You can see video of the incident, which happened just after midnight Sunday on Central Park South near 6th Avenue, below.</p>

<p>Police say that the victim, a 43-year-old man, was holding three cell phones in his hand when he was approached by the suspect, who struck him in the back of the head, knocking him to the ground. The suspect removed the cellphones from him and fled northbound. The victim, a Twitch streamer who uses the handle &quot;Rickybot,&quot; was taken to a local hospital with a laceration on the side of his head and a swollen right cheek.</p>

<p>A few Redditors were following Rickybot in real time when the incident occurred:  &quot;The assailant fled on foot into the park, hid in some bushes and disabled the phones at which point the stream stopped,&quot; wrote user MrGrimme <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170112050757/https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemongo/comments/53g17i/rickybot_a_twitch_streamer_got_robbed_playing/">in this thread</a> on the attack. &quot;I was already on the phone with the 22nd precinct in NYC before the phones stopped broadcasting.&quot;</p>

<p>He added that the victim is recovering: &quot;Rickey btw is going to be fine. He did hit his head/jaw on the pavement. No concussion. Not sure if his jaw was broken. He has yet to get home. He spent over an hour with police before they took him to the hospital. And TWITCH God bless them suspended his account 3 hours after the mugging before he&apos;d even left the hospital.&quot;</p>

<p>Rickybot tweeted about the incident as well:</p>
