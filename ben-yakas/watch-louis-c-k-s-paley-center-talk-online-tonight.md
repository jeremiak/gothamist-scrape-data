<p>Did you get tickets to see <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405204426/http://gothamist.com/tags/louisck">Louis C.K.</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405204426/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/30/louis_ck_1.php">talk at PaleyFest</a> in midtown today? Tickets sold out in about half a millisecond, so there&apos;s a pretty good chance you didn&apos;t. However, you can still watch everyone&apos;s favorite ginger at 9:20 p.m. EST tonight <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405204426/http://media.paleycenter.org/paleyfest-made-in-ny-live-stream/">using the livestream here</a>.</p>

<p>C.K. will hopefully discuss the highly anticipated fourth season of <em>Louie</em>, which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405204426/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/03/louie_louis_ck_photos.php#photo-1">just started filming this week.</a> And if we&apos;re lucky he&apos;ll also expand upon his hatred <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405204426/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/20/video_louis_ck_beautifully_explains.php">for cell phone twiddlers</a>, or reveal the best Bruce Springsteen songs to cry to.</p>

<p>And if you tune in early to the stream, you can also catch the panel on <em>Person Of Interest</em> at 7:20 p.m. EST...if you are a person who is interested in that (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405204426/http://www.hiyoooo.com/">HIYOOOO</a>). </p>
