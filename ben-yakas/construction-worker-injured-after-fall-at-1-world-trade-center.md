<p>A construction worker was injured after he fell one floor at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506164455/http://gothamist.com/tags/oneworldtradecenter">1 World Trade Center</a> site this afternoon. According to the FDNY, the incident happened around 12:45 p.m.; the worker, whose name hasn&apos;t been released, either fell from the 100th floor to the 99th floor or from the 101st floor to the 100th according to different reports. FDNY said the worker&apos;s injuries were serious, but non-life threatening. He was taken to Bellevue Hospital in stable condition. We&apos;ll update with any more information we learn.</p>
