<p>Yesterday, the suspect who police believe <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150525061255/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/27/man_fatally_struck_by_7_train_in_qu.php">shoved a man onto the subway tracks</a> in Queens on Thursday night <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150525061255/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/29/cops_suspect_in_custody_for_fatally.php">was apprehended and arrested</a>. Erika Menendez, 31, has been charged for fatally shoving 46-year-old Sunando Sen into the path of a 7 train at the northbound platform of the 40th Street and Queens Boulevard elevated station in Sunnyside. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150525061255/http://queensda.org/newpressreleases/2012/december/subway_shover_12_28_12_cmp.pdf">Cops say</a> Menendez admitted to the crime, confessing: &#x201C;I pushed a Muslim off the train tracks because I hate Hindus and Muslims ever since 2001 when they put down the twin towers I&#x2019;ve been beating them up.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Menendez has been charged with second-degree murder as a hate crime for the shoving. &#x201C;The defendant is accused of committing what is every subway commuter&#x2019;s worst nightmare&#x2014;being suddenly and senselessly pushed into the path of an oncoming train,&quot; said Queens DA Richard Brown <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150525061255/http://www.queensda.org/newpressreleases/2012/dec12.html">in a release.</a> &quot;The victim was allegedly shoved from behind and had no chance to defend himself.  Beyond that, the hateful remarks allegedly made by the defendant and which precipitated the defendant&#x2019;s actions can never be tolerated by a civilized society.&#x201D; </p>

<p>Menendez was caught after she was recognized Saturday morning on a street in Brooklyn by a passer-by who called 911. He said she resembled the woman in the video of the suspect fleeing the scene Thursday night. This is how <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150525061255/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/queens/mad_push_revenge_vjt6xiNjodFt7WwnPr33mJ">the NY Post described her</a> leaving the 112th Precinct: &quot;She wailed incoherently, contorted her face into what looked like a fiendish grin, and struggled as officers forced her into an unmarked car.&quot;</p>

<p>During her arraignment hearing in Queens Criminal Court yesterday, Menendez was laughing so hard that she was visibly shaking. &#x201C;You&#x2019;re going to have to have your client stop laughing,&#x201D; Judge Gia Morris told Menendez&apos;s lawyer. </p>

<p>It&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150525061255/http://pix11.com/2012/12/29/subway-shove-suspect-charged-with-murder-and-hate-crime/">already been suggested</a> that Menendez has mental problems, but Brown said he had no information about the defendant&#x2019;s criminal or mental history. &#x201C;It will be up to the court to determine if she is fit to stand trial,&#x201D; he said. Menendez faces 25 years to life in prison if found guilty.<br>
