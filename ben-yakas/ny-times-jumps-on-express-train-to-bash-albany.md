title: NY Times Jumps On Express Train To Bash Albany
---

<span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2009_10_alany.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20111116154557im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2009_10_alany.jpg" width="250" height="167" class="image-right"> </span>Today, the NY Times launched announced its <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111116154557/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/19/opinion/19mon1.html?_r=2&amp;pagewanted=1">new editorial series on the incompetence</a> of the NY State government, called &quot;Failed State.&quot; A year away from state elections, a fired-up Times rails against the &quot;<strong>inbred system [which] allows so many lawmakers to abuse the public trust</strong>,&quot; summarizing some of the more egregious abuses of the past couple years and some of the major grievances which they plan to address in the series.  Warning&#x2014;if you don&apos;t already want to head up to Albany with a pitchfork, you will now:

<br>
<ul>
	<li>The Times calls its section about ethics reform, &quot;Albany Needs Adult Supervision&quot; and notes, &quot;A year after the Spitzer [ethics] reform, a top official for the new ethics commission was accused of being unethical.&quot;</li>
	<li>On Campaign Finance Reform: &quot;An individual can give only $4,800 to a candidate for president, but $55,900 to a candidate for governor.&quot; </li>
	<li>On a Transparent Budget: &quot;Details are guarded like state secrets. Want to know how much taxpayers spend on roads downstate? Forget it.&quot;</li>
	<li>On Election Reform: &quot;Elections should not be an income source for sleazy lawyers whose business is bumping candidates off ballots.&quot;</li>
	<li>On Mapmaking Tomfoolery (lawmakers can change their districts every 10 years): &quot;The maps are so bizarre that one upstate district has been nicknamed &apos;Lincoln riding a vacuum cleaner&apos; because of the way it looks as it reaches here and there to pick up enough friendly voters for a one-size-fits-one-party district.&quot;</li>
</ul>

Their litany of (justified) complaints against Albany is pretty staggering when you take a step back, especially considering how many denigrated officials its spit out. Maybe what&apos;s most remarkable is how everyone in town seems to be on the same page these days. This series, together with similar on-going ones by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111116154557/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/state_of_shame/index.html">the Daily News</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111116154557/http://www.nypost.com/columnists/fredricudicker">the Post</a> makes a holy trifecta of majorly angry NY dailies demanding reform.
