<p>You may recall that things didn&apos;t exactly go smoothly the last time NBC <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427162425/http://gothamist.com/2008/12/08/nbc_gives_jay_leno_daily_10_pm_week.php">tried to move</a> Jay Leno off of <em>The Tonight Show</em> and replace him with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427162425/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/05/23/conan-obrien-jay-leno-nothing-to-say_n_1540990.html">someone younger</a> (and 100% more ginger). But with Jimmy Kimmel having moved to 11:35 p.m. on ABC and Leno&apos;s ratings taking a hit since the L&apos;affaire Team Coco, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427162425/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/sources-nbc-discussing-jay-leno-425669">The Hollywood Reporter claims that</a> NBC is gearing up to announce in May that the 2013-14 television season will be Leno&apos;s final one as host. And everyone&apos;s favorite Neil Young impersonator <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427162425/http://gothamist.com/tags/jimmyfallon">Jimmy Fallon</a> is in line to take over for him.</p>

<p>The Hollywood Reporter cites &quot;two high-level industry sources&quot; about their scoop, and they say NBC is urgent to move forward because of Kimmel&apos;s competition. &#x201C;The more time Jimmy Kimmel is in that slot, the more the young audience goes that way, the harder it is for Jimmy [Fallon] to keep that audience,&#x201D; says one of their sources. A network veteran agreed that Kimmel is doing well: &quot;Jay wins overall, but on any given night, it&apos;s neck-and-neck in 18-49. I understand where they might have fear and also feel that they own the solution [in Fallon.]&quot;</p>

<p>NBC has denied the report and Leno&apos;s rep said, &quot;We do not speculate on rumor.&quot; This isn&apos;t the first time this rumor has come up: back in December, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427162425/http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv-movies/nbc-brass-thinking-jay-leno-replacement-article-1.1220267">the Daily News reported</a> that NBC executives had begun &quot;quietly&quot; exploring the option of replacing Leno with Fallon. </p>

<p>Previously, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427162425/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/14/jimmy-fallon-does-not-want-tonight-show-right-now_n_1596836.html">Fallon joked about</a> the possibility of taking over for Leno: &quot;If there&apos;s one thing I&apos;ve learned from Dave and Conan, it&apos;s that hosting this show is a one-way ticket to not hosting <em>The Tonight Show</em>.&quot;</p>
