<p>After honing his Donald Trump impression over the course of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022191830/http://gothamist.com/2017/04/21/video_anthony_atamanuik_reveals_the.php">the entire presidential campaign</a>&#x2014;improvising at the Upright Citizens Brigade theater, appearing on @Midnight in character, and touring the country as Trump with comedian James Adomian&apos;s Bernie Sanders&#x2014;Anthony Atamanuik&apos;s all-new Trump comedy program <em>The President Show</em> premiered on Comedy Central last night. </p>

<p>Following in the footsteps of another Comedy Central show, <em>That&apos;s My Bush!</em>, Atamanuik has said he&apos;s as interested in capturing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022191830/http://www.vulture.com/2017/04/donald-trump-anthony-atamanuik-crashes-the-daily-show.html">the emptiness in Trump&apos;s soul</a> as much as capturing his unique mannerisms. Below, check out a clip from the premiere, in which the president plays a game of &quot;Nice! Not Nice!&quot; and reveals his hatred for corn chowder, his mixed feelings on Sean Spicer, and identified Germany&apos;s lowest moment: &quot;The German people who booed [Ivanka] when she defended me at a conference in Berlin. Disgusting! This is the worst thing the Germans have ever done, ever.&quot;</p>
