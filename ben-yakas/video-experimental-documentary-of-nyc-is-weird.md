<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="62311video.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120605231916im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/62311video.jpg" width="250" height="140" class="image-left"> </span>What with all the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120605231916/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/22/teen_flies_into_rage_when_bus_drive.php">bus beatings</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120605231916/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/23/ipad-carrying_jogger_mugged_in_cent.php">iPad muggers</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120605231916/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/22/park_slopers_a_pigeon_killer_amongs.php">pigeon killers</a>, it&apos;s reasonable to feel a bit overwhelmed in the city, in need of some outlet for all that anxiety. One NYer who felt that way decided to channel that frustration into a video project...a very <em>strange</em> video project, involving the ten sign semiotic system of philosopher/mathematician <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120605231916/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Sanders_Peirce">Charles Sanders Peirce</a>. Watch it below:</p>

<p>We won&apos;t mince words: the video is weird. But as we watched it a second and third time, we were less focused on trying to figure out the overall concept (see below), and more taken by the striking, fleeting images: the disorienting flashes at the start, the violence on the floor by the L, the stillness of the Empire State Building, and the ranting of a shirtless man. There is an uncomfortable section where the videographer catcalls and &quot;labels&quot; passersby, and the whole thing ends with an interview with a woman with more than a bit of hair on her chin.</p>

<p>According to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120605231916/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgdfxDz5IsQ">uploader&apos;s description</a>, the &quot;experimental documentary,&quot; NYC I-X, adopts the city as object, New Yorkers as interpretant, and ten different scenes as the signs themselves. Each scene is labeled according to which sign was used:</p>

<p>I - rhematic iconic qualisign: A feeling of New York City<br>
II - rhematic iconic sinsign: A &apos;model&apos; of New Yorkers<br>
III - rhematic indexical sinsign: Possibilites near the subway<br>
IV - dicent indexical sinsign: onomatopoeia: New Yorkers ignore violence<br>
V - rhematic iconic legisign: The Empire State Building<br>
VI - rhematic indexical legisign: The layout of New York City<br>
VII - dicent indexical legisign: &quot;This is New York&quot;<br>
VIII - rhematic symbolic legisign: The New York Times in context<br>
IX - dicent symbolic legisign: Naming pedestrians<br>
X - argument symbolic legisign: A proposition from an interview</p>
