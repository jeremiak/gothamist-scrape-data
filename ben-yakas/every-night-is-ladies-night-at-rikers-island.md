<p>There are many, many things <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130402065012/http://gothamist.com/tags/rikersisland">Rikers</a> is not good for: you can&apos;t get a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130402065012/http://gothamist.com/2009/06/12/graffiti_writer_cant_get_vegan_food.php">vegan meal</a>, it&apos;s bad for your <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130402065012/http://gothamist.com/2009/12/30/sleeping_rikers_prison_guard_is_ser.php">sleep schedule</a>, and danger lurks around every corner <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130402065012/http://gothamist.com/2010/12/04/rikers_inmate_takes_a_bite_out_of_g.php">for thumbs</a>. But there is one thing Rikers is good for: hookups between lonely female guards and eligible inmates.</p>

<p>Former guard Yolanda Dickinson, who worked at Rikers from 1997 to 2004, has written a novel called &quot;Taboo,&quot; based on the jail&apos;s alleged out-of-control, soap-opera-esque sex scene. &quot;They would do it on the midnight shift when there were not many people around. They have electronic cell doors, and it&apos;s not a problem for someone to crack open the door,&quot; she <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130402065012/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/it_sex_cells_at_racy_rikers_YIRERnv604nc91QeTClQTO?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">told the Post</a>. With 3,890 female officers guarding some 12,000 men, Dickinson says hook-ups are inevitable: &quot;There are a lot of lonely single women on the job, and you&apos;re surrounded by these cute guys. They&apos;re working out. They&apos;re attractive...They&apos;re criminals, so they have a cunning way of approaching you. They study you all day.&quot;</p>

<p>And she should know, since she has had her fair share of dalliances with prisoners: she admits that she met a Rikers inmate on her watch, a gang member from her neighborhood who had admitted to killing a rapist; also, the father of her 17-year-old son served 10 years in federal prison on drug charges. She was eventually fired for &quot;undue familiarity&quot; in 2004, after an inmate called her from Rikers. </p>

<p>The Post notes that at least six female guards have been fired or forced out for such relationships: that includes Kimberly Hurd, who bore an inmate&apos;s love child; Yolanda Turner-Goodwin, who was photographed hugging and kissing a prisoner; Kadessha Mulgrav, who allegedly sneaked away for a midnight liaison with an inmate in the shower room; and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130402065012/http://gothamist.com/2009/12/29/rikers_guards_sleeping_on_job_sleep.php">Doreen Baker</a>, who was called more than 170 times by her inmate lover.</p>
