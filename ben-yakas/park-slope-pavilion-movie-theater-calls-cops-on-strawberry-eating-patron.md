<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425222556/http://gothamist.com/tags/parkslopepavilion">Pavilion Theater in Park Slope</a> is well-known for being one of the most vile and repugnant movie theaters in all the city. They&apos;ve been routinely plagued <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425222556/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/19/park_slope_movie_theater_spraying_f.php">by bedbugs</a>, the employees are difficult, and despite going through <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425222556/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/03/photos_park_slope_pavilion_nastiest.php#photo-1">several renovations</a>, and the place still is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425222556/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/24/even_under_new_owners_pavilion_movi.php">an utter mess</a>. As if you needed yet another reason to avoid this theater: they&apos;re now forcibly removing patrons who bring fruit in. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425222556/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/06/michael_wolff_whit_stillman_a_bottl.php">Where&apos;s Michael Wolff when you need him</a>!</p>

<p>Michael Kass, 41, wrote a long message on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425222556/https://www.facebook.com/PAVILIONTHEATER">movie theater&apos;s Facebook page</a> on Sunday detailing how the theater&apos;s manager called cops on him for eating fruit:</p>

<blockquote>Earlier today your manager, escorted by two police officers, forcibly ejected me from your theater. The offense -- not rowdiness disturbing other patrons, no smoking or anything comparable -- simply the fact that I brought a container of fruit into your theater and refused to either throw it away or leave the theater (without a full cash refund). I am not a &quot;activist&quot; or a &quot;rabblerowser&quot; -- what I am is a 41-year old type II diabetic who loves movies and would like to be able to see them in public and enjoy a healthy snack. 

<p>I am fully willing to pay the ridiculous theater mark-up for concessions as I realize that most theaters would not be profitable without them but the theater industry (including yours) has never seemed to care enough about the health of its patrons to offer healthier options on a consistent basis. </p>

<p>What most other theaters HAVE done is take the common sense approach of selectively enforcing their rules against outside food to effectively allow patrons to discretely make this choice for themselves provided they do so in a manner than doesn&apos;t compromise the sanitation (i.e., not throw nutshells on the floor) or aesthetics (i.e., not bring in hot food) of the theater. </p>

<p>I don&apos;t think it takes a rocket scientist to understand that your theater continues to operate at the pleasure of its local community -- it&apos;s a pretty run down structure that hasn&apos;t had any palpable investment by its owners in many years, has frequent HVAC issues and, frankly, indexes pretty high on the &quot;stick floors&quot; scale. What it has goes for it is a vibrant Park Slope community willing to overlook all of this because we love movies and want a local theater. That said, we&apos;re also one of the most health conscious communities in the city and it doesn&apos;t take a rocket scientist to see that your theater should not want to be seen as the forced purveyor of junk food to its patrons/their children. </p>

<p>I think it goes without saying that I won&apos;t be patronizing your theater again any time soon but I&apos;d invite you to take the time to consider revising your policies to better reflect the community you serve. No one is asking you to stock granola or grapes in your concession stand if you don&apos;t believe you can do so profitably -- but calling the &quot;cops&quot; on a neighborhood father of three for discretely bringing in a closed container of strawberries is beyond ridiculous and, if you don&apos;t revise your policy, I feel pretty confident getting our community to move their movie dollars elsewhere will be pretty easy.</p>

<p>I invite any friends neighbors who feel similarly to post to the wall (or like this posting) to let the Pavilion&apos;s management understand public opinion on this point.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>Kass <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425222556/http://www.fuckedinparkslope.com/home/pavilion-manager-calls-cops-on-park-slope-dad-for-fruit-viol.html">talked to F&apos;d In Park Slope</a> about the incident, explaining that he hadn&apos;t even entered the movie theater when he was stopped by a guard. As he was handing them his ticket, he was asked what was in his bag&#x2014;a closed container of strawberries. He was told to throw them out or leave, and he said he would leave if he were given a refund for his ticket, which management for some inexplicable reason refused. Kass had never even actually opened the container inside the theater when the manager brought two cops in to escort him out.</p>

<p>Kass&apos; wife tried to get de Blasio on this, to no avail:</p>

<p>&quot;They just escorted me out,&quot; Kass <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425222556/http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/2014/03/park_slope_pavilion_theater_michael_kass_strawberries.php">told Village Voice</a>, noting that the two officers were not private security. &quot;I told them I was sorry they had to get distracted by something so stupid.&quot; A manager from the Pavilion, who identified himself as Jonathan Milagrose, also told the Voice he was &quot;100 percent sure&quot; the incident hadn&apos;t taken place: &quot;We&apos;re very friendly to everybody,&quot; he said. &quot;They can bring in Starbucks or muffins from Connecticut Muffin. I guarantee you this is not us.&quot;</p>
