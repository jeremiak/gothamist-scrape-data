<p>Yesterday, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509173226/http://gothamist.com/2014/04/03/david_letterman_retiring.php">David Letterman made a surprise announcement</a> that he is planning to retire from <em>The Late Show</em> in 2015. Almost immediately after former REM member Mike Mills tweeted the news, people have been speculating about who could possibly take over for Letterman. And according to reports today, CBS&apos; first choice is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509173226/http://gothamist.com/tags/stephencolbert">Stephen Colbert</a>. Guess #CancelColbert could end up working out after all.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509173226/http://mashable.com/2014/04/04/stephen-colbert-replace-david-letterman-late-night/?utm_cid=mash-com-Tw-main-link">Mashable reports that</a> Colbert has spoken with CBS in recent weeks, and although no formal contract discussions have taken place yet, he is currently the &quot;front-and-center candidate.&quot; Neither CBS nor Comedy Central (which are connected via parent company Viacom) would comment on the report, but Nikki Finke also tweeted yesterday that sources indicated that Colbert was at the top of the list.</p>

<p>Colbert&apos;s contract to serve as executive producer, writer and host <em>The Colbert Report</em> runs through the end of 2014. The biggest caveat about all this is that CBS reportedly wants him to drop his &quot;Stephen Colbert&quot; persona.</p>

<blockquote>Colbert would leave behind the pseudo-conservative persona he&apos;s cultivated at The Colbert Report and just be himself at his CBS home, one of the individuals told Mashable. He has stepped out of character on rare occasion, though not on his show, and possesses the same wry, incisive interview skills that Letterman has showcased for decades.</blockquote>

<p>You can see a couple clips of Colbert on Letterman below.</p>

<p>Other names that have been floated include Jon Stewart (whom CBS reported also contacted at some point), Craig Ferguson (current host of The Late Late Show after Letterman), Conan O&apos;Brien, Ellen Degeneres, and Amy Poehler (because she&apos;s perfect). Our #1 choice, as always, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509173226/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/20/the_top_15_candidates_to_replace_ji.php">would be Ant-Man</a>, though we also enjoy the love-him-or-hate-him style of Billy Eichner.</p>
