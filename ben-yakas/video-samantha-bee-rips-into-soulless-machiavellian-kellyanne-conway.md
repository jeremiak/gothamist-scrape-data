<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170925130316/http://gothamist.com/tags/samanthabee">Samantha Bee</a> and <em>Full Frontal</em> are all about celebrating the achievements of fierce, brave, strong women (and, of course, dildo jokes), and in last night&apos;s episode, she devoted a segment to one such fierce, brave, strong woman, Kellyanne Conway, inaugurating her into the &quot;Great Feminists in Feminism Herstory Hall of Lady Fame.&quot; And it was one of the best segments FF has done yet: incisive, brutal and hilarious. </p>

<p>&quot;As racists who don&#x2019;t feel like racists keep telling us, we should never judge anybody by what they say or do, but only by what&#x2019;s in their heart,&#x201D; Bee said, referring to a Conway soundbite about emphasizing femininity in the workforce. &quot;And I know Kellyanne doesn&#x2019;t believe those homophobic, sexist things in her heart, because Kellyanne doesn&#x2019;t believe anything in her heart. She will say literally anything.&quot;</p>

<p>By the end of the segment, after analyzing how Conway hijacks interviews and uses her verbal jiu-jitsu on language, Bee has convinced herself that Kellyanne should be the one running the country, not Trump: &quot;Kellyanne is the soulless, Machiavellian despot America deserves!&quot;</p>

<p>Bee also had a segment on Trump&apos;s cabinet nominees, focusing on Secretary of the Treasury and Swamp King, Steve Mnuchin&#x2014;who happens to be John Oliver&apos;s evil twin, a big fan of the Great Recession, the &quot;Foreclosure King,&quot; and a producer behind <em>Suicide Squad</em>, a.k.a. &quot;the world&apos;s first feature that was made by pouring a can of Monster energy drink onto a reel of film.&quot; </p>

<p>She also interviewed Russian author and dissident Masha Gessen to get some not-so-comforting insights into our country&apos;s immediate future. &quot;What are your biggest worries about the incoming Trump administration?&quot; Bee asks her. &quot;Oh, my biggest worry is a nuclear holocaust,&quot; Gessen says deadpan. &quot;If miraculously we avoid that, then he&apos;s certain to do irreparable damage to the environment that will make the survival of the human species impossible.&quot; </p>

<p>Bee is also headed to the Women&apos;s March On Washington this weekend, but don&apos;t expect her to film any segments there for the show: &quot;We have rented a bus for people who want to go and we&apos;re just going,&quot; Bee <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170925130316/http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/18/entertainment/samantha-bee-full-frontal-election-politics/">told CNN</a>. &quot;We&apos;re not going to do anything there. We&apos;re going because we as individuals want to go and just be there for it.&quot;</p>
