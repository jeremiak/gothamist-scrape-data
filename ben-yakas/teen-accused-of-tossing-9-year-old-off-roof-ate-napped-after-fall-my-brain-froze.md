<p>The 17-year-old boy <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130326202542/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/03/9-year-old_screamed_as_teen_alleged.php">accused of throwing his younger neighbor off of a Bronx rooftop</a> repeated his assertions in a jailhouse interview that the incident <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130326202542/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/04/teenager_accused_of_tossing_9-year-.php">was an accident</a>&#x2014;and he also tried to explain why he ate and napped instead of calling the police after the youngster fell. &#x201C;I didn&#x2019;t call the NYPD because my brain froze,&#x201D; Carmine Aska <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130326202542/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brain-froze-bully-takes-nap-calling-cops-article-1.1265813">told the News on Rikers Island</a>. &#x201C;I was shivering, I was crying, I just went to my aunt&#x2019;s...My whole world stopped.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Aska, 17, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130326202542/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/02/teen_charged_with_attempted_murder.php">allegedly dragged</a> Freddy Martin to the roof of their Nelson Avenue building in Morris Heights around 8:30 p.m. on Feb. 1st. Neighbors previously said that Freddy tried to fight off Aska to no avail: &#x201C;(Freddy) was screaming.&quot; Martin, who suffered two collapsed lungs and a broken arm, leg and ribs, told EMTs as he was taken away, &quot;Cas dragged me to the roof and threw me off; I don&#x2019;t know why.&quot;</p>

<p>According to Aska, who has four prior arrests, Freddy was hanging from the edge of the building by his fingertips for 10 seconds before he fell. He couldn&apos;t explain to the News why they were on the roof in the first place, but he insisted it was accident and he tried to save him: &#x201C;I told him to swing his other hand so I could grab it and pull it up,&#x201D; Aska said. &#x201C;But when he swung, he fell...It was unintentional. I did not throw him.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Aska, who is charged with attempted murder, assault, reckless endangerment and endangering the welfare of a child, gave a few different stories to investigators previously: at one point he said he and his younger brother were &#x201C;play fighting&#x201D; with Freddy and &#x201C;Freddy fell,&#x201D; and later he said that he &#x201C;grabbed Freddy around the legs...I turned around, and I slipped and Freddy fell.&#x201D; But investigators noted there were signs of a struggle: one of Freddy&apos;s sneakers was found in a hallway and another on the roof, along with his broken eyeglasses.</p>

<p>&#x201C;I hope Freddy gets better, and I hope I can go home,&#x201D; said Aska, who added he wants to join the Marines before a career in law enforcement. &#x201C;I didn&#x2019;t want to hurt anyone...I just want to go home.&#x201D; After being in a medically-induced coma since the fall, Freddy began breathing on his own this week <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130326202542/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/bronx/boy_thrown_five_storeys_is_awake_JYTL9AqX5YcvMCL0LM8tUN">and has now woken up</a>; he&apos;s also spoken to detectives, though it is not known what he said.</p>

<p>Freddy&apos;s family lawyer told the Post that he is filing lawsuit on behalf of Freddy and his dad against the owners of the apartment building for their alleged failure to prevent residents from going on the roof. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s our basic belief that the landlord has to take responsibility and be very vigilant about trying to protect children in the building and not enabling this kind of situation,&#x201D; Steven  Hymowitz said. &#x201C;You don&#x2019;t want them to facilitate and create a situation where the kids can go on the roof and have access and after that, things like this happen. You certainly don&#x2019;t want any activity on the roof.&#x201D;</p>
