<p>From <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160418144507/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/14/video_today_only_watch_john_lennony.php">lost documentaries</a> to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160418144507/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/27/even_john_lennon_had_to_deal_with_t.php">shopping lists</a> to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160418144507/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/12/video_vintage_footage_shows_most_am.php">vintage party footage</a>, we love <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160418144507/http://gothamist.com/tags/johnlennon">John Lennon</a> ephemera in all shapes and sizes. And now, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160418144507/http://flavorwire.com/242506/john-lennons-hilarious-handwritten-word-associations">Flavorwire points us</a> in the direction of John Lennon&apos;s handwritten list of word associations (via the excellent <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160418144507/http://www.listsofnote.com/2011/12/elvis-fat.html">Lists of Note</a> website). </p>

<p>It seems that a fan named Stuart mailed Lennon <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160418144507/http://www.bonhams.com/eur/auction/13312/lot/2298/">six pages of interview questions in 1976</a>, and in the midst of his unofficial retirement during that period, Lennon had nothing better to do than answer them! </p>

<p>Among the highlights: New York is &quot;great,&quot; Howard Cosell is a &quot;ham,&quot; and bootlegs are &quot;good.&quot; Elvis is &quot;fat&quot; and David Bowie is &quot;thin.&quot; He also tackles all the Beatles and Yoko Ono: Ringo is &quot;friend,&quot; George is &quot;lost,&quot; Paul is &quot;extraordinary,&quot; and Yoko is &quot;love.&quot; Too bad the fan didn&apos;t also write down, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160418144507/http://thisrecording.com/today/2011/12/6/in-which-john-lennon-is-split-in-two.html">&quot;May Pang.&quot;</a></p>

<blockquote>9. Today, how do you associate to the following, described in one word?

<p>New York: great</p>

<p>Elvis: fat</p>

<p>Ringo: friend</p>

<p>Yoko: love </p>

<p>Howard Cosell: ham</p>

<p>George: lost </p>

<p>Bootlegs: good</p>

<p>Elton: nice </p>

<p>Paul: extraordinary</p>

<p>Bowie: thin </p>

<p>M.B.E: shit</p>
