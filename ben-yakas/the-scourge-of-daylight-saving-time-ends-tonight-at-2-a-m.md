                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="3913dst.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20131206021754im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/3913dst.jpg" width="640" height="427"> <br> <i> Yes, Chris Martin is to blame for this too (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131206021754/http://www.shutterstock.com/pic-8185852/stock-photo-crazy-man-with-clock-focus-on-the-clock.html?src=54cc3038fb9704570a81e0c815ab0298-2-25">Shutterstock/ Jorge Pedro Barradas de Casais</a>)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>After nearly eight months of living like panicked turtles, America (excluding the enlightened states of Hawaii and Arizona) will shake off the shackles of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131206021754/http://gothamist.com/tags/daylightsavingtime">Daylight Saving Time</a> tonight at 2 a.m., and seize back that extra hour of sleep that is our God-given right. </p>

<p>In case you&apos;re not familiar with our feelings on the matter, in the spring we laid out <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131206021754/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/09/its_time_to_declare_war_on_daylight.php">14 reasons why DST needs to end forever</a>. To summarize: DST is a tradition that started as a joke and was pushed into reality via a confusing plan encouraged by golf-obsessed presidents and insect-obsessed entomologists; its purported benefits are greatly overrated-to-non-existent, and its greatest legacy is the fact you get the song &quot;Yellow&quot; stuck in your head and hate yourself for singing along. </p>

<p>So cherish the next five months or so, before the cruel invisible hands of Chris Martin&apos;s grandfather pry open your bedroom doors and assault your circadian rhythms. And don&apos;t forget to change the batteries in your smoke and carbon monoxide detectors!</p>
