<p>Morgan, fellow comics James &#x201C;Uncle Jimmy Mack&#x201D; McNair, Ardie Fuqua and Harris Stanton, and manager Jeffrey Millea were all in the limo bus on the New Jersey Turnpike on their way back to NYC after a comedy show in Delaware around 1 a.m. Saturday morning when the crash occurred. McNair was killed and at least two others were injured in the crash. The driver of the 18-wheeler truck, Kevin Roper, is expected to be charged in the six vehicle crash. Based on photos, Roper&apos;s vehicle appears to have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150601001942/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/08/nyregion/tracy-morgan.html?hpw&amp;rref=arts">been a Wal-Mart truck.</a></p>

<p>Police said that when Roper saw the limo bus in front of him, he swerved left to avoid it, but struck it in the rear anyway, then hit another vehicle. The limo bus driver lost control, began rotating clockwise, and then turned over onto its left side, hitting three other cars in the process.</p>

<p>Morgan, 45, and Milea were flown to Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital in New Brunswick, where Morgan is still in critical condition. &quot;His family is now with him and he is receiving excellent care,&quot; publicist Lewis Kay said <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150601001942/http://www.nj.com/middlesex/index.ssf/2014/06/tracy_morgans_family_at_his_side_after_comedian_is_critically_injured_in_crash.html">in a statement</a>. &quot;We don&#x2019;t anticipate much of a change in his condition today.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;He&#x2019;s not in good shape,&quot; Morgan&#x2019;s ex-wife Sabina Morgan <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150601001942/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/tracy-morgan-critically-injured-new-jersey-crash-article-1.1820672">told the Daily News</a>. &quot;I&#x2019;m traumatized. I&#x2019;m so upset. I can&#x2019;t believe it. It&#x2019;s like I&#x2019;m in a nightmare.&quot; She told them he has a broken leg and is still unconscious, but doctors expect him to recover. She added that the couple&apos;s three children are &quot;not holding up well at all.&quot;</p>
