<p>Taxis: when they&apos;re not being driven by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150409161805/http://gothamist.com/2014/07/03/blackout_drunk_man_arrested_for_ste.php">drunk passengers</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150409161805/http://gothamist.com/2014/05/16/heil_taxi_nazi_cabbie.php">Nazis</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150409161805/http://gothamist.com/2014/08/29/cops_arrest_fake_cabbie_who_tried_t.php">creepazoids</a>, they really come in handy!

And maybe it can help you get an idea of the best places in NYC to pickup a cab.</p>

<p>The map was put together by a team at Cornell Tech, who crunched the data released by the Taxi Commission under the Freedom Of Information Act. They write: &quot;We set out to answer an argument we&apos;ve all had many times- where&apos;s the best place to walk and grab a cab?&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150409161805/http://www.nyctaxiviz.com/">Peruse their site</a> for more fun graphs, including analysis of the most popular taxi routes in NYC, where passengers can get to within 10 minutes by taxi, and as you can see below, the best intersections to hail a cab.</p>
