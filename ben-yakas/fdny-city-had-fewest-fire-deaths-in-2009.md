<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="11110firesafety.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20111213195020im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/11110firesafety.jpg" width="300" height="241" class="image-left"> </span>Good news to assuage pyrophobics across the five boroughs: the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111213195020/http://www.nyc.gov/html/fdny/html/home2.shtml">FDNY</a> released their annual report, and revealed that there were only 73 civilian fire deaths in 2009, down from 86 in 2008. </p>

<p>This is the lowest number of fire-related fatalities in the city&apos;s history, since they started keeping records in the early 20th century. The previous low was 77 in 1919; the all-time high was 310 in 1970. As the Post <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111213195020/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/city_fire_deaths_hit_all_time_low_JG447DNQ0ow5CC3RtEW7FI">points out</a>, it&apos;s been a remarkable run for the FDNY over the last decade: &quot;up until 2002, there had been only three years (1919, 1921 and 1927) when the city recorded fewer than 100 fire deaths.&quot; Since 2002, it&apos;s been below 100 six times.</p>

<p>In addition, the FDNY recorded its fastest emergency response time to structural fires&#x2014;four minutes and two seconds, down over 30 seconds from 2005.
