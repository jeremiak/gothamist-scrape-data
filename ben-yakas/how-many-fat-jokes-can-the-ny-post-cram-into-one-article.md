title: How Many Fat Jokes Can The NY Post Cram Into One Article?
---

	
										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="42514nypost.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150822232703im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/42514nypost.jpg" width="640" height="427"> <br> <i> Where some people see a con man, the NY Post sees plus-size comedy gold.</i></div> <p></p>

<p>As previously noted, the operator of a Bronx-based nonprofit pled guilty this week to diverting more than $360K in government funds (that was supposed to go to cancer screenings) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150822232703/http://gothamist.com/2014/04/25/head_of_bronx_cancer_non-profit_cau.php">toward his own lavish, Gucci alligator belt-accessorized lifestyle</a>. In addition to having to pay back the money, 49-year-old Joseph Junkovic is facing 18 to 24 months in prison for his misdeeds. But evidently, part of his punishment is also to be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150822232703/http://nypost.com/2014/04/24/nonprofit-boss-diverted-360k-to-fund-luxe-trips-shopping-sprees/">fat-shamed by the NY Post</a>, a real newspaper that gets printed every day and distributed throughout America&apos;s capital of media and culture. Because there is no denominator low enough for everyone&apos;s favorite rag. </p>

<p>Fellow tabloid the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150822232703/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/bogus-bronx-nonprofit-boss-pleads-guilty-cancer-scam-article-1.1768522">Daily News found</a> Junkovic&apos;s misdeeds sufficient enough that they stuck to the facts, and didn&apos;t resort to looking up synonyms for &quot;fat ass.&quot; But the Post gleefully takes every opportunity it can to identify Junkovic by his weight, and not&#x2014;oh I don&apos;t know&#x2014;the fact he ripped off people with cancer, which might be a tad bit more relevant to this story than the fact the Post still thinks like a 4th grade bully.</p>

<ul>
	<li>&quot;A fat-cat operator&quot;</li>
	<li>&quot;so he could live large&quot;</li>
<li>&#x201C;There were times he billed for enormous and impossible hours&quot;</li>
	<li>&quot;The corpulent conman&quot;</li>
	<li>&quot;looking in court like he never met a meal he didn&#x2019;t like&quot;</li>
	<li>&quot;also loved to stuff his face at Smith and Wollensky steakhouses, sources said&quot;</li>
	<li>&quot;Dressed in a button-down, blue-and-white striped shirt that looked like it was going to burst&quot;</li>
	<li>&quot;the fat cat&quot;</li>
</ul>

<p>This is, sadly, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150822232703/http://gothamist.com/tags/nypost">par for the course</a> with the Post and its allegedly human writing staff. As casually cruel, exploitative, and unnecessary as these fat references are, it&apos;s not even quite as bad as their previous forays into fat-shaming, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150822232703/http://gothamist.com/2013/12/24/ny_post_slut_shames_lis_smith_becau.php">slut-shaming</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150822232703/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/27/ny_post_blames_increased_subway_hom.php">homeless-shaming</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150822232703/http://gothamist.com/2014/02/23/ny_post_shames_teens_at_fail_factor.php">teen-shaming</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150822232703/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/25/racist_ny_post_cartoon_portrays_inn.php">religious-shaming</a>, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150822232703/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/29/ny_post_sneers_at_woman_who_has_pai.php">body-shaming</a>. And that doesn&apos;t even take into account when the Post has used its front cover as a means to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150822232703/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/06/public_officials_hasidic_jews_offen.php">offend Jews</a>, accuse innocent people <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150822232703/http://gothamist.com/tags/defamation">of being responsible for terrorist bombings</a>, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150822232703/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/04/photos_video_subway_shove_victim_ph.php#photo-2">practically reveled in someone&apos;s death.</a></p>

<p>And still, none of that even involves the racist rantings of America&apos;s Favorite Bigoted Catlady, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150822232703/http://gothamist.com/tags/andreapeyser">Andrea Peyser,</a> whose continued employment is a testament to the Post editorial board&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150822232703/http://gothamist.com/2013/12/12/hot-and-bothered_ny_post_slutshames.php">hatred for all things Danish.</a></p>
