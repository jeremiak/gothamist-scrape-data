<p>Yesterday, we were warily excited when the DOT <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150326000818/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/28/dot_releases_updated_citibike_map.php">released a revised map showing</a> exactly where the 293 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150326000818/http://gothamist.com/tags/citibike">CitiBike</a> stations will be located when the long-delayed bike sharing program finally launches <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150326000818/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/07/citibike_share_program_is_now_set_t.php">in May</a>. The DOT couldn&apos;t possibly pull the rug from under us again? Well, fear not you cyclist enthusiasts: the first CitiBikes have been spotted today in Brooklyn!</p>

<p>Tipster Adam Alperowicz spotted the bikes on the Kent Avenue side of the Brooklyn Navy Yard this morning. We asked him whether it appeared that people were able to take them out ahead-of-schedule: &quot;There were a few people with bike helmets on milling around the stations. Not sure if they were using them or what. Guard wouldn&apos;t let me go any further than that because they&apos;re on navy yard property.&quot;</p>

<p>We&apos;ve contacted the DOT to learn any more information about the new bikes, and whether people might be able to use them before the scheduled launch in May. Suffice to say, we&apos;ve <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150326000818/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/28/game_of_thrones.php">already started planning our cycling date route with Natalie Dormer.</a></p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150326000818/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/28/game_of_thrones.php">

</a><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150326000818/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/28/game_of_thrones.php"><strong>Update</strong>: According to a DOT spokesman, those bikes at the Navy Yard are only for use by Navy Yard employees. And according </a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150326000818/http://www.streetsblog.org/2012/10/23/citi-bike-kiosks-running-in-previews-for-brooklyn-navy-yard-workers/">to Streetsblog</a>, they&apos;re not actually allowed to leave the yard.</p>
