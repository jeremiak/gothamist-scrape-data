<p>Once in a while, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502092356/http://gothamist.com/tags/nytimes">the NY Times takes a break</a> from increasingly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502092356/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/26/ny_times_a_bad_credit_score_is_like.php">self-parodying trend stories</a> and fawning over the latest <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502092356/http://gawker.com/5920269/the-new-york-times-profiled-the-brant-brothers-because-the-new-york-times-hates-you">skin-crawling style icons</a> to do some <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502092356/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/08/nyregion/in-queens-and-high-above-the-floods-still-feeling-hurricane-sandys-sting.html">superlative reporting</a>, incredible <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502092356/http://www.nytimes.com/projects/2012/snow-fall/#/?part=tunnel-creek">multimedia pieces</a>, or make up surprisingly handy new words. The NY Times Magazine has been publishing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502092356/https://twitter.com/lizzieskurnick">Lizzie Skurnick&apos;s</a> imaginative &quot;That Should Be A Word&quot; pieces for quite a while now, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502092356/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/06/magazine/the-sweet-smell-of-retail.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">today&apos;s word</a> struck us as particular useful: Fidgital.</p>

<blockquote>Fidgital (FIJ-IH-TULL), ADJ.

<p>1. Excessively checking one&#x2019;s devices. &#x201C;Victoria grew tired of watching her fidgital fianc&#xE9; glance at his iPhone every five seconds.&#x201D; See also: Supdate (food-related status); keybard (a skilled texter).</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>Sure, we can&apos;t say we&apos;re fans of &quot;keybard,&quot; but fidgital is an especially good term because it identifies a noxious trend that seems to have infiltrated every level of in-person social interactions. It&apos;s an epidemic we&apos;ve encountered in person too many times, and fallen prey to ourselves&#x2014;and it&apos;s led to many an awkward stand-off, especially when an argument starts with &quot;I have work obligations&quot; and ends up with &quot;So maybe I am a little OCD, so what?&quot;</p>

<p>And the fact that it sounds like it could be a cousin to that all-inclusive whimsical put-down &quot;flibbertigibbet&quot; only adds to the fun. Of course, we&apos;re a bit confused why it&apos;s spelled <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502092356/https://twitter.com/lizzieskurnick/status/287780995380441088">&quot;Figital&quot; in the accompanying graphic</a> rather than the more intuitive (at least to us) fidgital. It seems like the word touched a nerve on Twitter:</p>
