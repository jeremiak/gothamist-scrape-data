<p>A 19-year-old man was raped in a bathroom in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150525234634/http://gothamist.com/tags/unionsquare">Union Square Park</a> last night. According <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150525234634/http://awalkintheparknyc.blogspot.com/2013/06/19-year-old-male-raped-in-union-square_13.html">to A Walk In The Park</a>, the incident happened around 6:30 p.m. Wednesday night between E. 16/17th Streets near Union Square East.  The victim claims the suspect followed him into the men&apos;s bathroom and attacked him inside a stall.</p>

<p>The victim, who was taken to Bellevue Hospital, reportedly told cops he was &quot;in fear for his safety.&quot; The NYPD press office confirmed to us that there is an open investigation into the incident right now, but wouldn&apos;t comment further on it. </p>
