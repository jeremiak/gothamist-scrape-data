Nathan, a New Zealand native who has lived in NYC for the last seven years and currently resides in Williamsburg, set up shop at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430045142/http://www.intergroom.com/">New Jersey&#x2019;s Intergroom</a> dog grooming competition last year, and the results are his new photography book, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430045142/http://www.amazon.com/Groomed-Paul-Nathan/dp/0985136847/ref%3Dsr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1395241997&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=paul+nathan+pelluceo">&quot;Groomed.&quot;</a></p>

<p>&quot;I&apos;m interested in how much the nature of the dog shines through once it&apos;s groomed into a palm tree, or whatever,&quot; 43-year-old Nathan told us. &quot;How much of the dog do you feel? How much of the personality is still there? I would have to say, yeah, the personality is totally there. It&apos;s still very much that dog.&quot;</p>

<p>Nathan, whose previous books include &quot;Generation Ink: Williamsburg, Brooklyn&quot; and &quot;Couture Dogs of New York,&quot; was able to capture moments of pre-show preparations in studio portraits featuring poodles, cockerspaniels, bichon frises, bedlington terriers, komondors and more&#x2014;and that includes the creative grooming, photos of which you can see above. &quot;My main job is as a fashion photographer, I shoot look books and fashion ads,&quot; he explained. &quot;So I was looking for something visual, and started seeing pictures of amazingly groomed dogs on Facebook, and thought, wow, that might be a really amazing project to get into.&quot;</p>

<p>Since he already had some experience taking dog photos for his previous book, and had contacts in the grooming world, it wasn&apos;t hard for him to dive in&#x2014;which meant working with both demanding dogs and demanding owners, including members of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430045142/http://www.groomteamusa.org/">US national dog grooming team</a>. &quot;They were, in general, suspicious of my motives,&quot; he said about the dog owners. &quot;And I certainly wasn&apos;t trying to make fun of them. I prefer to stay neutral.&quot;</p>

<p>Our number one question, of course, was whether he thought the dogs were okay with being poked and prodded for the incredible elaborate getups: &quot;From what I observed, these dogs are used to it,&quot; he reasoned. &quot;They&apos;re special dogs, with lots of patience. Not all dogs can be competitive grooming dogs. They have a lot of experience. That&apos;s what they do.&quot; At the same time, he admits, &quot;It&apos;s probably not something I would do to my dog, if I was to have one, but I think it&apos;s certainly an artistic expression, and a creative expression.&quot;</p>

<p>Nathan has a lot of new projects in the works, including a children&apos;s book about a cat with a huge wardrobe that comes to New York and has an adventure, a series on female bodybuilders (&quot;When you go backstage at one of those [competitions] your mouth drops, it&apos;s just so out there. Everyone&apos;s bathed in this brown oil and...it&apos;s out there. More out there than dogs being done up&quot;), and one on buildings around NYC (&quot;There&apos;s all sorts of really interesting modern or old buildings in NY that people don&apos;t usually photograph, so I&apos;ve been trying to capture them in a way that moves me&quot;).</p>

<p>But he still plans on going back to the Intergroom competition when it returns in April and taking more photos on the final day of the competition. &quot;My feeling is that these people are an easy target to deride or criticize, but they&apos;re not harming the dogs from what I could see,&quot; he said. &quot;<strong>Yeah, they&apos;re a little bit kooky, but they&apos;re creative...they&apos;re making the world a more colorful place.</strong>&quot;</p>
