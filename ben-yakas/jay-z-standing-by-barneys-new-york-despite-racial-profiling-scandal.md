                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="111613jayz.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20131122031735im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/111613jayz.jpg" width="640" height="480"> <br> <i> AP</i></div> <p></p>

<p>In the last month, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131122031735/http://gothamist.com/tags/jayz">Jay Z</a> has come under fire for not withdrawing from his business relationship with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131122031735/http://gothamist.com/tags/barneys">Barneys New York</a>, the company that has been widely condemned in after at least two customers came forward to sue the retailer for unjustly accusing them of thievery. After giving it a lot of deep thought, Jay Z has ultimately decided to stick with the corporation he knows. After all, he&apos;s a business man, not a business, man (who will lose out on any opportunities to make money and continue to promoting his brand).</p>

<p>&#x201C;While I await the findings of the attorney general&#x2019;s office, I have agreed to move forward with the launch of BNY SCC collection under the condition that I have a leadership role and seat on a council specifically convened to deal with the issue of racial profiling,&#x201D; Jay Z <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131122031735/http://lifeandtimes.com/a-statement-from-shawn-jay-z-carter-2">wrote on his website.</a> </p>

<p>On the plus side, he&apos;s decided that 100% of the proceeds, instead of the original 25%, from the collection will go to the Shawn Carter Foundation. On the other hand, he&apos;s still supporting a company that has pretty much been caught red-handed racially profiling blacks and Latinos.</p>

<p>But hey, Jay Z thinks he can change from within the system:</p>

<blockquote>I am in a unique position to use my voice to effect change to this disturbing issue. The easy position would have been to walk away and leave policy making to others hoping that someone addresses the problem. I will not leave the outcome to others. I will take this into my own hands with full power to recommend, review and revise policies and guidelines moving forward. I am choosing to take this head on.</blockquote>

<p>So let&apos;s not get bogged down thinking about discrimination and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131122031735/http://pagesix.com/2013/11/15/jay-z-sticks-with-barneys-amid-shop-and-frisk-furor/?_ga=1.212121428.1156324577.1348938752">potential boycotts</a>&#x2014;as Larry Wilmore explained on The Daily Show, this is actually a moment to celebrate: &quot;White people have been watching their musical icons sell out to corporations for decades. It&apos;s the American dream and we&apos;re finally achieving it. You go Jay Z Penny!&quot;</p>
