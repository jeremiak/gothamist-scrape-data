<p>As recently as this October, concerned nannies <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170314113553/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20121010/clinton-hill/nanny-battles-porn-policy-at-brooklyn-public-library">were continuing to fight</a> to get &quot;full blown porn&quot; out of our <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170314113553/http://gothamist.com/tags/library">public libraries</a>. But as any New Yorker with a library card knows, we have a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170314113553/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/25/public_libraries_defend_constitutio.php">constitutional right</a> to enjoy <em>Lord Of The Cock Rings</em> in the comfort of a dimly-lit city building if we want. And in case you doubted the passion with which NYers tend to exercise that right, just take a look at the video below. Warning: what he&apos;s watching is a little NSFW.</p>
