<p>It&apos;s still freezing outside, but summer is right around the corner if you squint hard enough. And nothing screams summertime like summer music festival season: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170326081417/http://gothamist.com/tags/northsidefestival">Northside Festival</a> has announced their initial lineup for this year&apos;s festivities, which includes headlining performances from the likes of Dirty Projectors, Miguel, Kamasi Washington, and Thursday.</p>

<p>This year&apos;s event will take place from June 7th to 11th at various venues around Brooklyn, with the headliners taking the stage at McCarren Park. This is only one of two shows the newly pared-down Dirty Projectors (whom we spoke to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170326081417/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/09/david_longstreth.php">in 2012</a>) have on the books so far; there will also be performances by the likes of PUP, Craig Leon &amp; Martin Rev, Downtown Boys, Elvis Depressedly, Elysia Crampton, The Explosion, Foodman, Girlpool, Happyness, Hoops, The Hotelier, Jay Som, L&#xE6;titia Sadier, Lower Dens (performing songs from ABBA&apos;s <em>Gold: Greatest Hits</em>), Mary Timony (performing Helium material), Mirah, The Pains of Being Pure at Heart and more. </p>

<p>As <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170326081417/http://www.brooklynvegan.com/northside-fest-announces-initial-2017-lineup/">Brooklyn Vegan noted</a>, no headliner has been announced for Friday night&apos;s show yet, so there may be more bands to be announced.</p>

<p>You can see the announcements below. In addition to the musical performers, there will also be a series of lectures and talks as part of The Northside Innovation portion of the event: &quot;The initial speaker lineup this year includes one of SNL&#x2019;s brightest stars, Sasheer Zamata; cutting-edge President &amp; Publisher of The FADER Andy Cohn; bridge between nonprofits and reporters, Vice Impact Publisher Katherine Keating; founder of internet community SuicideGirls redefining beauty, Missy Suicide; and explorer of current affairs and contemporary life through opinionated documentaries, NY Times Op-Docs Producer/Curator Kathleen Lingo. Many more innovators will be added to the event&#x2019;s extensive lineup in the coming months.&quot;</p>
