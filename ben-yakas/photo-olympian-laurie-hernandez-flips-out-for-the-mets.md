<p>Okay, <em>technically speaking</em>, the New Jersey native&apos;s actual throw to the plate was a bit off-the-mark, but the flip before it was completely dazzling. &quot;As soon as I found out I was throwing the first pitch I was just like, &apos;Oh, I should throw a flip in there,&apos;&quot; she <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161113141951/http://m.mlb.com/video/topic/8878828/v1131726183/wshnym-hernandez-on-first-pitch-experience-in-rio">told MLB.com.</a></p>

<p>She also got to meet David Wright and her personal favorite player, Noah Syndergaard, who loomed over her like an Asgardian giant who took his fashion cues from <em>Rocky III</em>.</p>

<p>A short while after the flip, the Mets beat the Washington Nationals 3-1 to move to just one game out of the second wild card slot. This calls for a celebration with a bottle full of bub and the throwing arm of a Mini Inflatable Sky Air Dancer Dancing Man.</p>
