										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:365px; "> <img alt="32011pipo.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150808124201im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/32011pipo.jpg" width="365" height="486"> <br> <i><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150808124201/http://www.flickr.com/photos/98599181@N00/646592734/">adrian in japan&apos;s flickr</a></i></div> Did you know that the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department has its own mascot? Named Pipo-kun, he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150808124201/http://www.japanstyle.info/01/entry3669.html">was created</a> in 1987 to encourage friendlier relations between citizens and the police department. His name is pronounced &#x201C;Pee-Po&#x201D;, taken from &#x201C;PEople&#x201D; and &#x201C;POlice&#x201D;, and he sometimes looks a little like Mighty Mouse. He shows up at any Tokyo police event, has some brother and sister mascots, and even has his own <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150808124201/http://www.keishicho.metro.tokyo.jp/sikumi/pipo/music/pipo_song.htm">theme song</a>! So it got us thinking: why doesn&apos;t the NYPD have a mascot? <p></p>

<p>Sure, there&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150808124201/http://www.mcgruff.org/">McGruff the Crime Dog</a>, but he isn&apos;t showing up at every NYPD event, nor is his face on cop cars. He isn&apos;t synonymous with the NYPD the way that Pipo-kun is with the Tokyo police. So what are your ideas for an NYPD mascot? We&apos;ll go one further: if you are artistically minded, illustrate your idea for an NYPD mascot, send it to us at tips@gothamist.com, and we&apos;ll put up the best ones this week. We won&apos;t worry about a theme song for now.</p>
