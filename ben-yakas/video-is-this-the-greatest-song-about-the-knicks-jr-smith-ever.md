<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150216075544/http://gothamist.com/tags/knicks">Knicks</a> fans don&apos;t have much to be happy about right now: almost half the team is injured, Carmelo Anthony is a mess, and the whole season seems to be teetering on the brink of free fall. Really, Knicks fans can use any excuse to smile&#x2014;which is just what this music video tribute to sixth man JR Smith will do. Milford Jerome, who performs &quot;So Right&quot;, nails everything we love about the madly inconsistent, Twitter-friendly star: &quot;To score you need to shoot/to score more you need to shoot more.&quot; Watch it below, and don&apos;t forget to tell Iman Shumpert to get a haircut.</p>

<p>In case you were wondering: yes, this is the greatest song ever about JR Smith. But it is not the best song <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150216075544/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcxpcAZqMo8">about&#x2014;or by&#x2014;Shumpert.</a></p>
