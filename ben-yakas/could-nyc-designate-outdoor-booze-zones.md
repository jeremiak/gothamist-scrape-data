<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150712011412/http://gothamist.com/2008/07/08/public_drinking.php">Public drinking</a> has long been the final frontier for many legal NYers. Marty Markowitz <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150712011412/http://gothamist.com/2009/07/20/marty_markowitz_caught_stoop_drinki.php">doesn&apos;t see why</a> people can&apos;t drink on their stoops, and even Mayor Bloomberg has seemed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150712011412/http://gothamist.com/2009/08/25/bloomberg_talks_booze.php">sympathetic</a> to people who want a bottle of Red while watching the Philharmonic in the park. And yet, in this age of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150712011412/http://gothamist.com/tags/tedwilliams">magical homeless people</a>, we still aren&apos;t allowed to chug our Four Lokos on a park bench in peace! Maybe we can take a page from England: police in Essex are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150712011412/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/8243213/Drunks-to-be-given-booze-zone-so-they-can-drink-in-peace.html">considering creating</a> designated &quot;booze zones&quot; to allow drinkers to get a taste without disturbing the general public. </p>

<p>We already know that drinking will make you <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150712011412/http://consumerist.com/2011/01/drinking-more-makes-your-exercise-more.html">exercise more</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150712011412/http://gothamist.com/2010/08/30/new_study_drinkers_live_longer_than.php">live longer</a>, so there&apos;s no downside here, especially since we are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150712011412/http://gothamist.com/2010/12/29/nyc_not_that_drunk_after_all.php">very responsible</a> binge drinkers.</p>
