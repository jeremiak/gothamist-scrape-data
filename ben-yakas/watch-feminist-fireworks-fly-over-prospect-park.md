<p>Last night, artist Judy Chicago picked up where <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408125528/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGJuMBdaqIw">Katy Perry left off</a> and finally unleashed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408125528/http://gothamist.com/2014/04/16/feminist_fireworks_erupting_in_pros.php">her &quot;feminist&quot; fireworks</a> over Prospect Park&apos;s Long Meadow. Chicago, best known for her work <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408125528/http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/exhibitions/dinner_party/">&quot;The Dinner Party&quot;</a> (in which plates are adorned with images of female genitalia), celebrated her 75th birthday with her installation &quot;A Butterfly for Brooklyn.&quot; Watch it below, and you can decide whether they look more like butterflies or vaginas, and how this may or may not be a commentary on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408125528/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWnP9r222DY">Crazy Town.</a></p>

<p>In the video above, you can see Chicago in the foreground atop a cherry picker watching the event. As the uploader wrote, &quot;It looks oddly like she&apos;s overseeing the raining apocalyptic hellfire down on the world below&quot;...except, you know, with female genitalia. Check out a longer video of the explosions, along with some more photos, below.</p>
