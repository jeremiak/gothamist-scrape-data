<p>It&apos;s been quite a week for NYU: first came news of the imminent closing of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717104020/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/11/greenwich_village_cheap_eats_mainst.php">beloved cheap eats mecca Dojo</a>, then a professor was caught <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717104020/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/15/nyu_professor_arrested_for.php">taking upskirt video of ladies in a changing room</a>. But one film major did his best to one-up both of those reports by staging <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717104020/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAEezUtSYRA&amp;list=UUceeqQ4PI8NpmeVo01-zyaA&amp;index=4">an annoying &quot;experimental&quot; project</a> that was wildly successful in pissing off everyone around him and landing him in a psych ward for a few days. Brace yourself, and watch the definition of an irritating artsy fartsy experimental project below.</p>

<p>It&apos;s a long video, so we&apos;ll help summarize it for you: it&apos;s shot from the perspective of the student, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717104020/https://twitter.com/____V__">Vincent Saverio Macaluso</a>, in his screenplay seminar class last month. Just before the four minute mark, he starts playing music loudly; his professor asks him to turn it down, but Macaluso ignores him (even when he gets in his face) and turns the music louder. To the professor&apos;s credit, he immediately picks up on the fact &quot;there&apos;s something else going on here&quot; besides the kid being disrespectful. </p>

<p>The video goes on for another 10 minutes or so of escalating tension set to Rage Against the Machine songs as fellow students join in asking for him to stop whatever he&apos;s doing; around the 11 minute mark, Macaluso calls one classmate a &quot;fuckin&apos; faggot&quot; and &quot;fuckin&apos; retard.&quot; After interrupting the class for nearly 20 minutes, security finally arrives. In the epilogue, Macaluso claims he was handcuffed and taken to Beth Israel Hospital against his will. </p>

<p>Macaluso <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717104020/http://nyulocal.com/on-campus/2013/05/14/nyu-film-student-rages-against-the-machine-and-interrupts-class/">told NYU Local that</a> he was just acting as part of an experimental film: &#x201C;I would say it&#x2019;s an experiment in existentialism,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;Other people that appear in it are not aware that I am acting.&#x201D; He claims that he was held at the hospital for three days while the staff encouraged him to admit himself to the psych ward. On YouTube, Macaluso says the film has something to do with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717104020/http://www.infowars.com/infowars-launches-operation-paul-revere/">InfoWars&apos; Paul Revere project</a> (&quot;Create a film promoting liberty whether the subject is a hot one like the 2nd Amendment or something less well known like Agenda 21 or new forms of slavery like those in Chinese factories&quot;), although it&apos;s hard to tell whether he sincerely buys into Alex Jones&apos;s anti-government rhetoric, or if he&apos;s just commenting on it.  </p>

<p>As for his justifiably irritated classmates, he is adamant that the whole experiment was a worthwhile endeavor and not a living breathing example of why people hate film majors. &#x201C;If one of the students was offended by something the character I was playing said, then absolutely [I&apos;d apologize],&quot; he told NYU Local. <strong>&quot;This project was intended to be an artistic expression. That&#x2019;s what I go to school for.&#x201D;</strong></p>

<p>This isn&apos;t the first time that Macaluso&#x2014;who has a lot of experimental short films <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717104020/http://www.youtube.com/user/vmac93/videos">on his YouTube page</a>&#x2014;claims he&apos;s been arrested for Rage Against The Machine-related crimes:</p>
