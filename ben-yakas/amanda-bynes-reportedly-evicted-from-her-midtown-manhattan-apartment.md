<p>It&apos;s been literally days&#x2014;a long, bongless, wacky wig-lacking lifetime&#x2014;since we heard anything from everyone&apos;s favorite current star undergoing a truly sad public meltdown, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160306123849/http://gothamist.com/tags/amandabynes">Amanda Bynes</a>. But it seems there&apos;s a very good reason there&apos;s been no reports of vase throwing or scarf yanking in midtown: Bynes has reportedly been evicted from her apartment. </p>

<p>According <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160306123849/http://www.intouchweekly.com/stars/news/exclusive-amanda-bynes-kicked-out-nyc-apartment-evicted-drugs-marijuana-arrested-homeless">to In Touch</a>, she was actually quietly kicked out on Tuesday: &#x201C;At 9 p.m. on Tuesday, movers showed up and removed Amanda&#x2019;s belongings from her apartment,&#x201D; their source told them. &#x201C;She is officially gone from the building.&#x201D; </p>

<p>It sounds like the whole bong-throwing incident was just the straw that broke the celebrity&apos;s back: &#x201C;Even before her arrest, residents had constant complaints about the smell of marijuana coming from her apartment,&#x201D; the source said. &#x201C;She had also cursed out residents and the doormen, and the smell of pot from her apartment was really annoying people.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Another source&#x2014;a photographer who has spent time with Bynes recently&#x2014;also disputes Bynes&apos; claims that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160306123849/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/25/_view_more_videos_at.php#photo-1">she doesn&apos;t smoke pot</a>. &#x201C;She had at least a dozen hand-rolled joints on her,&#x201D; the photographer told them. &#x201C;She had them in her palm at one point &#x2014; she&apos;ll smoke one halfway, put it out. Then light a new one. Then re-light the other half. It&#x2019;s so weird! But she is constantly smoking weed.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Since the eviction, Bynes has been spotted <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160306123849/http://www.intouchweekly.com/stars/news/amanda-bynes-skyzone-rep-confirms-visit">hanging out and bouncing on a trampoline in Buffalo</a>, which sounds like the punchline of an existential joke.</p>
