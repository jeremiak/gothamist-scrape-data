<p>We have some painful, obvious news for all you single people out there: you&apos;re wasting your money. And your time, but mostly your money (as if you didn&apos;t already suspect this). Just find someone, pick anyone really, and you&apos;ll save thousands. That&apos;s what we&apos;ve gleaned from a new analysis of spending habits of single people vs. married people in NYC, made <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130401043928/http://money.bundle.com/article/cost-being-single-why-shacking-leads-saving-money">by Bundle.</a> </p>

<p>According to their data, taken from July 2009 to June 2010, a &quot;typical&quot; 26-35-year-old single female and single male earning between $40,000 and $50,000 spent a combined average of $5,255 a month (not including rent). If they were married and combined their incomes, they would have spent $4,079 within the same time period, which means they&apos;re losing around $14,000 a year by being single. Of course, the survey doesn&apos;t take into account the manner in which the married couples are saving quite a lot, perhaps by watching season-long marathons of <em>The Mentalist</em> on Saturday evenings while sharing a half-price bubble tea. And they leave out any talk of that dreaded plague upon happy young marriages, children. </p>

<p>So look us in the eye and tell us if we&apos;re <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130401043928/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BUeO5YGF2Q">satisfied</a> by these findings. Do these numbers ring true to you? Do most men <em>really</em> spend $172 a month on clothing?</p>
