<p>An Upper East Side gynecologist <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502231929/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/nyc-gynecologist-charged-patient-sex-abuse-article-1.1835123">has been indicted</a> for allegedly sexually abusing at least six of his patients, most of whom were pregnant. Dr. Robert Hadden, 55, is accused of fondling and performing oral sex on the unsuspecting women between September 2011 and June 2012. He&apos;s been charged with two counts of forcible touching, five counts of criminal sex act and two counts of sexual abuse.</p>

<p>In addition to the allegations of oral sex and fondling, Hadden also allegedly performed &quot;overly frequent and invasive breast exams&quot; and asked patients &quot;invasive questions about their sex lives.&quot; &#x201C;He was absolutely a predator,&quot; said lawyer Anthony DiPietro, who is representing some of the women. </p>

<p>Hadden worked at New York-Presbyterian/Columbia Hospital when the assaults allegedly happened; he stopped seeing patients in 2012 after two went to police and filed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502231929/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/sex-abuse-allegations-gynecologist-pile-article-1.1396843">separate civil lawsuits</a> against him. One of those lawsuits was dropped after a judge ordered the woman&apos;s lawyer to put her real name (not Jane Doe) on the court papers; the other lawsuit was thrown out by the same judge because the victim&apos;s lawyer did not meet a deadline to serve papers to the other side. </p>

<p>Hadden&apos;s lawyer said <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502231929/http://nypost.com/2014/06/18/gynecologist-charged-with-sexual-abuse-against-patients/">in a statement</a>: &quot;Dr Hadden is a physician with an impeccable reputation and looks forward to defending himself against these charges in a court of law.&quot;</p>
