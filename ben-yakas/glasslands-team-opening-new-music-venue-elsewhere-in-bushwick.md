<p>It&apos;s been almost two years since beloved down-and-dirty Williamsburg club <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028104451/http://gothamist.com/tags/glasslands">Glasslands</a> shuttered, leaving a DIY-sized hole in the hearts of underground music fans across Brooklyn. Now, the former owners of that club are gearing up to launch their next venue, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028104451/http://www.elsewherebrooklyn.com/">Elsewhere</a>, in Bushwick.</p>

<p>Elsewhere is a $3 million, 24,000 square-foot music venue and arts space opening in a converted Bushwick warehouse at 599 Johnson Avenue later this fall (just off the Jefferson L stop). The venue will include  multiple performance spaces, high-end audio/visual capabilities, an open rooftop, art gallery and loft bar. Of the five main spaces, the largest, a 5,000 square-foot performance hall, will host live music and dance music, and serve as a space for multi-disciplinary events, while a smaller, 1,200 square-foot performance space, will showcase emerging artists. </p>

<p>There is also the Skybridge Gallery, a small art gallery above the outdoor courtyard that will be open in tandem with the Loft Bar (which will have a small food menu along with full bar and coffee). </p>

<p>&quot;We started looking for a location in the winter of 2013, and it took us about a year and a half to find it,&quot; said co-founder Dhruv Chopra in a statement. &quot;The back lot was filled with massive shipping containers. Large portions of the building were covered in rusting corrugated steel. Architecturally, the building is a labyrinth, it&apos;s weird. And there was this disused floating bridge structure hovering above the courtyard. I think most people would have looked at the building and thought &apos;This isn&apos;t the right spot for a music venue,&apos; but we felt an immediate connection to it. It was obvious to us. It felt like Elsewhere.&quot;</p>

<p>Also different for the Glasslands team: unlike that venue, which for many years thumbed its nose at things like building codes, this new space is all by-the-book. But that doesn&apos;t mean they&apos;re joining the standard music industry juggernaut: instead of using ubiquitous concert promoters Live Nation, the founders are planning to book a majority of shows through their own production company, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028104451/http://www.popgunpresents.com/">PopGun Presents.</a></p>

<p>&quot;I was actually living in Bushwick in the early days of booking Glasslands, and a big challenge was trying to convince national and international touring bands to come play Williamsburg for their U.S. debut shows instead of the Lower East Side,&quot; said co-founder Rami Haykal. &quot;Those venues were better facilities, but Brooklyn had energy. Bushwick reminds me of that time; there&apos;s a chance to give our artists and audiences a home again, more than just open another venue.&quot;</p>
