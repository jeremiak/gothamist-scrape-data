</div></div><p>Yo La Tengo squeezed more than a drop of good will from a sugarcube last night at Maxwell&apos;s in Hoboken. The band performed a last-minute <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130718082730/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/23/yo_la_tengo_playing_japan_benefit_t.php">Japan Benefit Concert</a> to a packed room of sweaty record store clerks&#x2014;all the proceeds went to Peace Winds Japan, a Tokyo-based non-profit organization helping those displaced by the recent disaster. But in typical Yo La Tengo fashion, they weren&apos;t alone: SNL star Fred Armisen sat in on drums for the entire show, Glenn Mercer of The Feelies joined them for four songs, and legendary bike enthusiast <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130718082730/http://gothamist.com/2008/03/14/david_byrne_mus.php">David Byrne</a> dropped by in grandfatherly overalls for a handful of tunes as well during the invigorating, nearly-three hour show.</p>

<p>The band was in particularly fun, raunchy form for the two-set show, playing a wide range of their best loved songs, some acoustic rarities, and covers, including an eyeball-popping run through of Velvet Underground classic &quot;Run, Run, Run.&quot; Highlights from the first set included the bass-groovy &quot;Moby Octopad,&quot; the keyboard-pounding &quot;Periodically Double Or Triple,&quot; a lonesome version of &quot;Tears Are In Your Eyes&quot; with Byrne on harmonies, and a slowed-down, spacey version of Talking Heads classic &quot;Thank You For Sending Me An Angel.&quot; </p>

<p>Somehow the band delivered an even better second set, unloading every huge guitar song in their arsenal, including &quot;Decora,&quot; &quot;Sugarcube,&quot; &quot;Cherry Chapstick&quot; and &quot;From A Motel 6.&quot; The highlight of the night may have been the absolutely destructive guitar freakout of &quot;Pass The Hatchet, I Think I&apos;m Goodkind,&quot; which saw guitarist Ira Kaplan utilizing every trick he knew with his pedals, and even found him switching guitars midway through the song without losing a beat. Overall, it was definitely the best set we&apos;ve ever seen the band play together.</p>

<p>Below, you can see a video of Yo La Tengo rocking out &quot;Little Eyes&quot;, performing a rare acoustic version of &quot;Black Flowers,&quot; and David Byrne giving a typically enthralling history lesson on revolutions before playing a new song:</p>
