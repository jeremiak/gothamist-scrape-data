<p>FDNY said it was not clear yet exactly what caused the collapse, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408140926/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2013/07/11/gas-explosion-causes-partial-collapse-of-lower-manhattan-building/">though CBS claims</a> it was an apparent gas explosion.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408140926/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20130711/chinatown/explosion-partially-destroys-chinatown-building">According to DNAInfo</a>, the explosion was caused by bug bombs. Police sources tell them that one of nearly two dozen pesticide canisters, used to kill roaches and such insects, went off in Piao Liang Ren Sheng Beauty Salon in the rear of the building&apos;s first floor, causing the rest to go off in succession. That mass explosion knocked over a load-bearing joist. </p>
