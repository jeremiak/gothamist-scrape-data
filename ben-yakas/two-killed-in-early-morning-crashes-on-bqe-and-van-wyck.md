A man driving a BMW <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501163338/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Speeding-Car-Tree-Van-Wyck-Fire-Deadly-Accident-133768418.html">had been speeding</a> on the Van Wyck in Queens around 2:15 a.m.&#x2014;he lost control of his car when he attempted to exit at Atlantic Ave., and ended up crashing into a tree in front of Jamaica Hospital. The car burst into flames, killing the driver. A witness told a nearby a Gourmet Deli cashier that &quot;he saw him doing about 80 on the freeway as he was passing by him. He said he didn&apos;t even slow down when he came off the ramp, then he hit the tree.&#x201D;<p></p>

<p>The car slammed into a blue postal service mail drop box&#x2014;knocking it out of the ground&#x2014;before hitting the tree in front of the Jamaica Pavilion for Nursing and Rehabilitation near the corner of 91st Street. The driver, who hasn&apos;t been identified yet, was pronounced dead at the scene.</p>

<p>In a separate incident, a motorcyclist was killed after rear-ending a street sweeping truck on the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway. The accident happened around 2:30 a.m., on the eastbound side of the BQE near the Queens Boulevard exit when traffic slowed for another accident. &#x201C;When he hit me he actually moved the truck. He pushed it forward. My foot was on the brake,&#x201D; the shaken sweeper driver, 70-year-old Pearlie Felder, told the Daily News. The motorcyclist was also pronounced dead at the scene. </p>
