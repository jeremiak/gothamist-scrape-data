title: Want Kanye For Your Bar Mitzvah? Pay $1 Million!

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="5811kanye.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811135945im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/5811kanye.jpg" width="365" height="256" class="image-left"> </span>Earlier this year, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811135945/http://gothamist.com/tags/kanyewest">Kanye West</a> was the big featured performer at the sweet sixteen birthday party for artist George Condo&apos;s daughter at the Standard Hotel. According <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811135945/http://www.nypost.com/p/pagesix/gift_from_kanye_pqz000OEoUR3MlowmHod7K">to the Post</a>, he even performed his 30-minute set for free. Well, Kanye may play your sweet sixteen for free, but the man has limits people! West <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811135945/http://www.nypost.com/p/pagesix/kanye_demand_nixed_ETOk0JDggw9g1yfec8b8BN">allegedly demanded</a> $1 million to play at the bar mitzvah of the son of former NBC head Jeff Zucker. Maybe Kayne was holding a grudge because of <em>Joey</em>?</p>

<p>Zucker toyed with the idea of offering Kanye $800,000 for the lavish bar mitzvah, which took place at the Four Seasons last night for his son Andrew. But in the end, Zucker decided to slum it with the more reasonably priced Drake; he allegedly only spent around $250,000 altogether on the affair, which is pennies compared to some <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811135945/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/19/have_bar_mitvah_parties_gotten_too.php">extravagant bar mitzvah&apos;s</a> we&apos;ve heard about. But Does that means that Drake is the rich poor-man&apos;s Kanye? Maybe Drake decided to do it for free, since <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811135945/http://www.jewishfamilyservice.net/half-jewish/rapper-drake-talks-about-his-bar-mitzvah">he knows</a> all about how special bar mitzvahs are for young mensches. </p>
