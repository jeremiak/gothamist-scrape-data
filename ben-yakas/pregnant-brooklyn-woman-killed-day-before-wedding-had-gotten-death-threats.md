<p>Yesterday morning, an 8 1/2 months pregnant Brooklyn woman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502174328/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/20/pregnant_brooklyn_woman_found_fatal.php">was found fatally stabbed in the neck</a> inside her Brownsville apartment, the day before her wedding was to take place. Vindalee Smith, 38, was pronounced dead in her home on East 94th Street around 9:30 a.m. Saturday morning. Smith, a member of the Seventh Day Adventist Church, had previously received death threats from a former neighbor: &#x201C;She had some issues with some people in the past who had actually threatened to kill her and her entire family,&#x201D; her pastor Ferron Francis, of the New Dimension Church, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502174328/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/preg_mom_of_slain_in_brook_yn_EKi5tCPFdGif7pdwFcltYO">told the Post.</a></p>

<p>The threats seemed to stop when Smith moved to Brownsville, but she told the pastor she had received new threats just two weeks ago. Smith, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502174328/http://www.wpix.com/news/wpix-pregnant-bride-murdered-stabbed-story,0,1049079.story">who worked for</a> a geriatric, home health-care agency, has four children, including two teenage boys and two girls in their 20&apos;s. Her eldest daughter, Monique, arrived at her home yesterday for the baby shower for her soon-to-be-born brother, only to learn the devastating news: &#x201C;Monique fell on the floor and couldn&#x2019;t get up,&#x201D; said a friend from Smith&#x2019;s church, whose members had been set to throw her a shower last night. &#x201C;It was so sad. She came for a baby shower and a wedding&#x2014;but now she has to stay for a funeral.&#x201D;</p>

<p>&#x201C;I can&#x2019;t even begin to imagine who would want to do that,&#x201D; Smith&#x2019;s friend, Sybil Samuel, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502174328/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/pregnant-bride-stabbed-death-day-wedding-article-1.1188307">told the News</a>. &#x201C;It would be the devil to kill a woman with a child in her stomach. They killed two people.&#x201D; A neighbor <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502174328/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2012/10/21/brooklyn-mother-mourned-on-what-was-to-be-her-wedding-day/">told CBS</a>, &#x201C;Satan is the instigator. He&#x2019;s only the devil. Satan and his angels that would commit this thing.&#x201D; Police said there was no sign of forced entry and no weapon was recovered at Smith&#x2019;s apartment. They&apos;ve questioned Smith&apos;s fiance as well, who has not been named a suspect, and the investigation is ongoing.</p>
