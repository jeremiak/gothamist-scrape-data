<p>On Wednesday, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140205194254/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/01/person_struck_by_train_at_times_squ.php">the FDNY confirmed that</a> a person was struck by a train at the Times Square subway station. Police now say that the 23-year-old man was dragged by the train when he ran alongside it and slipped and fell between moving cars.</p>

<p>According <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140205194254/http://nypost.com/2014/01/02/near-tragedy-as-subway-drags-new-years-reveler/">to the Post</a>, the unidentified man had just missed the uptown 1 train just after 3 a.m. Wednesday morning, and ran alongside banging on doors when he slipped. His leg got caught between cars, and he was dragged 40 feet before the train stopped.</p>

<p>&quot;He was saying, &apos;I can&#x2019;t feel my legs, I can&#x2019;t feel my legs, I think I&#x2019;m going to die!&apos;&quot; said witness and TV producer Cathy Chermol Schrijver, who held his hand as he waited to be taken to the hospital. He yelled, &#x201C;&apos;My legs are off!&#x2019; No, no, you&#x2019;re legs are on, I told him,&#x201D; she added, telling him, &quot;You&#x2019;re in the best city in the world. You&#x2019;re doing OK. Look at all these people trying to help you. They&#x2019;re going to get your legs going the right way.&quot;</p>

<p>The man is expected to survive and keep both legs.</p>
