<p>A Connecticut man has been arrested for allegedly beating his wife with a baseball bat after she told him she was leaving him. Michael DeMaio, 55, has been charged with attempted murder and first-degree assault in the attack on wife Diane DeMaio, 54, who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130915075816/http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-504083_162-57602507-504083/michael-demaio-update-greenwich-conn-man-arraigned-on-charges-he-tried-to-kill-wife-with-baseball-bat/">CBS reports</a> suffered severe injuries likely resulting in brain damage. &quot;I lost it, I just lost it,&quot; Michael DeMaio reportedly told cops after being arrested.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130915075816/http://www.ctpost.com/local/article/Greenwich-cops-probe-attempted-murder-4804524.php#photo-5170689">According to the Greenwich Times</a>, he became enraged shortly after learning from his wife, a local nutritionist with whom he has three adult children, was leaving him on Tuesday evening. Police responded to a domestic disturbance call from the couple&apos;s  $7.3 million estate in Greenwich where they found her in a pool of blood in an upstairs closet.</p>

<p>They wrote: &quot;Three ice packs formed a makeshift pillow under DeMaio&apos;s badly disfigured head, which police say was allegedly bludgeoned with a baseball bat by her unemployed husband, Michael DeMaio, in a crime of passion.&quot; He allegedly admitted to the first officer on the scene that he struck his wife numerous times on the head and body with the baseball bat.</p>

<p>Diane DeMaio&apos;s mother was also in the house at the time of the incident; she was reportedly yelling when police first entered. &quot;That monster hit her and she&apos;s dying,&quot; she said. &quot;I mean this is the craziest thing. I would have never expected this especially in this neighborhood.  People usually keep to themselves and they&apos;re usually good people,&quot; neighbor Jack Varvel <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130915075816/http://www.wtnh.com/news/crime/pd-wife-critically-injured-in-domestic-dispute">told local station WTNH.</a></p>
