<p>JFK has temporarily shut down this morning after a plane skidded off the runaway due to ice, snow and freezing rain. The small plane carrying 35 people landed safely from Toronto just before 8 a.m., and skidded off the runaway into the snow <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502161705/http://bigstory.ap.org/article/plane-skids-runway-nys-jfk-flights-halted">as it was taxiing</a>. No one on board was injured, but as a result, all domestic and international flights have been suspended as of 8:30 a.m. Service <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502161705/http://www.fly.faa.gov/flyfaa/flyfaaindex.jsp?ARPT=JFK&amp;p=0">is expected to resume</a> around 11:30 a.m., which will likely cause delays for the rest of the day.</p>

<p>The Port Authority recommends travelers check with their airline before heading to the airport. This seems to be the general mood of passengers stuck at the airport today:</p>
