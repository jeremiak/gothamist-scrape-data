<p>It&apos;s been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160525020816/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/02/report_nbc_wants_to_replace_jay_len.php">rumored for awhile now</a>, but it seems NBC might finally be ready to let go of the Jay Leno-shaped albatross they&apos;ve been carrying around their neck and hand over <em>The Tonight Show</em> baton <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160525020816/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/20/report_tonight_show_headed_back_to.php">to young whippersnapper Jimmy Fallon</a>. Fallon came to the 12:30 a.m. show an awkward former SNL-er whose movie career fizzled out (never forget: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160525020816/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCjiNBiEUaQ"><em>Taxi</em></a>) best known for breaking character in sketches&#x2014;and look at him now! He&apos;s the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160525020816/http://www.gq.com/style/wear-it-now/201304/jimmy-fallon-interview-gq-april-2013">Johnny Carson of his generation</a>! Point is, Fallon won a lot of skeptical people over (ourselves included), and he has no obvious successor (sorry Carson Daly). Below is our completely serious list of serious candidates who all deserve a chance to shine.</p>

<p><strong>Julie Klausner</strong>: She&apos;s wonderful, she&apos;s great at interviewing (just listen to her podcast, <em>How Was Your Week</em>), everyone should love her, she already has the job <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160525020816/https://twitter.com/julieklausner/status/314477074733731841">in our hearts.</a></p>

<p><strong>Aziz Ansari</strong>: His <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160525020816/https://twitter.com/azizansari/status/314091585493164032">insights into <em>Game Of Thrones</em></a> proves he&apos;s ready to ask the tough questions.</p>

<p><strong>A Cat</strong>: If the internet has proven anything, it&apos;s that we should just hand all media over to the cats. Bonus points if it&apos;s a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160525020816/http://gothamist.com/tags/bodegacats">Bodega Cat.</a></p>

<p><strong>Chris Gethard</strong>: He&apos;s a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160525020816/http://thechrisgethardshow.com/">fantastic interviewer</a>, and there&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160525020816/https://www.change.org/petitions/nbc-make-chris-gethard-the-new-host-of-late-night">already an online petition</a> in his favor, which must make him a frontrunner, right?</p>

<p><strong>Pat Kiernan</strong>: With NY1&apos;s entire brand <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160525020816/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/15/ny1_to_be_rebranded_as_twc_news_bec.php">hanging precariously in the balance</a>, it&apos;s about time Gothamist&apos;s favorite local news anchor brought a little charm to late night TV. </p>

<p><strong>Louis C.K.</strong>: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160525020816/http://gothamist.com/tags/louisck">Louis C.K.</a> should host everything. The end.</p>

<p><strong>Garry Shandling</strong>: The guy based much of his career on being a fake late night talk show host (give or take an <em>Iron Man 2</em> cameo). Unless he&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160525020816/http://www.gq.com/entertainment/humor/201008/comedy-issue/comedy-issue-garry-shandling">too busy boxing</a> or whatever. Bonus points if he does it in character as Larry Sanders.</p>

<p><strong>Jeffrey Tambor</strong>: There are only so many times that <em>Arrested Development</em> will be brought back from the dead. It&apos;s about time Hank Kingsley was promoted to Applesauce-In-Chief.</p>

<p><strong>Mark McGrath</strong>: At first glance, you may think this is just another joke candidate. But THINK about it...he could recruit Matchbox 20 as his house band. </p>

<p><strong>Liam Neeson</strong>: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160525020816/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/04/video_liam_neeson_curses_on_espn_do.php">One of the worst interviewees</a> would make for a suitably awkward host. And he loves <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160525020816/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2USXEJuvXT4">jokes about AIDS</a>! </p>

<p><strong>Kate Upton</strong>: If we make a YouTube <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160525020816/http://laist.com/2013/03/20/la_teen_asks_kate_upton_to_prom_via.php">asking her to be our late night host</a>, maybe she could fit it into her schedule. </p>

<p><strong>Questlove</strong>: Promote from within! Everyone already loves Questlove, and the novelty of a drum-playing-host who can give himself <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160525020816/http://instantrimshot.com/">instant rimshots</a> makes him a lock.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160525020816/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/20/jon_hamms_ham.php">Jon Ham&apos;s Ham</a></strong>: Let the caged ham sing. Sure it would be unusual, but it could pull in the female viewership in droves.</p>

<p><strong>Buzzfeed</strong>: Here are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160525020816/http://www.buzzfeed.com/mjs538/2010-amanda-bynes-vs-2013-amanda-bynes">14 ways that Buzzfeed could restore your faith</a> in <em>Late Night</em> hosts (LOL, nope, it&apos;s a link to a post about Amanda Bynes).</p>

<p><strong>Amy Poehler</strong>: Amy Poehler should host everything. The end.</p>

<p><strong>Psy/Bronx Zoo Cobra Twitter/Whatever Viral Video Is Hot That Week</strong>: When it comes down to it, who actually stays up to watch people in suits make wooden monologue jokes about Lindsay Lohan at 12:30 a.m. anymore? NBC needs the ratings&#x2014;ride the zeitgeist. </p>

<p><strong>Rex Ryan</strong>: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160525020816/http://gothamist.com/tags/rexryan">He&apos;s charismatic</a>, he&apos;s got funny tattoos, he&apos;s a sexy snack monster...and he&apos;s gonna be out of a job soon anyway, amirite?</p>

<p><strong>The cast of <em>Spring Breakers</em></strong>: Oh sure, the movie will have receded into the crevices of our memory by the time any actual successor is chosen. But between the neon bikinis and James Franco&apos;s grill, this is a no-brainer.</p>

<p><strong>Ant-Man</strong>: With <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160525020816/http://io9.com/edgar-wrights-ant-man-movie-test-footage-finally-revea-456796816">a major motion picture</a> coming out in 2015, Hank Pym can use all the help he can get turning himself into a household name, especially once it comes to light that he&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160525020816/http://www.comicvine.com/news/off-my-mind-is-hank-pym-a-wife-beater-or-did-he-get-a-bum-rap/143296/">a wife-abuser</a> with the power of those <em>Honey I Shrunk The Kids</em> kids. Then again, if he brings Edgar Wright along as his sidekick, all is forgiven.</p>

<p><strong>Conan O&apos;Brien</strong>: What&apos;s that guy been up to, anyway?</p>
