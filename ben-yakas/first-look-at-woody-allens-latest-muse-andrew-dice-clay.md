</div></div>					<p>Woody Allen has been filming on-and-off <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501174829/http://gothamist.com/2012/09/10/woody_allen_spotted_filming_on_the.php">on the Upper East Side</a> (give or take <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501174829/http://www.hamptons.com/The-Arts/On-The-Screen/17565/Woody-Allen-Was-Back-In-The-Hamptons.html#.UFoFBKRSQrw">a trip to the Hamptons</a>) since last week. But today, we finally get a glimpse of his latest muse: mysterious ingenue Andrew Dice Clay.</p>

<p>The Diceman has been having himself something of a comeback in the last few years, starting when he played a not-so-thinly veiled version of himself on <em>Entourage</em>. But this time he&apos;s really focused on his acting chops: &#x201C;I&#x2019;ll put it this way: I&#x2019;ve never been challenged like this as an actor,&#x201D; Dice <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501174829/http://www.suntimes.com/entertainment/14560701-421/andrew-dice-clay-emerges-from-slump-with-entourage-woody-allen-gigs.html">told The Chicago Sun-Times</a>. &#x201C;So it&#x2019;s great to do what I always knew I could do.&#x201D; </p>

<p>Allen&apos;s new untitled film, which was partially shot in San Francisco, also stars Alec Baldwin, Sally Hawkins (see both above), Cate Blanchett, Michael Emerson, Bobby Cannavale, Peter Sarsgaard, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501174829/http://gothamist.com/tags/louisck">Louis C.K.</a> Allen won&apos;t be acting in this one, but the 76-year-old <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501174829/http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/life_and_entertainment/2012/09/18/woody-allen-to-play-pimp-in-turturro-film.html">will be playing a pimp</a> in John Turturro&apos;s film <em>Fading Gigolo</em> (his lovely harlots will include Vanessa Paradis, Sharon Stone and Sofia Vergara). </p>
