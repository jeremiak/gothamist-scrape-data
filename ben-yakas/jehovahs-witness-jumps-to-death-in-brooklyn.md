<p>A ledge above the the building&#x2019;s entrance broke Fagan&#x2019;s fall before he hit the ground. &#x201C;I saw him land&#x2014;it was so loud,&#x201D; she added. &#x201C;All his limbs were broken. He was lifeless.&#x201D; Police say Fagan, who was said to be a devout Jehovah&apos;s Witness, had warned a family member he was planning to hurt himself in a series of texts messages before his death.
