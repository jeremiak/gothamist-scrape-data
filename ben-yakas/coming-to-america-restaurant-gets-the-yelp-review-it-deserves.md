<p><em>Coming To America</em>, Eddie Murphy&apos;s first foray into playing multiple characters on film, is one of our favorite movies of all time. When we heard about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161023185047/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/12/coming_to_america_a_taxi_chief_is_a.php">a real life taxi fleet owner who happens to be an African Chief</a>, we were screaming &quot;Good morning, my neighbors!&quot; to everyone we came across for a week. So you can imagine our glee when <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161023185047/http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2011/12/yelp-mcdowells-coming-to-america.html">Vulture pointed us</a> to a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161023185047/http://www.yelp.com/biz/mcdowells-elmhurst">Yelp review of McDowell&apos;s</a>: &quot;Yeah, that place is a dump. Stopped going there &apos;cause some mutherfucker that looked like Samuel Jackson kept on robbing the place. WTF?&quot;</p>

<p>In case you aren&apos;t familiar with the fantastic film, McDowell&apos;s is the Queens restaurant (actually a Wendy&apos;s on Queens Blvd. that was scheduled to be closed for a complete renovation) Murphy&apos;s character Prince Akeem goes to work for when he&apos;s pretending to be a poor foreign student. McDowell&apos;s was restaurateur Cleo McDowell&apos;s blatant attempt to copy McDonald&apos;s: the &quot;Big Mac&quot; is the &quot;Big Mick&quot; (&quot;both contain two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles and onions. But they use a sesame seed bun. My buns have no seeds.&quot;), and as McDowell explains, &quot;They [have] got the Golden Arches, mine [is] the Golden Arcs.&quot; In real life, the film&apos;s producers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161023185047/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094898/trivia">had to obtain</a> legal permission from McDonald&apos;s in advance to use the name.</p>

<p>The Yelp reviews are hilarious and obsessively specific, with comments such as: &quot;Some weird guy kept trying to talk to me about the Giants v. Packers game, but apart from that, I guess it was okay.  The floors were spotless and the windows were incredibly clean too.&quot; Go ahead and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161023185047/http://www.yelp.com/biz/mcdowells-elmhurst">read the whole thing here</a>, and you can look at all the user-submitted photos as well <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161023185047/http://www.buzzfeed.com/sly/yelp-reviews-for-mcdowells-restaurant">here.</a></p>
