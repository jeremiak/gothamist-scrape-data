<p>Fox News columnist Suzanne Venker, who previously <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160802233653/http://gothamist.com/2012/11/25/fox_news_trolls_america_with_announ.php">amused us to no end</a> with her &quot;War On Men&quot; column (that she has since turned into what is undoubtedly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160802233653/http://www.amazon.com/The-War-on-Men-ebook/dp/B00B5I6PXC/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1359993283&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=The+War+on+Men">a hilarious ebook</a>), got down and dirty this week <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160802233653/http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2013/02/05/to-be-happy-must-admit-women-and-men-arent-equal/">with a column all about</a> the importance of heteronormative, straight marriage and women&apos;s roles in them. There was one major error (besides the fact the article is all about women embracing not being equal because they have <em>the choice</em> to be lesser than their husbands)&#x2014;they used a photo of two lesbians kissing atop the Empire State Building to illustrate their point about men and women&apos;s relationships.</p>

<p>Stephanie Figarelle and Lela McArthur became the first same-sex couple to tie the knot at the Empire State Building almost exactly a year ago, at 8 a.m. on Valentine&apos;s Day 2012. You can see <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160802233653/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/14/same-sex_couple_weds_atop_empire_st.php#photo-1">our original post on the wedding here</a>, and a video of them saying &quot;I Do&quot; below.</p>

<p>It&apos;s entirely possible that Venker had nothing whatsoever to do with choosing this photo to completely undermine her argument about heteronormative roles and marriage and how girls like dolls and boys like kicking stuff and whatever. But either someone is trying to undermine Fox News from the inside on behalf of Jon Stewart, or the good folks over there really ought to do their homework when choosing images.</p>

<p>The photo has since been changed on the website to a much more benign picture of a man and woman you might find on the outside of a public bathroom. As for the rest of Venker&apos;s article&#x2014;in which she argues &quot;Being equal in worth, or value, is not the same as being identical, interchangeable beings&quot;&#x2014;actually, let&apos;s not. Let&apos;s just not.</p>
