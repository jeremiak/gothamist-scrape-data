<p>Filmmaker <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509151741/https://twitter.com/Timcode">Tim Bartlett</a> has teamed up with George Del Barrio of the Vanderbilt Republic and Karl Mehrer of K2imaging to virtually illuminate the sign for the first time since 1992 via a high-powered projector and 3D technology. The show, which will last about thirty minutes, will consist of &quot;a looping series of site-specific videos/animatics will be presented from sunset onwards.&quot; It&apos;s scheduled to start &quot;after dark&quot; (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509151741/http://www.bkmag.com/2014/04/11/gowanus-kentile-floors-sign-will-be-lit-for-one-night-next-month/?utm_source=facebook&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=gowanus_bk">BK Magazine points</a> out sunset is scheduled for 7:54 p.m.) and will contain writings by Ralph Ellison, Milan Kundera, Gabriel Garc&#xED;a M&#xE1;rquez &amp; Henry David Thoreau.</p>

<p>&quot;We&#x2019;re using the Kentile Floors sign as the projection screen,&quot; Bartlett <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509151741/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/iconic-kentile-floors-sign-gowanus-illuminate-night-article-1.1752524">told the Daily News</a>, explaining that the projector will be propped a block away through an office window of K2imaging. &quot;Taking something as landmark status as this, and giving it new life, puts forward an incredible commentary on what is actually possible,&quot; added Del Barrio.
