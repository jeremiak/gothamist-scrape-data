Everyone&apos;s favorite grumpy rocker <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140205202150/http://gothamist.com/tags/loureed">Lou Reed</a> turns 71 years young today! Reed has had a long and storied career, starting out as an in-house songwriter for Pickwick Records before forming (arguably) the greatest NYC band, the Velvet Underground, in the mid-60s. We particularly love it when Reed is posing for ridiculous photos with the likes of Moby, Bono and his dog&#x2014;above, you can see 21 such examples of that. </p>

<p>We love Reed as much when he was skronking on &quot;Sister Ray&quot; as when he was embracing noise on <em>Metal Machine Music</em>; we love Reed as much when he was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140205202150/http://thequietus.com/articles/11477-lou-reed-marc-riley-berlin">terrifying reporters</a> as when he was reading <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140205202150/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/24/video_lou_reed.php">NSFW porn descriptions.</a></p>

<p>We love <em>Rock And Roll Animal</em>, which we listened to in high school on long drives to the beach. We love the intricate guitar work on <em>The Blue Mask</em>. We love his most underrated album, the romantic <em>Coney Island Baby</em>, which has long been our favorite album to wash the dishes to. </p>

<p>We love his epics like &quot;Street Hassle&quot; and lesser-known modern classics like <em>Ecstasy</em>. We love the absolutely devastating <em>Magic and Loss</em> record, which gave us one of our favorite quotes of all time: <strong>&quot;There&apos;s a bit of magic in everything/ and then some loss to even things out.&quot;</strong></p>

<p>Besides his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140205202150/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/02/lou_reed_receiving_death_threats_fr.php">collaboration with Metallica</a>, we really have a place in our hearts for almost everything Reed has produced throughout his long, sometimes uncomfortable, always uncompromising career&#x2014;who else could write an album called <em>New York </em> in the dreaded &apos;80s and come out with one of his masterpieces, as pure a distillation of the city as &quot;Take The &apos;A&apos; Train&quot; or &quot;New York Groove&quot;?</p>

<p>Oh yeah, it&apos;s also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140205202150/http://gothamist.com/tags/bonjovi">Jon Bon Jovi&apos;s</a> birthday today, but, um...yeah!</p>
