<p>With the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130225020523/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/06/puck-er_up_the_nhl_lockout_is_over.php">NHL lockout finally over</a> and the season right around the corner (seriously: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130225020523/http://espn.go.com/nhl/schedule">this Saturday!</a>), it&apos;s especially appropriate that Google decided to honor one of the hallmarks of the rink today: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130225020523/https://www.google.com/">the Zamboni</a>. Well, really they&apos;re celebrating the 112th birthday of Frank Zamboni, who lent his name to the titular machine which has been cleaning up ice rink messes since 1949.</p>

<p>Just try playing this game for a few minutes without becoming enraged at those stupid skaters, always messing up the ice with their stupid blades. You may find your never-ending push-and-pull with them forces you to take a long hard look at your own monotonous life. Or you may find yourself desperately wanting to play a version of hockey that includes bananas and gas cans!</p>

<p>Oh sure, it&apos;s no <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130225020523/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/12/google_unveils_festivus_easter_egg.php">Festivus pole</a>, but it&apos;s a damn good way to distract yourself for a few minutes on this dreary winter day. Check out more Google Doodle archives here; and if you&apos;re looking for more ways to distract yourself at work, we highly recommend <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130225020523/http://www.planarity.net/game.php">this addictive, frustrating game.</a></p>
