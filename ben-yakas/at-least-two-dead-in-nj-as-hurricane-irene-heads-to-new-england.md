<p>Officials say that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130816033443/http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2011/08/nj_storm_update_one_woman_foun.html">at least two people have been found dead</a> in New Jersey in the aftermath of Hurricane Irene. A woman in Salem County was the first reported casualty in NJ of the storm earlier this morning, and a man was also found dead in Kearny. Gov. Chris Christie spoke about the woman, and urged residents to not underestimate the flooding and stay inside today: <strong>&#x201C;She left her house, went in her car and was swept away,&quot;</strong> he said.</p>

<p>The Salem County woman had called 911 after her car had been washed away by a flash flood. The woman, who has not been publicly identified yet, was found dead in her car around 9:30 a.m. According to Jack Burns, director of Hudson County&apos;s Office of Emergency Management, a man was found dead shortly after 10 p.m. in Kearny, but no other details have been released about that yet.</p>

<p>David Robinson, the state climatologist, said Hurricane Irene will rank among the largest single rain events in New Jersey history: &#x201C;I can say unequivocally that this is the wettest month on record in New Jersey. We&#x2019;re going to shatter the previous record,&#x201C; he said.</p>
