<p>A few months back, we were given a glimpse of a future never-to-be when renderings of a sleek glass residential linked tower in Hell&apos;s Kitchen <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160115070737/http://gothamist.com/2014/05/16/11th_ave_towers.php#photo-1">were released.</a> That design ultimately wasn&apos;t chosen&#x2014;but now we have renderings of the skyscraper that will be going up in its stead. And it will be the biggest residential building in NYC.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160115070737/http://newyorkyimby.com/2014/07/revealed-520-west-41st-street.html">As New York Yimby points out</a>, the skyscraper at 520 West 41st Street will be 1,100 feet tall and have an estimated 106 floors. It will have a new retail space totaling 300,000 square feet at the bottom, along with 175,000 square feet for corporate apartments, and 1.14 million square feet of residential space split between 1,400 apartments.</p>

<p>But the most notable and important development about the building: it will have &quot;more units than the combined total of <em>every other residential supertall</em> either proposed or under construction in NYC.&quot; And with about 280 affordable apartments, it&apos;s a sign that these supertall skyscrapers won&apos;t just be for the superrich (although whether or not <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160115070737/http://gothamist.com/2014/05/18/lawmakers_seeking_to_ban_poor_doors.php">they have &quot;poor doors&quot;</a> is yet to be seen). </p>

<p>Construction on the building is tentatively slated for 2017, and completion is expected by 2020. You can peruse the full Draft Scope Work report by firm Phillip Habib &amp; Associates below.</p>
