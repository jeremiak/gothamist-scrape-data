<p><strong>Update</strong>: President Obama addressed the apparent terror attacks in the NYC/NJ region this morning in his remarks: &quot;To everybody in this region, I want to repeat what we&#x2019;ve said before: if you see something suspicious, then you need to say something,&quot; he said. &quot;In the meantime, I would like to ask that the press refrain from trying to get ahead of the investigation&#x2026;. [Law enforcement is] moving swiftly on this investigation. It does not help if false information [is being spread].&quot;</p>

<p>Obama noted that there is no connection between these two attacks and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021061418/http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/19/us/minnesota-mall-stabbing/">Minnesota mall stabbing</a> which also occurred over the weekend, leaving nine people injured. He also reassured New Yorkers that with the UN meetings this week, &quot;we have an additional amount of federal support here as needed.&quot; </p>

<p>And he concluded his speech by toasting to the bounce back spirit of New Yorkers:</p>

<blockquote>It&#x2019;s important to remember what terrorists and violent extremists are trying to do: they are trying to hurt innocent people, but they&apos;re also trying to instill fear in all of us, and disrupt the way we live to undermine our values. So even as we have to be vigilant and aggressive in preventing senseless acts of violence and making sure that we find those that carry out such acts and bring them to justice, we all have a responsibility as citizens to make sure that we don&#x2019;t succumb to that fear. And there&apos;s no better example of that than the people of NY and NJ.</blockquote>

<p>After speaking to local officials including Gov. Andrew Cuomo, Mayor Bill de Blasio and Gov. Chris Christie, Obama said one point they all made was that, &quot;folks around here, they don&#x2019;t get scared. They&#x2019;re tough, they&#x2019;re resilient, and they go about their business every single day. That kind of toughness and resoluteness and recognition that neither individuals nor organizations like ISIS can ultimately undermine our way of life&#x2014;that&#x2019;s the kind of strength that makes me proud to be an American.&quot;</p>

<p>In that spirit:</p>
