                            <p>Whether you were a classic rock aficionado, a terrified Nirvana fan, or part of the cast of <em>The Sopranos</em>, you were probably up very late last night watching the all-star benefit <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131215085305/http://gothamist.com/2012/11/15/bruce_springsteen_paul_mccartney_ka.php">12-12-12: The Concert For Sandy Relief</a> at MSG. It was by turns defiant, musically enthralling, and head-scratching, filled with aging rockers, surprise team-ups, and awkward Adam Sandler bits. Below, check out video highlights from the five hour-plus show, as well as a list of the best and most bizarre moments from the evening. </p>

<p>So, besides <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131215085305/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/13/video_paul_mccartney_and_nirvana_pr.php">the anticipated Paul McCartney/Nirvana team-up</a>, there was QUITE a lot to unpack from the concert. Below, we&apos;ve listed our 10 favorite/most bizarre things about the show:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Roger Daltrey&apos;s ageless bronze chest, crafted in the fires of Mordor.</li>
	<li>Kanye West&apos;s leather skirt.</li>
	<li>The fact that the brightest star of the night wasn&apos;t McCartney, the Stones or even Bruce Springsteen&#x2014;it was Billy Joel! All anyone could talk about on Twitter was how much they want him to tour next year. </li>
	<li>Steve Buscemi getting bear hugged by (probably drunk) first responders.</li>
	<li>Pete Townsend encouraging that, telling everyone to &quot;drink a fucking beer.&quot;</li>
	<li>Michael Stipe joining Chris Martin for an acoustic &quot;Losing My Religion.&quot;</li>
	<li>Brian Williams killing it in between segments (and occasionally rambling about swinging dead cats).</li>
	<li>The ubiquity of skinny jeans on 60+ year-old dudes. And Stephen Colbert commenting on not being able to get things done in them.</li>
	<li>Macca not burning down MSG despite the &quot;Live and Let Die&quot; fireworks extravaganza.</li>
	<li>Alicia Keys closing the show with &quot;Empire State Of Mind&quot; while Macca took photos with first responders on stage.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now for the rest: Mick Jagger really nailed it during the Stones set: <strong>&#x201C;This has got to be the largest collection of old English musicians ever assembled in Madison Square Garden.</strong>&#x201D; NJ native Jon Stewart brought a slightly more serious tone to the show: &quot;When are you going to learn,&quot; he said. &quot;You can throw anything at us &#x2014; terrorists, hurricanes. You can take away our giant sodas. It doesn&apos;t matter. We&apos;re coming back stronger every time.&quot; </p>

<p>Bruce Springsteen started things off on a ridiculously high note with a four song-set including &quot;Land of Hopes and Dreams,&quot; &quot;Wrecking Ball&quot; (whose location changed from Giants Stadium to Jersey Shore), &quot;My City of Ruins&quot; (which included snippets of Tom Waits classic &quot;Jersey Girl&quot;) and &quot;Born to Run&quot; (with Jersey brother-in-arms Jon Bon Jovi). &quot;I pray that that characteristic remains along the Jersey Shore because that&apos;s what makes it special,&quot; Springsteen said, referring to the Shore&apos;s inclusiveness in the face of hardship.</p>

<p>Roger Waters treated fans to tons of songs from <em>The Wall</em>, a couple of <em>Dark Side</em> classics (&quot;Us and Them,&quot; &quot;Money&quot;), and ended things by bringing Eddie Vedder out for &quot;Comfortably Numb.&quot; You can watch that last one below: </p>

<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20131215085305if_/http://www.youtube.com/embed/_4c_8rTuddU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>For some reason, Adam Sandler (wearing a NY Jets shirt&#x2014;the guy really doesn&apos;t wear anything but t-shirts, does he?) did a parody of Leonard Cohen&apos;s eternal &quot;Hallelujah&quot; called &quot;Sandy Screw Ya!&quot; In case you thought it was hilarious, and want to re-watch it, go ahead below: </p>

<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20131215085305if_/http://www.youtube.com/embed/yr5AxRP5gac" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>Bon Jovi came back next for some of their biggest hits (&quot;It&apos;s My Life,&quot; &quot;Wanted Dead or Alive,&quot; &quot;Livin&#x2019; on a Prayer&quot;). He also brought Springsteen back out to join him on the cheery &quot;Who Says You Can&apos;t Go Home.&quot; Eric Clapton did a short three-song set, highlighted by an acoustic &quot;Nobody Loves You When You&apos;re Down And Out.&quot; </p>

<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20131215085305if_/http://www.youtube.com/embed/qoHqD93YO08" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>Then came the shortest, and possibly best, set of the evening: The Rolling Stones only played &quot;You Got Me Rocking&quot; (for the first time since 2007) and the hurricane appropriate &quot;Jumpin&apos; Jack Flash,&quot; but both were lively and in-line with the tone of the evening. There wasn&apos;t too much finger pointing, but Jagger&apos;s leathery face still loves the camera. That was followed by an equally-short Alicia Keys solo piano set&#x2014;&quot;No One&quot; was pretty good, even if her entreaties for people to put their cell phones in the air was kinda horrible.</p>

<p>The Who seemed to have the longest set of the night, with the highlights being &quot;Who Are You,&quot; Townsend screaming about &quot;Sandy wasteland&quot; on &quot;Baba O&apos;Reilly,&quot; and a cameo from Keith Moon (via archival footage) on &quot;Bell Boy.&quot; Oh, but Daltrey&apos;s chest defiantly stole the set, slowly slipping out of its cloth tomb to shine on the audience like a lighthouse beacon. </p>

<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20131215085305if_/http://www.youtube.com/embed/kQbsbCLnJUE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>We thought Daltrey&apos;s chest would be the peak of the evening&apos;s sartorial weirdness, but Kanye West would never let that stand&#x2014;he came out in a leather skirt that quickly inspired some parody accounts. It definitely wasn&apos;t his best performance, but he got more comfortable as the set went on, climaxing with good versions of &quot;Runaway&quot; and &quot;Stronger.&quot;  </p>

<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20131215085305if_/http://www.youtube.com/embed/sVkDp0fbqkw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>After a pretty terrible visit from SNL&apos;s Drunk Uncle (played by Bobby Moyniham, who put his best forward despite it just not working) and a terrifying look into Jake Gyllenhaal&apos;s beard&apos;s soul, Billy Joel killed it with a perfect six-song set. He incorporated a bit of &quot;Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas,&quot; he played a Sandy-appropriate re-written version of &quot;Miami 2017,&quot; he put &#x201C;Breezy Point&#x201D; into the lyrics of &#x201C;New York State of Mind,&quot; and he got the crowd dancing and singing along. &#x201C;We&#x2019;re going to get through all this,&#x201D; he said. <strong>&#x201C;This is New York and New Jersey and Long Island and we&#x2019;re just too mean to lay down and die.&#x201D;</strong></p>

<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20131215085305if_/http://www.youtube.com/embed/CtDirzZAQv4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>Chris Martin came out for a short three-song acoustic set, whose highlight by far was Stipe coming out for &quot;Losing My Religion&quot;&#x2014;at times, it seemed as though Stipe was lost in Martin&apos;s eyes, thoroughly enjoying watching him sing harmonies. Then Macca came out for the evening&apos;s last eight-song set. It was a really odd setlist, filled with lesser-known Wings classics (an excellent &quot;Nineteen Hundred and Eighty-Five,&quot; &quot;Let Me Roll It&quot;), some more rocking Beatles songs (an awesome &quot;Helter Skelter,&quot; an eh &quot;I&apos;ve Got A Feeling&quot;), two ballads (recent tune &quot;My Valentine&quot; with Diana Krall, and an always welcome &quot;Blackbird&quot;), and the aforementioned grungy team-up with Nirvana. </p>

<p>The night came to a close sometime after 1:30 a.m., more than an hour and a half after it was supposed to end. Keys came back for &quot;Empire State of Mind Part II&#x201D; while the stage filled with first responders and McCartney posed for photos. Overall, despite some out-of-tune singers and awkward comedians, we&apos;d call it a very successful night&#x2014;even if the two most haunting images weren&apos;t any of the mini-videos about Sandy&apos;s affect on our area, but rather Daltrey&apos;s chest and Kanye&apos;s skirt.</p>
