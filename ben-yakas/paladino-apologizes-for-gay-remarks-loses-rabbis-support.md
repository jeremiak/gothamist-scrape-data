<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="101310paladino.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811073346im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/101310paladino.jpg" width="250" height="178" class="image-left"> </span>Like a real-life Michael Scott, Carl Paladino must be getting used to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811073346/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/14/paladino_disturbs_paterson_apologiz.php">apologizing</a> for his continual gaffes and goofs: Paladino took the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811073346/http://gothamist.com/2010/10/12/giuliani_calls_paladinos_gay_remark.php">advice of the Mayor of 9/11 Town</a> and formally apologized for the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811073346/http://gothamist.com/2010/10/10/paladino_homosexuality_not_an_equal.php">comments on homosexuality</a> he made to orthodox Jewish leaders over the weekend. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811073346/http://www.ny1.com/content/top_stories/127017/paladino-offers-up-apology-for-gay-remarks">He wrote</a>, &quot;<strong>I sincerely apologize for any comment that may have offended the Gay and Lesbian Community or their family members.</strong> Any reference to branding an entire community based on a small representation of them is wrong.&quot;</p>

<p>Even so, he focused on his &quot;poorly chosen words&quot; rather than disavow the substance of his speech, which was anti-gay marriage. He still maintains that he dislikes gay pride parades and doesn&apos;t believe homosexuality should be discussed in schools. But he made it clear that he was a supporter of gay rights, and he was worried about the ramifications of his remarks. &quot;My entire life, I have never equivocated at all on defending gay rights...Ugly. Horrible. My God. I didn&apos;t want any questions on this topic, because I don&apos;t want this feeding frenzy of nonsense going on in the press to hurt anybody,&quot; he said while <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811073346/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/13/nyregion/13paladino.html?_r=2&amp;partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">campaign stumping</a>. </p>

<p>His campaign manager, Michael Caputo, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811073346/http://www.nydailynews.com/blogs/dailypolitics/2010/10/carl-paladino-im-100-in-favor.html">took the blame</a> for helping craft the more incendiary language of the speech with Orthodox leaders: &quot;I bear a lot of responsibility for that. Carl has a lot of family and friends who were surprised by what came of Carl&apos;s mouth that day.<strong> I am responsible for the message of the campaign</strong>.&quot; None of the apologies impressed City Council speaker Christine Quinn: &#x201C;This is not a question of choosing poor words or a misinterpretation of his remarks. <strong>His beliefs are wrong and filled with hate</strong>.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Amazingly, Paladino doesn&apos;t seem able to please anybody right now. Rabbi Yehuda Levin, the Orthodox Rabbi who has been campaigning for Paladino as his liaison to the Jewish community and who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811073346/http://gothamist.com/2010/10/11/paladino_denies_dyfunctional_homose.php">claims to have written</a> Paladino&apos;s anti-gay speech, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811073346/http://firstread.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2010/10/13/5284978-paladino-loses-orthodox-rabbis-endorsement">revoked his support</a> for the candidate today, saying he had caved to political pressure by apologizing. </p>

<p>Even Paladino&apos;s Republican cohorts (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811073346/http://gothamist.com/2010/10/12/coulter_says_paladinos_gay_gaffe_is.php">Ann Coulter withstanding</a>) are at their wit&apos;s end because of the endless cycle of unnecessary shenanigans; one Republican consultant working on several down-ballot races <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811073346/http://www.observer.com/2010/politics/island-paladino-republicans-its-every-man-himself-democrats-unite">told the Observer</a> about the larger effect he&apos;s having on the party: &quot;He&apos;s killing everybody. The worst thing that he&apos;s doing is changing the subject. <strong>The subject that Republicans are winning on across the country this year is overtaxing, overspending and debt. Every poll in America is saying that. And now we&apos;re walking around talking about Speedo bathing suits</strong>.&quot;</p>
