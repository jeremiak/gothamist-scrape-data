<p>Two Brooklyn children are in serious condition after a fire broke out in their Brownsville apartment this morning. According to the FDNY, the fire started around 3 a.m. Saturday. Firefighters pulled out 3-year-old Dasani Rich and 4-year-old Rolando Rich from the apartment in the Van Dyke housing complex. &quot;When the firemen came they had to go through the window because the walls were melting and the hallway was blocked. There was fire everywhere,&quot; the toddlers&apos; 15-year-old brother, Darnell Smith, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130818053842/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/brooklyn-tots-serious-condition-fire-brownsville-apartment-article-1.1391627">told the News</a>. &quot;When my mom got back she was upset and panicking.&quot;</p>

<p>Smith tried to get his youngest siblings, who were both sleeping in the room next to their mother&apos;s, but a wall in the hallway collapsed and blocked him from reaching it. He was able to get his 11-year-old brother Kamari Daniels and flee the the apartment though. He believes the fire started in the children&#x2019;s mother Tarnesha Rich&apos;s bedroom, though it&apos;s unknown what started the fire. Rich, who had been out of the apartment at the time when the fire started, arrived home to see flames through the window from the street.</p>

<p>The toddlers were in bad shape when they were taken out of the apartment: &quot;They were both unconscious. They laid them both right on the ground outside the building and tried to resuscitate them,&quot; said neighbor Bryan Illas. Both were taken to Brookdale Hospital. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130818053842/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2013/07/06/woman-2-young-children-injured-in-brooklyn-fire/">Family members added</a> that Rolando, who also has leukemia, is in a more critical condition than his sister.</p>
