<p>Actor Jeffrey Wright was arrested for drunk driving in lower Manhattan early Saturday morning. Sources <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130601080713/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/hunger-games-actor-jeffrey-wright-charged-driving-drunk-article-1.1329252">told the News</a> that Wright was stopped by cops at Hester and Chrystie Streets driving erratically around 3 a.m. &#x201C;He was speeding and nearly caused an accident,&#x201D; the source said.</p>

<p>Cops reportedly smelled alcohol on Wright&apos;s breath when they pulled him over; he failed a subsequent field sobriety test and was taken into custody. He has since been charged with a DWI. Wright had attended the Tribeca Film Festival 2013 after party for his new film <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130601080713/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1540741/"><em>A Single Shot</em></a> earlier in the evening. </p>
