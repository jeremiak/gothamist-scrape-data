<p>A Bronx mother and her boyfriend <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130506052433/http://www.ny1.com/content/top_stories/181317/mother--boyfriend-face-charges-in-connection-with-3-year-old-girl-s-death">have been charged with assault</a> in connection with the death of their three-year-old. Ahyna Louis-Hardy was found unconscious at their home on Manhattan College Parkway in Van Cortlandt Village on Monday. Leon Walters, 25, was with the girl at the time; he told police that the little girl fell down the stairs, and passed out around 6 p.m. that evening. The little girl, who had bruises on her back and thighs, was pronounced dead at the hospital a short time later.</p>

<p>Walters and mother Sherika Stewart, 22, later told cops and prosecutors that they hit the girl because she refused to do her lessons, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130506052433/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Bronx-Baby-Death-Medical-Examiner-Police-New-York-City-205359891.html">NBC reports.</a> Both have now been charged with assault, reckless endangerment and endangering the welfare of a child. Police add that more charges could be added once a cause of death is determined.</p>
