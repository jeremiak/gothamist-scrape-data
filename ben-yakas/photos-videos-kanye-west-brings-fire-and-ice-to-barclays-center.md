</div></div>					<p>&quot;As soon as they like you make &apos;em unlike you,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150302101416/http://gothamist.com/tags/kanyewest">Kanye West</a> sings in &quot;I Am A God,&quot; the third track on his spectacular, chiseled 2013 album <em>Yeezus.</em> &quot;&apos;Cause kissing people ass is so unlike you.&quot; West may have a lot of damn good reasons for not wanting to kiss people ass at this point, but that doesn&apos;t mean he doesn&apos;t want you to love him&#x2014;and it doesn&apos;t mean he doesn&apos;t want to entertain you. And West was nothing less than entertaining over the course of two hours and 28 songs at Barclays Center last night, bouncing around the stage like a mix between a praying mantis and one of those scarily-energetic self-help gurus. And it was by far the best show I&apos;ve seen at Barclays since the arena opened.</p>

<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="//web.archive.org/web/20150302101416if_/http://www.youtube.com/embed/9iv7Kw0N4d8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>This was the first of four NYC-area shows for Kanye this week (tonight he returns to Barclays, then he plays MSG Saturday and Sunday) on his <em>Yeezus</em> tour, which was briefly derailed earlier this month <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150302101416/http://www.spin.com/articles/kanye-west-yeezus-tour-cancelled-dates-truck-accident/">after a truck accident.</a> If you were one of those people skeptical about whether Kanye really needed a 60-feet-wide LED screen to perform, then rest assured he most <em>definitely</em> needed it: the show is thick with theatrics, broken up into shorter sets introduced by vaguely inspiring messages on the big screen and lots of vaguely-dramatic interplay between West and his nude body suit-wearing harem.</p>

<p><iframe src="//web.archive.org/web/20150302101416if_/http://instagram.com/p/g8JmnTlLOV/embed/" width="612" height="710" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowtransparency="true"></iframe></p>

<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="//web.archive.org/web/20150302101416if_/http://www.youtube.com/embed/Ba5bf4G6VGo?list=PL4yZlbVxRv92r-RT943V3msx-p7bNEM3j" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>The stage setup alone is weird and impressive and impressively weird: there&apos;s a giant ice mountain where the main stage would normally be, one that West sometimes climbs upon to deliver sermons (like a bare-chested version of &quot;Power&quot;). During &quot;Blood On The Leaves&quot; and &quot;All Of The Lights&quot;, there were spectacular fire displays that made the temperature tick up in the arena; the closest comparison I can give is Paul McCartney&apos;s fireworks extravaganza during &quot;Live And Let Die.&quot; </p>

<p>Then in the middle of the room is a giant iceberg, or maybe an ice penis, where Kanye spends most of the concert huffing, puffing, and occasionally lying down (&quot;Cold Winter&quot;). There are moments in the show (&quot;Mercy,&quot; &quot;Through The Wire,&quot; &quot;Good Life&quot;) when it is shaking so much it almost looks like there are two of them. </p>

<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="//web.archive.org/web/20150302101416if_/http://www.youtube.com/embed/2CBnxlE35RQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>There are also a lot of religious overtones in the spectacle: Kanye and his harem kneeled before &quot;White Jesus&quot; to be blessed before barreling into an Earth-shattering version of &quot;Jesus Walks.&quot; But it&apos;s always a mix of the divine and the profane with Kanye: through every wardrobe change (at one point he looks like a homeless beggar wearing a diamond-encrusted yeti mask), West refuses to allow his various pairs of pants to cover his butt even in the slightest. </p>

<p><iframe src="//web.archive.org/web/20150302101416if_/http://instagram.com/p/g8HBnHPXWA/embed/" width="612" height="710" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowtransparency="true"></iframe></p>

<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="//web.archive.org/web/20150302101416if_/http://www.youtube.com/embed/TiyerM9c7hw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>The music is ferocious and lean (the minimalist, hard beats of the <em>Yeezus</em> tunes work especially well live), keeping the focus on Kanye&#x2014;even with alcohol-symbolizing Sasquatch-ish creatures occasionally popping up (&quot;Hold My Liquor&quot;) or the aforementioned White Jesus, there are very few moments that West isn&apos;t the center of attention (or literally centered underneath a lone light on the ice penis stage). Even so, the audience mostly gets treated to the concept of West more than the man himself&#x2014;for the first 2/3 of the show, West wore <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150302101416/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/29/video_kanye_west_wears_bizarre_diam.php#photo-1">several of his various diamond masks.</a> &quot;Jesus Walks,&quot; the 23rd song in the set, is the first time we get a good, clear look at his face. For someone who is so concerned about being understood, it&apos;s an interesting decision.</p>

<p><iframe src="//web.archive.org/web/20150302101416if_/http://instagram.com/p/g8CkKlJc0C/embed/" width="612" height="710" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowtransparency="true"></iframe></p>

<p><iframe src="//web.archive.org/web/20150302101416if_/http://instagram.com/p/g8K9NzuUNN/embed/" width="612" height="710" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowtransparency="true"></iframe></p>

<p><iframe src="//web.archive.org/web/20150302101416if_/http://instagram.com/p/g775QBy8B2/embed/" width="612" height="710" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowtransparency="true"></iframe></p>

<p>And there&apos;s no doubt Kanye wants to be understood by his fans&#x2014;he may want to bite the hand that feeds him, but he <em>painfully</em> wants to communicate and connect with his audience. Which is how we end up at the now ritual &quot;Runaway&quot; rant section of the night: for 10+ minutes, Kanye preaches about being The Underdog, about various inventors (Nikola Tesla!) who were misunderstood, about corporation managers criticizing him (&quot;People who give me advice, I don&apos;t see them rocking to 15K motherfuckers in Brooklyn tonight!&quot;), and about being a misunderstood genius: &quot;Being a genius isn&apos;t a compliment to myself, it&apos;s a burden on myself,&quot; he noted sincerely. </p>

<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="//web.archive.org/web/20150302101416if_/http://www.youtube.com/embed/-WHjj4q5Z74" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>This is how we want him: complaining that nobody believes in him while also basking in the glory of knowing everyone there loves him. Talking about how much he hates being pigeon-holed, while over-sharing in exactly the way we expect. The rant is somehow both predictable and terribly thrilling, and you don&apos;t want to miss a word even though you basically know the script. We are enablers in a sense, but with a performance this great, it doesn&apos;t seem like such a bad thing. At the end of the day, Ye doesn&apos;t want anyone on Instagram to try to tell you who to be, and that&apos;s genuinely a sweet sentiment.</p>

<p>After a hit laden near-medley of some of his greatest songs (&quot;Jesus Walks!&quot; &quot;Diamonds From Sierra Leone!&quot; &quot;Flashing Lights!&quot; &quot;Through The Wire!&quot;) we get &quot;Bound 2&quot;, the last song of the night and the most gushing love song West has ever written. Kanye stops the theatrical stuff for a few minutes and smiles. He shakes hands with various audience members, and generally looks like he&apos;s having the time of his life. Everyone here likes him, and he knows it. </p>
