<p>Last summer, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130715000320/http://gothamist.com/tags/jets">Jets</a> were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130715000320/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/25/jets_training_camp_featured_on_hbo.php">featured</a> on the HBO show <em>Hard Knocks</em>, which followed the team for five weeks of training camp&#x2014;and between Rex Ryan&apos;s epic, profanity-laden pep speech in episode one, cornerback Antonio Cromartie&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130715000320/http://gothamist.com/2010/08/19/video_ny_jet_cromartie_lists_his_7.php">forgetfulness</a>, and all the other shenanigans, it was clear that this was the Jets&apos; coming out party. But unfortunately, HBO <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130715000320/http://www.nypost.com/p/entertainment/tv/no_knocks_for_jets_this_year_LFqT64xcZmMCE91ANIzBdJ">announced that</a> the Jets won&apos;t be on the show this summer...but left the possibility open for something in the future.</p>

<p>&quot;We will give [coach Rex Ryan] and the Jets the year off from &apos;Hard Knocks.&apos; But you never know what the future holds. It took many years before there was a &apos;Star Wars&apos; sequel. Hopefully someday Rex and the New York Jets will be back on HBO,&quot; said HBO Sports president Ross Greenburg. If you are jonesin&apos; for a dose of Jets on the small screen, you can catch Ryan <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130715000320/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/24/rex_ryan_jets_to_la_for_a_csiny_cam.php">on CSI: NY</a> soon. And of course, with an NFL lockout looking, and looking more and more likely, training camps could be cut short, and there may not even be a show this summer. At least we&apos;ve been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130715000320/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/25/rex_ryan_pulls_a_rex_ryan_guarantee.php">promised</a> a Super Bowl victory, whether or not there&apos;s a season.</p>

<p>Here&apos;s a snack-flavored taste of what we&apos;ll be missing out on this summer:</p>
