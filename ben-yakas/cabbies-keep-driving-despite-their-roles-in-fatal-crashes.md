<p>Despite the de Blasio administration&apos;s commitment to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422200937/http://www.billdeblasio.com/issues/street-safety">Vision Zero</a>, there&apos;s been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422200937/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/13/pedestrian_fatalities_2014.php">a surge of pedestrian fatalities</a> so far in 2014, including a 9-year-old boy <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422200937/http://gothamist.com/tags/cooperstock">who was fatally struck by a cab driver</a> on the Upper West Side in front of his father. Taxi driver Koffi Komlani was only <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422200937/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/12/taxi_driver_given_summons_for_fatal.php">given a $300 summons</a> for failure to yield to a pedestrian in that incident, and still has his license. It turns out that this pattern is routine. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422200937/http://nypost.com/2014/02/09/cabbies-who-kill-or-maim-in-nyc-keep-licenses-return-to-work/">The Post reports</a> that only two taxi drivers out of 16 involved in fatal or serious crashes since 2009 have had their licenses revoked. This includes Usman Gul, who fatally struck 5-year-old deaf child <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422200937/http://gothamist.com/tags/timothykeith">Timothy Keith</a> in Brooklyn in 2012. Gul said he wasn&apos;t able to break in time to stop his cab when Keith ran into the street, telling the Post he didn&apos;t feel guilty: &quot;Actually, no, I&#x2019;m not too much sad. Actually, I&#x2019;m not this fault happen [sic],&quot; he said.</p>

<p>There&apos;s Syed Nazir, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422200937/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/06/cab_passenger_next_thing_i_knew_i_w.php">who allegedly hit an SUV</a> and ended up in The Bean coffee shop at First Avenue and Third Street in September 2010. His car struck several people, including a 71-year-old whose leg was snapped. And last summer, cabbie Faysal Himon <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422200937/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/22/cabbie_who_maimed_tourist_blames_cy.php">careened up onto a Midtown sidewalk</a> and severed the foot of British tourist Sian Green.</p>

<p>Himon later blamed the incident on a cyclist: &quot;When I crashed, I didn&#x2019;t even see the lady. At first, I didn&#x2019;t think I hit anyone, then I saw her foot by my car. I can&#x2019;t get it out of my mind... I personally feel that if that man on the bike didn&#x2019;t bang on my car, maybe this would not have happened.&quot; Himon still has a current taxi license.</p>

<p>&quot;This culture of acceptance that traffic fatalities and serious injuries are the normal course of urban living, like the weather, is no longer acceptable,&quot; Gene Russianoff, an attorney for the Straphangers Campaign who is advocating for mandatory post-accident suspensions, told the Post. &quot;It is not acceptable to have people who have killed pedestrians or grievously harmed them to maintain their license.&quot;</p>

<p>You may not lose your license if you slice off someone&apos;s foot or fatally strike them, but you will lose it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422200937/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/17/cabbies_license_revoked_after_sexua.php">if you sexually harass a female passenger.</a></p>
