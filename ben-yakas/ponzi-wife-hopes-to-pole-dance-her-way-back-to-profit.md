<p>Things haven&apos;t been so easy for former Scores stripper <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160316022956/http://gothamist.com/tags/dianepassage">Diane Passage</a> in recent months, ever since her husband, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160316022956/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/28/alleged_ponzi_scammer_has_celeb_cli.php">accountant to the stars</a> Kenneth Starr, pleaded <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160316022956/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/10/celeb_ponzi_schemer_kenneth_starr_p.php">guilty</a> to running a Ponzi scheme. Starr is facing 12 years in jail, his companies are in bankruptcy, and their joint bank accounts have been frozen&#x2014;so what&apos;s a third wife to do to make a little money? </p>

<p>Passage <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160316022956/http://www.nypost.com/p/pagesix/passage_back_to_strip_pole_LToYgNiSAmbgjgX8dnBpTI#ixzz1EnN9kSqd">reportedly auditioned</a> for a new, untitled reality TV show which will show what life is like for pole dancers; if Passage gets a spot, she&apos;ll be filmed as she starts working at Scores again. There won&apos;t be any nudity, but there will be footage of the girls &quot;going about their daily lives.&quot; We&apos;re just surprised no effervescent reality show producer has pitched a show about the young wives of convicted white collar criminals (&quot;The Real Housewives of Butner Prison&quot;).</p>

<p>On the plus side, at least we have some indication that everything is copacetic between Starr and his (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160316022956/http://www.defamer.com.au/2010/08/how-a-ponzi-schemers-pole-dancing-wife-sold-him-out-to-the-feds/">specially selected</a>) wife: Passage received flowers from Starr from prison on Valentine&apos;s Day, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160316022956/http://twitter.com/DianePSS/status/37331270962778112">tweeted</a>, &quot;More roses from Ken just arrived!! <strong>Even from behind bars he continues to make other husbands look like a$$holes... Lol!</strong>&quot;</p>
