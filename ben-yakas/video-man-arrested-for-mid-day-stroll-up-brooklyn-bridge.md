<p>A 24-year-old man was arrested after he took a leisurely mid-day stroll to the top of the Brooklyn Bridge. Cops say that midtown Manhattan resident Yaroslav Kolchin was spotted climbing a support beam connected to the tower on the Brooklyn side of the Brooklyn Bridge around 12:15 p.m. Sunday. You can see video of it below.</p>

<p>Cops watched as Kolchin walked back and forth on the landing at the top of the tower where he took photos with his iPhone. There was no damage to the bridge, nor was anything taken; Kolchin was arrested upon coming down. He has been charged with reckless endangerment, criminal trespass, obstructing governmental administration, and disorderly conduct. </p>

<p>This incident comes a week after a pair of German artists came forward <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501172650/http://gothamist.com/2014/08/12/german_brooklyn_bridge_flag.php">to take credit for placing</a> a series of white flags on the Bridge back in July. Police have given no indication why Kolchin decided to climb in the bridge in the middle of a sunny weekend day when the Bridge was packed with people and officers, but hey, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501172650/http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2014/08/outlaw-instragrammers-of-new-york-city.html">it&apos;s a whole <em>thing</em> now.</a></p>
