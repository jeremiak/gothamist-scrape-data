<p>It&apos;s been more than four months since Dan Savage started his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406152408/http://www.itgetsbetter.org/">&quot;It Gets Better&quot;</a> video project, in response to the bullying and suicide of several gay teens, including Rutgers student <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406152408/http://gothamist.com/tags/tylerclementi">Tyler Clementi</a>. And now, Mayor Bloomberg has made his own IGB video (which you can see below). Many have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406152408/http://feministing.com/2011/01/05/nyc-mayor-bloomberg-makes-it-gets-better-video-two-days-after-slashing-funding-for-homeless-lgbt-youth/">criticized</a> Bloomberg for slashing funds for homeless LGBT youths, but the City Council <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406152408/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/06/bronx_residents_also_angry_about_ho.php">announced today</a> that they have figured out a way to restore $35 million to the street outreach program.</p>

<p>In NJ, Gov. Chris Christie <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406152408/http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2011/01/gov_christie_signs_anti-bullyi.html">signed</a> the &#x201C;Anti-Bullying Bill of Rights&#x201D; today, which advocates say gives the state the toughest anti-bullying law in the nation. The bill will require training for most public school teachers, administrators and other employees on bullying, as well as eliminate loopholes in the state&#x2019;s first anti-bullying law. There was also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406152408/http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2011/01/rutgers_to_host_conference_on.html">a conference</a> held at Rutgers today focusing on suicide prevention among young gay adults; the location was chosen because of Clementi&apos;s death and the national attention it brought.</p>
