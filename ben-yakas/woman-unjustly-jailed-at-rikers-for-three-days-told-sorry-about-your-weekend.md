<p>A woman who claims she was unjustly jailed at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131006173420/http://gothamist.com/tags/rikersisland">Rikers Island</a> over Memorial Day weekend because of an outdated warrant has filed a $3 million wrongful arrest lawsuit. After her ordeal, &quot;a court officer apologized to me, saying, &apos;Sorry about your weekend,&apos;&quot; Bronx resident Raven Moses <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131006173420/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/new-york-woman-jailed-days-mistake-article-1.1443123">told the Daily News.</a></p>

<p>Moses said that she was sideswiped on the Queensboro Bridge on May 25th while driving to work; the other driver fled the scene, so she called police to file an accident report. Cops also ran her name through a criminal database and discovered she was wanted on an active arrest warrant from a 2009 fraud case. But Moses had pleaded guilty to the charge and had served one year in jail of a 1-3 year sentence already. Even though that information popped up on the search, cops weren&apos;t sure what to do&#x2014;so they decided to throw her in jail.</p>

<p>&#x201C;The facts and circumstances surrounding the old warrant were &#x2026; ignored by the officers,&#x201D; said Moses&#x2019; lawyer, Sanford Rubenstein. Cops claimed they couldn&apos;t verify her story at the time because everyone was on vacation. She was eventually released without ever seeing a judge. A police spokesman told the News that the arresting officer and her supervisor had verified the warrant was for some unknown reason still active.  </p>

<p>Moses, who now carries a certificate of disposition of the criminal case in her wallet with her, is now afraid this could happen again: &quot;I&#x2019;m terrified of the police,&quot; she said. &quot;This has been a major setback for me; I was doing the right thing, and I was penalized.&quot;</p>
