<p>You may recall <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503193733/https://twitter.com/nicksanto534">Nick Santonastasso</a>, the New Jersey teen born with only one arm and no legs <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503193733/http://gothamist.com/2013/12/13/video_nj_teen_with_one_limb_pranks.php">who become an internet sensation</a> after posting videos in which he terrified unsuspecting shoppers by pretending to be a zombie. Santonastasso, 17, also happens to be a big fan of <em>The Walking Dead</em>&#x2014;and he pulled the &quot;ultimate zombie prank&quot; this week on cast member Norman Reedus, aka Daryl.</p>

<p>Santonastasso was flown to Tokyo by the show, where they were doing a press junket this week; star Andrew Lincoln (ya know, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503193733/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFnSgPC-VXA">the creepy guy who thinks you are perfect</a>) and makeup artist Greg Nicotero helped transform him into a full-blown zombie. Then it was just a matter of waiting for the perfect time to freak out Reedus.</p>

<p>Previous to this, one of his fans, Johnny Pope, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503193733/https://www.change.org/petitions/get-nick-santonastasso-on-walking-dead-please-robert-kirkman-put-nick-on-walking-dead#">started a petition on Change.org</a> to get him a role on the show. &quot;Nick has made the best out of his physical situation [sic] and it would great if he could work as a zombie on up coming walking dead episode,&quot; Pope wrote. Hopefully all this means Santonastasso will indeed get to be on the show this season.</p>
