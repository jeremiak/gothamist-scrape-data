<p>Yesterday, we learned that not all real life <em>50 Shades Of Grey</em>-esque relationships are as blithely happy as their fictive counterparts. Frankie Santiago, a 27-year-old S&amp;M; enthusiast who was a live-in fetish slave to 53-year-old Manhattan investment-banker Edward Sonderling, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422215841/http://gothamist.com/2012/08/15/50_shades_of_harassment_fetish_slav.php">was charged with</a> stalking, criminal mischief and aggravated harassment after their relationship fizzled out. Santiago <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422215841/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/whip_gal_tortured_soul_VKT5YHYtkPWALJ2MSslA6O">talked to the Post</a> more in-depth about their relationship today, and shattered the dreams of <em>50 Shades</em> fans everywhere: &#x201C;I&#x2019;m sure people want so badly to believe that that book is real. I don&#x2019;t give a s--t,&#x201D; she said.</p>

<p>Santiago mostly talked about Sonderling, who was known in the BDSM community as King Eddo: &#x201C;He had this reputation before he dated me&#x2014;his reputation preceded me,&#x2019;&#x2019; she said. &#x201C;So when he started coming on to me and pursuing me, I was really flattered.&quot; She said that despite their 25 year age difference and the regular morning spankings, they had a pretty normal relationship: &#x201C;We actually [had] a real life together. We&#x2019;re friends. We like to wear costumes. We party together.&quot;</p>

<p>As for the breakup, she said it wasn&apos;t because he was seeing another woman: &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t give a f--k about the other women, because there are tons of other women. Tons,&quot; she said. &#x201C;He&#x2019;s a very successful man. He&#x2019;s going to have a lot of women.&#x201D; She didn&apos;t discuss the text messages she sent him (including &#x201C;I hope you and [the new girl] rot in hell&quot;), but she did comment on the car window she is accused of breaking: &#x201C;OK, we got into an argument. A car window broke. Who cares? it broke,&#x201D; she admitted.</p>

<p>She noted that the 53-year-old spent much of his time outside of work keeping up his looks: &#x201C;He wants to...retain his youth,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;[He] wants people to see him as this S&amp;M; god, this king...Mick Jagger.&#x201D; One person familiar with Sonderling said he was a youth-obsessed gym rat: &#x201C;He&#x2019;s a pretty boy. All he knows how to do is doll himself up. He&#x2019;s extremely vain. It&#x2019;s all about his image, his persona.&#x201D; But hey, based on the pics above, he&apos;s doing something right we suppose.</p>
