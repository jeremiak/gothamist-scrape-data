<p>With <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430033814/http://gothamist.com/tags/breakingbad"><em>Breaking Bad</em></a>, unquestionably one of the greatest TV dramas ever, coming to an end after the second half of the fifth season, everyone has been going out of their way to celebrate the beloved show. That includes <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430033814/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/02/epic_breaking_bad_marathon_726-730.php">all-day marathons at Lincoln Center</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430033814/http://www.nbcnews.com/business/breaking-bad-beers-offer-taste-walter-whites-double-life-6C10566115">commemorative beers</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430033814/http://variety.com/2013/tv/news/breaking-bad-finale-to-screen-at-hollywood-cemetery-1200561143/">cemetery viewings</a>, and copious amounts of anxiety-driven breakfast-eating. And later this month, the Museum of Moving Image in Astoria will host its own exhibit: &quot;From Mr. Chips to Scarface: Walter White&apos;s Transformation in Breaking Bad.&quot;</p>

<p>The exhibit, which runs July 26th to Oct. 27th, will include props, video and costumes from the show. You can get an idea of what that includes below:</p>

<blockquote>Among the objects on view are several costumes worn by [Bryan] Cranston: the yellow Oxford shirt and khaki pants typical of White&apos;s daily wear; the black pork pie hat, black jacket and pants, and green shirt favored by White&apos;s alias, Heisenberg; the briefs worn by White during his first methamphetamine-making session, and the hazmat suit, gas mask, apron, and boots used in subsequent &quot;cooking&quot; scenes. Props include those relating to White&apos;s cancer treatment--pharmaceuticals, PET scan, strands of loose hair (the result of his chemotherapy)&#x2014;as well as objects featured in pivotal scenes in the series, including the pink teddy bear and Walt Whitman&apos;s Leaves of Grass. Also on view will be selected clips from the series, and behind-the-scenes footage.</blockquote>

<p>Also on July 28th, the Museum will present &quot;Making <em>Bad</em>: An Evening with Vince Gilligan, <em>Breaking Bad&apos;s</em> creator,&quot; a special program featuring video clips about the evolution of the show and White&apos;s character.
