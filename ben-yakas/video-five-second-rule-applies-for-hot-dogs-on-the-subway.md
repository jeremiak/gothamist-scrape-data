<p>At first, this video will probably tug on your heartstrings, and you may very well be filled with a hollow sadness, for the subway rider seen here does not seem to have all her wits about her (the videographer speculates she&apos;s on heroin), <em>and</em> she&apos;s dressed like Charlie Brown. But then, after about 20 seconds, the scene shifts from sad to mesmerizing and then something else entirely&#x2014;an ode to the resiliency of the human spirit. All those fights about whether eating on the subway <a 22="" 2011="" href"http:="" gothamist.com="" 03="" should_eating_on_the_subway_be_outl.php"="">should be illegal</a> become moot&#x2014;this video is, above all things, a celebration of the five second rule. (And at least she wasn&apos;t <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170705042830/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/15/video_man_licks_shoe_on_subway.php">licking her shoe.</a>)</p>
