										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:250px; "> <img alt="102710paladino.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429011603im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/102710paladino.jpg" width="250" height="179"> <br> <i>AP</i></div> We&apos;re starting to think that gubernatorial candidate Carl Paladino may be a bit confused as to the differences between a primary and an actual election. Asked about his chances for victory in the election next week, despite being down by 20 points in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429011603/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/10/27/latest-poll-shows-cuomo-ahead-by-20-points/?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">latest poll</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429011603/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2010/10/27/paladino-compares-islamic-center-design-to-wtc/">he told CBS</a> in a radio interview: &quot;<strong>I think they&#x2019;re very good. You don&#x2019;t pay attention to the newspapers or the polls. They&#x2019;re obviously skewed</strong>...Two days before the primary, they had me down one-point. Two days later, I won by 27 points. So, you tell me what value these polls are.&quot; We&apos;re starting to feel bad for the guy! But then he got back to doing what he and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429011603/http://gothamist.com/2008/09/17/video_of_the_day_mickey_rooney_mout.php">Andy Rooney</a> do best: complaining about everything.<p></p>

<p>Paladino was asked about his opposition to the planned Islamic center two blocks from Ground Zero, and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429011603/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/29/new_renderings_of_ground_zero_mosqu.php">new renderings</a> of the building: &quot;I heard early on that the name was &#x201C;Cordoba Initiative&quot;...In radical fundamentalism, that word alone means &#x201C;conquest and triumph.&#x201D; It&#x2019;s a symbol, a code word among the fundamentalists. They tried to change the name after people became aware of it&#x2026;obviously trying to hide their grand secret that this was a testament to conquering America. <strong>If you saw the design of the building, it&#x2019;s a replica of the World Trade Center. This is an affront to all the families of those who died on 9/11</strong>.&quot; And there we were, hoping all the controversy was behind us, getting ready to book a room in a four-star <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429011603/http://gothamist.com/2010/10/21/ha_in_lieu_of_ground_zero_mosque_ma.php">terrorist hotel</a> in Lower Manhattan.</p>

<p>With less than a week left in his campaign, Paladino still hasn&apos;t come close to matching the $10 million <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429011603/http://gothamist.com/2010/10/24/paladino_calls_manhattanites_catato.php">he promised to spend</a> on his campaign. But he has finally started paying attention to one constituency he&apos;s mostly ignored: Hispanics. He had a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429011603/http://www.lohud.com/article/20101027/NEWS01/10270346/Paladino-courts-Hispanic-voters">campaign stop meeting</a> yesterday with a group dubbed &quot;Hispanic Coalition for Carl,&quot; and tens of people showed up! Nonetheless, he remained steadfast in his commitment to be a tough-ass on immigration: &quot;There will be no sanctuary stuff going on. If you&apos;re an illegal immigrant, it&apos;s disrespectful for you to stay here when so many have worked so hard to stay here and earned their citizenship.&quot;</p>
