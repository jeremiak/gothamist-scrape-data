Brian Checo, 24, of the 34th precinct in Washington Heights, faces up to 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine when he is sentenced in June. </p>

<p>At Newark Federal Court today, he admitted that he and three other cops, one of whom was retired, staged the heist at the In Style USA Inc. factory in Carlstadt, NJ, busting in the room brandishing guns and badges, yelling &quot;NYPD! Hands up!&quot; They held 11 employees hostage while loading $1 million worth of perfume onto rented trucks. One of the hostages was able to call 911, and police tracked down the trucks quickly. </p>

<p>Checo tried to cover his tracks by reporting that his ID had been stolen, sources <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150113104123/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/rogue_nypd_cop_pleads_guilty_in_Jx8BJGnnPmXuJLayLbUp0K">tell the Post </a>. Charges are still pending on the other cops involved, including Officer Richard LeBlanca of the 34th Precinct, and Officer Kelvin Jones of the 46th Precinct in the Bronx, who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150113104123/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/09/third_nypd_cop_busted_in_million_do.php">went on the lam</a> for three days after the heist.</p>
