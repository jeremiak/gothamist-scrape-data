										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:170px; "> <img alt="9810marino.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141227115350im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/9810marino.jpg" width="170" height="364"> <br> <i>Officer Michael Marino</i></div> The high-ranking NYPD cop who was caught abusing steroids is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141227115350/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/regional/item_YOIcRwmwD9hIocfCHoA62I;jsessionid=0DABB7F95E7B09E3103CD11A81E2DEBE">facing</a> a 30-day suspension and a year of probation. Deputy Chief Michael Marino, 52, second in command of Patrol Borough Brooklyn North, was among two dozen cops who were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141227115350/http://gothamist.com/2007/10/17/cops_investigat_1.php">caught buying steroids and HGH</a> from Lowen&apos;s Compounding Pharmacy in Brooklyn in 2007. Marino maintains that he had a prescription for HGH, and that it was medically necessary, but an administrative trial judge disagreed. The ultimate decision on Marino&apos;s punishment will go to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141227115350/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/17/ray_kelly_feature.php">Dunkin&apos; Donuts-loving</a> Police Chief Ray Kelly.  <p></p>

<p>Marino, a 32-year NYPD vet, has also been identified as one of the central figures in Officer Adrian Schoolcraft&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141227115350/http://gothamist.com/2010/08/23/real-life_serpico_sues_nypd_for_tos.php">lawsuit</a> with the city. Schoolcraft accused commanding officers of massively under-reporting crime stats earlier this year, and is suing the NYPD for trying to discredit and silence him by throwing him in a psych ward unwillingly. Marino was one of the officers who showed up at his house and took him by force to the hospital. The suit <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141227115350/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/08/nyregion/08suspend.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">claims</a> Chief Marino placed his boot on Officer Schoolcraft&#x2019;s head as he was pinned down and said, <strong>&#x201C;It didn&#x2019;t have to be like this.&#x201D;</strong></p>

<p>Marino may only be facing a month&apos;s suspension, but Roger Clemens will pay a much steeper price if he is found guilty of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141227115350/http://gothamist.com/2010/08/30/roger_clemens_pleads_not_guilty_to.php">lying under oath</a> about using HGH. Today, his lawyer tried to persuade a judge to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141227115350/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/clemens_lawyers_ask_ny_judge_to_GBCKM3WqrWqonNEW6oEMPN?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">throw out</a> the defamation lawsuit filed by his former personal trainer, Brian McNamee. McNamee has accused Clemens of a calculated campaign to destroy his reputation. If Clemens and Marino really want to help clean up their images, they really should attend an anti-steroid fundraiser, just like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141227115350/http://content.usatoday.com/communities/dailypitch/post/2010/07/a-rod-to-attend-anti-steroids-fundraiser/1">A-Rod</a>! </p>
