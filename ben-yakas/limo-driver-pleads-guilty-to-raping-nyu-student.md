Queens resident Rajeev Kumar was sentenced to 15 to 21 years in prison for rape, sodomy and conspiracy.<p></p>

<p>Kumar <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629190746/http://www.dnainfo.com/20110607/downtown/limo-driver-pleads-guilty-brutal-rape-of-nyu-student">admitted that</a> he picked the woman up outside the club S.O.B.s in lower Manhattan in August 2000, then raped her in the back seat. But Kumar wasn&apos;t fingered for the crime until last summer, after he torched his limousine in the hopes of collecting insurance money. He had to submit a DNA sample after admitting to the arson, and his genetic profile matched the rape kit from the 2000 incident.</p>

<p>Police sources said that Kumar was in denial about being caught for the rape, and while being held in Rikers, plotted to hire someone to kill the woman, offering $5,000 to someone to &quot;get rid of his problem&quot; (at the time, it was said to be $15,000). <strong>&quot;[He] instructed him to inject the witness with drugs and then push the witness out of the window of a building,&quot;</strong> prosecutor Christopher Conroy said. The problem was, his hit man turned out to be an undercover cop. During the trial, his baby-mama denied that Kumar could have called the hit, because of his lack of funds: &quot;Fifteen grand? He doesn&apos;t have 15 dollars...He blew all his money on drink and gambling. It&apos;s all lies.&quot;</p>
