The chic Dumbo restaurant now wants a cabaret license to allow live music and dancing, while locals fear &quot;the restaurant won&apos;t kick concession revenues toward the under-funded, long-delayed Brooklyn Bridge Park project next door,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504170453/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/river_cafe_song_dance_POsl2CiVtPWnfCBDz1VwXI">the Post reports</a><p></p>

<p>Eater <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504170453/http://ny.eater.com/archives/2010/02/iconic_river_cafe_pays_city_5536_a_month_in_rent.php">points out</a> that the 33-year old restaurant now pays $5,536 a month in rent, which is the upside of signing a sweetheart lease in a &quot;desolate&quot; area when it&apos;s practically abandoned. But less than a year ago, when River Cafe was in a tiff with the Brooklyn Bridge Park project, we <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504170453/http://gothamist.com/2009/05/04/river_cafe_owner.php">noted</a> that their rent was only $1,667 a month. It turns out even sweetheart leases don&apos;t stay sweethearts forever. Maybe that&apos;s why they decided after nearly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504170453/http://gothamist.com/2008/08/05/nyc_waterfalls_may_be_killing_the_t.php">9 months</a> to sue for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504170453/http://gothamist.com/2009/07/04/river_cafe_sues_for_3m_over_waterfa_1.php">$3 million</a> over the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504170453/http://gothamist.com/2008/06/27/nyc_waterfalls_night_moves.php">waterfall</a> installation project? At least we can be comforted knowing that, although so many things in this world are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504170453/http://gothamist.com/2010/02/02/assemblyman_dont_let_sex_offenders.php">confusing</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504170453/http://gothamist.com/2010/02/02/salad_is_bullshit.php">ever shifting in perception</a>, the River Cafe prix fixe menu is still $98, and the tasting menu $125, same as a year ago. </p>
