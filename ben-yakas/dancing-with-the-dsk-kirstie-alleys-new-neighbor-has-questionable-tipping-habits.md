<p>Ex-IMF head Dominique Strauss-Kahn is under <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629163716/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/26/dominique_strauss-kahn_moves_to_swa.php#photo-1">swanky house arrest</a> at 153 Franklin Street, surrounded by all the blingy mob movie art a Yankophile could hope for. Back at 71 Broadway, he had been visited by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629163716/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/22/nycs_hot_new_tourist_attraction_71.php#photo-1">not-so-well-wishers</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629163716/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/21/imf.php">creepy neighbors</a>, but there&apos;s one new neighbor who isn&apos;t planning on bringing over a fruit basket anytime soon: actress Kirstie Alley. She did <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629163716/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/welcome_dsk_the_neighborhood_kirstie_Gwa58RCeJlKpUTr7czzb9J?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">tell the Post</a> that she wasn&apos;t nervous about living next to him: &quot;There are walls between us. It&#x2019;s America, and you&#x2019;re not guilty until proven guilty.&quot; Imagine <em>The Odd Couple</em> meets <em>Prison Break</em>: do we smell a sitcom? </p>

<p>Other new neighbors sounded quite annoyed Strauss-Kahn gets to live in the luxury, $50,000-a-month digs: &quot;He must really be suffering in there with the spa and private theater,&quot; Annette Goodman, rolling her eyes, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629163716/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2011/05/26/2011-05-26_dominique_strauss_kahn_new_digs.html">told the News</a>. &quot;It&apos;s the height of hypocrisy. House arrest does not mean a luxury townhouse.&quot; But Alley was less harsh in her estimation of the situation: &quot;I love our system of justice...Who knows what really happened? Hopefully, the truth comes out.&quot; One truth has already started to emerge from the miasma of the DSK scandal: Strauss-Kahn is a very questionable tipper! </p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629163716/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/the_pad_is_hoppin_grN3CI3Djj8JVit46WPaFP?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME">Post says that</a> he&apos;s been receiving orders of water (Poland Spring, not Evian), food and patio furniture in anticipation of the holiday weekend. He&apos;s rejected messengers carrying shark-shaped balloons, three men dressed as Rabbis, and worst of all, he stiffed one of the messengers whom he did receive. &quot;They never tip,&quot; said Danny Cotto after dropping off a box from Espresso Coffee. But the tipping scandal is more complicated than that, for the News points out that he paid a $25 tip to the deliveryman who dropped off $242.790 worth of steaks and salad from upscale Landmarc. &quot;It&apos;s a good tip considering I just walked around the corner. I&apos;m just doing my job,&quot; said deliveryman Ramon Leal. Guess we won&apos;t be seeing Strauss-Kahn&apos;s signature popping up on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629163716/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/29/are_you_named_on_this_website_outin.php">Bad Tippers site</a> just yet.</p>
