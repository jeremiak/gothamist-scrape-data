<p>The spirit of the holiday season has evidently already infected the King of the Combovers, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160622153633/http://gothamist.com/tags/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a>. No, Trump hasn&apos;t suddenly grown an inner life, or decided to listen to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160622153633/http://gothamist.com/2012/11/13/be_a_patriot_sign_this_petition_to.php">the hundreds of thousands of people</a> who don&apos;t want him to have anything to do with Macy&apos;s anymore&#x2014;something even less likely has happened. Trump is giving President Obama two thumbs up: &quot;Pres. Obama&#x2019;s steady support of @Israel throughout this crisis helped stop the war. He did a good job,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160622153633/https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/271330318487801858">Trump tweeted.</a> Look at the actual tweet below, lest it turns out Trump had hit that Birther bottle a bit too hard when he wrote it, and he decides to delete it.</p>

<p>Mind you, Trump <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160622153633/https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/266986057092964352">has previously claimed</a>, &quot;I don&#x2019;t hate the President at all. I just disagree with his policies!&quot; despite the fact that every single thing he&apos;s said about Obama over the last couple years has absolutely proven that he hates the president&#x2014;or, at the very least, enjoys the attention that trolling the president with his birther bullshit gives him. </p>

<p>And of course, nothing screams RESPECT like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160622153633/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/24/video_donald_trumps_big_october_sur.php">publicly extorting the president</a> in the name of charity, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160622153633/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/30/huge_jerk_donald_trump_thinks_hurri.php">politicizing Hurricane Sandy</a> to attack Obama, and having a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160622153633/http://gothamist.com/2012/11/07/huge_jerk_donald_trump_had_twitter.php">public temper tantrum/meltdown</a> over the election results. But between the Israel/Hamas <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160622153633/http://firstread.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/11/21/15338079-secretary-clinton-announces-gaza-cease-fire?lite">ceasefire</a> and this, it truly is a day to dream big:</p>
