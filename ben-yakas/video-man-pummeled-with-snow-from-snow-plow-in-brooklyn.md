<p>We know empirically that winter means snowstorms, polar vortexes, cavernous slush puddles, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420053115/http://laist.com/2014/02/07/video_jay_leno_leaves_the_tonight_s.php">deep personal loss</a>. Getting through all that is hard enough for most New Yorkers to handle. So it seems extra unfair that at least one person in Brooklyn was beaten down by a snow plow for good measure, as you can see in the videos below. Just like Wallace Stevens said: the listener, nothing himself, beholds nothing that is not there and the nothing that is, and also watch out for the giant snow plow, dude. </p>

<p>According <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420053115/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Snow-Plow-Slush-Knocks-Over-Man-Breaks-Glass-Door-Brooklyn-244112631.html">to NBC</a>, the incident was captured by surveillance cameras at the JM Legend Auto dealership in Sheepshead Bay around 5 a.m. Wednesday. The owner checked the tape after finding part of the glass front door broken. </p>

<p>&quot;We knew the snow was very slushy and very heavy, but we didn&apos;t think there would be such a speed of the truck coming down the block, plowing into all the snow,&quot; said owner Danny Marcos. The man in the video pops back up after his brush with the white devil, but even if he was physically uninjured, we all know there are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420053115/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/07/opinion/brooks-other-peoples-views.html">some wounds on the soul that last a lifetime.</a></p>
