<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161106152026/http://gothamist.com/tags/louisck">Louis C.K.</a> is all-in for Hillary Clinton, he said last night on <em>Conan</em>, but not because he&apos;s settling on a candidate: &quot;It&apos;s not a lesser of two evils,&quot; he said. &quot;I think she&apos;s great, super talented, super smart, I&apos;d take her over anybody else that would do it.&quot; And what he&apos;s most excited about is getting the first mom president after 240 years of dad presidents: &quot;It&apos;s not about the first woman [president], it&#x2019;s about the first mom,&quot; he explained. &quot;Because a mother, she&#x2019;s got it. A mother just does it. She feeds you and teaches you, she protects you, she takes care of you.&quot;</p>

<p>While C.K. was quick to say he had &quot;no problem&quot; with people voting for Trump, he got into why he thinks Trump&apos;s thin skin make him an unfit president: &quot;Four more years of a guy who can&apos;t be criticized. What&apos;s more important about a president than you can shit all over them? That&apos;s what presidents are for...the point of a president is to get drunk and blame them for everything.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We need someone who can take abuse,&quot; he continued. &quot;Hillary Clinton can take abuse. She&apos;s been taking it and taking it. We&apos;ve been hazing her, holding her down and spitting in her mouth and yelling at her...and she just keeps working!&quot;</p>

<p>He summed up his feelings on the election thus: &quot;If you vote for Hillary you&apos;re a grownup; if you vote for Trump you&apos;re a sucker; if you don&apos;t vote for anyone, you&apos;re an asshole.&quot;</p>

<p>Conan also continued <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161106152026/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/01/conan_obrien_harlem.php">his NYC adventures</a> by getting a dance lesson at Alvin Ailey:</p>
