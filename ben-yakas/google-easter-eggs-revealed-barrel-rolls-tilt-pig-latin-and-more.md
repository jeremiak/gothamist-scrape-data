<p>Reddit is all about Google easter eggs today: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111104062736/http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/lz1ns/til_if_you_google_do_a_barrel_roll_google_will/">User &quot;Tacked&quot; was amazed to learn</a> that one can command Google to perform the internet equivalent of stupid pet tricks. Because who wouldn&apos;t want to make their computer screen &quot;do a barrel roll&quot;?</p>

<p>Just go to Google.com, type in &quot;do a barrel roll&quot; (or &quot;z or r twice&quot;), and your whole screen will spin around (watch <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111104062736/http://lmgtfy.com/?q=do+a+barrel+roll">a demonstration here</a>). The phrase is associated with the Nintendo 64 game &quot;Star Fox&quot;&#x2014;one of the game&apos;s characters, Peppy Hare, would tell the player to &quot;Do a barrel roll&quot; with an on screen text display (to press z or r buttons twice!). According <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111104062736/http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=do%20a%20barrel%20roll">to Urban Dictionary</a>, &quot;do a barrel roll&quot; is what you say when someone asks you for important advice in their life.</p>

<p>Barrel rolls <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111104062736/http://img.ibtimes.com/www/articles/20111103/242964_barrel-roll-google.htm">aren&apos;t the only easter eggs</a> on Google&#x2014;if you type in &quot;askew&quot; or &quot;tilt&quot;, the whole screen will do so. If you search for &quot;anagram,&quot; it&apos;ll show &quot;Did you mean: nag a ram.&quot; If you search for &quot;recursion,&quot; it&apos;ll ask &quot;Did you mean: recursion.&quot; If you type in &quot;Google gravity,&quot; and then hit &quot;I&apos;m feeling lucky,&quot; the screen will literally fall to the bottom due to a &quot;lack of gravity.&quot; If you type in &quot;Google Pig Latin&quot; and hit &quot;I&apos;m feeling lucky,&quot; guess what happens?</p>

<p>You can see a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111104062736/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google%27s_hoaxes#Easter_eggs">full list of the easter eggs here</a> (and some <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111104062736/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/google/6201814/Google-easter-eggs-15-best-hidden-jokes.html">screenshots of some here</a>), including the Google Feed Ninja, Douglas Adams calculator references, and the hidden flight simulator feature in Google Earth. Unfortunately for Pro-Googlers, none of this <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111104062736/http://waxy.org/2011/10/google_kills_its_other_plus/">will make the loss of the + operator</a>, a standard bit of syntax used to force words and phrases to appear in search results, any easier to swallow.</p>
