Ryan addresses the congregation (AP)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>It&apos;s been a long month filled with deep reflection for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110226231249/http://gothamist.com/tags/rexryan">Rex Ryan</a> since the Jets lost the AFC Championship game against the Pittsburgh Steelers. He&apos;s spent some quality time getting in touch with the people, riding on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110226231249/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/12/rex_ryan_man_of_the_people.php">commuter trains</a> and filming appearances <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110226231249/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/24/rex_ryan_jets_to_la_for_a_csiny_cam.php">on CSI:NY</a>. But there&apos;s only one thing more effective at rousing the sleeping beast than <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110226231249/http://gothamist.com/tags/ihaveprettyfeet">pretty feet</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110226231249/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/10/jets_v_patriots_is_also_personal_fo.php">beating</a> those pesky Patriots: guaranteeing Super Bowl victories. &quot;I believe this is the year that we&apos;re going to win the Super Bowl,&quot; Ryan says. <strong>&quot;And the fact is I thought we&apos;d win it the first two years, I guarantee we&apos;ll win it this year.&quot;</strong></p>

<p>Ryan gave one of his patented <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110226231249/http://sports.yahoo.com/nfl/blog/shutdown_corner/post/Rex-Ryan-guarantees-a-Super-Bowl-win-again-a?urn=nfl-326059">rousing speeches</a> to reporters at the NFL scouting combine yesterday; it was a passionate four-minute soliloquy during which he talked about the expectations of fans, and his deep belief in the team: &quot;I look at it this way, the reason I think we&apos;re going to win is we&apos;re going to lock arms and we&apos;re going to find a way to get it done. The players, coaches, fans, we are going to lock arms, and when we do, we&apos;re going to find a way and I believe it, I think that will be the difference.&quot;</p>

<p>Ryan also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110226231249/http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/football/jets/2011/02/25/2011-02-25_same_old_rex_well_win_it_all.html">made it clear</a> that he doesn&apos;t think his predilection for guarantees takes anything away from his beloved team...because he <em>feels</em> victory: &quot;I don&apos;t care what people think. I care what our organization believes and what our fans believe. We&apos;ve gotten better. I know we got to the same place last year. It might not appear that we got better. But I thought we got a lot better last year. I think if we can improve a little bit more, why not us?...Why wouldn&apos;t I be positive? I&apos;m always going to say the same thing.<strong> I believe we can be champs. Why wouldn&apos;t I believe it? Somebody tell me why I shouldn&apos;t believe that we deserve to be a champion?&quot; </strong>Somebody needs to get Ryan decked out in a white suit, because he should be the star of a reality show where he travels across the country as a motivational guru.</p>

<p>Of course, there could be a couple hiccups along the way to that Super Bowl: at least four of the major Jets from last season, Santonio Holmes, Braylon Edwards, Brad Smith and Antonio Cromartie, all have expiring contracts. But Jets general manager Mike Tannenbaum <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110226231249/http://espn.go.com/blog/new-york/jets/post/_/id/4693/unrealistic-maybe-but-rex-wants-to-keep-as-many-players-as-possible">said the team</a> wanted to keep as many of them as they can: &#x201C;That has really been our goal. How many of those we will be able to keep is really going to be hard to say right now. We have a plan, that plan is in pencil, and we will see how things play out.&#x201D; The other major question is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110226231249/http://www.nj.com/jets/index.ssf/2011/02/true_to_form_jets_coach_rex_ry.html">whether there even will be</a> a football season this year&#x2014;if no new collective bargaining agreement is reached by March 4, there could be an NFL lockout.</p>
