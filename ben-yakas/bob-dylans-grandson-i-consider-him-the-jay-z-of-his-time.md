Dylan-Z?</i></div> <p></p>

<p>Many people consider <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150529015014/http://gothamist.com/tags/bobdylan">Bob Dylan&apos;s</a> classic &quot;Subterranean Homesick Blues&quot; one of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150529015014/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/is-bob-dylan-hip-hops-godfather-his-ties-to-beasties-roots-more-20100330">major precursors</a> to rap music, an electric fusing of &quot;labyrinthine rhyme schemes, anti-authority philosophy, pop-culture obsessions and street-level turns-of-slang.&quot; That connection certainly seems to be important to his grandson, hip hop artist Pablo Dylan: &#x201C;I mean, really, my grandfather, <strong>I consider him the Jay-Z of his time</strong>,&quot; Pablo Dylan <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150529015014/http://www.allhiphop.com/stories/news/archive/2011/07/21/22847570.aspx">told AllHipHop.com.</a></p>

<p>Not that it&apos;s necessarily a huge insult <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150529015014/http://www.buzzfeed.com/daves4/jay-z-hears-the-dirt-off-your-shoulders-beat-for-t">to compare Jay-Z</a> with Dylan, but it does seem a  little... backwards. Pablo, son of director Jesse Dylan (who helmed the Will.I.Am music video for &quot;Yes We Can,&quot; among other things) discussed his burgeoning career and the long shadow of his legendary grandfather today, acknowledging, &quot;<strong>What I have done, I mean from a musical and personal standpoint, is definitely influenced by him</strong>. Everyone around me influences me, and I have learned so much from him just listening to his records, but I hope his music continues to live on through what I continue to do the rest of my life.&quot;</p>

<p>As for Dylan, he has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150529015014/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/bob-dylan-on-christmas-memories-appreciating-hip-hop-20091124">gone on record</a> saying he definitely appreciates hip hop, but doesn&apos;t listen to it all that much. That didn&apos;t stop him from reciting LL Cool J&apos;s classic &quot;Mama Said Knock You Out&quot; on his Theme Time Radio Show...nor in making a hilarious guest appearance on Kurtis Blow&apos;s &quot;Street Rock&quot; in 1986 (you can hear Dylan at the beginning, as well at 6:12 minute mark). Listen to both below.</p>
