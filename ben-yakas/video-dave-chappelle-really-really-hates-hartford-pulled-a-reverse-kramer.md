<p>Last week, Dave Chappelle <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424160410/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/30/videos_dave_chappelle_relentlessly.php">tussled with the rough-and-tumble crowds of Hartford, Connecticut</a> during a stop on Funny or Die&#x2019;s Oddball Comedy Festival tour. Chappelle complained about people booing and talking during the set; he eventually gave up on performing and just sat on a stool smoking cigarettes and making small talk. At a stop in Chicago this week, he opened his set by explaining <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424160410/http://www.tmz.com/2013/09/04/dave-chappelle-f-k-hartford-ct-i-will-never-go-back/">how much he hated</a> that Hartford &quot;arena full of suburban torturers:&quot; &quot;I don&apos;t want anything bad to happen to the United States,&quot; Chappelle said, &quot;but if North Korea ever drops a nuclear bomb on this country, I swear to God I hope it lands in Hartford, Connecticut.&quot;</p>

<p>Seriously, Chappelle couldn&apos;t come up with enough ways to describe his rancor for the Hartford crowd: he called them &quot;evil&quot; and a bunch of &quot;young, white alcoholics.&quot; At one point, he criticized them for feeling &quot;lucky they got to see me freak out.&quot; He compared it to people seeing a Siegfried and Roy show: &quot;The shit&apos;s like being at the tiger show the night Siegfried and Roy got their throats ripped out by the tiger. It&apos;s fucked up, but I know deep down that&apos;s why you go to the tiger show...In the back of your mind, &apos;This motherfucker might get bit. I&apos;d see that for $35.&apos;&quot;</p>

<p>He also said it took all his self-control not to call the crowd a bunch of &quot;crackers,&quot; but he didn&apos;t want to end up like Michael Richards, whose career was ruined after he called hecklers the n-word during a comedy set in the mid-&apos;00s.</p>

<blockquote>I wanted to pull a reverse Kramer and call &apos;em all crackers or something crazy like that. I know that shit&apos;ll be on YouTube. &apos;Funnyman Dave Chappelle calls a room full of white people crackers.&apos; Couldn&apos;t do that. I felt bad when Kramer did that shit to us. I did. I was a fucking <em>Seinfeld</em> fan till the end, but when he did that shit i was like Kramer, that&apos;s fucked up. You lost me baby. That was the black in me. The comedian in me was like, &apos;Woof. He&apos;s having a tough set. Hang in there Kramer. Don&apos;t let them break you!&apos;</blockquote>
