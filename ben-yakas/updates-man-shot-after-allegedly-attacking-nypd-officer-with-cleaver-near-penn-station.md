<p>An FDNY spokesperson confirmed that the incident happened around 5 p.m. near Penn Station. He said that two people had been transported to Bellevue Hospital: one with a laceration that is serious but not life-threatening, and one with a gun shot wound that is critical. The spokesperson could not immediately confirm the identities of the wounded.</p>

<p><strong>Update 6:00 p.m.</strong>: Police confirm that the suspect assaulted an officer with a sharp object (&quot;possibly a meat cleaver&quot;) just before 5 p.m. today at W. 32nd and 7th. A second officer also suffered a graze wound; both officers, and the suspect, are in non life-threatening condition.</p>

<p>Witness Adam Pavley, 23, was walking in the area when the attack happened: &quot;I was about 300 feet from the shooting,&quot; he told us.</p>

<p>&quot;I was walking towards the entrance to Penn, then out of nowhere three cop cars came billowing down,&quot; he said. &quot;One cop car was undercover and driving down the wrong way. I was thoroughly confused.&quot; He made it to the entrance then heard the shots: &quot;It sounded like a full clip. Then panic ensued. Amtrak cops were swarming out of Penn like bees from their nest. People were running and knocking people over.&quot;</p>

<p>He wasn&apos;t able to see the chase, which was on the other side of the street. &quot;One guy I was talking to claimed there was another suspect who got chased out of the other side near the MSG entrance, but I didn&apos;t see the cleaver or the second person.&quot;</p>
