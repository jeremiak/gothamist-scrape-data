<p>On his way all the way to the spire of 1 WTC last week, 16-year-old Justin Casquejo <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408105309/http://gothamist.com/2014/03/20/teen_on_wire.php">told officials he snuck</a> past a sleeping security guard. After Casquejo&apos;s arrest, that security guard was fired. Now it turns out he wasn&apos;t the only guard fired: According the Post, &quot;A shocking cellphone photo obtained by The Post shows Abdul Basher, 65, stretched out nearly horizontal in his chair in the skyscraper&#x2019;s south lobby, where he was the only guard assigned to protect the ground floor of the top US terror target.&quot;</p>

<p>Basher, who was canned from his gig, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408105309/http://nypost.com/2014/03/26/half-blind-wtc-guard-caught-snoozing-on-the-job/">now tells the Post</a> that he is relieved that he has been fired due to his partial-blindness: &quot;Sometimes I cannot recognize people, stairs,&quot; the Queens resident told them. &quot;That post was so hard to cover for me. It was very, very stressful. I could barely see half of the lobby.&quot;</p>

<p>Basher suffers from a nerve condition and can&#x2019;t open his left eye, while he describes the vision in his right as &#x201C;hazy.&quot; Basher disputes that he was sleeping in the cellphone photo: &quot;To my knowledge, actually I was not sleeping. I was mistaken to be sleeping. I was exercising my eyes,&quot; he said. </p>

<p>A spokesman for the Durst Organization, which supplies the guards for the area, confirmed that Basher &#x201C;was terminated on the spot after he was found sleeping on the job,&#x201D; Basher&#x2014;who was named &#x201C;Security Officer of the Year&#x201D; for 2013 by his union, 32BJ union&#x2014;also said he was &#x201C;just getting ready to go on disability.&#x201D;</p>

<p>The Post seems to take some glee in all this, bashing the union and bringing up President Obama&apos;s out-of-context <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408105309/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/obama-warns-russia-ukraine-advance-article-1.1734113">&quot;nuclear weapons in Manhattan&quot; comments</a> before other major security breaches at WTC, like the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408105309/http://gothamist.com/2014/03/25/video_watch_wtc_base_jumpers_dive_o.php#photo-1">BASE jumpers.</a> </p>

<p>And a construction worker &quot;fumed&quot; when the Post showed him the photo of Basher you can see above: &quot;They play Candy Crush, they even have the Hulu to keep themselves entertained. It&#x2019;s f-king ridiculous.&quot; Construction workers, on the other hand, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408105309/http://gothamist.com/2014/03/26/one_world_trade_center_base_jumper.php">have other interests.</a></p>
