Bakary Camara, 41, who once dated Borough of Manhattan Community College student and part-time waitress Rita Morelli, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120111203924/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/01/bronx_man_arrested_for_fatal_stabbi.php">has been charged with</a> second-degree murder. He pleaded not guilty to murder from his hospital bed in Bellevue yesterday, but cops say Camara already admitted to the crime when cops found him, saying: &quot;I killed Rita.&quot;<p></p>

<p>In addition to the verbal confession, cops found a three-page note on Camara when they arrested him, giving more details about the crime. NYPD police commissioner Ray Kelly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120111203924/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/02/italian_college_student_murder_susp.php">previously described the note</a> as &quot;somewhat rambling,&quot; claiming it further explained Camara&apos;s motivation: &quot;There was some sort of evil spell placed over him, and that&apos;s why he did it.&quot; The letter also detailed a failed relationship he had with Morelli.</p>

<p>Morrelli, who moved to the city five years ago from her hometown of Spoltore, Italy, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120111203924/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/25/hunter_college_student_found_fatall.php">was discovered by</a> her live-in boyfriend with her throat slashed in their East 120th Street studio apartment in November. Police say Camara, a Gambian immigrant, tried to strangle her, then stabbed her twice in the chest and slashed her throat. Police tracked him down thanks to an &quot;anonymous&quot; 911 call he allegedly made from a Bronx payphone to report her dead body. </p>

<p>When cops burst into his Bronx home, Camara tried to stab himself to death. Police found the three-page note on him when they went to arrest him: &quot;He was standing there with a knife pointed at his chest. He makes incriminating statements as to the fact that he killed the woman. He then stabs himself in the chest,&quot; Kelly told reporters. </p>

<p>A judge <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120111203924/http://www.dnainfo.com/20111221/harlem/rita-morelli-murder-suspect-will-undergo-psych-exam">has now ordered</a> that Camara be given a psychiatric evaluation to determine if he understands the charges against him. He faces 25-to-life if convicted. </p>
