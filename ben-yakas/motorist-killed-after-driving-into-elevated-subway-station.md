<p>A motorist was killed last night after driving into an elevated subway station in The Bronx. According to police, the fiery crash happened around 12:15 a.m. underneath the elevated 1 train at W. 240th St. and Broadway. The driver of the 2011 Isuzu Rodeo, who hasn&apos;t been identified, was traveling southbound on Broadway when he struck an elevated train pillar, setting his vehicle on fire. A witness who was driving by the area just before the accident happened took the above photo, and told us: &quot;The flames were so high they were reaching the top of the 1 train tracks next to the accident.&quot;</p>

<p>After putting out the fire, authorities found the driver unconscious and unresponsive and his body badly burned. He was declared dead at the scene. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150103062902/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/bronx/bronx-motorist-killed-vehicle-crashes-catches-fire-article-1.1512186">The Daily News says</a> that a passerby at the scene told cops his daughter had died in a similar accident in Florida and asked if he could pray over the sheet-covered body. Cops say that the investigation is ongoing.</p>
