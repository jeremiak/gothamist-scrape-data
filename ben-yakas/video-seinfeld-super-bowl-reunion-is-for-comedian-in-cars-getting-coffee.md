The long-awaited <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508174904/http://gothamist.com/tags/seinfeld"><em>Seinfeld</em> reunion</a> finally emerged before the halftime show at the Super Bowl tonight&#x2014;and it turned out it WAS an ad for his web series, <em>Comedians In Cars Getting Coffee</em>, and it DID premiere during the Super Bowl. In the six minute clip, which you can see below, Jerry wants to take George to a place that makes stuff with cinnamon, but it&apos;s closed for the Super Bowl, so they end up going to Tom&apos;s Restaurant (the inspiration for Monk&apos;s) to discuss mumbling and Super Bowl etiquette. </p>

<p>The ad features a 1976 American Motors Pacer, as well as the return of Newman; presumably, it was written by Larry David and Seinfeld especially since Seinfeld brought up their obsession with &quot;intentional mumbling&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508174904/http://popwatch.ew.com/2014/01/06/jerry-seinfeld-reddit-ama/">in a Reddit AMA</a>).</p>

But <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508174904/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/30/jerry_seinfeld_reveals_secret_proje.php">Seinfeld has been cagey</a> in the weeks since, saying it was neither an ad nor something to the web series. All of which is to say, Seinfeld LIED. </p>
