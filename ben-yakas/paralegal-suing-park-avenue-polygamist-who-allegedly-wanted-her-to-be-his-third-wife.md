<p>Polygamy is illegal in New York (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130517071720/http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02564a.htm">with a punishment</a> of up to five years in prison) as it is in most of the country&#x2014;technically it&apos;s illegal in the entire country, but obviously it is tolerated in parts of Utah&#x2014;but that doesn&apos;t mean there aren&apos;t <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130517071720/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/23/nyregion/23polygamy.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0">polygamists living here</a>. And one 27-year-old paralegal claims her former boss is one such polygamist&#x2014;and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130517071720/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/indecent_proposal_nNn4CsfVnnSXI4jLnhegJJ">she&apos;s suing him for sexual harassment</a> for trying to convince her to become his &quot;third wife.&quot; </p>

<p>Sabrina Rafi, 27, claims in the lawsuit that her boss, 50-year-old James R. Ray, bragged about having multiple wives and continually hit on her after she joined <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130517071720/http://raypclaw.com/index.html">Ray and Associates firm</a> in December. &#x201C;At the beginning I laughed it off, [but] he became serious about it,&#x201D; Rafi told The Post. &#x201C;His expression changed from jovial to aggressive. I got pretty scared.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Ray didn&apos;t sound very subtle about these attempts either, according to Rafi: &#x201C;He was describing his sexual encounters with women. How he would say he met this woman at a club and she was from a Middle Eastern country,&#x201D; Rafi said. &#x201C;He said, &#x2018;You&#x2019;re from a middle eastern background too.&#x2019;&#x201D; HINT HINT HINT.</p>

<p>It all allegedly came to a head on January 15th, when Ray demanded Rafi go to dinner with him at Korea Palace on Park Street. Rafi claims Ray kept discussing lesbian porn (porn was &#x201C;the key to a successful relationship&#x201D;) while urging her to become his &#x201C;third wife.&#x201D; She told him she had a boyfriend, but he kept at it, and then came this bizarre scene with chopsticks:</p>

<blockquote>&#x201C;He said, &#x2018;I&#x2019;ll only eat it if you feed it to me.&#x2019; I was like, &#x2018;What?&#x2019; &#x2026;Honestly, I was like terrified at that point,&#x201D; she said.

<p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m picking up the chopsticks and my hands are shaking. I think I dropped the shrimp at one point. I picked it up again with the chopsticks and then he opens his mouth and closes his eyes as if he was in love with me.</p>

<p>&#x201C;It was humiliating for me to sit there with this much older man forcing me to feed him his food.&#x201D;</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>After that incident, Rafi says she started dressing in layers of clothes to work, and she claims she was fired by the end of the month by Ray <em>because of</em> the clothing (and, presumably, her rejection of him). Obviously these allegations sound horribly gross and inappropriate&#x2014;but at the same time, at least Ray didn&apos;t try busting out his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130517071720/http://thesocialgods.com/a-cave-mans-way-to-attract-women/">finest caveman club</a> to close the deal.</p>
