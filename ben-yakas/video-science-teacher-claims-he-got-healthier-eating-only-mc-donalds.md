So go ahead and eat <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505135417/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/30/photos_a_five-course_mcgourmet_mcdo.php">McGourmet meals</a> for the rest of your life, that&apos;ll definitely work out dandy.</p>

<p>John Cisna, a science teacher in Ankeny, Iowa, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505135417/http://www.kcci.com/news/central-iowa/science-teacher-creates-documentary-based-on-mcdonalds-diet/-/9357080/23750942/-/w7swjt/-/index.html">told KCII that he was</a> skeptical after watching <em>Super Size Me</em>, and decided to enlist three of his students in creating a NEW documentary, based on this hypothesis: &quot;I can eat any food at McDonald&apos;s (that) I want as long as I&apos;m smart for the rest of the day with what I balance it out with.&quot; So for 90 days, Cisna ate nothing but McDonald&apos;s for his meals&#x2014;but he <em>did</em> have a &quot;strict daily nutritional limitations of 2,000 calories.&quot; </p>

<p>The owner of the McDonald&apos;s franchise where Cisna tried out his experiment of course agreed to provide all those meals for free, because what company wouldn&apos;t want <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505135417/http://www.southparkstudios.com/clips/153261/jareds-coming">their own Jared.</a> After the 90 days, Cisna says he had lost 37 pounds, his cholesterol dropped from 249 to 170, and his low-density lipoprotein dropped from 173 to 113. </p>

<p>Cisna admits he also started walking 45 minutes a day during this experiment, which, ya know, probably <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505135417/http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/10/20/walking-health-speed-duration/2936233/">made a difference</a>. There are a couple other holes to his experiment: Cisna doesn&apos;t mention his own eating history (and family health history). He doesn&apos;t seem to have any conception of the fact different people have different bodies&#x2014;some of those bodies are exceptionally good at metabolizing junk food, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505135417/http://www.fitday.com/fitness-articles/nutrition/healthy-eating/fast-food-nutrition-junk-foods-effect-on-your-body.html">while most aren&apos;t.</a> </p>

<p>For all we know, Cisna developed a McNugget-loving parasite during the experiment which led to the weight loss. But Cisna thinks this <em>proves</em> that you can be healthy even if you eat food which McDonald&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505135417/http://gawker.com/mcdonalds-to-employees-dont-eat-fast-food-its-bad-1488825068">admits is unhealthy</a> to eat in bulk: <strong>&quot;The point behind this documentary is, &#x2018;Hey, it&apos;s [a] choice. We all have choices. It&apos;s our choices that make us fat not McDonald&apos;s,&quot;</strong> he said. You also have the choice to eat <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505135417/http://www.cbsnews.com/news/americans-are-obsessed-with-fast-food-the-dark-side-of-the-all-american-meal/">non-processed foods</a> created by companies that don&apos;t <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505135417/http://gothamist.com/tags/mcdonalds">exploit their workers</a>, but whatever, right? </p>
