<p>Vice President Joe Biden and Mayor Bloomberg were joined by three Newtown families <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130523230352/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/21/watch_live_biden_and_bloomberg_talk.php">at City Hall this morning</a> to demand that Congress have the &quot;courage&quot; to enact meaningful gun reform laws. &#x201C;The only question is whether Congress will have the courage to do the right thing&#x2014;or whether they will allow more innocent people, including innocent children, to be gunned down,&quot; Bloomberg said during the press conference, which included testimonies from the family members. &#x201C;If Congress does nothing, another 12,000 people will be murdered with guns this year alone. We just cannot let that happen, and it&#x2019;s up to us&#x2014;all of us&#x2014;to convince members of Congress that it&#x2019;s in everyone&#x2019;s interest to act now.&quot;</p>

<p>The presser came days after efforts to reinstitute a ban on the sale of assault weapons <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130523230352/http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/politics/2013/03/8483703/legislation-doubt-biden-attests-bloombergs-influence-gun-control">was abandoned by Senate Democrats</a>. Much of the proceedings seemed like a public shaming of Congress for that decision: &#x201C;I&#x2019;m really ashamed to see that Congress doesn&#x2019;t have the guts to step up and make a change,&#x201D; said Neil Heslin, whose son Jesse was among those killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School in December. &#x201C;I ask that Congress make a change to help prevent this from ever happening again.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Biden, who exuded warmth during his appearance and made sure to make eye contact with the families during his speech, was just as dissapointed: &#x201C;All those who say we can&#x2019;t ban assault weapons, for all those who say politics is too hard, how can they say that?&quot; He also gave considerable praise to Bloomberg, who has spent millions on trying to push tougher gun control laws: &quot;Let me begin by saying there has been no support that has been more consequential than the support coming from Mayor Bloomberg,&quot; said Biden. &quot;It has been immense. And it is organized, it is committed and it is consequential.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;This is not about anybody&apos;s constitutional right to own a weapon,&quot; Biden added. &quot;The loudest voices have to be for those beautiful babies at Newtown. The loudest voices have to be for those silenced.&quot; The event ended with Biden and Bloomberg hugging and shaking hands with the families&#x2014;although, as we all know, Bloomberg <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130523230352/http://gothamist.com/2012/11/16/frigid_mayor_bloomberg_called_out_f.php">isn&apos;t much for physical contact</a>.</p>
