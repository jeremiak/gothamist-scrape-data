<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none" style=" width:640px; "> <img alt="6811weinerwomen.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130414104950im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/6811weinerwomen.jpg" width="640" height="482"> <br> <i>Weiner&apos;s women, clockwise from top: blackjack dealer Lisa Weiss, porn star Ginger Lee, Gennette Cordova, and Meagan Broussard</i></div> <p></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130414104950/http://gothamist.com/tags/anthonyweiner">Anthony Weiner&apos;s</a> wife Huma Abedin, may be (understandably) keeping <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130414104950/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/08/weiners_wife_blindsided_by_his_sext.php">out of public</a> on a day when full frontal weiner shots have been leaked online&#x2014;but many of the six other disembodied ladies involved in Weiner&apos;s secret sext life have had no qualms with speaking to the press. In the case of porn star Ginger Lee, she was even <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130414104950/http://www.tmz.com/2011/06/08/anthony-weiner-porn-star-ginger-lee-joke-photo-twitter-scandal-laughing-yukking-it-up-twitpic-undies/">allegedly coached by</a> Weiner on how to handle the media. But at least it seems Weiner was able to retain his sense of humor in the midst of his chaotic last week: <strong>&quot;Btw, I&apos;m sponsoring a line of twitpic ready undies. I need a name,&quot;</strong> he wrote her.</p>

<p>In addition to Lee, there was 26-year-old <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130414104950/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/06/one_of_weiners_sext_partners_gives.php">Meagan Broussard</a>, a single mother from Texas, who also received the infamous gray-shorts crotch shot, and who said of Weiner: &quot;I don&apos;t think he&apos;s a bad guy. I think he&apos;s got issues just like everybody else.&quot; Another woman was Las Vegas blackjack dealer Lisa Weiss, who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130414104950/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/2011/06/08/2011-06-08_anthony_weiners_cybersex_pal_lisa_weiss_apologizes_to_disgraced_congressmans_wif.html">apologized to Abedin</a> for sexting with her husband: &quot;I should not have been flirting with her husband. I had a crush on him.&quot; She added that, their strange sextual tryst shouldn&apos;t be a reflection on his work: <strong>&quot;It doesn&apos;t make him a bad politician. It makes him a bad husband.&quot;</strong></p>

<p>Weiner&apos;s ex-girlfriend Kirsten Powers, who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130414104950/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/05/weinergate_examining_weiners_exes_c.php">defended him</a> last weekend in interviews, sounded as if she was just as betrayed as Weiner&apos;s wife. In a column <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130414104950/http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2011-06-08/anthony-weiners-ex-kirsten-powers-he-lied-to-me/">for the Daily Beast</a>, she bitterly wrote that he must resign from Congress immediately, lacing into him pretty fiercely:</p>

<blockquote>This has not been my position previously during the scandal, but as I have recovered from the shock of seeing an old friend&#x2019;s life unravel and have had time to get my mind around the extensive and sociopathic lying in which he engaged, there seems to be no other choice than for him to step aside and stop hurting his family, friends, and the Democratic Party. As more information trickles out about his online behavior with women, it has also become clear that he does not have the character to be in a position of leadership because of his misogynist view of women and predatory behavior.</blockquote>

<p>Powers wasn&apos;t the only person who was mulling over old conversations with Weiner: the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130414104950/http://origin.nydailynews.com/blogs/dailypolitics/2011/06/flashback-1996-anthony-weiner-in-cosmo">News pointed to</a> a 1996 feature in Cosmo on Weiner, in which he was voted one of the &quot;101 Gorgeous Real Life Bachelors.&quot; And the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130414104950/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/06/07/a-candid-and-prophetic-interview-with-weiner/?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">Times dug up</a> an old interview with him that was eerily prophetic about his Twitter persona: &#x201C;I know the risk. I&#x2019;ve seen enough stories about the risk, and I&#x2019;ve kind of kicked the line of the risk a couple of times.&#x201D; He also called his tweets, &quot;mostly pretty playful.&quot;</p>

<p>Weiner may have much worse problems then chatty ex-sexters and uncomfortable old interviews though: House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130414104950/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/he_likely_to_endure_rough_sex_probe_B8DC5KviX4b7QE2jyPmXTK?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">has formerly requested</a> that the Ethics Committee investigate Weiner. &quot;Weiner will have to reveal to the ethics committee the names of the others with whom he&apos;s exchanged sex-text images,&quot; said a former House prober. Oh, and have you heard: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130414104950/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/08/anthony_weiners_wife_huma_abedin_is.php">his wife is pregnant.</a></p>
