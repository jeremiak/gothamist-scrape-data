<p>We&apos;re just one day away from <em>Decision 2016: Escape From Democracy: Dear Lord Make The Pain Stop</em>, and both candidates are frantically running around the country trying to make a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110153724/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8AE7CzqCFc&amp;feature=youtu.be">last</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110153724/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vST61W4bGm8">impression</a> on any undecided and/or undead voters still out there. Also back on the campaign trail: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110153724/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/13/all_seeing_trump_zoltar.php#photo-1">The All-Seeing Trump</a>, a.k.a. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110153724/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/11/talking_trump_zoltar_machine.php#photo-1">Trump Zoltar</a>, who has a few new messages to share with the people (and an upgrade from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110153724/https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=3&amp;v=_Gyz22rjhws">&quot;most popular president ever&quot;</a>): &quot;[When] I start the Trump News Network, I&apos;m seeing a headline now: &apos;Trump Sexiest President Of All Time.&apos;&quot; </p>

<p>Tipster Eric Bishko spotted the talking animatronic Donald Trump Zoltar machine at Grand and Bedford Avenue, overseeing the NYC Marathon, yesterday. On Saturday, he was spotted campaigning in the West Village making a lot of big promises.</p>

<p>When <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110153724/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/13/all_seeing_trump_zoltar.php#photo-1">we spoke to the creators last month</a>, they noted that they got deep into the cadence, tone, verbiage and language of Donald Trump by forcing themselves to do a deep dive into his live appearances and speeches: &quot;One of the scariest things was actually sitting down and watching full Donald Trump rallies, not just the soundbites that most of us hear but actually sitting down and watching a 45-minute rambling, incoherent speech, if you can call it a speech. It sounded like a drunk man sitting on a bar stool next to you or something.&quot;</p>

<p>It seems that they&apos;ve updated their messages to the people, based on the series of videos they released last week:</p>

<p>This is our last chance to enjoy some old fashioned Trump satire before we collectively agree to never speak about the 2016 election again, and/or stuff Trump into a rocket headed into the sun, and/or it becomes illegal to criticize Dear Leader. After all, how many more surprises could Trump have in store for us in the next 24+ hours?</p>
