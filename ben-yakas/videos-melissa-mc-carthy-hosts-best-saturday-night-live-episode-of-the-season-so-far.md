Last night, Melissa McCarthy proved herself one of the best modern SNL hosts&#x2014;during one of the best episodes of the current <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160608180511/http://gothamist.com/tags/snl"><em>Saturday Night Live</em></a> season&#x2014;through a mix of deft physical humor and utter commitment to strange characters. This followed the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160608180511/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/10/video_justin_timberlake_and_stefon.php#photo-1">very good Justin Timberlake episode</a> from a few weeks ago. But while that episode was filled with all-star SNL alums and lots of returning characters touching on Timberlake&apos;s greatest SNL hits, McCarthy&apos;s episode was full of new sketches and weird tangents. Dare we say it: could SNL be on a (relative to its current state) roll? </p>

<p>Here&apos;s one thing that could be aiding the show: the guest writers. Last night&apos;s episode <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160608180511/http://splitsider.com/2013/04/the-kids-in-the-halls-kevin-mcdonald-is-guest-writing-at-snl/">featured none other</a> than <em>Kids In The Hall</em> alum Kevin McDonald lending a hand to the script, which may explain the <em>Kids In The Hall</em> vibe we were getting from the Mike Rice/Rutgers scandal sketch, one of the best of the evening. The first post-monologue sketch of the evening featured a lot of funny pre-taped material leading up to a live interview between McCarthy&apos;s bullying coach and Bill Hader&#x2019;s ESPN reporter.</p>

<p>McCarthy was also excellent in the &quot;Honey Baked Ham Bake Off&quot; sketch (unfortunately not online), in which she performed a bizarre dance backed by two hams to the <em>Jock Jams</em> soundtrack. The other killer sketch was McCarthy&apos;s pizza eater looking to get a loan, which ends with McCarthy in slo-mo snatching some pizza.</p>

<p>The monologue was charming, mostly for McCarthy&apos;s dedication to the bit and Taran Killan (this season&apos;s MVP) appearing with manufactured smiles to perform a song-and-dance number (echoing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160608180511/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/02/videos_snl_tackles_hpv_vaccines_for.php#photo-1">McCarthy&apos;s first SNL appearance</a>). And how could we forget a superlative Weekend Update, highlighted by Vanessa Bayer&apos;s Bar Mitzvah Boy Jacob (who mentions his cat David Ben-Purion) and the return of always hilarious Drunk Uncle&#x2014;who brought along Peter &quot;Drunklage&quot; Dinklage for some <em>Game Of Thrones</em>-inspired ramblings. Dinklage got perhaps the best line of the night: &#x201C;You know what&#x2019;s in my Tumblr? Regret.&#x201D;</p>

<p>And best of all, there were no dud sketches in the episode! Okay, that&apos;s not true: the cold open about North Korea was a typically dull and unfunny cold open; even an appearance by Dennis Rodman couldn&apos;t bring any life to it. And the Wheel of Fortune sketch wasn&apos;t very good, despite McCarthy&apos;s best efforts. </p>

<p>Click through for all those highlights, plus performance by Phoenix. And let&apos;s all hope Dinklage gets to host soon.<br>
