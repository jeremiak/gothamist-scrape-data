title: Le Bernardin Tests For Radiation As Sushi Lovers Panic

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="040611blinky.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110515091559im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_arts_john/040611blinky.jpg" width="275" height="206" class="image-left"> </span>Since the tragedy in Japan left the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110515091559/http://gothamist.com/tags/fukushima">Fukushima Daiichi</a> nuclear power plant teetering on the edge of a meltdown, alarms have been raised about radioactive materials spilling in the water. And some NYers are particularly worried about their favorite delicacy: sushi. It&apos;s a serious enough concern to Chef Eric Ripert of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110515091559/http://gothamist.com/tags/lebernardin">Le Bernardin</a> that he has bought a radiation detector: &#x201C;<strong>I just want to make sure whatever we use is safe...Nobody knows how the currents will carry the contaminated water,</strong>&quot; he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110515091559/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/06/business/06food.html?_r=1">told the Times</a>.</p>

<p>Health officials have assured the public that radiation is unlikely to show up in the food supply, and the FDA is inspecting all food imports from Japan to be safe&#x2014;about four percent of our food imports come from there. Even so, Patricia A. Hansen, a senior scientist at the FDA, acknowledged the fallacies of the radiation-detecting technology: &#x201C;One fish that might be at an intervention level in a huge cargo container, we&#x2019;re not going to pick that up. But the important context is, is that one fish at the intervention level a public health concern? No, it is not.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Nicholas Fisher, a professor of marine sciences at the State University of New York at Stony Brook, was a little less assured, and a little less reassuring, that everything would be copacetic: &quot;<strong>You&#x2019;re not going to die from eating it right away, but we&#x2019;re getting to levels where I would think twice about eating it.</strong>&#x201D; He did clarify that according to some radiation safety guidelines, people could safely eat 35 pounds of fish each year containing the level of cesium 137 detected in the Japanese fish.</p>

<p>Dovina William, who works at Ging Sushi and Asian Restaurant on the Upper East Side, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110515091559/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/atomic_sushi_jitters_hit_ny_Ajy4miATRuWG1urNbIsyhI?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">told the Post</a> that &quot;maybe 25 percent&quot; of their customers have started asking where their rolls came from. But as Trevor Corson, author of the book &quot;The Story of Sushi,&quot; points out, people are assuming that our sushi is coming straight from Japan: &quot;I was surprised. It made me realize that people have no idea that most of the fish isn&apos;t coming from Japan.&quot; But that doesn&apos;t mean the sushi industry hasn&apos;t been taking some heavy losses along the way: &quot;<strong>No way would I eat sushi in a million years</strong>,&quot; said Ben Goldhagen, a Manhattan real-estate broker. Well, for what it&apos;s worth, sushi would think twice before eating you any time in the next million years, SIR! </p>
