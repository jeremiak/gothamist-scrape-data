<p>After much <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110425193416/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/01/cuomo_finds_something_shammy_in_sta.php">anticipation</a>, Gov. Andrew Cuomo <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110425193416/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/gov_goes_on_chopping_spree_xdap8uh7dm5RCMh7gxll8M">unveiled</a> his first executive budget proposal to Albany yesterday, with a proposed $133 billion budget that includes $3.7 billion cut from the current spending plan, and no new borrowing or broad-based tax hikes. Cuomo&apos;s budget is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110425193416/http://www.nydailynews.com/blogs/dailypolitics/2011/02/the-big-cuomo-budget-preview">aimed</a> at reducing overall spending for the first time in the state in over 15 years (see the full budget <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110425193416/http://governor.ny.gov/20112012ExecutiveBudget">here</a>). Among the $9 billion in cuts includes $2.9 billion each in projected spending from Medicaid and local school aid; 10 percent across-the-board spending cut to state agencies; and as many as 9,800 layoffs if public-employee unions reject $450 million in annual concessions and givebacks. Cuomo was decidedly sober about the state of budget: &quot;New York state is functionally bankrupt. In a down economy, this is a death spiral,&quot; he said.</p>

<p>As for NYC, Cuomo aides said the city would lose $659.4 million in real dollars, including $579.7 million in education aid (and NYC homeless shelters would lose $16 million). Mayor Bloomberg criticized the budget plan, and alleged that the city was actually facing closer to $2 billion in cuts. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110425193416/http://www.nydailynews.com/blogs/dailypolitics/2011/02/state-budget-reaction-mayor-bloomberg">He told reporters</a> the budget &quot;does not treat New York City equitably,&quot; because it eliminates $300 million of revenue sharing aid to the city, while other localities faced a mere 2 percent reduction. &quot;The residents of our five counties pay a disproportionate amount of state taxes, and they deserve the same level of support,&quot; he said in a statement.  He also warned that this could lead to those copious teacher layoffs he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110425193416/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/31/budget_cuts_could_mean_layoffs_for.php">previously alluded</a> to. &quot;Yesterday, we had $1.4 billion more [for schools] than we do today. There&apos;s no way around that,&quot; one city official <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110425193416/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/mike_hit_on_city_is_not_fair_share_x3tk48wkZjMMFk0fBEjVUP?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">told the Post.</a></p>

<p>Cuomo also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110425193416/http://secondavenuesagas.com/2011/02/01/cuomo-removes-100m-in-dedicated-transit-dollars/">removed</a> $200 million in dedicated operating funds from the MTA&apos;s budget; with $100 million in economic development money, it leaves $100 million in losses for the MTA&#x2019;s budget. John Petro from the Drum Major Institute <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110425193416/http://www.dmiblog.com/archives/2011/02/cuomo_budget_cuts_mta_operatin.html">warned</a> that this could eventually lead to more service cuts if operating dollars aren&apos;t restored: &quot;The MTA can trim its costs only so much before more service cuts or fare hikes are on the way. Some of these service cuts will only be slightly perceptible&#x2014;dirtier train cars and stations, abandoned bus runs. If this trend of cutting operating funds continues, more severe service cuts will need to be considered.&quot;</p>
