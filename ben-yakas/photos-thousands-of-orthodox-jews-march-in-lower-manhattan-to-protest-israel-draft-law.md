<p>Thousands of orthodox Jews have gathered in lower Manhattan this afternoon <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501155938/http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/orthodox-nyc-jews-protest-proposed-israeli-draft-22839336">for a mass prayer to protest</a> proposed draft laws in Israel. Previously, the ultra-Orthodox had been exempt from serving in the Israeli military (it&apos;s mandatory for every other Israeli Jew). The government proposed a new law last month that would require a certain number of yeshiva students to be drafted. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501155938/http://www.vice.com/read/orthodox-jews-dont-want-to-join-the-israeli-army?utm_source=vicetwitterus">As Vice explains</a>, &quot;[The ultra-Orthodox] see compulsory military service as a form of religious persecution, denying them the right to practice and pulling them toward a more secular lifestyle.&quot; Check out photos from the protest in Manhattan below.</p>

<p>There have been lots of intense protests happening in Israel recently over the proposed change in the draft law. The debate has become so heated, some Satmar religious leaders <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501155938/http://jpupdates.com/2014/02/23/audio-satmar-rebbe-kj-idf-draft-bill-survived-auschwitz-well-defeat-israeli-govt/">have declared</a> a &quot;jihad against the Israeli government.&quot;</p>
