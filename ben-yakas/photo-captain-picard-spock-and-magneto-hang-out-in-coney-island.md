<p>Sir Patrick Stewart and Sir Ian McKellen have been on a quest to hit up NYC tourist spots as adorably as possible over the last couple weeks&#x2014;they&apos;re currently in rehearsals for the upcoming Broadway revivals of &quot;No Man&apos;s Land&quot; and &quot;Waiting For Godot.&quot; Along the way, they&apos;ve hung out <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131128061629/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/13/behold_the_ultimate_photo_of_sir_pa.php">with Elmo in Times Square</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131128061629/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/17/photo_sir_patrick_stewart_and_sir_i.php">visited the Empire State Building</a>, and even <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131128061629/https://twitter.com/SirPatStew/status/380722620099858432">rolled around in the trash.</a> But this weekend, they one-upped things by dragging Leonard Nimoy along with them to Coney Island. Which means Magneto, Spock, Captain Jean Luc-Picard, Gandalf, and Professor X were all hanging out together.
