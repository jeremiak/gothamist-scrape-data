<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171005155040/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/31/four_dead_after_chinatown_bus_overt.php">Yesterday</a>, a tour bus headed to NYC overturned on I-95 in central Virginia, killing four people and injuring dozens others. The driver of that Sky Express bus, Kin Yiu Cheung, from Flushing, is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171005155040/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/national_world&amp;id=8161795">now charged</a> with reckless driving. And the US Department of Transportation has completely shut down Virginia-based Sky Express company because of numerous safety violations, in addition to the accident.</p>

<p>Investigators believe that Cheung was fatigued when the bus overturned at 4:55 a.m. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171005155040/http://www2.timesdispatch.com/news/news/2011/jun/01/tdmain01-bus-company-shut-down-after-i-95-cash-kil-ar-1077099/">According to the Richmond Times-Dispatch</a>, he &quot;was the only person on the bus with a seat belt.&quot; Cheung is being held on $3,000 bail and is awaiting a hearing today. Sky Express issued a statement expressing condolences, adding, &quot;This is the first serious accident involving any of its buses. The bus driver has never before been involved in an accident.&quot;<br>
 <br>
Soon after the crash yesterday, local lawmakers began publicly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171005155040/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/05/31/lawmakers-renew-push-for-bus-regulation-after-latest-crash/">calling for stricter regulations</a> on bus companies: &#x201C;Right now there&#x2019;s a Wild West atmosphere. With a permit system you would be able to identify every day problems as they become chronic and before they are tragic,&#x201D; said Manhattan State Senator Daniel L. Squadron.</p>

<p>It&apos;s something they&apos;ve been asking for awhile: after a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171005155040/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/13/fatal_bronx_bus_crash_claims_14th_l.php#photo-1">bus accident in the Bronx</a> that killed 15 people returning from Mohegan Sun casino in March, there was a dramatic increase in surprise checkpoints for tour buses across the city (all failed), and lawmakers first began asking for a bill from the Legislature. </p>

<p>&#x201C;Locally, we can do more. Creating on a local level a permitting system would give the city information for the first time ever on who&#x2019;s operating here and other background information. And it would allow the city to work more closely with the federal regulators to go after the companies that are the biggest risks,&#x201D; said Squadron.</p>
