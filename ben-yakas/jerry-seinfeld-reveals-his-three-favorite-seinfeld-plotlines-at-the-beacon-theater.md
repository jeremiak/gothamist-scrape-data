<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130517071700/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/02/really_jerry_seinfeld_defends_reall.php">Adverb advocate</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130517071700/http://gothamist.com/tags/jerryseinfeld">Jerry Seinfeld</a> performed at the Beacon Theater last night for his first official stand-up show in NYC in over a decade (give or take a warm-up or two). Seinfeld knew his slightly-older crowd well, starting the set by congratulating them on the emotional effort they put in to physically make it to the show. His new set is made up of lots of husband humor (dads wear weird clothes on the weekend), observational riffs (who <em>doesn&apos;t</em> feel like David Copperfield at faucets), soliloquies on Pop-Tarts, and a surprising amount of rushing around the stage. We don&apos;t want to spoil too much for anyone going to one of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130517071700/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/25/jerry_seinfeld_is_bringing_his_stan.php">the other four NYC-area shows</a>&#x2014;but at the end, Seinfeld came back out to take questions from the audience, and he revealed what his three favorite plotlines were from <em>Seinfeld</em>. And two of them are pretty, pretty dark.</p>

<p>1. <em>The Invitations</em></p>

<p>2. <em>The Rye</em></p>

<p>3. <em>The Marine Biologist</em></p>

<p>It&apos;s a little surprising, since Seinfeld previously said his least favorite <em>Seinfeld</em> episode <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130517071700/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/22/get_out_jerry_seinfelds_least_favor.php">is &quot;The Alternate Side&quot;</a>, because it involved a stroke victim&#x2014;so stroke victim is TOO dark, but stealing a marble rye from an old hag is just right. Seinfeld also noted that &quot;like many of you&quot;, he forgets which plot lines go with which episodes oftentimes. He also said he would have biked to the Beacon if it wasn&apos;t for the rain&#x2014;instead, he had to take out one of his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130517071700/http://comediansincarsgettingcoffee.com/">beloved vintage cars.</a></p>
