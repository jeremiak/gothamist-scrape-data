<p>Joe.My.God <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429083519/http://joemygod.blogspot.com/2011/07/choot-spa.html">points out</a> this hilarious clip of Tea Party Princess/<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429083519/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/18/michele_bachmann_gears_up_for_hilar.php">presidential candidate</a> Michelle Bachmann verbally fercockting her yiddish slang. Yesterday on Fox News show &quot;On The Record,&quot; in the midst of a rousing indictment of President Obama and his Obamathematics, she inadvertently coined our newest favorite word by mispronouncing &quot;chutzpah&quot; as &quot;choot-spa.&quot; Perhaps she was actually referring to a dusty relaxation center in dire need of a cockney chimney sweeper? Or something <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429083519/http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=choot">even raunchier</a>? Whatever her intentions, it made us plotz. Watch the short clip below, then eat something already, you&apos;re skin and bones!</p>
