<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021171233/http://gothamist.com/tags/billyonthestreet"><em>Billy On The Street</em></a> has become must watch TV (or at least, must watch TV clips) for anyone who cares about the state of man-shouting-on-the-street humor. But this latest clip has the least amount of shouting I&apos;ve ever heard in a segment&#x2014;instead, Billy Eichner launches a very serious-ish investigation into whether gay people care about his guest, John Oliver. And it turns out most don&apos;t&#x2014;but they do love Wendy Williams.</p>

<p>One person who gay NYers definitely care about? Debra Messing, who returned to the show for a special holiday-themed &quot;IT&apos;S DEBRA MESSING, YOU GAYS!!!&quot; segment.</p>
