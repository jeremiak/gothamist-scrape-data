<p>Collins came out in an article in Sports Illustrated last May: &quot;A huge weight has been lifted,&quot; he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428175423/http://dcist.com/2013/04/video_jason_collins_on_coming_out_a.php">said at the time</a>. &quot;I&apos;ve already been out to my family and my friends, but just to, you know, sort of rip the Band-Aid off and come out on my own terms.&quot; He played with the Washington Wizards last season, but has been an unsigned free agent since then. </p>

<p>&quot;It&#x2019;s 2014,&quot; Nets star Deron Williams said Friday when asked if the NBA was ready for an openly gay player. &quot;Michael Sam just came out, and his teammates welcomed him, and they&#x2019;re in college. It&#x2019;s time for the NBA, as well.&quot; Collins played parts of seven season with the Nets between 2001-08; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428175423/https://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nba-ball-dont-lie/nets-sign-jason-collins-nba-first-openly-gay-172051031--nba.html">according to Yahoo</a>, his ex-teammate Jason Kidd has been an advocate of signing him.</p>

<p>Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams released this statement as well:</p>

<blockquote>The return of Jason Collins to the Nets franchise is a milestone for all Brooklynites to celebrate. He began his career with this team, helping it win its first Eastern Conference titles in back-to-back seasons, and was beloved by teammates and fans for his professionalism and leadership. Last year, he became the first active male athlete in one of America&apos;s four major professional sports to publicly identify as gay. In doing so, he became a trailblazer for the LGBT community and a role model for every community, especially our young people. Today, Brooklyn is truly proud to be Jason&apos;s hometown team, as he has brought us pride both on and off the court. I wish him the best of success in helping to bring our borough its first sports championship in 59 years. Let&apos;s go Nets!</blockquote>
