<p>Actor, director, and philanthropist <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428180616/http://gothamist.com/tags/robertdeniro">Robert de Niro</a> has never been much of a soccer fan (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428180616/http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jan/10/de-niro-stallone-bbc-football-focus">his words!</a>), but like seemingly all Americans today, De Niro didn&apos;t want to miss the hotly anticipated <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428180616/http://gothamist.com/2014/06/26/germany_wins_but_so_does_usa_usmnt.php">US/Germany World Cup match</a>. So he did what any self-respecting celeb would do: he pulled a Bill Murray and crashed a house party in Brooklyn.</p>

<p>According <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428180616/http://www.businessinsider.com/robert-de-niro-crashed-world-cup-party-brooklyn-2014-6">to Business Insider</a>, De Niro was in Cobble Hill filming <em>The Intern</em> today when he decided he wanted a break to be able to watch the game. His reps apparently sent this email out to people in a building where they were filming: &quot;Our lead actor, Robert DeNiro, would very much like to watch the World Cup game, today at 12p,&quot; the email said. &quot;Would it be possible to place a small portable satellite on the building rooftop ASAP and run a cable to the street to help facilitate this request?&quot;</p>

<p>De Niro was subsequently invited to a nearby house where people were watching the game. &quot;We got another email from a neighbor saying he talked to the crew and apparently he found a house of people watching it and joined them,&quot; a neighbor told BI.</p>

<p>While De Niro might not be much of a soccer aficionado, he has inspired Portugal player Raul Meireles&apos; style: Meireles has been sporting a thick beard and Mohawk haircut which the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428180616/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/worldcup2014/article-2659395/Raul-Meireles-haircut-like-Robert-De-Niro-Taxi-Driver-shame-poor-Portugal-lift-against-Germany.html">Daily Mail thinks</a> was directly taken from De Niro&apos;s look at the end of <em>Taxi Driver.</em> </p>
