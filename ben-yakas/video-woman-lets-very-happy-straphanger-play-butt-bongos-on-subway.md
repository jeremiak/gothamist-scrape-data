										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="81813bongos.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160115224516im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/81813bongos.jpg" width="640" height="480" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>Here&apos;s a nice change of pace from all the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160115224516/http://gothamist.com/tags/subwayperv">subway pervs</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160115224516/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/06/video_preppy_drunk_racist_punishes.php">racist ranters</a>: in the videos below, a gentleman who looks like he stumbled out of Margaritaville is invited (and encouraged) to simulate playing the bongos upon the derriere of a young lady on the subway. </p>

<p>Or as the video more bluntly puts it, &quot;Puerto Rican drunk girl lap dance for bum.&quot; But regardless, his enthusiasm&#x2014; his look of gleefulness&#x2014;is intoxicating. It feels like everyone was really grooving to those butt bongos.</p>
