<p>Have you ever taken a close look at the statue in McGolrick Park in Greenpoint? No, have you <em>really</em> looked at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504150719/http://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/B114/highlights/11366">the tribute to Swedish-American engineer and inventor John Ericsson</a>? Because photographer Katie Sokoler did, and she noticed something rather strange about it: &quot;I guess the sculptor wanted John Ericsson to be remembered for designing the Monitor ship...and for not being able to control his bowels.&quot; While we&apos;re pretty sure that&apos;s his foot awkwardly resting under his buttocks, it is certainly a very poopy-looking foot. Click through to take a closer look at the statue and decide for yourself.</p>
