<p>As Mayor Bloomberg <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424140747/http://gothamist.com/2012/11/04/cuomo_subway_service_will_not_be_no.php">excitedly announced</a> this morning, more than 80% of the MTA transit system has now been restored since <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424140747/http://gothamist.com/tags/hurricanesandy">Hurricane Sandy</a> shutdown the subways for days last week. However, as Bloomberg <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424140747/http://gothamist.com/2012/11/04/watch_live_soon_bloomberg_updates_c_1.php">also noted</a>, tomorrow morning&apos;s commute is probably going to suck badly. </p>

<p>MTA Chairman Joe Lhota said straphangers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424140747/https://twitter.com/andrewsiff4NY/status/265214791986081792">should expect</a> fewer trains tomorrow, as well as &quot;significant crowding.&quot; Even though 80% of the lines are restored, it&apos;ll carry less than 80% of normal capacity. And that&apos;s because <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424140747/https://twitter.com/andrewsiff4NY/status/265214368776589312">Lhota says</a>, <strong>&quot;we are concerned if we overtax the system, the system could come down.&quot; </strong></p>

<p><b>UPDATED</b>: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424140747/http://alert.mta.info/sites/default/files/pdf/hurricane_recovery_map_bw_Nov5_0.pdf">You can go here to see a PDF</a> of the latest MTA subway map, which among other things, shows cross-river service has been restored on the A, C, D, F, M 2 &amp; 3 lines.  The MTA is hard at work now to restore the B, G and Z. But they caution that the two lines that will take longest are the L&apos;s Brooklyn-Manhattan access and the G; they might not be ready till later this week, at best.</p>

<p>The MTA <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424140747/https://twitter.com/MTAInsider/status/265210996799447042">offered this plea</a> to commuters: &quot;Subway and bus riders, if possible, we recommend commuting earlier in the morning or later in the day to help reduce overcrowding tomorrow.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424140747/http://www.mta.info/">Keep checking here</a> for more service updates.</p>
