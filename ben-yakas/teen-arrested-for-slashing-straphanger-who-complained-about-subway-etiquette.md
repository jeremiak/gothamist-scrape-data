<p>A teen was arrested after he allegedly slashed a straphanger who complained about him blocking the turnstiles at a Manhattan subway station.</p>

<p>Police say the incident happened this past Tuesday just before 8 p.m. at the 2/3 West 125th Street subway station near Lenox Avenue in Harlem. The 17-year-old suspect <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110095234/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/subway-punk-knifes-straphanger-loitering-complaint-article-1.2765251">was apparently sitting</a> on the arm of one of the turnstiles blocking people from being able to pass through. The 42-year-old male victim asked him to move, and an argument ensued.</p>

<p>The teen allegedly took out a blade and stabbed the man in the left hand and slashed him in the right hand, then fled the area. Two cops recognized the young man from a surveillance photo and arrested him hanging around the same station yesterday. </p>

<p>The teen has been charged with assault, criminal possession of a weapon, and menacing. </p>
