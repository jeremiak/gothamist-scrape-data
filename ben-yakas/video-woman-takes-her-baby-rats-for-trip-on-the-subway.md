<p>Isn&apos;t it enough that we <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150328003639/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/08/disgusting_mutant_rat_declared_most.php#photo-1">hold beauty contests</a> for them? Isn&apos;t it enough that we try to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150328003639/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/03/can_birth_control_bait_stop_nycs_ra.php">provide them with birth control</a>? For some people, nothing will be enough when it comes to their beloved pet rats. The woman in the video below cuddling with her baby rats (they were born 5 days ago) explains why she treats them like her own children as she cleans their cage on the subway: &quot;She&apos;s like my daughter, I&apos;m the mother. So why would I let my child sit in something they shit in...that&apos;s kind of harsh...I look at them all as God&apos;s creatures because God created me...so at the end of the day I treat them as my equal.&quot; It&apos;s just too bad she can&apos;t treat her fellow straphangers as equals and respect them enough not to clean her disgusting, disease-laden rat cage in a public place.</p>

<p>We appreciate how much she cares for her babies, but she&apos;s lucky none of her fellow riders ended up <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150328003639/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/26/video_rat_on_the_r_train_sends_stra.php">shrieking wildly</a>, or suffering <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150328003639/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/10/woman_traumatized_by_rat_attack_i_d.php">from PTSD because of the close quarters.</a> She&apos;s also lucky none of her rats <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150328003639/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/13/video_rat_in_subway_car_crawls_over.php">crawled on anybody&apos;s face</a>&#x2014;well, we&apos;re all lucky that didn&apos;t happen, because people <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150328003639/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/14/spoiler_this_rat_on_a_subway_train.php">tend not to react to well to that sort of thing.</a></p>

<p>But hey, at the end of the day, this lady still has nothing on our favorite subway rat owner, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150328003639/http://gothamist.com/tags/sadratman">Rat Man.</a> Does she make out with her rats in public? We think not. </p>
