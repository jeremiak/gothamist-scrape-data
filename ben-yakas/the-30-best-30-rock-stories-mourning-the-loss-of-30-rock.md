<p>In case you were too busy LIZZING on MILF ISLAND to have noticed, beloved NYC-based sitcom <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509173843/http://gothamist.com/tags/30rock"><em>30 Rock</em></a> is airing its finale tonight after seven hilarious seasons filled with FUN COOKERS, GREENZO, THE CLEVE, THOUGHTSICLES and WEREWOLF BAR MITZVAH. At first, we were planning on putting together a post on how unrealistic Liz Lemon&apos;s apartment was, or asking our local bodega guy what they&apos;ll most miss about the show, or compiling a list of our favorite NYC moments from the show...until we took a look at our Twitter feed and realized dozens of TV critics and cultural websites had already written every possible listy permutation about the show. So instead, we&apos;ve compiled our own list of the 30 best thinkpieces and lists about the end of <em>30 Rock</em>, thereby creating the ultimate <em>30 Rock</em> farewell compilation list of lists. Prepare yourself for overlap.</p>
