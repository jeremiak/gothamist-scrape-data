<p>Today marks the 10th anniversary of the Smoke-Free Air Act, which as Mayor Bloomberg predicted, was not the end of NYC&apos;s hospitality, restaurant and tourism industries. It seems fitting that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717104812/http://gothamist.com/tags/starbucks">Starbucks</a> is choosing this moment to enact a new smoking policy themselves: as of Saturday, patrons will no longer be allowed to smoke within 25 feet of any Starbucks location. </p>

<p>Starbucks spokeswoman Jaime Lynn Riley <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717104812/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2013/05/31/starbucks-to-ban-smoking-within-25-feet-of-cafes/?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter">told reporters that</a> the intent is to expand the indoor no-smoking policy to the outdoor seating areas&#x2014;however, even if a location doesn&apos;t have an outdoor sitting area, the rule will still apply. So if you&apos;re smoking right now, please extinguish your cigarette&#x2014;it&apos;s a pretty safe bet you&apos;re outside a Starbucks.</p>

<p>Some Starbucks aficionados are calling the company out for hypocrisy for banning smoking... but not guns: &quot;That Starbucks would take such a position after so loudly deciding not to ban people with guns from its stores because the company said it would follow local laws seems to be the height of hypocrisy,&quot; wrote George Edmonson <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717104812/http://www.starbucksgossip.com/">on Starbucks Gossip</a>. &quot;Apparently, the company is scared of the NRA but doesn&apos;t fear smokers.&quot; Well, there are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717104812/http://gothamist.com/tags/bloomberg">some former smokers</a> who they obvious do feel a kinship to, at the very last.</p>
