<p>Thanksgiving is about a lot of things, like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140206163704/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/27/tryptophan_lies.php">tryptophan scaremongering</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140206163704/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/29/photos_video_low-flying_balloons_de.php#photo-1">inflatable balloons</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140206163704/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/30/video_women_fight_use_stun_gun_duri.php">stun gun fights</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140206163704/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/29/photos_heres_what_gothamist_ate_for.php#photo-7">whatever this was.</a> But it&apos;s <em>not</em> about threatening your family with a giant machete, even if they do spill the cranberry juice on you, won&apos;t let you watch the Cowboys game, or don&apos;t invite you over.</p>

<p>Police say Joseph Hoo, 48, was arrested on Thursday in New Milford after he allegedly threatened his family with an 18-inch machete after he and his 18-year-old son weren&apos;t invited to dinner. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140206163704/http://www.nj.com/bergen/index.ssf/2013/11/police_montclair_man_angry_over_thanksgiving_snub_pulls_machete_on_new_milford_family.html">According to NJ.com</a>, &quot;The victim&#x2026;stated that Joseph Hoo arrived at the residence and was asked to leave at which time he brandished the machete on the driveway of the residence and made threatening remarks to the family inside.&quot; </p>

<p>When cops arrived at the family&apos;s house around 2 p.m., they stopped Hoo in his van, and found the machete as well as two baseball bats. He has been charged with unlawful weapons possession, terroristic threats and possession of a weapon for unlawful purposes.</p>
