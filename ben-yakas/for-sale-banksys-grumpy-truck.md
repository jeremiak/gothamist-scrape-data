<p>Yesterday, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160925201632/http://gothamist.com/tags/banksy">Banksy</a> unveiled <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160925201632/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/26/photo_newest_banksy_is_on_a_truck_i.php#photo-1">the newest piece</a> of his Better Out Than In month-long NYC residency: an &quot;alternative New York bumper slogan&quot; on a truck in Sunset Park that read, &quot;The grumpier you are the more assholes you meet.&quot; And if you missed out on the Central Park stand and have been wanting to own a piece of Banksy, here&apos;s your chance: the owner of the truck wants to sell it to the highest bidder. &quot;I can replace the truck, so it doesn&apos;t have value to me&#x2014;but it has value to someone else,&quot; owner Israel told us.</p>

<p>Israel, who runs I &amp; A Merchandise Inc., said Banksy didn&apos;t get his permission to mark the truck, and he only found out about it on Saturday evening. &quot;We don&apos;t answer the phones on Saturday, because we&apos;re Jewish,&quot; he told us. &quot;We found out last night when we got <em>a lot</em> of messages.&quot; He has since moved the truck from 131 47th Street between 1st and 2nd Avenues to &quot;an unknowable location&quot; so that it &quot;doesn&apos;t get vandalized anymore.&quot;</p>

<p>Israel says he&apos;s very serious about selling the truck to the highest bidder, and claims he&apos;s already received an offer of $100K (although he sounded slightly skeptical about that number). He added that he had never heard of Banksy before last night: &quot;For me, it&apos;s worth nothing more than art on the other sides of the truck. I don&apos;t know art. To me it has no value. I cant appreciate it.&quot;</p>

<p>If you are interested in purchasing this original Banksy piece, you can call Israel with your offer at 718-832-4927.</p>
