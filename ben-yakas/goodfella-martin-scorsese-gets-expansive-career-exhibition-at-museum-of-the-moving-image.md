					<p>If you&apos;re sitting at home after hours over the coming weeks, simmering like a raging bull with no one knocking on your door, you can break the silence by departing for the mean streets. Instead of heading to a casino, hail a taxi driver and head over to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161214183403/http://gothamist.com/tags/museumofmovingimage">Museum Of The Moving Image</a> for an expansive exhibition on the work of the great <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161214183403/http://gothamist.com/tags/martinscorsese">Martin Scorsese</a>. It&apos;s certainly much more enjoyable than my attempt at being the king of comedy in the previous sentences, which may have turned you the color of money.</p>

<p>Over 600 objects in total, many from Scorsese&apos;s 24 films so far, will be on display at the Queens museum from December 11th through April 23rd, 2017. In addition to the items in the titular exhibition, which includes pieces from his personal life, there will be also be a comprehensive retrospective of the director&#x2019;s work, &quot;supplemented with personal appearances. Additional screenings will feature a selection from the hundreds of classic movies restored by the Film Foundation under Scorsese&#x2019;s supervision, and a selection of films that formed his lifelong love of cinema.&quot;</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161214183403/http://www.movingimage.us/exhibitions/2016/12/11/detail/martin-scorsese/">museum writes</a> of the exhibit: &quot;Drawing extensively from Scorsese&#x2019;s own collection, the exhibition includes production material from his key films, objects from his childhood, behind-the-scenes images, and large-scale projections of scenes from his work. It is organized thematically: Family, Brothers, Men and Women, Lonely Heroes, New York, Cinephile, Cinematography, Editing, and Music.&quot;</p>

<p>To give you some idea of the breadth of the exhibition, here&apos;s a few highlights among the many items on display: draft script pages for <em>The Last Temptation of Christ</em> annotated by Scorsese; hand-drawn storyboards for almost all his movies; script pages for <em>Taxi Driver</em> annotated by Robert De Niro; tattoos worn by De Niro as Max Cady in <em>Cape Fear</em>; the boxing gloves from <em>Raging Bull</em>; a letter from Alain Renais to Scorsese; sets for <em>Gangs of New York</em>; transcript of recording from the Belmore Cafeteria in 1975 (conversations between real taxi drivers eating there were used as the basis of some dialogue in <em>Taxi Driver</em>); Robert De Niro&#x2019;s real taxi driver&#x2019;s license; and a large-scale map of New York (mainly Manhattan) that points out key locations for some of Scorsese&apos;s films.<br>
