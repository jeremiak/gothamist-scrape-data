<p>It&apos;s been <strike>months</strike> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506150016/http://gothamist.com/2014/07/11/polar_vortex_knock-off_coming_back.php">a month</a> since we&apos;ve given any thought to the never-ending winter of 2013/2014 and that darn <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506150016/http://gothamist.com/tags/polarvortex">Polar Vortex</a> which briefly turned us <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506150016/http://gothamist.com/2014/02/28/more_snow_ha_ha_ha_haaa.php">into paranoid</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506150016/http://gothamist.com/2014/03/13/an_open_letter_to_winter.php">maniacs.</a> Our therapist says we&apos;ve made a lot of progress since <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506150016/http://gothamist.com/2014/02/18/more_snow_kill_them_all.php">we considered going on a snowman mass killing spree</a>, but we may have taken a major step back today when we saw <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506150016/http://nypost.com/2014/08/08/brace-yourself-for-another-polar-vortex-in-september/">this headline in the Post</a>: &quot;Brace yourself for another polar vortex &#x2014; in September.&quot;</p>

<p>Yes, Accuweather&apos;s lead long-range forecaster (well actually, they refer to him as &quot;AccuWeather Lead Long-Range Forecaster,&quot; ahem) Paul Pastelok <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506150016/http://www.accuweather.com/en/weather-news/fall-2014-forecast-polar-vortex/31254218">is predicting that</a> the polar vortex may make its return &quot;for short, sporadic periods in September&quot; in the Northeast, because God is dead and was replaced by Old Man Winter. &quot;The vortex could slip at times, maybe even briefly in September for the Northeast,&quot; Pastelok said. <strong>&quot;There could be a significant shot of chilly air that comes across the Great Lakes region and into the interior Northeast sometime in mid- to late-September.&quot;</strong> </p>

<p>This doesn&apos;t necessarily mean NYC will be affected, but it also doesn&apos;t necessarily mean we won&apos;t be drinking goblets of blood out of snowmen&apos;s skulls come late September. More importantly, of course: it&apos;s only August 9th, Pastelok is trying to predict weather patterns months ahead, and weather forecasting is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506150016/http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-are-weather-forecasts-often-wrong/">an imprecise</a> science at best (and a massive guess-how-many-jellybeans-are-in-the-jar game at worst), so take this all with a big grain of salt. </p>

<p>What we don&apos;t need to take with a grain of salt: this has been the coolest summer in the last decade. We&apos;ve only had four days over 90, and there&apos;s been no heat waves (which is defined as three consecutive days of temperatures over 90) this year. &quot;It wasn&#x2019;t clear if it was going to be a hot or a cool summer,&quot; National Weather Service meteorologist David Stark <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506150016/http://nypost.com/2014/08/08/summer-2014-is-coldest-in-a-decade/">told the Post.</a> &quot;We started out the year very cool and it seems like we just continued that. It doesn&#x2019;t look like we have any heat waves in the near future.&quot;</p>

<p>So we might not have that crisp burnt sienna tan we&apos;d like, but at least we&apos;ve <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506150016/http://gothamist.com/tags/heatwave">saved a bunch of money</a> on air conditioning&#x2014;even if some retail stores still <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506150016/http://gothamist.com/2014/08/08/retail_stores_wont_stop_killing_pol.php">haven&apos;t gotten with the program</a> on that count.</p>
