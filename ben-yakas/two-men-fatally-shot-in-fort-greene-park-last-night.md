<p>Two men were fatally shot, and a third was wounded, in a shooting in Fort Greene Park in Brooklyn last night. According to police, the shooting occurred just before 11:30 p.m. near the basketball courts around Myrtle Avenue and Saint Edwards Street. &quot;I sat down in the park for maybe a minute,&quot; witness Timothy White <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408101848/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/gunman-shoots-killing-victims-brooklyn-park-article-1.1423114">told the News</a>. &quot;There were about 50 kids hanging out. Then out of nowhere, someone started shooting ... [there was] no yelling or warning or anything.&quot;</p>

<p>White added that he heard at least nine shots: &quot;It was a big gun, high caliber. The whole crowd started running. I couldn&apos;t tell if the gunman was aiming at someone or shooting randomly.&quot; Jahmal Issac Page, 21, and Anthony Earl-Govon, 22, both sustained one gunshot wound to the head; they were pronounced dead at the scene. The News claims that a third man, whose name hasn&apos;t been released, was also reportedly shot. No arrests have been made yet.</p>
