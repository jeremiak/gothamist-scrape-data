<p>This has been a busy week for original Kanye West fanclub member <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021072217/http://gothamist.com/tags/kanyewest">Kanye West</a>, who rode his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021072217/http://gothamist.com/2016/09/07/kanye_west_msg_review_video.php">hoverboard spaceship into Madison Square Garden</a> for two concerts at the start of the week. Things got even more hectic on Wednesday as West unveiled his Yeezy Season 4 collection outdoors at the Franklin D. Roosevelt Four Freedoms Park on Roosevelt Island, then followed that up with an appearance at his label G.O.O.D. Music&#x2019;s pop-up event at the Highline Ballroom, where he performed a few songs and gave out pizza to lucky fans. </p>

<p>The highlight of the show was Teyana Taylor and Iman Shumpert recreating their starring role in Kanye&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021072217/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxGvm6btP1A">&quot;Fade&quot; video</a> live, thanks to some well-positioned workout equipment on stage. Check out some videos of that below.</p>

<p>While everyone seemed pretty pleased with the pop-up show, the Yeezy Season 4 event earlier in the day was more of a mixed bag, marred by long delays, the hot weather, and a seeming lack of care for the models on the part of organizers (not to mention an overabundance of nude body wear). </p>

<p>Even calling it a mixed bag is probably being generous: the Post called it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021072217/http://nypost.com/2016/09/07/kanyes-fashion-show-was-a-total-disaster/">a total disaster,</a> USA Today called it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021072217/http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/entertainthis/2016/09/07/kanye-west-season-4-fashion/89968096/">a hot mess</a>, Billboard also said it was a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021072217/http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/7502816/kanye-west-yeezy-4-fashion-week-show">hot mess</a>, Huffington Post said the show looked like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021072217/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/yeezy-models-fainting_us_57d15e24e4b03d2d4598890a">it was hell on earth</a>, Jezebel called it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021072217/http://themuse.jezebel.com/yeezy-season-4-disaster-overshadows-kanye-wests-live-sh-1786345854">a disaster</a>, and NY Magazine basically declared it a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021072217/http://nymag.com/thecut/2016/09/kanye-yeezy-season-4-models.html">war crime against the models involved.</a> Racked probably had the kindest view, calling it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021072217/http://www.racked.com/2016/9/8/12851236/yeezy-season-4-spanx">&quot;mostly just Spanx.&quot;</a></p>
