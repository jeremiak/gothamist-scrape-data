<p>With Manhattan Borough President <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160507201449/http://gothamist.com/tags/scottstringer">Scott Stringer</a> choosing to run for City Comptroller instead of mayor&#x2014;obviously so he can leave more time to help out <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160507201449/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/02/scarlett_johansson_looooooves_scott.php">concerned constituents like Scarlett Johansson</a>&#x2014;the field of candidates for the 2013 mayoral race is starting to take shape. And <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160507201449/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/26/nyregion/with-no-major-jewish-candidate-an-unusual-absence-in-the-nyc-mayors-race.html?partner=socialflow&amp;smid=tw-nytmetro&amp;_r=1&amp;">the NY Times noticed</a> a glaring omission among the current candidates: &quot;Where are the Jews?&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160507201449/http://gothamist.com/2012/11/19/scott_stringer_officially_drops_out.php">Between &quot;frontrunner&quot;</a> City Council Speaker Christine Quinn, Public Advocate Bill de Blasio, Comptroller John C. Liu, and former Comptroller Bill Thompson, there looks like there may be no Jewish mayoral candidates for the first time in decades. The last time no Jewish candidate of either party sought the nomination was in 1993, when incumbent David N. Dinkins lost to the future <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160507201449/http://gothamist.com/tags/rudygiuliani">Mayor Of 9/11 Town</a>. Sam Roberts notes that it feels somehow wrong, like a bagel and lox without a schmear:</p>

<blockquote>In the world of politics, the idea of a New York City mayor&#x2019;s race without a serious Jewish entrant is hard to fathom. It would be &#x201C;like the Upper West Side without Zabar&#x2019;s,&#x201D; said Robert Shrum, a longtime Democratic political strategist, or &#x201C;a rye bread without seeds,&#x201D; said Hank Sheinkopf, a Democratic political consultant.</blockquote>

<p>Or like a trite joke about Jews not involving food! There actually <em>is</em> a Jewish candidate for mayor: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160507201449/http://tomallonformayor.com/">Tom Allon.</a> But given his slim chance of winning, it seems that doesn&apos;t matter. </p>

<p>Prior to the sordid summer of 2011, a Jewish candidate was actually the favorite in this race: former US representative <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160507201449/http://gothamist.com/tags/anthonyweiner">Anthony Weiner.</a> Before he was caught sexting pictures of the mayor of his pants to ladies across the country, Weiner was thought to have 2013 wrapped up. But things could still turn around: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160507201449/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/16/more_talk_about_weiner_going_big_in.php">rumors heated</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160507201449/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/14/is_anthony_weiner_still_planning_to.php">up last summer</a> that Weiner might once again be considering a mayoral run (although 2017 seems more likely at this point).</p>
