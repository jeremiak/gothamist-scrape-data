<p>Yoko Ono is certainly sticking to her story: the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502151724/http://gothamist.com/tags/yokoono">interview-friendly</a> artist denied her culpability in the break up of the Beatles <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502151724/http://gothamist.com/2010/10/14/video_yoko_talks_beatles_breakup_wi.php">again</a> in an interview with British rag <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502151724/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/moslive/article-1341102/Johns-Lennon-Widow-Yoko-Ono-I-didnt-break-Beatles-My-small-hand-broken-men-up.html#ixzz19FpvuUHq">The Daily Mail</a> this weekend. If the glove doesn&apos;t fit, then Yoko is not the culprit: &quot;The Beatles were a group made up of four very complex men, and my small hand could not have broken these men up.&quot; </p>

<p>She also engages in a fun game of &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502151724/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/24/lennon_5.php">If John were still alive</a>...&quot;, with incredible hypothetical accuracy. She thinks <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502151724/http://gothamist.com/tags/johnlennon">Lennon</a> would have loved Lady Gaga and her &quot;very lovely bottom,&quot; as well as social networking: &quot;He&#x2019;d love the internet and Twitter. He&#x2019;d be sending out pronouncements and messages and giving his opinion all the time on everything. He would be 70 years old, but he&#x2019;d want to know everything that&#x2019;s going on.&quot; So John Lennon would be a crotchety old man?
