<p>If we have learned anything this week, it&apos;s that you should never set yourself on fire <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150409161925/http://gothamist.com/2014/08/22/teenagers_are_burning.php">just because the internet told you to do so.</a> But not everyone got the memo: two young adults were recently spotted on the subway giddily attempting to light each other on fire. But their clothing was never really in danger of being set aflame&#x2014;the only real sparks were in their hearts.</p>

<p>It is hard for many young people to channel their feelings and articulate them cogently when they <em>like-like</em> someone. What we are witnessing here could be viewed as irritating, juvenile and dangerous to other passengers&#x2014;or it could be the first fiery blush of young love. Just look at the way they fumble for excuses to brush against one another&apos;s hands!</p>

<p>For sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds, as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150409161925/http://www.shakespeares-sonnets.com/sonnet/94">that Bard of love once said</a>...so l&apos;chaim to these firestarters. Let&apos;s hope the flame of their attraction catches fire to the Corona Light t-shirts of their souls, and never is snuffed out.</p>
