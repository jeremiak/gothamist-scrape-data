<p>Earlier this year, Lady Gaga scrapped a planned music video for her duet with R Kelly, &quot;Do What U Want,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140621224125/http://www.mtv.com/news/1719881/lady-gaga-do-what-u-want-video-delay/">citing time constraints and blaming her manager.</a> But it seems the real reason the video wasn&apos;t released is because it is a nightmare vision of scumbags paradise as orchestrated by Terry Richardson, filled with unconscious women, Dr. R Kelly, and non-consensual bumpin&apos; and grindin&apos;. And <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140621224125/http://www.tmz.com/2014/06/19/lady-gaga-music-video-sexual-assault-do-what-u-want/">thanks to TMZ</a>, you can see a clip of it below!</p>

<p>From what we can make out from the clip and TMZ&apos;s description, the video starts with Gaga in a hospital bed about to undergo surgery at the hands of Dr. R Kelly. He reaches under the sheets, she moans, then he says, &quot;sounds like that medicine&apos;s starting to kick in,&quot; because it is 2014 and this is art. The Post adds <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140621224125/http://pagesix.com/2014/06/19/lady-gaga-scrapped-r-kelly-duet-video-after-controversies/">this lovely tidbit of dialogue</a>:</p>

<blockquote>Gaga asks Kelly, &#x201C;Will I ever be able to walk again?&#x201D; The singer replies, &#x201C;Yes, if you let me do whatever I want with your body.&#x201D; The not-so-good doctor then adds, &#x201C;I&#x2019;m putting you under, and when you wake up, you&#x2019;re going to be pregnant.&#x201D;</blockquote>

<p>So once Gaga falls asleep, the music begins and various nurses start writhing on top of her unconscious body, playing with her limbs like a marionette. That&apos;s interspersed with Richardson taking photos of naked Gaga as she&apos;s rolling around in newspapers humping the air. It&apos;s 2014 and art is alive.</p>

<p>Anyway, Lady Gaga is about as controversial as Charles Nelson Reilly at this point. We&apos;re happy that she (or someone in her entourage) had the foresight to not actively promote the work of two alleged sex predators in the context of creepy sexual situations. One source told the Post, &quot;Gaga had a video directed by an alleged sexual predator, starring another sexual predator. With the theme, &#x2018;I&#x2019;m going to do whatever I want with your body&#x2019;? It was literally an ad for rape.&quot;</p>

<p>Or as esteemed music critic Ann Powers eloquently stated:</p>

<p>But hey, at least we now know that after the show it&apos;s the after party, after the party it&apos;s the hotel lobby, then round about 4 you got to clear the lobby, and after the lobby it&apos;s a party on Lady Gaga&apos;s body. At this point, you might want to cleanse your palette with some adorable black-footed kittens:</p>
