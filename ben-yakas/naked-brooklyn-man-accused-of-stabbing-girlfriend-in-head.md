<p>A Brooklyn man has been accused of stabbing his girlfriend in the head, and then running into the street bloody and naked. Police say that Miguel Cordero, 38, attacked 32-year-old girlfriend Julissa Marquez around at 7:20 p.m. last night at the Sumner Houses in Bedford-Stuyvesant. Cordero allegedly stabbed her in the head, neck and stomach, then ran outside: &quot;He was completely naked, blood from head to toe,&quot; neighbor Matthew Fuller <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425175337/http://nypost.com/2013/12/10/man-runs-around-naked-covered-in-blood-after-hacking-girlfriend-police/">told the Post</a>. &quot;He was screaming, &apos;This is my building &#x2014; I&#x2019;m the devil&#x2019;s child!&apos;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Four cops went after him. He grabbed one by the neck. The cop grabbed his night stick and was beating him, but he still wouldn&apos;t go down,&quot; a neighbor <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425175337/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20131211/bed-stuy/woman-stabbed-head-by-her-boyfriend-police-say">told DNAInfo</a>. &quot;Then basically the whole precinct showed up,&quot; he added. &quot;There must&apos;ve been 100 cops. They grabbed his legs and took him down.&quot;</p>

<p>Marquez&apos;s 12-year-old son was in the apartment at the time of the incident. &#x201C;He said, &#x2018;Help me, I&#x2019;m scared. My mom is on the floor I think she&#x2019;s dead,&#x2019;&#x2009;&#x201D; neighbor Louis Navarette told the Post. &#x201C;There was blood everywhere. There were pieces of her head missing.&#x201D; Marquez was taken to Kings County Hospital where she is in stable condition; Cordero has been arrested and is awaiting charges.</p>
