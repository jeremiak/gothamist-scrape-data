<p>Are you sick of living in the outer boroughs? Are you tired of having enough floor space to do sit-ups (regardless of whether or not you ever have done one)? Do you like the idea of living in cramped quarters with 21 other people? Then we have the nightmare deal of a lifetime for you: a Midtown East condo that offers all the luxuries of a two-bedroom apartment spread out amongst 22 human beings! Take a tour of the expansive space below.</p>

<p>The apartment, located at 27th Street and 3rd Avenue, is filled with bunk beds, because nothing screams &quot;young professional&quot; like bunk beds. &quot;This is a brand new apartment,&quot; the tour guide/landlord says in the video. &quot;It&#x2019;s close to all the trains. Very conveniently located. You can walk to Union Square or Grand Central.&quot; And don&apos;t even get us started on the &quot;huge closet&quot; which is so huge, it may end up having a bathroom located inside of it.</p>

<p>Here&apos;s what he wrote <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426233406/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBTgFE8i6rE">as a listing</a>:</p>

<blockquote>These are SHARED rooms, not private rooms. I do not have private rooms available. 

<p>Everyone here gets along very well. All tenants are kind, friendly and clean. You will meet incredible people here.</p>

<p>Males and females are welcome. Males and females sleep in SEPARATE rooms. The average age is 22. People are serious here (students &amp; young professionals), this is not a place to party.</p>

<p>Apartments include:</p>

<p>- Laundry<br>
- Full kitchen<br>
- Apartments are fully furnished<br>
- Includes all utilities and wireless internet (Wifi)<br>
- Located in the best areas of Manhattan, less than 5 minute walk to all trains</p>

<p>The typical stay is 2-6 months, although shorter and longer stays are welcome (the minimum stay is 30 days).</p>

<p>Tenants must be clean, responsible and kind.</p>

<p>There is no alcohol, smoking, illicit drugs or drama allowed inside any apartments.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>On the plus side, kitchen utensils! On the negative side, no drama or partying.</p>

<p>Also on the negative side: there is a better than good chance this is completely illegal. According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426233406/http://tenant.net/Other_Laws/HMC/sub3/art4.html#27-2075">NYS housing law</a>:</p>

<blockquote>a. No dwelling unit shall be occupied by a greater number of persons than is permitted by this section.

<p>(1) Every person occupying an apartment in a Class A or Class B multiple dwelling or in a tenant-occupied apartment in a one- or two-family dwelling shall have a liveable area of not less than 80 square feet. The maximum number of persons who may occupy any such apartment shall be determined by dividing the total liveable floor area of the apartment by 80 square feet. For every two persons who may lawfully occupy an apartment, one child under four may also reside therein, except that a child under four is permitted in an apartment lawfully occupied by one person. No residual floor area of less than 80 square feet shall be counted in determining the maximum permitted occupancy for such apartment. The floor area of a kitchen or kitchenette shall be included in measuring the total liveable floor area of an apartment but the floor area for private halls foyers, bathrooms or water closets shall be excluded.</p>

<p>(2) A living room in a rooming unit may be occupied by not more than two persons if it has a minimum floor area not less than one hundred ten square feet in a rooming house, or 130 square feet in a single room occupancy.</p>

<p>b. The maximum number of persons who may occupy a dormitory shall not exceed the occupancy permitted under section 66 of the multiple dwelling law, and the regulations issued there under by the department.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>There is certainly not 80 sq ft here. But what if the owner submitted it as a &quot;multiple dwelling&quot; home with the Department of Housing and Preservation Development? It seems safe to guess that this is supposed to be some sort of &quot;hostel.&quot; </p>

<p>First, what is a &quot;Class B&quot; dwelling exactly?</p>

<blockquote>A &quot;Class &apos;B&apos;&quot; multiple dwelling is a multiple dwelling which is generally occupied transiently, as the temporary abode of individuals or families who are lodged with or without meals. Class &quot;B&quot; multiple dwellings include hotels, rooming houses, club houses, college and school dormitories, and dwellings designed as private dwellings but occupied by one or two families with five or more transient boarders, roomers, or lodgers in one household. </blockquote>

<p>Now, what does this <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426233406/http://tenant.net/Other_Laws/MDL/mdl03.html">mysterious section 66</a> have to say about this?</p>

<blockquote>
5.   The number of persons accommodated on any story in a lodging
     house shall not be greater than the sum of the following
     components.

<p>     a.   Twenty-two persons for each full multiple of twenty-two<br>
          inches in the smallest clear width of each means of<br>
          egress approved by the department, other than a fire-<br>
          escape.</p>

<p>     b.   Twenty persons for each lawful fire-escape accessible<br>
          from such story if it is above the entrance story.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>So perhaps this is why there are 22 beds in this apartment...even though we&apos;re still highly doubtful that this two bedroom apartment would encompass over 4,400 sq ft. Then again, we&apos;re starting to feel like we&apos;re taking the SATs sorting through this&#x2014;perhaps he chose the law that he knew nobody could understand because it&apos;s actually an evil math problem.</p>
