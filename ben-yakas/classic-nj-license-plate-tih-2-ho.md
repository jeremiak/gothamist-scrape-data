<p>The Daily What <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509002042/http://thedailywh.at/post/1048150670/vanity-plate-of-the-day-revelc-staht-won">directs us</a> to their vanity license plate of the day, from NJ. This intrepid license plate, whose message can only be unlocked in rear-view mirrors, eclipses such classic designs as &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509002042/http://www.r8pl8z.com/beer-me">BEER ME</a>,&quot; &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509002042/http://www.r8pl8z.com/chill-nn">CHILL NN</a>,&quot; and &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509002042/http://www.r8pl8z.com/2fat2fly">2FAT2FLY</a>.&quot; The plate was originally posted on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509002042/http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/d811b/oh_shit/">Reddit</a>, where a furious discussion still rages about car dealership etiquette. </p>

<p>Reddit user I3lindman posits a possible scientific explanation for the plate: &quot;I read it as Titanium Dihydrogen Hydroxide, but that doesnt make much sense as Titanium typically has a +4 oxidized state which would prevent is from bonding with Hydrogen. You could perhaps get the hydrogen to soak into Palladium or Platinum, similar to a fuel cell, but then license plate would read: &apos;OH SHdP&apos; or &apos;OH SHtP.&apos; Those just arent nearly as cool. Such is the classic struggle between science and humor.&quot;</p>
