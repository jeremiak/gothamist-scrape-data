<p>Make no mistake: author <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150328044123/http://gothamist.com/2010/12/13/author_fran_lebowitz_dismayed_at_al.php">Fran Lebowitz</a> despises Mayor Bloomberg. She passionately loves NYC, and she just as passionately hates Bloomberg. And her entry in this weekend&apos;s big <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150328044123/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/17/ny_times_gives_interactive_tour_sho.php">NY Times Bloomberg nostalgia fest</a> is the funniest, wittiest, and more incisive highlight. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150328044123/http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/08/18/nyregion/bloomberg-voices.html?smid=re-share">Go here to watch her</a> call him out as &quot;so essentially suburban,&quot; and psychoanalyze him based on his height.</p>

<p>There&apos;s a long excerpt from her talking about Bloomberg on the Times, but this is our favorite part:</p>

<blockquote>I think it&apos;s very important that we don&apos;t ever have a mayor this rich or this short. The richness comes from the shortness, this is what I believe. I believe every single person suffers for what happens to boys on playgrounds. So I really believe that a short boy gets bullied by taller boys, or ignored by them, or doesn&apos;t have the same status as they do, they grow up, they get very rich, to kind of get back at these tall boys, and then everyone suffers for this. I like de Blasio for many reasons, but his height is very important.</blockquote>

<p>This is as good as that time Lebowitz <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150328044123/http://observer.com/2012/07/fran-lebowitz-nyu-bloomberg-video-07202012/">railed against Bloomberg and NYU expansion</a>, noting: <strong>&#x201C;I said actually to Michael Bloomberg, &#x2018;I never thought I&#x2019;d have the chance to vote against you three times.&#x2019;&#x201D;</strong></p>
