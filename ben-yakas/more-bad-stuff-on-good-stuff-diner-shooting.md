The victim was Corey Scott, 28, who was shot several times in the back of the head after a heated argument with other customers. Police are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150806155504/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/10/23/man-is-shot-dead-in-manhattan-diner/?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">on the hunt</a> for the shooter, reviewing the surveillance footage which captured the attack in the all-night diner.<p></p>

<p>Scott was an ex-con with more than a few brushes with violence: in 2007 he was nearly stabbed to death at Fusion on West 28th street, after fighting with a patron at that club, according <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150806155504/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/one_dead_after_shooting_spree_in_lBueihao9Q69wtAUgfNstK">to the Post</a>. The Brooklyn man was also accused of robbing and beating to death Gene Hop, a 57-year-old father of four in 2004, and was charged with manslaughter (he was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150806155504/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/slay_thug_eats_lead_and_dies_N8mjScwPwCYtxNt9FE2bbO">acquitted</a> according to Hop&apos;s family). He was currently on parole for a robbery conviction. According <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150806155504/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/slay_thug_eats_lead_and_dies_N8mjScwPwCYtxNt9FE2bbO">to the Post</a>, Scott went by the name &quot;Young Classik,&quot; and has several videos <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150806155504/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdlqCxZCptM">on YouTube.</a></p>

<p>Many locals were blaming the late-night, rowdy crowd that siphoned out of local clubs for the aggressive reputation the diner is getting: &quot;I mean, this is a really hot, happening area near the Meatpacking District with a lot of people around, coming from a lot of the outer areas too,&quot; one customer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150806155504/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2010/10/23/gunman-on-loose-after-west-village-shooting/">told CBS</a>. Outside of the late night club crowd, Good Stuff is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150806155504/http://www.examiner.com/bisexual-in-national/bad-stuff-at-good-stuff-shooting-at-diner-popular-with-bi-community">popular</a> with many LGBT groups, thanks to a nearby LGBT Community Center less than two blocks away. Good Stuff was also the winner of Time Out Magazine&apos;s Best Manhattan Diner Award, as voted by readers in 2008.</p>
