<p>Here&apos;s a sobering reminder of why rubber dog booties weren&apos;t <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140424132019/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKLv-b3B00E">just created to amuse humans</a>: a small dog was electrocuted by a stray wire in front of her Lower East Side apartment. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140424132019/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/dog-dies-electrocuted-east-side-article-1.1616198">According to the News</a>, a 46-year-old woman was walking Bella, an 11-year-old pit bull terrier mix, around 4:30 p.m. Saturday on Clinton Street near Delancey Street when the electrocution occurred.</p>

<p>&quot;We were entering the building when Bella started acting funny,&#x201D; the dog&#x2019;s owner, who asked not to be named, told them. &quot;She let out a cry. She didn&#x2019;t seem to want to go into the building. Then she went into a spasm and just laid there.&quot; The dog died by the time they got her to a pet hospital on the Upper East Side. Con Ed later said frayed wiring from a scaffold light was to blame for the incident.</p>

<p>When it snows a lot, this sort of thing tends to happen, unfortunately: dogs have been electrocuted in similar circumstances in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140424132019/http://gothamist.com/2004/12/27/dog_electrocuted_in_chelsea.php">Chelsea</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140424132019/http://gothamist.com/2007/06/07/a_ny_post_repor.php">Harlem</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140424132019/http://gothamist.com/2005/12/12/dog_electrocute.php">Prospect Heights</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140424132019/http://gothamist.com/2007/02/15/terrier_in_deat.php">Battery Park</a>, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140424132019/http://gothamist.com/2006/02/16/dog_killed_by_s.php">Park Slope</a>. </p>
