<p>If you are feeling a swelling in your chestal glaven, don&apos;t worry: that&apos;s just the groin-grabbingly good news that finally, all 500+ episodes of <em>The Simpsons</em> will be available to stream online! FXX (the comedy wing of FX) has acquired both cable and streaming rights of the entire series; episodes will start airing in syndication next August, and will also be put online around the same time. This calls for a celebration.</p>

<p>In a press release announcing the news, FXX and 20th Century Fox agree that this &quot;is believed to be the biggest [syndication] deal ever&quot; for a TV show. FXX has bought at least 574 half-hours of the show (530 from the first 24 seasons, 44 from the current season, plus the already-ordered season 26) and have the rights to any future seasons as well. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509152000/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/16/business/media/simpsons-reruns-sold-to-fxx-in-first-cable-deal.html">According to the Times</a>, analysts estimated a purchase price of between $1 million and $2 million an episode, putting the overall value in the range of $550 million to $1 billion-plus.</p>

The details around their online streaming service, FXNOW, haven&apos;t been released yet, but they do have the right to stream all 24 seasons if they wanted to. </p>

<p>The news comes a day after FXX announced the cancellation of its flagship talk show, <em>Totally Biased with W. Kamau Bell</em>&#x2014;and after a slate of articles wondering <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509152000/http://www.forbes.com/sites/merrillbarr/2013/11/14/fxx-has-seen-its-first-causality-was-the-transition-worth-it/">what the hell</a> FXX <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509152000/http://www.hollywood.com/news/tv/55041809/fxx-problems-totally-biased-kamau-bell-canceled">thinks it&apos;s doing.</a> Nothing really shuts up your critics like holding up a photo of Shelbyville&apos;s beloved lemon tree and asking, &quot;How do you like them lemons?&quot; You can practically see the network strutting if you squint:</p>
