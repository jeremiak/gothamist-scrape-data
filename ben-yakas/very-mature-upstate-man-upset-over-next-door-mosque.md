<p>An upstate man who is unhappy about the mosque which recently moved next door has put a stenciled sign on his lawn reading, &quot;BOMB MAKING NEXT DRIVEWAY,&quot; and he adamantly refuses to take it down. Amherst resident Michael Heick <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429011351/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/2011/05/11/2011-05-11_upstate_new_york_man_says_sign_pointing_to_mosque_stating_bomb_making_next_drive.html">says he has</a> been frustrated with how the town officials have handled his concerns about the Jaffarya Islamic Center of Niagara Frontier, which opened in November. &quot;It does not say what driveway. It doesn&apos;t say at the mosque.<strong> I have issues with the mosque. The sign is not directed at anybody. If they feel it&apos;s at them, that&apos;s how they feel</strong>,&quot; Heick said.</p>

<p>Heick explained why he put the sign up to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429011351/http://www.buffalonews.com/city/communities/amherst/article418403.ece">the Buffalo News</a>, from his front porch: &quot;The place is too close. I don&apos;t care what people think. It doesn&apos;t matter what people think. This is a way to get answers now. I get none from the town. The intent was to catch the eye of the people who I have a problem with.&quot; Many people in town find the sign in poor taste: &quot;I would really think it&apos;s an incitement of hatred against Muslims. Law enforcement should take it very seriously. Tomorrow, somebody could say, &apos;Oh, they have weapons&apos; - and people believe it,&quot; said mosque board of trustees member Syed Jaffri. </p>

<p>But local authorities couldn&apos;t order him to take it down, because the message is protected by the First Amendment. &quot;They said there&apos;s nothing in the law that we can do anything about this sign,&quot; said Mubarak Abidi, the mosque&apos;s president. Heick says that the bright lights from the mosque encroach upon his yard and violate town code, and he&apos;s demanded that the mosque put up a 6-foot-tall fence along his property line, which they say is too costly to do. </p>

<p>Other neighbors have responded with more positive messages: a new handmade sign, reading &quot;Smiles Made Next Driveway,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429011351/http://www.buffalonews.com/city/communities/amherst/article420117.ece">went up</a> yesterday on the property of dentist John N. Athans, who lives across from the mosque. &quot;Our thought was the other sign was pretty drastic, pretty serious, pretty mean. I thought this was a good way to lighten the tension,&quot; Athans said. </p>

<p>But thankfully, it seems the dispute may have been resolved today, before it escalated anymore: The Buffalo News <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429011351/http://www.buffalonews.com/city/communities/amherst/article420117.ece">reports</a> that the original sign has now been taken down willingly by Heick. We&apos;re sure glad, since we&apos;re pretty sure somebody was going to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429011351/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_Bad_Neighbors">release locusts next.</a></p>
