<p>Yesterday, it was reported that the SUV driver who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130918044611/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/12/five_schoolkids_in_serious_conditio.php">plowed into five teenagers</a> on a Queens sidewalk on Thursday morning <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130918044611/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/13/no_charges_for_running_over_schoolk.php">had not been charged</a> with any crime nor issued any summonses. Police initially determined that there was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130918044611/http://www.streetsblog.org/2013/09/13/cis-investigating-crash-that-maimed-three-kids-so-far-richard-brown-is-not/">&quot;no criminality suspected&quot;</a> in the incident involving driver Francis-Aung Lu. But the case is still being investigated by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130918044611/http://gothamist.com/tags/cis">CIS</a>, and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130918044611/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/teen-crash-driver-face-raps-article-1.1455743">Daily News now hints that Lu may be charged after all. </a></p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130918044611/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/teen-crash-driver-face-raps-article-1.1455743">

NYPD couldn&apos;t offer any other details about the investigation other than to say it is in the hands of CIS.</p>

<p>One of the victims, 13-year-old Angie Pena, remains in critical condition with several broken bones at Columbia-Presbyterian Hospital in Manhattan. &#x201C;The father is going crazy &#x2014; all he does is cry, cry, cry,&#x201D; family friend Rosa Sarmiento <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130918044611/http://nypost.com/2013/09/13/teen-girl-hit-by-suv-still-in-intensive-care/">told the Post</a>. Angie&apos;s two friends who had been walking with her, 14-year-old Marina Abadir and 13-year-old Ashley Khan, are both listed in stable condition at Elmhurst Hospital Center with fractures and other injuries. </p>
