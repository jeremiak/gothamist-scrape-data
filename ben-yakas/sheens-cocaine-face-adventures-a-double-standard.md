<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="103010sheen.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412163458im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/103010sheen.jpg" width="240" height="120" class="image-left"> </span>The Charlie Sheen <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412163458/http://gothamist.com/tags/charliesheen">frothing saga</a> just can&apos;t stop, won&apos;t stop providing the gory, decadent details. Sheen was actually lucky that his coke-and-prostitute filled bender ended inside the relative confines of the Eloise Suite, since the night almost came to an abrupt end in the bathroom of the fancy Daniel restaurant. Some innocent diner could have easily walked in on Sheen in coke facepaint with his pants around his ankles, after his special lady friend refused to have sex with him in the bathroom. &#x201C;When the assistant opened the door, <strong>there was Charlie standing there naked with cocaine all over his face! He was delusional and just completely lost</strong>. Totally out of it,&#x201D; a source <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412163458/http://www.radaronline.com/exclusives/2010/10/exclusive-new-details-charlie-sheen-was-found-naked-doing-cocaine-restaurant">told RadarOnline</a>.</p>

<p>But you know who has really been neglected, and hurt, in the wake of Sheen&apos;s meltdown? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412163458/http://gothamist.com/tags/lindsaylohan">Lindsay Lohan</a>. Because this has to do with her, too! Producer Richard O&apos;Sullivan thinks it&apos;s unfair that Sheen gets treated with a &quot;boys will be boys&quot; attitude, while Lohan is public enemy #1, and unable to get insured for movies. If &quot;Lindsay Lohan pulled half the stunts Charlie Sheen does, half the country would be clamoring to burn that poor girl at the stake!&quot; Sullivan <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412163458/http://www.radaronline.com/exclusives/2010/10/lindsay-lohan-victim-double-standard-says-producer-who-compares-her-charlie-sheen">told RadarOnline</a>. But has Lohan contributed any art on the level of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412163458/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_Shots!_Part_Deux">Hot Shots!
