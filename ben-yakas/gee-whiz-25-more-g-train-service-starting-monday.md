										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="072213gtrain.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20140612010456im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_lauren/072213gtrain.jpg" width="640" height="480"> <br> <i> Soon, you will be greeted with this sight every 8 minutes during rush hour. </i></div> <p></p>

<p>Straphangers have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140612010456/http://gothamist.com/2014/03/21/no_g_trains_fml.php">moaned</a> and lawmakers have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140612010456/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/18/lawmakers_reduced_to_begging_mta_fo.php">pleaded</a>, but improved service along the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140612010456/http://gothamist.com/tags/gtrain">G train</a> has remained <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140612010456/http://gothamist.com/2014/06/03/video_new_yorkers_missing_the_g_tra.php">frustratingly out of reach</a>. Until now! The MTA announced today that there will be a 25% increase in G train service during weekday afternoons and rush hour. Which means there&apos;ll be 25% less Enigma as well.</p>

<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="//web.archive.org/web/20140612010456if_/http://www.youtube.com/embed/iXev83hlJbk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>According to a press release, trains will operate every eight minutes instead of every 10 minutes between the weekday hours of 3 p.m. and 9 p.m.: &quot;This added service will address increased ridership and demand along a growing corridor between Brooklyn and Queens.&quot; Sure, this doesn&apos;t change the fact that the G train won&apos;t run between Nassau Ave. and Court Square <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140612010456/http://gothamist.com/2014/03/21/no_g_trains_fml.php">for five weeks</a> beginning July 28th, but Rome wasn&apos;t built in a day, and also, Rome didn&apos;t have to contend with major repair work after Hurricane Sandy. They <em>did</em> have the plague though, so we maybe have it a little better.</p>

<p>But wait, there&apos;s more: not <em>only</em> will you be getting one extra train an hour during all the weekdays hours that the G train is still running&#x2014;the MTA is also adding P.A. systems to the 12 stations on the line currently without them! And they&apos;re ending &quot;the G train sprint&quot; by making sure the shorter 4-car trains stop at the same point on the platform every time. </p>

<p>In other words, finally some good news for G train users. Probably not enough <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140612010456/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/29/the_g_train_sucks_and_other_dating.php">to win back our ex</a>, but it&apos;s a start.</p>
