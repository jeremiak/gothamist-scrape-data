<p>Last week, a Brooklyn musician lost his eye after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130721082235/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/17/brooklyn_musician_loses_eye_in_vici.php">he was attacked by a hammer-wielding maniac</a> in Bed-Stuy. Dru Barnes, a member of the band <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130721082235/https://www.facebook.com/JOGYO">Jogyo</a>, was walking home around 10 a.m. last Thursday when a man with a hammer came from behind and attacked him, striking him several times in the head. You can see video of the suspect below.</p>

<p>Barnes, who had gotten lost while walking home that morning, had the optic nerve in his left eye completely severed. His friend Gerrit Vooren has set up <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130721082235/https://www.facebook.com/DruBarnesHealingPage">a Facebook page</a> to bring attention to the attack and help pay for the costs of the multiple surgeries Barnes has ahead of him. &#x201C;I spoke to him and he said, &#x2018;You know what, I&#x2019;m going to make sense of this, I&#x2019;m going to make this right, I&#x2019;m going to make this work for my life. I&#x2019;m going to make this a good thing versus a bad thing,&#x201D; Vooren <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130721082235/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2013/07/18/police-release-sketch-video-of-suspect-in-brooklyn-hammer-attack/">told CBS.</a></p>
