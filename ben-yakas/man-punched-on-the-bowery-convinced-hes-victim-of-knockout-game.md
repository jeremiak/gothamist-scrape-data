<p>A man was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429153913/http://gothamist.com/2014/03/06/knockout_les.php">punched in the face out of the blue</a> and knocked unconscious on the Lower East Side early Sunday morning. Victim Kyle Rogers, 23, suffered facial lacerations and a broken jaw, which had to be wired shut. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429153913/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2014/03/06/police-release-surveillance-video-of-bowery-assault/">He told CBS</a> that he&apos;s convinced he&apos;s the latest victim of the so-called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429153913/http://gothamist.com/tags/knockout">&quot;knockout&quot; game</a>. &quot;I [was] defenseless,&quot; he said of the attack, which you can see in the surveillance video below. &quot;It&#x2019;s one thing if he was looking me in the face, like squaring up, but, come on, from behind? It&#x2019;s like a coward move.&quot;</p>

<p>Rogers had left his friends at Sweet &amp; Vicious bar on Spring Street and was walking north on the Bowery when the attack occurred just before 2:30 a.m. Sunday. &quot;I guess when I fell and hit the ground, I split this open, my eyebrow, and my chin from the punch,&quot; he said of his injuries. Police describe the suspect as a black man in his 20s. &quot;You shouldn&apos;t have that fear always in the back of your head, &apos;oh someone&apos;s going to come out nowhere and punch me,&apos;&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429153913/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local/new_york&amp;id=9457153">he told ABC.</a></p>

<p>&quot;I just want these kids to stop,&quot; Kyle&#x2019;s father, Michael Rogers, told CBS. &quot;I want them to understand that it&#x2019;s not a game. That&#x2019;s the whole thing. They call it a game, and it&#x2019;s not a game. People get hurt real bad.&quot; Anyone with information is asked to call Crime Stoppers at (800) 577-TIPS (8477).
