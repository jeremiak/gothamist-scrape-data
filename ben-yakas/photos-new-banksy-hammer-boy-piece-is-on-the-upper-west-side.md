Yesterday, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510022757/http://gothamist.com/tags/banksy">Banksy</a> put up some <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510022757/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/19/video_newest_banksy_is_involves_bug.php#photo-1">vaginal ant art somewhere on Staten Island</a>&#x2014;which no one has found yet as far as we know. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510022757/http://banksy.co.uk/2013/10/20/upper-west-side">Today&apos;s &quot;Hammer Boy&quot; piece</a>, which is somewhere on the Upper West Side, is equally mysterious (and there&apos;s no text accompanying the picture). </p>

<p>But there&apos;s already chatter that it&apos;s at W 79th Street between Amsterdam and Broadway&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510022757/https://maps.google.com/maps?q=broadway+%26+79th+ny&amp;ll=40.783677,-73.979573&amp;spn=0.004241,0.00765&amp;sll=40.783811,-73.979899&amp;layer=c&amp;cbp=13,19.55,,1,10.64&amp;cbll=40.783634,-73.979479&amp;hnear=Broadway+%26+W+79th+St,+New+York,+10024&amp;t=h&amp;z=17&amp;panoid=w3Leqo2Almi4v0f1tWlGfg">which is a DSW.</a></p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: As you can see from the photos above, that is exactly where the latest piece is. Go check it out while it&apos;s still there!</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: According to witnesses, there was an attempted defacing of the piece (by the person in photo 6)&#x2014;but it was stopped by the crowd. &quot;Some kid tried to spray paint over it and some big dude tackled them,&quot; said Justin Ciambra. &quot;Big brawl sparking many arguments about the &apos;rules&apos; of the game. The guy got away.&quot; You can see video of the aftermath below.</p>
