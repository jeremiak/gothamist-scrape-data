<p>It&apos;s our favorite annual biking event that still <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811123401/http://gothamist.com/2009/03/30/red_hook_no-brake_bike_race_ends_wi.php">involves brakes</a>&#x2014;this afternoon is the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811123401/http://gothamist.com/tags/worldnakedbikeride">World Naked Bike Ride</a>! The weather may be a bit weepy today, but we don&apos;t expect that will get in the way of a fun frolic, either in your pasties or your birthday suit. Just be careful if you are so bold as to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811123401/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/11/cop_allegedly_threatened_to_ticket.php">wear a skirt</a>!</p>

<p>The event <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811123401/http://wiki.worldnakedbikeride.org/index.php?title=New_York_City">will get underway</a> with body painting at 3 p.m. at East River Park in Manhattan at Delancey Street, just south of Williamsburg bridge. Participants will gather at 5 p.m., and the ride will officially depart at 6 p.m. They are riding rain or shine; it&apos;s supposed to be warm out, but rain is supposed to be sporadic, so be prepared for that. They confirmed with an NYPD spokesman that it is legal for both men and women to be completely topless, but add, &quot;participants who go bottom-less do so at their own risk. Nobody has been detained or ticketed for this in the previous two years of WNBR NYC.&quot;</p>

<p>The route will only be revealed to participants, but you can follow along <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811123401/https://twitter.com/#!/wnbrnyc">on their Twitter</a>. If you go and take any photos, don&apos;t forget to send them to tips@gothamist.com, or tag them as &quot;Gothamist&quot; on Flickr. </p>
