<p>Based on recent music videos like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140324004950/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8qE6WQmNus">&quot;Must Be Santa,&quot;</a> there&apos;s no doubt that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140324004950/http://gothamist.com/tags/bobdylan">Bob Dylan&apos;s</a> sense of humor is as sharp as ever&#x2014;but it seems he isn&apos;t very fond of the new breed of romantic-comedies. Today, Dylan released the music video for the jaunty, <em>Love And Theft</em>-esque &quot;Duquesne Whistle,&quot; the first single from his forthcoming album <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140324004950/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/28/new_bob_dylan_album_done_rumored_to.php"><em>Tempest</em></a>. As for the video: picture Joseph Gordon-Levitt&apos;s character from <em>500 Days Of Summer</em> getting beaten for dancing in the street as he stalked a Manic Pixie Dream Girl, and you&apos;ve got the right idea.</p>

<p>Of course, as entertaining as the main storyline is, the best images of the video come from seeing Dylan and his bizarre gang strolling down the street. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140324004950/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/videos/bob-dylan-debuts-shockingly-violent-new-video-20120829">Rolling Stone thinks</a> one of his posse is meant to be &quot;dressed up as Gene Simmons circa 1977.&quot; So there&apos;s that. </p>

<p><em>Tempest</em>, Dylan&apos;s 35th studio album, will be released on September 11th. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140324004950/http://www.billboard.com/news/first-listen-bob-dylan-s-dark-tempest-1007729952.story#/news/first-listen-bob-dylan-s-dark-tempest-1007729952.story">Early reviews</a> of the album have been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140324004950/http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/musicblog/2012/aug/06/bob-dylan-tempest-first-listen">very positive</a>, with many calling it his best since <em>Time Out Of Mind</em>&#x2014;between the 14 minutes-long songs about the Titanic, odes to John Lennon, and lots of references <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140324004950/http://www.mojo4music.com/blog/2012/08/bob_dylans_tempest_first_liste.html">to blood and death</a>, we&apos;re significantly excited. And there&apos;s also this line from &quot;Narrow Way:&quot; &quot;I&apos;m still hurting from an arrow that pierced my chest/I&apos;m gonna have to take my head and bury it between your breasts.&quot;</p>

<p>If you can&apos;t wait to get your paws on a copy of the new album, Dylan also announced that a few select <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140324004950/http://www.examiner.com/article/dylan-tempest-promotion-signed-cds-new-video-pop-up-stores-album-streamed"><em>Tempest</em> pop up stores</a> will be open from 4 p.m. to 8 p.m. on Monday September 10th (and will remain open from 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. through September 16th)&#x2014;in addition to the new album, other Dylan releases and exclusive merchandise commemorating the week-long events, including a limited quantity of CDs hand-signed by Dylan, will be available.

<p>Listen to another new song from the album, the historically-questionable but hilarious 12-bar blues &quot;Early Roman Kings,&quot; below:</p>
