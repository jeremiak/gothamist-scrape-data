The difference between a good and great <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430043134/http://gothamist.com/tags/saturdaynightlive"><em>Saturday Night Live</em></a> host really has nothing to do with the talent of said host&#x2014;acting novice <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430043134/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/21/videos_saturday_night_live_welcomes.php">Bruno Mars</a> was <em>way</em> better on SNL than capital-A Actors <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430043134/http://gothamist.com/2012/11/18/videos_snl_mocks_the_petraeus_scand.php#photo-1">Jeremy Renner</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430043134/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/07/videos_snl_skewers_the_presidential.php#photo-1">Daniel Craig</a>. It&apos;s all about how comfortable the host is on that stage&#x2014;and Justin Timberlake kicked the kickball right out of the kickball field last night as host and musical guest in an episode chockfull of all-star SNL alums, Elton John impressions, the Three Amigos, Stefon, and a whole lot of funny singing. </p>

<p>Oh sure, this season has been filled with stinkers (Renner, Craig, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430043134/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/10/videos_justin_bieber_and_his_belieb.php#photo-1">Justin Bieber</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430043134/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/27/videos_saturday_night_live_welcomes_2.php#photo-1">Adam Levine</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430043134/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/20/videos_saturday_night_live_returns.php#photo-1">Jennifer Lawrence</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430043134/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/14/videos_saturday_night_live.php#photo-1">Christina Applegate</a>), so the bar might be slightly lower than...usual? Ever? But we laughed out loud several times last night, we enjoyed the returning sketches, and Stefon did a Daffy Duck/Vietnam flashback impression. We should all feel okay deeming this the best SNL episode of the year, despite the fanfare of guest stars and reliance on old bits. Anyway, we&apos;ll take &quot;Maine Justice&quot; and &quot;Dick In A Box Guys&quot; over &quot;The Californians&quot; any day. </p>

<p>Really, there was only one out-and-out stinker: the fake movie trailer for &quot;She&apos;s Got A Dick,&quot; which was devoid of laughs (actually, Fred Armisen as Eugene Levy was a funny sight gag). The &quot;Caligula&quot; sketch also went nowhere, but it wasn&apos;t atrocious (unlike the fake movie one, which really was horrible). </p>

<p>But the highlights were plentiful this week, best of all the return of Stefon (first appearance since <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430043134/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/21/videos_saturday_night_live_welcomes.php">the Bruno Mars episode</a>) who killed it in one of his best Weekend Update bits ever (which is saying something). Timberlake was excellent in the cold open as Elton John singing a tribute to Hugo Chavez, as one half of the &quot;Dick in a Box&quot; brothers for the dating show (also featuring the surprise return of the Festrunk brothers), and as the singing Vegan guy. </p>

<p>We had reprises of the two of the best (if not <em>the</em> best) new sketches of the season, the cajun-flavored &quot;Maine Justice&quot; and highly bizarre &quot;Swarovski Diamonds&quot; (both from the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430043134/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/09/videos_saturday_night_live_1.php#photo-1">underrated Jamie Foxx episode</a>), and we had Tom Hanks, Steve Martin, Dan Akroyd, Alec Baldwin and more during &quot;The Five Timers Club&quot; monologue bit. Click through for all those sketches, plus &quot;NuvaBling&quot; and musical performances from Timberlake.</p>
