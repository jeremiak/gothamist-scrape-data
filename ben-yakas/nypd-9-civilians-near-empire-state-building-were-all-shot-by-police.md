<p>Police Commissioner Ray Kelly told reporters today that cops inadvertently wounded nine people yesterday after a disgruntled ex-employee <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150520234432/http://gothamist.com/2012/08/24/five_shot_outside_empire_state_buil.php#photo-5">killed his former boss near the Empire State Building</a>. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150520234432/http://www.cnn.com/2012/08/24/justice/new-york-empire-state/index.html">Kelly said</a> the bystanders were not hit directly by police, but rather the officers&apos; struck &quot;flowerpots and other objects around, so ... their bullets fragmented and, in essence, that&apos;s what caused the wounds.&quot; Altogether, the two officers who confronted <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150520234432/http://gothamist.com/2012/08/25/esb_shooter_jeffrey_johnson_describ.php">Jeffrey Johnson</a> fired 16 rounds&#x2014;one officer shot nine while another one shot seven.</p>

<p>Investigators believe at least 7 of those 16 rounds struck the gunman, according to NYPD Spokesman Paul Browne. Browne stressed that the officers were justified in using deadly force though: &#x201C;They were approaching this man with a gun, and he turns on them, and he is eight feet away, pointing a gun right at them.&#x201D; You can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150520234432/http://gothamist.com/2012/08/24/video_police_shoot_midtown_shooting.php">see surveillance video</a> of the two officers confronting and shooting Johnson below.</p>

<p>Besides Johnson and victim Steve Ercolino, who were both killed, seven men and two women, including a Bronx mom and a North Carolina yoga instructor, were wounded on Friday&#x2014;six of them were taken to Bellevue Hospital and three to New York Cornell Presbyterian with non-life threatening injuries. </p>

<p>Erica Solar, the 30-year-old Bronx mother of two, didn&apos;t realize she was shot until she felt a searing pain in her right leg: &#x201C;She heard the shots,&#x201D; her brother, Louis Lleras, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150520234432/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/a-day-empire-state-building-bystanders-shot-article-1.1144280">told the News</a>. &#x201C;She didn&#x2019;t know she was shot. It was crazy.&#x201D; Media Rosario, from Queens, also didn&apos;t realize at first: &#x201C;Everything happened so fast,&#x201D; her sister-in-law, Auselis Rosario, told them. &#x201C;The bullet went through her leg. She was crying to me.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Robert Asika, 23, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150520234432/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/25/nyregion/police-decision-to-shoot-in-midtown-left-9-wounded.html?_r=1&amp;partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;pagewanted=all">told the Times</a> he was one of those people grazed by the bullets: &#x201C;One of the cops shot me in my arm,&#x201D; he said outside Bellevue Hospital Center, noting the gunman was moving toward him, and suggesting the officers &#x201C;shot me probably trying to shoot him.&#x201D; He said he wasn&apos;t mad at police: &#x201C;I get they were doing their job, but they have to be a little more careful when they are aiming the gun at the suspect and not hit the innocent victims,&#x201D; he said.</p>

<p>But Asika took on a harsher tone <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150520234432/http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/aug/24/empire-state-building-shooting-nypd-response?CMP=twt_gu">in an interview with the Guardian UK</a>, accusing those cops of &quot;shooting randomly&quot;, and hitting at least two other people: &quot;If you&apos;re gonna aim try and aim perfectly. If you wanna aim at the target, you got to know what you&apos;re doing because it&apos;s the street,&quot; Asika said. &quot;I could have been dead right now. I could have been dead.&quot;</p>

<p>Dr. David Klinger, a former Los Angeles police officer and current criminology professor at the University of Missouri-St. Louis who has interviewed hundreds of police officers involved in shootings, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150520234432/http://www.buzzfeed.com/joeflood/why-police-shot-civilians-at-the-empire-state-buil-7700">told Buzzfeed that</a> &#x201C;no matter how realistic their training is, it can never prepare an officer for a shooting...There are professionals I work with who you would see that they&apos;re going to be able to stop a threat, will shoot the right number of bullets, and keep civilians as safe as possible,&#x201D; says Klinger. &#x201C;But unless this is something you train for on a daily or weekly basis, it&apos;s not something you can be truly prepared for.&#x201D;</p>
