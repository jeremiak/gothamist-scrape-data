<p>At least four people <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110621082013/http://online.wsj.com/article/AP83e728e3f0bb4e9690a004d91d16ab0a.html">were fatally shot</a> in a pharmacy in Long Island earlier today. The shooting occurred inside Haven Drugs in Medford around 10 a.m. this morning. Authorities are still trying to piece together the details behind the quadruple homicide, but warned that the killer escaped the scene and is still at large. &quot;This is a vicious, horrible crime. We are dedicating a great number of resources. Right now, our primary interest is apprehending the individual or individuals involved,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110621082013/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/at_least_dead_in_li_drugstore_shooting_dXhhbxZFDWu49fQ0BINDXM">said</a> Suffolk County Chief of Detectives Dominick Varrone.</p>

<p>According to Varrone, the victims were two employees and two customers. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110621082013/http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=137284962">Police believe</a> there was a single shooter, and suggested that the motive may have been robbery, but they don&apos;t yet know how the shooting unfolded, and why.</p>

<p>Locals <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110621082013/http://www.newsday.com/long-island/crime/sources-four-shot-and-killed-in-medford-1.2968479">told Newsday</a> they couldn&apos;t believe the shooting happened in their town: &quot;I&apos;m shocked. I&apos;m actually speechless. I would have never thought something like that would happen here. I&apos;m just totally shocked,&quot; said a visibly aghast Pat Mastandrea.</p>
