										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="4710bad.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150107045855im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/4710bad.jpg" width="215" height="143" class="image-left"> </span>Twenty-two people <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150107045855/http://www.newsday.com/long-island/quaalude-ring-busted-after-3-year-investigation-1.1850753?qr=1&amp;p=">were arrested</a> Tuesday night as part of a massive $3.5 million quaaludes manufacturing and distributing ring, stretching from California to NYC. Twenty of those arrested as part of the three-year probe, dubbed &quot;Operation Lude Behavior&quot; (seriously), are expected to be arraigned today in Manhattan federal court. Among them are two current city public school teachers and a retired one. </p>

<p>Last year, there were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150107045855/http://gothamist.com/2009/07/19/latest_nightclub_drug_wars_reveal_r.php">reports</a> about a resurgence of ludes, a designer drug that has a sedative/hypnotic effect on the user. The alleged ringleader of the conspiracy, Dennis Fairley, 65, is a chemist who owns chemical testing laboratories in Brooklyn and Emeryville, Ca., where officials say he&apos;s been manufacturing hundreds of thousands of ludes a year. Much of the conspiracy was allegedly run out of Fairley&apos;s $1.4 million 5th avenue apartment.</p>

<p>Manhattan US Attorney Preet Bharara <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150107045855/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/nearly_two_dozen_people_busted_for_3Wj4GGeneIbEfkVyUgGFuL">told reporters</a>, &quot;Instead of applying his training as a chemist to advance science, he allegedly used it to concoct dangerous poisons and advance his personal wealth.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150107045855/http://gothamist.com/tags/laworder">Law and Order</a> might have a hard time ripping this story from the headlines, considering there&apos;s already an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150107045855/http://www.amctv.com/originals/breakingbad/">amazing show</a> on TV about a public school teacher who uses his knowledge of chemistry to make drugs (sometimes sans pants).</p>
