<p>People transport their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429120635/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/09/photo_dont_take_up_subway_seats_wit.php">antique tables</a>, their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429120635/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/30/sure_why_not_use_the_l_train_to_tra.php">unwrapped mattresses</a>, their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429120635/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/11/photo_this_couch_was_put_on_the_sub.php">couches</a> and even their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429120635/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/30/photo_bros_bring_patio_furniture_on.php">patio furniture</a> on the subway. So sure, why not haul a washing machine aboard while you&apos;re at it. In fact, why don&apos;t we all just start pinning our clothes to dry <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429120635/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/25/subway_etiquette_hanging_things_fro.php">on the handrails</a>?  </p>

Hoisting a washing machine over your head outside of Thurston Moore&apos;s apartment is probably more sweet than it is creepy, right?</p>
