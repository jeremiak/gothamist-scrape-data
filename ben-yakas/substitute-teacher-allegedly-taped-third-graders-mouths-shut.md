<p>Everyone is going to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426151957/http://gothamist.com/2010/08/18/parents_mad_cafe_wont_put_up_with_t.php">lose patience</a> with kids at some point or another&#x2014;that in and of itself is not remarkable. It&apos;s how adults <em>deal</em> with the stress of rambunctious wee little bairns that is the rub. One substitute teacher at a NJ elementary school apparently chose the wrong way by allegedly taping her third grade students&apos; mouths closed.</p>

<p>Winfield Scott Elementary School student Angelique Correa Henderson <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426151957/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Winfield-Scott-Substitute-Teacher-Tapes-Students-Mouth-Shut-Quiet-Game-Elizabeth-NJ-262044691.html">told NBC that</a> the teacher, whose name hasn&apos;t been released, placed decorative tape over the mouths of five students during a &quot;quiet game&quot; after lunch &quot;because we were jabbering too much.&quot;  &quot;She said that if we kept on talking she would rip it off of our mouths,&quot; Angelique <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426151957/http://7online.com/news/girl-says-teacher-taped-her-mouth-shut-for-talking-in-class/96500/">told ABC.</a> &quot;My heart kept on beating fast really fast. I felt really scared.&quot;</p>

<p>Angelique adds that the teacher took the tape off after about 15 minutes, and &quot;everybody kept on laughing at us.&quot; School officials say the teacher has been taken off the list of substitutes for consideration at the school. Police and state officials are investigating the incident, and parents want to make sure this can&apos;t happen again: &quot;She does not need to be teaching and being around kids if she can&apos;t control her emotions and the way she presents herself around kids,&quot; said Angelique&apos;s father, Munford Henderson.</p>
