A woman lost part of her leg today after she was struck by a cement truck driver while crossing the street on the Upper East Side. According to police, the incident happened around 10 a.m. near the intersection of 2nd Avenue and E. 68th Street. The 63-year-old woman, whose name hasn&apos;t been released, was struck by the cement truck as it made a right turn from 68th Street onto 2nd Avenue. </p>

<p>Cops added that she was not walking in the crosswalk at the time of the incident, though <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140221070719/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/traffic-accidents-injure-pedestrians-kill-article-1.1583848">the News disputes that</a>, saying she was in the crosswalk and had the walk light. The woman was taken to Bellevue Hospital in stable condition; her right leg below her knee was severed. The driver remained at the scene after being flagged down by witnesses; he reportedly didn&apos;t realize he had struck her, and dragged her down the block. CIS is currently investigating the incident, and no charges have been filed.</p>

<p>In a separate incident, a 67-year-old woman was struck while crossing the street at Grand Avenue and 69th Place in Queens around 11:20 a.m. today. Police say she was crossing Grand Avenue when she was struck by a 28-year-old driver as he turned left onto Grand from 69th. The woman was taken to Elmhurst Hospital in serious condition, but is expected to survive; the driver remained at the scene and was taken into custody. CIS is investigating, and no charges have been filed yet.</p>

<p>And in a third incident, a man was fatally struck in Queens by a driver in a northbound Ford Expedition on the Cross Island Parkway near the Grand Central Parkway around 6:50 a.m. That victim, whose name hasn&apos;t been released yet, was taken to North Shore University Hospital, where he died. The 69-year-old driver remained at the scene; the investigation is ongoing.</p>
