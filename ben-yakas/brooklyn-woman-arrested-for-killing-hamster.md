(<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503151811/http://www.flickr.com/photos/victoriabelanger/4268298696/">victoria belanger&apos;s flickr</a>)</i></div> Though the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503151811/http://www.aspca.org/">ASPCA</a> deals with pet abuse issues, much of their focus ends up being solely on animals like dogs and cats. But other pets need someone to look out for them as well: To that end, a Brooklyn woman has been arrested and charged with killing a hamster.<p></p>

<p>ASPCA special agents <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503151811/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local/new_york&amp;id=8003283">arrested</a> Monique Smith, 19, on Tuesday night, after a formal complaint was made regarding an incident last June. Smith was involved with a family dispute, during which she allegedly killed the hamster with her hands, then threw the pet across the street; the hamster belonged to a nine-year-old. The hamster was brought to  the ASPCA&#x2019;s Bergh Memorial Animal Hospital for a necropsy, which revealed that the hamster had suffered blunt force trauma, liver damage and an associated hemorrhage.</p>

<p>Smith was charged with one count of aggravated cruelty to animals, a felony; one count of cruelty to animals, a misdemeanor; and three counts of endangering the welfare of a child, a misdemeanor. If convicted, she faces up to two years in prison and/or a $5,000 fine. We&apos;ve contacted the ASPCA to find out how unusual/rare it is for them to see cases involving smaller animals such as hamsters.
