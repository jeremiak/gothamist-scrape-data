<p>Five people, including two children, were killed in a fiery car crash on Long Island last night. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405012742/http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/08/24/us/ap-us-long-island-crash.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">According to</a> police, 37-year-old Brooklyn resident Myriam Lebrun was driving a Honda Accord westbound on the Southern State Parkway around 11 p.m. Saturday. The car veered off the highway just before Exit 38, hitting a tree and bursting into flames. </p>

<p>Onlookers tried to help the people in the car to no avail: &quot;Tried to pull the body away from the fire, but it was too heavy,&quot; Thomas Bennett, who was driving by at the time, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405012742/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2014/08/24/5-killed-as-car-crashes-bursts-into-flames-on-southern-state-parkway/">told CBS</a>. &quot;And then the car was in flames and started popping, so everyone backed up.&quot;</p>

<p>The driver along with four other passengers in the car, including two adults and two children, were all killed. Their names have not been released yet. Authorities are still investigating what caused the car to leave the highway. </p>
