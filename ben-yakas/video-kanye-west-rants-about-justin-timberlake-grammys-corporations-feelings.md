<p>Outside of spawning little Kardashians, breaking the rules <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130330084920/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/14/kim_kardashian_kanye_west_allowed_t.php">at JFK</a>, and tweeting the word <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130330084920/https://twitter.com/kanyewest/status/298869757447393280">&quot;authenticity,&quot;</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130330084920/http://gothamist.com/tags/kanyewest">Kanye West</a> has had a relatively quiet 2013 so far.

Watch the whole thing below&#x2014;at least we can all rest easy tonight knowing that West isn&apos;t wasting any money on a therapist.</p>
