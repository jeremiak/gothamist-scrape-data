<p>Troubled <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502231543/http://gothamist.com/tags/murrybergtraumhighschool">Murry Bergtraum High School</a> is starting to creep up to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502231543/http://gothamist.com/tags/jamesmadisonhighschool">Horndog High</a> levels of dysfunctional. Two fights broke out at the lower Manhattan school on Thursday which had to be broken up by police. &quot;It was pretty messy,&quot; Fabio Seberino, a senior at the school, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502231543/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20130418/civic-center/nypd-called-girls-brawl-at-murry-bergtraum-high-school">told DNAInfo</a>. &quot;One girl&apos;s weave got pulled out.&quot; You can see the fight in question below.</p>

<p>A Department of Education spokeswoman said that the two brawls both were between female students in the hallway, &quot;and students left classrooms to see the fight.&quot; They added: &quot;No students were injured.&quot; </p>

<p>This is but the latest ugly incident to happen at Murry Bergtraum: two school safety guards <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502231543/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20121128/civic-center/two-school-safety-officers-injured-at-murry-bergtraum-hs-officials-say">were injured by students</a> last November. Four students were taken into custody for attempted arson. Police and students <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502231543/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/03/video_crazy_policestudents_fight_at.php">fought in a wild melee that was captured on video</a> last March. And in winter 2010, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502231543/http://gothamist.com/2010/12/10/students_fight_for_their_right_to_p.php">students rioted</a> over a bathroom ban.</p>

<p>This is the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502231543/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/19/teens_brutally_beaten_in_appalling.php">second teenager fight</a> in the last few weeks to require police intervention. But hey, at least nobody&apos;s worried about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502231543/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/27/nj_high_school_officials_get_freake.php">Facebook fight clubs, right?</a></p>
