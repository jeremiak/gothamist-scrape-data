<p>Forget <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505141531/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/21/woman_busted_for_smuggling_cocaine.php">shoes</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505141531/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/23/photos_bra_shoes_used_to_smuggle_co.php#photo-1">bras</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505141531/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/05/video_cat_caught_smuggling_contraba.php">cats</a>&#x2014;if you&apos;re truly serious about smuggling drugs, real criminals know there&apos;s only one way to do it. In and of itself, smuggling drugs in your anus isn&apos;t <em>that</em> remarkable. But you know what is? Setting a <em>record</em> for most bags of heroin hidden in your anus!</p>

<p>And that will be alleged Bloods gang member Rasoul Speight&apos;s claim to fame for now. According <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505141531/http://i.cdn.turner.com/dr/teg/tsg/release/sites/default/files/assets/heroinbutt.jpg">to a police release</a> (note the URL: &quot;heroinbutt&quot;), Speight was pulled over during a routine traffic stop on the Palisades Interstate Parkway on Thursday. Cops thought they smelled marijuana, and asked to search the car; although they found nothing, outstanding traffic warrants popped up for both Speight and his passenger, Gary Sylak. </p>

<p>Both men were arrested, and during a more invasive search at the police station, Speight &#x201C;was found to be in possession of 100 bags of heroin which were concealed in his anus and undetectable at the scene.&#x201D; Cops estimated the heroin&#x2019;s vale at $1000 in NYC, and $2000 in upstate New York, &#x201C;where both subjects were traveling to.&#x201D;</p>
