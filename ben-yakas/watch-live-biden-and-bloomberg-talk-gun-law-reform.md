<p>Vice President Joe Biden is in town today to speak at the 2013 Irish America Hall of Fame luncheon, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130326005717/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/21/biden_bloomberg_to_discuss_gun_cont.php">but first he&apos;ll join Mayor Bloomberg</a> for the time-honored tradition of a live streamed press conference from City Hall. The two will be discussing the importance of meaningful gun law reform around 11 a.m.&#x2014;although, you may notice that it&apos;s already well past that time, which is completely normal. Will Biden hijack the presser to rant <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130326005717/http://www.theonion.com/articles/shirtless-biden-washes-trans-am-in-white-house-dri,2718/">about Trans Ams</a>? Will Bloomberg wear a comfort sweater? Watch below to find out, and we&apos;ll update afterwards.</p>
