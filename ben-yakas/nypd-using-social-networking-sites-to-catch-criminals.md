They caught Manhattan thief James Roberts that way; he boasted about his new bling on MySpace days after mugging a man at a Chelsea bus stop, and even put pictures up wearing the watch and ring he stole. Police called Facebook &quot;instrumental&quot; in busting up a ring of drug dealers who sold coke, ecstasy and dope at nightclubs like Rebel and the Roseland Ballroom last year, and gangs regularly have their own <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150807152004/http://gothamist.com/2010/10/28/gangs_in_harlem.php">MySpace pages</a> with easy-to-identify pictures. <strong>&quot;It&apos;s almost become unfair.
