<p>Dozens of advertisers abandoned O&apos;Reilly&apos;s signature program, <em>The O&apos;Reilly Factor</em>, after the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171008060722/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/01/business/media/bill-oreilly-sexual-harassment-fox-news.html">NY Times revealed that Fox News settled allegations against him</a> from five women for upwards of $13 million. In spite of the pricey settlements, Fox News reportedly renewed O&apos;Reilly&apos;s contract; the Wall Street Journal (also owned by 21st Century Fox) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171008060722/https://www.wsj.com/articles/bill-oreilly-and-fox-news-parent-paid-13-million-to-settle-five-harassment-claims-1491080833">wrote</a>, &quot;The recent review of the allegations against Mr. O&apos;Reilly was taken into consideration when the network negotiated a new contract with the anchor, a person familiar with the matter said.&quot;</p>

<p>Ultimately, more than 50 advertisers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171008060722/https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/04/11/business/oreilly-advertisers.html">abandoned his show</a>, and various women&#x2019;s rights groups <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171008060722/http://variety.com/2017/tv/news/bill-oreilly-fox-news-sexual-harassment-protest-1202032303/">called for his firing.</a> As recently as yesterday, there were new allegations from women against him (including one African-American Fox News clerical worker <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171008060722/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/bill-oreilly-accuser-says-he-called-her-hot-chocolate-leered-995158">who claimed</a> O&apos;Reilly harassed her and called her &quot;hot chocolate&quot;). The growing outcry reportedly led to an internal struggle among the Murdochs, who own Fox. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171008060722/http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/04/sources-the-murdochs-are-turning-against-bill-oreilly.html?mid=twitter_nymag">NY Magazine reported</a>, &quot;Sons James and Lachlan have been arguing that O&#x2019;Reilly needs to go, say these sources, though their father, Rupert, has resisted that outcome.&quot;</p>

<p>O&apos;Reilly and his show will be replaced by Tucker Carlson, a man who enjoys bowties and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171008060722/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/14/video_fox_news_anchor_tucker_carlso.php">fly fishing in Central Park.</a> (He&apos;s also beloved by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171008060722/https://www.mediamatters.org/blog/2017/01/05/fox-news-new-prime-time-host-tucker-carlson-beloved-neo-nazis-and-misogynists/214933">misogynists and neo-Nazis.</a>)</p>
