<p>He&apos;s no <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160525020814/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/20/the_top_15_candidates_to_replace_ji.php">Ant-Man or Julie Klausner</a>, but he&apos;ll do just fine: Seth Meyers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160525020814/http://www.hitfix.com/news/seth-meyers-will-take-over-as-late-night-host-in-2014">will replace</a> Jimmy Fallon as host of <em>Late Night</em> next year. Meyers will stay on at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160525020814/http://gothamist.com/tags/saturdaynightlive"><em>Saturday Night Live</em></a> through the fall and take over <em>Late Night</em> in Feb. 2014 once Fallon <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160525020814/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/03/nbc_will_announce_jimmy_fallon_as_t.php">takes over <em>The Tonight Show</em></a>&#x2014;of course, this is all assuming that Jay Leno doesn&apos;t change his mind yet again.</p>

<p>Meyers is finishing his 12th season on SNL, and his eighth as head writer. &#x201C;Working at &#x2018;SNL&#x2019; requires 100 percent of your mental capacity &#x2014; on easy weeks,&quot; Meyers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160525020814/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/13/business/media/seth-meyers-to-succeed-fallon-on-late-night.html?_r=0">told the Times in an interview</a> Saturday. &quot;And so I had not really spent a lot of time thinking about what I was going to do next. Obviously I can&#x2019;t quit Lorne. So this seems like a pretty good deal that I have an opportunity to keep working with him.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Lorne Michaels told them that there was &#x201C;complete agreement&#x201D; at NBC on the choice of Meyers: &#x201C;The only name that kept coming up was Seth.&#x201D; He said of Meyers, &#x201C;I think he radiates intelligence. He has a background as a performer and a writer. And because I think he doesn&#x2019;t like to copy anyone, I think he will find a way to make the show different and distinct and not a mirror of <em>The Tonight Show.</em>&#x201D;</p>

<p>Meyers has been solid and genial presence on Weekend Update, but has never quite shown the strong personality of a Norm McDonald or Tina Fey. It will be interesting to see what kind of show he&apos;ll have once he has the freedom to shape <em>Late Night</em> as he wants. In the meantime, hopefully this will open up the Weekend Update hosting slot to writer and all around hilarious fellow John Mulaney&#x2014;with his pilot <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160525020814/http://www.avclub.com/articles/nbc-opts-not-to-pick-up-john-mulaneys-sitcom-presu,97618/">not being picked up</a> by NBC, it certainly would be a good time for that. </p>

<p>Barring that, we will campaign fiercely for Ant-Man. </p>
