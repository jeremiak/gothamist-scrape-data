<p>Annual sun-gazing event Manhattanhenge was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506145116/http://gothamist.com/2014/05/29/manhattanhenge_2.php">a bit of a bust last night</a>, turning into another one of those PartlyCloudyHenges we get <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506145116/http://gothamist.com/tags/manhattanhenge">every couple of years</a>. But our frustrations couldn&apos;t compare to those of Sarah Jessica Parker&#x2014;Manhattanhenge was more disappointing than that time Mr. Big refused to introduce her to his mom. Below, let us walk you through the six stages of Manhattanhenge grief with SJP.</p>

<p>First, there was the innocent sparks of misplaced euphoria:</p>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Patiently awaiting Manhattan henge 2014 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506145116/https://twitter.com/search?q=%23cantbelieveigotthekidstobedintime&amp;src=hash">#cantbelieveigotthekidstobedintime</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506145116/http://t.co/z4Jo8vyhan">http://t.co/z4Jo8vyhan</a></p>&#x2014; Sarah Jessica Parker (@SJP) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506145116/https://twitter.com/SJP/statuses/472167924867026944">May 30, 2014</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//web.archive.org/web/20150506145116js_/http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></center>

<center><iframe src="//web.archive.org/web/20150506145116if_/http://instagram.com/p/oma-h6CYHs/embed/" width="612" height="710" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowtransparency="true"></iframe></center>

<p>Then there was bargaining:</p>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506145116/https://twitter.com/Piscesboy69">@Piscesboy69</a> Isn&apos;t it possible the cloud cover might make it even more beautiful? One has to dream</p>&#x2014; Sarah Jessica Parker (@SJP) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506145116/https://twitter.com/SJP/statuses/472169050022227969">May 30, 2014</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//web.archive.org/web/20150506145116js_/http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></center>

<p>Then desperation:</p>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506145116/https://twitter.com/Piscesboy69">@Piscesboy69</a> No I get that man! But I got some breakage over here and I&apos;m seeing sky. And I might not get the children to sleep next time</p>&#x2014; Sarah Jessica Parker (@SJP) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506145116/https://twitter.com/SJP/statuses/472170313254322177">May 30, 2014</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//web.archive.org/web/20150506145116js_/http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></center>

<p>Then acceptance:</p>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>A piece of plain old ordinary sky poking through under the standard hotel. Ah well, the walk was nice.&#x2026; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506145116/http://t.co/QNHBYMC8hB">http://t.co/QNHBYMC8hB</a></p>&#x2014; Sarah Jessica Parker (@SJP) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506145116/https://twitter.com/SJP/statuses/472172388508262400">May 30, 2014</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//web.archive.org/web/20150506145116js_/http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></center>

<center><iframe src="//web.archive.org/web/20150506145116if_/http://instagram.com/p/omdAcfCYLJ/embed/" width="612" height="710" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowtransparency="true"></iframe></center>

<p>She looked for comfort from strangers. All she found was knowing looks:</p>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Just saw 1 other person crying. I could tell Manhattanhenge had broken her heart too. We shared a knowing look.</p>&#x2014; Sarah Jessica Parker (@SJP) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506145116/https://twitter.com/SJP/statuses/472176574171996161">May 30, 2014</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//web.archive.org/web/20150506145116js_/http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></center>

<p>But just like Steve and Miranda in the laundry room during their child&apos;s first birthday, hope springs eternal:</p>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506145116/http://t.co/7kDlwZCItG">http://t.co/7kDlwZCItG</a> wait! Tomorrow 8:18p! Full sun on the grid! <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506145116/https://twitter.com/Piscesboy69">@Piscesboy69</a> I am renewed! Reborn. Hallelujah!</p>&#x2014; Sarah Jessica Parker (@SJP) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506145116/https://twitter.com/SJP/statuses/472182538782654464">May 30, 2014</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//web.archive.org/web/20150506145116js_/http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></center>

<p>As Shakespeare once said: The wheel is come/ full circle/ and the movies aren&apos;t canon/ so Steve never really cheated on Miranda/ and let us never speak of Abu Dhabi.</p>
