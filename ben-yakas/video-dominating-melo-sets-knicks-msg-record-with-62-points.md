<p>Smiles have been in short supply at MSG this season, as the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502175115/http://gothamist.com/tags/knicks">Knicks</a> have collectively grimaced through a mostly terrible season filled with disappointment, underachieving, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502175115/http://deadspin.com/andrea-bargnani-is-out-indefinitely-we-made-him-a-vide-1507725541">whatever it is that Bargs does</a>. But for one night, MSG was the best place on earth as Carmelo Anthony scored a Knicks and MSG record 62 points in a 125-96 rout of the Charlotte Bobcats. Below, you can see every point he scored, including the unbelievable half-court shot moments before halftime.</p>

<p>Anthony made 23 of 35 shots in scoring the most points in the NBA so far this season. He broke Bernard King&apos;s Knicks record of 60 points set in 1984, and Kobe Bryant&apos;s MSG record of 61 points set five years ago. &quot;I made history tonight, with the performance, but just to be a part of that group of people, like I said, there&apos;s only a small group of people that knows what that zone feels like and tonight I was one of them,&quot; Anthony said.</p>

look at Stoudemire cooling &apos;Melo down.

<p>Melo&apos;s teammates <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502175115/http://nypost.com/2014/01/25/knicks-teammates-in-awe-of-melos-big-night/">were justly in awe</a>. &#x201C;It was jawdropping,&#x2019;&#x2019; Iman Shumpert said after the game. &#x201C;We didn&#x2019;t know what to do but eat some popcorn and watch. &quot;I saw the look in his eyes,&#x2019;&#x2019; Raymond Felton said. &quot;It was the eye of the tiger, eye of the lion. To witness that was amazing.&quot;</p>

J.R.

<p>&quot;I have seen that look in his eye before,&quot; added JR Smith. &quot;When he made his first three of four, I knew they were in trouble. Today he was serious. You could see the demeanor in his face. There are few times I see him have that look.&#x2019;&quot; LeBron James also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502175115/http://espn.go.com/blog/new-york/knicks/post/_/id/52961/notes-melos-night-impresses-king-james">tweeted his appreciation of the performance</a>, calling Anthony a &quot;rocket launcher from birth:&quot; &quot;I&apos;m at a team even and heard @carmeloanthony is doing what!!? 50 in the 3rd. What!!&quot;</p>

<p>Considering this season has been somewhat of a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502175115/http://espn.go.com/blog/new-york/knicks/post/_/id/52822/seasons-a-reoccurring-nightmare-for-melo">&quot;recurring nightmare&quot; to Melo</a>, plagued by rumors that he&apos;ll jump ship next off-season, this was an especially satisfying night for Melo to recommit to the team. &quot;Just to see everybody smiling once again, that&apos;s what I was more excited to see,&quot; Anthony said. &quot;Guys on the bench smiling, high-fiving, having fun once again, that&apos;s the only thing I care about.&quot; Just look at how happy they are:</p>

<p>But the people who truly needed this night more than Melo, more than the team, and even more than the Garden: the Knicks beat writers and bloggers who have suffered through infuriating loss after infuriating loss packed with infuriating performances and infuriating coaching strategies. And <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502175115/http://theknickswall.com/2014/01/25/game-recap-knicks-125-bobcats-96-melo-62/">if you peruse</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502175115/http://www.cbssports.com/nba/writer/ken-berger/24419474/tired-of-losing-melo-erupts-for-62-at-the-garden">some of</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502175115/http://sports.yahoo.com/news/carmelo-anthony-s-magical-62-point-night-shows-why-he-should-never-leave-new-york-054123184.html">their reactions</a>, you can feel the satisfaction (and relief) that last night&apos;s game <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502175115/http://www.sbnation.com/nba/2014/1/25/5344324/carmelo-anthony-record-62-points-lebron-james">brought them</a>, regardless of what happens with the rest of this season. </p>

<p>Jim Cavan at Knickerblogger, whose game recaps have gotten progressively more unhinged as the Knicks have flailed this year, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502175115/http://knickerblogger.net/knicks-125-bobcats-96-the-ecstasy-of-victory/">summed up the joy</a>:</p>

<blockquote>After the joy wears off, after morning comes and the headache reins, we&#x2019;ll still have this. We&#x2019;ll always have this. This thing that was more than a mere display. More than a mere record, even. This taking back of what belongs in-house. This basketball poetry. This lambasted leader who has every right to want out of this twisted cauldron forever, but keeps coming back and blowing the windows off. A lesser leader would&#x2019;ve surveyed the scene and sighed and said to himself &#x201C;I&#x2019;m saving it all for something better.&#x201D; A lesser leader would rest on All-Star laurels.</blockquote>
