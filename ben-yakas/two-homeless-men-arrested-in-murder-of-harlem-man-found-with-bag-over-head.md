<p>Two homeless men <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130326200045/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/three_people_arrested_heights_murder_L7cHUDEpyEyBTk3bUe2q8M">were arrested for the murder</a> of a Harlem man who had been found dead in his apartment <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130326200045/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/29/harlem_man_found_dead_with_hands_ti.php">with a bag over his head and his service dog at his side</a>. According to cops, brothers Ralph Stokes, 52, and Keith Stokes, 50, were arrested yesterday for the murder and robbery of 48-year-old Charles Romo. Bridgette Cash, 38, was also arrested on charges she helped them and used Romo&apos;s credit card.</p>

<p>Romo, who died of blunt force trauma, was found on January 28th in his apartment &quot;kneeling on the bedroom floor with [his] hands tied behind his back and legs secured together with that appeared to be a belt. There was tape found wrapped around his neck and blood coming from the head and neck area.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130326200045/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/3-Arrested-Harlem-Man-Charles-Romo-Death-January-Bound-Bag-Over-Head.html">He also had</a> more than a dozen wounds to his head and marks on his arms. Romo was partially blind and suffered from HIV; police found his seeing eye dog, a greyhound, guarding his body.</p>

<p>Initially, cops thought this murder might be connected with two other murders of gay men the the NYPD Hate Crimes Task Force has been investigating, but no link has been found between the homicides as of yet. The brothers have been charged with second-degree murder, as well as first-degree robbery. Cash was charged with grand larceny and criminal possession of stolen property.</p>
