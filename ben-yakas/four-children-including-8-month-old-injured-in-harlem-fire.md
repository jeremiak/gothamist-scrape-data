<p>Four children, including an eight-month-old girl, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509165223/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2011/10/09/2011-10-09_kids_hurt_in_harlem_blaze_8monthold_among_4_injured_in_early_morning_apartment_f.html">were injured in an early morning Harlem fire</a> yesterday. The fire broke out on the fifth floor of the six-story building at Manhattan Avenue and W. 115th Street. &quot;My dog woke me up barking and when I went into the hall it was black with smoke. I felt the flames on my face. I was terrified,&quot; said resident Shaun Holbrook, who was able to escape down a fire escape with his dog in his arms. </p>

<p>Cops are still investigating how the fire started, but resident Izell Davis says it started in his bedroom, and blames it on an extension cord by the closet: &quot;I was watching TV&#x2014;&apos;Married with Children.&apos; As soon as I cut off the TV, I saw the flames in my closet.&quot; No one was killed, but two boys ages 9 and 14, and a girl age 11, were taken to the New York-Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell Medical Center with burns on their feet from the hot fire escape. The eight-month-old was taken to St. Luke&apos;s Hospital with smoke inhalation.</p>
