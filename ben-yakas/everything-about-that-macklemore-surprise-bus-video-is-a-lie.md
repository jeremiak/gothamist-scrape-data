title: Everything About That Macklemore 'Surprise' Bus Video Is A Lie

<p>This week, Macklemore and Ryan Lewis surprised a bus full of New Yorkers by performing in transit as part of a promotional video for the GRAMMYs [sic]. We&#x2014;like those delighted, multi-ethnic, toilet paper-throwing bus patrons&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503234113/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/15/macklemore_and_that_other_guy_surpr.php">were completely charmed</a> by the spontaneity of the tag-popping, bargain-hunting duo. Or at least we were charmed until we learned that <em>it was all a lie</em>.</p>

<p>Let&apos;s peel back the onion: an MTA spokesman confirmed to us that the stunt was not pre-authorized by the MTA. In addition, the bus used in the video doesn&#x2019;t match the models currently on the Bx6 route. Across the board, commercial projects have to get the MTA&apos;s approval before using their equipment (with their name on it) in shoots; there are decommissioned buses which can be privately rented though.</p>

<p>But it goes deeper: Bob Rayburn, the creative director of TBWA/Chiat Day, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503234113/http://pix11.com/2014/01/17/mta-investigating-macklemore-ryan-lewis-video-allegedly-shot-on-bx6-bus-3/#axzz2ql7ost18">told WPIX in a statement</a> that the video was shot in Morningside Heights on <strong>&#x201C;a real MTA bus that we had hired for the production so that we could pack it with the hidden cameras.&#x201D;</strong> LIES UPON LIES ON A SOILED BED OF SECOND-HAND CLOTHING.</p>

<p>&quot;Our passengers had no idea what was in store for them. What you see is their real reactions to the music and the performance from Macklemore &amp; Ryan Lewis,&#x201D; Rayburn said. Ahh, but it&apos;s not like the GRAMMYs [sic] could just start picking up passengers on the Bx6 route whilst pretending to be the MTA&#x2014;which means these had to be hired actors. Maybe they weren&apos;t told <em>what</em> they were doing on the bus, or the fact that they would come face-to-face with an Album Of The Year nominee, but these were not regular New Yorkers so much as they were handpicked seat fillers with degrees in acting surprised.</p>

<p>Something tells us this conspiracy goes even deeper&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503234113/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZdMvQuqGb0">dancing grandmothers are not above reproach anymore.</a></p>
