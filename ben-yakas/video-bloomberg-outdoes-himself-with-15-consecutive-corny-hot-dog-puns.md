<p>We&apos;re over the halfway point of 2013, which means we&apos;re inching closer and closer to Mayor Bloomberg kicking all of us ungrateful plebs to curb, hopping on a plane to Bermuda, and kicking back with some watered-down Big Gulps. Bloomberg passed another major marker on his Farewell NY tour yesterday when he presided over the official <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502110001/http://gothamist.com/tags/nathanshotdogeatingcontest">Nathan&apos;s Famous Fourth of July International Hot Dog-Eating Contest</a> weigh-in ceremony, as he begrudgingly has for the past decade. And he went out in style this year with his most painfully punny speech ever! Skip ahead to 3:00 into the video to watch him cram 15 hot dog puns into one poor sentence.</p>

<p>Here&apos;s the full transcript of the gloriously corny sentence below:</p>

<blockquote>Let&apos;s be frank: tomorrow on a dog day afternoon, in a tradition New Yorkers relish, and that&apos;s certainly not for the thin-skinned, we&apos;ll see if anyone can ketchup to Joey and the Black Widow, cut the mustard without landing in hot water or getting grilled by the judges or embroiled in a scandal, and steam the competition, roast their rivals, kick everyone&apos;s buns, and be declared best-in-show, top dog, and weiner of the contest.</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502110001/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/03/tomorrows_july_4th_and_we.php#photo-1">Unlike last year</a>, Bloomberg was able to hold himself back from wondering out loud, seriously, who wrote this shit. Instead, he poked fun at that slip-up: &#x201C;Now before you ask me who wrote this sh&#x2014;shrewd prose, let me just say, speeches are like sausages: It&#x2019;s better not to see them being made.&#x201D; </p>

<p>The NY Times <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502110001/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/04/nyregion/3-long-terms-of-hot-dogs-ground-hogs-and-corny-puns-for-bloomberg.html?ref=nyregion&amp;_r=0">got a little nostalgic today</a>, recounting all those ceremonial events Bloomberg grinned-and-beared during his administration. It&apos;s pretty clear he has had a lot more fun hanging with &quot;great coroporate citizens&quot; like Nathan&apos;s than, ya know, actual human beings. So let&apos;s all savor these moments&#x2014;we may never see him <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502110001/http://www.bensonhurstbean.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/bloomberg-hot-dog.jpg">hugged by a hot dog again.</a></p>
