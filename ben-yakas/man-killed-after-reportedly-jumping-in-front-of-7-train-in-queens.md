<p>A man was fatally struck by a train in Queens this afternoon. According to police, the victim was hit by a northbound 7 train as it pulled into the station at 52nd Street and Roosevelt Avenue around 1:30 p.m. today. He was pronounced dead at the scene. Cops added that no criminality is suspected, and many people tweeted that they saw the victim jump in front of the subway. </p>

<p>Currently, there is no <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160903182529/http://www.mta.info/status/serviceStatus.html">7 train service</a> in either direction from the 74th Street-Broadway Station to the Hunters Point Avenue Station due to the incident.
