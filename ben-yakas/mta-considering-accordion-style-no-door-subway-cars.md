<p>The MTA is considering adopting articulated train cars, similar to accordion-style buses, as the subway cars of the future. This means you may have to kiss your dreams of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509165653/http://gothamist.com/tags/quietcar">subway quiet cars</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509165653/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/15/should_the_subways_have_conversatio.php">conversation cars</a> goodbye.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509165653/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/21/nyregion/no-doors-between-subway-cars-mta-may-consider-new-model.html?partner=socialflow&amp;smid=tw-nytmetro">The Times reports that</a> the MTA released a 142-page document outlining needs for the next 20 years, the MTA is interested in getting rid of doors between subway cars, and instead adopting long cars ala Toronto&apos;s underground system. &#x201C;This will both maximize carrying capacity,&#x201D; the authority wrote, adding that it will allow passengers to &#x201C;move to less-crowded areas of the train, balancing loading and unloading times at all doors.&#x201D;</p>

<p>This wouldn&apos;t happen anytime soon&#x2014;probably not for 30 or 40 years&#x2014;and it might be too cost prohibitive to pull off. We are talking about an organization that doesn&apos;t consider <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509165653/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/29/fare_hike.php">a $1.9 billion surplus</a> a surplus, after all. But just imagine how this would change life for straphangers: that car that&apos;s completely empty because one person <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509165653/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/08/photo_what_compels_a_human_being_to.php">evacuated on the floor</a> would no longer exist, and we&apos;d all have to deal with the stench. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509165653/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/01/video_the_most_epic_or_staged_subwa.php">Subway sax battles</a> would become an unfortunate everyday occurrence. And dear god, you could no longer hide from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509165653/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/11/subway_cheese.php">that man eating smelly brie.</a> </p>
