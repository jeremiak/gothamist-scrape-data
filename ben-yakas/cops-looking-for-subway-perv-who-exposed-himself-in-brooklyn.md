<p>Police are looking for a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427151340/http://gothamist.com/tags/subwaypervert">subway pervert</a> who they say exposed and touched himself on a train in Brooklyn this week. The incident happened on Wednesday on the southbound 2 Train at the Atlantic Avenue Subway Station. The suspect allegedly exposed himself to a 28-year-old woman, then started touching himself. </p>

<p>The suspect is said to be 30-40, bald, medium build, and was wearing a black and white shirt. The woman exited the train car at the next stop after capturing cell phone video of him&#x2014;unfortunately, police didn&apos;t send out the video, so we can&apos;t publicly shame the suspect with it. But at least you can keep an eye out for him, and hopefully we won&apos;t have another situation where a man ejaculates on multiple female subway passengers in crowded train cars and gets away with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427151340/http://gothamist.com/2012/09/19/subway_pervert_grinding_ejaculating.php">just a slap on the wrist.</a>  </p>
