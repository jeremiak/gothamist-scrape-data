<p>This week, there was a moment when it seemed as if the spirit of the holiday season had infected <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160712155451/http://gothamist.com/tags/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> after he took a break from insulting Cher and hawking his Miss Universe pageant to give President Obama <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160712155451/http://gothamist.com/2012/11/21/president_obama_has_earned_donald_t.php">two thumbs up for his handling of Israel</a>. But it turns out that his sudden reasonableness may have had more to do with his children than with any softening of his own blowhard persona. According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160712155451/http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/gossip/confidential/kids-urge-trump-cool-obama-article-1.1207182">a report in the Daily News</a>, Trump&apos;s children Eric, Donald Jr. and Ivanka staged an intervention with him recently over his increasingly unhinged rants about Obama&#x2014;and they may have gotten through to him.</p>

<p>&#x201C;The three of them met and went to see their dad in his Fifth Ave. office,&quot; the source told the News. &quot;They showed a lot of respect, but told him he&#x2019;s worked too long and too hard to build up the reputation he has. They understand completely he&#x2019;s always been outspoken and that he likes attention, but this is too much.&quot; The source suggests that the kids may have been motivated as much for their dad&apos;s reputation as their own: <br>
&#x201C;They want their dad to get respect and then the whole family does well,&#x201D; the source says. &#x201C;They told him you can&#x2019;t throw this all away on this nonsense.&#x201D;</p>

<p>This meeting reportedly happened in mid-October, which didn&apos;t stop Trump from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160712155451/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/24/video_donald_trumps_big_october_sur.php">publicly extorting the president</a> in the name of charity, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160712155451/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/30/huge_jerk_donald_trump_thinks_hurri.php">politicizing Hurricane Sandy</a> to attack Obama, and having <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160712155451/http://gothamist.com/2012/11/07/huge_jerk_donald_trump_had_twitter.php">a public temper tantrum/meltdown</a> over the election results. But this is still progress! </p>

<p>Of course, Trump&apos;s rep denied that any meeting took place, and claimed the kids love his use of &#x201C;free speech&#x201D; and would never try to rein him in: &#x201C;They would never ever do that. It never happened. It&#x2019;s simply untrue.&quot; But obviously The Donald is softening a bit...or going completely bonkers:</p>
