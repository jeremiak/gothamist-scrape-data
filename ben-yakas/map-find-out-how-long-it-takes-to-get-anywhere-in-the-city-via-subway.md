<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429161001/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/05/map_new_york_citys_commute_times_ar.php">WNYC analyzed and mapped</a> the latest census data on average commute times, coming to the conclusion that New Yorkers generally have some of the worst commutes in the country. But now WNYC <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429161001/http://project.wnyc.org/transit-time/#40.71070,-73.97090,14,780">has gone one better</a>, creating an interactive subway-centered transit time map (using OpenTripPlanner and the MTA&apos;s subway schedule data). Go ahead and play around with it below, and see how accurate it is to your experiences.</p>
