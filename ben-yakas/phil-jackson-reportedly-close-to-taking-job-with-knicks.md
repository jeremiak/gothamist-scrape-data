<p>Just about every time the Knicks have started to fall apart in recent years, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506173207/http://gothamist.com/tags/philjackson">Phil Jackson&apos;s</a> name has been indelicately tossed around, like JR Smith <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506173207/http://www.sbnation.com/nba/2014/3/8/5486386/j-r-smith-off-the-backboard-assist-ny-knicks">heaving a backboard assist</a>, as a potential savior. Maybe Jackson, who retired from coaching the Lakers in 2011, really thinks having meetings is zen or something, because thus far, the Knicks&apos; efforts to lure him to the team <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506173207/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/16/phil_jackson_laughs_at_idea_of_coac.php">have fallen short hilariously</a>. But <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506173207/http://espn.go.com/new-york/nba/story/_/id/10574864/phil-jackson-leaning-taking-new-york-knicks-front-office-job">ESPN is now reporting</a> that Jackson is &apos;leaning toward&apos; accepting a job as president of basketball operations &quot;in complete control of all basketball-related matters.&quot; COMPLETE CONTROL, people. Hmm, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506173207/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/02/sports/basketball/02walsh.html?_r=0">something about that sounds sort of familiar.</a></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506173207/http://nypost.com/2014/03/08/jax-may-take-knicks-job-report/">The Post&apos;s source says</a> that Jackson is &quot;real close&quot; to accepting the front-office position with the Knicks. Their league source added that Jackson &quot;has done a lot of research on the Knicks in recent weeks, including watching games, observing their off-the-court issues and studying their roster and cap situation.&quot; Jackson was reportedly more interested in a front-office position rather than a coaching job (which he was also offered by current Knicks president Steve Mills). </p>

<p>As we alluded to above, the idea of Knicks owner James Dolan ceding complete control over basketball operations to Jackson is wishful thinking&#x2014;Donnie Walsh <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506173207/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/02/sports/basketball/02walsh.html?_r=0">was also given</a> a mandate in 2008 to &quot;do whatever is necessary to turn this team around&quot; without meddling from Dolan. And then Dolan overruled him to make the Carmelo Anthony trade happen, and Walsh <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506173207/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/03/with_donnie_walsh_gone_will_the_kni.php">quickly left town.</a> So autonomy is a lovely fantasy, but it won&apos;t be autonomy that gets Jackson here, or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506173207/http://www.northjersey.com/sports/249169341_Popper__Only_cash_will_lure_Jackson__keep_Carmelo.html">keeps Anthony in Knicks colors</a> after this disastrous season. As <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506173207/http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/basketball/knicks/lupica-knicks-holding-savior-article-1.1715649">the News points out</a>:</p>

<blockquote>Maybe Dolan will throw so much money at Jackson that the Zen guy won&#x2019;t care that autonomy at the Garden often means being told &#x2014; by the Garden &#x2014; to whom he can speak and when he can speak. Maybe Jackson at this point in his career and this point in his basketball life won&#x2019;t mind being handled and managed and being told, in this small-time way, that he doesn&#x2019;t need to ever speak to Knicks fans through the media. It is just awfully hard to see it happening with a legend of the game who has been telling you all about it since he started winning championships with Michael Jordan and the Bulls.</blockquote>

<p>The Knicks are also reportedly hoping to use Jackson <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506173207/http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/basketball/knicks/lord-rings-knicks-plan-phil-hardware-recruit-free-agents-article-1.1715376">as a lure for free agents</a> as they try to rebuild their roster this offseason. Jackson started his career with the Knicks, and won 11 NBA championships with the Lakers and the Bulls. A front-office position managing every facet of the team he started his career with sounds like a nice cap on an incredible career, but it&apos;s also worth remembering that Jackson very much cares about his legacy and winning, and the Knicks under Dolan haven&apos;t exactly been competent, let alone a winning club.</p>

<p>As former MSG president Dave Checketts <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506173207/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/15/if_knicks_fans_beg_will_phil_jackso.php">said a few years ago</a> when Jackson&apos;s name was being brought up as a possible replacement for Mike D&apos;Antoni, &quot;I think Phil has too much pride to come back to draw a paycheck; he&apos;ll only come back to coach a team that adds to his legacy. Phil would only return for a team that can win it, and I just don&apos;t know if you can say that about this Knicks club.&quot; </p>
