<p>A woman named Anne Wiswell <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141022173928/http://www.marketplace.org/topics/business/occupy-wall-st/voices-occupy-wall-street">was interviewed by Marketplace in 2011</a> due to her involvement with the Occupy Wall Street protests. She had been a student at the New School until her parents told her they couldn&apos;t afford to pay for her education anymore: &quot;It was this massive realization&#x2014;&apos;Oh my gosh, I have to support myself. Welcome to the real world,&apos;&quot; she told them at the time. &quot;I need to get involved with government policy so that I can afford to live in this country and in this city.&quot;</p>
