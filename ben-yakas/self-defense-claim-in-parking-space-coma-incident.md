										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:365px; "> <img alt="3511comaspace.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20171101030859im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/3511comaspace.jpg" width="365" height="320"> <br> <i>On East 14th Street, near the spot where the fight occurred</i></div> <p></p>

<p>Yesterday, we heard the grisly story of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171101030859/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/04/dispute_over_parking_spot_ends_with.php">parking space rage</a> gone too far: petite Bronx woman Lana Rosas ended up in a coma after a vicious confrontation with electrician Oscar Fuller over a parking spot. Rosas was holding the space on East 14th Street for her boyfriend, and refused to let Fuller park his van; the argument escalated, and Fuller punched Rosas &quot;in the face with so much force that the woman flew off her feet,&quot; according to court papers. But in court yesterday, Fuller&apos;s lawyer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171101030859/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/parking_space_coma_thug_deserve_S6b6iTIp9ZnZSoRaIkjLdI">argued that</a> he was just acting in self-defense: &quot;There is nothing to suggest my client intended to inflict serious injury. At most, the charge should be misdemeanor assault.&quot; </p>

<p>Thomas Kenniff, Fuller&apos;s attorney, didn&apos;t dispute that Fuller punched Rosas in the face, sending her into a coma, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171101030859/http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2011/03/04/self-defense-claim-in-violent-parking-dispute/?mod=WSJBlog">he argued that</a> the 4-foot-11 Rosas of attacking his client first, hitting him multiple times in the face. Then Fuller saw her boyfriend running toward them: &#x201C;Now, as he perceives it, he believes he&#x2019;s being attacked by two people. He throws one punch to the woman&#x2019;s face, to defend himself, gets in his car and removes himself from the situation.&#x201D; Fuller, a father of two with prior busts for weapons possession and felony assault, has been charged with felony assault. </p>

<p>According to Kenniff, Fuller &quot;was in tears&quot; when the lawyer visited him in jail: &quot;not because of the situation that he&apos;s in, but first and foremost the situation that the young woman is in.&quot; Rosas <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171101030859/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2011/03/05/2011-03-05_lana_rosas_punched_in_the_face_sent_into_a_coma_in_spat_over_a_parking_spot.html">remains hospitalized</a> in a coma at Bellevue Hospital with her family and boyfriend; doctors told cops that she suffered permanent brain damage from hitting her head in the pavement, and may die. Kenniff added that Fuller acted on instinct, and didn&apos;t intend to hurt Rosas: &#x201C;The bottom line is the events, while tragic, are not criminal,&#x201D; Kenniff said.</p>
