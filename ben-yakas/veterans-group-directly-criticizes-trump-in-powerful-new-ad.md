<p>Despite his protestations otherwise, Donald Trump has long had a mixed relationship with veterans, having <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170208211326/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/05/30/tomorrow-trump-will-give-more-details-about-his-donations-to-vets-heres-what-we-still-dont-know/?utm_term=.259b4f864c26">used other people&apos;s money</a> on donations to various charities but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170208211326/http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/trumps-history-veterans-gets-renewed-scrutiny">not his own</a>, despite <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170208211326/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/05/24/four-months-later-donald-trump-says-he-gave-1-million-to-veterans-group/?utm_term=.d923eaf0be43">his many promises</a>. His attacks on the likes of prisoner-of-war John McCain and especially <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170208211326/https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/20/khizr-khan-vilified-trump-far-right-voice-heard">Khizr and Ghazala Khan</a>, Gold Star parents, have been disgusting, to say nothing of his own <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170208211326/http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/290105-trump-got-five-draft-deferments-during-vietnam">cowardly military record</a>, or lack thereof. And yet, Trump thoroughly bested Hillary Clinton with veterans, who voted for him by a two-to-one margin.</p>

<p>Now that Trump is in office, he has begun <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170208211326/https://newrepublic.com/article/140357/donald-trump-no-friend-veterans">breaking his promises</a> to them again, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170208211326/http://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/the-administration/316467-trumps-hiring-freeze-breaks-faith-with-americas">imposing a hiring freeze</a> for the federal government which will prevent many veterans from getting jobs, will cause longer waits for VA medical care, and increase the backlog on VA disability claims. And a veterans advocacy group has called Trump out on his bullshit in a new ad which aired during Trump&apos;s beloved morning news shows.</p>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">.<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170208211326/https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump">@realDonaldTrump</a>, we&#x2019;re debuting this ad on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170208211326/https://twitter.com/Morning_Joe">@Morning_Joe</a>, and taking it to other morning shows you watch, too! <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170208211326/https://t.co/LVINhUenaV">pic.twitter.com/LVINhUenaV</a></p>&#x2014; VoteVets (@votevets) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170208211326/https://twitter.com/votevets/status/828567034254487553">February 6, 2017</a></blockquote>

<p>The ad is courtesy of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170208211326/http://www.votevets.org/">VoteVets</a>, who bill themselves as the largest progressive group for veterans in the country representing over 500,000 veterans, military family members and supporters. They say they use public issue campaigns &quot;to give a voice to veterans on matters of national security, veterans&apos; care, and every day issues that affect the lives of those who served, and their families.&quot; Here they go directly after Trump for trying to kill ACA, his immigration and refugee ban, and generally acting like a reality show host instead of a leader. In the 30 second ad, an Afghanistan War veteran who lost his leg in combat narrates his morning routine:</p>

<blockquote>President Trump, I hear you watch the morning shows. Here&apos;s what I do every morning.

<p>Look, you lost the popular vote, you&apos;re having trouble drawing a crowd, and your approval rating keeps sinking. But kicking thousands of my fellow veterans off their health insurance by killing the Affordable Care Act, and banning Muslims, won&apos;t help. That&apos;s not the America I sacrificed for. </p>

<p>You want to be a legitimate president, sir? Then act like one.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>VoteVets Vice Chair and Navy Veteran Peter Kauffmann explained the placement of the ad <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170208211326/http://www.votevets.org/press/votevets-releases-blistering-new-ad-telling-trump-to-start-acting-like-a-legitimate-president">in a press release</a>: &#x201C;Since the White House comment line is down, and Donald Trump hasn&#x2019;t set up that veterans hotline he promised, we&#x2019;re going to go where we know Donald Trump is listening - Morning Joe, and the other shows that he obsesses over.  He&#x2019;s going to hear the message of this ad again and again.  We&#x2019;re officially putting Mr. Trump on notice.&quot;</p>

<p>The ad also got the Batman to Trump&apos;s Joker, Rosie O&apos;Donnell, tweeting.</p>
