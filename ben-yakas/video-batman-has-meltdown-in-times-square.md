<p>We know it must be very hard to watch helplessly as your rich parents are shot and killed before your eyes by the very people they were trying to help. We can only imagine what dark paths you might go down because of such a traumatic childhood memory. But that&apos;s still no justification for cursing in front of kids or pushing them, as the Times Square Batman in the video below allegedly did. It&apos;s just a good thing those two Spider-Men were there to calm him down.</p>

<p>Regardless of what happened before the video began, we can confirm that Batman was cursing in front of kids while this was being recorded. We can also confirm that Batman knows a gangster when he sees one, and there were no gangsters in Times Square last night. As disappointing as this is, at least he didn&apos;t <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161244/http://gothamist.com/tags/antisemiticelmo">unload any anti-Semitic screeds like some of his costumed brethren.</a></p>
