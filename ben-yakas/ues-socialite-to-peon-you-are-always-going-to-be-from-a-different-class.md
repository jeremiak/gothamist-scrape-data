<p>You may recall that 35-year-old interior designer Micky Hurley <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428142959/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/16/nanny_suing_upper_east_side_sociali.php">is being sued by his Chilean nanny</a>, who claims she was forced into indentured servitude by him. Felicitas del Carmen Villanueva Garnica, 50, claims she was the virtual slave of Hurley and his socialite wife, berated, belittled, and ordered never to leave their house. Would it shock you to learn that another person is now claiming that Hurley is a deceitful and pretentious rich snob?</p>

Rodriguez requested the money in 2010, and in return, was allegedly subjected to a barrage of withering classist criticisms and insults:</p>

<blockquote>DON&apos;T COME THREATENING ME YOU WORTHLESS LITTLE SHIT. NEVER. Remember, you are ALWAYS going to be from a different class, you were born where you were born, and even if you were reborn a billion times, you will never have a Baroness for a grandmother like me.</blockquote>

Go there to read the initial back-and-forth, but below, you can check out the closing salvo:</p>

<blockquote>MAIL DE HURLEY:

<p>Read carefully what I am writing here, as it will be the last time I do so. Listen you poor, miserable, ROTEQUE [Ed note: &quot;Roteque&quot; does not have a direct translation to English. It implies someone from a lower class and is an incredibly offensive word. The most awful adjective you can think of], low-born social climber. Delete your grubby photos. DON&apos;T COME THREATENING ME YOU WORTHLESS LITTLE SHIT. NEVER. Remember, you are ALWAYS going to be from a different class, you were born where you were born, and even if you were reborn a billion times, you will never have a Baroness for a grandmother like me.</p>

<p>This is what I get for working with street trash like you. For your information, the photos on my webpage, the ones that I have not bothered updating, are from STYLING. I don&apos;t have to fake my way through with other peoples&apos; work. They know my work, they know I have a good eye, and I&apos;ve been on the cover of magazines a number of times.</p>

<p>What&#x2019;s more, you wretch, in April Architectural Design is coming to photograph the apartment I am decorating in Miami. With all of its Matisse, Dufy, and Bonard paintings. So I guess you can see, you idiot, the level I&#x2019;m on. Oh! and the gentleman from Sutton Place asked me to renovate his home in Greenwich...what do you think of that? Jealous?? I would have paid you your miserable US$240 immediately if you if you&#x2019;d delivered the work first, AS IT SHOULD BE. Delete my email address and all of my information. You, parvenu, are dead to me. Malu once asked me how I could trust you so much. It&#x2019;s obvious now, when you give poor trash an inch, they take a mile.</p>

<p>You screwed me over with the Lo Curro photos, very unprofessional. Just remember, because you have angered me you will NEVER work for ANY magazine or newspaper in Chile.</p>

<p>Goodbye, great-grandson of a seamstress.</p>

<p>HURLEY &amp; CO.</p>
