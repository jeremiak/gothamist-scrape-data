<p>With precious snow angels <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140309142224/http://gothamist.com/2014/02/15/more_snow_expected_to_hit_city_toda.php">once again gracing our fair city</a> with their god damn presence today, you&apos;d be wise to keep your eyes and ears peeled on the road, lest some bulldozing snow plow pummels you with snow. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140309142224/http://gothamist.com/2014/02/07/video_brooklyn_man_pummeled_with_sn.php">That&apos;s what happened</a> to Pedro Plaza last week as he was walking past JM Legend Auto dealership in Sheepshead Bay. And it happened again Thursday night when snow from a snow plow shattered the glass of a Queens restaurant, knocking down a customer in the process.</p>

<p>In the surveillance video above, you can see the windows shattering at Exo Cafe on Austin Street in Forest Hills. &quot;Everybody jumped. The glass went all the way up to the bar,&quot; restaurant manager Peter Kambitsis <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140309142224/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/NYC-Snowplow-Shatters-Restaurant-Windows-Knocks-Over-Customer-Video-245630791.html">told NBC</a>. Kambitsis added that the plow driver didn&apos;t stop, and workers had to catch up to him at a red light. </p>

<p>The woman who fell over when the glass shattered was taken to the hospital, where she was reportedly okay. But because the snow destroyed the windows and a door, restaurant employees had to stay overnight Thursday to guard the business. The Department of Sanitation said it conducted an investigation into the incident and is taking disciplinary action against the plow truck operators. </p>

<p>As for Plaza, the man who was walloped with snow from a plow last week in Brooklyn, the Sanitation Department said it was also taking disciplinary action against the drivers in that incident. Plaza is still reportedly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140309142224/http://gothamist.com/2014/02/12/video_brooklyn_man_pummeled_by_snow.php">considering suing the city.</a></p>
