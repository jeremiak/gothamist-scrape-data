Shaquille Jones, 17, died from a shot to the head; a 16-year-old and 19-year-old were wounded and taken to Brookdale Hospital where they are listed in stable condition. &#x201C;This is a tragedy. This is not the type of kid to get shot,&#x201D; classmate Jason Johnson said about Jones, who he called &quot;a good kid.&quot;<p></p>

<p>Fellow student Shawn Brown, 18, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111119231213/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/gun_spree_kills_teen_qBf3p8g8CzF0hFGaoq2MTO?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">told the Post he had seen</a> the three friends shortly before gunfire broke out: &#x201C;We are all laughing and talking. We have no idea who did this to them.&#x201D; The shooting began in front of a Rite Aid at Flatlands Ave. and E. 79th Street; they were only four blocks away from South Shore High School&#x2019;s Theater Arts School, where they all attended. Jones was a junior basketball player for the school&apos;s South Shore Vikings.</p>

<p>Police <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111119231213/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2011/11/19/1-teen-killed-2-others-wounded-in-canarsie-shooting/">don&apos;t yet know</a> what motivated the shooting, which occurred just after school was let out yesterday. According to the News, there was an incident at a nearby bus stop&#x2014;in which someone fired shot scattering kids&#x2014;minutes before the three teens were shot. Kevin Williams, 13, was stunned by the events: &#x201C;They were good kids who never had problems with anyone in school,&#x201D; he said.</p>
