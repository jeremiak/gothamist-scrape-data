Jonathan Josey <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408153755/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/01/video_philly_cop_sucker_punches_wom.php">was caught on video sucker-punching</a> a woman in the face. The 19-year-veteran, who also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408153755/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/02/cop_who_sucker-punched_woman_teache.php">teaches &quot;violence prevention&quot;</a> to teenagers, was subsequently suspended <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408153755/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/04/cop_who_sucker-punched_woman_will_l.php">with intent to dismiss</a>. But his police union isn&apos;t letting him go out without some style: the Fraternal Order of Police <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408153755/http://www.philly.com/philly/news/20121012_FOP_plans_party_for_cop_fired_after_punching_woman.html">is hosting a $30-per-person benefit</a> for Josey on October 28th. <p></p>

<p>Josey&apos;s victim, 39-year-old Aida Guzman, was initially charged with disorderly conduct for allegedly throwing a beer bottle, but the District Attorney dropped all charges. Police Commissioner Charles Ramsey noted he was &quot;rather pleased that they did decide to drop the charges,&quot; and Mayor Michael Nutter apologized to the woman, saying he was &quot;appalled,&quot; &apos;&apos;sickened&quot; and &quot;ashamed&quot; by the video, which you can see below.</p>

<p>But FOP President John McNesby <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408153755/http://www.philly.com/philly/news/20121012_FOP_plans_party_for_cop_fired_after_punching_woman.html">told Philadelphia Daily News that he disagreed</a> with suggestions that the benefit is inappropriate: &quot;It was inappropriate for the city to apologize to this woman and drop the charges until the investigation was complete,&quot; McNesby said. &quot;And we still don&apos;t believe it&apos;s a fireable offense.&quot; City Councilwoman Maria Quinones-Sanchez had a very different view: &quot;You&apos;re kidding me, right?&quot; she said. &quot;While I understand that the FOP has to defend one of its own, I am extremely disappointed because this will appear that they are condoning the very visible actions of Josey, which hurts the image of their good officers.&quot;</p>
