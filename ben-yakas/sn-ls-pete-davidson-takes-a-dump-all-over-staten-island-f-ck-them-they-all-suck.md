<p>We really like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170723031003/http://gothamist.com/tags/snl"><em>Saturday Night Live&apos;s</em></a> resident young person Pete Davidson (seriously, he&apos;s 22, it makes no sense), who is already in his third year on the show. Despite the fact he only does one impression (a one second Al Pacino one), he&apos;s forged his own place at SNL mostly by exploiting his easygoing, weed-friendly shtick and sticking to his brutally honest stand-up persona. There is one topic of which Davidson is less-than-easygoing: his hometown of Staten Island. </p>

<p>Making fun of SI has become <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170723031003/http://www.silive.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2016/08/watch_pete_davidsons_not-half-.html">a major part</a> of his comedy routine, but it doesn&apos;t seem like it&apos;s just a joke. In a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170723031003/http://uproxx.com/filmdrunk/pete-davidson-interview/3/">revealing interview with Uproxx</a>, Davidson went to town on SI: &quot;F*ck them. They all suck. They have nothing to do with me or my success. It&#x2019;s a terrible borough, filled with terrible people. A f*cking tidal wave could take out Staten Island and I wouldn&#x2019;t even move in my sleep. In fact I would sleep better. F*ck Staten Island. A bunch of Trump-supporting f*cking jerk offs. F*ck them. End quote.&quot; </p>

<p>Davidson noted that his mother still lives there &quot;because she&#x2019;s too f*cking stupid to realize she shouldn&#x2019;t.&quot; He also vented about some of the people he grew up with there, and how almost ruined comedy for him: &quot;It&#x2019;s just hard to explain to people that you do stand up without them being f*cking f*ck faces about it. Yeah. It&#x2019;s annoying. It&#x2019;s like &#x201C;You do stand up, tell me a joke. You&#x2019;re not funny.&#x201D; People are c*nts. It&#x2019;s really difficult to do anything today. Everybody&#x2019;s such a f*cking c*nt,&quot; he said. &quot;It&#x2019;s like no matter, if you do anything that&#x2019;s not construction in Staten Island, you&#x2019;re a pussy for some reason.&quot;</p>

<p>He&apos;s been just as vicious about the Island in various stand-up routines: &quot;If you don&apos;t know what Staten Island is, it&apos;s like New York&apos;s abortion that lived,&quot; he said. &quot;There&apos;s good people everywhere, but not in Staten Island at all. Like everybody could die on Staten Island and I wouldn&apos;t lose sleep over it at all. I&apos;d be like, &apos;Oh, I guess I need to find a new Xanax dealer.&apos;&quot;</p>

In this clip from 2013, he added, &quot;It&apos;s this awful place where dreams die. I&apos;m from there, the only good thing we have are women sex offenders, I think that&apos;s awesome. It&apos;s actually why I still live there.&quot;</p>

The rest of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170723031003/http://uproxx.com/filmdrunk/pete-davidson-interview/3/">the Uproxx interview</a> is worth checking out, especially the parts about how he got the SNL job (thanks to a recommendation from Bill Hader), his views on being an SNL castmember (&quot;I really think I&#x2019;m a Make-A-Wish kid&quot;), his respect for Justin Bieber (&quot;If I was Justin Bieber, I would&#x2019;ve murdered five people already [and] been in jail.&quot;), and his many tattoos: &quot;The solar system. F*cking rubber ducks. F*cking Harry Potter symbols. My dad&#x2019;s helmet. My girlfriend&#x2019;s face. I got a wolf. A watermelon emoji. It goes on and on.&quot; </p>

<p>[That girlfriend, by the way, is Larry David&apos;s daughter.]</p>
