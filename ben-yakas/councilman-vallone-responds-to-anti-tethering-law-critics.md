<p>Since the &quot;tethering bill,&quot; which prohibits a pet from being tethered for more than three hours outside, was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111117101717/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/19/pet_tethering_bill_passes.php">signed</a> into law earlier this month, several pet (and owner) advocacy groups have been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111117101717/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/19/pet_advocacy_groups_not_thrilled_wi.php">calling for</a> its repeal.  Dog Federation of NY argued that the imprecise language of the law could &quot;criminalize the normal, everyday activities of caring pet and animal owners and could even drive events like the Westminster Kennel Club dog show out of Madison Square Garden.&quot; Councilman Peter Vallone, who introduced the bill, sent us a response to their criticisms:</p>

<p>&quot;No one listens to the head of that so called federation, even in animal rights circles, and as usual his reading of the bill is all wrong. Of course a family can tie up a dog at a picnic, just not for more than three hours straight.  If he would do that, he probably shouldn&apos;t be in the animal rights business in the first place. If he has any problem with the bill, he should talk to the legitimate animal rights groups like the ASPCA who helped draft it.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Vallone was responding to the Dog Federation&apos;s accusation that because of the vague language of the bill, &quot;it appears that families bringing their dog to the park for a picnic are prohibited from tying the dog&apos;s leash to a bench or picnic table while they enjoy their meal.&quot; We&apos;ve contacted the Dog Federation for any response, but this dog fight is swiftly starting to sound more like a cat fight. </p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: Mahlon Goer, spokeswoman for the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111117101717/http://www.dogfederationofnewyork.blogspot.com/">Dog Federation</a>, wrote us to respond to Vallone&apos;s criticism:</p>

<blockquote>Councilman Vallone&#x2019;s focus should be on increasing the health and safety of the community in accordance with the fact-based guidelines set forth by Centers For Disease Control and the American Veterinary Medical Association -- neither of which support anti-tethering measures, much less NYC&apos;s garbled new law.
 
It is imperative that we protect our children and communities with laws based on facts, not fear. Councilman Vallone consistently used misinformation as a calculated means to heighten public fears and misunderstanding, along with employing provocative language and negative stereotypes.  Int 425A--now 10/2011--is so poorly drafted, and uses such convoluted language, that NYC residents will not be able to understand its provisions and will not be able to comply.
 
Sure you can tie up a dog at a picnic -- as long as you use something with &quot;swivels&quot; at each end.  Leashes with &quot;swivels&quot; at each end?  Who&apos;s got one of those handy for a trip to the park, and why should they? </blockquote>
