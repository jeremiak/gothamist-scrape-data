<p>After parts of the city endured a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160216210658/http://gothamist.com/tags/flooding">flash flood</a> this week, there was another dramatic lightning storm last night that lit up the keychain skyline of Manhattan. While it wasn&apos;t quite as ominous as some other <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160216210658/http://gothamist.com/tags/lightning">lightning storms</a> we&apos;ve had this summer, it still provided good fodder to photographers. We&apos;ve selected our two favorite shots from the storm&#x2014;you can see one above and one below the jump.</p>

<p>As for the rest of the weekend, our weather widgets seem to be jumping back and forth between &quot;Apocalyptic rain&quot; and &quot;pleasantly sunny and mild.&quot; As of now, there may be more showers and lightning bolts reigning down upon the city later this evening&#x2014;but things look just lovely for the rest of the weekend otherwise, with temperatures in the mid-to-high 70s on Sunday.</p>
