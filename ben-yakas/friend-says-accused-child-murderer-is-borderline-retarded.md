<p>Aron called Barksy his &quot;best friend.&quot; according to court papers. Barksy is currently in Riker&apos;s after getting busted in April for driving a Plymouth van&#x2014;which was registered in Aron&apos;s name&#x2014;with a suspended license. Barksy said he thought Aron was too stupid to be able to successfully abduct, kidnap and kill Leiby. And anyway, Aron was too <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170223083022/http://gothamist.com/2011/07/15/levi_aron_recorded_karaoke_duets_on.php">obsessed with karaoke</a> and getting famous for such a heinous crime.</p>

<p>Barsky said Aron used to drive him to karaoke parties he would host, and Aron would occasionally try to emcee the gigs...but he was terrible at it. &quot;<strong>He has no personality. He had to learn how to talk to people</strong>...He loved to sing the songs, but he can&apos;t sing. He has a terrible voice!&quot; said Barksy. Aron particularly loved singing songs by Maroon 5 and Josh Groban, though his all-time favorite song is &quot;Time&quot; by Hootie &amp; the Blowfish.</p>

<p>And while Barksy says he &quot;loved the guy,&quot; and &quot;he was a good person,&quot; he has spent much of the past month in jail contemplating the tragic crime, and asking himself the same question again and again: &quot;Why did he kill the child?&quot;<br>
