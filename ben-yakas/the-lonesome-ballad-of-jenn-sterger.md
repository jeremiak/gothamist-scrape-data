title: The Lonesome Ballad Of Jenn Sterger

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:220px; "> <img alt="41011stergersterger.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110514091547im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/41011stergersterger.jpg" width="220" height="303"> <br> <i>Jenn Sterger!</i></div> Gather round people, wherever you roam, and hear this tale of boob jobs and woe: of a small town girl in a NY Jets world, who only wanted her own TV show. Through heartbreak and penis sexts she persevered, with nary an interview in sight. Here&apos;s the lonesome ballad of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110514091547/http://gothamist.com/tags/jennsterger">Jenn Sterger</a>, brings tears to a grown man&apos;s eyes: &quot;She obviously got a lot of mileage out of the implants, and it became a problem, professionally and personally. <strong>She wanted to be seen as Jenn, not as a chest.&quot;</strong><p></p>

<p>Sterger&apos;s former manager, Phil Reese, sat down for an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110514091547/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/how_brett_threw_gal_for_loss_N6Pn75rATMlTX2YjMSSEDK">exclusive interview with the Post</a> today, in which he recounts the behind-the-scenes tale of Sterger, the former Jets in-house sideline reporter who was embroiled in a sext scandal with Brett Favre all fall. Reese paints a portrait of a charismatic, ambitious girl who was plucked form obscurity when a TV camera noticed her, um, &quot;silicone 34Ds&quot; at a Florida State-University of Miami football game in 2005. The Jets created the &quot;game-day hostess&quot; position just for her, which entailed wearing &quot;cleavage-baring jerseys while reporting feature spots from the sidelines.&quot; </p>

<p>But Sterger grew tired of being thought of as only <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110514091547/http://gothamist.com/2010/06/09/sexy_banker_had_two_boob_jobs.php">&quot;tits on a stick.&quot;</a> She wrote in a Cosmopolitan magazine article, &quot;<strong>My boobs were not only the first thing some producers saw. They were also the only thing.</strong>&quot; She told Reese she wanted to get rid of them, and had ambitions to have her own TV show. Then, the Favre scandal, and the Deadspin story which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110514091547/http://gothamist.com/2010/10/08/alleged_brett_favre_nsfw_pics_emerg.php">blew it up</a>, happened, derailing all her plans. Reese advised her not to do any interviews, and alleged turned down $300,000 worth of offers for appearances with porn stars and such: &quot;Everyone said Jenn was in it for the exposure and the money. I thought, if she doesn&apos;t do any interviews and take any undignified deals, she can&apos;t be viewed like that.&quot;</p>

<p>In the end, the NFL waffled on the investigation into the sexual harassment claims, Favre was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110514091547/http://gothamist.com/2010/12/29/nfl_fines_doesnt_suspend_favre_for.php">only fined</a> $50,000 and quietly retired at the end of last season, and Sterger lost her job on the Versus network for bad ratings. She and Reese aren&apos;t working together, and she&apos;s suing him for the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110514091547/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/16/favre_sextual_accuser_sues_manager.php">&quot;Sterger materials&quot;</a>. She&apos;s also given her first interview since the scandal broke to Good Morning America; the two-part sitdown is set to air this Tuesday and Wednesday. A source alleges to the Post that in exchange, the network agreed to hook Sterger up with a TV job. But fun fact: Sterger now lives in Brooklyn! And is officially out of work! She&apos;s just like us! Maybe she&apos;s even a reader!</p>
