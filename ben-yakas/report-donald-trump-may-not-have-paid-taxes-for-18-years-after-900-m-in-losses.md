<p>According to a new report <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110104153/http://mobile.nytimes.com/2016/10/02/us/politics/donald-trump-taxes.html">in the New York Times today</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110104153/http://gothamist.com/tags/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> may have avoided paying federal income taxes for the last 18 years after he declared nearly a billion dollars in losses on his 1995 income tax returns.</p>

<p>The tax returns, which were verified by tax experts, reveal that Trump was able to take advantage of a loophole in the tax laws benefitting the most wealthy, using his $916 million loss to cancel out an equivalent amount of taxable income over the last two decades. To rub salt in the wounds, the Times writes that these extraordinary tax benefits were &quot;derived from the financial wreckage he left behind in the early 1990s through mismanagement of three Atlantic City casinos, his ill-fated foray into the airline business and his ill-timed purchase of the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan.&quot;</p>

<p>The report, which can be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110104153/http://mobile.nytimes.com/2016/10/02/us/politics/donald-trump-taxes.html">read in full here</a>, comes on the heels of last Monday night&apos;s debates, in which Hillary Clinton attacked Trump for not paying any federal income taxes (Trump interjected at the time, &quot;That makes me smart&quot;). Clinton&apos;s team said in a statement that the tax returns show the &#x201C;colossal nature of Donald Trump&#x2019;s past business failures. He stiffed small businesses, laid off workers, and walked away from hardworking communities. And how did it work out for him? He apparently got to avoid paying taxes for nearly two decades.&quot;</p>

Number one, I&apos;m a businessman. And that&apos;s the way you&apos;re supposed to do it. The other reason is that I hate the way our government spends our taxes. I hate the way they waste our money. Trillions and trillions of dollars of waste and abuse. And I hate it.&quot;</p>

<p>At a really in Pennsylvania last night, Trump didn&apos;t directly discuss his taxes, but he did apparently blow a fuse, taking 25 minutes to deliver a nine-sentence critique of Hillary Clinton due to frequent ramblings and rantings about everything from the state of movie culture to media bias. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110104153/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/10/02/as-news-of-trumps-taxes-broke-he-goes-off-script-at-a-rally-in-pennsylvania/">The Washington Post reports</a> that Trump &quot;kept going off on one angry tangent after another &#x2014; ignoring his teleprompters and accusing Clinton of not being &apos;loyal&apos; to her husband, imitating her buckling at a memorial service last month, suggesting that she is &apos;crazy&apos; and saying she should be in prison. He urged his mostly white crowd of supporters to go to polling places in &apos;certain areas&apos; on Election Day to &apos;watch&apos; the voters there. He also repeatedly complained about having a &quot;bum mic&quot; at the first presidential debate and wondered if he should have done another season of <em>The Apprentice.</em>&quot;</p>

<p>A few other lowlights from his rant, via the Post:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Although he seemingly meant to woo Bernie Sanders voters, Trump instead went off-script and mocked &quot;Crazy Bernie&quot; (saying that he has &#x201C;a much bigger movement than Bernie Sanders ever had&#x201D; and that he has &#x201C;much bigger crowds than Bernie Sanders ever had&#x201D;). </li>
	<li>He railed at the &#x201C;dopes at CNN&#x201D; and &#x201C;phony pundits&#x201D; for denying how well he was doing during the primaries: &quot;Then we started getting 52 percent, 58 percent, 66 percent, 78 percent, 82 percent,&quot; Trump said, not making clear what those numbers mean. &quot;And they just didn&#x2019;t understand what was going on.&quot;</li>
	<li>He claimed that he has a &#x201C;winning temperament&#x201D; while Clinton has &#x201C;bad temperament.&#x201D; Trump continued: &#x201C;She could be crazy. She could actually be crazy.&#x201D;</li>
	<li>&#x201C;How many people have acid-washed or bleached a tweet?&#x201D; Trump asked the crowd. &#x201C;How many? That you deleted? So you deleted it but that&#x2019;s not good enough. No, this is getting crazy. Our country is becoming a third-world country.&#x201D;</li>
	<li>&#x201C;You&#x2019;re unsuspecting,&#x201D; Trump said. &#x201C;Right now, you say to your wife: &#x2018;Let&#x2019;s go to a movie after Trump.&#x2019; But you won&#x2019;t do that because you&#x2019;ll be so high and so excited that no movie is going to satisfy you. Okay? No movie. You know why? Honestly? Because they don&#x2019;t make movies like they used to &#x2014; is that right?&#x201D;</li>
	<li>&#x201C;Oh, I could be doing the &#x2018;Apprentice&#x2019; right now,&#x201D; Trump said at one point, seeming to harken back to a happier time in his life. &#x201C;I loved it &#x2014; 14 seasons. How good was that? Tremendous success. They wanted to extend &#x2014; I could be doing the &#x2018;Apprentice&#x2019; now. Somehow I think this is a little bit more important. Do we agree? Just a little bit?&#x201D;</li>
</ul>

<p>Trump&apos;s team hasn&apos;t officially responded to the tax report, but they did release a statement praising him as &quot;highly skilled&quot; in <em>making the business:</em> &quot;Mr. Trump is a highly skilled businessman who has a fiduciary responsibility to his business, his family and his employees to pay no more tax than legally required,&#x201D; the statement said. &quot;That being said, Mr. Trump has paid hundreds of millions of dollars in property taxes, sales and excise taxes, real-estate taxes, city taxes, state taxes, employee taxes and federal taxes. Mr. Trump knows the tax code far better than anyone who has ever run for president and he is the only one that knows how to fix it.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Trump&apos;s most debased surrogates made like spinning tops this morning and tried to slant the damning report in their candidate&apos;s favor:</p>
