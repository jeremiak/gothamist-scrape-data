<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140226195710/http://gothamist.com/tags/billdeblasio">Mayor Bill de Blasio</a> has been taking a lot of heat ever since a few inches of snow <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140226195710/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/22/de_blasios_snow_ues.php">threatened to completely destroy the fabric of life on the Upper East Side</a> this week. De Blasio <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140226195710/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/22/de_blasio_very_sorry_that_the_ues_w.php">has since apologized</a> for not doing more to help clean up the UES, but at least one prominent Brooklyn councilman thinks that UES residents just need to grow a pair: &quot;The people on the Upper East Side, quite frankly, they&apos;re complainers,&quot; said councilman David Greenfield on his radio show. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140226195710/http://politicker.com/2014/01/david-greenfield-thinks-upper-east-siders-complain-too-much-about-snow/">Politciker has more</a> of what Greenfield said:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;You know they&#x2019;re not used to this idea that we&#x2019;re gonna share resources in New York City,&#x201D; declared Mr. Greenfield.  &#x201D;So then you have the streets that are passable, but they weren&#x2019;t what I would call &#x2018;lickable.&#x2019; They couldn&#x2019;t eat off the streets. They said, &#x2018;Oy vey, there&#x2019;s a little bit of ice on the street.&#x2019;&#x201D;

<p>&#x201C;Do me a favor, we&#x2019;ve been contending with ice on our street for the last hundred years,&#x201D; he continued. &#x201C;So you&#x2019;re finally getting some equity which means that the resources are being spread around, but this really didn&#x2019;t leave them alone. There certainly was no scandal that was involved and the mayor, to his credit,&#x201D; he added, paid a visited to the neighborhood on Wednesday afternoon &#x201C;to show them that he cared about them.&#x201D;</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>De Blasio again defended himself against snow accusations during a press conference today announcing new appointments: &quot;I&apos;m not here to analyze mindsets, I will tell you the facts: first of all we know something went wrong with the PlowNYC system,&quot; de Blasio said. &quot;The problem is when it malfunctions, as it did&#x2014;that is a fact&#x2014;it gives people the wrong impression... We need to understand in real time that some kind of glitch had occurred in the distribution of the trucks.&quot;</p>

<p>He adamantly stressed that no boroughs or areas of the city were favored over others in terms of where plows were directed. &quot;The reports that I received from the UES and things I saw myself&#x2014;we have to do better,&quot; de Blasio said. &quot;When I hear those kind of concerns and they&apos;re that persistent and that consistent, you will see me go there myself...What we said from the very beginning is that we&apos;re going to treat all five boroughs the same and all neighborhoods the same.&quot;</p>

<p>Even if the Upper East Side and Staten Island, where many side streets were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140226195710/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20140124/new-dorp/staten-island-streets-still-buried-48-hours-after-snowstorm-residents-say">seemingly unplowed 48 hours after the storm</a>, might not feel like they&apos;ve been treated quite the same, it could be worse.</p>
