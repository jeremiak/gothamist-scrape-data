<p>An on-duty Sanitation worker was killed yesterday after being hit by a street sweeper. Police say that 43-year-old Stephen Frosch was performing maintenance work on a NYC Department of Sanitation street sweeper inside of a Sanitation Depot in Queens when another street sweeper, operated by a 33-year old Sanitation worker, was driving forward and struck him around 1 p.m., pinning him in between the two vehicles.</p>

<p>Frosh, who had been with the Sanitation Department since 1999, was pronounced dead at the scene. No arrests have been made and the investigation is ongoing. &quot;Sanitation work is very dangerous and difficult work and we appreciate those who accept the call to duty,&quot; said Sanitation commissioner Kathryn Garcia <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504134329/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Sanitation-Worker-Killed-in-Accident-with-Street-Sweeper-Strongest-58th-Road-47th-Street-264112501.html">in a statement</a>. &quot;Our hearts go out to the Frosch family on their loss.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We are deeply saddened to learn of the loss of one of New York&apos;s Strongest today while on the job in service of our city,&quot; said Mayor de Blasio in a statement. &quot;Our thoughts and prayers are with Steven Frosch&apos;s family&#x2014;especially his wife and four children&#x2014;as well as his friends and fellow sanitation workers.&quot;</p>
