<p>Two Connecticut high school football players <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130519161916/http://www.registercitizen.com/articles/2013/03/20/news/doc51493e14b1a0a944806262.txt">have been accused</a> of sexually assaulting a 13-year-old girl. Torrington High School football players <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130519161916/https://twitter.com/KiddFreshSmoove">Edgar Gonzalez</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130519161916/https://twitter.com/JoanToribio3">Joan Toribio</a>, both 18, were arrested at the end of February for the Feb 10th incident, and charged with felony second-degree sexual assault. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130519161916/http://espn.go.com/college-sports/football/recruiting/player/combine/_/id/164126/joan-toribio">Toribio</a> has also been charged in another alleged sexual assault case. In the weeks since the two players were arrested, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130519161916/http://www.registercitizen.com/articles/2013/03/20/news/doc51493e14b1a0a944806262.txt">the Register Citizen reports that</a> multiple classmates and observers have gone on Twitter and Facebook to bully the alleged victim, saying things like, &quot;I wanna know why there&apos;s no punishment for young hoes&quot; and &quot;Young girls acting like whores there&apos;s no punishment for that young boys acting like boys is a sentence.&quot;</p>

<p>While many of those Twitter users above have either deleted their accounts of made them private since the Citizen published their tweets, at least one has spent most of the day defending himself:</p>

<p>Both Gonzalez and Toribio have pleaded not guilty to the charges (you can see <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130519161916/http://www.registercitizen.com/articles/2013/03/20/news/doc514938953d8b2006726659.txt">the official arrest reports here</a>). Gonzalez&#x2019;s lawyer, J. Patten Brown III, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130519161916/http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/torrington-conn-football-players-charged-with-sexually-assaulting-13-year-old-girl/2013/03/20/6c46c45e-916e-11e2-9173-7f87cda73b49_story.html">told the Washington Post</a> that the allegations against his client appear to involve consensual, but statutorily illegal, sex. Gonzalez is being held at New Haven Correction Center, while Toribio is out on $50,000 professional surety bond. Toribio is being electronically monitored. </p>

<p>Gonzalez and three other Torrington football players were suspended after being embroiled in a hazing scandal last year that is still under investigation; Gonzalez was also charged for alleged felony robbery in March 2012 after he and three others allegedly jumped three 14-year-olds. Despite those charges, Gonzalez was allowed to continue playing football in 2012; former head coach Dan Dunaj defended his decision to the Citizen: &#x201C;I reeled the kid in after that, and he walked the line. As a coach I was doing something right.&#x201D; <br>
 <br>
Athletic Director Mike McKenna also defended the program: &#x201C;If you think there&#x2019;s some wild band of athletes that are wandering around then I think you&#x2019;re mistaken. If you look at crime statistics these things happen everywhere and we&#x2019;re not any different than any other community,&#x201D; said McKenna.</p>

<p>This news comes less than a week after two teens in Ohio <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130519161916/http://sports.yahoo.com/news/highschool--steubenville-high-school-football-players-found-guilty-of-raping-16-year-old-girl-164129528.html">were found guilty</a> of raping a 16-year-old girl; in that case, two young women <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130519161916/http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/she-the-people/wp/2013/03/20/steubenville-ohio-rape-victim-threatened-by-mean-girls/">were charged with harassing the victim</a> online.</p>
