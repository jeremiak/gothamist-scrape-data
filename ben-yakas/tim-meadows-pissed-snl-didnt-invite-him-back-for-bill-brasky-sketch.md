<p>The biggest surprise on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428175532/http://gothamist.com/2013/12/08/videos_paul_rudd_gets_snl_assist_fr.php#photo-1"><em>Saturday Night Live</em> last night</a> wasn&apos;t the cold open with Kristen Wiig, nor the cast of <em>Anchorman</em> joining Rudd and One Direction to sing &quot;Afternoon Delight,&quot; nor the fact that the new cast members were barely seen. It was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428175532/http://gothamist.com/2013/12/08/videos_paul_rudd_gets_snl_assist_fr.php#photo-11">the return of Bill Brasky</a>, a classic late &apos;90s SNL sketch that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428175532/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Brasky">hasn&apos;t appeared since 1998.</a> But at least one person wasn&apos;t happy about this: SNL alumnus Tim Meadows, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428175532/https://www.facebook.com/tim.meadows.31?fref=ts">who took to Facebook</a> to complain about not being invited back for the sketch.</p>

<p>Meadows, who appeared in four out of the five times the sketch was aired (not counting last night) between 1996-1998, wrote about how disappointed he was that SNL didn&apos;t ask him to come back: &quot;I guess it just dawned on me that I mean NOTHING to them...I&apos;m just being overly sensitive. It doesn&apos;t matter in the long run. I&apos;m grateful for what they did for me. But everyone in a while as a fan and a alumni, it stings a little to not even be considered as someone they would like to come back around.&quot; He followed this by saying, &quot;I will never watch SNL again&quot; and &quot;Fuck them.&quot;</p>

<p>At one point, he even blamed the snub on his failed SNL movie <em>The Ladies Man.</em> However, he calmed down a little while later, writing, &quot; feel better and after a Mimosa I take back everything I said before!&quot; Chris Rock even chimed in at one point and asked what was wrong: &quot;Chris Rock they did a sketch without me. No big deal...&quot;</p>
