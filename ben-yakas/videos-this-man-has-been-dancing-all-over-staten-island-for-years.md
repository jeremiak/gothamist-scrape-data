<p>Even if it doesn&apos;t always loom as large as some of the other boroughs, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140221141932/http://gothamist.com/tags/statenisland">Staten Island</a> has always been packed full of colorful characters, from Bozo The Clown to the Wu Tang Clan to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140221141932/http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2008/09/actor_paul_newmans_dramatic_ro.html">Paul Newman</a>. But there is only one local legend who has continually delighted residents through interpretive dance for the past several years: Joel Joseph, aka Joe The Dancing Guy of SI.</p>

<p>&quot;I dance because I love to feel good,&quot; Joseph <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140221141932/http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2011/06/the_spry_who_came_in_from_the.html">told SILive in 2011</a>. &quot;I love to express myself. I love to inspire others as well.&quot; He has more than 4,500 likes <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140221141932/https://www.facebook.com/pages/Dancing-Black-Man-of-Staten-Island/183929074987582">on his Facebook page</a>&#x2014;and despite that page being mostly inactive since he was written about in 2011, Joseph has never stopped dancing. He was spotted this week, as you can see in the video below.</p>

<p>Joseph is actually from East Flatbush, but he noted he never dances there, preferring the warm embrace of SI: &quot;I live in a negative environment. People are very judgmental and nasty,&quot; he said. &quot;That&apos;s why I travel, to get away from the negativity.&quot; Check out more videos of the notorious dancing man from the past three years below: </p>
