<p>The Mets had a rough night yesterday during a 4-0 loss to the Philadelphia Phillies at Citi Field, but it probably wasn&apos;t as rough a night for them as it was for home plate umpire Brian O&apos;Nora. O&apos;Nora suddenly ran off the field with two outs and a runner on second base in the bottom of the first, resulting in a subsequent 14 minute game delay. And he reportedly left because he was vomiting&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426153508/http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/mlb-big-league-stew/umpire-brian-o-nora-leaves-game-reportedly-swallowing-085637761.html">due to swallowing</a> his chewing tabacco. </p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426153508/http://online.wsj.com/article/APa2497e77bfc84eee81ded583187fa232.html">official story</a> is that O&apos;Nora had &quot;flulike&quot; symptoms. &quot;Brian O&apos;Nora got very ill,&quot; Mets manager Terry Collins later said. &quot;It came on very fast. He came to the dugout because he was going to be sick to his stomach and certainly was. He couldn&apos;t go back out.&quot; But <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426153508/http://hardballtalk.nbcsports.com/2013/04/26/mets-phillies-game-delayed-because-umpire-brian-onora-swallowed-his-chew/?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter">Mets beat writers</a> claimed it was the chew. You can see video of O&apos;Nora suddenly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426153508/http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20130426&amp;content_id=45861576&amp;notebook_id=45875644&amp;vkey=notebook_nym&amp;c_id=nym">running off the field here</a>; the Mets in the dugout <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426153508/http://www.buzzfeed.com/erikmalinowski/vomiting-umpire-delays-game-after-swallowing-his-chew">look more amused than anything.</a></p>

<p>Regardless of what caused his illness, we truly hope O&apos;Nora is feeling better today. And maybe is reconsidering his stance on chewing tobacco.</p>
