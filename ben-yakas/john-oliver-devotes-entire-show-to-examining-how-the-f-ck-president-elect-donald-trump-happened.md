										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="111316oliver.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170718223738im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/111316oliver.jpg" width="640" height="417" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>&quot;It turns out that instead of showing our daughters that they could someday be president, America proved that no grandpa is too racist to become leader of the free world,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170718223738/http://gothamist.com/tags/johnoliver">John Oliver</a> said as he started off last night&apos;s very special election &amp; depression-themed episode of <em>Last Week Tonight</em>. For (we believe) the first time ever, there was no second story or cut-aways to short bits like &quot;How Is This Still A Thing&quot;&#x2014;the whole episode was devoted to parsing the results of the election and the coronation of President Wombat (&quot;A human what-is-wrong-with-this-picture&quot;). </p>

<p>Before he gets into the specifics of Trump&apos;s policies (or, &quot;Satan&apos;s to-do list from his refrigerator&quot;), Oliver tries to figure out... what happened: &quot;For the rest of us, we are faced with the same questions as a guy that woke up the day after a Vegas bachelor party deep in the desert, naked, tied to a cactus and a dead clown. Namely, how the fuck did we get here, and what the fuck do we do now?&quot;</p>

<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170718223738if_/https://www.youtube.com/embed/-rSDUsMwakI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>&quot;How the fuck did we get here?&quot; Oliver asks again. &quot;Well clearly, there are many possible answers to that question, including misleading forecasts that bred complacency, a flawed candidate who failed to appeal to white, rural and working-class voters, and, this is worth repeating, deep racism and/or indifference to it.&quot; He focuses on the failures of the media (as well as the elegance of DeWalt ladders), the pervasive spread of fake news, the sadness of Ted Cruz, Mike Fucking Pence (&quot;He looks like he&apos;s from the 1950s, but he thinks like he&apos;s from the 1650s&quot;), and the importance of &quot;actual sacrifice&quot; to support people under threat by a Trump administration. </p>

<p>&quot;It is going to be too easy for things to start feeling normal&#x2014;especially if you are someone who is not directly impacted by his actions&#x2014;so keep reminding yourself, this is not normal,&quot; Oliver pleads toward the end. &quot;A Klan-backed misogynist Internet troll is going to be delivering the next State Of The Union address, and that is not normal, that is fucked up. The only thing that gives me one degree of comfort is that part of Trump might be realizing that now too.&quot; </p>

<p>The episode ends with an explosive ode to how terrible 2016 has been, featuring Larry David, Amy Schumer, Kathy Griffin, Weird Al Yankovic, Jeffrey Tambor, Billy Eichner, Larry Wilmore, Nick Offerman and Megan Mullally.</p>

<p>After the episode aired, the show tweeted out a bunch of links to different organizations worth supporting in this new normal:</p>
