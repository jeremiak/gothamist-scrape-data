<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:234px; "> <img alt="2010_05_raykelly2.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110916223409im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2010_05_raykelly2.jpg" width="234" height="245"> <br> <i>Photograph from the Mayor&apos;s Office</i></div> Is Police Commissioner Ray Kelly thinking of running for Mayor in 2013? The evidence is mounting in that direction: he has the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110916223409/http://gothamist.com/2010/02/19/nypd_commissioner_is_more_popular_t.php">approval ratings</a> to back him, a close relationship with the current Mayor and administration, and the occasional incandescent PR <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110916223409/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/17/ray_kelly_rescues_damsel_in_distres_1.php">moment</a> or two. And a major <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110916223409/http://nymag.com/news/crimelaw/66025/">profile</a> in this week&apos;s <em>NY Magazine</em> lends even more credence to the idea, as it contributes a sweeping portrait of the Dunkin&apos; Donuts- and iPad-loving, former Marine Corps. veteran who &quot;radiates power.&quot;<p></p>

<p>The profile paints Kelly as a micromanaging General, one whose style is to &quot;control everything he can control&quot; (a spiritual cousin to Bloomberg&apos;s business-management credo). He runs the NYPD with militaristic zeal which has both its proponents&#x2014;Thomas Reppetto, author of <em>NYPD: A City and Its Police</em>, calls him &quot;<strong>the greatest police commissioner in the history of the city</strong>. He invented the playbook on terrorism from scratch&quot;&#x2014;and detractors&#x2014;the NYCLU&apos;s Donna Lieberman  calls him &quot;Master of PR&quot; and says the NYPD &quot;<strong>has taken on the aura of an occupying force</strong>.&quot; Former detectives fear speaking out against him, let alone current ones (&quot;he has a long arm&quot; one unidentified officer said), and police leaks are hunted down unmercifully (&quot;<strong>Among rank-and-file cops, talking to a reporter has become a career-ending liability</strong>.&quot;) </p>

<p>Then there are the points that nod toward his Mayoral-aspirations: details on his nonprofit New York City Police Foundation that funds many of his projects (including his CIA-like International Liaison Program) and hired marketing company HL Group in 2007 ostensibly to revamp the NYPD&apos;s (and maybe burnish Kelly&apos;s) image for $8,500/month. And there are reports of meetings with Republican strategist Scott Reed last year before Bloomberg decided to run for a third term&#x2014;while NYPD spokesman Paul Browne claims Kelly and Reed just bumped into each other one, &quot;a source close to Reed says the two met at the behest of a mutual friend &apos;to see what [a campaign] might look like.&apos;&quot; </p>
