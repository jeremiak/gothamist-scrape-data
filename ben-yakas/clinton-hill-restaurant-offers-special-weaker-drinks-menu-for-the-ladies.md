<p>Ladies love to booze just as much as any other gender, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429154904/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/21/ladies_love_to_booze.php">that&apos;s just pure science</a>. But one Clinton Hill Mexican joint thinks ladies need to pace themselves with their own watered-down drink menu, featuring less potent beverages. Is this <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429154904/http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2012/10/the-weaker-sex/309094/">1903</a>?  </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429154904/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20140604/clinton-hill/clinton-hill-restaurant-has-separate-less-boozy-drinks-menu-for-ladies">DNAInfo reports</a> that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429154904/http://www.lospollitos3.com/">Los Pollitos III</a> has unveiled a new menu (you can see it below) that specifically separates &quot;light alcoholic&quot; drinks (glass of wine, Kalhua &amp; Cream, Bailey&apos;s, Alize) &quot;FOR LADIES,&quot; alcohol for &quot;EVERYONE,&quot; and extra alcohol &quot;FOR MEN.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;The idea was to make people laugh,&quot; manager Marcos Merino, who takes credit for the new menu, explained. &quot;People get excited about the menu and have fun with it.&quot; Anyone can order anything, according to bartender Leo Vasquez, but, &quot;A lot of times ladies don&apos;t like to have the strong stuff so this menu is for them.&quot;</p>

<p>While the restaurant&apos;s attempts at humor seem to us be leaning more toward insulting, outdated gender stereotypes, some think this is a step in the right direction (assuming that the right direction would include wearing a corset while making <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429154904/http://gothamist.com/2014/05/20/300_sandwiches_1.php">300 sandwiches</a>):</p>

<blockquote>But Leo Jackson, who works at Salon de Lafayette in SOHO and has eaten at the restaurant many times, thinks Los Pollitos has the right idea.

<p>&quot;It makes sense,&quot; Jackson, 34, said. &quot;It&apos;s women who get so inebriated that they pass out and stumble around. It&apos;s safer for them to have drinks with less alcohol.&quot;</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>However, Jackson might be confusing real life with Judd Apatow movies:</p>
