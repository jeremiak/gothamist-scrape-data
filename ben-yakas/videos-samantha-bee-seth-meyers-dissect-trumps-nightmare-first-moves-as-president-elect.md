<p>We are a week away from the election, and the stress, anxiety and real-world consequences for our nation seem darker than at any other point in our lifetimes. It&apos;s nearly impossible to take the major TV news networks seriously after a year of capitulating to and normalizing Donald Trump, but at least there are a few late night comedians who can put a weary smile on our faces as we contemplate things like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170925131536/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/14/steve_bannon_trump_strategist.php">White Supremacist Karl Rove</a> and Secretary of State Rudy Giuliani.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170925131536/http://gothamist.com/tags/samanthabee">Samantha Bee</a> laid it out on <em>Full Frontal</em> last night: &quot;This cabinet list isn&#x2019;t just a liberal&#x2019;s nightmare. A liberal&#x2019;s nightmare is running out of almond milk at a brunch party,&quot; said Bee. &quot;This is a nightmare for anyone who thinks job candidates should have relevant experience and education beyond the qualification of being named Steve.&quot;</p>

<p>Bee also addressed the &quot;sore winners&quot; who won&apos;t acknowledge racism:</p>

<p>The episode ended with a minute of escapism spent with Jon Stewart, who is now &quot;quite an odd person.&quot;</p>

<p>Seth Meyers had a similar view of the last week: &quot;Well, we gave him a chance. Bye, chance! Thanks for stopping by! Good to see you chance!&quot; Meyers said, getting into Trump&apos;s attacks on the free press, the normalization of Trump by the mainstream networks, and the horrors of Steve Bannon. &quot;A quick side note to everyone referring to Bannon as &#x2018;controversial&apos;&#x2014;he&#x2019;s not &#x2018;controversial,&#x2019; he&#x2019;s a white nationalist and an anti-Semite,&quot; Meyers said. &quot;Don&#x2019;t talk about him like he&#x2019;s pineapple on pizza.&quot;</p>
