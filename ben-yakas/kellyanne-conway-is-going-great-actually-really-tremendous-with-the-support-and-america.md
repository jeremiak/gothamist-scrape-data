<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171023114325/http://gothamist.com/tags/kellyanneconway">Kellyanne Conway</a> has been one of the lynchpins of Trump&apos;s path to the White House, the truth-averse Abbott to his germ-averse Costello, the sycophantic Hildy Johnson to his egomaniacal Walter Burns, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171023114325/https://twitter.com/KellyannePolls/status/831566360153042944">Anastasia Steele to his Christian Grey.</a> But the wheels on the Kellyanne Bus seem to be coming apart before our very eyes over the last week, which included her bumbling of the Flynn debacle, retweeting White Supremacists, and being denounced by the country&apos;s major ethics watchdog group&#x2014;and culminating today in her being banned from <em>Morning Joe</em>, of all places, because of her inability to give a straight answer.<br>
 <br>
While Conway has been praised at times for her verbal jiu-jitsu and ability to deflect any question like a flaxen-haired mirror, she maybe has gotten <em>too</em> good at not saying anything real. While the hosts of <em>Morning Joe</em> have been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171023114325/http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/12/joe-and-mika-defend-themselves-against-the-haters">more chummy with Trump</a> than most journalists (are early morning TV pundits really journalists? A question for another day), they reached their limit with Conway&apos;s evasive style, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171023114325/http://variety.com/2017/tv/news/morning-joe-kellyanne-conway-mika-brzezinski-1201989126/">with Mika Brzezinski saying</a> she is no longer credible and will no longer appear on the show.</p>

<p>&quot;We know for a fact that she tries to book herself on this show. I won&#x2019;t do it because I don&#x2019;t believe in fake news or information that isn&#x2019;t true. Every time I&#x2019;ve ever seen her on television something&#x2019;s askew, off or incorrect,&quot; Brzezinski said. Joe Scarborough <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171023114325/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/02/15/morning-joe-has-blacklisted-kellyanne-conway-and-thats-not-all/?utm_term=.797ba1047c07">supported the banishment</a>, saying that his sources tell him, &quot;She&#x2019;s in none of the key meetings. She goes out and books herself often...I don&#x2019;t even think she&#x2019;s saying something that she knows to be untrue. She&#x2019;s just saying things, just to get in front of the TV set and prove her relevance, because behind the scenes, she&#x2019;s not in these meetings.&quot;</p>

<p>Based on recent reports, Scarborough&apos;s sources may be correct: in a long piece about Sean Spicer&apos;s future in the White House, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171023114325/http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/15/politics/sean-spicer-white-house/index.html">CNN reported that</a> Conway has been in something of a power struggle with Spicer for Trump&apos;s ear. Writing about leaks regarding the press secretary&apos;s imminent demise, they said:</p>

<blockquote>Many people sympathetic to Spicer in and out of the White House believe otherwise. Five of these sources think the person behind the leaks is Kellyanne Conway, Trump&apos;s ever-visible White House counselor. Though they offer no hard evidence, they say Conway is trying to offload blame for administration setbacks on Spicer to prove she is the more effective public advocate and earn a lasting place in the President&apos;s inner circle.

<p>&quot;She&apos;s clearly guiding a press narrative that he&apos;s not up for the job, and that they&apos;re reviewing other candidates,&quot; one GOP strategist said. &quot;It&apos;s becoming abundantly clear that Kellyanne is making Sean&apos;s job impossible.&quot;</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>Conway of course denied any such animosity or any role in the leaks, and added that she&apos;s been planning to &quot;reduce [her] television exposure&quot; for some time now&#x2014;it just happens that this decision came after multiple disastrous morning news show appearances, including the one in which Matt Lauer said <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171023114325/http://gothamist.com/2017/02/14/kellyanne_conway_start_making_sense.php">she made no sense:</a></p>

<p>Conway&apos;s decision to step back from the spotlight comes amidst several other damaging incidents, most prominently with the federal government&#x2019;s chief ethics watchdog <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171023114325/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/14/us/politics/Kellyanne-Conway-ivanka-trump-ethics.html">writing a letter to the White House</a> saying that her public endorsement of Ivanka Trump&#x2019;s product line appears to be &quot;a clear violation of the prohibition against misuse of position.&quot; Even Utah Congressman Jason Chaffetz, chairman of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, called Conway&apos;s endorsement &quot;wrong, wrong, wrong&quot; and he called on the ethics office to investigate, and that guy doesn&apos;t think <em>anything</em> is too <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171023114325/http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/2/14/14609850/gop-investigators-wont-investigate-michael-flynn">unethical that it can&apos;t fix itself.</a></p>

<p>And to top everything off, the originator of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171023114325/http://gothamist.com/tags/bowlinggreenmassacre">Bowling Green Massacre</a> retweeted a White Supremacist account on Twitter, and even responded, &quot;Love you back&quot; while wishing her &quot;Hapless Haters&quot; a Happy Valentine&#x2019;s Day yesterday. When BuzzFeed pointed all this out to her, she was quick to pull a Conway and spin things as she liked:</p>

<blockquote>Conway told BuzzFeed News on Tuesday, &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t know who had access to my account.&#x201D;

<p>&#x201C;Let me see who tweeted that,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;That&#x2019;s terrible.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Conway said she had &#x201C;obviously&#x201D; never heard of Lib Hypocrisy.</p>

<p>&#x201C;I denounce whoever it is,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;It will be immediately deleted. Everybody makes mistakes.&#x201D;</p>

<p>After the conversation, Conway deleted the tweet.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>If Conway feels like she can&apos;t take the abuse that comes with constantly and unabashedly spouting lies to defend her demonstrably delusional and evil boss, she could always <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171023114325/http://gothamist.com/2017/02/15/more_like_puzderp_amirite.php">pull a Puzder.</a><br>
