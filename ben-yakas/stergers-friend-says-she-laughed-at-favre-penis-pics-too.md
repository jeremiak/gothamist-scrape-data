										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:250px; "> <img alt="102710torres.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150121053930im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/102710torres.jpg" width="250" height="167"> <br> <i>Allison Torres</i></div> There comes a time in every great unsubstantiated sext messaging controversy when the pursuit of truth falls to the wayside, and the buxom, corset-wearing vultures swoop in for a piece of the media pie. And we&apos;re ok with that, because every time another person alleges to have seen grandfather <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150121053930/http://gothamist.com/tags/brettfavre">Brett Favre&apos;s</a> naked penis in a picture message, a Green Bay Packers fan gets their wings.<p></p>

<p>Today, occasional <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150121053930/http://www.thesmokingjacket.com/entertainment/ballbreaker-allison-torres-jersey-shore-edition">Jersey Shore blogger</a> Allison Torres told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150121053930/http://so-mag.com/">Steppin&apos; Out magazine</a> that she also saw the alleged text messages Favre sent former Jets in-house reporter Jenn Sterger: &quot;<strong>I actually saw it when he sent it. We just laughed when he did it.</strong>..We talked about it like girlfriends talk about that kind of stuff. You have to understand that Brett Favre isn&apos;t the first celebrity that tried to hook up with her.&quot; Torres, who writes a column for Steppin&apos; Out, was friends with Sterger from their days at Florida State together. Torres <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150121053930/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/national/brett_lookers_DPFOE7E78w69JYQKn9Sk4I?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">also alleges</a> that Favre and Sterger were texting each other quite a lot, and that it wasn&apos;t as one-sided as reports have made it seem so far: &quot;<strong>I just know they kept texting each other back and forth and that he wanted to he wanted to hook up. I wouldn&apos;t doubt she was enjoying the attention from him</strong>...I did think that was kind of weird. He would say to her, &apos;Come over.&apos; She would keep saying to me, &apos;I don&apos;t know what to do.&apos; &quot;</p>

<p>Favre <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150121053930/http://gothamist.com/2010/10/24/report_favre_admits_to_leaving_voic.php">admitted</a> to NFL officials last week that he did leave voicemails for Sterger, but denies sending any text messages, including ones where he allegedly was masturbating while wearing a pair of Crocs. This has caused no small amount of uproar in the league, although surprisingly, some of his biggest supporters have been female Packer fans, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150121053930/http://www.esquire.com/the-side/feature/brett-favre-scandal-reaction-102510">as Esquire reports</a>: &quot; &apos;I know how women can be, and she&apos;s lying,&apos; Ashley says of Favre&apos;s accuser. Even if she isn&apos;t, &apos;So what?&apos; Sipping her drink, Ashley suggests that the NFL mind its football. &apos;It should be like the separation of church and state.&apos; &quot;</p>

<p>There have been other ramifications for Favre&apos;s behavior, besides Sterger <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150121053930/http://gothamist.com/2010/10/26/sterger_lost_nine_pounds_on_the_sex.php">losing weight</a> and Deanna Favre <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150121053930/http://gothamist.com/2010/10/21/deanna_favre_chooses_faith_over.php">selling</a> some more books: there has been increased attention on the fragility of NFL marriages, and as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150121053930/http://jezebel.com/5674506/inventive-nfl-wives-start-anti+cheating-club">Deadspin reports</a>, there are even anti-cheating clubs for wives of NFL players. But Torres just thinks Favre is a unique &quot;dopey, dopey character:&quot; &quot;I don&apos;t know what else to say&#x2014;even when they were talking back and forth, I was wondering what he was thinking. <strong>It was so risky to do what he did. When you send naked pictures of yourself to a 20-year-old girl, you&apos;re just asking for trouble.&quot;</strong></p>
