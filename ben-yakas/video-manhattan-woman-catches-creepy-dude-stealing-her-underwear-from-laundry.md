<p>When a Manhattan woman noticed that some of her underwear was missing from her laundry recently, she asked her building superintendent if she could look at the surveillance video from the laundry room. And you can see what Kips Bay resident Elisabeth Santana discovered in the video below: a creepy dude checking her out, waiting for her to leave the room, then rifling through her laundry. Doesn&apos;t he know there are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130511001639/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/15/panty_profiteer_spills_secrets_of_t.php">professionals who could help him with his needs</a>?</p>

<p>&quot;It&apos;s strange for me to watch this video and see he&apos;s looking through my personal clothes,&quot; Santana <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130511001639/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Laundry-Underwear-Thief-Surveillance-Video-Kips-Bay-Manhattan-Apartment-Building-201359711.html">told NBC about</a> the panty pilferer. &quot;I was completely grossed out. The fact that it happened in my building, I felt unsafe and violated.&quot; Other surveillance footage indicated the man didn&apos;t live in the building; Santana&apos;s superintendent also told her other buildings in the area have seen similar laundry thefts, where the perp was targeting women&apos;s laundry.</p>

<p>Santana says she plans on postering the panty pilferers face around the neighborhood in hopes of someone catching him. But what if the man in the surveillance video is just a patsy, set up to take the fall for a nefarious organization who has their eyes set on some serious underwear profit?</p>
