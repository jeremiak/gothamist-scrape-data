<p>Everyone knows that although you might never get rich hanging around the car wash, it certainly is better than digging a ditch. This is Car Wash Philosophy 101 stuff, very basic. But for one NYC woman, the car wash was almost turned into a permanent ditch: a woman was run over by her own car in a freak accident at a Bronx car wash Saturday.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150912235423/http://nypost.com/2014/05/18/woman-run-over-by-own-vehicle-at-car-wash/">According to the Post</a>, 35-year-old nurse Rita Gazivoda took her Audi convertible to the Riverdale Car Wash on Tibetts Avenue yesterday. Gazivoda, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150912235423/http://www.linkedin.com/pub/rita-gazivoda-rn/2a/8ab/45b">who is</a> a Clinical Research Nurse Specialist at Weill Cornell Medical College, was standing next to her car as workers cleaned its interior when the car behind her, a silver Jeep Liberty, suddenly sped forward after an employee accidentally hit the gas. The Jeep hit her Audi, which in turn hit her.</p>

<p>&quot;She was screaming, yelling, &apos;Help! Help!&apos; You could tell she was in pain,&quot; Jerry Pacheco, who owns the Jeep, told the Post. &#x201C;She was screaming, &apos;I can&#x2019;t move my leg!&apos;&quot; Gazivoda&apos;s father added that the wheel ran over her leg and she injured her back in the incident, but she was treated at St. Barnabas Hospital and is currently recovering. </p>
