<p>Last fall, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408152348/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/30/meet_our_new_superfund_site.php">EPA proposed adding</a> the property at 1125-1139 Irving Avenue in Ridgewood, Queens to the list of federal <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408152348/http://www.epa.gov/superfund/">Superfund sites</a>. That spot is the location of the former Wolff-Alport Chemical Company, which sold thorium to the government for use on the Manhattan Project and the Atomic Energy Commission until the 1950s. It&apos;s also currently home to Primo Auto Body Shop, an ice making facility, a construction company, and a deli&#x2014;and this week, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408152348/http://www.newyorker.com/sandbox/projects/radioactive-nyc/">The New Yorker put together</a> an excellent video investigation into the history and current status of the most radioactive place in the city. Check it out below.</p>

<p>Things are worst right now for workers at Primo Auto Body Shop, with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408152348/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/31/nyregion/queens-industrial-site-to-be-considered-for-superfund-status.html?ref=nyregion&amp;_r=0">the EPA writing</a> <strong>&#x201C;workers at the auto body shop and pedestrians who frequently use the sidewalks at this location may have an elevated risk of cancer.&#x201D;</strong> Judith Enck, an EPA regional administrator, is spearheading the campaign to get the property Superfund status: &quot;I think what&apos;s important here is this is right in the heart of the community, where people live and work every day,&quot; she says in the video. </p>

<p>&quot;What really sticks with me is when I read the health report, and there was a recommendation that people not lay on their back in the auto body shop, and I just have this concern that all day long a number of guys are underneath a car not suspecting that just coming to work every to do their jobs is potentially causing a health risk for them,&quot; she added.</p>

<p>The EPA is expected to make its decision about the area this month, with Enck noting it is &quot;very likely&quot; to happen. While Primo Auto Body Shop might have high enough elevated levels of radiation to warrant immediate action, there&apos;s no such luck thus far for neighboring I.S. 384, a public school and daycare center <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408152348/http://gothamist.com/2013/12/11/ridgewood_auto_body_shop_designated.php">situated just 900 feet from the site.</a></p>
