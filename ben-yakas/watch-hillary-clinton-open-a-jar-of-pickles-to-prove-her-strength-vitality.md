<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110094239/http://gothamist.com/tags/hillaryclinton">Hillary Clinton</a> has been the subject of an unhealthy amount of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110094239/http://gothamist.com/2016/08/21/asdfasdfasdf.php">health conspiracy theory mongering</a> from Donald Trump and his most <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110094239/http://gothamist.com/2016/08/15/giuliani_911_thanks_obama.php">dementia-addled surrogates</a>, which is about as credible as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110094239/http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/22/politics/hillary-clinton-health-conspiracy-theory-explained/index.html">the Obama birther movement</a> (and we all know <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110094239/http://gothamist.com/tags/birther">who got a real kick out of that one</a>).

<p>&quot;I think, on the one hand, it is part of the wacky strategy,&quot; Clinton mused on the Trump campaign strategy. &quot;Just say all these crazy things and maybe you can get some people to believe you. On the other hand, it just absolutely makes no sense.&quot; It&apos;s just like mama always said: throw enough mud at a wall, and some of it will stick&#x2014;throw enough hateful rhetoric at the American electorate, and some of it will increase your approval ratings amongst white supremacists.</p>

<p>Mere feats of strength not convincing enough? How about some idle chitchat about balloons and being a grandma? Because we got plenty of that too:</p>

<p>I know what you&apos;re thinking: WHAT ABOUT THE UNRELEASED EMAILS??!? BRING UP THE EMAILS KIMMEL, YOU HACK. ONLY A SICK PERSON WOULDN&apos;T DISCUSS THOSE! Well check and mate or whatever:</p>

<p>Like all late night guests, she also plugged her latest project, <em>Defeating An Opportunist Megalomaniac To Become President.</em></p>
