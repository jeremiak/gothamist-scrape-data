										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none" style=" width:640px; "> <img alt="5611scotto.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427160554im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/5611scotto.jpg" width="640" height="360"> <br> <i>The Rosanna Scotto Sandwich </i></div> <p></p>

<p>Joining the likes of Woody Allen, Paul Simon and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427160554/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/22/carnegie_deli_has_melo_sandwich_rea.php">Carmelo Anthony</a>, FOX5 anchor Rosanna Scotto is getting her own sandwich at the Carnegie Deli to celebrate her 25th anniversary on air. Just make sure you ask them to hold the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427160554/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/29/rosanna_scottos_soy_bomb_is_no_keep.php">&quot;soy jizzum!&quot;</a></p>

<p>Scotto, the regular &quot;Good Day New York&quot; morning co-anchor, previously anchored the 5 and 10 P.M. news with Ernie Anastos, our other favorite local newscaster. Sandy at Carnegie Deli says they chose &#x201C;<strong>ham because she loves the camera, bologna because we only get the truth from her and no bologna; and turkey because she&apos;s no turkey, she&apos;s the real deal.</strong>&#x201D; We remember Scotto best from that charming on-air &quot;soy jizzum&quot; incident. Hopefully her colleague Greg Kelly isn&apos;t feeling too jealous right now...but maybe they&apos;ll give him his own &quot;soy juice&quot; concoction. We could imagine them having an awkward run in at some point:</p>

<p>But anyway, we&apos;re just waiting for the special Jerk Chicken sandwich for NYC treasure Ernie Anastos. Because if anyone truly deserves it, it&apos;s that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427160554/http://gothamist.com/2009/09/17/video_ernie_anastos_drops_f-bomb_ch.php">hard working chicken fucker.</a></p>
