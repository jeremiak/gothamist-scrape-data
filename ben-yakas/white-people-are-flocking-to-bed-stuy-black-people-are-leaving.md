<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150806032147/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/14/census_says_the_bronx_is_blooming_a.php">the latest census</a>, around 60,000 new Brooklynites moved in between April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2012&#x2014;and it seems the majority of those were white people. The biggest change in demographics over the last decade in Brooklyn occurred in Bedford-Stuyvesant, where the white population grew six fold and the number of African-Americans dropped by 14.6%.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150806032147/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/bk-population-boom-bed-stuy-babies-article-1.1294424">The Daily News crunched some of the figures</a> to come up with those stats, citing increased prices around Park Slope, Williamsburg, Boerum Hill and Carroll Gardens as one of the reasons people are flocking to Bed-Stuy. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s less expensive rent and there is subway access. Yes, the G-train sucks. But it&#x2019;s getting better,&#x201D; said David Behin, head of investment sales for MNS real estate. This is all aided by the fact that Manhattan real estate prices are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150806032147/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/31/manhattan_real_estate_is_still_pric.php">more expensive than ever</a> and Brooklynites are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150806032147/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/16/ny_times_trolls_brooklyn_hipsters_w.php">fleeing for the suburbs</a> (or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150806032147/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/13/brooklynites_fleeing_for_the_pocono.php">the Poconos</a>). The NY Times gentrification compass has certainly been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150806032147/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/09/ny_times_reportage_on_brooklyn_gent.php">ringing this bell lately.</a></p>

<p>The second biggest growth neighborhood in Brooklyn was Williamsburg, which increased in population by 14% in the last decade. What&apos;s interesting there though is that many of those new bodies are being recruited internally: more than 57,000 of the new residents are babies, most born to Orthodox Jewish families in Borough Park and South Williamsburg. DUMBO has seen an increase of nearly 12% in that time, Bushwick 11.6%, and East New York just over 10%.</p>

<p>Now, if only there were a way the census could track the migration patterns of purple pants aficionados and futurism consultants, we could really bust this trend wide open.</p>
