<p>Mayor de Blasio&apos;s pick for City Council Speaker, Melissa Mark-Viverito, has already been accused of being <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509170917/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/11/de_blasios_city_council_speaker_wil.php">an anti-American cocaine coddler</a> who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509170917/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/12/city_council_speaker_candidate_refu.php">disdains the Pledge of Allegiance</a>, but that was child&apos;s play compared to the latest allegations against her. A woman who ran against Mark-Viverito in the Democratic primary for city council speaker has filed a million-dollar lawsuit against her, claiming that Mark-Viverito cursed her with a voodoo hex by putting a giant cock on her apartment building.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509170917/http://nypost.com/2014/01/04/loser-pol-rival-mark-viverito-put-a-curse-on-me/">According to the Post</a>, Gwen Goodwin, 52, thinks that Mark-Viverito purposefully targeted her East 100th Street building &quot;as the canvas for a five-story image of a bodiless rooster atop wooden poles.&quot; Mark-Viverito was the head of urban-art campaign Los Muros Hablan (&quot;The Walls Speak&quot;) last summer, which sought to paint murals on walls across the city to celebrate Latino culture.</p>

<p>But Goodwin writes in the lawsuit, &#x201C;According to neighbors of Puerto Rican and other backgrounds, in the Caribbean culture, this constituted a curse and a death threat, as a swastika or a noose would symbolize typically to many Jews or African-Americans.&quot; </p>

<p>&#x201C;This is supposed to be a professional politician who came and graffitied the side of my building,&#x201D; Goodwin told the Post, who have written <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509170917/http://nypost.com/2013/11/10/nyc-politician-pals-with-anti-american-bolivian-president/">several articles</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509170917/http://nypost.com/tag/melissa-mark-viverito/">criticizing</a> Mark-Viverito. Goodwin claims she endured &#x201C;emotional distress&#x201D; from the alleged spell: &quot;This intimated me and caused me fear. I&#x2019;m a Christian. I don&#x2019;t believe outside my religion, but strange things were happening,&#x201D; Goodwin says. </p>

<p>Goodwin, who got <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509170917/https://twitter.com/JGoldny/status/419490000972316673">blown out of the primary</a> with just over 900 votes, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509170917/http://www.gwengoodwin.com/">wrote on her site</a>: &quot;From all appearances, the 2013 Democratic Primary on September 10 was stolen through massive tampering.&quot;</p>

<p>&#x201C;Somebody who acts like this doesn&#x2019;t seem fitting to be City Council speaker, the second most important position in the city,&#x201D; Goodwin <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509170917/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/melissa-mark-viverito-accused-putting-curse-rival-house-article-1.1566118">added to the News</a>. &#x201C;She is not the progressive that everyone thinks she is. She&#x2019;s part of the 1 percent.&#x201D; </p>

<p>&#x201C;These desperate and &#xAD;ridiculous allegations by a failed political opponent of Melissa are false, absurd and a waste of the court&#x2019;s precious time. It&#x2019;s sad but expected that Melissa&#x2019;s &#xAD;opponents are resorting to these kinds of tactics,&#x201D; responded Eric Koch, a spokesman for Mark-Viverito. </p>

<p>Considering the fact she favorited the tweet below, it seems Mark-Viverito is taking the allegations in stride.</p>
