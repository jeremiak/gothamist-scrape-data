<p>Confronting the question of the meaning of life is a tall order, even for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406145716/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Python&apos;s_The_Meaning_of_Life">Monty Python</a>. Renowned existential philosophers Loverboy once <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406145716/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmvZnX8aUtg">argued</a> that the purpose of life was to work for the weekend, a view derived from the teachings of Nietzsche and his extensive writings on the will to power. But today, when Mayor Bloomberg asked the skies, &quot;Why are we here?&quot;, there was only one answer: to declare this Saturday the official Foursquare day!</p>

<p>A confused Bloomberg showed up at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406145716/http://gothamist.com/tags/foursquare">Foursquare</a> offices in lower Manhattan earlier today to celebrate the &quot;first global social media holiday.&quot; And he issued an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406145716/http://www.mikebloomberg.com/index.cfm?objectid=54A11A3B-C29C-7CA2-FBDE24CA2C8B4E66">official proclamation</a> declaring April 16, 2011&#x2014;4/16, the fourth sixteenth of the year&#x2014;to be Foursquare Day in New York City. Of course, we&apos;re pretty sure Bloomberg only has a smidgen of an idea what Foursquare even is, but he is a fan of start-ups and new technology! So if anyone has any ideas of how one might celebrate Foursquare day (maybe some sort of drinking game?), let us know. Until then, enjoy this video below taken <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406145716/http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/2011/04/mayor_bloomberg_foursquare.php">by the Voice</a>, showing Bloomberg arriving for his Foursquare meeting a little existential:</p>
