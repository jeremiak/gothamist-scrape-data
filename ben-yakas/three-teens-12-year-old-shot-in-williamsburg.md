<p>Four young men, including a 12-year-old, were all shot in Williamsburg last night. According to police, the shooting occurred around 7:30 p.m. on South 2nd and Roebling Street. All four victims&#x2014;a 12-year-old, two 14-year-olds, and a 17-year-old&#x2014;were shot in the leg, and are expected to survive. But cops have hit a bit of a roadblock: &quot;They haven&#x2019;t been very cooperative,&quot; a police source <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140424125142/http://nypost.com/2014/03/15/boy-12-and-three-teens-shot-in-brooklyn/">told the Post.</a> &quot;So the investigation could take a while.&quot;</p>

<p>Two of the victims were taken to Kings County Hospital Center and two were taken to Bellevue Hospital. The parents of one of the 14-year-old victims <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140424125142/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/kids-hospitalized-williamsburg-shooting-article-1.1722432">told the News</a> a man called out at the teens and started shooting: &quot;In New York nothing surprises me,&#x201D; the teen&#x2019;s 60-year-old mom said. &#x201C;I just try to stay prayed up.&#x201D;</p>

Williamsburg may not seem like a gang-heavy area anymore, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140424125142/http://gothamist.com/2008/10/14/gang_violence_continues_in_south_wi_1.php">just a few years ago</a> it was still rife with gang violence.</p>
