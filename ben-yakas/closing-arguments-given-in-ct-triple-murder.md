Prosecutors argued for the first time that Hayes was the one to ignite the fire that engulfed the Petit family&apos;s house, killing 17-year-old Hayley Petit and 11-year-old Michaela in the process. <strong>&#x201C;The last one out is the one who lights the fire</strong>,&#x201D; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412160259/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/02/nyregion/02cheshire.html?_r=1&amp;partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">said prosecutor</a> Michael Dearington.<p></p>

<p>The courtroom was darkened and jurors were shown photos of the Petit family and their burned house, as Dearington <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412160259/http://www.courant.com/community/cheshire/cheshire-home-invasion/hc-hayes-closing-arguments-1002-20101001,0,2147762.story">painted a final</a>, gruesome portrait of the last minutes of the girls&apos; lives: &quot;Were they screaming in terror? Hayley and Michaela Petit knew their deaths were near...<strong>What did the defendant do while they were screaming for their lives? Did he lift a finger to help them?&quot; </strong>At this point, the issue is not whether Hayes will be found guilty; it&apos;s whether he will recieve the death penalty for the brutal attack.</p>

<p>Defense lawyer Thomas Ullmann <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412160259/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/deadly_decision_CBYXuuAUFQsQug3xytvA8O?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">did not deny</a> that his client raped and murdered Jennifer Hawke-Petit, nor that he committed arson, burglary and larceny. Instead, he tried to do damage control, blaming Hayes&apos; partner Joshua Komisarjevsky for controlling the situation: &quot;Steven Hayes is no angel. But he&apos;s not the one who controlled the escalating violence.&quot; He argued that Komisarjevsky changed the original plan, and set into motion the terrible events of the day by raping 11-year-old Michaela. &#x201C;The psychopath in this case is Joshua Komisarjevsky, not Steven Hayes. He should pay the price for what he did, but not for what he did not do.&#x201D; Jurors could come to a decision as early as Monday. Komisarjevsky is to be tried next year.</p>
