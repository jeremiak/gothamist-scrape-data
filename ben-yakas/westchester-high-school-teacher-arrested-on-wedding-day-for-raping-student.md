<p>A Westchester high school teacher was arrested on what was supposed to be his wedding day for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141119125259/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/High-School-Teacher-Arrested-Rape-Student-Wedding-Day-215289851.html">allegedly raping a student.</a> John M. Azabache, a 31-year-old math teacher at Ossining High School, turned himself into police on Friday for allegedly having sex twice with a 16-year-old female student between March and July 1st of this year. </p>

<p>Ossining police were contacted Wednesday by the girl&#x2019;s family about the allegations. Azabache was supposed to get married to Amanda Rae DeLuccia on Friday, but guests were told Thursday night that the wedding was off. &#x201C;It all just came out at the last minute,&#x201D; the bride&#x2019;s 92-year-old grandmother, Josephine DeLuccia, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141119125259/http://www.lohud.com/article/20130712/NEWS/307120075/Ossining-teacher-who-planned-marry-tonight-charged-raping-student-16?nclick_check=1">told the Journal News</a>. &#x201C;He always seemed like a nice guy. I don&#x2019;t know what happened. You men are all alike. You stink. I hope they send him to jail forever.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Azabache has been ordered to stay away from the student, as well as his fiancee and two of her family members because they were &quot;witnesses to events after the fact.&quot; Azabache&apos;s defense attorney <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141119125259/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local/northern_suburbs&amp;id=9171185">confirmed to ABC</a> that his client&apos;s former fiancee is on the prosecution&apos;s witness list.</p>
