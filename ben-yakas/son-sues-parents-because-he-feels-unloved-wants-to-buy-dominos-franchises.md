<p>We all have issues with our parents, but you don&apos;t see most of us suing our &apos;rents over that time we couldn&apos;t choose between two baseball cards and we hemmed and hawed for nearly an hour until we weren&apos;t allowed to have either one. Not so for Brooklynite Bernard Anderson Bey, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130328172733/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/short-article-1.1269358">who has sued his parents for $200,000</a> because he says their lack of love led to him being homeless. &quot;I feel abandoned,&quot; 32-year-old Bey told the News outside the homeless shelter where he&apos;s currently staying. &quot;The relationship I share with my parents is not a beneficial one. Not a loving, nurturing one.&quot; Bey is very specific in the lawsuit as to what they should do to make up for their neglect: mortgage their Bed-Stuy brownstone in order to &quot;purchase two cost effective franchises such as Domino&apos;s Pizza.&quot; As we always say, the family that orders a 5-5-5 deal together stays together.</p>

<p>Mind you, Bey&apos;s parents haven&apos;t been entirely heartless despite, um, being such heartless creatures in Bey&apos;s eyes. They did give him money recently when he asked, though he wasn&apos;t happy it was provided &quot;painstakingly.&quot; But when they wouldn&apos;t let him use their shower, it left him &quot;feeling filthy and disgusting, cold, hungry, unloved and beaten by the world.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130328172733/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/unloved_son_bid_for_cold_heart_49Qs0N4J1b9BmYLwcOoy3N">In the suit</a>, Bey claims his father beat him as a child, called him &#x201C;bastard&#x201D; and &#x201C;motherf--ker&#x201D; and did drugs in front of him. him.&#x201C;Defendant Bernard Manley [Bey&apos;s stepfather] informed the plaintiff he was entitled to nothing, which is true,&#x201D; Bey wrote in the suit. &#x201C;I am not entitled to receive anything from an asset he owns. I only thought he might find pleasure in seeing his children become successful.&#x201D; If Tony Soprano could have strong armed his parents via legal extortion into being proud of him, it certainly would have been a much less interesting program.</p>

<p>His parents are less-than-sympathetic at this point. &#x201C;He&#x2019;s not related to me. He&#x2019;s not my son,&#x201D; Manley told the Post. His mother had some advice for him: &quot;I say go get a job,&quot; Vickie Johnson told the News. &quot;He&apos;s never had a job a day in his life. He&apos;s looking for money so he doesn&apos;t care who he has to step on.&quot;</p>

<p>&#x201C;He&#x2019;s 32 years old,&quot; she told the Post. &quot;That speaks for itself. Welcome to America. Everyone in America has the same opportunity. Don&#x2019;t blame the parents at this point. The choice is yours. You&#x2019;re an adult.&#x201D; We feel like this could be a jumping off point for a discussion about the perpetual adolescence of the American male in our society...but no, this is just a story about one guy&apos;s dream of opening his own Domino&apos;s franchises, and spread cheesy bread love to all the sad, jobless adult-aged children around the city.</p>
