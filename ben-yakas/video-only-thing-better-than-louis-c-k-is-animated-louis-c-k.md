<p>Besides the occasional Citi Bike trip and his upcoming cameo in Woody Allen&apos;s new film, we haven&apos;t heard much from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424160419/http://gothamist.com/tags/louisck">Louis C.K.</a> in recent months. <em>Louie</em> won&apos;t be back until May 2014 and he has no US tour dates lined up, so getting a chance to revisit his 2011 standup special, <em>Live At The Beacon Theater</em>, in animated form is the next best thing. Check out the hilarious clip below, which brilliantly turns a bit from that show into a cartoon ala <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424160419/http://www.rickygervais.com/hboanimation.php"><em>The Ricky Gervais Show</em>.</a></p>

<p>You can see the original stand-up bit below:</p>

<p>This isn&apos;t the first time C.K. has entered the world of animation: there was the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424160419/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/17/video_heres_charlie_brown_as_louis.php">depressingly epic Charlie Brown/Louis C.K. mashup</a>, this (slightly cruder) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424160419/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVqrekel3a4">animated version of his bit about turning 40</a>, and best of all, the below video which comes from the pilot for a sketch-comedy series commissioned by HBO.</p>
