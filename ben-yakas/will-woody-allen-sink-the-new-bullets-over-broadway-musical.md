<p>Ever since Dylan Farrow <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501174727/http://gothamist.com/2014/02/01/dylan_farrow_writes_open_letter_abo.php">wrote an open letter</a> to her adoptive father accusing him of sexually molesting her when she was 7, the internet has worked itself into a frenzy trying to come to grips with what <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501174727/http://gothamist.com/tags/woodyallen">Woody Allen</a> allegedly did or did not do, and how this information has or has not changed their perception of his work. Allen has several projects in the pipeline, including his upcoming film <em>Magic In The Moonlight</em> and his role as a pimp in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501174727/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/14/video_finally_theres_a_movie_where.php"><em>Fading Gigolo</em></a>. But first up is the Broadway adaptation of his movie <em>Bullets Over Broadway</em>, which is set to have its first &#x201C;sneak peek rehearsal&#x201D; Thursday. And it seems Allen&apos;s renewed notoriety has, unsurprisingly, not had a positive affect on the musical.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501174727/http://nypost.com/2014/02/11/sweating-bullets-woodys-scandal-has-investors-worried/?utm_campaign=SocialFlow&amp;utm_source=NYPTwitter&amp;utm_medium=SocialFlow">The NY Post reports today</a> that even the raw star power of Zach Braff is not enough to get people to buy tickets to the musical right now:</p>

<blockquote>The investors in &#x201C;Bullets Over Broadway&#x201D; are fretting that the scandal will damage their show.
<br><br>
From what I&apos;ve learned, they should be worried.
<br><br>
&quot;Bullets Over Broadway&quot; was selling at a decent clip until Dylan&#x2019;s accusations became public.
<br><br>
Sales have slowed down this week, and the advance now stands at just $4 million.
<br><br>
Any hopes that the show would open April 10 with $10 million in the bank have been dashed.
<br><br>
&quot;They&apos;ll be lucky if they get to $6 million by opening night,&quot; says a source.</blockquote>

<p>Having said that, theater reporter Michael Riedel <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501174727/http://nypost.com/2014/02/11/sweating-bullets-woodys-scandal-has-investors-worried/?utm_campaign=SocialFlow&amp;utm_source=NYPTwitter&amp;utm_medium=SocialFlow">still thinks</a> the musical can score some awards thanks to director and choreographer Susan Stroman, who previously won a Tony award for <em>The Producers</em>. </p>

<p>For his part, Allen is doing his best to stay out of spotlight for the musical as well. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501174727/http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/gossip/confidential/woody-allen-bullets-firing-line-article-1.1610639">He is expected to skip</a> the opening event completely this week (also, print media outlets have been uninvited from the play&#x2019;s inaugural media day). Although knowing Woody, he&apos;d likely skip it even if he weren&apos;t dealing with the molestation charges, especially if anyone needed a pick-up clarinetist for a gig. </p>
