<p>We generally love all things <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424160430/http://gothamist.com/tags/larrydavid">Larry David</a>&#x2014;David stand-in George Costanza is basically our avatar (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424160430/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKo2l3FFhUs">&quot;I don&apos;t want hope. Hope is killing me&quot;</a> is a poetic statement), we have a habit of calling everything we enjoy <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424160430/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/12/photos_last_manhattanhenge_of_2012.php">&quot;pretty, pretty, pretty good&quot;</a>, and we admire David&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424160430/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/15/video_larry_david_saves_ricky_gerva.php">baguette-bashing skills</a>. We even have a soft spot for <em>Sour Grapes</em>! But in the Times this weekend, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424160430/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/28/opinion/sunday/my-son-the-terrorist.html?_r=0">David wrote a comedic op-ed</a> nominally about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424160430/http://gothamist.com/tags/bostonmarathon">Boston marathon bomb suspect</a> Dzhokhar Tsarnaev&apos;s relationship with his mother. And it&apos;s kind of strange.</p>

<p>The piece is really more a commentary about delusional parents and how they can make any excuse for their children, no matter what they do&#x2014;it plays off of Zubeidat Tsarnaeva&apos;s insistence that her son is innocent, or that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424160430/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/25/boston_bomb_suspects_parents_blame.php">America is to blame for his alleged acts.</a> But it still feels a bit weird for David to personalize the situation into a comedic bit. In a different context&#x2014;like say, the way Woody Allen <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424160430/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZklxQ4PP7Y8">handled his mother in <em>Oedipus Wrecks</em></a>&#x2014;this could be very hilarious. </p>

<p>Instead, it feels slightly off to us. Although maybe we&apos;re being too sensitive at this point? At least it&apos;s got a clear point to make (some moms will do anything they can to excuse the horrible behavior of their children), and it&apos;s well written&#x2014;unlike Amanda Palmer&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424160430/http://gawker.com/amanda-palmers-a-poem-for-dzhokhar-is-the-worst-poem-476820444">hopelessly tone-deaf</a> &quot;A Poem for Dzhokhar.&quot; </p>
