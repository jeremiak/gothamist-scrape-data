<p>While most of us were content to watch the big <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140709015019/http://gothamist.com/tags/fireworks">Macy&apos;s Fireworks Display</a> over the East River last night, Inwood residents took to the streets and did what they do best: set off illegal fireworks (and try not to get arrested). As <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140709015019/http://gothamist.com/2014/07/04/video_the_most_spectacular_illegal.php">we wrote yesterday</a>, locals have gathered around Dyckman Street for the better part of the last 25 years for an unsanctioned fireworks competition/bonanza. And last night was no different&#x2014;although there was even more of a police presence due to the increased coverage of the event. Check out some videos and tweets below.</p>

<p>Photographer Scott Lynch was on the scene for part of the night, and described what was going on: &quot;Each block had one or two big sidewalk barbecues going on&#x2014;lots of kids, food, music, clandestine drinks&#x2014;and then after about 10:30 they&apos;d take turns launching some sort of display, either on the street on from the rooftops, at which point the NYPD would swoop in (they were literally on every corner, with vans and patrols cars circling constantly) and break up the party. No arrests that I saw. I left around 12:30 p.m., and could hear explosions going off from the 1 train elevated platform, so who knows how long it went on.&quot;</p>
