<p>As everyone knows by now, Mayor Bloomberg has quite a personal affinity for the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150310070926/http://gothamist.com/tags/statenislandferry">Staten Island Ferry</a>&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150310070926/http://gothamist.com/2012/09/28/bloomberg_wont_shut_up_about_how_th.php">he loves reminiscing about</a> taking dates there in his younger days: &quot;You&#x2019;d get a six-pack of beer, a pizza, and you&#x2019;d sit outside; it was really romantic.&quot; But future generations may not get the opportunity to set sail on romantic waters because new boats proposed for the SI Ferry don&apos;t include any outside seating! </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150310070926/http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2013/01/staten_island_ferrys_next_boat.html#incart_river">According to SILive</a>, a &quot;preliminary design investigation&quot; requested by the DOT and completed by KPFF Consulting Engineers recommended purchase of three new boats to replace some of the current ferryboats. The new designs include a longer loading apron, to make it easier to load, and a fourth public deck. But they leave out any outdoor promenade.</p>

<p>But nobody need panic just yet: the new boats wouldn&apos;t be delivered until 2018, giving plenty of time for adjustments and additions to be made. And even the preliminary report notes passengers&apos; fondness for the outdoors: &quot;Weather decks are popular among both regular users and tourists and should continue to be provided.&quot; Passenger surveys and public outreach will also be conducted before any final decisions. Having said that, if you&apos;re someone who finds <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150310070926/http://gothamist.com/2011/07/11/would_somebody_clean_the_si_fish_ta.php">fish tanks</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150310070926/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/03/plans_for_giant_staten_island_ferri.php">giant ferris wheels</a> highly erotic, we wouldn&apos;t delay. And hey, it&apos;s still a hell of a lot cleaner than <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150310070926/http://www.xojane.com/entertainment/masturbating-bathroom-stall-new-york-post">a bathroom at the NY Post.</a></p>
