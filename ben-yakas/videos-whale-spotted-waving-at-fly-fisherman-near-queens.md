<p>Flyfishing guide <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130605052055/https://twitter.com/UrbanFlyGuide">Brendan McCarthy</a> was out on the water near the Rockaways this morning when he spotted something unusual: a humpback whale playing in the water. &quot;I am a flyfishing charter boat captain and have spent a lot of time out here for the past 20 years,&quot; he told us. &quot;Never see them this close here.&quot; </p>

<p>And yes, it&apos;s likely just swimming around and not really waving at McCarthy, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130605052055/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6bSTWtAo0U">we want to believe it could have been waving</a>. At one point, McCarthy noted that the whale was less than 100 yards from the beach, although he believes it was &quot;just playing and feeding,&quot; and not in any distress. You can see two Vine videos of the whale below. A humpback whale was spotted on a cruise around Riis Landing at Breezy Point in 2011; we&apos;ve contacted Riverhead Foundation to get more information about how unusual it is for whales to turn up in the Queens area. We&apos;ll update the post later with more photos and videos as well.</p>

<p>The last time we had a major whale spotting in NYC was not such a happy occasion:  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130605052055/http://gothamist.com/tags/whale">an emaciated 60-foot finback whale</a> washed ashore at Beach 216th Street &amp; Palmer Drive in Breezy Point the day after Christmas last year, and was declared dead a few days later. Between that incident and the poor dolphin who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130605052055/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/25/the_dolphin_trapped_in_the_gowanus.php">washed up in the Gowanus Canal</a>, you can probably understand why we&apos;d be concerned about this whale. Hopefully there&apos;s nothing wrong with this guy, and he was just trying to contact an alien probe. </p>
