<p>After a rough initial launch, Stephen Colbert&apos;s <em>Late Show</em> has started to come into its own during the election season (thanks also to some on the fly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021165948/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/28/arts/television/stephen-colbert-reboots-the-late-show-fixing-it-on-the-fly.html">retooling behind-the-scenes</a>). Last night&apos;s episode was a good mix of everything going right with the show: Colbert gave President Obama a mock job interview to prepare him for exiting the White House and entering the workforce (and also give Obama a chance to encourage people to vote). &quot;There wasn&apos;t a lot of room for advancement in my last job,&quot; Obama noted. &quot;The only one with a more powerful position was my wife.&quot;</p>

<p>While Obama didn&apos;t directly endorse Hillary on the show, Colbert asked him a pointed question about snacks that made things rather clear: &quot;Would you care for an extra fiber nutrient bar, which has traveled to more than 100 countries, or this shriveled tangerine covered in golden retriever hair, filled with bile that I wouldn&apos;t leave alone with the woman I love?&quot;</p>

<p>In an even funnier segment, Colbert addressed Trump&apos;s paranoia and cracked the conspiracy against him using just a chalkboard. You&apos;ve never seen this much censoring on a chalkboard:</p>

<p>Speaking of people who love crazy conspiracy theories, Colbert also had his old sparring partner, Bill O&apos;Reilly, on the show. And even he is having a hard time defending Trump at this point.</p>
