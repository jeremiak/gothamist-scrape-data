<p>Things have been relatively sunny in Knicksland lately: despite a comedown since their 13-1 win streak earlier this season, they are still hovering above .500 and are holding onto the sixth seed for the playoffs, Amare Stoudemire is an all-star <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506172053/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/27/stoudemire_likely_to_be_name_all-st.php">starter</a>, and their rebuilding process has jumped leaps and bounds, even without a second star such as Carmelo Anthony. So what better time to throw the albatross that is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506172053/http://gothamist.com/tags/isiahthomas">Isiah Thomas</a> back into the mix!</p>

<p>It seems that MSG Chairman and blues enthusiast James Dolan just can&apos;t quit Thomas, despite the excellent job done by his successor, current team president Donnie Walsh. According <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506172053/http://www.nypost.com/p/sports/knicks/uncertain_future_oOeNKWHLsogAJJ49XDyG9M">to the Post</a>, Dolan talks to Thomas &quot;<strong>more than once a week regarding Knicks issues and does not care about the fan outrage that will occur if he eventually brings him back in some capacity</strong>.&quot; </p>

<p>Dolan has until April 30 to exercise or decline the fourth-year option on Walsh&apos;s current contract.  Walsh, who turns 70 on March 1st, sounded annoyed by the unnecessary attention given to the behind-the-scenes dealings: &quot;I&apos;m embarrassed by all this when people started bringing (the contract) up. It&apos;s the last thing in the world that I want. If I were to leave tomorrow I want to leave here with dignity, I wouldn&apos;t blame anybody. I&apos;ve had a great time here. Everybody&apos;s treated me well. I have no complaints. That&apos;s where I&apos;m coming from,&quot; he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506172053/http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/basketball/knicks/2011/02/04/2011-02-04_classy_walsh_wont_beg_to_stick_around.html">told reporters yesterday</a> in Greenburgh. </p>

<p>Hmm, the choice between the man who brought Amare here and has made the Knicks respectable again, and the man who worshiped at the altar of Eddy Curry, destroyed the Knicks development system, and generally seems <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506172053/http://gothamist.com/2010/11/06/ugh_delusional_isiah_thomas_thinks.php">highly delusional</a>, doesn&apos;t seem like much of a choice, does it?</p>
