                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="103013bestshow.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203062114im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/103013bestshow.jpeg" width="640" height="480" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>After 13 years of callers around the sunny New Jersey suburb of Newbridge getting <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203062114/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AHYPGnXlwW4">GOMP&apos;d</a>, &quot;The Best Show On WFMU&quot; is ending. Host Tom Scharpling announced on air last night that the beloved radio show would run its final episode on December 17th. &quot;I&apos;ve joked around about this before, and I&apos;m not joking around now,&quot; Scharpling said on air about the decision. We&apos;re sure Philly Boy Roy will have some choice things to say about this.</p>

<p>&quot;It is a huge commitment,&quot; Scharpling explained, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203062114/http://splitsider.com/2013/10/after-13-years-the-best-show-on-wfmu-will-end-in-december/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=not-joking-around-now-%25e2%2586%2592">according to Sidesplitter</a>. &quot;It&apos;s hard to do something that&apos;s more or less a full-time job for free. I&apos;ve done it for as long as I can do it &#x2026; I cannot sustain my life and this show and the commitment that this show takes to do right &#x2026; What the future holds, I have no idea, and I&apos;m not gonna worry about that now. I&apos;m kinda just gonna do the best shows I can do, and we&apos;re gonna do the best shows we can do &#x2026; and we&apos;re going to say goodbye on December 17th.&quot;</p>

<p>In case you haven&apos;t heard the show before, Scharpling plays music and takes calls on the three-hour long program; the callers are often from comedy partner Jon Wurster, who has portrayed several indelible characters (Philly Boy Roy, The Gorch, Timmy Von Trimble) over the years, or one of many notable musicians and comedians such as Patton Oswalt, Aimee Mann, Ted Leo, Todd Barry, and John Hodgman.
