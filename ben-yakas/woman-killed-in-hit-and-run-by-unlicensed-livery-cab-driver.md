<p>A 21-year-old Westchester woman was fatally struck by an unlicensed livery cab driver during a hit-and-run in Harlem on Saturday. Taja Johnson, 21, was apparently in the street shouting at a person driving away in a silver Audi on Eighth Avenue near W. 133rd Street when a livery cab hit her about 4:30 a.m. A witness <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508164118/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/deadly_cab_drag_iIkZ7iA1zQjMEkV1adGaoK">told the Post that</a> unlicensed cab driver Boubacar Bathily, 51, dragged Johnson a few blocks, then drove away. &#x201C;She slipped under the cab, and he dragged her from one block to the next,&#x201D; the witness said.</p>

<p>&#x201C;He let out his passenger &#x2014; but I don&#x2019;t know if she [the passenger] knew what was going on,&quot; the witness added. &quot;Then the cab driver just took off. It&#x2019;s like he didn&#x2019;t even notice he hit her.&#x201D; Johnson, who lives in Mount Vernon and dates a housing cop, was rushed to Harlem Hospital, where she died.</p>

<p>It turns out that Bathily had borrowed the vehicle from Aliou Kanout, 54, for the night. Kanout defended his friend to the Post: &#x201C;He told me that when he was driving he hit something in street,&#x201D; Kanout said. &#x201C;He said that to him, it looked like a trash bag in the street. When he turned around to look at what happened, the thing on the ground looked like a human being. He panicked and drove away.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Bathily ended up turning himself into police a few hours after the incident. He has now been charged with leaving the scene of an accident resulting in death, motor vehicle license violation (no driver&apos;s license), and failure to exercise due care.</p>
