<p>According <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160519075759/http://live.nydailynews.com/Event/Occupy_Wall_Street_Showdown_at_Zuccotti_Park">to the Daily News</a>, at least 20 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160519075759/http://gothamist.com/tags/occupywallstreet">Occupy Wall Street</a> protesters have been arrested this afternoon. A group of protesters marched to Citibank at 555 LaGuardia just after 11 a.m. this morning with NYPD shadowing them. They report that one protester&apos;s hands were bleeding as he was pulled into an NYPD van. <strong>[Updates Below]</strong></p>

<p>Hundreds of protesters who had gone to Washington Square Park for a mid-day General Assembly came to the bank to support the arrested marchers when they heard the reports. &quot;We&apos;re coming here in solidarity with them to protest what I am sure were their illegal arrests,&quot; Josh Wiles, 27, a teacher who lives in Bedford-Stuyvesant told the News. The demonstrators who weren&apos;t arrested there are now on their way uptown to Times Square for another General Assembly and the Occupation Party this evening.</p>

<p><strong>Update 4:45 p.m.</strong>: The NYPD has announced that 24 people altogether were arrested at the Citibank incident earlier today. They were all charged with criminal trespass, while one was also charged with resisting arrest. Many of those protesters had gone to the bank to close their accounts.</p>

<p><strong>Update 5:00 p.m.</strong>: Marchers are still walking slowly to Times Square mostly without incident. But <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160519075759/http://twitter.com/#!/RDevro/status/125306810541416450">according to witnesses</a>, the NYPD just confiscated the press pass of an Italian journalist &quot;with Italian TV, covering the march. Accused of failing to remain on sidewalk.&quot; Reporter Allison Kilkenny <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160519075759/http://twitter.com/#!/allisonkilkenny/status/125306205299154944">described an NYPD white shirt as</a> having &quot;ripped the press pass off Italian camerman&apos;s neck.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Update 5:20 p.m.</strong>: Below, you can see video of some of the protesters in the bank trying to close their accounts who are then arrested by police. That includes one woman who argues she is a customer, and allowed to be in the bank&#x2014;and then she is picked up by a policeman and taken away.</p>
