<p>We&apos;ve spent some time today documenting all the ways yesterday&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429171711/http://gothamist.com/tags/stpatricksday">St. Patrick&apos;s Day Parade</a> was a bit of a shitshow, what with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429171711/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/17/videos_crazy_times_square_mcdonalds.php">the street fights</a>, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429171711/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/17/photos_scenes_from_this_years_snowy.php#photo-1">fratty revelers</a>, and that damn <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429171711/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/17/videos_celebrate_st_patricks_day_wi.php">Swedish Chef</a> (okay, that last one is obviously awesome). But nothing we came across in our area is as bad as what went on in Albany this weekend, as you can see in the massive brawl video below that will surely make you reconsider whether to have children.</p>

<p>There&apos;s not much context to the video except the fact that the videographer needs to stop yelling &quot;turn out&quot; or &quot;turned up&quot; or &quot;turnip&quot; or &quot;turtle&quot; or whatever it is he can&apos;t stop shouting. He sounds like Cartman when he thinks <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429171711/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmCL0gIhkLM">a &quot;race war&quot; is breaking out.</a> Oh, and of course once he finishes screaming that, he starts with the &quot;World Star Hip Hop&quot; chanting, because this video could only get worse.</p>

<p>Perhaps this daytime brawl is somehow connected to the annual &quot;Kegs and Eggs&quot; tradition that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429171711/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/15/think_nyu_kids_are_rowdy_heres_how.php">former Albany &quot;mayor&quot; John Del Signore so patiently dissected last year.</a> It doesn&apos;t really matter at the end of the day why these young folks are re-enacting scenes from <em>Road House: The College Years</em>&#x2014;just be glad that our local college students are too busy <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429171711/http://gothamist.com/tags/sugarbabies">dating sugar daddies</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429171711/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/04/columbia_fraternitys_pledge_scaveng.php">poonspeeding</a> to craft traditions <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429171711/http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=kegs%20and%20eggs">worthy of detailed description in UrbanDictionary.</a></p>
