<p>At this point, we&apos;re just happy people know <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604123358/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/13/21_people_who_dont_know_what_a_pope.php">what the pope is</a>, and that he&apos;s not a groundhog. Being able to pronounce his name is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604123358/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/14/video_bumbling_sports_pope_hilariou.php">a whole other ballgame.</a> So it&apos;s probably good that the porn stars in the video below just keep it simple as they congratulate <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604123358/http://gothamist.com/tags/pope">the pope</a> on winning &quot;the pope election.&quot; And if the pope also got a &quot;full pope&quot; out of it, all the better.</p>
