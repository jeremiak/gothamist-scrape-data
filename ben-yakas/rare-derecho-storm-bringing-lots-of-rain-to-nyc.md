                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="61313storm.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130813075704im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/61313storm.jpeg" width="640" height="424"> <br> <i> NOTE: the skies over NYC do not look like this right now, but they may very well look like this a little later today (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130813075704/http://www.flickr.com/photos/monkeyone/7653293582/sizes/z/in/photostream/">harris graber</a>)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>Have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130813075704/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/12/sunny_today_but_torrential_rains_ex.php">surface low pressure systems</a> got you down today? That&apos;s to be expected when the skies over NYC are overtaken by the Smoke Monster from <em>Lost</em> and the gods start weeping uncontrollably. It&apos;s not just here though: the entire East Coast is going to be hit by a rare &#x201C;derecho&#x201D; storm today. In case you have no idea what we&apos;re talking about, we&apos;ve answered some pertinent questions about today&apos;s weather below.</p>

<p><strong>What is a &quot;derecho&quot;?</strong> It&apos;s a really, really, really big thunderstorm. We don&apos;t know whether we are emphasizing the &quot;really big&quot; part of it enough, but we&apos;re being quite literal: it&apos;s a storm that stretches out over large portions of land. And with it comes winds that could reach up to 100 MPH! </p>

<p><strong>Will this derecho destroy NYC?</strong> Almost certainly not: meteorologists agree that we are outside <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130813075704/http://www.accuweather.com/en/weather-news/severe-storm-derecho-risk-dc-t/14159136">the most probable areas</a> where the storm will hit. &#x201C;New York is on the fringes of the severe weather threat,&#x201D; said Accu-weather meteorologist Tom Kines. So you don&apos;t have to worry about this turning into <em>Hurricane Sandy II: Greasy Lightning</em>, even if <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130813075704/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/national/soaker_wild_ride_JEz7uMyMZJ7Iqc5ZtyYPwJ">the NY Post&apos;s alarmist headlines</a> (&quot;&apos;Land hurricane&apos; could lash victims with 100 mph winds&quot;) scare the beejesus out of you.</p>

<p><strong>Ha! NYC spits in the face of puny rare thunderstorms!</strong> Just because we won&apos;t get the full impact doesn&apos;t mean it won&apos;t be a soggy, gross day. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130813075704/http://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?lat=40.7999209&amp;lon=-73.96831020000002&amp;site=all&amp;smap=1&amp;searchresult=New%20York%2C%20NY%2010025%2C%20USA#.UbncuvbuVg8">The National Weather Service says</a> that &quot;heavy rainfalls&quot; are to be expected all day, and winds are expected to hit in the upper 30s tonight. They also issued a flood watch for NYC from Thursday morning through Saturday morning. We could get up to seven inches of rain over the next few days, which means we&apos;ll almost certainly break the record for most rain in June. But things should be back to normal by Saturday, latest.</p>

<p><strong>Are we doomed to repeat the mistakes of our parents?</strong> Hold up there stranger. Let&apos;s not get melodramatic all of a sudden&#x2014;it&apos;s not like we&apos;re <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130813075704/http://jezebel.com/this-dogs-butthole-literally-looks-like-jesus-513072075">seeing Jesus in a dog&apos;s butt</a> or anything. It&apos;s not so bad out there right now, and maybe we&apos;re being a little paranoid, but NWS says we&apos;re due <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130813075704/http://forecast.weather.gov/showsigwx.php?warnzone=NYZ072&amp;warncounty=NYC061&amp;firewxzone=NYZ072&amp;local_place1=&amp;product1=Hazardous+Weather+Outlook#.UbnroPbuVg8">for &quot;hazardous&quot; conditions later.</a> </p>

<p><strong>Am I an idiot for forgoing a rain poncho for a casual, hoodless sweater?</strong> Yes you are. You&apos;re even stupider for not bringing an umbrella with you. How hard is it to carry an umbrella? Just because you&apos;ve never been able to hold onto one for more than five consecutive hours in a row doesn&apos;t mean you should reject the whole concept. </p>

<p>To better get you in the mood for today, go ahead and start listening to eight consecutive hours of rain sounds.</p>
