<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150108061828/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/21/judge_rules_angry_ex-girlfriends_ca.php">a judge defended the right of women</a> to trash their cheating ex&apos;s online. Former &quot;roller jam&quot; television star Stacey Blitsch and lawyer Amanda Ryncarz both dated lawyer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150108061828/http://www.matthewcouloute.com/">Matthew Couloute Jr.</a>, and said that Couloute jilted them (Blitsch also has a son with Couloute). Throughout that Gloria Allred-aided trial, Couloute&apos;s wife Lauren Haidon stood by him, even defending him on national TV. And surprise surprise, Haidon is now filing for divorce: &#x201C;I always knew he wasn&#x2019;t telling the truth, but when you realize that you are married, and you left your own life to have a life with someone else, it&#x2019;s not so easy to walk away,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150108061828/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/web_of_deceit_INm6gF7rlDXuQbTzIPFWLN">she told the Post</a>. &quot;It truly is embarrassing.&#x201D;</p>

<p>The couple met in August 2010, and married just two months later, a few months before <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150108061828/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/15/gloria_allred_defends_right_to_badm.php">the first cyber-smear appeared</a> on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150108061828/http://liarscheatersrus.com/">LiarsCheatersRUs.com</a> that December. Haidon was shocked to later discover that Couloute broke up with Ryncarz 12 days after his wedding: &quot;I was sick to my stomach,&#x201D; she recalled. Haidon started talking to Couloute&apos;s ex&apos;s regularly, but he blamed them for the breakups: &#x201C;His excuse is that all these women are crazy. Everyone is crazy,&#x201D; she said.</p>

<p>Some of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150108061828/http://liarscheatersrus.com/matthew-c-couloute-jr.html">anonymous posts on the website read</a>: &quot;Lied and cheated his entire way through his 40 years of life&quot; and &quot;HE&apos;S SCUM. RUN FAR AWAY.&quot; Couloute claimed the online statements had interfered with his &quot;ability to make a living.&quot; During the case, Allred <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150108061828/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/15/gloria_allred_defends_right_to_badm.php">took the opportunity</a> to make Couloute a poster child for cheating men everywhere: &quot;We believe that men are more likely to lie and cheat in their relationships with women than vice-versa...Often the men in a relationship have more money, they have more power (and) they have more resources of every kind.&quot;</p>

<p>Having lost the case, Haidon said she&#x2019;s had to pay close to $100,000 for rent and bills that Couloute has neglected to pay. &#x201C;I&#x2019;ve been patient, forgiving, supportive, taken advantage of, used in his custody battle &amp; used as a bank. Life catches up w/u,&#x201D; she recently tweeted.</p>

<p>As for Couloute, he called it a private matter, and added: &#x201C;Women should never be afraid to speak out. But no one should be able to defame an ex-flame because they&#x2019;re not happy with the way the relationship ended,&#x201D; he said. As Allred countered at the time of the ruling, &quot;If you are afraid that your lying and cheating might show up on the internet, don&apos;t lie and cheat.&quot;</p>
