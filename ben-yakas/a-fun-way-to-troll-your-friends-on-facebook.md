Between the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140403102647/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/09/facebook_faker_uses_dead_vets_photo.php">identity theft</a> and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140403102647/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/18/mother_outraged_over_high_school_sm.php">smut lists</a>, there&apos;s plenty of bad trolling going on in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140403102647/http://gothamist.com/tags/facebook">Facebook</a>. But here&apos;s a rather subtle, and mostly benign, way to get under your friend&apos;s skin: artists Oli Beale and Alex Holder like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140403102647/http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/g6stx/james_face/">to tweak</a> their friend&apos;s Facebook pictures ever-so-slightly, to tip them over into the creepy side. </p>

<p>On their site, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140403102647/http://www.oliandalex.com/james-face/">they write</a>, &quot;I like going onto my friend&apos;s Facebook page, taking photos of him, changing them slightly, then putting them back up on Facebook. He doesn&apos;t like me doing this.&quot; You can see more of their photo tweaks on their site. The friend, James, sounds increasingly stressed by his friends shenanigans, threatening at one point to take a computer course to learn how to get revenge. Has he considered turning them <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140403102647/http://www.buzzfeed.com/rmercader/girl-turns-ex-boyfriend-into-a-meme-24gt">into a meme</a>?</p>
