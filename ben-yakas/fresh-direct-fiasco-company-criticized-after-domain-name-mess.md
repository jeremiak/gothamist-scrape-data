<p>New Yorkers have long relied on Fresh Direct the way Frodo relied on Samwise Gamgee&#x2014;when all hope is lost and the overwhelming urge to order Famiglia&apos;s arises, FD will be there to remind us that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505135208/http://www.squidoo.com/samwise-gamgee">when the sun shines it will shine out the clearer</a>, and oh yeah, fresh asparagus is on sale. So when the company&apos;s website went down mysteriously for many people over the last 48 hours, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505135208/https://twitter.com/mdudas/status/283755217294589952">things seemed bad</a>. And when <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505135208/https://twitter.com/JDAshman/status/283978152307458050">word spread</a> that all the troubles may have been caused because Fresh Direct didn&apos;t renew their domain name, well then the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505135208/https://twitter.com/search?q=fresh%20direct&amp;src=typd">Twitter pitchforks</a> really came out. But it seems people may have turned on their delivery overlords a bit too quickly.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505135208/http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-12-26/freshdirect-site-down-on-outage-related-to-domain-renewal.html">According to Bloomberg</a>, FD&apos;s site provider Network Solutions LLC confirmed the company had paid for its domain-name renewal&#x2014;the outage was caused by update delays on systems that are farther away from the home server. This is what Fresh Direct <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505135208/https://www.facebook.com/FreshDirect/posts/10151223911926234">wrote on their Facebook</a> this morning:</p>

<blockquote>We are sorry about the site outages being experienced by some of our customers with Time Warner and Verizon Wireless. We&#x2019;ve identified the problem and we are working to quickly resolve it. 

<p>Rest assured we are still open and are making deliveries. Customers with Verizon Fios, Sprint Wireless, T-mobile Wireless, and Optimum online should be able to access the site. </p>

<p>Thank you again for your patience and understanding as we work with the Internet providers to get this fixed.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>The site is working for us fine now, but some people on the aforementioned networks still can&apos;t get it up&#x2014;initially, the company had estimated everything should have been back to normal by 2 p.m., but that&apos;s obviously not true, judging by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505135208/https://twitter.com/FreshDirect">their apology-ridden Twitter account.</a> At least Fresh Direct can sleep tightly knowing they didn&apos;t ruin Christmas for anyone quite as badly as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505135208/http://sfist.com/2012/12/26/netflix_streaming_implodes_christma.php">certain other companies did.</a></p>
