<p>A Harlem woman is suing a Brooklyn doctor for testing her for HIV without her consent, and then informing her that she was positive for it. &quot;I was tricked. I never signed any paper. It was a slap in the face,&quot; the 31-year-old woman, who wished to remain anonymous, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508151154/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20121003/new-york-city/woman-sues-brooklyn-doctor-for-telling-her-she-has-hiv">told DNAInfo</a>. Maybe there was some confusion for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508151154/http://dr.yutsis.com/index.php">Dr. Pavel Yutsis</a> of Lifex Medical Care&#x2014;after all, the laws about consent were very, very different in the former Soviet Union.</p>

<p>The woman was recovering from recent gastric-bypass surgery when she went to Yutsis in the summer of 2011 for treatment of a Vitamin B12 deficiency. Yutsis suggested she take an HIV test after she continued to show a shortage of white blood cells and low levels of B12, but she refused: &quot;I wasn&apos;t really concerned about anything else&quot; other than recovering from surgery, she said. But a nurse tested her anyway, allegedly on orders from Yutsis, who informed her of the diagnosis: &quot;My body got numb. I was not good after that,&quot; the woman said. &quot;I was tricked with something I had no clue about.&quot;</p>

<p>New York&apos;s public health law requires written consent before someone can test for HIV, which the woman says she wasn&apos;t given: &quot;She was never asked to sign a form consenting to the test and was not given counseling to prepare her for the administration of an HIV test,&quot; the lawsuit says. &quot;These are personal choices that the law has specifically carved out to make the specific decision,&quot; the woman&apos;s lawyer, Daniel Pepitone, said. &quot;We&apos;re all aware of the value of finding out, but she has her own reasons. We need to protect her rights under the law.&quot;</p>

<p>It sounds as though the woman still has little interest in discussing her diagnosis: &quot;I&apos;m working on things,&quot; she said, focusing instead on how much weight she lost from the gastric-bypass surgery. &quot;I&apos;m slim and trim and sexy,&quot; she said. &quot;If I turn sideways, I&apos;ll be marked absent.&quot;</p>
