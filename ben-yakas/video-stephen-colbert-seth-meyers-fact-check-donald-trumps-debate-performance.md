<p>On Monday after the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161107215320/http://gothamist.com/2016/09/26/clinton_trump_debate_2016.php">first presidential throwdown</a> between Hillary Clinton and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161107215320/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/28/us/politics/trump-sniffles-first-2016-debate.html">Mr. Sniffles</a>, late night comedians (and their hard-working editors, writers and staff) hustled to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161107215320/http://gothamist.com/2016/09/27/late_night_debate_talk.php">gather video and comment on the debate</a> barely an hour after it finished. But there was so much to unpack, it couldn&apos;t all be done in one evening&#x2014;so both Stephen Colbert and Seth Meyers dug a little deeper last night to draw out everything truly &quot;WRONG&quot; about Trump&apos;s performance. All that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161107215320/http://mobile.nytimes.com/2016/09/29/us/politics/donald-trump-debate.html?_r=0&amp;referer=">lack of debate prep</a> really came in handy!</p>

<p>&quot;What was obvious early on is that Clinton&apos;s plan [was] to get under Donald Trump&apos;s skin, and I&apos;ve got to say, she brought the orange peeler, because she got in there man,&quot; Colbert said, before pointing out Trump&apos;s proclivity for interrupting Clinton during the debate. </p>

<p>Noting that Trump had some problems with the truth throughout the debate (and this entire campaign), Colbert continued, &quot;A lot of people said Trump didn&apos;t seem prepared...possibly because he was not.&quot; He didn&apos;t have room in his head for facts and figures because &quot;there&apos;s no room in there, it&apos;s already full of ethnic slurs and different wife names.&quot;</p>

<p>In case you&apos;re wondering how exactly a late night show is able to get segments together so quickly in real time, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161107215320/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/28/arts/television/stephen-colbert-reboots-the-late-show-fixing-it-on-the-fly.html?smid=tw-nytimes&amp;smtyp=cur">NY Times was with Colbert</a> on Monday night before the show aired, and have a fascinating glimpse into the process as well as Colbert&apos;s overall retooling of the show. Particularly relevant is this:</p>

<blockquote>At a time when Mr. Fallon has been widely criticized for his chummy treatment of Mr. Trump, Mr. Colbert&#x2019;s unvarnished political perspective could prove crucial in distinguishing himself from his network competitors.

<p>Without commenting directly on Mr. Fallon&#x2019;s program, Mr. Colbert said, &#x201C;I&#x2019;ve surrendered to my natural instincts, and to how I actually feel on a daily basis.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Besides, Mr. Colbert felt sufficiently regretful about his own interview with Mr. Trump, at the start of his tenure on &#x201C;The Late Show&#x201D; in September 2015.</p>

<p>&#x201C;I tried being gracious and pointed at the same time, and got almost nothing out of him,&#x201D; Mr. Colbert said. &#x201C;It was actually boring, because he wouldn&#x2019;t even look me in the eye. Being nice to a guy who isn&#x2019;t nice to other people, it doesn&#x2019;t serve you that much.&#x201D;</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>Meyers focused on the debate fallout, noting that while Clinton was being held to a higher standard coming in (like a &quot;ninja bank robber&quot;), &quot;all Trump had to do was be a normal person and he would have been declared the winner&#x2014;and yet he still managed to lose.&quot; If you feel like there was some cognitive dissonance between what you watched on Monday and the pro-Trump spin and polls, Meyers gets it. </p>

<p>Though at least we can all agree that the war on cyber is very important: &quot;He talks like Lenny Briscoe in a 20 year old episode of <em>Law &amp; Order</em>.&quot;</p>
