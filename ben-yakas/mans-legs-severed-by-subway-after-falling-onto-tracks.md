<p>A man had his legs severed after he fell onto the subway tracks and was struck by a D train in the Bronx last night, making this the sixth <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406204507/http://gothamist.com/tags/subway">subway-related incident</a> in the last five days. According to FDNY, the incident happened just after 9:30 p.m. at the 161st Street-Yankee Stadium stop. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406204507/https://twitter.com/JoeyBoots">Joey Boots</a>, who was there at the time, captured photos and video of the aftermath of the incident, which you can see below.</p>
