title: Couple Enjoys Romantic Valentine's Day Dinner Inside Union Square Subway Station
---

	
										<p>We can think of plenty of NYC-centric Valentine&apos;s Day activities that could wrap your loved one in a bundle of joy&#x2014;visiting the Bronx Zoo cockroach you named <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171015144344/http://gothamist.com/2017/01/24/bronx_zoo_hissing_cockroach_love.php">after your ex</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171015144344/http://gothamist.com/2015/02/08/video_most_romantic_man_in_nyc_sere.php">hiring Mariachi players</a> to perform &quot;Can&apos;t Keep My Eyes Off Of You&quot; on the sidewalk, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171015144344/http://gothamist.com/2017/02/13/interview_michael_bolton_scott_auke.php">practicing Hygge</a>&#x2014;but none of those ideas involve the NYC subway system. And yet, that is just the venue one Bronx couple chose for their big Valentine&apos;s Day date night yesterday. One person&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171015144344/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/22/video_when_will_people_get_that_cli.php">nail clippings</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171015144344/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/09/when_you_breathe_on_the_subway_you.php">human detritus graveyard</a> is another&apos;s screening of <em>Fifty Shades Darker</em>.</p>

<p>Mohammad Choudry and his wife of nine years, Johnnybell Sanchez, staged their romantic dinner inside the Union Square subway station. While being serenaded by a band Choudry hired, the couple dined on lobster as commuters passed through during rush hour on the L train platform.</p>

<p>&quot;It was a little weird. I&#x2019;m not going to lie,&quot; Sanchez <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171015144344/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/NYC-Husband-Wife-Have-Valentines-Day-Dinner-in-Subway-413792003.html?cid=sm_npd_nn_tw_ma">told NBC New York</a>, noting that lots of strangers were staring at them. Still, she was quite happy with the effort her husband put in: &quot;He&#x2019;s never done anything like this before, so I&#x2019;m really proud of him,&quot; she said. &quot;I think it came out perfect,&quot; he added.</p>

<p>If you&apos;re wondering whether they chose that particular subway platform because it has some unique meaning to them&#x2014;like say, they met each other on the platform&#x2014;think again. Choudry said he chose it because his wife just... likes the station? It&apos;s pretty vague. Still, better than a lot of other <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171015144344/http://gothamist.com/2014/10/14/used_condom_f_subway.php">&quot;romantic&quot; subway stories</a> we&apos;ve come across. </p>

<p>But if you want to read actual stories about people who <em>did</em> meet on the subway, the NY Times <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171015144344/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/14/nyregion/new-york-today-they-met-on-the-subway-and-married.html">has you covered.</a><br>
