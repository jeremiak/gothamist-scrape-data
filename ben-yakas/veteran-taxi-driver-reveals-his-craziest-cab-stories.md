<p>We always love when taxi drivers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422201121/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/01/taxi_driver_ama.php">kiss and tell</a> about their passengers&#x2014;so we were happy to find out that veteran cabbie Gene Salomon has written a book with all his sloppiest, funniest cab stories, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422201121/http://www.amazon.com/Confessions-York-Taxi-Driver-Series/dp/0007500955">&quot;Confessions Of A New York Taxi Driver.&quot;</a> And today, he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422201121/http://nypost.com/2014/01/19/stars-smoochers-wackos-wiseguys-secret-taxi-tales/">offered the Post</a> eight of his favorite stories as a preview. &#x201C;I have more stories than the Empire State Building,&#x201D; reads the motto on his business card.</p>

<p>So below, check out some highlights, including brushes with a young Leonardo DiCaprio, senior citizen make out sessions, bloody passengers, and stubborn heart attack victims.</p>

<p><strong>Leo Wants To Know If You Know That He Knows That You Know Who He Is</strong>: Salomon ran into a young blond &quot;smoking a cigar that was bigger than his face&quot; in 1996. &quot;Don&apos;t you know who I am?&quot; DiCaprio asked when he got in the backseat, before naming each of his movies, none of which Salomon had seen. When they reached their destination, everyone left by Leo: &quot;He surprised me. He stayed inside and started asking me questions about what it&#x2019;s like to be a taxi driver.&#x201D; Then he gave him triple the meter.</p>

<p><strong>Don&apos;t Do It In The Backseat Unless You Like It When Cops Watch</strong>: When he picked up a couple at The Bowery Hotel, the woman immediately asked him, &quot;You don&#x2019;t mind if we have sex in your cab, do you?&quot; As they went at it, Salomon asked a female cop in an adjacent car if this was legal. The cop picked up a microphone and started shouting at the couple: &quot;Hey, you, lady in the taxi &#x2014; get off that guy right now!&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Senior Citizens Make For The Hottest Customers</strong>: &quot;They were wrapped around each other like a couple of vines,&quot; Salomon writes, &quot;and I would rank them right up there near the top of my all-time list of back-seat kissing fools.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Sometimes Cabs Are Confessionals</strong>: One passenger got in his cab all bloody, muttering &quot;I hope I didn&#x2019;t kill him.&quot; It turned out he was a former Marine who had gotten into a bar fight with some idiots. &quot;I gave him the only advice I could: Talk to no one else about his incident other than a priest. Don&#x2019;t let your feelings of guilt put you in a jail cell,&quot; Salomon says.</p>

<p><strong>Paul Simon Has No Interest In Being The Owner Of A Sports Franchise</strong>: Among the many celebs Salomon has picked up, these two stand out: Hoffman was giving a semi-hysterical rant to another man. When Hoffman got out, the other man noted, &quot;That was Abbie Hoffman. I&#x2019;m his parole officer.&quot; And when Simon got in his cab, Salomon suggested he buy the Yankees: &quot;I don&#x2019;t have that kind of money,&quot; Simon replied. &quot;You should talk to McCartney.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Heart Attack Express:</strong> He picked up a middle-aged man in 1996 who informed him he had just suffered a heart attack. &quot;You just had a heart attack?&#x201D; the cabbie said. &quot;Shouldn&#x2019;t I take you to the hospital?&quot; Salomon recalls the man&apos;s response as &#x201C;one of the greatest comebacks of all time.&quot; &quot;I&#x2019;m comin&#x2019; from the hospital,&quot; he said. &quot;Those motherf-&#x200A;-kers don&#x2019;t know what they&#x2019;re doing. I&#x2019;d rather die in a hotel room.&quot;</p>
