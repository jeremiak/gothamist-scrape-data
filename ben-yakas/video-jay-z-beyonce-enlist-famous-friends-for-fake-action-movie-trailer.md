										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="51814beyonce.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144400im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/51814beyonce.jpg" width="640" height="439" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>When they&apos;re not busy spending quality time with their family <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144400/http://gothamist.com/2014/05/14/illuminate_your_mind_the_illuminati.php">in confined spaces</a>, Jay Z and Beyonce apparently spend their days making homemade homages to <em>Spring Breakers</em>&#x2014;albeit, by gathering their famous actor friends and filming very high quality fake action movie trailers which are really glorified promo clips for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144400/http://gothamist.com/2014/04/16/jay_z_beyonce_reportedly_going_on_t.php">already announced joint tours.</a> Watch it below!</p>

<p>Among other things, the video includes a lot of shots of Beyonce proving she doesn&apos;t know how to hold a gun, Sean Penn apparently hitting his &apos;Nick Nolte&apos; phase, Jake Gyllenhaal definitely hitting his &apos;vagrant chic&apos; phase, Emmy Rossum as the world&apos;s least convincing cop, Jay Z experimenting with a toothpick look, Rashida Jones punchlines, and a much-needed reminder that Blake Lively isn&apos;t a very good actress. Oh, and Don Cheadle. He&apos;s alright.</p>

<p>Whether or not everyone was high when they agreed to participate in this&#x2014;and whether a curator was on set for filming&#x2014;is yet to be determined. Regardless, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144400/http://gothamist.com/tags/illuminati">this has Illuminati stamped all over it.</a> Clearly that&apos;s why there&apos;s no appearance from Rihanna (or Solange).</p>
