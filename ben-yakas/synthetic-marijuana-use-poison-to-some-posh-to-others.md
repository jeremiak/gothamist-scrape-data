<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="111410k2.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20111212013449im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/111410k2.jpg" width="120" height="120" class="image-right"> </span>Back in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111212013449/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/10/legal_marijuana_knock-off_k2_could.php">early summer</a>, we got a brief contact high when we heard about a legal marijuana substitute which Nassau County DA Kathleen Rice was trying to outlaw. &quot;K2,&quot; as the synthetic marijuana is primarily known in this area, causes all the negative effects of pot, including anxiety, panic, paranoia, rapid heart rate and shortness of breath, without any of the fun, calming, goofy stuff.
