title: How To Tell a Mets Fan From a Yankees Fan

										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="5710metsyanks.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160722142258im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/5710metsyanks.jpg" width="230" height="188" class="image-right"> </span>We&apos;ve long been fascinated by the differences between Mets and Yankees fans, and though we&apos;ve come to some tenuous conclusions on the inner-city rivalry (the consensus is the Mets have a better <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160722142258/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/26/battle_of_best_theme_songs.php">theme song</a>), it&apos;s still hard to pinpoint what the real differences are between each teams&apos; fans. Well, the scientists over at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160722142258/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704342604575222410550392850.html?mod=WSJ_NY_MIDDLELEADNewsCollection">WSJ laboratories</a> were also intrigued by this question, so they outsourced their search to a polling firm Public Opinion Strategies, who conducted a survey of 650 male and female fans across all five boroughs. And the results...will shock you.</p>

<p>From their 445 pages of data, they&apos;ve concluded that:<br>
</p><ul><li>The Yankees are the more popular team overall, nearly twice as popular as the Mets. But there are the same number of Mets fans as Yankees fans in Manhattan.<br>
</li><li>Mets fans were 43% more likely to drink beer (and they drink more in general than Yankees fans).<br>
</li><li>Mets fans own more guns (11% vs 5%), and are more likely to bet on games.<br>
</li><li>Yankees fans are more &quot;metrosexual&quot;: they drink more Starbucks coffee, they own Macs instead of PCs, and this might be how they are able to put up with A-Rod.<br>
</li><li>Mets fans had higher rates of marriage and pets, while Yankees fans were more often single.<br>
</li><li>Mets fans listen to &quot;substantially more&quot; sports radio than Yankee fans.</li></ul><p></p>

<p>The conclusion seems to be that Mets fans care more...but the Yankees are much more popular. <em>Very scandalous results.</em> You can see a video below with some more conclusions from the WSJ. </p>
