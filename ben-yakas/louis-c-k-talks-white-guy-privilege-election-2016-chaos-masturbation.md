<p>Fresh off <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170921231420/http://gothamist.com/2016/05/19/video_louis_ck_on_jeopardy.php">dominating Jeopardy!</a> for charity, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170921231420/http://gothamist.com/tags/louisck">Louis C.K.</a> sat down with NY Magazine <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170921231420/http://www.vulture.com/2016/06/louis-ck-horace-and-pete-c-v-r.html">for their cover story</a> this week. In a wide-ranging and fascinating interview, C.K. covers white male privilege, the state of <em>Louie</em> and <em>Horace &amp; Pete</em>, masturbation, his favorite female comedians, and the shitshow that is election 2016.</p>

<p>You should take a read through of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170921231420/http://www.vulture.com/2016/06/louis-ck-horace-and-pete-c-v-r.html">the whole thing</a>, but we&apos;ve picked out a few highlights below:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>On the differences between Hillary, Bernie and Trump</strong>: &quot;I keep going back and forth. Sometimes I think the system is so deeply fucked up that somebody as disruptive as Bernie &#x2014; maybe he doesn&#x2019;t even do a good job as president but he jars something loose in our system and something exciting happens. I mean, Hillary is better at this than any of these people. The American government is a very volatile, dangerous mechanism, and Hillary has the most experience with it. It&#x2019;s like if you were on a plane and you wanted to choose a pilot. You have one person, Hillary, who says, &#x201C;Here&#x2019;s my license. Here&#x2019;s all the thousands of flights that I&#x2019;ve flown. Here&#x2019;s planes I&#x2019;ve flown in really difficult situations. I&#x2019;ve had some good flights and some bad flights, but I&#x2019;ve been flying for a very long time, and I know exactly how this plane works.&#x201D; Then you&#x2019;ve got Bernie, who says, &#x201C;Everyone should get a ride right to their house with this plane.&#x201D; &#x201C;Well, how are you going to do that?&#x201D; &#x201C;I just think we should. It&#x2019;s only fair that everyone gets to use the plane equally.&#x201D; And then Trump says, &#x201C;I&#x2019;m going to fly so well. You&#x2019;re not going to believe how good I&#x2019;m going to fly this plane, and by the way, Hillary never flew a plane in her life.&#x201D; &#x201C;She did, and we have pictures.&#x201D; &#x201C;No, she never did it.&#x201D; It&#x2019;s insane.&quot;</li>
	<li><strong>On his masturbation preferences, sans Internet, these days</strong>: &quot;Take a little longer and try to get your imagination frothed up to where it gets you off. What a strange exercise! I hadn&#x2019;t done that since 1998...It&#x2019;s gone pretty well. I kinda like it. It also means: Maybe store it up for a while and wait until you actually have a sexual urge. I don&#x2019;t know what it&#x2019;s like for women, but for a lot of guys I know &#x2014; and myself &#x2014; masturbation is an anxiety release. If I&#x2019;m trying to get some work done and getting irritated, just go rub one out and it calms you down. It&#x2019;s a shame to do that as a swap-out for real sexual connection to your virility and your sexual drive. I don&#x2019;t have a perfect record, but I am trying to see if I can just let a sexual urge be. Having an internet prohibition really helps. I sometimes have gone to jerk off when I&#x2019;m not even hard. I&#x2019;m in a bad mood, so let&#x2019;s put on Google and find something to get me off. That&#x2019;s happening every second around the world.&quot;</li>
	<li><strong>On Internet clickbait material</strong>: &quot;The internet&#x2019;s been around long enough that it&#x2019;s in its high-school phase. You know, elementary school is just reflex and fun. It&#x2019;s, &#x201C;Oh, look at that! Oh, look at me for a minute!&#x201D; It&#x2019;s little fights that don&#x2019;t add up to much. Then middle school becomes this &#x201C;cool&#x201D; thing, who&#x2019;s in and who&#x2019;s out. But high school is like, I hang out with this group of kids by the red lockers at the end of the hall and we all like Dungeons &amp; Dragons. You can find somebody you like online. There are people who watch Horace and Pete. Somebody who catches something on BuzzyWuzzy for a second, they&#x2019;re not going to be compelled either way.&quot;</li>
	<li><strong>On the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170921231420/http://defamer.gawker.com/louis-c-k-will-call-you-up-to-talk-about-his-alleged-s-1687820755">Gawker rumors</a> that he had masturbated &quot;in front of women at inappropriate times:&quot;</strong> &quot;No. I don&#x2019;t care about that. That&#x2019;s nothing to me. That&#x2019;s not real...you can&#x2019;t touch stuff like that. There&#x2019;s one more thing I want to say about this, and it&#x2019;s important: If you need your public profile to be all positive, you&#x2019;re sick in the head. I do the work I do, and what happens next I can&#x2019;t look after. So my thing is that I try to speak to the work whenever I can. Just to the work and not to my life.&quot;</li>
	<li><strong>On the crossover between his real life and his work:</strong> &quot;It&#x2019;s hard to date when people know who you are. I don&#x2019;t really want to date somebody who has seen me before. But that&#x2019;s out of the question, so it&#x2019;s a little isolating. It&#x2019;s weird.&quot;</li>
	<li><strong>On whether average white guys are under attack in this country:</strong> &quot;Oh, Jesus, no. White guys are fine. Nobody&#x2019;s turning us down for a job. There&#x2019;s nothing that&#x2019;s being taken away from us. That&#x2019;s a load of shit, people who think that. Most people are good people, and most people who are tasked with hiring or promoting take people at their value. That&#x2019;s my experience anyway. But of course that&#x2019;s my experience &#x2014; because I&#x2019;m a privileged white guy. As a white guy, things are pretty much always as I remember them being. I remember Venus and Serena Williams, they once said there&#x2019;s a lot of racism on the tennis tour. And somebody asked Martina Hingis about it. She stuck her stupid face in it and said, &#x201C;I haven&#x2019;t seen any racism.&#x201D; Well, you&#x2019;re fucking Swiss! That&#x2019;s not nice of me to say. Was it Hingis? I&#x2019;m not sure. Whoever it was is probably very nice. Yeah, men, we&#x2019;re fine. The level of privilege is so high that if we lose a little bit, there&#x2019;s a panic: What&#x2019;s happening to us?&quot;</li>
	<li><strong>On whether he identifies as a feminist</strong>: &quot;I don&#x2019;t feel strongly enough about anything to give myself a label. My daughter is a feminist and I identify with her, with her rights and her feelings, and I&#x2019;m listening to her. I&#x2019;m learning from her. But I think the second you say &#x201C;I am this,&#x201D; you&#x2019;ve stopped listening and learning.&quot;</li>
	<li><strong>On his comedic and artistic sensibilities:</strong> &quot;Everybody&#x2019;s point of view is legitimate. The goal of the things I say onstage or in my shows isn&#x2019;t to please everyone. My goal is not to have everyone say, &#x201C;This was an excellent indictment of this bad thing.&#x201D; I&#x2019;m confounded by people who want that from art. &#x201C;Boy, that sure showed that woman to be strong! That means that was good!&#x201D; It&#x2019;s so much more interesting to shed light on these things that we all argue about. We don&#x2019;t have to agree on everything, and that&#x2019;s okay. After I made the episode about the fat girl, I read a blog post by a young woman who was furious. She said, &#x201C;I&#x2019;ve been talking about this all these years and nobody gives a shit. The fact that this guy&#x2019;s being carried around on people&#x2019;s shoulders by some feminists makes me sick to my stomach.&#x201D; And I read it and I was like, You&#x2019;re totally right. I completely see that. Would that make me go, I better not touch that note again? It&#x2019;s the opposite. It&#x2019;s exciting to be a flash point. It&#x2019;s a valid thing to have your feelings violated and hurt. Sorry, but it is.&quot;</li>
</ul>

<p>This being C.K., there&apos;s a lot more thoughtful stuff about his process, his love for Samantha Bee (&quot;Samantha is inevitable. She&#x2019;s the next thing.&quot;), his regrets over his anti-Trump emails, about the development of his standup routines (&quot;The best I ever was as a stand-up was 2006 to 2011. That was when I just toured all year round and made a special every year.&quot;), and about why the TV business needs reforming.</p>
