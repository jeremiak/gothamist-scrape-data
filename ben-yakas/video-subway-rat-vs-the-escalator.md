<p>Zardulu <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161221201610/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2016/12/14/she-staged-a-viral-story-you-fell-for-her-hoax-she-thinks-thats-beautiful/?utm_term=.3bdd3f45b8b3">may have been</a> responsible for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161221201610/http://gothamist.com/tags/pizzarat">Pizza Rat</a>, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161221201610/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/26/the_best_rats_of_2015.php">worst rat</a> meme (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161221201610/http://gothamist.com/2016/09/21/pizza_rat_meet_pizza_rag.php">or rag</a>) of 2015, but she can&apos;t be everywhere at all times controlling every rat who decides to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161221201610/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/30/see_it_vermin.php">eat a donut</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161221201610/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/03/cannibal_rat.php">murder its brethren.</a> Even if a video of a rat fruitlessly climbing an escalator in the wrong direction <em>would</em> make for a pretty awe-inspiring metaphor for the human experience. </p>

<p>This scene was captured just before 9 a.m. this morning at Penn Station, at the top of the stairs at the 7th Ave entrance/exit. &quot;The rat caused a bit of commotion,&quot; said witness Sam Mazur, who took the video and claims he isn&apos;t Zardulu or one of her minions. &quot;But most people were more amused by it than anything. It&apos;s not like New Yorkers haven&apos;t seen a rat before. Still, I&apos;m glad I took the stairs.&quot;</p>

<p>The video is also a pretty good Rorschach test for how you see the world. Do you think the rat is trying to get his morning exercise? Is it a metaphor for the Sisyphean struggle against conformity? Is it a reminder that New Yorkers are unfazed by unwelcome surprises? Like Donald Trump at the start of his campaign, did it blunder down the wrong escalator and get stuck in a seemingly endless race to the bottom against the overwhelming force of upward progress? Or is it a symbol of all New Yorkers just trying to get through the day with a little bit of dignity?</p>
