<p>An elderly man was killed and his wife was injured after they were struck by an SUV while crossing the street near their Staten Island home yesterday. Police say the incident happened around 7:30 p.m. as 72-year-old Bujar Hasimja and his 64-year-old wife were walking across Jefferson Avenue from north to south. They were struck as they crossed by a grey Nissan Armada that was turning left onto the block.</p>

<p>Hasimja was pronounced dead at Staten Island University Hospital; his wife is in stable condition. The two only lived down the block from the scene of the incident. The driver of the car stayed at the scene, and police say no criminality is suspected. </p>
