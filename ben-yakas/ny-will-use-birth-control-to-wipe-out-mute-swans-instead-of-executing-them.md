<p>Last year, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140330071628/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/29/die_swans_die.php">people were quacking mad</a> after the Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) drafted up a &quot;management plan&quot; [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140330071628/http://www.dec.ny.gov/docs/wildlife_pdf/muteswanmgmtpln2013.pdf">PDF</a>] which called for the total elimination of NY&apos;s mute swam population by 2025. But good news for those who feel slightly icky at the thought of 2,200 animals being <em>literally</em> executed by guns or gas: the DEC <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140330071628/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/01/nyregion/new-york-will-consider-nonlethal-ways-to-reduce-swan-population.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;_r=0">has scuttled the initial, aggressive plan</a>. Instead, they will curtail the population with birth control.</p>

<p>&quot;The big victory is that they&#x2019;re not going to slaughter the swans of Sheepshead Bay,&quot; Assemblyman Steven Cymbrowitz told constituents on Friday, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140330071628/http://nypost.com/2014/02/28/state-swans-wont-be-slaughtered/">according to the Post</a>. &quot;Sheepshead Bay wouldn&#x2019;t be the same without the mute swans. They&#x2019;re synonymous with grace and beauty. Yes, they may hiss sometimes, but this is New York, so they&#x2019;re entitled.&quot; </p>

<p>The DEC has labeled the mute swans an &quot;invasive, non-native&quot; species, because they were first brought here in the late 1800s by Europeans for use as living lawn ornaments. Around 500 were discharged into the wild around 1910, and they&apos;ve proliferated ever since. Their population has tripled in the past three decades.</p>

<p>The DEC received more than 16,000 letters and 30,000 signatures on various petitions from swan lovers hoping to help them avoid the fate of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140330071628/http://gothamist.com/2010/11/16/turns_out_geese_were_gassed_at_jfk.php">so many geese</a>. There&apos;s only one way to celebrate this stay of execution:</p>
