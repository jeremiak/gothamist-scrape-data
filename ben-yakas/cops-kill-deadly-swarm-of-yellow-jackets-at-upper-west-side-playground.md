<p>Police were called to the Upper West Side on Friday to deal with a deadly swarm of European yellow jackets. The swarm was spotted hidden behind some ivy next to a fence at the Sol Bloom Playground on West 92nd Street near Columbus Avenue. &quot;They started spraying all over. Once they sprayed, a bunch of bees started coming out [of the bushes],&quot; said Marisol Ortiz <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140819194719/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20140815/upper-west-side/dozens-of-bees-found-dead-uws-playground-after-police-spray-swarm">told DNAInfo</a>. &quot;It was crazy. I just saw dots of yellow. It was scary.&quot;</p>

<p>According to witnesses, well over a dozen wasps were killed, although the NYPD downplayed it, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140819194719/http://nypost.com/2014/08/16/cops-exterminate-yellow-jackets-near-playground/">telling the Post</a> only &quot;10 were exterminated.&quot; This was the first major swarm the NYPD has had to deal with since longtime NYPD beekeeper <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140819194719/http://gothamist.com/tags/AnthonyPlanakis">Detective Anthony Planakis</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140819194719/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20140807/civic-center/nypds-in-house-bee-expert-buzzes-off-into-retirement">filed for retirement</a>. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140819194719/http://gothamist.com/tags/bees">In the past</a>, Planakis would carefully relocate the hives, but cops used a pesticide spray purchased from Duane Reade to exterminate them yesterday. However, Planakis told us the NYPD handled the insects just right: &quot;[I] immediately sent out texts to let everyone know, I would&apos;ve done the same,&quot; he said. &quot;These insects can be dangerous to someone who is allergic. More so than a honeybee sting, they have the ability to continuously sting. And numerous members of the nest will join in in the aggressive/protective act. When they sting, an alert pheromone is released in the venom alerting other members to a possible threat and to sting. Pretty nasty!!!! Can kill!!!&quot;</p>

<p>As for how he&apos;s enjoying retirement, Planakis added: &quot;Bored!!!&quot;</p>
