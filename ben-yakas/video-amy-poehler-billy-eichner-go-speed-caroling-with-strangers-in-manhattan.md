<p>We love comedian <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151213000737/http://gothamist.com/tags/billyeichner">Billy Eichner</a>, but we know his unique brand of mocha caffeinated man-on-the-street comedy can be overwhelming for some. Which is why a sweet dose of Amy Poehler makes it go down all the better. Eichner and Poehler took to lower Manhattan in the video below for a very frantic attempt at caroling with complete strangers&#x2014;many of whom don&apos;t recognize them, most of whom don&apos;t know the words.</p>

<p>The best parts: the person who thinks &quot;Happy Birthday&quot; is a Christmas carol, when Poehler tells a stranger who doesn&apos;t recognize her that &quot;you know me,&quot; and when the two meet a baby named Arrow and Eichner responds in justified disgust, &quot;No, no, not dealing with that bullshit.&quot;</p>
