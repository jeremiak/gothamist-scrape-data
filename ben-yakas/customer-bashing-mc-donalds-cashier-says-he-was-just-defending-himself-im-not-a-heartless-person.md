Rayon McIntosh gave his version of events for the first time, and defended himself and the actions which may have left one woman with permanent brain damage: &quot;I was just working at my job when I was attacked for no reason. I&apos;m not a heartless person,&quot; he said.</p>

<p>McIntosh said that victims Denise Darbeau and Rachel Edwards came in to the West Village McDonald&apos;s angry: &quot;I tried to keep things calm as best I could...I was not looking for trouble. The trouble found me. People are portraying me as a vicious attacker.&quot; The fight started when Darbeau tried to pay for their food with a $50 bill, and McIntosh wanted to check the authenticity, as was store policy. &quot;She started saying nasty things to me,&quot; McIntosh said. &quot;She said, &apos;Oh, you think my s--t is fake?&apos; ... She started saying, &apos;Suck my d--k.&apos; She called my mother a whore.&quot;</p>

<p>McIntosh says she then spat at him, threatened to &quot;cut me up,&quot; came across the counter and slapped him. When Edwards jumped across too to join in, McIntosh says instinct kicked in: &quot;I was being attacked by aggressive people I didn&apos;t know,&quot; said McIntosh. &quot;I was just defending myself. They came in and went crazy on me.&quot; You can see the rest of the incident play out in the video below:</p>

<p>McIntosh, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151228103213/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/16/customer-bashing_mcdonalds_cashier.php">who served ten years</a> for the manslaughter death of a friend in 2000, has been charged with felony assault and criminal possession of a weapon for using the metal rod to hit Darbeau and Edwards;  Darbeau&apos;s skull was fractured and she may have brain damage. McIntosh did not explain in the interview why he started to hit the women a second time after stopping, and Darbeau&apos;s father <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151228103213/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/19/mcdonalds_beating_victim_allegedly.php">was enraged about that</a>: &quot;I don&apos;t want to hear about self-defense...Although she was culpable, the attack itself was vicious and it shouldn&apos;t have happened. When he hit my daughter, she was out the first time. There was no reason to hit her again.&quot;</p>
