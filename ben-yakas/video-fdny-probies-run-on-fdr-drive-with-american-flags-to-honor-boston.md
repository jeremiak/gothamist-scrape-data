Some <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141230183148/http://gothamist.com/tags/fdny">FDNY</a> probies carried American flags with them as they want on their daily run down the FDR drive. </p>

<p>&quot;When training in the Fire Academy, Probationary Firefighters reguarly run along the FDR as part of their fitness training,&quot; FDNY spokesman Frank Dwyer told us. &quot;Yesterday, to honor the victims of the bombing at the Boston Marathon, the Probies carried American flags along their run. This was something that was decided on by the instructors at the academy and the probie class.&quot;</p>

<p>The run was captured in the (frustratingly vertical) video you can see above, one that is now making the rounds on various FDNY members&apos; Facebook pages. Suffice to say, we&apos;d rather see probies with American flags than disgruntled former dispatchers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141230183148/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/07/retired_fdny_dispatcher_embarrasses.php">with racist blogs.</a></p>
