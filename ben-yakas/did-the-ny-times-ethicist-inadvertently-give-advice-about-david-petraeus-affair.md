<p>Former Army general David Petraeus <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150307072023/http://dcist.com/2012/11/cia_director_david_petraeus_resigns.php">resigned as the director of the Central Intelligence Agency yesterday</a> after admitting to carrying out an extramarital affair. It&apos;s now come out that Petraeus&apos; mistress was embedded with him in more ways than one: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150307072023/http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2012/11/09/petraeus_resigns_over_affair_with_biographer.html">Slate confirmed</a> the mistress was his biographer, Paula Broadwell, co-author of <em>All In: The Education of General David Petraeus</em>. And it seems Broadwell&apos;s husband <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150307072023/http://gawker.com/5959398/did-paula-broadwells-cuckolded-husband-write-a-letter-to-chuck-klosterman-aka-the-new-york-times-ethicist">may have written</a> the NY Times&apos; Ethicist seeking advice about the affair. Because in times of marital strife, who wouldn&apos;t turn to the world&apos;s most sincere Billy Joel aficionado?</p>

<p>The question stems from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150307072023/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/15/magazine/a-message-from-beyond.html?_r=0">the July 13th edition of Chuck Klosterman&apos;s The Ethicist advice column</a>. </p>

<blockquote>My wife is having an affair with a government executive. His role is to manage a project whose progress is seen worldwide as a demonstration of American leadership. (This might seem hyperbolic, but it is not an exaggeration.) I have met with him on several occasions, and he has been gracious. (I doubt if he is aware of my knowledge.) I have watched the affair intensify over the last year, and I have also benefited from his generosity. He is engaged in work that I am passionate about and is absolutely the right person for the job. I strongly feel that exposing the affair will create a major distraction that would adversely impact the success of an important effort. My issue: Should I acknowledge this affair and finally force closure? Should I suffer in silence for the next year or two for a project I feel must succeed? Should I be &#x201C;true to my heart&#x201D; and walk away from the entire miserable situation and put the episode behind me? NAME WITHHELD</blockquote>

<p>Obviously, there&apos;s no way of knowing for sure whether Broadwell&apos;s husband Scott wrote the question, but the timeline of the affair with the column seems to matchup with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150307072023/http://gawker.com/5959376/more-details-emerge-about-the-petraeus-affair">what we know so far.</a> And certainly, Petraeus&apos; work was &quot;seen worldwide as a demonstration of American leadership.&quot; If it is true, then Klosterman may have had more influence over the American intelligence community than he could have ever known when he gave this advice:</p>

<blockquote>Don&#x2019;t expose the affair in any high-profile way. It would be different if this man&#x2019;s project was promoting some (contextually hypocritical) family-values platform, but that doesn&#x2019;t appear to be the case. The only motive for exposing the relationship would be to humiliate him and your wife, and that&#x2019;s never a good reason for doing anything.</blockquote>

<p>Even at the time, Klosterman smelled that something funny was going on: &quot;The fact that you&#x2019;re willing to accept your wife&#x2019;s infidelity for some greater political good is beyond honorable. In fact, it&#x2019;s so over-the-top honorable that I&#x2019;m not sure I believe your motives are real... I halfway suspect you&#x2019;re writing this letter because you want specific people to read this column and deduce who is involved and what&#x2019;s really going on behind closed doors (without actually addressing the conflict in person). That&#x2019;s not ethical, either.&quot;<br>

While we probably won&apos;t know whether that was her husband, we certainly know what Broadwell <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150307072023/http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2012/11/04/general-david-petraeus-s-rules-for-living.html">thought about Petraeus</a>. She made a number of media appearances earlier this year while promoting the release of her book. Below, check out Broadwell on the Daily Show:</p>
