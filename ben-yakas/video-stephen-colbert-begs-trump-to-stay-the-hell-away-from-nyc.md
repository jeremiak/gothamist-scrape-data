<p>Every day brings with it new disturbing headlines thanks to Our Idiot President-Elect, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161119065307/http://gothamist.com/tags/stephencolbert">Stephen Colbert</a> can barely keep up. On his show last night, he tackled Obama&apos;s final overseas trip, Trump&apos;s disastrous transition to power so far, fake news and Facebook, Ben Carson&apos;s rejection of a cabinet position, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161119065307/https://www.newscientist.com/article/2112829-blood-from-human-teens-rejuvenates-body-and-brains-of-old-mice/">vampire mice.</a> But he almost stopped his monologue completely short to deliver a personal plea to Trump <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161119065307/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/10/here_have_more_nightmares.php">after news this week</a> emerged that Trump wants to return to NYC as much as possible, which could lead to blocking off 5th Avenue (and removing the spine of Manhattan).</p>

<p>&quot;This is personal: on behalf of eight million people, please don&apos;t come back every week to New York, I am begging you, please,&quot; Colbert said. &quot;The one week a year when Obama comes in for the U.N. is like the fall of Saigon meets Dante&apos;s Inferno meets World War Z around here...whole generations of New Yorkers will be born and die without ever leaving their Uber!&quot;</p>

<p>He continued, &quot;Why, for the love of pete, would you want to come back to New York? Eighty-six percent of Manhattan voted against you, your front door is blocked by 10,000 people screaming at you. And plus, I&apos;ve been there, the White House is very nice, it has 35 bathrooms&#x2014;you can sit on the same toilet Lincoln tweeted the Gettysburg Address from.&quot;</p>

<p>Colbert also staged an interview with Trump using the <em>60 Minutes</em> interview footage the other night, questioning him about Putin&apos;s gift of a &quot;large wooden horse.&quot;</p>
