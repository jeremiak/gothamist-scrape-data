title: Luxury Bahamas Fyre Festival Turns Into Exciting Survivalist Cosplay Experience
---

	
										<p>Fyre Festival billed itself as &quot;two transformative weekends&quot; on the private Bahaman island of Fyre Cay filled with big-name musical acts (Blink 182, Migos, Major Lazer, Rae Sremmurd, Skepta, Desiigner, Tyga, and Pusha T), luxury food and accommodations, and a horde of interchangeable models who wanted to party with the guests. Founders Ja Rule and Billy McFarland charged <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170429014858/http://people.com/music/fyre-festival-postponed-mass-chaos/">between $4K and $25,000 for tickets</a> to the exclusive event, promising &quot;the best in food, art, music and adventure.&quot; And by all accounts, it truly has been an incredible, once-in-a-lifetime experience for all who went. </p>

<p>The initial announcement, in the video below, showed influencers/models including Bella Hadid, Hailey Baldwin and Emily Ratajkowski lending their credibility to the proceedings, partying on a yacht headed for paradise. It was certainly a high bar to set, but according to witnesses who are still trapped on the island with no rescue in sight, the event has exceeded all expectations and then some, providing memories they&apos;ll surely be talking about for the rest of their lives (assuming they can escape the island). </p>

<p>Among the amenities festival-goers were treated to: living accommodations that were apparently designed for disaster relief efforts; empty beer stands; security lockers with no locks; a &quot;kitchen&quot; that looked like a prop from <em>Wet Hot American Summer</em>; gourmet meals of bread with cheese; lack of available or working toilets; and reports of rampant theft. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170429014858/http://www.billboard.com/articles/business/7776282/blink-182-cancels-fyre-festival">Blink-182 cancelled</a> before the festival even began (bet they are regretting it now!!), and when some sore winners tried to flee the island, unable to appreciate this opportunity to show off their wilderness survival skills, they were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170429014858/http://gizmodo.com/a-tech-bro-charged-dopes-thousands-for-an-island-getawa-1794739500">stranded on the tarmac for hours</a>, waiting on &quot;rescue flights&quot; (the US Embassy in the Bahamas has gotten involved in that effort).</p>

<p>Although most people seemed happily engaged with the curated multi-sensory spectacle, the event has now been cancelled, all because a few bad eggs couldn&apos;t roll with their luxury weekend suddenly turning into <em>Lord Of The Flies: Rich Kids Of Coachella Edition</em>. &quot;Fyre Festival set out to provide a once-in-a-lifetime musical experience on the islands of Exuma. Due to circumstances beyond our control, we must postpone this experience,&quot; the event organizers said in a statement. &quot;We are working tirelessly to ensure each guest leaves the island safely and ask for everyone&#x2019;s patience and cooperation as we continue to provide ongoing updates via email and our official social media channels as they become available, including refund information.&quot; The Bahamas Ministry of Tourism also didn&apos;t seem to appreciate the roaring success of the artisanal event: </p>
