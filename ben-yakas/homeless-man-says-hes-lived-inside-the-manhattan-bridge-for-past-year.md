<p>This weekend, we learned that some homeless people have taken <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425175518/http://gothamist.com/2014/04/13/homeless_people_are_reportedly_livi.php">to living <em>inside</em> the Manhattan Bridge</a> with a lack of other options. One of those homeless people is Joey (or Joe), a 40-something Chinese immigrant who moved to NYC 13 years ago, and has been living in the bridge for the past year. He <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425175518/http://nypost.com/2014/04/15/cops-forced-me-to-live-in-the-manhattan-bridge/">told the Post</a> that he only moved inside the bridge because cops routinely tore down the encampment he built just off the bike on-ramp to the Manhattan Bridge. &quot;Five times they take down. Five times!&quot; he told them.</p>

<p>Joey (you can see a photo of him above, via James Nye) says that his new shanty is built into the underside of the upper deck of the bridge&#x2014;above the bike lanes, below car traffic&#x2014; about 150 feet east into the bridge&#x2019;s Brooklyn-bound side. He used discarded wood from Chinatown to fortify the space, which is about 10.5 square feet in total. </p>

<p>Joey <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425175518/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2605098/Revealed-The-man-lives-Manhattan-Bridge-emerges-tiny-shack-secretly-built-iconic-structure-home-past-year.html">told the Daily Mail</a> that he suffered a financial loss through gambling which led to his current homeless state. He also said that there are others who lived in or near to the bridge. </p>

<p>Police only discovered these spaces when Joey was spotted last Sunday climbing a fence to get to his &quot;coffin-sized living spaces;&quot; he was mistaken for a jumper, which led cops to discovering his shack. Even with the recent coverage of his living situation, cops have not taken it down. </p>
