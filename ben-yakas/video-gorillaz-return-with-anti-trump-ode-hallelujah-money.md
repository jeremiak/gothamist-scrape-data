<p>Gorillaz <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170918095322/http://pitchfork.com/news/68906-gorillaz-cartoon-drummer-russel-on-new-album-what-is-coming-will-come/">have been teasing</a> new music in recent months after spending six years or so in the wilderness. And now, on the eve of the inauguration, the Damon Albarn and Jamie Hewlett-created group <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170918095322/http://uproxx.com/music/gorillaz-hallelujah-money-video/2/">has released</a> its first new song since 2011, the anti-Trump ode &quot;Hallelujah Money&quot; featuring Benjamin Clementine. And the music video, directed by Giorgio Testi and Gorillaz, is seemingly set in a gold-plated elevator inside Trump Tower while various apocalyptic images (including the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170918095322/http://www.ibtimes.com/la-candelaria-spain-penitents-dress-members-ku-klux-klanfor-past-500-years-709864">La Candelaria brotherhood</a> in Spain) flash in the background.</p>

<p>They said in a press release about the new tune, &quot;Gorillaz returns after six years with the apocalyptic &apos;Hallelujah Money&apos; video, the first taste of their new record which is coming later this year. The band has issued this song on the eve of the Inauguration of President-Elect Donald Trump to serve as commentary on a politically-charged, historical moment.&quot;</p>

<p>It&apos;s unclear whether this tune, which has more of a gospel-influence than most of their major singles, will be included on the album, or if it&apos;s more of a one-off taster, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170918095322/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ue714d1V6I">like &quot;Rockit&quot;</a> was before <em>Demon Days</em>. You can read an interview with Clementine, a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170918095322/http://pitchfork.com/news/62199-benjamin-clementine-wins-the-mercury-prize/">Mercury Prize-winning</a> British singer/songwriter, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170918095322/http://www.okayplayer.com/news/new-artist-benjamin-clementine-interview-london-video.html">here.</a></p>

<p>Gorillaz aren&apos;t the only band to release an anti-Trump song this week: OK Go released a cover of Morrissey&apos;s anti-fascist classic &quot;Interesting Drug&quot; as well (&quot;There are some bad people on the rise&quot;) with a lot of Trump pics in the vid. &quot;It seems like the right soundtrack for this moment,&quot; the band said of the cover. &quot;No matter how anxious or angry you are, try to turn your passion into something good for the world. We&apos;re in this together. </p>

<p>They also performed the track on James Corden last night, which you can see below.</p>
