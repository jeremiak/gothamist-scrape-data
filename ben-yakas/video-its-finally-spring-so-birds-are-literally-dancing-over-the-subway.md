<p>We did it you guys: through sheer force of will and superhuman patience, we&apos;ve finally crossed winter&apos;s threshold into spring. No more <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130511002714/http://gothamist.com/tags/snow">snow days</a>, no more <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130511002714/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/10/stilettos_in_the_slush_photos_of_sl.php">stilettos in slush</a>, no more <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130511002714/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/25/winter_vomiting_disease_the_other_b.php">winter vomiting disease</a>. It&apos;s going to be <em>over 60 degrees this week,</em> damnit. This is cause for celebration&#x2014;which is exactly what the birds in the video below seem to be doing. First watch as they dance in the early evening skies over the L Train at Broadway Junction&#x2014;then go outside, take off your shoes, and frolic like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130511002714/http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=gYvw68IneV4">a nunchuck-wielding grampa.</a></p>
