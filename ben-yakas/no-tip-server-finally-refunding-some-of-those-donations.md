<p>A month ago, waitress Dayna Morales jumped into the public eye after she stood up to a bigoted customer who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160612031032/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/15/family_refuses_to_tip_nj_waitress_b.php#photo-1">denied her a tip because she is gay</a>. She received an outpouring of tips from supporters around the country, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160612031032/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/18/gay_nj_waitress_who_didnt_get_tip_f.php">promised to donate them</a> to the Wounded Warriors Project. Then it came out that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160612031032/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/26/family_we_didnt_stiff_gay_waitress.php#photo-1">she lied about the incident</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160612031032/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/27/receipt_saga_server_lied_about_havi.php#photo-1">lots of other things</a>, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160612031032/http://gothamist.com/2013/12/05/no_tip_server_hasnt_donated_anythin.php">hadn&apos;t donated anything to Wounded Warriors.</a> NBC reports that finally, some of those donations <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160612031032/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/New-Jersey-Waitress-Anti-Gay-Note-Receipt-Donations-Restaurant-234793341.html">have been refunded.</a></p>

<p>At least three people who sent money to a PayPal account set up in Morales&apos; name say their electronic donations were refunded this week. Brittney Stilgenbauer of Tuscon, Ariz, who encouraged Morales via Facebook to make the PayPal account, told them, &quot;I felt awful for her, and I thought it would be great if people could come together and donate a dollar each and make up for her tip that she lost.&quot; More people chimed in on Facebook that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160612031032/http://nj1015.com/some-dayna-morales-donations-refunded/">they received refunds as well.</a></p>

<p>However, at least one man who mailed cash to Morales at the restaurant said he has not gotten the money back. Stilgenbauer hopes Morales will &quot;return all the funds,&quot; adding &quot;hopefully her heart was in the right place and she&apos;s sorry.&quot; Morales has been suspended from her job at Gallop Asian Bistro as they continue to investigate. </p>
