<p>Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130524123818/http://www.cnn.com/2013/04/21/us/boston-attack/index.html?hpt=hp_t1">told reporters yesterday</a> that officials have &quot;a million questions&quot; to ask suspected 19-year-old <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130524123818/http://gothamist.com/tags/bostonmarathon">Boston marathon bomber Dzhokar Tsarnaev</a>. But Tsarnaev, who is under heavy guard at the hospital, is currently &quot;intubated and sedated&quot; with an unspecified injury to his throat; Boston police commissioner Ed Davis said <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130524123818/http://livewire.talkingpointsmemo.com/entry/police-wounded-boston-suspect-in-no-condition-to">on Fox News Sunday that</a> he is in &quot;no condition to speak&quot; but is &quot;progressing.&quot;</p>

<p>More information has come out about what Tsarnaev was up to in the days after the bombing: according to CNN, he was on the campus of University of Massachusetts-Dartmouth every day after the attack until late Thursday, when police released his photo to media. Tsarnaev attended classes as well as a dorm party on Wednesday night: &quot;He was just relaxed,&quot; said a fellow student, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130524123818/http://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2013/04/19/bombing-suspect-attended-umass-dartmouth-prompting-school-closure-college-friend-shocked-charge-boston-marathon-bomber/8gbczia4qBiWMAP0SQhViO/story.html">who asked the Boston Globe</a> not to print her name.</p>

<p>Another classmate who lives in the same dorm as Tsarnaev said students were joking at first when they saw the FBI photos on TV: &quot;We made a joke like, that could be Dzhokar,&quot; said Pamala Rolon. &quot;But then we thought it just couldn&apos;t be him. Dzhokar? Never.&quot;</p>

<p>Fellow Dartmouth student Andrew Glasby, who lived one floor below Tsarnaev, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130524123818/http://abcnews.go.com/US/umass-dartmouth-friend-dzhokhar-tsarnaev-acted-happened-day/story?id=19005157#.UXMyBTckR8E">told ABC he saw him</a> the day after the attack: &quot;I can&apos;t believe he had the balls to come back and act like nothing happened.&quot; Glasby said there was no indication anything was up with him: &quot;I thought as it was just regular old Jahar. We had a typical conversation, he was not startled, he was not scared, he was not anything. He was just the same old Jahar,&quot; he said.</p>

<p>Once Tsarnaev is able to communicate again, the government has invoked the public safety exception, a designation that allows investigators to question the teen without reading him his Miranda rights and without a lawyer present. This has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130524123818/http://www.cnn.com/2013/04/21/us/boston-suspect-miranda-rights/index.html?hpt=hp_c2">sparked a debate</a> among advocates, lawyers and legislators over the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130524123818/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/21/us/legal-questions-riddle-boston-marathon-case.html?hp&amp;_r=1&amp;">possible precedent set</a> by this move. </p>

<p>The public safety exception expires 48 hours after the arrest however. So some Republican lawmakers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130524123818/http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/04/20/capitol-hill-republicans-want-combatant-status-for-bombing-suspect-obama-yet-to/">are calling on Obama to declare</a><a> Tsarnaev a potential enemy combatant, which would then keep him from having a lawyer present and other legal rights under the &#x201C;Law of War&#x201D; so investigators can learn about other possible attacks.</a></p><a>
