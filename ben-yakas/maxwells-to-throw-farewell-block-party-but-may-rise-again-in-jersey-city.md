<p>At the end of this month, rock patrons will have to say farewell to beloved Hoboken music venue Maxwell&apos;s, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130820170700/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/03/noooooo_legendary_nj_institute_maxw.php">which is closing</a> after 35 years of hosting some of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130820170700/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/04/video_the_best_bands_played_maxwell.php">greatest rock and roll bands of all time.</a> At least they&apos;re going out big: the venue will be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130820170700/http://www.nj.com/hudson/index.ssf/2013/07/maxwells_goes_out_with_a_block_party_bash.html#incart_river_default">hosting a block party</a> on its final evening (Wednesday, July 31) on 11th Street between Washington Street and Hudson Place. Maybe they&apos;ll re-enact the &quot;Glory Days&quot; music video in full!</p>

<p>In addition, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130820170700/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324507404578592060891000092?mg=reno64-wsj.html?dsk=y">the Journal reports</a> that co-owner Todd Abramson has been in talks with White Eagle Hall owner Ben LoPiccolo about possibly opening up a new venue in Jersey City. &quot;I&apos;ve had a few conversations with Ben,&quot; Abramson said of LoPiccolo. &quot;My sense is that there would be much more support for what I do in Jersey City from both residents and the city itself than I&apos;m finding in Hoboken right now.&quot; </p>

<p>It&apos;s unclear whether this new venue would retain Maxwell&apos;s name, but it would certainly have its spirit: Abramson said he views Jersey City as the Brooklyn to Hoboken&apos;s Manhattan. &quot;I understand that the closing of Maxwell&apos;s creates a void in New Jersey and I&apos;d like to be the person to turn around and fill that void,&quot; he said. Until then, enjoy some up close and personal clips of Guided By Voices performing at Maxwell&apos;s in 2010.</p>
