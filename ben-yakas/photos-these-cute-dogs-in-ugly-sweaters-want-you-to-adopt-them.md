</div></div>					<p>The holidays are here, and you <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150404225922/http://gothamist.com/2013/12/20/ask_a_native_new_yorker_how_old_is.php">may or may not have a roommate around</a> to take eggnog shots with on Christmas morning. But you <em>could</em> have an adorable furry friend to keep you company! The ASPCA Adoption Center has six <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150404225922/http://gothamist.com/tags/dogs">doggies</a> who need new homes&#x2014;and they&apos;re wearing the ugliest sweaters they could find just for your amusement.</p>

<p>Most of these six pups have been with the ASPCA for awhile&#x2014;the sixth one above, Spice, has been with them since 2011, after living in squalid conditions in a basement without access to food or water. He was severely underweight (coming in at 32 pounds) when they first got him, but he&apos;s now up to a healthy 54 pounds. You can learn <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150404225922/http://www.aspca.org/blog/help-us-find-home-spice-holiday-season">more about him here</a>, and see him in action in the video below.</p>

<p>If you&apos;re interested in any of the dogs, you can <a href="www.aspca.org/Adopt">contact the ASPCA online here</a>. Their Adoption Center is located at 424 E 92nd St (between 1st and York Avenues) and their phone number is (212) 876-7700 ext. 4900.</p>
