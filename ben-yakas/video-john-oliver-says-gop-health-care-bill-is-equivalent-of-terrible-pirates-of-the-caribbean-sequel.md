<p>&quot;The American Health Care Act: You may not have wanted it. It looks awful. But it&apos;s here anyway. Try to think of it as the legislative equivalent of <em>Pirates of the Caribbean 5: The Curse of Johnny Depp Getting Divorced and Needing the Money</em>,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170315224422/http://gothamist.com/tags/johnoliver">John Oliver</a> said last night on <em>Last Week Tonight</em>.</p>

<p>&quot;Essentially, it seems people on both sides see the [American Health Care Act] as just being shitty Obamacare, the way Old Navy is a shitty version of the Gap, and the way Easter, let&apos;s be honest, should just be called Shitty Christmas,&quot; Oliver continued. But because there&apos;s still a chance this shitty bill could make its way through the shitty House and become a shitty law, Oliver took a closer look into what is actually inside the shitty bill.</p>

<p>Among his concerns is the age-based tax credit, which replaces Obamacare&apos;s income-based credit, and the &quot;really vicious&quot; changes to Medicaid: &quot;This plan is literally taking money from the poor and giving it to the very rich,&quot; Oliver said. &quot;It&apos;s essentially a reverse Bernie Sanders, which is actually also the name of a sex act consisting of very aggressive fingering.&quot; </p>

<p>He is also perplexed by the fact that six pages of the bill are devoted to a scenario that asks, &quot;What if one poor person suddenly becomes less poor?&quot; As he put it, &quot;I&apos;m honestly surprised they did&apos;t also have a section covering what would happen in a Freaky Friday-type situation!&quot; Watch Oliver draft his own Freaky Friday clause, then enlist Catheter Cowboy to help explain the AHCA to Trump.</p>
