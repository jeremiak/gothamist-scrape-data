<p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111228022215/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/20/video_beating_bums_is_still_a_thing.php">we were horrified by</a> the video of two New Jersey men beating up a homeless man, seemingly for fun. Taylor Giresi, 20, and a 17-year-old accomplice were both arrested and charged with aggravated assault; they&apos;re also accused of stealing 50-year-old victim David Ivins bicycle as well. And now, Ivins <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111228022215/http://www.myfoxny.com/dpp/news/homeless-man-in-video-beating-has-seizure-belmar-20111222-APX">has reportedly suffered a seizure.</a></p>

<p>In the aftermath of the cruel beating, Ivins <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111228022215/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2011/12/21/homeless-beating-victim-speaks-out-as-nj-residents-offer-helping-hand/">described the experience to CBS</a>: &#x201C;No good people, man. No good kids or youngsters. I think they should go away man...Scared me man&#x2014;kicking me in the face and kicking me in the chest.&quot; There was an outpouring of donations for Ivins, including a motel offering him a room for two weeks. </p>

<p>A heavy drinker, Ivins said he hoped to use the terrible experience to turn his life around: &#x201C;I&#x2019;m going to my mom&#x2019;s, people that support me. I&#x2019;m going get into a program, met a friend today who&#x2019;s gonna find me work when I get back,&#x201D; he said. But when he was at the Belmar Police Department Wednesday night picking up a bicycle that had been donated to him, he was rushed to the hospital. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111228022215/http://www.app.com/article/20111222/NJNEWS/312220086/David-Ivins-homeless-man-beaten-YouTube-video-out-hospital?odyssey=nav%7Chead">APP reports he is </a>in stable condition now, and has been released.</p>

<p>You can see the stomach-churning original compilation video below, which includes the two attackers beating, stealing from and taunting Ivins in Wall Township.<br>
