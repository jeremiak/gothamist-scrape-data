<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429171715/http://gothamist.com/tags/stpatricksday">St. Patrick&apos;s <strike>Day</strike> Month</a> may have kicked off earlier this month with the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429171715/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/02/bloomberg_booed_at_rockaways_st_pat.php">ritual booing of the Bloomberg in the Rockaways</a>, but it really hit its peak this weekend with the massive Manhattan parade yesterday. And just as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429171715/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/15/st_patricks_video_psa_reasons_not_t.php">in years past</a>, plenty of people did <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429171715/http://www.uproxx.com/tv/2013/03/15-ways-to-spend-st-patricks-day-like-jimmy-mcnulty/#page/1">their best McNulty impersonations</a> and got up to some booze-fueled trouble, whether they were fighting in the streets or on mass transit. To add to the sense of deja vu, check out the video below of a fight at the Times Square McDonald&apos;s&#x2014;there was a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429171715/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/20/video_crazy_st_patricks_west_villag.php">crazy fight at a McDonald&apos;s last year as well.</a></p>

<p>Saturday was not the official St. Patrick&apos;s Day (that would be today), and perhaps it&apos;s more appropriate that all this bad behavior happened yesterday&#x2014;because the problem is not the celebration, but rather those people (from every walk of life) who use the occasion as an excuse to get aggressively drunk in public. Like the folks who fought in the street in this video:</p>

<p>Or these people:</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429171715/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/15/st_patricks_video_psa_reasons_not_t.php">And as expected</a>, there were plenty of obnoxious folks clogging up mass transit last night: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429171715/http://www.northjersey.com/news/Onboard_fight_disrupts_service_on_NJ_Transit_train.html">16 people were ejected</a> from a five-car NJ Transit train because of fighting. The train even had to make an emergency stop in Rutherford as a result (in the end, only two people were given disorderly conduct tickets). There were also ejections on Metro North:</p>

<p>But of course, not every drunk reveler was looking to start a fight&#x2014;there were also the friendly drunks just looking for an opportunity to dance embarrassingly! And that they did, whether or not it was before noon.</p>
