Kang Wong was charged with jaywalking, resisting arrest and disorderly conduct <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140805221041/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/19/cops_allegedly_beat_elderly_man_for.php">for the stop on January 19th.</a> Cops have now <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140805221041/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/charges-dropped-manhattan-man-84-jaywalking-ticket-cops-lawyer-article-1.1751027">dropped all charges</a> against Wong, leaving him with the satisfying knowledge that cops detained him, scared and confused him, knocked him to the ground, and caused him to black out for no good reason.</p>

<p>Wong, who speaks mainly Cantonese and Spanish, told reporters previously that he believed the traffic signal was green when he started to cross the street at West 96th and Broadway, but admitted the light may have turned red by the time he reached the other side of the street. An officer then asked him for ID: &#x201C;I was very puzzled and I was very scared. I had no idea why I had been stopped. I used Cantonese and said give me back my ID,&quot; Wong told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140805221041/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-man-ticketed-jaywalking-file-5b-lawsuit-article-1.1592002">the News through a translator.</a></p>

<p>The cop declined. Other officers arrived, and Wong says, &quot;I got more scared.&quot; He claims he was pushed to the ground and knocked unconscious. When he came to, he was in handcuffs and his head was bleeding. Witnesses said the language barrier led to a lot of confusion between the officers and the elderly man, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140805221041/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/21/nypd_nothing_excessive_about_arrest.php">police insisted</a> they didn&apos;t use &quot;excessive force.&quot;</p>

<p>The NYPD gave out <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140805221041/http://gothamist.com/2014/03/15/nypd_issued_452_jaywalking_tickets.php">452 tickets for jaywalking</a> to pedestrians during the first two months of 2014, a 900% increase from the same period in 2013. Wong is suing the city over the incident for $5 million.</p>
