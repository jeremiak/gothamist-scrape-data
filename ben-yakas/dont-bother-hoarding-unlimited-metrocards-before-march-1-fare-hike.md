<p>In case you forgot, the MTA&apos;s latest round of fare hikes is right around the corner&#x2014;they officially kick in on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160630052516/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/19/watch_the_mta_hike_your_fare_live.php">March 1st, 2013</a>. And if you&apos;ve been plotting ways of ripping off the system during the transition period, you&apos;ll be sad to learn there are no <em>Punch-Drunk Love</em>-esque fine print loopholes. All monthly and weekly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160630052516/http://gothamist.com/tags/metrocard">Metrocards</a> bought before the fare increases <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160630052516/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/play_your_metrocards_right_dtuBmcQGgvKEfyi0tE0ogI?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20Local">must be swiped by March 11th</a> in order to get their &quot;full value.&quot; So don&apos;t bother trying to hoard Metrocards, unless you want to end up like the guy in the video below.</p>

<p>Monthly MetroCards bought before the hike won&#x2019;t be valid after April 9th, while weekly ones will expire on March 17th. To be fair, the MTA is giving people an 11-day window with monthly&#x2014;if you time things out right, you can at least maximize your last monthly. But for anyone buying single rides, you&apos;ll get no sympathy: the .25 cent hike will be deducted from pay-per-ride cards starting on March 1st, regardless of when the cards were bought. </p>

<p>And don&apos;t forget: the MTA is adding a $1 fee to all MetroCards bought after March 3rd, as a way to encourage people to recycle their cards instead of getting new ones. To review, here&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160630052516/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/10/final_metrocard_fare_hike_plan_incl.php">all the other basic facts</a> of the upcoming fare hike: a single ride will now cost $2.50 if you spend more than $5 on a MetroCard you will be awarded a 5 percent bonus, 7-day unlimited ride MetroCards will cost $30, and 30-day unlimited ride MetroCards will cost $112. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160630052516/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/20/fare_hike_metrocard_math_how_much_d.php">And by our math</a>, that means: you need to spend just $11.90 to get exactly five rides. You must ride the subway 13 times (two rides per workday and three on the weekend) to make a 7-day MetroCard worthwhile. And you must ride the subway 48 times (two rides per workday and eight on the weekend) to make a 30-day unlimited MetroCard worthwhile. </p>

<p>And for the record, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160630052516/http://gothamist.com/2012/11/25/confirmed_swiping_20_bill_through_s.php">$20 bills still are not accepted substitutes</a> for Metrocards.</p>
