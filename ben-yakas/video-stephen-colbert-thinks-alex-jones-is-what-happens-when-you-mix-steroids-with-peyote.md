<p>After starting last night&apos;s show with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170914122942/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96JSyxNMk8">a series of jokes</a> about Donald Trump&apos;s visit to the Museum of African-American History and Culture, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170914122942/http://gothamist.com/tags/stephencolbert">Stephen Colbert</a> took a step back to consider Trump&apos;s delicate temperament: &quot;I hope that doesn&apos;t upset Donald Trump, because he&apos;s a bit of a hothead, loose cannon, powder keg, dump truck, which is why it&apos;s important for him to be counseled by people who are even-keeled,&quot; Colbert, who has become <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170914122942/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/22/arts/television/colbert-fallon-trump-late-night.html?_r=0">the king of late night</a> ever since he took the kid gloves off post-election, said. &quot;Unfortunately, he&apos;s talking to some jerk named Alex Jones, the far-right conspiracy theorist who is apparently taking on a new role as occasional information source and validator for Trump, with whom he sometimes speaks on the phone.&quot;</p>

<p>After showing one clip of Jones&apos; unhinged ravings, Colbert noted, &quot;This is why you don&apos;t mix steroids with peyote! I don&apos;t know how to explain this, but just watching that clip, he somehow got spittle on me.&quot; After showing a few more clips of Jones ranting, so that we could all judge him on more than one isolated, dumb-ass clip, Colbert recapped, &quot;one of the counselors to the president knows what it sounds like when a monkey fucks a football. But Alex Jones is not content with talking to the leader of the free world. He&apos;s also hoping InfoWars will qualify for a White House press credential. So, to those of you working in the White House press pool, you&apos;re going to want to get some earplugs and a poncho.&quot;</p>

<p>Colbert also covered the potential Michigan Senate battle royale between Ted Nugent and Kid Rock. &quot;It&apos;s gonna be a tough choice. This is really going to split the &apos;Uncle who sells you fireworks&apos; vote,&quot; Colbert noted. </p>
