Variety <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150409201826/http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118023190.html?categoryid=1237&amp;cs=1">reports</a> that Tom Hanks and Sandra Bullock are close to signing on for the film version of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150409201826/http://gothamist.com/2009/11/17/jonathan_safran_foer_writer.php">Jonathan Safran Foer&apos;s</a> divisive 2005 novel &quot;Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close,&quot; which tells the story of a 9-year-old boy whose father died on 9/11. </p>

<p>The book, which was one of the first American novels to incorporate the Sept. 11 events into the plot, was adapted by Eric Roth, who also wrote screenplays for <em>Forrest Gump</em> and <em>The Curious Case of Benjamin Button</em>. We can only cross our fingers and our hearts that the movie turns out to be the hybrid 9/11 rom-com-drama we&apos;ve all been waiting for.  </p>
