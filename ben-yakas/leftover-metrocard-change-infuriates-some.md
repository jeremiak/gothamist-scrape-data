It&apos;s bumming everyone out, according to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150127021114/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2009/11/30/2009-11-30_leftover_fares_adding_up_to_big_pile_of_metrocards.html?r=ny_local&amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+nydnrss%2Fny_local+(NY+Local)">Daily News today</a>. Ever since the MTA changed how it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150127021114/http://gothamist.com/2009/06/26/subway_bus_fare_hike_goes_into_effe.php">formulated the bonuses on pay-per-ride cards</a>, from 20% (buy five trips, get a sixth for free) to 15%, New Yorkers have been accumulating Metrocards with unusable spare change on them, while the MTA has been absorbing that decent chunk of unused change!<p></p>

<p>The News talked to a couple frustrated New Yorkers about those nagging dollars and cents, and direct people to Jim Schwartz, who with friends created a Transit Calculator/Spreadsheet to help figure out what denominations to put on a card to wind up with a zero balance at the end <strong>($4.50, $6.75, $15.65, $29.35, $31.30, $45, $60.65, $74.35 or $76.30).</strong> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150127021114/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local-beat/Time-to-Clean-Up-Your-MetroCard-Act-78133467.html">NBC New York</a> points you to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150127021114/http://www.metrocardbonuscalculator.com/">the Metrocard Bonus Calculator</a>.) </p>

<p>The News even stumbles upon what sounds like an ancient proverb, but could also work as an ad campaign: <strong>&quot;They won&apos;t make a turnstile spin, but they&apos;re not exactly worthless.&quot;</strong>  Then again, some of these straphangers could <b>refill</b> their Metrocards&#x2014;or is that too <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150127021114/http://gothamist.com/2009/11/20/metrocard.php">&quot;optimistic&quot;</a>?</p>
