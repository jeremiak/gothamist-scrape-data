<p>If you think back to the halcyon days of fall 2011, when <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150219124947/http://gothamist.com/tags/occupywallstreet">Occupy Wall Street</a> was still in full swing, you may recall a big debate about public space and free speech that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150219124947/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/18/bloomberg_occupy_wall_streets_tents.php">ignited</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150219124947/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/11/bloomberg_and_brookfield_playing_ho.php">tensions</a> between the Bloomberg administration and protesters in Zuccotti Park. OWS brought to the public&apos;s attention the fact that there are a shocking lack of protected public spaces for free speech and protest in NYC&#x2014;and that is the subject of a design competition, exhibit and architectural symposium happening in Manhattan this month.</p>

<p>Theatrum Mundi, in partnership with the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150219124947/http://aiany.aiany.org/index.php?section=aia-new-york">AIA New York</a>, have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150219124947/http://designingforfreespeech.org/details/">launched &quot;Designing for Free Speech,&quot;</a> which centers around &quot;designing spaces in NYC that stimulate the rights enshrined in the First Amendment.&quot; Applicants were asked to submit designs that proposed &quot;architectural or performative designs (temporary or permanent) that transform spaces in New York City into places for public &#x201C;demonstration.&#x201D; This challenge is less about finding the ideal places for free expression than it is about re-imagining and idealizing existing spaces that have the potential for animating the public, especially spaces that are not traditionally considered in this frame.&quot;</p>

<p>The results are fascinating, with 40 different proposals with a huge range of ideas: Occupy Museums <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150219124947/http://designingforfreespeech.org/gallery/reclamation-of-the-david-h-koch-plaza-at-the-met-for-the-public/">wants to</a> &quot;re-common&quot; the Met, turning &quot;the fountains into ritual baths, cleansing the faux-public space of the stench of Koch;&quot; one group <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150219124947/http://designingforfreespeech.org/gallery/free-speech-in-sky/">wants to</a> get rid of all vehicular traffic and put public space art in Times Square; another group <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150219124947/http://designingforfreespeech.org/gallery/the-publics-pulpit/">wants to</a> put soapboxes in Duffy Square, ala Hyde Park; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150219124947/http://designingforfreespeech.org/gallery/ny-public-library-speak-to-5th-avenue-speak-to-the-world/">someone wants to</a> convert the stairs of the New York Public Library (looking at the 5th Avenue) into a stage for public speech; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150219124947/http://designingforfreespeech.org/gallery/bike-flocks-bedford-hub/">another wants to convert</a> the area near the Bedford L train station into a &apos;bike flock hub.&apos; </p>

<p>Then there are the more mobile ideas, like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150219124947/http://designingforfreespeech.org/gallery/speechbubble/">the team that wants</a> to inflate an interview tent, and conduct a short interview from inside of it; or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150219124947/http://designingforfreespeech.org/gallery/industrial-up-cycling-the-pop-up-soapbox/">the group that wants</a> to send a pop-up soapbox around the city; or the designers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150219124947/http://designingforfreespeech.org/gallery/free-speech-on-the-go/">who want to</a> transmit &#x201C;free speech&#x201D; live via a Skype-based system on cabs, trains and other vehicles.</p>

<p>And that rundown barely scratches the surface of the variety of ideas. You can peruse (and vote on) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150219124947/http://designingforfreespeech.org/gallery/">all the submissions at their website here</a>. </p>

<p>In addition to the ideas competition, there is also a simpatico program entitled <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150219124947/http://cfa.aiany.org/index.php?section=upcoming&amp;expid=277">&quot;Open to the Public: Civic Space Now&quot;</a> at the Center for Architecture on LaGuardia Place. The exhibit opens on June 12th and runs through September 6th; and there is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150219124947/http://cfa.aiany.org/index.php?section=calendar&amp;evtid=7231">a symposium on the subject</a> all day next Saturday, June 14th.</p>
