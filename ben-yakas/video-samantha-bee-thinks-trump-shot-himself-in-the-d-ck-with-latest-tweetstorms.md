<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170925123838/http://gothamist.com/tags/samanthabee">Samantha Bee</a> returned to TV last night after <em>Full Frontal</em> had a few weeks off, and she picked a hell of a day to do so. Because a majority of her staff was out for the A Day Without Woman protest, she was stuck doing basketball jokes for her four remaining male staff members.</p>

<p>But after that, she got back to what she does best: keeping track of the latest moves of &quot;America&apos;s one man white supremacist employment program.&quot; Among other things, she focused on Trump&apos;s conspiracy theory tweetstorm about Obama wiretapping him, which she argued was the equivalent of shooting &#x201C;himself in the d---.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;To be fair, there&#x2019;s a good chance Trump fell asleep watching news, rolled over on the remote, and woke up during <em>The Wire</em>. Mr. President, that&#x2019;s not Barack Obama. I mean, I get why you&#x2019;d think Obama would &#x2018;tapp&#x2019; your phone, just look at how angry he is and obsessed with you,&quot; she continued, pointing to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170925123838/http://gothamist.com/2017/02/07/obama_kitesurfing_branson.php">Obama&#x2019;s magical vacation photos</a>. &quot;He can barely stay up on that surfboard from all the rage and hatred for your administration.&quot;</p>

<p>In another segment, she tried to shame Scott Walker into being a better governor in her newest bit, <em>Governor Scott Walker Has A Horrifying Relationship With Food: A Full Frontal Insta-Vestigation.</em></p>

<p>At the end of the episode, she took a moment to rip apart the Republican&apos;s Obamacare Lite bill, which she said ranked somewhere &quot;between Cosby and O&apos;Reilly&quot; in terms of terrible bills: &quot;After seven years of procrastination, the Republican House pounded some Red Bull and pulled an all-nighter to get their Trumpcare assignment in&#x2014;and it showed.&quot;</p>
