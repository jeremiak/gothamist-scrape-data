<p>This week, a group of SoHo residents <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507080020/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/19/soho_residents_file_lawsuit_for_cit.php">filed a lawsuit against the city</a> to have the 43-slot <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507080020/http://gothamist.com/tags/citibike">Citi Bike</a> docking station removed from Petrosino Park and relocated down the street. That group has collected over 600 petition signatures and 132 letters to the DOT, who haven&apos;t budged yet. But there have been a handful of stations which have been moved, or removed entirely&#x2014;but apparently, you have to be rich or famous to get it to happen.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507080020/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/wheelin_dealin_om4Ac5MHi7EJjRsjjOywwJ">Post reports today</a> that 10 Citi Bike stations have been removed since the program launched in May, most of which are in front of fancy condos, town houses and co-ops. Those locations also include Barry Diller&#x2019;s IAC Building in Chelsea, and a Spring Street condo where actor John Slattery lives.</p>

<p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;ve been disappointed to see Citi Bike stations moved in wealthier neighborhoods,&#x201D; said attorney Jim Walden, who filed the injunction on behalf of the SoHo group this week. &#x201C;You would think [the city] would want to avoid even the appearance that struggling artists would be treated differently than highfalutin financiers.&#x201D; </p>

<p>Attorney Steven Sladkus added that he was able to successfully remove three stations from wealthy clients&apos; luxury buildings without even having to file court papers. And he sounds almost guilty about it: &#x201C;I can guarantee you won&#x2019;t see a Citi Bike rack in front of Mayor Bloomberg&#x2019;s town house&#x201D; when the program expands north of 59th Street,&quot; Sladkus said. &#x201C;Maybe the same [courtesy] should have been given to all other property owners in the city.&#x201D;</p>

<p>But you may be asking yourself right now: what about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507080020/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/01/video_conservative_who_represents_m.php">the all-powerful bike lobby</a>? Aren&apos;t city council people and community leaders <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507080020/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/08/video_extremist_anti-bike_share_col.php">&quot;terrorized by this thing that really exists&quot;</a>? Certainly they&apos;re not going to stand by and allow &quot;the majority of [inordinately wealthy] citizens&quot; to get in the way of their dastardly plans to begrime the city, one blazing blue bike at a time.</p>
