Ex-con Kendall Major, 35, and girlfriend Tosheba Alford, 20, fled the scene after they killed Quinton Guerrero in Mott Haven early Saturday morning. &quot;<strong>It was brutal. It was terrible. There were a lot of people watching from their windows and no one was doing anything,</strong>&quot; said livery cab driver Angel Ruiz, who tried to break up the fight.</p>

<p>Major and Alford were taking a cab to visit Major&#x2019;s brother when they got off in front of 480 East 138th Street. Major was paying Ruiz for the ride when Alford started talking to Guerrero, who was passing by; it is unknown what they argued about, but the woman &quot;got in the face&quot; of the older man. One thing led to another, and the couple knocked Guerrero to the ground and started punching him and stomping on his head with their feet, according to cops and witnesses. Ruiz <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629091809/http://www.ny1.com/content/top_stories/137938/pair-of-suspects-charged-with-fatal-bronx-beating">gave police</a> a description of the two, who were caught at a parking lot nearby. The New York State Federation of Taxi Drivers will present Ruiz with a $500 reward later today.</p>

<p>Neighbors <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629091809/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/bronx/brutal_beating_death_of_bronx_man_5W8oQae0SQSxr0p6zAVYQP?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">were shocked</a> at the brutal beating of Guerrero: &#x201C;I feel saddened, everyone in the neighborhood knew him. If something were to happen, he would jump in. He would get involved. He was one of those upstanding guys,&#x201D; said David Soto, who added that Guerrero was a retired Verizon technician. Both Major and Alford have long arrest records: Major has 26 prior arrests dating back to 1990, including multiple busts for robbery, marijuana possession and assault, and two stints in jail for robbery, attempted robbery and grand larceny. Alford has four prior arrests, including robbery and gang assault.</p>
