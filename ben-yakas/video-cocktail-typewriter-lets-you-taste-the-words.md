<p>Even if cocktail culture <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170223012131/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/18/extra_extra_2016.php">is destroying bartending</a>, perhaps the gadget above can inspire a new bartyping trend? Designer Morskoiboy has created a drink-concocting typewriter that converts words into cocktails. You can read all about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170223012131/http://www.morskoiboy.com/">how he made his invention here</a>, which involved pumps, pipes and multicolored syrups.
