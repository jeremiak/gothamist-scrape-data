<p>Stephen Colbert kicked off his show last night with the most important piece of news: Beyonce&apos;s pregnancy announcement&#x2014;&quot;She dropped the knowledge today with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170914132026/http://laist.com/2017/02/01/beyonce_twins.php">this photo on Instagram</a> showing us her baby bump at what appears to be a very open-minded Sears portrait studio.&quot; Unfortunately, he then had to move on to another prominent person of color, Donald Trump (&quot;He&apos;s a rainbow coalition from the neck up&quot;): &quot;What better way to celebrate Black History Month than to have African-Americans listen to a rich white guy complain that the world is unfair to him?&quot; Watch below as Trump names black people he&apos;s heard of.</p>

<p>Over at <em>Late Night with Seth Meyers,</em> writer Amber Ruffin literally read between the lines of Trump&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170914132026/https://twitter.com/ddale8/status/826822342961745922">Tuesday speech</a>, which mostly dealt with some petty grievances. Somehow, she was able to laugh through the president&apos;s profound ignorance: &quot;Here we learn he likes Frederick Douglass so much he thinks he&apos;s still alive. I think that&apos;s <em>great</em>!&quot;</p>

<p>Meyers also had a few things to say about Trump&apos;s Supreme Court pick, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170914132026/http://dcist.com/2017/01/trump_gives_the_supreme_court_nomin.php">Neil Gorsuch</a>, who &quot;looks like the silhouette Facebook gives you when you don&#x2019;t have a profile picture yet.&quot; He also had choice words about the manner in which Trump made the announcement: &quot;Americans only like reality shows because they have nothing to do with reality,&quot; he said. &quot;No one would enjoy <em>The Bachelor</em> if it had real world consequences. &apos;If he gives her the rose, abortions will be illegal!&apos;&quot;</p>

<p>And Trevor Noah covered the Black History Month speech as well, though he&apos;s not entirely sure if Trump can tell the difference between a bust of Martin Luther King Jr. and Barack Obama.</p>
