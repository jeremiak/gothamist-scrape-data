<p>Somehow in his nearly 50 year long cinematic career as a writer and director, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501174751/http://gothamist.com/tags/woodyallen">Woody Allen</a> has never cast himself as a pimp. Not officially at least: considering the fact that he has regularly paired himself with beautiful starlets such as Diane Keaton, Mariel Hemingway, Charlotte Rampling, Mira Sorvino, Dianne Wiest, Mia Farrow, Goldie Hawn, Helen Hunt, Kirstie Alley and Elisabeth Shue in his films, he pretty clearly views himself as a pimp of sorts. But Allen will have to thank John Turturro for finally making that subtext overt in his upcoming comedy, <em>Fading Gigolo</em>. Check out the trailer below.</p>

<p>The film, which was written and directed by Turturro, actually looks like a slightly charming/slightly awkward late-period Allen film, with a few big name actors (Sharon Stone, Liev Schreiber, Sof&#xED;a Vergara) taking supporting roles and a charmingly breezy tone in the trailer. Allen looks snappier than he did in his last film role in <em>To Rome With Love</em>, and it seems as though there&apos;s a bruised romantic-comedy heart beating under the absurd premise. </p>

<p>It&apos;s pretty clear that Turturro is going for absurd by casting himself as the titular middle-aged gigolo. And after spending the last couple of years making paychecks as comic relief in <em>Transformers</em> movies, who could blame Turturro for wanting to stretch out with something that&apos;s more quirky than mindless?</p>
