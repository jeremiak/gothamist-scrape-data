<p>The nasty campaign for Brooklyn DA just took a turn for the dank: democratic DA candidate <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504132750/http://gothamist.com/tags/kenthompson">Ken Thompson</a> vowed yesterday that if elected, he will order prosecutors to throw out nearly all cases involving less than 15 grams of pot. &quot;These arrests are clogging the criminal-justice system,&quot; Thompson <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504132750/http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304069604579155723777051460?mod=WSJ_NY_MIDDLETopStories">told the WSJ.</a> This ought keep <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504132750/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/18/is_there_a_weed_fairy_roaming_throu.php">the Weed Fairy</a> in business a little longer.</p>

<p>The NYPD has seemingly made good on their promise to cut back on meaningless <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504132750/http://gothamist.com/tags/marijuana">low-level marijuana possession</a>&#x2014;arrests for weed possession are on track to fall by 20% in 2013, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504132750/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/12/marijuana_arrests_keep_falling_nypd.php">police say that overall enforcement</a> of marijuana laws are taking a back seat to drugs that can actually kill you (marijuana is, after all, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504132750/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/29/marijuana_is_most_popular_least_dea.php">most popular, least deadly illegal drug in the whole world</a>). Nevertheless, <strong>12,732 people were arrested in Brooklyn last year for possessing small amounts of marijuana. </strong></p>

<p>And Thompson thinks that&apos;s a ridiculous figure: &quot;I&apos;m going to treat possession of small amounts of marijuana as violations, the way the governor is calling for,&quot; he told the Journal. &quot;If the [state] Senate Republicans are not willing to pass that law, then I don&apos;t think the people of Brooklyn can wait.&quot; </p>

<p>Supporters of Thompson&apos;s opponent, current DA Charles Hynes, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504132750/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/03/charles_hynes_wont_die_da_is_runnin.php">who is running as a Republican</a> after losing the Democratic primary, don&apos;t sound in favor of this attitudinal change: &quot;He is not even D.A. yet and he&apos;s deciding not to uphold the legislation that&apos;s part of the state of New York&apos;s penal code?&quot; said Hynes supporter State Sen. Martin Golden. Nevertheless, about 70% of all those arrested in Brooklyn for low-level marijuana possession over the last three years have had their charges dismissed.</p>

<p>A Gallup poll released this week shows that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504132750/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/22/58_of_americans_support_legalizing.php">58% of Americans support legalizing marijuana.</a> State Senator Liz Krueger has been trying to take a page from other states and push for a law that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504132750/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/18/state_senator_to_introduce_legislat.php">would decriminalize, regulate and tax marijuana in New York state</a>. While we may be a few decades away from that becoming a reality, easing off on the low-level pot arrests and prosecutions is certainly a step in the right direction. </p>
