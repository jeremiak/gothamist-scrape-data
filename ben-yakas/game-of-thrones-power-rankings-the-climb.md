<p>Last week on <em>Game Of Thrones</em>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505002833/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/29/game_of_thrones_power_rankings_kiss.php">we had an</a> unlikely resurrection, a beheading, and some hanky panky beyond The Wall. This week, we had a treacherous climb up The Wall, more marriage negotiations, and got to look inside Arya&apos;s eyes. Since the show is all about how people jockey for power, we&apos;ve decided to follow along this season with our <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505002833/http://gothamist.com/tags/gameofthronespowerrankings">Game of Thrones Power Rankings</a>&#x2014;aka, who is owning this week.</p>

<p><strong>Game Of Thrones Power Rankings, Week 6:</strong></p>

<p><strong>1. Tywin Lannister</strong>: As the Queen of Thorns describes him during their meeting, &quot;it&apos;s a rare enough thing: a man who lives up to this reputation.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>2. Oleanna Redwyne</strong>: Bested this week by Tywin Lannister, but only barely. She still got the best lines of the week, including her description of Loras as a &quot;sword-swallower through and through.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>3. Robb Stark</strong>: Another king negotiating an arranged marriage&#x2014;this one involving his unhappy Uncle Edmure.</p>

<p><strong>4. Littlefinger</strong>: Went full moustache-twirling villain this week, talking in a rasp to Varys, allowing Joffrey to murder Ros for fun, and embracing chaos in a fun little speech. </p>

<p><strong>5. Jon Snow</strong>: After surviving his climb up The Wall, this &quot;proper lover&quot; got a nice romantic end-of-episode moment with Ygritte, who seems to genuinely love him.</p>

<p><strong>6. Tyrion Lannister</strong>: Bonds with his sister for once, but knows he&apos;s &quot;truly fucked.&quot; Or as he later puts it to Shae and Sansa: &quot;This is awkward.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>7. Beric Dondarrion</strong>: He didn&apos;t do much this week besides let Melissandre fondle his lost eye, but the guy has been resurrected six times, for crissakes.</p>

<p><strong>8. Thoros of Myr</strong>: We learned a lot more backstory about everyone&apos;s favorite drunk resurrecting priest&#x2014;turns out he wasn&apos;t a very good priest most of the time.</p>

<p><strong>9. Melissandre</strong>: The Red Priestess seems almost jealous that the Lord of Light has blessed Thoros with the ability to resurrect. She also gets more than an eyeful of Arya.</p>

<p><strong>10. Jaime Lannister:</strong> And once again, Jaime finds himself on the verge of being free because of who he is. Unfortunately, things don&apos;t look as rosy for new best pal Brienne. </p>

<p><strong>11. Sansa Stark</strong>: As ever, the Stark ladies have it pretty bad this week. At first, Sansa feels like she is in a dream thanks to her awkwardly brief union with Loras (a man who has long dreamed of all aspects of his wedding...except, ya know, the wife). And that&apos;s the good part of the episode for her&#x2014;before she finds out who she really is marrying.</p>

<p><strong>12. Arya Stark</strong>: Comes face to face with Melissandre for the first (but not last) time. Becomes disenchanted with the Brotherhood Without Banners. And finds out she&apos;s been shooting the bow and arrow wrong all these years.</p>

<p><strong>13. Bran Stark</strong>: Starting to get the impression that there are some downsides to being a worg.</p>

<p><strong>14. Samwell Tarly</strong>: Learns how to make fire, gets to show off his singing voice to Gilly. All in all, not his most useless week. </p>

<p><strong>15. Rickon Stark</strong>: He had a line this week! Welcome to the rankings, little guy. </p>

<p><em>The Viserys Targeryen Memorial Least Powerful Person Of The Week Award:</em> Theon Greyjoy: Still being tortured by a sadistic guy in a dungeon. Rinse and repeat for the rest of the season!</p>

<p><strong>Not Applicable:</strong> No sign of Daenerys Targaryen and her crew across the Narrow Sea; not much from Joffrey besides the flash of him killing Ros; no checking in with Stannis Barratheon and his crazy wife; Mance Rayder and Ser Bronn are absent yet again. Hopefully they&apos;ll be back soon.</p>

<p>Until then, here&apos;s the <em>Game Of Thrones</em> opening done &apos;50s-style.</p>
