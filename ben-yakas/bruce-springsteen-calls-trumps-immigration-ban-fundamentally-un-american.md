<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170626124906/http://gothamist.com/tags/brucespringsteen">Bruce Springsteen</a> and the E Street Band are on the other side of the world touring in Australia this month, but that doesn&apos;t mean they&apos;ve been tuning out all of the (mostly terrible) news coming out of the United States. During last night&apos;s show in Adelaide, Springsteen made an impassioned speech supporting protesters against <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170626124906/http://gothamist.com/tags/muslimban">Trump&apos;s immigration ban</a>: &quot;Tonight, we want to add our voices to the thousands of Americans who are protesting at airports around our country the Muslim ban and the detention of foreign nationals and refugees. America is a nation of immigrants and we find this anti-democratic and fundamentally un-American.&quot;</p>

<p>Springsteen then played wonderful deep-cut &quot;American Land,&quot; which he called &quot;an immigrant&#x2019;s song.&quot; You can see an older performance of the track below.</p>

<p>Last week after Trump&apos;s inauguration and the subsequent Women&apos;s March on Washington, Springsteen also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170626124906/http://gothamist.com/2017/01/23/springsteen_womens_march.php">pledged his support to protesters</a>, calling those who marched &quot;the new American resistance.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;[They] rallied against hate and division, and in support of tolerance, inclusion, reproductive rights, civil rights, racial justice, LGBTQ rights, the environment, wage equality, gender equality, healthcare, and immigrant rights,&quot; he said. &quot;We stand with you. We are the new American resistance.&quot;</p>
