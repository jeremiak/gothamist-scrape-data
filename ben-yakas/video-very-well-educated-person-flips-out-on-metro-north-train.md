<p>In this instant classic video, a self-described &quot;very well-educated person&quot; chews out the train conductor for doing her job. It&apos;s such fun when very well-educated people throw tantrums! According <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429120428/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V2G0fyQgck&amp;feature=player_embedded">to the person who uploaded the video</a> to YouTube, the woman had been talking too loudly on the train when the conductor &quot;politely asked her to keep it down and stop using profanity or to take it to the vestibule.&quot; This is where the video picks up, with the &quot;educated&quot; woman getting more and more irate over the perceived insult: </p>

<p>Ultimately, the well-educated star of the video asks the conductor: &quot;Please repeat to me the words I was being profane with...do you know how well educated I am?&quot; (Well-educated enough to speak in unnecessarily complicated sentences?) She then <em>demands they stop the train for her</em>, and it all comes to a head when she declares: <strong>&quot;I&apos;m not a crazy person, I&apos;m a very well-educated person.&quot;</strong> And the Supreme Court has ROUNDLY rejected prior restraint!</p>

<p>We give a lot of credit to the conductor, who keeps her cool during the whole interaction, and doesn&apos;t raise her voice once. Best of all, according to the video&apos;s uploader there was an announcement on the train a minute later, asking all passengers to please not use profanity on the train, <strong>&quot;especially those people who went to Harvard or Yale or are from Westport.&quot;</strong> Pshaw, as if the Crimson elite would deign to follow such commands.</p>
