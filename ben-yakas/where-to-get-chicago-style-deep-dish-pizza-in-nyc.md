<p>This week, Jon Stewart <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428152945/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/14/jon_stewart_pizza_chicago.php">threw the gauntlet down</a> in the great NYC/Chicago pizza debate, brilliant eviscerating deep-dish pizza, that bready pizza-esque regional concoction that sometimes resembles pizza, but clearly is not pizza. Stewart&apos;s dismantling made waves across the internet (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428152945/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/15/chicago_mayor_escalates_daily_show.php">and provoked a response from the mayor of Chicago</a>), but it also inspired some curiosity on the part of innocent New Yorkers, who wondered if maybe they should give this deep dish thing a chance. So if you happen to be in the mood to eat seven loaves of bread, here are some excellent places around NYC to try it.</p>

<ul>
	<li>1. Pizzeria Uno, 220 East 86th Street, New York, NY 10028</li>
	<li>2. Pizzeria Uno, 9201 Fourth Ave., Brooklyn, NY 11209</li>
	<li>3. Pizzeria Uno, 37-11 35th Avenue, Long Island City, NY 11101</li>
	<li>4. Pizzeria Uno, 432 Columbus Ave., New York, NY 10024</li>
	<li>5. Pizzeria Uno, 107-16 70th Road, Forest Hills, NY 11375</li>
	<li>6. Pizzeria Uno, 39-02 Bell Blvd, Bayside, NY 11361</li>
	<li>7. Go back to Chicago you jagbag</li>
</ul>

<p>Okay okay, if you really do want to try a non-Uno place, check out <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428152945/http://www.bigalschicagopizza.com/">Big Al&apos;s Chicago Style Pizza</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428152945/http://www.giosny.com/">Gio&apos;s Pizzeria</a>&#x2014;or better yet, just toss a bunch of pizza-like ingredients into a giant tub of bread, it&apos;ll last you through winter! Just be warned: you may have to use a fork and knife to actually handle this monstrous concoction, because it&apos;s NOT REALLY PIZZA.*</p>

<p>*This doesn&apos;t mean it&apos;s <em>bad</em>&#x2014;but if you can&apos;t fold it, it&apos;s not pizza, and it&apos;ll never be pizza, and go back to Chicago, jagbag.</p>
