<p>The country is coming apart at the seams. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170205175012/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/16/chuck_e_cheese_is_now_owned_by_host.php">Corporations control</a> the institutions that people rely on. Low wage workers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170205175012/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/22/nyc_waiter_gets_chuck_e_cheese_toke.php">are getting screwed</a>. Unemployment <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170205175012/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/03/chuck_e_cheese_is_fired_higher_pric.php">is affecting</a> every facet of life. Americans cry out for a leader to step out of the shadows and right the ship of Democracy.</p>

<p>And now that hero has come forward&#x2014;and children&apos;s birthday parties will never be the same again. </p>

<p>After what we can only imagine was a years-long investigation (I mean, it definitely was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170205175012/http://www.insideedition.com/headlines/19064-adults-at-chuck-e-cheeses-pizza-parlor-erupt-into-all-out-fistfights-and-hair-pulling">at least 5 months long</a>), Inside Edition has broken open the Chuck E. Cheese scandal that has threatened to derail the nation.</p>

<p>&quot;After multiple reports of violence among adults at Chuck E. Cheese&apos;s over the last few years, it may come as a surprise that the restaurant chain serves alcohol to parents as their kids enjoy the play areas,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170205175012/http://www.insideedition.com/investigative/21413-investigation-finds-some-chuck-e-cheeses-serve-more-alcohol-than-policy-allows">they report.</a> Oh, you do <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170205175012/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/17/video_chuck_e_cheese_where_a_mom_ca.php">NOT have to tell us</a>, Inside Edition. </p>

<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170205175012if_/https://www.youtube.com/embed/k5Y1ELSABVk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>It seems that there is a two drink maximum per customer at the chain. But what Inside Edition learned is that inside every mascot lurks the twisted soul of a booze bandit trying to push hard alcohol onto unsuspecting parents: &quot;Despite the policy, an Inside Edition producer had no trouble ordering four glasses of wine at a Chuck E. Cheese&#x2019;s on New York&#x2019;s Long Island.&quot; </p>

<p>But wait, it gets <em>worse</em>. Because Inside Edition Chief Investigative Correspondent Lisa Guerrero attended a child&apos;s birthday party at a separate location about 20 miles away&#x2014;and you&apos;ll never guess what happened next.</p>

<blockquote>She was informed of the two-drink policy after ordering a couple of beers.

<p>However, a server informed Guerrero that if she provided someone else&#x2019;s ID, she would be able to order two more drinks with no problem.</p>

<p>&quot;So as long as somebody else gives you their ID, then you can still order more?&quot; Guerrero confirmed.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; the server responded.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>Just like my mama used to say, you can&apos;t spell &quot;Chuck&quot; without cuck. </p>

<p>After IE ratted out the employee, Chuck E Cheese&apos;s Entertainment told them they take their alcohol policy very seriously and, &quot;after a full investigation, we determined that employees failed to follow our alcohol service procedure. As a result, their employment has been terminated.&quot;</p>

<p>Hopefully now that one poor server has been fired from a single Chuck E. Cheese location in the NYC-region, our great nation can begin to heal itself again. </p>
