Now you can see a video (&quot;this documentary or something,&quot; according to Stiller) of that trip below, including Stiller reminiscing in the back of a car, and the surprising (and sweet) meeting with the home&apos;s owners. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140816034449/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/queens/2010/08/31/2010-08-31_seinfeld_loved_manhattan_but_had_its_share_of_queens_cameos.html">This week</a>, the News charts the on-screen and behind-the-scenes connections between the show and Queens. Kenny Kramer, the &quot;slouch&quot; who inspired Kramer on the show, said he would be &quot;thrilled&quot; to host a Queens tour similar to the <em>Seinfeld</em> tour he does in Manhattan. </p>

<p>Among the possible stops for the tour: the Queensboro Plaza subway stop, where Kramer raved about $3 gyros; Dante Caterers in East Elmhurst, where Elaine was French-kissed at her boss&apos;s sons bar mitzvah; Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, where Kramer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140816034449/http://gothamist.com/2007/07/01/ball_boy_tryout.php">worked as a ballboy at the US Open</a>; and Shea Stadium, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140816034449/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gcaq4ElAJrE">site of the infamous spitting incident </a>involving Kramer, Newman, Keith Hernandez and Roger McDowell. Off-screen, Jerry Seinfeld graduated from Queens College in 1976. </p>
