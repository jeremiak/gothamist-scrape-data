<p>Photographer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503231319/http://gothamist.com/tags/allenhenson">Allen Henson</a> created a bit of a stir last year with his &apos;boobs-about-town&apos; project&#x2014;he&apos;s had photoshoots <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503231319/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/11/nsfw_photos_get_ready_for_more_topl.php#photo-1">at restaurants</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503231319/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/14/nypd_boobs_naked_diner_poses_with_c.php">with policemen</a>, on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503231319/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/12/nsfw_woman_goes_topless_at_rooftop.php#photo-1">rooftop bars</a>, and at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503231319/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/11/nsfw_photos_topless_woman_atop_empi.php#photo-1">top of the Empire State Building</a>. That last stunt led to him being sued for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503231319/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/14/nsfw_topless_photos_elicit_11_milli.php#photo-1">$1.1 million by the ESB</a>. But that pricey lawsuit has done nothing to snuff out Henson&apos;s love for topless photography. &quot;Since the lawsuit happened, I&apos;m significantly less worried,&quot; Henson told us today after his latest shoot at Grand Central. &quot;I&apos;m a lot more informed as to what&apos;s legal and not, what&apos;s private and not. I&apos;m way more confident about doing this now. <strong>What&apos;s the worst that can happen? Be sued for $2 million?</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>Henson went out with transgender model <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503231319/http://instagram.com/sarina_thai">Sarina Thai</a> today for his first public shoot since the lawsuit came out. He took topless photos of her in front of the Flatiron Building and Grand Central, as you can see in the pictures above.</p>

<p>&quot;There were no problems at Flatiron,&quot; he said. &quot;At Grand Central, lots of people were staring and snapping pictures. People were a lot more interactive there than they have been at any of the other shoots. People were saying, &apos;Oh my god, what&apos;s going on?&apos;&quot; Parts of Grand Central are owned by the city, while others are public spaces. Henson made sure to stay in the latter areas.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, it didn&apos;t take long for cops to catch on to what was going on. &quot;Initially officers came by after they heard a nude woman was there, then left,&quot; he said. &quot;Then a larger group showed up and asked if we had a [permit]. <strong>That group of officers strongly suggested I take a hike.&quot;</strong></p>

<p>Henson said he has now taken topless photos at five locations in NYC and two or three on the West Coast; he plans to do more in NYC (though he wouldn&apos;t give any indications where), a couple &quot;internationally,&quot; and perhaps some in the Midwest. He said the ongoing project is &quot;a discourse on the invention and misuse of censorship in America,&quot; and he already has a book publisher and gallery show lined up once he finishes.</p>

<p>For now, he&apos;s grateful everything went smoothly with the latest shoot: &quot;The images came out so great today, and I&apos;m not in jail!&quot;</p>
