<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130601073217/http://gawker.com/all-the-dumb-questions-politico-writers-are-asking-cele-483780807">Gawker got their hands on</a> a copy of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130601073217/http://www.politico.com/">Politico&apos;s</a> White House Correspondents Dinner memo, left behind at a party last night. Among other things, the memo contains a request for &quot;buzzy anecdotes&quot; and a list of good SEO terms, but ya know, even Politico writers have got to put pageviews on the table, so whatever. Still, that doesn&apos;t excuse the exquisite derrrrrrr-ness of Politico&apos;s celebrity questions. Below, we&apos;re picked out our 10 favorites.</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Shaq: Do you think Chris Christie would make a good president? (He recently met the governor)</strong> But would Chris Christie make <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130601073217/http://www.autographu.com/the-night-i-was-shaqs-wingman/">a good wingman</a>?</li>
	<li><strong>Barbara Streisand: You&apos;ve been to this event before. how has it changed?</strong> YOU&apos;RE SO OLD DO YOU NEED US TO SPEAK UP WHAT WAS IT LIKE BEING ALIVE IN 1965?</li>
	<li><strong>Kevin Spacey: How would Frances [sic] Underwood behave at a dinner like this?</strong> Dangerous question&#x2014;what if he got bored of the show two-thirds through like we did?</li>
	<li><strong>Jon Bon Jovi: What was Air Force One like?</strong> It was like a plane.</li>
	<li><strong>Kerry Washington: Do you think the Obamas have a strong marriage?</strong> CONJECTURE, strike it from the record. </li>
	<li><strong>Conan O&apos;Brien: Are you nervous?</strong> This is the best question they could come up <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130601073217/http://dcist.com/2013/02/conan_obrien_to_play_washingtons_wo.php">for the host</a>? And they really needed to write that question down? </li>
	<li><strong>Ashley Judd: What if you run into Mitch McConnell? Will that be awkward?</strong> OMG, it would be soooo awk, lol. </li>
	<li><strong>Scarlett Johansson: Do you ever e-mail with President Obama anymore?</strong> Could you be more specific about your e-mail address...</li>
	<li><strong>Tracy Morgan or Fred Armisen: Would you accept the WHCD headlining gig? Why not?</strong> Hey, why are you assuming that Tracy Morgan or Fred Armisen would automatically say no? What if they say yes and the eager young Politico reporter forges onwards? </li>
	<li><strong>Nicole Kidman: How is this different than a Hollywood red carpet event?</strong> Basically what you&apos;re telling us is, you have absolutely nothing to ask her, do you?</li>
</ul>

<p>On the other hand, at least they aren&apos;t going to ask any celebrities <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130601073217/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/28/game_of_thrones.php#photo-1">what their favorite subway line is.</a></p>
