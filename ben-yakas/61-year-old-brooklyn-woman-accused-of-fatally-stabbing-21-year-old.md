<p>A 61-year-old woman has been arrested and accused of fatally stabbing a 21-year-old man in a Brooklyn apartment. According to cops, Joan John stabbed Akeem Burrows in the stomach at 4:05 a.m. yesterday in an apartment on Eastern Parkway in Crown Heights. Police found Burrows laying on his back inside the building&apos;s stairwell between the first and second floors, unconscious and unresponsive. </p>

<p>Burrows was ultimately pronounced dead at the scene. John, who lives a few blocks away on Lincoln Place, was arrested and charged with murder and criminal possession of a weapon. It&apos;s unclear how the two knew each other or what they argument had been about, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604151021/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/gal_kills_guy_cops_vqEIjYyRDQFFcql1YmD4HI">according to the Post</a>, John claims she acted in self-defense. </p>
