</div></div>					<p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150101231002/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/14/have_you_fallen_for_a_hipster_trap.php">&quot;hipster traps&quot;</a> started popping up all over Brooklyn, causing equal amounts of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150101231002/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/15/hipster_trap_creators_have_a_histor.php#photo-1">delight</a>, confusion, and lust for a free pack of American Spirits. Last night, we were witness to the unveiling of the next in a line of &quot;urban traps&quot; from artists <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150101231002/http://www.jeffgreenspan.com/">Jeff Greenspan</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150101231002/http://www.hunterfine.com/">Hunter Fine</a>: The &quot;bridge and tunnel traps.&quot; Obviously.  </p>

<p>A cardboard &quot;bridge and tunnel trap&quot; was stationed in front of bar Mason &amp; Dixon on the corner of Essex and Rivington, <strong>filled with tanner, path tickets, LIRR schedules, a gold chain, cologne and bronzer</strong>. It was surprising how many people immediately recognized the traps from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150101231002/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/15/hipster_trap_creators_have_a_histor.php">its hipster siblings</a>, and were overheard calling these ones the &quot;Jersey Shore traps.&quot; A man from Australia told Greenspan and Hunter at one point, &quot;You know you&apos;ve blown up on the internet.&quot; Greenspan and Hunter were more shocked that, except for one giddy man, nobody tried to take anything from the trap.</p>

<p>The artists, whose day jobs are in advertising, explained to us that they were interested in both the disruptive and communicative nature of the project, as well as &quot;the cartoon elements encroaching on the real world,&quot; said Greenspan, who was also responsible for the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150101231002/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/19/tourists_now_have_their_own_sidewal.php">tourist sidewalk lane</a> last year. Overall, they seemed delighted by the response the pieces were generating, though they did worry about how the internet would take the latest project: &quot;Is this the point when people say I&apos;m hitting a sophomore slump,&quot; Greenspan wondered. </p>

<p>The most affirming moment of the night came when a disheveled looking middle aged man came over to them, asking if the traps were operational. When they were cagey about revealing too many details, the man asked again, flashing his badge, revealing himself to be an undercover cop. Satisfied that they weren&apos;t dangerous, he gave his feedback on the piece: <strong>&quot;It&apos;s funny as fuck.&quot;</strong></p>
