The 33-year-old man made his way onto the roof of the three-story Bushwick building, then leaped onto the adjacent tree, but the branch broke and he fell to the ground. <p></p>

<p>Police say they believe the man was trying to use the tree to break into an apartment in the Chauncey St. building early yesterday morning but the tree branch couldn&apos;t support his weight. Last year, a man fell to his death after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412130554/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/09/how_not_to_break_into_you_girlfrien.php">tying his shoe laces and his belt</a> together in order to climb into a girlfriend&apos;s apartment. </p>
