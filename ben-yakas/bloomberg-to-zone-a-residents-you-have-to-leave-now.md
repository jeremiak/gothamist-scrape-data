<p>Mayor Bloomberg addressed the public this morning on the city&apos;s preparedness for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425003910/http://gothamist.com/tags/hurricaneirene">Hurricane Irene</a>, which is due to hit us early Sunday morning. He warned residents that they must evacuate Zone A immediately: &quot;Starting at noon today, mass transit is not going to be available if you have to leave. <strong>You have to start right now.</strong>  We&apos;ve heard that lots of people are leaving and that&apos;s great.&quot;</p>

<p>Bloomberg spoke while in a Zone A area&#x2014;Coney Island&#x2014;explaining that the city is still expecting a Category 1 hurricane, with winds between 55-75 MPH, and called it a &quot;great danger&quot; to the city, and in particular, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425003910/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/27/nyregion/new-york-city-begins-evacuations-before-hurricane.html?_r=1&amp;hp">the 370,000 NYers in the low lying areas</a>. &quot;It&apos;s a very serious thing from what we can tell now...if the storm can go east and get away from us, nothing would make us happier. We can&apos;t prepare for best case, so we have to prepare for the worst case,&quot; he said. </p>

<p>Bloomberg also spoke about Zone B, and called the Rockaways &quot;a special case,&quot; because if bridges get closed, there&apos;s no way to leave. He said there were 91 emergency shelters for 70,000 people (even though &quot;we don&apos;t have beds for 70,000 people&quot;), and he said there were ten teams of firefighters in each borough using school buses to help with the evacuation. However, he advised that no one should wait for a bus to evacuate: &quot;DO THAT RIGHT NOW,&quot; he emphasized. Buildings are also turning off their elevators so people don&apos;t get stuck in them.  </p>

<p>He also addressed the potential damage in lower Manhattan: &quot;It&apos;s conceivable there&apos;s a lot of water in downtown Manhattan...Let&apos;s stop thinking this is something we can play with. <strong>Staying behind is dangerous. Staying behind is foolish</strong>.&quot; He added that Con Ed may have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425003910/http://twitter.com/#!/NYCMayorsOffice/status/107447867509186560">to turn off the grid in parts of the city</a>, because of the dangers: when salt water hits live power cables creates extremely hazardous conditions and may severely damage the grid&apos;s infrastructure. </p>

<p>He ended his update with another warning to evacuate, and not underestimate the storm: &quot;In conclusion, you have to leave and start right now. Do not delay.  This is just the beginning, this a serious storm, no matter how much the storm weakens. <strong>This is not a joke. Your life could be in danger. &quot;</strong></p>
