<p>There have been quite a lot of offensive <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508223242/http://gothamist.com/tags/halloween">Halloween costumes</a> this year, from the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508223242/http://gawker.com/meet-the-morons-behind-the-racist-trayvon-halloween-cos-1453110925">Trayvon Martin/George Zimmerman trio</a> to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508223242/http://www.buzzfeed.com/rachelzarrell/what-happens-when-you-dress-as-a-boston-marathon-victim">Boston marathon bombing victim</a> to the child forced to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508223242/http://www.whsv.com/news/headlines/Mother-Responds-to-Controversy-After-Son-Dresses-as-Klansman-for-Halloween--230306501.html">dress up as a KKK member because of family tradition.</a> But for a brief moment it looked like we were going to make it through the holiday without any tasteless 9/11 costumes. Cue a pair of British women who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508223242/http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/5245724/chester-university-students-win-fancy-dress-contest-in-twin-towers-costume.html">dressed up as burning Twin Towers</a> for a costume contest. Which they won.</p>

<p>Amber Langford and Annie Collinge, both 19-year-old students at the University of Chester,<br>
donned costumes labeled &#x201C;North Tower&#x201D; and &#x201C;South Tower,&#x201D; and wore head pieces that looked like smoke clouds (topped by American flags). They won the &#x201C;best dressed&#x201D; award, and  &#xA3;150, in a costume contest at Rosie&#x2019;s nightclub in Chester. Then they landed on the front page of the Sun paper with the headline, &quot;Towering Stupidity.&quot;</p>

<p>The teens have since apologized in a hilariously tone-deaf fashion: &quot;We never meant to be offensive, but we apologize if any offense was caused. <strong>The idea was to depict a modern-day horror that happened in our lifetime and was not intended as a joke.&quot;</strong></p>

<p>The club, Rosie&apos;s, has deleted its social media presence and released its own statement:  &quot;We are extremely concerned that an award of vouchers was made to two young women who were dressed in a distasteful and offensive manner. There was a serious error of judgement made on the evening by a contracted DJ to award such a prize and we apologize to anybody who may have been upset or offended by this. A full investigation by the company is taking place.&quot;</p>

<p>This isn&apos;t the first time someone has donned an offensive 9/11-related outfit for fun: earlier this year, Israeli parents decided to &quot;playfully&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508223242/http://www.shalomlife.com/culture/18828/kids-purim-costume-idea-the-burning-twin-towers-photo/">dress up their seven-year-old twins as the towers.</a> There were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508223242/http://www.buzzfeed.com/jpmoore/the-most-offensive-halloween-costumes-of-2011">plenty others</a> in years past <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508223242/http://www.wtfcostumes.com/world_trade_center_costume.php">as well.</a></p>

<p>Incredibly, one of the British teen&apos;s fathers is a pilot who was flying into NYC on 9/11: &quot;I didn&apos;t know anything about it, but I&apos;m not happy about it,&quot; Martin Langford <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508223242/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/10429642/Anger-after-women-in-911-Twin-Towers-fancy-dress-win-Halloween-costume-contest.html">told the Telegraph</a>. &quot;She knows I&apos;m a pilot and that&apos;s not cool at all. We will be having a little chat, I think.&quot;</p>
