<p>Kristen Wiig&apos;s return to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171020192928/http://gothamist.com/tags/snl"><em>Saturday Night Live</em></a> this weekend may have been slightly overshadowed by the ongoing hostility between <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171020192928/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/20/video_snls_president-elect_trump_fr.php#photo-1">Alec Baldwin and Donald Trump</a>, but she was reliably elastic and hilarious in various sketches on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171020192928/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/20/kristen_wiig_crazy_cat_lady.php#photo-1">cat ladies, CNN election coverage, and the Thanksgiving Day Parade.</a> And there was plenty of leftover material, including at least two cut-for-time sketches that were put online today.</p>

<p>First up: Wiig and the cast channel the spirit of past holiday sketches (most memorably, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171020192928/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/27/videos_saturday_night_live_injects.php#photo-13">Edward Norton&apos;s &quot;Halloween Candy&quot;</a>) for a surreal tour of the Thanksgiving meal. &quot;Do you like peas?&quot; Wiig asks. &quot;Not me. So these are just birth control pills painted green. Donald Trump can&apos;t take away what he can&apos;t find.&quot; Come for the weird atmosphere, stay for Bobby Moynihan&apos;s scene-stealing turn as Russell.</p>

<p>Next: the goddesses of creation (Wiig, Kate McKinnon, Vanessa Bayer) show off their latest animals and creations, including a little nugget of slime that lives inside a coin purse. </p>
