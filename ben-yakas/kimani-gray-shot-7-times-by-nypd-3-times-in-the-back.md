<p>The city&apos;s medical examiner&apos;s officer has announced that the 16-year-old fatally shot by cops in Brooklyn over the weekend was hit with seven bullets, including three that struck him in the back. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160209050134/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/11/dozens_riot_over_nypds_fatal_shooti.php">Various</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160209050134/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/12/video_brooklyn_protesters_ransack_r.php">protests</a> erupted in Brooklyn this week following the fatal shooting of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160209050134/http://gothamist.com/tags/kimanigray">Kimani Gray</a> on Saturday in East Flatbush. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160209050134/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/14/nyregion/teenager-killed-by-new-york-police-was-shot-7-times.html?_r=0">The NY Times has</a> all the details on the bullets:</p>

<blockquote>One bullet entered his left shoulder in the rear, exiting in the front; two other bullets struck the back of his thighs, one in the left thigh and one in the right. Two bullets struck from the front, hitting his right thigh; one bullet entered his left side, striking his lower rib cage; and the last bullet hit his left lower forearm.</blockquote>

<p>It&apos;s not clear which bullet was the fatal shot, nor whether Gray was hit in the back initially by officers or if he was hit in the back after turning away from them. Police said that Gray had pointed a gun at them that night: &quot;[He] adjusted his waistband and continued to act in a suspicious manner. The officers exited their unmarked auto and attempted to engage the suspect, who turned on them, and pointed a .38 caliber revolver at the officers. Both officers fired at the suspect, striking him about the body.&quot;</p>

<p>Police Commissioner Ray Kelly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160209050134/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/12/brooklyn_violence_during_protest_bl.php">has previously emphasized</a>, &quot;We have three [civilian] witnesses, two of which said that one of the officers shouted &apos;Don&apos;t move&apos; and &apos;Freeze.&apos; Two witnesses also said they heard officers say, &apos;What do you have in your hands?&apos;&quot; But at least one witness has come forward now to say that cops did not seem justified in the shooting. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160209050134/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/13/witness_claims_kimani_gray_was_not.php">Tishana King said that she witnessed</a> the confrontation from her third-story window in a neighboring building, and she tells the tabloid, &quot;I&#x2019;m certain he didn&#x2019;t have anything in his hands.&quot;</p>
