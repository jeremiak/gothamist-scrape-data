<p>A woman was robbed and sexually assaulted by two men who she had asked for directions in Chinatown last week. According to police, the 38-year-old woman approached the two men to ask for help around 9:30 p.m. on April 15th near Chrystie Street and Grand Street. One suspect (see sketch above) gave her directions and started walking with her; the second suspect followed them, grabbed the woman from behind and pinned her against the wall. </p>

<p>The first suspect punched her about the ribs and thigh; then he sexually abused her and stole her property before running off.
