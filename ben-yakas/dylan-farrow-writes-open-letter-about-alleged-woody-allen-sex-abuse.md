<p>Thanks to a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508173024/http://www.vanityfair.com/online/daily/2013/10/mia-farrow-children-family-scandal">prominent Vanity Fair piece</a>, the Golden Globes, and subsequent tweets by Mia and Ronan Farrow, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508173024/http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/01/13/what-you-should-know-about-woody-allen-s-feud-with-mia-and-ronan-farrow.html">debate</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508173024/http://gawker.com/what-you-should-know-about-the-abuse-allegations-agains-1500274468">has raged</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508173024/http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/culturebox/2014/01/did_woody_allen_molest_his_adopted_daughter_22_years_ago_reviewing_the_evidence.html">across the internet</a> (including <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508173024/http://www.theonion.com/articles/boy-ive-really-put-you-in-a-tough-spot-havent-i,34949/?ref=auto">this brilliant Onion piece</a>) about the allegations that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508173024/http://gothamist.com/tags/woodyallen">Woody Allen</a> sexually abused Dylan (Malone) Farrow when she was seven-years-old. And today, Farrow has written about it for the first time <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508173024/http://kristof.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/02/01/an-open-letter-from-dylan-farrow/">in a column for the NY Times</a>. &quot;That he got away with what he did to me haunted me as I grew up,&quot; she writes. &quot;Woody Allen is a living testament to the way our society fails the survivors of sexual assault and abuse.&quot;</p>

<p>In the first graf, Farrow describes the alleged encounter between her and her adoptive father:</p>

<blockquote>What&apos;s your favorite Woody Allen movie? Before you answer, you should know: when I was seven years old, Woody Allen took me by the hand and led me into a dim, closet-like attic on the second floor of our house. He told me to lay on my stomach and play with my brother&#x2019;s electric train set. Then he sexually assaulted me. He talked to me while he did it, whispering that I was a good girl, that this was our secret, promising that we&#x2019;d go to Paris and I&#x2019;d be a star in his movies. I remember staring at that toy train, focusing on it as it traveled in its circle around the attic. To this day, I find it difficult to look at toy trains.</blockquote>

<p>The 28-year-old Farrow, who previously spoke to Vanity Fair about the allegations in the fall, describes being happily married now, with support from her mother, siblings, and other survivors of sexual abuse. Then she asks why Hollywood keeps defending and working with him:</p>

<blockquote>But others are still scared, vulnerable, and struggling for the courage to tell the truth. The message that Hollywood sends matters for them.

<p>What if it had been your child, Cate Blanchett? Louis CK? Alec Baldwin? What if it had been you, Emma Stone? Or you, Scarlett Johansson? You knew me when I was a little girl, Diane Keaton. Have you forgotten me?</p>

<p>Woody Allen is a living testament to the way our society fails the survivors of sexual assault and abuse.</p>

<p>So imagine your seven-year-old daughter being led into an attic by Woody Allen. Imagine she spends a lifetime stricken with nausea at the mention of his name. Imagine a world that celebrates her tormenter.</p>

<p>Are you imagining that? Now, what&#x2019;s your favorite Woody Allen movie?</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>Farrow&apos;s column comes a few days after director Robert Weide, who made <em>Woody Allen: A Documentary,</em> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508173024/http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/01/27/the-woody-allen-allegations-not-so-fast.html">wrote his own long piece on the controversy</a>, debunking several mistaken pieces of information spreading around the internet. It&apos;s worth a read, even if you aren&apos;t convinced by his argument whatsoever.</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508173024/http://kristof.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/02/01/an-open-letter-from-dylan-farrow/">read Farrow&apos;s whole piece here.</a> </p>
