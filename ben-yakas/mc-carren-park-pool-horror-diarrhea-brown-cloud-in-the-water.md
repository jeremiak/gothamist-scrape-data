<p>Yesterday, newly renovated fight club/public toilet <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429123130/http://gothamist.com/tags/mccarrenparkpool">McCarren Park Pool</a> was abruptly closed around 1:30 p.m. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429123130/http://gothamist.com/2012/08/04/mccarren_park_pool_closed_due_to_un.php">due to mysterious &quot;unsanitary conditions.&quot;</a> A lifeguard had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429123130/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/15/mccarren_park_pool_lifeguard.php">previously noted</a> that the pool closes for five minutes to clean up poop, and 25 minutes to clean up throw-up. So what could cause the pool to shutdown for almost 24 hours? DIARRHEA.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429123130/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2012/08/04/mccarren-pool-closed-over-loose-stool/">CBS was told</a> it was a &quot;loose stool,&quot; and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429123130/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/new-brooklyn-floaties-stool-pool-article-1.1129347">Daily News referred to it</a> as &quot;a suspicious brown cloud in the water.&quot; They also noted that the pool was packed to capacity when officials and swimmers noticed the &quot;the slowly spreading stain.&quot; &#x201C;It was spotted and confirmed and we took the precautions right away,&#x201D; Parks Department Phil Abramson confirmed to them, adding in a huge understatement, &#x201C;There are health concerns with this kind of thing.&#x201D; </p>

<p>He <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429123130/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/crappy_day_at_mccarren_pool_RbRYZ8S4lECHkuq03e8GXM?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Brooklyn">told the Post</a> that park workers had to disinfect the pool by raising its chlorine levels for 24 hours, explaining the long closure. It&apos;s expected to re-open around 1:30 p.m. today, for anyone who really needs to cool down after having a crappy weekend, or anyone who isn&apos;t traumatized by that scene from <em>American Pie</em>:</p>
