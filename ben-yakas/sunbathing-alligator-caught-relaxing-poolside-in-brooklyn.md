<p>Now that Mayor de Blasio has announced his intentions <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140603053406/http://gothamist.com/2014/05/28/sorry_rudy_de_blasio_may_bring_back.php">to overturn the city&apos;s ban on ferrets</a>, it&apos;s open season on exotic animals in NYC: pet lovers are beseeching the mayor to allow people <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140603053406/http://nypost.com/2014/05/30/exotic-animal-lovers-want-more-species-legalized-as-pets-in-nyc/">to legally own</a> everything from bats to hedgehogs to bearded dragons. But one critter that won&apos;t be getting any love anytime soon? Alligators&#x2014;especially alligators who have the temerity to sunbathe in Brooklyn.</p>

<p>Dino, a three-foot-long and three-year-old <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140603053406/http://gothamist.com/tags/alligator">alligator</a>, was spotted by a neighbor &quot;sunbathing next to a small wading pool&quot; in a Bensonhurst backyard around 4:30 p.m. Tuesday. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140603053406/http://nypost.com/2014/05/29/alligator-found-sunbathing-by-pool-in-brooklyn/">The Post reports that</a> cops showed up to take the animal away from its owner, 45-year-old Victor Alexandria. </p>

<p>How exactly an alligator &quot;sunbathes&quot; is unclear.</p>

<p>&quot;What&apos;s the big deal about a gator?&quot; Alexandria asked. &quot;It&apos;s a reptile, and it doesn&#x2019;t do any bodily harm to anybody as long as you treat it the right way. I give it goldfish about twice a week. The alligator has never bitten me.&quot; </p>

<p>Alexandria normally would have received a summons for keeping a wild animal, but there was a warrant for his arrest (for riding his bike on the sidewalk), and he was arrested.  He was ultimately charged with disorderly conduct for creating a hazardous condition and a misdemeanor for domesticating the wild animal.</p>

<p>At least the city&apos;s population of goldfish will rest a little easier tonight.</p>
