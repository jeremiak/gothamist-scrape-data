<p>You might think we&apos;re jaded enough to know what &quot;cat fight&quot; means in a subject line when it hits our inbox&#x2014;and yet, we were mighty relieved that this video was just of two women going at it on the 1 train at 3 a.m. Saturday morning, and not two kitties. While it&apos;s not quite as epic as some <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717092756/http://gothamist.com/tags/subwayfight">past subway brawls</a> (can anything compare to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717092756/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/18/video_subway_spaghetti_spat_sparks.php">a spaghetti spat</a>?), this seems as good a time as any for a plea for sanity: please don&apos;t dare anyone to get in your face. They may very well punch you in said face (after they put down their purse, of course).</p>
