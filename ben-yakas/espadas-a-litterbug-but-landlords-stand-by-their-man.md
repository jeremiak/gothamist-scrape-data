title: Espada's a Litterbug, But Landlords Stand By Their Man

He&apos;s so extremely talented at it, it should come as no shock that he has racked up the most violations for his political litter during this campaign.<p></p>

<p>As of last Friday, Espada has received 411 summonses for putting up illegal campaign posters on city property during this election cycle, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429160146/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/bronx/pedro_poster_boy_of_littering_b7QTuYCb4ZL3cPYuPxL2jL?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">according to the Post</a>. He faces a potential $30,825 fine, though it&apos;s probably not even close the top of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429160146/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/05/criminal_charges_against_sen_pedro.php">list of things</a> he should be concerned about. And it&apos;s not like the threat of fines are slowing down his anti-paper routine either: just today, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429160146/http://www.bronxnewsnetwork.org/2010/09/espada-campaign-ad-gustavo-rivera-has.html">Bronx News Network</a> found a new campaign pamphlet, which mostly mocks opponent Gustavo Rivera, under the windshield (picture above).</p>

<p>But Espada still has one major ally sticking by his side: the Rent Stabilization Association, which represents large residential-building owners. Espada has worked to block or change numerous rent-regulation bills that would hurt landlords pockets. &quot;Pedro is a much more moderate-conservative Democrat, and if he hadn&apos;t been there I think it&apos;s clear that there would have been more bad legislation enacted,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429160146/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704362404575480190749373882.html?mod=WSJ_hpp_sections_newyork">said</a> Joseph Strasburg, president of the Rent Stabilization Association. Despite the RSA&apos;s endorsement, Strasburg sounded a bit like a battered wife: &quot;<strong>He may be radioactive in the PR level, but he is who he is, and he&apos;s been a guy who supports you more often than anyone else does</strong>.&quot;</p>
