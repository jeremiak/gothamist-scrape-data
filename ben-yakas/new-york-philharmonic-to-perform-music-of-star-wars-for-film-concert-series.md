<p>Every year, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170427220216/http://gothamist.com/tags/starwars"><em>Star Wars</em></a> fans are treated to various Wookie-related promotional stunts in honor of May 4th, better known to Rebel scum as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170427220216/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_Day">&quot;Star Wars Day.&quot;</a> (<em>May the Fourth be with you,</em> get it?) That has typically included things like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170427220216/http://gothamist.com/2015/05/04/jawas_nyc_may_the_4th.php">Jawa sightings</a> near Madison Square Park or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170427220216/http://gothamist.com/2016/05/04/hamilton_celebrates_may_the_fourth.php"><em>Hamilton</em> homages</a>, but the NY Philharmonic have something special in mind for fans this year: the first chance to buy tickets to their live performances of the <em>Star Wars</em>: Film Concert Series.</p>

The concerts will be led by acclaimed conductor <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170427220216/http://www.davidlouisnewman.com/about/">David Newman</a>. All the screenings will take place between September 15th and October 7th&#x2014;you can see <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170427220216/https://nyphil.org/starwars">ticketing info here.</a></p>

<p>Tickets will go on sale to the public at noon on May 4th, but fans who come to the David Geffen Hall Box Office at 9:30 a.m. that day can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170427220216/https://nyphil.org/about-us/general-information/newsroom/press-releases/press-release?item=1617/star-wars-may-4-event-final&amp;clearnewsroomcache=y">get early access</a>: </p>
