<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150521210451/http://davidxia.com/easilyamused/2010/08/12/citibanks-advice-to-women-grow-a-pair/">blogger David Xia</a>, a friend of his grabbed this absolutely ridiculous card from the Citibank HR offices after interviewing there. People have been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150521210451/http://dealbreaker.com/2010/09/citi-advocates-that-female-employees-do-not-sit-with-their-legs-crossed-but-rather-spread-eagle-with-their-balls-hanging-out/">passing it</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150521210451/http://bigthink.com/ideas/23966">around</a> the <strike>classroom</strike> internet today, with a mixture of rage, laughter and disbelief. Because of some of the spelling errors, some think it may be a hoax, although the book it is cited from, and its author <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150521210451/http://bigthink.com/ideas/23966">Dr. Lois P. Frankel</a>, are very real (also: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150521210451/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSPtSEIlp8A">Frankel is Einhorn</a>!). </p>

<p>If it is true, then it lends more credence to the claims of sexy banker <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150521210451/http://gothamist.com/tags/debbielorenzana">Debrahlee Lorenzana</a>, who said she was fired from Citigroup for being too sexy. Although maybe next time, instead of complaining about being fired, she&apos;ll follow rule #6, and move directly into <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150521210451/http://gothamist.com/2010/06/09/sexy_banker_had_two_boob_jobs.php">problem-solving mode</a>.</p>
