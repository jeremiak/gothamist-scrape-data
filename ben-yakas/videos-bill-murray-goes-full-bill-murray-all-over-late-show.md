<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509173230/http://gothamist.com/tags/billmurray">Bill Murray</a> has been Bill Murraying it up in all sorts of ways in 2014, with PBR pants, intense karaoke sessions and joyous Reddit threads. He also popped up on <em>Late Show With David Letterman</em> last night to check off a couple things from his bucket list: &quot;I&apos;m probably going to die, but not anytime soon.&quot; Wild Bill Murrays couldn&apos;t drag us away.</p>

<p>And then he stuck around to promote <em>Grand Budapest Hotel</em>, even though he doesn&apos;t know (WINK WINK) what the movie is about.</p>

<p>But wait! There&apos;s more! After listing all the reasons Martha Stewart is a catch (&quot;She&apos;s cute, she&apos;s an ex-con, she can make a deviled egg...&quot;), Murray revealed that meeting Lady Gaga is also on his bucket list. Then they all took a selfie together.</p>

<p>Then Gaga invited Letterman, Murray, and everyone in the audience to a private two-song set at Roseland Ballroom across the street. See them gallop through the streets like wild steeds.</p>

<p>Once there, Gaga performed &quot;G.U.Y.&quot; and &quot;Dope,&quot; and Murray donned a baseball cap. It&apos;s unclear at press time whether &quot;wear an ill-fitting baseball cap&quot; was indeed on his bucket list. </p>
