<p>A woman was struck by a train in lower Manhattan this afternoon. According to FDNY, the woman was struck by a 6 train at the Astor Place station around 4 p.m. Saturday. Initial reports indicate she may have jumped in front of the train as it pulled into the station, something which a few witnesses tweeted about.</p>
