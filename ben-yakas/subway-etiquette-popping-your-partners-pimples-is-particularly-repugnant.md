title: Subway Etiquette: Popping Your Partner's Pimples Is Particularly Repugnant

<p>Whatever you do in the comfort and Google-blessed privacy of your own home is between you and your webmaster&#x2014;the pimple popping community is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429064858/http://www.popthatzit.com/">very vibrant online</a>, very serious <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429064858/https://www.google.com/search?q=popping+pimples&amp;oq=popping+pimples&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.1551j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;espv=210&amp;es_sm=91&amp;ie=UTF-8">about their art,</a> and we&apos;re not here to judge people who are into that. HAVING SAID THAT, the moment you decide to pop your lover&apos;s pimples in a public space is the moment you become an enemy of all that is good and right in this world.</p>

<p>Tipster Farah Visslailli encountered two such enemies while riding the N train around 8:30 p.m. Wednesday from Union Square to Brooklyn: &quot;[I] had the pleasure of staring at this loving couple for the ENTIRE ride,&quot; she told us. &quot;I&apos;ve seen a lot of nasty stuff on the subway, but this is a first. She was going to town, popping his face/neck pimples for almost the whole ride. It wasn&apos;t just one-sided though, he reciprocated by going after a few on her forehead. How nice.&quot;</p>

<p>Visslailli was clearly traumatized by her experience, because her sarcastic &quot;nice&quot; is so far from cutting it in this situation. This is such a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429064858/http://gothamist.com/tags/subwayetiquette">serious violation of public decency</a>, we don&apos;t know where to begin. We&apos;ve encountered every form of subway etiquette violations imaginable, we&apos;ve put together lists of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429064858/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/15/etiquette_week_subway.php#photo-1">worst sins you could commit</a>, and this might be the worst we&apos;ve encountered, the lowest form of social grooming.</p>

<p>We can only imagine the stories that these people tell themselves to sleep at night. It&apos;s like Frank Sobotka once said: &quot;I knew I was wrong. But in my head, I thought I was wrong for the right reasons, you know?&quot; But there are different kinds of wrong. </p>

<p>At least we can all take comfort in the fact that this couple&apos;s incredibly unhygienic defiance of the social contract could be their own undoing&#x2014;nothing causes infections like dirty fingers probing open wounds.</p>
