<p>We&apos;re sure there&apos;s a perfectly reasonable explanation as to why the young woman in the photo above has encased her head in a glass box. Perhaps this was the first day of magic school, and she had to wear the box as part of a hazing ritual. Maybe it&apos;s a commentary on a society which prioritizes physical beauty over glass boxes. Or a homage to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150328003830/http://www.superiorpics.com/thomas_kretschmann/movie-picture/2008_hellboy_2_the_golden_army_034_big.html">Johann Kraus</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150328003830/http://areyakiddinme.com/lady-gaga-kicks-off-mtv-vmas-with-bizarre-head-in-box-intense-facial/">Lady Gaga</a>, Maru and other box-obsessed celebrities. It could be she has been cursed by a wicked witch, and the only way to snap the spell is to get people to pay attention to her. Or maybe she is just the kind of person who likes thinking inside the box. </p>
