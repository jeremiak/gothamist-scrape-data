<p>Last August, cab driver Mohammed Himon struck a cyclist and jumped the curb outside Rockefeller Center, hitting a British tourist on the sidewalk and severing her leg. Despite the fact that Himon, 24, admitted to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508164431/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/24/cabbie_who_maimed_tourist_says_acci.php">hitting a cyclist in anger</a> before striking Green, the Manhattan DA&apos;s office <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508164431/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/14/da_wont_charge_cabbie_who_maimed_to.php">declined to prosecute him</a>. And now, Himon is back on the road behind the wheel of a cab.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508164431/http://nypost.com/2014/04/20/cabby-who-sheared-off-womans-leg-is-back-behind-a-taxis-wheel/">The Post discovered</a> that Himon has been driving a yellow cab out of 28th Street Management since February 14th. &quot;He has been driving regularly, uneventfully&#x2014;thank God &#x2014; and just doing what he has to do,&quot; Himon&#x2019;s lawyer, Cynthia Fisher, told them. She added that he has taken another defensive-driving course since the incident.</p>

<p>Himon, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508164431/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/22/cabbie_who_maimed_tourist_blames_cy.php">who blamed</a> cyclist Kenneth Olivo for distracting him and causing the incident, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508164431/http://nypost.com/2013/08/22/crash-cabby-admits-hes-a-bad-driver-and-shouldnt-even-be-driving-a-cab/">said at the time</a> that he didn&apos;t want to drive a taxi anymore after everything that had happened: &quot;I need a more suitable job. There&#x2019;s too much stress when you&#x2019;re driving in the city,&quot; Himon said. </p>

<p>His license was only <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508164431/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/02/cabbie_who_maimed_tourist_gets_his.php">suspended for one month</a>, and he went back to driving a cab in September, but was fired quickly. &quot;I asked if he had any accidents. He said no. He drove here two days,&quot; a manager &#xAD;at Arthur Cab in Queens told the Post. &quot;The TLC called and asked if he was working for us, and then they told me.&quot; Apparently Himon didn&apos;t drive a cab again until this year.</p>

<p>His lawyer said he&apos;s still figuring out what he wants to do, and whether he wants to pursue medicine: &quot;He brought his family over here. Right now he&#x2019;s trying to maintain them until he figures out what his next move is going to be,&quot; Fisher said. &quot;I don&#x2019;t think he&#x2019;s really made up his mind yet.&quot;</p>

<p>Green, who is living in Leicester, has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508164431/http://gothamist.com/2013/12/11/tourist_maimed_by_cabbie_sues_city.php">sued the city for $27.5 million</a>, alleging that the cabbie&apos;s license should have been suspended before the incident due to his many violations.</p>
