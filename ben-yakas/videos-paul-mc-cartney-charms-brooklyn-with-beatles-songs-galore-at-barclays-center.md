<p>Paul McCartney has been carrying some serious weight for a long time now: as the last living member of The Beatles not named Ringo, he has become The Beatles ambassador to the universe. He&apos;s expected to travel the world every few years providing millions of people with the chance to ob-la-di ob-la-da for a couple of hours to their hearts&apos; content. It&apos;s a role he&apos;s embraced since the late 1980&apos;s, and he very clearly loves it. Which is why he paused several times between songs last night at Barclays Center to soak in the adoration of the crowd, or recall a story of people telling him The Beatles&apos; music had changed their lives. &quot;At an event this cool,&quot; he said early on in the evening, &quot;I just want to take a moment to myself to drink it all in.&quot;</p>

<p>And while no one could argue that he hasn&apos;t earned the right to that adoration, McCartney doesn&apos;t skimp on presentation or content in his latest set. McCartney and his four completely adequate younger bandmates (drummer Abe Laboriel, Jr. deserves a special shout out for handling the toughest harmonies while keeping time) played a 38-song set (including 26 Beatles songs!) over 2 &amp; 1/2 generous hours to the delight of boogying moms and hollering dads. McCartney&apos;s voice is a shadow of the crisp, melodic instrument it once was, but he and the group make up for it with the reverential treatment of songs like &quot;We Can Work It Out&quot; and &quot;Let It Be.&quot; Despite the fact that McCartney clearly relishes rocking out with the younger lads (&quot;Helter Skelter&quot; and &quot;Back In The USSR&quot; were both particularly raunchy), he actually sounded his best on the quieter songs like &quot;And I Love Her&quot; and &quot;Here Today.&quot; </p>

<p>There were anecdotes about Jimi Hendrix and Eric Clapton, there was an amazing fireworks and flames display during &quot;Live And Let Die,&quot; there were lots of dedications and tributes to friends and family long gone: &quot;Maybe I&apos;m Amazed&quot; to Linda McCartney, &quot;Here Today&quot; to John Lennon, a ukulele take of &quot;Something&quot; to George Harrison, &quot;My Valentine&quot; to wife Nancy Shevell, and &quot;Another Day&quot; to producer Phil Ramone. </p>

<p>The best part of these recent McCartney tours is his willingness to dive into his unbelievably deep back catalogue and pull out some rarities and never-played-live classics. On the current &quot;Out There&quot; setlist, the premieres have included jubilant set opener &quot;Eight Days A Week,&quot; the children&apos;s ditty &quot;All Together Now,&quot; the horny &quot;Lovely Rita,&quot; the nostalgic &quot;Your Mother Should Know,&quot; and an unexpected take on Lennon&apos;s somewhat forgotten &quot;Being For The Benefit Of Mr. Kite!&quot; </p>

<p>Of the non-Beatles tunes, &quot;Listen To What The Man Said&quot; revealed itself as a herky jerky proto-New Wave song when stripped of its schmaltzy production; it&apos;s also ridiculously catchy, despite the cheesy synth sax-like lead instrument. But the best part of the Wings portion of the show was being reminded that the songs from <em>Band On The Run</em> are just as strong as anything he did with The Beatles&#x2014;the title track, &quot;Nineteen Hundred And Eighty Five,&quot; &quot;Mrs. Vanderbilt&quot; and &quot;Let Me Roll It&quot; were some of the strongest performances of the night. </p>

<p>It&apos;s hard to imagine any Beatles fan not being extremely satisfied coming out of the show&#x2014;McCartney would never fuck up &quot;Get Back,&quot; &quot;Day Tripper,&quot; &quot;Blackbird,&quot; &quot;All My Loving,&quot; or the closing <em>Abbey Road</em> medley. Who knows how many hundreds of times he&apos;s played &quot;Hey Jude&quot; over the years&#x2014;when it gets to the extended outro, nothing matters to him but those &apos;na na na&apos;s.&apos; </p>
