<p>We just received a report of a jumper at the top of 30 Rockefeller Place. The FDNY confirmed to us that a male was on the ledge of a 70th floor of the building, on the observation desk behind a 10 foot piece of glass. FDNY are currently on the scene clearing all people from the area, the observation decks have been closed, and we&apos;ll update this post when we hear new information. <strong>[Updates below]</strong></p>

<p><strong>Update 4:15 p.m.</strong>: Below, check out a grainy pic of the scene currently. You can see the possible jumper on the right side of the screen. That photo comes from a closed circuit TV at NBC. </p>

<p><strong>Update 4:30 p.m.</strong>: FDNY informed us that the situation is still ongoing, while Twitter users are noting that a large crowd is gathering to observe the scene: &quot;someone&apos;s trying to jump off the rockefeller center observation deck, and tourists are taking pictures like it&apos;s the highlight of their trip,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150420102400/http://twitter.com/#!/athanasiaaa/status/101388777578172416">Tweeted Athanasia Kotopoulos.</a></p>

<p><strong>Update 4:40 p.m.</strong>: According to an NBC employee watching the video feed, a cop &quot;just jumped over the glass encasing. He is sitting across from him talking. Police man is connected to a bungie/rope.&quot; In addition, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150420102400/http://twitter.com/#!/rozzy/status/101391684906135552">@rozzy Tweets</a>: &quot;Watching internal feed of man on top of Rock Center.

<p><strong>Update 4:45 p.m.</strong>: The NBC employee told us that the situation is &quot;actually getting kinda scary, police seem ready to snatch him and he seems ready to go.&quot; He adds that the jumper seems prepared for the attention: he &quot;has several bags, one of which has a jug of water, and was handing policemen letters with what I guess was messages on them. <strong>He has an american flag bandana covering his face and seems rather young. at most lower 20s</strong>.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Updated 4:50 p.m.</strong>: According to the NBC employee, police unsuccessfully just tried to grab the man, but missed: &quot;Was kind of a tense moment.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Updated 4:55 p.m.</strong>: According to the NBC employee, <strong>&quot;All is well, he agreed to come down and the police just got him over.&quot;</strong> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150420102400/http://twitter.com/#!/Alyssa_Zauderer/status/101395552108953600">Other</a> Twitter users <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150420102400/http://twitter.com/#!/rozzy/status/101395150827298816">are confirming</a> that report.
