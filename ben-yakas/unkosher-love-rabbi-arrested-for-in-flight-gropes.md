Rabbi Gavriel Bidany, 47, has been charged with misdemeanor assault in the March 27 incident aboard a Delta flight. And according to court papers obtained by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428042546/http://www.thesmokinggun.com/documents/sex/fbi-busts-rabbi-flight-groping-764209">The Smoking Gun</a>, the shlemiel tired to use the lamest excuse in the old testament when confronted by the woman: <strong>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s a mistake, I&#x2019;m asleep,&#x201D;</strong> he claimed.</p>

<p>According to the woman, whose identity wasn&apos;t revealed, Bidany &#x201C;placed his hand under her blanket, on her groin, and was groping her genital area.&#x201D; After she scolded him, she put the blanket over her head and body and attempted to go back to sleep. But minutes later, Bidany again &#x201C;reached under the passenger&#x2019;s blanket, this time groping the passenger&#x2019;s breasts.&#x201D; She yelled at him, &#x201C;What are you doing, stop touching me,&#x201D; to which he responded that he was asleep. </p>

<p>The woman reported him to the flight crew, and Bidany was arrested, but &#x201C;asserts his total innocence&#x201D; and contends that the alleged sexual contact &#x201C;never occurred.&#x201D;  We&apos;re reminded of an old Talmudic proverb that we think could be good for Rabbi Bidany to meditate upon: &quot;my honey my baby don&apos;t put my love upon no shelf/ she said don&apos;t give no lines and keep your hands to yourself&quot;:</p>
