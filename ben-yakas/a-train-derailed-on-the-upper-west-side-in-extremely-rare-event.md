<p>An A train derailed on the Upper West Side earlier this morning. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425175051/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local/new_york&amp;id=8929264&amp;rss=rss-wabc-article-8929264">According to ABC</a>, the derailment happened near the West 81st Street station in Manhattan just after 9 a.m. Dozens of straphangers were evacuated; no injuries have been reported. It&apos;s unclear what caused the derailment, but it certainly was an unusual : &quot;Derailments are extremely rare events,&quot; MTA spokesman Charles Seaton told us. &quot;The cause remains under investigation.&quot;</p>

<p>People took the train troubles in stride: &quot;Due to the train derailment on A/D track this morning, I was able to spend $45 on a [cab] to get to Brooklyn for work on time. #soblessed,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425175051/https://twitter.com/BrittneyMorello/status/282549954759757824">tweeted Brittney Morello.</a> Others saw this as a sign of MTA chief Joe Lhota somehow <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425175051/https://twitter.com/JurryL212/status/282545685444845569">having his eye off the ball</a>: &quot;So the head of the #MTA wants to be mayor, but the #Atrain derailment was a disaster this morning! No thanks dude!&quot;  But at least it didn&apos;t cause any <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425175051/https://twitter.com/romford_stu/status/282551082700398592"><em>Back To The Future 3</em>-esque scenarios.</a></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425175051/http://www.mta.info/status/serviceStatus.html">According to MTA</a>, the A and D trains are running local from 125th Street to 59th Street in both directions. The C train is suspended from the Euclid Avenue Station to the 168 Street Station in both directions as well.</p>
