<p>Motorcycle aficionado <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502140018/http://gothamist.com/tags/billyjoel">Billy Joel</a> will take some time out of his busy schedule <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502140018/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/26/magazine/billy-joel-on-not-working-and-not-giving-up-drinking.html">hating pop music</a> to perform for the first time in NYC in years at Barclays Center on New Year&apos;s Eve. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502140018/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/billy-joel-playing-brooklyns-barclays-center-on-new-years-eve-20131031">show will be</a> Joel&apos;s first arena concert in NYC since 2006, and his first show in NYC since closing out Shea Stadium in 2008 (give or take a Sandy benefit). One might even say that he&apos;s in a...New York...state...of...</p>

<p>&#x201C;When we opened Barclays Center 13 months ago, Billy was one of the must-have artists for our building and we are thrilled that he will be ringing in the New Year on Brooklyn&apos;s biggest stage,&quot; Brett Yormark, CEO of Barclays Center said in a statement. &quot;New York City born and Long Island raised, Billy is an iconic New Yorker and we are looking forward to a memorable evening.&quot; </p>

<p>Joel was the most popular man of the hour <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502140018/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/13/videos_photos_all-star_musicians_br.php#photo-1">at the 12-12-12 Sandy benefit show</a> last year at MSG&#x2014;all anyone could talk about on Twitter afterwards was how much they want him to tour again. He dipped his toes in the water with a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502140018/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/17/videos_four_things_we_learned_at_la.php">warm-up show in Long Island last month</a>, in which he pulled out a lot of deep cuts.</p>

<p>But now Joel has a good reason to grab a bottle of red, or maybe a bottle of white, hop on his trusted Harley with a supermodel or two, and drive down the LIE till the sun don&apos;t shine no more. Tickets for the New Year&apos;s Eve show go on sale to the public at 10 a.m. Nov. 9th through Ticketmaster. American Express cardholders can start buying pre-sale tickets at 10 a.m. Nov. 4th. </p>
