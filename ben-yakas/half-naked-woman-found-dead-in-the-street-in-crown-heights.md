<p>Thanks possibly to the freezing temperatures outside, NYC <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130813083303/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/26/nyc_has_9_days_without_murder_thank.php">has gone 9 days without a murder</a>&#x2014;but that streak may be over. Police are investigating the death of a woman who was found half-naked in the street in Crown Heights early Friday morning. </p>

<p>The woman, who is said to be in her 40s, was found on the ground in front of 1202 Union Street around 6:30 a.m. Friday. Police said she was naked from the waist down. The unconscious woman was taken to Kings County Hospital where she was pronounced DOA.
