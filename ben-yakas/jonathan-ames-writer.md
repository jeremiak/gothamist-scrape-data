By turns novelist, essayist, journalist, theatrical performer, and amateur boxer, the Ames style has remained unmistakable&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509213244/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/20/books/review/Beyer-t.html">as the Times put it</a>, Ames &quot;has rarely strayed far from himself.&quot;</em></p><em>

</em><p><em>His latest incarnation is that of TV writer/creator/showrunner of &quot;Bored to Death,&quot; the noir-otic comedy which just completed its first season on HBO last week. We caught up with the busy Ames via email, reflecting on the first season, doppelgangers, and favorite Brooklyn haunts. Tomorrow night he co-hosts <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509213244/http://www.themoth.org/ball">the Moth Ball</a> with Garrison Keillor.</em></p>

<p><strong>How similar is fictional J Ames to real life J Ames?</strong> Not too similar.  We do share some biographical traits, though&#x2014;we wrote the same first novel, I Pass Like Night, we both went to Princeton, and as children we had back spasms and were forced to wear a corset by an orthopedist who should have been practicing in England during the Victorian era.</p>

<p><strong>Did Jason Schwartzman follow you around for notes?</strong> We spent a few weeks before the pilot, going over the script, hanging out in Brooklyn, and just acclimating him to New York. </p>

<p><strong>Do people confuse you with your fictional character&apos;s personality/exploits?</strong> Not that I know of, but people do have all sorts of strange ideas about me, though these ideas all come from my books.  But it&apos;s all very odd to me because I have artistic amnesia&#x2014;once I write something it&apos;s almost like it never happened.  I perform my own Stalinaztion on my own life&#x2014;by recording my life I sort of erase it.</p>

<p><strong>Do you think it&apos;s somewhat egotistical to name a fictional character after yourself, or just sign of a healthy sense of ego?</strong> Definitely egotistical.  Not to mention self-centered and self-absorbed. </p>

<p><strong>Do you see your fictional character as closer to idealization or projection?</strong> Projection &#x2014; he gets to be a hero, which I would love to be.</p>
