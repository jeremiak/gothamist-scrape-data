<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170621091022/http://gothamist.com/tags/alecbaldwin">Alec Baldwin</a> has been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170621091022/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/18/alec_baldwin_returns_snl_trump.php">famously non-committal</a> about whether or not he would continue doing his Donald Trump impression on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170621091022/http://gothamist.com/tags/snl"><em>Saturday Night Live</em></a> after the election. And even though he ended up doing a few of the post-election episodes (much to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170621091022/http://gothamist.com/2016/12/04/again_snl_mocks_donald_trumps_tweet.php">chagrin of Trump</a>), nothing was certain about how long he would continue inhabiting the essence of our President-elect. But in separate interviews today, Baldwin made it clear that he&apos;s going to keep popping up on SNL for the foreseeable future&#x2014;and may even perform his impression elsewhere.</p>

<p>&quot;I&apos;m gonna do [<em>Saturday Night Live</em>] as much as I can,&quot; Baldwin <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170621091022/http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/alec-baldwin-discussions-venues-play-donald-trump/story?id=44690623">told ABC</a>. &quot;And there&apos;s discussions about other venues we might pursue to further express our gratitude and admiration for the Trump administration.&quot; Baldwin, who can also be seen on TV as the host of ABC&apos;s new <em>Match Game</em> reboot, seemed game to portray Trump on SNL throughout his presidency, and credited Trump as being &quot;the head writer of all the material we do.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We just sit back and we look at Twitter, we read the news and we go, &apos;There it is!&apos; And we probably should be, according to the WGA [Writers Guild of America], be giving Trump some writing credits for what he&apos;s done for us,&quot; he said. &quot;We&apos;re just gonna sit back and just let the good times roll.&quot; </p>

<p>He echoed that sentiment <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170621091022/http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2017/01/11/alec-baldwin-on-snl-trump-himself-is-the-head-writer/">to the Wall Street Journal</a>: &quot;Trump himself is the head writer. By the end of the week you have a basket of things you can choose from,&#x201D; Baldwin said.</p>

<p>But he noted that he doesn&apos;t want to overuse the impression in every episode (&quot;I think they realize we need to slow it down, you can&#x2019;t have it every weekend&quot;). He also told the WSJ that he wasn&apos;t concerned about younger people associating him with Trump in the future: &quot;Better they know me for that rather than killing my wife,&quot; he joked, referring to OJ Simpson. </p>

<p>In the meantime, Baldwin has had a lot of fun &quot;interacting&quot; with Trump on social media, whether through photos with Russian-emblazoned red hats or his various tweets on the latest political news.</p>
