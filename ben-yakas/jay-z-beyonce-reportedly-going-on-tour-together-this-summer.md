<p>With <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144419/http://gothamist.com/tags/beyonce">Beyonc&#xE9;</a> recently ending her year-long &#x201C;Mrs. Carter Show World Tour&#x201D; and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144419/http://gothamist.com/tags/jayz">Jay Z</a> recently finishing his 52-date &#x201C;Magna Carter World Tour,&#x201D; there is clearly only one logical thing for them to do now: go on tour again....<em>together.</em> And if it happens to be called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144419/http://gothamist.com/2014/04/06/jay_z_wears_controversial_medallion.php">The Mr. &amp; Mrs. Carter&apos;s Illuminati Express Medicine Show</a>, then all the better.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144419/http://pagesix.com/2014/04/15/beyonce-and-jay-z-to-go-on-tour-this-summer/?_ga=1.35213987.349300054.1312455005">The Post&apos;s sources say</a> the couple will soon announce a 20-stadium US tour that will start in late June, and will possibly include a NYC show on July 4th. It&apos;s worth noting that Page Six is the only source so far for the joint tour rumor, so hopefully this won&apos;t just turn out to be another <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144419/http://nypost.com/2013/01/24/o-are-you-here-too-mr-prez/">&quot;Manti Te&#x2019;o-style&quot; fantasy</a> dreamed up by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144419/http://gothamist.com/tags/andreapeyser">Andrea Peyser</a> while on a catnip bender. </p>

<p>This would be the couple&apos;s first full joint tour together, although they have collaborated frequently, and occasionally performed songs together, like &quot;Drunk In Love&quot; at the Grammys this year.</p>

<p>We still have so many questions: who will be the opener? Is this part of their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144419/http://hollywoodlife.com/2013/11/14/beyonce-jay-z-marriage-separation-divorce-truth/">marriage counseling</a>? Is it better to be drunk or crazy in love? Will Jay Z be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144419/http://nypost.com/2014/01/28/beyonce-jay-z-this-is-marriage/">&quot;pleased at his wife&#x2019;s hyper-sexualized exhibition on stage?&quot;</a> What really happened to Flight 370? Have Beyonce and Kim Kardashian <em>really</em> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144419/http://www.mstarz.com/articles/29074/20140414/kim-kardashian-beyonce-squash-beef-kanye-west-jay-z-bromance-new-wedding-bffs-fans-respond-gal-pal-spa-day-photos.htm">squashed their beef</a>? How many <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144419/http://gothamist.com/2014/04/06/jay_z_wears_controversial_medallion.php">racist medallions will Jay Z wear</a>?</p>
