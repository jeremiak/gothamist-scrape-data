                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="91413subway.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130916233914im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/91413subway.jpg" width="640" height="480"> <br> <i> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130916233914/http://instagram.com/p/eNBJl0LHg7/">Ginavergel&apos;s Instagram</a></i></div> <p></p>

<p>Yesterday, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130916233914/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/13/power_outage_at_west_81st_st_stops.php">power was lost</a> for nearly two hours on the third rail at Manhattan&apos;s West 81st Street subway station, which resulted in subway service suspensions on the A, B, C, and D lines between 59th Street and 125th Street. Besides causing massive delays and commuter headaches, at least four trains were stuck in the tunnels. Thankfully, there was one A train conductor who did her best to alleviate the situation and comfort straphangers with some gallows humor: &#x201C;I can&#x2019;t tell you how long it will be, but at least we know it&#x2019;s not a terrorist attack&#x2014;because they would have blown us up by now, or let out the gas or whatever and killed us,&#x201D; Paquita Williams told riders, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130916233914/http://nypost.com/2013/09/13/pregnant-woman-among-passengers-stuck-in-subway-train/">according to the Post.</a></p>

<p>&#x201C;So that&#x2019;s good,&quot; Williams cheerfully added. &quot;Just be calm. Everyone bust out Candy Crush. You have air conditioning. Relax!&#x201D; Williamsburg resident Laura Lane told the Post that Williams&apos; attitude cheered everyone up while they were stuck on the train for just under an hour: &#x201C;She was really hilarious about the situation and cracking jokes. She was so funny. Everyone went from upset and annoyed to being super calm. Her sense of humor about the situation loosened everyone in the car up.&#x201D;</p>

<p>&#x201C;One lady joked, &#x2018;Let&#x2019;s do it again &#x2014; the same time, same place!&#x2019; Everyone felt a connection with her,&#x201D; Lane added. Her co-workers weren&apos;t surprised at how well she handled the situation: &#x201C;That&#x2019;s who she is,&#x201D; said terminal dispatcher Rafael Martinez. &#x201C;She takes over and does what she needs to do to make sure everyone is comfortable and taken care of.&#x201D;</p>

<p>At least one pregnant woman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130916233914/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/pregnant-woman-passes-stalled-subway-train-article-1.1455275">fainted on a trapped train</a> and had to wait almost 90 minutes before she could be taken to St. Luke&apos;s Hospital; another rider <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130916233914/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2013/09/13/power-problems-cause-delays-disruptions-on-subway/">got sick</a> and had to be taken to the hospital as well. MTA officials said that the outage was caused by a metal plate becoming loose and coming into contact with the third rail near 81st Street. </p>
