<p>One might think that police and security guards are supposed to break up fights that erupt right in front of them, or at the very least <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160302173751/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/25/report_nypd_handling_of_occupy_wall.php">get in on</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160302173751/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/22/teen_says_deli_surveillance_video_s.php">the action</a>. But as you can see around the :25 mark of the video below, what appears to be a plainclothes cop (with badge hanging his neck) and a security person of some kind (man in uniform with nightstick) stood by as a man viciously beat another man in Union Square. While other onlookers try to stop the topless attacker, no police intervene. </p>

<p>We&apos;ve contacted the video uploader to try to get more information about the incident. But this is the second time this week we&apos;ve seen video of a fight occurring in a heavily trafficked area of Manhattan. Earlier this week, we watched as a homeless man and a tourist <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160302173751/http://gothamist.com/2012/08/27/watch_two_men_fight_with_crutches_i.php">sparred in Times Square</a>&#x2014;despite being in one of the most police-saturated areas of the city, they were able to use police barricades and crutches to beat each other with nary a complaint.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: We contacted a Parks spokesman to inquire whether park security are expected to intervene in such situations, but were told to contact the NYPD with all questions.</p>
