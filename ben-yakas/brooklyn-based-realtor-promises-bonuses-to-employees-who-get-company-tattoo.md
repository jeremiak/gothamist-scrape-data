<p>They may not be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604043822/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNA1kT7J5oE">Anime posters-level odd</a>, but this is certainly one of the weirdest motivational strategies we&apos;ve heard of: a local realtor has promised employees bonuses if they just get the company logo tattooed on them. No doubt inspired by the incredible productivity of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604043822/http://disinfo.com/2010/09/meet-billy-the-human-billboard-boxer-pays-the-bills-with-tattoo-sponsorships/#sthash.ZCpCcnsl.Sb3UHhDD.dpbs">Billy the Human Billboard</a>, Brooklyn-based <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604043822/http://www.rapidnyc.com/about/about_us">Rapid Realty NYC</a> is giving employers who get inked <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604043822/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2013/04/30/nyc-realtor-offers-employees-pay-raise-for-getting-inked-with-company-logo/">a 15 percent pay raise</a>. &#x201C;I think it&#x2019;s a good opportunity to show commitment to a company that makes going to work fun every day,&#x201D; Robert Trezza, who is the 40th employee to get the tattoo, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604043822/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2013/04/30/nyc-realtor-offers-employees-pay-raise-for-getting-inked-with-company-logo/2/">told CBS.</a> </p>

<p>After looking through some of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604043822/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/01/early_addition_1251.php">most nightmarish tattoos we&apos;ve ever seen</a> earlier today, Rapid Realty&apos;s plan doesn&apos;t seem so absurd to us right now (even if it does get us one step closer to real life <em>Idiocracy</em>). People get so many lousy tattoos of cliched aphorisms on their shoulder blade or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604043822/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/26/this_is_how_to_show_your_love_for_t.php">Giants players on their butts</a>, why not make some money off of it? Of course, we might not be thrilled to still have the tat if we left the company, but it&apos;s getting <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604043822/http://www.rethinktattooremovalnyc.com/">easier and easier</a> to remove those Google tramp stamps these days. So would you get your company inscribed on your body? </p>
