<p>A 12-year-old girl is in critical condition after she was struck by a driver in Borough Park on Saturday. The victim, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140624121826/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/girl-12-struck-car-brooklyn-article-1.1747324">whom the News says</a> is an Orthodox Jew, was playing with a friend on 59th Street near 12th Avenue around 5:30 p.m. yesterday when the incident happened. Police say the child stepped out from between two parked cars and was struck by a driver in a Honda Accord. &quot;The person in the car didn&#x2019;t see the girl,&quot; Chez Parnes, the father of the other child playing with the 12-year-old, told the News.</p>

<p>&quot;On Saturday in a heavily Jewish area like this, maybe one car passes down the block every hour,&quot; Parnes added. &quot;This was very surprising.&quot; The girl was taken to Lutheran Medical Center with a critical head injury. The driver remained at the scene; police say no criminality is suspected, no charges have been filed, and the investigation is ongoing. </p>

<p>At least two cyclists have been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140624121826/http://gothamist.com/2012/09/11/13-year-old_cyclist_in_critical_con.php#photo-1">fatally struck</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140624121826/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/08/brooklyn_cyclist_killed_after_being.php">by drivers</a> in the neighborhood in recent years. Back in 2012, a 5-year-old deaf child <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140624121826/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/15/saddest_story_ever_deaf_parents_wat.php">was struck by a driver</a> when he stepped into the street.</p>
