</div></div>					<p><strong>[Update Below]</strong> A beached whaled was spotted this morning in Breezy Point, where it remains stuck. The whale washed ashore at Beach 216th Street &amp; Palmer Drive in Queens and was spotted around 10:30 a.m. According to the Coast Guard, the 30-foot whale hasn&apos;t been identified yet, but confirmed that as of 12 p.m. it &quot;is still alive.&quot; They say police and NYPD Harbor patrols are keeping an eye on it while they wait for a member of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160714151422/http://www.riverheadfoundation.org/">Riverhead Foundation</a> to figure out a next step.</p>

<p>The Coast Guard added that &quot;we really don&apos;t have any say in the situation, but we&apos;re standing by to help as we can.&quot; As you can see in the photos above, Point Breeze Volunteer Fire Department members are currently pumping sea water on the whale to keep it alive. We&apos;ll update as we learn more.</p>

<p><strong>Update 1:50 p.m.</strong>: According <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160714151422/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/queens/rescuers-race-save-beached-whale-breezy-point-article-1.1227492#ixzz2GBUJzTZp">to the News</a>&#x2014;who have some pretty excellent photos&#x2014;the 40-foot sperm whale might be pregnant. Volunteer firefighters continue to pump sea water on it&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160714151422/http://www.facebook.com/PointBreezeVFD">they add that</a> &quot;the whale has more movement then [sic] on arrival.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Update 3:10 p.m.</strong>: We spoke to Kris De Roo, who works for the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160714151422/http://www.acs-la.org/GWCensus.htm">ACS/LA Gray Whale Census and Behavior Project</a>, who disagreed with initial reports that this is a sperm whale. &quot;It&apos;s not a sperm whale, which have teeth. This whale has baleen,&quot; he told us. &quot;It&apos;s clearly a fin whale (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160714151422/http://www.arkive.org/fin-whale/balaenoptera-physalus/image-G1047.html">Balaenoptera physalus</a>). Note the long, slender body, backswept dorsal fin, and asymmetrical coloration (the front right third of the baleen is yellowish-white, while the rest is dark).&quot; He also said he thinks it looks more emaciated than pregnant.</p>

<p>That was confirmed by Kim Durham, rescue coordinator with the Riverhead Foundation who is with the whale: &quot;The whale is severely emaciated. It&apos;s in very bad shape. It&apos;s a very sick whale,&quot; Durham <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160714151422/http://www.newsday.com/news/nation/beached-whale-in-breezy-point-not-expected-to-survive-1.4376348">told Newsday</a>. Unfortunately, things aren&apos;t looking good for the whale, and it isn&apos;t expected to survive: <br>
&quot;Probably we&apos;ll let nature take its turn with this animal.&quot;</p>
