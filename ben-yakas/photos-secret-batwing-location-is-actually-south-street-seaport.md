<p>Yesterday, obscure indie flick <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161346/http://gothamist.com/tags/thedarkknightrises"><em>The Dark Knight Rises</em></a> took over lower Manhattan <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161346/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/05/this_weekends_dark_knight_rises_fil.php">near Wall Street</a> to film what will undoubtedly be an epic battle scene in the streets of Gotham City. Director Christopher Nolan <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161346/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/05/photos_the_dark_knight_rises.php#photo-1">watched as over a thousand extras</a> took to the streets for filming&#x2014;and stars Christian Bale (Batman) and Tom Hardy (Bane) were on set too for a climactic battle; see <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161346/http://www.comicbookmovie.com/fansites/debbiedowner/news/?a=49444">pics of them in costume here</a>. You can check out some more videos from yesterday&apos;s filming below&#x2014;and above, there are pics of the batwing parked near the South Street Seaport (as well as a Batman doll in the driver&apos;s seat). Does this mean the entrance to the Batcave is somewhere in the East River?</p>
