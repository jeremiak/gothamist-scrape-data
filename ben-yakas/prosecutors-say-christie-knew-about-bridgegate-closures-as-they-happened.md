<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171030064434/http://gothamist.com/tags/chrischristie">Gov. Chris Christie&apos;s</a> very bad, terrible, no good year continued its downward descent: federal prosecutors asserted today that Christie was made aware of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171030064434/http://gothamist.com/tags/bridgegate">the bridge lane closures on the George Washington Bridge</a> as they happened in real time in 2013. This is the first time that Christie has been accused of knowing about the scandal as it unfolded over four days in Fort Lee.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171030064434/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/20/nyregion/bridgegate-trial.html?smprod=nytcore-iphone&amp;smid=nytcore-iphone-share&amp;_r=2&amp;mtrref=t.co">The NY Times reports that</a> the accusation came in the opening statements in the trial of two former Christie administration officials, Bridget Anne Kelly and Bill Baroni. Kelly and Baroni have been charged with conspiracy, fraud, and other crimes related to the bridge closure scheme.</p>

<p>U.S. Attorney Vikas Khanna said that former Port Authority official David Wildstein will testify that he and Baroni were so pleased with the act of retaliation against Fort Lee Mayor Mark Sokolich for failing to endorse Christie, they &#x201C;bragged&#x201D; about the traffic gridlock directly to Christie.</p>

<p>&#x201C;The evidence will show that Baroni and Wildstein were so committed to their plan that, during the precious moments they had alone with the governor, they bragged about the fact that there were traffic problems in Fort Lee and that Mayor Sokolich was not getting his calls returned,&#x201D; Khanna told jurors in Newark Federal Court.</p>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Remember, Wildstein&apos;s lawyer has said that &quot;evidence exists&quot; that Christie knew about closures as they occurred <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171030064434/https://t.co/HQCd4PYrPe">https://t.co/HQCd4PYrPe</a></p>&#x2014; Steve Kornacki (@SteveKornacki) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171030064434/https://twitter.com/SteveKornacki/status/777901913257959424">September 19, 2016</a></blockquote>

<p>Defense lawyers have admitted that Christie knew about the scandal, having been told at a 9/11 commemoration ceremony in Lower Manhattan in 2013. But as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171030064434/http://www.politico.com/states/new-jersey/story/2016/09/federal-prosecutor-says-christie-knew-about-lane-closings-105584">Politico points out,</a> a 2014 report by the law firm Gibson Dunn &amp; Crutcher (which was commissioned by Christie and paid for with millions in taxpayer funds) did everything it could to minimize the damage:</p>

<blockquote>&#x201C;It seems incredible that, in a public setting leading up to a 9/11 Memorial event, surrounded by other government officials and scores of constituents seeking photographs and handshakes, anything substantive or inculpatory would have been discussed.&quot;

<p>The report went on to say that &#x201C;even if credited, any passing reference by Wildstein made in a social, public setting at the time of a public 9/11 Memorial event to traffic issue in Fort Lee would not have been meaningful or memorable to the Governor,&#x201D; and that Christie &#x201C;recalls no such exchange.&#x201D;</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>Prosecutors have made it clear that Christie had far more substantial knowledge of the incident than was previously thought. And you know who also thinks Christie knew all about Bridgegate? His Pumpkin Overlord Donald Trump.</p>
