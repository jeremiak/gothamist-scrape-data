					<p>Last night, The Daily Show flung open the doors to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171104151556/http://gothamist.com/2017/06/13/daily_show_trump_twitter.php"><em>The Daily Show Presents: The Donald J. Trump Presidential Twitter Library</em></a>, an interactive library paying tribute to the 45th President&apos;s unique relationship with his favorite social media medium. </p>

<p>Correspondent Jordan Klepper explained why they staged it a stone&apos;s throw from Trump Tower: &quot;I think much like the briefings that he gets, which they have to put his name into the first paragraphs of so he pays attention, there&apos;s a chance he&apos;ll be drawn to the fact that his name is on the outside of a building, so fingers crossed!&quot; </p>

<p>It was at then that we heard from a press person that Eric Trump had indeed been spotted in front of the building. They said he looked up and down, then kept walking. &quot;This is really a testament to his father. I&apos;d love him to swing by,&quot; Klepper said. &quot;I think he went off hunting. He had a sabertooth tiger to kill.&quot;</p>

<p>It&apos;s really too bad Eric didn&apos;t come in&#x2014;it would be interesting to witness his reaction to the first thing you see upon entering: a model of Trump&apos;s famously small hands grasping toward his smartphone. The library, which is open all weekend to the public from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. at 3 West 57th Street, is a truly impressive cataloguing of Trump&apos;s Twitter life. Fellow correspondent Hasan Minhaj explained that the Daily Show writers were talking about presidential libraries when they started wondering what Trump&apos;s artistic or literary contribution to society might be, when the only thing we have are his tweets. &quot;Which, sadly enough is like, well all right, let&apos;s find the most regal way to present the incoherent and insane ramblings of President number 45,&quot; he said.</p>

<p>While the exhibit is meticulously put together, it is also overwhelming to be surrounded by so much hatred. There are a number of interactive games (including a giant Trump magnetic wall, &#xE0; la fridge poetry), a nickname generator (I got both &quot;Dummy Ben Yakas&quot; and &quot;Jowly Ben Yakas&quot;), a fake Oval Office (complete with golden toilet), and a live feed of his Twitter account (which makes the sound <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171104151556/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=niSLZDVApdQ">&quot;bing bing bong bong&quot;</a> every time there&apos;s a new tweet from the President). </p>

<p>It&apos;s a strange experience indeed to digest Trump&apos;s tweets as one single body of work. The tweets are divided up by category (such as &quot;Constructive Criticism,&quot; &quot;Deleted But Not Forgotten&quot; and &quot;Verified Survivors&quot;), with several particularly infamous ones (like covfefe, or the Cinco de Mayo picture, or the one claiming Obama had &quot;tapp my phone,&quot; or his original birther tweet) given special prominence with gold frames. </p>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Jordan Klepper showed me his favorite Trimp tweet: &quot;We&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171104151556/https://t.co/HYf31hoWSt">pic.twitter.com/HYf31hoWSt</a></p>&#x2014; Ben Yakas (@yenbakas) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171104151556/https://twitter.com/yenbakas/status/875500486270627840">June 15, 2017</a></blockquote>

<p>So while the exhibit is ostensibly a comedy bit, the dark edge is purposeful, and something they realized is very unavoidable. Minhaj was blown away by the amount of birther tweets Trump made: &quot;I thought that was something he mentioned on The View once,&quot; he said. &quot;And it&apos;s like, oh no, he really was dedicated to embedding this xenophobic, racist ideology into the public. And so you can physically see all 27 tweets. And you&apos;re like, oh wow it&apos;s something he didn&apos;t let go of.&quot;</p>

<p>Minhaj understood why I felt so overwhelmed. If anything, he also seemed more than a bit exhausted by the constant stream of Trump: &quot;My life as a Daily Show correspondent is now in constant limbo where I feel like I&apos;m in the strangest improv game of all time. Whatever suggestion he throws my way we kind of have to roll with.&quot;  </p>

<p>He also hoped that being able to process it all with likeminded, sympathetic people would take some of the edge off: &quot;At least you are here with other human beings,&quot; he said. &quot;And a lot of times we have to read these tweets in the silence of our own home and we&apos;re just like, why is this happening? And now you can turn to somebody else and be like, &apos;Why <em>is</em> this happening?&apos; And I think there is something cathartic in that.&quot;</p>

<p>Trevor Noah addressed the room, explaining the project thus: &quot;We wanted to take a moment to honor the President of the United States, and really, the King of Twitter, with this library,&quot; he said. &quot;Donald Trump is best experienced in his purest form.&quot; He also took a few questions from the reporters assembled, like whether it is dangerous that the President is blocking citizens on Twitter: &quot;If you are a hater or a loser, you deserve to be blocked.&quot; You can see a large portion of his address in the video below.</p>

<p>Klepper was at least somewhat optimistic about what sort of precedent Trump&apos;s behavior may set for future politicians: &quot;My fingers are crossed we use this as a cautionary tale and the other people who will have that kind of power respect that, but I don&apos;t think it&apos;s good for us when we are so loose with our words.&quot; </p>
