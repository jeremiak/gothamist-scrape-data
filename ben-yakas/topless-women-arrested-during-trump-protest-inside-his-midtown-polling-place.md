<p>Two women were arrested this morning after they took their shirts off and shouted about Donald Trump inside the Midtown polling place where Trump is scheduled to vote today.</p>

<p>An NYPD spokesperson confirmed that two women, ages 28 and 30, entered the polling site at PS 59 on East 56th Street around 8:50 a.m. Tuesday. Once inside, they removed their shirts and started yelling anti-Trump sentiments. &quot;Trump, grab your balls&quot; was written on one of the women&apos;s bare chest and stomach; the other&apos;s read &quot;Hate out of my polls.&quot; The women were arrested without incident at the site, and charges are pending.</p>

<p>Video of the incident was captured by Sharon Clott Kanter, a deputy style editor at People Magazine:</p>
