                            <p><br>
Yesterday, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140206174608/http://gothamist.com/tags/banksy">Banksy</a> put up the latest piece on his whirlwind month-long open air street art tour of NYC in the East Village. And in less than 24 hours since <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140206174608/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/12/banksy_puts_up_concrete_confessiona.php">&quot;concrete confessional&quot; went up</a> on East 7th Street and Cooper Square, it&apos;s been defaced. But hey, at least no one <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140206174608/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/10/video_things_are_getting_interestin.php#photo-1">tried to make a profit off of it.</a></p>

<p>The piece, which is located across the street from the First Ukrainian Assembly of God, is based on a photo by Berni Schoenfield from the 1950s, which depicts a Jesuit priest at the Martyr&#x2019;s Shrine in Ontario (you can see <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140206174608/http://animalnewyork.com/2013/banksyny-12-concret-confessional-in-the-east-village/">the original photo at Animal NY)</a>. Now, Banksy&apos;s concrete piece has a crude white beard and medallion spray-painted on. </p>

<p>In addition, other street artists have put up their responses, imitations and tributes all around the piece (see the second and third photos above). So far today, there&apos;s been no new pieces <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140206174608/http://www.banksy.co.uk/">posted on Banksy&apos;s website</a>, so maybe he&apos;s taking the day off to participate in the Zombie Crawl.</p>
