While the French have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141027024135/http://gothamist.com/2013/12/07/check_out_this_charming_parisian_su.php#photo-1">their charming &quot;politeness manual&quot;</a>, the Japanese have their own series of colorful etiquette posters offering &quot;manners from the heart.&quot;</p>

<p>Click through above to see the latest series from the Metro Cultural Foundation, a public works initiative of the Tokyo subway. With some help from Emily Compton and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141027024135/http://www.openmindvision.com/">Michael McAteer</a>, we translated the 10 posters that have gone up so far. </p>

<p>As for why they start in April and not January, Compton thinks it could be due to the start of the new school year and the beginning of the government&apos;s fiscal year: &quot;Many yearly cycles in Japan seem to begin around the time the cherry trees all bloom!&quot; Stylistically, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141027024135/http://www.fastcodesign.com/3023869/completely-adorable-posters-about-manners-from-the-tokyo-metro">Fast Company points out</a> that they&apos;re reminiscent of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141027024135/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Productions_of_America">UPA&apos;s cartoons</a> from the 1950s and 1960s.</p>

<p>As good as these ones are, if the MTA is thinking about borrowing a page from them, they might want to enlist some puppy and kitten models and go with their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141027024135/http://www.metrocf.or.jp/manners/manner-poster.html">animal-themed campaign from two years ago. </a></p>
