<p>It wasn&apos;t enough that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505144729/http://gothamist.com/tags/50shadesofgrey"><em>50 Shades Of Grey</em></a> topped the NY Times Bestsellers list for a bajillion weeks in a row, or that it&apos;s going to be turned <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505144729/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/13/who_should_be_cast_in_the_fifty_sha.php#photo-1">into a film series</a>, or that the books have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505144729/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/14/fifty_shades_of_sad_sexy_supermodel.php">seduced our sultriest supermodels</a>. No, for fans of the mommy porn series, it won&apos;t be enough until you can buy <em>50 Shades</em>-emblazoned toothpaste to go with your kinky Christian Grey glow-in-the-dark toothbrush.

Below, we listed five of the most notable, bizarre, and altogether bad mommy porn tie-ins we&apos;ve come across.</p>

<p><strong>50 Shades Of Grey Travel</strong>: Hey, here&apos;s an idea&#x2014;you have no overwhelming interest in travelling any place in particular, so why don&apos;t you plan your next vacation based around the locations the main characters would totally go to if, you know, they existed? It&apos;s not like travelling is even that expensive anymore, right? Here&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505144729/http://www.trippy.com/friends/4eb96c1ee4b0c0ec367ca006/Fifty_Shades_of_Grey.html?ver=1">the pitch</a>: </p>

<blockquote>If you&#x2019;re looking to plan a trip but aren&#x2019;t quite sure where to go, Trippy&#x2019;s Fifty Shades of Grey board is a great jumping off point if you&#x2019;re a fan of the series or are just intrigued by the cultural phenomenon and interested in how the series can serve as a guide for travelers. The Trippy board features the locations included in the book as well as some ideas for where a real-life Christian and Ana might visit.</blockquote>

<p>And of course, it doesn&apos;t make much sense when the sexy-time packages <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505144729/http://www.equities.com/news/news-headline-story?dt=2012-08-10&amp;val=367535&amp;d=1&amp;cat=headline">are located in Brisbane, Australia.</a></p>
