<p>A Brooklyn musician is recovering after he lost an eye after he was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928014001/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Brooklyn-Musician-Attacked-Street-Hammer-Loses-Eye-Andrew-Barnes-215739481.html">attacked by a man with a hammer last week</a>. Dru Barnes, a member of the band <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928014001/https://www.facebook.com/JOGYO">Jogyo</a>, was walking home to Fort Greene from a friend&apos;s place in Bed-Stuy around 10 a.m. last Thursday when a man with a hammer came from behind and attacked him, striking him several times in the head. Barnes, 34, was rushed to the hospital: &quot;I arrive two hours later at the trauma unit, and there is Dru on a gurney. It was horrific, it was like a horror movie,&quot; Gerrit Vooren, the Bed-Stuy friend who Barnes had visited, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928014001/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Brooklyn-Musician-Attacked-Street-Hammer-Loses-Eye-Andrew-Barnes-215739481.html">told NBC 4 New York</a>.</p>

<p>Cops believe the suspect followed Barnes for a block before attacking him in front of 934 Jefferson Avenue. Officers have now recovered the hammer used in the attack, but the suspect is still at large. Police haven&apos;t determined a motive yet, but they do not believe it was a hate crime or a robbery. &quot;I&apos;m not sure what the motive was,&quot; Barnes said from the hospital in the video above. </p>

<p>Vooren <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928014001/https://www.facebook.com/DruBarnesHealingPage">has set up a Facebook page</a> to bring attention to the attack and help pay for the costs of the multiple surgeries Barnes has ahead of him. Doctors want to put in a prosthesis, but his optic nerve was completely severed, so he&apos;ll never be able to see out his left eye. &quot;To be honest, having been hit in the head with a hammer, it&apos;s a miracle Dru is alive, and even more so that there&apos;s no brain damage at all,&quot; Vooren wrote.</p>
