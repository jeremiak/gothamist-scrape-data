<p>Police have identified the bike-riding suspect <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130619235916/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/15/9-year-old_girl_shot_by_gunman_on_b.php">who allegedly shot a 9-year-old girl in the Bronx</a> on Friday night. Cops believe that 17-year-old Billy James Jr. shot 9-year-old Amanda Chauan around 9:30 p.m. at Bailey Avenue and West 234th Street in Kingsbridge. Amanda, who was shot in the stomach, was out playing with her 5-year-old brother Gustavo at the time: &#x201C;He was right there next to her,&#x201D; Amanda&#x2019;s grandmother, Wanda Forte, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130619235916/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/bronx/bronx-girl-shot-stomach-bike-riding-drive-by-gunman-article-1.1373673">told the News</a>. &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t know how he didn&#x2019;t get hit, too. They&#x2019;re just little kids. This shouldn&#x2019;t happen.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Witness Sam Fernandez said he saw the shooter slowly pedal past him aboard a BMX-style bike: &#x201C;He rode up...like he was trying to see who was out there, and then he did a loop out front,&#x201D; said Fernandez. &#x201C;He started shooting from the middle of the street.&#x201D; Other witnesses described the chaotic scene as six shots were fired: &#x201C;Everyone was running around,&quot; said neighbor Joanny Jiminez. &quot;The little girl, she was walking around panicking. She was screaming, &#x2018;I can&#x2019;t deal with this right now!&#x2019;&#x201D;</p>

<p>Amanda was taken to Jacobi Medical Center, where she is in stable condition: &#x201C;Last night was my worst day ever,&#x201D; her father, Gustavo, told the News. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m just glad to tell you she&#x2019;s doing good. Thank God. She&#x2019;s conscious.&#x201D; Police add that they don&apos;t believe she was the intended target of the shooter. </p>
