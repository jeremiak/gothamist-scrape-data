<p>Last week, learned all about how Bill Murray ended up mistakenly taking on the role of <em>Garfield</em> via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508194053/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/18/the_best_of_bill_murrays_amazing_re.php">his truly excellent Reddit AMA</a>. This week, a woman who worked in two S&amp;M; dungeons around the Herald Square area <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508194053/http://www.reddit.com/r/nyc/comments/1w1nvl/i_worked_in_a_nyc_sex_dungeon_ill_answer_any/">did her own fascinating AMA.</a></p>

<p>It wasn&apos;t quite as salacious as we expected, but she still provided plenty of interesting details about NYC&apos;s sex dungeon scene. Below, we&apos;ve picked out some of her best responses.</p>

<p><strong>Her Specialities</strong>: &quot;I did everything you can imagine and then more. When people say S&amp;M;, they usually envision whips and chains. That was the vanilla stuff in comparison. Different people specialized in different things; my speciality was CBT, enemas, psychological, and piercings/needle work. Some other fetishes include cupping, cutting, scatplay. Google at your own peril. A lot of the fantasies I acted out were very specific to the person. For example, someone wanted me to be a baby sitter that wouldn&apos;t allow him to urinate.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>What Wouldn&apos;t She Do</strong>: &quot;Sex, vomiting, and scat play. There were girls who would vomit/shit and the guys would do things like eat it. We called vomiting a roman :)&quot;</p>

<p><strong>How Much Did She Make</strong>: &quot;It ranges from place to place but one of dungeon charged $220/hr or $150/half hour. I pocketed $120 and $75 respectively. The other charged $120/hour and I kept $80. Tip is expected...I started at sex clubs as a personal interest. Then I thought, why not get paid for it! I made about $1500/week.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Who Worked There</strong>: &quot;Some people did it because they enjoyed it. Some people did it because money was tight. Overall, everyone came from different walks of life. There was a PHD candidate from Columbia, a nurse with an infant daughter, a day time adminstrator, a midget, and I currently work in finance.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>The Worst Experience She Had</strong>: &quot;Someone licked my nipples once. Gross...It was a bit too sexual, which sounds weird. All the other things I did weren&#x2019;t very sexual in nature to me. However, nipple licking is. Also the guy was highly unattractive. It was just too intimate. To this day, I can&#x2019;t think of anything else more off putting at the job than this one incident...It&apos;s like how some people consider kissing a very intimate thing. I consider the nipple licking too intimate. I disinfected with rubbing alcohol after.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Popularity Of Infantism:</strong> &quot;Pretty popular but there was always some twist. There was this hedge fund/banker kind of guy who wanted me to be his babysitter, feed him, and then make him pee into his diaper.&quot;</p>

<p>She was also asked whether she encountered many orthodox Jews on the job: &quot;Yes yes yes yes yes. Definitely one of my biggest shockers,&quot; she answered. &quot;Hasidism is a very restrictive religion in regards to sex. They don&apos;t fraternize with outsiders so they have to resort to sex workers.&quot;</p>
