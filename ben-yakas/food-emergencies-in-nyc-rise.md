										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2009_11_nycah.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504170527im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2009_11_nycah.jpg" width="230" height="143" class="image-left"> </span>In the distressing news pile today, a new study was released revealing that people are still going hungry in NYC in increased numbers. According to a report by the NYC Coalition Against Hunger (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504170527/http://nyccah.org/files/AnnualHungerSurveyReport_Nov09.pdf">PDF</a>), the number of people seeking emergency food services has risen <em>nearly 21 percent from last year</em>.  While the survey finds &quot;fewer agencies ran out of food than the year before,&quot; thanks to federal stimulus money, some food pantries are struggling to meet the growing need.</p>

<p>Rev. Paul Block, a pastor who works at the Bronx&apos;s Transfiguration Food Pantry, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504170527/http://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory?id=9154069">says</a>, &quot;In our neighborhood, there is an insatiable demand for food. <strong>Food insecurity is a significant problem. Even though we have increased tremendously the amount of people we serve, there continues to be people who are turned away.&quot;</strong>  And last week, the U.S. Department of Agriculture noted that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504170527/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/17/us/17hunger.html">hunger in the nation</a> was at a 14-year high, with 49 million Americans in households lacking &quot;consistent access to adequate food.&quot; </p>

<p>This seems like an appropriate moment to reflect on a different study released <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504170527/http://www.nyccah.org/node/498">earlier this month by NYCCAH</a> which found that<strong> the 56 richest people in New York had 27 times the money of the 1.5 million people living below the poverty line</strong>. More food for thought.</p>
