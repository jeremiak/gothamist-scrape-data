<p>Police shot a man who was allegedly stabbing his girlfriend with a knife in The Bronx early this morning. Police responded to 911 calls about the 34-year-old suspect assaulting his 32-year-old girlfriend at an apartment building on Sedgwick Avenue just before 4 a.m. When cops arrived, the suspect was stabbing her with an 8-inch kitchen knife (see photo above).</p>

<p>Officers ordered the suspect to drop the weapon; when he didn&apos;t comply and continued assaulting the woman, two uniformed cops fired one shot each, striking the suspect in the torso. The female victim, who suffered several stab wounds, was taken to Saint Barnabus Hospital in stable condition. </p>

<p>The suspect was also taken to Saint Barnabus, where he is expected to survive his injuries. Charges are pending, but police sources <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140818185700/http://nypost.com/2014/08/17/nypd-shoots-man-who-was-stabbing-his-girlfriend/">told the Post</a> the man had been arrested in March of 2013 for assaulting the same victim.</p>
