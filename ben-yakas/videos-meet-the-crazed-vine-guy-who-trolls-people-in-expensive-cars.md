<p>We don&apos;t know a huge amount about comedian and car enthusiast <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429192501/https://twitter.com/conner_omalley">Conner O&apos;Malley</a>, but we can say with 100% assurance that he is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429192501/http://autoweekusa.kinja.com/meet-conner-omalley-vines-car-troll-1331994860/1355172070@jesusdiaz">our new favorite Viner</a>. O&apos;Malley has taken full advantage of the surreal nature of Vine, posting several videos a week in which he yells at bizarre TV commercials or fetishizes Harry of <em>Harry and the Hendersons</em>. But our favorite bit of his is his love of walking up to rich people in expensive cars and mercilessly trolling them. We&apos;ve compiled some of our favorite videos of his below for your Friday afternoon enjoyment.</p>

<p>Sometimes he wants cars to stop fighting:</p>
