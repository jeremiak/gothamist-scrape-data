<p>This week, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161122130015/http://gothamist.com/tags/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> made <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161122130015/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/25/us/politics/donald-trump-black-voters.html">his most direct appeal</a> yet to African-American voters to join him in making America great for Donald Trump again. While painting a portrait of black America steeped in generalizations about failure, violence, hopelessness and poverty, Trump asked voters with a patented shrug, &quot;What do you have to lose?&quot; A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161122130015/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/28/us/politics/donald-trump-housing-race.html?_r=1">NY Times report today</a> on how Trump got his start in the housing industry under his father answers that question, with extensive documentation of the company&#x2019;s practice of turning away, or segregating, potential black tenants for decades.</p>

<p>The Times writes: &quot;Drawing on decades-old files from the New York City Commission on Human Rights, internal Justice Department records, court documents and interviews with tenants, civil rights activists and prosecutors, [this investigation] uncovered a long history of racial bias at his family&#x2019;s properties, in New York and beyond.&quot;</p>

<p>Most of the racist practices of the Trump organization were seemingly set by Trump&apos;s father, Fred Trump, who came under scrutiny starting in the 1960s from civil rights groups that had received complaints from prospective African-American tenants such as Maxine Brown. &quot;I just wanted a decent place to live,&quot; Brown reflected on her experience trying to get housing at a Trump building. </p>

<blockquote>She seemed like the model tenant. A 33-year-old nurse who was living at the Y.W.C.A. in Harlem, she had come to rent a one-bedroom at the still-unfinished Wilshire Apartments in the Jamaica Estates neighborhood of Queens. She filled out what the rental agent remembers as a &#x201C;beautiful application.&#x201D; She did not even want to look at the unit.

<p>There was just one hitch: Maxine Brown was black.</p>

<p>Stanley Leibowitz, the rental agent, talked to his boss, Fred C. Trump.</p>

<p>&#x201C;I asked him what to do and he says, &#x2018;Take the application and put it in a drawer and leave it there,&#x2019;&#x201D; Mr. Leibowitz, now 88, recalled in an interview.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>Brown filed a complaint with the New York City Commission on Human Rights, and after a hearing, eventually was offered an apartment. She was the only African-American in the building for over a decade. As the Times put it, &quot;the few minorities who did live in Trump-owned buildings often had to force their way in.&quot;</p>

<p>There are many other examples of these sort of practices in the piece, which add up to a portrait of a business that was continually unwilling to change its biased policies unless under extreme pressure by lawsuits or government oversight. The big takeaways here: Trump was being groomed by his father in the business throughout these incidents, and idolized his father (&quot;Anytime he would come into the building, Donald would be by his side,&quot; as one former employee put it). Even today, Trump can&apos;t admit any wrongdoing on the company&apos;s part&#x2014;to do so would be to admit his father wasn&apos;t perfect.</p>

<p>Also pointed: when the younger Trump found himself on the front pages of the tabloids for the first time when the Justice Department sued Trump Management for discriminating against blacks, Trump struck a stubborn, defiant pose, turning the lawsuit into &quot;a protracted battle, complete with angry denials, character assassination, charges that the government was trying to force him to rent to &#x201C;welfare recipients&#x201D; and a $100 million countersuit accusing the Justice Department of defamation.&quot; Going on the offensive and accusing your accusers of the very things you&apos;re accused of? Sounds familiar.</p>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Donald Trump on accusations of racism: &quot;It&apos;s the oldest play in the Democratic playbook&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161122130015/https://t.co/UYpqI3w42L">https://t.co/UYpqI3w42L</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161122130015/https://t.co/Q872lqTzlH">https://t.co/Q872lqTzlH</a></p>&#x2014; CNN (@CNN) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161122130015/https://twitter.com/CNN/status/768879001473544192">August 25, 2016</a></blockquote>

<p>Even after those countersuits were dismissed and he was forced to sign a consent decree (intended to ensure the desegregation of Trump properties), Donald viewed it as a great victory for the Trump organization. He dismissed all of it in a few paragraphs in <em>The Art Of The Deal</em>: &#x201C;In the end the government couldn&#x2019;t prove its case, and we ended up making a minor settlement without admitting any guilt,&#x201D; he wrote (though saying he wrote that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161122130015/http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/07/25/donald-trumps-ghostwriter-tells-all">is far too generous</a>).</p>

<p>Trump&apos;s sudden appeal to African-American voters seems to too-little, too-late: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161122130015/http://www.politico.com/story/2016/08/trump-campaign-turn-around-out-of-time-227457">as Politico reports today</a>, his recent Hail Mary attempts to escape &quot;the straitjacket that his 14 months of incendiary comments and hard-edged policy positions have him in&quot; is for naught. With Trump polling in the single digits among African-American voters, some Republican strategists say that no amount of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161122130015/http://gothamist.com/2016/08/25/headline_rhetorical.php">&quot;softening&quot;</a> can help Trump overcome his biggest impediment: himself.</p>

<blockquote>&#x201C;Minority outreach is an example of a campaign addressing a fake issue and not a real issue, which is Donald Trump&#x2019;s character,&#x201D; said Drew Cline, a GOP operative in Bedford. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s not about policy or that people like Hillary, because they don&#x2019;t. It&#x2019;s that people aren&#x2019;t comfortable with the idea of him having that much power.

<p>&#x201C;He could have the exact same policies that he has and be doing much better and be giving Hillary a more competitive challenge if he just came across as a reasonable person that you would trust with the levers of power. There&#x2019;s no salvaging this campaign because there&#x2019;s no changing Donald Trump.&#x201D;</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>And in case you think Trump really has turned over a new leaf, one look at his recent tweets says a whole lot more.</p>
