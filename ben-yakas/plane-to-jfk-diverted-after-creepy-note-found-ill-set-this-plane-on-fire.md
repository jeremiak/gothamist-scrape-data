<p>A plane headed from Cairo to JFK was diverted after a passenger found a threatening note reading, &quot;I&apos;ll set this plane on fire.&quot; The EgyptAir jet, carrying 326 people, was escorted by Typhoon fighter jets and set down in Glasgow after the note was found by BBC producer Nada Tawfik&#x2014;who was traveling with her two-year-old daughter&#x2014;in the plane&apos;s toilet. &quot;When I went in to change my daughter about three hours into the flight, I found a note by the sink saying &apos;I&apos;ll set this plane on fire&apos; with the seat number 46 D written on it,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502161712/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2342210/Jet-bound-New-York-diverted-Glasgow-Airport-escorted-fighter-jets-passenger-finds-note-saying-Ill-set-plane-toilet.html">she said.</a></p>

<p>&quot;It almost looked like a child&apos;s handwriting or someone who has very sloppy handwriting, but it was very alarming especially these days when everyone is so concerned about safety on flights,&quot; she <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502161712/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-22920907">told BBC</a>. &quot;I said to one of the stewardesses &apos;I don&apos;t know if this is a prank&apos;, they said no, it can&apos;t be a prank. Either someone has a very bad sense of humour or, you know, it&apos;s very scary.&quot;</p>

<p>She said the mood on the plane quickly turned tense: &quot;Everyone&apos;s trying to grab what they can to drink, people are concerned, there are babies on board who are all getting very frustrated.&quot; No injuries have been reported. </p>
