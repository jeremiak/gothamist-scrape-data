<p>Last night <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170402231810/http://gothamist.com/tags/sethmeyers">Seth Meyers</a> did a fine job breaking down the ongoing intrigue arising from House Intel Committee chairman Devin Nunes&apos;s handling of the investigation into allegations of collusion between Russian officials and the Trump campaign.</p>

<p>&quot;Hanging over everything Trump does is the ongoing Russia investigation, and in the House, the investigation is led by the Republican chairman of the intelligence committee, Devin Nunes,&quot; Meyers said, &quot;who has basically done everything he can to delay or interfere with his own investigation, raising the question of whether he is investigating Trump, or working for Trump.&quot;</p>

<p>As for the latest revelation that two White House officials leaked info to Nunes that he then relayed to Trump, Meyers said, &quot;That means Nunes went to the White House to brief Trump from information he got from the White House. It&apos;s like when you send yourself an email reminder and two minutes later go, &apos;Oh, a new email!&apos;&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170402231810/http://gothamist.com/tags/stephencolbert">Stephen Colbert</a> started out talking about Trump and Nunes as well, before pivoting to Mike Pence and his very strange rules about dining with women. &quot;Let&apos;s take a break from Trump for a moment, can we do that?&quot; he said. &quot;Let&apos;s talk about someone who has no power in Washington: Mike Pence.&quot;</p>

<p>Why does Pence reportedly never allow himself to eat alone with any woman who isn&apos;t his wife, or attend events featuring alcohol without her? &quot;One Amstel Light, and he&apos;s dry humping the bread basket. Oh there&apos;s snow on the roof, but there&apos;s a fire in the furnace,&quot; Colbert said. &quot;He is so naughty, if you left him alone with a bottle of whiskey, he might try to have sex with it. And Jim Beam and Jack Daniels are both dudes, and he&apos;s not into that scene, alright? He has to pray away the Mount Gay.&quot;</p>
