<p>At least 31 people have been killed in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130729120423/http://gothamist.com/tags/subwayfatalities">subway-related incidents</a> so far in 2013&#x2014;but last night, one man was saved from that fate when a fast-thinking train conductor was able to stop an F train before it crushed him. &quot;Had she not miraculously spotted this man unconscious underneath the platform edge, had she not immediately stopped the train, and had she not jumped out and talked him through staying still as he slowly regained consciousness, he&apos;d be dead for sure,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130729120423/https://twitter.com/arodomus">Angel &quot;ARodomus&quot; Rodriguez</a> told us.</p>

<p>Rodriguez, who runs <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130729120423/http://nyctalking.com/">NYCTalking</a>, was on his way home from work at Wall Street early Saturday morning when the Jamaica bound F train he was aboard was held at the Kew Gardens/Union Turnpike station. The conductor announced that the train had been stopped because a man was on the tracks, and Rodriguez described what he saw:</p>

<blockquote>I heard the conductor pleading with the man &quot;Sir, please don&apos;t move, stop moving. You are very close to the live rail and you are going to electrocute yourself. DON&apos;T MOVE PLEASE! Let us get you out, but please for the love of God, stop moving around!&quot;  I guess the man listened to her because she sighed a breath of relief. Eventually the workers reached the man and dragged him out from underneath the train platform.</blockquote>

<p>Rodriguez said the man appeared &quot;dazed, confused and quite disoriented,&quot; was bleeding from a large wound on the side of his head, and could barely communicate with the staff. He wasn&apos;t able to determine whether the man had fallen onto the tracks, whether he jumped in, or whether he was pushed or attacked before the man was taken away by EMTs.</p>

<p>But Rodriguez was adamant that the conductor deserved praise for her actions: &quot;These are the heroes that should make the news!&quot; he said. &quot;Kudos to the train conductor for her amazing actions that saved a life!&quot; </p>
