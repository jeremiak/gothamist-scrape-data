                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="12613pizza.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20140203171826im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/12613pizza.jpeg" width="640" height="480"> <br> <i> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140203171826/http://instagram.com/p/hlPTN_vPm4/">via mrsquinn1118</a></i></div> <p></p>

<p>Lord knows New Yorkers have passionate views <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140203171826/http://gothamist.com/tags/pizza">on pizza</a>; hell, we almost declared <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140203171826/http://gothamist.com/tags/chicago">war on Chicago</a> over cheese preferences. But that doesn&apos;t make it okay to go around living life like a corporeal Yelp review, which is exactly what what dissatisfied customer of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140203171826/http://newparkpizza.com/">New Park Pizza</a> did when they scrawled &quot;worst service ever&quot; on the side of the restaurant.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140203171826/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/vandals-strike-hishtoric-howard-beach-pizzeria-article-1.1539939">According to the News</a>, security cameras captured the man around 4 a.m. this morning vandalizing the front of New Park Pizza in Howard Beach. &#x201C;The owner wasn&#x2019;t happy. She&#x2019;s pissed,&quot; an employee told them. &#x201C;It was a guy but you really can&#x2019;t tell what he looks like. A black jacket is all you can see.&#x201D;</p>

<p>This isn&apos;t the first brush with notoriety for New Park Pizza: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140203171826/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Beach_racial_incident">back in 1986</a>, 23-year-old Michael Griffith and his friends were confronted by a group of white teens outside the pizzeria. The white teens beat them up, and Griffith was fatally struck by a car while running away. </p>

<p>New Park Pizza actually has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140203171826/http://www.yelp.com/biz/new-park-pizzeria-howard-beach">a pretty sterling reputation on Yelp</a>... in terms of food. Lots of people have pointed out the service is a little lacking: &quot;Their customer service could use a shot of energy,&quot; said Andrew E.; &quot;The place can use better customer service,&quot; said Robert L.; &quot;The staff greets with a &apos;what can I get you?&apos; because they literally have no time for customer service, nor do they really need to worry about it...&quot; adds Zach B.<br>
