<p>At this point, there&apos;s no denying that the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160716032807/http://gothamist.com/tags/darthvader">Dark Lord of the Sith</a> sure gets around a bit&#x2014;when he&apos;s not <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160716032807/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/22/darth_vader_robs_bank_photos_oh_yes.php">robbing banks</a>, he&apos;s haggling with cops <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160716032807/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/18/video_darth_vader_haggles_with_cop.php">over parking tickets</a>; when he&apos;s not <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160716032807/http://gothamist.com/2009/12/22/video_darth_vader_rings_opening_bel.php#photo-1">ringing the bell</a> at the Stock Exchange, he&apos;s performing his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160716032807/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/19/video_darth_vader_performs_his_sals.php">Imperial salsa routine</a>. But Sith lords need to get where they need to go sometimes&#x2014;and thus, Darth Vader took to the N Train in Manhattan around 8:30 p.m. last night. And he settled down for a quick power nap next to another snoozing straphanger. </p>

<p>The tipster told us Darth Vader is his coworkers friend, but he wasn&apos;t sure exactly <em>why</em> he donned the costume: &quot;No filming involved, just a random dude in a Vader costume.&quot; Well, as long as it wasn&apos;t another <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160716032807/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/14/princess_leia_meets_darth_vader_on.php#photo-1">Improv Everywhere stunt</a>. What would you do if you came face to face with such a character on the subway? Would you ask to take photos, or would you sit there unimpressed like the man on the upper right of the left photo? New Yorkers: what can&apos;t they ignore?!</p>
