Manager Valentino Ventura <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141108000352/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/23/chinatown_fair_officially_closed.php">told us</a> that the rumors were just that, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141108000352/http://twitter.com/Newyorkist/status/41753478774784000">Newyorkist</a> sent us a tip that he &quot;spoke to Samuel, proprietor of Chinatown Arcade,&quot; and the arcade was indeed closing tonight. And it&apos;s now been confirmed: &quot;<strong>This location is permanently gone, unless something happens, which I don&apos;t know. As far as the landlord is concerned, we&apos;re finished with this location</strong>,&quot; CF assistant manager Ben Palmer told us this morning.</p>

<p>He added that they were hoping to find a new location and re-open at a later date. In a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141108000352/http://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=135960633138098&amp;id=100001724875955">Facebook post</a>, Ventura posited that CF &quot;may be relocating to Williamsburg, Brooklyn if disputes with the landlord are not settled.&quot; He also added that &quot;CF IS NOT CLOSING. sam, benny and myself genuinely love our customers (including the smelly ones) and this business.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141108000352/http://www.boweryboogie.com/2011/02/breaking-chinatown-fair-arcade-shutters/">Bowery Boogie</a> stopped by at CF last night, and witnessed the last call; they even have sad pictures of the dismantling of the Street Fighter machine.
