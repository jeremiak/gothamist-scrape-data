<p>In the summer of 2015, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170111040610/http://gothamist.com/tags/hanksy">Hanksy</a> unveiled an instant classic mural of then-Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. As <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170111040610/http://gothamist.com/2015/08/28/trumpe_loeil.php">we noted at the time</a>, &quot;Dump Trump&quot; was a monument to the man&apos;s inner spirit, a monument which we were sure would stand the test of time. Unfortunately, as with so many other <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170111040610/http://gothamist.com/tags/hillaryclinton">surefire things</a>, we were wrong.</p>

<p>The mural, located on Orchard Street on the Lower East Side, was erased today by the building&#x2019;s owners. </p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="82815trump1.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170111040610im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/82815trump1.jpg" width="640" height="480"> <br> <i> &quot;Dump Trump&quot; during better times (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170111040610/https://twitter.com/HanksyNYC/status/636637543837122560">Hanksy</a>)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>The move evidently caught Hanksy off-guard as well. &quot;It was a shit mural anyways,&quot; Hanksy told us, noting that he doesn&apos;t blame the owners for erasing it. &quot;However if anyone has a nice giant wall (preferably in direct view of 725 5th Ave), I&#x2019;d be happy to paint it again.&quot; You can see one more pic of the barren location, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170111040610/http://www.boweryboogie.com/2017/01/hanksys-dump-trump-mural-orchard-street-just-erased/?utm_content=bufferb5955&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer">via Bowery Boogie</a>, below.</p>

<p>Hanksy also brought the image to the streets, with Dump Trump marches <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170111040610/http://gothamist.com/tags/dumptrump">last year</a>, and you can&apos;t buff those.</p>
