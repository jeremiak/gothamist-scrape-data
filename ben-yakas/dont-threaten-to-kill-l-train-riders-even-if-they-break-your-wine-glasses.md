<p>Here&apos;s a lesson to all those <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604104214/http://gothamist.com/tags/subwayetiquette">subway etiquette</a> rule breakers out there: it&apos;s bad enough that you hog seats with your bags (see above) and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604104214/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/15/etiquette.php">your bananas</a>. But if you then put up a hissy fit when people ask you to move them during rush hour on the L train on Friday, you will end up publicly shamed. &quot;She did eventually move the bags,&quot; tipster Elizabeth told us, &quot;but before she did she rolled her eyes and said, <strong>&apos;These are very expensive wine glasses and if they break I&apos;m killing everyone.&apos;</strong>&quot; Andy from <em>Wet Hot American Summer</em> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604104214/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND7yJ7sMosk">would be very proud.</a></p>
