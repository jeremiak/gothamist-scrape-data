<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none" style=" width:640px; "> <img alt="122211orlando.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120113063036im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/122211orlando.jpeg" width="640" height="425"> <br> <i>The Wizarding World Of Harry Potter <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120113063036/http://imajinkgraphics.com/blog/tag/orlando/">(via)</a></i></div> <p></p>

<p>According to the city&apos;s official tourism arm, NYC &amp; Company, an estimated 50 million tourists <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120113063036/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/20/record_50_million_tourists_will_hav.php">will have visited NYC by the year&apos;s end</a>, making NYC the number one domestic and overseas destination for tourist spending in the United States. But Orlando begs to differ on the domestic front: &quot;Orlando is the No. 1 destination&quot; in the USA, Visit Orlando corporate communications director Brian Martin <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120113063036/http://travel.usatoday.com/destinations/dispatches/post/2011/12/orlando-to-nyc-youre-not-the-top-us-tourist-destination/590317/1">told USA Today</a>. Oh, isn&apos;t that the city whose major superstar loves it so much, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120113063036/http://gothamist.com/tags/dwighthoward">he requested a trade to beautiful New Jersey</a>?</p>

<p>Martin claims that theme park mecca Orlando matched NYC&apos;s tourist total count last year, and is expected to surpass it this year. &quot;We announced last year we broke the 50 million mark,&quot; said Martin, adding that the metro Orlando area, which includes Orange, Osceola and Seminole counties, expects 53.37 million visitors from 50 miles away or farther. </p>

<p>NYC &amp; Company cries foul, arguing that Orlando&apos;s count isn&apos;t comparable because it includes such a vast area, whereas New York tourism stats come from the city&apos;s five boroughs alone&#x2014;it would be as if we counted Westchester and Rockland County amongst our tourism stats (assuming people were actually visiting those places).</p>

<p>When it comes to international visitors, NYC is still top of the heap, attracting an estimate 10 million tourists this year vs. about 4 million for Orlando. And none of these tourists are staying very long: Orlando was ranked in the top ten worst cities for job markets <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120113063036/http://www.forbes.com/2011/01/06/best-and-worst-places-for-jobs-business-beltway.html">by Forbes</a>, and was ranked number one worst city to be young in right now <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120113063036/http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2011/10/20/worst-cities-for-young-people-from-seattle-to-cincinnati-photos.seattle.html">by The Daily Beast</a>. So perhaps they should consider changing their tourism slogan from,  &quot;Built For Families. Made For Memories,&quot; to &quot;Built For The Wizarding World of Harry Potter. Made For Unemployment Lines.&quot;</p>
