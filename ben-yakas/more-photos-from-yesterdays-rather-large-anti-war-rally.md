<p>Yesterday, thousands of people gathered at Union Square for an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170423184828/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/09/todays_peace_rally_against_endless.php#photo-1">anti-war rally</a> organized by the United National Antiwar Committee, the Muslim Peace Coalition, and many other peace groups. The rally&apos;s official name <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170423184828/http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=121795514561849">was</a>: &quot;United National Antiwar Demonstration: Bring the Troops Home Now!&quot; Protesters walked down Broadway to Foley Square carrying colorful signs protesting various ongoing crises and issues in American foreign policy, everything from Islamaphobia to the military actions in Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan. </p>

<p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s costing $100 million a day. In the meantime, we are being told that there is no money for badly needed social programs. We don&#x2019;t want war. We want more jobs,&#x201D; Tom Murphy from Brooklyn <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170423184828/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2011/04/09/thousands-gather-at-union-square-to-voice-concerns-against-wars/">told CBS</a>. Other protesters and featured speakers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170423184828/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local/new_york&amp;id=8063137">echoed</a> this sentiment, arguing that if the U.S. would pull out of the wars it&apos;s involved in, the government wouldn&apos;t need to cut spending on programs such as Medicare, Head Start and Medicaid. You can see more tweet pics of the rally <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170423184828/http://twitpic.com/photos/unemployedarmy">here</a>. We do have one question we&apos;re wondering: is there a difference between a peace rally and an anti-war rally?</p>
