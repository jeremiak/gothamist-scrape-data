Gibbons, who was appointed under Giuliani, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150304124951/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/08/26/2010-08-26_courthouse_mystery_criminal_court_judge_james_d_gibbons_abruptly_resigns_without.html">resigned abruptly</a> on Aug. 17. Today, the circumstances around the resignation were revealed: Gibbons had a possibly conflict-ridden relationship with a female Legal Aid attorney, who he had a child with. Then in the course of that inquiry, investigators discovered pornography on his work computer.<p></p>

<p>Gibbons worked as a city prosecutor for 14 years under DA Robert Morgenthau, and was appointed to the Brooklyn bench in December 2001, moving to Manhattan Criminal Court in 2003. Gibbons presided over several high profile cases, including the prosecution of cleaver-wielding <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150304124951/http://gothamist.com/tags/davidtarloff">David Tarloff</a>, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150304124951/http://gothamist.com/2006/11/16/naomi_wants_to.php">Naomi Campbell</a>, for whom Gibbons nearly issued a bench warrant when she missed a court date in 2006.</p>

<p>The Gibbons investigation began after rumors started circling about his extra-curricular activities socializing with Legal Aid lawyers. The Post&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150304124951/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan_judge_probed_after_porn_j2hl2uA1wStI3XOb0GqSwK">source said</a>: &quot;They were interested in him because he was spending a lot of time hanging out drinking with them...<strong>It was only after one of them got pregnant, and it came out that he was the father, that they began investigating him for possibly not recusing himself</strong>,&quot; in cases where the girlfriend may have stood before his bench. &quot;Then Bam! They come across pornography.&quot;</p>
