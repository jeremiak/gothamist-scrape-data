<p>While <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170621050918/http://gothamist.com/2017/02/23/video_stephen_colbert_alex_jones.php">Stephen Colbert was focused</a> on Trump&apos;s predilection for keeping conspiracy theorist nuts as advisers, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170621050918/http://gothamist.com/tags/sethmeyers">Seth Meyers</a> turned to Trump&apos;s newly-revised immigration ban and plans for his &quot;beautiful&quot; wall, so eloquently expressed by his most noxious surrogates: &quot;So Trump wants to spend as much as $20 billion on a wall that even some Republicans think won&apos;t work, but don&apos;t worry, Trump adviser Stephen Miller said there&apos;s no need to worry about who will pay for the wall,&quot; Meyers said before showing a clip of Miller saying the wall will &quot;pay for itself many, many, many times over.&quot;</p>

<p>Meyers pointed out that more Mexicans are currently leaving than coming to the U.S., resulting in a net loss of 140,000 people between 2009 and 2014. &quot;That&apos;s right, America has turned into a bad movie and people are walking out,&quot; Meyers said. &quot;&apos;I&apos;ll catch this garbage when it&apos;s on TNT.&apos;&quot;</p>

<p>Watch as Meyers takes Trump to task for his new immigration policy: &quot;Look, these immigration policies are cruel, unnecessary and ineffective. Even many Republicans think so. Those Republicans and Democrats should stand up to Trump.&quot;</p>
