<p>Because they can&apos;t go one year without a headline-grabbing quarterback controversy, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406143457/http://gothamist.com/tags/jets">Jets</a> released Mark Sanchez and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406143457/http://gothamist.com/2014/03/21/ny_jets_sign_michael_vick_release_m.php">signed Michael Vick</a> to a one-year, $5 million deal late on Friday. While Geno Smith, the man Vick will be competing against for the starting QB job, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406143457/http://espn.go.com/new-york/nfl/story/_/id/10656040/new-york-jets-geno-smith-eager-work-michael-vick">is psyched Vick is here</a>, a lot of Jets fans have taken to social media to voice their displeasure. &quot;Jets fans, football fans, and sports fans want nothing to do with criminals who abuse animals,&quot; wrote Alan Kessler on his new Facebook page, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406143457/https://www.facebook.com/BoycottNYJetsAndMichaelVick?ref=nf">&quot;Boycott the NY Jets &amp; Michael Vick.&quot;</a></p>

<p>&#x201C;I was a proud New York Jets fan, always have been, but this was an easy decision,&#x201D; Kessler, 46, a Long Island cop, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406143457/http://nypost.com/2014/03/23/jets-fans-trash-new-quarterback-michael-vick/">told the Post</a>. &quot;Michael Vick has no place in football. He disgusts me.&quot; The page has gotten almost 5K likes in about two days, generating 13 posts in that time. People have been just as angry on the Jets Twitter and Facebook pages. <br>
&quot;He electrocuted dogs in a bathtub for fun. I&#x2019;m supposed to root for this guy?&quot; wrote Ryan Breslin on the Jets&#x2019; Facebook page. &quot;As ashamed as I&#x2019;ve ever been to be a Jets fan and that&#x2019;s saying something.&quot;</p>

<p>Take a look at the top six comments on the Jets&apos; Facebook announcement:</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="32314jets1.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406143457im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/32314jets1.jpg" width="640" height="480"> <br> <i> Screenshot</i></div> <p></p>

<p>&quot;If they sign Michael Vick, I&apos;m not watching any games he plays in, and maybe none while he&apos;s even on the roster,&quot; said Jay Wilkins, a Jets superfan who pulls out Jets gear (including a fleece blanket) on gameday. &quot;Still considering that. It&apos;s only partly about the dog torture. It&apos;s also about just stupid, desperate, tone-deaf decision making. (I&apos;ll still follow pre- and post-game coverage, cos it&apos;s a sickness.)&quot;</p>

<p>From a practical standpoint, Wikins adds that Vick &quot;gets hurt all the time and doesn&apos;t usually play a full season anyway. And is he the kind of role model&#x2014;on and off the field&#x2014;you&apos;d want for Geno Smith?&quot; Fellow Jets fanatic John Maceda says he&apos;ll still follow the team, but he isn&apos;t thrilled about Vick: &quot;If I had my way they&apos;d just keep Sanchez for another year, if all this boils down to is having a competitive back up,&quot; he told us, &quot;because the &apos;circus&apos; thing about the Jets the media always wants to jump all over is going to be a factor if they sign Vick.&quot;</p>

<p>PETA has also expressed their disappointment with the Jets: &quot;Michael Vick can&#x2019;t make a football cower and shake, and he can&#x2019;t drown, electrocute, hang, or shoot it&#x2014;so that&#x2019;s the good news. But no decent human being would be able to hold his or her head up in public after doing all that to &apos;man&#x2019;s best friend.&apos;&quot; Vick&apos;s brother Marcus <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406143457/https://twitter.com/MVFive/status/447461092969971712">responded to them</a> on Twitter:<strong> &quot;Y&#x2019;all still on that bulls-t???? Smh #Peta.&quot;</strong></p>
