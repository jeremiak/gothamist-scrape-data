<p>Last week, David Letterman made a surprise announcement that he is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509173224/http://gothamist.com/2014/04/03/david_letterman_retiring.php">planning to retire</a> from <em>The Late Show</em> in 2015. Almost immediately, people began speculating about who could possibly replace him, with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509173224/http://gothamist.com/tags/stephencolbert">Stephen Colbert</a> quickly emerging as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509173224/http://gothamist.com/2014/04/04/cbs_reportedly_wants_stephen_colber.php">CBS&apos; first choice</a>. Today, they&apos;ve made it official: Colbert will succeed Letterman as the host of <em>The Late Show</em>. Congratulations to everyone who supported #CancelColbert!</p>

<p>Here&apos;s Comedy Central&apos;s statement on the deal:</p>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Comedy Central says: &quot;We look forward to the next eight months of the ground-breaking Colbert Report and wish Stephen the very best.&quot;</p>&#x2014; Brian Stelter (@brianstelter) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509173224/https://twitter.com/brianstelter/statuses/454293369510821888">April 10, 2014</a></blockquote>

<p>Nikki Finke was the first person to claim Colbert was up for the job, about 20 minutes after the Letterman announcement last Thursday:</p>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Letterman&apos;s 2015 retirement: My sources have said first in line to replace him is Stephen Colbert. Will it happen?</p>&#x2014; Nikki Finke (@NikkiFinke) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509173224/https://twitter.com/NikkiFinke/statuses/451827157023457280">April 3, 2014</a></blockquote>

<p>Bill Carter, late night chronicler, threw in a &quot;told ya so&quot; today as well:</p>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Don&apos;t use phrase told-ya-so, but I did recommend anyone w extra cash laying it all on stephen colbert-he was the logical choice from start.</p>&#x2014; Bill Carter (@wjcarter) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509173224/https://twitter.com/wjcarter/statuses/454290999552929792">April 10, 2014</a></blockquote>

<blockquote>Colbert would leave behind the pseudo-conservative persona he&apos;s cultivated at The Colbert Report and just be himself at his CBS home, one of the individuals told Mashable. He has stepped out of character on rare occasion, though not on his show, and possesses the same wry, incisive interview skills that Letterman has showcased for decades.</blockquote>

<p>Jon Stewart <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509173224/http://www.vulture.com/2014/04/jon-stewart-wants-stephen-colbert-for-letterman.html">told Vulture</a> earlier today that he doesn&apos;t think that&apos;d be a problem for Colbert, who cut his teeth with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509173224/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2R1ClT3Ef_Y">improv at Second City</a> and in shows like <em>Strangers With Candy</em>: &quot;He&#x2019;s done an amazing job with just that very narrow cast of character, but he&#x2019;s got a lot more he can show,&quot; Stewart told them. &quot;He&#x2019;s got some skill sets that are really applicable, interviewing-wise, but also he&#x2019;s a really, really good actor and also an excellent improvisational comedian. He&#x2019;s also got great writing skills. He&#x2019;s got a lot of the different capacities. Being able to expand upon [those] would be exciting.&quot;</p>

<p>As for the other possible candidates, <em>Late Late Show</em> host Craig Ferguson <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509173224/http://nypost.com/2014/04/04/craig-ferguson-will-make-a-killing-off-david-lettermans-empty-chair/">will get $5 million</a> for being passed over, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509173224/http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv-movies/letterman-replacements-form-long-line-article-1.1748729">there&apos;s been rumors</a> that Chelsea Handler may be brought in to take over for him helm that show after Colbert.</p>

<p>It&apos;s unclear as of now whether this deal means Billy Eichner is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509173224/https://twitter.com/billyeichner/statuses/452192788549861376">legally mandated to takeover hosting duties of <em>Reading Rainbow</em>,</a> but we do hope so.

<p>You can read the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509173224/http://www.cbspressexpress.com/cbs-entertainment/releases/view?id=38627">full statement</a> about the <em>Late Show</em> shift below:</p>

<blockquote>The CBS Television Network today announced that Stephen Colbert, the host, writer and executive producer of the Emmy and Peabody Award-winning &#x201C;The Colbert Report,&#x201D; will succeed David Letterman as the host of THE LATE SHOW, effective when Mr. Letterman retires from the broadcast. The five-year agreement between CBS and Colbert was announced by Leslie Moonves, President and CEO, CBS Corporation, and Nina Tassler, Chairman of CBS Entertainment.

<p>Letterman, the legendary, critically acclaimed host of the CBS late night series for 21 years, announced his retirement on his April 3 broadcast. Colbert&#x2019;s premiere date as host of THE LATE SHOW will be announced after Mr. Lettermen determines a timetable for his final broadcasts in 2015.</p>

<p>Specific creative elements, as well as the producers and the location for the Colbert-hosted LATE SHOW, will be determined and announced at a later date.</p>

<p>&#x201C;Stephen Colbert is one of the most inventive and respected forces on television,&#x201D; said Moonves. &#x201C;David Letterman&#x2019;s legacy and accomplishments are an incredible source of pride for all of us here, and today&#x2019;s announcement speaks to our commitment of upholding what he established for CBS in late night.&#x201D;</p>

<p>&#x201C;Stephen is a multi-talented and respected host, writer, producer, satirist and comedian who blazes a trail of thought-provoking conversation, humor and innovation with everything he touches,&#x201D; said Tassler. &#x201D;He is a presence on every stage, with interests and notable accomplishments across a wide spectrum of entertainment, politics, publishing and music. We welcome Stephen to CBS with great pride and excitement, and look forward to introducing him to our network television viewers in late night.&#x201D;</p>

<p>&#x201C;Simply being a guest on David Letterman&#x2019;s show has been a highlight of my career,&#x201D; said Colbert. &#x201C;I never dreamed that I would follow in his footsteps, though everyone in late night follows Dave&#x2019;s lead.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Adding, &#x201C;I&#x2019;m thrilled and grateful that CBS chose me. Now, if you&#x2019;ll excuse me, I have to go grind a gap in my front teeth.&#x201D;</p></blockquote><p></p>
