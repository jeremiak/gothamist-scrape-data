                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="102513philly.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20140205200442im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/102513philly.jpeg" width="640" height="425" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>There are a couple important things to keep in mind whenever you visit <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140205200442/http://gothamist.com/tags/philadelphia">the sixth borough</a>: don&apos;t say hi to strangers, don&apos;t compare fatal shootings to <em>Breaking Bad</em>, and always, ALWAYS, be referencing <em>Rocky</em>. One Philly man fulfilled his duty on that last one by pulling a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140205200442/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NubH5BDOaD8">&apos;reverse Rocky&apos;</a> and backing his convertible down the steps of the Philadelphia Art Museum late last night.</p>

<p>&quot;Holy crap a guy just drove his car down the art museum steps and I have the (expletive) video. I was just driving by and see it. Omg,&quot; wrote Hugh E Dillon, who took the video above. Dillon <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140205200442/http://www.philly.com/philly/news/Convertible_car_drives_down_Art_Museum_steps.html">told Philly.com</a> that at least five other cars and eight people were hanging out watching the festivities: &quot;He was so deliberate in every single step. And then he went down backwards. It&#x2019;s difficult to do. When he got to the halfway point, he did a victory lap.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;When he got to the bottom, he did another victory lap, then drove off,&quot; Dillon added.&quot; &quot;He was smiling broadly. He was so happy with himself.&quot; That&apos;s exactly how I felt when I pulled a &apos;reverse Woody Allen&apos; and married my mother.</p>
