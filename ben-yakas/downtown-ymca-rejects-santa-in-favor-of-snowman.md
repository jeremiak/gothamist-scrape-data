<p>The War on Christmas isn&apos;t just being waged <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406160156/http://gothamist.com/2010/11/28/athiest_billboard_calls_nativity_a.php">outside the Lincoln Tunnel</a>; it&apos;s taking place at the YMCA (oops, we mean, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406160156/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/12/ymca_dropping_the_mca.php">The Y</a>) now as well. According <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406160156/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/ymca_insanity_claus_LW3H3WnTznXaNub65w6XzM">to the Post</a>, the 14th Street McBurney YMCA has kicked Santa Claus to the curb for their popular annual holiday luncheon, and instead turned to the religiously ambiguous duo of a a talking snowman and his sidekick, an anonymous penguin, to entertain kids.</p>

<p>But just as used cars are now pre-owned cars, executive director of the McBurney YMCA  defended the decision to not use Santa Claus anymore with the finest doublespeak in the land: &quot;It wasn&apos;t replacing; it was transitioning. We realized that change is sometimes good, and that Frosty is a great winter character who would appeal to a broader number of kids,&quot; said John Rappaport. </p>

<p>The decision enraged Bill Donohue of the Catholic League: &quot;Christmas is not about Jack Frost; it&apos;s not about snowmen. We&apos;re not talking about some secular organization that has no religious roots. <strong>If they can&apos;t celebrate Christmas, then they should check out. What a bunch of cowards.&quot;</strong> And in a true Christmas miracle, the obviously pro-Santa Post even found a Jewish man to come to Santa&apos;s defense: &quot;Santa belongs to all the people. He represents openness and an invitation for anyone and everyone to celebrate good will toward man,&quot; said Ed Bobrow, who has played Santa at Central Park&apos;s Belvedere Castle for years.</p>
