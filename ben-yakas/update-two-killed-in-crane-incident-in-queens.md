<p>Two people were killed today after a possible crane collapse in Queens. (Details are still emerging; we will update with new information as we get it.)</p>

<p>The incident happened around 12:10 p.m. at a building at 81-10 134th Street in Briarwood. The FDNY tells us that a beam struck a crane there, and confirmed that two people, likely construction workers, were killed at the scene. </p>

We put our lives on the line every day to feed our family. This is what we do,&#x201D; a worker at the site <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161124080549/http://nypost.com/2016/11/22/workers-killed-after-beam-crashes-on-crane/">told the NY Post.</a></p>

<p><strong>Update 2:10 p.m.</strong>: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161124080549/http://nypost.com/2016/11/22/workers-killed-after-beam-crashes-on-crane/">The Post</a> is now reporting that the wire on a beam snapped and fell on top of a crane that was operating, causing the two deaths. While the Post implies that high winds caused the incident, PIX11 says it was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161124080549/https://twitter.com/nikreport/status/801130889816276997">&quot;equipment failure.&quot;</a> </p>

<p>Witness Joe Musso told the Post, &quot;The crane was picking up the beams to bring them to where they were supposed to be. The wire snapped and fell on two guys. They were crushed by the beams.&quot;</p>
