<p>Everyone knows that Mayor Bloomberg loves Police Commissioner Ray Kelly something fierce&#x2014;he&apos;ll go out of his way <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130429123701/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/16/testy_mayor_bloomberg_wont_apologiz.php">to compliment</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130429123701/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/18/bloomberg_continues_tone-deaf_suppo.php">commend</a> Kelly on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130429123701/http://gothamist.com/tags/stopandfrisk">stop-and-frisk</a>, even when Kelly himself <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130429123701/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/17/stop_and_frisk_2.php">is critical of it</a>. But Bloomberg doesn&apos;t just think Kelly is a swell guy with a Popeye grin&#x2014;he&apos;s the greatest god damn police officer since <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130429123701/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kojak">Kojak.</a> &#x201C;No one has done more to improve community and police relations than Ray Kelly,&#x201D; Bloomberg said <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130429123701/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/mayor-bloomberg-touts-ray-kelly-best-police-commish-article-1.1114459">on his weekly radio show</a>. &quot;[Kelly] is the best police commissioner the city has ever had.&#x201D;</p>

<p>&#x201C;I sympathize with Ray&#x2019;s frustration. You know, everything the police do is wrong to certain groups of people,&#x201D; Bloomberg said of police criticism. He pointed to the city&apos;s consistently low murder rate as one of Kelly&apos;s chief achievements: &#x201C;We used to be one of the murder capitals of the United States and we just are not going back&#x2014;at least not while I am here.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Not everyone is as over the moon with Kelly and the NYPD as Bloomberg: more than 80 people have been shot over the past week alone, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130429123701/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local/new_york&amp;id=8736558">Rev. Al Sharpton wants</a> Kelly to sit down for a summit with concerned community leaders. &quot;There clearly is a need for a new collective strategy,&quot; he said. &quot;If stop and frisk was working we wouldn&apos;t have had the shootings, so y&apos;all are not getting the guns.&quot;</p>

<p>State Sen. Eric Adams of Brooklyn has also been an outspoken critic, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130429123701/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/11/ray_kelly_community_leaders_care_mo.php">previously claiming</a> Kelly &quot;is using racial undertones to divide this city on who has a passion to deal with the issues of crime.&quot; Adams challenged him to tour the &quot;gritty neighborhoods in his district&quot; without a gun or security detail&#x2014;to that, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130429123701/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/kelly_ve_walked_the_walk_FETEEUkk9OeeWih3yYjWiI">Kelly replied</a>, &#x201C;I&#x2019;ve walked a lot of streets.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Anyway, Kelly is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130429123701/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/rev_al_to_cops_let_talk_guns_0K6ChvgCevKNkQdWcTBfzI#ixzz20hTHg93y">down for a summit</a>, &quot;We&#x2019;ve worked with Reverend Sharpton in the past . . . and look forward to doing so again.&quot;</p>
