<p>Street artist <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150827025859/http://gothamist.com/tags/JudithSupine">Judith Supine</a> will unveil a new solo show, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150827025859/http://www.meckagallery.com/blogs/news/13080805-judith-supines-golden-child-exhibition">Golden Child Exhibition</a>, tonight at Mecka Gallery in East Williamsburg. But if you can&apos;t make it there, you can always climb the Queensboro Bridge to get a taste of his work.  </p>

<p>As you can see in the video above, Supine climbed to the top of the bridge to install one of his Golden Child pieces. It&apos;s pretty impressive that he was able to get up there in this era of heightened security, although perhaps it shouldn&apos;t be that surprising, considering everything that&apos;s been going on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150827025859/http://gothamist.com/tags/1wtc">at One World Trade Center</a> recently.</p>

<p>This is far from the first time Supine has taken over a major NYC landmark in the name of art: he&apos;s previously placed works on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150827025859/http://gothamist.com/2007/08/05/judith_supine_t.php">Manhattan Bridge</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150827025859/http://gothamist.com/2009/05/14/supine_takes_a_dip_in_central_park.php">Central Park</a> and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150827025859/http://gothamist.com/2009/08/24/williamsburg_bridge.php">top of the Williamsburg Bridge.</a> &quot;What I like about street art is when it&#x2019;s kind of transgressive and illegal and you get to do shit wherever you want without having to ask for permission,&quot; the artist <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150827025859/http://www.animalnewyork.com/2014/street-artist-judith-supine-shows-face/">told AnimalNY.</a></p>
