<p>Are you looking for someone to share some HOT matzah ball soup? Someone to GRIND up against at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150215220500/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/09/barbra_streisand_will_perform_at_ba.php">Barbra Streisand&apos;s Barclays Center concert</a>? Someone to KVETCH with about the presidential debates? Well you&apos;re in luck, because there&apos;s now an app specifically for single Jews on the prowl: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150215220500/http://itunes.apple.com/tr/app/yenta/id553839532?mt=8">Yenta,</a> the Jewish <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150215220500/http://gothamist.com/tags/grindr">Grindr.</a></p>

<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150215220500if_/http://www.youtube.com/embed/Y51UgoPg6Qc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>Of course, the creators of the app have a much more innocent view of how they imagine their app will be used: &#x201C;You can walk into a coffee shop and you can find out who&#x2019;s Jewish and single around you,&#x201D; creator Luba Tolkachyov <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150215220500/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/app_finds_you_jew_xYMnvEGV2LYcRd8nLwphQP">told the Post</a>. &#x201C;JDate is kind of the traditional model. To be able to log on to [Yenta], you have to go out. There&#x2019;s no need for the lengthy profile&#x2014;now we can see who&#x2019;s single and near us.&#x201D; </p>

<p>Yeah, it&apos;s a little corny. The free app basically only asks you two questions: &#x201C;what&#x2019;s your shtick?&#x201D; and &#x201C;what will impress my mother?&#x201D; We&apos;re talking about a product whose description ends, &quot;All we ask is that you share Yenta with your single Jewish friends if you think it can help them find their JewBoo.&quot; There are only about a thousand members in NYC signed up right now, but considering it&apos;s free and easy to use, we&apos;d be shocked if that number didn&apos;t go up soon&#x2014;and hey, if it happens to encourage anyone to get unkosher and roll around in the proverbial bacon, that&apos;s all the better.</p>
