<p>Going into <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121224171541/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/12/malarkey_unleashed_at_vp_debate_bid.php">last night&apos;s debate</a>, expectations <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121224171541/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/11/three_reasons_to_skip_tonights_vp_d.php">were not exactly sky high</a> for a vice presidential debate between a perpetual gaffe machine and a P90X enthusiast&#x2014;best case scenario, we might get a little taste of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121224171541/http://www.theonion.com/articles/shirtless-biden-washes-trans-am-in-white-house-dri,2718/">The Onion&apos;s essential Uncle Joe Biden.</a> The debate turned out to be surprisingly meaty and watchable, which led <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121224171541/http://www.buzzfeed.com/rosiegray/onion-joe-biden-is-on-vacation">some to declare</a> that The Onion&apos;s &quot;goofy&quot; Biden stereotype was dead. And yet, thanks to his incredibly charismatic and/or bullying performance, Biden groupies have bandied together to make Onion Joe Biden come to life...<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121224171541/http://www.indiegogo.com/BidensTransAm?c=home&amp;a=1613164">by raising money to buy the real Joe Biden his very own TransAm.</a></p>

<p>&quot;In order to let Vice President Biden know just how much we appreciate him, while also making a very silly part of the internet come true (we are the internet after all); let&apos;s buy Uncle Joe a Trans Am like the one that is featured <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121224171541/http://www.theonion.com/articles/shirtless-biden-washes-trans-am-in-white-house-dri,2718/?ref=auto">in the Onion article,</a>&quot; they wrote on the Indiegogo page for &quot;Buy Vice President Biden a TransAm.&quot; They&apos;ve already raised over $2K of the $25K they need&#x2014;even though Biden loves his Onion spoof, they figure he may not be able to accept the car, because of &quot;these pesky laws and regulations and political-y things to deal with.&quot; In that case, they&apos;re still planning on buying the car and donating it to charity. </p>

<p>In that generous spirit, we&apos;ve compiled some of our favorite memes and links that sprouted from yesterday&apos;s debate:</p>
