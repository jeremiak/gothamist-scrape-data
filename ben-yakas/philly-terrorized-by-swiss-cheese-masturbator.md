<p>We&apos;re always happy when we check in on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150103084155/http://gothamist.com/tags/philadelphia">Philadelphia</a> and find there are delightful things going on involving <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150103084155/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/25/video_philly_driver_pulls_reverse_r.php">reverse Rocky</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150103084155/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/20/nyc-bound_train_takes_wrong_turn_en.php">wayward trains</a>. But it seems citizens of our honorary sixth borough are currently living in terror of a local man who has been approaching women and asking them to put a slice of swiss cheese on his penis and perform sexual acts on him. Could this be a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150103084155/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/27/an_inordinate_amount_of_columbia_st.php">wayward former Columbia student</a>? </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150103084155/http://www.philly.com/philly/news/20140112__Swiss_cheese_pervert__terrorizes_Mayfair.html">According to the Philadelphia Daily News</a>, the Mayfair Town Watch is warning residents to watch out for the &quot;Swiss Cheese Pervert,&quot; a heavyset white man estimated to be in his late 40s or early 50s. The fromage-friendly perp drives around in a sedan with his genitals exposed, displays the cheese, and asks women to take care of both.</p>

<p>Police confirmed that several women have complained about the suspect. &quot;I understand that people may think this is funny, but this is no laughing matter,&quot; said Milt Martelack, the town watch&apos;s senior adviser. &quot;We&apos;ve had a couple individuals reach out to us. We&apos;re taking this matter very seriously, and we&apos;re working vigorously with police to get this guy off the streets.&quot;</p>

<p>Gabby Chest claims she had an encounter with the Swiss Cheese Pervert in 2012, when a &quot;really strange guy&quot; messaged her on OKCupid with a very specific request: &quot;He said he was looking for someone to perform masturbation on him with cheese,&quot; Chest said. &quot;He kept saying how strong his urges were and how desperate he was to find someone to help him with them.&quot;</p>

<p>Here&apos;s an excerpt from his message to her, which could serve as his manifesto:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;I started to compare girls to cheese due to their milky complections [sic], girls are soft, smooth feeling and tend to like dairy products more,&quot; he wrote.

<p>&quot;That and typical advertising, always using a girl to advertise dairy products. So cheese is what I started to use as a replacement for having sex with girls.&quot;</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>Apparently, he&apos;s since <em>evolved</em> in his tastes. Cheese may be too delicious <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150103084155/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/19/cheese_the_most_stolen_food_on_the.php">not to steal</a>, but this is a far cry from our usual encounters with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150103084155/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/11/subway_cheese.php">cheese connoisseurs</a>. Let&apos;s just hope this guy doesn&apos;t discover the pleasures of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150103084155/http://gothamist.com/tags/breastmilkcheese">breast milk cheese</a> anytime soon.</p>
