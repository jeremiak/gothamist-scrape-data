<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170717002323/http://gothamist.com/tags/samanthabee">Samantha Bee</a> returned to <em>Full Frontal</em> after a few weeks off to find plenty of news to cover, including Trump&apos;s nine-day international trip (which Bee compared to <em>Max Max: Fury Road</em>) and the controversy swirling around Jared Kushner: &quot;We can&apos;t assume Jared knowingly broke the law, it&apos;s possible that the Russians planted this story to screw with us,&quot; she said. &quot;It&apos;s also possible that the person POTUS trusts with negotiating Mideast peace, reforming the criminal justice system, solving the opioid epidemic, advising the Commander in Chief, and reinventing the entire government is just a complete f*cking idiot! How comforting.&quot;</p>

<p>But before she got into all that, she had to address the covfefe-sized elephant in the room and the &quot;unfettered rapture&quot; with which Trump&apos;s nonsensical tweet was received. &quot;For that glorious interlude between midnight and 5 a.m., we were like passengers on the Titanic who decided to say, &apos;F*ck it!&apos; and rock out to the band,&quot; she said. She also offered her own explanation for the word: &quot;This is what happens when you&apos;ve abstained from your phone for nine days: you ejaculate, just like that! &apos;Nghhh...covfefe!&apos;&quot;</p>

<p>Bee also got into the &quot;toxic testosterone&quot; fueling the special election in Montana, in which GOP candidate Greg Gianforte body slammed a reporter for asking questions about Trumpcare. &quot;Jesus Greg, a body slam? If you don&apos;t want to answer questions about Trump&apos;s agenda, just hide in the bushes like Sean Spicer!&quot;</p>
