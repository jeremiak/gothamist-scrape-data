<p>With a heavy heart, we regret to inform you of some very sad news: Minnie the Second, the latest in a long line of cats that have lived at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150402081105/http://gothamist.com/tags/mcsorleys">McSorley&apos;s Old Ale House</a> going back to 1854, has been banned from the East Village institution! The DOH has been coming down hard on McSorley&apos;s, making them clean up the bar&apos;s famous wishbones, as well as barring the adorable Minnie. EV Grieve <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150402081105/http://evgrieve.com/2011/04/city-makes-mcsorleys-wipe-away-100.html">spoke with</a> the cat via her <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150402081105/http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100001747312106">Facebook account</a>, and she delicately explained the situation: &quot;<strong>I explained that [owner] Mr. Maher has said I&apos;m not allowed into the bar during drinking hours...<em>officially</em>. Since the only heat I want coming down is from the stove, that&apos;s the fact as it must be reported and as we must maintain.&quot;</strong></p>

<p>According <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150402081105/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/07/nyregion/07wishbone.html?_r=3&amp;hp">to the Times</a>, a city health inspector gave McSorley&apos;s a grade of A at their recent health inspection, but &quot;strongly, strongly, encouraged&quot; the removal, or cleaning, of the wishbones above the chandelier (&quot;to avoid the dust from falling into the drinks of their bar patrons&#x201D;). The proprietor of the bar, Matthew Maher, explained that the bones were &quot;hung by doughboys as wishful symbols of a safe return from the Great War. The bones left dangling came to represent those who never came back.&quot; So last weekend, Maher reluctantly took the bones down, removed the dust, and put them back up, noting, &quot;It&#x2019;s something you didn&#x2019;t want to touch. It&#x2019;s the last thing I wanted to touch or see touched.&#x201D; </p>

<p>Minnie gained some infamy last year when she was the cause of a lawsuit by a NJ woman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150402081105/http://gothamist.com/2010/12/05/woman_sues_mcsorleys_over_villainou.php#photo-1">who claimed</a> she was attacked by her at the bar. Or as she put it on her Facebook, &quot;<strong>I&apos;m an adorable cat who&apos;s the target of a frivolous pawsuit</strong>.&quot; In an &quot;interview&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150402081105/http://evgrieve.com/2010/12/exclusive-minnie-mcsorleys-first.html">with EV Grieve</a> in December, she talked about her love for the bar, but noted that the DOH had been breathing down its neck: &quot;There is really no worst part about McSorley&apos;s, unless you count Bloomberg&apos;s thugs stomping around and picking on us. &apos;Why, yes, there is dust and the occasional fly, Mr. Health Inspector! Shocking in a 150-year old bar. Do you go to the Pyramids and complain about the dust?&apos;&quot; However, her favorite Facebook quote leaves us with some hope for the future: <strong>&quot;&apos;There have always been cats at McSorley&apos;s, and there always will.&apos; -Mattie Maher, current owner.&quot;</strong></p>
