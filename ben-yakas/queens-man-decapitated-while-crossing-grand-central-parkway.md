<p>A Queens man was decapitated while attempting to cross the Grand Central Parkway near LaGuardia Airport Friday evening. According to police, 31-year-old Fidel Vidal Diaz crossed the Parkway from south to north near 31st Drive around 11:30 p.m. last night. He had made it across the eastbound lane to a center median when he was struck by the driver of a 2005 Mustang, and then by the driver of a 2002 Volkswagon. </p>

<p>Police added that both drivers remained at the scene, and no criminality is suspected. They still haven&apos;t determined why Diaz was attempting to cross such a busy highway.
