<p>This week, a high end Manhattan real estate broker and proud &quot;Sugar Daddy&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408135916/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/25/sugar_daddy_charged_with_raping_wou.php">was arrested and charged with raping</a> a 26-year-old woman he met <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408135916/http://gothamist.com/tags/seekingarrangements">on SeekingArrangement.com</a>. Lakhinder Vohra, 46, was arrested on a first-degree rape charge after he allegedly raped the woman, whom he met on Wednesday in his Wall Street apartment during their first in-person meet-up. The owner of SeekingArrangement <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408135916/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/sugar_daddy_site_booted_rape_suspect_DIensRj49GM4T2FzO6wRNP">told the Post that</a> he had previously banned Vohra from the site for harassing women, adding that Vohra &#x201C;would not stop calling even after the woman said she wasn&#x2019;t interested.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Site founder Brandon Wade said he had first banned him for  getting too &#x201C;touchy-feely&#x201D; at a meet-and-greet party, then permanently banned him after the latest complaints from women. But Vohra created a new profile under the handle &#x201C;Daddy Loves Arm Candy&#x201D; on January 9th, which is how he met the victim. In a 2011 interview with The Post, the divorced Vohra claimed to be worth $2 million, and he bragged about how SeekingArrangement &quot;changed my f- -king life.&#x201D; </p>

<p>Vohra works at real estate firm Nest Seekers, runs the social site PartyDigest.com, and founded the SikhCommunityCenter.org site&#x2014;however, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408135916/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2268247/Lakhinder-Vohra-Manhattan-real-estate-playboy-charged-raping-woman-26-met-sugar-daddy-website.html">the Daily Mail reports</a> Vohra&apos;s bio page has been taken off the Nest Seekers site and replaced with a disclaimer: &quot;That agent is no longer working with Nest Seekers.&quot; According <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408135916/http://www.dpor.virginia.gov/LicenseLookup/">to the Virginia Department of Professional and Occupational Regulation</a>, Vohra had his license revoked on May 22, 2012.</p>

<p>Vohra has previously been charged with assault for allegedly body-slamming and punching a doorman who mocked him for bringing a woman home. And at least two women have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408135916/http://badboyreport.com/lak-vohra-lakhinder-vohra-212-742-0927-dubaishoppergmail-com-new-york/">written about him on BadBoyReport</a>. One said he was &quot;abusive and a danger,&quot; and he &quot;would grab me forcibly if he saw me heading for the door.&quot; The other said:</p>

<blockquote>I too have been a victim to this evil sinister man. Went to new years last year with him. And he tried to drug me. Also web I told him I wasn&#x2019;t going to sleep with him on the first date. He actually left me there all alone. He stole my bag money clothes that I left on his couch. Truly a bad man. One thing to say. Karma will get him back one of these days.</blockquote>
