<p>Come April 3rd, there will be a giant handlebar mustache-sized hole in the heart of Williamsburg, after LCD Soundsystem play their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412183247/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/05/lcd_soundsytem_announce_last_show_e.php">farewell show</a> at MSG and hang up their cowbells for good. But thankfully, hipsters won&apos;t have to suffer the indignity of sitting around crocheting bike seat covers to year-old chillwave cassettes: TV On The Radio <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412183247/http://www.tvontheradio.com/splash/">announced</a> that they will release their fourth album, <em>Nine Types of Light</em>, on April 12th. </p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412183247/http://gothamist.com/tags/tvontheradio">band</a> released the first single from the new album this week, &quot;Will Do,&quot; which shows them moving even farther from the sprawling, muscular guitar sound of <em>Return to Cookie Mountain</em> toward more soulful, twinkling type songs (you can listen <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412183247/http://stereogum.com/645611/tv-on-the-radio-will-do/mp3s/">here</a>). They also announced <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412183247/http://consequenceofsound.net/2011/02/tv-on-the-radio-announce-2011-tour/">new tour dates</a>, including a show on April 13 at Radio City Music Hall. You can also see the album artwork <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412183247/http://pitchfork.com/news/41674-new-tv-on-the-radio-will-do/">here</a>.</p>

<p>One of the most successful Brooklyn bands of the last decade, the five-person group are returning from a year-long break, during which they pursued solo projects and caught up on their laundry. Their last album, 2008&apos;s <em>Dear Science</em>, was named album of the year by a host of critics, including Rolling Stone, Spin, Entertainment Weekly and MTV. You can check out our interviews with guitarist/singer Kyp Malone <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412183247/http://gothamist.com/2008/09/23/kyp_malone_tv_on_the_radio.php">here</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412183247/http://gothamist.com/2004/08/26/kyp_malone_guitarist_tv_on_the_radio.php">here.</a> And below is our favorite clip of the band, performing the monstrous &quot;Wolf Like Me&quot; on Letterman a few years ago:</p>
