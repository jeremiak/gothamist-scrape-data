<p>Usually when we see someone&apos;s receipt end up in the news, it&apos;s because somebody <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506102434/http://gothamist.com/2013/12/20/manhattan_lawyer_says_loehmanns_sol.php">did something racist</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506102434/http://gothamist.com/tags/daynamorales">went trolling for public sympathy</a>. So it&apos;s a pleasant surprise that this isn&apos;t one of those times: a couple left a NJ bartender a $1,000 tip to help pay for surgery for her dog last weekend. &quot;It&#x2019;s just so overwhelming,&quot; Christina Summitt <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506102434/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/anonymous-tipper-helps-pay-n-dog-surgery-article-1.1768107">told The News</a>. &quot;He was just an awesome guy.&quot;</p>

<p>Summitt, 37, was bartending at the Holiday Inn in Clinton, NJ last Saturday when she had her fateful encounter. She said she got talking to a couple after they noticed the paw-print tattoo on her wrist. Summitt told them that Tucker&#x2014;her Great Dane-black Labrador mix&#x2014;had swallowed a plastic ball and needed surgery to get it out. The emergency surgery and hospital costs would come to about $2,700.</p>

<p>Summitt worried about being able to pay the costs; she works three jobs (full-time as a chef at the hotel, Saturdays as a bartender, and as a food prep worker two days a week at a deli), volunteers at an animal shelter, and has three stepchildren with her husband. &quot;It was just your average bartender and customer talk,&quot; she noted. When it was time to close out the $80 bar tab, the man left her $1,000 on top of that.</p>

<p>&quot;Shock. Complete shock,&quot; she said of noticing the amount. &quot;I started shaking, I couldn&#x2019;t breathe. How could there be three zeroes on there?&quot; She told him she couldn&apos;t accept it, and he insisted she use it toward Tucker&apos;s surgery. &quot;I just stood there in shock,&quot; Summitt <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506102434/http://edition.cnn.com/2014/04/23/living/bartender-tip-dog/index.html">told CNN</a>. &quot;I walked around and hugged this couple. They said, &apos;We&apos;ll be praying for Tucker.&apos;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Apparently this man does this quite frequently,&quot; hotel manager Michelle Satanik told CNN, saying they verified that the gesture was legit. &quot;Just a really nice guy and humanitarian. I have never ever seen a $1,000 tip like that.&quot; Tucker is back home recovering from surgery now. Clearly this mysterious charitable man took our <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506102434/http://gothamist.com/2014/04/22/my_waiter_was_rude_what_should_i_ti.php">words about tipping to heart.</a></p>
