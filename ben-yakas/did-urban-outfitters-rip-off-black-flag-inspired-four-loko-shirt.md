<p>Over the last two years, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428181621/http://www.urbanoutfitters.com/urban/catalog/category.jsp?popId=&amp;navAction=jump&amp;isSortBy=true&amp;navCount=15&amp;id=A_ENT_GAMES">Skull Bank purveyor</a> Urban Outfitters <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428181621/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/25/urban_outfitters.php">has been accused</a> by several <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428181621/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/26/is_urban_outfitters_still_ripping_o.php">jewelry designers</a> of ripping off their designs. The company <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428181621/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/28/urban_outfitters_responds_to_charge.php">defended themselves</a>&#x2014;it can&apos;t feel too good to be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428181621/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/27/urban_outfitters_jewelry_outrage_go.php">scolded by Miley Cyrus</a>, after all&#x2014;but now, a reader is alleging that the company ripped off his Black Flag-inspired Four Loko t-shirt!</p>

<p>Reader Brien K. told us that he printed and sold his design online in October last fall: &quot;Takeoffs on the BF/&quot;four bars&quot; logo are nothing new, but this particular take on the bars had been printed on shirts last year by me.&quot; He said that there were &quot;only about 100 printed and were sold through a few obscure blogs &amp; message boards&quot; (you can see <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428181621/http://trailsrule.blogspot.com/2010/10/4-loko.html">one example here</a>), but as you can see above, the designs are pretty similar&#x2014;although Urban Outfitters &quot;didn&apos;t even use the correct font!&quot;</p>

<p>You can see Urban Outfitters <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428181621/http://www.urbanoutfitters.com/urban/catalog/productdetail.jsp?itemdescription=true&amp;itemCount=80&amp;startValue=1&amp;selectedProductColor=&amp;sortby=&amp;id=22945919&amp;parentid=M_APP_TEESSHORT&amp;sor">design here</a>. Brien tells us he&apos;s &quot;not looking for money or any notoriety...I&apos;m sure that the design itself borders on copyright infringement, but I wanted to point out that they continue to rip people off.&quot; He also points out that Urban Outfitters is a bit late to cash-in on the Four Loko party: &quot;Not to mention that the &quot;real&quot; Loko is long gone from store shelves and who still drinks that shit anyway?&quot;</p>

<p>We are currently trying to contact Urban Outfitters for comment.</p>
