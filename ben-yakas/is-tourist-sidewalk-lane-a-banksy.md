A tipster pointed us to Banksy&apos;s book <em>Wall and Piece</em>, which has several examples of his text work, which bear some resemblance to the sidewalk lane (you can see some of those examples above). Banksy pieces have been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528184944/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/17/banksy_arrives_in_new_york.php">popping up</a> all over the city during the past week since his arrival in NY, and the sidewalk line has simultaneously become the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528184944/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/20/tourist_sidewalk_line_divides_new_y.php">&quot;talk of the internet.&quot;</a></p>
