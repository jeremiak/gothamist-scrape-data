<p>Yankees GM Brian Cashman was livid yesterday after hobbled former superstar and alleged centaur enthusiast <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130731072613/http://gothamist.com/tags/alexrodriguez">Alex Rodriguez</a> tweeted about his rehab recovery. &quot;Visit from Dr. [Bryan] Kelly over the weekend, who gave me the best news&#x2014;the green light to play games again!&quot; was the seemingly innocuous statement <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130731072613/https://twitter.com/AROD/status/349668933797818368">Rodriguez tweeted</a>. But it seems that Cashman, like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130731072613/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/07/donald_trump_thinks_a-rod_is_a_lose.php">so many before him</a>, has had enough of A-Rod&apos;s shit: &quot;You know what, when the Yankees want to announce something, [we will],&quot; Cashman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130731072613/http://espn.go.com/new-york/mlb/story/_/id/9422957/fed-brian-cashman-tells-alex-rodriguez-new-york-yankees-shut-up">told ESPN</a>. &quot;Alex should just shut the f--- up. That&apos;s it. I&apos;m going to call Alex now.&quot;</p>

<p>A-Rod <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130731072613/http://www.nypost.com/p/blogs/yankeesblog/excitement_still_talking_yankees_jBXsm7gKFhHSFpn84cpscO#axzz2XL7mlgL9">released a statement</a> today clarifying that he was just overexcited about the prognosis after being on the DL all season so far due to hip surgery: &#x201C;I will continue to work hard until my efforts get me back in pinstripes and help my team win,&#x201D; the statement read. &#x201C;The tweet was pure excitement about Dr. [Bryan] Kelly&#x2019;s prognosis.&#x201D; But Cashman&apos;s extreme reaction to the tweet&#x2014;something we can&apos;t imagine he would have said if Derek Jeter had done it&#x2014;suggests that the Yankees are really getting sick and tired of A-Rod.</p>

<p>This may have something to do with the fact that even if he does come back from surgery soon, he&apos;s facing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130731072613/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/04/a-rod_could_face_100_game_suspensio.php">a long suspension anyway.</a> It may be because of the many off-screen dramas involving blonde women and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130731072613/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/09/a-rod_reportedly_ballistic_about_po.php">popcorn</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130731072613/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/03/a-rod_2.php">poker games</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130731072613/http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/mlb-big-league-stew/rod-centaur-mystery-persists-issues-minotaur-painting-denial-011902280--mlb.html">centaurs</a>. Or it may be because he&apos;s been a shell of himself <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130731072613/http://espn.go.com/mlb/player/stats/_/id/3115/alex-rodriguez">over the last two seasons</a>, he&apos;s still under contract with the Yankees through 2017, and he&apos;s basically untradeable. Once all the great Yanks are gone&#x2014;Jeter, Mariano Rivera, Andy Pettitte&#x2014;A-Rod will still be standing there. And that&apos;s fucking annoying.</p>
