<p>Manhattan resident <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229211157/https://twitter.com/JenSelter">Jen Selter</a>, current owner of the internet&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229211157/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/03/early_addition_1373.php">most beloved butt</a>, doesn&apos;t like to give out too many verbal interviews&#x2014;she lets her <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229211157/http://instagram.com/jenselter">extremely well-documented online presence</a> do the talking for her. But she granted one such interview today, opening up about the reactions to her hard-earned, Long Island butt. And she confirms that old Mark Twain quote: the truest mark of being born with great qualities is to have Rihanna follow you on Instagram.</p>

<p>&quot;I&quot;m recognized wherever I am,&quot; she <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229211157/http://nypost.com/2014/01/02/instagram-star-jen-selter/">told the Post</a> in an interview earlier this month, explaining that she gets mobbed at her local gym. &quot;I don&apos;t really go to public gyms anymore just because it is a whole big scene when I&apos;m there.&quot; The person who literally quit her day job to become a full-time <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229211157/http://www.amazon.com/Crunch-Brand-New-Butt-VHS/dp/6303930298">real-life Crunch video</a> added, <strong>I don&apos;t like being watched</strong>.&quot; </p>

<p>Selter added that she would &quot;really like to spread my brand around the world as far as possible,&quot; which&#x2014;while clearly a nice setup for a gross joke&#x2014;might be tough to pull off. She may be the queen of Instagram, but she&apos;ll have some serious competition <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229211157/http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/real-life-stories/sarah-masseys-butt-seven-foot-wide-2971933#.UtmG6WQo5z8">if she decides to go national.</a></p>
