										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="92311gump.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160622014757im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/92311gump.jpg" width="250" height="164" class="image-left"> </span>A 24-year-old woman has decided to pull a Forrest Gump, and make her way across the country from San Francisco to NYC. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160622014757/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/44633241/ns/local_news-delaware_valley_pa_nj/">Catherine Li tells MSNBC that</a> she has a very specific reason why she is doing it: just cause. &#x201C;I just boil it down to the short version: I just felt like walking. <strong>I just decided to click over to living in the actual moment instead of inventing all these fantastic fantasies for the future</strong>,&#x201D; she said.</p>

<p>Unlike Forrest Gump however, Li is walking across the country, not running. It has taken her seven months and 3,000+ miles to get her to Pennsylvania. She&apos;s neither doing it to raise money nor to get views on her Tumblr&#x2014;her guide is a tattered 52-page batch of directions printed off Google Maps, hand-bound with string. Li said she&apos;s been surprised by how supportive strangers have been: &#x201C;People have given me a lot of support. They give me McDonald&#x2019;s gift cards and insist I take them. One time I went into a store and found $20 just sitting in my cart outside. I have no idea who left it.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Though she admits she has taken a few rides here and there along her way, she has been adamant about keeping herself committed to her goal, and finish her quest by walking into NYC: &#x201C;One time, a policeman escorted me out of a certain area at night, but the next day I asked him to take me back to the same spot. <strong>I don&#x2019;t want to cheat.&#x201D; </strong></p>

<p>For the record, Li has really made good time: it took Gump three years, two months, 14 days and 16 hours to run across the country (for no particular reason). We can&apos;t wait to see how Li&apos;s beard looks at the end of her run.</p>
