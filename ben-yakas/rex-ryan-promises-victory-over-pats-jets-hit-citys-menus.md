<p>Trash has been talked, guarantees have been made, and the whole city seems to be united around the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412175214/http://gothamist.com/tags/jets">Jets</a> in anticipation of tomorrow&apos;s AFC divisional round playoff game with divisional rivals the Patriots. The Empire State Building <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412175214/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/new_york_beams_with_jet_pride_22U3wBIDCwDx9fX4GBWIwN?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">was lit</a> in green and white Jets colors yesterday to support the team before the showdown. And <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412175214/http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/football/jets/2011/01/15/2011-01-15_gang_can_make_history__a_statement.html">according to</a> Rex Ryan, it will truly be an old west style showdown: &quot;<strong>It&apos;ll be huge. The second biggest game in the history of the franchise.</strong> You&apos;ve got your rival, at their place, off a huge, embarrassing loss on a Monday night game...We respect &apos;em. We do not fear &apos;em. And we&apos;re gonna win the game.&quot;</p>

<p>Ryan may respect the Pats, but it doesn&apos;t seem like the rival players are so respectful of each other. After Pat Wes Welker <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412175214/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/14/patriots_star_disses_rex_ryan_as_je.php">gave an interview</a> in which he made tons of references to feet, a sly dig at Ryan&apos;s alleged foot fetish, Jets linebacker Bart Scott said, &quot;I&apos;ll tell you what. Be very careful what you say about our coach. His [Welker&apos;s] days in a uniform will be numbered. Put it like that.&quot; The NFL was a little freaked out about his statement, and other such trash talking that has gone on between the two teams, and issued a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412175214/http://sports.espn.go.com/new-york/nfl/news/story?id=6024525">warning</a> to the teams to keep the bravado off the field. For his part, Ryan said he &quot;could take [the ribbing],&quot; while cornerback Antonio Cromartie, who previously called Tom Brady an &quot;a--hole,&quot; said: &quot;Wes is a funny guy. You can always read between the lines with him. But this game, it&apos;s going to be very big. Every guy in this locker room is looking at every other guy, making sure he knows exactly what his job is. Everyone is looking out for everyone else.&quot;</p>

So we got the whole city of New York behind us. Go Jets!&quot; And local businesses are responding in their usual ways: at the Peter McManus Cafe in Chelsea, bartender Lawrence Jansen is serving a tequila-and-Tabasco drink dubbed &quot;The Sanchez.&quot; At Gallagher&apos;s Steak House in midtown, there&apos;s a special &quot;Go Gang Green Power Lunch,&quot; featuring a menu filled with Jets-themed items, including the &quot;LaDainian Tomlinson Turkey Club,&quot; the &quot;Mark Sanchez Grilled Salmon Fillet&quot; the &quot;Braylon Edwards Beef Tenderloin,&quot; and a side of &quot;Santonio Holmes-Fries.&quot; Throw in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412175214/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/13/j-e-t-s_jets_jets_for_your_tummy.php">Jets Green &amp; White Cookies</a>, and there truly is a Jets-themed meal for the Rex Ryan in everyone.</p>
