<p>NASA astronaut Daniel Burbank, the commander of the International Space Station, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120603172607/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/lovejoy-comet-survived-brush-sun-puts-celestial-show-awed-astronaut-article-1.996227?localLinksEnabled=false">saw what he described as</a> a &#x201C;green glowing arc&#x201D; rising above the earth&#x2019;s horizon on Wednesday night. What he caught sight of some 240 miles above Tasmania was actually Comet Lovejoy, a &quot;sungrazer&quot; (a comet on a path that takes it near the sun) recently discovered by amateur astronomer, Terry Lovejoy. Burbank was in awe of the sighting, which you can see in a video below; he called it <strong>&#x201C;the most amazing thing I&#x2019;ve ever seen in space.&#x201D; </strong></p>
