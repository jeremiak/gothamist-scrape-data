<p>The thriving <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422215828/http://gothamist.com/tags/50shadesofgrey"><em>50 Shades Of Grey</em></a> secondary market may be the only thing holding up the US economy right now&#x2014;no one is arguing that those <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422215828/http://gothamist.com/2012/08/18/finally_a_50_shades_of_grey_tie-in.php">baby tees</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422215828/http://gothamist.com/2012/08/11/the_top_5_worst_50_shades_of_grey_t.php">Tie Handcuffs Mask Necklaces</a> aren&apos;t <em>important</em>. But <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422215828/http://gawker.com/5947542/buy-a-very-used-copy-of-fifty-shades-of-grey-from-three-brooklyn-milfs">Gawker points out</a> that some Brooklyn moms are really taking this whole entrepreneurial thing to the next level: three &quot;MILFY Brooklyn Babes&quot; from Williamsburg are selling their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422215828/http://www.ebay.com/itm/150912544152?afsrc=1">&quot;thrice-read&quot; copy of <em>50 Shades</em> on Ebay</a>. And they make no bones about how much they loved this &quot;deliciously used paperback copy.&quot;</p>

<p>You really do learn a lot more about Samantha, Allison and Sona then you might want to: they think <em>50 Shades</em> is &quot;the best erotic novel since Lady Chatterly&apos;s Lover&quot; [sic]; they describe themselves as &quot;3 tragically hip mothers and best friends;&quot; and then there are several photos (see above), probably more photos than one would need to purchase a paperback. The code words also run rampant in their description: &quot;delicious used,&quot; &quot;we all had our way with this book,&quot; &quot;much loved copy.&quot; </p>

<p>Read the full description below&#x2014;they also offer a &quot;personal note and/or lipstick kisses to the highest bidder.&quot; Which makes it seem as though these ladies really just want a taste of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422215828/http://gothamist.com/tags/amysohn">the Amy Sohn life.</a></p>

<blockquote>Samantha, Allison and Sona together are selling this very used, thrice read copy of Fifty Shades of Grey. Passed from one friend to another, we each made our way through the tantalizing first installment in the Fifty Shades trilogy. The lucky winner will hold in their hands a deliciously used paperback copy of the best erotic novel since Lady Chatterly&apos;s Lover. Hailing from Williamsburg Brooklyn we are 3 tragically hip mothers and best friends. We share everything from clothes to babysitting duties, so naturally we all had our way with this book. We each tremendously enjoyed reading this single copy of Fifty Shades of Grey. We want you, dear bidder, to enjoy this book as much as we did. This much loved copy of Fifty Shades of Grey will be shipped as is, or per request with a personal note and/or lipstick kisses to the highest bidder. And not to worry the entire set could be yours! The next two books will be up for auction once Sona is finished reading Fifty Shades Darker, and both Allison and Sona are handed down Samantha&apos;s current copy of Fifty Shades Freed. We&apos;re biting our lips waiting for the highest bidder!</blockquote>
