<p>After 35 years living on the Lower East Side, photographer, artist, and documentarian Clayton Patterson is moving to the Austrian Alps. He&apos;s survived Giuliani, the crack epidemic, and 9/11; he&apos;s outlasted CBGBs and Mars Bar; he&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507080140/http://gothamist.com/2008/07/28/clayton_patterson_arrested.php">been arrested</a> dozens of times and come back for more. So what finally broke Patterson? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507080140/http://gothamist.com/tags/gentrification">Gentrification</a>. &quot;There&apos;s nothing left for me here,&quot; he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507080140/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/06/nyregion/clayton-patterson-rebel-and-photographer-plans-to-leave-the-lower-east-side-for-europe.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">told the Times</a>. &quot;The energy is gone. My community is gone. I&apos;m getting out. But the sad fact is: I didn&apos;t really leave the Lower East Side. It left me.&quot;</p>

<p>Patterson is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507080140/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/06/nyregion/clayton-patterson-rebel-and-photographer-plans-to-leave-the-lower-east-side-for-europe.html">profiled in the Times</a> this weekend in a long piece all about his decision to leave his beloved adopted city. The larger-than-life Patterson&#x2014;who has a distinctive, braided beard, gold teeth, and looks at a glance like a long-lost member of the Hell&apos;s Angels&#x2014;has one final photography show, &quot;$16 Burger,&quot; opening in the meatpacking district on April 15th before he leaves. </p>

<p>Patterson sounds depressed by everything happening on the LES: rising rents, the loss of neighborhood institutions, the obscene displays of wealth by new residents, the lack of a creative community, and the death of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507080140/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/09/taylor_mead.php#photo-1">friends like Taylor Mead</a>. &quot;The fact is, no one gave a damn about Taylor Mead,&quot; he said, &quot;and what it made me realize was just how vulnerable people in this city are&#x2014;even well-known and well-loved people. I might think that I&#x2019;m the king of the world, but the truth is there&#x2019;s no appreciation here for what I do or what I&#x2019;ve done.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Clayton is the neighborhood&#x2014;or what&#x2019;s left of it,&quot; added <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507080140/http://www.litkicks.com/RonKolm">Ron Kolm</a>, a poet, editor, activist and bookseller who once worked at the Strand with Patti Smith. &quot;<strong>I guess I always figured that he&#x2019;d be the last one standing, surrounded by tall buildings.</strong> This really is the end of an era.&quot; </p>

<p>Something tells us he&apos;ll be back though: Patterson talks about how his spirits have been lifted in recent months because he&apos;s found a group of artists, musicians, filmmakers and PR people who appreciate him (and helped organize the upcoming show). &quot;It&#x2019;s exciting,&quot; he says at the end of the piece. &quot;It feels like we&#x2019;ve got youth here&#x2014;youth, vitality and interest. It&#x2019;s almost like we&#x2019;re on the threshold of a new moment. Who knows? Maybe this is the beginning of an actual beginning.&quot;</p>
