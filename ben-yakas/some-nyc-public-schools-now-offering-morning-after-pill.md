So far, students at 13 high schools have received the birth control drugs as part of a new citywide health initiative, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406202346/http://schools.nyc.gov/Offices/Health/default.htm">CATCH</a>&#x2014;Connecting Adolescents To Comprehensive Health. &#x201C;High school students are very sexually active and getting pregnant so we don&#x2019;t have that luxury to think that they are too young to be engaged in conversations about contraception and sexual education,&#x201D; City Council Speaker Christine Quinn <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406202346/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2012/09/23/new-york-city-public-schools-offering-morning-after-pill/">told CBS.</a></p>

<p>During an unpublicized pilot program in five city schools last year, 567 students received Plan B tablets and 580 students received Reclipsen birth-control pills, according to the Department of Health. Parents can opt out of the program, but only about 1 to 2 percent of parents at each school have returned the opt-out sheets, said DOH spokeswoman Alexandra Waldhorn.</p>

<p>Anonymous parents and officials around the city have plenty of opinions about the initiative: &#x201C;Should the high school or the city pay for it? Are we responsible for that? I don&#x2019;t think so, but to have a 14-year-old child in that dilemma, that&#x2019;s not a good situation either,&#x201D; one woman told CBS. &#x201D;I would hope that a 14-year-old girl would have that kind of relationship at least with her mother.&#x201D; &#x201C;We can&#x2019;t give out a Tylenol without a doctor&#x2019;s order,&#x201D; one school staffer told the Post. &#x201C;Why should we give out hormonal preparations with far more serious possible side effects, such as blood clots and hypertension?&#x201D; </p>

<p>&#x201C;Girls shouldn&#x2019;t be sexually active at that age,&#x201D; said 15-year-old Annette Palacios, who goes to High School of Fashion Industries in Chelsea, one of the schools in the program. &#x201C;I don&#x2019; t want to be a young kid who gets pregnant and can&#x2019;t find a job,&#x201D; one of her classmates argued.</p>
