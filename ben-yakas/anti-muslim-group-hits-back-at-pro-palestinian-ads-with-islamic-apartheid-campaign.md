<p>A new nationwide campaign of pro-Palestinian ads comparing Israel to apartheid-era South Africa <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150612024120/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/27/controversial_pro-palestine_ads_wen.php">went up at Metro-North stations this week</a>, coinciding with Passover. The controversial ads, which were sponsored by grassroots advocacy organization American Muslims for Palestine, thoroughly enraged everyone&apos;s favorite virulent Islamaphobe, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150612024120/http://gothamist.com/tags/pamelageller">Pamela Geller</a>. And so today, Geller and her group, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150612024120/http://freedomdefense.typepad.com/">American Freedom Defense Initiative</a>, have unveiled their own campaign in response, as you can see above and below.</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="32813islam2.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150612024120im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/32813islam2.jpeg" width="640" height="500"> <br> <i> American Freedom Defense Initiative</i></div> <p></p>

<p>Geller condemned the pro-Palestinian ads, which will appear at 25 Metro North stations and run for four weeks, calling them the &quot;latest blood libel against the Jews,&quot; ranting that it&apos;s &quot;not surprising that Islamic supremacists would appropriate the propaganda methods of the Third Reich, as they partnered with Hitler and shared the same goal.&quot; </p>

<p>The new anti-Muslim ads, which feature &quot;gay&quot; men being hung under Islamic law and a  woman in a white burqa getting whipped, have been submitted to the MTA for approval (which they will almost certainly get, considering the group&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150612024120/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/12/controversy_over_pro-palestine_ads.php">other controversial ads</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150612024120/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/20/judge_mta_violated_first_amendment.php">have also</a> been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150612024120/http://gothamist.com/2012/09/25/vandals_label_hateful_subway_ads_ha.php">approved</a>). According <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150612024120/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/pro_israel_group_launches_new_TL0ss1fkxRY8Zw5W5yDlVO">to the Post</a>, Geller has requested that these ads be placed at the same stations where the pro-Palestinian ones are, including Fordham and 125th Street. </p>
