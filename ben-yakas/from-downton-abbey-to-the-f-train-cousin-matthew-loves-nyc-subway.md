<p>The internet was in an uproar after the latest season of <em>Downton Abbey</em> [SPOILERS GALORE FROM HERE ON YANKEES] when beloved Cousin Matthew, the once-impotent heir apparent, was nonchalantly killed off in a hilariously corny car accident right after his baby was born. Actor Dan Stevens <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505002941/http://www.vanityfair.com/online/oscars/2013/03/dan-stevens-downton-abbey-matthew-crawley-regret">has thoroughly moved on from the show</a>, trading in tea and quippy dowagers for scotch cocktails and Broadway. He seems to have really taken a shine to NYC while starring in &quot;The Heiress,&quot; and professed his love for our &quot;amazing&quot; transit system <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505002941/http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2013/03/23/downton-abbey-star-dan-stevens-rides-the-f-train-just-like-us/?mod=WSJBlog">to the Journal.</a></p>

<p>So if you ever wanted to know what lines Cousin Matthew rides, here&apos;s your chance:</p>

<blockquote><strong>Speakeasy</strong>: Now that we&#x2019;ve got you in here in New York, what do you like about it?

<p><strong>Dan Stevens</strong>:  Everything. Just the energy of the place. It&#x2019;s energizing and also exhausting. But it&#x2019;s always had an electricity that I find very attractive.</p>

<p><strong>Speakeasy</strong>: Do you ever take the subways?</p>

<p><strong>Dan Stevens</strong>: Oh yeah. I love the subways.</p>

<p><strong>Speakeasy</strong>: No you don&#x2019;t!</p>

<p><strong>Dan Stevens</strong>: Yeah!</p>

<p><strong>Speakeasy</strong>: What&#x2019;s your train?</p>

<p><strong>Dan Stevens</strong>: The 2/ 3 and the A/C and the F. I take them all the time.</p>

<p><strong>Speakeasy</strong>: I&#x2019;ll look for you next time I&#x2019;m on the F,  the A/C or the 2/3.</p>

<p><strong>Dan Stevens</strong> (laughs): It runs all night. Are you listening, London? It is amazing. Whatever New Yorkers say, you have an amazing subway system. It makes all the difference. Why shouldn&#x2019;t I take the subway? It&#x2019;s great.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>Of course, just because you know he rides the F doesn&apos;t mean you&apos;ll necessarily recognize him&#x2014;as you can see in the photos above, Stevens has undergone a surprising transformation, shedding his blonde British chub for a dark, gaunt, mustachioed look. </p>

<p>He is now filming a movie in Brooklyn with Liam Neeson called <em>A Walk Among the Tombstones</em>, and he doesn&apos;t understand <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505002941/http://www.buzzfeed.com/tommywes/dan-stevens-from-downton-abbey-looks-totally-different">why anyone cares</a> about his dirty mustache: &quot;Really? OK, I suppose,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505002941/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/huff-wires/20130322/us-people-dan-stevens/?utm_hp_ref=green&amp;ir=green">he said to AP</a> when asked about the interest in his appearance. &quot;There&apos;s so much else going on in the world.&quot;</p>
