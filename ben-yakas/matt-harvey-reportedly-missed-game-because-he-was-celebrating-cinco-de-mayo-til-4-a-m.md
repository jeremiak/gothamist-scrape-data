<p>After a week of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170509233306/http://gothamist.com/2017/05/07/mets_suspend_matt_harvey_amid_fever.php">dildo accusations</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170509233306/http://gothamist.com/2017/05/08/matt_harvey_mets_grievance.php">grievance filings</a>, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170509233306/http://gothamist.com/tags/mattharvey">Matt Harvey</a> saga took another turn for the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170509233306/http://gothamist.com/tags/mets">Mets</a> today as yet another alleged reason for their spat with the star pitcher has been revealed: Harvey likes to party, sources say.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170509233306/https://pagesix.com/2017/05/08/what-matt-harvey-was-doing-the-night-before-his-suspension/">Page Six reports</a> that the reason Harvey didn&apos;t show up to Citi Field for last Saturday&apos;s game is because he was out until 4 a.m. that morning celebrating Cinco de Mayo at 1Oak, the notorious <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170509233306/http://gothamist.com/tags/1oak">celebrity-and-sports star hangout.</a> According to their sources, Harvey &quot;rolled up on the velvet rope club &apos;with his boys&apos; at about 1 a.m. and settled into a private table,&quot; before imbibing &quot;Armand de Brignac &apos;Ace of Spades&apos; Champagne, Don Julio 1942 tequila and Belvedere vodka.&quot;</p>

<p>Up until now, the official story was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170509233306/https://www.fanragsports.com/mlb/mets/heyman-shedding-light-matt-harvey-situation/">that Harvey went golfing</a> early on Saturday, came down with what he called a &quot;migraine,&quot; and didn&apos;t show up to the game because of that. There&apos;s a dispute about whether Harvey texted the Mets to say he was ill before they contacted him that afternoon, but the team ended up sending two security officials to Harvey&apos;s Greenwich Village apartment around 10 p.m. to check on him. Harvey reportedly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170509233306/http://www.sbnation.com/2017/5/8/15586236/matt-harvey-mets-suspension-pajamas">answered the door in his pajamas.</a></p>

<p>Was his migraine a hangover in disguise? Did Harvey even go golfing? If he did go, does that mean he wasn&apos;t hungover? Has he ever experienced migraines before (as someone who regularly gets them, I can safely say it&apos;s something that the team would be aware of if he had a problem with them before)? Regardless of all this, this incident&#x2014;which led to a three game suspension&#x2014;seems to be yet another indication that there is a gap between what the Mets need from Harvey and what he seems to be willing to give back. Harvey has slowly become the Mets&apos; version of 2013-era <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170509233306/http://gothamist.com/tags/jrsmith">JR Smith</a>&#x2014;the lovable, hard-partying Knicks bad boy whose off-the-field antics sometimes got in the way of his play, and sometimes got him <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170509233306/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/21/jr_smith_got_trapped_in_a_garage_tw.php">trapped in his own garage</a>&#x2014;and both management and fellow players are not happy. </p>

<p>The only people who have sounded <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170509233306/http://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/19341718/new-york-mets-performed-welfare-check-matt-harvey-pitcher-no-show">more exhausted</a> by this whole saga than manager Terry Collins (&quot;You make a mistake.

<ul>
	<li>&#x201C;He wants to be Derek Jeter,&#x201D; said one teammate, summing up the internal frustration with Harvey. &#x201C;To do that, you&#x2019;ve got to show up.&#x201D;</li>
	<li>&#x201C;Something had to happen,&#x201D; another teammate said. &#x201C;There had to be a sense of accountability.&#x201D;</li>
	<li>Harvey, 28, has long been a source of contention within the Mets&#x2019; clubhouse, with some teammates bristling at his outsized &#x201C;Dark Knight&#x201D; persona. One teammate described a &#x201C;sense of alienation&#x201D; that Harvey created around himself.</li>
