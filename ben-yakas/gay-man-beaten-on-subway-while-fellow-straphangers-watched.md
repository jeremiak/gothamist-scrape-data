<p>According to cops, the incident happened around 6 p.m. on Monday on a southbound 2 train in Manhattan. Frankelly&apos;s partner, who didn&apos;t give his name to the News, said that a woman took a picture of them eating while her friend said homophobic remarks to them. &#x201C;Why you taking a picture?&#x201D; the victim asked. &#x201C;Feed you face, f-----&quot; the suspect shouted back. Another woman said: &quot;Why you with that f-----?&quot;</p>

<p>The argument escalated from there, and the partner said the two women were joined by three other women and a man, making for a 6-on-2 situation. Frankelly bore the brunt of the fight, with the swollen eye and several facial lacerations; the couple got off at 96th Street and were treated at St. Luke&#x2019;s Hospital.</p>

<p>Police say no arrests have been made yet, and a hate crime investigation has been launched.</p>
