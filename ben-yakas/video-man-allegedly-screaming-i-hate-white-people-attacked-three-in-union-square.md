A man was arrested this afternoon in Union Square after allegedly attacking three people. According to witness <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150325114445/http://gothamist.com/tags/joeyboots">Joey Boots</a>, the African-American suspect attacked a white man around 2:30 p.m. &quot;He bloodied him up pretty good,&quot; Boots said. When two others came to aide the victim, the suspect allegedly assaulted them as well, and started shouting, &quot;I hate white people.&quot; You can see a video of the aftermath below.<p></p>

<p>It&apos;s unclear what started the fracas, although the Instagram user who posted the video <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150325114445/http://instagram.com/p/d2XJJ_y9KW/">said</a>, &quot;This dude punched this other dude for walkin past him funny.&quot; At least one victim (the first) was taken to a nearby hospital for his injuries; police had no immediate information about the incident. </p>

<p>Boots added that he believes the suspect is a homeless man who has started hanging out in the Square in the past couple days: &quot;I was told he&apos;s been around here for a few days...he&apos;s been getting sandwiches from a local church group.&quot; </p>

<p>The NYPD and the FDNY did not immediately have any details about the incident. You can see a few more photos and Twitter reactions below. </p>
