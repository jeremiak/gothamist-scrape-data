<p>The modern Knicks have had to deal with controversies like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130918061049/http://gothamist.com/tags/honeynutcheerios">Honey Nut Cheerios</a> trash talking, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130918061049/http://gothamist.com/tags/linsanity">Linsanity</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130918061049/http://gothamist.com/tags/jamesdolan">James Dolan&apos;s</a> musical career, and the disastrous <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130918061049/http://gothamist.com/tags/isiahthomas">Isiah Thomas years</a>. But all of that seems relatively quaint and cuddly compared to some old school Knicks problems: according to FBI informants, several players on the Knicks roster in the &apos;80s were routinely fixing games to pay off their coke dealers.</p>

<p>These FBI documents are cited in Brian Tuohy&#x2019;s new book, &#x201C;Larceny Games: Sports Gambling, Game Fixing and the FBI.&#x201D; &#x201C;The FBI had info that two to three members of [Red Holzman&#x2019;s] Knicks were shaving for a coke dealer,&#x201D; Touhy <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130918061049/http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/basketball/knicks/new-york-fix-book-claims-knicks-bet-games-article-1.1456576">told The News</a>. &#x201C;And that informants believed that the players were betting on the games themselves &#x2014; betting on the Knicks to lose.&#x201D; </p>

<p>The dealer, who previously had only made $300 bets on games, started laying down $10K wagers on the Knicks&apos; opponents starting in January 1982&#x2014;by March, he had won six of his seven bets against the Knicks, while still making $300 bets on other NBA games. &#x201C;Over...the last two months, all three [players] have given...tips on when to bet the Knicks to lose...betting against themselves,&#x201D; the FBI report states. </p>

<p>The FBI reports don&apos;t reveal what players were believed to be in the fix, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130918061049/http://nypost.com/2013/09/14/knicks-players-fixed-games-for-drug-dealers-in-80s-fbi/">the Post asked</a> former guard Micheal Ray Richardson, who was banned for life from the NBA in 1986 for violating the NBA&#x2019;s drug policy three times, about it: &#x201C;Hell no!&#x201D; Richardson said when asked about the point-shaving allegations. &#x201C;We never did anything like that.&#x201D;</p>
