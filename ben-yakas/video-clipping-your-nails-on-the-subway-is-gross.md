title: Video: Clipping Your Nails On The Subway Is Gross
---

	
										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="4111nails.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150409232223im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/4111nails.jpg" width="250" height="233" class="image-left"> </span>We thought we already had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150409232223/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/20/guerilla_subway_etiquette_posters_d.php">this covered</a>: nail clipping on the subway is not cool, under any circumstances. As it is, we think even nail filing is on the edge of acceptability. But clipping? Between the nails-on-chalk sound and the discarded bits that fly all over the place, it is absurd that we&apos;re even having this conversation. And this assumes that we&apos;re only talking about fingernails! And yet, in the video below, a man is called a &quot;mental case&quot; for pointing out to a stranger that it&apos;s &quot;kinda gross&quot; that he was clipping his nails on the subway. </p>

<p>The two get into a long argument about subway etiquette, but the clipper-in-question calls the request a &quot;ridiculous demand&quot;, and refuses to cede his position, saying he has &quot;nothing to do in here.&quot;</p>

<p>We especially enjoy this reasonable argument against clipping nails: &quot;If you would like to be a normal human, than you would not do that...These people are normal human beings because they decided, &apos;I&apos;m not going to brush my teeth on the subway&apos;...that I don&apos;t mind, you can file away, just the clipping is really gross. Please don&apos;t do this.&quot; </p>

<p>One more time: don&apos;t clip your nails on the subway, don&apos;t have sex on the subway, don&apos;t urinate on the subway, and be respectful of noise pollution, physical contact, hygiene, seating priority, garbage disposal (or lack thereof), and of course, eating. But do feel free to put a rat <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150409232223/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/09/video_sad_rat_man_makes_out_with_ra.php">in your mouth</a> if the mood strikes you.</p>
