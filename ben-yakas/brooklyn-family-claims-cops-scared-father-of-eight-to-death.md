<p>A Brooklyn family is suing the NYPD claiming that a father-of-eight was literally scared to death by cops during a raid. Carlos Alcis, 43, died of an apparent heart attack Thursday morning around 5 a.m. after cops burst into his home on Rockaway Parkway in Brownsville. Alcis collapsed during the confrontation, and died soon after. &#x201C;They scared him to death. He was healthy and fine,&#x201D; Alcis&#x2019; brother, Stevenson Alcis, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928035139/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/brooklyn-father-dies-arguing-police-home-article-1.1428240">told the News.</a></p>

<p>The raid occurred after a 21-year-old woman had been punched in the face at the corner of Kings Highway and Rockaway Parkway by a man who took her iPhone. A good Samaritan had followed the robber to the two-story brick building where the Alcis&apos; lived, and cops started going door-to-door to catch the thief. Cops say they knocked on their door and were allowed in, while the family disputes this, saying cops pried open their door, splintering it near the lock. Two other neighbors <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928035139/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local/new_york&amp;id=9207477">also told ABC that</a> cops burst in their apartments.</p>

<p>Alcis&apos; son Lissage Alcis, 21, said everyone was asleep in the apartment when they came in: &#x201C;My door was closed and then the door opened and there was a flashlight in my face,&#x201D; he told the News. &#x201C;My father kept asking, &#x2018;What happened? Why are you here?&#x2019;&#x201D; Alcis started shaking after he collapsed; cops kept searching the apartment even as blood came from his mouth.</p>

<p>Eventually they got his 16-year-old son Emmanuel, whom they had first questioned about the theft, to help perform CPR. The family claims it took 30 minutes for an ambulance to reach the home, and he was dead by that time. &#x201C;This is a wrongful death that should never have happened,&#x201D; lawyer Sanford Rubenstein said. </p>

<p>Cops later found the stolen iPhone in front of a nearby building on Rockaway Parkway using her Find My iPhone app; no arrests have been made in that incident.</p>
