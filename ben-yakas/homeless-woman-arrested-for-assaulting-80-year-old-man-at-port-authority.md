<p>A homeless woman was arrested yesterday for allegedly assaulting an elderly man at the Port Authority. Police say that the 80-year-old man was waiting outside the ladies room for his wife at the Port Authority Bus Terminal around 7:30 a.m. Saturday when he was attacked by 40-year-old Danika Riley. &quot;She just walked up to him, pushed him to the ground and began kicking him,&quot; a source <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508153025/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/woman-attacks-stomps-elderly-man-head-port-authority-article-1.1715628">told the News</a>. &quot;He&apos;s 80, and she decides to do a dance on his head.&quot;</p>

<p>Police say there&apos;s no apparent reason why Riley was &quot;stomping&quot; on the man&apos;s head and kicking him. She was arrested and has been charged with assault and criminal possession of a controlled substance (police found a crack pipe on her). The victim, who lives in West New York, was treated for injuries at the scene, and later taken to the hospital complaining of chest pains.</p>

<p>Riley has previous arrests for drug possession, false impersonation, gun possession and an assault on a police officer; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508153025/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Woman-40-Arrested-for-Beating-Up-Man-80-in-NYC-249143401.html">she also</a> broke out of a penitentiary in Oklahoma in 1994. </p>
