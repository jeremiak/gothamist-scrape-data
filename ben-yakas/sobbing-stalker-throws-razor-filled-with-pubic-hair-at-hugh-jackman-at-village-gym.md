<p>If you&apos;ve never had to dodge a razor full of pubic hair, then you&apos;re not really a celebrity&#x2014;Hugh Jackman went through the sacred rite of passage in the West Village yesterday. According <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160427020851/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/hugh_pubic_enemy_NsCZo3ohNZFoRarAghXk9H">to the Post</a>, sobbing female stalker Kathleen Thurston tracked Jackman to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160427020851/http://www.gothamgymnyc.com/">Gotham Gym</a> around 8 a.m. Saturday. Despite her conspicuous tears, she was able to slip past guards and throw an electric razor filled with her pubic hair at him while screaming, &quot;I love you.&quot;</p>

<p>&#x201C;She was crying,&#x201D; said Mike Castle, a Gotham trainer who was in the facility&#x2019;s boxing ring. &#x201C;I physically removed her from the place, then I called the cops.&#x201D; A gym worker grabbed her, but she may have slipped away, since police arrested her at West 14th Street and Eighth Avenue. </p>

<p>The NYPD Crime Scene Unit recovered the &quot;weapon&quot; and had to pick the hairs out of it to match them with her DNA. Meanwhile, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160427020851/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/19/lost_evidence_sloppy_investigation.php">families of New Yorkers who are killed by automobiles</a> are lucky if they <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160427020851/http://gothamist.com/tags/ryooyamada">receive any proof that an NYPD investigation was conducted in the first place.</a>  </p>

<p>Thurston, 47, has now been charged with stalking. This wasn&apos;t the first time Jackman has had a run-in with her&#x2014;she once showed up at Jackman&#x2019;s home in the Village, and Jackman also told cops he saw her outside his daughter&apos;s Manhattan elementary school. </p>

<p>Jackman, who is currently getting ready to film <em>X-Men: Days Of Future Past</em>, is handling the situation like a professional: &#x201C;Here&#x2019;s a woman who obviously needs help so I just hope she gets the help she needs,&#x201D; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160427020851/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2013/04/14/woman-arrested-for-stalking-hugh-jackman-in-west-village/?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter">he told CBS,</a> before sneaking home and relieving his deep, unyielding urge to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160427020851/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkTOYGnqU4Y">pull the hair out of his shower drain.</a>  </p>
