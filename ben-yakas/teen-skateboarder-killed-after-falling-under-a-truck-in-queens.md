<p>An 18-year-old skateboarder was killed earlier today after he fell underneath a truck in Queens. Police say that Alexander Ciszewski, of Sunnyside, was riding his skateboard and holding onto the passenger side of a 2005 GMC box truck going eastbound on 47th Avenue between 32nd Place and 33rd Street in Long Island City just before noon today. He apparently lost control, and fell underneath the rear wheel of the truck.</p>

<p>A witness <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130929044945/http://nypost.com/2013/09/26/skateboarder-dead-in-tragic-accident/">told the Post</a> he saw the driver look in his rearview mirror and speed up. &#x201C;I know he probably saw the guy. He sped up about five miles per hour either to get the kid to let go or to give him a faster ride,&#x201D; said Jadon Thompson. &#x201C;I saw fear in [Ciszewski&apos;s] face and then he went under,&#x201D; he added. </p>

<p>Ciszewski was found unconscious and unresponsive by emergency responders; he was rushed to Elmhurst Hospital, where he died. The Post says the truck driver didn&#x2019;t stop immediately, but returned to the scene twenty minutes later. Cops add that the investigation is ongoing.</p>
