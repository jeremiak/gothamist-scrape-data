<p>Yesterday, a Far Rockaway elementary school was put on lockdown after a 7-year-old <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428113012/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/17/police_handgun_found_in_7-year-olds.php">brought a loaded handgun</a> in his backpack. Police <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428113012/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/18/far_rockaway_mom_arrested_after_7-y.php">have arrested</a> 7-year-old Tyler Farley&apos;s mother, 53-year-old Deborah Farley, for the incident. Now, cops say Farley has taken full responsibility for the incident: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428113012/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/19/nyregion/mother-of-7-year-old-with-gun-is-arrested.html?smid=tw-share&amp;_r=0">according to the Times</a>, she admitted she had placed the handgun, ammunition and a flare gun in her son&#x2019;s Batman backpack Wednesday night, and then forgot to take them out before he went to school the next morning. She maintained that Tyler never knew he had the weapons.</p>

<p>Tyler&apos;s father, Walter Orozo, seemed to contradict some of the details while defending his wife earlier in the day: &#x201C;He was afraid for his life,&#x201D; Orozo <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428113012/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/queens/7-year-old-gun-queens-school-article-1.1242006">told the News</a> about his son. &#x201C;He was afraid to go to school. The kids were picking and picking on him, but the school wouldn&#x2019;t do anything to protect him.&#x201D; Orozo <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428113012/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/queens/mom_busted_after_son_brings_pistol_AN0NU9DuBZwcKv4auWKcEM">was insistent in multiple interviews</a> that the family doesn&apos;t own any guns.</p>

<p>&#x201C;They called him sissy and white boy,&quot; Orozco told the Times, adding: &#x201C;He didn&#x2019;t want to go to school. He fakes like he&#x2019;s coughing when he gets up in the morning. We always complained, but the school didn&#x2019;t do anything.&quot; Orozo posited to the Post that the couple&apos;s other 21-year-old son is in in a gang: &quot;Maybe Tyler found it and hid it.&quot; Investigators are looking to speak with that 21-year-old brother, who has a criminal record and may actually own the gun in question.</p>

<p>However, police say they found more .22 caliber bullets in the couple&apos;s home Friday morning, as well as evidence she had kept an unlicensed handgun in her home, where she lives with the three youngest of her four children (ages 7, 9, 21 and 27). They also found seven small bags of marijuana. Now, both Tyler and his 9-year-old sister have been placed in ACS custody.</p>

<p>Students at the school described what happened after the lockdown began: &#x201C;On the loudspeaker, the principal told us there was someone near the school with a gun,&#x201D; 11-year-old Santos Hercules told the News. &#x201C;We had to stay quiet till it passed... I felt scared, but I wasn&#x2019;t too scared because I knew I had to be strong.&#x201D; &#x201C;I thought we were going to get killed,&#x201D; Javier Ferrufino, an 11-year-old in fifth grade, told the Times. &#x201C;We went to the back of the classroom. I hid with my friend behind some computers.&#x201D;<br>
