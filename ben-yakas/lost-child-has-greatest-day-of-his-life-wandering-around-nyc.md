<p>A 9-year-old boy who got separated from his parents at the Central Park Zoo on Saturday had what he called the &quot;greatest day&quot; of his life wandering around the city. &quot;This was the greatest day of my life, because this was the first day I was at the police station!&quot; an overjoyed Chris Villavicencio <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140805214506/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/missing-boy-9-greatest-day-lost-midtown-article-1.1890219">told the News</a> after walking around Midtown for two hours alone yesterday. Maybe Chris is a fan of Madvillain: &quot;Looks like it&apos;s gonna be a great day today / to get some fresh air like a stray on a straightaway.&quot;</p>

<p>Chris was at the Zoo with his parents and his younger sister by the Delacorte Music Clock when they got separated around 4:30 p.m. Saturday. Chris, who is mildly autistic, ended up wandering out to 64th Street while looking for his parents, then found himself in Times Square looking for familiar buildings. </p>

<p>His parents reported him missing just after 5 p.m., and sometime before 6 p.m., he got into the Port Authority bus terminal near W. 40th Street, where cops picked him up. After the family was reunited, he warned his sister, &quot;Remember: don&apos;t wander off.&quot; While it may have been one of the best days in Chris&apos; life, we feel pretty assured it was a terrible day for his parents&#x2014;it sounds like the whole family could use some <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140805214506/http://gothamist.com/2014/08/03/introducing_the_barnburner_a_warm_c.php#photo-1">barnburners at Hay Rosie</a> to cap off their adventures.<br>
