<p>Jets quarterback Geno Smith was kicked off a Virgin America flight at LAX yesterday after he allegedly refused to stop using his cell phone and got into a shouting match with an airline attendant. Or as one airport official <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406143522/http://nypost.com/2014/01/17/jets-qb-geno-smith-escorted-off-plane-at-lax-by-cops-report/">told the Post</a>, he &quot;pulled an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406143522/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/06/alec_baldwin_may_have_just_been_kic.php">Alec Baldwin</a>.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406143522/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pd4yxIGdB1c">Geno no no no no no no!</a></p>

<p>There are actually a few <em>mostly</em> non-conflicting reports about what Smith did to get himself escorted off the plane, which was headed from LAX to Fort Lauderdale, where Smith lives in the offseason: </p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406143522/http://deadspin.com/geno-smith-allegedly-escorted-off-plane-by-lax-cops-1503821554">Deadspin first reported</a> that Smith was witnessed in a &quot;verbal altercation.&quot; That witness told them Smith was upset because he was on standby for the flight, saying to airline ticket agents, &quot;Fuck that, this is bullshit&quot; and &quot;Why the fuck do I have to wait until 2:40.&quot; </li>
	<li>A source <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406143522/http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/football/jets/jet-grounded-geno-smith-escorted-lax-flight-verbal-altercation-report-article-1.1583486">told the News</a> that Smith did get aboard the plane and, &quot;The flight crew asked him to get off his cellphone three times, but he didn&#x2019;t comply.&quot; Another source <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406143522/http://nypost.com/2014/01/17/jets-qb-geno-smith-escorted-off-plane-at-lax-by-cops-report/">told the Post</a>, &quot;[Smith] was on the plane. The crew didn&#x2019;t push off [take-off] because he was on the phone. So, the captain ordered him off the plane. Virgin America wouldn&#x2019;t rebook him.&quot;</li>
	<li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406143522/http://www.tmz.com/2014/01/17/new-york-jets-geno-smith-not-kicked-off-flight-quarterback-lax-video/?adid=sidebarwidget-tmzsports">TMZ claims that</a> Smith was listening to music on his headphones when the crew announced it was time to shut off electronics. Smith claimed he didn&apos;t hear the announcement, and the flight attendant came over and physically unplugged his headphones. They led to a screaming match, and Smith allegedly stood up and refused to sit down.</li>
	<li>On top of all this, Smith denied he did anything wrong. &quot;[Smith] said he didn&#x2019;t know why he was kicked off the flight,&quot; a source told the News. &quot;He said it was because he was black. Virgin Airlines refused to re-book him because he was being disruptive.&quot; Smith told TMZ as he was leaving the airport, &quot;don&apos;t believe that man.&quot;</li>
</ul>

<p>Deadspin reckons that all of these incidents could have happened: &quot;it seems entirely possible&#x2014;and indeed likely&#x2014;that Geno Smith got in trouble with the cops twice in one day.&quot; The Jets acknowledged the incident in a statement: &quot;We are aware of the report and researching the fact. We will have no comment at this time.&quot; On the plus side, at least no <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406143522/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/17/jets_tight_end_allegedly_caught_mas.php">open containers of vaseline were involved with Smith&apos;s arrest.</a></p>
