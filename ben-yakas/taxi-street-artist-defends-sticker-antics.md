<p>Recently, those sorta-naked men who appear on the side of yellow taxis discovered shame thanks to street artist <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141128121913/http://thetailornyc.com/">The Tailor</a>, who then <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141128121913/http://gothamist.com/2010/11/30/naked_taxi_stick_figures_get_awesom.php">bestowed them with the gift of modesty</a> in the form of awesome costumes, including Mr. T, Wonder Woman, Zeus and Waldo. The Tailor, who works by day in marketing at a Fortune 500 company, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141128121913/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/stickup_artist_strikes_city_cabs_InzB7GqEXeNrUn0GbdFfKJ?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">told the Post</a> he sees it as his creative outlet: &quot;I&apos;m just adding a touch of personality. <strong>I&apos;m not anti-establishment or anything, but I found it depressing that the man is telling us that &apos;this icon is you.&apos;&quot;</strong> </p>

<p>David Yassky, head of the Taxi and Limousine Commission, isn&apos;t impressed or amused by his antics: &quot;He is defacing privately owned property, and taxicab owners and drivers are left to restore the appearance of the taxi in the course of doing business. It&apos;s disrespectful of the rights of others, and it should stop immediately.&quot; Nevertheless, The Tailor doesn&apos;t think what he&apos;s doing is vandalism, and has already prepared a new set of images, including Spider-Man, a Hasidic guy, a city cop, a firefighter and Mickey Mouse. If you see any, snap a picture and send them to tips@gothamist.com!</p>
