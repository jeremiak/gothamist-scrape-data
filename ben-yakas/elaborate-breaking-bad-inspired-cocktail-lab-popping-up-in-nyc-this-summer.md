</div></div>					<p>It&apos;s been almost four years since the end of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170616060033/http://gothamist.com/tags/breakingbad"><em>Breaking Bad</em></a>, but the show&apos;s legacy lives on in novelty t-shirts, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170616060033/http://gothamist.com/tags/bettercallsaul">wonderful spin-offs</a>, and the occasional Heisenberg-influenced eateries. The <em>Breaking Bad</em>-themed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170616060033/http://gothamist.com/2016/09/13/breaking_bad_coffee_shop.php#photo-1">Walter&apos;s Coffee Roastery in Bushwick</a> was a pretty good way to get your C8H10N4O2 fix; the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170616060033/http://gothamist.com/tags/lospolloshermanos">Los Pollos Hermanos pop-up</a> was insanely popular for a few days in the Financial District; and now, we may have the best Walter White-inspired project yet: cocktail bar pop-up <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170616060033/http://abqny.com/">ABQ</a> will roll an RV into the city this summer for an interactive cocktail mixing experience.</p>

<p>The Lollipop-run ABQ, which has popped up <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170616060033/https://abqlondon.com/">in London and Paris for the last two years</a>, will open up in July in NYC (it&apos;s not yet clear exactly where the RV will be stationed). The RV can accommodate about 30 &quot;cooks&quot; at a time; after getting a welcome drink, patrons are given manuals with instructions on how to cook two molecular cocktails using the elaborate lab set up. One is Saul&apos;s C2H6O, which is &quot;a semi frozen cocktail using dry ice and nitrogen cavitation process of rum, pink peppercorn and rose hip;&quot; the other is Blue Flynn, which is &quot;a rum based strawberry infused cocktail using flavoured acids rather than citrus juices&quot; (it also changes color with the addition of acidity). </p>

<p>As you can see in the photos above, the RV is lovingly adorned with various BB references and objects, including the lab coats, Walter White&apos;s signature pork pie hat, and the pink teddy bear from season two.</p>

<p>&quot;No doubt ABQ is one of the most interesting and fun project[s] we have built in the last few years and I am happy that finally it is going to be open in NY,&quot; Seb Lyall, founder of Lollipop, said in a press release. &quot;It feels like homecoming, given the inspiration behind our concept.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Lollipop specializes in creating immersive bars and restaurants,&quot; Lyall added. &quot;Our company ethos is to build an interactive and experiential setting, which redefines user experience in our venues. We want to bring back &#x2018;the fun&#x2019; in going out and we believe drinking is not the only thing which makes for a good experience.&quot;</p>

<p>After it opens in July, it will stick around &quot;for a few months;&quot; tickets cost $45-49 for a two-hour stint and three cocktails in the bar. If you&apos;re interested in checking it out once it&apos;s here, there&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170616060033/http://abqny.com/">a wait list on their website here</a>; there are already over 1,400 people who have signed up, and tickets will be released on a first come first served basis.</p>
