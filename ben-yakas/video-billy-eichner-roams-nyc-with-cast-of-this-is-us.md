And he brought along four cast members (stars Mandy Moore, Milo Ventimiglia, Chrissy Metz and Justin Hartley) from <em>This Is Us</em>, the hit NBC show that was scientifically designed to make viewers bawl over their unresolved family issues. &quot;Miss, if Mandy Moore can have a primetime hit, I want a detective series with Michelle Branch,&quot; Eichner enthuses at one point. </p>

<p>And while some New Yorkers were ecstatic (or deadpan-ecstatic) about Moore&apos;s Emmy campaign, at least one dude just wanted to find out if she was single. &quot;This is us, and this is sexual harassment,&quot; Eichner said as he brushed past Brian, who probably has never seen the show. Watch it below. </p>
