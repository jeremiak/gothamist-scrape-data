<p>As the dust settles on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120118130820/http://gothamist.com/tags/occupywallstreet">Occupy Wall Street&apos;s</a> &quot;day of action&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120118130820/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/17/occupy_wall_street_tries_to_march_o.php#photo-13">on Thursday</a>, allegations have emerged that some protesters harassed young kids as they walked to school with their parents near Wall Street in the morning. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120118130820/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2011/11/17/ows-protesters-chant-follow-those-kids-as-small-children-try-to-go-to-school-on-wall-street/">CBS reports that they saw</a> one protester follow a father and his little daughter down one block, while others chanted &quot;follow those kids!&quot; One mother told CBS, &quot;For them it&#x2019;s horrible. They&#x2019;re afraid of all the crowds. We&#x2019;re not even able to get through. They&#x2019;re just, he&#x2019;s &#x2026; very afraid now.&#x201D; Watch their report below:</p>

<p>While you can definitely see the one protester following the father and daughter in the report, we haven&apos;t seen any other instances, or heard any other accusations, of protesters harassing kids&#x2014;even <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120118130820/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/just_trying_to_make_it_home_WbcqScSEUSoCeBlh1yUIDP?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">the Post didn&apos;t mention anything about it today</a>. So did CBS overhype one isolated incident? </p>

<p>Our reporter Chris Robbins <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120118130820/https://twitter.com/#!/ChristRobbins/status/137157848378523648">also encountered a gaggle of children</a> near the march on Beaver Street; one boy said &quot;this is funny&quot; about the circumstances going on around him. And while the barricades certainly could have come off as scary to some kids, others told CBS they thought it was for a parade.</p>

<p>Joey Boots&#x2014;whose video of a Brookfield Properties security guard <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120118130820/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/16/video_zuccotti_park_security_guard.php">calling him &quot;faggot&quot;</a> led to the guard being fired&#x2014;captured video of one father and child making their way through the crowd. He shouts, &quot;Hey kid. This is what Democracy is, kid,&quot; then notes, &quot;He just got a history lesson.&quot; Watch below:</p>

<p>Up until now, OWS has been quite kid-friendly, especially when it was nestled in Zuccotti Park: they had a children&apos;s activities corner there, there were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120118130820/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/20/bring_out_your_kids_to_zuccotti_par.php#photo-1">sleepovers for families</a>, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120118130820/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/21/schoolkids_field_tripping_to_occupy.php">schooltrips for classes</a> studying the American civil rights movement. The spirit of those events continued yesterday at around 5:30 p.m., when there was a Student Walk-Out event in Foley Square&#x2014;Josephine Ferorelli told us that some middle schoolers were invited to join in on the people&apos;s mic. &quot;They were marching because funding had been cut from art, music, and science labs...It was really awesome,&quot; she told us. Below, check out two videos of the adorable kids leading the chant:</p>
