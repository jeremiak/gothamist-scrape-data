<p>Artist and web researcher <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150222210234/http://nickolaylamm.com/">Nickolay Lamm</a>, who previously <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150222210234/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/18/see_manhattans_wealth_inequality_vi.php">visualized the extent of wealth inequality in the neighborhoods of Manhattan</a> with a series of 3D maps, is back with a new series of maps this week, inspired by the question: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150222210234/http://www.storagefront.com/therentersbent/why-are-cities-hotter-than-surrounding-areas">why are cities so much hotter than surrounding areas</a>? To find out, he brought a thermal imaging camera to NYC to see the effect in action&#x2014;because this is exactly the kind of idea that pops into your brain when <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150222210234/http://gothamist.com/tags/heatwave">it&apos;s 95 degrees in Manhattan</a> and your soul is dripping through a sewer grate.</p>

<p>Lamm found an answer to his question: the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150222210234/http://www.epa.gov/hiri/">&quot;urban heat island effect.&quot;</a> That&apos;s what happens when every surface is paved with heat-absorbing asphalt and concrete. Not helping things here are a lack of plants and trees to cool the air, as well all the heat generated by our electronic billboards, TVs, and buildings. </p>
