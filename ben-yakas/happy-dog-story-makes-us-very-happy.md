(via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428150427/http://www.northjersey.com/community/pets/Staten_Island_dog_turns_up_in_NJ_after_2-month_odyssey.html">The Record</a>)</i></div> Yesterday, we experienced a thawing of our icy, bitter hearts when we encountered <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428150427/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/26/lost_dog_in_dumbo.php#photo-1">Zuzu the lost dog</a>, her leash wagging in the wind. After a magical evening in DUMBO, Zuzu was happily reunited with her human. But though Zuzu may be back home pawing through a sea of doggie treats, we just can&apos;t stop all these feelings which have invaded out bodies! Whatever these strange sensations coursing through us may be, we won&apos;t be sated till we hear more tales of animal triumph over the hardships of this world. Thankfully, one Staten Island dog&apos;s story has heeded our call.<p></p>

<p>Roxy, an 8-year-old boxer, leaped over the fence in her yard in Staten Island during the blizzaggedon after Christmas, and disappeared for two months. But amazingly, she turned up earlier this month in north New Jersey. &#x201C;I searched high and low. I thought she had to either be in Brooklyn or in Jersey. She turned out to be in Jersey,&#x201D; owner Phil Molina told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428150427/http://www.northjersey.com/community/pets/Staten_Island_dog_turns_up_in_NJ_after_2-month_odyssey.html">The Bergen Record</a>. Police believe she somehow made it across the Kill Van Kull and through Hudson County where she ended up in Guttenberg, about 20 miles away. </p>

<p>Then on March 4, a woman found Roxy dodging traffic in town, and brought her into the Guttenberg Police Department, when Roxy proceeded to charm the officers. &#x201C;This dog was the sweetest dog you ever met,&#x201D; said Officer Richard Andersen, who was ready and willing to adopt her. But the next day, an animal clinic located the dog&apos;s microchip with her owner&apos;s information, and she was happily reunited with Molina. No one has any idea how she made her way from SI to Jersey however: &quot;I wish she could talk to share her adventure,&quot; said Molina. We imagine it was an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428150427/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeward_Bound:_The_Incredible_Journey">incredible journey</a> you&apos;d have to see to believe.</p>
