<p>New Yorkers had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604150958/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/24/is_she_medicated_moma_visitors_deli.php#photo-1">varying reactions</a> to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604150958/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/23/photos_tilda_swinton_is_sleeping_in.php">Tilda Swinton&apos;s surprise performance art piece at MoMA</a> on Saturday&#x2014;on a scale of David Blaine to Marina Abramovi&#x107;, we thought she swayed more toward the latter. And amateur Renaissance Man <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604150958/http://gothamist.com/tags/jamesfranco">James Franco</a> certainly didn&apos;t want to miss out on the event of the day&#x2014;he showed up just before closing time (with Michael Stipe!) to check out sleeping Swinton, as you can see in the grainy photo sent by a tipster below. </p>

<p>Plenty of people noticed him noticing her there as well:</p>

<p>This all seemed entirely appropriate, considering the fact that throughout the day, people were finally able to dump their Franco/Swinton jokes onto Twitter&#x2014; about how maybe Swinton <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604150958/https://twitter.com/chrisrusak/status/315869883428663296">was really Franco</a> in disguise, or how he should <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604150958/https://twitter.com/victorianegri/status/315668138630971392">join her</a> in the box, or how he was probably <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604150958/https://twitter.com/joshfjelstad/status/315537175854858242">kicking himself</a> for not <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604150958/https://twitter.com/PhillySongs/status/315844638139367424">thinking of this first</a>, or how he&apos;ll probably <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604150958/https://twitter.com/esmithrakoff/status/315647595550736385">copy her idea later.</a> </p>

<p>Whether or not you think Franco&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604150958/http://dcist.com/2013/03/out_of_frame_spring_breakers.php">grillz-as-pathos</a> shtick is brilliant or just the equivalent of a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604150958/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/06/james_franco_is_bringing_a_psychic.php">limited edition switchblade party</a>, it&apos;s always more admirable to be interested and engaged in the art world, and supportive of people taking risks (regardless of whether you think said attemps are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604150958/http://www.reddit.com/r/Art/comments/1avb4l/tilda_swinton_is_asleep_in_a_glass_box_in_the/">&quot;a cheap attempt at modern art&quot;</a>), than not. And hey, Franco certainly makes for a good addition to the city&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604150958/http://gothamist.com/tags/stefon">current hottest nightclub.</a></p>
