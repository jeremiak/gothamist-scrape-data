The MTA announced that there will be no express subway service after 5:45 p.m. today on the A, B, D, E, F, N, Q, Z, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 lines. </p>

<p>All buses after 7 p.m. will be chained excluding express buses, as well. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160125094601/http://alert.mta.info/">The MTA adds</a> ominously that customers &quot;should expect service to be impacted across the MTA network tonight and tomorrow morning. Service could be curtailed or suspended on a line or route basis depending on snowfall amounts.&quot; This most likely is just them covering their bases, but then again, nobody wants to be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160125094601/http://gothamist.com/2010/12/28/32_hours_stranded_on_the_subway_one.php">trapped on a subway for 32 hours</a>, so a little caution goes a long way in these scenarios&#x2014;and we&apos;ve certainly seen what happens when <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160125094601/http://gothamist.com/tags/blizzageddon">there is not enough caution.</a></p>

<p>De Blasio is giving another storm update now: </p>

<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="//web.archive.org/web/20160125094601if_/http://www.youtube.com/embed/Ca6weMjZT90" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: Mayor de Blasio reiterated much of what he said <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160125094601/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/02/de_blasio_gives_blizzard_update_ple.php">at his earlier press conference</a> (alternate side parking will be suspended tomorrow, people should stay indoors tonight and keep the streets clear). He added that NYC is under winter warning watch from 6 p.m. Thursday until 1 p.m. on Friday. </p>

<p>The decision whether to close schools will &quot;be made in the early morning hours&quot; Friday. Meteorologists are now predicting 5-9 inches of snow in the city, with winds of 15-25 MPH, and gusts of up to 35 MPH. But here&apos;s the worst part: he says it may feel like it&apos;s 10 below zero tomorrow thanks to wind chills.</p>
