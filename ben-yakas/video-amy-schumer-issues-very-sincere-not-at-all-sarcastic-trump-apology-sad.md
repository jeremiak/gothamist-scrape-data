<p>This weekend, hundreds of people <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161023044059/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/17/schumer_florida_walkout.php">walked out of Amy Schumer&apos;s live show in Tampa, Florida</a> after she dared to talk about politics during her set and called Donald Trump an &quot;orange, sexual-assaulting, fake-college-starting monster.&quot; Will he ever recover from her not nice words?!? Schumer clearly knew she had crossed a line, and decided to read an open letter to the Tampa crowd during her show at MSG last night. The not-at-all sarcastic missive made her feelings about the walkout and the election crystal clear.</p>

<p>&quot;Tampa, I am so sorry. I shouldn&#x2019;t have said that he was an orange, sexual-assaulting, fake-college-starting monster,&#x201D; she told the audience. &quot;Shouldn&#x2019;t have said that. I will never again say that he is an orange, sexually assaulting, fake-college-starting monster. Never again.&quot; Watch the whole speech below.</p>

<p>She started the letter, &quot;Dearest Tampa: I&#x2019;m sorry you didn&#x2019;t want me, a comedian who talks about what she believes in, to mention the biggest thing going on in our country right now,&#x201D; she read. &#x201C;How could I think it was OK to spend five minutes having a peaceful conversation with someone with different views? After the show, I want you to know that I will go straight to a rehab facility that will teach me how to make all people happy &#x2014; both the rich, entitled, white people who are gonna vote for him and the very poor people who&#x2019;ve been tricked into it.&quot; Bet Joe Walsh appreciated that.</p>

<p>She concluded her letter, &quot;I look forward to putting this all behind us in a couple weeks when Hillary Clinton is our motherfucking president!&quot;</p>

<p>Hey, guess who else was at the Schumer show last night: Madonna....performing jokes?</p>

<p>Although she&apos;s out on tour, Schumer has been cramming in as much voter registration and Hillary-stumping as possible. That includes an appearance in pro-Hillary group Humanity for Hillary&apos;s video in which sexual assault survivors condemn Trump.</p>
