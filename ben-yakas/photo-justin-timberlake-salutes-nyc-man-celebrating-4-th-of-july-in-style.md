<p>Leave it to world&apos;s foremost boxed dick expert <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928034811/http://instagram.com/p/bWd33Pydl6/">Justin Timberlake to find</a> the true spirit of the 4th of July right here in the heart of Manhattan. This photo, which appears to have been taken on Lispenard Street between 6th Avenue and Church Street in front of the Z100 offices, captures an intimate moment with America&apos;s shirtless avatar, who is kicking back with a beer and beating the heat in the most logical way imaginable. His jeans are rolled up, his feet are stretched out in the inflatable swimming pool of freedom, and somewhere in the distance, he can hear <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928034811/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rzU2iJ9qfXg">&quot;Gimme Back My Bullets&quot;</a> and all is well.<br>
