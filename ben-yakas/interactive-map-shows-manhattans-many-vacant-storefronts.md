<p>The NYC <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170311011948/http://gothamist.com/tags/realestate">real estate market</a> continues to squeeze both renters and buyers, yet vacant storefronts still plague even so-called &quot;trendy&quot; neighborhoods. There are several <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170311011948/http://gothamist.com/2015/05/13/vacant_storefronts_nyc.php">frustrating reasons for all of this</a> conspicuous urban blight, which is one of the reasons why freelance developer Justin Levinson has assembled a comprehensive map of all the vacancies around Manhattan, which you can find below. <br>
 <br>
&quot;I felt that it was important to bundle up the scattered data into a coherent narrative that people could look at and understand easily if we wanted to have any kind of change,&quot; he said.</p>

<p>Levinson, a 34-year-old East Village resident, told us he was inspired to start the project, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170311011948/http://www.vacantnewyork.com/context.html">Vacant New York</a>, after living in NYC for a few years and watching his favorite regular stores and bars disappear one by one: &quot;It&apos;s always been the case [that places disappear], but more and more they weren&apos;t being replaced,&quot; he said. &quot;A few big ones stuck out because I saw them on my walk to work all the time, including the Barnes &amp; Noble on 8th Street, and the post office-turned-HSBC on 14th and 6th.&quot;</p>

<p>As he outlines on the website, the project is intended to &quot;to provide some background around commercial vacancies and use a map to give some insight into the extent of the issue, ideally doubling as a tool for community groups and policymakers to identify areas for intervention.&quot;</p>

<p>As for what any possible intervention could look like, he outlined a few ideas for us: &quot;There&apos;s a lot of potential solutions: vacancy taxes, tenant subsidies, rent regulations, and more, but they&apos;ve all got flaws&#x2014; there&apos;s no one right answer,&quot; Levinson noted. &quot;It&apos;s very easy to point fingers and build a narrative of greedy landlords or simple business failures, without taking into account that most people aren&apos;t purposefully being evil; they&apos;re operating in a system with certain rules and incentives.&quot; </p>

<p>Of course, it goes without saying that terrible things happen regardless of whether anybody <em>intends </em>to be &quot;evil&quot; or &quot;greedy.&quot; And this sort of retail blight is increasingly pervasive beyond Manhattan. Here&apos;s what one property owner in Williamsburg said to a concerned resident last year, when asked if he would ever rent out his long-vacant storefront:</p>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">&quot;A few blocks north it&apos;s really heating up. In 18 months this block&apos;ll heat up too.&quot; Until then, blight!

<p>&quot;There&apos;s externalities beyond these storefronts: both an impact on the neighborhood and tremendous opportunity cost involved in leaving storefronts empty, so it&apos;s worth some experimentation to see if we can better utilize this space,&quot; he added. &quot;I&apos;d like to get to a point, using tools like this map, where citizens and government can look at the situation and say &apos;this isn&apos;t working, what changes can we try?&apos;&quot;</p>

<p>(Note: Levinson said there were some &quot;false positives&quot; with the data, which he addressed in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170311011948/https://www.reddit.com/r/nyc/comments/4z7ebo/mapping_manhattans_vacant_storefronts/">a Reddit thread here</a>. You can also submit corrections or additions to the map <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170311011948/http://www.vacantnewyork.com/contribute.html">on his website here.</a>)<br>
