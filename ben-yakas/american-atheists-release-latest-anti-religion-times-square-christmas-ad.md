<p>Every year, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150103062927/http://gothamist.com/tags/atheists">American Atheists</a> release some giant billboard meant to spark controversy and discussion about religion and Jesus and Christmas and 9/11 and etc. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150103062927/http://news.atheists.org/2013/12/03/press-release-atheists-nobody-needs-christ-at-christmas/">Their latest salvo</a> is a 40&#x2032;x40&#x2032; digital billboard in Times Square that takes the Christ out of Christmas, celebrating &quot;the true meaning of Xmas&#x201D;&#x2014;which apparently includes human life, the Rockettes, and Chinese food. Ya know, that thing Jews eat on Christmas.</p>

<p>Compared to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150103062927/http://gothamist.com/2010/11/28/athiest_billboard_calls_nativity_a.php">past</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150103062927/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/01/see_mondays_controversial_anti-reli.php">God-baiting</a> billboards, this one is pretty tame by their standards. We think AA needs to get a bit more modern if they really want to cause a stir, so we&apos;ve made a mockup for next year&apos;s billboard for them, which you can see below.</p>
