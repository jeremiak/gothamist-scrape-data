<p>Like many of us, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021163501/http://gothamist.com/tags/johnoliver">John Oliver</a> was amazed to find that even after, you know, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021163501/http://gothamist.com/tags/donaldtrump"><em>everything</em></a>, Donald Trump could find a lower rock bottom to hit this week with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021163501/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/07/trump_what_this_time_oh_god.php">the Trump Tapes</a>. &#x201C;Last Sunday, I told you that if you looked above the clouds, you would see rock bottom,&#x201D; Oliver said, referring to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021163501/http://gothamist.com/tags/aliciamachado">Alicia Machado controversy</a>. &quot;If you look up there now, just way, way up there, all the way up high, you will see right up in the distance where we were this time last week. Since then, we have sunk so low we are breaking through the Earth&apos;s crust, where drowning in boiling magma will come as sweet, sweet relief.&quot; This is what happens when you hang out with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021163501/http://gothamist.com/tags/billybush">Billy Bush.</a></p>

<p>&quot;Incidentally, fuck Billy Bush, fuck that guy,&quot; Oliver said. &quot;It is gross enough that he is serving as Trump&apos;s hug pimp, but let&apos;s not gloss over the fact that he just said, &apos;How about a little hug for the Bushie,&apos; a phrase that, if it is not already, should be a felony offense in all 50 states.&quot; </p>

<p>Oliver goes on to unpack Trump&apos;s apology: &quot;He says he never pretended to be someone he&#x2019;s not, right before claiming these words don&#x2019;t reflect who I am. Which is absolutely absurd, they could not capture his essence more if they were spoken by a spray-tanned Furby eating KFC and screaming at a gold-star family.&quot;</p>

<p>While Trump and his psychotic surrogates grabbed Oliver&apos;s attention for the start of the show, the bulk of the episode found Oliver examining the legal and moral issues surrounding the military prison at Guant&#xE1;namo Bay. Check that out below.</p>
