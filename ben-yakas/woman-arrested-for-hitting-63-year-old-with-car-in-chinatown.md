<p>A woman was arrested after she allegedly hit a 63-year-old with her car in Chinatown yesterday, then left the scene of the incident. According to police, Shenequa Gayle, 20, was driving a rented sedan westbound on Hester Street when she turned left onto the Bowery and allegedly struck Tak Ng around 7 a.m. Friday. Gayle allegedly got out of the car, walked over to Ng, then got back in and sped away.</p>

<p>Ng was rushed to Bellevue Hospital, where he is listed in critical condition. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140304073243/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/man-clinging-life-hit-car-article-1.1706565">The Daily News reports</a> that a witness snapped a photo of Gayle at the scene. According <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140304073243/http://nypost.com/2014/02/28/cops-question-suspected-driver-in-bizarre-hit-and-run/">to the Post</a>, cops first brought in a man who was found in the car for questioning, but that man told them where they could find Gayle. </p>

<p>Gayle has now been charged with leaving the scene of an accident, unauthorized use of a vehicle and not having a valid driver&apos;s license.</p>
