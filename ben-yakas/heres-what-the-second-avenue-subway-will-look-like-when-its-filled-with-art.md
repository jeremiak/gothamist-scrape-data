</div></div>					<p>It&apos;s been years in the making, but finally, the first phase of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507080105/http://gothamist.com/tags/secondavenuesubway">Second Avenue Subway</a> is scheduled to be completed and open to the public in December of 2016. We&apos;ve had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507080105/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/25/photos_a_2nd_avenue_subway_tour.php#photo-1">a lot of glimpses</a> of the MTA working on the tunnels to make the line a reality, but we haven&apos;t really spent much time contemplating what it will look like once the damn thing is done. Until now: above, you can see some of the renderings of art the MTA has commissioned that will adorn the four major stations along the route.</p>

<p>As <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507080105/http://untappedcities.com/2014/01/22/subway-art-on-the-future-second-avenue-subway-line-revealed-nyc/">Untapped Cities reports</a>, artist <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507080105/http://www.jeanshin.com/">Jean Shin</a> will decorate the walls of the 63rd Street station with a ceramic and glass photographic installation, that will include archival photos from the Transit Museum. Artist and photographer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507080105/http://vikmuniz.net/">Vik Muniz</a> will install his piece, &#x201C;Perfect Strangers,&#x201D; at the 72nd Street station. Those photos, which &quot;celebrates the many interesting and unique characters one sees on the train,&quot; will be transferred onto life sized mosaics&#x2014;you can read <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507080105/http://vikmuniz.net/library/vik-muniz-the-wrong-logician-or-cats-and-dogs-fighting-like-clouds">more about his work here.</a></p>

<p>The legendary Chuck Close will display large and intricately designed portraits of NY&apos;s cultural figures at the 86th Street station. This will be the largest mosaic public art work that Close has ever created. You can see a documentary on Close below.</p>

<p>And finally, artist <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507080105/http://www.sarahsze.com/">Sarah Sze</a>, whose <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507080105/http://www.thehighline.org/sarah-sze-still-life-with-landscape-model-for-a-habitat">fascinating High Line installation</a> is a Gothamist favorite, will contribute to the 96th Street station. Sze has been commissioned for a series of drawings on the porcelain wall panels; these works will depict &quot;dynamic landscapes evoking wind, architecture, flora and dramatic energy fields divided into three distinct palettes of blue, violet, and lavender located at three different entrances.&quot;</p>
