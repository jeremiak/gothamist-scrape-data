That doesn&apos;t do it justice: the video includes cameos from the ATL Twins, Hot Sugar, Fat Tony, Jimmy McMillan, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422201128/http://www.dansmithguitar.com/home.html"><strong>Dan Smith</strong></a>. Finally, we have up-to-date visual proof that Dan Smith truly doesn&apos;t age.</p>
