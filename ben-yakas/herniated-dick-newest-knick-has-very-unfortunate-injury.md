<p>Despite the return of Amare Stoudemire, the Knicks played terribly last night <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160211032825/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/05/last_nights_action_69.php">in an ugly away loss to</a> the Charlotte Bobcats. The team is already starting to look desperate for their newest point guard, veteran Baron Davis, to recover from an offseason injury&#x2014;but judging by what <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160211032825/http://www.charlotteobserver.com/">The Charlotte Observer</a> identifies as the injury, that recovery might take a very long time. Of course, Davis <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160211032825/http://sports.yahoo.com/nba/blog/ball_dont_lie/post/A-newspaper-typo-surrounding-Baron-Davis-8217-?urn=nba-wp12820">is out with</a> a herniated disc, not a &quot;herniated dick.&quot;</p>

<p>Mike Persinger, executive sports editor of the Charlotte Observer, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160211032825/http://blogs.charlotte.com/inside_the_nba/2012/01/baron-davis-what-a-difference-a-letter-makes.html">offered this explanation</a> on the paper&apos;s website yesterday:</p>

<blockquote>Observer reporter Rick Bonnell wrote the preview box, and in it he wrote that Davis, a former Charlotte Hornet, is recovering from a &quot;herniated disc&quot; in his back. The box was edited by an experienced copy editor, the reporter&apos;s first line of defense, and moved along in the production process as written.

<p>The next stop was a final read by a second editor, another experienced employee who recognized that &quot;herniated disc&quot; doesn&apos;t conform to the newspaper&apos;s style for that type of injury, and that it should be &quot;herniated disk.&quot; That editor tried to type in the correction, but ended up with an unfortunate typo. </p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>Davis took the mistake in stride, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160211032825/https://twitter.com/#!/Baron_Davis/status/154657897379401729">tweeting</a>, &quot;Thanks Charlotte Observer for announcing my new injury. Still able to workout with it. Lol,&quot; then following that with a clarification for those not following along: &quot;That was a joke people. Excuse the person from the Observer who made a Typo. . I was Just having fun. My Goldmember is not herinated. Lol.&quot;</p>

<p>Davis should just be glad that he wasn&apos;t on the receiving end of a mistake from the Gray Lady. The NY Times issued a correction, which you can see below, to their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160211032825/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/26/us/navigating-love-and-autism.html?pagewanted=all">fascinating story earlier this week about love and autism</a>&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160211032825/http://www.buzzfeed.com/catesish/the-greatest-new-york-times-correction-ever">Buzzfeed called it</a> &quot;The Greatest New York Times Correction Ever,&quot; although we still stand by a certain <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160211032825/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/08/is_this_the_greatest_ny_times_corre.php">Tolkien-by-way-of-The Mets correction as our favorite.</a></p>
