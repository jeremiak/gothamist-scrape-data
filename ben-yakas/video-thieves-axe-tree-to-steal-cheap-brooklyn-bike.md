<p>Reddit user TenThousandSuns posted the video below, which shows a group of men in Kensington at 2 a.m. Wednesday morning chopping down a ginkgo tree with an axe, seemingly in order to steal a bike. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509002026/http://www.reddit.com/r/bicycling/comments/huksi/how_far_will_ny_thieves_go_to_steal_a_50/">initial post</a> was titled, &quot;How far will NY thieves go to steal a $50 department store bike locked with a $10 cable lock? This far.&quot; It was followed by one with the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509002026/http://www.reddit.com/r/bicycling/comments/hv3aq/as_requested_tree_chopping_bike_thief_video/">security camera footage</a>, &quot;at 4x speed and 100x the rage&quot;, which you can see below. There are a lot of terrible aspects to the incident, but it&apos;s pretty pathetic that they go through with chopping down the tree, and then indifferently ride the bike for less than five seconds.</p>

<p>The poster notes the bike isn&apos;t his, because he keeps his &quot;strictly indoors&quot;&#x2014;he says it is &quot;one of those mass produced &quot;dual-suspension mountain bikes&quot; you see so often. Probably a hapless neighbor who didn&apos;t know any better. This is Kensington area in Brooklyn, but I can see this happening anywhere here, really.&quot; However, the tree was planted by his father, which is what makes the incident really hurt: &quot;My dad co-paid with the landlord for the foresters to plan[t] this specific tree. I don&apos;t know if it&apos;s actually his legally, but it&apos;s definitely his in spirit...<strong>my dad really wanted that type of tree as allegedly it&apos;s very long lived. A legacy if you will. I&apos;ll pass your knowledge on</strong>.&quot;</p>

<p>Some Reddit users posit that maybe the whole point was only to chop down the tree&#x2014;maybe they never really wanted the bike. But as the original poster says, the bike was eventually grabbed: &quot;It was taken 30 minutes later by one of the dudes, I don&apos;t remember which.&quot; You can see a picture of the tree the morning after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509002026/http://i.imgur.com/vhs5y.jpg">here.</a></p>
