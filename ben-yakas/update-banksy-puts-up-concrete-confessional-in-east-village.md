<p>After sending out a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510022742/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/11/stuffed_animal_truck_is_the_work_of.php#photo-1">truck filled with mewling stuffed animals</a> all around the city the last couple days, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510022742/http://gothamist.com/tags/banksy">Banksy</a> has opted to go with something less mobile and a bit more concrete for his latest piece. The newest work, which he calls a &quot;Concrete confessional,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510022742/http://www.banksy.co.uk/2013/10/12/manhattan">is located</a> somewhere in Manhattan. You can see a closer photo of it below. </p>
