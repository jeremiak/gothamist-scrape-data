                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="81013sanchez.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130814001519im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/81013sanchez.jpg" width="640" height="477" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>It&apos;s only the NFL preseason, so we know everyone&apos;s rusty, nothing really matters, there&apos;s a lot of time to get into game shape, disclaimer disclaimer etc etc. <em>Having said that</em>, of course <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130814001519/http://gothamist.com/tags/marksanchez">Mark Sanchez</a> would kick off the Jets&apos; year with an interception on his third pass of the game, as you can see in the video below. As Descartes once put it, &quot;I am Mark Sanchez therefore I throw interceptions.&quot;</p>

<p>Quarterback-in-waiting Geno Smith <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130814001519/http://espn.go.com/new-york/nfl/story/_/id/9555239/mark-sanchez-rallies-poor-start-geno-smith-injures-ankle-new-york-jets-preseason-opener">also got injured</a> in the 26-17 loss to the Detroit Lions, though it isn&apos;t expected to be serious. After another near interception, Sanchez (who had a league-high 52 turnovers over the last two seasons) got his bearings, finishing the game 10-for-13 for 125 yards. <strong>&quot;Other than one crappy play, it wasn&apos;t too bad,&quot;</strong> Sanchez said, bashfully summing up his entire Jets career pretty succinctly. </p>
