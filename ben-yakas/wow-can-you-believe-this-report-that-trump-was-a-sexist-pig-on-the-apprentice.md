<p>During one of his ritualistic ethylene-influenced rants this weekend, Donald Trump waxed nostalgic about his time on <em>The Apprentice</em>. &#x201C;Oh, I could be doing <em>The Apprentice</em> right now,&#x201D; Trump said during <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161213014307/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/10/02/as-news-of-trumps-taxes-broke-he-goes-off-script-at-a-rally-in-pennsylvania/">a speech in Pennsylvania</a>, seemingly getting caught up in memories of a more pleasant time in his life when less of America actively loathed him. &quot;I loved it &#x2014; 14 seasons. How good was that? Tremendous success.&quot;</p>

<p>But whether or not he wants to acknowledge it, even the happier moments in Trump&apos;s life are being systematically tarnished by the lamestream media&apos;s &apos;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161213014307/https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/781838706030313472">sources</a>&apos;: in today&apos;s least surprising investigative story of the day, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161213014307/http://bigstory.ap.org/article/2778a6ab72ea49558445337865289508/ap-how-trumps-apprentice-moved-capitalism-sexism?utm_campaign=SocialFlow&amp;utm_source=Twitter&amp;utm_medium=AP">the AP reports that</a> Trump regularly and repeatedly demeaned women with sexist language while on the show&#x2014;that included times he would allegedly rate female contestants by the size of their breasts and talk about which ones he&apos;d like to have sex with.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161213014307/http://bigstory.ap.org/article/2778a6ab72ea49558445337865289508/ap-how-trumps-apprentice-moved-capitalism-sexism?utm_campaign=SocialFlow&amp;utm_source=Twitter&amp;utm_medium=AP">The AP spoke with</a> more than 20 people associated with the show, including crew members and former contestants, about Trump&apos;s lewd and lascivious behavior, and painted a portrait of an overgrown horny frat boy who had created the perfect atmosphere to indulge his own petty desires. </p>

<p>Eight crew members all recalled that Trump &quot;repeatedly made lewd comments about a camerawoman he said had a nice rear, comparing her beauty to that of his daughter, Ivanka.&quot; Multiple cast members said Trump had female contestants twirl for him so he could ogle them; contestant Gene Folkes said Trump demanded female contestants wear shorter dresses that also showed more cleavage.</p>

<p>Former producer Katherine Walker said Trump was obsessed with discussing women&apos;s bodies during her five seasons there, and would speculate about which contestants would be a &quot;tiger in the bed.&quot; </p>

<p>Another crew member who signed a non-disclosure agreement recalled that Trump asked male contestants whether they would sleep with a particular female contestant, then jumped in with his own responses: &quot;We were in the boardroom one time figuring out who to blame for the task, and he just stopped in the middle and pointed to someone and said, &apos;You&apos;d f... her, wouldn&apos;t you? I&apos;d f... her. C&apos;mon, wouldn&apos;t you?,&apos;&quot; the crew member said. &quot;Everyone is trying to make him stop talking, and the woman is shrinking in her seat.&quot;</p>

<p>Randal Pinkett, who won the program in December 2005, said Trump frequently discussed which female contestants he wanted to sleep with: &quot;He was like &apos;Isn&apos;t she hot, check her out,&apos; kind of gawking, something to the effect of &apos;I&apos;d like to hit that.&apos;&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161213014307/http://gothamist.com/2016/09/27/mr_misogyny.php">Accusations of</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161213014307/http://gothamist.com/2016/09/23/clinton_attack_ad_trump_misogyny.php">sexism</a> have followed Trump throughout his presidential campaign. Hope Hicks, the Trump campaign spokeswoman, issued a blanket denial to the AP&apos;s report without getting into detail: &quot;These outlandish, unsubstantiated, and totally false claims fabricated by publicity hungry, opportunistic, disgruntled former employees, have no merit whatsoever,&quot; she said. &quot;<em>The Apprentice</em> was one of the most successful prime-time television shows of all time and employed hundreds of people over many years, many of whom support Mr. Trump&apos;s candidacy.&quot;</p>

<p>It seems like the overwhelming evidence of Trump&apos;s casual misogyny may finally be catching up to him. After last week&apos;s debate&#x2014;in which Hillary Clinton brought up Alicia Machado, the former Miss Universe winner whom Trump called &quot;Miss Piggy&quot; (because she didn&apos;t fit his beauty standards) and &quot;Miss Housekeeping&quot; (because she is Latina)&#x2014;Trump has seen a dip in his poll numbers. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161213014307/http://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/trump-clinton-poll-politico-morning-consult-229038">Politico writes</a> that Trump&apos;s inability to let Machado go, continually mocking her as the week went on, got through to voters:</p>

<blockquote>The episode broke through &#x2014; 74 percent heard of Trump&#x2019;s comments about Machado &#x2014; and it appears to have hurt Trump&apos;s standing with women. Fifty-five percent of women said it gives them a less favorable view of Trump, and 43 percent of voters said the incident makes them less likely to support Trump.</blockquote>

<p>Of course, there&apos;s still the terrifying thought that 45 percent of female voters in their poll are okay with Trump&apos;s disparaging of that woman. </p>
