<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="10310cuomo.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412160326im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/10310cuomo.jpg" width="240" height="240" class="image-left"> </span>After a week where everything in the gubernatorial race between Carl Paladino and Andrew Cuomo took a turn for the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412160326/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/30/paladino_vs_the_ny_post.php">batshit-crazy</a>, there&apos;s a palpable sense that everyone wants to leave the nuttiness behind, and get back to talking about some issues. Well, actually, maybe just <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412160326/http://gothamist.com/2010/10/02/green_party_candidate_thinks_cuomo.php">Howie Hawkins</a> wants to do that. &quot;<strong>He&apos;s a straight and utter nut job. At some point, he&apos;ll accuse all of us of being from Mars</strong>,&quot; Bronx Borough President Ruben Diaz Jr. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412160326/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/10/03/2010-10-03_cuomo_calls_to_keep_race_outta_gutter.html">said of Paladino</a>. </p>

<p>While speaking with Latino leaders on the LES yesterday afternoon, Cuomo discussed the bad vibes of the gubernatorial race: &quot;<strong>These have been some truly negative, degrading comments and I have worked very hard not to go there</strong>...If [Paladino] wants to go there, he&apos;s going to go there alone.&quot; But then he let Diaz, and his predecessor Freddy Ferrer, do the bad talking for him during their endorsement announcement: Paladino <strong>&quot;raises the bar&quot;</strong> on the phrase, &quot;You have to be a little crazy to be in politics,&quot; said Ferrer. Well, if Paladino can brazenely make allegations that Cuomo cheated on his ex-wife, then <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412160326/http://gothamist.com/2010/10/01/paladino_cuomo_affair_allegations.php">take it back</a> admitting he has no evidence, we suppose Cuomo is allowed a moment of surrogate badmouthing. After all, everyone gets one, right <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412160326/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALmQZXza2Rs&amp;feature=related">Spiderman</a>?</p>

<p>Oh, but about those aforementioned issues: Buffalo News has a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412160326/http://www.buffalonews.com/city/article208660.ece">breakdown of differences</a> between the two pol&apos;s stated policies (with a particular focus on upstate NY politics). And both candidates took time out this week to lay out <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412160326/http://www.bizjournals.com/albany/stories/2010/09/27/daily23.html">their economic policies</a>, although Paladino, with his usual grace, was able to turn a dry policy discussion into <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412160326/http://albany.bizjournals.com/albany/blog/2010/09/cuomo_and_paladino_square_off_on_job_creation.html">an attack on Cuomo</a>: &#x201C;<strong>Hiring Andrew Cuomo to create jobs is like asking a ballet dancer to do brain surgery</strong>. Andrew Cuomo&#x2019;s jobs plan is just more empty promises from another career politician who has never created a job in his life.&#x201D;</p>
