<p>America&apos;s Most Beloved Thespian, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150409201651/http://gothamist.com/tags/tomhanks">Tom Hanks</a>, has been on quite a roll lately: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150409201651/http://laist.com/2012/10/19/tom_hanks_drops_an_f-bomb_on_live_t.php">dropping F-bombs</a> on <em>Good Morning America</em>, pulling out a Long Island accent <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150409201651/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/21/videos_saturday_night_live_welcomes.php#photo-1">on <em>SNL</em></a>, growing curious facial hair <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150409201651/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/11/tom_hanks_to_make_broadway_debut_in.php">for Broadway</a>, taking <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150409201651/http://laist.com/2012/08/27/fan_photos_why_tom_hanks_is_awesome.php#photo-1">hilarious photos with fans</a>.
