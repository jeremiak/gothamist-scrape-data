										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="31810nanny.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422144135im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/31810nanny.jpg" width="100" height="134" class="image-left"> </span>In the wake of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422144135/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/17/taxi_scam_unraveled_with_help_of_ea.php">Great Taxi Scandal</a>, more reports are coming out about the whistle-blowers who helped uncover the nefarious scheme. Along with Dr. Mitchell Lee, Heather Schueppert, a business consultant from the Upper East Side, was the other person to complain about being overcharged for taxi rides that led to the investigation that blew the lid off the scam, the Post <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422144135/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/second_person_blew_whistle_on_cab_x56lDOZKVGBeBYWtLSs0wL">reports</a>. But she wasn&apos;t actually the person in the taxi driven by Wasim Khalid Cheema (who allegedly overcharged 574 passengers); her nanny was, and Schueppert noticed the overcharges on the taxi <em>receipt</em> of her weekly trip from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422144135/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/01/rip_off_artist_cabbie_nets_40000_fr.php">Manhattan to Queens</a> last summer.</p>

<p>On the receipt, it showed that the nanny had been charged a Rate 4 for part of the ride, which corresponds to Westchester/Nassau County rates; what should have been a $12.20 fare came to $20.20. Schueppert reported it, and after a ten minute meeting with a lawyer from the Taxi and Limousine Commission, the discrepancies were revealed and her work was done. The taxi scam led to over $8 million in overcharges to NYC passengers. </p>
