<p>Police are questioning a suspect after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508140129/http://nypost.com/2014/04/20/body-found-in-plastic-bin-on-brooklyn-street/">a body was found</a> stuffed in a plastic storage container in the middle of a street in Brooklyn. According to cops, a passer-by made the discovery in front of a home on East 54th Street in Flatlands at about 12:30 p.m. Saturday. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508140129/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2014/04/19/police-questioning-suspect-after-body-found-stuffed-in-storage-container/">According to CBS</a>, a Brooklyn nightclub owner called police to report that a bouncer at the club admitted to him that he&#x2019;d killed a man.</p>

<p>Police have not identified the suspect. &#x201C;Somebody was killed over there by somebody they knew and we have nothing to worry about,&#x201D; neighbor Lynn Kerschner said police told her.</p>

<p>Neighbor Chris Savareace told CBS that he was friends with the victim, who goes by the nickname Chino. &quot;I don&#x2019;t know what made somebody so mad to do that to him. I heard they put him in a box, that&#x2019;s what I heard from the cops. There&#x2019;s some kind of people in the world that really ain&#x2019;t that with it anymore,&quot; he said.</p>
