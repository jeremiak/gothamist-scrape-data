<p>Last week, Deadspin <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141114144122/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/05/did_mark_sanchez_romance_a_17-year-.php">gave notice</a> that they had been working on a story involving an alleged romance between a 17-year-old and Jets QB Mark Sanchez. On Tuesday, the details of that story were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141114144122/http://deadspin.com/#!5755011/the-somewhat-romantic-story-of-mark-sanchez-and-a-17+year+old-girl">finally revealed</a>, and ever since, debate has been raging about Sanchez&apos;s behavior, his morality, her illegality, and more. But we&apos;ve been wondering: what exactly is this story about?</p>

<p>The tale of their brief romance, as told by 17-year-old E.K. (now revealed to be Eliza Kruger), is pretty simple and benign-sounding: she met Sanchez on New Years Eve at a night club, they had at least one dinner date and one sleepover at Sanchez&apos;s place in Jersey, and Sanchez would text her from time to time after that. There are a couple pictures of Sanchez&apos;s room (Kruger would be blacklisted from the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141114144122/http://gothamist.com/2010/12/26/the_changing_face_of_sports_groupie.php">Ballers Alert club</a> for such shenanigans), and she says they &quot;hooked up,&quot; which doesn&apos;t say much.  Surprisingly, there are very little in the way of lurid details, and seemingly no dark revenge motivations under the surface; reading between the lines, 24-year-old Sanchez comes off mostly as a gentleman, or as she said, &quot;one of the kindest people, and he&apos;s a genuine person.&quot; </p>

<p>Furthermore, anyone who saw <em>Hard Knocks</em> last summer knows that Sanchez comes across as a very young 24; he&apos;s someone <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141114144122/http://gothamist.com/2010/08/23/mark_sanchez_stud_or_dork.php">who tweets</a> about Disney movies and loves Broadway musicals. His attraction to a younger (but still legal) girl seems in-line with his personality. Most importantly, based on Kruger&apos;s account, nothing he did was illegal: the age of consent in NY is 17, and 16 in New Jersey.  </p>

<p>But controversy has swelled around the report: some newspapers and commenters have argued that Sanchez has shown <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141114144122/http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2011/02/09/sanchezs-relationship-with-17-year-old-girl-shows-bad-judgment-no-wrongdoing/related">bad judgement</a>, that he&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141114144122/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2011/02/09/report-sanchez-romantically-linked-to-teenager/">hurting his image</a>, that he&apos;s bringing undue negative attention on the Jets (who already have had a bounty of negative press), or that it&apos;s just <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141114144122/http://www.nj.com/jets/index.ssf/2011/02/your_jets_comments_report_on_a.html">creepy</a> to date someone so young. Others, such as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141114144122/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/jet_set_party_mom_aCxVsCzSVKGThZYAhfNPTN?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">the Post</a>, have attacked the character of Kruger, with gossipy tidbits such as this: &quot;&apos;<strong>Eliza has been going to clubs since she was 15, sometimes with her mom</strong>,&apos; blond Greenwich divorc&#xE9;e Marie McCormick Kruger, a night life source told The Post. &apos;A lot of the club guys in the city know her mom well,&apos; the source said.&quot;</p>

<p>So did we need to know this story? Does this story teach us anything about the (admittedly) immature Sanchez that we didn&apos;t know before? Was Kruger <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141114144122/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/blogs/abraham/detail?entry_id=82797">lured</a> into revealing her story, or did she willingly, perhaps even actively, open herself up to Deadspin, and the ensuing criticism? There&apos;s certainly a lot to consider, even with the bare-bones of what we&apos;ve been told happened. There&apos;s one last thing that has stuck with us: during  <em>Hard Knocks</em>, back-up QB Mark Brunell <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141114144122/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/02/09/AR2011020904866.html">discussed how strange</a> it was that his own daughter was only five years younger than Sanchez, the same age as Kruger. But he wasn&apos;t bringing her to training camp anytime soon: &quot;No, that won&apos;t happen. He&apos;s not meeting my daughter. She already thinks he&apos;s cute. She saw a picture of him, but that&apos;s not happening at all. <strong>I like the kid, but I don&apos;t like him that much.&quot; </strong></p>
