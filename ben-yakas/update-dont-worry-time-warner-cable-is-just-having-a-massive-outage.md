<p><strong>Update 2:55 p.m.</strong>: Time Warner Cable says that the outages should be fixed now:</p>

<blockquote>Earlier today, some Time Warner Cable Internet customers in the Northeast experienced intermittent issues accessing several popular websites due to technical issues with one of our network backbone providers. Traffic has been re-routed, and our customers should be able to access their favorite websites again. We apologize for the disruption to their service.</blockquote>
