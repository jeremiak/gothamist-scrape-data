<p>At the end of the rollercoaster ride that was 2016, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021072839/http://gothamist.com/tags/kanyewest">Kanye West</a> seemed to finally tip over the line between misunderstood genius and incoherent narcissist when he visited Trump Tower to meet Donald Trump and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021072839/http://gothamist.com/2016/12/13/kanye_west_trump_tower.php#photo-1">pose for awkward photos in the lobby.</a> West later <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021072839/http://chicagoist.com/2016/12/13/sources_kanye_west_met_donald_trump.php">tried to spin it</a> as his attempt to get on the ground floor of Trump&apos;s administration to talk violence in Chicago, but a significant portion of his fan base was thoroughly disappointed in him. But it seems that West has taken a page <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021072839/http://internet.gawker.com/facebook-user-asif-ends-friendship-with-mudasir-welc-1731160013">from Asif</a> and has ended his burgeoning friendship with Trump</p>

<p>Today, West deleted all Tweets he made referencing Trump and their ill-fated meeting in December (sample: &quot;I feel it is important to have a direct line of communication with our future President if we truly want change.&quot;). <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021072839/http://www.tmz.com/2017/02/06/kanye-west-donald-trump-tweets/">According to TMZ</a>, the first weeks of Trump&apos;s presidency, and in particular the immigration and refugee ban that focused on largely-Muslim countries, tipped him over the edge (though he hasn&apos;t said anything publicly <em>yet</em>). </p>

<p>It couldn&apos;t have helped that in recent weeks, Trump has upped his rhetoric about Chicago, vaguely threatening to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021072839/http://chicagoist.com/2017/01/24/trump_says_hell_send_in_feds_unless.php">send the Feds in</a>, pulling funds <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021072839/http://chicagoist.com/2017/01/25/trump_will_pull_federal_funds_from.php">from Sanctuary Cities</a>, and slamming the city again by calling the violence there <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021072839/http://chicagoist.com/2017/02/01/trump_slams_chicago_again_during_bl.php">&quot;out of control.&quot;</a></p>

<p>The move is better late than never, but West really alienated a lot of people&#x2014;including friends such <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021072839/http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x558wwn_exclusive-john-legend-reacts-to-kanye-west-s-meeting-with-donald-trump_music">as John Legend</a>&#x2014;with his deeply-misguided support for Trump initially. It won&apos;t be easy for everyone to get this image out of their minds.</p>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">&quot;We&apos;ve been friends for a long time&quot; &#x2014; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021072839/https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump">@realdonaldtrump</a> after meeting with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021072839/https://twitter.com/kanyewest">@kanyewest</a> at Trump Tower this morning. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021072839/https://t.co/G45NzXNYje">pic.twitter.com/G45NzXNYje</a></p>&#x2014; BuzzFeed News (@BuzzFeedNews) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021072839/https://twitter.com/BuzzFeedNews/status/808691131835785217">December 13, 2016</a></blockquote>

<p>But this is still a better friendship breakup than that time Kanye&apos;s cousin stole his laptop and then blackmailed him.</p>
