                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="11913bloomblasio.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20131112051949im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/11913bloomblasio.jpg" width="640" height="454" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131112051949/http://gothamist.com/tags/bloomberg">Mayor Bloomberg</a> hasn&apos;t exactly been the biggest supporter of Bill de Blasio, what with the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131112051949/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/07/bloomberg_calls_bill_de_blasio_camp.php">charges of racist campaigning</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131112051949/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/06/bloomberg_meets_with_de_blasio_at_c.php">generally unenthusiastic attitude</a>. As Fran Leibowitz <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131112051949/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/18/watch_fran_lebowitz_hilariously_psy.php">might say</a>, maybe it&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131112051949/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/10/how_much_taller_is_bill_de_blasio_t.php">a height thing</a>&#x2014;but let bygone be bygones! Bloomberg promised he would try his darndest not to undermine de Blasio during his first year in office.</p>

<p>&#x201C;I will not criticize,&#x201D; he said <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131112051949/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/09/nyregion/bloomberg-vows-not-to-criticize-the-de-blasio-administration.html?ref=nyregion">during his weekly radio appearance yesterday</a>. &#x201C;These jobs are tough enough without an extra voice criticizing you. In the first year in particular, when you&#x2019;re a new mayor, you just don&#x2019;t need a previous mayor criticizing, and Rudy [Giuliani] never once did,&#x201D; Bloomberg said.</p>

<p>&#x201C;I think the way [Giuliani] conducted himself after the new administration took over says a lot about his character,&quot; he added. &quot;I&#x2019;m sure there are plenty of things I did that he didn&#x2019;t like, that he wanted to stand up there and yell and scream. But he didn&#x2019;t and I won&#x2019;t. I will not criticize.&#x201D; Does this mean in lieu of criticism, Bloomberg will truly embrace the phrase &quot;Guiliani-esque&quot; and start referring to 9/11 in every public appearance he makes? Or is he just going <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131112051949/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/19/rudy_giuliani_now_an_identity_theft.php">to start selling LifeLock</a>?</p>
