<p>Donald Trump&apos;s first days as commander-in-chief have been marked by brazen lying, unfounded <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170128183931/http://gothamist.com/2017/01/25/president_gaslight_promises.php">conspiracy theories</a>, and numerous disturbing White House leaks about how he&apos;s difficult to control and prone to watching lots of TV when he&apos;s bored. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170128183931/http://gothamist.com/tags/sethmeyers">Seth Meyers</a> could relate to this: &quot;I hear you, I deal with the same issue with my son,&quot; he said. &quot;He&apos;s nine months old, and we&apos;re trying to observe a no-screens rule, but sometimes he gets cranky and the only thing that works is Dora the Explorer. So, been there.&quot;</p>

<p>The parallels between Trump and toddlers doesn&apos;t end there. Trump has only been in office for five days, and already he feels &quot;demoralized&quot; by the public perception of him: &quot;It seems like most of that time has been spent signing giant documents and then showing people that you signed them,&quot; Meyers joked. &quot;It&apos;s like how you read a book to kids.&quot; </p>

<p>And then there&apos;s Trump&apos;s refusal to focus on the job at hand: &quot;Just let that sink in: the president&apos;s aides had to urge him to &apos;focus on the responsibilities of his office.&apos; What&apos;s it going to be like in an actual crisis? &apos;Mr. President, North Korea has fired a nuke,&apos;&quot; Meyers said, launching into his Trump impression. &quot;&apos;Hold on, Dora and Boots are helping a baby fish find its mother. So there&apos;s a lot going on.&apos;&quot;</p>

<p>Watch as Meyers takes a closer look at all this, plus Trump&apos;s untrustworthiness on anything policy-related and his inability to &quot;enjoy&quot; his time at the White House.</p>
