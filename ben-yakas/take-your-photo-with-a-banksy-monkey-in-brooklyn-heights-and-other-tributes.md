Do you suffer from shoe shine fatigue, grim reaper nostalgia, or balloon separation anxiety? Then you probably are going through <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507080045/http://gothamist.com/tags/banksy">Banksy</a> withdrawal, just like us! And there&apos;s only so many times that you can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507080045/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/01/banksy_retrospective_all_31_pieces.php">rank and re-rank all 31 pieces</a> from his now finished open air street art tour of our city. But fret not, for many a soul around NYC is in the same boat&#x2014;and some have channeled that energy into creating some neat tributes to NYC&apos;s favorite tourist.</p>

<p>The most elaborate of these is the Banksy Monkey (photos 1 and 2) who was spotted hanging out on the Brooklyn Promenade in Brooklyn Heights this morning by a tipster. There&apos;s also the Bloomberg rat on the corner of Hicks and Union Streets in Carroll Gardens (photos 3 and 4), and the &quot;Banksy Drew This. Put Plexi Over It&quot; drawing as well (photo 5).</p>

<p>And of course, you probably saw dozens of Banksy-inspired costumes over the last week, including <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507080045/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/25/hallowmeme_meme_photos_costume.php#photo-9">his New York accent</a>, his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507080045/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/01/photos_133_amazing_halloween_costum.php#photo-4">iconic Flower Thrower</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507080045/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/30/be_elusive_street_artist_banky_for.php">Ricky&apos;s costume</a>, and even <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507080045/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/27/photos_dope_dogs_in_cool_costumes_a.php#photo-27">Barksy.</a> We offered <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507080045/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/28/how_to_be_dumb_new_york_things_for.php">our own tips</a> on how to dress as Banksy for Halloween, and Judy Pham was inspired enough to create her own Balloon Girl costume (photos 6 and 7): &quot;I especially liked the article about Halloween costume ideas and how to look like Banksy.  I thought it was really funny but it actually inspired me to go as the &quot;There&apos;s Always Hope&quot; Balloon Girl,&quot; she wrote us.</p>
