Everything&apos;s been coming up <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144428/http://gothamist.com/tags/beyonce">Beyonce</a> lately&#x2014;there have been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144428/http://gothamist.com/2013/12/13/beyday_beyonce_surprises_fans_with.php">pretty <strike>awesome</strike> surfboard new albums</a>, rapturous concerts, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144428/http://gothamist.com/2013/12/16/beyonces_new_coney_island-themed_vi.php">addictive music videos</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144428/http://iam.beyonce.com/post/70740910979/cute">adorable imitators</a>, and even <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144428/http://gothamist.com/2013/12/20/watch_beyonce_drink_shots_and_party.php">celebratory trips to Dave &amp; Buster&apos;s</a>. It feels like Beyonce has figured out how to nail it (it being <em>everything</em>)&#x2014;but as she explained to the crowd at the School of Visual Arts yesterday, putting this album together was a real challenge: &quot;I was terrified. I was so scared. I already envisioned like the worst things that could happen,&quot; Beyonce said. &quot;I was really nervous because this was a huge risk.&quot;</p>

<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="//web.archive.org/web/20150506144428if_/http://www.youtube.com/embed/wN1Yp3-ha3A" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>As you can see in the video above, Beyonce spoke during a screening for her (17) new music videos. Considering the fact that the self-titled album has sold more than a million copies worldwide in the last week&#x2014;and most of them from digital sales&#x2014;she perhaps didn&apos;t need to be so worried. </p>

<p>&quot;I took all of my insecurities, all of my doubts, all of my fears and everything I&apos;ve learned over the 17 years and I applied it into this project,&quot; she said. &quot;But more than the music &#x2014; I&apos;m proud of myself as a woman ... the biggest message is owning your imperfections and all the things that make you interesting, because I refuse to allow someone to put me in anyone&apos;s box.&quot;</p>

<p>Among other things, she said she wanted to emulate Madonna being &quot;a powerhouse and [having] my own empire,&quot; and to show women they don&apos;t have to compromise or rely on others in their careers. She also spoke about how becoming a mother has inspired her: &quot;I&apos;m very private and I&apos;m very respectful, and I think it just took me no longer being someone&apos;s child &#x2014; once I became a mother, I felt like I could tear those fourth walls and I just felt like it was time,&quot; she said. &quot;I completely feel liberated.&quot;</p>
