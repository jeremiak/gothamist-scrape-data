<p>All you have to do is type &quot;Festivus&quot; into Google, and you&apos;ll see the beloved, tinsel-free pole on the left side of the screen. A Google spokesperson <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425172856/http://insidetv.ew.com/2012/12/11/google-festivus/">told EW</a>: &#x201C;If you&#x2019;re not big on the holidays, don&#x2019;t forget there&#x2019;s a Festivus for the rest of us. No tinsel, just a sturdy pole. Good luck if you&#x2019;re chosen for the Feats of Strength.&#x201D; Festivus actually falls on December 23rd, so you still have plenty of time to get your grievances in order. In the meantime, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425172856/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/03/barrel_rolls_tilt_pig_latin_and_oth.php">enjoy some more Google easter eggs.</a></p>
