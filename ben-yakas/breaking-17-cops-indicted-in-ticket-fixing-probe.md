<p>As <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430235929/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/20/grand_jury_gets_ready_to_decide_on.php">was expected</a>, 17 NYPD officers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430235929/http://www.dnainfo.com/20110923/manhattan/17-cops-indicted-ticketfixing-probe-face-arrest-next-week">have been indicted</a> by a Bronx grand jury as part of the ongoing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430235929/http://gothamist.com/tags/ticketfixing">ticket-fixing investigation.</a> DNAInfo reports that the officers are expected to be arrested next week on charges including perjury, bribery, rewarding official misconduct, and grand larceny. </p>

<p>In addition to the ticket-fixing, many cops will be charged with more serious crimes that were revealed as a result of the probe, including accusations of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430235929/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/16/cops_facing_drug-profit_charges_as.php">collecting drug-profits.</a> Adding to the web of corruption, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430235929/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/23/nyregion/ticket-fixing-inquiry-grows-into-scandal-on-police-leaks.html?_r=1&amp;partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">NY Times reported this morning</a><a> that officials believe there have been leaks between the Internal Affairs Bureau and union officials which got in the way of the investigation, which may be &quot;the most damning of the departmental weaknesses unearthed to date in the ticket-fixing investigation.&quot;</a></p><a>

I never asked for money to fix summons, I never asked for a favor to fix a summons. <strong>It is a courtesy. You might as well indict this whole department. It is a widespread epidemic</strong>.&quot; And <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430235929/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/20/oh_duh_ticket-fixing_has_always_exi.php">earlier this year</a>, the president of the Sergeants Benevolent Association, the union for the NYPD&apos;s 12,000 front-line supervisors, vigorously defended &quot;the culture of extending courtesies to members and their families within the NYPD.&quot;</p>
