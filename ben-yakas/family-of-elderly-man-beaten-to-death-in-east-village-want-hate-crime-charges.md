<p>The family of an elderly man who was fatally beaten in the East Village this past Friday want his death to be treated as a hate crime. Ruan Wen Hui, 68, was allegedly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430043341/http://gothamist.com/2014/05/13/east_village_beating_suspect.php">beaten to death</a> by Jamie Pugh, 20, around 8:45 p.m. Friday night on East 6th Street near Avenue D. &#x201C;Our whole family is in severe and deep pain,&#x201D; Michelle Ruan, a daughter of victim Wen Hui Ruan, said through a translator <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430043341/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/chinese-man-family-hate-crime-charges-nyc-murder-article-1.1792426">according tot he News</a>. &quot;We want the suspect to have the proper kind of penalty so that we feel safe to walk on the street. We demand a life [sentence].&quot;</p>

<p>Pugh&apos;s mother, Charlotte Pugh-Douglas, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430043341/http://gothamist.com/2014/05/14/suspect_was_high_on_molly_before_al.php">said in court yesterday that</a> someone had slipped Molly into her son&apos;s drink at a party Friday evening. &#x201C;He wasn&#x2019;t in his right state of mind,&#x201D; she said, adding that her son didn&apos;t remember the attack, and only became aware of it when a friend showed him the surveillance footage and noted the attacker looked like him. &quot;When he saw the video, it killed him inside. It hurt him. He was crying all weekend. He knows it&#x2019;s him. He just didn&#x2019;t remember.&quot;</p>

<p>Pugh&apos;s defense lawyer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430043341/http://nypost.com/2014/05/14/mom-says-son-was-high-on-molly-during-east-village-attack/">tried to distance</a> his client from her claims, saying she didn&apos;t have firsthand knowledge of the attack, or her son&apos;s sobriety: &quot;She&#x2019;s speaking as a panicked mother who&#x2019;s saying that if this [charge] is in fact true, then someone must have drugged him, because that&#x2019;s not who her son is,&quot; attorney Frank Rothman said. Pugh has been charged with second degree murder, assault, and robbery.</p>

<p>After releasing a blurry photo of Pugh over the weekend, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430043341/http://gothamist.com/2014/05/11/graphic_video_of_man_beating_68-yr-.php">graphic surveillance video</a> of the incident leaked out. Police were tipped off to Pugh&apos;s location by someone in the neighborhood Tuesday night who saw that video. &quot;We would especially like to thank the citizens who called in phone tips,&quot; Ruan added. &quot;We hope this case will move quickly through the court system and the guilty are punished to the [fullest] extent of the law.&quot;</p>
