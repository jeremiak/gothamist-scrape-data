<p>Cornel West and more than a dozen other Occupy Wall Street protesters <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120106014746/http://twitpic.com/73o1er">were arrested</a> today in Harlem during a civil disobedience protest against the NYPD&apos;s stop-and-frisk policy. The protest took place outside the 28th Precinct at West 123rd Street and Frederick Douglass Boulevard, as a substantial group of protesters led by West <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120106014746/http://twitter.com/#!/johnknefel/status/127445492283088896">chanted</a>, &quot;Stop &amp; frisk don&apos;t stop the crime. Stop &amp; frisk IS the crime.&quot;</p>

<p>When he was speaking to the assembled protesters, Cornel West <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120106014746/http://twitter.com/#!/johnknefel/status/127444761094270976">said at one point</a>: &quot;We need to bear witness to injustice. If cops need to take us to jail, take us to jail.&quot; Protesters locked arms just before police started making arrests, according <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120106014746/http://twitter.com/#!/LucyKafanov/status/127450903623118848">to Lucy Kafanov</a>: &quot;Carl Dix, Colonel West and others join hands as #NYPD moves in.&quot; </p>

<p>According <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120106014746/http://twitter.com/#!/nyclu/status/127461949024899072">to the NYCLU</a>, &quot;white shirts say total of 32 arrested&quot; altogether in Harlem. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120106014746/http://twitter.com/#!/johnknefel/status/127461164723613696">John Knefel</a>, who was on the scene at the protest all day, gives an update on what&apos;s happening now: &quot;Cornel West Carl Dix &amp; rest being held at 33rd precinct. 169 &amp; amsterdam. we&apos;re marching there.&quot; </p>

<p>The march against the NYPD&apos;s stop-and-frisk policy came a day after several elected officials <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120106014746/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/20/city_officials_call_for_fed_probe_i.php">called for</a> a federal probe into the policy, and the same week that an eight year NYPD veteran <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120106014746/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/17/staten_island_cop_arrested_allegedl_1.php">was arrested and charged with</a> civil rights violations in connection with a racially-charged stop-and-frisk arrest on Staten Island. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120106014746/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/01/cop_stop_and_frisk_racial-profiling.php">More than</a> 317,000 people were stopped between January 1 and June 30, an increase of almost 14 percent from last year.</p>

<p><strong>Update 3:45 p.m.</strong>: Protesters have splintered off into two groups&#x2014;one headed back downtown to Zuccotti Park, while the other has been marching through Harlem toward the 33rd Precinct as you can see in the picture below.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120106014746/http://twitter.com/#!/johnknefel/status/127462576991895552">According to Knefel</a>, &quot;Picking up supporters. Several hundred march&#x2014;&apos;We say no to new Jim Crow, stop &amp; frisk has got to go.&apos;&quot;</p>
