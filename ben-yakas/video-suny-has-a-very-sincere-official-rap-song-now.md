<p>There comes a point in every state university&apos;s existence when they must forgo the marching songs of their storied history and embrace dubstep and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130403054303/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mFMiTcFdNQ">the New Pornographers</a>. And for SUNY, the State University of New York, that time has come now: below, you can watch &#x201C;SUNY Anthem,&#x201D; by B. Martin, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130403054303/http://soundcloud.com/bmartinofficial">the man behind</a> &#x201C;Drippin&#x2019; Wet&#x201D; and &#x201C;Shake it from Behind.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Spokesman David Doyle <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130403054303/http://blog.timesunion.com/capitol/archives/179600/sunys-official-rap-song-costs-3000/">told Capitol Confidential</a> that Martin mostly paid for and produced the video himself, but the university contributed $3,000 to &#x201C;partially supplement the artist&#x2019;s production costs for the music video.&#x201D; He added that you better get used to the song, because it will be incorporated into broader marketing and outreach efforts.</p>

<p>So the song is kind of awkward in its attempts to inspire school pride and name all the various SUNY locations during various roll calls (Farmingdale! Oneonta! Cortland!)&#x2014;but at the same time, kudos to Martin for having such passion about his university. If it wasn&apos;t for this tune, we never would have known that the president of Nike went to SUNY.</p>
