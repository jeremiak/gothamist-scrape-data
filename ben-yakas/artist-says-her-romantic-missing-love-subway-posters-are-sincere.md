title: Artist Says Her Romantic 'Missing Love' Subway Posters Are Sincere

                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="2914missinglove.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20140303020444im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/2914missinglove.jpg" width="640" height="480"> <br> <i> Left, via Facebook; right via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140303020444/http://instagram.com/p/kNCmdphy_I/">1anaangeles Instagram</a></i></div> <p></p>

<p>Even the most jaded of Gothamist staffers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140303020444/http://gothamist.com/tags/love">has been swayed</a> at one point by the twists and turns of Cupid&apos;s arrow. Who are we to say people can&apos;t fall in love with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140303020444/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/10/when_a_man_loves_a_mannequin.php">mannequins</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140303020444/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/13/video_the_statue_of_libertys_girlfr.php">the Statue of Liberty</a>? Or that romance can&apos;t be found <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140303020444/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/12/it_turns_out_that_getting_married_a.php">in an IKEA</a> or at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140303020444/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/21/mans_marriage_proposal_in_a_megabus.php">Port Authority</a>? So we are willing to believe that artist Maria Luisa Portuondo Vila is sincere when she says <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140303020444/http://gothamist.com/2014/02/09/missing_love_subway_posters_are_an.php">she put up her &quot;Missing Love&quot; subway posters</a> because she truly wants to find the be-hatted man of her dreams: &quot;Yes I will be really happy if I find him,&quot; she told us by email. &quot;I just want give him the drawing that I had for him.&quot;</p>

<p>Vila, a 30-year-old installation and performance artist from Chile who moved to the city five months ago, says she ran into the mysterious man in November. &quot;I saw this boy in the subway and he was really beautiful,&quot; she told us. &quot;I wanted give him a drawing with my mail and web page but when I [got] close to him a lot of people [were] getting into the wagon and I lost him.&quot; She said she was frustrated that she didn&apos;t pounce on the man as he was sneezing: &quot;It was my moment!!!&quot;</p>

<p>Villa, who says she currently &quot;works with brands like Converse&quot; on projects, had an artist do a sketch of the man, and printed up 300 posters with his description with the help of designer Andy Dockett. She said it was a coincidence that she started putting them up a week before Valentine&apos;s Day, and her friends have been on her case about the project: &quot;I have a lot of friends who tell me you&#x2019;re crazy [and] that this is weird. Poor man!&#x201D; she <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140303020444/http://pix11.com/2014/02/10/woman-searching-for-missinglove-lost-in-nyc-subway/#axzz2szXldVdu">told WPIX</a>. &quot;But I&#x2019;m like no, this is not crazy&#x2014;it&#x2019;s romantic.&quot;</p>

<p>Of course, it&apos;s not so romantic when a person <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140303020444/http://gothamist.com/2012/08/28/man_is_desperately_seeking_sofia_le.php">scrawls manifestos to their lost loves</a>, but context is key here. We asked her why she was promoting <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140303020444/https://www.facebook.com/missingloveNY">the project on Facebook</a> as an &quot;art action&quot; if this isn&apos;t just a way of drumming up publicity for her brand: &quot;When I talk under the action art concept I want to say: this is an action, a verb, a artistic event. But behind personal and artistic reasons.&quot;</p>

<p>So we want to believe she&apos;s sincere, and not that everything uplifting on the Internet is the product of some hoax concocted in somebody&apos;s lonely basement or lonely viral marketing conference room. Of course, the joke is probably on all of us, since her lost love was already located by Tim Burton nine years-ago:</p>
