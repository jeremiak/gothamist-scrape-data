<p>We started today with the grim news that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151108083315/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/19/two_people_killed_another_hurt_in_t.php">two more people had been killed, and a third had been seriously injured</a>, in subway-related incidents between late Friday and early this morning. But we&apos;ll end the day on a decidedly happier note: at least one person was saved from that same fate thanks to a good Samaritan named Ramiro. &quot;I witnessed an elderly man fall into the tracks,&quot; Felicia Greenfield told us. &quot;Ramiro jumped right in and pulled him out without a moment&apos;s hesitation.&quot;</p>

<p>The incident happened around 4 p.m. on Friday at the Lexington Avenue / 59th Street Station in Manhattan. Greenfield says she was with her 7-year-old daughter at the station when the elderly man fell and Ramiro sprang into action. &quot;He was truly amazing,&quot; she said. &quot;Didn&apos;t hesitate for a second, jumped right down and practically threw the older man up onto the platform (a few others helped grab and pull him up).&quot; </p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="11913ramiro2.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20151108083315im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/11913ramiro2.jpg" width="640" height="480"> <br> <i> Felicia Greenfield</i></div> <p></p>

<p>Although she wasn&apos;t sure how much time passed until the next train arrived, she said &quot;once both men were up on the platform, a few of us were still trying to move them away from the edge, realizing they could have both slipped back down, they were so close.&quot; In the process of helping the elderly man, Ramiro hurt his knee getting himself back up. &quot;It was when I bent down next to Ramiro, to ask him to roll away from the edge, that I saw the excruciating pain on his face, while he was clutching his knee,&quot; she told us. She called EMS, but left before Ramiro was treated. </p>

<p>As for the older man who fell, he only stayed to be treated after Ramiro and other onlookers &quot;very nicely kept telling him to STAY and get checked out.&quot; Once EMS got there, he refused treatment and then left the station: &quot;He was most likely just senile,&quot; she said, &quot;but I have no doubt [he] will fall again in the future. Hopefully not requiring anyone else to risk their life.&quot;</p>

<p>We&apos;ve contacted Ramiro to get his perspective on the incident. But Greenfield said she was so impressed because he made &quot;a major event look like nothing special. I kept wondering what the rest of his day was going to be like. He didn&apos;t seem the type to post his heroism on Facebook, so I just wanted him to get a little acknowledgment. <strong>Although I&apos;d never want my daughter to jump in the tracks, I loved her getting to see a true everyday hero in action.&quot;</strong></p>
