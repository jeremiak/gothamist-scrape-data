According to a new <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150828132742/http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2011/05/27/cnn-poll-gop-2012-field-still-up-in-the-air/">CNN poll</a> today, Giuliani is the top candidate among potential 2012 GOP candidates&#x2014;although the larger story is how ridiculously unenthusiastic voters are about all the potential candidates, ever since <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150828132742/http://gothamist.com/tags/donaldtrump">titan of combover industries</a> dropped out of his fake presidential run.</p>

<p>Giuliani led the poll with 16 percent of Republican-leaning voters&apos; support; he&apos;s followed closely by Mitt Romney, with 15 percent, and Sarah Palin, with 13 percent. U.S. politics expert Darrell West of the Brookings Institution told the News: &quot;Mayor Giuliani runs well in the presidential poll because he is well-known and respected among a substantial number of GOP voters. However, the same thing was true early in the 2008 campaign, and Giuliani was not able to maintain his momentum.&quot; Well, maybe if they just <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150828132742/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/26/is_rudy_giuliani_eyeing_another_uns.php">&quot;let Rudy be Rudy&quot;</a><a>, he <em>would</em> be able to fill that Donald Trump-sized hole in Republican voters&apos; hearts!</a></p><a>

</a><p><a>For what it&apos;s worth, it is looking more and more likely that Giuliani may attempt to run again&#x2014;he does already have a </a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150828132742/http://thenewcivilrightsmovement.com/2012-is-rudy-giuliani-all-a-twitter-that-hes-running-for-president/politics/2011/05/26/20909">fake 2012 Twitter account</a> after all, so half his work is done. But the big question is <strike>whether</strike> when Palin will announce her incredibly likely run: &quot;The big shoe waiting to drop is Sarah Palin. If she runs, it will completely alter the race and throw off all previous bets.&quot; Some are still holidng out hope that one of our local pol&apos;s, either NJ&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150828132742/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/27/christie_pulls_nj_out_of_cap_trade.php">Chris Christie</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150828132742/http://twitter.com/#!/azipaybarah/status/74075851733475328">Mayor Bloomberg</a>, may be the Elephant party&apos;s savior. After all, with a field of candidates like they have currently, clinging to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150828132742/http://www.runmikerun.com/">false hope</a> seems as good an idea as any.</p>
