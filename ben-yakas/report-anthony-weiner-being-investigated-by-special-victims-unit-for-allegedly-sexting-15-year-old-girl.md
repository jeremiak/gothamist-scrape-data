<p>Yesterday, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170316053010/http://gothamist.com/2016/09/21/anthony_t_dog_weiner_sext.php">it was reported</a> that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170316053010/http://gothamist.com/tags/anthonyweiner">Anthony Weiner</a> had sexted with a 15-year-old girl for months via various social media messaging services. Now, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170316053010/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3801083/NYPD-Special-Victims-Unit-launches-investigation-Anthony-Weiner-DailyMail-com-reveals-line-sexting-relationship-15-year-old-girl.html">Daily Mail reports</a> that the NYPD&apos;s Special Victims Unit is investigating the matter, and Weiner could face criminal charges for the relationship with the minor.</p>

<p>The NYPD press office would not comment when asked to confirm the SVU investigation.</p>

<p>The girl and her father, who don&apos;t live in New York, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170316053010/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3790824/Anthony-Weiner-carried-months-long-online-sexual-relationship-troubled-15-year-old-girl-telling-hard-asking-dress-school-girl-outfits-pressing-engage-rape-fantasies.html?ito=social-twitter_dailymailus">told the Daily Mail</a> that they weren&apos;t interested in pressing charges against Weiner because the correspondence was consensual, but they came forward &quot;out of concern that Weiner may be sexting with other underage girls.&quot; The 15-year-old, who said her correspondence with Weiner started in January 2016, said she had become obsessed with Weiner and his scandals, calling him her &quot;Hannibal Lecter.&quot; The girl told the Daily Mail that Weiner was fully aware of her age, and claims he encouraged her to masturbate over video chat and sent her nude photos. She also claims Weiner tried to engage her in &quot;rape fantasy&quot; discussions, which she says she rejected. </p>

<p>Gov. Andrew Cuomo commented on the allegations, telling reporters, &quot;If the reports are true, it&#x2019;s possibly criminal and it is sick. And frankly, I&#x2019;ve heard enough about Anthony Weiner &#x2014; and I think that goes for all New Yorkers.&#x201D;</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170316053010/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/anthony-weiner-allegedly-sexted-15-year-old-girl-report-article-1.2800788">Daily News reports</a>: &quot;Under federal law, it is illegal &apos;to persuade, induce, entice, or coerce a minor to engage in sexually explicit conduct for purposes of producing visual depictions of that conduct,&apos; according to the U.S. Department of Justice. The charge carries a maximum prison term of 30 years.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The federal government is very strict &#x2014; not that state isn&#x2019;t &#x2014; but the feds are very strict when it comes to sex offenses involving children,&#x201D; defense lawyer Renee Hill <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170316053010/http://nypost.com/2016/09/21/cuomo-weiner-could-face-jail-time-for-sexting-with-teen/">told the Post</a>. &quot;He could be in some really serious trouble here.&quot;</p>

<p>An attorney told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170316053010/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3801083/NYPD-Special-Victims-Unit-launches-investigation-Anthony-Weiner-DailyMail-com-reveals-line-sexting-relationship-15-year-old-girl.html">the Daily Mail</a> that he believes police would be able to build a strong case around the texts and the explicit photos the two shared. &quot;All you really have to do is look at the messages there to substantiate 90 per cent of her story,&quot; said lawyer Joe Tacopina, who noted a charge of endangering the welfare of a child is punishable by up to a year in jail and three years probation. &quot;If she is a problem child that actually makes her more vulnerable and this is even more egregious, quite frankly.&quot;</p>

<p>According to the Post, the girl claims that a panicking Weiner pressured to write a letter to her father and a teacher in whom she had confided &quot;and tell them what I said was false.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170316053010/http://nypost.com/2016/09/21/cuomo-weiner-could-face-jail-time-for-sexting-with-teen/">The Post reports</a> that Weiner gave the tabloid &quot;a full version of the letter, which included the girl&#x2019;s name and the names of two teachers.&quot; The Daily News published a photo of Weiner&apos;s alleged victim with her face pixelated.</p>

<p>Previously, Weiner was embroiled in multiple sexting scandals <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170316053010/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/16/anthony_weiner_resigns.php">that derailed</a> his congressional career, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170316053010/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/23/unsubstantiated_allegations_of_wein.php">his comeback attempt</a> to run for mayor, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170316053010/http://gothamist.com/2016/08/29/huma_abedin_weiner_separation.php">his marriage</a> to Hillary Clinton advisor Huma Abedin. He is already <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170316053010/http://gothamist.com/2016/08/31/of_course_anthony_weiner_called_his.php">under investigation</a> by the city Administration for Children&#x2019;s Service over sexts he took with his child in the photo.</p>

<p>In a statement, Weiner apologized for the latest incident while saying he was the victim of a hoax: </p>

<blockquote>I have repeatedly demonstrated terrible judgement about the people I have communicated with online and the things I have sent.

<p>I am filled with regret and heartbroken for those I have hurt.</p>

<p>While I have provided the Daily Mail with information showing that I have likely been the subject of a hoax, I have no one to blame but me for putting myself in this position.</p>

<p>I am sorry.</p></blockquote><p></p>
