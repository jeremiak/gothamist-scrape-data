Chevoy Nelson, who has been described by school officials as a special education student who is emotionally disturbed, has been charged with attempted murder, assault and criminal possession of a weapon <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150109000237/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/20/teen_critical_after_being_stabbed_i.php">in yesterday&apos;s attack</a> at Brooklyn Erasmus High School. Victim Alfredo Allen, 15, underwent extensive surgery, but remains in critical condition.<p></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150109000237/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/brooklyn-teen-stabs-fellow-student-stollen-basketball-erasmus-hall-high-school-article-1.994507">According to police and witnesses</a>, the incident started over a game of pickup basketball during lunchtime, when Allen stole the ball from Nelson, and wouldn&apos;t give it back. Nelson allegedly punched Allen, then went looking for a weapon. A police source described what happened next: &#x201C;He goes running around asking everyone for a weapon. He goes into a classroom and asks a teacher for acid. She obviously says no, but then she gets distracted. He grabs a pair of scissors and runs back to the gym. He chases (Allen) around, stabbing him.&quot;</p>

<p>Jessica Sanchez, 15, was playing in the gym at the time, and described the attack: &#x201C;He went behind [Allen] and grabbed him by his neck and stabbed him seven times. [Allen] was screaming. He was saying, &apos;Oh s---.&apos; He didn&apos;t believe it either.&#x201D; Wayne Morgan, an 18-year-old senior, said, &#x201C;He stabbed the guy in the head like seven times. The teacher was there, but it&#x2019;s not like he let it happen. The whole thing happened in like five seconds.&#x201D;</p>

<p>After the attack, police say Nelson went to a school office and sat quietly, still covered in blood. He gave no resistance when police arrived to arrest him. &#x201C;He tells them he doesn&apos;t look for trouble but that people always want trouble with him,&#x201D; the police source said.</p>
