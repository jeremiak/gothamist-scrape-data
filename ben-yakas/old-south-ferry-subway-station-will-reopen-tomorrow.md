<p>The new <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130410014513/http://gothamist.com/tags/southferry">South Ferry</a> station is still out of commission after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130410014513/http://gothamist.com/2012/11/05/photos_south_ferry_station_is_dry_n.php#photo-1">being devastated</a> by Hurricane Sandy&#x2014;and it&apos;s unlikely to be back for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130410014513/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/18/south_ferry_station_may_take_three.php#photo-1">up to three years!</a> So the MTA is going forward with re-opening the &quot;old&quot; South Ferry station. The MTA confirms that 1 train service to South Ferry will resume at 5 a.m. Thursday morning. Just don&apos;t forget: you have to be in the first five cars!</p>

<p>Second Avenue Sagas has already noticed some <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130410014513/https://twitter.com/SecondAveSagas/status/319491754153881601">new signage</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130410014513/https://twitter.com/SecondAveSagas/status/319494654569631744">around the station.</a> In case you weren&apos;t aware, South Ferry can only handle five train cars (as opposed to 10), has those somewhat scary metal platform extenders, and typically has some busy platforms. Whatever you think of the station&apos;s quirks, it&apos;s still better than walking half a mile to Rector Street.</p>

<p>In the meantime, here&apos;s a reminder of how bad the new station was after Sandy:</p>
