<p>Oh sure, you&apos;ve read about the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111104134036/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/08/video_elderly_lou_reed_waxes_rhapso.php">cranky metal Lou Reed/Metallica</a> collaboration <em>Lulu</em>&#x2014;maybe you&apos;ve even seen the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111104134036/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/22/video_muppets_cover_loutallica_lou.php">Muppets covering Loutallica.</a> But have you actually tried listening to the album? It seems some Metallica fans haven&apos;t, but they&apos;re <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111104134036/http://stereogum.com/866711/lou-lars-survey-lulu-fallout/news/">still not too happy</a> about it: &quot;[Metallica&apos;s fans] are threatening to shoot me, and that&apos;s only because I showed up. They haven&apos;t even heard the record yet, and they&apos;re recommending various forms of torture and death,&quot; Reed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111104134036/http://www.usatoday.com/life/music/news/story/2011-11-25/lou-reed-metallica/51021572/1">told USA Today</a> in an interview about the team-up.</p>

<p>The album, a perverse mixture of finger-tapping dirge-y riffs with Reed&apos;s froggy spoken word lyrics, has finally been released to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111104134036/http://www.metacritic.com/music/lulu">less-than-enthusiastic responses</a>: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111104134036/http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15996-lou-reed-metallica/">Pitchfork gave</a> the &quot;exhaustingly tedious&quot; album a 1.0, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111104134036/http://www.wordmagazine.co.uk/content/the-worst-album-all-time">commenters have nominated it</a> for worst album of all time, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111104134036/http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/7146312/lou-reed-metallica-album">Chuck Klosterman said</a> it &quot;might be a successful simulation of how it feels to develop schizophrenia while suffering from a migraine, although slightly less melodic.&quot;</p>

<p>And while Metallica might be carefully creating some distance between their brand and <em>Lulu</em> (&quot;This is a one-off project. It&apos;s a new collective.&quot;), Reed gives a giant bearhug to the whole bizarre thing in the USA Today interview, utilizing as much Lou Reedian-wit as he can muster: he compliments Metallica for playing off his edge (&quot;They are my metal blood brothers. They&apos;re very brave, and they can play. I&apos;m not easy to play with.&quot;), slags off producers and new recording technologies (&quot;If I had my way, they&apos;d all be shot and dumped in the Hudson. They put everyone in isolation booths.&quot;), and declares that he hasn&apos;t had any fans since 1975&apos;s <em>Metal Machine Music</em>: &quot;They all fled. Who cares? I&apos;m essentially in this for the fun of it.&quot;</p>

<p>But most ominously, despite all the negative reviews and criticism, Reed could imagine going forward with the collaboration: &quot;No one wants Lulu Part 2, but on Radio Lou, in my head where I hear these songs, I want more of it.&quot; This cat took the words right out of our mouths:</p>
