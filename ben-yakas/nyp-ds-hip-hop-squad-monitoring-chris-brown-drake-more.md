<p>We already knew that the NYPD has a specific <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504142421/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/10/new_nypd_social_media_unit_is_watch.php">social media unit</a> tasked mainly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504142421/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/08/nyregion/seeking-clues-to-gangs-and-crime-detectives-monitor-internet-rap-videos.html">with trolling</a> Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube for any evidence of illicit activity, but that was just the tip of the iceberg. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504142421/http://pagesix.com/2014/08/28/celebs-on-hip-hop-squad-watch-list-after-suge-knight-shooting/">The Post reports</a> that the NYPD really does have a dedicated &quot;Hip Hop Squad&quot; that investigates and monitors rappers and other artists. But apparently, a lot of industry people are cool with all this!</p>

<p>&quot;All New York club owners are required to inform the Hip-Hop Police in advance if anyone on the watch list is coming in,&quot; a police source told them. &quot;They want to be there to monitor the crowd and in case any trouble starts. They don&apos;t want any situations like the Suge Knight shooting. If something does go down, they want to already be on the scene.&quot; In addition to Brown and Drake, other artists on the list include French Montana, Fabolous, Wiz Khalifa, Young Jeezy, Fat Joe, Jim Jones and Lil Wayne.</p>

<p>&quot;If there is a show going on, they are there,&quot; the Post&apos;s source added. &quot;Their job is to investigate crimes and curtail violence in the hip-hop industry. So when they find out there is a beef between rappers, they monitor it. They are plainclothes cops, they go to clubs and shows. They were at J.Lo&#x2019;s show in The Bronx because French Montana and Fat Joe were coming.&quot; This isn&apos;t exactly what Chamillionaire was talking about when he sang about &quot;Hip Hop Police.&quot;</p>

<p>The Hip-Hop Squad isn&apos;t exactly new: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504142421/http://www.thesmokinggun.com/documents/celebrity/nypds-secret-hip-hop-dossier">the Smoking Gun had a report</a> about the unit in 2005, also after a Suge Knight shooting incident (sensing a pattern?). The 500-page investigative report contained rap sheets, mug shots, and incident reports on everyone from 50 Cent to Jay Z to Diddy to Ja Rule.</p>

<p>The cop sources told the Post that the unit isn&apos;t only well known in the industry&#x2014;it&apos;s completely accepted and embraced. &quot;It&#x2019;s better to have them on hand,&quot; the source insisted. &quot;They&#x2019;re not there to bother any of these artists, but make sure things run like they&#x2019;re supposed to run. The other part of it is, there&#x2019;s a lot of really street-leaning gangster guys on the fringes of the industry...The police task force keeps tabs on who is around certain rappers and what movements they are going through.&quot;</p>

<p>As for why Brown and Drake might be on the top of the list, we refer you to a little <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504142421/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/15/chris_brown_and_drakes_club_clash_c.php#photo-1">bottle-throwing incident</a> at WiP club <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504142421/http://gothamist.com/tags/workinprogress">in 2012.</a></p>
