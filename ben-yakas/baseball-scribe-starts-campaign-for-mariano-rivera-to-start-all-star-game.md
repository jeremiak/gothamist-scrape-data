<p>How do you say goodbye to one of the absolute greatest baseball pitchers in history? It&apos;s a question hanging over Yankees Stadium this summer as the team and its fans get to say farewell to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426153502/http://gothamist.com/tags/marianorivera">Mariano Rivera</a> during his final season. One baseball journalist has a novel idea of how MLB can properly pay tribute: let Mo pitch the first inning of the All-Star game.</p>

<p>Journalist Bill Chuck lays out a nine-point argument for why Rivera, the greatest closer in the history of baseball, should be the starting pitcher for the American League in the All-Star Game on July 16 at Citi Field <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426153502/http://www.billy-ball.com/2013/05/introducing-the-campaign-to-startmo/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=Feed:+BillyBall+(Billy-Ball)">on his website</a>. That includes the fact he deserves the pre-game hype of starting, it&apos;ll give kids (who might be asleep by the 9th inning) a chance to see him pitch, there is a precedent for this kind of tribute (Cal Ripken Jr.), and he&apos;s a very deserved All-Star this year (with 16 saves already). </p>

<p>Moreover, Chuck writes: &quot;There is no finer gentleman in the game and this  player, who is respected by so many of his peers, would never ask for the accolade which makes him all the more deserving.&quot; So if you support this idea, head over to Twitter and use the hashtag <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426153502/https://twitter.com/search?q=%23startmo&amp;src=typd">#StartMo</a>. Barring that, you can always make a video compilation with a little Metallica on the soundtrack:</p>
