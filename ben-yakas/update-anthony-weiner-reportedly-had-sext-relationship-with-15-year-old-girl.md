<p>According to yet another sordid and sad tabloid report, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170719225925/http://gothamist.com/tags/anthonyweiner">Anthony Weiner</a> sexted with a 15-year-old girl for months via various social media messaging services. The girl, whose name was not released because of her age, talked to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170719225925/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3790824/Anthony-Weiner-carried-months-long-online-sexual-relationship-troubled-15-year-old-girl-telling-hard-asking-dress-school-girl-outfits-pressing-engage-rape-fantasies.html?ito=social-twitter_dailymailus">Daily Mail about</a> their months-long sexting relationship, in which he allegedly exchanged nude photos, pressured her to dress up in school girl outfits for him, and shared his &quot;rape fantasies.&quot;</p>

<p>Previously, Weiner was embroiled in multiple sexting scandals <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170719225925/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/16/anthony_weiner_resigns.php">that derailed</a> his congressional career, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170719225925/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/23/unsubstantiated_allegations_of_wein.php">his comeback attempt</a> to run for mayor, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170719225925/http://gothamist.com/2016/08/29/huma_abedin_weiner_separation.php">his marriage</a> to Hillary Clinton advisor Huma Abedin.  </p>

<p>The girl and her father told the Daily Mail that they weren&apos;t interested in pressing charges against Weiner because the correspondence was consensual, but they came forward &quot;out of concern that Weiner may be sexting with other underage girls.&quot; The two apparently communicated via multiple apps, including Twitter, Facebook, Kik, and Confide, starting in January 2016. </p>

<p>The 15-year-old said she was interested in politics and became obsessed with Weiner and his scandals, calling him her &quot;Hannibal Lecter.&quot; She also claims she was trying to write a book about him as they got to know each other, and says she encouraged him to engage with her in a sexual manner.  The girl, who noted Weiner was fully aware of her age, said she never considered him to be her boyfriend, but did think their relationship was &quot;romantic.&quot; As with Weiner&apos;s other online sexting relationships, it appears they never met in real life.</p>

<p>Weiner allegedly started sending her shirtless photos over Kik, using the name &quot;T Dog.&quot; Things escalated as they started talking on Skype: &quot;[Weiner&apos;s] son was in the bathtub at the time just downstairs,&quot; she said. &quot;So he would yell at his son to check on him, and then he asked me to take my clothes off, and just started saying these really sexual things.&quot; </p>

<p>She claims he would encourage her to masturbate over video chat and he would send her nude photos; he asked her to dress up in plaid skirts and pretend he was her school teacher; he also tried to engage her in &quot;rape fantasy&quot; discussions, which she rejected. Feeling guilty, the girl told her father and a teacher about the relationship in April, but she says Weiner then &quot;pressured her to write two more letters to her father and teacher saying that she lied about the natures of their relationship and the two of them were just friends.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170719225925/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3790824/Anthony-Weiner-carried-months-long-online-sexual-relationship-troubled-15-year-old-girl-telling-hard-asking-dress-school-girl-outfits-pressing-engage-rape-fantasies.html?ito=social-twitter_dailymailus">The Daily Mail has a lot of screenshots</a> of their correspondences, as well some of the letters Weiner allegedly asked her to send to her father and teacher.</p>

<p>In a statement to The Daily Mail, Weiner didn&apos;t deny exchanging &quot;flirtatious&quot; messages with the teen, and said: &quot;I have repeatedly demonstrated terrible judgement about the people I have communicated with online and the things I have sent. I am filled with regret and heartbroken for those I have hurt.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170719225925/https://www.buzzfeed.com/davidmack/anthony-weiner-daily-mail-report?utm_term=.npq4XWWYQ#.hdRDgxxNy">Weiner maintains</a> he is the victim of a hoax, though the only evidence he has presented thus far are the emails which the girl claims he pressured her into writing (with no comment on the many photos and screenshots of their sexually-charged conversations). </p>

<p>Gov. Andrew Cuomo was asked about the allegations as well: &quot;If the reports are true, it&apos;s possibly criminal and it is sick,&quot; Cuomo said, according <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170719225925/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/anthony-weiner-allegedly-sexted-15-year-old-girl-report-article-1.2800788?cid=bitly">to the News</a>. &quot;And frankly, I&#x2019;ve heard enough about Anthony Weiner and I think that goes for all New Yorkers.&quot;</p>
