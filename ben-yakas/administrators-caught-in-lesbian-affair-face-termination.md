<p>The DOE have announced that they are planning on firing the Principal and Assistant Principal who were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140506214336/http://gothamist.com/2010/11/12/death_threats_reveal_lesbian_school.php">embroiled in a two-year long affair</a> which came to an end in a hail of firing requests and death threats. &quot;We are currently seeking to terminate both Principal Simmons and Assistant Principal Jones,&quot; for conduct believed to include sex during school hours, said DOE spokeswoman Barbara Morgan. But what do Principal Crystal Simmons&apos; current and former husbands think?</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140506214336/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/learning_lezzin_wE5Sylhy4KGduJ2UVKdsVI">the Post</a>, Principal Simmons is married, and a man identifying himself as her husband said he found the situation &quot;disturbing.&quot; Her ex-husband Derrick Lilly talked to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140506214336/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/education/2010/11/14/2010-11-14_untitled_princ14m.html">the Daily News</a>, and defended her: &quot;They were on school property when they were doing whatever but I don&apos;t want anybody to lose their job. The economy&apos;s terrible right now...She&apos;s a successful black woman. I&apos;m proud of everything she accomplished.&quot;</p>
