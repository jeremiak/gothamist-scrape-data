<p>It was only a week ago that we first heard about the crazy new <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160622172913/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/22/new_bizarre_drug_trend_bath_salts.php">bath salts drug trend</a>, but they&apos;re already being targeted by the man for permanent banishment. Senator Chuck Schumer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160622172913/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2011/01/30/schumer-wants-ban-on-drug-like-bath-salts/">announced a bill</a> today to add the two active ingredients in the powders, mephedrone and methylenedioxypyrovalerone, also known as MDPV, to the list of federally controlled substances.</p>

<p>Authorities <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160622172913/http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2011-01-22-bath-salts_N.htm">say</a> that people are snorting, injecting or smoking bath salt powders, and getting a high reportedly as powerful as abusing methamphetamine; according to experts, some of the effects of the salts (which sell for as cheap as $20 a packet) include hallucinations, paranoia, rapid heart rates and suicidal thoughts. &quot;These so-called bath salts contain ingredients that are nothing more than legally sanctioned narcotics, and they are being sold cheaply to all comers, with no questions asked, at store counters around the country,&#x201D; Schumer said. And we haven&apos;t even gotten a chance to try them out yet! At least they can&apos;t take away our beloved slightly caffeinated, sour-tasting, over-the-counter energy jolt drinks...since they are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160622172913/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/national/energy_jolt_not_by_long_shot_E37UHAXKWpu8JDfYxKkqNM?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">basically placebos</a>, it turns out.</p>
