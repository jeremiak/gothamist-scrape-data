<p>While he didn&apos;t cock an eyebrow up to the heavens or start addressing the Colbert Nation, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170402223346/http://gothamist.com/tags/stephencolbert">Stephen Colbert</a> did conjure up the spirit of <em>The Colbert Show</em> last night as he channeled some of that signature sardonic wit to disassemble the bullshit of the current Trump administration. </p>

<p>&quot;I was not going to talk about this story, because it happened last Thursday, and the crazy train has gone way down the tracks since then, and I figured this tired hobo just missed his chance to jump in the box car. But today the president gave me a reason to talk about it, so here&apos;s the deal,&quot; Colbert said, introducing the now-infamous clip of Kellyanne Conway chiding the media for not covering the legendary <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170402223346/http://gothamist.com/2017/02/03/kellyanne_conway_never_forge_it.php">Bowling Green massacre.</a> &quot;Yes it didn&apos;t get covered&#x2014;on the flimsy excuse that there was no Bowling Green massacre. But I think we all remember where we weren&apos;t were when we didn&apos;t hear that nothing had happened.&quot;</p>

<p>Sure, Conway claims it was all an innocent mistake, but she repeated the claim about the massacre to three separate outlets on different occasions. All this confusion led Colbert to demand answers to unanswerable questions: &quot;I say they need to present both sides of the story: the things that did happen and the things that didn&apos;t happen. Then let the victims of the Bowling Green massacre decide if they were killed. So far, not one of them has come forward.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Now I don&apos;t want to jump to any conclusions&#x2014;just because it didn&apos;t happen doesn&apos;t mean it wasn&apos;t an inside job,&quot; he said. &quot;If America isn&apos;t going to be attacked, who is most likely not to do it? Us.&quot; Watch below as Colbert gets tied up in a linguistic Gordian Knot. </p>
