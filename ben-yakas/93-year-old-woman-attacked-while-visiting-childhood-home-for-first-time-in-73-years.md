<p>A Queens grandmother who returned to her childhood home for the first time in 73 years was assaulted in the Washington Heights building this week. Marjorie Ramondetta, 93, says she and her 65-year-old daughter Linda Reynolds were shoved down a flight of stairs at the building on Amsterdam Avenue and 164th Street on Tuesday at 12:20 p.m.  &#x201C;We&#x2019;ve never had such an upset in our life,&#x201D; Ramondetta <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131006180436/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/it_gran_larceny_qEWjvW3nl4DbCBQyHZYc0L?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Manhattan">told The Post</a></p>

<p>The thief, who has been identified as 25-year-old Richard Davidson, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131006180436/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Elderly-Woman-Mugged-Childhood-Home-Manhattan-Washington-Heights-Police-220801601.html">allegedly approached the women</a> as they snapped pictures outside the building and offered to show them around the apartment. &#x201C;He said, &#x2018;Can I help you?&#x2019; He was clean-cut, clean clothes, clean-shaven. He looked decent,&#x201D; Reynolds recalled. As they were walking up the stairs to the second-floor, he allegedly tried to grab their purses. When they wouldn&apos;t let go, Reynolds says he shoved them down the steps.</p>

<p>&#x201C;After we fell, he took the bags,&#x201D; Reynolds added. &quot;I heard my mother say, &#x2018;Please help me! I ran upstairs, and I&#x2019;m yelling, &apos;Call the cops! Call the cops! Someone help us!&apos;&quot; Davidson was later arrested for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131006180436/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local/new_york&amp;id=9214399">allegedly robbing a 70-year-old woman</a>, and he allegedly admitted to stealing the women&apos;s purses. Davidson has been charged with robbery and grand larceny.</p>
