<p>[SAD UPDATE BELOW] It hasn&apos;t been a great year for one <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501213901/http://gothamist.com/tags/morrissey">Steven Patrick Morrissey</a>, who has had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501213901/http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/mar/16/morrissey-cancels-us-tour-ill-health">many concerts cancelled</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501213901/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/morrissey-cancels-remaining-south-american-tour-dates-20130721">due to various illnesses</a>&#x2014;but it&apos;s been a pretty good year for Moz fans, what with the release of his long-rumored, long-awaited, and charmingly long-winded <em>Autobiography</em> on the Penguin Classics imprint. The book will finally be released in the US this week&#x2014;and you can pick it up on Thursday at Barnes and Noble and meet the man himself.</p>

<p>Morrissey will improbably <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501213901/http://www.brooklynvegan.com/archives/2013/12/morrissey_relea_1.html">appear at the Union Square Barnes and Noble</a> from 7-9 p.m. on Thursday to sign copies of the book. There&apos;s no musical performance or reading planned; B&amp;N; notes that &quot;your receipt is your ticket,&quot; so make sure you buy a copy there. This is finally your chance to ask Steven if he has yet decided whether the body rules the mind or if the mind rules the body.</p>

<p>There&apos;s been some controversy around the US release of the book because it reportedly removes many references to Morrissey&apos;s humansexual relationship with photographer Jake Owen Walters. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501213901/http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/news/morrisseys-gay-relationship-edited-from-us-edition-of-autobiography-8985162.html">According to The Independent</a>, many of the anecdotes and details about Walters has been excised, including a photograph of Walters as a young boy. Hopefully this paragraph about the relationship, which is as close as Morrissey comes to saying it forthright, is still there:</p>

<blockquote>Jake and I neither sought nor needed company other than our own for the whirlwind stretch to come&#x2026;for the first time in my life the eternal &#x2018;I&#x2019; becomes &#x2018;we&#x2019; as, finally, I can get on with someone.</blockquote>

<p>Having flipped through the book several times (but not yet had the time to finish reading it), we can attest that the book is gorgeously written in parts, especially when Moz recounts his childhood in depressed Manchester&#x2014;it&apos;s as witty and funny as you&apos;d hope from Moz, but it&apos;s also filled with tons of bitching about former associates and band mates, and a very tedious section all about various court cases from the &apos;90s.</p>

<p>For another taste of the book, watch Peter Serafinowicz sing the first two pages:</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: It seems somebody may have jumped the gun about announcing this event, because Morrissey is very unfortunately not going to be in NYC on Thursday. Barnes &amp; Noble sent us this statement about what happened:</p>

<blockquote>There was a miscommunication solely on the part of the store and Morrissey was not scheduled to make an appearance here on 12/12/13 as we had announced in error. We hope to see him in the future, but there is NO scheduled signing for Morrissey at this time. We greatly apologize to his fans and our customers for any inconvenience this has caused</blockquote>
