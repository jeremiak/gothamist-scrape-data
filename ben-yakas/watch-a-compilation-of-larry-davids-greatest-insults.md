<p>We don&apos;t know when (or if) there&apos;ll be a new season of <em>Curb Your Enthusiasm</em>. We don&apos;t know what exactly is up with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425173045/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/16/video_jerry_seinfeld_jason_alexande.php">the rumored play</a> he&apos;s doing with Jerry Seinfeld. We don&apos;t even know if we really want <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425173045/http://laughingsquid.com/highly-detailed-plaster-busts-of-walter-white-heisenberg-larry-david-and-louis-c-k/">that plaster bust of his head</a> which we ordered at 3 a.m. last night. But there&apos;s one thing we do know: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425173045/http://gothamist.com/tags/larrydavid">Larry David</a> has a way with insults. Especially when he&apos;s dealing with big vaginas, Jew faces, Parkinson&apos;s accusations, Funkhouser, &quot;fuck Hugh,&quot; and scum sucking motherfucking whores. All in all, it&apos;s pretty, pretty, pretty good stuff.</p>

<p>There&apos;s only one person who is as skillful with a linguistic scalpel as David&#x2014;the only person who could call him a &quot;bald asshole&quot; to his face and get away with it.</p>
