<p>The Brooklyn Bridge has been closed in both directions Saturday afternoon because of a potential jumper. The man was first spotted on the edge of the western Brooklyn Bridge balustrade around 3 p.m. Traffic on the bridge has come to a complete standstill over the last hour as police have also climbed to the top of the bridge in order to try to prevent the man from potentially jumping. </p>

<p>Reports at the scene indicate there is a lot of chaos on the bridge, with many people gathering to watch the standoff and some cars attempting to back up off the bridge: &quot;Cop walking among the trapped cars screaming &quot;MAKE YOUR OWN JUDGEMENT&quot; re: backing up off the Brooklyn Bridge. This is gonna go well,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151023082938/https://twitter.com/jordanarothman/status/330774058830544898">tweeted Jordana Rothman.</a></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151023082938/https://twitter.com/Niketa">Reporter Niketa Patel</a> is on a roof in the South Street Seaport taking photos with a telescope&#x2014;she saw this interaction between police and the unidentified man: &quot;Cop now offering jumper chewing gum. Jumper refuses gum. More cops approach jumper. Cops all sharing gum!&quot; We&apos;ll update as we learn more information. </p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: According <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151023082938/https://twitter.com/Niketa/status/330780058274914304">to Patel</a>, the standoff has come to a peaceful, non-fatal end: &quot;Brooklyn Bridge jumper moves towards cops. Crowds gathered nearby cheer!!&apos;n&quot; she tweeted. &quot;Jumper is in police custody now. Thank goodness!&quot;</p>
