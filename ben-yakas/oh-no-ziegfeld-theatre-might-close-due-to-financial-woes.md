<p>The Ziegfeld Theatre has been an institution in Manhattan for more than 70 years, and is still the city&apos;s largest surviving single-screen venue&#x2014;but because of continuing financial troubles, it may be facing closure in the near future. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424174743/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/red_carpet_mSb2uFhB8U2NsvsD8reypN">According to the Post</a>, the cinema has been closing more and more frequently, even during the usually lucrative summer movie season, and sources claims it&apos;s losing around $1 million a year.</p>

<p>The theater was first built in 1927, then razed and re-opened in 1969 at its current location. Spokesman wouldn&apos;t discuss the financials, but did note they had premiere events for films such as <em>Men In Black 3</em>, and they&apos;ve expanded to show other special events there, such as Rangers playoffs games. &#x201C;It is normal course of business for the theater to be closed at certain times to accommodate these unique marquee activities,&#x201D; they said in a statement.</p>

<p>Cablevision, which owns Clearview Cinemas chain (including the Ziegfield), put it up for sale in May. Movie-theater historian Ross Melnick of CinemaTreasures.com said a Disney takeover might be a &#x201C;best possible outcome,&quot; but a Disney spokesman said there was no present interest. Film programmer Shade Rupe thinks the property might be worth more to the city as a hotel: &#x201C;The real estate is so valuable, the city would probably just as soon have another hotel on the site than a really special place to see movies like the Ziegfeld.&quot;</p>

<p>If it does close, it won&apos;t just be the loss of the best cinema in NYC&#x2014;we&apos;ll also be losing one of the best bathrooms! As commenter Rdayk <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424174743/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/12/best_bathroom_nominees_bryant_park.php#photo-7">put it a few years ago</a>: &quot;The Ziegfeld Theatre has the most opulent bathroom. Each stall has its own sink and vanity in addition to the toilet. It isn&apos;t public, though, I think you have to buy a movie ticket to use it. But if you find yourself at the Ziegfeld (the only grand old cinema left in Manhattan), be sure to use the bathroom!&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: We received the following statement from the Ziegfeld owners, Cablevision, about the financial troubles: &quot;We have no plans to close the Ziegfeld Theatre.&quot;<br>
