Yvette Marie Torres, 15, was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110615051750/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Bronx-Teenage-Girl-Shot-in-Head-123719244.html">at a party</a> in Fordham Heights on Saturday night when a fight spilled out into the street; she approached the men and asked why they were wantonly shooting into the air. &quot;She didn&apos;t know this kid. She turned around and he shot her in the back of the head. It was a sucker move,&quot; said her brother Jonathan Dimentel.<p></p>

<p>Torres, who attends DeWitt Clinton High School in the Bronx, was showing &quot;good signs&quot; Sunday afternoon, but was still unconscious and breathing through a ventilator according to family.  But doctors warn that they have to wait for the swelling near her wound to go down before they can operate: &quot;There&apos;s a high risk of her passing away.&quot; Dimentel said their parents are devastated: &quot;My dad won&apos;t say a word. He is in a daze. I&apos;ve never seen him like this. All my mom does is cry.&quot; </p>

<p>Police say there are differing accounts of what exactly happened at the party, though they noted that Torres wasn&apos;t part of the initial fight which led to the party spilling into the street; there have been no arrests, and police only have a vague description of the gunmen. Dimentel said he wasn&apos;t surprised she stood up to the gunmen: &quot;She has nothing but brothers. She has to be brave.&quot;</p>
