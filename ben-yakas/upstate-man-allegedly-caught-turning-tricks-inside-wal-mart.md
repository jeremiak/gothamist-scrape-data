Not only are we missing out on those <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426151839/http://thekenyonthrill.com/2012/01/18/10-oclock-list-weirdest-walmart-items/">exclusive Justin Bieber My World Dog Tags</a>&#x2014;we&apos;re also missing out on the casual prostitution.<p></p>

<p>According <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426151839/http://www.thesmokinggun.com/documents/walmart-prostitution-567912">to the Smoking Gun</a>, 22-year-old Wal-Mart employee Foster Bills (not a pen name) is facing a prostitution charge for allegedly &#x201C;soliciting sexual encounters&#x201D; inside the Queensbury store where he works. State police received &#x201C;an anonymous complaint of a male subject performing sexual acts in a secluded location;&#x201D; that secluded location turned out to be a Wal-Mart bathroom, and police soon caught Bills in a sting operation. </p>

<p>Bills has been charged with a misdemeanor prostitution count. On the plus side, Bills&apos; story has given the Smoking Gun commentariat the chance to unload all the cheesy Wal-Mart jokes you were probably just about to post: &quot;That&apos;s the only service anyone ever got at a Walmart;&quot; &quot;You really can get anything at Wal-Mart;&quot; &quot;Falling prices and dudes falling to their knees;&quot; and best of all, &quot;Walmart execs are studying this right now to determine if they should be importing cheaper Chinese male prostitutes.&quot;</p>
