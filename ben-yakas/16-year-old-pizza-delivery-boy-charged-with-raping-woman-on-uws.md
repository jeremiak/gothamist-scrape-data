<p>A 16-year-old Bronx teen has been arrested and charged with raping a woman on the Upper West Side early this morning. Police say the incident happened around 12:30 a.m. Saturday at a residential building near Amsterdam Avenue in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160715181946/http://www.nyc.gov/html/nypd/html/precincts/precinct_020.shtml">20th Precinct</a>&#x2014;according <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160715181946/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/year_raped_pizza_delivery_boy_allegedly_9ZNhrUa5SuAElvbLOYpP1N">to the Post</a>, a 16-year-old pizza delivery boy delivered a pie to a 35-year-old woman, then later broke into the victim&apos;s apartment.</p>

<p>The Post&apos;s sources add that the teen allegedly put his hands over the woman&apos;s mouth so she couldn&apos;t scream; she was eventually able to fight him off, and he fled the scene. The woman was taken to Roosevelt Hospital, where she is listed in stable condition. Police have since caught suspect Cesar Lucas; he has been charged with rape in the first degree, and burglary in the second degree. </p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160715181946/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20120929/lincoln-square/woman-sexually-assaulted-by-teen-pizza-deliveryman-on-uws-sources-say">DNAInfo adds a few</a> somewhat conflicting details: according to their sources, Lucas entered the building on West 61st Street around 1:30 a.m. and found that the victim&apos;s door was open. He was supposed to be delivering a pizza to a different apartment on the same floor, their sources claim. </p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: According <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160715181946/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/pizza-delivery-boy-rapes-woman-manhattan-apartment-police-article-1.1171032">to the News</a>, Lucas was a delivery boy for New York Sal&#x2019;s Pizza on Tenth Avenue. Law enforcement sources also told them that the teen was previously arrested for breaking into a 39-year-old woman&#x2019;s W. 42nd Street apartment while delivering pizza in August.</p>
