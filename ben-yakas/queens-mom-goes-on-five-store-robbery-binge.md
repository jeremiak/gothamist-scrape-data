Jodi Mendelowitz, 48, has been accused of knocking over three liquor stores and a restaurant, as well as a botched robbery at a bank, all using a fake silver handgun, netting less than a thousand dollars altogether.<p></p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150725022928/http://www.wpix.com/news/local/wpix-jewish-mom-robberies,0,4632684.story">robberies began</a> 9 p.m. on Friday night when Mendelowitz allegedly walked into a liquor store in Kew Gardens Hills, demanding cash while rummaging through a large pocketbook. Just after midnight on Saturday, she repeated the routine at a Chinese food restaurant in the same neighborhood. On Saturday evening, she robbed another liquor store, and on Monday, she attempted back-to-back robberies at a Citibank in Jamaica Estates and another liquor store in the area. She got spooked at the Citibank and fled with no money, and she was caught after a clerk jotted down the license plate number of her sister&apos;s red car at the last liquor store.</p>

<p>Mendelowitz disguised herself during the spree: she wore a wig of long black hair, a white baseball cap, a long denim dress and large sunglasses. She has been charged on four counts of second-degree robbery and one count of second-degree attempted robbery, and faces federal charges for the botched bank heist. Mendelowitz, who is identified as orthodox Jewish by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150725022928/http://failedmessiah.typepad.com/failed_messiahcom/2010/08/orthodox-mom-arrested-for-series-of-armed-robberies-345.html">FailedMessiah</a>, has a daughter, and neighbors told the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150725022928/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2010/08/25/2010-08-25_cops_bust_woman_with_no_rap_sheet_in_robbery_spree.html">Daily News</a> they suspect she may be mentally ill: &quot;She came pretty late and said she had locked her 9-year-old daughter in the apartment and needed $20 to call a locksmith...It freaked me out.&quot;</p>
