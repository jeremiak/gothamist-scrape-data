title: New App Brings Delivery To Central Park
---

	
										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="71110fry.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504170319im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/71110fry.jpg" width="240" height="198" class="image-left"> </span>Earlier today, the Times tried to kick off a new <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504170319/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/11/where_do_you_park.php">Manhattan-Brooklyn battle</a>, this time over whether Central or Prospect Park is the superior park. Really, there&apos;s nothing better than spending a lazy summer day in either park. Having said that...iPhone offers a pretty compelling argument as to why Central Park is superior: you can now order delivery there!</p>

<p>A new free iPhone application, CityMint, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504170319/http://www.nydailynews.com/money/2010/07/11/2010-07-11_gotta_apppreciate_food_delivery_in_park.html">offers</a> to deliver meals to Central Park from seven restaurants bordering the park, with free delivery, between noon and 7 pm on weekends through Labor Day. The app comes with a GPS add-on, which allows deliverymen to pintpoint where you are, avoiding the hassle of you trying to describe your location (&quot;near the big rock?&quot;). Restaurants who have signed on so far include Francesco&apos;s Pizzeria and Restaurant, Aroma Espresso Bar, China Fun, Pinkberry and Big Nick&apos;s Burger Joint and Pizza Joint. Runner/project manager Tim Diamond is hoping they can maintain a 30-to-40-minute delivery time, and weighed in on why they chose Central Park to launch the program: &quot;It&apos;s where people congregate, and it&apos;s where people are actually going to in the summer - when they&apos;re not hiding in movie theaters.&quot; </p>
