<p>Cops identified the woman as Marilyn Michose, 46, of Danbury, Ct. She was talking to herself when hotel security approached her, and told them that she only wanted to put her valuables in the Park Ave. hotel&apos;s safe. When they asked if she had a gun, she ran into a nearby empty hotel bar, where she calmly surrendered and handed over what turned out to be an unloaded .25 semi-automatic Beretta. </p>

<p>Michose, who had been staying at the hotel, was taken to Elmhurst General Hospital for psychiatric evaluation; she was charged with criminal possession of a weapon in the 4th degree. Michose was still a better guest for the Waldorf-Astoria than some of the others who have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110510235537/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/05/waldorf-astoria_bitten_by_another_b.php">been bugging</a> patrons for the past year.</p>
