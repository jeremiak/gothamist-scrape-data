<p>Seth Meyers has a pretty compelling theory as to why <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110094316/http://gothamist.com/tags/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> continues to refuse to release his tax returns, even after this weekend&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110094316/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/02/report_donald_trump_may_not_have_pa.php">NY Times scoop</a> that he lost nearly $1 billion in 1995 (and subsequently likely hasn&apos;t paid taxes since): he&apos;s poor. He&apos;s <em>so</em> poor. He&apos;s the poorest former billionaire in all the land! </p>

<p>&quot;I think you pretend to be rich, but you&apos;ve been going town-to-town for 18 months selling cheap hats,&quot; he said. &quot;I think you&apos;re only up at 3 a.m. in the morning because you have a second job answering customer service calls <em>from</em> India.&quot; Does Trump only want to live in the White House because there are free garden tomatoes? </p>

<p>After wishing everyone a happy Rosh Hashanah, Stephen Colbert also cover Trump&apos;s tax returns and genius ability to lose money. &quot;Now the idea that Trump hasn&apos;t paid taxes in nearly 20 years is bound to be unpopular with, what&apos;s the word...people,&quot; Colbert noted. But not all people, since Trump always has &quot;the former Rudy Giuliani&quot; in his corner!</p>

<p>As Colbert concludes, Trump could forget this whole politics thing and still have a second career as a freeform poetry slammer.</p>
