Thankfully, the band did go on once the room was packed in, and played a full-bodied, percussion-heavy set to the utter delight of everyone with ears.\<\/p\>\r\n\r\n\<p\>Thom Yorke\'s \<a href=\"http://gothamist.com/2009/09/29/extra_extra_1381.php\"\>supergroup\<\/a\>, which includes blue-haired elastic-bassist Flea, engineer/producer Nigel Godrich, sometime-Beck drummer Joey Waronker and percussionist Mauro Refosco, performed Yorke\'s 2006 solo record \<em\>The Eraser\<\/em\> in full, letting the twitchy, electronic songs breathe, extending them toward dancier horizons. Interestingly, the less poppy songs translated the best; \"Harrowdown Hill\" was menacing and had an incredible coda, \"Skip Divided\" was slinky and erotic, and \"The Clock\" sounded like it was always meant to be played with a rock band. Opening song \"The Eraser\" had the best cameo of the night, an eviscerating solo from jazz trumpeter Christian Scott (you can see a video of it below).\<\/p\>\r\n\r\n\<p\>The album came to life during the performance, and the crowd seemed completely swayed by the side-project. Best of all, everyone onstage was having a visibly great time: Godrich got to leave the keyboards and skronk on guitar for awhile, Flea threw himself around the stage rhythmically, filled with boundless manic energy, and Yorke was all smiles and gangly dances (like trying to make a seizure look sexy, in the best possible way), his voice as effortlessly strong and charismatic as ever.\<\/p\>\r\n\r\n\<p\>After \<em\>The Eraser\<\/em\>, Yorke played a three song solo set, highlighted by a rare piano performance of \<a href=\"http://gothamist.com/2006/06/16/radioheads_new.php\"\>Radiohead\<\/a\> b-side \"Fog\" (\"baby alligators in the sewers/grow up fast\") and \"Everything In It\'s Right Place.\" The band concluded with four songs, less hooky and more dance-oriented, including stellar new tune \"Judge, Jury and Executioner,\" and a downright Portisheady-version of another Radiohead b-side, \"Paperbag Writer.\" It was a deeply satisfying show, although it would be nice if some fans remembered they REALLY don\'t sound anything like Yorke, and should REALLY not try to match him.\<\/p\>\r\n\<object width=\"640\" height=\"360\"\>\<param name=\"allowfullscreen\" value=\"true\" /\>\<param name=\"allows\criptaccess\" value=\"always\" /\>\<param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=10805802&server=vimeo.com&show_title=1&show_byline=1&show_portrait=0&color=aeb3b5&fullscreen=1\" /\>\<embed src=\"http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=10805802&server=vimeo.com&show_title=1&show_byline=1&show_portrait=0&color=aeb3b5&fullscreen=1\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" allows\criptaccess=\"always\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\"\>\<\/embed\>\<\/object\>\<\/p\>", "credit":"Photo by Ben Yakas/Gothamist"};galleryObj['photo_1'] = photo;</script>

Their near-capacity show \<a href=\"http://poptartssucktoasted.com/?p=834\"\>last Saturday night\<\/a\> at Webster Hall was one of the biggest venues they\'ve played yet, and it showed in a slightly tempered sound that didn\'t quite fit the hall. Some of their more immediate songs, such as \"Lust For Life,\" didn\'t translate as tremendously as one would hope, while a slew of new mid-tempo songs mid-set almost lost the audience entirely.\<\/p\>\r\n\r\n\<p\>But Girls also write some really good songs: set-openers \"Ghost Mouth\" and \"Laura\" were infectious, \"Big Bad Mean Motherfucker\" fit its scuzzy beach vibe,  and \"Hellhole Ratrace\" remains their biggest and best tune, and provided some much needed distortion to proceedings. The night ended with flowers strewn across the stage, and Girls just a bit bigger; hopefully their sound will grow as loud as they are becoming.\<\/p\>", "credit":"Photo by Ben Yakas/Gothamist"};galleryObj['photo_2'] = photo;</script>

Tickets go on sale this Tuesday (4/13) at 5PM at Record Grouch/Old Made Vintage (and there will be no online sales, so you have to go in person!). All proceeds go to Partners In Healthâs Stand With Haiti Fund. According to \<a href=\"http://www.therestisnoise.com/2010/04/spring-revel.html\"\>Alex Ross\<\/a\>, âdonât be surprised if you hear some combination of Thai soul, doom metal, Justin Bieber, and, of course, nude Stravinsky.â\<\/p\>", "credit":""};galleryObj['photo_3'] = photo;</script>
