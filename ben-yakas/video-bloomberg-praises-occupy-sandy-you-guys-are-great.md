<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141111125635/http://gothamist.com/tags/mayorbloomberg">Mayor Bloomberg</a> made an impromptu visit to the Rockaways this week&#x2014;although he was predominantly there to discuss Sandy recovery efforts with local paper The Wave (and declare that the age of the wooden boardwalk <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141111125635/http://gothamist.com/2012/11/30/wooden_boardwalks_are_so_over_says.php">is so over</a>), Bloomberg also was confronted by some Occupy Sandy members. And for once, he had nothing but praise for them: &quot;Thank you for everything you&apos;ve done. You guys are great,&quot; Bloomberg told them, as you can see in the video below. &quot;We really do appreciate it, all kidding aside. You really are making a difference. Goodbye,&quot; he said.</p>

<p>Bloomberg probably would have rather avoided any confrontations with protesters or Occupy people, but his helicopter touched down right behind Occupy Sandy&apos;s headquarters at the St. Camillus Church, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141111125635/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20121130/new-york-city/bloomberg-praises-occupy-sandy-during-surprise-trip-rockaways">according to DNAInfo.</a> Residents were upset that Bloomberg didn&apos;t stick around to talk to locals: &#x201C;I feel like he could have answered a question,&quot; said Christine Donohue, whose home was destroyed in the storm. &quot;If he could have at least acknowledged the questions. Just one...It&apos;s just like I was talking to the wall. It was rude. Help us please.&#x201D;</p>

<p>&#x201C;They wanted to try to talk to him, to have him hear what was going on,&quot; Jessica Roff, a Sandy organizer who has been volunteering since the day after the storm, explained to DNAInfo. &#x201C;It&apos;s pretty desperate. It&apos;s really cold. It&apos;s getting colder. There are a lot of people without heat and hot water,&quot; she said. &#x201C;The health crisis is growing.&quot; After he left, she added that, &quot;People were pretty aggravated at the mayor. They were pretty aggravated with everybody. People were frustrated, but not surprised.&quot;</p>

<p>The Occupy movement has been instrumental in organizing relief efforts in neighborhoods that continue to recover from Hurricane Sandy&apos;s devastation, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141111125635/http://gothamist.com/2012/11/11/occupy_sandy_recognized_by_ny_times.php">even if it took weeks</a> for mainstream media to give them praise for it. You can volunteer with Occupy Sandy&apos;s efforts <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141111125635/http://interoccupy.net/occupysandy/volunteer/">by filling out a form here.</a></p>
