</div></div>					<p>It&apos;s still hard to believe that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170331221527/http://gothamist.com/tags/davidbowie">David Bowie</a> died over a year ago, just after celebrating his 69th birthday. But his presence can still be felt all over the city, at regular <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170331221527/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/01/bowie_tribute_carnegie_hall.php">tribute concerts</a> at local venues, shrines and artistic representations <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170331221527/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/29/david_bowie_tribute_nyc.php">on street corners</a>, and in the buildings he lived in and frequented. If you really want to follow in the footsteps of the Thin White Duke, one of Bowie&apos;s former apartments is on the market&#x2014;and best of all, it comes with one of his pianos!</p>

<p>A three-bedroom, two-and-a-half-bath Essex House apartment, which was owned by Bowie and wife Iman from 1992-2002, has been put on the market for $6.495 million. The condo, located on 58th Street between 6th and 7th Avenues, has clear and direct views of Central Park. Even better, it comes with the pristine Yamaha piano that was owned (and presumably played) by Bowie. </p>

<p>&quot;I would imagine it is hard to move but I think it&#x2019;s really a great catch for buyers,&#x201D; the apartment&#x2019;s exclusive agent, Bernice Leventhal of the Corcoran Group, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170331221527/http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/nyc-apartment-featuring-david-bowies-piano-market-65/story?id=46418785">told ABC News</a> regarding the inclusion of the historic piano. You can see more photos of the apartment, and more details of the listing, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170331221527/http://www.corcoran.com/nyc/Listings/Display/5098025">here.</a></p>

<p>Unfortunately, it seems like this is a package deal, and there&apos;s no way to pry the piano away from the apartment (unless you buy the latter). But if you need a little more pushing, just think about Bowie fiddling around on the keys with an early version of late-period classic &quot;Uncle Floyd,&quot; a.k.a. &quot;Slip Away.&quot;</p>
