<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110227092929/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/27/fashion/27Studied.html?_r=1">According to</a> a new study by a father and daughter team of psychologists, men are more than twice as likely to continue dating a woman if she has cheated on him with another woman than if she has cheated on him with another man. But wait, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110227092929/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/25/women_dont_like_sex_because_of_supp.php">we learned</a> yesterday that women don&apos;t even like to have sex unless it leads to commitment, or upping their market value, or something. Is it possible that women can only enjoy having sex if they&apos;re cheating on their boyfriends with another woman?</p>

<p>At least we know this study, &#x201C;Sex Differences in Response to Imagining a Partner&#x2019;s Heterosexual or Homosexual Affair,&#x201D; used a foolproof scientific method to come up with their results: they asked 700 college students to <em>imagine </em>catching their partner cheating on them. Because no duh, college students are the best group to poll for questions and issues about relationships. Especially imaginary relationships! </p>

<p>The researchers, doctoral student Jaime Confer and her father, psychology professor Mark Cloud, also speculate that if a woman catches a man cheating with another man, the woman will think they&apos;re gay, because we all know only women are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110227092929/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1333546/Flexisexual-The-new-word-women-refuse-play-straight.html">flexisexual</a>. But who even needs to cheat these days, when there are now <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110227092929/http://thedailywh.at/2011/02/26/facebook-apps-of-the-day/">two apps on Facebook</a> which will stalk your prey until they break up with the jackass they are currently dating, and let them know you&apos;re waiting for your turn.</p>
