<p>After stepping back from the spotlight to focus on being a preacher and deal with his legal troubles, sometime rapper and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150628142650/http://gothamist.com/2012/09/20/watch_computer-hating_dmx_question.php">full-time cyberphobe</a> DMX is already having an exciting 2014. He&apos;s going on an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150628142650/http://www.sohh.com/2014/01/dmx_packs_his_bags_ready_to_unleash_his.html">international tour</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150628142650/http://www.tmz.com/2014/01/09/dmx-anti-police-cop-suck-rant-video/">he&apos;s ranting about cops</a>, and it seems he&apos;s also crashing the occasional wedding party. </p>

But as delighted as they were, it&apos;s a bit unbelievable that nobody on the bus could match DMX&apos;s energy and stand up for the performance. Maybe this crowd leans more toward <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150628142650/http://theinclusive.net/article.php?id=46">Morris Day-MC&apos;d wedding jams.</a></p>
