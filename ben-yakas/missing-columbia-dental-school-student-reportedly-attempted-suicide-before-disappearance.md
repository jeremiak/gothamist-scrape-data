<p>The search for a Columbia University dental school student, who has been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426134255/http://gothamist.com/2014/04/06/columbia_dental_school_student_has.php">missing since last week</a>, continues this week. Jiwon Lee, 29, was last seen in her apartment on West 98th Street at 9:30 p.m. on Tuesday night. Police sources <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426134255/http://www.nydailynews.com/blogs/theshack/cops-missing-dental-student-attempted-suicide-week-disappearance-blog-entry-1.1749356">tell the Daily News that</a> Lee had attempted suicide a few days before her disappearance, and left notes at her apartment saying she was &quot;sorry she did not live up to expectations,&quot; and that she &quot;could not live anymore.&quot;</p>

<p>The News adds that she suffers from depression and bi-polar disorder. An anonymous police source <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426134255/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2598339/Loved-ones-hoping-best-search-student-missing-Manhattan-Tuesday.html">had told the Daily Mail</a> over the weekend that Lee had attempted suicide by pills and left notes (&quot;She wrote them all a letter that it was not their fault, she gave up on life.&quot;) but police <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426134255/http://www.cbsnews.com/news/search-for-missing-columbia-university-student-in-second-week/">initially officially denied those reports.</a></p>

<p>Lee&apos;s friend, Christiana Simon, told us that Lee last spoke with her brother, a Columbia med school student, and another caller, whose number was unknown to her friends. Simon says that number has since been disconnected, and that Lee&apos;s phone has been off since Wednesday morning. Her phone was last tracked to Washington Heights.</p>

<p>Lee served as the president of the American Student Dental Association, and worked for AmeriCorps, teaching math to middle school students in New York City. She also is a comedian: &quot;Prior to basically hanging up her comedy spurs to focus on higher education and a solid career, Jiwon was a familiar face on the comedy scene for years,&quot; wrote <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426134255/http://www.brooklynvegan.com/archives/2014/04/comedian_jinwon.html">Klaus Kinski at Brooklyn Vegan.</a> &quot;There was a time when I saw her name appear on so many upcoming comedy calendars it was ridiculous.&quot;</p>

<p>Lee&apos;s brother, Matt, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426134255/http://www.gofundme.com/840ci8">has set up a GoFundMe page</a> to hire a private investigator to continue the search: </p>

<blockquote>The NYPD has been amazing, but understandably have many responsibilities to attend to. We would like to pursue hiring a private detective at this time in order to expedite and prioritize the search process.  Any funds not used for the private detective will be used as a reward for information leading to her finding. We thank you for any contribution you may be able to make. </blockquote>

<p>Lee is described as being 5&apos;2&quot; and weighing 120 pounds. Anyone with any information about her whereabouts should contact Crimestoppers by calling 1-800-577-TIPS (8477), or submitting a tip via their <a href="www.nypdcrimestoppes.com">website</a>, or by texting a tip to 274637 (CRIMES) then enter TIP577. All calls are confidential. You can also directly call lead investigator Det. Alexander Cruz at 212-678-1863.</p>
