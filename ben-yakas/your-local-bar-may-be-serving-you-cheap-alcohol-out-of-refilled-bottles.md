<p>It&apos;s hard to underestimate the importance of alcohol: it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429155001/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/09/science_says_drinking_more_alcohol.php">boosts your energy</a>, it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429155001/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/21/go_ahead_have_a_few_cocktails_at_th.php">boosts your productivity</a>, and it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429155001/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/10/video_drunk_man_serenades_1_train_w.php">inspires great art</a>. Which is just a few reasons why <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429155001/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/rip_off_bars_in_pour_switch_ycQ5wI39GBMdGEF7YUlTML?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Local">the NY Post&apos;s report today</a> claiming that many bars around the city have taken to switching your booze for cheaper brands is so distressing. </p>

<p>The Post says that the State Liquor Authority has busted at least 25 establishments citywide for &#x201C;refilling&#x201D; liquor bottles. &#x201C;The consumer is getting ripped off, but he&#x2019;s just getting less alcohol than what he&#x2019;s paying for,&#x201D; an agency insider said, adding that the SLA doesn&apos;t always know whether drinks are being watered down, or if they&apos;re being replaced with cheaper substitutes. It&apos;s a good thing most people can&apos;t tell the difference <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429155001/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/26/cheap_vs_expensive_alcohol_the_deba.php">between good booze and cheap booze</a>!</p>

<p>Among the 25 places that were caught and fined are The Underground Lounge (a former manager admitted refilling bottles), The Patriot Saloon (they served &#x201C;Patriot&#x201D; beer that was just Blue Moon), and College Green Pub (the manager told an inspector &#x201C;he had to refill because all the other bars were doing it&#x201D;). So while all this may make you increasingly paranoid about the quality of your liquor, you can also use this as an excuse to dive into the world of mixology&#x2014;we know a great recipe <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429155001/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/26/best_candy_cocktail_recipe_artisana.php">sour power moonshine.</a> </p>
