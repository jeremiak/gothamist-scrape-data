<p>I was glued to CNN all last night until the wee hours of the morning, jumping in my skin every time Wolf Blitzer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161112092204/http://www.chron.com/news/politics/election/article/Wolf-Blitzer-s-campaign-coverage-is-driving-10602706.php">took a hit off the electoral map</a> and enthusiastically cued the CNN &quot;Key Race Alert&quot; graphic, (brought to you by Audi!). There is nothing healthy or good about watching election results roll in like that in a good year&#x2014;let alone in an election where a hate-fueled megalomaniac who couldn&apos;t give a shit about anyone other than himself was able to charm a majority of voters (what happened to those other 100 million American voters, by the way, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161112092204/https://twitter.com/davisusan/status/796252205804351488">who didn&apos;t vote?</a>). </p>

<p>But it was impossible to look away. Maybe if I subscribed to Showtime, I could have broken up the despair with Stephen Colbert&apos;s election night special, aptly named &quot;Stephen Colbert&#x2019;s Live Election Night Democracy&#x2019;s Series Finale: Who&#x2019;s Going to Clean Up This Shit?&quot; I was able to live stream the monologue, which looked completely tone-deaf and misguided (understandably so&#x2014;this was an election special that wasn&apos;t written thinking that the majority of its audience would be at knife&apos;s edge, clutching pillows and tissues). No one was in the mood to laugh at something that was no longer a tasteless joke gone too far. </p>

<p>But from what I&apos;ve watched this morning, Colbert experienced the same real time horror as many of us did&#x2014;he just had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161112092204/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/10/arts/television/stephen-colbert-showtime-uncomfortable-election.html">a camera pointed at him</a>. &quot;We all now feel the way Rudy Giuliani looks,&quot; he says at the top of the clip below, which came from the very end of the broadcast. The clip is titled, &quot;Stephen Tries To Make Sense Of All This,&quot; but it should have been titled, &quot;Stephen Drinks More Poison.&quot; </p>

<p>This segment, which came earlier in the evening, features Joel Heilemann and Mark Halperin, the documentarians behind Showtime&apos;s <em>The Circus.</em> This was the moment when Colbert&apos;s plans for the show decidedly went off-track, as he announces that Trump won Florida to audible gasps in the room. Halperin had the scariest line of the night: &quot;Outside of the Civil War, World War II and including 9/11, this may be the most cataclysmic event the country&#x2019;s ever seen.&quot;</p>

<p>&#x201C;Wow,&quot; Colbert said as Trump leapt toward 270. &quot;That&#x2019;s a horrifying prospect. I can&#x2019;t put a happy face on that, and that&#x2019;s my job.&quot;</p>

<p>There were other segments that I have not, and probably will not watch. This was the opening cartoon about the &quot;Dawn Of The Donald&quot; that brings up his &quot;cold, competitive&quot; father and Obama mocking him at the 2011 White House correspondents&#x2019; dinner. </p>

<p>Jeff Goldblum was one of the guests. He seemed as dazed as anyone else.</p>

<p>There was also an appearance by Melania Trump impersonator Laura Benanti. She is very good at this impression, so maybe you need something like this right now.</p>
