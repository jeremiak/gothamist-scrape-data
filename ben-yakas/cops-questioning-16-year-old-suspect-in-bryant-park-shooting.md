<p>Last night, a 14-year-old boy and a 20-year-old man <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140301084750/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/10/gunfire_at_bryant_park_two_injured.php">were shot while skating at the ice skating rink in Bryant Park</a>. Cops say they have now taken a 16-year-old suspect in for questioning; the suspect has been identified by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140301084750/http://pix11.com/2013/11/10/teenager-arrested-in-bryant-park-skating-rink-shooting/#axzz2kHDXQVop">various</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140301084750/http://nypost.com/2013/11/10/cops-bust-alleged-bryant-park-skating-rink-shooter/">media</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140301084750/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/cops-questioning-shooter-skating-returns-bryant-park-article-1.1512258">outlets</a> as Bronx resident Corey Dunton.</p>

<p>According to the Post, Dunton reportedly refused to answer questions and asked for a lawyer. &#x201C;He thinks he&#x2019;s a gangster,&#x201D; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140301084750/http://nypost.com/2013/11/10/cops-bust-alleged-bryant-park-skating-rink-shooter/">a source told Post</a>, adding that cops believe he may be a member of the Bloods. &#x201C;He think&#x2019;s he&#x2019;s a real tough guy.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Police <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140301084750/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/cops-questioning-shooter-skating-returns-bryant-park-article-1.1512258">told the News that</a> Javier Contreras, 20, is believed to have been the shooter&apos;s target; he was shot in the arm and hip allegedly over his Marmot Mammoth &#x201C;biggie&#x201D; jacket. Contreras is expected to recover. Adonis Mera, 14, was an innocent bystander who got caught in the crossfire; he was hit in the back, and it is unclear whether he will walk again.</p>

<p>Dunton appears to have been writing about the aftermath of the incident <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140301084750/https://www.facebook.com/FaddiebklueLoveLivess">on his Facebook</a>. You can see screenshots of those messages, including several in which he says police are banging on his door.</p>
