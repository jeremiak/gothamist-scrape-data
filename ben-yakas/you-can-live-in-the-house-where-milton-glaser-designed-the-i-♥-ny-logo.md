<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161214183434/http://gothamist.com/tags/miltonglaser">Milton Glaser</a>&#x2014;the man behind the &apos;I &#x2665; NY&apos; logo as well as the classic psychedelic Bob Dylan poster and the Brooklyn Brewery logo&#x2014;is one of the most celebrated graphic designers of the 20th century. And now, if you have some cash to spare and the will to leave the city, you can soak up some of his creativity at the home where he made his most iconic pieces. </p>

<p>Milton and Shirley Glaser announced last week that they are selling the gorgeous but not-too-big Woodstock home where Glaser designed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161214183434/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/26/original_sketch_for_i_3_ny.php">the &apos; I &#x2665; NY logo&apos;</a> (which was done pro bono!), among other things. Here&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161214183434/https://www.miltonglaser.com/news/1063/house-for-sale/">their explanation</a>: </p>

<blockquote>Over 50 years ago, Shirley and I bought an old farmhouse in the idiosyncratic and charming village of Woodstock. The town and its area share the beautiful qualities of the Hudson Valley and, for whatever reason, have never become gentrified. We&apos;ve added onto the house through the years and it is currently quite large and very unusual. With a grand room, a swimming pool, an extensive, beautifully planned garden and everything else that makes life in the country desirable, the house includes a beautiful and spacious studio, where I&apos;ve done some of my best work, including the &apos;I Love NY&apos; identity and the &apos;Dylan&apos; poster. Dylan, incidentally, lived in Woodstock for about 2 years, which was enough to create a small explosion of interest that has now, gratefully, subsided. The house itself is totally private and in many ways unique. Shirley and I have reached a point in our lives where downsizing has become the obvious choice, and are now in the process of seeking a buyer.</blockquote>

<p>The price for the 3 bedroom, 2 1/2 bath home stands at $1.8 million right now, which is about how much <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161214183434/http://gothamist.com/tags/realestate">an average apartment</a> costs in Manhattan or Brooklyn these days. You can see <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161214183434/https://www.villagegreenrealty.com/listing/148-lewis-hollow-woodstock-ny-12498-0000-20161041/">photos from the home here</a>, and watch a video tour of it below.</p>
