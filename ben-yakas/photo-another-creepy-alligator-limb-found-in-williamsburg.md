<p>This week, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130807015630/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/26/creepy_dismembered_alligator_limbs.php">several people reported finding</a> assorted alligator limbs in Williamsburg scattered near N. 10th Street. It seems the sicko (no judgments!) who put them there was at it again this weekend&#x2014;we have had two reports of another bloody limb on N. 10th Street on Saturday. &quot;Walking on Wythe Ave. this morning and spotted this severed gator hand on the sidewalk with flies swarming around the bloody stump,&quot; Tim Ichniowski told us. &quot;It&apos;s still there.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;This is certainly a mutilation situation, and it&apos;s a sick individual who would do that,&quot; &#x201C;Jungle Bob&#x201D; Smith, owner of Jungle Bob&apos;s Reptile World in Long Island, said earlier this week. &quot;They&apos;re not something that&apos;s common in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn, that&apos;s the part that befuddles me.&quot; If you see any more limbs, call the cops (and send any pics to tips@gothamist.com)&#x2014;and if you see someone putting the limbs out there, please tell them to just stop it already, they&apos;re scaring away future <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130807015630/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/05/disgruntled_williamsburg_resident_a.php">Purple Pants Men.</a></p>
