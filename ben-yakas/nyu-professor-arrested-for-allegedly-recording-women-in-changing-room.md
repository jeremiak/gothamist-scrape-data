<p>A respected NYU art history teacher was arrested on Monday and accused of being a peeping professor. Ross Finocchio, 34, was allegedly caught using his iPhone to spy on young women in the changing rooms at Beacon&apos;s Closet on Monday. &#x201C;He said, &#x2018;I&#x2019;m so embarrassed. I was recording myself for a project &#x2014; if I could just explain myself,&#x2019;&#x201D;  store manager Stephanie Williams <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131006171446/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/prof_perv_cam_bust_Bg8GzMiT2tnaiPKKbttF8I">told the Post</a>. Ahh, the old art project excuse&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131006171446/http://gothamist.com/tags/upskirt">classic upskirter stuff.</a></p>

<p>Finocchio allegedly set up his phone in a shoebox, and then slid it under the changing room partition to the next room. One 26-year-old victim says she saw the shoe slide into her room as she was getting undressed at 4:30 p.m. &#x201C;I told the store manager that I saw him put something under the door but I didn&#x2019;t see what it was,&#x201D; she told the Post. That woman and Williams then watched as Finocchio allegedly pulled the same stunt on a 28-year-old woman.</p>

<p>&#x201C;I knocked on [his dressing-room door] and said, &#x2018;You have to come out right now,&#x2019;&#x201D; said manager Stephanie Williams. When he came out, she said he &quot;was sweating profusely,&quot; and she snapped the photo above. Finocchio, a PhD student who also works at the Met, was charged with unlawful surveillance, a felony, and admitted to making the recordings, according to the criminal complaint.
