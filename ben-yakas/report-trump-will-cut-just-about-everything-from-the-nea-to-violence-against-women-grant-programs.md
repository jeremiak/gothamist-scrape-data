<p>Every day since the election, we&apos;ve had to wake up to increasingly alarming reports about the lack of preparedness and integrity on the part of the mostly-unqualified individuals Donald Trump has been told to choose for his cabinet picks. And now we&apos;re getting a much clearer sense of how sweeping the budget changes will be under Trump&#x2014;far more extreme than even House Republicans have previously proposed. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170606142722/http://thehill.com/policy/finance/314991-trump-team-prepares-dramatic-cuts">The Hill reports on</a> the dramatic changes that Trump&apos;s team are apparently set to make to slash government spending by $10.5 trillion over a decade (for some perspective, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170606142722/http://budget.house.gov/fy2016/summaryandkeyfacts.htm">the budget proposal put forward</a> by House Republicans last year promised to cut spending by $5.5 trillion over 10 years). </p>

<p>The administration&apos;s full budget likely won&apos;t be finalized until April, and there may be plenty more cuts included&#x2014;it&apos;s as yet unclear whether Trump&#x2019;s first budget will include reforms to Social Security or Medicare. The Hill reports that these budget cuts hew closely with a report last year by the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170606142722/http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php/Heritage_Foundation">Heritage Foundation</a>, a think tank that has helped staff the Trump transition team and has long lobbied to end all welfare programs. The two major Trump team members working on budget cuts, former Pence aides Russ Vought and John Gray (who also worked for Paul Ryan and Rand Paul), both previously worked at the Heritage Foundation as well. </p>

<p>In one small piece of less shitty news, potential energy secretary Rick Perry had a come-to-rational-Jesus moment at his confirmation hearing, admitting that the Department of Energy is vital and he regrets calling for its elimination. It&apos;s just too bad he has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170606142722/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/18/us/politics/rick-perry-energy-secretary-donald-trump.html?_r=0">absolutely no idea what he&apos;s doing.</a></p>
