<p>If you saw a mom with her child angrily yelling at a stranger on a bus or subway, what would you do? That&apos;s what we wondered as we watched the horrible video below of a particularly angry mom getting into a fist fight with another woman who she claims was &quot;disrespecting her baby.&quot; As for her child&#x2014;well, she threw the toddler out of the way into the arms of someone else on the bus. It&apos;s not like she let the kid&apos;s stroller <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130605040120/http://gothamist.com/2011/07/21/video_woman_lets_baby_in_stroller_r.php">roll out of a train or anything.</a></p>

<p>The video was reportedly filmed aboard a bus in Connecticut (although tipsters who sent it to us said it was somewhere in New York). The original YouTube upload of it has since been deleted (LiveLeak has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130605040120/http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=c9c_1365663563">picked it up</a>), but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130605040120/http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/1c4j67/mother_of_the_year/">one Redditor preserved</a> this comment from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130605040120/http://www.youtube.com/user/tareka281/feed?filter=2">Tareka281</a>: &quot;That&apos;s my bitch/home girl Fuck everybodys negative comments she shouldnt have threw the baby but she deserved to get in that girl ass lmao don&apos;t talk about nobodys child bitch&#xFEFF;.&quot;</p>
