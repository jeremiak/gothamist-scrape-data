<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144425/http://www.christianpost.com/news/jay-z-embraces-five-percent-nation-addresses-illuminati-and-questions-other-religions-99848/">Last year</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144425/http://gothamist.com/tags/jayz">Jay Z</a> raised some eyebrows when he wore a medallion with the logo of the Five-Percent Nation, an off-shoot of the Nation Of Islam <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144425/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2598174/Jay-Z-causes-controversy-wearing-medallion-group-believe-whites-wicked-weak.html">that believes</a> &quot;the black man is God and created the universe, and is physically stronger and intellectually stronger and more righteous naturally.&quot; Jay Z was spotted with the medallion again last week at a Nets game (see above), which means the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144425/http://nypost.com/2014/04/06/jay-zs-medallion-bears-logo-of-five-percent-radical-group/">NY Post is FREAKING OUT</a> that Jay Z hates white people now or something. </p>

<p>But it&apos;s time to wake up people, because this clearly is all just a bit of subterfuge in order to distract people from the truth: Jay Z is, will be, and always has been a ranking member of the one-world authoritarian government <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144425/http://gawker.com/5886988/a-comprehensive-guide-to-the-illuminati-the-conspiracy-theory-that-connects-jay-z-and-queen-elizabeth/all">known as the New World Order</a> that guides every important moment in history (kind of like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144425/http://observationdeck.io9.com/captain-america-the-winter-soldier-and-the-secrets-of-1558072929/1559129940/+rtgonzalez">The Winter Soldier</a>!). </p>

<p>Jay Z is dangling his car keys in front of you to keep you from knowing the truth about the Illuminati, the only <em>really</em> real secret society controlling real secret world events (that are real). Why do you think he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144425/http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/jul/19/jay-z-drops-hyphen-from-name">dropped the hyphen</a>? Nobody in the history of the Earth has dropped a hyphen from their name unless expressly told to by the Illuminati, that&apos;s just history.</p>

<p>Let&apos;s list all the evidence:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Medallion that looks like something out of <em>Indiana Jones And The Temple Of Doom</em>? Illuminati.</li>
	<li>He was wearing it on April Fool&apos;s Day? Illuminati. April Fool&apos;s Day is Opposite Day for the Illuminati.</li>
	<li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144425/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkgekVh7oKI&amp;feature=kp">Chanting &quot;Tom Ford&quot;</a> like an ancient spell? Illuminati.</li>
	<li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144425/http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/the-jay-z-illuminati-conspiracy-are-beyonce-and-jay-z-seducing-our-kids-into-the-occult">Hand signs</a>? Illuminati.</li>
	<li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144425/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/09/photo_is_jay-z_a_time_traveller_or.php">Time traveling</a>? Illuminati.</li>
	<li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144425/http://firstwefeast.com/eat/jay-z-and-beyonce-vegan-for-22-days-and-then-will-go-on-to-consume-tasty-animal-flesh/">Embracing vegetarianism</a>? Illuminati.</li>
	<li>&quot;Blue Ivy&quot; is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144425/http://gawker.com/5874744/jay-z-and-beyonces-daughter-is-almost-definitely-illuminati/all">secret code</a> for &quot;Born Living Under Evil, Illuminati&apos;s Very Youngest&quot;? Clearly a slip up by the Illuminati. Except they never slip up, so it&apos;s perfectly Illuminati of them to pull a triple-double mindfuck like that.</li>
<li>Could it just be a coincidence that Jay Z sold his stakes in the Nets just a few months before Phil Jackson was hired to bring his TRIANGLE basketball philosophy to the Knicks? There are no coincidences. Illuminati. </li>
	<li>Asked if the medallion were important to him, Jay Z shrugged and said &quot;<strong>a little bit</strong>.&quot; This is <em>classic</em> Illuminati trickery.</li>
	<li>Beyonce? So Illuminati there&apos;s a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144425/http://www.beyonce-illuminati.com/">website dedicated to revealing the truth.</a></li>
</ul>

<p>&quot;Jay Z is not an active member&#x2014;no one has vouched for him,&quot; Saladin Allah, a Five Percet Nation representative, told The Post. &quot;It was always understood that you don&#x2019;t wear the &#xAD;regalia if you don&#x2019;t totally subscribe to the life.&quot; So there you go. Case closed. We&apos;ve also broken down the photo above to try to show all the hard evidence of the Illuminati, in case you still have doubts.</p>
