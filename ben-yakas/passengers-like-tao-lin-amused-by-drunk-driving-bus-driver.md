<p>Earlier today, a tour bus <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602143620/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/12/tour_bus_accident_in_the_bronx_kill.php">overturned</a> on the southbound New England Thruway, killing 13 people. Yesterday afternoon, another bus avoided such a tragedy, when a bus driver of a NY-Baltimore BoltBus was arrested for allegedly driving drunk.</p>

<p>The driver was driving the packed bus erratically while headed south along the New Jersey Turnpike in Camden County, which caused a passenger to eventually dial 9-1-1, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602143620/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/42041953">according to</a> New Jersey State Police. According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602143620/http://thoughtcatalog.com/2011/bolt-bus-driver-arrested-for-drunk-driving-while-driving-bus/">Thought Catalog</a>, one passenger on the bus reported having seen a flask. The arresting officer added that this was the second drunk-driving bus-driver he had arrested this week. </p>

<p>Another passenger on board was writer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602143620/http://heheheheheheheeheheheehehe.com/">Tao Lin</a>, who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602143620/http://twitter.com/#!/tao_lin/status/46329796883529728">tweeted</a> aboard the bus that passengers were taking the incident with a sense of humor: &quot;<strong>someone said a &apos;happy hour&apos; joke &amp; everyone laughed, another person loudly referred to the arresting officer as &apos;the po po&apos; into cell phone.&quot;</strong></p>
