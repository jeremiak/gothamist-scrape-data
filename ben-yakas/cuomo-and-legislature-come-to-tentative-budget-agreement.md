<p>After weeks of fretting and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110328152423/http://gothamist.com/tags/statebudget">negotiations</a>, Gov. Andrew Cuomo is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110328152423/http://www.timesunion.com/news/article/NY-governor-Legislature-agree-to-tentative-budget-1309717.php">sealing a deal</a> with the Legislature on a tentative $132.5 billion state budget. State government <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110328152423/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/23/video_cuomo_warns_of_ny_state_gover.php">shutdown</a> (most likely) averted!</p>

<p>Cuomo had until April 1st to pass a budget and avoid a shutdown. The 2011-2012 budget is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110328152423/http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-03-27/new-york-s-cuomo-lawmakers-agree-on-budget-for-coming-year.html">reportedly</a> nearly identical to the proposal Cuomo presented Feb. 1. According to AP, &quot;Cuomo says the budget will set New York on a new course after decades of overspending and overtaxing that have driven residents out of state for better opportunities.&quot; </p>

<p>This budget would reduce spending overall by more than 2 percent, and it also addresses a $10 billion deficit with spending cuts without new taxes. Among other things, it will eliminate 3,700 prison beds, redesign Medicaid and cap education spending. The Legislature must still pass the sweeping budget bills before Friday. But hey, what could possibly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110328152423/http://gothamist.com/2009/06/09/coup_in_albany_golisano_helps_gop_t.php#photo-1">go wrong</a>?</p>
