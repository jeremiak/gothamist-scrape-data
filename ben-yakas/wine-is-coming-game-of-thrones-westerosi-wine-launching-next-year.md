<p>There have already been three different kinds of beers made by Ommegang in tribute to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504233422/http://gothamist.com/tags/gameofthrones"><em>Game Of Thrones</em></a> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504233422/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/17/got_beer_hboommegang_releasing_iron.php">Lannister</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504233422/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/18/ommegang_reveals_second_game_of_thr.php">Night&apos;s Watch</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504233422/http://gothamist.com/2014/04/07/ommegangs_game_of_thrones_beer_chan.php">Targaryen</a> style), but now a group of fans have crafted a series of wines that even Cersei Lannister would approve of. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504233422/http://www.thewinesofwesteros.com/">The Wines of Westeros</a> is set to launch next year alongside season five of GOT. </p>

<p>There are red and white wines for 12 houses (Stark, Lannister, Greyjoy, Arryn, Baratheon, Dothraki, Tyrell, White Walker, Wilding, Martell, Night&apos;s Watch and Targaryen), and include Sauvignon Blancs, Pinot Noirs, Merlots, Chardonnay, Cabernet Sauvignons and Shiraz wines. &quot;The reds are all associated with the houses that are head strong and robust. The whites on the other hand are more cunning, perceptive and mysterious,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504233422/http://www.thedrinksbusiness.com/2014/06/game-of-thrones-wines-westeros/">explained Jane Burlop</a> of Common Ventures.</p>

<p>Bottles will cost $20 AUS ($19 USD). If you want to learn more about the wines created by George R.R.
