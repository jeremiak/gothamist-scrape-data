<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111018082554/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/09/ben_and_jerrys_lend_delicious_suppo.php">This weekend</a>, Ben and Jerry&apos;s became the first corporate company to publicly throw their support behind the ongoing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111018082554/http://gothamist.com/tags/occupywallstreet">Occupy Wall Street</a> protests. And now <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111018082554/http://www.tauntr.com/content/ben-jerrys-occupie-wall-street-ice-cream">Tauntr has envisioned</a> a new ice cream flavor for them that perfectly captures the zeitgeist: OccuPie Wall Street. It is filled with, &quot;Apple Pie Ice Cream with some other good stuff in there we think. We&apos;re not really sure. No one can explain it to us.&quot; </p>

<p>Unfortunately, like the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111018082554/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/22/the_dude_a_la_modes_big_lebowski_ic.php">&quot;Dude Food,&quot;</a> this is only a beautiful dream thus far. But if this ever became a reality&#x2014;and really, is there any better way to put their money where their mouth is than to come out with an ice cream flavor whose profits would all go toward the protesters?&#x2014;it could occupy our stomachs any time.</p>
