Who&apos;s in?&quot; Jamie Kilstein of Citizen Radio <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502142135/https://twitter.com/#!/jamiekilstein/status/122023456517783552">confirmed it</a>: &quot;So I will be at #occupywallstreet tonight with one of my heroes @TalibKweli.&quot; OWS spokesman Patrick Bruner told us details were stilll being worked out, but &quot;it appears as though he is planning on coming.&quot;</p>

<p>Russell Simmons <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502142135/http://twitter.com/#!/UncleRUSH/status/122037587799060480">also confirmed</a> he&apos;d be at Liberty Plaza waiting for him: &quot;RT @TalibKweli: NYC to #occupywallstreet 8pm tonight. Who&apos;s in? Thanks I&apos;m in!!! Liberty plaza.&quot; We&apos;ll update the post when we know more information, but we presume that he&apos;ll be performing some songs.</p>

<p>Kweli published a very pro-Occupy Wall Street essay by Kevin Powell <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502142135/http://www.yearoftheblacksmith.com/features/occupy-wall-street-the-revolution-will-be-multiplied-by-kevin-powell">on his website today</a> as well. Yesterday, Kweli <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502142135/http://stereogum.com/832761/black-stars-mos-def-and-talib-kweli-do-the-colbert-report/video/">appeared on <em>The Colbert Report</em></a> to perform a few songs from his fantastic late &apos;90s one-off underground hip hop project, <em>Mos Def And Talib Kweli Are Black Star</em>&#x2014;you can watch &#x201C;Astronomy (8th Light)&#x201D; below. Maybe that means there&apos;ll be an appearance tonight from Kweli&apos;s Black Star partner, <strike>Mos Def</strike> Yasiin Bey?</p>
