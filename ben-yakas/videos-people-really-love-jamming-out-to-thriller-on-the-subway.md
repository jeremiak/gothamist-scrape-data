<p>Every once in a while, we find it&apos;s important to stop and recognize passion when it is literally screaming in our face and won&apos;t stop&#x2014;that&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160115213707/http://gothamist.com/2012/09/15/videos_brooklyn_subway_treated_to_v.php">what we did last year</a> when we came across one enthusiastic straphanger who loves to shout-sing Michael Jackson&apos;s &quot;Thriller&quot; for his fellow underground travelers. Except it turns out that <em>everyone</em> loves jamming out to &quot;Thriller,&quot; and/or watching others do so. Like this gentleman who let loose at Times Square this week.</p>

<p>What is this song that can inspire disparate groups of people to unite in service of a higher, semi-coordinated calling?</p>
