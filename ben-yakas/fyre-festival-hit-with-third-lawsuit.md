<p>Despite being a resounding success that has garnered more headlines than Coachella and Lollapalooza combined, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170504235914/http://gothamist.com/2017/04/28/fyre_festival.php">Fyre Festival</a> has had to contend with a few bad eggs who just couldn&apos;t embrace a curated, multi-sensory spectacle in the Bahamas that gave wealthy and aspiring wealthy people the chance to show off their wilderness survival skills and enter a real life <em>Hunger Games.</em> A lawsuit has been filed in New York against the festival and its organizers Ja Rule and Billy McFarland, making it the third such lawsuit against the festival in the last week.</p>

<p>According to the class-action lawsuit, which was filed in federal court in New York, attendees Matthew Herlihy and Anthony Lauriello are suing over what they allege were Fyre organizers&apos; &quot;false representations, material omissions, and negligence regarding the Fyre Festival and their failure to organize, prepare, and provide attendees with the experience that the Defendants marketed as being a luxurious private-island getaway.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Upon the arrival of guests to the island of Great Exuma for the first weekend, the island was lacking basic amenities, was covered in dirt, and guests had to sleep in tents with wet blankets,&quot; the suit states. &quot;There were no communal showers or bathrooms as promised; instead there were porta potties (only about one for every 200 yards) that were knocked down and only three showers although there were hundreds of people arriving &#x2026; Additionally, there were no other basic amenities like soap, sunscreen and shampoo, and no electricity.&quot; </p>

<p>Herlihy and Lauriello, who each bought $1,027 ticket packages, say they were also robbed of headphones, jeans, sneakers, and other personal items. You can look through the suit below, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170504235914/http://pitchfork.com/news/73234-fyre-festival-hit-with-third-lawsuit/?mbid=social_twitter">via Pitchfork</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170504235914/http://laist.com/2017/05/01/fyre_fest_lawsuit.php">The first lawsuit</a>, which was filed in the Central District of California by celebrity trial lawyer Mark Geragos, stated that they anticipate a class of &quot;more than 150&quot; plaintiffs for whom it seeks a minimum of $100 million. The suit refers to the event as &quot;complete disaster,&quot; &quot;mass chaos&quot; and a &quot;post-apocalyptic nightmare.&quot; </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170504235914/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/fyre-festival-sparks-class-action-lawsuit-999793">The second lawsuit</a>, also filed in California on behalf of Chelsea Chinery, Shannon McAuliffe and Desiree Flores, claims that organizers tricked people into attending the event by paying more than 400 social media influencers and celebrities to promote it. &quot;Social media &apos;influencers&apos; made no attempt to disclose to consumers that they were being compensated for promoting the Fyre Festival,&quot; wrote attorney John Girardi. &quot;As Plaintiffs began to grasp the dire nature of the situation, upon witnessing the complete lack of infrastructure necessary to host such an event, a panic enveloped the crowd. Plaintiffs were stuck on the island, with no way off.&quot;</p>
