<p>A NYC resident who traveled to Hawaii to hike got trapped in a blinding snowstorm for two days near the summit of a volcano and had to be rescued. Because of course a New Yorker would escape NYC in the dead of winter, travel to a beautiful tropical paradise, and somehow end up snowed-in.</p>

<p>Queens local Alex Sverdlov, 36, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150103063451/http://www.nps.gov/havo/parknews/sverdlov.htm">was making an 18-mile trek</a> to the peak of the 13,000-foot Mauna Loa volcano at Hawaii Volcanoes National Park on Tuesday when a snowstorm struck. It was a blinding white-out, and Sverdlov had to hunker down for the night with only the clothes he had on and a bottle of frozen water. He ended up spending two nights on the mountain, and wasn&apos;t rescued until Thursday morning.</p>

<p>&quot;I&apos;ve done many crazy hikes, but this one pretty much tops the bill,&quot; said Sverdlov, an experienced hiker who successfully summited Mauna Loa last winter. &quot;Even the most experienced and prepared hikers can get into trouble in the park,&quot; said Park Ranger John Broward. &quot;What saved Alex is that he had a backcountry permit so we knew he was up there, he is extremely fit, and he stayed calm. We&apos;re all fortunate this had a happy ending.&quot; </p>

<p>After his rescue, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150103063451/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/New-York-Hiker-Trapped-Hawaii-Mauna-Loa-Volcano-Snowstorm-242904701.html">Sverdlov applied</a> for another backcountry permit, this time for the park&apos;s remote coastal area: &quot;This time I&apos;m going to the sunny part of the park,&quot; he said. Next time he should make sure to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150103063451/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9lceeNQMwk&quot;">bring along a flibbertigibbet</a> for good luck.</p>
