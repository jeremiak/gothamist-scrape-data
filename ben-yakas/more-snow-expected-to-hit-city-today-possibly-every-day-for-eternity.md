<p>It&apos;s been a solid 30 hours or so since <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140424140434/http://gothamist.com/2014/02/13/thundersnow_cometh.php">the last snowstorm</a> hit the city, so clearly it&apos;s time for another one: something between 2 and 6 inches are expected to hit the city today. According to the latest missive from our weather tracking overlords [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140424140434/http://www.erh.noaa.gov/okx/WxBriefing_FB.pdf">PDF</a>], the snow should start in earnest around noon and continue through the evening. No point <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140424140434/http://gothamist.com/2014/02/14/snowed_in_cars_nyc.php">digging out your car</a> now, is there?</p>

<p>A Winter Storm Warning is in effect starting at 11 a.m. through midnight tonight; most forecasters predict that Long Island will be hit worse, with up to 8 inches there. But if that doesn&apos;t sate your snow lust, let the Post soothe you with these some scare quotes: &quot;We&#x2019;re most likely looking at two to four inches of accumulation,&#x201D; AccuWeather&#x2019;s Dave Dombek <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140424140434/http://nypost.com/2014/02/14/no-relief-six-more-inches-of-snow-predicted-for-nyc/">told The Post</a>. &quot;But this is one of those things that, at the last minute, it could overachieve and maybe come in at six inches.&quot;</p>

<p>Regardless, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140424140434/http://gothamist.com/tags/snow">we are battled-tested warriors</a> at this point, so a few more inches can&apos;t scare us. On the plus side, the snowfall will bring 2013/2014 a step closer to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140424140434/http://gothamist.com/2014/02/14/history_snow_nyc.php">immortality in the snow rankings.</a> On the other hand, is anyone else starting to feel like maybe <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140424140434/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinner_(film)">NYC accidentally ran over an elderly gypsy woman while driving</a> and now her father has cursed us all &quot;snowier&quot;? </p>

<p>After this, we shouldn&apos;t see another snowflake touch the city until, oh, Tuesdayish. Forget it Jake, and enjoy a timelapse of the last snowstorm below.</p>
