<p>Former Walkmen multi-instrumentalist Walter Martin unveiled his first solo album&#x2014;a charming children&apos;s album called <em>We Are All Young Together</em> that doesn&apos;t sound much like what you assume a children&apos;s album should sound like&#x2014;at an intimate show at Joe&apos;s Pub last Friday. He was joined by indie rock luminaries (including Karen O &amp; Nick Zinner of the Yeah Yeah Yeah&apos;s and fellow former Walkman Hamilton Leithauser) to perform songs about animals and The Beatles&apos; hairstyles. I haven&apos;t been able to get the song &quot;We Like The Zoo&quot; out of my head ever since&#x2014;and today, you too will get the song stuck in your head thanks to a lovely music video featuring supermodel Lily McMenamy dancing around Manhattan to the tune.</p>

<p>&quot;I made <em>We&#x2019;re All Young Together</em> basically for parents, as well as for kids too young to decide what they want to listen to before they discover Katy Perry,&quot; Martin <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140523194838/http://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/05/19/music-video-walter-martin-the-walkmen-lily-mcmenamy-kt-auleta/">told the Times</a>, adding that he was influenced by classic songwriters such as Randy Newman, Michael Hurley and Jonathan Richman. </p>

<p>He also explained the concept for the music video for the song (which features The National&apos;s Matt Berninger on vocals), which was directed by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140523194838/http://ktauleta.com/">KT Auleta</a>: &quot;KT is friends with my wife, and we were talking about this concept for a video she and Lily had,&quot; Martin said. &quot;I thought it was so funny I suggested she use my song for it. It&#x2019;s bright, fun and spontaneous, and I loved how &apos;New York&apos; it was. It basically follows the theme of the song &#x2014; how people are animals, basically. The beast in us is just wild at heart.&quot;</p>
