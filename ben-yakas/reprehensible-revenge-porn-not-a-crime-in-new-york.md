<p>A Brooklyn man who shared naked photos of his ex-girlfriend on Twitter has had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160919232838/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/revenge-porn-case-put-bed-article-1.1620648">all criminal charges dropped against him</a>. &quot;The Court concludes that defendant&apos;s conduct, while reprehensible, does not violate any of the criminal statutes under which he is charged,&#x201D; wrote Criminal Court Judge Steven Statsinger in his decision this week.</p>

<p>BedStuy resident Ian Barber, 29, was charged with three criminal counts for uploading the pics of his ex in July 2013: aggravated harassment, dissemination of unlawful surveillance and public display of offensive sexual material, all misdemeanors. Barber initially told detectives his ex gave him permission, something she denied. </p>

<p>But even if there was no permission, Judge Statsinger knocked down every one of the charges: it wasn&apos;t aggravated harassment because Barber didn&apos;t directly send communications to his ex, it&apos;s not unlawful surveillance unless the pictures were obtained illegally (which hadn&apos;t been claimed), and &quot;a subscription service like Twitter&quot; doesn&apos;t count as public display (nudity alone also isn&apos;t considered &quot;offensive&quot; sexual material). </p>

<p>Statsinger wrote that, &quot;This case appears to the first in which a New York court has considered criminal charges stemming from what has come to be known as &apos;revenge porn.&apos;&quot; While that&apos;s technically true&#x2014;only California and New Jersey have laws on the books addressing revenge porn&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160919232838/http://blog.ericgoldman.org/archives/2013/12/revenge-porn-plot-leads-to-criminal-conviction-new-york-v-piznarski-forbes-cross-post.htm">there was a case last year</a> in which a student at Colgate University was convicted for <em>threatening</em> to commit revenge porn. Specifically, he was found guilty of &#x201C;unlawful surveillance&#x201D; and &#x201C;coercion&#x201D; after he secretly videotaped sex with two different women and threatened to publicly release them unless they had more sex with him; he was sentenced to 1-3 years in prison. </p>

<p>In addition, several Albany lawmakers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160919232838/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/04/albany_is_coming_for_your_revenge_p.php">introduced legislation last year</a> that would make disclosing sexually explicit images without the subject&apos;s consent a misdemeanor.</p>
