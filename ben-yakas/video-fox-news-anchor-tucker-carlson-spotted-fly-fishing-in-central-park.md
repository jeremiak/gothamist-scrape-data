<p>You know that middle-aged dude in the dorky Dad poncho you&apos;ve seen fly fishing in Central Park? Yeah, it turns out that might have been Fox News personality and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502124248/http://dailycaller.com/footer/about-us/">Daily Caller</a> editor-in-chief Tucker Carlson. Man about town <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502124248/https://twitter.com/JoeyBoots">Joey Boots</a> stumbled upon Carlson, sans bow tie, fly fishing yesterday afternoon around 4 p.m. in the park. &quot;I had no idea who he was when I was talking to him,&quot; Boots told us. &quot;It was very fucking weird.&quot; You can see video of their interaction below.</p>

<p>&quot;I was on Central Park South on the wall and saw this guy fly fishing,&quot; Boots continued. &quot;I thought, &apos;Wow I&apos;ve never seen this before.&apos; I didn&apos;t know if it was legal, so I started taking video.&quot; In case you were wondering, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502124248/http://www.nytimes.com/1997/05/18/nyregion/fly-fishing-s-niche-in-central-park.html">it is legal</a>: there are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502124248/http://www.nycgovparks.org/facilities/fishing">three parts of Central Park</a> that you can fly fish (the Central Park Lake, the Central Park Pond, and the Harlem Meer). You do <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502124248/http://www.dec.ny.gov/63.html">need a license</a> to do so if you&apos;re over 18. </p>

<p>Carlson, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502124248/http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/03/27/tucker-carlson-takes-over-fox-friends-weekend-edition/">who became the co-host</a> of the weekend editions of &#x201C;Fox &amp; Friends&#x201D; this month, may be best known <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502124248/http://politicalhumor.about.com/library/bljonstewartcrossfire.htm">for getting publicly reamed</a> on <em>Crossfire</em> by Jon Stewart in 2004. He&apos;s also an avid fly fisher, it seems. In a piece <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502124248/http://www.theatlanticwire.com/entertainment/2010/03/tucker-carlson-what-i-read/20031/">for The Atlantic</a>, he talked about his daily reading habits: &quot;The Atlantic, the New Yorker, The New Republic, <strong>four different fly fishing magazines</strong>, The Weekly Standard, Vanity Fair.&quot;</p>

<p>Overall, Boots said he was charmed by Carlson: &quot;He was really, really nice. I think he became cognizant he was on camera, and he didnt want to look like a dick. When I started telling him that CNN stuff, he was humoring me. He realized I didn&apos;t know who the fuck he was.&quot; Carlson, who said he thought it was &quot;neat&quot; that Boots has approximately 10K Twitter followers, did lie to him about being on Twitter: Carlson <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502124248/https://twitter.com/TuckerCarlson">has over 128K followers.</a> Or maybe he was just accidentally admitting he doesn&apos;t run his own feed.</p>
