<p>Last year, a 47-year-old Brooklyn assistant principal <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130907030949/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/20/brooklyn_asst_principal_accused_of.php">was accused of making inappropriate sexual comments</a> to at least three teenage girls, including one whom he allegedly propositioned in exchange for a summer job. A report released today goes further, alleging that Progress High School for Professional Careers assistant principal William Abreu forcibly raped the 17-year-old female student who had applied for the job. </p>

<p>In the course of their probe, investigators say they learned that the person who helps run the after school program there, Juan Martinez, forced a different 16-year-old girl into performing oral sex on him. According to Special Commissioner of Investigation Richard J. Condon&apos;s report, both Abreu and Martinez sexually abused both girls. And it gets worse:</p>

<blockquote>Abreu told the younger student that having sex with him and Martinez was a condition of her office job at Progress High, and he asked her to have sex with others in exchange for money. Abreu also threatened to report the 17-year-old graduate to Immigration authorities, and he stole $1,500 from her mother on the false promise that he would obtain an attorney&#x2019;s services for her.</blockquote>

<p>According to the earlier report, Abreu allegedly said to the 15-year-old girls, &#x201C;Would you suck my balls for me? That&#x2019;s the things [sic] you have to do to succeed...You have to come to work looking sexy, so I can see how pretty you are.&#x201D; Condon has recommended both men be dismissed immediately, and barred from future employment with the DOE or any of its affiliates. </p>

<p>Progress High School was previously in the news in 2010 when it came out that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130907030949/http://gothamist.com/2010/06/14/doe.php">teachers and staff went on a two-day retreat to the Hudson Valley</a>, where they enjoyed all-you-can-eat buffets and rooms costing up to $770 a night in the middle of a schools expense crisis.<br>
