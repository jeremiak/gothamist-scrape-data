<p>Less than a month ago, upscale kosher food court Milk Street Cafe <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602125702/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/14/milk_street_cafe_closing_tomorrow_a.php">closed its doors</a> in the Financial District permanently only six months after opening; owner Marc Epstein described himself as &quot;collateral damage&quot; from the ousted Occupy Wall Street encampment, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602125702/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/01/wall_street_restaurant_owner_lays_o.php">which he blamed</a> for hurting business. But maybe the space just needed a true entrepreneur to run it properly&#x2014;someone who is ultra-classy, who never knows when to back down. Someone who has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602125702/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/27/donald_trump_has_enormous_balls_esp.php">&quot;enormous balls&quot;</a>. To that end, the site at 40 Wall Street will soon rise like a phoenix upon the financially-backed wings of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602125702/http://gothamist.com/tags/donaldtrump">The Donald.</a></p>

<p>Fresh off another <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602125702/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/24/its_not_you_its_me_donald_trump_bre.php">publicly humiliating foray</a> into politics, Donald Trump is bouncing back <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602125702/http://www.zagat.com/buzz/the-donald-will-open-a-restaurant-in-tribeca">by opening</a> Trump Street Bar &amp; Grill at the Tribeca space. It&apos;s an easy fit for Trump: he already owns the building that houses the cafe, and he plans to keep most of the employees. &#x201C;We are trying to retain as many of the employees as possible,&#x201D; Steve Lafiosca, Trump&#x2019;s director of commercial properties, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602125702/http://www.tribecatrib.com/news/2012/january/1189_trump-plans-wall-street-food-hall-where-former-kosher-one-failed.html">told Tribeca Tribune</a>. &#x201C;We&#x2019;ve told everybody to try and hang in there, we&#x2019;re going to try and open up as soon as we can.&#x201D;</p>

<p>According to the Tribeca Tribune, he&apos;s getting rid of the kosher theme, and adding the bar instead. Community Board 1&#x2019;s Financial District Committee has already voted unanimously to approve their liquor license. What are the chances that he makes other changes to the space? Might the furniture be decked out in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602125702/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/18/video_inside_donald_trumps_private.php">&quot;yards and yards of gold silk?&quot;</a></p>
