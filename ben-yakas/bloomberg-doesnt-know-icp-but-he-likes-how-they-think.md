title: Bloomberg Doesn't Know ICP, But He Likes How They Think

<p>Last week, Mayor Bloomberg started <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110516030035/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/04/dear_mayor_bloomberg_how_do_magnets.php">answering questions</a> that were taken from Twitter during his weekly radio show with John Gambling on WOR. In particular, Bloomberg took time out to answer in specific detail, &quot;Fucking magnets? How do they work?&quot; But this morning, Bloomberg and Gambling <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110516030035/http://www.nydailynews.com/blogs/dailypolitics/2011/03/mayor-bloomberg-on-getting-clowned-by-insane-clown-posse-inspired-twitter-ques">revealed that</a> they were unaware of the connection between the question and its originators, the Insane Clown Posse. &quot;Well, I saw what it was, and we answered the question that they asked...I just dropped the profanity from the beginning,&quot; Grampa Bloomberg explained.</p>

<p>Bloomberg was particularly piqued by the question because, as he revealed last week, he studied physics in school and was an electrical engineering student (albeit one who couldn&apos;t pass a German language class). This week, Gambling challenged him to answer another science-related <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110516030035/http://twitter.com/kjar211/status/45923989914259457">Twitter question</a> on why the street lamps are shut off on the Cross-Bronx Expressway, and he proceeded to lament about the trouble of dealing with stupid imprecise technology:</p>

<blockquote>Generally the streetlights, I don&apos;t know about the Bronx expressway, Cross-Bronx Expressway. But generally streetlights have a light sensor. So if you were to have an eclipse of the sun, for example, the lights should turn on. Now they don&apos;t, it&apos;s how they&apos;re set or whether the sensor is, has some dirt on it or not or broken. I don&apos;t know about the Bronx, sir, but that&apos;s generally how the lights are, are done. There are some places where they&apos;re all on one circuit and somebody, or a timer, throws a switch. The trouble with a timer is you have to change it. Every day the darkness, sunset and sunrise change every day, unless you live on the equator, in which case it&apos;s always the same.</blockquote>

<p>In case you were wondering, Bloomberg didn&apos;t have a chance to answer the followup Twitter question asked by the same user, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110516030035/http://twitter.com/kjar211/status/45924780196626432">which was</a>: &quot;why do you continue to destroy the working class by messing with city workers, police, fire dept and teachers?&quot;</p>
