<p>This week, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429165122/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/06/police_arrested_driver_who_did_24-m.php">police arrested</a> Christopher Tang, the driver who released a video claiming he had set the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429165122/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/30/video_driver_claims_record_for_fast.php">record for the fastest loop around Manhattan</a>. Tang, 30, is accused of driving from the FDR Drive around to the Henry Hudson Parkway and back in 24 minutes. Tang <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429165122/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/speed-demon-circled-manhattan-24-min-boasts-wild-ride-article-1.1448197">defended himself in statements</a> to police, arguing that he was &quot;driving safely&quot; despite racing across Manhattan around 4 a.m. on August 26th. &quot;I was out for a drive and I wanted to see how quickly I could drive around Manhattan,&quot; he said. &quot;I took the entire ride of 26 miles in 24 minutes. <strong>I was exceeding the speed limit, although I did not hit 100 miles per hour.&quot;</strong></p>

<p>Tang, who is a professional day trader, has been charged with reckless endangerment, reckless driving, speed violation and traffic device violation for the drive. He admitted that he &quot;did go through a red light (but) it was not at an intersection. It was only at a pedestrian crossing.&quot;</p>

<p>Prosecutors argued that Tang, who has lived for two-and-a-half years in NYC with his wife, has &quot;numerous&quot; past driving violations and is a potential flight risk. He &quot;makes enough money day trading that he doesn&apos;t even need to do anything else for support.&quot; Tang faces up to a year in prison if convicted.</p>

<p>Tang previously bragged that he wasn&apos;t worried about being caught: &quot;You frankly can&apos;t identify who I am by just looking at the video and records were meant to be broken. I&apos;ll release my name a year from now,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429165122/http://jalopnik.com/driver-claims-new-record-for-fastest-lap-around-manhatt-1220993047">he told Jalopnik</a>. According <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429165122/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/07/nyregion/police-arrest-driver-who-raced-around-manhattan.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">to the Times</a>, police were able to recreate the ride by using surveillance video, which helped them to track down Tang.</p>
