<p>A man <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150314023447/http://nypost.com/2014/04/03/customer-arrested-after-allegedly-slashing-his-masseuse/">has been accused of slashing</a> a masseuse who refused to give him a happy ending, then taking off in a stolen yellow cab. Suspect Kenneth Lee is also believed to have mugged a delegate from the Chinese Consulate that same week.</p>

<p>Police <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150314023447/http://nypost.com/2014/04/03/customer-arrested-after-allegedly-slashing-his-masseuse/">tell the Post</a> that Lee, 29, met the 21-year-old masseuse at a West 43rd Street apartment&#x2014;which she rented through AirBNB on March 22nd&#x2014;after he responded to her ad on Backpage.com. First they got into an argument over the price of the massage, then Lee allegedly demanded she finish him off afterwards, which she refused. Lee allegedly pulled out a boxcutter and slashed her right bicep.</p>

<p>Lee then allegedly jumped into an unattended yellow taxi parked near the apartment; the driver, who inexplicably left his keys in the ignition, was eating pizza nearby, and watched as Lee sped off in his car. Cops tracked the car to Sunnyside, where Lee was arrested on charges of assault and attempted robbery. No charges have been filed against the taxi driver for the crime of WHO IN THEIR RIGHT MIND LEAVES THEIR KEYS IN THE IGNITION.</p>

<p>Cops then determined that Lee had also assaulted a 59-year-old delegate for the Chinese consulate the day before on 12th Avenue and West 43rd Street. Lee allegedly punched the woman in the head, snatched her pocketbook and ran away; the victim suffered a minor injury to her cheek, and Lee was charged with robbery in that incident.</p>
