<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425173049/http://gothamist.com/tags/louisck">Louis C.K.</a> is the guest on the first episode of the new season of Jerry Seinfeld&apos;s web series, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425173049/http://gothamist.com/tags/ComediansinCarsGettingCoffee">Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee</a>, and he does not disappoint. After getting picked up a 1959 Fiat Jolly (a no-doors car Seinfeld thinks even Hitler could love), they head to C.K.&apos;s boat to talk all about why C.K. won&apos;t shave his facial hair, the future of <em>Louie</em>, and going to see movies stoned. It&apos;s great enough that we get to see C.K. as a man of the sea&#x2014;he also tells the full story of how <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425173049/http://gothamist.com/2012/09/04/photo_louis_cks_yacht_gets_stuck_in.php">he got his yacht stuck in the mud</a> (that story starts at 17:15). </p>

<p>Among the other highlights: C.K. says he&apos;s already done writing 10 episodes of the new season of <em>Louie</em> (you can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425173049/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/04/louis_ck_talks_upcoming_season_of_l.php">learn more about season 4 here</a>), and comedian Stephen Wright is helping him with it (C.K. says he&apos;s bouncing ideas off of him). He also mentions that he can imagine doing the show for &quot;7 or 8 years tops,&quot; although Seinfeld argues he should do more because <em>Louie</em> &quot;can grow with you.&quot; &quot;My show was about four single people doing this certain type of lifestyle,&quot; Seinfeld adds. &quot;We didn&apos;t want to do Kramer&apos;s 50th birthday party.&quot;</p>

<p>Seinfeld talks about his relationship with Larry David: &quot;We were on the phone for half an hour a couple of days ago, and the [fact David played golf with President Obama] didn&apos;t come up.&quot; C.K. says he considers NYC his home &quot;for sure,&quot; and he absolutely loves going to the movie theater to see 3D Imax films stoned&#x2014;doing that comes right under sex and good comedy on his list of favorite things.</p>
