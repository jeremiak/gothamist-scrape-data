<p>How can you tell when you&apos;ve been slinging drugs for too long on the same corner? When police are able to use Google Maps to identify you. NYPD set up a sting on a drug crew working near the Cooper Park Houses in East Williamsburg yesterday, busting seven dealers including three whose faces <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429071652/http://maps.google.com/maps?q=kingsland+ave+and+jackson+st&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=Kingsland+Ave+%26+Jackson+St,+Brooklyn,+NY+11211&amp;gl=us&amp;ei=tgLcTLPnEYOC8gbs4KHsCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=geocode_result&amp;ct=image&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBcQ8gEwAA">were captured</a> in the Google street view. And the police did so in the guise of hipsters. &quot;<strong>They were catering to the hipster crowd, among other customers</strong>,&quot; one law-enforcement source told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429071652/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/druggies_snared_in_google_web_QZgVELDZvnvfGy6BMZlu9K">the Post.</a></p>

<p>The suspects in the Google photo were identified as Shaundell Dade (in the red coat), Jamel Pringle, and Jonathan Paulino, who is the suspected ringleader of the crew. He allegedly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429071652/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/11/11/2010-11-11_say_7_had_corner_on_smack_sales.html">was caught</a> in a basement apartment where cops found 20 glassines of heroin, marijuana and a packaging laboratory that included envelopes, scales and stamps. The suspects were caught on surveillance camera allegedly stashing their heroin in a magnetic lock box secured to the back of the Neighborhood Grocery&apos;s metal signs, unknown to the owner of the store. Undercover cops dressed as hipsters made 20 drug buys, purchasing $10 envelopes of heroin stamped with brand names such as &quot;Fed Ex,&quot; &quot;KFC,&quot; &quot;Powerful Impact,&quot; &quot;Magik&quot; and &quot;Crossbones.&quot; </p>

<p>Police began the investigation four months ago after locals complained about the crew selling crack and dope openly in the neighborhood. &quot;If you look at the neighborhood, there are a lot of drugs. You don&apos;t want your kids to walk around a neighborhood with drugs,&quot; said Jose Inez, manager of Chela Grocery on Kingsland Avenue, who said he would close the store from 7 a.m. to 11 a.m. because &quot;it was serving as a sanctuary for drug dealers.&quot;</p>
