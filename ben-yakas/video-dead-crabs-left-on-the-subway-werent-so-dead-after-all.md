<p>This weekend, a straphanger came upon <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171101224114/http://gothamist.com/2016/07/03/photos_did_anyone_forget_their_dead.php">an empty train car filled with dead crabs</a>. Ever since, we&apos;ve been trying to piece together the <em>whats</em>, <em>whys</em>, and <em>for reals?</em> of how an N train car ended up filled with 50 or more crabs Saturday night. While there&apos;s still no explanation for why they ended up there, we have at least peeled back the onion a bit on a few aspects of the strange sighting&#x2014;like the fact that crabs were <em>still alive</em> when they were first dumped there.</p>

<p>Park Slope resident Brian Slepian, 24, got on the arthropods express around 10:45 p.m. at 45th Street when he came upon the crabs, and he was able to shed some light on why there was so much water on the ground: &quot;The guy throwing the water told me it must have been a prank against him since he was a Cancer and that it must have been done by a Scorpio (he did not know that I was a Scorpio). As if that train ride could have been any weirder.&quot; </p>

<p>And as you can see in the video below, they were still alive at that point in the evening. &quot;He came on the train after I did and, in a psychotic attempt to help the crabs, threw a liter of water onto the floor,&quot; he added.</p>

<p>Astoria resident Shawn Petcaugh, 24, told us he was waiting for a train at Queensboro Plaza around midnight while on his way home from the Mets game when he came upon the otherwise empty crab car. &quot;We all figured it was a horrid smell,&quot; he said, &quot;but when we started walking past the car to get to the next one, we looked in and spotted an extremely odd sight... about 50 dead crabs. How? Why?&quot;</p>

<p>Based on the photos we have, the crabs appear to be either spider crabs (which are generally considering inedible, but seem to be a popular species for aquariums) or mitten crabs (which are edible, and can be bought in Chinatown). Or maybe this was just viral marketing for this kid&apos;s one-man crab show. </p>

<p>We&apos;ve contacted the MTA for any other info about the crabs, and what people should do in the future if they come across a crustacean-filled subway car. If you have any other information about the mysterious crab train, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171101224114/mailto:tips@gothamist.com">email us</a> ASAP. </p>
