<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408142403/http://gothamist.com/tags/barneys">Barneys New York</a> has been widely condemned in recent weeks after at least two customers came forward to sue the retailer for unjustly accusing them of thievery. Jay Z <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408142403/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/27/jay_z_says_barneys_controversy_amou.php">has also come under fire</a> for not withdrawing from his business relationship with the company. But as Jon Stewart and Larry Wilmore explained on The Daily Show last night, this is actually a moment to celebrate: &quot;White people have been watching their musical icons sell out to corporations for decades. It&apos;s the American dream and we&apos;re finally achieving it. You go Jay Z Penny!&quot;</p>

<p>It may be okay that Jay Z has embraced being a middle aged sell-out, but Barneys insiders and workers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408142403/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/07/barneys-racist_n_4225710.html">tell the Huffington Post</a> that racist culture in ingrained at Barneys. &#x201C;If you&#x2019;re black and come in with an entourage, you won&#x2019;t be followed because they&#x2019;ll be like &#x2018;Oh, that&#x2019;s somebody famous,&#x2019;&quot; the employee told them. &quot;But if you come in by yourself or with one other person, then you&#x2019;re going to be followed.&#x201D;</p>

<p>For their part, Barneys CEO Mark Lee publicly apologized last week to the two African-American customers who claim they were profiled in the store, while at the same time <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408142403/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/30/barneys_blames_the_nypd_for_racial.php">insisting that this was all the NYPD&apos;s fault.</a></p>
