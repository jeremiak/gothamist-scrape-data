While details around how she died remain vague, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130515063539/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/subway_angel_helped_in_vain_jzxe4dQXiPr4HlYmg9l3VO">the NY Post talked to a good Samaritan</a> who may have been the last person to see Singleton alive: &quot;I tried to help her, and then when she ran...I just wanted to think it wasn&#x2019;t her when they told me [she was dead],&quot; 28-year-old Allison Keller said. &quot;I just moved here from Ohio. She was my age, she was young. I was just trying to help. It&#x2019;s just too much.&quot;</p>

<p>Singleton, who was living on Berkeley Place in Park Slope while taking acting classes and working at a clothing store, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130515063539/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/08/woman_found_dead_at_canal_st_statio.php">had been seen</a> at McKenna&apos;s, a West 14th Street bar, before taking the 1 train at the nearby 1/2/3 station at 1:30 a.m. early Sunday. Keller said she first saw her alone on a bench at that station, and helped her collect her things when her pocketbook contents spilled out. </p>

<p>Although the owner of McKenna&apos;s said Singleton was &quot;not drunk or stumbling or anything&quot; when she left his bar, Singleton reportedly wobbled on the train, &quot;leaning on the car&#x2019;s doors and falling to the floor at one point and touching another rider&#x2019;s purse,&quot; law-enforcement sources said. When the train pulled into the Canal Street station, &#x201C;the good Samaritan tried to urge [Singleton] to stay on the train,&#x2019;&#x2019; Police Commissioner Ray Kelly noted. &#x201C;But she got out.&#x201D;</p>

<p>As of now, police believe Singleton drunkenly fell onto the tracks and struck her head; the MTA <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130515063539/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/09/nyregion/body-on-subway-tracks-unnoticed-for-hours.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;_r=0">told the Times</a> that &quot;a dozen trains, perhaps more, may have passed over the spot at the northern end of the station&quot; where Singleton was. </p>

<p>It seems Singleton also left her purse with her cell phone on the train, which Keller picked up. Singleton had been texting with friend Patrick Cheng. He had called her phone at 3:44 a.m. when he didn&apos;t hear from her, and Keller picked up. The two later exchanged Singleton&apos;s belongings; he gave them to Singleton&#x2019;s brother on Monday.<br>
