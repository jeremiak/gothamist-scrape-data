<p>Before we saw this video, we hadn&apos;t even <em>heard</em> of a kinkajou before&#x2014;but after watching Butch scarf down a banana at his home in the Bronx Zoo, we decided to find out whatever we could about the creatures, who are known as &quot;honey bears&quot; (despite having nothing to do with bears). But first, chow time:</p>

<p>Kinkajous are related to raccoons, but really, they look like a cross between a sloth and a monkey. They&apos;re native to Central America and South America (they like hanging out in the rainforest, but who wouldn&apos;t!); they&apos;re typically nocturnal animals, so people rarely get to see them in the wild. But you may have seen one <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424155418/http://today.ccopinion.com/paris-hilton-throws-away-her-kinkajous/">on Paris Hilton&apos;s head before</a>&#x2014;she has a pet kinkajou who once <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424155418/http://gawker.com/193726/paris-hiltons-kinkajou-finally-snaps">bit the shit out of her</a>, but they&apos;re <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424155418/http://jezebel.com/5886122/the-night-belongs-to-paris-hiltons-kinkajou">cool now.</a></p>

<p>As for Butch, video uploader Allison tells us that her friend Aubrey is a zookeeper in the Educational Department at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424155418/http://www.bronxzoo.com/animals-and-exhibits/animals.aspx">Bronx Zoo</a>, and he is used for educational and classroom purposes only. &quot;I was visiting her at the zoo for the day, which is why I got to meet him and pet him,&quot; she said. &quot;He was very cute and soft and friendly!&quot; And he loves fruit and being petted apparently. Just uh, don&apos;t make <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424155418/http://video.foxnews.com/v/4504577/kinkajou-attacks-gretchen-carlson/">any sudden movements.</a></p>
