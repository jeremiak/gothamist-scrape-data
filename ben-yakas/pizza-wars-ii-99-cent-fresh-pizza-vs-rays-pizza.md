<p>Coke vs. Pepsi. Ali vs. Frazier. Yankees vs. Red Sox. And now, 99 Cent Fresh Pizza vs. Ray&apos;s Pizza. The two neighboring midtown <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623150811/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/13/what_food_best_represents_ny.php">pizza</a> places have been engaged in an italian ice-cold war which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623150811/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2011/01/16/2011-01-16_feuding_pizza_guys_cry_pie_in_the_face.html">escalated recently</a> when Ray&apos;s slashed the price of a slice from $2.75 to just 75 cents. </p>

<p>Ray&apos;s workers deny any grudge, but 99 Cent manager Imran Ahmed thinks this is a calculated attack: &quot;They&apos;re trying to fight with us almost, showing attitude. It&apos;s kinda stupid. They were trying to block our customers, screaming, &apos;Don&apos;t go there!&apos; Ray&apos;s also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623150811/http://midtownlunch.com/">introduced</a> a 99 cent menu featuring burgers, pasta, and more, further enraging Ahmed: &quot;We were here first, so who&apos;s making war? Not us! I never put somebody over there to bother them. The flyer guy goes everywhere.&quot; This is certainly the most heated pizza war since the classic <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623150811/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/10/pizza_wars_the_case_of_joes_pizza_v.php">Joe&apos;s Pizza vs. Joe&apos;s Pizza</a> war of last week.</p>
