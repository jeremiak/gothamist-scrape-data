<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141023015424/http://gothamist.com/tags/breakingbad"><em>Breaking Bad</em></a> ended in September after 62 episodes filled with exploding turtles, pink teddy bears, toilet epiphanies, and meth-making montages. And it had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141023015424/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/30/breaking_bad_series_finale_recap.php">a hell of an ending</a>&#x2014;but as we know, Vince Gilligan and his team contemplated many possible endings for the show. The alternate ending you can watch below was not one they truly considered. But that doesn&apos;t mean it isn&apos;t awesome.</p>

<p>SPOILERS ahoy: one of the most <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141023015424/http://www.hitfix.com/comedy/8-insane-breaking-bad-theories-that-should-be-laughed-off-the-internet">popular</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141023015424/http://www.uproxx.com/tv/2012/08/insane-breaking-bad-theory-backed-by-questionable-evidence-so-good-it-might-be-true/">wacky</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141023015424/http://www.buzzfeed.com/daves4/proof-that-breaking-bad-is-totally-a-spin-off-of">internet theories</a> around the show was that <em>Breaking Bad</em> would end with Walt going into witness protection and starting a new life as Hal, his character from <em>Malcolm In The Middle.</em> There were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141023015424/http://www.reddit.com/r/breakinginthemiddle">entire subreddits devoted to this concept</a>. Bryan Cranston even got in on the joke, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141023015424/http://insidetv.ew.com/2013/07/30/breaking-bad-ending-bryan-cranston/">saying at one point</a>, &#x201C;That may not be as far fetched as you imagine.&quot;  </p>

<p>So lo and behold, the crew got Jane Kaczmarek to help the show channel <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141023015424/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwYw2i2icNg">the dream ending of <em>Newhart</em></a> for a DVD extra for the final season. A hysterical Hal recounts his meth empire nightmare to a typically unimpressed Lois&#x2014;and it&apos;s worth it just to hear him say Jesse &quot;always looked like he was wearing his older brother&#x2019;s clothes.&quot;</p>
