<p><em>The Deuce</em>, the latest show from <em>The Wire</em> veterans David Simon and George Pelecanos, is a sprawling look at the porn industry in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170717034034/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/27/photos_of_times_square_in_the_1970s.php#photo-3">Times Square in the 1970s</a>, starring James Franco as twin brothers and Maggie Gyllenhaal as an entrepreneurial sex worker. The show, which includes several <em>Wire</em> alums (Anwar Glover, Chris Bauer, Larry Gilliard Jr., Gbenga Akinnagbe) and director Michelle MacLaren, won&apos;t be released on HBO until the fall (September 10th!), but you can get a very early viewing of the pilot this weekend at the inaugural Split Screens Festival, a celebration of our current age of peak television.</p>
