It&apos;s an existential question now facing fans of the famed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160719165556/http://gothamist.com/2010/01/08/coney_islands_new_boardwalk_already.php">Coney Island Boardwalk</a>&#x2014;the city has begun replacing the classic wood planks on the Riegelmann Boardwalk with large concrete slabs from Ocean Parkway to Brighton First Road. <p></p>

<p>And though administration officials are gung-ho about the durability of the concrete, they admit that things won&apos;t quite be the same: &#x201C;It&#x2019;s not going to look like wood at all,&#x201D; Martin Maher, chief of staff of Brooklyn Parks, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160719165556/http://www.brooklynpaper.com/stories/33/17/bn_coneyboardwalkfences_2010_4_22_bk.html">told</a> Brooklyn Paper. Residents are already grumbling about the change: &#x201C;Not only is it going to be ugly, it&#x2019;s going to be unbearably hot...<strong>People are not going to be able to walk barefoot over that. They&#x2019;re going to burn their feet.&#x201D;</strong> said Brighton Beach resident Ida Sanoff.</p>

<p>In the meantime, as you consider the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160719165556/http://rillawafers.tumblr.com/post/254176331/do-you-respect-wood-via-niki">disrespect</a> being given to wood, you can revisit the boardwalk in scenes from classic movies such as <em>Uptown Girls</em>, <em>Two Weeks Notice</em> and Steven Seagal&apos;s <em>Out For Justice</em>.</p>
