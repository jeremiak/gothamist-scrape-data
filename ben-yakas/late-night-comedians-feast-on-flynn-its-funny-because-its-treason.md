<p>With Michael Flynn resigning from his post as National Security Adviser after just 24 days, followed by reports that Trump&apos;s team had been in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170429114744/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/14/us/politics/russia-intelligence-communications-trump.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=span-ab-top-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news">direct contact with Russia</a> before the election, the late night comedians had plenty of fun piling onto the wildly dysfunctional administration last night. &quot;I use disposable razors longer than that,&quot; Seth Meyers said of Flynn&apos;s tenure. &quot;It didn&apos;t even last as long as a David Blaine stunt.&quot; </p>

<p>Watch below as Meyers covers the scandal, and tries to parse the question of what the president knew and when he knew it, especially after he denied knowing anything when asked by reporters on Air Force One on Feb. 10th, one day after a damning Washington Post article on Flynn&apos;s Russian ties: &quot;Trump sounds like a guy who&#x2019;s being told there&#x2019;s a nude scene in a movie he&#x2019;s definitely already watched,&quot; Meyers said before diving into his Trump impersonation: &quot;Oh, is there? Huh? Well, maybe I&#x2019;ll check that out. For the first time.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;[Flynn] resigned last night,&quot; Stephen Colbert said to start his show last night, &quot;not because of a scandal, he just wanted to spend more time with his Russian contacts.&quot; Besides coming up with the perfect moniker for Sean Spicer (&quot;He is the MC Escher of bullshit&quot;), Colbert got the single best line of the night about the Flynn situation after making a joke about Flynn reading transcripts of his conversations with the Russian ambassador: &quot;It&#x2019;s funny because it&#x2019;s treason.&quot;</p>

<p>Over at The Daily Show, Trevor Noah was gleeful over the resignation, and gave all credit to Trump for his ingenious plan: &quot;Donald Trump&apos;s finally draining the swamp of the people he brought to the swamp,&#x201D; he said. &quot;President Trump is a genius, people. He hires a cabinet full of terrible people, fires them one-by-one, looks like he&#x2019;s a man of action. Drain the swamp, down to the previous levels!&quot; </p>

<p>And finally, Jake Tapper was a guest on Conan, telling him he thinks this story will have serious legs and ramifications for Trump: &quot;President Trump was asked about it on Friday and he said, &apos;Oh I hadn&apos;t seen that report, I don&apos;t know what you&apos;re talking about, I&apos;ll look into it,&apos; when obviously he&apos;s known about it,&quot; Tapper explained. &quot;So, usually we get into the &apos;what did the president know and when did he know it&apos; two years into the second term of a president, not four weeks. But, you know, he&apos;s doing things differently.&quot;</p>
