<p>If you were forced to pick between shelter and a furry companion, which would you choose? According <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110512233806/http://www.nydailynews.com/lifestyle/pets/2010/11/20/2010-11-20_dog_sweet_dog.html">to the News</a> today, more and more homeless people are choosing their pets over warmth and a roof. And by more and more, they mean one very sad homeless man they found with a dog. Because he&apos;s the only example they use to prove their theory. Patrick Markee, of the Coalition for the Homeless, admits that it&apos;s hard for people to separate from their pets, but the majority of homeless people are much more interested in survival: &quot;<strong>They don&apos;t think having a pet to care for is a very good survival strategy. </strong>The majority, in order to get shelter or housing have to give the pets up, at least for some period of time and that&apos;s a very hard thing to do.&quot;</p>
