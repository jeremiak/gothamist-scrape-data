<p>Nirvana, The Replacements, KISS, Hall &amp; Oates, and many more artists and bands <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150103062821/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/nirvana-kiss-hall-and-oates-nominated-for-rock-and-roll-hall-of-fame-20131016">have been nominated</a> for the 2014 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150103062821/http://gothamist.com/tags/rockandrollhalloffame">Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.</a> Or in the eternal words of Rush&apos;s Alex Lifeson, The Rock and Roll Hall of &quot;blah blah blah, blah blah blah, blah blah, blah? Blah blah blah.&quot;</p>

<p>In case you don&apos;t share Lifeson&apos;s contempt for the awards ceremony, the other artists eligible this year include The Zombies, Linda Ronstadt, Peter Gabriel, Yes, Chic, Deep Purple, N.W.A., the Paul Butterfield Blues Band, the Meters, LL Cool J, Link Wray, and Cat Stevens. It should go without saying, but all those artists (yes, even Deep Purple) have produced amazing music&#x2014;and if it takes being inducted into this hall of fame for people to explore the assorted back catalogue of The Paul Butterfield Blues Band (everyone who likes guitar should own <em>The Adventures of Mike Bloomfield and Al Kooper</em>), then we think that justifies its existence enough.</p>

<p>The 29th annual Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony will be held in April in NYC. You can pretty much be guaranteed that Nirvana will get in, and Dave Grohl will be a gentleman in accepting the award. But if you have a deep personal interest in making sure The Zombies finally get recognized for being one of the greatest bands of the 1960s, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150103062821/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/vote-for-the-2014-rock-and-roll-hall-of-fame-inductees-20131016">fans can vote here for inductees.</a></p>
