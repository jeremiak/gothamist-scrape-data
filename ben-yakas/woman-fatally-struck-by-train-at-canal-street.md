<p>A woman was fatally struck by a train in Manhattan today. According to FDNY, the female victim, believed to be in her 30s, was found on the southbound 1 train tracks at Canal Street just after 1 p.m. &#x201C;We don&apos;t know how she got there,&#x201D; a police source <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507073656/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/woman-fatally-struck-1-subway-train-article-1.1310106">told the News</a>. &#x201C;It looks like she was clubbing&#x2014;leather pants and heels.&#x201D;</p>

<p>The News adds that investigators are still trying to figure out when she was struck by the train; it&apos;s possible she may have been hit hours before her body was discovered. </p>

<p>This was the fifth <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507073656/http://gothamist.com/tags/subway">subway-related incident</a> in the past four days: a 58-year-old man <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507073656/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/06/man_fatally_struck_by_d_train_on_up.php">was fatally struck by a D train</a> at West 72nd Street on Saturday morning while retrieving something from the tracks.</p>

<p>A man was fatally struck by a northbound E train at 7th Avenue and 53rd Street in Manhattan around 7:45 p.m. Thursday night. FDNY said that he apparently jumped in front of the train, and died at the scene. A 56-year-old person was struck by a train around 1:30 a.m. Friday at Fulton Street and Ralph Avenue; that person was taken to Kings County Hospital, but his or her condition is not known.</p>

<p>And on Thursday morning, a 23-year-old Florida man <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507073656/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/05/cops_believe_florida_tourist_was_fa.php">was fatally struck by a train</a>. Cops believe that Bobby Legrand Guin, who had recently moved to NYC, had dropped a wad of $50 and $20 bills onto the tracks and had jumped down to retrieve them when he was struck by a northbound local A train.</p>
