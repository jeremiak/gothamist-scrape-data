<p>Seth Meyers returned from winter break last night and dived right back into Donald Trump&apos;s morass. And so far in the new year, Trump has pretty much stayed the course in regards to his predilection for tweeting about inane things: &quot;Trump has continued his habit of tweeting obsessively about some of the least important things you could possibly imagine, like the ratings for the all-new <em>Celebrity Apprentice</em>,&quot; Meyers said. </p>

<p>Meyers talks about how Trump&apos;s focus on being &quot;the Ernest Hemingway of Twitter&quot; (Note: &quot;if Ernest Hemingway heard you say that, he would kill himself again&quot;) has pushed important topics like Russian interference in the election and the lack of vetting his cabinet picks into the background. But like a monkey at the state fair, he is VERY good at typing! </p>

<p>Meyers also had Van Jones on to discuss former Obama voters he encountered who had turned to Trump during this election.</p>
