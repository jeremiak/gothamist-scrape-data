<p>We&apos;re just a few days away from the premiere of the third season of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170415171707/http://gothamist.com/tags/bettercallsaul"><em>Better Call Saul</em></a>, the story of how Jimmy McGill transformed into Saul Goodman (and then into Cinnabon Gene). To celebrate that and the return of <em>Breaking Bad</em> villain Gus Fring, AMC and Icon Parking have teamed up <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170415171707/http://gothamist.com/2017/03/29/los_pollos_hermanos_pop-up.php">to launch a Los Pollos Hermanos pop-up</a> in the Financial District this weekend. And here&apos;s your first glimpse of it!</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="040717los2.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170415171707im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/040717los2.jpg" width="640" height="480"> <br> <i> Daniel Boyar </i></div> <p></p>

<p>Fring&apos;s faux-restaurant will be open on Sunday, April 9th, from 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. and Monday, April 10th, from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. at an Icon Parking location at 243 Pearl Street (<em>Saul</em> premieres that same Monday night). You&apos;ll be able to try some of Fring&#x2019;s &quot;famous curly fries,&quot; and star Michael McKean (who plays Jimmy&apos;s mentally ill but brilliant brother, Chuck McGill) will be there at 3:15 p.m. on Monday to meet fans.</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="040717los4.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170415171707im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/040717los4.jpg" width="640" height="865" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>In season two, <em>Saul</em> was funnier (Hoboken Squat Cobbler!), more comfortable with its <em>Breaking Bad</em> roots (Mike&apos;s one man war against the Salamancas), and more tragic (everything involving Chuck and Jimmy&apos;s long-simmering family feud), and we expect it to only continue its ascent in season three&#x2014;which is why it&apos;s one of our <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170415171707/http://laist.com/2017/03/21/spring_2017_tv_guide.php">most anticipated shows</a> of the spring. Check out a promo video featuring Fring and Los Pollos below.</p>
