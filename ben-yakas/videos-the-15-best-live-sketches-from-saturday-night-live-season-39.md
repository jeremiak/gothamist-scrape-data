<p>Yesterday, we highlighted our <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140530030622/http://gothamist.com/2014/05/24/videos_the_20_best_digital_videos_f.php">20 favorite digital shorts</a> from the past season of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140530030622/http://gothamist.com/tags/snl"><em>Saturday Night Live</em></a>. While the show has started to excel with its pre-taped segments, the regular old live sketches could be pretty rough at times during season 39&#x2014;unless you&apos;re the kind that finds the concept of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140530030622/http://gothamist.com/2013/12/15/videos_saturday_night_live_4.php#photo-6">Robert De Niro and Sylvester Stallone on camels tossing stilted one-liners back and forth</a> hilarious.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, there were still several standout sketches this year&#x2014;a mix of the extremely surreal (Romantic Comedy, Halloween Candy) and charming (Baby It&apos;s Cold Outside, French Dance), along with recurring characters (Former Porn Stars, Mornin&apos; Miami) and inspired one-offs (Black Jeopardy, Blue River Dog Food). </p>

<p>Honorable mentions go to: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140530030622/http://gothamist.com/2013/12/08/videos_paul_rudd_gets_snl_assist_fr.php#photo-11">Bill Brasky</a> (Paul Rudd), <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140530030622/http://gothamist.com/2014/02/02/videos_saturday_night_live_6.php#photo-5">Sheila Kelly</a> (Melissa McCarthy), <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140530030622/http://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/video/4th-grade-talent-show/n43352">4th Grade Talent Show</a> (Lady Gaga), <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140530030622/http://gothamist.com/2013/12/15/videos_saturday_night_live_4.php#photo-5">Dance of the Snowflakes</a> (John Goodman), <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140530030622/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/27/videos_saturday_night_live_injects.php#photo-8">Possum Hunters</a> (Edward Norton), Kerry Washington&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140530030622/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/03/videos_saturday_night_live_3.php#photo-2">Cold Open</a>, and (though not technically a sketch) Louis C.K.&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140530030622/http://gothamist.com/2014/03/30/video_louis_ck_saturday_night_live.php#photo-3">stand-up during his monologue.</a></p>
