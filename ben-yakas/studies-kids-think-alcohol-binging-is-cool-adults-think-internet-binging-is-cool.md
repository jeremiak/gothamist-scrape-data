<p>Lately, it seems like all &quot;scientific&quot; studies seem to only be good for two things: learning that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150624120027/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/01/dumb_study_the_beautiful_people_are.php">dumb stuff</a> you already knew was true <em>is</em> true, and learning that good/bad behavior is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150624120027/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/05/study_chocoholism_is_actually_a_dis.php">the opposite</a> of what you expect it to be. Appropriately, two new studies fall into each category quite comfortably: according to a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150624120027/http://www.drugfree.org/newsroom/national-study-confirms-teen-drug-use-trending-in-wrong-direction-marijuana-ecstasy-use-up-since-2008-parents-feel-ill-equipped-to-respond">new report</a> by Drugfree.org, teenagers don&apos;t think binge drinking is a big deal. And according to a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150624120027/http://techland.time.com/2011/04/05/good-news-wasting-time-on-the-internet-makes-you-a-better-worker/">new study</a> by the University of Copenhagen, wasting time browsing the internet might be good for your job!</p>

<p>In the duh category, we have this new study about teenagers. More than 45 percent of teens surveyed didn&apos;t think binge drinking, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150624120027/http://kidshealth.org/teen/drug_alcohol/alcohol/binge_drink.html">defined as</a> having five-or-more drinks at a time on a regular basis, was a big deal. More than 60 percent of teens, always a particularly conscientious group, say their number one reason they imbibe is because &#x201C;it&#x2019;s fun to drink&quot;, if you could believe that. Interestingly, one in three teens said they drank &quot;to forget their troubles,&quot; one in four teens said they used alcohol to help &quot;deal with problems at home,&quot; and one in five teens said they drank to &#x201C;deal with the pressures and stress of school&quot;&#x2014;all of which suggest that major problems which are not being dealt with at home are what is spurring them toward drinking and experimenting more than ever.</p>

<p>Of course, this is not a huge surprise in NYC, where the majority of the population are excessive drinkers anyway, according <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150624120027/http://gothamist.com/2010/11/15/report_new_yorkers_binge_drinking_t.php">to a study</a> last winter. But let us also not forget a study <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150624120027/http://gothamist.com/2010/08/30/new_study_drinkers_live_longer_than.php">from last summer</a> which told us that drinkers outlive nondrinkers! The Drugfree.org study also found a 67 percent increase in the number of teens who reported using Ecstasy in the past year, and a 22 percent increase in the amount who have tried marijuana.</p>

<p>As for adults, it&apos;s pretty clear that the internet is their alcohol, marijuana and ecstasy all rolled into one. But this may not be so bad after all&#x2014;the University of Copenhagen&apos;s study <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150624120027/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-1374024/Wasting-time-internet-work-makes-focused-employee.html">compared</a> the work efficiency of people who watched a funny internet video before performing a task with a group who did not watch a video...and they found that the internet junkies were more productive at their tasks after enjoying themselves a little. </p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150624120027/http://www.newyorker.com/talk/financial/2011/04/11/110411ta_talk_surowiecki">New Yorker suggests</a> from this that companies should give their employees &quot;Internet breaks,&quot; during which they&apos;re free to do whatever they like, something which Google <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150624120027/http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=4839327&amp;page=1">already does</a>. If you&apos;re really lucky, you can end up working for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150624120027/http://gothamist.com/">a place</a> that pays you to browse the internet <em>all day.</em></p>
