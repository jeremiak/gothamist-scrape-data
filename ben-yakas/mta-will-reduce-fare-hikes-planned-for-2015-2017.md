<p>After a big <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510022158/http://gothamist.com/tags/farehike">fare hike</a> earlier this year, the MTA determined there would be two more sizable fare hikes <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510022158/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/24/more_fare_hikes_on_the_way.php">in 2015 and 2017</a>. However, it was announced in September that the MTA <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510022158/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/29/fare_hike.php">will have a $1.9 billion budget surplus</a> over the next four years. Although the MTA was wary of giving hope to commuters then, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510022158/http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2013/11/13/future-mta-fare-increases-may-not-be-as-high-as-expected/">they announced today that</a> the planned fare hikes will indeed be reduced significantly.</p>

<p>Instead of 7.5 percent increases in 2015 and 2017, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510022158/http://nypost.com/2013/11/13/mta-slashing-2015-2017-fare-hikes/">fare hikes will now be</a> 4 percent each year; this is expected to save riders and drivers a total $905 million between 2015 and 2017. MTA Chief Financial Officer Bob Foran said the agency&apos;s projected bottom line had improved by $791 million since July, when it released its budget for 2014-2017. &#x201C;The expenses we&#x2019;re facing in 2014 are one billion dollars less than what we thought we would be spending in 2010,&#x201D; Foran told the MTA board. </p>

<p>Nevertheless, even with a surplus, the anticipated revenue loss from such cuts would have to be fortified by $500 million in &#x201C;aggressive&#x201D; cost-cutting, with $50 million less spending in 2013, followed by another $150 million in 2015 and $300 million in 2016. How they&apos;ll achieve that is unclear, although they noted that paramount will be striking a deal with Transport Workers Union Local 100 with no increase in compensation for workers&#x2014;something the TWU won&apos;t be happy about, considering they want raises to recognize their efforts putting the transit system back together post-Sandy.</p>
