<p>Last week, an offer was made that many couldn&apos;t afford not to refuse when the &#x201C;The Godfather&#x201D; house on Staten Island was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150621161306/http://gothamist.com/2010/12/02/godfather_mansion_for_sale.php">put on the market</a> for $2.9 million. But a conspiracy may be afoot: the real estate broker <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150621161306/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/staten_island/godmother_of_real_estate_rgmkj9KRuPi4gILwSpiTrI?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">who is selling</a> the site of the Corleone mansion is the daughter-in-law of the real-life Godfather who was an inspiration for Don Corleone&#x2019;s character. Connie Profaci is married to the son of &#x201C;olive-oil king&#x201D; Joe Profaci, the founder of one of New York&#x2019;s five crime families (the Colombos), who was once described as &#x201C;the nation&#x2019;s No. 1 racketeer.&#x201D; Even though the Profaci family has since gone legit, we are superstitious men, and know there are no such thing as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150621161306/http://gothamist.com/2010/11/10/the_simpsons_predicted_911_accordin.php">coincidences</a>; could Luca Brasi have paid someone a visit?</p>
