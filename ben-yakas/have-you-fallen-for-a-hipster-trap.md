<p>Have you spotted a &quot;Hipster Trap&quot; in your neighborhood? Reddit user gigaface <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161018020321/http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/g3c8h/just_met_this_guy_setting_up_hipster_traps_in_nyc/">writes</a>, &quot;Just met this guy setting up &apos;hipster traps&apos; in NYC, baited with PBR and American Spirits. Awesome work.&quot; But where&apos;s the Four Loko and belt buckle <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161018020321/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/22/ultimate_hipster_brooklyn_blacksmit.php">MetroCard holders</a>? Pshaw, this would never fool a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161018020321/http://dustinland.com/archives/archives464.html">Kyp Malone-level</a> hipster.</p>

If you do come across one of these tantalizing traps, don&apos;t be afraid: they&apos;re only made of cardboard. (<em>Or are they?</em>)</p>
