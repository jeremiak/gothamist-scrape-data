<p>&quot;We are only one menstrual cycle into this presidency and there is blood in the water,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170925130610/http://gothamist.com/tags/samanthabee">Samantha Bee</a> said at the top of <em>Full Frontal</em> last night. As has become routine over the first weeks of Trump&apos;s presidency, she had plenty of new material on the administration to cover. But she started the episode by pivoting from Trump to the dirty machinations of the GOP-controlled Congress: &quot;While we were all staring directly at the eclipse of national security and Democratic norms, we&apos;ve been blind to something else&#x2014;namely, a Republican Congress going hog wild, like Amish twins on Rumspringa.&quot; </p>

<p>Watch as she dives into how Republicans are steamrolling Democrats using the obscure Congressional Review Act: &quot;When the current Congress discovered this fun toy, they were as excited as a puppy discovering a dildo&#x2014;and just as destructive.&quot;</p>

<p>Bee then moved on to &quot;faithful husky&quot; Paul Ryan, who has learned that Trump values loyalty above all else and has used that to his advantage. She tears apart the morally-bankrupt Speaker of the House for his contradicting views, and ultimately compares him to Taylor Swift: &quot;Watching Ryan play moral watchdog was like watching Taylor Swift pretend to be surprised at an awards show&#x2014;bland and fake, but weirdly compelling,&#x201D; she said, before comparing Trump to Tom Hiddleston. &quot;Take another cue from Taylor Swift, Mr. Speaker: know when to dump the guy you&#x2019;ve only been pretending to like to help your career. It&#x2019;s kind of hurting your &apos;moral compass of the party&apos; brand.&quot;</p>
