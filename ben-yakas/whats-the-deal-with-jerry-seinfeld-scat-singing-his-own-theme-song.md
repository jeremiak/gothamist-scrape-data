<p><em>Comedians In Cars Getting Coffee</em> kicked off its fourth season of fancy cars, fancy espressos, and the slovenly comedians who love them <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425173028/http://comediansincarsgettingcoffee.com/sarah-jessica-parker-a-little-hyper-aware">with Sarah Jessica Parker today</a>. But the most notable thing about the return of the web series is the fact that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425173028/http://gothamist.com/tags/jerryseinfeld">Jerry Seinfeld</a>, while on a possible break from reality and/or a really nice Purple Kush high, decided to write and sing lyrics to the theme song of the show. Couldn&apos;t he at least have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425173028/http://pitchfork.com/news/55055-vampire-weekends-ezra-koenig-sings-seinfeld-theme-for-bizarre-seinfeld2000-video-game/">gotten Ezra Koenig to sing it</a>? Listen below.</p>

<p>Even the sweet dulcet tones of the man who once sang, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425173028/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_i1xk07o4g">&quot;Lil&apos; Jon, he always tells the truth,&quot;</a> couldn&apos;t possibly do anything to improve upon Seinfeld&apos;s theme. One man&apos;s breakdown is another man&apos;s flawless, and this is Seinfeld&apos;s masterpiece <em>[Note: exclamation marks have been placed to the best of our interpretive ability]</em>:</p>

<blockquote>I think it&apos;s time for that silly show!
We&apos;re comedians and there cars go!
They talk and laugh with coffee beans!
And drink and stir and wear blue jeans!
So I&apos;ll get in that car!
No need to go far!
Sometimes on stage I won&apos;t come off-ee!
Unless I&apos;m getting in a car!
For coffee!</blockquote>

<p>We could point out that cars neither talk nor laugh, or that Seinfeld has never been on stage in an episode of the show, or that &quot;off-ee&quot; isn&apos;t a word, or that he, ya know, can&apos;t sing. But we won&apos;t, because everyone goes through a mid-life crisis, but not everyone has a web series upon which they can have it play out in public. And shit, this is still better than <em>Bee Movie</em></p>

<p>However, this is only the second best Seinfeld-related theme song. This is the best:</p>
