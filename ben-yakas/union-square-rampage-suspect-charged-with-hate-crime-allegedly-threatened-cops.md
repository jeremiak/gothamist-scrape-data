<p>The homeless man who was arrested in Union Square last month after allegedly attacking three people in broad daylight&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131128044355/http://gothamist.com/tags/jeffreybabbitt">and fatally striking one</a>&#x2014;has now had his charges upgraded to hate crimes. Suspect Martin Redrick, a.k.a. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131128044355/http://gothamist.com/tags/leshawnmarten">Lashawn Marten</a>, has been charged with manslaughter in the first- and second-degrees, assault, and attempted assault <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131128044355/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/suspect-union-sq-beating-charged-hate-crime-article-1.1479750">all as hate crimes</a>, in the death of 62-year-old Jeffery Babbitt. He faces 25 years to life on the top count.</p>

<p>In court this week, it also came out that Redrick allegedly threatened cops as he was being arrested on September 4th: &quot;Next white guy in uniform is going to be next. You&apos;re next too. It is a bulls**t assault three. I&apos;ll be out in thirty days,&quot; he allegedly said. &quot;He said something about my momma and I punched him &#x2026;You spelled my name wrong.&quot;</p>

<p>Redrick, who has a history of mental illness (including schizophrenia), was hanging out by the chess tables in the park last month when he became angry, possibly because no one wanted to play him; sources told us he jumped up and shouted, &quot;I hate white people,&quot; then struck Babbitt. &quot;He said &apos;The next white person who walks by, I&apos;m going to [expletive],&apos;&quot; one female witness <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131128044355/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2013/10/08/suspect-charged-with-hate-crime-for-allegedly-throwing-fatal-union-square-punch/">told WCBS.</a></p>

<p>Redrick&apos;s family previously said that he has had a complicated relationship with race. &#x201C;Martin did not like authority and as we were growing up, the only people with authority were white people,&#x201D; his brother Joseph Redrick told them. &#x201C;A lot of times that problem with authority was transferred to white people.&#x201D;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131128044355/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/13/union_square_rampage_suspect_claims.php">In a jailhouse interview</a>, Redrick maintained that there was no racial component to the incident: &#x201C;I&#x2019;ve punched white people. I&#x2019;ve punched brown people. I&#x2019;ve punched Hispanic people. So what? I don&#x2019;t target anyone.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Redrick will undergo a psychiatric fitness exam to determine if he&apos;s fit to stand trial.</p>
