<p>A car flipped over on the Upper West Side this morning. A witness told us that it happened West 79th Street between Amsterdam and Columbus Avenues just before 10:30 a.m. today. Another witness <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130328011932/https://twitter.com/BrendaTNYC/status/304975507819204608">tweeted</a>, &quot;Spotted: A car flipped over on 79th St. Flipped over! How fast do you have to be going for that to happen?&quot;</p>

<p>According to FDNY, two people had minor injuries due to the overturned car; one refused medical treatment, and the other was transported to Cornell Hospital. The NYPD press office has no information about the accident yet but we&apos;ll update as we learn more.<br>
 <br>
<strong>Update</strong>: Alex Etling told us he walking by right after the incident happened: &quot;<strong>My friend who saw it happen said that a car was pulling out from a parking spot on the north side (I believe) of 79th when the white car hit it.</strong> He said it was surprising that the car flipped because it wasn&apos;t going excessively fast.&quot;</p>
