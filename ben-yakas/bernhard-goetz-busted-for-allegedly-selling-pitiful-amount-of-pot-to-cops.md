<p>Rudy Giuliani <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504132747/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/01/giuliani_de_blasio_will_totally_bri.php">tried to warn us</a> that the Bad Old Days&#x2122; were coming back, but we didn&apos;t expect them to come back quite so quickly (or pitifully). Notorious &quot;subway vigilante&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504132747/http://gothamist.com/tags/bernhardgoetz">Bernhard Goetz</a>, whose name is practicaly synonymous with those Bad Old Days&#x2122;, was busted allegedly selling a very small amount of pot to undercover cops this week. &#x201C;He told her he wanted to get high with her and sold her a small amount of pot in a &#xAD;tissue,&#x201D; a source <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504132747/http://nypost.com/2013/11/01/infamous-subway-vigilante-busted-selling-weed-to-cops/">told the Post.</a></p>

<p>Cops say that Goetz, 65 (he turns 66 next Thursday), met the undercover female officer at 15th Street and Fifth Avenue near his Union Square apartment around 5:45 p.m. on Friday. After chatting for a bit, the two walked back to Goetz&apos;s apartment to get $30 worth of weed to allegedly sell to her. Goetz has been charged with criminal sale of marijuana. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504132747/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/subway-vigilante-bernie-goetz-arrested-peddling-pot-article-1.1504621">Cops added that</a> they weren&apos;t specifically targeting Goetz.</p>

<p>Goetz <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504132747/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/22/flashback_high_schoolers_weigh_in_o.php">sparked a national conversation</a> about vigilante justice after he shot four black teens on the subway in 1984 whom he claimed were trying to rob him. His neighbors sounded protective of him: &#x201C;Bernie? Oh, come on, they arrested him for that? It&#x2019;s just pot, they should let him go,&#x201D; doorman John D&#x2019;Antonia, who works in a building near Goetz&#x2019;s, told the Post. &#x201C;People will now probably say he shot those kids because he was high.&#x201D;</p>

<p>If you&apos;re wondering what else Goetz has been up to in recent years, here he is playing with his pet squirrel, because of course he couldn&apos;t own a normal pet:</p>
