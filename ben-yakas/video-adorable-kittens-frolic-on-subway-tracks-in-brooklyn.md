<p>There was almost a major subway CAT-ASTROPHE today when a pair of adorable kittens were spotted running wild on the train tracks in Brooklyn. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429191802/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Kittens-Subway-Tracks-Brooklyn-MTA-Delays-Shut-Down--221662261.html?_osource=SocialFlowTwt_NYBrand">According to NBC</a>, subway service was briefly shut down after the kitties were seen running up and down the tracks near the third rail at the B/Q Church Avenue station in Prospect Lefferts Gardens. It took workers over an hour to corral them because of their friskiness: &quot;The man&apos;s like, &apos;Come here kittens...&apos; and like, he&apos;s scaring the cat so they&apos;re not going to come out,&quot; said witness Kilina Roberts.</p>

<p>The B and Q were suspended for about an hour around lunchtime today while the kitten crisis was handled. Eventually, they were safely placed into carrying cases; officials aren&apos;t sure whether they were strays or belonged to anyone. Here, take a clearer look at one of them, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429191802/http://twitpic.com/daxsjr">via NYCT Subway Scoop</a>:</p>

<p>This isn&apos;t the first time a kitty <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429191802/http://gothamist.com/2010/01/11/cute_cat_spotted_awfully_close_to_f.php">has been spotted</a> on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429191802/http://gothamist.com/2008/02/17/georgia_the_esc.php">the train tracks</a>&#x2014;but at least the kitties were okay after this incident, and no mime was involved.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: And it turns out the kittens <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429191802/http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2013/08/29/kittens-delay-subway-in-brooklyn/">escaped from their captors</a>! </p>

<p>It seems these kittens have been hanging around the B/Q line all week, as tipster Bex recently saw them at Newkirk Plaza: <strong>&quot;I saw one a few days ago eating a corn on the cob.&quot;</strong></p>
