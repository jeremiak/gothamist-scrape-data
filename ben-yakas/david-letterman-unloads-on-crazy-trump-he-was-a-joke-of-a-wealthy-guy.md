<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170308204451/http://gothamist.com/tags/davidletterman">David Letterman</a> has mostly stayed out of the limelight since retiring from <em>Late Show</em> in 2015 in order to focus all of his energy on growing a magnificent beard. But in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170308204451/http://www.vulture.com/2017/03/david-letterman-in-conversation.html">a long and oft-hilarious cover story</a> for <em>New York Magazine</em> this week, Letterman has lots to say about Donald Trump, who he has known and interviewed for decades&#x2014;namely, that Trump is a crazy jerk, satire is an effective tool because Trump&apos;s so thin-skinned, and all Americans have to take care of themselves with a madman in office.</p>

<p>We highly recommend <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170308204451/http://www.vulture.com/2017/03/david-letterman-in-conversation.html">you read the whole interview</a> when you have a chance, which includes some pretty good repartee between interviewer Stephen Marche and Letterman, but in the meantime, we&apos;ve picked out some of the best quotes.</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Letterman on how he viewed Trump before the election:</strong> &quot;I always regarded him as, if you&#x2019;re going to have New York City, you gotta have a Donald Trump. He was a joke of a wealthy guy. We didn&#x2019;t take him seriously. He&#x2019;d sit down, and I would just start making fun of him. He never had any retort. He was big and doughy, and you could beat him up. He seemed to have a good time, and the audience loved it, and that was Donald Trump. Beyond that, I remember a friend in the PR business told me that he knew for a fact &#x2014; this was three or four presidential campaigns ago &#x2014; that Donald Trump would never run for president; he was just monkeying around for the publicity. So I assumed that was the story and now it turns out he&#x2019;s the president. Now, who owns <em>New York</em>?...Say the head of the family, let&#x2019;s say his name was Larry Wasserstein. If Larry behaved the way Donald behaves, for even a six-week period, the family would get together and say, &#x201C;Jesus, somebody better call the doctor.&#x201D; Then they&#x2019;d ask him to step down. But Trump&#x2019;s the president and he can lie about anything from the time he wakes up to what he has for lunch and he&#x2019;s still the president. I don&#x2019;t get that. I&#x2019;m tired of people being bewildered about everything he says: &#x201C;I can&#x2019;t believe he said that.&#x201D; We gotta stop that and instead figure out ways to protect ourselves from him. We know he&#x2019;s crazy. We gotta take care of ourselves here now.&quot;</li>
	<li><strong>Letterman on the impact of SNL and Alec Baldwin:</strong> &quot;Comedy&#x2019;s one of the ways that we can protect ourselves. Alec Baldwin deserves a Presidential Medal of Freedom. Sadly, he&#x2019;s not going to get it from this president...The man has such thin skin that if you keep pressure on him &#x2014; I remember there was a Actually, it was the other way around. In a 2007 playoff game, a swarm of midges from Lake Erie caused Yankees reliever Joba Chamberlain to blow the game with a few wild pitches. baseball game in Cleveland, and a swarm of flies came on the field and the batters were doing this [mimes swatting at flies] while the pitcher was throwing 100 miles an hour. Well, that&#x2019;s Alec Baldwin and Saturday Night Live. It&#x2019;s distracting the batter. Eventually Trump&#x2019;s going to take a fastball off the sternum and have to leave the game.&quot;</li>
	<li><strong>Letterman on Steve Bannon:</strong> &quot;Donald Trump can be Donald Trump, but if he doesn&#x2019;t help the people that need help, then he&#x2019;s just a jerk. That press conference that he held berating the news media? I mean, how do you build a dictatorship? First, you undermine the press: &#x201C;The only truth you&#x2019;re going to hear is from me.&#x201D; And he hires the Hunchback of Notre Dame, Steve Bannon, to be his little buddy. Bannon looks like a guy who goes to lunch, gets drunk, and comes back to the office: &#x201C;Steve, could you have just one drink?&#x201D; &#x201C;Fuck you.&#x201D; How is a white supremacist the chief adviser to our president? Did anybody look that up? I don&#x2019;t know.&quot;</li>
	<li><strong>Letterman on the rest of Trump&apos;s cabinet and closest advisors:</strong> &quot;Kellyanne Conway was my favorite for a long time. This thing about her telling everyone, &#x201C;Go buy Ivanka&#x2019;s shoes; I&#x2019;m going to go buy Ivanka&#x2019;s shoes. Hell, I&#x2019;ll buy you a pair of Ivanka&#x2019;s shoes.&#x201D; Then they had to counsel her. Boy, if this administration decides you need counseling &#x2014; whoa. And poor Sean Spicer is a boob who just got out of a cab and now here he is. Then the other kid, is it Miller?...Wow, that guy is creepy. He fell out of a truck. And the guy from Exxon, Rex Tillerson. Don would say, &#x201C;Rex, if you&#x2019;re talking to your friends, ask them&#x201D; &#x2014; I&#x2019;m sure the Russians groomed Trump. They gave him tips: &#x201C;You want to be an authoritarian dictator? Sure, that&#x2019;s not a problem. We&#x2019;ll tell you how to do it, for God&#x2019;s sake.&#x201D; I think it was just all like that, because that&#x2019;s the way Trump does business: &#x201C;See if they&#x2019;ll give us the tar coating? They&#x2019;ll throw that in? Great, great. And by the way, we&#x2019;re not paying the last 10 percent of the bill.&#x201D; I think it&#x2019;s the same shit.&quot;</li>
	<li><strong>Letterman on possibility of Trump being blackmailed by Russia:</strong> &quot;Well, yes. I was blackmailed. But in baseball you have the major leagues and then you have your instructional leagues. My situation would have been down in the instructional leagues, and I was dumb enough to put myself in a position where I was vulnerable. If what they&#x2019;re saying about Trump is true, that&#x2019;s major-league blackmail. There&#x2019;s no sympathy there. Yes, I went through a blackmailing; yes, it&#x2019;s horrible; yes, my behavior hurt a large number of people. But do I equate it with the possibility of international interference from an authoritarian dictator? No, I don&#x2019;t. I don&#x2019;t even think of it as the same thing, really. Maybe I&#x2019;m not thoughtful enough.&quot;</li>
	<li><strong>Letterman on how he&apos;d interview Trump compared to certain other late night hosts:</strong> &quot;I don&#x2019;t want to criticize Jimmy Fallon, but I can only tell you what I would have done in that situation: I would have gone to work on Trump...I would just start with a list. &#x201C;You did this. You did that. Don&#x2019;t you feel stupid for having done that, Don? And who&#x2019;s this goon Steve Bannon, and why do you want a white supremacist as one of your advisers? Come on, Don, we both know you&#x2019;re lying. Now, stop it.&#x201D; I think I would be in the position to give him a bit of a scolding and he would have to sit there and take it. Yeah, I would like an hour with Donald Trump; an hour and a half.&apos;&quot;</li>
</ul>

<p>Letterman also talks about still getting used to civilian life, why he doesn&apos;t watch any late night programs anymore, and why he turned down a guest role on his favorite show, <em>Veep</em>. And in case you&apos;re wondering how people living inside <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170308204451/http://money.cnn.com/2017/03/06/media/mark-levin-joel-pollak-breitbart-trump-obama/index.html">Trump&apos;s alternative reality</a> are processing the interview, here ya go:</p>
