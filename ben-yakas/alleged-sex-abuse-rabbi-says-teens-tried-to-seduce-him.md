<p>This week, a Brooklyn yeshiva leader <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170307171839/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/31/brooklyn_yeshiva_leader_accused_of.php">was arrested and accused of sexually abusing</a> at least three teenage boys. Rabbi Yoel Malik, 33, a former teacher and part owner of the now-closed Ohr Hameir school in Borough Park that the victims attended, is alleged to have sexually assaulted most of the boys at different times at a Brooklyn motel. But Malik told investigators that the teens, all between 13-16, tried to seduce him: one police source <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170307171839/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/cops-nab-rabbi-sex-assaut-article-1.1252024">told the News his comments &#x201C;were self-serving. In other words, they were coming on to him.&#x201D;</a></p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170307171839/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/cops-nab-rabbi-sex-assaut-article-1.1252024">

Police added that no charges have been filed concerning a fourth victim, who he also allegedly raped in the motel, and who is currently in Israel. Prosecutors said all four incidents occurred within the last year. Sources </a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170307171839/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Orthodox-School-Rabbi-Sex-Abuse-Accusations-Borough-Park-Brooklyn-189105421.html">told NBC that</a> &quot;Malik admitted to detectives that he had encounters with the boys, but denied having sex with them or giving them alcohol and cigarettes.&quot;</p>

<p>He has been charged with 12 counts of sexual abuse, four counts of criminal sexual act, 11 counts of endangering the welfare of a child and one count of forcible touching. Many family and friends in the community have come to his support: his wife Rachel told the News: &#x201C;This is vicious gossip...He&#x2019;s a good man. I don&#x2019;t know what to say. I hope it&#x2019;s not true.&#x201D;</p>

<p>&#x201C;This is a frame-up,&#x201D; said his 64-year-old mother, Miriam Malik. &#x201C;This is an extortion plot. My son has a heart of gold. He&#x2019;s a wonderful father.&#x201D;  Misri Toba, one of his Bedford-Stuyvesant neighbors, said her husband was friendly with Malik: &#x201C;He&#x2019;s a fine man,&#x201D; said Toba. &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t believe it&#x2019;s true.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Yoel Indig, 22, who said he had been a student of Rabbi Malik&#x2019;s at the school, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170307171839/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/01/nyregion/brooklyn-rabbi-charged-with-sexual-abuse-of-boys.html">told the Times that he believed</a> the whole thing was an extortion plot: &#x201C;Whoever knows this guy knows it doesn&#x2019;t make sense for him to do this,&#x201D; Indig said. &#x201C;He helped lot of people... There was a guy that tried to take money from Mr. Malik. He tried to threaten him with an arrest: &#x2018;If you are not going to give me $25,000, I will make a case and get you arrested.&#x2019; &#x201D;</p>

<p>Before it shuttered, Ohr Hameir was known as a school for troubled Hasidic teens who have been kicked out of mainstream religious schools. Another former teacher at Ohr Hameir, Moshe Pinter, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170307171839/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/man-accused-raping-teen-working-brooklyn-yeshiva-article-1.1108718">was arrested and charged with</a> trying to molest a 13-year old boy in 2007. Pinter started working there AFTER he had been arrested, chaperoning Hasidic teens on weekend getaways while parents had no idea of his criminal past.</p>

<p>This case comes less than a month after ultra-Orthodox leader <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170307171839/http://gothamist.com/tags/NechemyaWeberman">Nechemya Weberman</a> was sentenced to 103 years in jail after being convicted by a Brooklyn jury of 59 counts of sexually abusing a teenage girl.</p>
