<p>There is no quintessential NYC experience quite like running down a subway station platform with your arms flapping all about like a distressed penguin, making eye contact with the conductor, and then hesitantly stretching out your hand to try to slip between the doors before they close. For every time they re-open, they&apos;re just as likely to slam shut in your face, leaving you gazing at your own disconsolate reflection in the greasy window as the train rolls away forever. We&apos;ve all been the woman at the airport having <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025221013/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/12/laguardia_breaks_us_all.php">a complete meltdown</a>, and we&apos;ve all been the person who has spilt coffee on themselves from subway-induced sighing.<br>
 <br>
Frustration is the glue that binds our city together, and in that spirit, we set out to document New Yorkers struggling to commute from point A to point B without incurring an interminable wait at point A because they JUST missed the train by mere seconds WHY GOD DID I STOP FOR COFFEE? In the video above, you&apos;ll find that particular reflection of the commuter experience&#x2014;the exasperation, the anger, the heartbreak, the occasional joy, the far-too-frequent embarrassment, and the third-rail of defeat. </p>

<p>This isn&apos;t about mockery&#x2014;it&apos;s about empathizing with straphangers in our collective daily struggle to get where we&apos;re going. And if you can&apos;t recognize your face in their expressive faces, you may have an undocumented case of transit prosopagnosia. Seek help!</p>
