<p>Yesterday, we dipped our toes into <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160427035509/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/18/ps_parents_are_putting_diaperless_b.php">the world of &#x201C;elimination communication,&#x201D;</a> aka au natural toilet training&#x2014;a phenomenon we previously encountered (without realizing it) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160427035509/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/10/photo_pooping_at_outdoor_cafe_is_ho.php">at a Pier i cafe</a>. Today, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160427035509/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/19/nyregion/babys-latest-going-diaperless-at-home-or-even-in-the-park.html?_r=0">the NY Times has its own report</a> about hipster parents embracing the diaper-free child-rearing method. Or as they put it in their coded language, EC &quot;is finding an audience in the hipper precincts of New York City.&quot;</p>

<p>Thankfully, there turns out there are some limits to the child-rearing style, even for dedicated practitioners. Jada Shapiro, who is a doula, a birth and child-rearing coach, and an adherent of EC, noted that, &#x201C;I have absolutely been at parties and witnessed people putting their baby over the sink.&#x201D; But when it comes to public places, people need to be reasonable: &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t think you can walk down Fifth Avenue and just let your baby poop on the sidewalk.&#x201D;</p>

<p>But <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160427035509/https://twitter.com/lia/status/325062189717262338">some people noted</a> that there was a conspicuous absence of Asian people interviewed in the piece. Why would that matter? Because <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160427035509/http://shanghaiist.com/2013/03/21/chinese_man_poops_in_atm_vestibule_while_friend_withdraws_money.php">according to</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160427035509/http://shanghaiist.com/2013/01/30/outrage_at_mainland_mother_who_let.php">our sister site</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160427035509/http://shanghaiist.com/2012/12/16/reactions_to_the_xiamen_bus_peeing.php">in Shanghai</a>, letting your child poop or pee in public is apparently a kind of normal thing. </p>
