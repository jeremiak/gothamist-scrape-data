<p>Remember <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406162630/http://gothamist.com/tags/marilynhagerty">Marilyn Hagerty</a>? She was the Grand Forks, North Dakota food critic whose Hemingway-esque review of her local Olive Garden went massively viral in 2012, leading to a charming <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406162630/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/14/grand_forkss_food_critic_takes_culi.php">NYC food tour</a>, a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406162630/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/06/marilyn_hagerty_the_book_coming_soo.php">book deal with Anthony Bourdain</a> and a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406162630/http://gothamist.com/2012/08/10/olive_garden_food_critic_wins_award.php">prestigious journalism award</a>, among other things. CBS This Morning has a nice video profile of the 87-year-old Hagerty today, reflecting on her brush with fame, her &quot;refreshing&quot; style, and her &apos;always positive&apos; attitude.</p>

<p>It&apos;s nice that CBS brought her back to the Olive Garden where everything started for a meal&#x2014;but what we <em>really</em> would have liked to know is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406162630/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/15/video_grand_forks.php">what&apos;s up with &quot;Margo,&quot; the hammer she meditates with???</a> Maybe it&apos;s better that we don&apos;t know.</p>
