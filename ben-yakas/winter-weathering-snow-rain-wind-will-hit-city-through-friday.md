<p>It&apos;s time to get your snow gear out of storage: a winter weather advisory will be in effect from 6 p.m. tonight through 6 p.m. Thursday. But as you can see from the handy graphic above, there are a lot of differing opinions on just how much snow the city might get as a result. A few things are clear though: the sloppy winter (pre-spring?) storm that has hit other parts of the country this week will bring a mix of snow, sleet, rain and high winds to the NYC area&#x2014;and it is likely to last through Friday.</p>

<p>Gothamist in-house weatherman Joe Schumacher says he can&apos;t quite figure this storm out yet:</p>

<blockquote>High winds and coastal flooding at high tides tonight and tomorrow are almost certain. The weather service is getting more confident that the city will get a few inches of snow tonight, with a lot more falling on eastern LI. I&apos;m not totally buying the snow in the city part, but the LI snow looks good. Unlike <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425172634/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/04/potent_mid-week_storm_possible.php">what I said on Monday</a> it now looks like snow or rain will linger until Friday.</blockquote>

<p>Suffice it to say, nobody can quite agree on what the city will actually get&#x2014;as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425172634/http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2013/03/05/weather-journal-last-gasp-of-winter/">the Wall Street Journal points out</a>, &#x201C;wildcard&#x201D; and &#x201C;forecast chaos&#x201D; were the buzzwords in meteorological chat circles yesterday.</p>

<p>According <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425172634/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2013/03/06/wind-rain-snow-headed-toward-tri-state/">to CBS</a>, the city will get 3-5 inches of snow; according <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425172634/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Weather-Forecast-Snow-Rain-Wind-New-York-New-Jersey-Connecticut-195524901.html">to NBC NY</a>, the city will get 2 to 5 inches of snow; according <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425172634/http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/03/06/17205699-wallpaper-paste-snowstorm-shuts-down-nations-capital?lite">to NBC News</a>, the city will get &quot;up to 2 inches&quot; of snow; according <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425172634/http://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?lat=40.7999209&amp;lon=-73.96831020000002&amp;site=all&amp;smap=1&amp;searchresult=New%20York%2C%20NY%2010025%2C%20USA">to Weather.gov</a>, the city will get 2 to 4 inches of snow; according <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425172634/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/saturn_to_snow_on_nyc_0Uxckk2jewNTyXBUsyZ3XN">to the Post</a>, the city will get 4 inches tonight alone; according <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425172634/https://twitter.com/TWCBreaking/status/309027110046015488">to the Weather Channel</a>, the city will get 5-8 inches of snow; and according to my grandmother, any amount of snow is the perfect opportunity <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425172634/http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/blogs/youngandhungry/2013/01/31/light-and-stormy-how-to-make-a-snow-cocktail/">to make a snow cocktail!</a></p>
