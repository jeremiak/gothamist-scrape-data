<p>As many people are noting, today is the 8th anniversary of President Bush&apos;s &apos;Mission Accomplished&apos; speech. We wrote about the 5th anniversary <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150914022240/http://gothamist.com/2008/05/01/mission_accompl.php">here</a>, and you can read more about the strange anniversary <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150914022240/http://www.thenation.com/blog/160252/8th-anniversary-mission-accomplished-how-media-heavies-hailed-hero-bush">here</a>. ABC reporter John Berman explains in a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150914022240/http://twitter.com/#!/johnsberman/status/64886959419564033">tweet</a> how bin Laden&apos;s body may have been identified: &quot;Amazing fact vis Brian Ross: years ago US subpoenaed brain from deceased Bin Laden sister...in order to make DNA match when necessary.&quot;</p>

<p>According to CNN, around 9:30 pm, the major news organizations were informed that the President would be making a rare Sunday evening statement about national security. According to MSNBC: &quot;Will be speaking about a &quot;Serious and grave CIA operation happening overseas.&quot; Wolf Blitzer of CNN is calling it &quot;an extremely dramatic statement.&quot; NY Times reporter Brian Stelter just <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150914022240/http://twitter.com/#!/brianstelter/status/64882274163888129">tweeted</a>: <strong>&quot;NYT NEWS ALERT: Osama bin Laden Is Dead, White House Says.&quot;</strong> According to the news wire: &quot;osama bin laden is dead, and has been for over a week, was killed by a US bomb.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: NBC &apos;s Chuck Todd claims that small group is cheering outside White House and sang &quot;We are the champions.&quot; Tzvi Twersky <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150914022240/https://twitter.com/#!/ttwersky/status/64889088175652864">tweets this</a> tidbit: &quot;Want to see amazing? Turn on ESPN and watch the Phillies-Mets. Players are dumbfounded as to why fans are chanting &apos;USA.&apos;&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: ABC says it was a human mission with Navy Seals, and bin Laden was shot in a mansion. President Obama just announced that the operation took place in Pakistan earlier today, and bin Laden was killed &quot;after a firefight.&quot; No civilians were killed, no U.S. soldiers were killed. But Reuters <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150914022240/http://twitter.com/#!/Reuters/status/64907718699388928">adds that</a>, &quot;U.S. official says believes Osama bin Laden&apos;s adult son, two other adults killed during raid on his compound.&quot; CNN says one woman was also killed, because she was used &quot;as a shield&quot; by one of bin Laden&apos;s men.</p>

</p><ul>	<li>&quot;Osama was not a Muslim leader, he was a mass murderer of Muslims.&quot;</li><br>
	<li>&quot;The United States is not at war with Islam.&quot;</li><br>
<li>&#x201C;On nights like this one, we can say that justice has been done.&#x2019;&#x2019;</li><br>
<li>&#x201C;Finally, let me say to the families who lost loved ones on 9/11, that we have never forgotten your loss.&quot;</li></ul><p></p>

<p>Former President George W. Bush made <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150914022240/http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/2011/05/statement_from_fmr_prez_bush.php">this statement</a>: <br>
</p><blockquote>Earlier this evening, President Obama called to inform me that American forces killed Osama bin Laden, the leader of the al Qaeda network that attacked America on September 11, 2001. I congratulated him and the men and women of our military and intelligence communities who devoted their lives to this mission. They have our everlasting gratitude. This momentous achievement marks a victory for America, for people who seek peace around the world, and for all those who lost loved ones on September 11, 2001. The fight against terror goes on, but tonight America has sent an unmistakable message: No matter how long it takes, justice will be done.</blockquote><p></p>

<p>Mayor Bloomberg&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150914022240/http://www.mikebloomberg.com/index.cfm?objectid=AED1EDEA-C29C-7CA2-FA500C295C51D9A9">statement</a> is below:</p>

<blockquote>After September 11, 2001, we gave our word as Americans that we would stop at nothing to capture or kill Osama bin Laden. After the contribution of millions, including so many who made the ultimate sacrifice for our nation, we have kept that word.

<p>The killing of Osama bin Laden does not lessen the suffering that New Yorkers and Americans experienced at his hands, but it is a critically important victory for our nation - and a tribute to the millions of men and women in our armed forces and elsewhere who have fought so hard for our nation.</p>

<p><strong>New Yorkers have waited nearly ten years for this news. It is my hope that it will bring some closure and comfort to all those who lost loved ones on September 11, 2001.</strong></p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>Rep. Peter King (R-NY) on ABC: &quot;I give President Obama tremendous credit for this. He deserves it.&quot; The NY Times has bin Laden&apos;s very long obituary <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150914022240/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/02/world/02osama-bin-laden-obituary.html">here</a>. They dub him in the headline, <strong>&quot;the most wanted face of terrorism.&quot;</strong> Here is Reuters <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150914022240/http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/05/02/us-binladen-idUSTRE7410D320110502">take</a> on bin Laden, the &quot;9/11 author who defied Bush, Obama.&quot;</p>
