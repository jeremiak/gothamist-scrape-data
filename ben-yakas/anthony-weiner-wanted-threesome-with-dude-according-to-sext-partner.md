										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none" style=" width:640px; "> <img alt="122811weiner.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20151122011115im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/122811weiner.jpg" width="640" height="480"> <br> <i>Anthony Weiner hasn&apos;t confirmed the latest allegations (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151122011115/http://biggovernment.com/">BigGovernment</a>)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>Suddenly that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151122011115/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/26/anthony_weiner_grows_porn_stache_fo.php">raunchy porn &apos;stache</a> doesn&apos;t seem so out of character: disgraced former Congressman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151122011115/http://gothamist.com/tags/anthonyweiner">Anthony Weiner</a> still hasn&apos;t escaped the long shadow of his embarrassing sexting scandal. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151122011115/http://www.radaronline.com/exclusives/2011/12/anthony-weiner-threesome-with-another-man-mistress-traci-nobles">RadarOnline has dredged up</a> more details from former sexting partner Traci Noble&apos;s tell-all in which Weiner suggested a m&#xE9;nage &#xE0; trois with a twist: &quot;I&apos;m not really talking about other chicks... How about with another guy?&quot;</p>

<p>The new details come from the proposal for Nobles&apos; evocatively titled <em>I Freinded [sic] You,</em> which details her hot and steamy (and ultimately rather chaste) months-long sexting relationship with Weiner. She replied to his query, &quot;Hmmmm, haven&apos;t done it before.&quot; &quot;It can be hot,&quot; Weiner stated. &quot;Are you turned on by other guys?&quot; Nobles asked. &quot;Well it depends on the guy, but generally yes,&quot; he allegedly admitted.</p>

<p>Other details <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151122011115/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/11/weiner_sext_partner_pens_book_that.php">that have leaked out</a> from the tell-all include: Weiner was very proud of his Johnson (&quot;It&apos;s a big office and you know that&apos;s not the only thing here that&apos;s big&quot;); he may have once masturbated in Congressional bathrooms (&quot;&apos;I had to do some wiping in the bathroom hehe,&apos; he wrote minutes later.&quot;); he may have some longstanding issues with his in-laws (&quot;They just believe I should be Muslim or convert&#x2026; it makes for a lot of uncomfortable meetings&quot; and &quot;they are a bit backwards thinking&quot;); he didn&apos;t like his former rival and replacement Bob Turner (&quot;Just another rich businessman trying to buy himself an election&#x2026; like Bloomberg.&quot;); and he sometimes sexted while using an avatar with a photograph of his niece&apos;s face&#x2014;presumably to keep his identity hidden.</p>

<p>It&apos;s unclear why this new &quot;information&quot; is coming out now, barely a week after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151122011115/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/22/anthony_weiners_wee_weiner_disgrace.php">his son Jordan was born</a>&#x2014;but lest this worries you about Weiner&apos;s ultimate sexual preferences, sources assure RadarOnline this is no big deal: <strong>&quot;Anthony&apos;s not gay though. He&apos;s just very open sexually.&quot;</strong></p>
