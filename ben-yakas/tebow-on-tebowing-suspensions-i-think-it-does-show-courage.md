<p>Four Long Island teens <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150530003520/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/16/video_two_long_island_high_schooler.php">were given suspensions</a> from Riverhead High School this week for Tebowing (the act of getting down on one knee and praying, ala Denver Broncos very religious QB Tim Tebow). The kids thought the suspensions were unfair (two were later rescinded), and yesterday, more than a dozen students <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150530003520/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/special_kneed_kids_KkGeXqqA9UbR8VFoIhW5IM">protested outside the school</a>. And now Tebow himself has commented on the situation: &quot;I think it does show courage from the kids, standing out and doing that, and some boldness.&#x2019;&#x2019;</p>

<p>Tebow added that despite all that boldness and courage, the kids should still listen to their teachers and principal: &#x201C;You have to respect the position of authority and people that God&#x2019;s put as authority over you,&#x201D; Tebow said. &#x201C;So that&#x2019;s part of it, and just finding the right place and the right time to do things is part of it, too.&quot; Of course, the suspended students&apos; gesture really didn&apos;t have much to do with paying homage to God&#x2014;it was something <em>more</em> than that.</p>

<p>&quot;It was basically just a tribute to Tim Tebow,&#x201D; 17-year-old Carroll Connor told the Post. &#x201C;It was more than a religious thing. There was some of that involved obviously, because he prays. I guess it was basically like a moment of silence. I just don&#x2019;t think it&#x2019;s fair.&quot; Connor says he spent his suspension day ranking NFL quarterbacks, with Tebow obviously very high on the list. </p>

<p>Connor&apos;s twin brother Tyler will serve his suspension Monday. The kids (who admit <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150530003520/http://www.foxnews.com/us/2011/12/17/new-york-students-protest-outside-high-school-over-tebowing-incident/">in this interview with Fox</a> that it was basically just a prank) shouldn&apos;t let this get to them though&#x2014;they can just handle it in the same way Tebow handles <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150530003520/http://www.nypost.com/p/sports/more_sports/serby_exclusive_with_tim_tebow_umO1GNRjsz53WWbzbQTZMN/1">opponents who trash talk him on the field</a>: &quot;I respond with a &#x2018;God bless you.&#x2019; If I&#x2019;m really upset, I might even throw out a &#x2018;Jesus loves you.&#x2019;&quot;</p>
