                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="11913ltrain.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20131113095359im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/11913ltrain.jpg" width="640" height="422"> <br> <i> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131113095359/http://www.flickr.com/photos/pixelateit/9740989317/">tom starkweather&apos;s flickr</a></i></div> <p></p>

<p>After the last <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131113095359/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/11/no_l_train_between_lorimer_myrtle-w.php">frustrating setback</a> in September, we told the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131113095359/http://gothamist.com/tags/ltrain">L train</a> we were thinking about seeing other people. We&apos;ve done this dance for too long, and it&apos;s getting too cold outside to settle for shuttle buses. But of course the moment we decide to severe ties, the MTA sends us a bouquet of flowers: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131113095359/http://nypost.com/2013/11/08/l-train-to-get-a-service-boost/">they announced that</a> they plan on boosting service on the L train next year, adding eight more round trips on weekdays and four more round trips on weekends.</p>

<p>In addition, the MTA also wants to boost service on the 2, 3, 4, 5, A, E, and F lines. The 2 and 3 will see a boost of six weekday roundtrips; the 4, 5, A, E and F lines will all have two extra round trips; there will also be an increase in weekday afternoon and early evening service on the G, and an extension of the M to Essex Street in Manhattan on weekends. </p>

<p>The MTA board will vote on the $4.3 million proposed service changes on Wednesday&#x2014;so this is what happens when you have a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131113095359/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/29/fare_hike.php">$1.9 billion budget surplus over the next four years.</a></p>
