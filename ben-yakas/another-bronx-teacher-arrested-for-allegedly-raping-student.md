<p>A 33-year-old Bronx public school teacher has been arrested and accused of having sex with a 16-year-old student. Brian Kearins, who teaches at Herbert H. Lehman High School, has been charged with rape, criminal sex act, and endangering the welfare of a child for a series of sexual encounters with the teen at the school. </p>

<p>According <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130731075242/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/bronx/bx-high-school-teacher-busted-sex-case-cops-article-1.1382959">to the News</a>, the relationship came to light after the victim&#x2019;s sister found a string of emails written by the teen claiming she had been having sex with the teacher since last year. She showed the emails to their mother, who alerted authorities. </p>

<p>Kearins, an employee with the DOE for nearly 10 years, is known as an avid musician who puts <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130731075242/http://www.youtube.com/user/bkearins/videos">videos of himself playing guitar on YouTube.</a> A source at the school told the News they were shocked by the allegations: &#x201C;He&#x2019;s got a new baby,&#x201D; said the source. &#x201C;He&#x2019;s a young guy; a nice guy. He&#x2019;s a family guy...He has a good rapport&#x2014;he&#x2019;s excellent with the kids.&#x201D;</p>

<p>The DOE has reassigned Kearins, and moved to terminate him. This arrest comes a week after another Bronx teacher, 40-year-old <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130731075242/http://gothamist.com/tags/anthonycriscuolo">Anthony Criscuolo</a>, was arrested and accused of raping a 10-year-old special needs student in a different Bronx school.</p>
