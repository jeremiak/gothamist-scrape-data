<p>Co-President-elect Vladimir Putin didn&apos;t cultivate information on Donald Trump <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170120121913/http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/10/veteran-spy-gave-fbi-info-alleging-russian-operation-cultivate-donald-trump">for five years</a> just to see it all go to hell thanks to some nosy, good-for-nothing American reporters. Putin weighed in on everything Trump in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170120121913/https://apnews.com/961eb99aca054f398e8a9b061e9897af/Putin-says-US-administration-trying-to-undermine-Trump?utm_campaign=SocialFlow&amp;utm_source=Twitter&amp;utm_medium=AP">a news conference Tuesday</a>, castigating the Obama administration for attempting to &quot;undermine the legitimacy of the president-elect&quot; despite his &quot;convincing&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170120121913/http://www.denverpost.com/2016/12/06/the-damage-that-80000-trump-voters-in-three-states-can-do/">victory</a>. He even said that the people behind the dossier claims are &quot;worse than prostitutes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I have an impression they practiced in Kiev and are ready to organize a Maidan in Washington, just to not let Trump take office,&quot; Putin said according <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170120121913/http://www.businessinsider.com/putin-responds-to-claims-made-in-trump-russia-dossier-2017-1">to Business Insider</a>, as he discussed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170120121913/http://gothamist.com/2017/01/10/trump_russian_intelligence_blackmail.php">the Trump dossier</a>, which included allegations that Russian operatives have compromising personal and financial information about Trump. In case half the words in Putin&apos;s statement don&apos;t make sense to you off-hand, Putin was referring to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170120121913/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euromaidan">the Euromaidan protests in Ukraine</a> that led to the ousting of the country&apos;s pro-Russian president, Viktor Yanukovych, in February 2014. </p>

<p>&quot;The media frenzy surrounding Trump speaks of the degradation of US political elites,&quot; Putin is also quoted as saying. He added, in a completely unsuspicious way without twirling his mustache or darting his eyes back and forth like a cartoon villain, that he was &quot;not acquainted with Trump&quot; and therefore had &quot;no reasons either to defend or attack him.&quot; Yup, no <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170120121913/http://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-vladimir-putin-russia-hillary-clinton-united-states-europe-516895">reasons</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170120121913/http://www.newsweek.com/2016/09/09/vladimir-putin-donald-trump-493946.html">whatsoever!</a> </p>

<p>Also, Trump himself <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170120121913/http://www.msnbc.com/thomas-roberts/watch/trump-discusses-putin-in-2013-734124099973">said in 2013</a> that he had a relationship with Putin, not that his aides think we should be taking <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170120121913/http://money.cnn.com/2017/01/17/news/economy/trump-anthony-scaramucci-nato-trade-eu-davos/index.html">anything Trump says as necessarily true</a>: &quot;I do have a relationship,&quot; Trump said of Putin at the time. &quot;And I can tell you that he&#x2019;s very interested in what you and I are doing here today. He&#x2019;s probably very interested in what you and I are saying here today. He&#x2019;s probably going to see it in some form. But I do have a relationship with him.&quot; This truly is the most horrifying remake of <em>Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid</em>.</p>

<p>As Randy Newman so eloquently put it, these chicken farmers and file clerks and American intelligence agencies really are gonna be the death of Putin.</p>

<p>Anyway, if you think that Putin wouldn&apos;t comment on the most salacious details in the dossier&#x2014;that Trump hired two prostitutes to pee in a bed that the Obamas once slept in while staying in Moscow&#x2014;you&apos;d be very wrong indeed. He said that Trump &quot;has been with the most beautiful women in the world, so why would he need prostitutes in Moscow?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Trump organized beauty contests,&quot; he added, according to Business Insider. &quot;It&apos;s unlikely he met with young women with such a low social responsibility.&quot; If you are wondering about that translation, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170120121913/https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2017-01-17/putin-says-he-doesn-t-believe-trump-met-prostitutes-in-russia">Bloomberg has their own version</a> of the quote:</p>

<blockquote>Trump is &#x201C;a grown man, and secondly he&#x2019;s someone who has been involved with beauty contests for many years and has met the most beautiful women in the world,&#x201D; Putin said. &#x201C;I find it hard to believe that he rushed to some hotel to meet girls of loose morals, although ours are undoubtedly the best in the world.&#x201D;</blockquote>

<p>But perhaps we should pity Trump (no we shouldn&apos;t), since he clearly has no idea what he&apos;s doing or who he&apos;s dealing with, as outgoing CIA director John Brennan noted this weekend in an interview <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170120121913/http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/cia-chief-not-amused-by-trump-likening-the-cia-to-nazis.html?mid=twitter_dailyintelligencer">with Fox News Sunday</a>: &quot;I don&#x2019;t think he has a full understanding of Russian capabilities and the actions they are taking on the world,&quot; Brennan said. &quot;Mr. Trump has to understand that absolving Russia is a road that he needs to be very, very careful about moving down.&quot;</p>

<p>For his part, Trump has called the dossier &quot;fake news&quot; and &quot;a complete fraud,&quot; and pointed the finger at Brennan and the CIA for leaking the document (even though the dossier was already widely circulating among politicians and journalists for months). Trump even had the balls to compare his treatment to that of Nazi Germany, which understandably incensed Brenann:</p>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Intelligence agencies should never have allowed this fake news to &quot;leak&quot; into the public. One last shot at me.Are we living in Nazi Germany?</p>&#x2014; Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170120121913/https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/819164172781060096">January 11, 2017</a></blockquote>

<p>&#x201C;Tell the families of those 117 CIA officers who are forever memorialized on our wall of honor that their loved ones who gave their lives were akin to Nazis,&quot; Brennan <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170120121913/http://www.wsj.com/articles/cia-director-john-brennan-rejects-donald-trumps-criticism-1484611514">told the Wall Street Journal</a> yesterday. &quot;Tell the CIA officers who are serving in harm&#x2019;s way right now and their families who are worried about them that they are akin to Nazi Germany. I found that to be very repugnant, and I will forever stand up for the integrity and patriotism of my officers who have done much over the years to sacrifice for their fellow citizens.&quot;</p>
