<p>&quot;All of the killing that was done was done with a single assault rifle,&quot; said Orlando Police Chief John Mina. He also identified the gunman as Omar Mateen, a U.S. citizen living in Port St. Lucie who was born in America and whose family is from Afghanistan. Mina added that Mateen used an AR-15 rifle in the attack, the same gun used at Sandy Hook and San Bernadino. </p>

<p><strong>[Original Story Below]</strong> At least 20 people were killed and 42 others were seriously injured when a gunman opened fire at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida last night. The gunman was fatally shot by police after a standoff, and according <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170310071046/http://www.nytimes.com/live/orlando-nightclub-shooting-live-updates/">to the Times</a>, cops have classified the attack as a &#x201C;terror incident.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings said investigators are looking into whether this was an act of domestic or international terror: &quot;This is an incident, as I see it, that we certainly classify as domestic terror incident.&quot;<br>

<p>&quot;It&apos;s appears he was organized and well-prepared,&quot; Orlando Police Chief John Mina said during a press briefing this morning, adding that the shooter had started around 2 a.m. at nightclub Pulse, which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170310071046/http://www.pulseorlandoclub.com/">describes itself</a> as &quot;the hottest gay bar&quot; in Orlando. An officer who was working at the club engaged in a shootout outside the club, after which the gunman ran inside and started taking hostages.</p>
