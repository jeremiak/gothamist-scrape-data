<p>England have given us The Beatles, laughing gas, Monty Python, seltzer, Cadbury chocolate, Greenwich Mean Time, and a healthy appreciation for the importance of dental hygiene&#x2014;and they also gave the world the BBC, one of the last truly great news networks. This week, BBC reporter Laura Trevelyan <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130510161649/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-22023327">took to our subways</a> to study the most curious mode of transport in the colonies. The segment is soundtracked by a looped clip of &quot;You Only Live Once&quot; by The Strokes, because nothing is more NYC than The Strokes circa 2006.</p>

<p>While she is impressed by how quickly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130510161649/http://gothamist.com/tags/subway">we can get to and fro</a>&#x2014;and obviously enchanted by the unimpressed faces of straphangers who are going about their daily routine&#x2014;she ultimately calls our rat-addled subways &quot;grimy.&quot; As one resigned New Yorker tells her, &quot;New York City is known for the dirty subways. I feel like it&apos;s part of our environment already. I&apos;ve never seen a clean subway car, I&apos;ve never seen a brand new train station, and I don&apos;t expect to see it either.&quot;</p>

<p>Of course, following up the segment on NYC subways with one on Barcelona&apos;s transit seems unfair. Of course our stations can&apos;t compare to the porcelain tiles of the efficient, modern European stations in Barcelona&#x2014;although, it seems they do have a serious pickpocket problem. But does <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130510161649/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/03/photo_darth_vader_takes_the_subway.php">Darth Vader</a> ride the tube?
