<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160229004029/http://gothamist.com/tags/bloomberg">Mayor Bloomberg</a> announced yesterday that the city&apos;s incarceration rate has dramatically dropped over the course of his administration compared with the rest of the country. &#x201C;New York&#x2019;s crime rate has gone down more quickly and more steeply than the rest of the country, and we are the model for low crime in this nation,&#x201D; he said at a press conference in the Bronx. &#x201C;But unlike the rest of the country, the number of people we are incarcerating has also gone down.&#x201D; But there&apos;s a flipside to those statistics: a record number of people <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160229004029/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20121221/new-york-city/record-number-of-new-yorkers-arrested-during-bloomberg-era-nypd-stats-show">have been arrested</a> since Bloomberg came to office. Which seems to indicate that while there have been a hell of a lot of arrests, there have not been a lot of convictions&#x2014;which makes sense in a city where <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160229004029/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/13/nypd_on_track_to_shatter_stop-and-f.php">stop-and-frisks</a> are a norm, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160229004029/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/01/nypds_low-level_marijuana_possessio.php">bullshit low-level arrests</a> happen every day.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160229004029/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20121221/new-york-city/record-number-of-new-yorkers-arrested-during-bloomberg-era-nypd-stats-show">According to DNAInfo</a>, the number of NYPD arrests has jumped nearly 23 percent since Bloomberg took office. There were 338,788 collars in 2002 compared to 413,573 last year; there were 98,000 stop-and-frisks in Bloomberg&apos;s first term, compared with nearly 700K last year, a 600 percent increase. </p>

<p>At the same time, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160229004029/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/20/citys-incarceration-rate-plummets-as-nations-climbs/">The NY Times reports that</a> there were 699 inmates per 100K residents in NYC in 2001, compared with 620 inmates per 100K in the country; NYC had a 13 percent higher rate than the rest of the United States. But in 2011, NYC had 474 inmates per 100K residents, compared with 650 inmates per 100K in the country; NYC had an incarceration rate 27 percent lower. &quot;Over that 10-year period, the city&#x2019;s incarceration rate decreased 32 percent while the national rate rose 5 percent,&quot; they write. These <em>are</em> positive numbers, but it is worth noting our city rate still puts us higher than <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160229004029/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_incarceration_rate">all but ten countries on Earth.</a></p>

<p>Those positive statistics led to Bloomberg splashing a little champagne during his appearance yesterday: &#x201C;Some people say the only way you stop crime is to incarcerate,&#x201D; Bloomberg said at a Department of Correction graduation ceremony at Lehman College. &#x201C;We have proven that to be untrue: successfully preventing crime and breaking cycles of criminal activity can save thousands from a life of cycling through the criminal justice system.&#x201D;</p>

<p>So altogether, felony arrests have plummeted and misdemeanor arrests have soared. And Michael Jacobson, the president of the nonpartisan Vera Institute of Justice and a former commissioner of the Correction Department, sees this as an improvement: &#x201C;Clearly the fact that policing strategies have led to declines in both the city jail population and the state prison population is inarguable,&#x201D; he said.</p>

<p>City Councilman Jumaane Williams, who has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160229004029/http://gothamist.com/tags/jumaanewilliams">often been at odds with Bloomberg</a> over stop-and-frisk, agreed with that assessment: &#x201C;I think that&#x2019;s the direction that we definitely need to be going,&quot; he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160229004029/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20121220/new-york-city/number-of-new-yorkers-behind-bars-hits-record-low-bloomberg-says#ixzz2FdgJ3ssO">told DNAInfo</a>. &#x201C;The lock-&apos;em-up strategies of the past haven&#x2019;t worked.&quot;<br>
