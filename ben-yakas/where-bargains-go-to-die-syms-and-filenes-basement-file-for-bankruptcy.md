<p>Say goodbye to these bargains: Syms Corporation, including its subsidiary Filene&apos;s Basement, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160503005139/http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20111102005814/en/Syms-Filene%E2%80%99s-Basement-File-Bankruptcy">have filed for bankruptcy</a>, and plan to close all 46 of their stores. Syms acquired Filene&apos;s Basement out of bankruptcy protection in the spring of 2009 for $62.4 million, but struggled to make the chain profitable again. &#x201C;Blame the economy, blame the world. I wouldn&#x2019;t call it expected, but I wouldn&#x2019;t call it surprising,&#x201C;  St. John&#x2019;s University business professor Anthony Michael Sabino <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160503005139/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/syms_and_filene_unit_seek_bankruptcy_KbcCgtyNrcimccXdAg9S7L?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">told the Post.</a></p>

<p>The two massive discount retailer stores employ about 2,450 people mostly in the Eastern U.S. Syms Corp was founded by Sy Syms in 1959, while Filene&#x2019;s Basement goes back to 1909 and founder William Filene. This will <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160503005139/http://www.boston.com/Boston/businessupdates/2011/11/filene-basement-files-for-bankruptcy-again/5Yrg2O79EQoGVuTh8PpgCL/index.html">also mean the end of</a> Filene&#x2019;s Basement &#x201C;Running of the Brides&#x201D; event, where hundreds of frenzied brides-to-be rummage through racks of wedding dresses at discount prices.</p>

<p>These closings seem indicative of another trend sweeping through NYC: according to a retail survey by the Center for an Urban Future, chain stores <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160503005139/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/11/01/survey-finds-chain-stores-spreading-more-slowly/">are not spreading as much</a>, or even decreasing, as economic woes catch up with the city. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160503005139/http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2011/11/01/manhattan-now-has-fewer-chain-stores/?mod=google_news_blog">They found that</a> there are fewer chain stores in Manhattan than there were one year ago, and had a 2 percent decrease altogether. For the record: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160503005139/http://gothamist.com/tags/dunkindonuts">Dunkin&#x2019; Donuts</a> still has the most stores in the city with 466.</p>
