<p>A 22-year-old man has been arrested for allegedly fatally stabbing a 60-year-old Queens woman  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161113153102/http://gothamist.com/2016/09/01/60-year-old_woman_fatally_stabbed_o.php">this week.</a> Yonatan Galvez-Marin <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161113153102/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/queens/suspect-nypd-aunt-slaying-arrested-queens-article-1.2777645">was arrested</a> in Jamaica Hills close to where he is accused of killing Nazma Khanam as she walked home.</p>

<p>Khanam, a retired teacher, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161113153102/http://gothamist.com/2016/09/02/family_says_queens_woman_was_killed.php">had been walking home</a> with her husband from their souvenir shop around 9:15 p.m. on Wednesday when she was attacked outside of 160-12 Normal Road in Jamaica. Her husband, 75-year-old Shamsul Alam Khan, suffers from asthma, and had stopped to catch his breath as she walked ahead. He heard his wife utter a &quot;blood curdling scream&quot; out of view from him. When he reached her, she was bleeding on the sidewalk with a part of a knife sticking out.</p>

<p>&quot;Somebody killed me,&quot; Khanam <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161113153102/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/woman-stabbed-death-queens-walking-home-husband-article-1.2773987">reportedly told</a> her husband as he held her in his arms. Khanam was rushed to Jamaica Hospital and pronounced dead shortly afterwards.</p>

<p>The couple had come to the U.S. in 2009 and became citizens in June. Family members have decried the murder as a hate crime, noting Nazma was wearing traditional Muslim clothing at the time, and no personal possessions were taken. Her nephew, Transit Officer Humayun Kabir, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161113153102/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/queens/suspect-nypd-aunt-slaying-arrested-queens-article-1.2777645">told the News</a> his &quot;family doesn&#x2019;t deserve to be going through this.&quot;</p>

<p>Galvez-Marin, who has no prior criminal record in NY, has been charged with murder, robbery and possession of a weapon. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161113153102/http://nypost.com/2016/09/04/suspect-arrested-in-fatal-stabbing-of-nypd-cops-aunt/">The Post adds</a> that police sources say he admitted to attempting to rob Khanam.</p>
