<p>According to the video&apos;s uploader, the man had fallen under the train while switching between cars: &quot;An African American man tried to ride between cars on a Q train in Brooklyn (Avenue M station) and he fell through the gap. The man was stuck in between the cars. The moral of the story is if you see something please say something and please don&apos;t ride in between the cars.&quot; Cops had no additional information about the incident. </p>
