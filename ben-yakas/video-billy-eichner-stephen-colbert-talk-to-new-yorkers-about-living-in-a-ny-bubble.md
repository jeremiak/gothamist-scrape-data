<p>&quot;Proudly elitist gay Jewish liberal native New Yorker piece of shit snowflake&quot; Billy Eichner was joined by Stephen Colbert for the latest <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170914135834/http://gothamist.com/tags/billyonthestreet"><em>Billy On The Street</em></a> segment, which was one of the least shouty <em>Billy</em> segments I&apos;ve seen yet. The two had some actual conversations with NYers to see what they think about the so-called &quot;NY bubble&quot; (or as Eichner later puts it, &quot;an inclusive bubble&quot;) and what messages they have for Trump. </p>

<p>Along the way, the two celebs don some real bubbles, and also stumble upon what may be  the best advertisement for NYC of all time: &quot;I&apos;ve dropped my phone on the streets of New York three times since I lived here, and every single time it&apos;s been returned to me.&quot;</p>
