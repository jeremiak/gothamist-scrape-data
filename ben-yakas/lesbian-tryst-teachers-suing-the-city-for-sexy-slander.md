<p>The two teachers from James Madison High School who were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141027025425/http://gothamist.com/tags/cindymauro">accused</a> of having a steamy lesbian tryst in the janitor&apos;s closet last year are sick and tired of your snickering, sexy jokes, and they are gonna make the city pay for it. Former teachers Alini Brito and Cindy Mauro <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141027025425/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2011/02/23/2011-02-23_horndog_high_teachers_fired_over_alleged_lesbian_sex_in_classroom_sue_nyc_for_2_.html">are suing</a> the city for $2 million, for &quot;wrongful termination, libel and slander.&quot;</p>

<p>Their joint lawyer, Michael Valentine, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141027025425/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/teachers_suit_steamy_lesbian_romp_HteseGxMH9Fv2W5WrWmlRL">explained</a> that the two have been unfairly and thoroughly punished since the allegations came out, ruining their reputations and leading causing them to lose their jobs: &quot;They&apos;ve had to deal with these false allegations of engaging in lesbian sex. It&apos;s been painful.&quot; Of course, if we&apos;re being smarmy, having a joint lawyer doesn&apos;t exactly convince us that they&apos;re <em>not</em> involved. </p>

<p>The women claim that the janitor who &quot;caught&quot; them let his imagination run wild, and in actuality, Brito was having a medical emergency. Brito <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141027025425/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/08/lesbian_tryst_teacher_was_just_gett.php">claims she is</a> a diabetic, and invited Mauro upstairs to &quot;check her blood sugar&quot; and give her an insulin shot. Valentine says that the janitor, who is named in the lawsuit, jumped tohorny conclusions: &quot;He admitted in his hearing testimony that he only saw one person, but speculated there were two women in there having sex. <strong>When does a fish become a whale?</strong>&quot; Valentine said.</p>
