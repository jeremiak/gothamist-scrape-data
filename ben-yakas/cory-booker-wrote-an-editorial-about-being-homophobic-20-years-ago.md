<p>With <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160525135537/http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2013/01/10/poll-voters-like-booker-more-than-lautenberg/">supremely-popular</a> Newark &quot;Rock Star&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160525135537/http://gothamist.com/tags/corybooker">Mayor Cory Booker</a> gearing up for a Senate run, he&apos;s faced <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160525135537/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/14/nyregion/promise-vs-reality-in-newark-as-mayor-eyes-higher-office.html?pagewanted=2&amp;_r=2&amp;smid=tw-share&amp;pagewanted=all">a bit of a backlash</a> in recent weeks&#x2014;which is to be expected from a public figure who has been so universally adored thus far. It&apos;s like that old saying goes: no matter how many old ladies you <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160525135537/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/13/newark_mayor_cory_booker_rescues_wo.php">save from burning buildings</a>, you can&apos;t solve <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160525135537/http://gothamist.com/2012/11/01/hot_pocket_shortage_in_new_jersey_c.php">every Hot Pockets crisis</a> through Twitter, or something. And likewise, everyone is looking to dig up dirt on the prince of Brick City&#x2014;to that end, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160525135537/http://www.buzzfeed.com/andrewkaczynski/cory-booker-wrestled-with-his-own-homophobia">Buzzfeed found</a> a 1992 column from The Stanford Daily in which Booker reflected on his own homophobia, and how he got over it.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160525135537/http://www.stanforddaily.com/2013/01/09/cory-booker-pointing-the-finger-at-gays/">The whole piece is worth reading</a>, as Booker recounts how he struggled with his irrational prejudices with unflinching honesty and admirable clarity. He writes of his younger self:  </p>

<blockquote>Yet, while I was highly adroit at maintaining an air of acceptance, I couldn&#x2019;t betray my feelings. I was disgusted by gays. The thought of two men kissing each other was about as appealing as a frontal lobotomy.

<p>Allow me to be more direct, escaping the euphemisms of my past - I hated gays. The disgust and latent hostility I felt toward gays were subcategories of hatred, plain and simple.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>Then as a freshman, Booker met Daniel Bao, a gay counselor at Stanford&#x2019;s peer counseling group The Bridge. Bao &#x201C;quickly disarmed me with his personal testimony,&#x201D; Booker wrote, about &quot;violence from strangers and family, horrible images of beatings, destruction of property and the daily verbal condemnations.&quot; </p>

<blockquote>Well, it didn&#x2019;t take me long to realize that the root of my hatred did not lie with gays but with myself. It was my problem. A problem I dealt with by ceasing to tolerate gays and instead seeking to embrace them.</blockquote>

<p>He concluded:</p>

<blockquote>Alas, occasionally I still find myself acting defensive if someone thinks I am gay or sometimes I remain silent when others slam and slander. These realizations hurt me deeply. I must continue to struggle for personal justice. This is my most important endeavor.</blockquote>

<p>Responding to questions and compliments about the article on Twitter, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160525135537/https://twitter.com/CoryBooker/status/289422998363074560">he wrote</a>: &quot;I was writing about my teenage struggle for integrity. Thanks.&quot; Booker has come a long long way from there, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160525135537/http://www.towleroad.com/2012/09/booker.html">as Towel Road pointed out</a>, and is now one of the most outspoken gay advocates in public office.</p>
