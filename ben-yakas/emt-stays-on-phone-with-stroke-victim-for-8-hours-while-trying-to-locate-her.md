<p>A heroic EMT stayed on the phone with a stroke victim for nearly eight hours last week while FDNY workers tried to locate where she was. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130723014441/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/hour_stroke_vic_call_Hj1cArXID8WSdoLnsHs1mO?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20Local">According to the Post</a>, EMT Joann Hilman-Payne received a call from Mary Thomas around 1 p.m. Monday; Thomas&apos; speech was badly slurred because of the stroke, so Hilman-Payne stayed on the line with her while rescuers attempted to pinpoint her location.</p>

<p>Rescuers first were dispatched to an East 71st Street address based on a cellphone tower relaying Thomas&#x2019; call, but she wasn&apos;t there. They tried to find a Manhattan address for Thomas, but it was no help, as she was at work when she became ill. They contacted Verizon Wireless and the NYPD to help trace Thomas&#x2019; cellphone. </p>

<p>&#x201C;Throughout the entirety [Hilman-Payne] worked to keep the patient awake, she never lost her own composure and remained calm while attempting to elicit more information from the patient,&#x201D; wrote Emergency Medical Dispatch Capt. Philip Weiss in a letter asking for recognition for Hilman-Payne and her colleagues. Finally, Verizon helped lead FDNY to an East 72nd Street apartment, where Thomas had been working as a maid.</p>

<p>Thomas was taken to Lennox Hill Hospital, where she is being treated in the ICU. Hilman-Payne &#x201C;remained on the phone with the patient for almost eight hours being spelled only briefly for reasons of personal necessity,&#x201D; Weiss wrote. &#x201C;I have no doubt that without the efforts of all involved [Thomas&#x2019;] outcome would not have been positive.&quot;</p>
