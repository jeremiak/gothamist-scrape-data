<p>Donald Trump has struggled to find anyone&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170626125647/http://www.vulture.com/2016/12/musicians-who-declined-trumps-inauguration.html">literally, anyone!</a>&#x2014;who wants to perform at his inauguration. When 3 Doors Down, a one-hit wonder from 2000, are your headliners, you probably know <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170626125647/http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/01/donald-trump-inauguration-twilight-zone">where you stand.</a> But Trump is such a deeply toxic figure, even cover bands are dropping out of Trump-adjacent inauguration events: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170626125647/http://www.bstreetband.com/">The B Street Band</a>, the preeminent <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170626125647/http://gothamist.com/tags/brucespringsteen">Bruce Springsteen</a> and the E Street Band cover band, has pulled out of the Garden State Presidential Inaugural Gala because of the backlash over the performance&#x2014;and because of their deep respect for The Boss.</p>

<p>Founder Will Forte (no relation to the former SNL star), who is the band&apos;s keyboardist, manager, agent and publicist, sent a statement to Springsteen-online magazine <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170626125647/http://www.backstreets.com/news.html">Backstreets</a> about their decision to drop the event.</p>

<blockquote>With deepest apologies to our fans and the New Jersey Inaugural Ball committee, the B Street Band is withdrawing from performing at this year&apos;s inauguration Gala.

<p>Our decision is based SOLELY on the respect and gratitude we have for Bruce and the E Street Band.</p>

<p>Bruce&apos;s music has been the foundation of our livelihood. The B Street Band would not exist without the talents of Bruce and our E Street brothers.</p>

<p>We are most grateful to these rock legends and look forward to many more years of emulating and performing the Forever Music, of Bruce Springsteen.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>Last week, after the initial outcry (it even made it into <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170626125647/http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/a-springsteen-cover-band-is-a-fitting-choice-for-trumps-inauguration">a New Yorker thinkpiece!</a>) over the tribute band playing the gala, Forte tried to smooth over the situation. He <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170626125647/http://www.villagevoice.com/music/b-street-band-says-they-d-cancel-inaugural-ball-performance-if-springsteen-asked-9564646">told the Village Voice</a> that the group had performed at the apolitical event in 2009 and 2013 in honor of Obama (&quot;Every four years, the nonpartisan New Jersey State Society of Washington, DC sponsors a bipartisan inaugural gala in January regardless of which party wins the White House&quot;) and that the band had booked this year&apos;s gig four years ago.</p>

<p>But the negative headlines caused Forte to revisit his stance against canceling the contract. &quot;As time went by, the complexity of the situation became real immense and intense,&quot; Forte <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170626125647/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/bruce-springsteen-cover-band-drops-out-of-donald-trump-party-w461203">told Rolling Stone</a>. &quot;The band was caught in a hurricane. We didn&apos;t see this coming, of course.&quot; It sounds like the major turning point may have been when two current and former E Street band members commented on the controversy (Springsteen himself has not commented).</p>

<p>&quot;We felt that we had to make it known that we didn&apos;t want to seem disrespectful, in any way, shape or form, to Bruce and his music and his band,&quot; Forte told Rolling Stone. &quot;I don&apos;t want to upset them. We owe everything to him and our gratitude and respect to the band is imperative above all else. It became clear to us that this wasn&apos;t working and we just had to do what we thought was the right thing to do and that was to pull out.&quot;</p>

<p>Reading Forte&apos;s explanation for how everything went down, it&apos;s hard not to feel bad for the group, who sound rather apolitical in general. &quot;I don&apos;t even know if they have any politics,&quot; he joked with RS. &quot;All this stuff made it clear to us that this event is not worth it. It&apos;s just a job to us. We&apos;re just trying to hold up a contract. We&apos;re not trying to prove anything. We&apos;re just a fun band!&quot;</p>

<p>On the plus side, this presents an opportunity for the C Street Band to finally hit the big time.</p>
