										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="3111marij.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150205032940im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/3111marij.jpg" width="250" height="356" class="image-right"> </span>A month ago, employees at Dr. Toothy&#x2019;s Dental Office in Chinatown were shocked when <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150205032940/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/02/thirty-one_pounds_of_pot_makes_it_t.php">they received</a> a delivery of a 31-pound brick of marijuana, we assume from the Marijuana Fairy. Now, two Pennsylvanian residents have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150205032940/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/2011/04/30/2011-04-30_surprise_delivery_pennsylvania_residents_keep_finding_marijuana_packages_on_door.html">also received</a> surprise packages with pounds of marijuana, worth $22,400 each on the street. So what the heck is going on with dealers? Is this becoming a trend? And is there any way we can win this lottery?</p>

<p>Because it doesn&apos;t seem like medical marijuana is coming to NYC anytime soon. Not that the question isn&apos;t amusing Mayor Bloomberg a bit. During his weekly WOR radio <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150205032940/http://www.observer.com/2011/politics/roundup-bloomberg-cools-diddy-escort-koo-sees-immigrant-city">appearance</a>, Bloomberg took this Twitter question (watch him answer it below), which he was &quot;reticent&quot; to read at first: <strong>&quot;What&apos;s up with medical marijuana in NYC. Is it going to be OK&apos;d soon? Need to know by this weekend.&quot;</strong> He laughed and answered it wasn&apos;t legal yet, but added: </p>

<blockquote>The argument is that the only way you&apos;re ever going to end the drug trade is to legalize drugs and take away the profit motive, and the corruption...in Mexico, tens of thousands of people have been killed in wars with the government trying to clamp down on drug dealers. There&apos;s no easy answers to any of these things. There are places where they&apos;ve legalized drugs, and whether it destroyed the society or didn&apos;t, it&apos;s up to debate.</blockquote>

<p>Last year, the NYPD arrested 50,383 people for low-level marijuana offenses, making low-level pot possession the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150205032940/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/10/welcome_to_nyc_the_marijuana_arrest.php">number one</a> cause of arrest in NYC. Next Saturday, there will be a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150205032940/http://www.theweedblog.com/new-york-city-cannabis-peace-march/">Marijuana Peace March</a> to protest the drug war, starting at noon at Washington Square Park. Here&apos;s hoping the Marijuana Fairy blesses the march with one of her packages...and maybe some Doritos. </p>
