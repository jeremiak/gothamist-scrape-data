<p>So far we&apos;ve seen a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150112013417/http://nypost.com/2013/11/03/exposing-terry-richardson-fashions-favorite-pervert/">massive amount</a> of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150112013417/http://www.thegloss.com/2010/03/16/fashion/terry-richardson-is-really-creepy-one-models-story/">first-person essays</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150112013417/http://observer.com/2014/03/the-true-nature-of-terry-richardsons-work/">expos&#xE9;s</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150112013417/http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/03/12/anonymous-model-goes-public-with-allegations-against-terry-richardson.html">accusations</a> about photographer Terry Richardson&apos;s disgusting behavior.

<p>Model <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150112013417/https://twitter.com/EmmaJAppleton">Emma Appleton</a> posted the above screenshot today. She wrote a little more about what happened while responding to people on Twitter.</p>

<p>Of course, this is only proof in so far as someone identified in Appleton&apos;s phone as &quot;Terry Richardson&quot; wrote her a creepy message with a Richardson-esque offer. We can&apos;t know for sure whether someone who allegedly once told a model, &quot;if you make me come, you get an A,&quot; would also proposition someone over social media, not close enough to be able to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150112013417/http://www.thegloss.com/2010/03/16/fashion/terry-richardson-is-really-creepy-one-models-story/2/">&apos;waggle his dick&apos; in her face</a>. Richardson <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150112013417/http://gothamist.com/2014/04/03/franco_horny.php">isn&apos;t James Franco</a>, after all&#x2014;he&apos;s only <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150112013417/https://www.google.com/search?q=james+franco+terry+richardson&amp;oq=james+franco+terry+richardson&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57l2j69i59j69i60l3.3175j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;es_sm=91&amp;ie=UTF-8">buds with him</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: Because Appleton has seemingly erased her Twitter account, here&apos;s a screenshot of the message:</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="screenshotterry.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150112013417im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/screenshotterry.jpg" width="640" height="606" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>Vogue also gave this statement about Richardson: &quot;The last assignment Terry Richardson had for US Vogue appeared in the July 2010 issue and we have no plans to work with him in the future,&quot; said Director of Communications, Hildy Kuryk.</p>
