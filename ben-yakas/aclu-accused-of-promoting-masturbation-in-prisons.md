<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="6111prison.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20111104131511im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/6111prison.jpg" width="250" height="300" class="image-left"> </span>It seems that people just can&apos;t be reasonable when it comes to porn and prisons: the ACLU filed a lawsuit against a South Carolina jail which allegedly didn&apos;t allow prisoners to receive any reading materials other than the Bible. In response, the prison&apos;s lawyers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111104131511/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/2011/06/01/2011-06-01_aclu_sues_south_carolina_prison_in_moncks_corner_wants_porn_for_inmates_jails_la.html?r=news&amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+nydnrss%2Fne">argue that the</a> ACLU is just saying that because they want to give prisoners lots of fetishistic, violent porn. Has the world really learned nothing from <em>Buttwoman 2: Behind Bars</em>?? </p>

<p>The attorneys major argument is that inmates are not allowed to read materials bound together by tape, staples, paper clips or clasps. But they&apos;re just as worried about books which could &quot;encourage deviant sexual behavior&quot;&#x2014;we assume they&apos;re referring to filthy novels such as <em>Ethan Frome</em>, <em>Lady Chatterley&apos;s Lover</em> and that erotic hotbed <em>Middlemarch</em>. &quot;It&apos;s going to create all kinds of problems because <strong>you&apos;re going to have an issue with masturbation at that point. Then, you run the risk of not just sexual assault, but physical assault because men don&apos;t want to see other men doing those types of activities</strong>,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111104131511/http://www.wesh.com/r-video/28078598/detail.html">said Robin L. Jackson</a>, one of the co-counsel for the Berkeley County Jail in Moncks Corner. Because we&apos;re sure men <em>never</em> masturbate in prison unless they have dirty books to help fuel their imaginations. </p>

<p>An ACLU spokesman laughed at the idea that they were promoting pornography for prisoners: &quot;The latest thing they have come up with in response for preliminary injunction was the notion that we are trying to allow pornography into the jail. Absolutely nothing could be further from the truth,&quot; said spokesman Will Matthews. Rather, the ACLU thinks the jail&apos;s policy is just too broad when it comes to reading material&#x2014;they cited the example that that prisoners were previously banned from receiving a publication with a Venus de Milo sculpture, and a copy of the Washington Post because it contained an ad with women in lingerie. Hopefully, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111104131511/http://abclocal.go.com/kabc/story?section=news/national_world&amp;id=8162220">the hyperbole</a> (&quot;The ACLU is pushing for porn...&quot;) can stop soon&#x2014;this isn&apos;t a debate about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111104131511/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/25/public_libraries_defend_constitutio.php">public libraries</a>, after all.</p>
