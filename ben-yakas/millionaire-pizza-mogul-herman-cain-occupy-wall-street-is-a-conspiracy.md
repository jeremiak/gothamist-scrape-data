<p>According to a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111007124915/http://www.politickerny.com/2011/10/05/occupy-wall-street-protesters-more-popular-than-congress-poll/">new poll by Rasmussen Reports</a>, 33 percent of Americans have a favorable opinion of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111007124915/http://gothamist.com/tags/occupywallstreet">Occupy Wall Street</a> protesters (only 27 percent have a negative view, while 40 percent have no opinion). Most importantly, 79 percent of Americans agree with the protesters primary point that the &#x201C;The big banks got bailed but the middle class got left behind.&#x201D; But don&apos;t tell that to Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain, because he thinks the whole thing is a giant pro-Obama conspiracy: &quot;I don&apos;t have the facts to back this up, but I happen to believe that these demonstrations are planned and orchestrated to distract from the failed policies of the Obama Administration,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111007124915/http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2011/10/05/herman-cain-im-more-than-the-anti-romney/">he told the WSJ</a>. At least he admitted there were no facts involved in his statements.</p>

<p>Cain, who has surprisingly jumped into a tie for first place among Republican presidential candidates <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111007124915/http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20115655-503544.html">in recent polls</a>, says out of work people only have themselves to blame: <strong>&quot;Don&apos;t blame Wall Street, don&apos;t blame the big banks, if you don&apos;t have a job and you&apos;re not rich, blame yourself. </strong>It is not someone&apos;s fault if they succeeded, it is someone&apos;s fault if they failed.&quot; To Cain, who has essentially been a professional CEO his whole life, these protests stink of some socialist mumbo jumbo: &quot;These demonstrations, I honestly don&apos;t understand what they&apos;re looking for. To me, they come across more as anti-capitalism.&quot;</p>

<p>Cain most sounds like Fox host Bill O&apos;Reilly, who made similar statements about protesters <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111007124915/http://crooksandliars.com/john-amato/bill-oreilly-occupy-wall-street-protest">yesterday to Juan Williams</a>. He accused protesters of being lazy slackers: &quot;<strong>They&#x2019;re jobless because they don&#x2019;t want to work!</strong> They admitted it to us. They won&apos;t work for the corporate man.&quot;</p>

<p>But there are some wealthy people who disagree strongly with Cain and O&apos;Reilly: approximately $35,000 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111007124915/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2011/10/05/2011-10-05_big_money_in_wall_st_protest_cash_coming_in_from_around_the_world.html">has been sent</a> to protesters since their campaign started three weeks ago. Another $30,000 was collected by the fund-raising website Kickstarter, and organizers expect more money will come in as protesters prove that they&apos;re not going anywhere any time soon. As if that weren&apos;t enough, OWS also got an endorsement from Congressman Dennis Kucinich, who gave his support via video: &quot;I say to you that your presence is making a difference.&quot;</p>
