Tip off is 10:35 a.m.&quot; Well, now we know what it is: the band have set up a speaker  in the middle of the court at MSG, and are live &quot;streaming&quot; their entire new album, <em>Hot Sauce Committee Pt. 2</em>! There also looks like there&apos;s one man in the empty arena, waving his hands in the air like he just don&apos;t care. Listen/watch the stream below. We can say without a doubt that it&apos;s the only good thing that&apos;s happened in MSG in the last 24 hours.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: the 10:35 a.m. stream just finished, but it&apos;s unclear whether there will be another one in the next few hours, so we&apos;ll leave this here just in case.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: yup, they&apos;re re-broadcasting the stream now!</p>
