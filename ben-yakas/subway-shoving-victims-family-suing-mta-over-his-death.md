<p>In December, 58-year-old <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141225022722/http://gothamist.com/tags/kisuckhan">Ki-Suck Han</a> was fatally shoved onto the subway tracks at the 49th Street N/R/Q station in Manhattan. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141225022722/http://gothamist.com/tags/naeemdavis">Naeem Davis</a>, the homeless man who was arrested and charged for the shoving, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141225022722/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/16/subway_shoving_suspect_calls_incide.php">admitted to police he shoved</a> the victim into the oncoming train, but argued that Han was the aggressor. Now, Han&apos;s family <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141225022722/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/family-queens-man-crushed-train-sues-mta-article-1.1302810?localLinksEnabled=false">is suing the MTA</a> for negligence. &#x201C;The motorman and the Transit Authority need to be held accountable for a man who was crushed to death,&#x201D; said attorney Michael Kremins, who&#x2019;s representing Han&#x2019;s 20-year-old daughter, Ashley. &#x201C;If everybody was doing their job and paying attention, this man would still be alive.&quot;<br>
<span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right"> <img alt="33013han2.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141225022722im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/33013han2.jpg" width="250" height="258"> <br> <i style=" width:250px; ;display:block"> Ki-Suck Han</i></div> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141225022722/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/subway_push_kin_suing_mta_UbxWKxqP4Nyii5sMAqDtKM?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Manhattan">In the lawsuit</a>, the family claims Han &#x201C;suffered from fear of impending death&#x201D; before he died, the MTA failed to keep the platform &#x201C;in a safe condition,&#x201D; and motorman Terrence Legree failed &#x201C;to make timely and adequate use of the brakes&#x201D; when coming into the station. &#x201C;Ki Suck Han sustained severe injuries including but not limited to blunt impact to the head and crush injuries of the head and torso resulting in death,&#x201D; court papers say.<p></p>

<p>The lawsuit also cites the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141225022722/http://gothamist.com/tags/subwayfatalities">recent rash of subway fatalities</a> as one of the inspirations for the suit: &#x201C;In the last several months it&#x2019;s almost every week you pick up the paper and it&#x2019;s another subway death,&#x201D; Kremins noted. &#x201C;That&#x2019;s the main reason we commenced this action, to hopefully prevent this from happening to others.&#x201D;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141225022722/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/06/subway_shoving_suspect_pleads_not_g.php">Davis told police after the incident</a> that Han attacked him first, claiming he only shoved Han onto the tracks after seeing him brandish something resembling a knife. His legal aid defense lawyer, Stephen Pokart, echoed that statement, saying Han was the aggressor during the confrontation, telling reporters his client reportedly &quot;was involved in an incident with a man who was drunk and angry.&quot;</p>

<p>Han&apos;s wife has previously said that she had argued with her husband that morning and that he had a drinking problem. &#x201C;He was drunk. We had a fight before he left here at 11 a.m. I told him to leave,&#x201D; she <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141225022722/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/queens/subway_wife_wants_last_love_you_uowTl5OJYXkfmM2tO91zTN">told the Post</a> in December. Han had a blood-alcohol level of .24at the time of his death, three times the legal limit for driving. &#x201C;Even for drinkers, that&#x2019;s awfully drunk,&#x201D; Pokart added. At the same time, Davis <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141225022722/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/07/subway_shoving_suspects_gives_jailh.php">admitted in a jailhouse interview</a> that he was under the influence of pot at the time of the incident, and he kept hearing voices telling him he had to do something.</p>
