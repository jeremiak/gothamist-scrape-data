<p>Blur, one of the two greatest British rock bands of the &apos;90s, is set to headline the massive closing concert of the 2012 London Olympics in Hyde Park soon&#x2014;which means you can listen to the whole show live starting at 4 p.m. our time. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504142150/http://player.absoluteradio.co.uk/core/radioplayer/ar/?sq">Click here to live stream the broadcast</a>, thanks to Absolute Radio. </p>

<p>As Blur fans know, the future of the band is always perilously hanging in the wind&#x2014;with no more shows booked, this is the last gig for the storied band for the foreseeable future. And band members are hedging their bets about anything more: &quot;I really don&apos;t know what happens next, that&apos;s the only honest answer I can give. It&apos;s precarious though. If Hyde Park is shit, then that&apos;s definitely it,&quot; bassist Alex James <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504142150/http://www.nme.com/news/blur/65466">told NME.</a></p>

<p>And even if you miss today&apos;s broadcast, the band <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504142150/http://www.blur.co.uk/news/blur-parklive-available-on-download-cd-and-cddvd/">will be releasing the whole show on Monday</a> via iTunes. Then a week later, a two-disc album titled <em>Parklife</em> will be released, containing the Hyde Park show as well as a bonus disc of unreleased live tracks selected from the band&#x2019;s recent warm up shows. To top it off, the band will release a 5-disc version of <em>Parklife</em> in November, with three CDs of shows, a DVD of the Hyde Park gig, and an exclusive CD of tracks titled Blur Live At The 100 Club, recorded at the London venue in August. </p>
