<p>The joy felt over <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502142120/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/08/bowie.php">the fantastic surprise news</a> that David Bowie was coming out of semi-retirement to release a new album, <em>The Next Day</em>, was only slightly deflated by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502142120/http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/david-bowie-wont-be-touring-his-producer-tony-visconti-confirms-8448586.html">the follow-up news</a> that he likely wouldn&apos;t be touring at all. Having seen him at MSG on his <em>Reality</em> tour in 2003&#x2014;in what may turn out to be his final tour ever&#x2014;this reporter can attest that even with his health problems then, Bowie was giving it his all in his performances. In terms of live albums, Bowie&apos;s catalogue is surprisingly thin&#x2014;but there is one little-known live release that towers above the rest. Below, listen to Bowie live at Nassau Coliseum in Long Island in 1976, one of the only documents of the epic <em>Station To Station</em> tour.</p>

<p>This recording (see the tracklist at the bottom) was only released as a bonus disc on the re-release of <em>Station To Station</em>, Bowie&apos;s seminal 1976 album that pointed toward his hallowed Berlin Trilogy (<em>Low</em>, <em>Heroes</em>, <em>Lodger</em>). Unfortunately, there are almost no video clips of the actual tour (Bowie was reportedly heavy into cocaine during this period, and based on interviews, doesn&apos;t seem to remember it very well), but you can see some rehearsal footage below.</p>

<p>You&apos;ll be hard-pressed to find a better document of a Bowie concert than this one. <em>Ziggy Stardust: The Motion Picture</em> is essential for fans because of the film (<em>Live Santa Monica &apos;72</em> has a superior performance from that era). <em>Stage</em> has some excellent performances, but the recordings were taken from various shows. <em>David Live</em>, from the <em>Diamond Dogs</em> tour, was a mess; <em>Glass Spider</em> isn&apos;t as bad as you&apos;d think, but it&apos;s still a live tour behind his worst album (in general, Bowie&apos;s &apos;80s performance were not his best). We have yet to find anyone who has subjected themselves to <em>Tin Machine Live: Oy Vey Baby.</em> </p>

<p>But while Bowie won&apos;t be touring again most likely, there IS a chance he might perform one or two standalone shows, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502142120/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/david-bowies-the-next-day-album-a-track-by-track-preview-20130115">per his producer Tony Visconti</a>: &quot;He says that he will only play if he feels like it, but no tour. Like, if wanted to do the odd show in New York or, I don&apos;t know, London, he would if he felt like it.&quot;</p>
