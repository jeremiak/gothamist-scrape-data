<p>You better not pout, you better not cry, you probably should wear pants: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130515165822/http://gothamist.com/tags/santacon">SantaCon</a>, the annual tradition of drinking while under the influence of being jolly, has begun! The day-long Santa pub crawl/food drive <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130515165822/http://nycsantacon.com/">just kicked off at</a> 10 a.m. this morning. Holiday-attired participants are asked to bring two non-perishable food items to one of the two starting points: in Manhattan at the North Cove Marina at World Financial Center, and in Brooklyn at Brooklyn Bridge Park at the intersection of Old Fulton Street and Water Street. Here&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130515165822/http://nycsantacon.com/bk.png">the bar map for Brooklyn</a> (including DUMBO mainstays Rebar, Superfine, 68 Jay Street and Galapagos) and Merchants River House &amp; PJ Clarke&#x2019;s are open for Manhattan Santas. <strong>UPDATE BELOW</strong></p>

<p>You can follow along with all the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130515165822/https://twitter.com/#!/santacon">updates on the crawl here.</a> So get your frisky sugarplum gingerbread <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130515165822/http://nmcglynn.com/post/14014271023/santacon-has-begun-taken-with-instagram-at">costume on</a> (&quot;Anyone caught attending SantaCon without a FULL costume will be pelted with reindeer droppings and receive coal in their stocking.&quot;) and get out there for a day of mirthful drinking, charitable spirits, and falalucking walking. We&apos;ll have pictures from the event later today, but until then, let LeShawn the Elf get you in the SantaCon spirit:</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: As you can see from the picture of Grand Central above, SantaCon brought out hundreds of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130515165822/https://twitter.com/#!/bowerypresents/status/145634612213846016">&quot;drunken glassy-eyed&quot; Santa-suited revelers</a> today. The festivities caught the eye of everyone from Rachel Maddow (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130515165822/https://twitter.com/#!/maddow/status/145604121402163202">who tweeted</a>, &quot;Being caught out in the middle of #Santacon is making me feel under-festive. Also, sober.&quot;) to Kelly Cutrone (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130515165822/https://twitter.com/#!/peoplesrev/status/145618784022036480">who tweeted</a>, &quot;It&apos;s fun explaining to a 9 year old why there are 500 drunk Sanats on the street #santacon - #anothernynightmare&quot;). </p>

<p>We&apos;ll have lots of great photos of today&apos;s event&#x2014;taken by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130515165822/http://colormekatie.blogspot.com/">Katie Sokoler</a>&#x2014;tomorrow, but to tide you over until then, check out a video from Grand Central below:</p>
