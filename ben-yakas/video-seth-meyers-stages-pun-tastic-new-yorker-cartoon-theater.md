<p><em>New Yorker</em> editor David Remnick took a break from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161224135540/http://www.newyorker.com/contributors/david-remnick">absolutely killing it</a> lately to stop by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161224135540/http://gothamist.com/tags/sethmeyers"><em>Late Night with Seth Meyers</em></a> yesterday. And as has become custom during his visits, he helped Meyers stage some live re-enactments of <em>New Yorker</em> cartoons. You&apos;ll never think of clever jokes about anthropomorphic snowmen the same way again.</p>

<p>Remnick also listed the reasons he&apos;s not optimistic about Trump&apos;s presidency: &quot;If it turns out Donald Trump is the greatest Republican since Lincoln, I&apos;ll be thrilled!&quot; Remnick noted. &quot;I don&apos;t think it&apos;s going to be the case. Everything that he campaigned on, everything that I&apos;ve seen during this transition...really doesn&apos;t portend well.&quot; Come for the pessimistic realism, stay for the stark reminder that we&apos;re all gonna <em>really</em> miss Obama in six months. </p>

<p>In a separate segment, &quot;Tweetin&apos; With The Prez,&quot; Meyers took a closer look at Trump&apos;s Twitter feed, which he&apos;s been using &quot;as his version of FDR&apos;s fireside chats,&quot; assuming FDR used his fireside chats to trash talk Mexicans. </p>
