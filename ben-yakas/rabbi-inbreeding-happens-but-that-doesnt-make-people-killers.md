<p>Yesterday, the lawyer for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170326032200/http://gothamist.com/tags/leviaron">Levi Aron</a>, the man who confessed to killing and dismembering 8-year-old Hasidic boy Leiby Kletzky this past fall, stirred up controversy when <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170326032200/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/21/levi_aron_insanity_defense_blame_it.php">he unveiled his defense strategy</a>, blaming Aron&apos;s alleged insanity on a childhood head injury, schizophrenia, and most contentiously, inbreeding. While lawyer Howard Greenberg was chastised by Assemblyman Dov Hikind for &quot;degrading to our entire community,&#x201D; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170326032200/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/inbred_outrage_94xSKANEEIE5BmhY4Z1rCJ?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">one rabbi told the Post that</a> inbreeding wasn&apos;t uncommon amongst Orthodox Jews...but that still doesn&apos;t mean they grow up to be killers: &#x201C;There are thousands of [married] people in the community who are related and there&#x2019;s no problem. It&#x2019;s preposterous to say that because there&#x2019;s a possibility of his parents being related, [Aron] would be crazy,&#x201D; said Rabbi Bernard Freilich.</p>

<p>Freilich, a community leader in Borough Park and other Orthodox neighborhoods, questioned whether Aron&apos;s siblings, Rocky and Joe, showed any signs of trauma themselves: &#x201C;Aren&#x2019;t there other children in [Aron&#x2019;s] household? Are they nuts?&#x201D; Greenberg <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170326032200/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2011/12/21/lawyer-for-accused-killer-levi-aron-says-inbreeding-partially-to-blame-for-crime/">brought up the allegations</a> of inbreeding in multiple interviews yesterday: &quot;Look, everybody knows when blood relations have offspring, there can be genetic defects,&quot; he said. It&apos;s something that needs to be investigated down to the ground.&quot; He added, &quot;That&apos;s an aspect of his familial history.&quot;</p>

<p>Hikind, who represents Borough Park and has contact with the Kletzky family, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170326032200/http://www.wsbt.com/news/wpix-levi-aron-hasidic-jewish-retardation-excuse,0,789306.story">was appalled at</a> the suggestion of inbreeding: &#x201C;This lawyer is simply out of his freaking mind. He&#x2019;s a sick, self-hating Jew who&#x2019;s making a mockery of this case. It&#x2019;s insulting and degrading to our entire community. He&#x2019;s a perfect match for Levi Aron.&#x201D;</p>

<p>In addition to the inbreeding claims, Greenberg said that Aron suffered head trauma when he fell off a bike about the age of 10, and that he is a diagnosed schizophrenic&#x2014;previously, Aron was found to have a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170326032200/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/10/accused_child_murderer_levi_aron_ha.php">personality disorder</a>, but a judge ruled that he was nevertheless <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170326032200/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/04/child_murder_suspect_found_fit_for.php">mentally fit to strand trial</a>. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170326032200/http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/150996#.TvOF2SNSTKA">Greenberg also thinks</a> Aron&apos;s initial confession can&apos;t be counted: &quot;My opinion is this guy would admit he shot Kennedy if you spent enough time with him,&quot; Greenberg said. He also is staking his reputation on getting Aron an insanity plea: &quot;You can quote me on this. I will quit the practice of criminal law if Levi Aron is not found insane.&quot;</p>
