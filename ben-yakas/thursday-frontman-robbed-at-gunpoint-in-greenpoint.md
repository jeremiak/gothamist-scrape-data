<p>Geoffrey Rickly, the frontman of the band Thursday, says he was robbed at gunpoint in Greenpoint on Tuesday. The 34-year-old musician <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130807024045/https://twitter.com/GeoffRickly">recounted the whole experience on Twitter</a>, saying the attackers held him up at gunpoint near the subway, and took his &quot;iPad, iPhone, passport, wallet, cards, rent money in cash (long story).&quot; They also took his epilepsy medication. And then they <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130807024045/https://twitter.com/steveclifford/status/342140134424195072/photo/1">uploaded a photo of themselves</a> on Instagram (see above right). </p>

Unexpected, unsolicited,&#x201D; he tweeted.</p>

<p>We&apos;ve contacted Rickly to get more details about the incident, and will update. In the meantime, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130807024045/https://twitter.com/GeoffRickly/status/342041609946423296">he tweeted</a>, &quot;Thank you for the well-wishes. Still love you, New York. Still hate you, guns. Friends, love you X10. No $. No phone. Can&apos;t steal sunshine...&quot;</p>
