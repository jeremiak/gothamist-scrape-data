<p>This week, a 25-year-old comedian was struck by a train after she slipped and fell on the platform while texting and walking. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429091414/http://gothamist.com/2014/02/15/comedian_struck_by_train_after_text.php">Liza Dye is currently recovering</a> at Bellevue Hospital, but she suffered a serious leg injury. And now her friends in the comedy community are banding together to try to raise money to pay for her hospital expenses. </p>

<p>&quot;She&apos;s in good spirits, but her left leg is in pretty bad shape and doctors expect an extended hospital stay,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429091414/http://www.youcaring.com/medical-fundraiser/help-liza-dye/139438">reads the Help Liza Dye page</a>. &quot;Liza&apos;s in need of donations to cover her medical expenses. She has no health insurance and costs are very high.&quot; The Upright Citizens Brigade Theater, where Dye often performs, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429091414/http://east.ucbtheatre.com/shows/view/3797">will host a benefit tonight</a> featuring Josh Gondelman, Joe List, Sam Morrill, Nore Davis and more; The Stand will also host a fundraiser on March 5th featuring Janeane Garofalo, Amanda Seales, Pete Lee, Charla Lauriston and more. You can also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429091414/http://www.youcaring.com/medical-fundraiser/help-liza-dye/139438">donate directly to this page.</a></p>

The train operator thankfully saw her fall and activated the emergency brake, but the first car rolled over her, injuring her legs. She&apos;s since made some light-hearted tweets about her recovery from the hospital, including a video of her getting morphine.</p>
