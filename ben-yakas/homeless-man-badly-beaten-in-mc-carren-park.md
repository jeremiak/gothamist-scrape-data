<p>A homeless man was reportedly beaten up in McCarren Park early Tuesday morning. According <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427145807/http://awalkintheparknyc.blogspot.com/2012/10/homeless-man-attacked-in-mccarren-park.html">to A Walk In The Park</a>, the incident happened around 4 a.m. on the edge of Patrolman Stephen Gilroy Memorial Field, near the bathrooms between Driggs and Bedford Avenue. They believe the man was struck in the head with a bottle.</p>

<p>After the attack, the man was able to stumble out of the park, and walk one block before collapsing in front of Dunkin&apos; Donuts on the corner of Bedford and Manhattan Avenues. FDNY confirmed that the man was taken to Bellevue Hospital instead of a local hospital; officials described him as being in serious condition with head trauma, and other sources told Walk In The Park he was bleeding profusely. We contacted NYPD to get any updated details on the victim, but they claimed to have no information available about the attack.</p>

<p>Back in July, a 16-year-old <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427145807/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/11/teen_brutally_beaten_stabbed_while.php">was savagely beaten and nearly stabbed to death</a> by a group of teens while walking home through McCarren Park. At the time, Geoffery Croft of the NYC Parks Advocates <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427145807/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/12/teen_speaks_about_getting_beaten_wi.php">blasted the city for lying about</a> the level of parks enforcement in city parks: &quot;Despite what the Parks Department says, there&apos;s not a single park enforcement officer available for patrol in Brooklyn. They&apos;re not out in parks patrolling, like a beat cop. They&apos;ve lost 42% of their officers since 2008, and the remaining ones are assigned to beaches and pools.&quot;</p>
