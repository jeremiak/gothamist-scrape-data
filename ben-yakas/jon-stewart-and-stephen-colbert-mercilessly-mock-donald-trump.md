<p>Yesterday, combover enthusiast <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131216084706/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/24/video_donald_trumps_big_october_sur.php">Donald Trump</a> finally revealed his highly anticipated &quot;October Surprise&quot;...which turned out to be a plea for people across America <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131216084706/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/24/video_donald_trumps_big_october_sur.php">to &quot;look at me, dear God why won&apos;t you look at me??!?&quot;</a> Both Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert took a few minutes out of their shows to eviscerate Trump and his Birther paranoia, starting with Stewart, who showed a clip of Trump&apos;s announcement: &quot;I&apos;m sorry, that wasn&apos;t Donald Trump essentially trying to publicly extort the President of the United States. That was a gorilla eating its own shit.&quot; Watch below.</p>

<p>Colbert was able to get to the bottom of why Trump put a Halloween deadline on his charitable extortion: &quot;He&apos;s renting out his enormous orange head as a jack-o-lantern.&quot; But he one-upped Trump with his own can&apos;t refuse offer: &quot;I am so moved by this generous offer that I have an offer of my own. Mr. Trump,  I will write you a check for $1 million from Colbert SuperPAC&#x2014;you know I&apos;ve got it&#x2014;to the charity of your choice. Save the children, feed the children, put the children on <em>Child Apprentice</em>, whatever...if you will let me dip my balls in your mouth.&quot; All of America is eagerly awaiting your response, Mr. Trump.</p>
