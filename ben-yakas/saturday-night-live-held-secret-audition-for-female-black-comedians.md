<p>One of the ongoing storylines of this transitionary season of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422202450/http://gothamist.com/tags/SNL"><em>Saturday Night Live</em></a> has been the lack of diversity amongst the new cast members. After losing Bill Hader, Fred Armisen, and Jason Sudekis, the show brought six new faces on board as featured players&#x2014;except all six are white, and only one is female. But the show has been trying to respond to the criticisms both <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422202450/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/03/videos_saturday_night_live_3.php#photo-1">on air</a> and behind-the-scenes: it seems SNL held a secret audition last week specifically for female black comedians.</p>

<p>Actress <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422202450/https://twitter.com/Breshawebb">Bresha Webb</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422202450/http://thejasminebrand.com/2013/12/11/exclusive-actress-bresha-webb-talks-about-snls-black-women-showcase-audition-we-were-all-honored/">told the Jasmine BRAND</a> about the showcase, which was held at LA&#x2019;s Groundlings Theater: &quot;The audition came about from an inside source from SNL. I don&#x2019;t think any of us had a clue about the showcase until two days prior. It was an awesome opportunity even though it was such a short notice but, if you stay ready you ain&#x2019;t gotta get ready and we were READY! Lol But we were all honored to be selected.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I found out that I was on a list of funny women in the industry and there was an opportunity for me to audition for SNL last summer,&quot; Webb added, &quot;but, I was filming &#x201C;Love that Girl&#x201D; and now the opportunity has represented itself.&quot; Other comedians trying out included <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422202450/https://twitter.com/TiffanyHaddish">Tiffany Haddish</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422202450/https://twitter.com/simoneshepherd">Simonne Shepherd</a>, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422202450/https://twitter.com/DarmirraBrunson">Darmirra Brunson.</a></p>

<p>With <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422202450/http://gothamist.com/tags/sethmeyers">Seth Meyers</a> leaving the show for Late Night soon, it&apos;s entirely plausible the show could bring one more featured player on for the second half of the season in 2014. And then maybe we won&apos;t have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422202450/http://gothamist.com/2013/12/08/videos_paul_rudd_gets_snl_assist_fr.php#photo-8">sketches like this anymore.</a></p>
