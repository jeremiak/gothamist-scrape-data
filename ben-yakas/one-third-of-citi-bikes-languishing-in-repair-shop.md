<p>One-third of all <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140825191832/http://gothamist.com/tags/citibike">Citi Bikes</a> are reportedly languishing in a Brooklyn warehouse waiting for some much-needed repairs that may or may not ever come. Considering the fact that all the other Citi Bikes have been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140825191832/http://gothamist.com/2014/07/30/photo_mutilated_citi_bike_turns_up.php">mutilated</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140825191832/http://gothamist.com/2014/07/31/citi_bike_long_island.php">kidnapped</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140825191832/http://gothamist.com/2014/07/25/queens_cops_arrest_man_riding_citi.php">repainted</a>, or incorporated into <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140825191832/http://gothamist.com/2014/08/21/video_cop_cant_dock_citi_bike.php">a Keystone Cops routine</a>, this might explain why your local docking station has been a bit thin recently.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140825191832/http://nypost.com/2014/08/23/nearly-a-third-of-citi-bike-bicycles-stuck-in-repair-shop/">The Post reports that</a> lead mechanic Timur Mukhodinov told the National Labor Relations Board that approximately 1,900 of the 6,000 bikes are waiting to be fixed. &quot;[W]e don&#x2019;t know if [the bicycles in the warehouse needing repair] will ever meet zero, because that&#x2019;s something that&#x2019;s fueled by the users every single day,&quot; Mukhodinov said in the documents.</p>

<p>Someone might be using <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140825191832/http://gothamist.com/2014/08/19/citibike_math.php">sci-fi math</a> to crunch those numbers, according to Citi Bike spokeswoman Dani Simons; she disputed the figure slightly, saying there are just under 1,200 bikes in the repair shop (and adding that an average of 200 are repaired a day). <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140825191832/http://gothamist.com/2014/07/17/citi_bikes_abandoned_in_brooklyn.php">Earlier this year</a>, Alta Bicycle Share suffered some &quot;seasonal downsizing&quot; of repair workers whose job it is to maintain the bikes and docks. As a result, Citi Bike&apos;s rates of repair and maintenance <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140825191832/http://gothamist.com/2014/03/24/citi_bike_3.php">reportedly dropped precipitously.</a></p>

<p>As for what&apos;s wrong with the bikes, you might want to pay attention to where you place your butt next time you hop on one: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140825191832/http://bikesharenyc.blogspot.com/2014/08/follow-our-advice-or-you-stand-68.html">BikeshareNYC inspected bikes</a> at 24 stations around the Financial District this month  and found that 68 percent of them had cracked seats.</p>
