<p>Finally, we have a reason to emerge from our sanctuaries of brick, plywood and air conditioning to do our business in the park: the city <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150521014748/http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-06-09/at-t-to-offer-free-wi-fi-internet-access-in-new-york-city-parks.html">announced today</a> that 20 parks throughout the five boroughs will all be getting free public Wi-Fi. While we&apos;re quite excited at the prospect, we worry that Chuck Schumer might not be too happy <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150521014748/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/28/schumer_wifi_provides_smorgasboard.php">about this one</a>.</p>

<p>You can see more information about the project, including locations of each of the parks, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150521014748/http://www.nycgovparks.org/sub_your_park/wifi/">here</a>. The initiative runs for several years and will be free for all users, Dallas-based AT&amp;T; told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150521014748/http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-06-09/at-t-to-offer-free-wi-fi-internet-access-in-new-york-city-parks.html">Bloomberg News</a>. So will people flock to parks with their computers now? Will this affect business at Starbucks and local coffee shops? And most importantly, will we even ever be able to go outside again without staining our shirts with sweat?</p>
