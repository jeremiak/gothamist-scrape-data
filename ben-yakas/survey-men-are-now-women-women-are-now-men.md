<p>A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405232157/http://yourlife.usatoday.com/sex-relationships/dating/story/2011/02/Men-women-flip-the-script-in-gender-expectation/43219110/1">new survey</a> of single Americans has discovered that men are clingy and mushy, and women are cold and aloof, when it comes to dating and relationships. And genders are essentially meaningless at this point! &quot;<strong>Men are now expressing some traditionally female attitudes, while women are adopting some of those long attributed to men</strong>,&quot; says biological anthropologist Helen Fisher, a research professor at Rutgers University, a &quot;scientific adviser for a division of Match.com&quot;, and one of the developers of the survey. </p>

<p>Some of their findings: men fall in love quicker than women and single men are more likely to want children than single women; and women want more independence than men in their relationships (personal space is &quot;very important&quot;). Men are more desirous for commitments and serious relationships, while women think random hookups can be relationship starters. We have yet to meet someone who doesn&apos;t have some sort of &quot;crazy&quot; when it comes to relationships, so maybe we shouldn&apos;t all follow one prescribed gender-normative role. At the same time, at least this survey helps explain why we&apos;ve been ovulating so much lately.</p>
