<p>The incident happened around 8:45 a.m. this morning when a fight broke out between two women aboard a 2 train as it pulled into the Central Park North station at 110th Street near Lenox Avenue. That&apos;s when people started running out of the station, as you can tell from the flurry of tweets below.</p>

<p>The MTA confirmed that there were &quot;reports of gun shots&quot; on the train, but it turned out &quot;they were unfounded.&quot; Instead, it seems that in the midst of the two women fighting, two kids on the train thought it was the perfect time to set off some firecrackers.</p>

<p>&quot;[Two women] were arguing,&quot; straphanger Billy Mitchell <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016131227/http://nypost.com/2016/06/21/firecrackers-spark-stampede-on-nyc-subway/">told The Post</a>. &quot;I was about to enter the train [and] somebody let off two firecrackers. It was two kids, they lit off firecrackers and everybody ran. The firecracker sounded like a gunshot &#x2026; So people panicked and they pushed each other. They trampled on everyone and a lot of people got injured.&quot;</p>

<p>At least three people suffered minor injuries during the incident. Police added that no arrests have been made, and the investigation is ongoing.</p>
