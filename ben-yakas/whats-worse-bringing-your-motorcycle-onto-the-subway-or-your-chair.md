<p>This summer has seen an explosion in poor <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150328003719/http://gothamist.com/tags/subwayetiquette">subway etiquette</a>, including <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150328003719/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/01/yeah_thats_it_kick_off_your_sandals.php">sandal-less fools</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150328003719/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/02/subway_etiquette_photo.php">oblivious gamers</a> stretching their feet along benches, people transporting <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150328003719/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/30/sure_why_not_use_the_l_train_to_tra.php">giant unwrapped mattresses</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150328003719/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/06/subway_poles_make_great_bike_racks.php">bike racks</a>, and, um, that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150328003719/http://gothamist.com/tags/subwayshark">whole shark thing</a>. Today, we bring you a Sophie&apos;s Choice of bad subway behavior: is it worse to bring your motorcycle onto the subway, or a big chair?</p>

<p>To give a little context: the photo on the right, which was posted by TheFuturist47 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150328003719/http://www.reddit.com/r/nyc/comments/1k3869/right_after_i_took_this_the_train_got_very/">on Reddit</a>, was taken on the L train at 6th Avenue. And even though it looks pretty barren here, the uploader writes that the train got packed after the next stop at Union Square. Even if it took up precious space in the middle of the car, the uploader found the silver lining: &quot;Yeah to be honest I love how &quot;fuck you&quot; he was about it. We were cracking up. He was pretty badass.&quot;</p>

<p>As for motorcycle man, tipster Pedro Zevallos told us he spotted him on an uptown 2/3 train. &quot;I got on at Grand Central and got off at 96th and the guy with the moto was on the train when I got on. No one said anything to him. In fact, everyone acted like it was totally normal, including myself.&quot; We were hoping for something a bit more dramatic, like a helicopter explosion or something.</p>
