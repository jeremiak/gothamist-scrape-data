Hashtags! Modes of transportation!</i></div> <p></p>

<p>There comes a point in The Writer&apos;s life when they must look themselves in the mirror <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509165623/http://www.wordsonimages.com/photo?id=103055-Ernest+hemingway+novelist+a+se">and ask</a>, &quot;Am I a buzzard, or a hawk, or a popinjay, or am I a bloody owl?&quot; But maybe The Writer is none of those things&#x2014;maybe The Writer was actually a well-ventilated business class train car the whole time. If you think you may fall into the latter category, then Amtrak has got quite the offer for you.</p>

<p>Starting today, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509165623/http://blog.amtrak.com/2014/03/amtrak-residency-for-writers/">you can now apply</a> for Amtrak&apos;s all-new free writer&apos;s residency program. &quot;#AmtrakResidency was designed to allow creative professionals who are passionate about train travel and writing to work on their craft in an inspiring environment,&quot; they write on their website. &quot;Round-trip train travel will be provided on an Amtrak long-distance route. Each resident will be given a private sleeper car, equipped with a desk, a bed and a window to watch the American countryside roll by for inspiration. Routes will be determined based on availability.&quot;</p>

<p>Up to 24 writers will be selected for the program, starting March 17, 2014 through March 31, 2015; residences will last 2-5 days, and all applications should be in by March 31st. The only requirement they say is a &quot;passion for writing and an aspiration to travel with Amtrak for inspiration,&quot; but you&apos;ll have to include a writing sample, and you better have some sort of Twitter presence (&quot;extensive social media connections&quot;). It&apos;s unclear whether food will be included, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509165623/http://www.thewire.com/culture/2014/03/amtrak-residency-writers-now-accepting-applications/358965/">The Wire&apos;s Sara Morrison writes</a> that she traveled in an Amtrak sleeper car last year and &quot;meals were included as part of the ticket. A ticket that I, like an idiot, paid for. If only I had known!&quot;</p>

<p>You can read all about how the residency program went from a throwaway comment in Alexander Chee&#x2019;s interview <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509165623/http://www.pen.org/interview/pen-ten-alexander-chee">in Pen America</a> (&#x201C;I still like a train best for [writing]. I wish Amtrak had residencies for writers&#x201D;) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509165623/http://www.thewire.com/culture/2014/02/inside-amtraks-absolutely-awesome-plan-give-free-rides-writers/358332/">and was turned into reality here.</a> Jessica Gross, one of the first people to tweet about the idea, was given the opportunity to try it out on a &quot;test run,&quot; and wrote about her experience <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509165623/http://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2014/02/19/writing-the-lake-shore-limited/">for The Paris Review.</a> </p>
