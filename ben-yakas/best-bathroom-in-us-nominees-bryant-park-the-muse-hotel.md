</div></div>					<p>Man&apos;s right to an accessible, respectable bathroom in this city is sacred, as seemingly undeniable as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150511170635/http://dinersjournal.blogs.nytimes.com/2006/08/29/out-and-about-sapori-dischia/">asking</a> for tap water at a restaurant. Back in the winter, the tension over bathroom rights even brought the entire street vendors <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150511170635/http://gothamist.com/2010/02/24/street_vendors_stand_up_bathroom_ri.php">industry</a> to a halt briefly. So in comparison, the search for the <em>best</em> toilets seems practically quixotic, the luxury of those who already <em>have</em>. Nevertheless, one website has been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150511170635/http://www.bestrestroom.com/us/vote.asp">searching for</a> and awarding the &quot;most unique, impressive&quot; bathrooms in the US for the last eight years. </p>

<p>Two NYC bathrooms have been nominated this year: the public restroom at Bryant Park, and the one in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150511170635/http://www.themusehotel.com/">The Muse Hotel</a> in Times Square. Bryant Park, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150511170635/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/18/the_seach_for_the.php">already considered</a> one of the cleanest public bathrooms in the city, is decorated with fresh flowers, wood and marble, while patrons are treated to individual washrooms at Muse, each featuring customized fixtures, marble, and mosaic tiles. </p>
