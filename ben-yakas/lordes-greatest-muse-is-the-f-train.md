<p>Random <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171026142919/http://gothamist.com/tags/subwaycelebrities">subway celebrity</a> sightings are a dime a dozen in this city, whether it&apos;s Tom Hanks <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171026142919/http://gothamist.com/2015/01/23/tom_hanks_thinks_hes_people.php">Hankspreading on the 1 train</a>, Michael Cera rubbing his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171026142919/http://gothamist.com/2015/03/25/nyc_is_michael_ceras_doormat.php">shoes all over the pole,</a> or Dame Helen Mirren showing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171026142919/http://gothamist.com/2015/01/31/photo_dame_helen_mirren_demonstrate.php">exemplary subway etiquette</a> on the R train. There are a few exceptional celebrities though, the ones every New Yorker thinks they&apos;ve ridden with, like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171026142919/http://gothamist.com/2015/02/26/kevin_bacon_subway.php">Kevin Bacon</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171026142919/http://gothamist.com/2014/11/21/gyllenhaal_every_subway.php">Jake Gyllenhaal</a>, who has been cursed to eat bagels off the floor of the subway for eternity. We are proud to formally declare <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171026142919/http://gothamist.com/tags/lorde">Lorde</a> an exceptional subway celebrity, but because she is the inverse of Bacon and Gyllenhaal: you&apos;ve probably ridden with her on the subway <em>without even realizing it</em>.</p>

<p>In the buildup to the release of her sophomore album <em>Melodrama</em>, Lorde has been on a charm offensive regaling various publications with tales of her subway exploits. This weekend, she&apos;ll appear on an episode of CBS Sunday Morning, where she&apos;ll be riding the train with Anthony Mason. She told him much of the album was written while riding the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171026142919/http://gothamist.com/tags/ftrain">F train</a>. &quot;I thanked the subway in my album notes. Because I wouldn&#x2019;t have been able to make the record without it,&quot; Lorde says <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171026142919/https://www.cbspressexpress.com/cbs-news/releases/view?id=47972">in the segment</a>. &quot;I found it such an amazing space to kind of be around people.&#x201D; </p>

<p>In May, she <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171026142919/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/lordes-growing-pains-pop-outsider-talks-melodrama-w482136">told Rolling Stone</a> about her habits while writing the album:</p>

<blockquote>Outside the studio, Lorde often kept to herself. She stayed in a &quot;bizarre businessman hotel - just me and conferences,&quot; she says. &quot;In a lot of ways I felt like a little monk, drifting down into the subway, being very solitary and just thinking about the music all the time and not really socializing very much. Every once in a while, a sweet little NYU student would come up to me and say some lovely thing, but really I felt like I was able to lose touch with myself as a person of note, which is a really valuable thing. By the end, this part of my life, this part that we&apos;re doing right now, all of this felt very abstract.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>The most extensive information about Lorde&apos;s subway habits came <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171026142919/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/12/magazine/the-return-of-lorde.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Fmagazine">in a NY Times Magazine cover story</a>, which included a lot of quotes about how much she enjoys not being recognized in public (&quot;No one cares about me.&quot;): </p>

<blockquote>We pushed through the service exit, walked along empty streets and boarded an uptown 1 train. While making <em>Melodrama,</em> Lorde took lots of subway rides, auditioning rough mixes of songs on cheap earbuds, which helped give her a sense of how the music would sound in daily life. As we rumbled northward, her face was in full fluorescent light, and I wondered if people ever bothered her during these rides. &#x201C;Nobody recognizes me,&#x201D; she said. When Lorde does spot someone spotting her, she went on, her move is to smile, place a finger to her lips and mouth a conspiratorial shh. Her thinking is that this gesture, warm and direct in its appeal, will pre-empt any further encounter &#x2014; &#x201C;and it usually does.&#x201D;</blockquote>

<p>There&apos;s also this little scene, which took place at a diner near Columbus Circle called the Flame. Suffice to say, not only have you unknowingly travelled with Lorde on the subway&#x2014;she&apos;s probably jotted down something you said (assuming you said something interesting):</p>

<blockquote>Part of the reason Lorde likes traveling unnoticed in New York is that she enjoys paying close attention to strangers&#x2019; conversations. &#x201C;I&#x2019;ll overhear a phrase and roll it around in my mind for hours,&#x201D; she said. Sometimes it isn&#x2019;t a phrase that ensnares her but a tableau. At one point during our meal, she broke off midsentence and drew my gaze to an older couple one table over. The man, who had a plastic ballpoint pen clipped to his belt, was holding up a takeout box. His companion was slowly filling it with uneaten French fries from her plate, one tiny fork-nudge at a time. Neither spoke, but there were soft, birdlike squeaks as the china rubbed against the plastic foam. Lorde looked back at me and put a hand to her heart.</blockquote>

<p>And in case you&apos;re wondering: yes, Lorde is fully aware that the F train <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171026142919/http://gothamist.com/2017/06/06/harrowing_a_f_train_video_nightmare.php">is now the poster child</a> for our never-ending waking infrastructure nightmare. Love is love.</p>

<p>Now I just want to know whether her stance on the <em>other</em> Subway is still as strong as it once was.</p>
