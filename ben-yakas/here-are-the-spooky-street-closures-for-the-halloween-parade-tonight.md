<p>The guy who founded the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161103093008/http://gothamist.com/tags/halloweenparade">Village Halloween Parade</a> may be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161103093008/http://nypost.com/2016/10/29/the-founder-of-nycs-halloween-parade-fears-he-created-a-beast/">boycotting it</a> this year (&quot;It just isn&#x2019;t the same&quot;), but that&apos;s not going to stop you from donning your finest Harley Quinn and/or Eleven and/or David S. Pumpkins costume (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161103093008/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/31/best_halloween_subway_costume.php#photo-1">these are the only options</a>) and heading down for the annual night of reasonably slow walking.
