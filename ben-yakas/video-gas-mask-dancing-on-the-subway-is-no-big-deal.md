<p>We like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150310065823/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/23/video_experimental_documentary_of_n.php">weird videos</a> of NYC almost as much as we love <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150310065823/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/01/new_yorkers_really_like_their_weird.php">weird pets.</a> In that spirit, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150310065823/http://animalnewyork.com/2011/07/creepy-dance-crew-doesnt-phase-nyc-metro-riders/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+animalnewyork+%28ANIMAL%29&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader">AnimalNY pointed us</a> toward the below music video for King Bones &amp; DJ Aaron&apos;s &quot;Finger Food,&quot; in which two shirtless men in gas masks perform a series of elastic, snake-like dance moves on the subway platform set to a hypnotizing, pulsing song...but it doesn&apos;t seem like a very big deal to anyone who notices them. The video has finally inspired us to try out our <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150310065823/http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/clips/p00bc6bp/the_office_the_david_brent_dance/">David Brent dance</a> next time we&apos;re on the L.
