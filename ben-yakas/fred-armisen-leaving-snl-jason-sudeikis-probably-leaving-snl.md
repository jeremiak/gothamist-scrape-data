<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150325052719/http://gothamist.com/tags/saturdaynightlive"><em>Saturday Night Live</em></a> exodus continues: the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150325052719/http://www.nypost.com/p/entertainment/sos_snl_qlRUco4bhC8GDTfPKl05SP">NY Post reports that</a> Fred Armisen will be leaving the show at the end of the season, and Jason Sudeikis will &quot;probably&quot; leave the show as well. Armisen, who has been on the show for 11 seasons, can focus on <em>Portlandia</em> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150325052719/http://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/fred-armisen-tries-on-google-glass-for-real/">wearing Google Glass</a> full time now; Sudeikis will likely enjoy a healthy post-SNL career filled with straight-man film roles and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150325052719/http://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/olivia-wilde-jason-sudeikis-and-i-have-sex-like-kenyan-marathon-runners-2012910">marathon sexing.</a> </p>

<p>Check out two of the best sketches featuring Armisen and Sudeikis this season above and below. In addition to those two, Bill Hader <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150325052719/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/14/bill_hader_is_leaving_saturday_nigh.php">also announced earlier this week</a> that he will be leaving the show after this weekend&apos;s Ben Affleck/Kanye West season finale. Seth Meyers, who recently was chosen to take over <em>Late Night</em> when Jimmy Fallon moves to <em>The Tonight Show</em>, will leave after the fall. </p>

<p>So what does this mean for the show? It means Kenan Thompson is now the longest-running cast member, followed by Bobby Moynihan. It means we mercifully may never have to see &quot;The Californians&quot; again. It means Kate McKinnon is poised to be the next breakout star. And best of all&#x2014;although we are loathe to lose the anchors of the show, especially Hader&#x2014;it means SNL needs to find some serious new talent quick, which is just what the show needs right now. </p>

<p>But it might be a rough year ahead as the new cast tries to congeal: &#x201C;It takes like a year to have a new cast work on characters and the audience has to learn people&#x2019;s names, which is harder than it seems,&#x201D; said Michael Schur, who wrote for &#x201C;SNL&#x201D; from 1998-2004. At least we know there are plenty of talented funny folk out there just <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150325052719/http://www.buzzfeed.com/lukelewis/that-time-dan-brown-recorded-a-song-about-phone-sex?utm_campaign=socialflow&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=buzzfeed">waiting for their chance to prove they&apos;ve got what it takes.</a></p>
