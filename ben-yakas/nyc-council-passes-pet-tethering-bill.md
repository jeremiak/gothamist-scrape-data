<p>Last month, Councilman Peter Vallone <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160312214539/http://gothamist.com/2010/12/18/new_dog_bill_would_put_three_hour_l.php">introduced</a> a bill that would bar pet owners from tethering their animals outside for longer than three hours in a continuous 12-hour period. Today, New York City Council <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160312214539/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local/new_york&amp;id=7905480">passed</a> the &quot;tethering bill&quot; 47-1, which will now prohibit a pet from being tethered for more than three hours, as well as prohibit the use of a tether that is too heavy, choke or pinch collars, or one that would become entangled. Owners face $250 fine for first violations, and $500 fine or three months in jail for repeat offenses. </p>

<p>&quot;This chain is now embedded into this dog&apos;s skin,&quot; Council Speaker Christine Quinn said. Vallone added that he expected the law will be &quot;complaint driven.&quot; We know <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160312214539/http://gothamist.com/2010/12/22/joan_rivers_supports.php">one person</a> who will be very happy at the fortunate turn of events for bitches across the city.</p>
