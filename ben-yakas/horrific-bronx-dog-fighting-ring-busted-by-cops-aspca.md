<p>Forty-seven dogs were saved after police and ASPCA workers busted a Bronx dog-fighting ring from the basement of a Bronx apartment building yesterday. Building super Raul Sanchez, 57, is accused of being the ringleader of the operation, and has been arrested on animal fighting and cruelty charges. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s pretty horrific inside &#x2014; horrible conditions. I couldn&#x2019;t even describe it,&#x201D; NYPD Deputy Inspector Anthony Favale <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150306100945/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20120621/morrisania/police-bust-dog-fighting-ring-bronx">told reporters.</a> &#x201C;The dogs appear to be in various stages of abuse and injury.&#x201D;</p>

<p>The bust happened at 1254 Sherman Avenue, a six-story apartment building in the Bronx. Altogether, 47 pit bulls ranging in age from 12 weeks to five years were rescued. The ASPCA said they were living in a windowless basement, which included a makeshift arena with estimated capacity for 100 spectators. Among the items confiscated included dog treadmills, harnesses, muzzles, syringes, and a shopping cart full of raw chicken parts.</p>

<p>&#x201C;Organized dog fighting is a brutal form of animal abuse where dogs are exploited and forced to fight as their owners profit from their torture,&#x201D; said Howard Lawrence, senior director of operations for the ASPCA&#x2019;s Humane Law Enforcement department. &#x201C;The dogs we saw today exhibited scarring and injuries consistent with fighting dogs. The ASPCA is determined to protect New York City&apos;s animals from this form of cruelty.&#x201D;</p>

<p>They also said that some of the dogs had never even been outside before: &quot;Those white marks on their faces, those are all scars,&quot; Lawrence added. &quot;They may not have seen the light of day, perhaps even since they were born.&quot;<br>
