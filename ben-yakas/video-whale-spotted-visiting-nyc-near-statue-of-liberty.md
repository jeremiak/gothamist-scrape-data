<p>Tourism is at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031013604/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/09/tourists_are_swarming_this_city_lik.php">an all-time high</a> in NYC, and that&apos;s true for our waterways as well: a humpback whale was spotted doing laps around Liberty Island this morning by the Coast Guard. An Instagram user was able to capture the whale, whom he nicknamed &quot;Fudgey&quot; (after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031013604/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rS6ki8D7zQA">the famous Carvel ice cream cake</a>), in the video below.</p>

<p>The Coast Guard sent out an alert about the whale around 8 a.m. Thursday. &quot;We&#x2019;ve seen lots and lots of whales all summer long and have even seen them recently along Rockaway Beach and the Jersey Shore,&quot; Paul Sieswerda of Gotham Whale, which tracks marine life in the area, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031013604/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/whale-statue-liberty-prompting-coast-guard-warning-article-1.2877300?utm_content=buffer5c38a&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=NYDailyNewsTw">told the News</a>. &quot;But it&#x2019;s rare to have them inside of New York Harbor.&quot;</p>

<p>He added, &quot;It was probably chasing fish inside the harbor and ended up staying there because that&#x2019;s where the fish are.&quot; </p>

<p>Even if the big guy is a little out-of-place, this is still nicer than the last couple <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031013604/http://gothamist.com/tags/whale">whale-sightings</a> we&apos;ve had: last summer, a handful of whale carcasses <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031013604/http://gothamist.com/2014/10/09/photos_dead_50-foot_whale_and_a_tur.php">washed up</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031013604/http://gothamist.com/2015/06/08/dead_whale_coney_island.php">on various</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031013604/http://gothamist.com/2016/07/28/dead_whale_jersey_city.php">local beaches.</a></p>
