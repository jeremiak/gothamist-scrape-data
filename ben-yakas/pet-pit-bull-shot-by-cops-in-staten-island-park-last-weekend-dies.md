<p>The pet pit bull <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427162032/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/07/family_and_vet_claims_cops_shot_inn.php">who was shot by cops over the weekend</a> after an incident in a Staten Island park <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427162032/http://www.snarrdogpolice.com/">has died</a>. Two-year-old Baby Girl <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427162032/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/10/video_animal_activists_show_support.php">had been in bad shape all week</a> since the shooting on Saturday. Doctors had given her a 50-50 chance at surviving her serious injuries, but unfortunately it was not to be.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427162032/https://www.facebook.com/pages/SNARR-Animal-Rescue-Northeast/191323577616180">S.N.A.R.R Animal Rescue Northeast</a>, the group that rescued Baby Girl before she was adopted, posted this update on Facebook today:</p>

<blockquote>We are devastated to post, but Baby Girl passed away this morning. The family is going to the vet now. At this point we don&apos;t know specifically the complications that happened. Thank you again to everyone for your support, donations and kind words. The family is upset beyond words and this girl will be dearly missed. RIP Baby Girl.</blockquote>

<p>Owner Patricia Ratz and her sister Kathleen Dixon brought their three pit bulls to Schmul Park in Travis around 1 p.m. on Saturday. Two of the dogs&#x2014;not Baby Girl&#x2014; started fighting, and Ratz stuck her hand in between them to try to break it up; one of them bit her, prompting a police response. Ratz <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427162032/http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2013/04/pit_bulls_owner_says_dog_was_c.html#incart_most-comments">told SI Live that</a> officer Julie Moschella and an officer in civilian clothing arrived moments after the fight and opened fire on Baby Girl, who was running away from them.</p>

<p>Police insisted initially that Baby Girl was the one who bit Ratz; they now say the matter is &quot;under investigation.&quot; According to the rescue group, the bullet hit seven sections of intestines and bowels. You can see a video of Baby Girl playing with her best friend, a rabbit, below.</p>
