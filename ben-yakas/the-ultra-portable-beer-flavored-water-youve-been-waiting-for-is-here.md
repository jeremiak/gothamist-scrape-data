<p>Maybe there is no such thing as a zombie apocalypse, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130519162746/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/01/extra_extra_2276.php">as the CDC claims</a>&#x2014;but even so, isn&apos;t it better to be prepared for some sort of cataclysmic event, just in case? And wouldn&apos;t you want to be able to drink something other than water if (and when) the civilized world comes to an end? Then look no further than <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130519162746/http://patsbcb.com/">Pat&apos;s Backcountry Beverages</a>&#x2014;a lightweight and portable way to make carbonated drinks like beer or soda out of a syrupy concentrate. Watch the video below to see the carbonating in action.</p>

<p>As <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130519162746/http://www.thegearcaster.com/the_gearcaster/2012/08/pats-backcountry-carbonated-beverages.html#more">The Gear Caster puts it</a>, the mixtures work kind of like Pop Rocks: once exposed to water (not included of course), the solid mixture dissolves, releasing carbon dioxide to be pumped into the drin. The first run of the beverages should be available by the end of August&#x2014;flavors include lemon/lime soda, root beer, ginger ale, and most interestingly, a pale ale. </p>

<p>Of course, there doesn&apos;t need to be a zombie apocalypse for lightweight and easy-to-make drinks to come in handy&#x2014;the beverage mixes are perfect for going camping and hiking, or hanging out at isolated areas like the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130519162746/http://gothamist.com/2012/08/09/mccarren_park_pool_looking_for_non-.php">food vendor-less</a> McCarren Pool Park.
