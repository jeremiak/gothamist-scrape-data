<p>Actress Diane Keaton has a new memoir coming out, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160219212523/http://www.amazon.com/Then-Again-Diane-Keaton/dp/1400068789">&quot;Then Again,&quot;</a> which dives into her close relationship with her mother, as well as her long term romance/friendship with the one and only <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160219212523/http://gothamist.com/tags/woodyallen">Woody Allen</a>. She writes that dating Allen was just like being in a Woody Allen movie...except sexier? <strong>&quot;He was even better-looking in real life. He had a great body, and he was physically very graceful,&quot;</strong> she wrote about ex-boyfriend <strike>Warren Beatty</strike> <strike>Al Pacino</strike> Woody Allen.</p>

<p>Keaton calls herself his endearing oaf, and says that when they first met in 1968, she had him &quot;pegged as a cross between a &apos;White Thing&apos; and the cockroach you couldn&apos;t kill.&quot; The book comes out November 15, and is excerpted in the November issue of Vogue, arriving at newsstands October 25&#x2014;but that story is lovingly excerpted by the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160219212523/http://shelf-life.ew.com/2011/10/20/diane-keaton-woody-allen-memoir/">Associated Press</a>, among other places. Thankfully, it seems their relationship remained strong even after their love affair flamed out in the mid-1970s: &quot;We shared a love of torturing each other with our failures. His insights into my character were dead-on and hilarious. This bond remains the core of our friendship and, for me, love.&quot;</p>

<p>Below, check out another quote from the book on Keaton falling in love with Allen when they worked together in Allen&apos;s stage comedy &quot;Play It Again, Sam:&quot;</p>

<blockquote>How could I not? I was in love with him before I knew him. He was Woody Allen. Our entire family used to gather around the TV set and watch him on Johnny Carson. He was so hip, with his thick glasses and cool suits,&quot; she writes. &quot;But it was his manner that got me, his way of gesturing, his hands, his coughing and looking down in a self-deprecating way while he told jokes like &apos;I couldn&apos;t get a date for New Year&apos;s Eve so I went home and I jumped naked into a vat of Roosevelt dimes.&apos;</blockquote>
