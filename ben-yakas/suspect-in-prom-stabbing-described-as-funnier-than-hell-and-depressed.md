<p>Friends, classmates and family members have all begun speaking out about the 16-year-old Connecticut high school student accused of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140429205937/http://gothamist.com/2014/04/25/high_school_student_fatally_stabbed_1.php">fatally stabbing a teenage girl</a> after she reportedly rejected his prom proposal. Suspect Chris Plaskon <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140429205937/http://gothamist.com/2014/04/26/friends_family_mourn_for_teen_fatal.php">has been charged</a> with the murder of classmate Maren Sanchez, who was stabbed just before 7 a.m. Friday at Jonathan Law High School in Milford, Connecticut. &quot;They&#x2019;re looking for the kid in the black cape and the fangs and the black fingernails, but there was no sign,&quot; Mark Robinson, who was Plaskon&#x2019;s football coach, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140429205937/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/27/nyregion/lawyer-for-suspect-in-connecticut-stabbing-says-his-client-will-likely-be-tried-as-an-adult.html?ref=nyregion&amp;_r=0">told the Times</a>. &quot;He wasn&#x2019;t a kid who was in the shadows. He was a well-liked kid. He was funnier than hell. That&#x2019;s what makes it really strange.&quot;</p>

<p>Others disagree, and say Plaskon was a troubled, depressed teen: &quot;He just wasn&apos;t right. I know his cousin. He didn&apos;t act right,&quot; 16-year-old Seamus O&#x2019;Reilly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140429205937/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2613894/Pictured-The-boy-16-stabbed-friend-death-refused-prom-going-boyfriend.html">told the Daily Mail</a>. &quot;He had depression.&quot; Tyler Curtin, who played on the football team with Plaskon, said he believed Plaskon struggled with mental illness, including cutting himself. &quot;He had ADHD and took strong medicine for it and had other things, too,&quot; he told the Daily Mail, adding that Plaskon may have tried to kill himself last year.</p>

<p>Many other classmates say Plaskon was a class clown always looking to make others laugh: &quot;Chris was always funny and happy. He made everyone laugh,&quot; 16-year-old Mick Murray <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140429205937/http://nypost.com/2014/04/27/prom-stabbing-suspect-was-funny-and-happy-class-clown/">told the Post</a>. &quot;He was always kind of weird, but nothing that made me think he would do this.&quot; &quot;He seems like a nice guy, but he&#x2019;s the class clown,&#x201D; added Sanchez&#x2019;s best friend, Imani Langson, about Plaskon. &quot;Then, out of nowhere, he snaps and kills her. It&#x2019;s obvious that he was planning this.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He was an all-American kid, the kind of kid you&#x2019;d want your kids hanging around,&quot; Gail Wells, the mother of a student who has known the Plaskon family for years, told the Times.</p>

<p>&quot;I&#x2019;m mortified that he did this,&quot; 17-year-old Emma Grace, a friend of Sanchez, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140429205937/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/conn-teen-accused-stabbing-student-held-psych-ward-article-1.1770277">told the News</a>. &quot;Chris was somebody I would never imagine doing this at all. I always thought higher of him. Chris was always someone that was very into sports, nice, friendly, had a lot of friends.&quot;</p>

<p>According to his lawyer, Plaskon will be held in a psych ward for at least two weeks; his arraignment is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140429205937/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local/northern_suburbs&amp;id=9516284">scheduled for Monday</a>, and he will not appear at it. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140429205937/http://www.courant.com/community/milford/hc-milford-school-stabbing-0426-20140425,0,3011040.story">The lawyer added</a> that he expects Plaskon will face a murder charge as an adult offender.</p>
