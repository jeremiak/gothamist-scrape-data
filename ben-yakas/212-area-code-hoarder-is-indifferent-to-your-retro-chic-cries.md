title: 212 Area Code Hoarder Is Indifferent To Your Retro-Chic Cries

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="81411212.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130606001109im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/81411212.jpg" width="260" height="260" class="image-left"> </span></p>

<p>We already knew that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130606001109/http://gothamist.com/2010/08/18/212_area_codes_now_retro-chic.php">some people think</a> that 212 area codes are the &quot;new rent-controlled apartments,&quot; &quot;retro-chic,&quot; and platonic ideals of hipness. But are they cool enough to hoard? A record executive wanted a 212 area code so badly, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130606001109/http://eastvillage.thelocal.nytimes.com/2011/08/12/want-a-212-number-this-man-has-100-of-them/">he paid $3,000 for 100 of them</a>. At least that&apos;s still better than <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130606001109/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/25/212_area_could_be_yours_for_one_mil.php">paying $1 million for one.</a></p>

<p>Dennis Mykytyn, who runs record label Modern Records in East Village, calls the 212 area code &quot;prestigious&quot;&#x2014;<strong>&#x201C;When 212 is on your phone, everyone knows where that it is, and it means you&#x2019;ve been around for a while.&#x201D; </strong>He bought the digits in 2007 for his hedge fund, which has since closed; with his new business, he uses less than 10 of the numbers currently. </p>

<p>Jason Alperovich, the director of business development at Improcom, the company who sold Mykytyn the numbers, says the 212 numbers are still in high demand, but there aren&apos;t enough to go around: &#x201C;A good percentage of our clients will ask for 212, but people are being pushed to 646s. They&#x2019;re extinct now.&#x201D; </p>

<p>But don&apos;t think that those desperate pleas for prestige will be answered by Mykytyn, who doesn&apos;t plan to sell any of his numbers&#x2014;after all, if people think his analyst in Minnesota is really in NYC, it gives him extra cache. <strong>&#x201C;I guess I could sublease 212 numbers if I wanted to. But I&#x2019;m not sure if that&#x2019;s a business I want to get involved in,</strong>&#x201D; he said.</p>
