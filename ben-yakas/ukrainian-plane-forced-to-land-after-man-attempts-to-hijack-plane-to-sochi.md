<p>Officials say a passenger aboard an Istanbul-bound Ukrainian flight claimed he had a bomb and tried to divert the plane to Sochi. Habib Soluk, the Turkish Transport Ministry undersecretary, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427140623/http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/turkish-authorities-search-plane-over-bomb-claim/2014/02/07/6abd714e-901b-11e3-878e-d76656564a01_story.html">told reporters that</a> the man rose from his seat, shouted that there was a bomb on board and tried to enter the locked cockpit. </p>

<p>The pilot switched on the hijack signal (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427140623/https://twitter.com/RichardEngel/statuses/431842035197558784">NBC News&apos; Richard Engel reports</a> pilots turned off their inflight monitors), then an F-16 military jet <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427140623/http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/hijack-attempt-on-ukraine-to-turkey-airliner.aspx?pageID=238&amp;nid=62203&amp;NewsCatID=341">escorted the plane</a> down. The plane has now landed at Istanbul&#x2019;s Sabiha Gokcen airport, but the 110 passengers are reportedly still on board. There have been reports that the would-be hijacker has been subdued, but that hasn&apos;t been confirmed yet. Pegasus Airlines confirmed in a statement that there was a &#x201C;bomb threat&#x201D; aboard the flight. </p>
