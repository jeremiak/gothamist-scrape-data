<p>Earlier today, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160318165902/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/30/rumor_alert_radiohead_playing_occup.php">it was rumored that</a> Radiohead would be playing for protesters at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160318165902/http://gothamist.com/tags/occupywallstreet">Occupy Wall Street</a> at 4 p.m. this afternoon. Then it was confirmed! Then it was denied <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160318165902/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/30/occupy_wall_street_says_radiohead_s.php">by Radiohead&apos;s management</a>. But THEN, spokespersons for the Occupy Wall Street protesters and MoveOn both told us it was really happening. And then some people handed out cough drops. So in conclusion, no one really knows what&apos;s going to happen in the next hour or so. </p>

<p>But below, you can watch a live stream from Zuccotti Park, in case the band does show up and perform (like Thom Yorke did in 2005 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160318165902/http://indiesurfer.blogspot.com/2006/09/thom-yorke-live-acoustic-trade-justice.html">at a Trade Justice Rally</a>). We&apos;ll update this post as we learn any new information...but let&apos;s all hope this wasn&apos;t some sort of sick joke which ends with Chris Martin sauntering into the park instead of Yorke. Or an even worse prospect: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160318165902/http://twitter.com/#!/brandonstosuy/status/119845835621150720">Loutallica takes the stage.</a></p>

<p><strong>Update 3:55 p.m.</strong>: Protesters can be heard chanting, &quot;If you&apos;re just here for the band, go home,&quot; and &quot;Come to the march it&apos;s more important then radiohead.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Update 4:00 p.m.</strong>: They&apos;re clearing out space for the band now, and people are starting to get louder.</p>

<p><strong>Update 4:02 p.m.</strong>: Organizers have now asked everyone to sit down...</p>

<p><strong>Update 4:10 p.m.</strong>: Organizers just made an announcement: they are not sure if Radiohead are coming, but they are preparing in case they do. On the plus side, there&apos;s a lot of solid call-and-response chanting happening. But be prepared to wait until the  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160318165902/https://occupywallst.org/article/greetings-occupied-wall-street/">March to 1 Police Plaza</a> at 5:30 p.m., when you can take your frustration out on The Man!</p>

<p><strong>Update 4:30 p.m.</strong>: The call-and-response chants have melded with the organizers&apos; announcements. The protesters passionate rallying cry will now and forever more be &quot;Mic Check&quot; (and &quot;The Union Is Coming&quot;).</p>

<p>Meanwhile, some <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160318165902/http://twitter.com/#!/brianstarke/status/119867469706960896">people on Twitter</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160318165902/http://twitter.com/#!/jerdmegd">are saying</a> that Radiohead are at Union Square. It&apos;s almost certainly a joke, but it might be worth marching up there while chanting &quot;Mic Check&quot; to take a peek. At the very least, maybe you&apos;ll find a guy who resembles Johnny Greenwood to hang out with.</p>

<p><strong>Update 4:40 p.m.</strong>: There is a rumor that the NYPD is escorting Radiohead in. Lots of activity and movement around the park.</p>

<p><strong>Update 5:05 p.m.</strong>: Nope, nothing yet. But we just heard that at least 3,000 people have crowded into the park at this point. Organizers said they are planning to march around the block until 5:30 p.m., when the &quot;real&quot; march starts. </p>

<p>All hope is not lost though&#x2014;people are still chanting &quot;Mic Check.&quot; </p>
