In his celebratory <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529153546/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/14/reforming_marijuana_law_adding_elec.php">final State of The City address this week</a>, Mayor Bloomberg outlined a host of &quot;unfinished business&quot; he hoped to either complete or move forward significantly during his final 318 days in office, including the Third Water Tunnel, the 7 Train extension, the third leg of the High Line, and more. Conspicuously absent from that speech: any mention of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529153546/http://gothamist.com/tags/eastsideaccess">East Side Access</a> project. </p>

<p>The long-running project to bring the LIRR to Grand Central was once slated to be done by 2015&#x2014;but it now won&apos;t be done until <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529153546/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/22/lirr_to_grand_central_years_late_an.php">at least August 2019</a>. Above, you can check out some <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529153546/http://www.flickr.com/photos/mtaphotos/">impressive new photos</a> from the tunnels, in case you were worried everyone forgot about this project. It really looks like the set of some &apos;70s sci-fi/James Bond-esque film.</p>

<p>It&apos;s already gone billions overbudget, and at least one person <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529153546/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/18/worker_killed_by_falling_concrete_i.php">has died during construction</a>&#x2014;suffice to say, hopefully real progress is being made, and this won&apos;t become our very own <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529153546/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Dig">Big Dig.</a></p>

<p>Oh, and also check out the MTA&apos;s last video update of the project, which includes some suitably dramatic music:</p>
