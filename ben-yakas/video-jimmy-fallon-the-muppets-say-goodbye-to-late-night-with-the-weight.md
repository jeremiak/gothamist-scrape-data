<p>While Jay Leno was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140309153705/http://laist.com/2014/02/07/video_jay_leno_leaves_the_tonight_s.php">choking back denim-stained tears</a> to the sounds of Garth Brooks, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140309153705/http://gothamist.com/tags/jimmyfallon">Jimmy Fallon</a> chose the Jimmy Fallonest way to end his stint on <em>Late Night</em>: by teaming up with The Muppets to perform &quot;The Weight&quot; by The Band as the last waltz of <em>Late Night with Jimmy Fallon.</em></p>

<p>The video is a close (possibly shot-by-shot!) remake of The Band&apos;s performance of the song from <em>The Last Waltz</em> (watch it below). Obviously Animal&apos;s harmonies are the best part of it, though the ending with Fallon entering his new studio to applause is nice too. </p>

<p>Fallon also received advice and gifts from celebrities during his final show, including a particularly nice lego piece from Chris Pratt.</p>

<p>And he and Higgins also got a little sentimental, looking back on some of their best and worst <em>Late Night</em> moments.</p>
