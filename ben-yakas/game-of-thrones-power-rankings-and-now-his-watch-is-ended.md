<p>Last week on <em>Game Of Thrones</em>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428172113/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/14/game_of_thrones_power_rankings_walk.php">we followed the</a> sexual exploits of young squire Podrick and watched as Jaime Lannister lost his good hand. In this week&apos;s jam-packed episode, things start rushing along very quickly: we had a Night&apos;s Watch mutiny, the psychological torture of Theon, and the brutal ascendance of Daenerys Targaryen. Since the show is all about how people jockey for power, we&apos;ve decided to follow along this season with our <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428172113/http://gothamist.com/tags/gameofthronespowerrankings">Game of Thrones Power Rankings</a>&#x2014;aka, who is owning this week.</p>

<p><strong>Game Of Thrones Power Rankings, Week 4:</strong></p>

<p><strong>1. Daenerys Targaryen</strong>: Lays her cards on the table in the very exciting conclusion of this excellent episode. She&apos;s finally learning to be a few steps ahead of her opponents. </p>

<p><strong>2. Tywin Lannister</strong>: Once again proves he&apos;s the smartest guy in the room when he points out how horrible Joffrey is. Or as he tells his daughter, &quot;I distrust you because you&apos;re not as smart as you think you are.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>3. Olenna Redwyne</strong>: Whether she&apos;s making fun of her son or bonding with Varys, she is the best&#x2014;especially when she&apos;s wondering what happens when the non-existant bumps against the decrepit. </p>

<p><strong>4. Margaery Tyrell</strong>: The future queen now has the king wrapped around her finger. Too bad she hasn&apos;t quite figured out that the king has no concept of what love is. </p>

<p><strong>5. Joffrey &quot;Why Incest Should Be Banned&quot; Baratheon</strong>: At least he&apos;s finally starting to learn about public relations from his bride-to-be. His giddiness over the bloody history of the Targaryean&apos;s is also...as human as he gets.</p>

<p><strong>6. Lord Varys The Spider</strong>: That certainly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428172113/https://twitter.com/ditzkoff/status/326141197729017858">deserved an Emmy</a> for best monologue by a guy who had his testicles cut off, right? Trying to help Sansa and hurt Littlefinger is icing.</p>

<p><strong>7. Sansa Stark</strong>: This babe in the woods might not be an interesting girl, but all the interesting people are talking about her.</p>

<p><strong>8. Beric Dondarrion</strong>: We get (re)-introduced to the leader of the Brotherhood Without Banners, and he makes a memorable vow to fight The Hound.</p>

<p><strong>9. Cersei Lannister</strong>: She really is not very powerful this year, is she? Her big confrontation with her father comes down to her being jealous of Margaery.</p>

<p><strong>10. Tyrion Lannister</strong>: A Tyrion-light episode, but he was still witness to that epic Varys monologue about true revenge taking patience. </p>

<p><strong>10. Ramsay Bolton</strong>: Damn. Theon&apos;s would-be rescuer looks positively gleeful when Theon realizes what just happened. </p>

<p><strong>11. Bran Stark</strong>: Seriously, no more climbing Bran.   </p>

<p><strong>12. Brienne Of Tarth</strong>: Gives Jaime some hard love: &#x201C;You have a taste, one taste of the real world, where people have important things taken from them, and you whine, and cry, and quit. You sound like a bloody woman.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>13. Jaime Lannister</strong>: Super depressed about his hand. But he does have a cool new hand-shaped necklace! </p>

<p><strong>14. Lord Commander Jeor Mormont</strong>: Farewell Old Bear. Even in death, you are more powerful than Samwell Tarly.</p>

<p><strong>15. Samwell Tarly</strong>: Literally stands around doing nothing while his &quot;brothers&quot; murder the Lord Commander...then rushes off to get Gilly. </p>

<p><em>The Viserys Targeryen Memorial Least Powerful Person Of The Week Award</em>: <strong>Theon Greyjoy</strong>&#x2014;After he finally, <em>finally</em> realizes he made the wrong choice siding with his father over the Starks, we almost feel bad for Theon. It really doesn&apos;t seem like anything is going to get better for him anytime soon.</p>

<p><strong>Not Applicable</strong>: For an episode filled with storylines and exciting parts, there were a surprising amount of characters missing: no sight of the (slightly boring) adventures of Robb Stark, Caetlyn Stark, Ser Brynden Tully, and the others at Riverrun. Also no sign of Mance Rayder, Jon Snow, and the Beyond The Wall gang. Stannis Baratheon and Melisandre were MIA; Littlefinger was mentioned but never seen. No Podrick or Bronn sightings. And no Rickon...or was Rickon there? Even if he was there, it&apos;s not like he would have done anything (except maybe randomly run away). </p>

<p>This was the last episode we had a screener for, so next&apos;s weeks rankings will probably be published a bit later than these have been. Until then, here&apos;s all the <em>Game Of Thrones</em> references from <em>Parks Of Recreation.</em></p>
