</div></div>					<p>Almost four months after the NYPD and FBI <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509233710/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/19/spotted_fbi_on_prince_and_wooster.php#photo-1">started searching the Soho basement</a> where Pedro Hernandez <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509233710/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/24/etan_patz_suspect_admits_to_stabbin.php">confessed</a> he killed 6-year-old <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509233710/http://gothamist.com/tags/etanpatz">Etan Patz</a> in 1979, police have been spotted there again today. Among other things, two ESU trucks, one CSU truck, and ventilation was spotted in the area of West Broadway and Prince Street; one officer told our tipster that they were &quot;wrapping up&quot; there. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509233710/http://www.wnyc.org/blogs/wnyc-news-blog/2012/aug/08/nypd-return-alleged-etan-patz-killers-bodega-soho/">WNYC got photos</a> of large brown paper bags being carried out of the basement, which used to rest below a bodega run by Hernandez. </p>

<p>The renewed activity in the case comes just as cops <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509233710/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20120808/new-york-city/cops-absolutely-certain-they-arrested-etan-patzs-killer">tell DNAInfo</a> they are &quot;absolutely certain&quot; Hernandez is guilty of killing Patz. That certainty stems from the fact that Hernandez&apos;s ex-wife Daisy Rivera revealed he kept a photo of the missing boy among his personal belongings for years. &#x201C;She brought up that once she was going through a box of his with personal papers and inside that box was the picture of Patz,&#x201D; a source <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509233710/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/patz_killer_kept_photo_says_boy_ohZ2fBkyunLYNKTeVuaLMO">told the Post</a>. &#x201C;She said it looked like it came from a missing poster that was put up in the neighborhood.&quot; </p>

<p>When she confronted him about it, she claims he barked at her, &quot;What are you doing? Put that away! Don&#x2019;t go through my stuff!&#x201D; After that, he forbade her from ever touching it again. Cops aren&apos;t hopeful they&apos;ll find that particular picture, but they believe Rivera&apos;s recollection. Hernandez has been charged with second-degree murder; according to NYPD Chief Ray Kelly, he told police he lured the child &#x201C;with the promise of a soda, and led him to the basement of the bodega, and strangled him&#x201D; in the basement.</p>
