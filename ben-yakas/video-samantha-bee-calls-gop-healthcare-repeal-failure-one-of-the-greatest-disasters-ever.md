<p>Donald Trump promised to get Obamacare repealed-and-replaced when he got into office, and he dove head-first into that task upon becoming president... and has so far failed to close the deal with Congress. &quot;Closing deals is the one thing President &apos;Big Boy Truck&#x2019; was supposed to know how to do,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170401231533/http://gothamist.com/tags/samanthabee">Samantha Bee</a> said on <em>Full Frontal</em> last night. &quot;In the end, the charmer-in-chief struck out harder than the douche-y guy at the bar who goes up to every girl in the room asking them, &apos;Are you a model? Because you should totally model.&apos;&quot;</p>

<p>As for Trump&apos;s complaints that Republicans failed because of a lack of support from Democrats, Bee added, &quot;Yes, and the Atlanta Falcons would have won the Super Bowl, but they had no support from the New England Patriots.&quot;</p>

<p>In another segment, Bee explained how publicly disgraced judge Johnnie Caldwell became a representative from Georgia, despite a sexual harassment scandal&#x2014;and all because no one ran against him. &quot;Godammit Georgia!&quot; Bee exclaimed. &quot;You can&apos;t find one lady in Thomaston with a pussy hat and law degree who wants to take the attorney-licker down?&quot;</p>

<p>And the show also aired an animated sequel to its piece last year <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170401231533/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrxTrR5_8Zo">about rape kit backlogs</a> that goes full-<em>School House Rock</em>.</p>
