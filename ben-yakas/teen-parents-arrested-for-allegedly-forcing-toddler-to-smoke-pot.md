<p>Two teenage parents in western NY have been arrested for allegedly forcing their toddler to smoke marijuana. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504132733/http://www.buffalonews.com/feed/teen-parents-charged-with-forcing-toddler-to-smoke-marijuana-20131213">According to Buffalo News</a>, 17-year-old Jessica Kelsey, 18-year-old George Kelsey, and Jessica&#x2019;s father, 54-year-old Don Baker, have all been charged with second-degree reckless endangerment and endangering the welfare of a child for the incident.</p>

<p>According to the Chautauqua County sheriff&apos;s office, all three family members were in an apartment on December 5th, and either &quot;helped, observed or encouraged&quot; the 23-month-old to smoke marijuana from a lighted bowl. </p>

<p>Undersheriff Charles Holder said, &quot;They packed the marijuana pipe, lit it for the baby and gave it to him and encouraged him to inhale...it&apos;s just unbelievable.&quot; According <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504132733/http://www.wivb.com/news/crime/deputies-three-helped-toddler-smoke-pot">to WIVB</a>, the incident may have been videotaped, but the sheriff&apos;s office would neither confirm or deny that. </p>

<p>&quot;Unfortunately, when babies are having babies, that&apos;s what happens,&quot; said Jodie Altman, executive director of Renaissance House (which educates young people about drug use). The toddler and another sibling have now been placed into the care of Child Protective Services.<br>
