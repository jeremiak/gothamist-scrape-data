<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none" style=" width:640px; "> <img alt="22411carmelo.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602135458im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/22411carmelo.jpg" width="640" height="465"> <br> <i>The dynamic duo in action last night (AP)</i></div> <p></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602135458/http://gothamist.com/tags/carmeloanthony">Carmelo Anthony</a> was given several different types of introductions to the city yesterday, all of which left fans jubilant, salivating at the prospect of actual relevancy in the NBA for the first time since the &apos;90s. He was formerly introduced at a press conference prior to last night&apos;s game, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602135458/http://sports.espn.go.com/new-york/nba/news/story?id=6152186">telling reporters</a> how excited he was to be playing for the team, in the city he grew up in: &quot;I think New York needed a moment like this. When they got Amare, it brought some excitement back to the city. Now, as Amare said, New York basketball is back. Will we win a championship this year? Who knows? That takes time. <strong>But this team is headed in the right direction...It&apos;s a dream come true for me, and I&apos;m ready to rock.&quot;</strong></p>

<p>Before he even stepped foot on the court at MSG, fans snapped up every one of his newly minted #7 jerseys that they could find&#x2014;according to the News, they <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602135458/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2011/02/24/2011-02-24_carmelo_anthonys_no_7_knicks_jersey_sells_out_before_his_tipoff_debut_at_msg.html">sold out</a> before tip off! Because fans were treating Carmelo&apos;s coming as the true sign that Knicks basketball is back (or at the very least, not shameful): &quot;Twenty years from now I&apos;m gonna tell my kids I was at Carmelo&apos;s first Knicks game. That&apos;s what I&apos;m gonna do, New York Knicks baby,&quot; one fan <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602135458/http://www.ny1.com/content/top_stories/134435/knicks-introduce-carmelo-anthony-to-new-york">told NY1</a>. &quot;I wouldn&apos;t care if Carmelo was from Iran. He&apos;s really, really good. It&apos;s an exciting night,&quot; said Chris Rock <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602135458/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/apple_star_is_sweet_hot_new_singing_dB2oWYV1h50ympMN1BrpRO?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">at the game</a> last night.</p>

<p>And even with no practice for the new team, the Knicks <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602135458/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/24/last_nights_action_game_1.php">solidly defeated</a> the Milwaukee Bucks last night, with Anthony contributing 27 points, including some clutch buckets down the stretch after Stoudemire fouled out. He was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602135458/http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/basketball/knicks/2011/02/24/2011-02-24_knicks_duo_of_carmelo_anthony_amare_stoudemire_gets_hand_from_toney_douglas_and_.html?r=sports">treated to</a> standing ovations and chants of &quot;Melll-o&quot; throughout the game. &quot;I never experienced anything like that before,&quot; Anthony said of the reception. He&apos;s also fully aware the team will have a lot of gelling to do in the last 27 games of the season if they want to make a run in the playoffs this year, but Melo <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602135458/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/apple_star_is_sweet_hot_new_singing_dB2oWYV1h50ympMN1BrpRO?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">seemed prepared</a> to take on the spotlight of the Garden: &quot;I love this city, man, I love New York. I&apos;m ready for it, all of it. It takes a certain kind of person to deal with New York City and with me coming from here...I think it&apos;s going to be easy.&quot;</p>
