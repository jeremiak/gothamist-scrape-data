<p>As one of the great 20th century philosophers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502142156/http://www.facebook.com/pages/Garfield-was-right-Mondays-suck-/117785374901143">put it</a>, &quot;Mondays Suck.&quot; But sometimes Sundays are just as bad: maybe you&apos;re hungover, maybe you have to catch up with work, but the whole time, you&apos;re carrying around the foreboding knowledge that Monday is right around the corner. Well <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502142156/http://www.npr.org/blogs/allsongs/2011/04/03/135087738/the-ramones-live-26-songs-in-54-minutes">here&apos;s a way</a> to bust you out of your Sunday blues: a red hot soundboard recording of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502142156/http://gothamist.com/tags/theramones">The Ramones</a> live at NYC&apos;s Palladium, from January 7, 1978, at the height of their powers.</p>

<p>They blast out of the gates with a ripping version of &quot;Rockaway Beach,&quot; then tear through 25 more songs all in 54 minutes. The video of the show below sets the audio of the gig to a series of cheap sci-fi and horror movie trailers. Enjoy:</p>
