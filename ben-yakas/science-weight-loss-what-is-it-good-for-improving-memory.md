<p>Ever since we <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110515104114/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/01/dumb_study_the_beautiful_people_are.php">discovered</a> the USA Today &quot;Your Life&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110515104114/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/08/study_youre_addicted_to_coffee_beca.php">section</a>, we find ourselves caring intensely about Dwight Howard&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110515104114/http://yourlife.usatoday.com/health/medical/diabetes/story/2011/04/NBA-star-Dwight-Howard-talks-diabetes/46075150/1?csp=ylf">diabetes</a>, and really wanting to get to the bottom of this mystery of the girl who hit puberty <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110515104114/http://yourlife.usatoday.com/parenting-family/story/2011/04/Girls-hit-puberty-earlier-than-ever-and-doctors-arent-sure-why/45989054/1?csp=ylf">at age six</a>. But it&apos;s the studies which they collect, like amateur <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110515104114/http://www.feargod.net/fluff.html">belly button lint</a> enthusiasts, that most titillate us. And a new study they feature this week has finally uncovered a reason to go through with all that weight loss stuff: because <strike>it makes you more attractive, aids your self-confidence and ensures a healthier, longer life</strike> it improves your memory!</p>

<p>A team of scientists from several research centers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110515104114/http://yourlife.usatoday.com/fitness-food/story/2011/04/Weight-loss-improves-memory-research-shows/46093654/1">analyzed memory tests</a> taken by 150 people who weighed an average of 300 pounds, and had several health problems, such as high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes and sleep apnea. Over 100 of that group had gastric bypass surgery, and scientists gave them the same set of memory tests a second time, and discovered that those who had lost an average 50 pounds showed improvement in multiple cognitive abilities, including memory and executive functioning, which includes organization skills. The obese patients who didn&apos;t have surgery and whose weight stayed the same showed a mild decline in memory.</p>

<p>Of course, they don&apos;t give any tips on how to go about losing that weight, except for surgery. Do they expect us to eat well and exercise regularly? You never see scientists working out! When will Science release their weight loss secrets?? Because we&apos;re getting kind of tired of injecting ourselves with hormones from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110515104114/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/08/shoot_up_hormone_from_pregnant_ladi.php">pregnant ladies&apos; urine.</a></p>
