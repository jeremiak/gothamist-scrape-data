A driver in Clinton Hill took a &quot;Free Parking&quot; sign at a Brooklyn supermarket very, very seriously yesterday. According to the FDNY, the driver slammed into the front doors of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141225025113/http://www.freshfanatic.com/">Fresh Fanatic</a> supermarket on Washington and Park Avenues just after 2 p.m. on Saturday. As we know all too well, some signs are just <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141225025113/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/27/miley_cyrus_twerk_worshipers_nyc.php">too enticing.</a></p>

<p>FDNY add that two people, including the driver, were transported to Kings County Hospital. Police could not find any other information about the driver and whether they were charged with anything. But one person <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141225025113/http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/1q9gux/luckily_no_one_was_hurt_but_some_drunk_moron_just/">posted two of the above photos of the incident on Reddit</a>, writing: &quot;Luckily no one was hurt, but some drunk moron just crashed into my friend&apos;s store.&quot;</p>
