<p>The strangest story of the weekend had nothing to do with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130723020613/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/15/photo_wearing_a_wetsuit_in_the_gowa.php">Gowanus canal hazard suits</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130723020613/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/16/nanny_suing_upper_east_side_sociali.php">indentured servitude</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130723020613/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/15/pbr_making_patriotic_wwii_beer_cans.php">patriotic beer</a>: it was New England Patriots&apos; owner Robert Kraft accusing Russian President Vladimir Putin of stealing his Super Bowl ring. Was it an expensive international faux pas? Was it a gift Kraft is now trying to take back? Does this mean that Putin&apos;s secretly a Jets fan? </p>

<p>At Carnegie Hall&#x2019;s Medal of Excellence gala at the Waldorf-Astoria on Thursday, Kraft gave <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130723020613/http://www.nypost.com/p/pagesix/kraft_putin_stole_bowl_ring_qtB16b5PI0jipYT6tQxUGO">his side of the story</a>: &quot;I took out the ring and showed it to (Putin). <strong>And he put it on and he goes, &apos;I can kill someone with this ring,&apos;</strong>&quot; Kraft said. &quot;I put my hand out and he put it in his pocket, and three KGB guys got around him and walked out.&quot; </p>

<p>At the time, Kraft said in a statement that he gave him the ring &quot;as a symbol of the respect and admiration that I have for the Russian people and [his] leadership.&quot; But now Kraft claims he was pressured into taking that stance by the US government, who didn&apos;t want to stir the pot: &quot;There was a pause on the other end of the line, and the voice repeated, &#x2018;It would really be in the best interest if you meant to give the ring as a present.&#x2019;&#x201D;</p>

<p><strong>&quot;What Mr. Kraft is saying now is weird,&quot;</strong> Putin&apos;s presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130723020613/http://www.cnn.com/2013/06/16/world/europe/russia-putin-ring/index.html?hpt=hp_t2">responded today</a>. &quot;I was standing 20 centimeters away from him and Mr. Putin and saw and heard how Mr. Kraft gave this ring as a gift.&quot; Either way, the ring remains in the Kremlin library. But Putin should be wary: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130723020613/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/23/jets_enemy_bill_belichick_is_also_a.php">roller-skating pirates don&apos;t appreciate</a> people stealing their booty.</p>
