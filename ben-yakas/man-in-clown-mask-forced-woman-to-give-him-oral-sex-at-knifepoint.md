The 29-year-old victim met the perp, who called himself Mike, through an online escort service. </p>

<p>They met at 2:30 a.m. on September 20th at 34 Jefferson Avenue in Bedford-Stuyvesant. When she got to the sixth floor, she was met by Mike in an Pennywise clown mask inspired by the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170129230818/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It_(1990_film)">Stephen King novel-turned-film</a> <em>It</em>.</p>

<p>The perp took out a butcher knife and forced the woman back into the elevator. The suspect told the victim he wouldn&apos;t kill her if she dropped to her knees and gave him oral sex, which she did. He then fled the scene; the woman waited some time before calling cops, at which point the forensic evidence in the elevator had been contaminated. Cops describe the suspect as a black male in his 20s, at least 6-foot-3 and weighing about 175 pounds.</p>
