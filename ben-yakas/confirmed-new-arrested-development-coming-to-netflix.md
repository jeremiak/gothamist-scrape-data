<p>Last month, we almost blue ourselves when we heard word that cult television show <em>Arrested Development</em> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111120172235/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/02/arrested_development_coming_back_fo.php">would be coming back</a> for one more TV season as well as a movie. After years filled with rumors, anticipation and let down, it was hard to know whether to get our hopes up yet again. But it&apos;s now been confirmed: new episodes of <em>Arrested Development</em> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111120172235/http://thedailywh.at/2011/11/18/breaking-arrested-development-news-of-the-day-2/">will be coming</a> to Netflix in 2013! Let&apos;s celebrate with a chicken dance:</p>

<p>According <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111120172235/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/arrested-development-be-resurrected-by-263790">to the Hollywood Reporter</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111120172235/http://gothamist.com/mt/mt-search.cgi?search=netflix&amp;__mode=tag&amp;IncludeBlogs=1&amp;limit=30&amp;page=1">Netflix</a>, in partnership with 20th Century Fox Television and Imagine Television, will revive the show, which was canceled in 2006. New episodes will be available to Netflix members beginning in the first half of 2013. And now everyone can forgive them for the whole <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111120172235/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/10/netflix_kills_qwikster.php">Qwikster debacle</a>!</p>

<p> &#x201C;Arrested Development is one of the finest American comedies in TV history and its return through Netflix is a perfect example of how we are working closely with studios and networks to provide consumers with entertainment they love,&#x201D; Netflix Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos said in a statement. </p>

<p>Ron Howard, the show&apos;s executive producer and narrator, said, &#x201C;After a long hiatus, I&#x2019;m dying to finally get back to the narrator&#x2019;s microphone ... &apos;It&#x2019;s Arrested&#x2026;Development.&apos; &quot; Star Jason Batemen <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111120172235/https://twitter.com/#!/batemanjason/status/137714497400995840">tweeted</a>, &quot;Netflix is gassing up the staircar! I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever been happier to wear a pair of khakis.&quot;</p>

<p>During <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111120172235/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/19/arrested_development_is_reuiniting.php">The New Yorker Festival</a>, <em>Arrested Development&apos;s</em> creator, Mitch Hurwitz, said that they were hoping to do a limited-run series into the movie, with each episode focusing on one major cast member. Bateman later added, &quot;It&apos;s true. We will do 10 episodes and the movie. Probably shoot them all together next summer for a release in early &apos;13. VERY excited!&quot; Hopefully all these new episodes will be utterly enchanting:</p>
