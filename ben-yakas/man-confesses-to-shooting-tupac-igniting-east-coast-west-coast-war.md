<p>On the eve of what would have been rapper Tupac Shakur&apos;s 40th birthday, a man <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427122555/http://www.allhiphop.com/stories/news/archive/2011/06/15/22790289.aspx">has confessed</a> to shooting the legendary rapper in 1994, inadvertently setting off the feud which would eventually claim both Tupac and Biggie Smalls&apos;s lives. Dexter Isaac, who is currently serving a life sentence at MDC Brooklyn for separate charges, confessed that he was paid $2,500 dollars by James &quot;Jimmy Henchman&quot; Rosemond to rob Tupac inside Manhattan&apos;s Quad Studios on November 30, 1994. Check out his full confession, which he gave to AllHipHop.com, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427122555/http://www.allhiphop.com/photos/storage/1000.4112.22790236.AHHdexterissaacsstatement.jpg">here</a>.</p>

<p>Isaac, who shot Tupac that day, said he was motivated to confess for a few reasons: he was angry that Jimmy Henchman had identified him for dealing cocaine, and that Henchman had labelled him a rat. He wanted the world to know that Henchman was involved in the shooting. And Isaac wanted to clear his conscience, and apologize to Tupac and Biggie&apos;s families. &quot;I want to apologize to his family [Tupac Shakur] and for the mistake I did for that sucker [Jimmy Henchman]...<strong>I am trying to clean it up to give [Tupac and Biggie&apos;s] mothers some closure.&quot;</strong></p>

<p>After that fateful shooting, Tupac would accuse Sean Combs, Andre Harrell, and Biggie Smalls of setting him up, igniting the East Coast/West Coast hip hop war. Less than two years later, Tupac would be killed in Las Vegas; a year after that, Biggie would be killed in a drive-by in LA. Back in January, the LAPD <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427122555/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/07/the_lapd_is_back_on_the_hunt_for_bi.php">announced</a> they were reopening the case into Biggie&apos;s murder; then two months ago, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427122555/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/07/new_fbi_files_reveal_that_biggie_wa.php">FBI released</a> a 359-page file with details from the case. </p>

<p>Police have yet to charge anyone with either murder, and we still haven&apos;t figured out <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427122555/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/10/biggie_vs_tupac_tip_jar_edition.php">which tip jar</a> to contribute to. However, we have taken a long hard look at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427122555/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Sketch_of_the_suspect.jpg">sketch of Biggie&apos;s suspect</a>, and think we may have ourselves <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427122555/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fonzworth_Bentley">a new lead.</a></p>
