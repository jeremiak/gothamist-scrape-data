</div></div><p>We were pretty sure that nothing could make the Times Square pedestrian plaza feel like the lonely hills of Nebraska. But then yesterday, Professional Bull Riders (PBR) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412161547/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/10/16/2010-10-16_bull_riders_take_over_times_square_for_competition_spectators_flock_to_watch.html">held</a> a bull riding competition there, hauling in 50,000 pounds of steel and dirt to recreate the mood. Flanked by skyscrapes and projected onto giant TV screens, it was an odd but compelling juxtaposition for the spectators who crowded around to watch ten of the world&apos;s top riders take turns on the raging bulls. In years past, PBR put on their show <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412161547/http://gothamist.com/2008/01/03/bulls_in_nyc.php">in or near MSG</a>; this was the first year they were able to take advantage of the pedestrian plaza. You can see a video of the event below.</p>

<p>One of the more amusing commenters on the YouTube video suggested that the event be held in the Financial District, because they love bullsh*t there.</p>
