<p>Want to know where you&apos;re liable to get arrested for peeing outside? Want to find out what the most dangerous subway stop is? Interested in learning where cuisine from around the world is in the five boroughs? We put together a series of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502193739/http://gothamist.com/tags/interactivemap">interactive maps</a> using the City&apos;s public data over the last year to answer all those questions and more. Below, revisit the best of those maps, along with some ones we didn&apos;t make (but liked), plus some silly ones about things like NYers hookup habits and favorite things to complain about.</p>
