<p>If you weren&apos;t already charmed by alleged cocaine kingpin Ceferino (Papo) Perez, who romantically had his wife work for his drug ring to earn a little money and self-worth, then you surely will be by his delightful choice of artwork. Perez was one of 22 people <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141227164255/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/16/the_couple_who_deals_drugs_together.php">charged yesterday</a> with being part of a massive cocaine ring that worked in East Harlem and the Upper East Side. And it seems Perez really let the coke trade go to his head.</p>

<p>Perez <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141227164255/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2011/06/17/2011-06-17_busted_harlem_cocaine_kingpin_so_obsessed_with_scarface_he_put_his_face_on_the_f.html">superimposed his face</a> onto a blown-up still of Al Pacino from the classic 80s cocaine, guts and glory film, <em>Scarface</em>...and he kept it on his bed stand. &quot;He&apos;s very proud of what he&apos;s doing, obviously, and he&apos;s quite arrogant and narcissistic,&quot; said NYPD Inspector Lori Pollock. Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141227164255/http://www.ny1.com/content/top_stories/141182/police-break-up-manhattan-cocaine-ring">gave reporters</a> an idea of just how large an operation Perez was managing: &quot;This [investigation] brought down an entire, notorious drug operation, whose kingpin was so well-insulated that for years he was virtually untouchable...Ceferino Perez supplied one-third of all of East Harlem&apos;s cocaine supply.&quot; </p>

<p>Although Vance called Perez &quot;untouchable,&quot; reports would lead one to believe he was quite active in the day-to-day running of the operation: he would often answer the phone for their $80,000-a-day delivery service, and he oversaw the bagging of the cocaine. He faces 25 years to life in prison if convicted. </p>
