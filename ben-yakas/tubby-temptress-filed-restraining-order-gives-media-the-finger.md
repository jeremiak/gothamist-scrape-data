<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2009_10_brooksw.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629173247im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2009_10_brooksw.jpg" width="215" height="309" class="image-left"> </span>More details on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629173247/http://gothamist.com/2009/10/21/former_mets_gm_starring_in_fatal_at.php">Steve Phillips/&quot;Tubby Temptress&quot;</a> ESPN scandal have been revealed, and if you thought it would get any less ridiculous, well, you&apos;re sadly mistaken. According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629173247/http://www.tmz.com/2009/10/23/espn-analysts-steve-phillips-brooke-hundley-restraining-order">TMZ</a>, Brooke Hundley filed a restraining order against Phillips on Aug. 20, <em>a day after</em> she crashed her car outside the Phillips&apos; home while leaving a way-too-detailed letter describing the affair for Phillips wife. In the restraining order, she alleged that Phillips cornered her in a hotel suite in July, and wouldn&apos;t stop harassing <em>her</em> with text messages and phone calls. </p>

<p>Although she spurned him, Hundley reluctantly agreed to meet him &quot;a few times after work in the parking lot.&quot; Somewhat ironically, Hundey wrote in her letter, &quot;I&apos;m not just some random girl he had sex with in parking lots.&quot; The complaint was withdrawn on Sept. 15, the same day, TMZ reports, that Hundley posted this as her Facebook status: &quot;<strong>I&apos;ve seen evil and he wears khaki pants and bright blue polos</strong>.&quot;  </p>

<p>Hundley emerged at her Bristol, CT home&#x2014;and the Post <em>really</em> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629173247/http://www.nypost.com/p/sports/mets/espn_steve_phillips_mistress_returns_SnVelum2175myS67AoIqRK">goes descriptive</a>, leading with &quot;<strong>Brooke Hundley, the shlubby seductress</strong>...&quot; and then noting how they confronted the &quot;portly production assistant [to ask] about her affair with the handsome married baseball analyst Phillips.&quot;  Later, she &quot;waddled out [of her apartment] about two hours later, wearing a black coat and the same baseball cap, to hop into the car. She peeled off after extending her middle finger to a group of reporters and photographers.&quot;  And yes, there are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629173247/http://www.nypost.com/p/sports/more_sports/espn_steve_phillips_in_foul_affair_ThNxYhtWvHq7sgn0vCeRKP">new photographs of her</a>.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the Daily News <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629173247/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2009/10/23/2009-10-23_meet_another_phillips_love_mistress.html">snapped a picture of Rosa Rodriguez</a>, one of Phillips&apos; ex-mistresses.  Rodriguez&apos;s only comment: &quot;Just make sure the photos are good.&quot;</p>
