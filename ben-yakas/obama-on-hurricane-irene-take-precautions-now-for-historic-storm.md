<p>With Mayor Bloomberg having had a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425004520/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/25/hurricane_irene_is_coming_heres_a_m.php#photo-1">mini-freak out</a> yesterday, and Governor Andrew Cuomo declaring <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425004520/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/25/cuomo_calls_state_of_emergency_for.php">a state of emergency</a> due to the impending arrival of Hurricane Irene, President Obama <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425004520/http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/08/26/us-storm-irene-obama-idUSTRE77P4IM20110826">warned East Coast residents</a> about the &quot;extremely dangerous and costly&quot; storm. <strong>&quot;All indications point to this being a historic hurricane,&quot; </strong>Obama said in a statement from the Martha&apos;s Vineyard farm where he is vacationing.</p>

<p>He <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425004520/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/nyc_bracing_for_irene_fury_jbo7zBHDBGS8mj2clHwB3J">urged people</a> to take precautions now, and warned that people need to take the storm seriously: &quot;I cannot stress this highly enough. If you are in the projected path of this hurricane, you have to take precautions now. <strong>Don&apos;t wait, don&apos;t delay.&quot;</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425004520/http://gothamist.com/tags/hurricaneirene">The storm</a> was downgraded to a Category 2 hurricane earlier today by the National Hurricane Center; but the NHC is still predicting the storm surge will raise water levels by as much as 3 to 6 feet above ground level along the Jersey shore. In preparation for the hurricane, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425004520/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/25/nyc_evacuates_most_vulnerable_from.php">Bloomberg announced the evacuation</a> of the &quot;most vulnerable New Yorkers&quot; last night, including hospital patients, those in nursing homes and homes for aged, newborns, and also New Yorkers &quot;who because of age or infirmity are homebound&quot; in Zone A areas.</p>

<p>Today, Staten Island Hospital <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425004520/http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2011/08/staten_island_hospital_begins.html">has begun evacuating</a> its general population in addition. US airlines began canceling weekend flights to avoid any lengthy delays; JetBlue Airways has already canceled 434 flights in all. AirTran Airlines has canceled 28 flights for Saturday, including flights to New York, Boston and Washington, and Amtrak is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425004520/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/08/26/hurricane-irene-approache_n_937671.html">still considering</a> whether they will cancel more routes, after canceling all service below DC.</p>
