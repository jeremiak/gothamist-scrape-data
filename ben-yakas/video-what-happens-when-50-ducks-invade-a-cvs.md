<p>Approximately 50 ducks invaded a CVS in upstate New York last week. According <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203062057/http://www.newsflare.com/video/7766/entertainment-arts/there-was-an-incident-last-night-at-cvs">to the person who uploaded the video to YouTube</a>, the ducks somehow made it through two sets of automatic doors inside a CVS drugstore in Saratoga Springs on Thursday. As you can see in the video below, it&apos;s basically like Alfred Hitchcock&apos;s <em>The Birds</em>, only with cute harmless things that make goofy noises.</p>

<p>Ultimately, an employee decided to use a bag of Smartfood popcorn to lure the ducks out. &quot;There was no serious damage to the store, except for a small amount of mud that the ducks tracked in on their webbed feet,&quot; the uploader adds. This clearly could never happen in NYC, unless it involved rats, in which case it happens every goddamn day.</p>
