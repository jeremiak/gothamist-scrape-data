<p><em>Saturday Night Live</em> returned last night <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131003083738/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/29/videos_saturday_night_live_returns_1.php">with Tina Fey, Jesse Pinkman, and a whole slew of new cast members.</a> The other big highlight was musical guest Arcade Fire, who made their fourth appearance on the show. And they brought a whole new look (nudie suits, Michael Stipe-style raccoon mask, weird mirrors) to go along with a revamped, disco-tinged sound on &quot;Reflektor&quot; and &quot;Afterlife.&quot; You can hear both songs, which have a lot of Talking Heads in their DNA, below. Turns out, Arcade Fire are really into dancing now!</p>
