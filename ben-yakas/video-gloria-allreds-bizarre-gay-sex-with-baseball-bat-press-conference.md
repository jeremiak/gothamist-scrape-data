<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="43011allred.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130519162735im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/43011allred.jpg" width="230" height="149" class="image-left"> </span>Last week, Roger McDowell, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130519162735/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYkrjjTkjdk&amp;feature=related">magic loogie spitter</a> and former pitcher on the World Champion &apos;86 Mets team, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130519162735/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/28/former_mets_pitcher_in_trouble_for.php">allegedly unloaded</a> a series of homophobic slurs at three baseball fans, then threatened a father, in front of his two daughters, in a graphic manner. McDowell, the current pitching coach for the Atlanta Braves, apologized for the incident, but it wasn&apos;t enough for father Justin Quinn, who hired Gloria Allred to represent him. They wanted a harsher punishment for him, so they staged a surreal press conference to publicly shame McDowell and reenact the events&#x2014;and as you can watch below, there is something very, very weird about repeatedly simulating anal sex with a baseball bat in front of two nine-year-olds:</p>

<div style="text-align: center;"><iframe width="640" height="390" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130519162735if_/http://www.youtube.com/embed/svXrAZKfX5k" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

<p>So there was that. Just to summarize: during batting practice before Saturday&apos;s game in San Francisco, Quinn says he overheard McDowell asking three men, &quot;Are you three giving it to each other up the a- - ?&quot; and &#x201C;Are you guys a homo couple or a threesome?&#x201D; McDowell also then made the lewd gesture with the baseball bat (he claims they were &quot;heckling fans&quot;). When Quinn complained to him that there were kids there, he barked back &quot;Kids don&apos;t f- - king belong at the baseball park,&quot; then picked up the bat and threatened Quinn. Following the press conference, McDowell was placed on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130519162735/http://www.ajc.com/sports/atlanta-braves/mcdowell-placed-on-administrative-929835.html?cxtype=rss_news_128746">administrative leave</a> by the Braves yesterday, while they investigate the incident. </p>

<p>Nevertheless, we&apos;re unsure what Quinn is hoping to achieve by hiring Allred, and staging a press conference that looks more like a scene out of <em>Eastbound and Down</em>. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130519162735/http://thedailywh.at/2011/04/29/wont-somebody-please-think-of-the-children-of-the-day/">The Daily What summed up</a> the bizarreness of that press conference: <strong>&quot;Quinn&#x2019;s case apparently rests on the notion that if someone is going to traumatize his kids, it should be him.&quot;</strong></p>
