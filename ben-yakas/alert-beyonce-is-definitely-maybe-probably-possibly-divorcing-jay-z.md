<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right"> <img alt="81514bey2.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144343im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/81514bey2.jpeg" width="244" height="365"> <br> <i style=" width:244px; ;display:block"> Hail Goop (Getty Images)</i></div> NEW YORK, NY&#x2014;A cry rang out through Gothamist HQ. It was 12:49 p.m. It&apos;d been nearly 12 days since the last report from the front lines of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144343/http://gothamist.com/2014/08/03/your_questions_about_the_beyoncejay.php">Beyonce/Jay Z divorce rumors.</a> It was a Friday. <p></p>

<p>History will remember this wasn&apos;t just any Friday. It was a Friday that would live in infamy: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144343/http://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/beyonce-preparing-to-divorce-jay-z-she-is-done-2014158">&quot;<em>Exclusive</em>: Beyonce Preparing to Divorce Jay Z: &apos;She Is Done&apos;&quot;</a> screamed the glossy print magazine. We knew then that nothing would be the same. Nothing could be the same.</p>

<p>We scanned the 276 word article for details. They spilled forth like blood from the Rubicon. </p>

<blockquote>Insiders tell Us the music superstar, 32, has a plan of action in place for if/when she decides to call it quits with her rapper hubby, 44, dad to her 2-year-old daughter, Blue Ivy. One source says &quot;she is done&quot; after their remaining On The Run shows in Paris, France.</blockquote>

<p>We knew things were bad. We knew we shouldn&apos;t believe everything we read. But we also recently learned that Beyonce probably didn&apos;t even give birth to Blue Ivy <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144343/http://jezebel.com/some-lady-files-maternity-suit-against-beyonce-and-jay-1622121969?utm_campaign=socialflow_jezebel_facebook&amp;utm_source=jezebel_facebook&amp;utm_medium=socialflow">because some crazy woman is suing her</a> claiming she was the surrogate. The lack of Beyonce pregnancy photos is like the missing 18 minutes on the Nixon White House tapes. We don&apos;t know what to believe anymore.</p>

<p>Still. We were not ready for this jelly.</p>

<p>Things got worse from there:</p>

<blockquote>For more on Beyonce&apos;s marriage woes -- including details on her escape plan, her worries about what one source calls Jay Z&apos;s &quot;wandering eye,&quot; and how she&apos;s leaning on newly single pal Gwyneth Paltrow &#x2014; pick up the new issue of Us Weekly.</blockquote>

<p>Jay Z&apos;s wandering eye. The eye that sees all. The eye that judges all. The one eye for the one-world authoritarian government known as the New World Order. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144343/http://gothamist.com/tags/illuminati">All the pieces matter.</a></p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="81514jay1.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144343im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/81514jay1.jpeg" width="640" height="427"> <br> <i> One love, one New World Order (Getty Images)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>We couldn&apos;t decide what was worse: Beyonce consciously taking life advice from President Goop, or the thought of having to spend $4 to read more anonymous quotes about Beyonce&apos;s escape plan. </p>

<p>There is no escape from a world in which Beyonce and Jay Z are not crazy in love. </p>

<p>Not for us.</p>

<p>Then we realized there are other crises happening. Duty calls. Cara Delevingne was spotted <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144343/http://www.eonline.com/news/569747/cara-delevingne-steps-out-in-the-exact-same-pizza-jumpsuit-katy-perry-wore-see-the-pic">wearing the same pizza outfit as Katy Perry</a>. </p>

<p>Battles are lost, but the war rages on.</p>
