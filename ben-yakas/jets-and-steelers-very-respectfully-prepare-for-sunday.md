<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160921112453/http://gothamist.com/tags/jets">Jets</a> have been flying high (right past the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160921112453/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/city_heroes_fly_jet_green_D6x0EKh2InoFEUOUiwWW3K?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">Empire State Building</a>) this week since their impressive <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160921112453/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/16/jets_de-feet_pats.php">victory</a> over the New England Patriots last weekend. Now comes the build-up to this Sunday&apos;s AFC Championship Game with the Pittsburgh Steelers. But unlike last week&apos;s trash-talking funfest, things have been decidedly less hostile between the two sides.</p>

<p>While Sunday&apos;s game was a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160921112453/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/10/jets_v_patriots_is_also_personal_fo.php">&quot;personal&quot;</a> battle between Rex Ryan and his nemesis Bill Belichick, Ryan has taken on a decidedly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160921112453/http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jR-mA2mzXvYZXRTX5NvOn9uzU7DA?docId=56cc0736a4af4f4393639ea4432e5f02">different tone</a> this week, drawing parallels between himself and Steelers coach Mike Tomlin: &quot;You look at our backgrounds, we&apos;re similar. We&apos;re defensive guys. We both have incredible opportunities, we know that. I just want to win a Super Bowl like he has.&quot; Perhaps some of that has to do with the fact that the Jets <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160921112453/http://gothamist.com/2010/12/20/last_nights_action_giant_choke.php">beat</a> the Steelers just a few weeks ago in Pittsburgh. There was also much praise for Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger: &quot;He&apos;ll just stand there and then make plays down the field. I&apos;ve never seen a guy take the hits he can take and also make people miss the way he does and be as accurate on the run,&quot; said Ryan. Virile cornerback Antonio Cromartie, who called Pats QB Tom Brady an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160921112453/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/12/jets_resent_brady_giants_fans_resen.php">&quot;a-hole&quot;</a> last week, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160921112453/http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jR-mA2mzXvYZXRTX5NvOn9uzU7DA?docId=56cc0736a4af4f4393639ea4432e5f02">echoed</a> Ryan&apos;s statements: &quot;I love Ben man. Ben&apos;s a competitor.&quot;</p>

<p>One thing is for sure: thanks to last week&apos;s jubilant win, and now two consecutive appearances in the AFC Championships Game, NYC has Rex fever. People are embracing his loud-mouth style: &#x201C;Keep talking that trash the way you&#x2019;re doing&#x2019;. It&#x2019;s working. It&#x2019;s getting to them psychologically,&#x201D; said Johnny Villanueva of Teaneck, N.J. &#x201C;His freewheeling style; his playful style is freeing up the players, at least this group of players to perform to their fullest potential,&#x201D; sports psychotherapist Dr. Jay Granat, founder of &#x201C;Stay In The Zone,&#x201D; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160921112453/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2011/01/18/fans-jets-rex-may-indeed-be-crazy-like-a-fox/">told CBS</a>. Even Giants players love Rex: Giants safety Antrel Rolle said <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160921112453/http://fifthdown.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/01/19/are-giants-fans-rooting-for-jets/">in an interview</a> Monday, &#x201C;<strong>People like to talk about Rex Ryan, but that team is going to war for him. They would die for him</strong>...If you match us up against the Jets, do I think they&#x2019;re a better team? No, I don&#x2019;t think so at all. But when it comes to their chemistry, I think their chemistry might be better than ours. I think that they have a lot more fun than we have.&#x201D;</p>
