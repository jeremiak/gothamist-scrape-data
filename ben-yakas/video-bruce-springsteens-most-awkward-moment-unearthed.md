<p>Sweet fancy moses! <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505141747/http://gothamist.com/tags/brucespringsteen">Bruce Springsteen</a> has always seemed like one of the few rock and roll stars who can always maintain his cool, even when he&apos;s hanging out with John Kerry or photobombing people&apos;s wedding vows. But <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505141747/http://bubblingover1.blogspot.com/2011/07/bruce-springsteen-dancing-in-dark-music.html">in this raw footage</a> taken from the original &quot;Dancing In The Dark&quot; music video shoot, he looks like he&apos;s auditioning for a jazzercise tape. Watch the awkward footage below:</p>

<p>He doesn&apos;t know what to do with his arms! He&apos;s wearing suspenders! He looks like John Travolta auditioning for <em>Flashdance</em>! At least the Big Man, who shows up around the three minute mark, escapes the video unscathed&#x2014;that red suit is quite awesome. No wonder Springsteen rejected the footage when he saw the rushes, and hired Brian De Palma to film the Courtney Cox-gracing live video which became a huge mid-80s hit:</p>

<p>Overall in the raw footage, Springsteen resembles an all-American cross between <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505141747/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zS1cLOIxsQ8">Carlton</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505141747/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CE8XKeN0zk4">Jean Claude Van Damme</a>, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505141747/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQu_NLRvULM">Elaine Benes</a> with his moves: a full body dry heave set to music. But <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505141747/http://www.dangerousminds.net/comments/bruce_springsteen_in_a_video_hed_probably_prefer_you_didnt_see/">Dangerous Minds</a> looks on the bright side: at least &#x201C;Sweating In The Dark: New Jersey Aerobics with the E Street Muscle&#x201D; was never unleashed upon the world.</p>
