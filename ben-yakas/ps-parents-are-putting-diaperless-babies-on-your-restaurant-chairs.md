<p>If you hear parents patiently hissing at their baby next time you&apos;re enjoying the Philly Peppersteak Stickybuns at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504151154/http://gothamist.com/tags/thegeneral">the douchiest hot spot in lower Manhattan</a>, don&apos;t be alarmed&#x2014;those parents aren&apos;t trying to help their child avoid having an Indiana Jones-like aversion to snakes. They&apos;re just trying to make the baby go to the bathroom! </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504151154/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20130418/new-york-city/parents-ditching-diapers-potty-train-tots-sinks-city-streets">DNAInfo dives into the world</a> of &#x201C;elimination communication,&#x201D; aka au natural toilet training&#x2014;a phenomenon we already encountered <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504151154/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/10/photo_pooping_at_outdoor_cafe_is_ho.php">at a Pier i cafe recently.</a> The idea is that parents get used to the baby&apos;s cues for when they need to go to the toilet, instead of relying on a diaper. On the one hand, this eliminates problems like diaper rashes. On the other hand, there are the messes:</p>

<blockquote>The hope is for the parent to &#x201C;catch&#x201D; pees and poops &#x2014; whether atop open-cloth diapers, toilets, sinks or behind the multitude of parked cars on city streets.

<p>But as Partow learned, often there are &#x201C;misses.&#x201D;</p>

<p>&#x201C;I kept seeing him leave a trail of pee,&#x201D; Partow, 41, said of her son. &#x201C;The dog looked at me and said, &#x2018;This isn&#x2019;t fair. Why can he do that?&#x2019;&#x201D;</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>Parents often make the aforementioned hiss/siss noise (or grunts) when their baby goes to the bathroom in order to help them associate those sounds with feeling relieved. While it&apos;s fine for parents to do whatever they like with their kids in their own homes and on their own property, it brings up a question of what happens in truly public locations. Like, say, at a restaurant where other people are eating. Emergencies will happen, after all.</p>

<p>&#x201C;The other day we accidentally left the house without putting her in a diaper before going to a restaurant,&#x201D; said Sarah Longwell-Stevens, and early childhood educator and doula. &#x201C;We peed her on the sidewalk, but she wouldn&#x2019;t go. Then we tucked a pre-fold [cloth diaper] under her [at the restaurant table]. We were in a place where we didn&#x2019;t want her to go and we didn&#x2019;t want people talking about it.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Other problems with the practice: the availability of toilets in the city. One mom said that at parks and playgrounds, &#x201C;finding a little area of grass or some bushes was good. I&#x2019;ve not owned a dog in the city, but I can relate.&quot; Then there are those babies who don&apos;t find a park area to go in time, and instead pee in the streets&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504151154/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/18/nyc_restroom_public_urination.php">something we were just talking about earlier today.</a></p>

<p>At the same time, as long as people are respectful of public spaces and other humans and remember that their child is not a puppy, let the Bedford-Stuyvesant lawyers-turned-Reiki healers do what they want to do. But you now what <em>is</em> not okay? Putting up multiple galleries of very graphic photos of babies on the internet. Is it just us, or is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504151154/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20130418/new-york-city/parents-ditching-diapers-potty-train-tots-sinks-city-streets">sharing your child&apos;s baby junk on the world wide web</a> seem like a pretty terrible idea?</p>
