<p>Between the flu, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502142055/http://gothamist.com/2014/03/11/measles_brooklyn.php">measles</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502142055/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/11/terrible_news_bedbugs_with_staph_su.php">staph superbugs</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502142055/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/21/sign_of_the_apocalypse_gonorrhea_be.php">gonorrhea superbugs</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502142055/http://gothamist.com/2014/03/12/lizard_in_salad_thinspo.php">lizard heads</a>, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502142055/http://gothamist.com/2014/03/14/kiss_vandals.php">KISS-loving vandals</a>, we have more than enough to worry about this week. We really don&apos;t need anything more, thanks. <em>Having said that</em>, here&apos;s one more thing to worry about: a new strain of &apos;super lice&apos; has made its way to our area. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502142055/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2014/03/13/parents-worried-over-new-strains-of-treatment-resistant-super-lice/">According to CBS</a>, the new strain of lice apparently has a stubborn resistance to traditional chemical treatments, and they&apos;re starting to show up in area schools. &quot;Lice isn&#x2019;t dangerous, but it is very, very contagious. And it can be very itchy and annoying for our patients,&quot; said Dr. Allison Driansky, of Cohen Children&#x2019;s Hospital. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502142055/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/03/11/super-lice-resistant-to-treatments_n_4942080.html">Super lice</a> has already decimated our brothers and sisters up north: the strain <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502142055/http://news.nationalpost.com/2014/03/12/super-lice-on-verge-of-conquering-canadian-scalps-as-mutant-parasites-develop-immunity-to-insecticides/">constitutes 97.1% of Canadian head lice cases</a>. It seems that the entire country has basically given up on fighting these blood-sucking overlords: &#x201C;You will kill some lice, leaving the more resistant lice to breed and create more resistant lice,&quot; said J. Marshall Clark, the author of a recent study on the super lice.</p>

<p>But wait, wait, it gets worse: the invasion is over before we even realized it started. According to a study out of the University of Massachusetts, super lice rates in the US are currently standing at 99.6%. The only safe havens left in the country: &quot;a remote Texas town and a Navajo Indian reservation.&quot; Guess we don&apos;t have the security clearance level to know exactly which Texas town has staved off the wingless beast.</p>

<p>So there&apos;s no hope, whether you already have it or not; soon we will all be lousy with lice. And there&apos;s absolutely no way to combat the creatures... except of course if you have access to tweezers and a comb. But dear god, then you&apos;ll need to find the time to pick them out one by one. We&apos;re already losing our ongoing war against time, and your roommate has been hogging the tweezers for months, and death is inevitable anyway, so why even bother.</p>

<p>On the bright side, at least we&apos;re not being invaded by bionic rats...yet.</p>
