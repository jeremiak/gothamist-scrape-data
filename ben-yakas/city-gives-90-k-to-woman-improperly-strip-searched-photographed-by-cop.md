										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="111111cop.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150416005108im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/111111cop.jpg" width="225" height="259" class="image-left"> </span>A Brooklyn woman who claimed that an NYPD officer improperly strip searched her and took intimate photos of her with his cell phone <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150416005108/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/woman-claims-forced-strip-improper-search-90k-article-1.976072">will receive a $90,000 settlement</a> from the city. Claudia Bova, 25, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150416005108/http://gothamist.com/2009/12/17/brooklyn_cop_accused_of_taking_cell.php">was arrested in</a> a Coney Island drug sweep in June 2007, and says that Officer Charles Derosalia, who has been accused <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150416005108/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/24/18_women_accuse_cop_of_illegal_stri.php">by 17 other women</a> of illegal strip searches, took several photos of a tattoo below her navel. &#x201C;Detective Derosalia victimized women who were in his custody and control. <strong>He victimized them in police precincts, right under the noses of his supervisors</strong>,&#x201D; said Bova&apos;s lawyer, Nicole Bellina.</p>

<p>Derosalia, a Long Island resident who worked with the Brooklyn South narcotics team, was found guilty of violating an NYPD policy prohibiting cross-gender searches, and the recommended penalty is dismissal from the force. Under the settlement, the city will pay Bova $75,000 and Derosalia must pay $15,000.</p>

<p>Bova had claimed that Derosalia had led her to the bathroom and ordered her to lift up her shirt, &quot;shake out her bra&quot; and pull down her pants&#x2014;and says she was forced to take her clothes off in the bathroom two more times. The first was so he could take photos with his cell phone&#x2014;and when he said those photos didn&apos;t come out right, he forced her to go through the process all over again. </p>

<p>Another woman, Quantalis Legrand, came forward after Bova, claiming Derosalia &quot;watched her change out of pajamas into street clothes, exposing her breasts and panties to him in the bedroom of her Avenue X apartment.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150416005108/http://articles.nydailynews.com/2010-09-25/local/27076339_1_improper-strip-searches-cop-detectives">She said she was fondled</a> by him, and couldn&apos;t sleep after the incident. None of the other women have accused Derosalia of touching them inappropriately&#x2014;just leering at them while they took off their clothes. </p>
