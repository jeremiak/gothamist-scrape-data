<p>After two teens <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130429055038/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/22/two_teens_arrested_for_making_video.php">were arrested yesterday</a>, a third 14-year-old <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130429055038/http://awalkintheparknyc.blogspot.com/2013/02/police-arrest-3rd-teen-in-connection.html">has been arrested and charged</a> with endangering the welfare of child in regards to a video showing two younger girls <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130429055038/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/19/video_little_girls_forced_to_fight.php">being forced to fight in a Bronx park</a>. The video, which was shot about 4:15 p.m. on Jan. 3 in Edgar Allen Poe Park, shows a group of teenagers forcing two girls to fight for the cameras. &#x201C;Those two teenagers were egging them on,&#x201D; said NYPD spokesman Paul J. Browne. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s callous and disturbing and exploitive of two little girls.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Two of the teens arrested are 14, and the third is 15; police added that at least one other teen was still being questioned. Police said the fight stemmed from a fight between two of the older girls over candy; investigators believe one of the 14-year-olds had posted the video on her Facebook page. </p>

<p>After Gothamist published the video and shared it with authorities on Tuesday, the ensuing media attention prompted the mother of one of the 7-year-old girls to come forward. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130429055038/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/23/nyregion/a-video-of-fighting-7-year-olds-leads-to-2-arrests.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">She told cops she believed</a> the teens had intentionally pushed the girls to fight in hopes of creating a video that would go viral on World Star Hip Hop. </p>
