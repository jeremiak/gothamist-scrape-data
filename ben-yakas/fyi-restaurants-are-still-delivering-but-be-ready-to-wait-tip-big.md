<p>Mayor Bloomberg wants you to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505135216/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/29/mayor_bloomberg_says_remain_in_your.php">sit tight and have a sandwich</a> while we all wait out the incoming <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505135216/http://gothamist.com/tags/frankenstorm">FRANKENSTORM</a> that has already started drowning parts of the city. But what if you don&apos;t have the right sourdough bread? What if you ran out of fresh truffle shavings? What if you don&apos;t have any backup Grey Poupon?? Well don&apos;t worry: there are still a surprising amount of restaurants that are delivering despite the storm. You just better be ready to wait a bit&#x2014;and ready to compensate them properly for going out in this:</p>

<p>First of all, places will (hopefully, for their own sakes) stop delivering more and more as we get closer to Hurricane Sandy&apos;s touchdown, so if you really need food and your local grocery is all used up, you really should order soon. You can check out who is still delivering in your neighborhood <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505135216/http://www.seamless.com/">via Seamless</a>&#x2014;they acknowledge that some places may have closed without saying anything, and if so, you should email care@seamless.com to let them know. They also have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505135216/http://blog.seamless.com/2012/10/hurricane-sandy-seamless-food-ordering/">some tips about</a> staying patient, saying estimated delivery times may be off&#x2014;just about every place we looked up has at least an hour to two hour delivery times.</p>

<p>We strongly suggest that you give <strong>a very generous tip</strong> to anyone who is open, as well. Thanks to our own unscientific Twitter poll, we can say that these places are still open: Kings Wok in Crown Heights; Sunset Park Diner; Forest Hills Bagels; and Cafecito in East Village. Also, for what it&apos;s worth, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505135216/https://twitter.com/arojass/status/262983099460243456">Alejandro Rojas tweets</a>: &quot;168 restaurants still delivering to my zone A apt in Kips Bay...&quot;</p>
