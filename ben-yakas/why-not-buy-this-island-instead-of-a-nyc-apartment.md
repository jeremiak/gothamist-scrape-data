title: Why Not Buy This Island Instead Of A NYC Apartment?

										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="11713island.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405023024im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/11713island.jpg" width="640" height="468"> <br> <i> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405023024/http://www.homeswing.com/property/1-Willow-Island-Patterson-NY-12563/77-762772">via</a></i></div> <p></p>

<p>We already know that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405023024/http://gothamist.com/tags/rent">housing prices</a> in NYC&#x2014;especially in Manhattan and Brooklyn&#x2014;are obscene. More likely than not, there are more places <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405023024/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/30/interactive_map_where_is_the_afford.php">you can&apos;t afford to live in than you can at this point</a>. You can literally find <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405023024/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/30/extra_extra_2669.php">Scottish castles</a> at better prices than NYC property. But if that seems a little decadent for your tastes, here&apos;s another option: you can buy a small island in upstate NY! </p>

<p>Willow Island on Putnam Lake in Patterson, a three-story, four-bedroom home, costs just $995,000, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405023024/http://nypost.com/2013/11/06/private-island-costs-less-than-the-average-nyc-apartment/">the Post reports today</a>. For your own private <em>island</em>. That&apos;s cheaper than <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405023024/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/03/couple_spend_1_million_to_live_in_b.php">some places in Bed-Stuy</a>! For more perspective: the average price of a two-bedroom Manhattan apartment is $1.35 million, and $2.63&#x2009;million for a three-bedroom.</p>

<p>The house on the one-acre property, which is located about two hours away from the city, was built by one of the engineers who created the Holland Tunnel. There&apos;s a floor-to-ceiling stone fireplace, an artesian well, 48 open-view windows, a guest cottage, and a garage for your boat...because you have to row out to get to the home. &quot;Access is a quick five minute by a rowing boat or 5 mph electric motor boats,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405023024/http://www.elliman.com/putnam/1-willow-island-patterson-xelekfq">it says in the listing</a>. But hey, they throw in a free garage for your car on the mainland as well.</p>

<p>We can&apos;t imagine why <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405023024/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/06/breaking_young_americans_are_broke.php">you wouldn&apos;t jump at an opportunity to buy this property ASAP.</a></p>
