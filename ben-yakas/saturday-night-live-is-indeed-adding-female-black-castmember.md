<p>Yesterday we found out that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422202447/http://gothamist.com/tags/snl"><em>Saturday Night Live</em></a> has been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422202447/http://gothamist.com/2013/12/12/saturday_night_live_held_secret_aud.php">quietly auditioning black female comedians</a> recently in response to the criticisms about the lack of diversity in the new cast. Lorne Michaels confirmed that the show is indeed planning on hiring a new castmember in January: &#x201C;All told we&#x2019;ve seen about 25 people,&#x201D; Michaels <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422202447/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/13/business/media/snl-to-add-black-female-cast-member-in-january.html?ref=arts&amp;_r=0">told the Times</a>. &#x201C;A lot of the people we saw are really good. Hopefully we&#x2019;ll come out of the process well.&#x201D; </p>

<p>Michaels said he is open to adding up to two new castmembers, and that there had been multiple secret auditions, including ones in LA and NYC. Michaels didn&apos;t say that these auditions were specifically due to the criticisms, but did acknowledge that it was &#x201C;100 percent good for the show to have an African-American woman&#x201D; in the cast. He insisted this was all about finding someone who is versatile: &#x201C;We&#x2019;re all about talent. It doesn&#x2019;t help if somebody&#x2019;s not ready &#x2014; and &#x2018;ready&#x2019; is one of the charged words. But you want to be sure you give people the best possible shot.&#x201D;</p>

<p>He said he couldn&apos;t recall a time that the show has added someone mid-season before, but it&apos;s not unusual to bring new featured player aboard toward the end of the season&#x2014;this difference next year is that NBC&#x2019;s coverage of the Winter Olympics in February will pre-empt two editions of the show. </p>

<p>At least one of the SNL hopefuls who tried out in LA was a bit skeptical about how serious the show was: comedian Tiffany Haddish <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422202447/http://www.tmz.com/2013/12/13/saturday-night-live-snl-audition-black-female-comedians-publicity-stunt/">told TMZ</a> that the LA audition on December 2nd felt like &apos;a dog and pony show&apos; because Michaels wasn&apos;t there in person. Haddish thinks &quot;they already know who they want ... they&apos;re just wasting all these black women&apos;s time and gas money.&quot; In which case, that may mean good things for Darmirra Brunson, who already <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422202447/http://www.bustle.com/articles/6073-jay-pharoah-thinks-saturday-night-live-needs-to-hire-a-woman-of-color-hes-completely">has a fan in castmember Jay Pharoah.</a></p>
