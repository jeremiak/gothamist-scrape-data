<p>In December, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140423143655/http://gothamist.com/2013/12/07/newlywed_couple_arrested_for_allege.php">a newlywed Pennsylvania couple were arrested and accused of killing</a> a man they met on Craigslist to celebrate their three-week wedding anniversary and fulfill a longtime fantasy. Elytte Barbour, 22, and wife Miranda Barbour, 19, were charged in the murder of 42-year-old Troy LaFerrara, who they allegedly met via a Craigslist ad offering companionship. Now, Miranda Barbour is claiming that she has killed over 22 other people. &quot;When I hit 22, I stopped counting,&quot; she <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140423143655/http://www.dailyitem.com/0100_news/x1708329322/BODY-COUNT-AT-22/?state=taberU">told The Daily Item</a> from jail. &quot;I feel it is time to get all of this out. I don&apos;t care if people believe me. I just want to get it out.&quot;</p>

<p>Miranda requested the interview with the paper, as prosecutors have been seeking the death penalty for her and her husband in the murder of LaFerrara. &quot;He said the wrong things and then things got out of control,&quot; she said about LaFerrara, who she agreed to have sex with for $100 last November. &quot;I can tell you he was not supposed to be stabbed. My husband was just supposed to strangle him.&quot;</p>

<p>In the interview, Miranda claims that she was sexually molested by a relative at 4, and started killing people at 13 after she joined a satanic cult in Alaska. She claims the majority of the murders happened in Alaska, but there were also ones in Texas, North Carolina and California, which she can &quot;pinpoint on a map where you can find them.&quot;</p>

<p>She didn&apos;t go into many other details about the other alleged murders (she says in the first one, the cult leader &quot;took his hands and put them on top of mine and we pulled the trigger&quot;) but she said, &quot;I would lure these people in...I studied them. I learned them and even became their friend. I did this to people who did bad things and didn&#x2019;t deserve to be here anymore.&quot; </p>

<p>Sunbury police Chief Steve Mazzeo <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140423143655/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/craigslist-killer-miranda-barbour-ive-killed-22-more-as-part-of-satanic-cult-9131877.html">said that</a> investigators have been in contact with the FBI and law enforcement in several other states about her claims: &quot;From information we gathered and from information gathered from her interview we are seriously concerned and have been in contact with the proper authorities,&quot; Mazzeo said.</p>

<p>Miranda also said that this was her husband&apos;s first murder, and she hasn&apos;t seen him since their incarceration. &quot;I know I will never see my husband again and I have accepted that,&quot; she added. &quot;I know I wanted to talk about all this because I know I had a 20-year window where I would possibly get out of jail and I don&#x2019;t want that to happen. <strong>If I were to be released, I would do this again.&quot;</strong></p>
