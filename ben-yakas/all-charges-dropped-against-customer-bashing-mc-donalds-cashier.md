<p>McIntosh, who served ten years for the manslaughter death of a friend in 2000, had been charged with felony assault and criminal possession of a weapon for using the metal rod to hit Denise Darbeau and Rachel Edwards; Darbeau&apos;s skull was fractured, and she may have brain damage. The fight started when Darbeau tried to pay for their food with a $50 bill, and McIntosh wanted to check the authenticity, as was store policy. The two women <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140805063838/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/19/mcdonalds_beating_victim_allegedly.php">allegedly taunted McIntosh</a>, calling him a &quot;bitch ass n--ga,&quot; and saying &quot;your mother&apos;s a bitch.&quot; </p>

<p>McIntosh <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140805063838/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/22/customer-bashing_mcdonalds_cashier_1.php">said in an interview that</a> Darbeau spat at him, threatened to &quot;cut me up,&quot; came across the counter and slapped him. When Edwards jumped across to join in, McIntosh says instinct kicked in: &quot;I was being attacked by aggressive people I didn&apos;t know,&quot; said McIntosh. &quot;I was just defending myself. They came in and went crazy on me.&quot; You can see the rest of the incident play out in the video below:</p>

<p>Harold Baker, the lawyer for one of Darbeau, said the grand jury&apos;s decision was &quot;not morally justified, or legally acceptable.&quot; He added: &quot;We&apos;re shocked and dismayed that this vicious criminal&apos;s charges are being dismissed. It&apos;s a miscarriage of justice.&quot;</p>
