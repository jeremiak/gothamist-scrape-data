Chuck Schumer, a long-time advocate of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120119125049/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/16/sen_schumer_calls_for_rational_gun-.php">&quot;rational gun-control laws,&quot;</a> is putting his legislative money where his mouth is when it comes to gun laws: he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120119125049/http://online.wsj.com/article/AP602fe21c36ca428892c3288da03f1e79.html">told reporters</a> that he is drafting legislation to require all gun buyers to undergo a thorough background check. And he wants to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120119125049/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/2011/02/23/2011-02-23_states_that_balk_at_nations_gun_laws_could_lose_federal_funds_schumer.html">increase penalties</a> to any states that don&apos;t contribute names to the national background-check system. <p></p>

<p>Schumer presented his plan, which he said was modeled after the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120119125049/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/24/bloomberg_really_wants_congress_to.php">proposals</a> of Mayor Bloomberg&apos;s national <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120119125049/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/16/mayor_bloomberg_kicks_off_anti-ille.php">gun-control coalition</a>, at Manhattan police headquarters yesterday. Schumer was inspired into action after the tragic shooting in Tucson, Arizona <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120119125049/http://gothamist.com/tags/jaredleeloughner">last month</a>, which left six people dead and 14 others injured: &quot;All we&apos;re talking about here is making sure that certain individuals who demonstrated violent behavior in the past, who have documented mental illness, who could be inclined to terrorism, or who have a history of drug abuse, don&apos;t get a weapon,&quot; Schumer said.</p>

<p>According to the AP, more than half the states are not complying with a law requiring them to share the names of mentally ill people with the national background-check system. In addition to tougher background checks and penalties for non-compliant states, the legislation <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120119125049/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703842004576162822630403338.html?mod=googlenews_wsj">will close</a> the so-called gun-show loophole by requiring even private sellers to perform background checks. There are more than 37,000 people <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120119125049/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/20/the_faces_of_gun_ownership_in_the_c.php">licensed</a> to have a handgun in the city, including several notable celebrities, politicians and prominent businessmen. At least we know that if need be, Sen. Schumer is prepared to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120119125049/http://gothamist.com/2009/12/23/road_to_health_care_reform_went_thr.php">grab his shotgun</a> to get this legislation passed.</p>
