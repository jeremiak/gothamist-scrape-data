<p>It&apos;s time to brush up on your <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111223135359/http://www.glyphweb.com/ARDA/">Encyclopedia of Arda</a>: the trailer for <em>The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey</em>,  the highly anticipated first part of Peter Jackson&apos;s two-part <em>Lord of the Rings</em> prequel, is here! And don&apos;t worry: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111223135359/http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/nl0he/this_comment_was_on_the_hobbit_trailer/">anonymous YouTube commenters are already on top of it</a>: &quot;This is such an obvious LOTR ripoff, please tell me this is a joke. It even looks like the same actor plays the wizard...has Hollywood honestly come to this?&quot;</p>

<p>The movie, which charts hobbit Bilbo Baggins&apos;s adventures years before the events of <em>LOTR</em>, feature plenty of shots of returning stars from the first trilogy, including the aforementioned wizard Gandalf the Grey (Ian McKellen), Galadriel (Cate Blanchett) and Gollum (Andy Serkis). Martin Freeman plays the titular character Bilbo, who seems to fit in perfectly at The Shire, as well as amongst a lot of light-hearted dwarves. The movie comes out next December, but we&apos;ll be re-reading the stories well before then; after all, how embarrassing would it be if we couldn&apos;t tell the difference <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111223135359/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/08/is_this_the_greatest_ny_times_corre.php">between Orcrist th&#x435; Goblin Ax and Sting?</a></p>
