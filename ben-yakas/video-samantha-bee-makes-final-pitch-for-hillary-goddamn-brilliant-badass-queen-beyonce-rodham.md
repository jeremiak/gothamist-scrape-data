<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170925123514/http://gothamist.com/tags/samanthabee">Samantha Bee</a> has emerged as one of the best voices of clarity during the election cycle, and she made one last impassioned pitch on behalf of Hillary Rodham Clinton last night, taking a deep dive into how America has caused her to become aloof over a lifetime of public service. Bee recounts the exact moment Clinton learned her &quot;Resting Fuck The Press Face,&quot; the many times she was let down by her husband (a &quot;hillbilly&quot; with a &quot;wandering dick&quot;), and the compromises of her own political ambitions and beliefs that have now made her less likable, to a certain portion of the population, than a &quot;vindictive pussy-grabbing hate-Zamboni who jokes about killing his enemies.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hillary Clinton has spent the past 40 years learning to mask her authenticity, ever since the so-called &apos;Natural State&apos; couldn&apos;t accept a normal human woman in <em>her</em> natural state, with her own name and her brown hair and identity independent from the dude she was boning,&quot; Bee says in the clip below. &quot;Don&apos;t expect Grandma to pivot on a dime now that authenticity is suddenly cool. Look, if you can&apos;t bring yourself to vote for Hillary Clinton, I get it. I&apos;m not voting for Hillary Clinton either. I&apos;m voting for Hillary Goddamn Brilliant Badass Queen Beyonc&#xE9; Rodham. I have a hunch she&apos;s still in there.&quot;</p>

<p>Bee also enlisted new intern Sarah Paulson to do a dramatic reading of Clinton&apos;s &quot;most batshit boring emails.&quot;</p>
