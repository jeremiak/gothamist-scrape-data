<p>A tipster forwarded this photo to us today&#x2014;you can see the full blown NSFW photo <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160320001837/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/31013naked1.jpg">by clicking this GRAPHIC link</a> if you&apos;re interested. Details about the photo were scant, though quick (albeit not <em>comprehensive</em>) Google and Tin Eye searches leads us to believe this is a new photo. If you have any first-hand knowledge as to what was going on here, or any guesses as to where his MetroCard might be, we&apos;d love to know.</p>

<p>Oh and if you&apos;re squinting at the full-blown NSFW photo and wondering what that shiny looking thing is, it&apos;s called a &quot;balls stretcher.&quot; Since it&apos;s <em>exactly</em> what it sounds like, we&apos;d strongly, <em>strongly</em> advise you don&apos;t look that up on Google&#x2014;especially if you&apos;re planning on eating kielbasa anytime soon.<br>
