And then there is elusive, magical, perfectly legal toplessness: this week, a woman, since nicknamed &quot;Topless Bowery Woman,&quot; took a causal stroll in lower Manhattan sans shirt in the sweltering heat&#x2014;here&apos;s a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160309193352/http://othelogervacio.tumblr.com/post/6252464412/so-what-its-hot-outside">NSFW pic of her</a>. And while most <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160309193352/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2002150/Mystery-Topless-Bowery-Woman-pictured-walking-TOPLESS-New-York.html">seemed amused</a> by her exercising her right to do so, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160309193352/http://www.boweryboogie.com/2011/06/topless-woman-takes-afternoon-stroll-along-bowery/">Bowery Boogie reports</a> that the woman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160309193352/http://twitter.com/#!/olidub/status/77782865068310528">was stopped</a> and issued a fine by cops...which <em>is</em> illegal.<p></p>

<p>According to the original <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160309193352/http://ypdcrime.com/penal.law/article245.htm">NY State Penal Code</a>:</p>

<blockquote>Exposure of a person. A person is guilty of exposure if he appears in a public place in such a manner that the private or intimate parts of his body are unclothed or exposed. For purposes of this section, the private or intimate parts of a female person shall include that portion of the breast which is below the top of the areola.</blockquote>

<p>However, the NY State Appeals Court <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160309193352/http://gothamist.com/2007/06/17/bare_breast_lan.php">ruled in 1992</a> that exposure of a bare female breast violates this law <em>only</em> when it takes place in a commercial context. In 2005, police arrested Jill Coccaro and held her for 12 hours for walking around topless. She sued, and the city eventually settled the incident for $29,000, or $14,500 per breast.</p>

<p>In addition, women celebrate their legal right to walk around the city topless every year on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160309193352/http://gothamist.com/2010/08/22/photos_nsfw_of_topless_day_protest.php#photo-1">&quot;National Go Topless Day.&quot;</a> So unless the mysterious &quot;Topless Bowery Woman&quot; was handing out coupons for the buffet special at the West Side Gentleman&apos;s Club, she wasn&apos;t breaking any laws. Although, maybe cops were worried that by flouting society&apos;s conventions, she might cause a car accident:</p>
