<p>In case you&apos;re not familiar with ATLAH Worldwide Missionary Church, which was established in Harlem back in 1957, it is essentially a slightly less controversial Westboro Baptist Church of NYC. It&apos;s true that ATLAH hasn&apos;t quite stooped to the level of, say, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150702151954/http://www.kval.com/news/local/Westboro-Baptist-Church-plans-protest-at-soldiers-funeral-228410181.html">protesting veterans&apos; funerals</a>, but it has served as a mouthpiece for raging bigot Dr. James David Manning, who has spent the past six years ranting about Obama. And Manning went on a particularly vile rant this week, as you can see in the video below (all of which inspired the sign in the photo above).</p>

<p>To summarize: Manning is angry at Obama for releasing &quot;homo demons&quot; upon the black community in order to steer them away from black women because Obama has a very complicated, very evil plan to destroy the black community. Besides the fact that he refers to Brooklyn Nets&apos; Jason Collins as an &quot;alleged&quot; basketball player, our favorite part is his description of the &quot;white homosexual male:&quot; </p>

<blockquote>But black women, let me say something to you: you&apos;ll have a very hard time competing against a white homosexual male. He usually has got money, a white homo usually has an American Express card...homos love the theater, they love to go out to dinners, parties, they love that kind of a thing! And as a black woman, you can&apos;t compete!</blockquote>

<p>Manning also notes that he&apos;s a big supporter of the Ugandan and Nigerian <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150702151954/http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/africa/ugandan-leader-signs-harsh-anti-gay-bill-despite-warning-from-obama-administration/2014/02/24/88486066-9d63-11e3-878c-65222df220eb_story.html">anti-gay laws</a>, because of course he is. Bill de Blasio better watch out, because <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150702151954/http://atlah.org/2013/12/06/troubling-days-in-new-york-city-under-bill-de-blasio/">it&apos;s only a matter of time</a> before he incurs the wrath of Manning.</p>

<p>Until then, enjoy some of Manning&apos;s greatest hits, because laughter can sometimes be a pretty effective medicine.</p>
