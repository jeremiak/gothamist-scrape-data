<p>A Bronx teen <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502180520/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/uptown/teen-caught-cheating-exam-disappears-hudson-river-article-1.1812226">is believed to have committed suicide</a> this week after she was caught cheating on a high school exam. Omotayo Adeoye, 17, gave her belongings to a stranger about 3:50 p.m. Thursday, then jumped into Hudson River Greenway near W. 163rd Street. Sources <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502180520/http://nypost.com/2014/05/30/teen-student-jumps-to-death-after-shes-caught-cheating/">tell the Post that</a> she wrote a suicide note on her German-language exam after she was caught cheating by her teacher: &quot;I just want to go away forever on the bottom of the river.&quot;</p>

<p>The Post reports that Adeoye was caught looking at her cellphone on Thursday during the exam by her teacher, Eva Malikova, at the Harlem High School for Math, Science and Engineering. A male classmate gave them a rundown of what happened in the classroom, which the Post says was confirmed by law-enforcement officials:</p>

<blockquote>&#x201C;She snatched it away from her and started screaming at her, &#x2018;Oh, you shouldn&#x2019;t be cheating! You guys shouldn&#x2019;t be cheating! You guys are lying to yourselves!&#x2019;&#x2009;&#x201D;

<p>Adeoye burst into tears, sobbing, &#x201C;I&#x2019;m sorry! I&#x2019;m sorry!&#x201D;</p>

<p>&#x201C;Oh, you are not really sorry,&#x201D; Malikova allegedly snapped back. &#x201C;That&#x2019;s not a sincere apology!&#x201D;</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>A Department of Education spokeswoman said, &quot;We are conducting an investigation into this tragic incident, and we are taking immediate action.&quot; Witnesses told the Post and News that Adeoye appeared to be &quot;forcing herself down;&quot; her father later told cops that she can&apos;t swim. No body has been recovered yet, and police are still investigating.</p>
