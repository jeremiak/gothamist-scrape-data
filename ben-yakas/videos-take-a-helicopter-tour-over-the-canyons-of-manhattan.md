<p>Sometimes it&apos;s hard to focus on how aesthetically beautiful the city can be when you&apos;re stuck making eye contact with jerks <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504125525/http://gothamist.com/tags/subwayetiquette">popping pimples on the subway.</a> But nothing is better for a fresh perspective of the sublime, urban canyons and valleys of Manhattan than a helicopter ride.
