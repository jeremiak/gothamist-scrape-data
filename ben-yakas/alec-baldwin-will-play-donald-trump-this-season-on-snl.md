<p>Will Ferrell as George W. Bush. Darrell Hammond as Bill Clinton. Tina Fey as Sarah Palin. Kate McKinnon as Hillary Clinton. Larry David as Bernie Sanders. And now, we may be adding Alec Baldwin as Donald Trump to the pile of classic SNL political impressions, with the show announcing in the video below that Baldwin will step into Trump&apos;s shoes this election season.</p>

<p>Baldwin, who has guest-hosted a record 16 times since his debut in 1990, will make his debut as Trump in the SNL season premiere this Saturday, and will appear as Trump throughout the entire season (or as long as Trump remains in the news) according <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022041300/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/alec-baldwin-snl-new-donald-trump-933435">to The Hollywood Reporter.</a></p>

<p>In a May 2016 interview with Ellen DeGeneres, Baldwin said, &quot;We don&apos;t really want a president who looks like he&apos;s been dipped in movie popcorn butter.&quot; He also recently <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022041300/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/the-filter/alec-baldwin-trump-is-the-first-presidential-candidate-made-of-h/">told The Telegraph</a> that Trump is &quot;the first candidate made of hate.&quot;</p>

<p>Last season, Taran Killam was given a chance to play Trump early on, but he was yanked out in favor of Darrell Hammond, who has been playing Trump on SNL for the better part of 20 years. But after hired gun Larry David killed it last season playing Bernie, it seems the show wants to keep its political casting streak going with someone with a slightly more fiery take on politics. (And unfortunately, the world may never get a taste <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022041300/http://uproxx.com/tv/beck-bennett-donald-trump-snl/">of Beck Bennett&apos;s impression</a>.)</p>

<p>Does Baldwin look more like Trump than those other performers? No, not really&#x2014;but the best impressions capture the mannerisms and tone of the person more than anything else. And Baldwin has always been at his best at SNL, from going camping with Canteen Boy to Schweddy Balls to impersonating Charles Nelson Reilly. </p>

<p>SNL hit a rather major snag last season when the powers-that-be made the decision to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022041300/http://gothamist.com/2015/11/08/donald_trump_snl_terrible_terrible_terrible.php#photo-1">invite Trump to host the show</a> for what turned out to be the worst episode of recent years, an episode in which the comedy was completely was off and everyone involved looked uncomfortable. SNL (and NBC) have routinely been criticized since then for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022041300/http://www.vulture.com/2016/09/sam-bee-calls-out-nbc-and-jimmy-fallon-on-trump.html">&quot;normalizing&quot; Trump</a> to a mass audience (whether a mass audience actually watches SNL anymore is harder to argue, but there&apos;s no doubt it still has a major cultural footprint). </p>

<p>After that unfortunate episode, the writers and performers slowly started jabbing at Trump harder and harder as last season progressed, culminating in many excellent Weekend Update segments. It&apos;s going to be especially interesting to see how the thin-skinned Donald reacts to his latest impersonator.</p>
