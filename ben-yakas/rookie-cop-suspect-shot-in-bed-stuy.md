<p>A police officer and a suspect were both shot in Bed-Stuy early this morning. According to police, the shooting happened around 2:30 a.m. in the vicinity of Marcus Garvey Boulevard and Monroe Street. Plainclothes police officers observed the 22-year-old suspect &quot;adjusting his waistband,&quot; which led to a chase through the neighborhood.</p>

<p>With the officers in pursuit, the suspect ran into uniformed Officer John Hirschberger, 28, who was assigned to foot patrol on Marcus Garvey Blvd and Gates Avenue. The suspect shot him in the left thigh. Hirschberger, who was assigned to the 79th Precinct less than a year ago, was taken to Kings County Hospital in stable condition.</p>

<p>&quot;I saw a guy running down the street and then I heard shots and saw the cop fall in the middle of the street,&quot; a witness <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150409161633/http://www.nydailynews.com/blogs/theshack/breaking-shot-brooklyn-blog-entry-1.1922901">told the News</a>. &quot;He was shot. And the other officers chased after him shooting.&quot; </p>

<p>The suspect, whose name hasn&apos;t been release yet, was shot by other officers in the torso; he was taken to Kings County in critical but stable condition. Charges are pending. </p>
