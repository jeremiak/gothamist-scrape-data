<p>As he stated before the start of the new season of <em>Last Week Tonight</em>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170706173620/http://gothamist.com/tags/johnoliver">John Oliver</a> doesn&apos;t want to cover Donald Trump <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170706173620/http://gothamist.com/2017/02/07/john_oliver_is_trying_to_avoid_a_tr.php">every week</a>&#x2014;but when Trump is pulling the U.S. out of the Paris climate change agreement, what choice do you have? After showing a clip of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170706173620/http://gothamist.com/2017/06/01/trump_paris_accord_climate.php">Trump&apos;s speech last week</a> explaining that the initial celebration surrounding the signing of the agreement left the US at &quot;a very very big economic disadvantage,&quot; Oliver responded, &quot;What are you talking about? They were happy because they secured a landmark victory for the future of the planet, you f*cking egomaniac. The whole world is not secretly conspiring against the United States.&quot;</p>

<p>Moreover, major American businesses weren&apos;t just in favor of the agreement&#x2014;they actively tried to change Trump&apos;s mind by putting a full-page ad in the NY Times arguing in favor of the deal. &quot;Well c&apos;mon, he was clearly never going to be convinced by an ad in the NY Times,&quot; Oliver said. &quot;How was he going to see it? If those companies really wanted to get his attention, they needed to talk KFC into putting out a full bucket ad which he would read on the toilet while eating chicken, because that, at its core, is who our president is.&quot;</p>

<p>Watch below, as Oliver patiently refutes Trump&apos;s reasons for leaving the agreement and stresses the importance of the deal, while dismantling Trump&apos;s &quot;ludicrous misunderstanding&quot; of the accord. &quot;Be Our Guest&quot; gets an update along the way, and Oliver figures out the fatal flaw of the agreement: &quot;[Paris Climate Agreement] as a title is so off-brand for him, it might as well have been called the Globalist Cuck Surrender or a light jog.&quot;</p>
