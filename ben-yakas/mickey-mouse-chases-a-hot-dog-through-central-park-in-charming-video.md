<p>Usually when we write about Mickey Mouse, it ends up involving <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151224195742/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/25/unknown_pleasures_disney_discontinu.php">British post-punk t-shirts</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151224195742/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/07/wtf_eli_manning_already_had_a_parad.php#photo-1">Eli Manning.</a> But the charming animated short video below has nothing to do with parades or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151224195742/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/21/extra_extra_2528.php">costumed characters in midtown</a>: it&apos;s all about Mickey&apos;s quest to recover an elusive hot dog in Central Park for his beloved Minnie Mouse. Along the way he runs into cops, crying babies, and Goofy in drag. </p>

<p>We do have one very serious complaint [spoiler alert]: it was completely unrealistic for Mickey to be handed a free hot dog at the end. It also makes Central Park look like a socialist utopia hellbent on undermining the basic tenants of a capitalist economy. If anything, the vendor would probably give Mickey the hero&apos;s discount, which would only be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151224195742/http://gothamist.com/2012/08/19/bottled_water.php">twice as expensive as normal.</a></p>
