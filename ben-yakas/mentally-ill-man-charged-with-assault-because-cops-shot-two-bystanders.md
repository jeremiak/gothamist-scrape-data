<p>Last September, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140221071029/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/15/cops_mistakenly_shoot_two_female_by.php">police shot two female bystanders</a> near Times Square while confronting an emotionally disturbed and unarmed Brooklyn man. Glenn Broadnax, 35, later told authorities that he was &quot;on a mission to kill myself&quot; when he lurched into traffic on 42nd Street near 8th Avenue around 9:35 p.m. on September 14th. Broadnax has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140221071029/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/05/nyregion/unarmed-man-is-charged-with-wounding-bystanders-shot-by-police-near-times-square.html?_r=1&amp;">now been charged with assault</a> because he &#x201C;recklessly engaged in conduct which created a grave risk of death&#x201D;&#x2014;ie, he is being charged for wounding those bystanders despite neither shooting them nor having any weapon.</p>

<p>The shooting occurred after Broadnax, who suffers from anxiety and depression, had reached into his pocket for his wallet, which cops mistook for a gun. Two officers opened fire, striking two bystanders, one of whom was shot in the leg, the other grazed by a bullet in her buttocks. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140221071029/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/16/shooting_nypd_times_square.php">Police were criticized</a> after the incident for their poor marksmanship and allegedly excessive force.</p>

<p>Broadnax was initially arrested on misdemeanor charges of menacing, drug possession and resisting arrest. But the Manhattan district attorney&#x2019;s office pursued higher charges. &#x201C;The defendant is the one that created the situation that injured innocent bystanders,&#x201D; said an assistant district attorney, Shannon Lucey.</p>

<p>For what it&apos;s worth, the lawyer for Sahar Khoshakhlagh, one of the bystanders hit that day, said that charges should be filed against the officers who fired into a crowd: &#x201C;It&#x2019;s an incredibly unfortunate use of prosecutorial discretion to be prosecuting a man who didn&#x2019;t even injure my client,&#x201D; attorney Mariann Wang told the Times. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s the police who injured my client.&#x201D;</p>
