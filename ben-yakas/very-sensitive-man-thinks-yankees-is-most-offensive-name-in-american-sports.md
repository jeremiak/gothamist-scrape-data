<p>The debate over the name of the Washington Redskins has been getting extra heated over the last few months&#x2014;several major newspapers and sports columnists have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130926095600/http://deadspin.com/the-mmqb-will-no-longer-use-the-name-redskins-1227448655">vowed to abstain from using the nickname</a>, while other columnists have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130926095600/http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/9689220/redskins-name-change-not-easy-sounds">used horrible analogies</a> to defend the moniker. But only one very brave, very sensitive man has the cajones to propose changing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130926095600/http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/yankees-is-just-as-bad-as-redskins/2013/09/20/927a2c46-2085-11e3-9ad0-96244100e647_story.html">&quot;the most offensive name in American sports: The New York Yankees.&quot;</a></p>

<p>Jason Fornwalt wrote a letter to the Washington Post <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130926095600/http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-fans-responsibility-to-change-a-team-name/2013/09/16/2eefc5b8-1ee2-11e3-9ad0-96244100e647_story.html">in response to the Redskins controversy</a> by...calling for people to stop using the dreaded &quot;Y-word.&quot; Behold his wonderful argument below: </p>

<blockquote>The term &#x201C;yankee&#x201D; was created by the British to mock the American colonists during the Revolutionary War. It was an insult. And the history of its use &#x2014; unlike Redskins &#x2014; is not in dispute.

<p>As if the term (which I will from here on refer to as the &#x201C;Y-word&#x201D;) wasn&#x2019;t offensive enough based on its use during the Revolution, it was used again, during another war, to insult largely white Northerners. That&#x2019;s right: The Confederate States of America used the Y-word as an insult as well. In fact, the Y-word is still used today in the South, to refer &#x2014; usually in a disparaging manner &#x2014; to Northerners.</p>

<p>Given the fact that the Y-word has an indisputable negative connotation throughout its history, and the fact that it&#x2019;s still used as an insult today, why isn&#x2019;t there a push to change it? And, ultimately, is any perceived insult about skin color, or skin thickness?</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>Finally, somebody is standing up for largely white Northerners. As Deadspin points out, Fornwalt neglects to note that the term was mainly used toward white people because non-whites were, ya know, slaves&#x2014;and were likely called much worse things. But who knows, maybe being associated with a insulting term is just the kind of thing the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130926095600/http://gothamist.com/tags/yankees">Yankees</a>&#x2014;who have heartily embraced <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130926095600/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/23/yankees_heartily_embrace_the_fact_t.php">the nickname &quot;Evil Empire&quot;</a>&#x2014;are into.</p>
