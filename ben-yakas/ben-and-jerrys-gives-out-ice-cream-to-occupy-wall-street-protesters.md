<p>And so, with the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160403012228/http://gothamist.com/tags/occupywallstreet">Occupy Wall Street</a> protesters having cleansed their land, survived the Great Storm, slayed the Brookfield Properties dragon and laughed in the face of King Bloomberg, the restless troops dined, and it was good. Following up on their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160403012228/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/09/ben_and_jerrys_lend_delicious_suppo.php">public support to the OWS movement</a>, Ben And Jerry&apos;s showed up at Zuccotti Park this afternoon to give out free ice cream to hungry protesters. And as you can see in the video below, Jerry was there in the flesh! </p>

<p>One starry-eyed protester described his encounter with Jerry: &quot;He just explained what Cherry Garcia is, and gave me some.&quot; Over the weekend, Ben and Jerry&apos;s became the first corporate company to publicly throw their support behind the ongoing OWS protests. We&apos;ve contacted the company to find out whether Ben And Jerry&apos;s always planned to stop by the Park today, or if they were motivated by the stay-of-cleanliness-execution by Brookfield earlier today. Sure, it&apos;s still not <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160403012228/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/12/ben_and_jerrys_occupie_wall_street.php">&quot;OccuPie Wall Street,&quot;</a> but it&apos;s certainly a good start.</p>
