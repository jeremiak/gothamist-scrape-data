<p>Two people were killed, and one person was seriously injured, in three separate subway incidents between yesterday evening and this morning. According to NYPD and FDNY, two men were fatally struck by trains in Manhattan and The Bronx, and another man was found seriously injured on the train tracks in The Bronx.</p>

<p>The first incident happened around 8:45 p.m. at the Parkchester Avenue station, at Westchester Avenue and Hugh J. Grant Circle. FDNY say a man was found on the 6 train tracks, and was taken to Jacobi Medical Center. It&apos;s unclear if he was struck by a train or not, but an FDNY spokesman said the victim &quot;probably fell on the tracks.&quot; </p>

<p>Then around 9:15 p.m., a man was fatally struck by a southbound 5 train at Seymour Avenue and East Gun Hill Road in The Bronx. Police say he was dead at the scene, and no criminality is suspected.</p>

<p>Around 4:30 a.m. this morning, a man in his 50s was fatally struck by a southbound 6 train in Manhattan at the East 23rd Street Station. An NYPD spokesman said that &quot;person might have been on the tracks, might have been a homeless man, we&apos;re still investigating.&quot;</p>
