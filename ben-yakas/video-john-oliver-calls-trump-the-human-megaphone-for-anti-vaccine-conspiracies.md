Instead, he turned his attention to vaccines, and specifically, the odious anti-vaccine conspiracy theorists who have turned their skepticism into memes, despite a lack of evidence. &quot;There comes a point where there&apos;s so much evidence, none of which shows any link between vaccines and autism, that you have to say <em>enough</em>,&quot; he said.</p>

<p>Oliver blames some of the mainstreaming of the topic on Donald Trump: Despite being &quot;one of humanity&apos;s most incredible accomplishments&quot; and saving millions of lives, &quot;small groups are both skeptical and vocal about vaccines, which is nothing new,&quot; Oliver said. &quot;But these days their voice has been amplified by the human megaphone that is the President of the United States.&quot; After showing a clip of Trump on the campaign trail saying he wants &quot;smaller doses&quot; of vaccines for kids, and discussing the doctor who has popularized this stance, he added, &quot;That sounds like a decent compromise because it&apos;s the middle-ground position, right? The problem is, it&apos;s the middle ground between sense and nonsense. It&apos;s like saying, &apos;It would be crazy to eat that entire bar of soap, so I&apos;ll just eat half of it.&apos;&quot;</p>

<p>While Oliver understands why vaccines can creep people out (&quot;pretty much every medical practice sounds terrifying when you break it down&quot;), he spends the bulk of the segment breaking down all the false information about vaccines (like how there is no link between vaccines and autism) and ended the segment on a personal note.</p>

<p>&quot;Parenthood in general is fucking terrifying. Believe me, I&apos;m someone who is literally scared of literally everything: the dark, the light, heights, depths, confined spaces, wide-open spaces, strangers, intimacy, spiders, and a sudden and mysterious lack of spiders,&quot; Oliver said. &quot;But, for what it&apos;s worth, and if this helps at all, I have a son. He is 19 months old. He was born prematurely following a very difficult pregnancy, and I&apos;ve worried about his health and I&apos;m still worried about his health a lot. But we are vaccinating him fully on schedule. And if I can overcome the temptation to listen to the irrational shouting of my terrified lizard brain, then I believe that everyone can.&quot;</p>
