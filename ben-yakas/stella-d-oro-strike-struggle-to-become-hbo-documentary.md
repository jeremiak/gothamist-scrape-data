<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="31311stella.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629173649im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/31311stella.jpg" width="227" height="350" class="image-left"> </span>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629173649/http://gothamist.com/tags/stelladoro">Stella D&apos;Oro</a> baked goods factory in the Bronx has been closed for over a year and a half ever since negotiations with its workers broke down and turned into a bitter strike. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629173649/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2011/03/13/2011-03-13_crumbled__to_bits_exstella_doro_workers_still_looking_for_jobs.html">According to</a> Mike Filippou, who was Stella D&apos;Oro&apos;s lead mechanic, at least 100 of the 135 people who lost their jobs in June 2009 are still out of work. But the workers will get a chance to play themselves in an upcoming HBO documentary about the strike.</p>

<p>The film, titled &quot;No Contract, No Cookies,&quot; was made by Emmy award-winners Jon Alpert and Matthew O&apos;Neill, nominated for a 2010 Oscar for their film &quot;China&apos;s Unnatural Disaster: The Tears of Sichuan Province.&quot; The two taped the striking workers on and off the picket line for months. &quot;Jon and I are both New Yorkers and Stella D&apos;oro was a New York factory. [The strike] was a story that we felt needed to be told,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629173649/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2011/03/13/2011-03-13_hbo_cooking_up_stella_doro_doc.html">said</a> O&apos;Neill. It could be on HBO as soon as this summer, which would bring some much-needed attention to the out of work strikers. &quot;People are living on unemployment...They can&apos;t pay their rent. They were chasing the American dream and it became a nightmare,&quot; said Filippou.</p>

<p>Eddie Marrero of Kingsbridge, a former Stella D&apos;Oro foreman who worked for the company for 30 years, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629173649/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2011/03/13/2011-03-13_crumbled__to_bits_exstella_doro_workers_still_looking_for_jobs.html">told the News</a> about his current situation. &quot;I keep busy at home. I take my wife to work and pick her up. I do the laundry and the cooking. But our savings are gone. I have no health insurance. It&apos;s hard...<strong>When you&apos;re 51 years old, they don&apos;t want you</strong>,&quot; he said.</p>
