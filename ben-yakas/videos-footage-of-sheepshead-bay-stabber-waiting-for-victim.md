<p>Building superintendent Nadil Gjeloshi described hearing her screaming: &#x201C;It was loud. She woke me up. I looked out the window. She just put her hands on that wall and then she started collapsing.&quot; In the video below&#x2014;which shows the Misaskim cleaning up the murder scene&#x2014;another neighbor describes what she saw and heard&#x2014;among other things, the last words of the victim to the murderer were, &quot;you son of a bitch.&quot; </p>

<p>Komsky&apos;s son Vadim struggled with understanding what happened to his mother, who he described as devoted to her synagogue: &#x201C;my mother did not have any enemies. She would have told me if she had any troubles. My mother was an amazing woman. There&#x2019;s not enough good things I can say about her. The synagogue meant the world to her.&#x2019;&#x2019;</p>

<p>The rabbi from that synagogue, Kalev Krelin, said, &#x201C;she was always in touch with me about her private issues. Some clients wanted to come to her but she didn&#x2019;t want to be stealing other people&#x2019;s clients. She was a very honest person.&#x201D;</p>
