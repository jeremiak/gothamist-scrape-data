                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="122613cops.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20140206162207im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/122613cops.jpg" width="640" height="480" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>It&apos;s Christmas week, and while most people are snuggling up with Christmas hams and marveling at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140206162207/http://www.thestar.com/entertainment/movies/2013/12/21/how_jonah_hill_sunk_his_teeth_wolf_of_wall_street_role.html">Jonah Hill&apos;s teeth</a>, some people have to keep <strike>dilly-dallying</strike> working. That includes the seemingly bored traffic cops who ticket a livery cab driver who was waiting in his car in the video below. </p>

<p>After an entertaining argument over semantics (&quot;I&apos;m not parking while I&apos;m sitting in the car&quot;), things take a turn for the vulgar when one of the officers is offended by the driver telling him he pays his salary: <strong> &quot;I pay my own salary, because I pay taxes, you fuckin...I fucked your mother last night, pussy,&quot;</strong> the officer eloquently responds.</p>

<p>&quot;I am recording this, you fail, smile,&quot; the frustrated driver exclaims as the video concludes. Skip to 1:50 to see the argument escalate. It&apos;s just too bad this officer couldn&apos;t have the decency to perform a &quot;blow me&quot; dance as well.</p>
