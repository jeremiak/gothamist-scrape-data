<p>A few years ago, we became aware of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150727014812/http://gothamist.com/tags/intactivist">http://gothamist.com/tags/intactivist&quot;&gt;growing Intactivist movement</a>&#x2014;Intactivism is the belief in the right of baby boys to keep their foreskins intact, and its members have been trying to legally ban circumcision. Tomorrow, you can get an up-close-and-personal look at that movement when foreskin-proud men and their allies march into NYC. Below, check out a NSFW video to get an idea of what you&apos;re in store for.</p>

<p>The march, known as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150727014812/http://foreskinpride.org/">Foreskin Pride</a>, was created in 2012 by Canadian Foreskin Awareness Project founder and self-proclaimed &#x201C;sexual revolutionary&#x201D; Glen Callender, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150727014812/http://www.nypost.com/p/entertainment/tv/oprah_foreskin_protests_hOHH2GiD7nxupDzSctTz3N">who campaigned against</a> Oprah Winfrey for using and promoting foreskin-based cosmetics products. </p>

<p>&#x201C;FORESKIN PRIDE may be an o&#xFB00;shoot of the LGBT Pride movement,&quot; Callenderis said in a statement, &quot;but it isn&#x2019;t only for LGBT people &#x2014;we are a pansexual movement that welcomes people of all sexual orientations, because forced genital mutilation harms people of all sexual orientations.&#x201D; For what it&apos;s worth, you probably won&apos;t see many foreskins in person tomorrow&#x2014;only the marches in Toronto and San Francisco are allowed to feature &#x201C;fabulous full-frontal foreskin.&#x201D;</p>
