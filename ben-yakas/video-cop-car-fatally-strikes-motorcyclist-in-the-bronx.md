<p>An NYPD patrol car fatally struck a man on a dirt bike motocycle in the Bronx yesterday. The incident happened around 12:15 p.m. when the cops spotted 26-year-old Adalberto Gonzalez travelling south on Manida Street, operating the motorcycle without license plates or a helmet. Police ended up chasing Gonzalez on foot when he jumped onto the rear seat of another unregistered Honda dirt bike driven by a 28-year-old. That dirt bike was then struck by a different marked patrol car.

<p>The accident occurred at the intersection of Randall Avenue and Faile Street in Hunts Point. The unidentified 28-year-old bike driver was killed; Gonzalez was thrown from the vehicle, but only sustained minor injuries and was taken into custody on scene. Gonzalez has been charged with reckless endangerment, obstruction of governmental administration, fleeing an officer with a motor vehicle and resisting arrest.</p>
