<p>A new iPhone crime wave has ridden into Brooklyn on two-wheels recently, and has become a more reliable occurrence than the phone&apos;s copious dropped calls. Bike-riding thieves have been snatching iPhones and other smart phones from unsuspecting Brooklynites in three different neighborhoods of the borough, according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170331210959/http://brooklynpaper.com/stories/33/49/print_iphoneswipes_2010_12_03_bk.html">Brooklyn Paper.</a> At least three women and a man were targeted by the thieves in Park Slope, Prospect Heights and Boerum Hill in November; another three women <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170331210959/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/cyclists_swipe_cells_in_ride_by_mK7YHoorRS8d7uoRT4cNAL?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">were robbed</a> in Park Slope in October. </p>

<p>Police are unsure whether this is the work of the same person, or several people; similar <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170331210959/http://gothamist.com/2010/06/08/iphone_thefts.php">on-the-go snatchings</a> have taken place in Brooklyn in fits and starts for the last year. Perhaps it&apos;s time for another undercover CSI-style <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170331210959/http://gothamist.com/2010/11/19/with_tourists_iphone_held_for_ranso.php">sting operation</a>?</p>
