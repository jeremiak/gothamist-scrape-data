                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="112213knockout1.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20140223010013im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/112213knockout1.jpg" width="640" height="448"> <br> <i> screenshot <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140223010013/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local/new_york&amp;id=9336102">via ABC</a></i></div> <p></p>

<p>Police say there was another <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140223010013/http://gothamist.com/tags/knockout">seemingly unprovoked assault</a> against a Jewish man in Brooklyn early Friday morning, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140223010013/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2013/11/22/4-men-arrested-in-alleged-knockout-attack-in-brooklyn/">four men have been arrested</a> in connection with it. A 24-year-old Jewish man was walking home from work on 18th Avenue in Borough Park around 2:45 a.m. today when he was surrounded by four men who punched him in the face and ran. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140223010013/http://nypost.com/2013/11/22/nypd-hate-crime-unit-probing-brooklyn-knockout-attack/?utm_campaign=SocialFlow&amp;utm_source=NYPTwitter&amp;utm_medium=SocialFlow">The victim reportedly told cops</a> that before the attack, he heard one assailant referring to the &quot;knockout&quot; game and say, &#x201C;Yeah, I can do it! Look, I&#x2019;ll do it to this guy.&quot;</p>

<p>Despite fleeing the scene, the suspects, who range in age from 28 to 38, were caught quickly by cops. The four&#x2014;three Hispanic men and one Indian male&#x2014;are facing assault charges, but those may be upgraded, CBS reports. &#x201C;I commend the excellent police work that we saw this morning,&#x201D; said Assemblyman Dov Hikind, who has been very vocal about these attacks. &#x201C;I am grateful that these four thugs are off the streets and am hopeful that they will be treated with the severity of the law. I urge continuing diligence in dealing with this issue.&#x201D;</p>

<p>This is at least the ninth attack of this nature to occur in Brooklyn in the last few months. Previously, a 78-year-old Midwood woman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140223010013/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/20/78-year-old_brooklyn_woman_punched.php">was punched in the face</a> while walking down the street; other attacks in the area <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140223010013/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/13/video_nypd_investigating_knockout_s.php">were caught on camera,</a> but no arrests have been made yet in any of the other cases, which are being investigated as possible hate crimes.</p>
