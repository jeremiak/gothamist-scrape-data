<p>A 40-year-old Special Education Bronx teacher <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130729112010/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/19/bronx_teacher_arrested_for_allegedl.php">was arrested and accused of raping</a> a 10-year-old student yesterday. Anthony Criscuolo, who taught at PS 386, has been charged with first-degree rape and predatory sexual assault against a child. The family of the little girl say that Ciscuolo manipulated the girl by telling her she had won an award, then raped her in the back of a car. &#x201C;He needs to die,&#x201D; the girl&#x2019;s grandmother <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130729112010/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/bronx-teacher-arrested-raping-10-year-old-student-article-1.1377579?localLinksEnabled=false">told the Daily News.</a></p>

<p>The girl told detectives that Criscuolo had informed her she was going to receive an award on Monday&#x2014;he allegedly forged a letter about the award on school letterhead to give to her mother. The girl&apos;s parents allowed him to take her to the award ceremony; but he instead took her to a parking lot and allegedly raped her in his car.</p>

<p>The girl&#x2019;s mother called cops Tuesday after she found a series of sexually illicit emails sent by Criscuolo; in one of them, he claimed he had left his wife to be with the little girl. &#x201C;He was manipulating her to keep her from talking,&#x201D; the girl&#x2019;s aunt, who also lives with the family, told the News. &#x201C;She was scared.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Other teachers and friends <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130729112010/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/monster_teach_7DnQoT3BHYXEHSrpm09TZM">told the Post that</a> there had been suspicious behavior before this between Criscuolo and his victim: &#x201C;He used to always have a favorite student who was a girl. He got her a ring and everything &#x2014; a real ring, a diamond ring,&#x201D; said one former student. &#x201C;They were acting like they were married.&#x201D;</p>
