<p>The most popular season of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170909150218/http://gothamist.com/tags/saturdaynightlive"><em>Saturday Night Live</em></a> in decades is almost at an end, but we have a handful of shows left until then&#x2014;and we now know who all the hosts will be.</p>

<p>Louis C.K. will host on April 8th with musical-ish (musical-adjacent?) guest The Chainsmokers. That episode will be followed by Jimmy Fallon on April 15th, Chris Pine on May 6th, Melissa McCarthy on May 13th, and Dwayne Johnson on May 20th. (The musical guests for those last four episodes have not been announced yet, but let me throw out my dream ones for ya: Spoon, Migos, The Magnetic Fields, and...what the hell, Kanye West!)</p>

<p>But wait, there&apos;s more: for the first time in its 40+ year history, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170909150218/http://uproxx.com/sepinwall/snl-live-west-coast/">SNL will air</a> those final four episodes live across the country. So they will be broadcast live at 11:30 p.m. Eastern, 10:30 Central, 9:30 Mountain, and 8:30 Pacific. (The episodes will then repeat at 11:30 p.m. Mountain and Pacific time.)</p>

<p>&quot;SNL &#x2014; enjoying its most popular season in two decades &#x2014; is part of the national conversation, and we thought it would be a great idea to broadcast to the west and mountain time zones live at the same time it&#x2019;s being seen in the east and central time zones,&quot; Robert Greenblatt, the chairman of NBC Entertainment, said in a statement. &quot;That way, everyone is in on the joke at the same time. Kudos to Lorne Michaels, the producers and cast for making SNL one of the most relevant and anticipated shows in the zeitgeist.&quot;</p>
