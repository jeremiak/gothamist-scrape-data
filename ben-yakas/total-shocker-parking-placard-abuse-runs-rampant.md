title: Total Shocker: Parking Placard Abuse Runs Rampant

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:220px; "> <img alt="4611placard.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110407190432im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/4611placard.jpg" width="220" height="239"> <br> <i><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110407190432/http://nyc.uncivilservants.org/post/index/3388">Uncivil Servants</a></i></div> According to a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110407190432/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2011/04/06/2011-04-06_curb_police_parking_placard_abuse_state_says.html">new state probe</a>, police parking placards have been widely and frequently misused by lawmakers and other state officials. What a shocking and frustrating development! It&apos;s amazing that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110407190432/http://gothamist.com/2010/10/12/non-official_parking_placards_still.php">nothing</a> whatsoever has been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110407190432/http://gothamist.com/2010/01/11/placard_poseurs_posing_primo_parkin.php">written</a> about this subject in the last <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110407190432/http://gothamist.com/2008/03/06/city_struggles.php">three years</a>!<p></p>

<p>Inspector General Ellen Biben, who launched the probe at Gov. Cuomo&apos;s request, has found &quot;chronic and widespread&quot; misuse and abuse of the placards, and is recommending that changes be made as to how the placards are distributed. Hmm, we thought there was already <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110407190432/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/17/new_exceptions_in_the_world_of_ille.php">a special unit</a> within the Internal Affairs Bureau dedicated to just tracking down such offenders? Well, we&apos;re sure that replacing the police placards for legislators and non-law enforcement officials with ones that say simply &quot;official business&quot; will fix everything.</p>

<p>Among the notable violators in the report are such luminaries as Sen. Jose Peralta, who told the News that placards are a courtesy to senators, as they toil ever-so-hard for them; Waterfront Commissioner Ronald Goldstock, who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110407190432/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/03/waterfront_commissioner_caught_in_i.php">was caught</a> illegally using one while teaching a class at NYU on corruption; and at least two Division of Parole officials who were on long-term leave. And that doesn&apos;t even take into account disgraced slashing enthusiast <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110407190432/http://gothamist.com/2010/08/05/hiram_monserrate_still_enjoying_sta.php">Hiram Monserrate</a>, money-laundering gynecologist <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110407190432/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/29/krugers_gyno_houseboys_enjoyed_cove.php">Michael Turano</a>, and the entire <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110407190432/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/13/police_cadets_steal_parking_spots.php">police academy</a>! The whole thing is so frustrating, we wish there were some way we could just <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110407190432/http://gothamist.com/2010/06/16/tips_for_attaining_your_own_illegal.php">get our own</a>. </p>
