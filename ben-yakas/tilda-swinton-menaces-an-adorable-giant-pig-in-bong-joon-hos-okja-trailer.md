<p><em>Snowpiercer</em> was one of our favorite movies of the last decade, so anything director Bong Joon Ho comes up with is automatically on my must-see list. So it&apos;s just icing on the cake that his latest film, <em>Okja</em>, also has Jake Gyllenhaal dressed like a really bad Hunter S. Thompson impersonator, Tilda Swinton glazed in silver as a menacing corporate baddie, and a pro-animal message wedded to what appears to be another fast-moving thriller&#x2014;and there are also some scenes set right here in NYC! Check out the first trailer below.</p>

<p>Here&apos;s the synopsis for the film, which will be released globally on Netflix on June 28th:</p>

<blockquote>For 10 idyllic years, young Mija (An Seo Hyun) has been caretaker and constant companion to Okja - a massive animal and an even bigger friend - at her home in the mountains of South Korea. But that changes when a family-owned multinational conglomerate Mirando Corporation takes Okja for themselves and transports her to New York, where image obsessed and self-promoting CEO Lucy Mirando (Tilda Swinton) has big plans for Mija&apos;s dearest friend.
 
With no particular plan but single-minded in intent, Mija sets out on a rescue mission, but her already daunting journey quickly becomes more complicated when she crosses paths with disparate groups of capitalists, demonstrators and consumers, each battling to control the fate of Okja...while all Mija wants to do is bring her friend home.
 
Deftly blending genres, humor, poignancy and drama, Bong Joon Ho (<em>Snowpiercer, The Host</em>) begins with the gentlest of premises-the bond between man and animal-and ultimately creates a distinct and layered vision of the world that addresses the animal inside us all.</blockquote>
