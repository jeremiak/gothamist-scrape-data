<p>Were you planning on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508150720/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/13/how_will_you_celebrate_phil_collins.php">celebrating Phil Collins</a> this weekend? Were you booked for a post-Valentine&apos;s Day <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508150720/http://beta.flavorpill.com/events/50fc4decc9af6f0016000017">treasure hunt</a>? Did you have a date with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508150720/http://americansongbook.org/kristin-chenoweth">Kristin Chenowith</a>? Well, throw all those plans out the window, because <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508150720/http://www.hulu.com/movies/criterion">Hulu has the entire Criterion Collection</a>&#x2014;the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508150720/http://www.criterion.com/library/list_view?p=1&amp;pp=all&amp;s=year">single greatest collection of movies in the world</a>&#x2014;available for free this weekend. </p>

<p>This is your chance to finally watch Carl Dreyer&apos;s <em>The Passion of Joan of Arc</em>, to dig into Italian New Wave cinema, to explore the works of Kurosawa and Kieslowski and Jarmusch and Bergman and Cassavetes and Fellini and Godard and countless other auteurs. You could take in some comfort cinema by watching any Wes Anderson movie, or you could finally force yourself to watch Lena Dunham&apos;s first feature film, <em>Tiny Furniture.</em>. And if you get overwhelmed by all the foreign names and existential motifs, you always have the option of watching the greatest movie about Bruce Willis blowing up an asteroid: <em> Armageddon</em>.</p>
