<p>Comedy Central announced today that Jordan Klepper will become the latest <em>Daily Show</em> correspondent to make the leap to his own late night program. He also joins Jimmy Fallon, Jimmy Kimmel, John Oliver, and James Corden to become the latest white guy whose name begins with a &quot;J&quot; to host a late night comedy show.</p>

<p>Like Stephen Colbert and Larry Wilmore before him, Klepper&apos;s new show will air at 11:30 p.m. on weeknights after <em>The Daily Show</em>. Klepper first started appearing on <em>The Daily Show</em> in 2014 when Jon Stewart was still host, and is an Upright Citizens Brigade Theater alum. </p>

<p>The format and title of his new show are unknown, but the network said in a release that the show would &quot;embrace and define the chaos of our country by channeling Klepper&#x2019;s steadfast attitude that institutions are to be trusted less than the lies of the mainstream media.&quot; It also sounds like he&apos;ll be bringing his own team of comedian-correspondents, or as the release put it, he&apos;ll be surrounding himself with &quot;a handpicked team of contributors contractually obligated to reinforce his singularly correct worldview.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;The choice to entrust me with the 11:30 p.m. time slot is both incredibly humbling and deeply disturbing,&quot; Klepper said in a statement <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170404212637/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/04/arts/television/jordan-klepper-the-daily-show-comedy-central-program-of-his-own.html">to the Times</a>. &quot;Without a doubt, it has utterly destroyed my confidence in Comedy Central&#x2019;s decision making acumen. Dear God, now I have to work with these fools.&quot;</p>

And while that ongoing conversation remains vital, it is also important to point out that Klepper has been one of the standout stars of <em>The Daily Show</em>, and his remote pieces covering the Trump campaign have been some of the funniest work on that show since Trevor Noah took over.</p>

<p>It&apos;s possible (just maybe!) that both these things are simultaneously true: Klepper earned his own show and will probably be very good at it, AND it is disappointing that yet another late night program is sticking with the white male hosting formula. Having said that, at least his pieces have been ridiculously funny and good, and hopefully he&apos;ll continue to go out into the field despite being the host. </p>
