<p>If you&apos;re <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151230081643/http://www.vulture.com/2013/05/will-and-jaden-smith-on-working-together.html">a student of patterns</a> like American treasure <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151230081643/http://gothamist.com/tags/willsmith">Will Smith</a>, then you already know that the forum of media that we&apos;re in can&apos;t really handle the complexity of things that we say all the time. It&apos;s just a fact! But here&apos;s another fact: <em>After Earth</em> was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151230081643/http://entertainment.time.com/2013/06/03/why-after-earth-bombed-six-theories/">an utter bomb at the box office.</a> Thankfully, a group of Smith sympathizers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151230081643/http://cheerupwillsmith.com/Home_Page.html">are doing their darndest to cheer him up.</a></p>

<p>The group of Scientology enthusiasts (or, more precisely, parodists) have posted the above signs around midtown. And they set up an elaborate website, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151230081643/http://cheerupwillsmith.com/Home_Page.html">CheerUpWillSmith.com</a>, which includes video testimonials showing support of Smith and the much-maligned film. Is the whole thing a plot <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151230081643/http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/after-earth-2013">by Matt Zoller Seitz</a> to encourage people to see the film? It is just an anti-Scientology mockery exploiting a movie that has been called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151230081643/http://www.vulture.com/2013/05/after-earth-will-smith-love-letter-to-scientology.html">a love letter to Scientology</a>? </p>

<p>Either way, Will Smith doesn&apos;t need your help cheering up. This is why he keeps <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151230081643/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/25/video_will_smith_gives_the_people_t.php">Alfonso Ribeiro on speed-dial</a>!</p>
