On Wednesday, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160308005552/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/13/breaking_dolphin_spotted_in_east_ri.php">a dolphin was spotted</a> swimming around in the East River near 96th Street. Then on Friday, a dolphin <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160308005552/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/15/east_river_dolphin_may_have_resurfa.php">was spotted on the other side</a> of the East River near Astoria. Officials from the Riverhead Foundation weren&apos;t sure whether it was the same dolphin or a second one, but members of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160308005552/https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.487330474659769.1073741829.110372889022198">North Brooklyn Boat Club</a> took to the water yesterday and confirmed there are TWO dolphins currently hanging out in the East River. And like a lot of Manhattan residents, the bottlenosed dolphin from the Upper East Side has moved to Greenpoint.</p>

<p>&quot;We paddled out today and saw the dolphin further south&#x2014;near Greenpoint,&quot; North Brooklyn Boat Club member Willis Elkins told us. Despite the snowy conditions, they spotted the second dolphin uptown: &quot;Kayakers from our club also spotted a second, and smaller, dolphin north from where we were in the canoe&#x2014;near the Queensboro bridge on the west channel,&quot; he said. &quot;The dolphin appeared healthy and quite active&#x2014; we followed it around for over an hour and got within about 20&apos; on a few occasions.&quot;</p>

<p>This meshes with what Riverhead Foundation director Rob DiGiovanni <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160308005552/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/15/east_river_dolphin_may_have_resurfa.php">told us on Friday</a>; he said the dolphins were both spotted free swimming and didn&apos;t appear to have any injuries, so there was no need to intervene (for now). Even if you wanted to herd them, it wouldn&apos;t be so easy, as Kim Durham of Riverhead Foundation added: &quot;Typically they dont go where you want them to go.&quot;</p>
