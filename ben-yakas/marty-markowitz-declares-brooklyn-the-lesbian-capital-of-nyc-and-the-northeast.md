<p>Oy vey you gorgeous people: enthusiasm junkie <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150113173040/http://gothamist.com/tags/martymarkowitz">Marty Markowitz</a> only has about 19 days left as Brooklyn&apos;s Greatest Borough President Ever!! And he&apos;s been on something of a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150113173040/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/12/photos_marty_markowitz_throws_150k.php#photo-1">zydy tour</a> lately! Which means he&apos;s had plenty of opportunities to wax poetic about his 12 years in office, which have been THE GREATEST 12 YEARS IN THE HISTORY OF BROOKLYN OR THE WORLD!! <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150113173040/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/16/brooklyn_borough_president_marty_ma.php">Here, watch him rap about it</a>. He <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150113173040/http://www.wnyc.org/story/marty-markowitz-rise-brooklyn/">stopped by The Brian Lehrer Show yesterday</a> to talk about how Brooklyn has changed, and offered lots of praise, to all the beautiful lesbians and all the hard-working gays: &#x201C;We remain the lesbian capital of New York City and the Northeast,&#x201D; Markowitz proclaimed.</p>

<p>&#x201C;In other words, we have a much larger lesbian population in Brooklyn,&quot; he added. &quot;New York City is fortunate to have a large LBGT community, but in Brooklyn in particular, the lesbian community, there&#x2019;s no question it&#x2019;s the capital of the Northeast. They&#x2019;ve made unbelievable contributions to the quality of life in our city and our borough.&#x201D;</p>

<p>At least one WNYC commenter was overjoyed with his remarks: &quot;As a 15 year lesbian resident of Brooklyn, 3 cheers to Marty for singling out our contribution to the boro!,&quot; wrote Jill. &quot;Lesbians usually get lumped in with the gay community as a whole, it&apos;s so refreshing to hear someone recognize as our own group, which has indeed impacted the economy and culture of Brooklyn. And he&apos;s right- Brooklyn is the lesbian mecca!&quot;</p>

<p>Of course, some other areas, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150113173040/http://jezebel.com/5878916/the-21-most-lesbianish-cities-in-america">like Northhampton and Amherst</a>, might disagree slightly.
