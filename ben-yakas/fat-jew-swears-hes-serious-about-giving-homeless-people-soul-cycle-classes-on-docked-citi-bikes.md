<p>Yesterday, a video featuring TV personality and rapper The Fat Jew&#x2014;a.k.a. Fabrizio Goldstein&#x2014;showing him <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429152223/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/20/video_the_fat_jew_giving_homeless_s.php">giving free SoulCycle classes on docked Citi Bikes</a> to people identified as &quot;the homeless&quot; spread like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429152223/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0M4IKmvSfhU">wildfire.</a> A lot of people, including us, assumed the video was a parody of self-absorbed fitness-crazed trainers mashed together with the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429152223/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/12/stationary_citi_bike.php#photo-1">hottest Citi Bike trend</a>&#x2014;but Goldstein told us that he&apos;s dead serious about the endeavor: &quot;<strong>Although it started as a joke, the reactions I&apos;ve gotten from the homeless since I started doing this (3 classes so far) have been so bizarrely positive that I&apos;m going to do it more regularly without a doubt.&quot;</strong></p>

<p>Goldstein, a comedian we know best for his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429152223/http://laist.com/2013/04/13/nsfw_coachellas_most_insane_belly_drawing.php">belly art</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429152223/http://www.youtube.com/user/JewtherVandross">YouTube videos</a>, says he wants to bring in other cycling enthusiasts (aka, &quot;less fat friends&quot;) to help teach the classes. &quot;We feel as if this is something we can do to give back,&quot; he told us. &quot;There are SO many CitiBike locations that are highly underutilized (particularly on the lower West Side) and we feel that they should be used to give back to New Yorkers [who] could use it most.&quot;</p>

<p>Goldstein also claims to have video testimonials from some of his homeless students thanking Mayor Bloomberg for allowing them to exercise and have some fun. &quot;The bikes were just kind of imposed in the neighborhoods,&quot; he continued, &quot;so I think it&apos;s within the rights of every New Yorker to utilize them when they&apos;re not generating revenue.&quot;</p>

<p>We&apos;d like to believe Goldstein is serious about the idea&#x2014;he&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429152223/https://twitter.com/FATJEW/status/348095619769958401">also implored that he&apos;s being sincere</a> on his otherwise mostly jokey <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429152223/https://twitter.com/FATJEW">Twitter page</a>&#x2014;and not just locked into a tasteless joke at the expense of homeless people. When asked whether there would be any way for homeless people to find out about the classes, he responded: &quot;I&apos;m going to have my army of interns post up schedules around the city!&quot;</p>
