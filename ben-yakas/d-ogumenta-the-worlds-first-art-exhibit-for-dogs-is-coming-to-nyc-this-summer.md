<p>The Internet is nothing if not filled with artistically-inclined <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170516174041/http://gothamist.com/tags/dogs">dogs</a>, whether it&apos;s the dog who paints to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170516174041/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czprMfYFZ_0">raise awareness of gas chambers</a> or the blind dog who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170516174041/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TJbsVFX3eUM">rocks a beret like no other.</a> But we&apos;ve spent so much time expecting masterpieces from creative souls such as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170516174041/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcL8vZVjAZA">Dogvinci</a>, we&apos;ve never stopped to think about providing dogs with a forum so they too can appreciate art. But a former Washington Post art critic is about to make the art world a lot more ruff.</p>

<p>Jessica Dawson, in conjunction with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170516174041/http://www.artsbrookfield.com/event/dogumenta/">Arts Brookfield</a>, will open the world&apos;s first art exhibit for dogs, dOGUMENTA, this summer. Dawson <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170516174041/http://www.wmagazine.com/story/dogumenta-art-exhibition-for-dogs-brookfield-place">explained to W</a> that the idea was sparked as she travelled to various art galleries in the city with Rocky, her Maltese/Yorkshire terrier. Rocky is listed as a curator for the exhibit, along with co-organizer Mica Scalin, which will be physically installed at dog-eye view from August 11th to 13th:</p>

<blockquote>[Rocky] makes studio visits and personally approved each of the 10 new works contributed by 10 New York-based artists, like Merav Ezer and Eric Hibit. Come August, as a part of Arts Brookfield, each will be installed outdoors at Brookfield Place in lower Manhattan between the carefully chosen hours of 8 a.m. to 1 p.m. and 4 p.m. to 8 p.m., &#x201C;to be respectful of the heat sensitivities of our four-legged friends.&#x201D;</blockquote>

<p>Dawson is fully aware that some might giggle at the idea, as she&apos;s been telling people about it at various art-world cocktail parties for awhile now: &quot;Some people get it right away and see the multiple levels: the humor and satirical quality, but also how it&apos;s heartfelt, how I earnestly believe in it,&quot; she said. &quot;Any really revolutionary new art-world action is going to be met with both this look of &apos;What are you thinking?&apos; and with a real show of solidarity. That&#x2019;s what happens when you&#x2019;re innovating.&quot;</p>

<p>In an essay <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170516174041/https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/3968-art-of-a-dog">for the Criterion Collection</a>, Dawson expanded on her genesis for the gallery:</p>

<blockquote>My own gallery-going experience has been transformed by Rocky, a spirited Morkie whom I met several years ago in a SoHo shelter. To my surprise, Rocky panted with pleasure each time I suggested a Chelsea gallery crawl, even as I remained wary of the dealers&#x2019; overhyped wares. I wondered: What was Rocky&#x2019;s secret? As we spent more and more time together, it became clear that Rocky had something to teach me&#x2014;to teach all of us&#x2014;about finding joy in today&#x2019;s art world. Among his many skills, I noticed a singular capacity to remain in the moment and to see each artwork with fresh eyes.

<p>Rocky&#x2019;s fearlessness, his capacity to remain curious, and, most importantly, his indifference to the pronouncements of New York Times reviews, were the inspiration for a talk I gave in February to a group of art world insiders gathered in a gallery in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Bushwick. The lecture, titled Five Things My Dog Taught Me About Art, not only considered the dog&#x2019;s capacity to teach us about human ingenuity but also served as the launch event for a radical new exhibition I&#x2019;m organizing called dOGUMENTA. The premise of dOGUMENTA is this: If canines like Rocky and Lolabelle can teach us so much about human creativity, what if they had a show of their own? How would artists respond to this massive new audience?</p></blockquote><p></p>
