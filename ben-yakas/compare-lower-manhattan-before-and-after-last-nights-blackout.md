<p>The majority of lower Manhattan below 39th Street <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141102030858/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/29/lower_manhattan_loses_power_after_p.php">was plunged into darkness last night</a> after an explosion at a Con Ed plant on 14th Street during the storm surges of Hurricane Sandy. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141102030858/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/30/con_ed_may_take_a_week_to_restore_p.php">More than 750K New Yorkers</a> lost power altogether, including over 200K in downtown Manhattan (the majority of whom will likely be without electricity for the next couple days). <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141102030858/http://images.peterdykstra.com/">Peter Dykstra</a> captured the blackout before (Saturday night at 10 p.m.) and after (Monday night at 10 p.m.) it happened from the Brooklyn Heights Promenade in the incredibly striking shots below. </p>
