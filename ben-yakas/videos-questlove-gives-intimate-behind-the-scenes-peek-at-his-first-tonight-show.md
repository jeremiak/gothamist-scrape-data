<p>So far, <em>The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon</em> has been a rousing success, already producing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506143833/http://gothamist.com/tags/jimmyfallon">a few viral clips</a> while getting <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506143833/http://www.deadline.com/2014/02/the-tonight-show-starring-jimmy-fallon-holds-well-in-night-3/">bonanza late night ratings.</a> Today, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506143833/http://www.okayplayer.com/news/questlove-backstage-day-1-the-tonight-show-starring-jimmy-fallon-video.html#.UwaOqUJdW19">Okayplayer shared</a> two behind-the-scenes videos of the first show from Monday, following Questlove and The Roots as they prepare for the day.</p>

<p>Among other things, we find out that <em>The Tonight Show</em> theme song took the band over 9 months to write, we get a glimpse of Questlove&apos;s ridiculously nice downtown Manhattan apartment, and learn that he takes his hygiene very seriously: &quot;My hugs are world-famous because it&apos;s like hugging a bakery,&quot; Questlove explains. &quot;I&apos;m the best smelling person on this earth.&quot;</p>
