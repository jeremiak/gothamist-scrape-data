<p>With the subways still down in the aftermath of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150929134121/http://gothamist.com/tags/hurricanesandy">Hurricane Sandy</a>, and no timetable yet on when they might be back (although we&apos;re expected to get a better idea of that sometime today), the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150929134121/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/30/free_mta_buses_resume_at_5_pm_nyers.php">city is offering</a> partial, free bus service to help commuters <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150929134121/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/30/these_mta_buses_are_running_post-hu.php">get to work today</a>. While it&apos;s understandable there might be some hiccups, things have been going really poorly out there in some places: there have been reports of long lines, overly-packed buses, nightmarish traffic jams (not helped by a lack of working traffic lights), and disabled vehicles. As <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150929134121/https://twitter.com/DyingToMeet1D/status/263645543803256833">Dyingtomeet1D put it</a> so eloquently, &quot;WAITED FOR THE BUS FOR AN HOUR AND A HALF IT&apos;S FREAKIN CHILLY OUT HAD TO GO HOME BC ALL OF THEM FCKIN BUSES ARE FULL JUST LEAVE ME TO DIE :(&quot; </p>

<p>To be fair, some bus lines in Brooklyn are operating surprisingly well. Gothamist&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150929134121/http://www.twitter.com/johndelsignore">John Del Signore</a> says his commute from Williamsburg to DUMBO on the B62 was &quot;smooth as silk.&quot; But check out less fortunate Twitter dispatches from the trenches below:</p>
