title: Judge Calls CT Triple Murder Death Penalty Defense "Perverse"

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:200px; "> <img alt="101410hayes.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130708170233im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/101410hayes.jpg" width="200" height="160"> <br> <i>Steven Hayes</i></div> Defense lawyers for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130708170233/http://gothamist.com/tags/stevenhayes">Steven Hayes</a>, who was found guilty on 16 of 17 counts related to the brutal home invasion and murder of a Connecticut doctor&apos;s family, were hoping to save their client from the death penalty by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130708170233/http://gothamist.com/2010/10/09/lawyers_argue_against_death_penalty.php">arguing</a> that the cost of imposing and carrying out a death sentence would far exceed the cost of a life sentence. They received a blow to their argument today, when the Judge in the case <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130708170233/http://www.courant.com/community/cheshire/cheshire-home-invasion/hc-hayes-ruling-1015-20101014,0,6350712.story">ruled that the cost</a> will not be allowed to be used as a mitigating factor: &quot;<strong>A jury in the penalty phase of a capital case is charged with the task of using reasoned moral judgment, not counting dollars and cents</strong>,&quot; Judge Jon C. Blue wrote in his decision.<p></p>

<p>Blue disagreed with the defense lawyers&apos; argument: because Hayes is only 47, he has a longer life expectancy than an older criminal, and will cost more to keep incarcerated for life. &quot;From an economic view, it will thus be more expensive to incarcerate the younger defendant for the remainder of his life and&#x2014;in strict economic terms&#x2014;more cost-effective to execute him...This argument plainly makes no moral sense...<strong>Economic arguments tailored to specific individuals are not only irrelevant but perverse</strong>,&quot; he wrote. The death-penalty phase of the trial begins on Monday.</p>
