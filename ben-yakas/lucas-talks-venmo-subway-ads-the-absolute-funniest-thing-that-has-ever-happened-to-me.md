<p>If you have eyes and have ridden on the subway, then you&apos;ve certainly come across Lucas, the semi-mustachioed face of Venmo. The ads for the app, which allows you to exchange payments with friends via your smartphone, became ubiquitous this winter, as well as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509131844/http://valleywag.gawker.com/venmo-everyone-hates-your-weirdo-subway-ads-1502663281/@sarah-hedgecock">ubiquitously mocked</a>, especially since Lucas&apos; unblinking visage came packaged with nonsensical phrases such as &quot;Lucas takes the stairs&quot; and &quot;Lucas has dreams.&quot; But the real life Lucas Chi has been taking his newfound fame in stride: &quot;It is the absolute funniest thing that has ever happened to me,&quot; he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509131844/http://www.fastcompany.com/3026144/lucas-talks-to-fast-company-reviled-venmo-subway-ads-explained">told Fast Company</a>. &quot;It&apos;s still crazy to think that there are posters of me all over the city just staring off into space with that mustache (if I can call it that).&quot;</p>

<p>Chi, who joined the company four months ago, really does work for Venmo <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509131844/https://venmo.com/info/about">as a software engineer</a>; he was chosen for the ads after one of the company&apos;s cofounders saw him making coffee one morning and was struck by inspiration: &quot;Apparently &apos;Lucas uses Venmo&apos; has a good cadence,&quot; he noted. He says he&apos;s gotten recognized on the subway, in the gym, and even in dim sum restaurants&#x2014;they mostly ask to take photos with him.</p>

<p>Of course, the most important part of all this is the question of his mustache. </p>

<blockquote>The most interesting piece of conversation was something I overheard a man asking some coworkers of mine. After finding out that they worked for Venmo he asked, &quot;How did he get his mustache like that? Did he go through and pluck every other hair? It&apos;s just so ... sparse.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>He explained why he didn&apos;t shave it off for the shoot: &quot;I didn&apos;t have a choice. We shot the ads during Movember.&quot; Go ahead and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509131844/http://thelucasgenerator.com/?lucasbox=isn%27t+wearing+pants">make Lucas do whatever you want here</a>.</p>
