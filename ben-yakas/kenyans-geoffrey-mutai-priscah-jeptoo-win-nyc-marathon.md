<p>Kenyans won both the men&apos;s and women&apos;s races at the NYC Marathon today after last year&apos;s race was cancelled by Hurricane Sandy. Geoffrey Mutai, 32, who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131106064344/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/06/firehiwot_dado_geoffrey_mutai_win_2.php#photo-1">set the course record</a> the last time the race was held in 2011, defended his title and won the race in 2:08:23. And Priscah Jeptoo, 29, won the woman&apos;s race with a time of 2:25:07. </p>

<p>Jeptoo actually trailed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131106064344/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/31/sports/deba-could-be-the-first-new-yorker-to-win-the-citys-marathon.html">Buzunesh Deba</a> (a crowd favorite who lives and trains in NYC) by nearly 3.5 minutes at the halfway point of the race, but was able to make up that time and pass her at mile 24. Mutai also hung back in the pack for the first 20 miles of the race before accelerating to the front. Tatyana McFadden of the United States came in first in the women&apos;s wheelchair division, and Marcel Hug of Switzerland came in first in the men&apos;s wheelchair division. </p>

<p>In the wake of the Boston marathon bombing earlier this year, security <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131106064344/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/02/43_bomb-sniffing_nypd_dogs_will_be.php#photo-1">was beefed up</a> as nearly 50K runners and tens of thousands of fans participated in this year&apos;s event.
