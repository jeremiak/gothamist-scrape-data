<p>NYC has its fair share of hidden singing talent, tucked away inside <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140608004836/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/02/video_second_ave_subway_constructio.php">subway construction workers</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140608004836/http://gothamist.com/2012/09/09/video_listen_to_the_opera-singing_b.php">operatic bus drivers</a>, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140608004836/http://gothamist.com/2009/10/26/video_riding_with_the_oldies-singin.php">Williamsburg Subaru Dudes</a>. And now we can add John Maldonado, a janitor in a Harlem apartment building, to their ranks: &quot;I sing for my friends, but I never really pursued it,&quot; he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140608004836/http://pix11.com/2014/06/05/harlem-janitor-with-amazing-singing-voice-looking-to-trade-in-mop-for-mic/?hpt=us_bn7">told WPIX</a>. &quot;Secretly I always wanted to be a singer but I&apos;ve always been nervous.&quot;</p>

<p>As you can hear from some of the clips below, all taken from Maldonado&apos;s own YouTube channel <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140608004836/https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCifr10j_rE_TMBv_cgam9DQ">Mop4aMic</a>, he has nothing to be nervous about, except getting used to strangers loving his voice:</p>

<p>Maldonado, who is originally from Brooklyn, says he gets lots of encouragement from the tenants at the Lenox Avenue residential building where he works. &quot;He has such an amazing voice. It&apos;s a blessing to hear that type of music &#x2014; to hear that voice in the morning when you wake up,&quot; tenant Cora Heckstall said.</p>

<p>You can see an interview with Maldonado below.</p>
