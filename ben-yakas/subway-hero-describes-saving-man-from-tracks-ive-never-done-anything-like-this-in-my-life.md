<p>After learning of another four people who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160403150035/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/20/man_critically_injured_after_being.php">were injured</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160403150035/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/19/two_people_killed_another_hurt_in_t.php">or killed</a> due to subway-related incidents, we were very happy to hear <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160403150035/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/19/subway_hero_saved_elderly_man_from.php">the story of a subway hero who selflessly jumped onto the tracks</a> Friday afternoon and saved an elderly man who had fallen onto them. We spoke to that man, 33-year-old Ramiro Ocasio, about what happened, and how he&apos;s been since the incident: &quot;I don&apos;t even know why I did it, it&apos;s just not me man,&quot; he told us. &quot;I&apos;ve never done anything like this in my life. This is not Ramiro. I&apos;m not a macho guy. I dont even know how to swim.&quot;</p>

<p>The incident happened around 4 p.m. on Friday at the Lexington Avenue / 59th Street Station in Manhattan. Ocasio, who works at the law firm <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160403150035/http://www.kirkland.com/">Kirkland and Ellis</a>, had gotten out of work early that day, and was listening to music while waiting for the N/Q train to come when he saw people rushing past him: &quot;When I turn around, I see this old man in the middle of the track crawling like a little baby trying to get up,&quot; he said. &quot;I hear people saying, &apos;get closer to the platform&apos; so they could lift him up. But he couldn&apos;t. If he could get closer to the platform, there would have been no need to jump in.&quot;</p>

<p>Ocasio noted that this all occurred very quickly, in under 30 seconds: &quot;I look to my right to make sure the train isnt coming, so we won&apos;t be killed. You dont know how close the train is, you can only see the light of the train coming.&quot; Then he made his final decision seconds later: &quot;I said to myself, &quot;I&apos;m jumping in, this cannot happen in front of my eyes.&apos;&quot; Once he was down there, he was able to lift the elderly man up to the platform surprisingly easily (&quot;I&apos;m not a strong dude,&quot; he repeatedly noted)&#x2014;but he didn&apos;t realize just how high up it was. &quot;Holy crap, how am I gonna get outta here,&quot; he thought to himself.</p>

<p>He jumped up, but couldn&apos;t reach it. He tried to jump again&#x2014;and this time, he was helped by 4 or 5 people who picked him up by the arms: &quot;That&apos;s why I love this city,&quot; he said. Seven-to-ten seconds later, the Q train passed by. Ocasio said everyone was in tears, including the 7-year-old daughter of Felicia Greenfield, the woman who first told us about the incident: &quot;She couldn&apos;t take her eyes off my face. She couldn&apos;t stop crying. It was so overwhelming.&quot;</p>

<p>Greenfield told us she was so impressed with him because he made &quot;a major event look like nothing special. I kept wondering what the rest of his day was going to be like. He didn&apos;t seem the type to post his heroism on Facebook, so I just wanted him to get a little acknowledgment. <strong>Although I&apos;d never want my daughter to jump in the tracks, I loved her getting to see a true everyday hero in action.&quot;</strong></p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="11913ramiro2.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160403150035im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/11913ramiro2.jpg" width="640" height="480"> <br> <i> Felicia Greenfield</i></div> <p></p>

<p>Ocasio says he injured his leg as he was trying to come up from the tracks, hitting them &quot;really hard&quot; on the bottom of the platform. Two MTA agents and paramedics took notes after the incident, but Ocasio said he was in a daze: &quot;All I kept thinking about was, &apos;I put my life at risk for this man. Where did that come from?&apos;&quot; </p>

<p>Ocasio agrees with Greenfield that the elderly man, who refused treatment and left the station soonafter, wasn&apos;t in the right state of mind: &quot;I&apos;m not a doctor or anything, but he was not acting rational to me. I dont think he knew where he was. He didn&apos;t know where his family was. He kept saying he lives in The Bronx.&quot;</p>

<p>Since the ordeal, Ocasio has had trouble sleeping, and hasn&apos;t even been able to tell his friends what happened: &quot;I&apos;m a bit of a joker, I joke a lot with my friends, so they won&apos;t believe me. I haven&apos;t even told my mom.&quot; He strongly agreed with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160403150035/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/19/twu_launches_campaign_against_mta_t.php">the TWU&apos;s recent campaign</a> to encourage conductors to slow down to 10 MPH while entering stations as opposed to 30-35 MPH.</p>

<p>But most of all, the Boston native (note the Red Sox cap in the photos) is thankful for the other people on the platform who helped him. &quot;New Yorkers, we come together with stuff like this,&quot; he told us. &quot;If I could, I would choose to be born in NYC. People were hugging me, crying, they picked me up. I was lucky, they saved my life too. I&apos;m not the only hero here.&quot;</p>
