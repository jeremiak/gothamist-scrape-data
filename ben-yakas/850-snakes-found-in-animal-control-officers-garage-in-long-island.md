<p>What would you do if you walked into a garage and found 850 snakes? Thankfully, it&apos;s a scenario none of us will have to face now that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130922053413/http://www.newsday.com/long-island/suffolk/brookhaven-town-animal-control-officer-had-850-snakes-at-home-1.6103956?p=112721">authorities have wrangled 850 snakes</a> from the garages of an Animal Control Officer on Long Island. </p>

<p>Richard Parinello, 44, is facing multiple charges of owning the pythons and violating town codes by running a business at his home and without a permit after investigators found the treasure trove of reptiles earlier today. Parinello had claimed earlier this year that he could not work because of carpal tunnel syndrome in his hands and wrists. </p>

<p>He was under investigation for workers&apos; compensation fraud when officials discovered he was allegedly selling the snakes, including two 6-foot Burmese pythons, which are illegal in New York. Appropriately, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130922053413/http://www.newsday.com/long-island/suffolk/brookhaven-town-animal-control-officer-had-850-snakes-at-home-1.6103956?p=112721">Newsday reports</a> there were two trucks parked in Parinello&apos;s driveway with vanity license plates with the words &quot;SNAKEVAN&quot; and &quot;SSSSNAKE.&quot;</p>
