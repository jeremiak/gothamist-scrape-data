<p>In these times of great upheaval, New Yorkers need to turn to one another for comfort, strength, and photos of taxi drivers covered in shaved ice while imitating the &quot;draw me like one of your French girls&quot; pose <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161119144034/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jI2BgDpp_9w">from <em>Titanic</em></a>. And thankfully, the 2017 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161119144034/https://www.nyctaxicalendar.com/">NYC Taxi Drivers Calendar</a> is here to provide all those things, plus a photorealistic recreation of Janet Jackson&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161119144034/https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/a1/Janetrollingstonecover.jpg">nude Rolling Stone cover.</a></p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="111616sexy5.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20161119144034im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/111616sexy5.jpg" width="640" height="501"> <br> <i> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161119144034/https://www.nyctaxicalendar.com/">NYC Taxi Calendar</a> </i></div> <p></p>

<p>The calendar <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161119144034/http://gothamist.com/2013/12/09/move_over_fdny_sexy_cabbie_calendar.php">first debuted</a> in 2013, bringing together a dozen of the city&apos;s &quot;most scintillating and good-humored yellow cab drivers&quot; to spread awareness of the smoldering sexuality lurking within the banana-colored vehicles which drive our drunk asses home. It&apos;s also about charity: a portion of each calendar sale goes to University Settlement, America&#x2019;s oldest settlement house. And it&apos;s also about making squeegees ooze pure eroticism again.</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="111616sexy8.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20161119144034im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/111616sexy8.jpg" width="640" height="501"> <br> <i> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161119144034/https://www.nyctaxicalendar.com/">NYC Taxi Calendar</a> </i></div> <p></p>

<p>In 2014, the calendar made us question <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161119144034/http://gothamist.com/2014/10/01/sexy_taxi_calendar.php">the nature of sex</a>, and wonder which base &quot;shaving&quot; falls under (2nd base?). In 2015, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161119144034/http://gothamist.com/2015/11/19/taxi_drivers_sexy_calendar.php">we learned that</a> gently placing leaves on your nipples while making provocative eye contact with the camera DOES count as going all the way. And this year, we&apos;ve discovered that water conservation is NOT sexy.</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="111616sexy3.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20161119144034im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/111616sexy3.jpg" width="640" height="501"> <br> <i> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161119144034/https://www.nyctaxicalendar.com/">NYC Taxi Calendar</a> </i></div>  <p></p>

<p>Also sex: not-so-subtle <em>Avenue Q</em> advertising. Nothing gets ladies hotter than seeing you cuddle up to a Lucy the Slut doll.</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="111616sexy7.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20161119144034im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/111616sexy7.jpg" width="640" height="501"> <br> <i> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161119144034/https://www.nyctaxicalendar.com/">NYC Taxi Calendar</a></i></div>  <p></p>

<p>You might be thinking to yourself, &quot;Oh sure, next thing you&apos;re gonna tell me is that yellow suspenders gently being snapped against your naked tummy is also sex, yeah right&quot; but GUESS WHAT, it is, thanks 2016.</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="111616sexy2.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20161119144034im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/111616sexy2.jpg" width="640" height="501"> <br> <i> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161119144034/https://www.nyctaxicalendar.com/">NYC Taxi Calendar</a></i></div> <p></p>

<p>Anyway, this is my favorite photo of this year&apos;s calendar, because nothing would get me hornier than the opportunity to float away from the garbage dump fire that is America right now.</p>
