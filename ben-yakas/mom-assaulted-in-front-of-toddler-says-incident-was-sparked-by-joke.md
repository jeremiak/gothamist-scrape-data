<p>The NJ mom <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140629214214/http://gothamist.com/2014/06/26/video_adults_stand_by_as_nj_mom_is.php">who was brutally assaulted</a> in front of her 2-year-old child in a video that went viral this week says that the incident stemmed from a misunderstanding about a joke. Victim Catherine Ferreira, 27, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140629214214/http://www.nj.com/salem/index.ssf/2014/06/salem_video_beating_victim_says_she_feared_for_her_life_and_her_2-year-old.html#incart_m-rpt-1">talked to the South Jersey Times</a> about the beating which occurred this past Tuesday, allegedly at the hands of 25-year-old McDonald&apos;s employee LaTia Harris. &quot;I have to wake up like this now,&quot; Ferreira told them. &quot;I have school to go to and all of this over a fight ... and the fight is over stupidity &#x2014; nothing is worth any of this. No job, no guy is worth any of this ... she really did a number on me. For nothing. Over nothing.&quot;</p>

<p>Ferreira, who is a former employee of the McDonald&apos;s where Harris works, says she was visiting former coworkers a few weeks ago and made a joke about Harris and her manager &quot;being together.&quot; &quot;I was joking around with two other employees,&quot; she said. &quot;I was talking to my former co-workers &#x2014; and since she overheard the statements that I made, she was upset.&quot; Ferreira claims Harris kept calling and harassing her about the joke afterwards, leading up to this past Tuesday&apos;s physical confrontation. &quot;I became really afraid,&quot; Ferreira said. &quot;I thought she may have been capable of hitting my son. I mean, her size versus my size &#x2014; she could have killed me.&quot;</p>

<p>The attack left Ferreira with limited vision in her left eye, numerous contusions, a broken nose, and was also threatened with being shot during the attack. She added that the people seen in the video watching the fight (and not intervening) were just &quot;kids&quot; from McDonalds: &quot;I really want to make this clear &#x2014; I don&apos;t want people to see them as monsters,&quot; she said. &quot;They didn&apos;t really see that this was more serious than just a fight.&quot;</p>

<p>Harris is facing charges of aggravated assault and two counts of making terroristic threats. &quot;I feel sorry for her,&quot; Ferreira said of Harris. &quot;She has two kids &#x2014; and all of this &#x2014; over what? Nothing.&quot;</p>
