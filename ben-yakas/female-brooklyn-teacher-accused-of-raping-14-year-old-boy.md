<p>A Brooklyn middle school teacher <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150526214520/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/brooklyn-teacher-claudia-tillery-charged-raping-student-article-1.981660">has been arrested and charged</a> with the rape of a 14-year-old student. Claudia Tillery, 42, allegedly engaged in a sexual relationship with the unidentified boy for two years. Tillery, who teaches at MS 35, The Stephen Decatur Middle School in Bedford-Stuyvesant, allegedly bribed the student, then a sixth-grader, with alcohol and marijuana.</p>

<p>An NYPD spokesman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150526214520/http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2011/11/nyc_teacher_arrested_after_all.html">said the relationship</a> was allegedly consensual, though New York law considers sex with a minor statutory rape; police add that the sexual acts didn&apos;t happen on school grounds. Tillery was arrested in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, yesterday afternoon. She <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150526214520/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local/new_york&amp;id=8442692">was charged with</a> rape, unlawful dealing of drugs and alcohol to a child, sexual misconduct, sexual abuse and acting in a manner injurious to a child. The boy apparently decided to end the relationship recently and tell authorities.</p>
