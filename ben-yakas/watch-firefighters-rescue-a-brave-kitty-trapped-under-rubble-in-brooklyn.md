<p>A wall collapsed behind a Crown Heights apartment building early Friday morning, causing the destruction of two detached parking garages. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140505070213/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local/new_york&amp;id=9524451">The incident happened</a> around 7 a.m. this morning behind 1644 Carroll Street and 743 Crown Street. At least three cars parked in the garages were destroyed. Officials believe the collapse may have been caused by the insane rainfall we had earlier this week. </p>

<p>Much more importantly, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140505070213/http://crownheights.info/accidents/434332/two-garages-collapse-after-retention-wall-fails/">Crown Heights Info reports</a> a white cat got stuck under the debris, leading to the very harrowing video below. But don&apos;t worry: firefighters were able to rescue the kitty. Just make sure you warn your co-workers before you start watching the video below, because your squeals may lead them to believe you&apos;re having a very cute heart attack.</p>

<p>Hopefully this kitty is off to live a pampered life of decadent treats and toys at a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140505070213/http://gothamist.com/tags/catcafe">Cat Cafe</a> somewhere in America.</p>
