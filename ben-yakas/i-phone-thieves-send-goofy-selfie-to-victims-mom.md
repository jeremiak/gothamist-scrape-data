<p>If an iPhone thief <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140526200033/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/28/brooklyn_iphone_thief_caught_after.php">isn&apos;t tripping on his saggy jeans</a> while running from cops, then he&apos;s probably posting <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140526200033/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/09/best_photo_ever_iphone_thief_posts.php">pot smoking-selfies to his victim&apos;s Facebook page</a>. Or shoving the iPhone <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140526200033/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/23/man_steals_iphone_by_shoving_it_up.php">up his butt</a> in desperation. Or, as in the case of the thieves above, sending a goofy selfie to their victim&apos;s mom.</p>

<p>According to police, the thieves snatch the iPhone at a Hell&apos;s Kitchen building on W 48th Street around 11:30 p.m. on April 17th. The suspects sent the above selfie to the victim&apos;s mom shortly after taking it. The Post <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140526200033/http://nypost.com/2014/05/23/iphone-thieves-send-selfie-to-victims-mother/">fills in some details</a>: the duo snatched the phone from 14-year-old James Pugliatti, who was partying at an under-18 event at Stage 48 that day. They sent the selfie to all of the high schooler&#x2019;s friends using Snapchat.</p>

<p>They also sent the mother, Annette Pugliatti, the message, &quot;Mom I&#x2019;m so horny.&quot; &quot;I was pissed. I had to get another phone,&quot; the 14-year-old told the Post. &quot;They&#x2019;re pretty stupid. The whole thing was really annoying. It ruined my night.&quot; James had not downloaded Find My iPhone, which is generally speaking the most painless and successful means of tracking iPhone thieves.</p>

<p>Anyone with information in regards is asked to call Crime Stoppers at 1-800-577-TIPS (8477). The public can also submit tips by logging onto the <a href="WWW.NYPDCRIMESTOPPERS.COM">Crime Stoppers website</a> or by texting their tips to 274637 (CRIMES) then enter TIP577.</p>
