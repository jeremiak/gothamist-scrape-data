<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none" style=" width:640px; "> <img alt="42111seinfeld.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110424063738im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/42111seinfeld.jpg" width="640" height="221"> <br> <i>(AP)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>It seems that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110424063738/http://gothamist.com/tags/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a>, the potential <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110424063738/http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2011/04/21/trump-ross-perot-of-2012/?mod=google_news_blog">Ross Perot of 2012</a>, has really been making friends during his fake presidential campaign. According <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110424063738/http://www.nypost.com/p/pagesix/trump_blasts_seinfeld_pullout_0S8zYf2OzIeUveWAFr88MO">to the Post</a>, Jerry Seinfeld canceled an upcoming appearance at a benefit for his son&apos;s Eric Trump Foundation, because of Trump&apos;s<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110424063738/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/24/donald_trump_comes_out_as_a_birther.php"> hotheaded birther rhetoric.</a> And Trump was none too pleased: <strong>&quot;You should be ashamed of yourself!&quot;</strong> he wrote Seinfeld in an angry letter. As Frank Costanza might say, &quot;THEY DON&apos;T WANT ME, I DON&apos;T WANT THEM.&quot;</p>

<p>According to his reps, Seinfeld pulled out of the Sept. 13 event benefiting the St. Jude Children&apos;s Research Hospital because he disagrees with Trump&apos;s blather about Obamas birth certificate. Taking the high road, Trump wrote in response that he hated <em>The Marriage Ref</em>: &quot;We don&apos;t care that you broke your commitment, even though the children of St. Jude are very disappointed, and despite the fact that your manager clearly stated you are &apos;truly a man of his word.&apos; <strong>What I do feel badly about is that I agreed to do, and did, your failed show, &apos;The Marriage Ref,&apos; even though I thought it was absolutely terrible</strong>...Despite its poor ratings, I didn&apos;t cancel on you like you canceled on my son and St. Jude. I only wish I did.&quot;</p>

<p>Seinfeld&apos;s reps told the Post that he felt &quot;uncomfortable&quot; with The Donald&apos;s stance, and that he would still make a contribution both to the Eric Trump Foundation and to St. Jude. But it seems that someone was still mad, since Seinfeld&apos;s rider requests were dropped at the bottom of the story: they say it included demands for Hershey&apos;s Almond Kisses, original Fig Newtons and cold vegetable trays (no baby carrots), as well as <strong>&quot;NO CUSHIONED STOOLS!&quot;</strong> Trump won&apos;t have to worry about replacing Seinfeld at the event though&#x2014;he&apos;s already gotten noted comedian Bret Michaels to fill in.</p>
