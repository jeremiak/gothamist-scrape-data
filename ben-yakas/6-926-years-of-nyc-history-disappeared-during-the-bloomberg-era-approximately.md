<p>There&apos;s no denying that Mayor Bloomberg dramatically <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430033954/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/17/ny_times_gives_interactive_tour_sho.php">changed the landscape</a> of NYC through bike lanes, new buildings construction, and rezoning. In some ways&#x2014;like with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430033954/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/04/video_see_how_nyc_streets_have_tran.php">improved and increased street space</a>&#x2014;this has been a very good thing. But in other ways&#x2014;like the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430033954/http://www.gothamist.com/tags/homelessness">homelessness epidemic</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430033954/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/19/bloomberg_thinks_homelessness_is_go.php">with the loss</a> of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430033954/http://gothamist.com/tags/affordablehousing">affordable housing</a> to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430033954/http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-12-06/nyc-business-tax-breaks-face-skepticism-from-de-blasio.html">taxpayer subsidized</a> high rises&#x2014;it most certainly has not. And one of his worst legacies will be the incredible loss of beloved neighborhood businesses and restaurants over his 12 years in office. </p>

<p>Jeremiah Moss, the curator and chronicler of the changing face of NYC on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430033954/http://vanishingnewyork.blogspot.com/">Jeremiah&apos;s Vanishing New York</a>, compiled <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430033954/http://vanishingnewyork.blogspot.com/2013/12/master-list-2001-2013.html">an impressively depressing list</a> of businesses that have disappeared since 2001&#x2014;places that have been forced out because of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430033954/http://gothamist.com/tags/renthike">rent hikes</a>, that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430033954/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/27/odessa_closing_in_the_east_village.php">lost their leases</a> when their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430033954/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/22/prime_burger_closing.php">building was sold</a>, that were demolished for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430033954/http://gothamist.com/tags/stvincents">billion-dollar luxury condo projects</a>. </p>

<p>It&apos;s a list where the phrase &quot;a victim of soaring rents in a neighborhood populated as much by bankers as by bohemians&quot; is all too accurate. Moss lists all the years these establishments were in business (ie, 150 years for Domino Sugar Factory, 45 years for Kenny&apos;s Castaway&apos;s), and came up with an astronomical figure: NYC lost <em>at least</em> 6,926 years of its history in 12 years. </p>

<p>In 2013 alone, we lost 836 years of history:</p>

<blockquote>Stile&apos;s Market: 26 years
Pushed out by landlord, to be demolished for luxury development

<p>5Pointz, formerly Phun Phactory: 20 years<br>
White-washed by owner, to be demolished for luxury condo towers</p>

<p>Famous Roio&#x2019;s/Ray&#x2019;s Pizza: 40 years<br>
Building sold </p>

<p>Ray Beauty Supply: 50 years<br>
Property seized by landlord</p>

<p>Vercesi Hardware: 101 years<br>
Building sold to be demolished for luxury condos</p>

<p>D&#x2019;Auito&#x2019;s Bakery: 89 years<br>
Unknown</p>

<p>Odessa Restaurant: 48 years<br>
Building sold, gastropub to move in, now for rent</p>

<p>Splash gay bar: 22 years<br>
Lack of business</p>

<p>Paradise Caf&#xE9;: 20 years<br>
Rent hike</p>

<p>Big Nick&#x2019;s Burger and Pizza Joint: 51 years<br>
Rent increase from $42,000 to $60,000 a month</p>

<p>Max Fish: 24 years<br>
Rent increase</p>

<p>Joe&#x2019;s Dairy: 60 years<br>
Cost of doing business</p>

<p>Bleecker Bob&#x2019;s Records: 46 years<br>
Rent hike</p>

<p>Blarney Cove: 50+ years<br>
Evicted for new development</p>

<p>Sofia&#x2019;s Italian restaurant: 35 years<br>
Lost their lease</p>

<p>9th Street Bakery: 87 years<br>
38% rent hike, replaced by juice-cleanse and smoothie shop</p>

<p>Capucine&#x2019;s Italian restaurant: 33 years<br>
Rent hike</p>

<p>Rawhide gay bar: 34 years<br>
Rent hike, to be turned into a pizza chain from California</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>Some of these places of course would have disappeared anyway (as a commenter points out, &quot;&apos;Seized by landlord&apos; and &apos;evicted&apos; means non-payment of rent&quot;), but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430033954/http://vanishingnewyork.blogspot.com/2013/12/master-list-2001-2013.html">most places</a> seem to have been the victims of gentrification, rent increases, and the rising cost of surviving in NYC. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430033954/http://vanishingnewyork.blogspot.com/2013/11/advice-for-mayor-bill.html">We share Moss&apos; hope</a> that de Blasio will <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430033954/http://www.ilsr.org/san-francisco-dealing-chains/">follow the lead of San Francisco</a> in dealing with retail stores. In the meantime, let&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430033954/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/04/sunday_is_last_call_for_uws_popover.php">appreciate the popovers</a> while they&apos;re here.</p>
