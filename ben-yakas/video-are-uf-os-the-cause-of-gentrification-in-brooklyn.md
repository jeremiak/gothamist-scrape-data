<p>A Williamsburg man believes he may have captured some type of UFO hovering over Brooklyn on Monday night on camera...and perhaps unlocked the key to the gentrification of Brooklyn as well. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428131828/http://aaronshortstory.blogspot.com/2009/06/letter-from-phil-depaolo.html">Community activist</a> and self-proclaimed &quot;regular guy&quot; Phil DePaolo took the below video of a round, pulsating object in the sky around 11 p.m. above North 6th street. The object moves around, changes colors, flashes intermittently, and just generally freaked him out: </p>

<p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m not a UFO freak, and I&#x2019;m not claiming it&#x2019;s a flying saucer. But it&#x2019;s something, and I hope enough people will see the video, so that I can get answers...<strong>Of all the people in Brooklyn to see this, why couldn&#x2019;t it be Marty Markowitz</strong>,&#x201D; he asked <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428131828/http://www.nypost.com/p/blogs/brooklyn/activist_shoots_video_of_ufo_hovering_22oJf58BSX04NMEh3FlyGM">the Post.</a></p>

<p>At first, DePaolo thought it might be a satellite, but ruled it out because of how quickly the light seemed to move. A similar unidentified, fast-moving object was captured <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428131828/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TtGfolVvMA">on video</a> in Brooklyn in January; the same object was allegedly seen right around this time of year in Williamsburg <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428131828/http://gothamist.com/2010/01/28/video_do_you_want_to_believe_in_ufo.php">last year</a> AND the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428131828/http://gothamist.com/2009/02/04/mysterious_northern_lights_over_nyc.php">year before.</a> The mystery thickens! </p>

<p>It probably isn&apos;t some sort of viral video, but could it be flashing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428131828/http://gothamist.com/2010/10/14/photos_video_of_ufos_over_manhattan.php#photo-1">balloons</a>? In Russia, a huge orange caterpillar-shaped object <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428131828/http://www.examiner.com/unexplained-phenomena-in-national/huge-caterpillar-ufo-sighting-moscow-russia-on-march-6-2011-video">was spotted</a> over Moscow this week...could it be some sort of homage to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428131828/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6bYIbt-NrY&amp;feature=related">venereal horror</a> filmmaker David Cronenberg? The regularity of the sightings leads us to believe there must be some pattern to it...though we&apos;ll likely never figure it out, at least if the British government <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428131828/http://www.aolnews.com/2011/03/07/classified-docs-reveal-uk-tried-to-stop-worldwide-ufo-investigat/">has their way.</a> DePaolo does posit his own theory about the sighting: <strong>&#x201C;I have to wonder if all the crusty punks and Hipsters who&#x2019;ve invaded Bedford Avenue are really aliens.&quot;</strong></p>
