<p>Jack White did a fantastic job of pissing off a lot of super duper Jack White fans with disposable incomes last night at Radio City Music Hall. White <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160821121946/http://www.setlist.fm/setlist/jack-white/2012/radio-city-music-hall-new-york-ny-33ddd02d.html">played just 12 songs</a> for around 45-50 minutes, and left the stage...never to return. And then irate concertgoers took our their Twitter torches and pitchforks.</p>

<p>There have been various suggestions as to why White cut the set so short (typically on this tour, he has been playing 19-23 song sets, including an encore). Various people tweeted that White was unhappy with the subdued nature of the crowd, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160821121946/https://twitter.com/jessmisener/statuses/252216150556024832">asking at one point</a>, &quot;Jesus Christ, is this an NPR convention?&quot; David Folkenflik <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160821121946/https://twitter.com/davidfolkenflik/status/252249054170464256">was amused by</a> that one: &quot;That&apos;s so ironic! last time I encountered thoughtful questions at an NPR confab, I said, what the hell is this? A Jack White concert?&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160821121946/http://observer.com/2012/09/jack-white-abruptly-ends-radio-city-show-leading-to-angry-fan-mini-mob/">The Observer asked</a> a member of the Radio City security team, who said: &#x201C;He wasn&#x2019;t happy with the sound. I don&#x2019;t know why he pulled that.&#x201D; Another usher told them, &#x201C;The show is over. We don&#x2019;t know why. You&#x2019;ll probably find out on a blog, MediaTakeOut or some other source.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160821121946/http://www.buzzfeed.com/perpetua/jack-white-totally-pisses-off-new-york-crowd">Buzzfeed&apos;s Matthew Perpetua posited</a>, &quot;There&apos;s a strong possibility that White cut the show short because a huge amount of the tickets for the gig went to scalpers, but who knows.&quot; </p>

<p>Regardless, there were chants of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160821121946/https://twitter.com/RosieGray/statuses/252234969794097152">&quot;Fuck You Jack,&quot;</a> and people <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160821121946/http://instagram.com/p/QLwQ8DiUS2/">returning their merchandise</a> once it became clear he wasn&apos;t coming back. For what it&apos;s worth, we can say from experience that Jack White <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160821121946/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/29/video_watch_jack_whites_entire_unst.php">is incredible to see in concert</a> (when he plays a full set, of course). And at least there was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160821121946/http://eatthis.inmusic.ca/2012/06/fiona-apple-talks-roseland-ballroom-meltdown-with-jimmy-fallon.html">no crying involved</a> with this onstage meltdown&#x2014;although, maybe a few tears might have cut down on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160821121946/https://twitter.com/Tchoubacca/status/252234098221928449">mean Meg comments.</a></p>

<p>Oh yeah, and White plays another show there tonight, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160821121946/http://www.stubhub.com/jack-white-tickets/jack-white-new-york-radio-city-music-hall-9-30-2012-4124035/">there are plenty</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160821121946/http://newyork.craigslist.org/search/?areaID=3&amp;subAreaID=&amp;query=jack+white&amp;catAbb=sss">of tickets available.</a></p>
