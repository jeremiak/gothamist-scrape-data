<p>A man was fatally shot in the head, and two others were injured, after violence broke out in an apartment in Boerum Hill last night. According to police, the incident happened just before 7 p.m. Friday night at the Warren Street Houses (between 3rd and 4th Avenues). A 43-year-old man, who hasn&apos;t been identified yet, was shot in the head by an as-yet unknown assailant. &#x201C;They were inside drinking, just a regular Friday night, and then I heard a faint sounding gun shot,&#x201D; a witness <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141111232957/http://nypost.com/2013/11/08/park-slope-shooting-leaves-man-in-critical-condition/">told the Post.</a></p>

<p>In addition, police found a 40-year-old man and a 30-year-old man with minor head injuries sustained from being struck with a gun. Another 38-year-old man suffered a graze wound to the hip area, but refused any medical treatment. Cops adds that no arrests have been made yet, and the investigation is ongoing. </p>
