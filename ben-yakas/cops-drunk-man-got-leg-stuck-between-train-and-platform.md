<p>A &quot;highly intoxicated&quot; man got his leg stuck between a train and the platform last night in Manhattan, authorities say. NYPD and FDNY both confirmed the incident happened just before 11:30 p.m. at the Seventh Avenue Station at 53rd Street last night. Cops say the man, who may have been panhandling, walked toward the track to get on the train as the D train arrived, but got his left leg caught between the train and platform. &quot;I guess he didn&apos;t time it correctly,&quot; a police spokesperson told us.</p>

<p>His left leg was cut by the train door running board (the part that sticks out from the lip of the door). He was taken in critical condition to Cornell Hospital with lacerations to his leg. NYPD noted that he was likely to survive his injuries. </p>
