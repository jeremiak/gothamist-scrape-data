Over a three-month investigation, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140515194350/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2011/03/20/2011-03-20_the_city_councils_dirty_lil_secrets_many_pols_have_legal__financial_troubles_a_n.html">News learned that</a> several of the 51 City Council members dodged taxes, violated the city&apos;s housing and building codes, circumvented regulations to get cheap housing and even ignored criminal bench warrants. They will be diving deep into the allegations over the next three days, but here are some highlights to whet your appetite:<p></p>

<ul>
	<li>Councilman Ruben Wills has two outstanding arrest warrants on pending criminal charges. He&apos;s also a &quot;deadbeat dad&quot; who owes more than $27,000 in child support. Wills <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140515194350/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2011/03/20/2011-03-20_skeletons_in_his_closet_i_know_ive_got_outstanding_warrants_says_queens_pol.html">admitted to</a> his outstanding warrants today, writing, &quot;<strong>There is no excuse...While these events are more than 10 years old, I take full responsibility and I have taken steps to remedy the situation.</strong>&quot;</li>
	<li>Four Council members&#x2014;Fernando Cabrera, Mathieu Eugene, Peter Koo and Jumaane Williams&#x2014;get tax breaks by claiming a primary residence outside their districts. We call this <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140515194350/http://gothamist.com/tags/pedroespada">pulling an Espada</a>. Williams had also been investigated several times for illegally converting an apartment in a building he owns.</li>
	<li>Council Speaker Christine Quinn is about to move into a luxury condo building where she used taxpayer dollars to resolve a conflict with a neighboring building over garbage. She&apos;s also been sued repeatedly for nonpayment of rent.</li>
	<li>Councilwoman Inez Dickens owed $100,000 in back-property taxes, some dating over two years, and has been cited repeatedly for unsafe conditions in Harlem apartment buildings she owns. She&apos;s also been accused of hiding assets to dodge estate taxes.</li>
	<li>Councilman Larry Seabrook is under indictment for running a shakedown scheme and illegally pocketing cash, including collecting $177 in expenses&#x2014;for a $7 bagel and diet soda&#x2014;from a political club he runs.</li>
	<li>Several Council members are &quot;swimming in debt,&quot; including James Sanders, who faces eviction because the $588,000 home he bought with no money down is in foreclosure.</li>
	<li>Melissa Mark-Viverito has a one-third interest in at least one Puerto Rico rental condo, but reports no income. Members are supposed to report any income over $1,000 per year.</li>
	<li>Seven Council members pay rent to themselves or to entities controlled by relatives for campaign offices.</li>
</ul>
