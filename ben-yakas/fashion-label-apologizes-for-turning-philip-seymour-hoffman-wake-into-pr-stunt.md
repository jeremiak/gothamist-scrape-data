<p>A major fashion label reached peak tone-deafness this week after a PR flack sent out an email blast to journalists to brag about actress Amy Adams carrying one of their bags to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140410034821/http://gothamist.com/2014/02/07/family_friends_gather_at_wake_for_p.php#photo-1">Philip Seymour Hoffman&apos;s wake</a>. &quot;We are pleased to announce Amy Adams carrying the Valentino Garavany Rockstud Duble bag from the Spring/Summer 2014 collection on Feb. 6 in New York,&quot; Valentino&apos;s &quot;celebrity relations manager,&quot; Upasna Khosla, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140410034821/http://pagesix.com/2014/02/07/fashion-labels-promote-what-celebs-wore-to-hoffmans-funeral/">said in an email</a>. It&apos;s just too bad they didn&apos;t manufacture a line of authentic PSH-emblazoned sweatpants in time for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140410034821/http://gothamist.com/2014/02/08/hundreds_say_good-bye_to_philip_sey.php#photo-1">the funeral</a>&#x2014;it could have been the synergetic marketing event of the season!</p>

<p>After an uproar, Adams&apos; rep quickly distanced her from the gaffe: &quot;Amy Adams is not a paid spokesperson for Valentino, and the suggestion she would use this moment to participate in a promotion is truly appalling,&quot; spokeswoman Megan Moss &#xAD;Pachon said in a statement. Valentino apologized as well: &quot;We sincerely regret releasing a photo to the media this morning of Amy Adams with a Valentino Bag,&quot; they <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140410034821/http://bigstory.ap.org/article/valentino-apologizes-amy-adams-bag-gate">said in a statement</a>. &quot;We were not aware the photograph was taken while she was attending the wake of Philip Seymour Hoffman. It was an innocent mistake and we apologize to Ms. Adams who was not aware, or a part of, our PR efforts.&quot;</p>

<p>For what it&apos;s worth, the caption on the photos (see above) provided by Getty Images read: &quot;Amy Adams attends the wake for actor Philip Seymour Hoffman at the Frank E. Campbell Funeral Chapel on February 6, 2014 in New York City.&quot; It makes total sense that they could make that mistake then, if they, ya know, are illiterate. </p>

<p>Not to be outdone, UGG Australia <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140410034821/http://www.businessinsider.com/fashion-labels-at-philip-seymour-hoffman-funeral-2014-2">reportedly sent out</a> sheepskin boots as gifts to celebs &quot;for Hoffman&#x2019;s wake and funeral in the hopes they would wear them and be photographed.&quot; They gave this statement about it: &quot;UGG does not know nor would we presume to ask what our consumers or fans are doing in New York, or for what event or purpose they need the product. That is none of our business. UGG does not request photo opps from those to whom we gift product.&quot;</p>

<p>So fuck both of these companies. Let&apos;s stick with the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140410034821/http://gothamist.com/tags/catfashionshow">cat fashion shows</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140410034821/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20140208/upper-west-side/masculine-skirts-dresses-featured-uber-hip-mens-fall-line">masculine skirts.</a></p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: UGG spokesperson Kristen Scaravaglione sent us this statement about the boots and the Post&apos;s initial report:</p>

<blockquote>As we clearly told the NY Post reporter before she filed the story, UGG did not send boots to the friends of Philip Seymour Hoffman or his family in hopes they&apos;d wear them to his funeral.  We also have no knowledge or confirmation to whom she spoke to for the story, called out as an UGG Associate.
 
When it snows in New York, we get a lot of requests for boots from stylists for their clients.  When it&apos;s Fashion Week in New York,  we get a lot of requests.  When it snows during Fashion Week in New York, we got a lot more requests.  To the extent that we can, we provide product for stylists&apos; clients. We don&apos;t ask stylists for what purpose their clients need the product, and would not know if anyone who attended a funeral did so in our product.  It&apos;s not our business to know. And we certainly wouldn&apos;t then promote a sighting of a celebrity in our product when he or she is attending a funeral. It&apos;s just not done. At least not by UGG.</blockquote>
