<p>Upper West Side residents are up in arms over the forthcoming homeless invasion of Manhattan, and they&apos;re not just going to sit complacently and watch their change and their sidewalks disappear. Concerned residents packed into a meeting last night at Community Board 7 to protest a planned homeless facility on West 94th Street, which they believe could be the tipping point that turns the Upper West Side into <em>San Francisco</em>. &quot;<strong>It feels like a recurring nightmare to many of us. You&apos;re trying to convert it back to the 1970s</strong>,&quot; said Amanda Larrick, according <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170322113311/http://www.dnainfo.com/20110105/upper-west-side/upper-west-siders-want-planned-homeless-facility-stay-hotel">to DNAinfo</a>. Get out your tiny violins, because we&apos;re gonna have us a hoedown!</p>

<p>Nonprofit Samaritan Village wants to open the homeless facility in the space where the Hotel Alexander currently sits. That hotel will soon be forced out of business by a new law that outlaws using single-room occupancy (SRO) buildings as hotels. Residents argued that the neighborhood already sports 21 percent of the city&apos;s homeless shelters, and one more is just asking too much&#x2014;they believe another facility will attract more drug addicts and mentally ill people to the area. &quot;Everybody is in favor of affordable housing. (<strong>But) we have compassion fatigue. We shouldn&apos;t be the only place the city comes to,</strong>&quot; said West 94th Street resident Aaron Biller.  (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170322113311/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2011/01/05/uws-residents-oppose-new-homeless-shelter/">He also said,</a> &quot;Enough is enough because it will throw off the street life and make things more dangerous for people to walk down the street and we have school children to protect.&quot;)</p>

<p>Instead, residents think the new SRO law goes too far, and should be repealed: &quot;It&apos;s not just the owners of the buildings who are hurt, it&apos;s the local economy. Thousands of tourists were coming into the Upper West Side spending money, eating at restaurants, and now that&apos;s going to be gone,&quot; said Hotel Alexander owner Alexander Scharf. Community Board 7 ultimately passed a resolution calling on the city to prohibit using the SRO buildings for transitional housing programs, and instead open the gilded doors of housing to smelly, unkempt, crane-necked tourists.</p>
