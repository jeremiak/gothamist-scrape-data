<p>In response to the record-breaking number of summonses for bicyclists this year, as well as the NYPD&apos;s reluctance to release the data on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170311150716/http://gothamist.com/tags/cyclistcrackdown">cycling crackdown</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170311150716/http://transportationnation.org/2011/05/27/bike-ticketing-in-new-york-widespread-on-the-rise/">Transportation Nation have</a> crowd-sourced a map of the locations where cyclists have gotten tickets, and what for. Take a closer look at it below.</p>

<p>So far, they&apos;ve found that the most common violation was for running red lights, which brings a fine of up to a $270, followed by riding on the sidewalk, a $25-50 fine. Looking at the map, the worst areas for ticketing were Manhattan&#x2019;s West Side, Downtown, near the East River bridges, and in Downtown Brooklyn (especially along a stretch of Flushing near Brooklyn Navy Yard). According to a Post source, the NYPD <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170311150716/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/25/cyclist_class_action_lawsuit_expect.php">has issued</a> 13,843 tickets to cyclists in 2011, up from 9,345 tickets written over the same period in 2010, and 3,708 for the same period of 2009. </p>
