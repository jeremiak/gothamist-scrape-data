<p>A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507075134/http://gothamist.com/2014/02/15/comedian_struck_by_train_after_text.php">woman was struck by a train</a> after she slipped and fell (and/or fainted) on the platform while texting and walking last week. While comedian Liza Dye is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507075134/http://gothamist.com/2014/02/16/benefits_organized_to_help_comedian.php">still recovering</a> from her injuries, at least six more people either fell onto the subway tracks, or were struck by a subway this week, including one person who died.</p>

<p>The most recent incident occurred today: the MTA says a woman fell onto the roadbed of the A/C tracks at the Utica Avenue station in Brooklyn just before 1 p.m. They add she was helped up by other customers, and had no contract with the train; FDNY says she was taken to King&apos;s County Hospital in serious condition.</p>

<p>Last night around 1:50 a.m., a person was reported on the train tracks at Grand Central, though the FDNY had no more details on that incident. Around 8:30 p.m. Thursday night, FDNY says a man was struck by an F train at the Parsons Blvd Station; he was taken in serious condition to Jamaica Hospital.</p>

<p>Earlier on Thursday, an unidentified man fell on the tracks at the Second Avenue station in lower Manhattan around 12:30 a.m. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507075134/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/man-crushed-train-walking-subway-cars-article-1.1621018">He reportedly</a> slipped between subway cars, and was crushed by the train. He was declared dead at the scene.</p>

<p>On Monday, the FDNY says a man fell on the subway tracks at Gates Avenue around 6 p.m. He was taken to Woodhull Hospital with minor injuries. And two days before that, a man fell on the tracks and was struck by a train at Grand Concourse station in The Bronx. He was taken to Lincoln Hospital in serious condition.</p>

<p>It&apos;s worth noting that while the FDNY could confirm all the incidents, police said they only get notified when someone has died or there is a criminality suspected/involved. The MTA also says they don&apos;t receive notice of incidents unless there is some injury or disruption of train service&#x2014;so they didn&apos;t have much info about the incidents in which someone fell onto the tracks but was not struck by a train. Considering <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507075134/http://www.buzzfeed.com/passantino/fox-reporter-saves-man-who-fell-headfirst-onto-tracks">the dangerous conditions</a> in the city over the last few weeks, it seems safe to say that you should be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507075134/http://gothamist.com/tags/subwayfatalities">extra careful</a> on platforms this winter.</p>
