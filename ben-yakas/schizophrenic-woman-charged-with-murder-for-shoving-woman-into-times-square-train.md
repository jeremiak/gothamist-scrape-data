<p>The woman accused of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161111080437/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/07/times_square_subway_shove.php">fatally shoving another person</a> into an oncoming train in Times Square yesterday has been charged. </p>

<p>Suspect Melanie Liverpool-Turner, 30, has been charged with second-degree murder for pushing Connie Watton, 49, into an oncoming train. The incident happened around 1:30 p.m. Monday on the 1 train platform at the station. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161111080437/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/person-dies-shoved-front-times-square-subway-article-1.2862901">Witnesses said</a> they saw the two women arguing before the shove, but there&apos;s no indication that the two knew each other before the incident.</p>

<p>&quot;Our hearts go out to the victim and the other people who were on the platform and saw this,&quot; Manhattan Chief of Detectives William Aubry said at a press conference yesterday before Liverpool-Turner was charged. &quot;We are looking at video of this incident and the person of interest as they entered the station. We have numerous witnesses...People on the platform did exactly what we wanted [them] to. They saw something and said something.&quot;<br>

I push people in front of trains,&quot; she <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161111080437/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/person-dies-shoved-front-times-square-subway-article-1.2862901">reportedly told cops</a> at the time. Investigators determined that Liverpool-Turner had made up the story, but she was taken for a psychiatric evaluation at Beth Israel after that incident, which a source <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161111080437/http://nypost.com/2016/11/07/suspect-in-fatal-subway-push-lied-about-prior-platform-death/">told the Post</a> may have &quot;inspired her to do what she did today.&quot;</p>

<p>The brother of the victim <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161111080437/http://nypost.com/2016/11/08/woman-pushed-to-her-death-in-subway-was-a-wife-and-chef/">told the Post</a> that Watton&#x2019;s husband was completely distraught: &quot;He&#x2019;s not doing very well. He&#x2019;s in total shock,&quot; the relative said. &quot;I hope [Liverpool] gets prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Out of a million people, this had to happen to her?&quot; he added. &quot;She was honestly the most caring, loving, honest person I ever met. She would never hurt anybody. She never feared the city.&quot;<br>
