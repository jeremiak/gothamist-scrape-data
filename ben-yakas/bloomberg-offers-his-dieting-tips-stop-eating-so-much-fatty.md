<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130304024537/http://gothamist.com/tags/mayorbloomberg">Mayor Bloomberg</a> has made public health initiatives one of the cornerstones of his administration&#x2014;smoking, trans fats, salt, and now the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130304024537/http://gothamist.com/tags/sodaban">soda ban</a>, which kicks into effect on March 12th. But despite being a fat-hating autocrat, Bloomberg isn&apos;t without sympathy for those who are trying to shed pounds. This morning on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130304024537/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/mayor_bloomberg_oE8liLAyoaPArC3Df9RNWI?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20Local">his WOR radio program</a>, he gave some heartfelt advice to people trying to lose weight: stop eating so much, you fatties. &quot;If you eat less than 2,000 calories you&apos;ll lose weight,&quot; he said today. &quot;If you eat more than 2,000 calories, you&apos;ll gain weight. Now some things metabolize more quickly than others. And everyone says I should go on this kind of diet or that kind of diet. <strong>Don&apos;t eat and you&apos;ll lose weight.</strong>&quot; In other words: don&apos;t eat, and <em>just deal with it.</em></p>

<p>&quot;You have to run for half an hour for one muffin. So it&apos;s i not exercise, it&apos;s overeating. Exercise contributes,&quot; Bloomberg reasoned. Maybe this is why we&apos;ve see so many photos of Bloomberg eating things, but almost none of him working out. After all, it took a blizzard for him to spend any time with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130304024537/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/08/video_mayor_bloomberg_updates_the_c.php">his &quot;running machine&quot; lately.</a> </p>

<p>Considering that all but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130304024537/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/28/bloombergs_soda_ban_still_unpopular.php">the skinniest of Manhattan-ites seem to be against</a> the soda ban, Bloomberg spent some more time defending it, arguing it was an educational measure more than anything else: &quot;So it&apos;s an educational thing. It doesn&apos;t prevent you from doing it, and it doesn&apos;t mean a store has to charge you more. I mean, it&apos;s ridiculous to say it&apos;s the cost of an extra cup. If the cost of an extra cup is really a detriment if they&apos;re going to be in business, they&apos;re not going to be in business.&quot;</p>

<p>Which is all a very nice way of saying, &quot;don&apos;t blame me if movie theaters start charging more for drinks, they don&apos;t have to!&quot; At least we now know that Bloomberg likely doesn&apos;t go for &quot;You&apos;re The One For Me, Fatty&quot; at karaoke nights in Bermuda:</p>
