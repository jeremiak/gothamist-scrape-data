The victim has now been identified as Andrew Quinn,  a real-estate analyst who graduated from Cornell. His mother Linda Quinn is asking for help identifying the driver who struck him: &#x201C;That person needs to know what he did. He needs to know that he took a life that didn&#x2019;t need to be taken,&#x201D; she <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150710071406/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/chelsea_hit_run_horror_KfZh9mCRicxW64NPgYvpuI?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Manhattan">told the Post</a>. &#x201C;Then to leave? Who does that?&#x201D;<p></p>

<p>Police say Quinn was struck by a southbound-travelling vehicle around 3 a.m. while crossing at W. 23rd Street and 12th Avenue. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150710071406/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2013/03/09/man-struck-killed-by-vehicle-in-chelsea/">Quinn&apos;s mother told CBS that</a> passersby tried to help her son to no avail: &#x201C;There were four people on the street somewhere who helped him, and one person gave him mouth to mouth, but it was already too late,&#x201D; she said.</p>

<p>&#x201C;Somebody may have seen something, or one of this person&#x2019;s friends will see damage for the car - because there has to be some kind of damage to the car for the impact to be so great to kill him instantly, is what I&#x2019;m thinking,&#x201D; she added. </p>

<p>Quinn, who grew up in Morris Plains, NJ, had recently moved to the city after getting a job Tishman Hotel &amp; Realty. &#x201C;Andrew was a smart and engaging member of our team,&#x201D; Tishman spokesman John Gallagher <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150710071406/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/man-killed-hit-and-run-west-side-highway-article-1.1283839?localLinksEnabled=false">told the News</a>. &#x201C;He had a bright future ahead of him. We extend our deepest sympathy to his family and friends, and will keep them in our thoughts and prayers.&#x201D;</p>

<p>No arrests have been made so far, and cops say the investigation is ongoing.</p>
