<p>From NY Times trend pieces to street Frogger, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430042756/http://gothamist.com/tags/seinfeld"><em>Seinfeld</em></a> looks less like a sitcom as the years go by, and more and more like a documentary on the weird lives of New Yorkers. The latest real life <em>Seinfeld</em> story comes from Lawrence County, Pennsylvania, where <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430042756/http://www.post-gazette.com/stories/local/neighborhoods-north/lawsuit-settled-after-poppyseed-bagel-and-positive-drug-test-led-to-baby-taken-from-its-mother-662383/?utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;utm_medium=twitter">a woman successfully sued</a> because her newborn child was taken from her for five days following a false-positive drug test that was caused by (you guessed it) eating a poppyseed bagel. It&apos;s not easy being a real life Elaine.</p>

<p>If you need any more proof that you ought not binge on poppyseed bagels in the days before any urine tests, this was also the subject of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430042756/http://dsc.discovery.com/tv-shows/mythbusters/videos/poppy-seed-drug-test-minimyth.htm">a Mythbusters investigation</a> into the &quot;poppyseed drug test minimyth.&quot; They learned that it&apos;s especially bad if you happen to love poppyseed cake.</p>
