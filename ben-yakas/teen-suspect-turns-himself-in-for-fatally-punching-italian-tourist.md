<p>The teen accused of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140529004349/http://gothamist.com/2014/05/24/italian_tourist_dies_after_being_fa.php">punching an Italian tourist to death</a> in the Bronx earlier this weekend has turned himself in. Brownie Lopez-Hidalgo, 19, surrendered to police at the 48th Precinct in the Bronx around 5 p.m. Sunday. He <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140529004349/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/man-surrenders-bodega-death-article-1.1805220">has been charged</a> with assault in the death of 37-year-old tourist Oliver D&#x2019;Orio.</p>

<p>D&apos;Orio, a Switzerland resident who was visiting his girlfriend in the city for the last 10 days, was punched in the face around 12:10 a.m. Saturday in front of Guerrero Bodega on Washington Avenue and East 184th Street. He hit his head on the sidewalk, immediately lost consciousness, and later died.</p>

<p>Witnesses say that D&apos;Orio appeared to be drunk that night (and was carrying a banana), approaching various customers at the bodgea&#x2014;including the suspect&#x2014;asking for alcohol when the incident happened: &quot;[D&apos;Orio] was pestering [the suspect], saying, &apos;Buy me a beer, buy me a beer,&apos;&quot; bodega clerk Julio Minier told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140529004349/http://nypost.com/2014/05/25/man-confesses-after-killing-tourist-in-bodega-brawl/">the Post.</a> &quot;They came out onto the street and when the fight started he punched him with an open hand. The man went down. I knew he was dead when he hit the ground.&quot;</p>
