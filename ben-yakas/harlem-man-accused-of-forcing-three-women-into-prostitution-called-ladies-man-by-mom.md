<p>An East Harlem man <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408135902/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Missing-Teenage-Girl-Found-Held-Against-Will-East-Harlem-Apartment-Suspect-Sex-Trafficking-207019071.html">has been arrested and accused</a> of forcing three women, including a teen, into prostitution. Taye Ellerby, 35, is accused of holding a 24-year old woman, a 21-year-old woman, and a missing 17-year-old from Connecticut, in a home in the Taft Houses on Madison Ave. near E. 112th Street. &quot;He had [the girls] lined up sitting on the couch,&quot; neighbor Jeanette Martinez <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408135902/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/east-harlem-man-forces-women-17-year-old-girl-sex-trade-article-1.1341179">told the News</a>. &#x201C;High-class white men would come and pick one out. But when the girls did something wrong, you could hear them screaming.&#x201D; </p>

<p>Police believe Ellerby didn&apos;t abduct the women, but did coerce them to stay and forced them to have sex with men by force: &#x201C;If they tried to leave, the pimp would hurt them. They got beat up a lot,&#x201D; a source <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408135902/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/brute_busted_as_harlem_pimp_OHmUSl2pLXvxvDcONf2xmM?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Manhattan">told the Post</a>. That source added that he was advertising the women on Backpage.com and was clearing $300 a day on each one. </p>

<p>Ellerby has been charged with sex trafficking, promoting prostitution, and endangering the welfare of a child. But his mother defended him, saying he had lots of girlfriends (he has six children by five women) and wasn&apos;t a pimp: &#x201C;How could he be holding them against their will if they can come and go?&#x201D; asked his mom, Theresa. &#x201C;He&#x2019;s a ladies man.&quot;</p>
