Rodney Cotton filed the suit in Manhattan Criminal Court, alleging that when he was finally taken to Bellevue Hospital for emergency surgery, the operation didn&#x2019;t go well. Unfortunately&#x2014;or fortunately&#x2014;it doesn&apos;t get into any more details of what &quot;didn&apos;t go well&quot; could possibly mean for the man&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150611215541/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/05/suffering_disabling_erection_man_al.php">Chattanooga One-Step.</a><p></p>

<p>You may be surprised, but this far from the first time a NY prisoner found himself dealing with such a problem&#x2014;back in 2006, David Yaduallah <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150611215541/http://gothamist.com/2009/06/08/prison_inmate_sues_over_55_hour_ere.php">had an erection for more than two days straight</a> (the result of a increase in Seroquel, an anti-psychotic medication that can cause side-effects such as &quot;persistent and painful erections&quot;). He sued the infirmary nurse (Judith Lovelace!) for &quot;cruel and uncivilized conduct&quot; because she didn&apos;t help his erection go away, causing him to suffer permanent damage. </p>

<p>But wait, there&apos;s more! Earlier this year, Connecticut bus driver Daren Scott <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150611215541/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/05/suffering_disabling_erection_man_al.php">suffered a  &quot;disabling erection,&quot;</a> and ended up suing Yale-New Haven Hospital ER because doctors ignored him in favor of watching a baseball game.  Of course, none of these stories comes close to topping <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150611215541/http://msnbc.msn.com/id/13509704/#.UGdLp8hSQfF">Charles &quot;Chick&quot; Lennon</a>, who got a penile implant that caused him to have <strong>a 10-year erection</strong> which prevented him from riding a bike, hugging people, and spending time with his grandchildren.</p>
