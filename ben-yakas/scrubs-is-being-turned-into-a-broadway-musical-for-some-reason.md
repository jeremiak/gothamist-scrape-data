<p>Plenty of musicals have been turned into movies, and plenty of movies have been turned into musicals. But a TV show being turned into a musical? Now you&apos;re <em>blowing my mind man</em>. But <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408100933/http://insidetv.ew.com/2014/02/13/scrubs-broadway-musical-movie-bill-lawrence/">according to creator Bill Lawrence</a>, that&apos;s just what he has in store for his now-retired sitcom, <em>Scrubs</em>. If any TV show can pull it off, it&apos;s probably the one which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408100933/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Musical">had one of their best episodes</a> done in the style of a musical, climaxing with &quot;Guy Love.&quot;</p>

<p>Of course, considering that they already pulled off a musical episode in 2007, and the fact the show has been off the air since 2010 (counting one ill-advised sort-of spinoff season), it seems odd that Lawrence is doing this now. But you can thank the British for this one: &quot;Randall Winston, who&#x2019;s part of my company here and produced Scrubs, was talking to a British theater group, and it turns out Scrubs is very, very big in the U.K.,&quot; Lawrence explained to EW. </p>

<p>He went into more details with EW:</p>

<blockquote><strong>Where does it stand now?</strong>
<br><br>
We&#x2019;re negotiating with different theater groups who will hopefully put up the money for a year to pay the composers to develop [spec songs]. Disney has nicely become a silent partner in giving the rights for us to go shop it. And the most fun thing for a theater junkie is we&#x2019;ve already reached the stage that various composers have been submitting songs based on an outline that we put together for the type of stuff we would do.
<br><br>
<strong>What&#x2019;s in that outline? Do you know what story you want to tell?</strong>
<br><br>
We have an outline basically showing where we&#x2019;re looking for songs, how we would intend to do fantasies, how we would use that a cappella band as a Greek chorus that would be on stage singing the theme when people come in. When that outline goes out to composers, they&#x2019;ll know the tone because they&#x2019;ve seen the show and some of the musical stuff we&#x2019;ve done. If I did Scrubs, I would do it as the Legally Blonde or Wicked model. It&#x2019;s all the same characters. The outline is kind of a mishmash of the pilot episode mushed together with the episode where Mrs. Landingham from The West Wing dies. We&#x2019;re combining two of our best stories with what we&#x2019;re allowed to cull and choose from our best comedic moments and fantasies from nine years of the show.</blockquote>

<p>We never realized there was such a passionate audience out there for <em>Scrubs</em>, which was always a pretty solid show (check out <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408100933/http://www.avclub.com/tv/scrubs/?season=3">The AV Club&apos;s reviews if you doubt it</a>) but has never been considered a classic (nor was it ever a ratings bonanza). But in this age of resurrected cult shows, anything is possible...except getting Zach Braff to star in the musical, apparently. </p>

<p>&quot;Zach will be involved creatively because he&#x2019;s a theater lover like me, but part of the fun for us is that we would go with Broadway musical stars,&quot; Lawrence said. But there could be at least one cameo from the show: &quot;The only people I could see reprising their roles are Ted&#x2019;s a cappella band [The Blanks]. The reason that we put them on <em>Scrubs</em> in the first place, besides the fact that they&#x2019;re funny, is that they are all musical theater guys.&quot;</p>
