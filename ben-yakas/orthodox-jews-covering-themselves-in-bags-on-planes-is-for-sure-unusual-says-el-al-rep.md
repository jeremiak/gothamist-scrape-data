<p>Yesterday, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141023002849/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/11/photo_orthodox_jewish_man_covers_hi.php">we were perplexed and intrigued by a photo</a> of an Orthodox Jewish man covered in a plastic bag on an airline flight. It turned out that the man is a Kohen, holy priests (and their descendants) who are prohibited from flying over cemeteries for religious reasons. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141023002849/http://www.haaretz.com/news/ultra-orthodox-passengers-riot-aboard-el-al-plane-over-screening-of-film-1.243447">After some brainstorming</a>, Rabbi Yosef Shalom Eliashiv had suggested that &quot;wrapping oneself in thick plastic bags while the plane crossed over the cemetery is permissible.&quot; However, we talked to a spokeswoman for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141023002849/http://www.elal.co.il/elal/english/states/general/">El Al</a>, Israel&apos;s national airline, who told us this is no longer a concern&#x2014;because planes have been specifically re-routed to not fly over cemeteries anymore. Having said that, &quot;it&apos;s for sure unusual,&quot; rep Sheryl Stein told us.</p>

<p>Stein said she believed the photo in yesterday&apos;s post was at least ten years old: &quot;[A colleague] remembered this from at least 10 years ago,&quot; she said, noting how memorable it was. An article <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141023002849/http://www.yated.com/kohanim-concerns-while-flying-to-and-from-eretz-yisroel.0-576-0.html">delving into the details of the issue in Yated</a> had estimated that there would still be problems with routes through 2013, but Stein says it has since been remedied: &quot;I don&apos;t think it happens anymore.&quot; </p>

<p>We&apos;ve been sent another photo of a Kohen covered on a plane (which we haven&apos;t been able to date yet). When asked whether El Al would supply a flier with a bag if they so requested, Stein said she believed they would: &quot;I don&apos;t think it&apos;s an issue at all.&quot; </p>

<p>According to frequent flier and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141023002849/http://zeevback.blogspot.com/">blogger</a> Ze&apos;ev Back (who works in Israel), El Al goes out of their way to accomodate extremely religious Jews to a fault: &quot;Flights are delayed because these fanatic Jews refuse to take their seat next to a woman. The air companies are afraid to lose this clients or be accused of antisemitism, so instead of throwing their suitcase out of the plane and leave them behind&#x2014;the flight attendants start going down the aisle looking for a volunteer to swap seats. In the meantime the pilot loses its slot and has to wait for a new allocated slot, damaging everybody in the name of their religion.&quot;</p>

<p>Even so, you can&apos;t please everyone: in 2008, Orthodox Jewish rabbis gave El Al low ratings <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141023002849/http://www.vosizneias.com/17973/2008/07/11/israel-orthodox-rabbis-give-el-al-low-ranking-for-permitting-in-flight-movies/">because they allowed in-flight movies on flights.</a> <br>
 <br>
The real loser in this whole Kohen/plastic bag/airline grab bag? A little company <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141023002849/http://www.nbcnews.com/id/12185015/#.UWhdsCvuVg8">called poshAir</a>, who had a simple dream: to create the world&apos;s first in-flight sleeping bag. Unfortunately, the $99.99 poshAir bags, made of 65 percent polyester and 35 percent cotton machine-washable fleece, never quite caught on, and the company doesn&apos;t even <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141023002849/http://poshair.com/?nr=0">seem to have a website anymore.</a> It could have been the perfect, comfortable niche product for a niche market.</p>
