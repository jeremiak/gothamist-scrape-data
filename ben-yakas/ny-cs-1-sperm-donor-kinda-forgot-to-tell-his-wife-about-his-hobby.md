<p>Last weekend, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108030232/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/12/cuny_professor_who_has_sired_22_kid.php">we learned all about Ari Nagel</a>, a 40-year-old CUNY Kingsborough math professor who has dedicated the last decade of his life to donating sperm directly to women around NYC. It was a perfect pre-Father&apos;s Day tabloid fairytale about a white knight who (literally) gets off on the idea of making would-be moms happy, even if it meant him jacking off in Target bathrooms. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108030232/http://nypost.com/2016/06/19/sperm-donor-that-sired-22-kids-has-a-wife-and-shes-not-happy/">the Post put</a> a pin prick in this charming tale of altruistic onanism when they revealed that Nagel is actually married&#x2014;and a source says his wife didn&apos;t know the extent of his side hobby. Nagel told them his wife is &quot;livid&quot; about the front page story, and &quot;she&#x2019;s been yelling at me a lot.&quot;</p>

<p>Nagel, who has donated sperm directly to 18 women over the last 12 years producing 22 children, initially told the tabloid he had a robust dating life despite his lifestyle (or as he not-so-delicately put it, &quot;Never underestimate the desperation of a single woman on the Upper West Side&quot;). His heretofore unmentioned wife, Roxanne, apparently &quot;had no idea this was happening,&quot; or at the very least, didn&apos;t know it was <em>still</em> happening. &#x201C;Of course she knew what was going on,&#x201D; Nagel told the Post, adding that their union is &#x201C;complicated&quot; because, &quot;she didn&#x2019;t support it. She always wanted me to be a regular, traditional spouse.&quot;</p>

<p>It turns out his wife is the woman he conceived his first child with. That son is now 12, but the two actually have more kids, including two daughters ages 2 and 5. &quot;When she saw me donating to all these women, she asked, &#x2018;Why are they worthy and I&#x2019;m not?,&apos;&quot; he explained. Nevertheless, Nagel describes it as a marriage of convenience (we get the feeling it won&apos;t be that convenient after all this extra publicity), noting that he and his wife &quot;sleep in separate bedrooms.&quot;<br>

<p>Despite the troubles at home, Nagel seems delighted by all the extra attention he&apos;s gotten, noting he&apos;s had emails from women in the &quot;triple digits.&quot; He&#x2019;s heard from women &quot;all over the world, places I never heard of. Almost all of them want to have a baby, but some want to hook up.&quot; </p>

<p>Something tells us he has no plans on giving up his solitary practice. And something tell us this will stand as our favorite tabloid story of the summer until a shark or whatever rides the subway.</p>
