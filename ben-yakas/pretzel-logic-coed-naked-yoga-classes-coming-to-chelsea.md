title: Pretzel Logic: Coed Naked Yoga Classes Coming To Chelsea

										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="121213coedyoga.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509171109im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/121213coedyoga.jpeg" width="640" height="401"> <br> <i> This is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509171109/http://www.boldnaked.com/">Bold &amp; Naked&apos;s logo</a>, for some non-orgasmic reason</i></div> <p></p>

<p>Last year, a yoga studio in Chelsea phased out women <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509171109/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/12/mens_only_naked_yoga_studio_launche.php">and rebranded as Le Male Yoga</a>, offering up all nude classes to a testosterone-fueled clientele. Le Male Yoga has now re-rebranded as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509171109/http://www.boldnaked.com/">Bold &amp; Naked Yoga</a>, and is welcoming women back into the fold&#x2014;and along with them come women-only and coed naked yoga classes. But there&apos;s nothing sexual about it. </p>

<p>The women-only classes will be different from the studio&apos;s all-male, over-55 naked classes: &quot;We work a little more in emotional psychologies, to really help women to feel good about themselves,&quot; owner Joschi Schwarz <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509171109/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20131212/chelsea/naked-yoga-expands-classes-women-seniors">told DNAInfo.</a> <br>
&quot;It&apos;s a different way of thinking in yoga land.&quot; As for the coed classes, Schwarz insists there&apos;s nothing sexual about it&#x2014;on the website, it even states, &quot;If you are looking for an orgasm, you are in the wrong place.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I know sexuality is always in people&apos;s minds and I have a feeling that a lot of people don&#x2019;t know that yoga has nothing to do with sex at all &#x2014; it has to do with sensuality, there&#x2019;s nothing wrong with that,&quot; Schwarz added. There are of course also regular old vanilla clothed yoga classes at the studio, but it&apos;s not quite as exciting when it&apos;s something <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509171109/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/18/stretch_and_the_city_shopping_yogi.php">you can do in the back of the cab</a>.</p>
