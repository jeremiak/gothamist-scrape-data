<p>&quot;Also please rain hell on Robert Sietsema for daring to insult pizza bagels.&quot; With one Gchat, my entire day was tilted off of its axis. Robert Sietsema, the highly respected former Village Voice and current Eater food critic, published a list of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509214637/http://ny.eater.com/archives/2014/03/four_pizzas_from_hell.php">four pizzas from hell on Friday</a>, variations on pizza that in his view twisted the delicate ratio of cheese-to-tomato and turned it &quot;repulsive rather than tolerable.&quot; He declares that pizza bagels are &quot;profoundly unsatisfying if you&apos;re craving real pizza.&quot; Which only confirms that Sietsema has never had a real homemade pizza bagel&#x2014;because he is dead wrong about them.</p>

<p>I&apos;ve been making homemade pizza bagels for friends for the past couple years&#x2014;at first it was something closer to a joke, an admission that my basic skills as a chef were limited to cheese-based bread mashups. It felt inelegant, but it was in my wheelhouse, and no one complained. Actually, it soon became quite the opposite: those skeptical friends who started out bemused at the chance to reconnect with a long-lost part of their childhood quickly transformed into people actively requesting I make them for dinner parties and TV viewings. Someone once suggested I open a pizza bagel truck, which I&apos;m still seriously considering.</p>

<p>Like most things in the kitchen, it&apos;s all about what ingredients you use. While I don&apos;t make the sauce from scratch (I use a mixture of a sweet tomato sauce and a garlic/basil one, though I like trying more exotic variations as well), the recipe I&apos;ve honed over the years involves various spices, Greek olive oil, a melange of veggies (onions, green peppers, mushrooms, etc) and for non-vegetarians, sausage and pepperoni. It&apos;s topped by a mixture of various cheese shavings (everything from three blend shredded cheese to actual slices of fresh mozzarella) and plenty of oregano. And I only use fresh bagels from Absolute Bagels, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509214637/http://gothamist.com/2014/02/26/the_best_bagels_in_nyc.php">the best in the city.</a></p>

<p>The recipe is simple because pizza bagels (like good old fashioned pizzas) are their best when they&apos;re simple&#x2014;but just because something&apos;s simple doesn&apos;t mean it can&apos;t be delicious and satisfying, as any amateur who has experimented with making pasta or grilled cheese knows. And the pizza bagels I make have nothing to do with &quot;some stale bagels [I] found in the fridge&quot;&#x2014;nor am I a harried mom intent on stuffing my friends with processed cheese (although there&apos;s NOTHING wrong with processed cheese, long live the Laughing Cow).</p>

<p>I&apos;m not really angry; I pity Sietsema and the scores of other people who don&apos;t understand pizza bagels can exist outside of a frozen box. Though I do acknowledge that cliche exists: I, like many suburban kids, grew up snacking on frozen pizza (DiGiorno!) and Bagel Bites, and there is a goofy nostalgia that I get when I tell someone I&apos;m making them pizza bagels. </p>

<p>Pizza bagels also point to a larger issue I have with food snobs (not to single out <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509214637/http://ny.eater.com/tags/sietsema">Sietsema as one</a>): the joy and excitement of cooking should not be limited to those who are already great at cooking. It&apos;s always been very, very intimidating for a layman like myself to approach slicing and dicing at home&#x2014;especially having grown up in a household with a mother who cooked incredible meals six nights of the week, and who stalked the kitchen like a proud lioness. When I was younger, pizza bagels were a gateway drug, a way for me to warily experiment with cooking on my own. </p>

<p>To make a comparison: it doesn&apos;t matter if you make a TV show about cops or nurses or lawyers or serial killers. If you have great writing and great acting, you could make a TV show about boring old ad executives and turn it into one of the most compelling shows in the history of the medium. Done with the right ingredients and a whole lot of affection, pizza bagels are the same.</p>

<p>Am I saying that pizza bagels are the <em>Mad Men</em> of foods? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509214637/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suRDUFpsHus">Well, in Greek,</a> pizza bagel literally means the pain from an old wound. It&apos;s a twinge in your heart, far more powerful than memory alone. <em>So you tell me.</em><br>
 <br>
But maybe that is all besides the point: as long as pizza&apos;s on a bagel, you can have pizza any time, and any time is exactly when I want pizza.</p>
