<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425003922/http://gothamist.com/tags/hurricaneirene">Hurricane Irene</a> is here...and with her comes a tornado watch from the National Weather Service! The watch will be in effect in all five boroughs until 5 a.m.; according <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425003922/http://twitter.com/#!/NY1weather/status/107606472711602176">to NY1</a>, there&apos;s no need to panic (any extra), because this is common with hurricanes. But that&apos;s not the only thing Irene brought with her&#x2014;the first power outages have been reported in Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island.</p>
