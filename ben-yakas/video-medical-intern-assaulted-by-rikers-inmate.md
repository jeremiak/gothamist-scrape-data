<p>A 24-year-old medical intern was viciously assaulted by an inmate at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140424044535/http://gothamist.com/tags/rikers">Rikers Island</a> this week. Joseph McRae was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140424044535/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/bronx/rikers-intern-viciously-assaulted-mental-patient-article-1.1760084">caught on surveillance video</a> punching Stephanie Porcelli in the lockup&#x2019;s George R. Vierno Center around 11:30 a.m. Wednesday. Porcelli suffered a broken jaw and multiple facial fractures in the unprovoked attack. You can see video of it below.</p>

<p>In the video, you can see McRae feigning a punch before actually doing so; it&apos;s unclear whether Porcelli spoke to him before he punched her, sending her flying onto her back. Porcelli underwent surgery on Friday for her facial injuries. McRae, 24, was arrested in July 2013 and charged with two counts of assault for allegedly striking two women in the face at Penn Station. </p>
