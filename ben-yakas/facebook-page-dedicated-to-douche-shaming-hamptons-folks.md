</div></div>					<p>For those of us living safely in the five boroughs, occasional news reports of douchey Hamptons behavior are usually enough to satisfy our craving for aristocratic absurdity&#x2014;read one article about people who enjoy <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150512205911/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/25/the_hamptons_celebrates_memorial_da.php">$25K bottles of champagne chilled during a 10,000-foot free-fall served by a skydiver</a>, you&apos;ve read them all. But the regular folks who reside in the Hamptons and suffer through the stampede of douchebags every summer need something<em> more</em>. This is the essential service that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150512205911/https://www.facebook.com/groups/douchespotter/">Facebook page &quot;Douche Spotter&quot;</a> is now providing.</p>

<p>A lot of the group is dedicated to people venting about inconsiderate parking jobs, socks-and-sandals rage, butt-revealing shorts-wearing hipsters, shudder-inducing vanity license plates, and uh, angry Heather Mills. &#x201C;This all started last summer when I saw a guy doing something really annoying, and I just wanted to punch him in the face,&#x201D; James Cuomo, the 26-year-old construction worker who started the page, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150512205911/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/the_boors_of_summer_1tKu1H53ViVaBSDqgiMMkM">told the Post</a>. &#x201C;But I figured that it would be smarter to go after him on Facebook instead.&#x201D;</p>

<p>You have to be a group member now in order to enjoy the douchebaggery, but we&apos;ve put some highlights above so you can understand just what car eyelashes are and why you should loathe them. </p>
