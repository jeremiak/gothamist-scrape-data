Warren Billings, 38, was shot one time in his shop on Cortelyou Road near Flatbush Ave. at approximately 4 p.m. on Saturday. &quot;I only heard one shot, and I saw a shadow run by the store as fast as he could,&quot; said Winston Levy, who was working next door.<p></p>

<p>Billings, who had come to the city from Jamaica, had taken over a former beauty salon and turned it into a barbershop about a year ago. Neighbors told police that he had been seen in an argument with another man at the shop on Friday night, but it&apos;s unclear whether that argument was related. </p>

<p>This is the second shooting to occur around a barbershop this week: on Wednesday, 79-year-old bystander Andrew Burke <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508081519/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local/new_york&amp;id=8371909">was killed in front of Fest&apos;s Barbershop</a> in Bedford-Stuyvesant when three men rushed into the shop shooting at each other. Police are still looking for the shooters in that incident.</p>
