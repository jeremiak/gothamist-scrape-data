Of course, Samuels made one fatal error: he stole <em>Mets</em> memorabilia. As much as we love him, a signed picture of Benny Agbayani will most likely NOT make you millions of dollars.<p></p>

<p>Queens District Attorney Richard Brown <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110521081805/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/queens/scheme_to_cheat_the_mets_EVhohxEoNVqtCkk0cw9gKL">explained</a> the high-stakes world of sports memorabilia: &quot;The autographed sports memorabilia and collectibles industry has become a multibillion-dollar industry, and this case exposes its darker side -- the enthusiast who does not collect for personal enjoyment but rather stockpiles hundreds of pieces of sports memorabilia as a long-term investment.&quot; In addition to the accusations that he stole the memorabilia, Samuels is also accused of falsifying business records so he could skim $25,000 off meal money the Mets provide to umpires, and of cheating on his city and state taxes to save $24,000 over two years by not declaring the tips players gave him.</p>

<p>Samuels&apos; lawyer argued that he had a right to the memorabilia, and had done nothing sketchy by getting players to autograph them, bad baseball puns and all: &quot;Charlie was entitled to the unsigned property, and over time had players sign it...It was throwaway material. After reviewing the indictment, we are shocked at the nature of these accusations. The indictment barely made it to first base.&quot; Samuels faces between 8 1/3 and 25 years in prison if convicted. He better get Jose Reyes&apos; autograph quick, before he&apos;s traded <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110521081805/http://insider.espn.go.com/mlb/insider/news/story?id=6527609&amp;action=login&amp;appRedirect=http%3a%2f%2finsider.espn.go.com%2fmlb%2finsider%2fnews%2fstory%3fid%3d6527609">for pennies on the dollar.</a></p>
