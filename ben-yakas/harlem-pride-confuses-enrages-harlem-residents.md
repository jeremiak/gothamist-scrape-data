title: "Harlem Pride" Confuses, Enrages Harlem Residents

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:300px; "> <img alt="6211harlempride.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110604082723im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/6211harlempride.jpg" width="300" height="163"> <br> <i><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110604082723/http://www.harlempride.org/pages/photos?folder_id=191">Harlem Pride 2010</a></i></div> The second annual <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110604082723/http://www.harlempride.org/">Harlem Pride</a> event is coming up on June 24-26; the weekend-long celebration of gay pride in Harlem includes a barbecue, bowling and a dance party. But many people are confused about the name of the event, while others are just enraged at the idea of it. &quot;<strong>If children start to believe it is okay to be gay, they will think it&apos;s okay to be a pedophile or have sex with animals. It&apos;s a slippery slope</strong>,&quot; said Dr. Ronald Ferguson.<p></p>

<p>Ferguson, the senior pastor at Antioch Church of God on W. 124th St., <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110604082723/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2011/06/02/2011-06-02_gay_pride_events_irk_harlem_pastors.html">told the News</a> he had spoken directly with God, and God was very displeased with the thought of gay people drinking sea breeze&apos;s, sharing picnic baskets, and lathering suntan lotion onto each others backs: &quot;This gay pride nonsense is an abomination. <strong>God does not want to see homosexuals in our parks</strong>.&quot; Pastor Charles Curtis of Mount Olivet Baptist Church agreed, although he didn&apos;t mention if God had specified to him about whether mimosas are appropriate in the mid-afternoon: &quot;The park is a family area, and the homosexual agenda will do nothing but harm the community.&quot; </p>

<p>But even regular Harlem residents who aren&apos;t spewing forth hateful bile have also been a bit confused about the event:  <strong>&quot;When people hear &apos;Harlem Pride,&apos; they think proud of living in Harlem or proud to be black</strong>,&quot; said Harlem Pride President Carmen Neely. Nevertheless, the group doesn&apos;t plan on changing their name, nor backing down in the face of the verbal tirades: &quot;I want the gay and lesbian people of uptown to have a celebration of our own. This will be different than the events in the West Village because it will be filled with people of color. <strong>I realize the church plays a big role in the black community, but we&apos;re people, too, and deserve our day in the sun.&quot;</strong></p>
