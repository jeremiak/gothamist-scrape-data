And while there are no immediate health risks to women who have taken pills with the &quot;packaging error,&quot; you may be in store for an unexpected surprise: &quot;The unintended consequence of pregnancy is really the issue. That&apos;s why the company took a drastic action,&quot; said spokesman Kevin Wiggins. That seems pretty bad, but at least there&apos;s nothing wrong with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502174414/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/2011/09/17/2011-09-17_chinese_condoms_too_small_for_south_africa_judge_rules.html">our backup Chinese condoms.</a><p></p>

<p>The not quite aptly-named Qualitest Pharmaceuticals issued the massive recall not to boost the gynecological industry, but rather because &quot;select blisters (found inside the pill box) were rotated 180 degrees within the card, reversing the weekly tablet orientation.&quot; This left the pills&apos; lot number, as well as the expiration date, &quot;no longer visible,&quot; and as a result of the error, &quot;the daily regimen for these oral contraceptives may be incorrect and could leave women without adequate contraception, and at risk for unwanted pregnancy,&quot; the company said.</p>

<p>The company issued a statement saying, &quot;The source of the error is currently under investigation and the company is committed to rectifying the issue in a timely manner.&quot; As <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502174414/http://jezebel.com/5841319/the-massive-birth-control-recall-and-how-it-affects-you">Jezebel points out</a>, it&apos;s not always a simple thing to rectify an unexpected pregnancy, especially of the Peggy Olsen-variety. But then again, maybe this&apos;ll make for appointment TV reenactments!</p>
