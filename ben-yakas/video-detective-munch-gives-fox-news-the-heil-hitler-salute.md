<p>Actor and comedian Richard Belzer, better known to the western civilization as the inimitable Detective Munch, was on Fox New York this morning to promote the 14th season of <em>Law and Order: SVU</em> on DVD. And as you may have imagined, the conversation included lots of talk of sodomy and furniture-banging, as well as a Nazi salute. Watch below!</p>

<p>The sodomy and furniture-banging was in reference to whether Fox host David Price might ever guest star on the show: &quot;If he gets molested and banged in the ass,&quot; Belzer cracked, then adding: &quot;I meant banged against a piece of furniture.&quot; Before the segment ended, Belzer gave a Nazi salute and told the anchors to &quot;say Heil to all your colleagues in the other division&quot; (something which Belzer also did at a red carpet event back in June.) </p>

<p>Belzer&apos;s rep <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170227014951/http://www.tmz.com/2012/10/03/richard-belzer-trainwreck-interview-molestation-sodomy-and-hitler/">explained to TMZ</a> that it was a &quot;satirical gesture toward Fox News...whose ideology he is opposed to.&quot; Lest you weren&apos;t in on the LOLs, they added, &quot;The other portion was a joke pertaining to the material of Richard&apos;s TV show, which he tweaked at the last minute to make about furniture. A joke is a joke.&quot; We get that Belzer likes being racy with Hitler humor (he is Jewish and all), but there&apos;s nothing funny about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170227014951/http://babies-kids.pricegrabber.com/baby-high-chairs/i+ve+been+sodomized/p/1005/">furniture sodomy.</a> <br>
