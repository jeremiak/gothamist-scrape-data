<p>A cab driver has been accused of whipping a passenger with a belt in Brooklyn after the passenger claimed she couldn&apos;t pay her fare.</p>

<p>Police say the incident happened around 1:20 a.m. on Aug. 23rd near the intersection of Johnson Avenue and White Street in East Williamsburg. The 21-year-old passenger, whose name has not been released, had gotten into the taxi in Midtown, but told the driver she didn&apos;t have enough money to pay the fare when she reached her destination.</p>

Witness Ramiro Sandoval said he heard the woman yelling: &quot;This woman was screaming her gut out. It was terrifying,&quot; he said. &quot;I see a guy just holding a woman by her hair, whipping the hell out of her.&quot; </p>

<p>Sandoval called 911 while another passerby approached the driver, who allegedly left the woman sobbing in the street and fled the scene. She was taken to a local hospital for welts.</p>

<p>Cops say no arrests have been made, and the investigation is ongoing. </p>
