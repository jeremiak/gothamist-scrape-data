<p>The wife of a Bronx NYPD precinct commander was beaten to a pulp by two masked men this week, and police who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150730152913/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/bronx/love_triangle_cop_violence_tNImbzLeoR0gvvBIe5nLfJ?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">are investigating</a> what might have led to the incident&#x2014; believe it may be the result of a forbidden cop love triangle gone off-the-rails.</p>

<p>Last Friday, Deputy Inspector John D&apos;Adamo, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150730152913/http://www.nyc.gov/html/nypd/html/precincts/precinct_052.shtml">commanding officer</a> of the 52nd Precinct in the Bronx, said he found all four tires of his department car slashed while parked at his Rockland County home. Then in the middle of the afternoon on Monday, his wife was attacked by the masked men, who punched, kicked and pushed her to the ground, also outside their home. In the course of the investigation into who may have been targeting them, D&apos;Adamo admitted that he&apos;s been carrying on an affair with a female cop, who also is in another relationship. </p>

<p>Adding fuel to the fire, D&apos;Adamo&apos;s wife says someone came up to her and hissed &quot;He took mine, I&apos;ll take his,&quot; on Friday. D&apos;Adamo was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150730152913/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/bronx/love_triangle_may_nypd_behind_vicious_h7mQfjTpDqju0VBbFDy4rL">investigated</a> by Internal Affairs previously, after he was accused last year of fixing tickets for family and friends. Over at police message board Thee Rant, many posters find the whole story too fishy, especially the detail that D&apos;Adamo&apos;s wife was attacked in the middle of the day; one poster <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150730152913/http://theerant.yuku.com/topic/38775/52-PCT-Love-triangle-may---vicious-beating-slashed-tires--NY?page=2">writes</a> about D&apos;Adamo, &quot;he was a rising star in the dept that now seems to have crashed and burned.i hope his wife recovers quickly. IAB is only interested in who slashed the tires on the dept vehicle.RULE #1 DON&apos;T FISH FROM THE COMPANY PIER.&quot;</p>

<p>D&apos;Adamo&apos;s wife is still recuperating in the hospital, and police are still investigating the love triangle claims. The report was juicy enough however that those purveyors of salacious tall tales, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150730152913/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1357584/Love-triangle-attacks-policeman-wife.html">Daily Mail</a>, picked it up, placing it alongside such important stories as Jessica Alba&apos;s pregnancy, Joan Rivers taking nude pics of her daughter, and the woman with the world&apos;s biggest breasts falling into a coma.</p>
