New Yorkers have long been beguiled by the enigma wrapped inside a very thin piece of mystery that we call <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140623232656/http://gothamist.com/tags/thongguy">Thong Guy</a>, whose dedication to wearing the least amount of clothing permissible in NYC is only matched by his wanton disregard for other people&apos;s eyeballs. As is his MO, Thong Guy has not popped up on our radar yet this summer; we know from past experiences that he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140623232656/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/02/summer_is_here_but_where_is_thong_g.php">likes to take his time</a> before emerging from his bare-strapped chrysalis. But there is a little Thong Guy inside of us all&#x2014;and it&apos;s time to let him out.</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="62014thong1.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20140623232656im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/62014thong1.jpeg" width="640" height="459" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>Inspired by Gothamist commenter Jim Lahey and his campaign of thong terror in the comment sections of articles ranging from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140623232656/http://gothamist.com/2014/06/19/incredibly_detailed_miniature_repli.php">&quot;Here&apos;s An Incredibly Detailed Tiny Replica Of A Bushwick Corner&quot;</a> to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140623232656/http://gothamist.com/2014/06/19/crush_the_same_can_that_captain_qui.php">&quot;Crush The Same Can That Quint Did In <em>Jaws</em>,&quot;</a> we&apos;ve created some Thong Guy cut-outs for your photoshopping pleasure. Like with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140623232656/http://gothamist.com/2009/10/24/sad_rat_in_sidewalk_forever.php#photo-1">Sad Rat</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140623232656/http://gothamist.com/2010/10/29/giulianis_photoshopped_official_por.php#photo-1">Giuliani&apos;s official portrait</a>, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140623232656/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/04/its_a_mad_mad_mad_men_world_more_fa.php#photo-1"><em>Mad Men</em></a> ad <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140623232656/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/03/mad_men_ad_mischief_don_draper_does.php#photo-1">mash-up</a>, feel free to go crazy and send us the results (or place them in the comments below).</p>

<p>You can see some examples up above (including two featuring Gothamist Thong Guy historian-at-large John Del Signore), and the templates below. In the meantime, enjoy the sweet sounds of the official Thong Guy song.</p>
