<p>Police say a man who was found bloodied and bruised in Union Square Park last night is brain dead. A 28-year-old Hispanic man, who hasn&apos;t been identified yet, was found just after midnight in the vicinity of Union Square East and East 14th Street. Cops tell us that while officers were doing foot patrols of the park, they found the unresponsive man on a park bench, with injuries to his head and face. </p>

<p>He was taken to Bellevue Hospital in serious condition; his family has been contacted now that he is brain dead, and cops sectioned off the park this afternoon. One person <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140210112952/https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10102374017950799&amp;l=9a2921d345">wrote on Facebook</a>, &quot;Never seen the square actually empty.&quot;</p>

<p>Cops stressed that the medical examiner has yet to determine the cause of death, but there are two scenarios currently being looked at: the man&apos;s injuries may have been caused by an assault, or by a fall. The man&apos;s family indicated to police that he has underlying medical issues which could have caused a fall to happen, but nothing has been determined yet.</p>
