<p>On Sunday, legendary rock and roller <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429153533/http://gothamist.com/tags/loureed">Lou Reed</a> died <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429153533/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/27/lou_reed_is_dead_at_71.php">at the age of 71</a> after succumbing to liver disease. There&apos;s been an outpouring of affection and tributes to Reed across the internet&#x2014;below we&apos;ve compiled some of our favorite pieces, some amusing Reed ephemera, and a 75 minute long documentary.</p>

<ul><li>Different stars and contemporaries <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429153533/http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/5770571/lou-reed-s-death-stars-react-on-twitter?utm_source=twitter">put their condolences online.</a>

</li><li>Reed always gave great interview, including this relatively recent discussion <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429153533/http://pitchfork.com/features/interviews/6690-lou-reed/">of <em>Metal Machine Music</em> with Pitchfork</a> and this <em>New York</em>-era <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429153533/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/lou-reed-the-rolling-stone-interview-19890504">one with Rolling Stone</a>.

<ul><li>Lou Reed had a sense of humor, which is how he ended up <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429153533/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/01/flashback_video_lou_reed_invites_yo.php">shilling for Honda</a> and reading <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429153533/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/24/video_lou_reed.php">weird NSFW porn descriptions.</a>

	</li><li>Phish&apos;s Trey Anastasio <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429153533/http://blog.phish.net/1318486850/trey-on-meeting-lou-reed">on meeting Reed</a>: &quot;As I was walking onstage he said, &#x2018;Show &#x2018;em how to rock and roll. After all, we invented it.&#x2019;&quot;
	</li><li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429153533/http://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9800EEDE113CE731A2575AC0A9649C946791D6CF">Here&apos;s the first hilarious reference</a> to the Velvet Underground in the NY Times: &quot;They bang away at their electronic equipment, while random movies are thrown on the screen in back of them.&quot;
	</li><li>This is Reed&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429153533/https://twitter.com/robertloerzel/status/394533173318537216">high school yearbook photo</a>: &quot;As for the immediate future, Lou has no plans, but will take life as it comes.&quot;
	</li><li>Ann Powers wrote a lovely essay <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429153533/http://www.npr.org/blogs/therecord/2013/10/27/240841092/what-lou-reed-taught-me">about what Reed taught her</a>: &quot;Lou Reed was the first rock star to truly mess up my mind.&quot; Sasha Frere-Jones also wrote a nice personal piece <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429153533/http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/sashafrerejones/2013/10/postscript-lou-reed-obit.html?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter">for The New Yorker</a>: &quot;When I proposed marriage to someone with a song, Lou Reed did the work for me. I handed over a small mirror with a handwritten note, which said only, &apos;I&#x2019;ll be your mirror.&apos;&quot;
	</li><li>Speaking of The New Yorker, Reed wrote a diary for them in 1996 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429153533/http://archives.newyorker.com/?i=1996-08-26#folio=116">which you can read here</a> (skip to page 116).
	</li><li>Have you ever wondered to yourself, &apos;What&apos;s the worst musical thing Lou Reed ever did that isn&apos;t <em>Lulu</em>?&apos; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429153533/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXgbN81zNG8">This collaboration with Pavarotti</a> is it. And <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429153533/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMxyIs8MkmU">the single &quot;The Original Wrapper&quot;</a> isn&apos;t far behind.
	</li><li>A month after he had liver surgery, Reed wrote <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429153533/http://thetalkhouse.com/reviews/view/lou-reed">an enthusiastic piece about Kanye West&apos;s <em>Yeezus</em></a>. And it included this revealing look into himself: &quot;Still, I have never thought of music as a challenge &#x2014; you always figure, the audience is at least as smart as you are.  You do this because you like it, you think what you&apos;re making is beautiful.  And if you think it&apos;s beautiful, maybe they&apos;ll think it&apos;s beautiful.&quot;
	</li><li>There&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429153533/http://www.esquire.com/features/what-ive-learned/lou-reed-learned-0400?click=main_sr">also offered some words of wisdom to Esquire</a> in 2000, including this gem about his process: &quot;I&apos;ve learned not to even wonder about it anymore. Not that I give up; it&apos;s just, I don&apos;t understand it. I realize I don&apos;t understand it, and there you go.&quot;
</li><li>Lou Reed made his debut in The New York Times on January 13th, 1966, following a Velvet Underground performance at the New York Society for Clinical Psychiatry&#x2019;s black-tie dinner at Delmonico&#x2019;s Hotel. One attendee declared: &quot;It was ridiculous, outrageous, painful.&quot; The paper notes that many fled after dessert. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429153533/https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/810311-velvet-underground-horrifies-psychiatrists-1966.html">Read the full thing here</a>.
