<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:200px; "> <img alt="111810hernandez.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811113046im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/111810hernandez.jpg" width="200" height="268"> <br> <i>Felix Hernandez (AP)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>Seattle Mariners pitcher Felix Hernandez <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811113046/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/19/sports/baseball/19cyyoung.html">was announced</a> as the winner of the American League Cy Young award this year, amongst a crowded, impressive field of great pitchers. &quot;King Felix&quot; took 21 of 28 first-place votes, followed in the voting by David Price of the Rays and CC Sabathia of the Yankees. </p>

<p>There was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811113046/http://espn.go.com/blog/new-york/yankees/post/_/id/12090/its-okay-for-cc-not-to-be-the-best">a lot of discussion</a> going into this year&apos;s vote as to which statistics should determine the best pitcher. Hernandez had the lowest run support of any pitcher in the majors this year, and had a record of 13-12, the fewest victories ever by a Cy Young starter in a non-strike season. But he also had a 2.27 earned run average (ERA) while logging 249 2/3 innings and striking out 232. In comparison, Price was 19-6 with a 2.72 ERA, and Sabathia led the league in wins with 21. Do you agree with Cy Young voters that Hernandez was the dominant pitcher this year, or do you think Sabathia and his 21 wins should have won it?</p>
