<p>A woman was fatally struck as she crossed W 96th Street on the Upper West Side early this morning, marking the third such fatal incident in that area this week. According to police, the 26-year-old victim, whose name hasn&apos;t been released yet, was crossing 96th St. mid-block between Broadway and West End Avenue around 4:45 a.m. when she was clipped by the driver&apos;s side mirror of a St. Luke&apos;s ambulance.</p>

<p>The ambulance was traveling westbound on 96th when it struck her. The woman fell facedown onto the eastbound lane of 96th, and was then struck by a Dodge Charger sedan traveling eastbound. She was pronounced dead at the scene. Both drivers remained at the scene of the collision. No charges have been filed, and the investigation is ongoing.</p>

<p>Last weekend, a 9-year-old boy <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140424010925/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/11/9-year-old_fatally_struck_by_taxi_i.php">was fatally struck in front of his father</a> by a cab driver at 97th Street and West End Avenue; the driver was given a summons for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140424010925/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/12/taxi_driver_given_summons_for_fatal.php">failure to yield to pedestrians.</a> In a separate incident, a 73-year-old man was fatally struck a few blocks away at West 96th Street and Broadway as well.</p>

<p>After those two incidents last week, UWS resident and the former Manhattan borough president Scott Stringer released a statement calling for change at the intersection: </p>

<blockquote>Last night&apos;s tragic pedestrian deaths on the Upper West Side send a clear and urgent message: The time for studying the 96th Street traffic corridor is over, and New York City needs to take action now that will prevent such fatalities in the future. I look forward to working with DOT to take all necessary steps to protect road users----pedestrians, cyclists, and motorists alike--and to implement a Vision Zero agenda that makes every street in every borough as safe as it can be. Our City has already had 9 traffic-related deaths in 2014, and my heart goes out to the families of last night&apos;s victims.</blockquote>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: Council member Mark Levine issued the following statement about the recent spate of pedestrian deaths in the neighborhood: </p>

<blockquote>It&apos;s with deep regret that this neighborhood should have to endure its third death today less than weeks apart from each other. My heart goes out to the families of the victims. We cannot lose anymore innocent lives in this community. Immediate action needs to occur to ensure that the West 96th Street corridor is included as part of the Vision Zero plan for increased safety. It cannot be clearer that this is a dangerous intersection that requires safety measures be put in place. In a letter to DOT this week, my colleague and I urged that this corridor be looked at closely. After this third death, that&apos;s no longer sufficient. Immediate action needs to be taken to prevent additional fatalities or injuries.</blockquote>
