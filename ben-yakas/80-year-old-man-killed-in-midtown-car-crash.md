The incident happened around 10:30 p.m. when a black Mazda travelling eastbound on East 59th Street struck a silver Toyota Siena registered to the Pakistani Mission. That Siena spun to the northeast corner of the intersection, striking the two pedestrians standing at the crosswalk.<p></p>

<p>&#x201C;The lady flew and hit the back of another van. I&#x2019;ve never seen anyone fly like that before,&#x201D; witness Terry Hill, who works nearby, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150718232051/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/man_dead_in_un_mission_car_crash_KDSF8p6PEKnfwvjk5D3C1K">told the Post</a>. &#x201C;She jumped right up and saw her husband and said, &#x2018;My husband! My husband! Somebody call my son!&#x2019; Victim Rubin Baum was pinned under the car; he sustained severe trauma and died at New York Cornell Hospital. The woman sustained a leg injury, but was listed in stable condition. Police say the investigation is ongoing, but wouldn&apos;t say whether any criminality is suspected.</p>
