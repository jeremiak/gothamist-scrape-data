</div></div>					<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150314021112/http://gothamist.com/tags/jayz">Jay-Z</a> christened the newly-opened <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150314021112/http://gothamist.com/tags/barclayscenter">Barclays Center</a> in September with a joyous, sold-out eight night residency. Jay-Z <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150314021112/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/08/video_jay-z_takes_the_subway.php">even took the R train</a> from Canal Street to get to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150314021112/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/07/videos_jay-z_brings_out_beyonce_for.php">last show</a>&#x2014;and during his journey he met a lovely older lady who didn&apos;t recognize him one bit and asked the demigod who he was. You can see the adorable interaction in the mini-documentary below (just skip to 18:30).</p>

<p>The woman, who has been identified as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150314021112/http://www.ellengrossman.com/">Ellen Grossman</a>, is an artist (check out <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150314021112/http://recessionartshows.com/2012/10/prolonged-exposure-artist-ellen-grossman/">an interview with her here</a>)&#x2014;she is also the platonic ideal for the person New Yorkers most want to sit next to on the subway. The 24-minute documentary shows a lot of the behind-the-scenes work that went into the eight night residency. Other AMAZING facts we learned about Jay-Z: he uses a regular person&apos;s Metrocard (not some super celebrity &quot;black MetroCard&quot;) he needs several bodyguards to help him get into a subway car, and people like yelling questions at him about Blue Ivy.</p>
