<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170716120421/http://gothamist.com/tags/stephencolbert">Stephen Colbert</a> has been off for the last week, and returned to <em>Late Show</em> last night to catch up on a significant amount of new Trump news. &quot;A revised version [of &apos;Trump&apos;s Muslim travel ban&apos;] is headed to the Supreme Court, and the administration&apos;s only chance of winning is not calling it a &apos;travel ban,&apos;&quot; Colbert explained. &quot;This thing should get approved by the Supreme Court as long as nobody calls it a &apos;travel ban.&apos;&quot; And...</p>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">People, the lawyers and the courts can call it whatever they want, but I am calling it what we need and what it is, a TRAVEL BAN!</p>&#x2014; Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170716120421/https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/871674214356484096">June 5, 2017</a></blockquote>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">That&apos;s right, we need a TRAVEL BAN for certain DANGEROUS countries, not some politically correct term that won&apos;t help us protect our people!</p>&#x2014; Donald J.

<p>&quot;Mr. President, that was the one thing you&#x2019;re not supposed to say!&quot; Colbert said. &quot;That&apos;s like going to an AA meeting and shouting, &apos;Who wants shots?!&apos;&quot; But wait, because there were more tweets...</p>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The Justice Dept. should have stayed with the original Travel Ban, not the watered down, politically correct version they submitted to S.C.</p>&#x2014; Donald J.

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The Justice Dept. should ask for an expedited hearing of the watered down Travel Ban before the Supreme Court - &amp; seek much tougher version!</p>&#x2014; Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170716120421/https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/871677472202477568">June 5, 2017</a></blockquote>

<p>&quot;Mr. President, you can&apos;t criticize the Justice Department&#x2014;you control the Justice Department,&quot; Colbert said. &quot;To quote third-grade boys everywhere: why are you hitting yourself? Quit hitting yourself!&quot;</p>

<p>But of course, Colbert also had some old business from last week to catch up on as well: &quot;I know this happened five days ago, but I will not be denied the chance to enjoy this one,&quot; he said, referring to the infamous &quot;covfefe&quot; tweet. &quot;Of course the Internet lost their covfefe over this. Why did the president type that? It was the new, &apos;what color is the dress,&apos; but instead of &apos;white versus blue,&apos; it was &apos;sleepy versus stroke.&apos;&quot;</p>

<p>He also was able to cover Trump&apos;s withdrawal from the Paris Climate Change Agreement and the latest on the Trump/Russia scandal, as well as Jared Kushner&apos;s secret meetings with Russian bankers: &quot;Just when you thought you knew what was going on, it turns out it was exactly what you thought.&quot;</p>

<p>At the top of the monologue, Colbert got into Trump kicking off &quot;Infrastructure Week&quot; on Monday: &quot;It&apos;s like Shark Week, except American infrastructure might actually kill you.&quot; </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170716120421/http://gothamist.com/tags/sethmeyers">Seth Meyers</a> also returned from vacation with a heck of a lot of news to catch up on, including Trump&apos;s Twitter insults directed at London Mayor Sadik Khan. Khan&#x2019;s spokesperson said he had &quot;more important things to do&quot; than &quot;respond to Donald Trump&#x2019;s ill-informed tweets,&quot; which Meyers could relate to: &quot;It&#x2019;s true: responding to Donald Trump&#x2019;s ill-informed tweets can be a full-time job. And I know, because it&#x2019;s my full-time job.&quot;</p>
