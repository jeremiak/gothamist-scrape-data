</div></div>					<p>Hundreds of people were evacuated from two subway trains after a fire broke out in the subway tunnels under the Lower East Side this afternoon. The FDNY says the fire started around 2:45 p.m., and firefighters are currently on the subway tracks near Essex and Delancey Streets. At the scene, 4th Battalion Chief Keith Anderson tells us it was an electrical fire, saying: &quot;a lot of smoke was coming out of the grates of the subway, we believe it&apos;s likely an electric issue.&quot; He added that between 250-350 people had been evacuated from the two trains, and no injuries had been reported. </p>

<p>Anderson also noted that they believe the fire started somewhere between the Bowery Street station and the Delancey Street station. Currently, there is no J and M train service in both directions between Marcy Avenue and Broad Street. Below, check out some tweets from the scene:</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: Both JMZ entrances at Bowery are currently being vented for smoke; an MTA rep on the scene wasn&apos;t able to say when they&apos;d be re-opened. </p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: An MTA spokesman told us: &quot;The J train was brought back to Essex Street and the M was already one car into Essex Street and people walked through the train cars and exited to the platform.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: Deputy Assistant Chief Jim Daly said that the fire started in a &quot;wall mounted electrical vault box&quot; that supplies power to the third rails. He added that approximately 500 people were evacuated altogether. The fire was extinguished with chemicals. As for what caused the fire, he noted: &quot;That&apos;s for the MTA to say.&quot;</p>
