<p>Yesterday, we were all highly amused by the story of a 19-year-old who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504140942/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/16/teen_scams_upper_east_side_surgeon.php">was able to scam an Upper East Side plastic surgeon out of a $7,500 boob job</a> by taking advantage of the byzantine credit card fraud system. But today, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504140942/http://nypost.com/2013/11/17/teen-who-stole-boob-job-may-have-been-an-escort/">the Post offers</a> a shocking TWIST in the case: the teen might be an escort! Or she might just be someone who knows how to give out fake telephone numbers.</p>

<p>The Post uncovered the phone number which the young woman gave to Dr. Joshua B. Hyman of Body Cosmetica on East 85th Street. The number appears in a slew of online erotic ads on sites such as Escort Phone List: &#x201C;Stop Wasting Your Time With Fake &amp; Phony Girls,&#x201D; a woman posted on that site in January. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m All You Need Baby.&#x201D; And where there&apos;s libidinous smoke, there&apos;s lucrative fire. </p>

<p>The Post implies that this means the teen was a hooker&#x2014;but considering the fact she gave fake information to the surgeon in every other area, it&apos;s just as possible that she found a random number to give them. But sure, maybe her one fatal mistake will be that she gave them her &quot;real&quot; number, and the police will now set up a sting, and the doctor will reveal that it was an all advertising ploy for his new youth-targeted plastic surgery clinic, and did someone say <em>Nip/Tuck</em> reunion?!</p>

<p>Police say that the buxom swindler is 5-foot-2, 105 pounds with brown eyes and long black hair, so that certainly narrows things down.</p>
