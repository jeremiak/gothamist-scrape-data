<p>In these <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161119023457/http://www.theonion.com/article/america-not-sure-it-will-have-enough-revulsion-and-54676">dark days</a> before the coronation of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161119023457/https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2016/11/14/the-trump-administration-hasnt-even-started-yet-and-its-already-a-fiasco/">a poorly-tanned man-baby</a> who has appointed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161119023457/http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/11/donald_trump_s_pick_of_stephen_bannon_means_white_nationalism_is_coming.html">white supremacists</a> to his inner circle, we are all in desperate need of some brief relief from all the rage and grief. Enter Billy Eichner and SAG Award winner Jon Hamm, running around Manhattan yelling at people who won&apos;t have a threesome with them.</p>

<p>Everything is pretty good in this politics-free zone: the casual bickering between Eichner and Hamm, the copious amounts of deadpan <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161119023457/https://twitter.com/JoshKurp/status/798198094198358016">HammFace</a> to the camera, and most surprisingly, the amount of people who don&apos;t jump at the chance to have sex with the two of them. If you get the opportunity to make love to Hamm and Eichner, your children will be proud of you!  </p>
