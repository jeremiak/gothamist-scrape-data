<p>We are now approximately a month away from getting a bounty of new episodes of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130529005152/http://gothamist.com/tags/arresteddevelopment"><em>Arrested Development</em></a>&#x2014;which means we&apos;re a month away from the most epic 7 1/2 hour television binge since that time we watched season 4 of <em>The Wire</em> while <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130529005152/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N_UuImPL4E">clutching a nail gun</a>. We&apos;ve kept a healthy skepticism about the whole endeavor, lest it fell apart at the last minute and we were forced to go back to making ultimate <em>AD</em> quote compilations. But today, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130529005152/http://insidetv.ew.com/2013/04/25/arrested-development-buster-lucille/">Entertainment Weekly brings us the first actual real new footage</a> from the upcoming season&#x2014;a really funny one! Not that there&apos;s anything wrong with those quote compilations, of course.</p>

<p>Only a snippet of the scene, which was previously screened during panels at the Television Critics Association Winter Press Tour and SXSW, will appear in the upcoming season, but it&apos;s pretty sweet hearing that old narration again. Tony Hale, who plays cigarette-absorbing Buster Bluth, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130529005152/http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/tv/showtracker/la-et-st-veep-tony-hale-20130419,0,2136220.story?page=2">talked with the LA Times</a> about coming into this new season: </p>

<blockquote>It really was the fans and press that kept it alive. We would hear all these rumors and I tried not to get too excited about it. I think it definitely hit me the first day I was working, which was a day when everyone was there. It was a scene in the penthouse and we were all dressed in our wardrobe &#x2014; that&#x2019;s when it clicked. Because we hadn&#x2019;t shot an episode for seven years so it was very surreal and exciting and everyone was just kind of wondering what they were going to give us because that is what was so exciting about it, is you never knew what was coming. It was always a surprise.  Even when I started, everything was still developing. It was a fun day.</blockquote>
