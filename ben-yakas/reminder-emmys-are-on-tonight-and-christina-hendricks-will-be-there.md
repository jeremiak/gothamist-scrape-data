<p>The 63rd Primetime Emmys are on tonight (8 p.m. on Fox), and while the show is usually a snooze-fest&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428150050/http://gothamist.com/2005/09/18/emmys_coverage_2005_worst_night_ever.php">2005 Emmys</a>, we still haven&apos;t forgotten, or forgiven, you&#x2014;there really are some things to look forward to tonight. The effervescent Jane Lynch of <em>Glee</em> is hosting, a somewhat-humbled Charlie Sheen <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428150050/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/charlie-sheen-expected-present-at-236747">is rumored to be presenting</a>, Gwyneth Paltrow might get <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428150050/http://www.examiner.com/pop-media-in-chicago/is-it-time-for-gwyneth-paltrow-to-join-the-egot-club-after-glee-performance">one step closer to an EGOT</a>, and some really really good shows (<em>Friday Night Lights</em>, <em>Game Of Thrones</em>, <em>Parks And Recreation</em>) are getting recognition in the major categories. </p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428150050/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2011/09/18/ap/entertainment/main20107879.shtml">big fight of the night</a> will be between HBO&apos;s gangster period drama <em>Boardwalk Empire</em> and perennial Emmy prom king <em>Mad Men</em>. The gorgeously-curvaceous <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428150050/http://gothamist.com/tags/christinahendricks">Christine Hendricks</a>, who is nominated for best supporting actress for <em>Mad Men</em> the second time, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428150050/http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/16/emmys-watch-christina-hendricks-on-mad-men/">will be in the house</a> with date David, &quot;a 16-year-old young man from Texas, who was in the Make a Wish Foundation. His wish was to attend the Emmys, so I get to help grant it this Sunday.&quot; </p>

<p>In case all of that still hasn&apos;t piqued your interest, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428150050/http://insidetv.ew.com/2011/09/17/the-lonely-island-to-perform-at-the-emmys-exclusive/">Lonely Island will be performing</a> a medley of their SNL hits as well, with some surprise guest stars (EW says that Ed Helms, Maya Rudolph and John Stamos will be among them). They group were nominated for three Original Song Emmys this year&#x2014;&#x201C;Jack Sparrow,&#x201D; &#x201C;I Just Had Sex,&#x201D; and &#x201C;3-Way (The Golden Rule)&#x201D;&#x2014;but lost to Justin Timberlake&#x2019;s musical SNL monologue&#x2014;the award was already handed out at last week&#x2019;s Creative Arts Emmys. </p>
