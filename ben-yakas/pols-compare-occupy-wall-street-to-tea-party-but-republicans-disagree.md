<p>While the likes of Cornel West, Talib Kweli, Michael Moore, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150208050801/http://twitpic.com/6vky48">Mark Ruffalo</a> have all come down to Zuccotti Park in support of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150208050801/http://gothamist.com/tags/occupywallstreet">Occupy Wall Street</a>, most politicians have been tip-toeing around the mass protest, still trying to figure out what to make of it three weeks after it began. Vice President Joe Biden <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150208050801/http://www.cnn.com/2011/10/07/politics/occupy-wall-street/index.html?hpt=hp_t2">called it</a> a grassroots political movement yesterday&#x2014;but added that &quot;there&apos;s a lot in common with the Tea Party.&quot; And billionaire businessman Mayor Bloomberg agrees.</p>

<p>Bloomberg made the same connection between OWS and the Tea Party <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150208050801/http://208.7.160.123/blogs/dailypolitics/2011/10/bloomberg-on-occupying-wall-street-safely">yesterday while speaking to reporters</a>. And one thing he pointed out in particular is that both groups are filled with disparate interests and goals: &quot;Yeah, if you listen they don&#x2019;t seem [to] coalesce about one issue.&quot; When asked whether he thought the protests were getting out of hand, Bloomberg got in a crack about the leaderless movement: &quot;I don&#x2019;t know that there is a way to resolve this. There&#x2019;s no leadership. One group that&#x2019;s leading, whatever.&quot; </p>

<p>Of course, Bloomberg is also under the impression that OWS <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150208050801/http://twitter.com/#!/azipaybarah/status/122295288273715200">is bad for tourism</a>, despite the fact that tourists <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150208050801/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/03/occupy_wall_street_turning_zuccotti.php">have been flocking to Zuccotti Park</a>, either to join in or to gawk at protesters. Bloomberg might also be frustrated that he can&apos;t personally evict protesters from Zuccotti Park&#x2014;only the landlords can make that move to bring in police. However, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150208050801/http://blog.littlesis.org/2011/10/05/the-public-private-partnership-behind-zuccotti-park/">it&apos;s worth noting that</a> Bloomberg&apos;s longtime live-in girlfriend, Diana Taylor, sits on the board of the company that owns the park, Brookfield Properties.</p>

<p>The OWS/Tea Party connection in the media has been growing so much, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150208050801/http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/romenesko/148813/msnbc-current-tv-compete-to-cover-occupy-wall-street-protests/">Poynter has begun to wonder whether MSNBC</a> has started to give OWS airtime akin to the way Fox News supported the early tea party rallies, &quot;giving credibility to those who argue that the movement could be the left&#x2019;s tea party.&quot; Jon Stewart noted this same phenomenon earlier this week, in a segment in which he compared the 2011 protests with the 2009 birth of the Tea Party, and the media&apos;s incredibly different reactions: &quot;So, rage against duly elected government is patriotic&#x2014;quintessentially American&#x2014;whereas rage against multi-national shareholder-accountable corporations is anti-American. OK, gotcha,&quot; Stewart said</p>

<p>But House of Representatives Majority Leader Eric Cantor, who has long been sympathetic to the Tea Party movement, doesn&apos;t see the similarities at all:  <strong>&quot;I for one am increasingly concerned about the growing mobs occupying Wall Street and the other cities across the country,</strong>&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150208050801/http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/10/07/us-usa-wallstreet-protests-republicans-idUSTRE7963N020111007">he said in a speech to</a> social conservatives yesterday. While those &quot;growing mobs&quot; have kept Cantor awake at night, the growing mobs of the Tea Party only elicitied &quot;oohs&quot; and &quot;aahs&quot; from him. When asked why he didn&apos;t join up with the group, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150208050801/http://hotair.com/archives/2010/07/20/eric-cantor-the-tea-partys-better-off-as-a-grassroots-movement-not-a-house-caucus/">he waxed rhapsodic</a>: &#x201C;<strong>That&#x2019;s part of the beauty of the tea party movement; it&#x2019;s organic. </strong>And it&#x2019;s certainly not Washington. So I think it&#x2019;s better left with the people.&#x201D;</p>

<p>And another person who sees no connection between the Tea Party and the OWS movement? Bill O&apos;Reilly. That&apos;s because <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150208050801/http://gawker.com/5847572/">he only sees a bunch of anti-American hippies</a> hellbent on destroying this great nation, as he put it in a near temper-tantrum yesterday: &#x201C;These are the people who burn down the stores...I dont think they&#x2019;re looking out for anyone but themselves. I think they want to tear this country down, <strong>they hate this country, and that goes against everything I believe</strong>.&#x201D;</p>
