<p>An 81-year-old Bronx grandfather <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120125111339/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2011/10/01/attack-robbery-of-81-year-old-bronx-man-caught-on-video/?utm_source=home&amp;utm_medium=dl&amp;utm_campaign=attack-caught-on-video">was attacked and beaten</a> by a thief, and the whole altercation was caught on video. Octogenarian Jose Rodriguez <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120125111339/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2011/10/01/2011-10-01_bronx_grandfather_jose_rodriguez_recounts_mugging_he_just_kept_hitting_me.html">described the attack to the News,</a> recounting that he was jumped by the assailant and put in a chokehold in the lobby of his Parkchester apartment building Thursday afternoon: &quot;I was going to give him what he wanted.<strong> I wasn&apos;t going to put up a fight, but he punched me in my face.</strong> I don&apos;t know why he did that.&quot; Watch below:</p>

<div style="text-align: center;"><script type="text/javascript" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120125111339js_/http://video.newyork.cbslocal.com/global/video/videoplayer.js?rnd=317396;hostDomain=video.newyork.cbslocal.com;playerWidth=425;playerHeight=332;isShowIcon=true;clipId=6309053;flvUri=;partnerclipid=;adTag=News;advertisingZone=CBS.NY%252Fworldnowplayer;enableAds=true;landingPage=;islandingPageoverride=false;playerType=STANDARD_EMBEDDEDscript;controlsType=fixed"></script></div>

<p>Rodriguez said he tried to protect himself: &quot;I covered my face. He just kept hitting me and hitting me.&quot; The thief took Rodriguez&apos;s gold cross necklace and wallet, which only had $30 and credit cards. Rodriguez, a retired boiler room worker who has lived in the building for 35 years, was hospitalized with minor injuries that evening and left with a black right eye. Police describe the thief as between 17 and 20 years old. He was wearing a dark blue t-shirt and black sneakers and carrying a backpack during the attack.</p>

<p>Now Rodriguez, who has three grown children and two grandkids, is scared of his own neighborhood: &quot;Everything has changed. I used to go get my hair cut at two or three in the morning, and I&apos;d never have a problem. Now it&apos;s different. <strong>These young kids don&apos;t respect the old people like they used to.&quot;</strong></p>
