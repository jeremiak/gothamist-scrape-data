<p>Over the past five days, there have been a shocking <em>seven</em> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504134409/http://gothamist.com/tags/subway">subway-related incidents</a> that have led to at least four fatalities and one person having their legs severed. We&apos;ve now learned that one of the other victims is not doing well either: the man <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504134409/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/22/reports_woman_struck_by_1_train_on.php">who was struck by a 1 train at W. 86th Street</a> on Friday morning is in critical condition at the Intensive Care Unit at St. Luke&apos;s Hospital, according to a hospital spokeswoman. We&apos;ve also learned from witnesses that he had <em>accidentally</em> fallen onto the tracks: &quot;My 18-year-old daughter witnessed this while on her way to a class,&quot; Elaine DePrince told us. &quot;She said that the victim had been looking for the train. Then he backed up and suddenly tripped forward and fell onto the tracks.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He appeared to be carrying two shopping bags, and she said that she thought he had lost his balance because of them,&quot; DePrince continued. A worker at the station <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504134409/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/man_struck_by_train_on_upper_west_7SiGLbrVJ8nkj4geuDCETN">told the Post</a> a similar thing: &#x201C;That person slipped and fell,&#x201D; said Debesh Barua, a newsstand owner. &#x201C;While they did their investigation, the train wasn&#x2019;t operating for an hour and a half.&#x201D; </p>

<p>We spoke to four other witnesses who were either on the train or the platform around 10:30 a.m. Friday when the incident happened. Initially, witnesses, MTA and FDNY all identified the person trapped under the train as a woman. DePrince added that her daughter believed the victim to be a woman as well. </p>

<p>MTA workers didn&apos;t see the victim at first: &quot;The MTA worker looked below the stopped train for a person. He didn&apos;t see anything,&quot; witness Dan Caster told us. &quot;Where I moved away, I heard moans and screams. I told the MTA worker I heard something. It was so horrific and people were gathering, I left after that.&quot; He added that he thought it sounded like &quot;a middle aged woman&apos;s cries.&quot; Witness Orlando Olier, who was on the train at the time, told us he heard &quot;bloodcurdling screams.&quot;</p>

<p>Witness Rebecca Perry said she was hurrying to catch the train when she saw the chaos on the platform. &quot;I made it to the platform, and right away, I heard tons of screaming (I think mostly from people who witnessed it, maybe from her too),&quot; she told us. &quot;I turned around, and literally swarms of policemen/firemen were right behind me, running over to the tracks...I saw one girl crying, and asked her what was going on. &apos;Someone was JUST hit by a train.&apos; Apparently I was arriving only a minute or two after it happened, and someone had called 911 right away.&quot;</p>

<p>According to DePrince, some of the initial cries people heard at the station were from children: &quot;A group of very small children dressed in costumes for Purim also witnessed the accident, and they were very upset by the screaming and began to scream too.&quot;</p>

<p>On Wednesday, a man <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504134409/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/20/breaking_person_reportedly_struck_a.php">was fatally struck</a> by an F train at the Roosevelt Avenue / 74th Street station in Jackson Heights; another man <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504134409/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/20/breaking_another_person_struck_by_a.php">was injured</a> after falling onto the tracks at Columbus Circle that day.
