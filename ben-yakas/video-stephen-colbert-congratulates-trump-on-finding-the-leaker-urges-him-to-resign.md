<p>&quot;Well, ladies and gentlemen, I&#x2019;ve got good news, and I got bad news,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170716194236/http://gothamist.com/tags/stephencolbert">Stephen Colbert</a> said at the top of the Late Show yesterday. &quot;The bad news: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170716194236/https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/trump-revealed-highly-classified-information-to-russian-foreign-minister-and-ambassador/2017/05/15/530c172a-3960-11e7-9e48-c4f199710b69_story.html?hpid=hp_hp-banner-main_trumpintel-0504pm%3Ahomepage%2Fstory&amp;utm_term=.96c8ec3acd39">The Washington Post is reporting</a> that Donald Trump revealed highly classified information to the Russian foreign minister and ambassador. The good news: Trump found the leaker.&quot;</p>

<p>Trump <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170716194236/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/15/us/politics/trump-russia-classified-information-isis.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=first-column-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news">reportedly divulged</a> classified intelligence about an Islamic State terrorist threat with the Russian foreign minister and ambassador, but the info is so sensitive the &quot;code-word information&quot; couldn&apos;t be shared in detail, so, as Colbert quipped, &quot;vital aspects of the story had to be replaced with other words. You have to say things like, &apos;The package has been delivered,&apos; &apos;The squirrel is in the basket,&apos; or &apos;The idiot is in the Oval.&apos;&quot;</p>

<p>Colbert also had something to say regarding Trump&apos;s threats to get rid of press briefings: &quot;I have something to say here,&quot; he said. &quot;Donald Trump, if you&#x2019;re watching: first of all, you&#x2019;re a bad president, please resign. Second: please, please, please don&#x2019;t take Sean Spicer from us. Where am I going to get my daily dose of veiled anger and condescension?&quot;</p>

<p>Trevor Noah at the Daily Show was equally perturbed by Trump sharing info with the Russians and all of its implications: &quot;So the good news is, Trump listens during intel briefings. And the bad news is, Trump listens during intel briefings.&quot;</p>

<p>On the plus side, &quot;at least now we know there&apos;s no aliens. Because if there were, Donald Trump would have told us by now.&quot;</p>

<p>And Seth Meyers summarized the state of things as such: &quot;We&#x2019;re at a point now in the Trump presidency that feels very much like a pivotal moment for our democracy,&quot; he said. &quot;An increasingly authoritarian president relying on a small circle of loyalists abusing his power, and on top of that, just before we started taping, The Washington Post reported that Trump revealed classified information to Russian diplomats.&quot;</p>
