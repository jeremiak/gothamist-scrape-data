Every year, the world&apos;s most passionate owners of ugly dogs gather to shame their ugly beloved pets in an attempt to make the world a more accepting place for ugly animals, or something. The whole concept is kind of weird, but everyone goes along with it because dogs blissfully don&apos;t have the capacity to understand concepts like ugly, and also even ugly dogs are pretty adorable. Well yesterday, the winner of the 25th annual World&apos;s Ugliest Dog Contest <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130729120623/http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2013/06/22/walle-worlds-ugliest-dog/2448241/">was crowned</a>, but there was one glaring problem&#x2014;the winning dog isn&apos;t ugly at all.</p>

<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130729120623if_/http://www.youtube.com/embed/eZSIzY6LYXg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>As any human with eyes can see from the photos above, Walle&#x2014;the 4-year-old mutt from Chico, Calif. who won the contest&#x2014;is not ugly. Yes, he is a little odd looking: he&apos;s a mix of beagle, boxer and basset hound, he has a slightly oversized head, and he waddles like a duck. But just look at some of the competitors he was up against: Walle may be a bit awkward, but can you really say that duck-like feet can compare to Penny&apos;s freakishly long tongue, to Rascal&apos;s ratty hair, to Isaboo&apos;s mohawk-from-hell?</p>

<p><iframe width="640" height="480" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130729120623if_/http://www.youtube.com/embed/bbgPJ7O8Jiw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p><strong>&quot;This dog looked like he&apos;s been photo-shopped with pieces from various dogs and maybe a few other animals,</strong>&quot; judge Brian Sobel said in explaining Walle&apos;s victory. &quot;People come up to me and say that dog is not right,&quot; Owner Tammie Barbee said, &quot;but I love him.&quot; Maybe Walle has a bit of a Picasso thing going on, but that does not make him the world&apos;s ugliest dog&#x2014;remember <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130729120623/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/23/meet_mugly_the_worlds_new_official.php">last year&apos;s winner Muggly</a>, an 8-year-old Chinese crested dog? Now THAT was an ugly dog. </p>

<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130729120623if_/http://www.youtube.com/embed/YD_mEeUxfrU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>There are only two possibilities for this year&apos;s unfathomable results: the fix was in for Walle, or the judges have lost sight of what makes for a truly ugly dog. Standards have clearly slipped precipitously in the prestigious World&apos;s Ugliest Dog Contest. But maybe it&apos;s because the judges have seen too much&#x2014;maybe they&apos;re jaded. You only come across <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130729120623/http://cheezburger.com/5980034048">so many Yodas in this lifetime.</a></p>

<p>Having said that, they&apos;re all very good doggys, and they all deserve giant treats when they get home.</p>
