Well, one reason might be that they&apos;re too busy: one group of unicyclists has been occupied trying to cross the least-cycle friendly places in NYC, its 2,078 bridges.</p>

<p>The group started a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170405195430/http://unicyclenycbridgetour.blogspot.com/">blog</a> last October to chart their progress crossing each bridge on unicycle. They started with the Williamsburg Bridge, and have crossed 50 so far. We can already here the ka-ching of the cash registers on their book deal. &quot;A lot of people don&apos;t like bicyclists and bicycle politics, but everyone loves a unicycle...We even went down Bedford Avenue in Williamsburg where the Hasidic community rallied to have bike lanes removed, and they loved us there,&quot; group leader Rob Hickman told the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170405195430/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/one_wheel_bridges_5Ik0fHIDktfALXBiv8Q6nI">Post</a>. But despite all their hard pedaling, it&apos;s never enough: &quot;The No. 1 question we get is, <strong>&apos;Do you also juggle?&apos;&quot;</strong><br>
