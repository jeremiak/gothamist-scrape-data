What do they all have in common? Clowns. <em>Creepy clowns</em> who roam the streets in the dead of night, holding bouquets of balloons. And creepy clowns are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108031842/http://www.livescience.com/56274-suspicious-clown-sightings-increasing.html">not a laughing matter,</a> especially when there is a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108031842/http://www.wcpo.com/news/state/state-kentucky/creepy-clowns-threaten-kentucky-schools">&quot;vague threat of violence&quot;</a> attached to their comically-sized shoes.</p>

<p>Now mind you, some of these &quot;threats&quot; have already proved to be nothing more than <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108031842/http://www.tennessean.com/story/news/local/sumner/2016/09/27/4-cited-clown-prank-portland/91185074/">incredibly irritating pranks.</a> But for whatever reason, copycat clowns (or perhaps the same roving gang of immortal Bozos) keep <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108031842/http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2016/09/28/what-we-know-creepy-clown-reports-across-nation/91171858/">popping up in more and more states</a>, including Ohio, Virginia, Maryland and Pennsylvania. Even if it&apos;s all bad pranks and even worse marketing schemes, they are literally being blamed for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108031842/http://theweek.com/articles/647993/why-are-creepy-clowns-terrorizing-america">&quot;terrorizing America.&quot; </a></p>

<p>And this week, terror appeared at our doorstep: there have been four reported creepy clown sightings in Phillipsburg, New Jersey in the last few days. Even if they are just pranksters, the descriptions of the sightings, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108031842/http://www.nj.com/warren/index.ssf/2016/09/more_suspicious_clowns_reported_what_to_do_if_you.html">via NJ.com</a>, still sound like they&apos;d make me pee my pants:</p>

<blockquote>The first was about 8 p.m. Sunday in Walters Park, when three clowns allegedly came out of the woods and chased a child.

<p>Three more were reported Monday in the Warren County community, Stettner said.</p>

<p>At about 5 p.m., someone was seen dressed as a clown on Hudson Street. At 7:45 p.m., a jester holding some kind of sword reportedly ran after a child on Shafer Avenue. And at about 9:30, a dark-colored truck was seen driving down Mercer Street with multiple clowns hanging out the window, according to police.</p>

<p>Also on Monday, a group of children near a Wilson Borough elementary school in Northampton County (Pa.) told police three people dressed as clowns chased them about 3:15 p.m., according to a news release. The clowns reportedly got into a white vehicle and drove south on Front Street. School staff, who were outside for about 30 minutes, didn&apos;t see the clowns, borough police Chief Steven Parkansky said.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>Loitering in the woods? Chasing children? Brandishing &quot;some kind of sword&quot;? Hanging out of windows!? EVEN CARS AREN&apos;T SAFE.</p>

<p>&quot;We don&apos;t need a society living in fear,&quot; Phillipsburg police Capt. Robert Stettner said yesterday. &quot;There&apos;s always a concern that people are copycatting for the sake of scaring people.&quot; But do we really want to live in a society that is <em>not</em> terrified of creepy clowns loitering in the woods with swords? Shouldn&apos;t we teach our children to resist the undeniable allure of clown college?</p>

<p>While Stettner discouraged the idea of &quot;hunting&quot; clowns, he did warn children, &quot;You see somebody in a clown mask, don&apos;t go talk to them,&quot; which is the kind of sound life advice everyone should abide by.</p>

<p>Of course, NYC has already had its fair shake of creepy clown sightings in recent years, between the clown <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108031842/http://gothamist.com/2014/07/14/greenwood_cemetery_clown.php">hanging around Green-Wood Cemetery</a> and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108031842/http://gothamist.com/2014/03/25/staten_island_clown_probably_just_m.php">Staten Island clown</a>, who turned out to be terrible viral advertising for some movie we can&apos;t even bother looking up.</p>

<p>Anyway, there&apos;s no need to panic or keep yourself awake at night ordering cases of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108031842/https://www.powtoon.com/embed/dMREj9EpTV3/">clown repellent</a>. And it&apos;s important to keep in mind that not all creepy clowns are actually creepy (or clowns)&#x2014;sometimes they&apos;re just very sweet kids.</p>
