<p>As we understand it, cognitive dissonance is the discomfort experienced when listening to a massively famous professional re-inventor with a fake British accent cover a sensitive singer-songwriter while de-contextualizing the music entirely. We admit it&apos;s a rare scenario, but our disequilibrium was on full tilt last night when <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502152024/http://gothamist.com/tags/madonna">Madonna</a> performed Elliott Smith&apos;s &quot;Between The Bars&quot; at MoMA at the launch party for her new short film, <em>secretprojectrevolution.</em> And she somehow turned a song about alcohol and heartache into a performance art piece about the prison industrial complex. And appropriately, Lindsay Lohan was there!</p>

<p>And ex-husband Sean Penn, Anderson Cooper, and Perez Hilton were all there too.</p>

<p>For what it&apos;s worth, Madonna doesn&apos;t sound <em>bad</em> on the song&#x2014;but it&apos;s still just off. Completely and utterly off.  Below is the full speech Madonna made last night <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502152024/http://www.boyculture.com/boy_culture/2013/09/madonna-secretprojectrevolution-party-sean-penn.html">about the Art For Freedom campaign</a>. &quot;When I say I wanna start a revolution, that is exactly what I mean,&quot; she said. &quot;I mean I want to start a movement of people, of artists, who are not worried about winning popularity contests, who are not worried about approval, who are not worried about whether their ass looks good&#x2014;although it is important to have a good-looking ass...&quot;</p>

<p>The 17-minute <em>secretprojectrevolution</em> film is a collaboration with director Steven Klein, which  &#x201C;questions our governments and our collective thought patterns.&quot; You can watch the whole thing below. </p>
