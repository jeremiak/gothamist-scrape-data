<p>Whether or not he&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501174758/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/30/video_remember_that_time_woody_alle.php">boxing a kangaroo,</a> vintage <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501174758/http://gothamist.com/tags/woodyallen">Woody Allen</a> footage is always pretty entertaining. But this unaired interview with Granada Television from 1971&#x2014;in support of early classic <em>Bananas</em>&#x2014;is especially noteworthy. Watch the below as Allen gives deadpan answer after deadpan answer, and completely avoids answering anything remotely truthfully. </p>

<p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s a drama about human emotion in the United States,&#x201D; Allen explains about <em>Bananas</em>. &#x201C;It deals with the tragedy of divorce as it relates to the children and those who have to suffer continually from the effects of an unhappy home... I try and keep as much comedy out of my films as possible.&#x201D; </p>

<p>Allen doesn&apos;t break throughout the whole thing, which must have been pretty terrible for the interviewer (although he may have been in on it). Despite all the dodging, there are some seeds of truth throughout: Allen notes he doesn&apos;t watch his own films (which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501174758/http://www.hindustantimes.com/Entertainment/Hollywood/Woody-Allen-dislikes-own-films-but-won-t-retire/Article1-878769.aspx">he really doesn&apos;t</a>) because &quot;I don&#x2019;t have the patience to sit through them.&#x201D; He also reveals what it&apos;s like meeting fans in person: &quot;It&apos;s kind of frightening.&quot;</p>
