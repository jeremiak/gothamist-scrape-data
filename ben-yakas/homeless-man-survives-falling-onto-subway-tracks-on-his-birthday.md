<p>On Friday, a 26-year-old man <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130519162512/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/12/multiple_subway_incidents_snarl_2_3.php">was seriously injured</a> after he fell onto the F train tracks at the Lower East Side-2 Avenue station near East Houston after 10 a.m. It turns out that homeless man Alexander Flefleh lucked out on his birthday, no less&#x2014;the train rolled over him without hitting him, and he survived his injuries despite suffering head trauma. </p>

<p>His mother, Aphrodite Flefleh, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130519162512/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/birthday_hobo_run_over_by_subway_eKHatFcaudI8QzE9Kfio4K?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Manhattan">told the Post that</a> her son suffers from seizures, as well as emotional and drug problems. No alcohol was in his system at the time of the incident, so she believes his accidental fall was the result of a seizure. &#x201C;Hopefully, this will be enough to put him on a different track,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;I hope that he understands that he&#x2019;s more valuable than he thinks he is.&quot;</p>

<p>&#x201C;He didn&#x2019;t ruin his life, which is incredible,&quot; she added. &quot;I&#x2019;m hoping if he comes to terms with it, maybe we will get lucky and it will hit him. This is a young man who needs help and needs a second chance.&#x201D; Last month, a teenager celebrating his 18th birthday <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130519162512/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/27/birthday_teen_killed_by_2_train_was.php#photo-1">was killed by an uptown 2 train</a> at the West 79th Street station while crossing the tracks (possibly on a dare). </p>

<p>Unfortunately, the other man who was involved in a subway incident on Friday was not so lucky. Police think that man, believed to be in his 30s, jumped onto the the northbound 2 train tracks at Times Square just before 7 a.m. purposefully. He was electrocuted by the third rail, and died instantly.</p>

<p>An eyewitness <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130519162512/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/12/man_electrocuted_after_falling_onto.php">described the scene to us yesterday</a>, and another gave us some more details today. &quot;When I peered over the edge of the 2/3 northbound track I saw a man being electrocuted on the 3rd rail,&quot; Olivia O&apos;Brien told us. &quot;He was vocalizing and twitching. Wearing a blue T-shirt and had reddish hair.&quot; </p>

<p>She yelled for help, but later reckoned it was already too late: &quot;Afterward, I realized that there was no way this person could be helped. By the time I followed the MTA men back down to the tracks (within about 8 seconds), I heard one of them say &apos;he&apos;s toast.&apos;  It smelled like something had been burnt.&quot; She believes it was a suicide attempt as well. </p>
