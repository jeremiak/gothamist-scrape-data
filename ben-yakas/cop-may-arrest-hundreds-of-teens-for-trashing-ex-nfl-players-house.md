<p>This week, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503000933/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/27/six_arrested_for_trashing_ex-nfl_pl.php">six teens and young adults were arrested</a> for their part in the massive Labor Day weekend bash that took place at former pro football player <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503000933/http://gothamist.com/tags/brianholloway">Brian Holloway&apos;s</a> upstate NY home. A seventh teen has now also surrendered to authorities for his part in the festivities that caused thousands of dollars of damage to Holloway&apos;s Stephentown home. And authorities say <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503000933/http://www.tmz.com/2013/09/27/6-brian-holloway-arrests-party-house-albany-new-england-patriots/">this is just the tip of the iceberg</a>&#x2014;hundreds of teens could be charged for the party: &quot;We currently have over 200 names ...Once we&apos;ve established proof of their presence at the party, they will be asked to turn themselves in.&quot;</p>

<p>The latest teen arrested is James Curran, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503000933/http://wnyt.com/article/stories/s3174276.shtml">who has been charged</a> with criminal trespassing. The other six arrested so far, who range in age from 17 to 21, are facing a variety of charges including second-degree criminal trespass and felony fourth-degree grand larceny. </p>

<p>Police say the ringleader of the party was 19-year-old Seth Hawk, whom Holloway had taken into his family when he was 15. Holloway said Hawk was a classmate of his son and had a troubled youth; learning about his involvement &#x201C;was a shocker.&#x201D; &#x201C;We&#x2019;re still pulling for him,&#x201D; Holloway said. &#x201C;This may be the thing to get him on track.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Hawk faces felony charges of burglary and criminal mischief and misdemeanor charges of endangering the welfare of a child and unlawfully dealing with a child. He&#x2019;s also accused of advertising the party and supplying the alcohol.</p>

<p>Holloway, who lives primarily in Tampa now, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503000933/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/20/parents_of_teens_who_trashed_ex-nfl.php">told us last week that</a> he estimates there is $20-40K in damage to the house, including smashed windows and glass doors, an &quot;enormous amount&quot; of graffiti, urine-soaked carpets, holes in the ceilings, and a stolen eagle statue (which has since been returned). He also said that many parents of the teens who vandalized the home have threatened him with lawsuits for re-posting their Tweets and Instagrams of the party. &quot;Every time a car pulls up the driveway, I wonder if I&apos;m getting papers,&quot; he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503000933/http://wnyt.com/article/stories/s3174276.shtml">told WNYT.</a></p>

<p>&#x201C;Everyone that broke the law, I&#x2019;m pressing charges against,&#x201D; Holloway added. &#x201C;The parents had a chance and students had a chance to come forward, and only four did.&#x201D;</p>
