<p>You may recall that last week <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150921021629/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/06/photo_stranger_asleep_on_orthodox_m.php">a photo of a black man sleeping against an orthodox Jewish man&apos;s shoulder on the subway went wildly viral</a> and renewed some people&apos;s faith in humanity or whatever.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150921021629/http://www.charidy.com/">Charidy</a> was inspired by that photo, and decided to try out their own version of it and see how many people would let a random person sleep on them on the subway. Let&apos;s just hope this doesn&apos;t become a trend, because c&apos;mon.</p>

<p>But that&apos;s not all! George Ferrandi, a Brooklyn-based installation and performance artist, also went around the subway trying to rest her head on the shoulder of strangers. &quot;Many New Yorkers offered me the same gentle comfort that he afforded the sleeping man next to him,&quot; she told us. &quot;But it should be said that those folks who would not allow this slightly intimate contact with someone they didn&#x2019;t know were really just honoring a kind of unspoken social contract we share on the train and in other crowded spaces. New Yorkers must constantly make these unconscious decisions, attempting, I think, to carve out some private space in a city that can be so aggressively public.&quot;</p>

<p>Her take on it seems pretty reasonable, and you can read more <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150921021629/http://www.site95.org/2013/08/21/ferrandi/">about her experiment (and see photos) here.</a> Back in the spring, comedian Stuart Edge also tried this subway sleeping thing out, although with less altruistic interests.</p>
