But that doesn&apos;t mean that it&apos;s cool to repeatedly expose yourself and masturbate in front of a woman dressed as the Statue of Liberty. Some patriotic displays are best left to the imagination.<p></p>

<p>According <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150901095245/http://www.eastvalleytribune.com/local/tempe/article_f14a0dec-6c3a-11e0-916b-001cc4c03286.html">to Arizona police</a>, Kevin Robert Theriault was caught doing just that. He was arrested Monday in Tempe on suspicion of indecent exposure and public sexual indecency. Theriault is accused of exposing himself three times in the last month to a woman dressed as the Statue of Liberty promoting the Liberty Tax service. The victim reported the incidents to police last week, and they finally caught him on tax day:</p>

<blockquote>Suspecting that Theriault again would expose himself on tax day, police set up surveillance near the area where the woman would be working that afternoon, and shortly after 5 p.m. <strong>officers observed a man drive up in his Jeep Liberty, unzip his pants and begin to masturbate after he got out of his vehicle while looking at the woman standing in the parking lot of the business.</strong></blockquote>

<p>If you&apos;re so inclined, you can see Theriault&apos;s mug shot at the East Valley Tribune <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150901095245/http://www.eastvalleytribune.com/local/tempe/article_f14a0dec-6c3a-11e0-916b-001cc4c03286.html">here.</a> We can&apos;t even imagine what would have happened on the Fourth Of July...or, heaven forbid, if Theriault ever made it to Liberty Island.</p>
