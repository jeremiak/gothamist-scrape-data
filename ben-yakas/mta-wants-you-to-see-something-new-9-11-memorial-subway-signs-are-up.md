<p>Did you know that the tenth anniversary of 9/11 is coming up this weekend? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508153711/http://gothamist.com/tags/911">We were surprised too</a>! And we&apos;re still trying to figure out what we&apos;re <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508153711/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/07/what_to_do_on_911.php">going to do</a> on Sunday besides watch football&#x2014;Rex Ryan <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508153711/http://kissingsuzykolber.uproxx.com/2011/09/a-conspiracy-is-afoot-with-the-dunge.html#more-39032">is <em>not</em> afraid of The Wolfman</a>&#x2014;since our invitation to the ceremony must have been lost in the mail.

But even if we won&apos;t be able to go Sunday, we are legitimately interested in seeing the 9/11 memorial in person, and we like these new subway signs that have just been put up in lower Manhattan this week. But where&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508153711/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/06/photo_this_is_the_official_ny_state.php">the official pentagram-emblazoned 9/11 flag</a>?</p>
