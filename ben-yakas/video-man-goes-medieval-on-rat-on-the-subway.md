<p>This month, we&apos;ve already seen two prime examples of how NYers react to rats on their subway: with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231083745/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/13/video_rat_in_subway_car_crawls_over.php">nonchalance</a>, or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231083745/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/27/video_how_not_to_react_to_a_rat_in.php">utter panic</a>. Now rat-video king <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231083745/http://nyctheblog.blogspot.com/2011/01/more-rats-on-train-video.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed:+NycTheBlog+%28NYC+The+Blog%29&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader">NYC The Blog</a> is offering a third, much more primitive and cruel response to the mix: stomping on the rat. The video, taken by Vasily Zinchenko, is a vintage one made in 2008 on a D train near Grand Street station in Manhattan (but just uploaded yesterday to YouTube). Zinchenko&apos;s friend who was on the train with him, Uladzimir Taukachou, told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231083745/http://nyctheblog.blogspot.com/2011/01/more-rats-on-train-video.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed:+NycTheBlog+%28NYC+The+Blog%29&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader">NYC the Blog</a>: &quot;I saw how rat jumped in the train,. People were seating with their legs on seats. They were afraid that rat could bite them. Kids were so exited. It was fun.&quot; But be warned: a man in white shoes goes the ungentlemanly route, and furiously steps on the rat, seemingly killing it. Regardless, this is just further proof that it&apos;s the rats&apos; city now, and we&apos;re just renting space in it.</p>
