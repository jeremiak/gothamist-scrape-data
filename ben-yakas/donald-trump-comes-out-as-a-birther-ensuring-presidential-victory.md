And why shouldn&apos;t he, when he&apos;s already got <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170312152911/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/23/video_donald_trump_kim_jong-il_both.php">Lewis Black</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170312152911/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/03/24/limbaugh-donald-trump-per_n_840253.html">Rush Limbaugh</a> on his side, and he&apos;s only the third <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170312152911/http://gothamist.com/2010/10/29/wsj_poll_time_to_go_away_giuliani_a.php">least popular</a> figure in NYC. But Trump made a dangerous move yesterday <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170312152911/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/2011/03/24/2011-03-24_show_me_donald_trump_wants_to_see_president_obamas_birth_certificate_with_his_ow.html">during a visit</a> with the ladies of <em>The View:</em> he came out of the closet as a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170312152911/http://www.birthers.org/">birther</a>.</p>

<p>Trump said he felt President Obama was probably born in the USA...but if so, then why won&apos;t he show his birth certificate? &quot;I want him to show his birth certificate. I want him to show his birth certificate. There&apos;s something on that birth certificate that he doesn&apos;t like...I really believe there&apos;s a birth certificate. <strong>Why doesn&apos;t he show his birth certificate? And you know what? I wish he would. I think it&apos;s a terrible pale that&apos;s hanging over him,</strong>&quot; he barked at the hosts. Of course, it isn&apos;t like President Obama has ever <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170312152911/http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/51/BarackObamaCertificationOfLiveBirthHawaii.jpg">shown it </a>before. Trump just has a sixth sense for sketchy things. Whoopi Goldberg called his line of questioning, &quot;the biggest pile of dog mess I&apos;ve heard in ages.&quot; Here&apos;s the video:</p>

<p>Of course, some doubting Thomases are convinced that Trump is just trolling the media&#x2014;Slate editor <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170312152911/http://www.salon.com/news/politics/war_room/2011/03/24/trump_president_challenge/">Steve Kornacki</a> even bet every cent in his savings account that Trump&apos;s name won&apos;t be on the New Hampshire primary ballot next year. But Trump said that he would make a decision before June, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170312152911/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/national/donald_trump_fuels_presidential_L9H8VdTLgEJFFSjgTXgY6L">has plans to</a> deliver a speech in Iowa, the all-important campaign state, just around that time. He declared recently, &quot;If I run and if I win, this country will be respected again.&quot; And certainly, anyone who doesn&apos;t respect him with have some serious hell toupee.</p>
