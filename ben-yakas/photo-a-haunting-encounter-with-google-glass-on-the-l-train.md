<p>They&apos;re in our bars, they&apos;re at our <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160309092106/http://www.theverge.com/2013/5/9/4315230/using-google-glass-at-a-justin-timberlake-concert">Justin Timberlake corporate events</a>, and they rock out <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160309092106/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/08/google_glass_beats_by_dre_enlighten.php">to Beats by Dre</a>. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160309092106/http://gothamist.com/tags/googleglass">Google Glass-enhanced cyborgs</a> seem to be popping up all around NYC these days&#x2014;and since they have yet to master their telekinetic abilities, they still rely on the subway like the rest of us. One reader had a particularly haunting encounter with one such cyborg early Saturday morning: &quot;At 3 a.m. this morning... Works at Google X but couldn&apos;t tell us what she does,&quot; the tipster said. &quot;She spoke to the glasses and took pictures by blinking. Crazy.&quot; Chills.</p>

<p>The tipster didn&apos;t quite realize what they were at first, probably because it&apos;s still somewhat shocking to come across a living breathing cyborg in the year 2013: &quot;It was sort of discrete...At first glance I thought she was rocking a thin headband, but I was also sort of tipsy.&quot; Once she adjusted her dimensionally limited eyes, she did think they looked cool, but at least one of her friends thought &quot;the only reason the glasses worked was that she was a cute girl, and that any guy wearing them would have looked like a douche.&quot; And then there was the demonstration: &quot;She definitely looked cross eyed and silly when she was communicating with it.&quot;</p>

<p>This wasn&apos;t the first time we&apos;ve seen one of these cyberunicorns on the L Train&#x2014;Google employee <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160309092106/https://twitter.com/dflinner">David Flinner</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160309092106/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/09/google_glass_spotted_on_l_train.php">was spotted last month</a> chatting up with some Google Norms. Another reader sent in the below photo of him sporting the eyewear&#x2014;you don&apos;t have to be an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160309092106/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/21/photo_google_co-founder_sports_proj.php">attention-sucking facehugger</a> to be able to tell that his spirit is being completely snuffed out as he melds with his &quot;interactive second skin.&quot;</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="51113glass3.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160309092106im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/51113glass3.jpg" width="640" height="473"> <br> <i> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160309092106/http://www.flickr.com/photos/56504925@N08/8635582695/sizes/z/in/photostream/">harbi10&apos;s flickr</a></i></div> <p></p>

<p>These are far from the only haunting Google Glass interactions we&apos;ve come across in recent weeks. Below, watch as a man in Glass records a Time Square artist drawing his Google Glass-enhanced caricature, and feel your soul drip into the sewer.</p>

<p>Oh, but most New Yorkers are actually fine with it, right? That&apos;s what you might be led to believe by the video below. But of course that&apos;s just because these people are lying through the skin of their precious still 100% human flesh to the cyborgunicorns. </p>
