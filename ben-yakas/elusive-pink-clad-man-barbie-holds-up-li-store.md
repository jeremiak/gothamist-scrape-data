But now there&apos;s a new outlaw in town, and he wears pink.</p>

<p>A man dressed up like Barbie <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427144903/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2010/08/27/cops-man-in-pink-jumpsuit-robs-long-island-store/">attempted to rob</a> a convenient store in Lynbrook yesterday. The man wore a pink jumpsuit, blonde wig, and was carrying a white handbag. He flashed a handgun when he entered the store and demanded cash, but the clerk had trouble opening the register. As this scenario played out, ManBarbie &quot;became frustrated and stole a bottle of Gatorade and fled the store,&#x201D; said Nassau County Police Sgt. Anthony Repalone. He added that no one was injured in the holdup, but the real question is: was it love at first sight?</p>
