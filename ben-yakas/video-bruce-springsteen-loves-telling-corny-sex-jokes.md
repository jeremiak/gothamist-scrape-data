<p>Last night was the seventh annual Stand Up For Heroes benefit show at MSG, featuring comedians Jon Stewart, Jerry Seinfeld, Bill Cosby, and Jim Gaffigan, plus musician Roger Waters. As always, the final performance of the night was by the one and only <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429153503/http://gothamist.com/tags/brucespringsteen">Bruce Springsteen</a>. And Springsteen did what he does best: tell corny erection jokes.</p>

<p>The aforementioned erection joke comes at 1:30, before Springsteen performs &quot;Dancing In The Dark.&quot; There&apos;s a joke about a Nevada whorehouse at 7:06, followed by a performance of &#x201C;If I Should Fall Behind&#x201D; with wife Patti Scialfa. Then finally, a joke about an out-of-work piano player at 13:45, with a concluding performance of Suicide&apos;s &#x201C;Dream Baby Dream.&#x201D; </p>

<p>Below, you can watch the whole event, including Waters leading a group of soldiers (around 1:39:00) during a version of Leonard Cohen&apos;s classic &quot;Hallelujah.&quot; </p>
