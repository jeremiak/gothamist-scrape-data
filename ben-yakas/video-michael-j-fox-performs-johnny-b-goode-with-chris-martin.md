                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="12113fox.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20131205011145im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/12113fox.jpg" width="640" height="411" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>Last month, the Waldorf Astoria hosted the benefit <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131205011145/https://www.michaeljfox.org/foundation/news.html?tagid=263">A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to Cure Parkinson&apos;s</a>. Altogether, $5.5 million was raised for Parkinson&apos;s research. And the highlight of the night was the return of host Michael J. Fox to perform Chuck Berry&apos;s classic &quot;Johnny B. Goode.&quot; And this year, he was joined by Coldplay&apos;s Chris Martin, as you can watch in the video below.</p>

<p>Of course, it would have been perfect if they had gotten Chuck Berry&#x2014;who is still alive&#x2014;to perform with him. Or if Fox had sung it. Or if anyone had sung it instead of Martin. Although, it&apos;s nice that Martin added the &quot;watch me for the changes&quot; line, just like Fox did at Hill Valley High School in 1955.</p>

<p>Fox, who learned to play the song sometime after the first <em>Back To The Future</em> film, also performed the song at the event in 2011, as you can see below.</p>
