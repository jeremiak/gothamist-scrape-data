title: NY Post Discovers Drug Dealers Have Business Cards

										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="12111cards.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20140429022535im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/12111cards.jpg" width="120" height="122" class="image-left"> </span></p>

<p>Today, the NY Post <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140429022535/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/manhattan_drug_dealers_promote_delivery_T7JaecI3mZzdYPg4k34wuK">learned</a> that drug dealers sometimes use business cards, something we figured out when we were in middle school and saw <em>Half-Baked</em> for the first time. And they also learned that drug dealers target college students, which anyone who&apos;s gone <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140429022535/http://gothamist.com/2010/12/12/did_you_know_college_kids_do_drugs.php">to college</a> should already know. But we won&apos;t assume anything with the Post. </p>

<p>Cops broke up the &apos;brazen ring,&quot; run by Thomas &quot;Biggie&quot; Zenon, 40, and Miguel &quot;G&quot; Guzman, 43, both of Washington Heights. The delivery service had more than 200 steady customers, and among other things, sold high-quality cocaine for the low price of $60 per gram. We&apos;re worried how the Post is going to react when they find out exactly who is buried in Grant&apos;s tomb.</p>
