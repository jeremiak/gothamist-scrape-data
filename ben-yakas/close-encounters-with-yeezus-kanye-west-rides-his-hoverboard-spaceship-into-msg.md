<p>&quot;This is an extremely good year to be a Kanye West fan, if I do say so myself,&quot; Kanye West superfan <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021072627/http://gothamist.com/tags/kanyewest">Kanye West</a> told an audience of Kanye West fans last night during the second Kanye West show of the week at Madison Square Kanye. Or maybe he said it is an extremely good year <em>to be</em> Kanye West&#x2014;it was hard to hear him over the noise of the packed crowd. West enthusiastically told us multiple times throughout the night that we were responsible for &quot;the most tickets ever sold at Madison Square Garden.&quot; </p>

<p>But it&apos;s safe to say that in 2016, there is little difference distinguishing between a good year for Kanye and a good year for his fans. I don&apos;t know if West could lead an a capella singalong of &quot;I love you like Kanye loves Kanye&quot; without that being intrinsically true.</p>

<p>West, who is currently traveling the country on the Saint Pablo tour, played a 32-song set over approximately an hour and a half on Tuesday. This is his first major tour since the Yeezus tour in 2013, not that he&apos;s been a recluse since then&#x2014;between the album release parties (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021072627/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/12/kanye_west_tlop_msg.php#photo-1">also at MSG</a>), the sets and occasional guest appearances <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021072627/http://gothamist.com/2015/02/13/kanye_west_chaos.php#photo-1">at festivals</a>, the Yeezy fashion <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021072627/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/12/kanye_yay.php">events</a>, and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021072627/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/19/photos_video_kanye_west_pop-up.php#photo-1">occasional popups</a>, West has been near ubiquitous around NYC (and he returns again for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021072627/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/21/kanye_citi_field_october.php">the Meadows Music &amp; Arts Festival in October</a>). After taking two years to mostly focus on fashion and drop a few one-off singles (&quot;All Day,&quot; &quot;Only One&quot;), it&apos;s been nigh impossible to ignore West this year, even if you <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021072627/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/17/kanye_west_unloads_snl.php">wanted to.</a></p>

<p>Even so, those appearances were like lukewarm pots of coffee compared to the shots of espresso one gets at a fully-attuned, all-eyes-on-me Kanye West concert. Check out some of our observations from the show below: </p>

<p><strong>Merchandising &amp; Obnoxious Teenagers:</strong> There is no opener for Kanye West, unless you count &quot;standing on line for merch for hours&quot; as a warmup act. Although he didn&apos;t go on til 9:30 p.m., people showed up at MSG between 5 and 6 p.m. for a shot at some of West&apos;s apparel (as one person put it to me, &quot;athletiwear for people who don&apos;t play sports&quot;). It&apos;s just like Mel Brooks once <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021072627/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNZove4OTtI">put it</a>: &quot;Merchandising, merchandising, where the real money [from the concert] is made!&quot;</p>

<p>Despite all of West&apos;s anger in recent years over not being taken seriously in the fashion world, it&apos;s clear that he really is a fashion icon of sorts now&#x2014;the only thing more common than seeing people wearing Yeezy-emblazoned clothing was seeing people dressed up like one of Kanye&apos;s monochrome, oversized-shirt-wearing models. The true downside to all the milling about before the actual show weren&apos;t the overlong lines&#x2014;it was the disappointingly plentiful groups of obnoxious teenagers (and their cousins, oblivious undergrads) who roamed the corridors, desperately trying to start &quot;Pablo&quot; chants while shoving anyone in their paths. </p>

<p><strong>Hoverboard Spaceship:</strong> Back <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021072627/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/20/photos_videos_kanye_west_barclays_c.php#photo-1">on the Yeezus tour</a>, West used a giant ice mountain where the main stage would normally be to stage his most dramatic moments (it looked like a giant penis, FYI). West of course hasn&apos;t rested on his laurels for the latest tour, taking his ego from his crotch and into the stratosphere. Or at least the air above the General Admission section: West rides a hoverboard spaceship stage over the crowd for the bulk of the concert, with the stage moving from one side of the arena to the other every couple of songs. </p>

<p>The light show that came with it&#x2014;which almost seemed to take cues from <em>Blade Runner</em> as much as from say, Pink Floyd&#x2014;mixed it up between keeping West in the shadows and giving him a backdrop of flashing red lights on which to dance his heart out. From a technical standpoint, it&apos;s blaring and otherworldly: the GA section was in a constant fit of hyperactive moshing and dancing, especially when the lights from the stage would shine down on them, making those frantic fans the only visible sight in the arena. </p>

<p>The amount of careful preparation that must have gone into coordinating the lights and the stage movement&#x2014;let alone planning out every time the music would drop out for a single line to give the crowd space to yell out the line&#x2014;was impressive. Even more remarkable is the fact that Kanye was able to one-up his own overblown ice penis metaphor for a God metaphor, West floating on an almost literal ultralight beam above his most fervent followers. </p>

<p><strong>Runaway From The Rant:</strong> One of the signature moments of the 2013 tour was West&apos;s ritualistic performance of &quot;Runaway,&quot; which he would bolster with 10-20 minute long rants about being an underdog (between those moments and a lot of TV interviews at the time, 2013 really was the golden age of Kanye&apos;s Off-The-Cuff Verbal Thinkpieces). He seemed so overloaded with thoughts and feelings he needed to let out back then, it made every show thrilling and unpredictable (which of course became its own form of predictable at a certain point&#x2014;if you are just waiting for him to say something provocative or ego-stroking, it starts to lose its impact one braggadocio at a time).</p>

<p>But all that is gone now. Kanye West in 2016 has seemingly won back a large amount of the respect he felt he had lost between the Taylor Swift incident and his forays into the fashion world in 2013. He&apos;s at a point in his career where he can make fun of himself and Swift and anyone who cares that much about fame (which includes himself, of course) with &quot;Famous.&quot; Which means we&apos;ve moved into a post-rant phase of West&apos;s career. </p>

<p>The most we got during his performance of &quot;Runaway&quot; last night was the aforementioned line about it being a great year for Kanye West fans (or a great year for being Kanye West). I&apos;ve seen West three times live now (six if you count fashion and album premiere appearances), and this was <em>by far</em> the least talkative he&apos;s ever been. Considering West turned the rant into an art form on that previous tour, this was a slight disappointment for me, but I&apos;m sure there are a lot of people who are pleased by the new all-business, smile-friendly Kanye.</p>

<p>(Appropriately, in a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021072627/http://www.vogue.com/13473191/kanye-west-spring-2017-interview/?mbid=social_onsite_twitter">new interview with Vogue</a> this week, West noted, &quot;I&#x2019;m really not here for controversy,&quot; which is not something 2013 West would ever have uttered.)</p>

<p><strong>Medley Syndrome:</strong> As for the setlist, it was fascinating to see which of the newer <em>The Life Of Pablo</em> songs had been embraced by fans. Judging by enthusiastic singing along, the winners seem to be &quot;Father Stretch My Hands&quot; pt 1 &amp; 2, &quot;Famous&quot; (boy do people love singing that one, especially the &quot;bleached asshole&quot; part), &quot;Ultralight Beam,&quot; and &quot;Waves.&quot; (Bonus points to &quot;Freestyle 4,&quot; which definitely got the place shaking.) They all seemed to be greeted with a similar enthusiasm to classics like &quot;All Of The Lights,&quot; &quot;Jesus Walks,&quot; &quot;Blood On The Leaves,&quot; &quot;Touch The Sky&quot; and &quot;Flashing Lights.&quot;   </p>

<p>Although he played 32 songs, an hour and a half is relatively short for this kind of big production (though understandable, considering all the technical coordination required for the lights and stage and musical dropouts). This rivaled a GBV show for the sheer amount of tunes he packed into a short amount of time. But of course, that&apos;s because about 1/3 of the set was actually made up of medleys including one or two verses of a given song (this way, West could include bits of his cameos on the likes of Drake&apos;s &quot;Pop Style&quot; and ScHoolboy Q&apos;s &quot;THat Part&quot;). </p>

<p>Despite the show being a bit shorter than I would have liked, this live style really suited the new West, and was pretty simpatico with the way he compiled, then re-structured, then re-re-structured <em>The Life Of Pablo</em>, like an endless living mixtape. </p>

<p><strong>Sweat Factory:</strong> West started the evening in a hoodie, and all I could think about was how much he must have been sweating, especially once he got to the point in the evening when he was  bouncing around the stage like a mix between a praying mantis and one of those scarily-energetic self-help gurus. At times, it looked like he was on the end of a yo-yo, having been attached to a chain in the center of the stage, lest he bounced right off the stage.</p>

<p>He eventually took the sweatshirt off, but then my concerns turned to all the people reaching up to try to grab him or the stage. You can get a pretty good idea of just how much the platform was shaking from the video below:</p>
