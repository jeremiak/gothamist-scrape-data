										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none" style=" width:640px; "> <img alt="122111leviaron.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170223082627im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/122111leviaron.jpg" width="640" height="435"> <br> <i>Accused killer Levi Aron (left, AP) and victim Leiby Kletzky (right)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>The man who confessed to killing and dismembering 8-year-old Hasidic boy Leiby Kletzky this past fall has already been found mentally competent to stand trial&#x2014;but his lawyer is still arguing that he is insane. Lawyer Howard Greenberg <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170223082627/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/levi-aron-lawyer-pursues-insanity-defense-slaying-leiby-kletzky-article-1.994899">laid out his case</a> in defense of 35-year-old <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170223082627/http://gothamist.com/tags/leviaron">Levi Aron</a> to reporters outside Brooklyn Supreme Court this morning: &quot;He suffered a severe head injury as a young man. There&apos;s a history of schizophrenia,&quot; the lawyer said. &quot;There&apos;s inbreeding in that community.&quot;</p>

<p>The inbreeding accusation brought the most attention: &quot;Look, everybody knows when blood relations have offspring, there can be genetic defects,&quot; Greenberg said, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170223082627/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/levi_aron_lawyer_blames_client_actions_VbS3ySFHEF6zjfec16ZYNJ?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">according to the Post</a>. &quot;It&apos;s something that needs to be investigated down to the ground.&quot; The News says he noted, &quot;That&apos;s an aspect of his familial history.&quot; </p>

<p>Assemblyman Dov Hikind, who represents Borough Park, was disturbed by Greenberg&apos;s accusations, and called him &quot;a pathetic figure.&quot; &quot;It&apos;s an insult to the community. It&apos;s degrading,&quot; he said of the inbreeding remark. &quot;None of this is relevant. It has nothing to do with this situation and is only meant to distract us from the reality of the horrible act.&quot; Hikind was even harsher in his assessment to the Post: &quot;This lawyer is simply out of his freaking mind. He&apos;s a sick, self-hating Jew who&apos;s making a mockery of this case.&quot;</p>

<p>Greenberg also claimed that Aron suffered head trauma when he fell off a bike about the age of 10, and claims he is a diagnosed schizophrenic&#x2014;previously, Aron was found to have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170223082627/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/10/accused_child_murderer_levi_aron_ha.php">a personality disorder</a>, but a judge ruled that he was nevertheless <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170223082627/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/04/child_murder_suspect_found_fit_for.php">mentally fit to strand trial</a>. </p>
