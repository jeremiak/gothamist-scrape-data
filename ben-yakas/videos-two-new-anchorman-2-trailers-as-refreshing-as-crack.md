                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="102313anchorman.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20140223003920im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/102313anchorman.jpg" width="640" height="479" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>We already knew that the plot of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140223003920/http://gothamist.com/tags/anchorman"><em>Anchorman 2</em></a> would see Ron Burgundy and his news team <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140223003920/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/04/anchorman_2_will_take_on_the_nyc_ne.php">journeying to NYC in the 1980s</a>, but thanks to the two trailers below, we now know so much more about the new film. Like the fact that Baxter is back, Harrison Ford doesn&apos;t think much of Ron, and Brick thinks he&apos;s dead (and legless). And that there will be crack smoking, terrariums filled with scorpions, gay vampires, baby sharks, dance numbers and fault condoms. Watch the promising trailers below, then kick back <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140223003920/http://popwatch.ew.com/2013/10/09/director-on-ron-burgundy-dodge-durango-ads/">in your Dodge Durango.</a></p>
