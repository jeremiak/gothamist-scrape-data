<p>Buried amidst breathless updates about the nation&apos;s ongoing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509174331/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2341175/Kristen-Stewart-feels-betrayed-close-friend-Katy-Perrys-growing-bond-ex-Robert-Pattinson.html">K Stew/R Patz/K Perr/J May love quadrangle</a> crisis, it was announced today that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509174331/http://www.hmss.com/films/carver/">real life James Bond villain</a> Rupert Murdoch has filed for divorce from wife of 12 years Wendi Deng Murdoch. If a billionaire octogenarian <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509174331/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/14/rupert_murdoch_meets_with_vice_medi.php">Vice aficionado</a> and a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509174331/http://gawker.com/5926705/it-was-like-a-war-zone-a-former-nanny-for-rupert-murdoch-and-wendi-deng-speaks-out">&quot;conniving man-eater&quot;</a> half his age can&apos;t make it work in this world, who can? At least Murdoch chose to end the alliance in the dignified, respectful manner comparable to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509174331/http://www.spinner.com/2007/08/10/20-bitter-band-breakups-pixies/">the breakup of the Pixies</a>: &quot;Mrs. Murdoch was informed in advance of Mr. Murdoch&#x2019;s decision,&quot; a family friend <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509174331/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/14/business/media/rupert-murdoch-files-for-divorce-after-14-years-of-marriage.html?hp&amp;_r=0">assured the Times.</a> </p>

<p>This will be the 82-year-old Murdoch&apos;s third divorce, so he should have an idea of what he&apos;s in store for. Murdoch left his wife of 31 years, Anna, a year before he married Deng&#x2014;the actual marriage occurred 17 days after the divorce went through. That divorce <strong>reportedly cost him $1.7 billion, including $110 million in cash.</strong> Deng has become quite successful in her own right, getting involved with movie producing and art startup Art.sy, but she is undoubtedly accustomed to a certain lifestyle that will cost a pretty penny to maintain.</p>

<p>Despite some <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509174331/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/17/fashion/wendi-murdoch-is-creating-a-career-of-her-own.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0">loving profiles</a> and romantic <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509174331/http://gothamist.com/2011/07/19/rupert_murdochs_wife_also_shoved_sh.php">pie-related gestures</a>, fissures in the marriage have been apparent for awhile now: Deng was rumored to have had an affair with MySpace co-founder Chris DeWolfe, and Murdoch lost his wedding ring at one point.  </p>

<p>Most prominently, the two reportedly almost divorced after Murdoch mentioned during a televised interview that his two children with Deng&#x2014;Grace, 11, and Chloe, 9&#x2014;wouldn&apos;t have  the same voting rights in his company as his children from his previous two marriages. </p>

<p>After the infamous pie punching incident, Murdoch biographer Michael Wolff saw it as proof of their eternal love: &quot;I thought, &apos;That&apos;s our Rupert and that&apos;s our Wendi,&apos;&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509174331/http://abcnews.go.com/US/wendi-rupert-murdoch-true-character-biographer/story?id=14109749#.UboOffbuVg9">he told ABC</a>. &quot;She&apos;s done it all. She&apos;s had no pretense that she&apos;s taking it and grabbing it for herself, and the thing you feel is kind of good for her.&quot;</p>

<p>As for today&apos;s news, Wolff was fairly speechless on Twitter:</p>
