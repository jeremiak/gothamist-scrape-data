<p>As a tense, stormy night turned into a jubilant morning, Brookfield Properties blinked and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170415151457/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/14/live_from_occupy_wall_street_where.php#photo-1">rescinded their demand</a> to clean Zuccotti Park, where hundreds of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170415151457/http://gothamist.com/tags/occupywallstreet">Occupy Wall Street</a> protesters have set up camp for the last month. Mayor Bloomberg in turn told the NYPD to stand down, and outside of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170415151457/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/14/hiv_positive_protester_says_cop_who.php">some punches</a> and a few arrests, things have stabilized downtown. But don&apos;t think that Bloomberg is happy <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170415151457/http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/culture/2011/10/3741845/bloomberg-brookfield-got-threatening-calls-lawmakers">over the way things got to</a> this breaking point.</p>

<p>The mayor spent much of his weekly radio appearance on the John Gambling Show on WWOR discussing the escalating situation at Zuccotti Park, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170415151457/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/protest_park_cleanup_could_still_NgRHA6mcsXUEsfhH7KKqOO?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">he offered some particularly bitchy words</a> for city officials who aided protesters by calling up Brookfield, who owns the Park. &quot;My understanding is Brookfield got lots of calls from many elected officials, threatening them and saying if you don&apos;t stop this we&apos;ll make your life more difficult,&quot; Bloomberg said. &quot;If those elected officials had spent half as much time trying to promote the city to get jobs to come here we would a lot more ways towards answering the concerns of the protestors.&quot; Those elected officials included Rep. Jerry Nadler and Manhattan Borough President Scott Stringer.  Of course, Bloomberg didn&apos;t mention how his girlfriend Diana Taylor <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170415151457/http://blog.littlesis.org/2011/10/05/the-public-private-partnership-behind-zuccotti-park/">sits on the board of Brookfield Properties</a>.</p>

<p>Zuccotti Park is a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170415151457/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/08/zuccotti_park_owners_may_not_be_abl.php#photo-1">privately-owned public space</a>; it&apos;s open 24 hours a day to the public, but is nevertheless owned by Brookfield, and they are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170415151457/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/14/nyregion/zuccotti-park-is-privately-owned-but-open-to-the-public.html?_r=1&amp;partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">allowed to impose &#x201C;reasonable&#x201D; rules</a> regarding behavior and cleanliness. So the city can&apos;t do anything there unless Brookfield <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170415151457/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/13/brookfield_tells_ows_protesters_to.php">calls them in.</a></p>

<p>Bloomberg sounded disappointed that didn&apos;t happen today, and gave a vague threat to protesters that this was only a temporary stopgap, and the clock was still ticking: &quot;I&apos;ve asked what would happen if they cannot (reach a deal). The answer I got was they would want to go ahead and do exactly what they were going to do this morning,&quot; Bloomberg said. &quot;<strong>From our point of view, it will be a little bit harder, I think, at that point in time to provide police protection.</strong> But we have the greatest police department in the world and will do what is necessary.&quot;</p>

<p>It also came out today that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170415151457/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/occupy_wall_street/2011/10/14/2011-10-14_zuccotti_park_owners_received_nearly_700000_in_govt_handouts_since_911_terrorist.html?r=ny_local&amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaig">Brookfield has netted nearly $700,000</a> in government handouts since the 9/11 terror attacks, under somewhat shady circumstances related to a small affiliate of Brookfield being treated as its own small business&#x2014;the company received multiple six-figure grants meant for small businesses hurt by 9/11.</p>
