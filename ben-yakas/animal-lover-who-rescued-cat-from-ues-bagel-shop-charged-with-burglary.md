<p>A Long Island <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131002013823/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/cat-love-rescue-kitty-handcuffs-article-1.1469105">woman was arrested</a> after she &quot;rescued&quot; a sick cat from an Upper East Side bagel shop last week. According to the News, 50-year-old Nancy Glassman spotted Cosmo, a black-and-white cat with &quot;freakishly large ears,&quot; in Bagels &amp; Co. on 76th Street and York Avenue last Sunday. She grabbed him and took him to an animal clinic nearby, and was arrested later that night, because no good deed goes unpunished, and no cat deed goes pun-less: &quot;There&apos;s no pussyfooting around it,&quot; said NYPD spokesman John McCarthy. &quot;You can&apos;t just walk into a store and walk out with someone else&#x2019;s cat &#x2014; or any other property for that matter.&quot;</p>

<p>Glassman says she asked a store worker what was wrong with the kitty, and the worker just shrugged, pointed to a back exit, and said, &quot;Take the cat.&quot; So she did just that, grabbing the cat and dropping him off at Animal Care &amp; Control on 110th Street. Around 9:30 p.m., two detectives came to her door and asked her to come identify the cat. &quot;I thought they were investigating the owner of the store,&quot; Glassman said. &quot;I thought I did nothing wrong...But I guess I&apos;m an idiot.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So, if I see a child or an animal that&apos;s in distress, I&apos;m supposed to just leave them there?&quot; Glassman said she asked cops. &quot;And they said, &apos;Yup, you just leave it and call 911.&apos;&quot; Cosmo, whom Glassman said was &quot;filthy&quot;, has a &quot;genetic deformity,&quot; which explains the oversized ears.</p>

<p>The store&apos;s owner, Yuval Aroety, is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131002013823/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/owner-cosmo-cat-stolen-do-gooder-nyc-store-angry-abuse-suspicions-article-1.1469884">angry over being painted as a cat abuser</a>: &#x201C;I did a good thing, and you see what I get? I get screwed for it,&#x201D; he told News, adding that he rescued it from an animal shelter 10 days prior. &#x201C;It looks a little weird, but it&#x2019;s otherwise healthy,&quot; said his lawyer, Daniella Levi. &quot;This is a stay-at-home cat who lives with him, his wife and two teenage children.&#x201D;</p>

<p>&#x201C;No one gave this woman permission to take the cat,&#x201D; Levi added. &#x201C;The reason she was caught was because one of the store employees ran after her and took down the license plate.&#x201D;</p>
