Assistant Bergen Country Prosecutor Wayne Mello  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623142216/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/too_fat_lawyer_closes_with_old_and_cCiYjSyVKY3x114wrHsUJL">even poked fun</a> at Ates&apos; weight, saying, &#x201C;He&#x2019;s not running a marathon. I&#x2019;ll agree he probably can&#x2019;t do that...What he can do is execute his son.&#x201D; </p>

<p>However, the AP reports, &quot;Prosecutors also said <strong>there was evidence that the killer was hungry: A Burger King hamburger wrapper was found near Duncsak&#x2019;s body</strong>, and Duncsak was on his cell phone moments before he was shot asking his girlfriend if she had left the Whopper wrapper there. <strong>She said she had not</strong>.&quot; </p>

<p>Ates&apos; lawyer reminded the jury that Ates was 60 pounds heavier than he is today&#x2014;&quot;Look at him!&quot;&#x2014;when the murder occurred, weighing in at 285 pounds, and wouldn&apos;t be able to &quot;run up a staircase, accurately shoot Duncsak, leave before police arrived, then make a 21-hour drive to his mother&#x2019;s home in order to create an alibi as prosecutors claim.&quot;</p>
