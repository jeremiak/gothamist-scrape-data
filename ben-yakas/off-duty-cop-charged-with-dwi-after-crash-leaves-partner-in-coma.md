Officer Rafael Casiano was driving his personal vehicle on the Bronx River Parkway near the Cross Bronx Expressway around 4:30 p.m when his car skidded, hit a divider, and flipped. <p></p>

<p>While Casiano hurt his back, his partner, whose name hasn&apos;t been released yet, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160702113617/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/bronx_charged_parkway_drunk_driving_zOhq8O5FYxvpIOC3F8c7iL">suffered serious head trauma</a> and was put into a medically-induced coma. Investigators determined at the scene that Casiano had been drinking, and arrested him. However, they delayed giving the officer a Breathalyzer test for nine hours, a source told the News; the results of that test are not known. Casiano has been suspended, and was arraigned at Bronx Criminal Court late yesterday,</p>
