The mall has a policy that groups of four or more people under 21 years old and unaccompanied by a parent are not allowed to linger at the mall. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170306063454/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/18/nyregion/18mall.html?_r=1&amp;partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">According to Jesse Tron</a> of the International Council of Shopping Centers, the policy is unusually harsh, &#x201C;more all-encompassing&#x201D; than others around the country, and &#x201C;more restrictive&#x201D; of young shoppers. <p></p>

<p>The rules have been in place since the mall opened, but has been enforced very erratically. Advocates of the plan cite the incident at Buffalo Wild Wings last year, when <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170306063454/http://gothamist.com/2009/11/13/cheap_chicken_wing_deal_ruined_by_g.php">shootings occured over delicious deals</a>, as one reason why the crackdown is necessary. But things seem to have escalated recently, with guards having been told to step it up and turn away more teens. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170306063454/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/18/nyregion/18mall.html?_r=1&amp;partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">According to the Times</a>:</p>

<blockquote>On Thursday, however, just after 3 p.m., some guards at the Atlantic Terminal entrances asked for ID and then turned teenagers away, even some in groups of less than four. Stephanie Cineus, 15, a junior at a nearby high school, tried to get in with a friend, but both were barred from entering.</blockquote>
