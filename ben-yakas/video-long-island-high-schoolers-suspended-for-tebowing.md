<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150531024901/http://tebowing.com/">Tebowing</a> is the new <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150531024901/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/22/no_planking_anytime_according_to_th.php">planking</a> is the new icing: none of them are <em>good</em>, but at least none of them involve putting vodka up <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150531024901/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/27/vodka_eyeballing_trend_jumps_the_po.php">your eyeball</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150531024901/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/22/shameless_blogger_actually_does_tha.php">your vagina</a>. Nevertheless, one Long Island high school doesn&apos;t appreciate how their students have been creating hallway hazards by Tebowing (to get down on a knee and start praying, ala Denver Broncos star QB Tim Tebow). Four Long Island teens <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150531024901/http://www.newsday.com/sports/riverhead-students-suspended-for-tebowing-1.3392835?qr=1">have been given suspensions</a> from Riverhead High School for Tebowing this week. Watch them do their thing below.</p>

<p>Brothers Tyler and Connor Carroll and classmates Jordan Fulcoly and Wayne Drexel were all given the one-day suspensions for kneeling and bowing their heads like Tebow. A fundamentalist Christian, Tebow has made no secret of his intense religious beliefs, and basically performs the prayer act before and after every play. Superintendent Nancy Carney and Principal David Wicks <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150531024901/http://www.newsday.com/sports/riverhead-students-suspended-for-tebowing-1.3392835?qr=1">made it clear to Newsday</a> that the suspensions had nothing to do with the religious nature of the gesture: &quot;It causes a potentially unsafe situation with 1,500 people in the building,&quot; Principal David Wicks said. &quot;If you have 40 kids kneeling down in the middle of a hallway, and God forbid a fire alarm goes off, they could potentially stop someone from getting to safety.&quot;</p>

<p>Moreover, Carney says two of the suspensions were later rescinded, because administrators found that those students were not given the same warnings that the other two were. She added that she&apos;s received hate mail from people claiming the suspensions are due to religious prejudice: &quot;It&apos;s very unsettling,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150531024901/http://espn.go.com/new-york/nfl/story/_/id/7357978/high-school-athletes-suspended-tebowing">she told ESPN.</a> &quot;It&apos;s a shame that people out there are so ready to judge when they weren&apos;t there to see what happened.&quot;</p>

<p>The kids of course think it&apos;s unfair: &quot;It was basically just a tribute to Tim Tebow,&#x201D; 17-year-old Carroll Connor <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150531024901/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/li_tebow_taunters_o2qRP4jvTksWW1XIy1eMqI">told the Post</a>. &#x201C;It was more than a religious thing. There was some of that involved obviously, because he prays. I guess it was basically like a moment of silence. I just don&#x2019;t think it&#x2019;s fair.&quot; At this rate, how long before kids get caught <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150531024901/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/09/brooklyn_man_claims_credit_for_tebo.php">Teboozing</a>?</p>
