<p>Did you get through <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231063333/http://gothamist.com/tags/santacon">SantaCon 2013</a> without being puked on and/or puking? Then you did a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231063333/https://twitter.com/CP5188/status/411961538011205633">whole lot</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231063333/https://twitter.com/davidgustav/status/411933446488223744">better</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231063333/https://twitter.com/raphael_brion/status/411888004462956546">than some</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231063333/https://twitter.com/MattMinerXVX/status/411879678547210240">people did</a>! But SantaCon was by all accounts less vomitorious than it has been in years past, and that&apos;s due in party to the NYPD harshing those Christmas vibes: &#x201C;They are ruining Santa Con. They are ruining our fun...The cops should be here, but not to bust our balls,&#x201D; Anthony Perugini, a 28-year-old teacher, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231063333/http://nypost.com/2013/12/15/killjoy-cops-vs-santa-con/">told the Post</a>. &#x201C;That&#x2019;s not cool. That&#x2019;s wrong, man!&#x201D;</p>

<p>In response <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231063333/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/26/elected_officials_to_santacon_youre.php">to complaints</a> about the annual booze binge, the NYPD stepped up their presence on the Lower East Side yesterday, stationing along the pub crawl for the first time&#x2014;they gave out at least 10 summonses by early morning. &#x201C;You can&#x2019;t have a good time when the cops are hovering over you,&#x201D; 23-year-old medical assistant Ashley Urciuoli said. </p>

<p>As a result, the videos coming out from yesterday are slightly less debaucherous <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231063333/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/16/watch_the_drunk_santacon_video_roun.php">than they were last year</a>. But there are still plenty of obnoxious bros screaming and chugging from bottles of Goldschlager, enough to remind you what the true spirit of SantaCon is all about.</p>

This isn&apos;t The End. </p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: Speaking of which, here&apos;s a brawl featuring six Santas wailing on some non-besuited bystanders:</p>
