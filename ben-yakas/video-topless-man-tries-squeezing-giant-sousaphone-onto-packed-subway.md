<p>We must take our hats off to the incredibly reasonable shirtless young man in the video below, who was hauling around his giant sousaphone during yesterday&apos;s disgustingly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130915060222/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/11/its_mid-summer_in_september.php">humid sub-tropical heatgasm</a>. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130915060222/http://instagram.com/funnyhernandez">Mike H.</a> missed two trains just to watch as the sousaphonist labored to get onto a packed subway.
