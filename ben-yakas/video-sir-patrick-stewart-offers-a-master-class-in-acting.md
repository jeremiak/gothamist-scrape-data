<p>Since moving to Park Slope with new wife <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150601001922/http://sunnyozell.com/">Sunny Ozell</a>, Sir <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150601001922/http://gothamist.com/tags/patrickstewart">Patrick Stewart</a> has been living a utopian life filled with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150601001922/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/29/sir_patrick_stewart_eats_first_slic.php">pizza tastings</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150601001922/https://twitter.com/SirPatStew/status/292219126368333825">Subway gripings.</a> But based on the video below, in which he offers Ozell a masterclass in acting, he seems very happy with his new life. Or as he puts it: &quot;What you have to understand about the quadruple take [is that I&apos;m stoned out of my gourd].&quot;</p>

<p>We always knew <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150601001922/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_eSwq1ewsU">Stewart could act</a>, but we never knew he could <em>act-act</em>, let alone <em>act-act-act-act</em>. As the man himself put it, acting is a noble profession&#x2014;we only can hope that he has some time between acting gigs to complete his James Bond/Professor X/softcore porn screenplay.</p>
