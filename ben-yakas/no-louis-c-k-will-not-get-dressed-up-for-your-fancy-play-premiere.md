<p>The law bends for no man, and similarly, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405204502/http://gothamist.com/tags/louisck">Louis C.K.</a> bends for no famous friend&#x2014;today, Ricky Gervais <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405204502/https://twitter.com/rickygervais/status/239375105648648194/photo/1">tweeted</a> a photo of himself, Jerry Seinfeld and Louis C.K. from last year&apos;s premiere of Chris Rock&apos;s Broadway debut, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405204502/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/30/motherfker_with_the_hat_writer_blas.php"><em>The Motherf@*ker With The Hat</em></a>. And as is apparent from the picture above, Louis C.K. came dressed in basically the same ensemble he wore when he vigorously defended masturbation in an episode of <em>Louie</em>.  </p>

<p>Not so surprisingly, all those famous friends have or will appear in <em>Louie</em>: Gervais played the wisecracking Dr. Ben in a first season episode, Seinfeld will appear sometime later this season, and Rock appeared as himself in the season 2 finale. Rock commented on C.K.&apos;s ascendance over the last few years <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405204502/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/05/movies/q-and-a-chris-rock-is-itching-for-dirty-work.html?pagewanted=all">to the Times recently</a> (in an interview in which he argued, &#x201C;<em>Grown Ups</em> is better than <em>The Artist</em>&#x201D;):</p>

<blockquote>I feel like I&#x2019;m James Brown, and Jimi Hendrix was in my band. He was just some kid I used to beat up, and now he&#x2019;s back, and he&#x2019;s Jimi Hendrix. Is he better than me? I don&#x2019;t know, maybe. He used to write for so many people. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m going to L.A. and take some pitch meetings, write some shows.&#x201D; Dude, write for yourself, I would constantly tell him. And some people are funny older than they are younger. Rodney Dangerfield was that. Redd Foxx was that &#x2014; had careers as young people but when they got older, it was, like, this guy&#x2019;s hysterical. And Louie, at 44, it&#x2019;s the sweet spot for him.</blockquote>
 
And in case you missed it, check out the deleted segment from <em>Louie</em> below, in which C.K. teaches his daughters a lesson about apologizing:
