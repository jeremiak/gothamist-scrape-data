But did you know that he has mad Photoshop skills?</p>

<p>Continuing in his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150723131558/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/15/general_paladino_preps_for_fight_wi.php&lt;br /&gt;
">quest</a> to <strike>be noticed by</strike> ruffle Andrew Cuomo&apos;s calm exterior, Paladino sent out a new flyer to reporters yesterday showing Cuomo in the shower, with special interests and labor parties clinging to him like grime. Also, the Democrat has a gold necklace...because he&apos;s Italian-American...but it&apos;s not a stereotype, he swears! &#x201C;That would mean something if it was coming from anyone else but an Italian. Carl has his own gold chain he wears very proudly.

<p>Paladino just <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150723131558/http://www.scribd.com/doc/37516846/Paladino-Debate-Challenge-To-Cuomo">really wants to debate</a> Cuomo, and he isn&apos;t happy that Cuomo hasn&apos;t called him back about it yet. Doesn&apos;t Paladino know you have to wait at least two days before calling back? But while Cuomo hasn&apos;t responded yet, Conservative Party Chairman Michael Long, who backed Rick Lazio in the GOP primary, did, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150723131558/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/09/18/2010-09-18_gov_ought_to_be_jailed__paladino_kicks_up_another_hornets_nest_with_blasts_at_cr.html">calling Paladino unelectable</a> and &quot;more of a caricature, not a candidate.&quot; </p>
