<p>Earlier this year, there were rumors that beloved kvetsh <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408100919/http://gothamist.com/tags/larrydavid">Larry David</a> had been working on a new play (possibly involving Jerry Seinfeld)&#x2014; and unlike the somewhat disappointing, much-rumored <em>Seinfeld</em> Super Bowl commercial reunion, it seems Larry made good on his evasiveness about the project. David <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408100919/http://mobile.nytimes.com/blogs/artsbeat/2014/08/07/larry-david-will-make-his-broadway-debut/">confirmed to the Times today</a> that he&apos;ll make his Broadway debut this winter in his first play, &quot;Fish in the Dark.&quot; And he&apos;ll be playing &quot;somebody very similar to Larry David&#x2014;it might even be Larry David with a different name.&quot;</p>

<p>The rumors, which were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408100919/http://www.showbiz411.com/2014/08/05/exclusive-larry-david-headed-to-broadway-in-his-own-new-comedy">first reported by Showbiz411</a>, claimed the play was called &quot;Shiva,&quot; aka the Jewish period of mourning. The title might not have been right, but it sounds like that&apos;s the concept: the play is a comedy about a death in a family, with about 15 characters, and was inspired by the death of a friend&#x2019;s father. &#x201C;I thought it would be pretty cool to write a play someday,&quot; he told the Times. &quot;I didn&#x2019;t think it&#x2019;d be pretty cool to be in it. It&#x2019;s not like I would go to the theater and look up on stage and say, &#x2018;I could be in that.&#x2019; I didn&#x2019;t thinking of myself playing the character, but of course I write characters very close to me.&#x201D;</p>

<p>David noted that he hasn&apos;t been in a play &quot;since the eighth grade, when I did &#x2018;Charley&#x2019;s Aunt.&#x2019; I seem to remember wearing a dress. That&#x2019;s it. And I&#x2019;m not even really an actor. But I&#x2019;m still sleeping at night, and I hope that continues.&quot; He also said he wasn&apos;t planning on starring in it, but was convinced by producer Scott Rudin. &quot;I didn&#x2019;t really want to do it, but, I mean, do you know Scott? He&#x2019;s a very persuasive fellow, and I give him a lot of credit for that,&quot; he added.</p>

<p>The play will be directed by Tony Award-winner Anna D. Shapiro, and will officially open on March 5th; no other cast announcements have been made yet. David, whose last project was the HBO film <em>Clear History</em>, may not have appeared on Broadway in real life, but he did in the fourth season of <em>Curb Your Enthusiasm</em>, in a hilarious production of <em>The Producers</em> which you can watch below. Let&apos;s hope Larry remember his lines this time.</p>

<p>As for another season of <em>Curb</em>, it sounds pretty likely, if not an immediate priority for David: &quot;I&#x2019;m not going to mentally do that to myself right now,&quot; he said of making a decision about a new season. &#x201C;But if I did do another season, this play would push that schedule back.&quot; All in all, this all sounds pretty, pretty, pretty good to us.</p>
