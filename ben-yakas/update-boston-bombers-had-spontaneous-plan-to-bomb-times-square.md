<p><strong>[Update Below]</strong> Yesterday, NYPD Commissioner Ray Kelly revealed that the two brothers accused <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130529005643/http://gothamist.com/tags/bostonmarathon">bombing the Boston Marathon</a> had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130529005643/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/24/nypd_boston_marathon_bombing_suspec.php">planned to travel to NYC to go party</a> after their photos had been released to the world. But <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130529005643/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Boston-Marathon-Bombers-NYC-Times-Square-204700781.html?_osource=SocialFlowTwt_NYBrand">officials tell NBC that</a> there may have been more to it than that: their source says Dzhokhar Tsarnaev subsequently told investigators that he and his brother discussed the idea of exploding the rest of their bombs in Times Square.</p>

<p>The brothers did indeed have more explosives on them when police caught up to them Thursday night. However, officials cautioned to NBC that the idea was &quot;aspirational&quot; and not developed. Either way, immediately after NBC&apos;s report was released, a press conference with Kelly was announced for 1:30 p.m. at City Hall. You can watch it live below, and we&apos;ll update this post once that&apos;s happened.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: Mayor Bloomberg and Commissioner Kelly held a joint press conference this afternoon to confirm reports that the alleged Boston bombers had been planning to attack Times Square. &quot;Last night, we were informed by the FBI that surviving Boston attacker revealed that New York City was next on their list of targets,&quot; Bloomberg said. &quot;The surviving attacker told the FBI that he and his brother intended to drive to NYC and detonate additional explosives in Times Square.&quot;</p>

<p>Kelly expanded on that plan a bit, saying that they &quot;spontaneously&quot; decided on Times Square as a target on Thursday evening, after they had carjacked a man near Watertown. &quot;That plan fell apart when they realized the vehicle they hijacked was low on gas,&quot; Kelly said. &quot;They ordered the driver to stop at a nearby gas station. The driver was able to escape and call the police. That led to the shootout in Watertown.&quot;</p>

<p>Kelly said Tsarnaev brothers were carrying six improvised explosive devices on them: one was a pressure cooker bomb (similar to the two they detonated at the marathon), and the other five were pipe bombs. They didn&apos;t have any specific details about where in Times Square they were planning to target, nor when. </p>

<p>Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is known to have visited Times Square at least two times last year, in April and November 2012; officials don&apos;t know whether those visits were related in any way to the &quot;spontaneous&quot; decision to bomb Times Square.</p>

<p>During the first interview with Tsarnaev, which occurred between Saturday night and Sunday morning, he told officials the brothers were planning to go to NYC Thursday night to party; that story changed in the second interview, which occurred between Sunday night and Monday morning. Bloomberg reiterated several times that the NYPD never interrogated Tsarnaev&#x2014;the FBI and local Boston police departments provided the information to them&#x2014;but Kelly added: &quot;To the best of my knowledge, [Tsarnaev] is speaking. He was more lucid in the second interview, more expansive at giving detail. The first interview was a relatively short time after he went into hospital.&quot;</p>

<p>Ray Kelly said it&apos;s &quot;unknown&quot; whether NYPD&apos;s counter-terrorism measures would have been able to thwart the Boston bombers&apos; plans, but he said there was no evidence that NYC is a target of another attack stemming from the Boston bombings. Bloomberg was a bit testier when he was questioned about what NYC has done since the bombings, and what it might have done if this plan came to fruition: &quot;We don&apos;t make light of anything. We have to assume the worst, and deploy our resources to make sure it doesn&apos;t happen....Whenever we get information we take it seriously, no matter how far fetched it may be, or no matter whether we think it may accurate.&quot;</p>

<p>He added at the end that he feels safe going out tonight: &quot;It&apos;s a dangerous world, but you&apos;re probably safer here than everywhere else,&quot; he said.&quot;We&apos;ve spared no expense, and we&apos;ve never let our guard down in the last [11 1/2 years].&quot; Bloomberg was also asked at one point whether stop-and-frisk could have helped catch a terrorist suspect: &quot;Stop and frisk is designed to get guns out of hands in the street. The likelihood of finding a terrorist and stoping and frisking isn&apos;t great.&quot;</p>
