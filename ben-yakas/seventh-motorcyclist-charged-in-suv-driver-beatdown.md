<p>A seventh motorcyclist has been charged for his alleged involvement in the incident in which a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131128062135/http://gothamist.com/tags/motorcyclerallyroadrage">group of motorcyclists chased and beat a terrified SUV driver</a> last month. James Kuehne, 31, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131128062135/http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2013/10/10/seventh-biker-charged-in-west-side-chase-and-attack/?mod=WSJBlog">has been charged with</a> gang assault, assault and criminal mischief charges for the incident that occurred on September 29th. Police say he hit SUV driver Alexian Lien with his helmet and also broke a part of the SUV&apos;s back window. </p>

<p>Prosecutors added that Kuehne was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131128062135/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/06/suv_driver_was_beaten_and_stomped_o.php">one of at least five or six motorcyclists</a> who could be seen on video beating Lien &#x201C;at least three times while he was on the ground&#x201D; with his helmet. Motorcyclist Robert Sims, who police say also tried to open the SUV&apos;s door, also appeared in court yesterday, but he has not been charged as of yet.</p>

<p>Kuehne&apos;s lawyer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131128062135/http://www.ny1.com/content/news/190243/seventh-motorcyclist-arraigned-on-charges-connected-to-road-rage-incident">told reporters</a> that he expected new evidence to be released that would give new context to the melee: &quot;He happens to be an individual that&apos;s very upset and very distraught about this entire situation,&quot; said lawyer Joseph Mure. &quot;I promise you as this case goes on, <strong>we&apos;re going to hear things that took place that day a lot different than were shown on the videos. Things are not always what they seem to be.</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>This comes a day after it was revealed that 28-year-old Internal Affairs Bureau officer Matthew Rodriguez has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131128062135/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/10/internal_affairs_cop_involved_in_mo.php">come forward and admitted he was riding</a> with the group as well; no charges have been filed against Rodriguez, but the investigation is ongoing.</p>

His neighbors in Long Island City told the Post he threw loud rooftop parties, and implied he smoked pot. &#x201C;How can a cop be here and not stop it?&#x201D; the neighbor asked them of the beating. &#x201C;You&#x2019;d think he was on the other side.&#x201D;<br>
