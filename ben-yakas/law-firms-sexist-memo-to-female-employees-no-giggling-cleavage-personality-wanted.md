<p>A Manhattan law firm has been criticized after an internal memo directed toward female employees was leaked onto the internet. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131128045352/http://abovethelaw.com/2013/10/biglaw-memo-from-top-firm-advises-that-women-dont-giggle-dont-show-cleavage/">Above The Law says</a> they received the memo, entitled &#x201C;Presentation Tips for Women,&#x201D; last night; it was reportedly distributed by a member of the Women&#x2019;s Committee to all women associates across the U.S. offices of legal firm <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131128045352/http://www.cliffordchance.com/home.html">Clifford Chance</a>. Among other things, female lawyers in the company&#x2014;who presumably went through decades of education to get said jobs&#x2014;are told to &#x201C;practice hard words,&#x201D; stop using the word &quot;like,&quot; avoid giggling, &quot;watch out for the urinal position,&quot; and not show any cleavage. Read the whole memo below.</p>

<p>Can&apos;t imagine at all why some women might be a bit ticked off by being told how to speak, how to wear heels, what female icons to admire, and ya know, that they must &quot;PRACTICE HARD WORDS.&quot;  </p>

<p>One of the recipients of the email told Above The Law, &quot;female associates are very upset by not only the elementary nature of the tips themselves, but the suggestion that these would only apply to women. We have never been a very female friendly firm, but this is beyond the pale.&quot; </p>

<p>The company defended the memo as mostly &quot;common sense,&quot; and &quot;a personal perspective, shared with a group of colleagues, some just starting out in their careers.&quot; To be fair, it is important that someone teaches young women just starting in their careers out how chauvinistic law firms can be. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131128045352/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/03/lawyer_accused_of_forcing_sex_on_su.php">How else are they supposed to learn</a>?</p>
