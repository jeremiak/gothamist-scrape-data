title: New Anti-Abortion Bus Ads Sure To Not Stir Any Pots

<p>Pro-life organization the Chiaroscuro Foundation is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141220232302/http://nyc41percent.com/">putting up</a> the above ad on buses across the city for the next month. The ads are in response to a report last month that 41 percent of viable pregnancies end in abortion in NYC. After the report was released, the Chiaroscuro Foundation organized a press conference with Archbishop Timothy Dolan, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141220232302/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/07/clergy_slam_nycs_40_abortion_rate.php">during which</a> he called the figure &quot;downright chilling.&quot; The group is allegedly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141220232302/http://www.nydailynews.com/blogs/dailypolitics/2011/02/anti-abortion-group-ads-hit-nyc-buses">annoyed</a> at Mayor Bloomberg&apos;s understated response to the figure&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141220232302/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/09/bloomberg_questions_that_41_abortio.php">he told</a> WNYC, &#x201C;I have no idea if that&#x2019;s an accurate number or not. I just don&#x2019;t know.&quot; </p>

<p>In a statement, Foundation Executive Director Greg Pfundstein said: &quot;We held a news conference to highlight the city&apos;s 41% abortion ratio; we wrote the mayor asking for his leadership and assistance.  And, the mayor&apos;s only response to date suggests that he is not prepared to address the City&apos;s abortion crisis. <strong>We sincerely hope the bus ads will elicit a response from the Mayor and that he will take a leadership role in addressing this problem.</strong>&quot; Deputy Mayor Linda Gibbs responded to the criticism, &#x201C;While we&#x2019;ve seen real progress over the years, these numbers are still unacceptably high and we have more to do.&quot; </p>

<p>We wonder if the Chiaroscuro Foundation knew they could have saved some money by investing in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141220232302/http://gothamist.com/2010/12/11/pro-life_say_it_with_a_license_plat.php">Choose Life</a> license plates. But while we wait for Mayor Bloomberg&apos;s response to the ads, at least we can read all about Justin Bieber&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141220232302/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/16/justin_bieber_gives_his_two_cents_o.php">opinion on abortion.</a></p>
