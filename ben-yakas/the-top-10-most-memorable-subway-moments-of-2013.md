<p>People may never learn to hold their phones sideways, but that hasn&apos;t stopped anyone from capturing photos and videos of NYC&apos;s finest subway moments. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510022120/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/28/the_top_10_biggest_subway_videos_of.php">Just like last year</a>, bystanders continued to seize at any opportunity for the brief high of viral fame. But there were also spontaneous sax battles, death-defying ollies, and two little kitties who influenced a mayoral race. Click through to see the top ten subway moments the MTA would probably rather you forgot about. And check back for more of our favorite subway moments from 2013 over the next week.</p>

<p><strong>Subway Kittens</strong>: It would have been notable enough if  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510022120/http://gothamist.com/tags/subwaykittens">little August and Arthur just brought transit to a standstill</a> when they were spotted frolicking on the subway tracks before Labor Day Weekend.

They also inspired the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510022120/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/31/joe_lhota_would_have_let_subway_kit.php">greatest series of attack ads in the history of NYC.</a></p>

<p><strong>Subway Shark</strong>: A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510022120/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/07/photos_dead_shark_on_subway.php#photo-1">dead shark on the N train</a> transfixed a languid city during a slow summer. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510022120/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/07/weekend_at_bernies_subway_shark.php#photo-1">Funny/insensitive photos</a> were taken with the shark, the Taiwanese animation team <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510022120/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/08/video_taiwanese_animators_create_am.php">immortalized it in a short film</a>, and eventually, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510022120/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/08/sources_dead_shark_on_subway_came_fr.php#photo-1">we learned how it ended up there.</a></p>

<p><strong>Subway Station Selfies</strong>: How long do you think it would take for you to travel to every subway station in Manhattan? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510022120/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/12/photos_young_couple_takes_selfies_a.php#photo-1">College students James Doernberg and Kai Jordan found an answer to that question</a> when they travelled to all 118 subway stations in Manhattan... to take selfies.</p>

<p><strong>Strangers Sleeping On Each Other</strong>: The strangest trend to break out of real life and onto social media was the debate over people sleeping on top of each other on the subway. An Orthodox Jew who let a stranger rest his head on him <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510022120/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/06/photo_stranger_asleep_on_orthodox_m.php">inspired the internet</a>, then other people <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510022120/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/14/video_more_straphangers_inspired_to.php">started copying it</a>&#x2014;even Darth Vader <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510022120/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/03/photo_darth_vader_takes_the_subway.php">got in on it</a>.

<p><strong>Thanking Subway Conductors</strong>: MTA Conductors are required to point at the black and white striped boards you see at every station&#x2014;so some New Yorkers decided to thank them by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510022120/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/30/feel_good_video_straphangers_make_s.php">standing below the boards with funny signs.</a></p>

<p><strong>Spontaneous Sax Battle</strong>: You don&apos;t see a saxophonist on the train everyday&#x2014;and you certainly don&apos;t see <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510022120/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/01/video_the_most_epic_or_staged_subwa.php">epic sax <em>battles</em>.</a></p>
