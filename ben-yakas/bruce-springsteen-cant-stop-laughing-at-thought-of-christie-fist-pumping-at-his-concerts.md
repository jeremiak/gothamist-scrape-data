<p>It was bad enough when <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170626124229/http://gothamist.com/tags/chrischristie">NJ Gov. Chris Christie</a> threw whatever goodwill he had overboard by endorsing WWE Hall Of Famer Donald Trump for president. It is worse that he has spent the better part of the last eight months acting as his dead-eyed surrogate, alongside the former Rudy Giuliani, making the pair Trump&apos;s very own Rosencrantz and Guildenstern (or Bebop and Rocksteady). His <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170626124229/http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2016/09/christies_approval_rating_at_all-time_low_as_bridg.html">approval ratings</a> in NJ hit historic lows last month as the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170626124229/http://gothamist.com/tags/bridgegate">Bridgegate</a> trial started up, and accusations that he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170626124229/http://gothamist.com/2016/09/19/christie_bridgegate_knowledge.php">knew about the scandal as it was happening</a> are not going to help his reputation.</p>

<p>This year couldn&apos;t possible get worse for him, right? It would take something totally psychologically devastating to bring him any lower, like when <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170626124229/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Tenorman_Must_Die">Scott Tenorman&apos;s favorite band, Radiohead</a>, made fun of him for crying (after learning his parents were dead and he had just eaten them). </p>

<p>Last April, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170626124229/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/26/christie_demon-free_3_hours.php">we spotted Christie</a> at Barclays Center fist-pumping the demons away to his favorite artist, Bruce Springsteen and the E-Street Band. He played air drums to &quot;The Ties That Bind,&quot; he mimicked air guitar to &quot;Sherry Darling,&quot; he banged his head to &quot;Out In The Street,&quot; and he waved his magic fingers to &quot;Born To Run,&quot; as you can see in the video below.</p>

<p>And this is why you should never have heroes. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170626124229/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/bruce-springsteen-goes-deep-on-revelations-in-new-memoir-w443387">Rolling Stone writes:</a></p>

<blockquote>In a sunny sitting room where windows overlook the green sprawl of his property, Springsteen discusses the genesis of the book, his struggles with depression, the future of his career and much more, staying silent on only one topic. When I mention my horror at the sight of Donald Trump-endorsing New Jersey governor Chris Christie pumping his fist and singing along to the lines &quot;poor man wanna be rich, rich man wanna be king&quot; at a recent concert in Brooklyn, Springsteen laughs until he turns red. When he catches his breath, he says, &quot;I have no comment.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>Is this worse or just as bad as that time Springsteen <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170626124229/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/15/video_bruce_springsteen_jimmy_fallo.php">made fun of Christie and Bridgegate on national television</a>? Let&apos;s call it a draw. </p>

<p>If he weren&apos;t such an unrepetent bully who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170626124229/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/26/chris_christie_makes_america_great.php">sold his soul</a> for a potential cabinet position in the government of the Orange Devil, we&apos;d really feel bad for the guy at this point. He clearly needs those therapeutic Springsteen shows to let off some steam&#x2014;considering how he is now, imagine what he&apos;d be like <em>without</em> them.</p>
