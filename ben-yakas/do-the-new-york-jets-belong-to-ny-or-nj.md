<p>Possessiveness is generally not an attractive quality in any relationship, but it&apos;s especially true when it comes to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160919120011/http://gothamist.com/tags/jets">Jets</a>, whose zany antics, trash talking and underdog persona have captured the hearts of the entire <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160919120011/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/19/can_connecticut_be_part_of_new_engl.php">Tri-State Area</a> over the past two seasons. But Mayor Bloomberg and NJ Gov. Chris Christie got into a catfight yesterday over which state is the true home of the team&#x2014;and this is one argument that can&apos;t be solved with a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160919120011/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0habxsuXW4g ">Mariah Carey song.</a> </p>

<p>Gov. Christie got things <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160919120011/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2011/01/20/2011-01-20_mayors_bloomberg_chris_christie_engage_in_a_border_war_or_word_over_true_home_of.html">started yesterday</a> when he argued that the Jets, whose stadium and facilities are all located in NJ, belong to NY in name only. &quot;<strong>Today when they&apos;re practicing, where are they practicing? New Jersey. And when they play their homes games, where do they play? New Jersey. And where do most of their players live? In New Jersey.</strong>&quot; Bloomberg responded later in the day with his own version of a history lesson, reminding people that the Jets first played at the Polo Grounds in upper Manhattan, then at Shea Stadium in Flushing. &quot;<strong>We can all root for the Jets, but they don&apos;t call him Turnpike Joe,</strong>&quot; he said, referring to Jets legend &quot;Broadway&quot; Joe Namath. </p>

<p>The Jets are even getting two very different kinds of rallies across the Hudson: there&apos;s a pep rally <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160919120011/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/20/j-e-t-s_rally_rally_rally.php">this afternoon</a> in Times Square with giveaways galore, hosted by Bloomberg, Jets owner Woody Johnson, and a handful of Jets players. Then on Saturday, there will be a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160919120011/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/jets_fans_set_afc_form_human_tunnel_eM9LaCzWLOFHVpOHd0L0CK?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">NJ pep rally</a> at the teams Florham Park practice facility; officials expect between 4,000 and 5,000 fans will show up to form a human tunnel to send the team off ton their journey to Pittsburgh. Coach Rex Ryan, who has been on his best behavior this week, tried to play peacemaker, saying, &quot;There&apos;s enough of the Jets to go around.&quot;</p>

<p>There&apos;s also enough Ryan love to go around, both literally and figuratively. The loudmouth, rotund Coach has gone from lovable <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160919120011/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/13/jets_get_ready_to_lead_the_league_i.php">drill sergeant</a> to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160919120011/http://gothamist.com/2010/12/23/ryan_jets_dont_fumble_foot_fetish_f.php">distraction</a> to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160919120011/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/16/jets_de-feet_pats.php">savior</a> as the season has progressed. After Sunday&apos;s commanding defeat of the Patriots, he&apos;s been given more and more credit, even from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160919120011/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/19/jets_and_steelers_very_respectfully.php">Giants players</a>. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160919120011/http://gothamist.com/2010/10/10/jet_cromartie_has_one_more_kid_than.php">Virile</a> cornerback Antonio Cromartie <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160919120011/http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/football/jets/2011/01/20/2011-01-20_cromartie_sorry_giants_rex_is_our_guy.html">gets it</a> completely: &quot;I am not surprised. It&apos;s just the kind of guy Rex is and how he carries himself. Who wouldn&apos;t want to play for him? ...Everyone sees how Rex is and how he loves to have fun, he loves to come out and joke around. At the same time, he&apos;s a business person, too. When it&apos;s time for work he works. We all try to make sure everyone here enjoys himself, too. <strong>This is the most fun I done had in the five years of my career.&quot;</strong></p>
