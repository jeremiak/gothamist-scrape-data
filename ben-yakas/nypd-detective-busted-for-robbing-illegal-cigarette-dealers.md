Bronx Detective Kyron Collins, who works in the 52nd precinct, was charged along with two other defendants for robbing &quot;individuals dealing in contraband cigarettes, and other commodities in interstate commerce, at various locations in Manhattan and the Bronx,&quot; since October 2010. Perhaps he was thinking of passing it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141108000356/http://gothamist.com/2010/11/13/rikers_guard_caught_sneaking_contra.php">along the chain</a>?<p></p>

<p>Collins, along wit defendants Ammar Alkamel and Juan Carlos Arvelo, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141108000356/http://www.wpix.com/news/wpix-nypd-officer-arrested-robbery,0,5489358.story">is alleged to have</a> used a gun, a knife and even fake search warrants, along with his NYPD shield, to commit the robberies. During one robbery on July 26th, officials say Collins stole $7,000 from a victim&apos;s mattress while tearing the place apart with his knife. Collins, a 16-year-veteran of the NYPD, was captured on surveillance video during that incident, and has been charged with conspiracy and robbery. </p>
