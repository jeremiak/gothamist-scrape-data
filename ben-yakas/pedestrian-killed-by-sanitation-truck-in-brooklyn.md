The victim, a black male in his 60s, was hit by a private sanitation truck as he was crossing the street around 7 a.m. The victim was pronounced DOA on the scene, but the truck operator, an employee of Yankel&apos;s Demolition and Rubbish Removal, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130307054034/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2011/03/18/2011-03-18_pedestrian_struck_and_killed_by_garbage_truck_in_brooklyn.html">wasn&apos;t arrested</a> and hasn&apos;t been charged. <p></p>

<p>A tipster wrote us: &quot;The police secured the scene but everyone who walked passed (including myself) witnessed a dead body and brains scattered all over the street. It was a gruesome scene.&quot; Another tipster added some different details, and erroneously identified the sanitation truck as city-owned: &quot;One or both parties of an elderly couple was hit and killed by city garbage truck 7 am under Myrtle/Bway J in Bushwick. Bodies were still in the street at 845 this morning.&quot;</p>
