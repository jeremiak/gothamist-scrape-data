<p>The days of hedonistic party buses filled with boozed-up teens on pleather-seat highs may be coming to an end: lawmakers in Albany want to pass a law requiring chaperones for underage <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509134111/http://gothamist.com/tags/partybus">party buses</a>. Perhaps <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509134111/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/26/video_dmx_crashes_nyers_wedding_par.php">noted party bus crasher</a> DMX could be the first volunteer for the program.</p>

<p>Sen. Jeff Klein, who previously led the charge to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509134111/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/28/new_four_loko_not_good_enough_for_s.php">neuter Four Loko</a>, proposed the bill, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509134111/http://nypost.com/2014/06/01/bill-aims-to-stop-underage-booze-party-buses/">which would require</a> one adult chaperone for every 20 passengers under the age of 21. For double-decker buses, there would need to be one chaperone per floor. </p>

<p>The bill comes after several high profile tragic incidents involving these party buses: this past April, a party bus driver was charged with child endangerment after he drove a group of drunken Long Island high school students to the Hamptons. In 2012, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509134111/http://gothamist.com/2012/09/01/freak_partybus_accident_nj_teen_kil.php">a 16-year-old was killed</a> after he stuck his head out of the roof of a double-decker party bus and slammed into the underside of an overpass on I-95. </p>

<p>Now the question is whether Klein can mandate chaperones for adults who use party buses, since they seem to need some supervising as well:</p>
