<p>Last week, on the eve of his massive ten-date residency at Radio City Music Hall, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140627051332/http://gothamist.com/tags/davechappelle">Dave Chappelle</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140627051332/http://gothamist.com/2014/06/14/video_dave_chappelle_tells_a_very_d.php">told a charming story</a> about the first time he met <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140627051332/http://gothamist.com/tags/kanyewest">Kanye West</a> (which was also his first performance on TV), and witnessed the birth of the Kanye we all know and (mostly) love. The two are still friends, and West returned the favor last night when he performed a surprise three-song set of &quot;New Slaves,&quot; &quot;Jesus Walks&quot; and &quot;Gold Digger.&quot;</p>

<p>Even though no phones or cameras (or heckling or &quot;yelling out anything&quot;) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140627051332/http://instagram.com/p/pZ7UFiMg0l/">were technically allowed</a>, people somehow figured out a way around that (by not following the rules!) and captured most of the set, which you can see in the videos. There will be more musical guests at his upcoming shows, including Nas, The Roots, Busta Rhymes, DJ Premier, Janelle Mon&#xE1;e, and Erykah Badu.</p>
