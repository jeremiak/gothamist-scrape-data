<p>A 63-year-old man says that he was attacked on the subway this week because of his race.</p>

<p>Police say that Won Yi got aboard a Manhattan-bound F train around 9:20 a.m. on Tuesday before the incident happened. Yi fell asleep during the ride. The suspect got onto the train at Jay Street and sat next to him, asking why he was sleeping.</p>

<p>As the train was nearing the Bryant Park-42nd St. Station, the suspect asked him, &quot;Why don&#x2019;t you go back to your own country?&quot; When the train pulled into the station, the suspect spit on Yi and punched him numerous times in his face, head, neck and shoulder before fleeing the scene. Yi suffered bleeding to the left side of his mouth, swelling and pain to the left side of his face, and shoulder pain. </p>

<p>The victim has been described as a clean shaven man in his 30s, 5&apos;10&quot;, around 175 pounds, and was last seen wearing a black wool cap, blue jacket, blue jeans and black sneakers.</p>

<p>Police add that no arrests have been made, and the investigation is ongoing.<br>
