<p>A 69-year-old woman has been put into a medically-induced coma after she was brutally beaten on the L train this month. Police say that victim Gladys Castro was attacked on a Manhattan-bound L train near the E. 105th Street stop in Canarsie about 9:50 p.m. on May 21st. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140601042221/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/attack-train-leaves-69-year-old-woman-coma-article-1.1809267">According to the News</a>, she was attacked by 28-year-old Dhamma Etomi, who has been charged with attempted murder and assault.</p>

<p>The News claims the attack was seemingly random: &quot;She screamed for help before the suspect knocked her out, a complaint against Etomi stated. At one point, Etomi unzipped his pants and knelt down in front of Castro&#x2019;s face.&quot; Castro suffered bleeding in her brain, prompting doctors to put her into the coma. Her family told them she is &quot;not doing well&quot; at Brookdale University Hospital.</p>

<p>Etomi has been sent to undergo a psychiatric evaluation. He was previously charged with assault as a hate crime after he confessed to beating a man with a cane in a Manhattan homeless shelter bathroom in 2012 because he thought the man was gay. He was released from jail in November 2013, and placed into a mental hospital.</p>
