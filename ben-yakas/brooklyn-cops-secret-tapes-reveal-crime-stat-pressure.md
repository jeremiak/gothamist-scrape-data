										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="5510cops.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150804142336im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/5510cops.jpg" width="215" height="129" class="image-left"> </span>Earlier this year, Officer Adrian Schoolcraft pulled a Serpico, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150804142336/http://gothamist.com/2010/02/02/cops_comes_forward_says_crime_stati.php">accusing</a> the NYPD of under-reporting and refusing to investigate crimes in order to keep crime statistics down (a claim for which he received an unwilling psychiatric evaluation). Today, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150804142336/http://www.villagevoice.com/2010-05-04/news/the-nypd-tapes-inside-bed-stuy-s-81st-precinct/1">Village Voice revealed</a> that Schoolcraft sought to back up those claims by secretly carrying a digital recorder around his precinct for more than a year, logging hundreds of hours of conversations, and giving the public an insider&apos;s perspective on the management and pressures of an NYPD precinct.</p>

<p>The recordings, made between June 1, 2008, and October 31, 2009, in the 81st Precinct in Bedford-Stuyvesant, reveal a schism in the world of policing: &quot;The rank-and-file NYPD street cop experiences enormous pressure in a strange catch-22: He or she is expected to maintain high &apos;activity&apos;&#x2014;including stop-and-frisks&#x2014;but, paradoxically, to record fewer actual crimes.&quot; The report in the Voice includes several specific examples of ways in which law enforcement finagle the stats:</p>

<ul><li>During a September 12, 2009, roll call, a fellow cop tells Schoolcraft: &quot;A lot of 61s&#x2014;if it&apos;s a robbery, they&apos;ll make it a petty larceny. I saw a 61, at T/P/O [time and place of occurrence], a civilian punched in the face, menaced with a gun, and his wallet was removed, and they wrote &apos;lost property.&apos; &quot;
</li><li>On June 12, 2008, Lieutenant B. relayed the summons target: &quot;The XO [second-in-command] was in the other day. He actually laid down a number. He wants at least three seat belts, one cell phone, and 11 others. All right, so if I was on patrol, I would be sure to get three seat belts, one cell phone, and 11 others.&quot;
</li><li>The NYPD claims that downgrading happens only rarely, but in the course of reporting this story, the Voice was told of burglaries rejected if the victim didn&apos;t have receipts for the items stolen, of felony thefts turned into misdemeanor thefts by lowballing the value of the property, of robberies turned into assaults, of assaults turned into harassments.</li></ul>
