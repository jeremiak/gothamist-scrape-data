<p>After a pleasantly warm preview of spring two weeks ago, we&apos;ve been knocked back to reality with a spate of bipolar, rainy <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150815021617/http://gothamist.com/tags/weather">weather</a>, which included <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150815021617/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/31/reminder_snow_tomorrow.php">whatever that was</a> we got at the end of last week. Now, we should probably expect lots of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150815021617/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWWVGyxvSCk">April showers</a> before we get to those darn May flowers. But are you prepared for the rain? Or more specifically: are you prepared to talk about the rain?</p>

<p>The Times had a wonderful little <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150815021617/http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2011/04/03/opinion/20110403_schott.html">op-column</a> this weekend called &quot;Pluviocabulary&quot;, which means &quot;rainy words.&quot; They write that the &quot;variety of wet weather with which spring confronts us would test even an Eskimo&#x2019;s powers of description.&quot; So they made a list of over 140 words taken from the Oxford English Dictionary to help you discuss the precipitation. They hit everything from the well-known (&quot;cats and dogs&quot;, to rain heavily) to the obscure (&quot;blirt,&quot; a gust of wind and rain) and the poetic (&quot;impearl,&quot; rain that leaves pearlescent drops). Before you check the column out, what are your favorite precipitation words?</p>
