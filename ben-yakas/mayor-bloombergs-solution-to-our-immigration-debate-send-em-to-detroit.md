										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:250px; "> <img alt="5111bloom.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406145710im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/5111bloom.jpg" width="250" height="376"> <br> <i>AP</i></div> Mayor Bloomberg was on <em>Meet the Press</em> this morning, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406145710/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2011/05/01/2011-05-01_mayor_bloomberg_has_solution_to_immigration_problem_make_them_live_in_detroit.html">and proposed</a> a unique solution to the nation&apos;s ongoing immigration debate: let immigrants come...but <em>make</em> them live in Detroit. &quot;If I were the federal government, assuming we could wave a magic wand and pull everybody together, you pass a law letting immigrants come in as long as they agree to go to Detroit and live there for five to 10 years, start businesses, take jobs or whatever,&quot; he said. Kill two birds with one implausible policy!<p></p>

<p>He explained <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406145710/http://www.politico.com/blogs/politicolive/0511/Bloomy_Let_immigrants_in_to_Detroit.html">further</a>: &quot;You would populate Detroit over night because half the world wants to come here...You can use something like immigration policy - at no cost to the federal government - to fix a lot of the problems that we have.&quot; In the past, Mayor Bloomberg has used Detroit as a negative case study <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406145710/http://gothamist.com/2010/01/22/bloomberg_checkmates_obama_with_his.php">to argue against</a> President Obama&apos;s plan to add new taxes to banks. In the clip below from 2009, he described Detroit as &quot;holding on for dear life:&quot;</p>

<p>But the spokeswoman for the mayor of Detroit said they didn&apos;t appreciate his &quot;advice&quot; so much: &quot;Detroit is everyone&apos;s case study. Everybody has an idea or solution for Detroit but it&apos;s a lot of Monday morning quarterbacking and back-seat driving.&quot; However, she added, &quot;Certainly, we do have room for additional citizens.&quot; Well in that case, why didn&apos;t Bloomberg suggest we just ship <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406145710/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/11/state_of_the_homeless_not_good.php">our homeless</a> out there too! </p>
