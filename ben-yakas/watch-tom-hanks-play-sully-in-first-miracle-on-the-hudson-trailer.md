<p>On January 15th, 2009, a US Airways flight <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031013225/http://gothamist.com/2009/01/15/plane_crash_in_hudson.php">splash-crashed</a> into the icy Hudson River after  the plane suffered a bird strike, disabling its engines. Somehow, no one died and all 155 passengers and crew members escaped the sinking plane, thanks largely to the quick thinking of pilot Captain Chesley Sullenberger. </p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031013225/http://gothamist.com/tags/miracleonthehudson">&quot;Miracle On The Hudson,&quot;</a> as it was dubbed, and the heroic pilot at its center are now the subject of a new Clint Eastwood movie starring America&apos;s Sweetheart, Tom Hanks, as the titular character. If you really liked the movie <em>Flight</em> but wish it took place in NYC and had fewer stakes, then this is the movie for YOU.</p>

<p>Here&apos;s the official description of the movie, which is grasping at dramatic straws to draw some plot out of Sully&apos;s post-Miracle stardom: &quot;On January 15, 2009, the world witnessed the &apos;Miracle on the Hudson&apos; when Captain &apos;Sully&apos; Sullenberger glided his disabled plane onto the frigid waters of the Hudson River, saving the lives of all 155 aboard. However, even as Sully was being heralded by the public and the media for his unprecedented feat of aviation skill, an investigation was unfolding that threatened to destroy his reputation and his career.&quot; </p>

<p>For what it&apos;s worth, last night I sifted through Sully&apos;s Wikipedia pages and various interviews to find something damning, and...I did not find much that would lead me to believe Sully&apos;s reputation was ever in danger, especially not in the immediate aftermath of the crash when he was making appearances every other day at various morning talk shows.</p>

<p>Late-period Eastwood has had a lot more misses (<em>Jersey Boys</em>, <em>Hereafter</em>) than hits, especially when he&apos;s drawn stories from real life events (<em>J Edgar</em>, the hot garbage can fire that was <em>American Sniper</em>), so we&apos;re more cautious than cautiously optimistic about this project. Will this film be more concerned with the fragility of aging and memory than aviation conspiracy theories? Or will the Liberal Media be the villain of the third act?</p>
