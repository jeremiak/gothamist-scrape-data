<p>On Friday and Saturday, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428143013/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/01/electric_zoos_last_day_cancelled_du.php">two people died and four were hospitalized</a> due to Ecstasy-related illnesses at the Electric Zoo electronic music festival on Randall&apos;s Island. The deaths of Olivia Rotondo, 20, a University of New Hampshire junior from North Providence, RI, and Jeffery Russ, 23, a Syracuse University graduate from Rochester, ultimately prompting officials to cancel the third day of the event. Both died of an overdose from MDMA, more specifically molly, a more concentrated form of the drug. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428143013/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/agony_of_ecstasy_at_killer_nyc_rave_GzuQPIxiKrQg5PNLHFq7AM">The Post reports that</a> on Saturday Rotondo told an EMS worker, &#x201C;I just took six hits of Molly,&#x2019;&#x2019; before collapsing in a seizure and dying.</p>

<p>Hours before her death, Rotondo tweeted her excitement about attending the fifth annual Electric Zoo: &#x201C;The amount of traveling I&#x2019;ve done today is unreal. Just get me to the damn zoo.&quot; &#x201C;She was the nicest girl I&#x2019;ve ever had the pleasure of knowing,&#x201D; Noah Burkholz, a friend who had traveled to the festival with her, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428143013/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/02/nyregion/electric-zoo-music-festival-is-canceled-after-2-deaths.html?_r=0">told the Times.</a> Her grandfather Henry Rotondo, 73, told the Post, &#x201C;She was a great kid &#x2014; that&#x2019;s all I can tell you.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Police do not believe that Rotondo and Russ knew each other. Russ, who died early Saturday morning, graduated from Syracuse University last year with a degree in information technology. &#x201C;Now there will be no grandchildren, no nieces, no nephews, no wedding,&#x201D; Russ&#x2019; father, John Russ, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428143013/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/queens/city-cancells-final-day-electric-zoo-dance-music-fest-deaths-concergoers-article-1.1442839">told the Daily News</a>. &#x201C;Everything you look forward to in life is gone because of one pill.&#x201D; </p>

<p>Police say that the four concertgoers who also became critically ill due to drug use are expected to recover. In addition to all that, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428143013/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/02/16-year-old_sexually_assaulted_31_a.php">a 16-year-old girl was sexually assaulted and 31 people were arrested</a> for offenses including drug sales, disorderly conduct, resisting arrest and possession of controlled substances. Many criticized the lax security and the lack of medical staff; one concertgoer told us that it took several hours to get Russ from the festival to the hospital. &#x201C;You saw a lot of people puking and collapsing down and laying on the ground,&#x201D; 19-year-old Christopher Stuebbe told the Times.</p>

<p>While some <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428143013/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/01/ravers_lash_out_on_twitter_over_ele.php">lashed out at Bloomberg and organizers</a> for canceling events on Sunday, others defended the culture of the event. &quot;I don&apos;t think EDM culture promotes drug use at all.  Young people are experimental by nature because they have no sense of their own mortality,&quot; Leslie Doyle, who has attended Electric Zoo festivals over the years and planned to go on Sunday, wrote us. &quot;Acts of violence would be a good reason to shut down a music festival, there was none of that!  This administration reacted to 6 people who made unfortunate personal choices. Their decision to shut down EZoo has tarnished the experience for the collective group of tens of thousands.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;EZoo officials go to great lengths to make this an Eco friendly event, and the DJs make announcements advising people to take care of themselves,&quot; she added. &quot;There will always be a few people that lose control. Shutting down Zoo is one more example of the Bloomberg Administration&apos;s nannyism. When people die of alcohol poisoning, are they going to shut down the restaurants and bars who serve them?&quot;</p>
