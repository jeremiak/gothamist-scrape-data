<p>The Republican mayoral primary is getting increasingly bitchy, with candidates Joe Lhota and John <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502160703/https://twitter.com/hunterw/status/370546489912602624">&quot;JOBS CATS&quot;</a> Catsimatidis trading attack ads this week. Catsimatidis got things started <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502160703/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnVJO8zJJII">with a particularly nasty ad</a> going after Lhota for raising subway fares and referring to Port Authority officers &quot;mall cops.&quot; Lhota responded in kind with his ace in the hole by unleashing the <strike>Kraken</strike> Giuliani.</p>

<p><iframe width="640" height="480" src="//web.archive.org/web/20150502160703if_/http://www.youtube.com/embed/ySuo3bsCNAc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>This isn&apos;t the first time that NYC&apos;s favorite <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502160703/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/19/rudy_giuliani_now_an_identity_theft.php">identity theft pitchman</a> has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502160703/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/06/video_rudy_giuliani_911_joe_lhota_9.php">stumped for Lhota</a>, who was a top aide during former Mayor Giuliani&apos;s administration. But Lhota <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502160703/http://politicker.com/2013/08/joe-lhota-pitches-himself-as-the-public-safety-candidate-in-bay-ridge/">confirmed this week that</a> Giuliani will be joining him more frequently on the campaign trail over the next few weeks gearing up for the primary.</p>

<p>So with Giuliani in the mix, you can expect things will only get nastier before then. We do think he deserves special kudos for somehow getting through this :31 second ad without mentioning 9/11 (something he was unable to do in his last pro-Lhota video). But Lhota really should take Robert Downey Jr.&apos;s advice to heart: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502160703/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAKG-kbKeIo">&quot;Never go full Giuliani.&quot;</a> </p>
