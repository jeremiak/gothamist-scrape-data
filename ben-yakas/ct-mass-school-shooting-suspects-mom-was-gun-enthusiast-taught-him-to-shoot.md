<p>There has been a lot of updated information released today about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160604135152/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/14/breaking_multiple_people_injured_in.php">yesterday&apos;s horrific Connecticut elementary school shooting</a>, which left 28 people dead altogether, including 20 children. It seems that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160604135152/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/14/photos_videos_what_we_know_about_al.php">alleged shooter Adam Lanza</a>, 20, had NOT been buzzed into Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160604135152/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/15/heroic_teachers_and_staff_protected.php">was first reported</a>: &#x201C;He was not voluntarily let into the school at all,&#x201D; Connecticut State Police Lt. Paul Vance <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160604135152/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/connecticut_victims_shooter_motives_dM0QIY1PQjY7PxV1pebrJK?utm_source=SFnewyorkpost&amp;utm_medium=SFnewyorkpost">said during a press conference</a>. &#x201C;He forced his way into the school.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Vance also announced that investigators have uncovered &#x201C;very good evidence,&#x201D; that will be able to &#x201C;paint the how, and more importantly, the why&#x201D; this horrific incident happened. He stressed that it would take a few more days before they could let the media know what that evidence is, though. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160604135152/http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/12/15/15926718-newtown-gunman-tried-to-buy-rifle-days-before-shooting?lite">NBC&apos;s Pete Williams claims that</a> officials are investigating whether Lanza is the person who had an &quot;altercation&quot; with four staff members at the school on Thursday. Three of the four were killed during the incident; it&apos;s unclear whether the fourth was not at school that day, or if they were the teacher who was shot in the foot while holding a door closed during the shooting spree. Vance noted that teacher, whose name hasn&apos;t been released yet, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160604135152/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/16/nyregion/gunman-kills-20-children-at-school-in-connecticut-28-dead-in-all.html?hp">would be &quot;instrumental&quot;</a> in figuring out what happened Friday morning.</p>

<p>It&apos;s also been revealed that Nancy Lanza&#x2014;Adam Lanza&apos;s mother who he killed in their Newtown home before driving to the school&#x2014;was not a teacher or substitute at Sandy Hook, also contradicting earlier reports. Janet Robinson, the school&apos;s superintendent, did not elaborate upon whether she had any other connections to the school. After fatally shooting his mother in the face, investigators say he took three of his mother&apos;s legally-owned weapons that he used in the assault, including a Glock, a SIG Sauer, and a .223-caliber Bushmaster rifle. In addition to those three weapons, cops also recovered a .45-caliber Henry repeating rifle, a .22-caliber Marlin rifle, and a .30-caliber Enfield rifle, a law enforcement source told CNN. &quot;We&apos;re investigating the history of each and every weapon and we will know every single thing about those weapons,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160604135152/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/conn-gunman-learned-shoot-mom-article-1.1220893">Vance noted.</a></p>

<p>&#x201C;They went target shooting as a family,&#x201D; Holmes <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160604135152/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/conn-gunman-learned-shoot-mom-article-1.1220893">also told The Daily News</a>. &#x201C;That was a passion. The whole family would go together.&#x201D; It&apos;s unclear where those other three weapons came from, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160604135152/http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/12/15/15926718-newtown-gunman-tried-to-buy-rifle-days-before-shooting?lite">but NBC reports that</a> Lanza went to a Dick&apos;s Sporting Goods store in Danbury on Tuesday to buy a rifle, but was turned down because he didn&apos;t want to undergo a background check or abide by the state&apos;s waiting period for gun sales.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160604135152/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/victims_found_horrific_connecticut_jNTUicqZejDtIdc6G24mUJ?utm_source=SFnewyorkpost&amp;utm_medium=SFnewyorkpost">According to the Post</a>, Nancy Lanza was a gun enthusiast who often took her son shooting with her. &#x201C;She&apos;d take them to the range a lot&#x2026;Nancy was an enthusiast&#x2014;so much so that she wanted to pass it on to her kids,&#x201D; said her former landscaper and &quot;occasional drinking buddy&quot; Dan Holmes. &#x201C;She took her two sons to the gun ranges quite a bit to practice their aim. She was a really great shot from what she told me. Whenever I finished work and went inside to chit chat, she spoke often about her fascination with firearms. Nancy had an extensive gun collection and she was really quite proud of it.&#x201D;</p>
