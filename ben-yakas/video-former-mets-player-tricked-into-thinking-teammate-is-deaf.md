<p>Jeff Francoeur only played for the Mets for parts of two seasons from 2009-2010, but he entered the history books when he became the second player in major league history to hit into a game-ending unassisted triple play. Oh, and he struck out a whole lot and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428180628/http://bleacherreport.com/articles/582161-jeff-franceour-to-new-york-mets-citi-field-is-a-damn-joke">bad-mouthed Citi Field</a> a bit. It may shock you to learn that Francoeur wasn&apos;t the sharpest tool in the shed, as his current teammates on the El Paso Chihuahuas (the San Diego Padres&apos; Triple-A affiliate) proved with a month-long prank during which they convinced him one of his teammates was deaf (he&apos;s not). </p>

<p>Many of the teammates knew Francoeur from previous teams, and they were able to convince him that reliever Jorge Reyes was deaf. Thus began the month-long prank, which was documented by first basemen Cody Decker in the video above. The video ends with Francoeur watching the footage of his teammates affectionately calling him an idiot and learning the lengths they went to keep the joke going (and just how oblivious he was to it). </p>

<p>We thought it was pretty hilarious. And if you start feeling bad for Francoeur, keep in mind he&apos;s made <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428180628/http://hallofverygood.com/2014-articles/jeff-francoeur-is-an-idiot.html">at least $25 million</a> during his nine years in the major leagues.</p>
