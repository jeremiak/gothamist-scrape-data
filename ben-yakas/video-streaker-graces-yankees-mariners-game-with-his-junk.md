<p>As if a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130511040855/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/29/last_nights_action_yankees_fall_in.php">12-inning win</a> wasn&apos;t entertaining enough for fans in Seattle, last night&apos;s Yankees-Mariners game at Safeco park was intruded by four fans who ran onto the field throughout the night. That included one particularly jubilant streaker <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130511040855/http://blog.seattlepi.com/baseball/2011/05/29/fans-lose-their-cool-mariners-maintain-theirs-in-extra-inning-win/">who ran toward</a> Derek Jeter in the middle of the 8th inning.

According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130511040855/http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/reader_feedback/public/display.php?source_name=mbase&amp;source_id=2015177076">one commenter</a> who was at the game: &quot;The craziest thing to me is that all 4 guys were buddies, who were sitting in front of us for the first couple of innings... I have to assume they made some drunk pact to make fools of themselves. There were 5 of them, though... Wonder if the last chickened out?!&quot;</p>

<p>From what KIRO FM News Desk <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130511040855/http://twitter.com/#!/kironewsdesk/status/74897889960267778">tweeted</a>, maybe the fifth guy figured out it wasn&apos;t worth his <strike>dignity</strike> wallet: &quot;Streaker at SAFECO was challenged by buddies to do it for $400 bucks. He now will need another $100 to pay the $500 fine.&quot; It&apos;s too bad the streaker didn&apos;t have some <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130511040855/http://blogs.houstonpress.com/hairballs/2011/05/astro_fan_on-field_escape_a_cr.php">parkour skills</a>.</p>
