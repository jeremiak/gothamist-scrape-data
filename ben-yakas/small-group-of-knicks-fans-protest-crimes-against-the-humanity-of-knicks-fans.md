<p>Despite a seven-game winning streak and the coronation of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506172311/http://gothamist.com/tags/philjackson">Phil Jackson</a> as President of Saving The Knicks Organization From Itself, a group of frustrated <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506172311/http://gothamist.com/tags/knicks">Knicks</a> fans <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506172311/http://gothamist.com/2014/03/05/fans_to_protest_knicks_over_crimes.php">went ahead with their planned protest</a> of the team outside of MSG yesterday. Because of Phil, they had to change their strategy slightly from &quot;stop abusing the Knicks, James Dolan&quot; to &quot;let Phil do his job.&quot; You can see how that turned out below.</p>

<p>Approximately 35-45 furious fans showed up for the weary rally (along with a bunch of media people and gawkers), which was a far cry from the 100-500 people organizers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506172311/http://nypost.com/2014/03/17/knicks-fans-have-new-focus-for-protest-let-phil-do-his-job/">were hoping would attend.</a> &quot;I&#x2019;m happy about Phil [Jackson] being brought in [as president], but I want to show James Dolan that we&apos;re still going to hold him accountable, hold his feet to the fire as an owner and we want him to allow Phil to do his thing. That&apos;s why I&apos;m here, to support my Knicks and fellow Knicks fans,&#x201D; Knicks fan Nkosi DuBois Anderson <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506172311/http://espn.go.com/blog/new-york/knicks/post/_/id/55117/fans-protest-dolan-cheer-phil?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter">told ESPN.</a></p>

<p>As Poasting and Toasting scribe <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506172311/http://www.sbnation.com/nba/2014/3/20/5528398/knicks-protest-msg-new-york">Seth Rosenthal reported</a>, the chants went nowhere and there was seemingly little reason for the event&#x2014;besides the sweet merchandise: &quot;The shirts and a few signs were pretty much the extent of the expression, though.&quot; Deadspin adds that the rally was also drowned out in part <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506172311/http://deadspin.com/about-40-fed-up-knicks-fans-showed-up-for-tonights-pro-1547719407">by a drumline.</a></p>

<p>The Knicks ended up beating the Indiana Pacers, the team with the best record in the Eastern Conference, 92-86, and are still in pursuit of the eighth playoff seed (and a potential first round matchup against the Pacers, who they lost to in the playoffs last year). While the Knicks are seemingly poised to end this disastrous season in much better form than it started, let&apos;s not forget why all these frustrations happened in the first place:</p>
