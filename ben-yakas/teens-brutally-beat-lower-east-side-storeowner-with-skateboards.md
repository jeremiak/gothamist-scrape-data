<p>A Lower East Side store owner was brutally beaten by a group of skateboarders last week. According to police, the four skateboarders entered Eastern Supermarket on Grand Street around 5:30 p.m. Friday. They allegedly tried to steal sodas from a cooler; when 50-year-old store owner Zhen Dan Guo approached them and demanded they pay for the sodas, they beat him with their skateboards. You can see surveillance video of the suspects below.</p>

<p>&#x201C;The bone, it cracked in his nose,&#x201D; Guo&#x2019;s son, Linbin, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503000938/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2013/11/13/skateboarders-attack-lower-east-side-store-owner/">told CBS</a>. Guo was so badly injured in the attack, doctors said he&apos;ll need four titanium plates inserted in his face, and he may be blind in one eye. Linbin is watching over the store in his father&apos;s absence: &#x201C;It really makes me nervous to be here,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;We&#x2019;re open late, and I&#x2019;m afraid more things are going to be happening.&#x201D;</p>
