<p>It was a soft and soggy night in Central Park on Friday for Wilco&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502142141/http://www.brooklynvegan.com/archives/2011/09/wilco_played_ce.html">second night at Summerstage</a>, a fact that was not lost on frontman Jeff Tweedy. He remarked to the drenched, subdued crowd at one point, &quot;You sound wet.&quot; Nevertheless, Rumsey Playfield was nearly filled as fans turned out to see Wilco perform a 24-song set despite the weather. </p>

<p>At this point, Wilco is <em>the</em> preeminent American touring rock band&#x2014;even  though there was a loss of urgency and spark in <em>Sky Blue Sky</em> and <em>Wilco (The Album)</em>, the band could still conjure up some of the old magic on the road, feeding off fans who knew every word to &quot;Hell Is Chrome.&quot; But touring behind their excellent, texture-filled new record <em>The Whole Love</em> seems to have revived the band entirely, and many of the new songs carried that feeling: &quot;Dawned on Me&quot; submerged its lyrics in a biting arrangement, &quot;Art Of Almost&quot; contains the most exciting coda of any Wilco song in nearly a decade, and &quot;One Sunday Morning&quot; is a masterpiece of subtly and attention. </p>

<p>Tweedy called Manhattan &quot;adorbs&quot; at one point&#x2014;the cutesyness of the sentiment seemed to be reflected in the setlist selection, which favored some of Wilco&apos;s brightest, most crowd-friendly tunes. &quot;California Stars,&quot; &quot;Jesus Etc.&quot; and &quot;Heavy Metal Drummer&quot; were all big arena sing-alongs, for better or worse. The highlights of the night included a muscular version of &quot;Red-Eyed And Blue,&quot; an jagged take on &quot;Pot Kettle Black,&quot; the fantastically-sung &quot;Whole Love,&quot; and set closer &quot;I Got You.&quot; It may not have been a &quot;Spiders&quot;-kind of evening, but considering the conditions and the early start time, most fans seemed satisfied leaving the park...and we still got to enjoy all those &quot;nothing&apos;s&quot; in encore opener &quot;Misunderstood.&quot;</p>
