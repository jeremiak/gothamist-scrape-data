title: Even The Mets' Own TV Network Is Openly Mocking Them
---

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="4311mets.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110407190137im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/4311mets.jpg" width="250" height="165" class="image-left"> </span>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110407190137/http://gothamist.com/tags/mets">Mets</a> were understandably itchy to get their 2011 season underway, in the hopes that their on-field accomplishments could knock reports about their financial mess, due to the Madoff &quot;false profits&quot; lawsuit against team owners Jeff and Fred Wilpon, out of the headlines. But though they didn&apos;t exactly roar out of the gate, they probably weren&apos;t expecting their own TV network to mock them on Opening Day&#x2014;but that&apos;s exactly what happened. </p>

<p>After the Mets <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110407190137/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/02/last_nights_action_mets_start_with.php">ugly loss</a> to the Marlins on Friday, a TV technician on SNY played what the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110407190137/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/queens/grand_slam_VPzrztmTaCoSrvGanaYozN">Post calls</a> &quot;an insulting audio clip&quot; from &quot;Family Guy&quot; over shots of the team dejectedly walking off the field, in the middle of the unhappy game recap by the broadcasters. In the clip, Stewie Griffin is upset that he&apos;s not having fun on Halloween, and says the holiday is &quot;a bigger letdown than being a Mets fan.&quot; The scene then cuts to Stewie sitting at a Mets game, as an announcer says, <strong>&quot;It&apos;s Opening Day, and here&apos;s the first pitch...and the season&apos;s over!&quot;</strong> Watch the clip below:</p>

<p>SNY executives were pissed off about the jab: &quot;It was a very poor decision by an employee. The matter is being dealt with internally,&quot; a network spokesman told the Post. We&apos;re sure they were just angry about &quot;Family Guy&apos;s&quot; constant reliance on non-sequitor cutaway gags which have grown stale over multiple seasons. Mets spokesman Jay Horwitz said it was no big deal: &quot;You can&apos;t react to criticism. We&apos;re New York; you have a thick skin.&quot; </p>

<p>That wasn&apos;t the only time &quot;Family Guy&quot; has made fun of the Mets. Here&apos;s another clip:</p>
