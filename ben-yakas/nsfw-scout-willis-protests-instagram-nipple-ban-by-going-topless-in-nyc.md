<p>Thanks to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508230744/http://gothamist.com/tags/topless">tireless &amp; topless efforts</a> of activists, celebrity dads, national organizations, and provocative photographers, you probably know by now that it is as legal for a woman to walk around NYC exposing her breasts as it is for a man to go shirtless. Bruce Willis/Demi Moore progeny <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508230744/http://gothamist.com/tags/scoutwillis">Scout Willis</a> invoked her legal rights to do just that this week in a series of photos protesting Instagram&apos;s censorship policy on female nudity. Check out those NSFW protest pics below. </p>

<p>Willis, who has become something of a nipple Twitter warrior in the past month, was seemingly inspired to take up the cause <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508230744/https://twitter.com/Scout_Willis/status/457309453683916800">in April</a>, after her friend Rihanna got in trouble with Instagram for putting up a magazine photo prominently featuring her pierced nipples&#x2014;Willis is currently using <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508230744/http://www.buzzfeed.com/naomizeichner/rihanna-topless-lui-magazine">that Rihanna photo</a> as her Twitter avatar. About a week ago, she really started Tweeting frequently about the issue, using the hashtag #freethenipple, criticizing Instagram for deleting her account, and posting photos of babies breastfeeding.</p>

<p>Willis is clearly very comfortable with nudity (&quot;I wish I could be topless all day long,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508230744/https://twitter.com/Scout_Willis/status/461202646917849088">she Tweeted</a> last month), to the point that she even posed topless for photographer Terry Richardson <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508230744/http://gawker.com/5891582/terry-richardson-tried-to-finger-bruce-willis-daughter-at-a-bar">in a bathroom once</a>. For anyone who is interested in topless activism, National Go Topless Day is happening on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508230744/http://gotopless.org/">August 24th this year</a>.</p>
