<p>Metallica donned their finest pinstripes and took the stage in Yankee Stadium this afternoon to perform &quot;Enter Sandman&quot; in honor of baseball&apos;s greatest closer, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160825070141/http://gothamist.com/tags/marianorivera">Mariano Rivera</a>. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160825070141/http://gothamist.com/tags/yankees">Yankees</a> held a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160825070141/http://espn.go.com/new-york/mlb/story/_/id/9708691/new-york-yankees-laud-mariano-rivera-50-minute-ceremony">50 minute pre-game ceremony</a> for Rivera before today&apos;s game against the San Francisco Giants, which included a live performance of Rivera&apos;s longtime entrance song and retiring Rivera&apos;s No. 42 jersey. &quot;It is a great honor for me to be the last baseball player to ever wear No. 42,&quot; Rivera said. Check out some videos and reactions below.</p>

<p>&quot;Thank you for 19 years of support. It&apos;s been a great run and you guys have been amazing,&quot; Rivera said. &quot;You guys will have a part of my heart here in New York.&quot; Rivera was joined by ex-manager Joe Torre and ex-teammates Jorge Posada, Bernie Williams, Tino Martinez and others, during the ceremony. Mayor Bloomberg declared Sept. 22, 2013, &quot;Mariano Rivera Day.&quot; It&apos;s very possible that today will be one of Rivera&apos;s last appearances at the stadium&#x2014;the Yankees only have six more games left in the season (three home and three away), and they remain three games out of the wild card.</p>
