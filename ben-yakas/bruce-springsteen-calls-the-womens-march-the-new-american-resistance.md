<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170227123241/http://gothamist.com/tags/brucespringsteen">Bruce Springsteen</a> missed out on all the Women&apos;s Marches around the country this weekend, as he and the E Street Band were busy kicking off a 14-date tour of Australia and New Zealand. But Springsteen made sure to acknowledge the rallies and pledge his support during the first gig in Perth on Sunday, calling those who marched &quot;the new American resistance.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We&apos;re a long way from home, and our hearts and spirits are with the hundreds of thousands of women and men that marched yesterday in every city in America and in Melbourne,&quot; Springsteen said. &quot;[They] rallied against hate and division, and in support of tolerance, inclusion, reproductive rights, civil rights, racial justice, LGBTQ rights, the environment, wage equality, gender equality, healthcare, and immigrant rights. We stand with you. We are the new American resistance.&quot;</p>

<p>These are Springsteen&apos;s first tour dates since last September; he is expected to release a new solo album this year that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170227123241/http://www.jimmywebb.com/the-news/2016/9/7/bruce-springsteen-cites-jimmy-webb-and-glen-campbell-as-influences-on-new-album">he has compared</a> to the work of Jimmy Webb &amp; Glenn Campbell (&quot;pop records with a lot of strings and instrumentation&quot;).</p>

<p>Springsteen, who received the Presidential Medal Of Freedom <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170227123241/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/president-obama-awards-bruce-springsteen-medal-of-freedom-w452100">from President Obama</a> in November, spoke earlier this month <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170227123241/http://gothamist.com/2017/01/03/bruce_springsteen_trump.php">to Marc Maron</a> about his deep fears for the country and Trump&apos;s divisive mendacity.</p>

<p>&quot;When you let that genie out of the bottle &#x2014; bigotry, racism, intolerance... they don&#x2019;t go back in the bottle that easily if they go back in at all,&quot; Springsteen said. &quot;Whether it&#x2019;s a rise in hate crimes, people feeling they have license to speak and behave in ways that previously were considered un-American and are un-American. That&#x2019;s what he&#x2019;s appealing to. So my fears are that those things find a place in ordinary, civil society.&quot; </p>

<p>The Boss also performed a secret acoustic <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170227123241/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/springsteen-played-secret-white-house-gig-for-obama-staff-w461748">White House concert for Obama staffers</a> this month; a Springsteen cover band had been scheduled to perform at an inauguration ball in New Jersey, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170227123241/http://gothamist.com/2017/01/16/bruce_springsteen_cover_band_pull_o.php">pulled out after an outcry.</a></p>
