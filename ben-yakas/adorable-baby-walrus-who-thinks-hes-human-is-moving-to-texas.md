<p>Back in the fall of 2012, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160221000344/http://gothamist.com/tags/mitik">Mitik</a>, a 234-pound orphaned baby walrus from Alaska, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160221000344/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/10/baby_walrus.php#photo-1">was brought to</a> the New York Aquarium in Coney Island at just 15-weeks-old. He got <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160221000344/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/11/colbert_give_ny_aquariums_baby_walr.php">props from Stephen Colbert</a> and he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160221000344/http://gothamist.com/2012/11/01/photos_ny_aquariums_damage_after_be.php#photo-1">survived Sandy</a>&#x2014;and now he&apos;s left our fair city for warmer weather in Texas. </p>

<p>&quot;It&#x2019;s a positive move for him, and it&#x2019;s also a positive move for the aquarium because it allows us to work on the life support system in &apos;Sea Cliffs&apos; &quot; Jon Forrest Dohlin, vice president and director of the aquarium, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160221000344/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/22/nyregion/adored-walrus-goes-to-texas-as-aquarium-renovates.html?hpw&amp;rref=science&amp;_r=0">told the Times</a>. Dohlin was referring to the aquarium&apos;s marine mammal exhibit, which was heavily damaged during Sandy. Dohlin promises that Mitik will return eventually, which is especially important since visitors to the aquarium hadn&apos;t gotten to see him in person as a baby.</p>

<p>The other reason they&apos;re sending him to Texas is so he can socialize with other walruses. Because here&apos;s the best part: Mitik kinda thinks he&apos;s human. &#x201C;He&#x2019;s got a big pool and has plenty of room for physical growth and exercise,&quot; Dohlin said about Mitik&apos;s currently living situation at SeaWorld San Antonio. <strong>&quot;But he&#x2019;s making a funny transition from understanding that he&#x2019;s a human to understanding that he&#x2019;s a walrus. During his first look at a walrus, he was like, &apos;What&#x2019;s that?&apos;&quot;</strong></p>

<p>Nothing in this world is as good as Mitik.</p>
