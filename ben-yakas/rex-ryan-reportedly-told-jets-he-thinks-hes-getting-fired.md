<p>Whether you&apos;re a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150103062937/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/18/video_6-year-old_realizes_its_very.php">Jets fan</a>, or a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150103062937/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/21/video_male_jets_fan_punches_woman_i.php">Jets hater</a>, or a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150103062937/http://gothamist.com/tags/marksanchez">Jets player</a>, or a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150103062937/http://gothamist.com/tags/timtebow">former Jets player</a>, or a Jets coach, things are tough. Things are apparently very tough for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150103062937/http://gothamist.com/tags/rexryan">Rex Ryan</a> right now: according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150103062937/http://m.tmi.me/1d7qNn">NFL reporter Jay Glazer</a>, Ryan &quot;told his players in team meeting last night that word on street is that he&apos;s getting fired and asked players to fight w him these last 2 weeks.&quot; Is this the end of the line for Sexy Rexy, or does he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150103062937/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwouIbYEHmE">just need a god damn snack</a>?</p>

<p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150103062937/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2013/12/17/rex-ryan-no-doubt-im-still-right-man-for-jets/">Ryan was asked</a> whether he thought he was the right man to lead the Jets beyond this season. &#x201C;Of course, I believe it,&#x201D; Ryan said. &#x201C;No question, I believe it. There&#x2019;s no doubt, but again I&#x2019;d rather get out of this press conference and go to work. That&#x2019;s how I feel about it.&#x201D; There&apos;s been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150103062937/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2013/12/20/jones-rex-ryan-shouldnt-be-a-coaching-casualty-on-black-monday/?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter">a lot of debate</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150103062937/http://espn.go.com/blog/new-york/jets/post/_/id/33204/five-reasons-to-keep-or-dump-rex-ryan">by sportswriters</a> whether or not Ryan should get another shot&#x2014;especially considering the messy quarterback situation that has plagued the team over the past two seasons (remember Tebow?), and the fact he&apos;s weathered a lot of injuries this year during a season everyone wrote off beforehand.</p>

<p>At the same time, the Jets are three years removed from their last playoff series. They went 8-8 in 2011, 6-10 in 2012, and are 6-8 so far this season, which is not a very promising record. There have been a whole lot of distracting controversies for the Jets on and off the field during his tenure (including, among other things, buttfumble, &apos;I have pretty feet,&apos; <em>Hard Knocks</em>, that whole Tebow mess, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150103062937/https://twitter.com/TBNSully/status/414805846812393472">Dave &amp; Buster&apos;s night</a>). </p>

<p>And Ryan WOULD make an incredible color commentator/NFL broadcaster. But if he is fired, it seems more likely that he&apos;d look for another head coaching job somewhere else in the league, or at worse, return to being a defensive coordinator, which everyone agrees he&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150103062937/https://twitter.com/billbarnwell/status/414815129838956544">still pretty great at.</a> If only Rex <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150103062937/http://gothamist.com/2012/08/31/are_jets_touchdowns_inversely_propo.php">hadn&apos;t lost all that weight</a>, maybe the Jets would have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150103062937/http://instantrimshot.com/">won a Super Bowl by now.</a></p>
