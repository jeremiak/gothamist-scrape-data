<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:335px; "> <img alt="5711potkid.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110508104751im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/5711potkid.jpg" width="335" height="188"> <br> <i>IS 98 in the Bronx</i></div> We&apos;ve heard about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110508104751/http://gothamist.com/2010/11/12/kool_teacher_arrested_for_pot_givin.php">&quot;kool&quot; teachers</a> sharing pot with their students, and high teens <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110508104751/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/05/teen_pulls_a_gun_on_school-safety_i.php">pulling guns</a> on school aides, but this is some perverted mash-up of those two stories that is truly a first: a Bronx school aide <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110508104751/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/bronx/school_aide_drug_threat_RVOh3KHxF53q2FG9qU4pGK">was arrested</a> yesterday for allegedly threatening a student at knife-point if they didn&apos;t deal drugs for him. <strong>&quot;Do you remember what I told you, if you don&apos;t do this for me I will kill you and hurt your siblings and mother,</strong>&quot; teacher&apos;s aide Anthony Davis allegedly said to the teen.<p></p>

<p>Cops say that Davis, school aide at IS 98 in the Melrose section in the Bronx, approached a 15-year-old male student to sell pot for him on several occasions, trying to shove marijuana into his pocket on at least two occasions. According <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110508104751/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local/new_york&amp;id=8117336">to ABC</a>, he approached the teen with a knife in his hand in the last encounter, plunging the knife into a table, and menacingly threatened his siblings and mother.</p>

<p>Davis was arrested and charged with menacing, weapons possession and acting in a manner to injure a child. We truly can&apos;t imagine what Davis was thinking at the time if the allegations are true, but maybe he was inspired by the exploits of our favorite meth-producing, underwear-clad chemistry teacher, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110508104751/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breaking_Bad">Walter White</a>, and his relationship with &quot;Cap&apos;n Cook,&quot; Jesse Pinkman?</p>
