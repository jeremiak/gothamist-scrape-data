<p>We didn&apos;t need <em>The Onion</em> to remind us that the city is a bit of a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160301173731/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/02/the_onion_sums_up_our_summer.php">&quot;trash-ridden hellhole,&quot;</a> but they were slightly off: the city is built <em>on top</em> of a trash-ridden hellhole. And a new, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160301173731/http://believermag.com/issues/201009/?read=interview_nagle">fascinating interview</a> in this month&apos;s <em>The Believer</em> with Robin Nagle, the anthropologist-in-residence at New York City&#x2019;s Department of Sanitation (DOS), reveals even more about the state of garbage in NYC.</p>

<p>She tells <em>The Believer</em>: &quot;<strong>Every single thing you see is future trash. Everything.</strong> So we are surrounded by ephemera, but we can&#x2019;t acknowledge that, because it&#x2019;s kind of scary, because I think ultimately it points to our own temporariness, to thoughts that we&#x2019;re all going to die.&quot; </p>

<p>Among other things, she discusses mongoing (&quot;One of the categories of garbage has its own word in New York City...People who take things from the trash to keep are mongoing. Which, by the way, is illegal.&quot;), the Museum of Sanitation in New York (&quot;I want people to see the machinery and how it works and why it makes so much noise and what happens when you put twenty-two hundred pounds per square inch of pressure on a bag and it explodes back at you.&quot;), the stigma of working for the DOS (&quot;People assume they have low IQs; people assume they&#x2019;re fake mafiosi...I do believe very strongly it&#x2019;s the most important uniformed force on the street&quot;), and the health implications (&quot;New York had the highest infant mortality rates in the world for a long time in the middle of the nineteenth century. Those rates dropped. Life expectancy rose. When we cleaned the streets!&quot;). </p>

<p>However, <em>The Believer</em> neglects to ask her why we can&apos;t just sweep the garbage under the rug, and cover up the smells with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160301173731/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/26/bronx_tenants_consider_plan_to_pump.php">barrels</a> of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160301173731/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/01/can_perfume_cover_up_queens_stench.php">perfume</a>.
