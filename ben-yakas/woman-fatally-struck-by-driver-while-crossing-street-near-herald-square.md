<p>A woman was fatally struck by a driver as she attempted to cross the street near Herald Square yesterday evening. </p>

<p>Police say that Po Chu Ng, 52, was attempting to cross the intersection of Sixth Avenue at W 30th Street inside the crosswalk when the incident happened. A 27-year-old male driver, who was in a 2013 GMC Suburban, struck her as he made a left turn onto northbound Sixth Avenue. The victim was taken to Bellevue Hospital, where she was pronounced dead.</p>

<p>The driver, whose name hasn&apos;t been released, stayed at the scene. No arrests have been made, and the NYPD&apos;s Collision Investigation Square is investigating the incident.</p>

<p>This is the second time in the past week that someone was fatally struck by a driver in the vicinity: the driver of a Chevy Suburban SUV <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021005210/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/07/suv_driver_midtown_death.php">ran over a woman</a> crossing Eighth Avenue in the crosswalk at 38th Street last Monday. A group of bystanders had to collectively lift up the back of the vehicle so that others could drag the victim out from under the SUV. She later succumbed to her injuries at Bellevue Hospital, and the driver was arrested on a charge of failure to yield to a pedestrian. </p>
