</div></div>					<p>We all need some positive news to act as a life preserver lest we drown in a sea of hot takes and depressing headlines. And here&apos;s a pretty good one: over 100 puppies were rescued after a car accident in upstate NY. And they&apos;re all recovering! Everything&apos;s mostly going to be okay!! </p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170128173025/http://komonews.com/news/nation-world/troopers-help-rescue-dozens-of-puppies-after-steuben-co-crash">incident happened</a> on Tuesday when a Missouri woman, Emily Woodrum, crashed her box van, which contained 104 precious little packages, on Interstate 86 in the Town of Avoca. Woodrun was apparently going too fast and lost control, striking a ditch and overturning. Troopers and towing company employees helped rescue the pups. </p>

<p>LOOK UPON THEM AND WEEP TEARS OF JOY.</p>

<p>Five of the pups sustained minor injuries in the crash: a black lab with a broken leg and a shepherd puppy with a broken jaw were taken to Bath Veterinary Hospital, while most of the others were taken to or treated at the Finger Lakes SPCA. All of them are expected to recover and be PERFECT LITTLE ANGELS UNTIL THE END OF TIME, however. </p>

<p>&quot;Under the circumstances, they all seem really happy,&quot; Vicki Mosgrove, executive director of the Finger Lakes SPCA, told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170128173025/http://fox6now.com/2017/01/26/box-van-carrying-more-than-100-puppies-overturns-in-new-york-2-seriously-injured/">the local Fox affiliate</a>. &quot;They got comfortable here. They&#x2019;re playful, alert &#x2014; very healthy, good body conditions and just bright eyed, and we&#x2019;re happy that we could be there to help them.&quot; </p>

<p>It&apos;s unclear whether the driver was ticketed for the incident, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170128173025/http://www.twcnews.com/nys/binghamton/news/2017/01/25/steuben-county-puppy-crash-avoca.html">troopers believe</a> that the pups were being delivered to various local pet stores. </p>

<p>&quot;There&#x2019;s a transport vehicle that transports animals for breeders that was taking them to local pet stores,&quot; explained Dr. Becky Mortensen of Bath Veterinary Hospital. &quot;Because there aren&#x2019;t any cruelty investigation charges or anything, they&#x2019;ll just be returned to the transport company owners to go on to their intended location at the pet stores.&quot;</p>

<p>Finger Lakes explained the situation in detail in a long Facebook update (see below). As of Thursday, all but four of the 86 puppies that Finger Lakes had been taking care of were released back to the transport company. Finger Lakes also included some links to more information on puppy mills and how to stop them.</p>
