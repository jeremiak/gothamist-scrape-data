<p>A week after they completely shutdown the New England Patriots, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110624103116/http://gothamist.com/tags/jets">Jets</a> fever has reached bacterial pneumonia levels: thousands of fans turned out <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110624103116/http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2011/01/more_than_7000_fans_brave_cold.html">yesterday</a> at team&apos;s headquarters in Florham Park to send them off to Pittsburgh to play the Steelers in the AFC Championship game later today. Of course, Gov. Chris Christie couldn&apos;t let the opportunity pass to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110624103116/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/20/do_the_jets_belong_to_ny_or_nj.php">rib NYers</a> over whom the Jets truly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110624103116/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/chris_garden_statement_they_play_kSNEGlxtNGeIXGrY6ZhmCK#ixzz1Bs3imgL0">belong to</a>: &quot;I have one message for Mayor Bloomberg and Gov. Cuomo.<strong> When the Jets train, they train in New Jersey. When the Jets play, they play in New Jersey. And when they get a Super Bowl trophy, it&apos;s coming to New Jersey!&quot;</strong> This guy strongly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110624103116/http://twitter.com/#!/KINGDIESEL88/statuses/29147705200611328">disagrees.</a></p>

<p>Last year, approximately 4-5,000 people showed up in NJ to form a human tunnel to send the Jets off to face (and ultimately lose to) the Colts in the AFC Championship. But this year, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110624103116/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2011/01/22/jets-fans-prep-for-afc-sendoff/">estimated turnout</a> was over 7,500 rabid, freezing, frenzied fans, which Coach Rex Ryan and his team appreciated.  &#x201C;We love the support you&#x2019;re giving us. Absolutely incredible,&#x201D; Ryan said. Celebrities <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110624103116/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/jet_set_celebs_fanning_flames_AELWGwB0EV4qj5jr2S6lcI">were also rallying</a> for the Jets: &quot;I will tweet photos of my wife&apos;s perfect feet for Rex [Ryan] if they win the Super Bowl,&quot; quipped comedian and &quot;die-hard Jet fan&quot; Jay Mohr.  Director and actor Jon Favrea tweeted, &quot;Bring on the Steelers!&quot;; SNL member Fred Armisen said the Jets &quot;are and always have been the best ever. I bet Steelers fans actually secretly think that;&quot; and actor Matthew Modine praised Mark Sanchez&apos;s sheer &quot;moxie.&quot;</p>
