<p>Through its many sequels, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170504235419/http://gothamist.com/tags/thefastandthefurious">the <em>Fast and Furious</em> series</a> has transcended its roots as a humble <em>Point Break</em>-ripoff&#x2014;and also overcome forgettable villains, chronological anomalies, endless backyard BBQs, and the death of one of its lead actors in real life&#x2014;to become the most brilliant, batshit-crazy, ethnically-diverse popcorn action film franchise of the 21st century. The most recent movie in the saga, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170504235419/http://gothamist.com/2017/04/10/fate_of_the_furious_review.php"><em>The Fate Of The Furious</em></a>, is still in theaters lingering around the top of the box office, but Nitehawk is taking a step back to appreciate how we got here with a special weeklong celebration of living life a quarter mile at a time.</p>

<p>Between May 15th and 22nd, Nitehawk will be screening the first seven movies in the franchise, starting with the floppy discs and rap-rock soundtrack of the original <em>The Fast And The Furious</em> through 2015&apos;s elegy for Paul Walker <em>Furious 7</em>. There will be <em>Fast/Furious</em>-inspired food and drink specials including a &quot;Tuna Sandwich No Crust&quot; (Albacore tuna salad, avocado, pea shoots, pickled ginger, wasabi mayo, brioche, house cut fries or salad) in honor of how <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170504235419/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqbE8rR8kAE">the series started.</a> And if you show your Fast and Furious ticket stub in Lo-Res after the screening you&apos;ll receive $5 Familia Camarena Tequila cocktails (Familia Camarena Tequila, Ancho Reyes, fresh lime, ginger pineapple syrup, salted rim).</p>

<p>Nitehawk notes that this is one of the rare times they have planned a weeklong (in succession) series. All tickets cost $12, and can be purchased now <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170504235419/https://nitehawkcinema.com/williamsburg/film-series/all-fast-all-furious/">by clicking on this link.</a></p>

<p>Here&apos;s the full schedule:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Monday, May 15th - <em>The Fast and the Furious</em> | 7:30 p.m.</li>
	<li>Tuesday, May 16th - <em>2 Fast 2 Furious</em> | 7:30 p.m.</li>
	<li>Wednesday, May 17th - <em>The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift</em> | 7:30 p.m.</li>
	<li>Thursday, May 18th - <em>Fast and Furious</em> | 9:30 p.m.</li>
	<li>Friday, May 19th - <em>Fast 5</em>  | MIDNITE</li>

</ul>

<p>And if you need any convincing why these movies have elevated stupid-fun into the realm of commercial art (or at least into the realm of obsession-worthy devotion), <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170504235419/http://gothamist.com/2015/03/26/fast_furious_hot_take.php">check out our <em>Fast and Furious</em> explainer</a>.</p>
