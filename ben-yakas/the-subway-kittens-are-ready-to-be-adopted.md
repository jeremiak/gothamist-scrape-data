<p>You&apos;ll recall that just before Labor Day Weekend, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203044811/http://gothamist.com/tags/subwaykittens">a pair of adorable kittens frolicking on the train tracks</a> brought subway service to a standstill in Brooklyn for several hours. Kitties August and Arthur were eventually safely rescued, and found themselves briefly used as a talking point <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203044811/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/31/joe_lhota_would_have_let_subway_kit.php">in the mayoral race.</a> Now, Animal Care and Control say the 10-week-old kittens are ready to be adopted&#x2014;and thankfully, they won&apos;t be separated: &quot;They really are bonded and love being together, and that&apos;s why we want them adopted into the same home,&quot; AC&amp;C;&apos;s Richard Gentles <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203044811/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/subway-kittens-arthur-august-adoption-article-1.1489728">told the News.</a></p>

<p>&#x201C;While still a bit shy, Arthur and August are playful and sweet kittens, whose trouble-making days aren&#x2019;t entirely behind them &#x2014; though the trouble they&#x2019;re up to now is on a much smaller scale than the kind that made the headlines over the summer,&#x201D; AC&amp;C; said in a release. The kitties <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203044811/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/05/subway_kittens_living_it_up_in_broo.php#photo-1">were being fostered by Steven Liu</a> in Bushwick since September, but they&apos;ve now been moved to the AC&amp;C; care center in Manhattan. Adoption specialists expect there will be a flood of applications for them, so they&apos;re already trying to narrow down potential homes: &quot;We would prefer them to go to a home with no kids, or older kids, simply because it would make for an easier transition,&quot; Gentles added.</p>

<p>&quot;They&apos;re pretty similar in personality,&quot; he said. &quot;When they get into a new home, they&apos;ll probably be a little shy and hide. Once they get acclimated, they&apos;ll start venturing out.&quot; If you are interested in applying for them, you can email adoption@nycacc.org.
