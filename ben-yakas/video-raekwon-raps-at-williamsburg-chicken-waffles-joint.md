<p>If you&apos;re going to celebrate the one-year-anniversary of a hip Williamsburg restaurant, you need to invite the Chef. Sweet Chick, the chicken &amp; waffles joint on Bedford Avenue, did just that last night by inviting Raekwon, the Chef of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140424033002/http://gothamist.com/tags/wutangclan">Wu-Tang Clan</a>. And who better to celebrate with than someone who knows chicken rules everything around me.</p>

<p>After the brief performance, Raekwon enjoyed some of the delicacies of the restaurant, along with Hennessy in his mason jar. Sweet Chick <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140424033002/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/27/former_max_fish_space_to_become_chi.php">will be opening a new location</a> at the site of departed art bar Max Fish on the Lower East Side this spring. Seymour will have to get someone who appreciates <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140424033002/http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/ghostfacekillah/greedybitches.html">the importance of chicken after the club</a> if he wants to top this one.</p>
