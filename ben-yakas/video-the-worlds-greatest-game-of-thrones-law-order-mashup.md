<p>This morning, after arriving at Gothamist HQ and going through normal morning procedures (taking off jacket, putting coffee on, scrubbing dead cells off body while crying), I messaged a coworker: &quot;I really, really want someone to mashup the court scene from the last episode [of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504233432/http://gothamist.com/tags/gameofthrones"><em>Game Of Thrones</em></a>] with <em>Law &amp; Order</em>! I want to hear some <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504233432/http://gothamist.com/2004/03/11/chung_chung.php">chung chungs</a> before each witness comes to testify. Also, is it possible we could get some new brillo pads, the old ones are really chafing my genetic material.&quot; Clearly someone cares about me, because the internet gaveth exactly what I was looking for. Below, check out the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504233432/http://gothamist.com/2014/05/12/game_of_thrones_power_rankings_the_3.php">epic final scene of this week&apos;s GOT</a> (SPOILERS AHOY) give the Dick Wolf treatment.</p>

<p>Truly, there could be no finer way of performing that scene, unless of course Tyrion started blasting some classic Skee-Lo.</p>
