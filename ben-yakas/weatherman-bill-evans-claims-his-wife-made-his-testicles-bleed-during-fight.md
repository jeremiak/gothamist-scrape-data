<p>Marriage is hard, and divorce is usually worse: sometimes your ex sends you <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130727020936/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/08/man_allegedly_sent_poo-covered_alim.php">poo-covered alimony checks</a>, and sometimes your ex scratches your testicles so hard you bleed. That&apos;s what ABC weatherman Bill Evans claims his soon-to-be ex-wife did to him. We imagine it was raining pure pain that day.</p>

<p>52-year-old Emmy-winning meteorologist Evans and his wife Dana are in the middle of an apparently contentious divorce, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130727020936/http://www.greenwichtime.com/local/article/Weatherman-and-wife-present-different-accounts-of-4608375.php">according to Greenwich Times</a>. Each alleges that the other physically assaulted them during a confrontation on May 4th that revolved around moving cars at their Old Greenwich home in Connecticut. </p>

<p>Evans claims the confrontation started when his wife &#x201C;began to insult him in front of their children and told him that he does not live there nor is he wanted there,&#x201D; according to the affidavit. They got into an argument over moving a car, and Evans claims she punched and slapped him before throwing the keys into a closet. While fighting for the keys, she allegedly <strong>&quot;grabbed the waist band of his underwear and reached for his scrotum with her free hand, subsequently scratching it, which resulted in bleeding.&#x201D;</strong> Then she allegedly repeatedly hit him with a wooden hanger.</p>

<p>Dana admitted to hitting him with the hanger, but said it was because he initiated the fight by grabbing her wrist, shoving her, and punching her in the face. Evans&apos; lawyer claims she only went forward with this story to gain an upper hand in the divorce proceedings, which Dana&apos;s lawyer strenuously denies.</p>

<p>Both parties have been arraigned on charges of disorderly conduct and third-degree assault, and ordered to stay the hell away from each other. </p>
