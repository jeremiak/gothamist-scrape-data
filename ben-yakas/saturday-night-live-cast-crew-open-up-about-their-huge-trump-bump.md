<p><em>Saturday Night Live</em> has been all-in on the Trump administration this season, riding the wave to its highest ratings in 20 years (as well as a level of cultural relevancy that has only happened a few times over the course of the program&apos;s history). But even with all the Sean Spicer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170716114910/http://gothamist.com/2017/05/14/spiceys_back_melissa_mccarthy_snl.php#photo-1">podium journeys</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170716114910/http://gothamist.com/2017/04/13/alec_baldwin_interview.php">Alec Baldwin congratulations</a>, people still bring up the albatross around SNL&apos;s neck: the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170716114910/http://gothamist.com/2015/11/08/donald_trump_snl_terrible_terrible_terrible.php#photo-4">dreadful 2015 episode</a> hosted by then-candidate Donald Trump. Most people associated with the show haven&apos;t commented on the lingering resentment toward the episode, but they finally did in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170716114910/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/snl-trump-ratings-bump-you-almost-feel-like-a-war-profiteer-1003540">an extensive interview with The Hollywood Reporter</a> this week.</p>

<p>&quot;I always think it&apos;s so funny when people talk about the idea that we somehow introduced him to America or that our show or Jimmy Fallon has humanized him,&quot; Colin Jost told them. &quot;He&apos;s been on the cover of every tabloid consistently for 30 years. When he hosted last season, the worry was, &apos;Would he have burned out by the time he even came to host?&apos; That was Lorne&apos;s concern more than the concern of, &apos;How will this help him?&apos;&quot; Of course he is right about Trump being a public person and staple of tabloid covers for years&#x2014;but there&apos;s a pretty huge difference between being on the back page of the NY Post and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170716114910/http://variety.com/2015/tv/news/donald-trump-saturday-night-live-12-minutes-1201636040/">getting free air time</a> on national television. SNL isn&apos;t a news program; it doesn&apos;t have to cover tabloid stars or give them a platform. It definitely didn&apos;t have to help Trump <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170716114910/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/11/snl_trump_reality_tv.php">look cuddly and in-on-the-joke</a>. </p>

<p>&quot;People had different opinions about him being there at that time, but during that week, he was in second place in Iowa, behind Ben Carson,&quot; writer Bryan Tucker said. &quot;He was definitely a national phenomenon, but he was not imminently going to be president.&quot; </p>

<p>At least Jost seems a little uncomfortable, or at the very least self-aware, of some of the contradictions: &quot;It&apos;s been harder in the past couple of years at SNL because the culture&apos;s so fragmented,&quot; he added. &quot;If you do a parody even of a huge show like <em>Game of Thrones</em>, it doesn&apos;t have the full cultural resonance of a <em>Cheers</em> or <em>Friends</em>. Whereas politics right now is probably the closest we&apos;ve come to a full-blown national phenomenon as anything in a long time, and anytime people are paying more attention to politics, it&apos;s good for our show. But you almost feel like a war profiteer at times because we&apos;ve benefited from a situation that&apos;s so tough.&quot;</p>

Check out a few more highlights below:

</p><ul>
	<li>Baldwin on his Trump motivation: &quot;They give you all the resources you need to watch and look at Trump in different tableaux: Trump somewhat off the record, Trump caught by a camera, not just Trump making a speech. But I watch and watch and I still don&apos;t know what I&apos;m going to do. Then I get out and all I remember is, &apos;Just try to make him unhappy.&apos; There are many people who do Trump now, and they have different Trumps. They have kind of a &apos;balls-of-his-feet-light Trump&apos; or what I like to call &apos;Gene Kelly Trump.&apos; But my Trump is &apos;Miserable Trump.&apos; No matter what. He wins, he loses, he&apos;s miserable.&quot;</li>
	<li>Tucker on the story behind Dave Chappelle&apos;s election night sketch: &quot;I had written for Dave 12 years ago, so I had a personal stake in trying to make that show go well because I had promised Dave that it would. The night of the election was crazy. Like most of America, I expected Hillary to win. Dave and I had even talked through some sketches with that assumption. There was a lot of talk about Trump starting his own TV network if he lost, and so one of them was a preview of what that might be like. Dave was going to play Milwaukee sheriff David Clarke, who had his own show. But by 1 a.m., it looked like Trump had won. I was watching with Leslie Jones and Dave. A lot of people in the office were shocked, many were upset, but Dave and Leslie just kind of shrugged. They were like, &apos;That&apos;s what happens.&apos; That attitude was the inspiration for the election night sketch. [Poking fun at overconfident Hillary supporters, surprise guest Chris Rock cautioned white liberals against celebrating too early.]&quot;</li>
	<li>Aziz Ansari on the monologue joke he cut from his post-inauguration episode: &apos;The inauguration was that Friday, and the mood was so dark, like a national tragedy had happened. All I could think was, &apos;How are we going to do this tomorrow?&apos; Then the next day the Women&apos;s March happened, and it changed everything. I had to change my monologue because I&apos;d opened the whole thing with this joke that no longer made sense. It was something like, &apos;I know everyone&apos;s upset but let&apos;s look at the bright side: there&apos;s a huge group of people who are motivated to take action, they&apos;re ready to do something. Well, to an extent.&apos; Have you ever been to these brunches where people are like, &apos;Guys, we&apos;ve got to get out there and do something. What should we do?&apos; And you go, &apos;Well, you can get involved with state and local government, you can start working with organizations like the ACLU...&apos;  &apos;Whoa, whoa, woah, I&apos;m not doing any of that. Is there any way I can make a difference just by complaining at bunch?&apos; But on that Saturday, we couldn&apos;t do that joke anymore because people were out there doing something.&quot;</li>
	<li>Melissa McCarthy came up with Kristen Stewart&apos;s monologue idea: &quot;Back in February, I was on a plane with Kristen [Stewart] &#x2014; she was coming out to host SNL; I was coming out to shoot a movie. She has a reputation for not loving to be interviewed, which I think becomes very funny, so I shamelessly pitched her [this monologue idea where she&apos;s] doing the worst opening ever.&quot;</li>
	<li>McCarthy on the first time she portrayed Spicer: &quot;I was so nervous that first time. It was very quiet at first, and I&apos;m thinking, &apos;The audience is already turning before they even know what&apos;s going on.&apos; There was this weird, great delay, and first people figure out it&apos;s Spicer and then they figure out it&apos;s me. You could just feel it in the room. And then I get off, and I have all of these texts, like &apos;Oh, my God, are you looking at what&apos;s happening?&apos; I didn&apos;t quite know what to do with the reaction.&quot;</li>
	<li>Leslie Jones on playing Trump: &quot;Most political stuff I try to stay away from, but the black Trump sketch was [an exception]. One night I was imitating Trump with Kenan [Thompson] and I was like, &apos;I think I want to be Trump.&apos; He said I should write it. It was really about getting the look down &#x2014; they made me my own Trump wig and eyebrows &#x2014; and then a couple of his phrases. I just thought it&apos;d be funny because it&apos;s like everybody else was playing him, but I&apos;d never seen anyone play him who&apos;s black. And a black woman playing him would be hilarious and probably just piss him off really bad.&quot;</li>
	<li>Jones also on why the show didn&apos;t bring in Rosie O&apos;Donnell to play Steve Bannon: &quot;I asked Lorne, &apos;How come y&apos;all aren&apos;t bringing Rosie O&apos;Donnell in [to play Bannon, per her plea on Twitter] or any of them to do it?&apos; And he was like, &apos;When you&apos;re playing a character, you can&apos;t play it from hate. You have to play it from funny, because when you play it from hate, it looks like you&apos;re just being mean.&apos; I love Rosie to death, but he might have been right on that one.&quot;</li>
	<li>Baldwin on whether he&apos;ll play Trump in the future: &quot;People talk now about getting Trump removed or impeached. It&apos;s going to be impossible with the Republican Congress in place. Maybe that will ramp up if they lose the midterms? Look, I&apos;d love to keep doing this per my availability, but I have other things I&apos;m going to do, so I guess we&apos;ll figure it out. If I&apos;m doing a film [a Lamborghini biopic opposite Antonio Banderas] in Rome in the fall, you can bet I&apos;m going to be on a satellite from Rome doing Trump. (In Trump&apos;s voice) &apos;We&apos;re going to tear down the Pantheon. These paintings all gotta go. They&apos;re disgusting. By the way, this place is filled with Italians. Italy is wall to wall Italians.&apos; I have a lot of things I&apos;m supposed to do. I&apos;m sure Lorne will find ways to kill them. He&apos;ll call the producer: &apos;You know he can&apos;t kiss his wife in the scene because of that disease he has.&apos; (Laughs.)&quot;</li>
