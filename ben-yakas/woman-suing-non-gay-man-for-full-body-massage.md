										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="32411massage.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160229004009im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/32411massage.jpg" width="250" height="188" class="image-left"> </span>It&apos;s the oldest trick in the book for certain guys: a dude pretends to be gay to get close to a girl, or in the sleazier cases, to convince a girl to let him touch her and/or see her naked. There have been whole <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160229004009/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_To_Tango">genres</a> of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160229004009/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Now_Pronounce_You_Chuck_and_Larry">movies</a> based on this ploy. But one NJ masseur is finding out it doesn&apos;t make for comedic gold when it happens in real life, even if you didn&apos;t necessarily intend for it to happen.</p>

<p>A 20-year-old Jersey City woman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160229004009/http://www.nj.com/news/jjournal/jerseycity/index.ssf?/base/news-11/130094793260281.xml&amp;coll=3">said she consented</a> to having her breasts and buttocks massaged at a downtown Jersey City health club because she believed her male massage therapist was gay. But after she was informed that he in fact has a girlfriend, she filed a police complaint alleging sexual criminal contact. But it seems that the masseur, a 30-year-old Jersey City resident, never purported to be gay&#x2014;he appeared &quot;shocked&quot; to learn of the complaint.</p>

<p>The woman told police the massage therapist asked her if she wanted her &quot;glutes and breasts&quot; massaged last Tuesday at Club H Fitness. Although she felt uncomfortable at the time of the massage, she &quot;was under the impression that it was a regular practice&quot; and she believed the suspect &quot;was of a homosexual orientation.&quot; The masseur allegedly told his boss that she had consented to the extra massage, so he wasn&apos;t hiding what happened. </p>

<p>According to Joel Lewis, a massage therapist with Massage Envy, it is not unusual for massage therapists to give full body massages of this kind; however, they do require a special certification to perform breast massages. So was this an accident, a case of miscommunication, or was the masseur trying to pull a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160229004009/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boat_Trip">Boat Trip</a>?</p>
