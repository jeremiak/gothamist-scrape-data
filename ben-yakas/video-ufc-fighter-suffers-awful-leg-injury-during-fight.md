<p>UFC fighter Anderson Silva <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140205175459/http://www.newsday.com/sports/mixed-martial-arts/chris-weidman-beats-anderson-silva-to-retain-middleweight-title-at-ufc-168-1.6687311">suffered a gruesome leg injury</a> that prematurely ended last night&apos;s title fight against Chris Weidman. Weidman, who hails from Long Island, successfully defended his UFC title after Silva broke his shin on a kick to Weidman&apos;s knee in the second round at UFC 168 Saturday night. &quot;There&apos;s no real excitement in a fight finishing like that, because you never want to see anyone get hurt like that,&quot; Weidman said. Warning: don&apos;t watch if you are squeamish about legs getting turned into limp noodles.</p>

<p>&quot;As soon as I checked it, I knew I checked it right, and he was going to be in a lot of pain,&quot; Weidman said. &quot;As soon as he put his foot down and I saw him fall, I knew it was over.&quot; The move Weidman used <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140205175459/http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2013/dec/29/chris-weidman-injury-inflicted-upon-anderson-silva/">is called</a> &#x201C;The Destruction,&#x201D; which is when a fighter crashes his knee into an opponent&#x2019;s leg kick. &#x201C;I&#x2019;ve done it a couple times in sparring and guys take some time, about a minute off, and they walk around and they&#x2019;re OK,&#x201D; Weidman added. &#x201C;It stops them from kicking you, but to break someone&#x2019;s leg? I&#x2019;ve never done that before.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Silva was immediately taken to a local hospital after the fight, where he had surgery on his left leg. An intramedullary rod was inserted into his left tibia, according to a statement from the UFC. The broken fibula was stabilized as well and a second surgery will not be necessary. </p>

<p>&#x201C;There&#x2019;s nothing worse than breaking your leg like that,&#x201D; UFC President Dana White said. &#x201C;Well, there are worse things but it&#x2019;s the worst thing that&#x2019;s ever happened here.&#x201D;<br>
