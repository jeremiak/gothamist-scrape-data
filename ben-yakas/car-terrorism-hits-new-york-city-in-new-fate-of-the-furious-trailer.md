<p>Forget <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170923144504/http://gothamist.com/2017/03/09/climate_change_scott_pruitt.php">climate change deniers</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170923144504/http://gothamist.com/tags/donaldtrump">&quot;America&apos;s one man white supremacist employment program.&quot;</a> The greatest threat to human existence is CAR TERRORISM. The greatest threat to NYC isn&apos;t Cyborg Rudy Giuliani running for mayor again or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170923144504/http://gothamist.com/2016/12/08/sea_levels_surrounding_nyc_could_ri.php">rising sea levels</a>&#x2014;it&apos;s CAR TERRORISM. And the only documentary that gets to the heart of this CAR TERRORISM epidemic is <em><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170923144504/http://gothamist.com/tags/thefastandthefurious">The Fate Of The Furious</a>, a.k.a. Fast &amp; Furious 8, a.k.a. Fast 8, a.k.a. Furious 8, a.k.a. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170923144504/http://gothamist.com/2015/03/26/fast_furious_hot_take.php">Family: The Movie Of The Life.</a></em></p>

<p>Below, you can watch the latest trailer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170923144504/http://gothamist.com/2017/02/06/fate_furious_trailer.php">to the latest movie</a> from our favorite globe-trotting, prison-breaking, car-gasming heroes. In addition to shedding light on the scourge of car terrorism, this video may hold the record for most number of epic quotes about family packed into one trailer: &quot;Alright team listen up: this crew&apos;s about family, but the game has changed now;&quot; &quot;You&apos;re gonna turn your back on family?&quot; and of course, &quot;We&apos;ve only got one chance to make this family whole again.&quot; </p>

<p>Strap in for the most emotionally resonant movie trailer in all of human history that also happens to include The Rock picking up what appears to be a giant nuke and hurling it toward some bad guys. April 14th, 2017 can&apos;t arrive soon enough. </p>
