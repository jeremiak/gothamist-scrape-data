<p>In August, a poor pit bull puppy was hospitalized with a broken neck <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424161151/http://gothamist.com/2012/08/15/pit_bull_puppy_suffers_broken_neck.php">after being brutally thrown from a moving car</a> in Long Island. Then three-month-old pup Joey, who was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424161151/http://gothamist.com/2012/08/16/20k_reward_offered_for_info_about_p.php">tossed out in a trash bag</a>, fractured six neck vertebrae when he hit the ground. But Joey <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424161151/http://gothamist.com/2012/09/03/pit_bull_pup_tossed_from_moving_car.php#photo-1">has been recovering</a> at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424161151/http://www.vmcli.com/">Veterinary Medical Center of Long Island</a> in West Islip since then, and he&apos;s almost 100% better! Next week, you&apos;ll be able to adopt him&#x2014;but tomorrow, the Medical Center will be holding &quot;Joey&apos;s&quot; Fan Appreciation Day, and you&apos;ll have a chance to meet Joey in person. How can you say not to this face:</p>

<p>The event, which starts at 1 p.m. at the Medical Center, is a chance for Joey (&quot;in his favorite attire&quot;) to meet his supporters and thank them personally for helping him recover. There will be music, snacks, face-painting, give-a-ways, and pictures; they ask that you <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424161151/https://www.facebook.com/events/327432714019256/">RSVP on Facebook</a> so they can accomodate everyone who comes. Based on the video below, maybe you should consider bringing a nice big stick if you go:</p>
