<p>In a perfect metaphor for their disastrous season, beleaguered Red Sox manager <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140716091054/http://gothamist.com/tags/bobbyvalentine">Bobby Valentine</a> injured himself checking a text message while biking in Central Park yesterday. It&apos;s hard to top the first sentence of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140716091054/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/03/sports/baseball/bobby-valentine-injured-after-reading-text-while-cycling.html">NY Times story on it</a>: &quot;In the final days of one of the most painful seasons of his career, Red Sox Manager Bobby Valentine on Tuesday <strong>lay entangled with his bicycle at the bottom of a ditch next to the Central Park Reservoir.&quot;</strong> Of course this had to happen to him in NYC.</p>

<p>Valentine, the former Mets manager who once snuck in the dugout incognito in a fake mustache, told them he was reading a text from second basemen Dustin Pedroia when the accident occurred&#x2014;when he looked up, <strong>he had to swerve to avoid the umbrellas of two French tourists walking in front of him.</strong> How and why he knew they were FRENCH tourists (maybe they were carrying baguettes, or wearing berets?), we&apos;ll never know. Valentine, who rides his bike to Fenway Park most days, sustained minor injuries to his knees and hips. </p>

<p>There&apos;s no mention of him getting any tickets or anything, but Valentine apologized for texting-while-biking. &#x201C;I shouldn&#x2019;t have been reading a text while I was riding, &#x201D; he said. &#x201C;That&#x2019;s the wrong thing to do. But at least I was wearing my helmet.&#x201D; Valentine must be getting pretty used to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140716091054/http://sportsofboston.com/2012/09/27/bobby-valentine-thinks-hell-stay-2013-ben-cherington-disagrees/">this kind of bargaining.</a></p>
