                            <p>This week marks the six month anniversary of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130730164605/http://gothamist.com/tags/hurricanesandy">Hurricane Sandy</a>, and we&apos;re still dealing with the impact of that storm: the Mermaid Parade <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130730164605/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/02/sandy_may_have_ruined_the_mermaid_p.php">might be cancelled</a>, the subway system has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130730164605/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/15/subway_system_still_reeling_from_hu.php">plenty of residual problems</a>, and there are still more animals who are homeless. One such dog is 11-month old Cairo, a stray found in Brooklyn during the storm who suffered serious heart problems&#x2014;but is now fully recuperated and ready to be adopted.</p>

<p>After being picked up by Animal Care &amp; Control, Cairo was temporarily sheltered at the ASPCA&apos;s emergency boarding facility in Brooklyn. He was diagnosed with pulmonic stenosis, a heart condition that restricts blood flow to the heart and causes him to collapse. Since no one came to reclaim Cairo, the ASPCA took him in and has spent the past few months rehabilitating him, both medically and emotionally. His heart surgery and behavioral rehabilitation were successful, and the vets say he&apos;s now ready to find a new family.</p>

<p>In the wake of Hurricane Sandy, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130730164605/http://gothamist.com/2012/11/02/urgent_adopt_or_foster_these_dogs_a.php#photo-1">there were hundreds of animals displaced</a> across the five boroughs. Plenty of those adorable pets <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130730164605/http://gothamist.com/2012/11/07/21_photos_of_cats_dogs_ferrets_bein.php#photo-1">were rescued by various city agencies</a> and reunited with their owners. Others were given temporary housing at emergency shelters <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130730164605/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/03/photos_owners_urged_to_pick_up_disp.php#photo-1">and ASPCA boarding facilities</a>; others still <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130730164605/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/15/last_adorable_sandy-displaced_dog_n.php">had to find temporary homes</a> while their owners looked for better living situations. </p>

<p>If you&apos;re interested in possibly adopting Cairo, you can call the ASPCA Adoption Center, (212) 876-7700 ext. 4900 or <a href="www.adoptaspca.org">visit their website.</a></p>
