<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509165636/http://gothamist.com/tags/subwayetiquette">Subway etiquette</a> is a topic that is very near and dear to our hearts, one which we&apos;ll never get tired of discussing because New Yorkers will never get tired of breaking the most basic and rudimentary social contracts (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509165636/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/15/etiquette_week_subway.php#photo-1">SEAT FEET</a>). This isn&apos;t just a NYC phenomena of course&#x2014;all major metros around the world have to deal with inconsiderate ingrates. But some countries have slightly more whimsical ways of dealing with rudeness, like the Paris transport authority, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509165636/http://www.chervoyageurmoderne.fr/">who has released a subway etiquette guide</a> that has a certain je ne sais quoi. </p>

<p>Besides the charmingly old-fashioned pictures you see above, the &quot;politeness manual&quot; includes 12 basic commandments for French travelers, divided into four &quot;pillars of civility&quot; (helpfulness, courtesy, manners and politeness). They cover the areas you&apos;d expect&#x2014;don&apos;t play loud music, don&apos;t have phone conversations, don&apos;t urinate on the train, cover your mouth when you sneeze for crissakes&#x2014;but put a decidedly cutesy twist on the whole enterprise with lines like, &quot;the huge crossed out cigarette on the platform is not a work of contemporary art but a ban on smoking&quot; and &quot;It&apos;s worth losing two minutes of your time for a good cause if only to hear the [foreign] passenger struggle to pronounce [train stations] Trinit&#xE9; d&apos;Estienne d&apos;Orves or La Motte Piquet-Grenelle.&quot;</p>

<p>So below, we&apos;ve put the almost totally incoherent (but unintentionally poetic) Free Translation versions of the 12 rules&#x2014;and in brackets, we&apos;ve re-translated that garble with the help of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509165636/http://uncommon-courtesy.com/">Uncommon Courtesy&apos;s</a> Jaya Saxena (and her high school-level French). </p>
