<p>A rookie cop accidentally shot himself while responding to a domestic dispute call in Brooklyn last night. The 26-year-old officer, who hasn&apos;t been identified, had gotten a report of a young mentally ill man attacking his mother in their Bed-Stuy apartment just before 8 p.m. Saturday when the incident happened.
