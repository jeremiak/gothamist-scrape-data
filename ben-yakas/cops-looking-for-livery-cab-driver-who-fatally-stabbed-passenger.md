<p>Police are still searching for a livery cab driver <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508164112/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/13/livery_cab_driver_allegedly_fatally.php">who fatally stabbed one man and wounded another</a> in an early Saturday morning dispute. Isaac Martinez, 26, and Carlos Perez, 33, had just bought two six-packs when they hailed a livery car just before 5 a.m. Saturday in Woodside. When the unidentified driver noticed they were drunk, he tried to get them out of the cab, and an argument ensued. The driver then got a baseball bat and hit Perez in the head. </p>

<p>The driver then allegedly grabbed a knife and stabbed Perez in the arm and torso. As he was leaving, Martinez attempted to stop him, and the driver stabbed him in the chest. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508164112/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/queens/livery-driver-stabs-2-killing-1-queens-article-1.1398070">According to the News</a>, a witness who saw the incident threw one of the beer bottles at the car, smashing the rear window (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508164112/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/queens/cabby_bat_stab_slay_fury_wa9vzPtapsI8g1HpCuVkxI">the Post claims</a> that the driver smashed the window when he was attacking the passengers with the bat). </p>

<p>&#x201C;There was lots of blood,&#x201D; witness Carlos Arcillas, who was walking to work when he saw Martinez on his back, told the News. &#x201C;(His friend) was holding his side and checking on him,&#x201D; Arcillas said. &#x201C;He was talking very soft, because I think he was suffering or in pain ...I was nervous, there was too much blood.&#x201D; Both men were rushed to Elmhurst Hospital, where Martinez died from the stab wound, which pierced his heart.</p>

<p>Perez is currently in stable condition there, where he is being treated for stab wounds to his right bicep and chest. Friends were in shock by the death: &#x201C;He was like family. I&#x2019;m still in shock. I just saw him yesterday [Friday],&#x201D; Hugo Ortego, manager at a bar where Martinez formerly deejayed, told the Post. &#x201C;He was popular in the neighborhood. He used to work at different bars as a deejay. He loved music. He didn&#x2019;t have a bad temper. Isaac is not argumentative.&#x201D;<br>
