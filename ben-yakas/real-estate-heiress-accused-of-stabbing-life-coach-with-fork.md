<p>A rich real estate heiress who was previously sued for allegedly roughing up her addiction coach has been sued by a different life coach for roughing him up. The Post <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130517065920/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/socialite_fork_stab_e4m0GSXnm89TLPEO88GIPI">has all the details</a> on the lawsuit against 33-year-old real estate scion Joselyn Wohl, who allegedly stabbed 31-year-old life coach Sajjadur Rahman last September while they were dining at her father&apos;s $4 million Southampton home. Well, if you had a life coach, wouldn&apos;t you want to stab them with a fork too?</p>

<p>The lawsuit alleges, &#x201C;Without just cause or provocation, Joselyn Wohl intentionally struck, battered and assaulted [Rahman].&quot; Rahman&apos;s lawyer Eric Richman told the Post that Rahman still has a metal fragment from the utensil stuck in his finger. &#x201C;It was a defensive move. If he hadn&#x2019;t gotten his hand up, she would have stabbed him in the face,&#x201D; Richman said. Because of the fork stabbing incident, lost his job with the Wohls because &quot;he didn&#x2019;t want to go back there after that to ensure his safety.&quot; </p>

<p>It&apos;s unclear what set off the alleged fork stabbing, but this isn&apos;t the first time Wohl has been in trouble for getting aggressive. Last December, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130517065920/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/19/heiress_hurled_sober_companion_down.php">she was sued by</a> sober companion Heather McKean, who claimed that she threw her down a flight of stairs and choked her on March 5th. McKean had been hired by the family to help Wohl, who has struggled with addiction to drugs and alcohol. She is scheduled for a spinal-fusion operation this month.</p>
