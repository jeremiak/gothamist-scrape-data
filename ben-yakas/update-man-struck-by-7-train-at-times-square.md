<p>There <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427150514/http://new.mta.info/status/subway/7/22963088">are no 7 trains</a> running between Times Square and Queensboro Plaza for now. The MTA says the LIRR is crosshonoring fares at Penn Station and Woodside Station while the 7 train service is suspended. Check the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427150514/http://www.mta.info/">MTA website</a> for more updates.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: According to MTA, the 60-year-old man survived being struck by the train, and was taken to Bellevue Hospital in critical condition. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427150514/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/man_survives_after_jumping_square_EAevUWJoE0xnMDC3stgP4H">The Post adds that</a> he pushed two women out of the way before jumping in front of the 7 train: &#x201C;It was good luck because the train was coming slowly,&#x201D; an MTA worker noted.</p>
