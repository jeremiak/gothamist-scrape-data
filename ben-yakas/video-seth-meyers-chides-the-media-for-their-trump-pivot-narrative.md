<p>It seems that many in the media did not take <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170914140833/http://gothamist.com/2017/02/28/jon_stewart_trump_colbert.php">Jon Stewart&apos;s words of wisdom</a> to heart the other night. After Trump gave THE MOST PRESIDENTIALIST SPEECH IN THE HISTORY OF PIVOTS OF ALL TIME on Tuesday, pundits crawled over each other to declare Trump &quot;became the president of the United States,&quot; as if the inauguration and subsequent month of terrifying governmental incompetence didn&apos;t occur. &quot;I bet there are some Muslims and undocumented immigrants that would tell you he became president back in fucking January,&quot; Seth Meyers said in response last night.</p>

<p>&quot;As we know, Trump has spent the past year and a half lowering the bar when it comes to public speaking,&quot; Meyers said as he dove into Trump&apos;s speech. &quot;So the fact that Trump managed to sustain a muted tone, that, for any other politician would be considered unremarkable and even a little boring, was itself seen as a huge victory last night.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Seriously, do you have amnesia?&quot; he continued. &quot;Did you forget all the other times you&apos;ve said the exact same thing?&quot; After showing some clips of the media congratulating Trump for a similar pivot last year, Meyers quipped, &quot;And maybe Lucy really will let me kick the football this time.&quot; Watch below as Meyers dissects how Trump offers the same empty solutions and unsubstantial rhetoric, and the media continues to eat it up: &quot;Let&apos;s not get fooled again. We&apos;ve been here with Trump before.&quot;<br>

<p>Over on <em>Late Show With Stephen Colbert</em>, Colbert summed up Trump&apos;s true pivot succinctly: &quot;Yes, he shifted from unhinged narcissist to hinged narcissist. Here&apos;s the thing: Trump may have changed his tone, but that didn&apos;t change the content with what he said...you know who also said troubling things in a calm voice? Hannibal Lecter.&quot;</p>

<p>Colbert also turned back to his in-house fake news network, Real News Tonight, for the most positive spin on the speech.</p>

<p>And in a masterful sketch, Colbert teamed up with guest Patrick Stewart to stage a production of the classic <em>Waiting For Godot&#x2019;s Obamacare Replacement </em>.</p>
