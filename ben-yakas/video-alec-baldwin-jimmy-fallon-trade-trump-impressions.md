<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171007095959/http://gothamist.com/tags/alecbaldwin">Alec Baldwin</a> is set to host <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171007095959/http://gothamist.com/tags/snl"><em>Saturday Night Live</em></a> for a record 17th time this weekend, and he stopped by the <em>Standing Stock-Still On A Moving Burning Train Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon</em> yesterday to get ready for it with some light banter and game play. The best moment came in the middle of &quot;Box Of Lies,&quot; when Baldwin and Fallon started trading Trump impressions with one another&#x2014;Baldwin&apos;s impression came off way better compared to Fallon&apos;s mushy-mouth one.</p>

<p>The only other Trump reference came at the top of their interview, when Fallon complimented Baldwin on his suit: &quot;I got this suit from the Ivanka Trump Men&#x2019;s Collection at Nordstrom&#x2019;s. Big sale right now: 95 percent off of everything.&quot;</p>

<p>They also discussed Baldwin&apos;s forthcoming memoir and the origins of its title, <em>Nevertheless</em>. </p>

<p>Fallon might want to consider his place in the late night food chain, now that he&apos;s falling behind in the ratings <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171007095959/http://www.politico.com/story/2017/02/trump-comedians-late-night-234872">to more timely late night comedians.</a></p>

<p>Oh and in case you missed it, here&apos;s Baldwin&apos;s suitably dramatic SNL promo for tomorrow:</p>
