<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="42911handcuff.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110501213609im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/42911handcuff.jpg" width="230" height="205" class="image-left"> </span>Recently, there has been a spate of criticism of the NYPD after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110501213609/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/21/cops_cuff_7-year-old_special-ed_stu.php">they dragged</a> a seven-year-old out of his special-ed class in handcuffs. This wasn&apos;t the first time a child had been handcuffed by police, but if Assemblywoman Inez Barron has her way, it will be the last time.</p>

<p>Barron (D-Brooklyn) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110501213609/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/education/2011/04/29/2011-04-29_pol_introduces_bill_to_keep_the_cuffs_off_schoolkids_under_12_years_old.html">is planning</a> on introducing legislation to ban handcuffing children under age 12 on school property. Barron said she was still looking for a sponsor for her bill in the Senate, but City Councilman Charles Barron will be introducing a supporting resolution. Previously, Schools Chancellor Dennis Walcott said that what happened to seven-year-old Joseph Alexander was sad, but sometimes the situation called for such measures: &quot;There are opportunities that present themselves where a student may be in danger to either him or herself or to other students,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110501213609/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/04/22/joseph-anderson-handcuffed_n_852573.html">he said</a>. </p>

<p>If the legislation is approved, then a five-year-old will no longer be cuffed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110501213609/http://gothamist.com/2008/01/26/5yearold_cuffed.php">for a temper tantrum</a>, <br>
nor a seven-year-old <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110501213609/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/23/cops_have_cuffed_7-year-old_special.php">special education child</a>, nor a nine-year-old <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110501213609/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/13/mom_slams_school_for_handcuffing_9-.php">asthmatic kid</a>. However, the 13-year-old <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110501213609/http://gothamist.com/2010/02/05/junior_high_student_arrested_for_do.php">who doodled</a> on her desk, and is obviously a danger to the entire NYC school system, would still be out of luck.</p>
