<p>Last month, we received a dramatic photo of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429205753/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/20/photo_skateboarder_jumps_over_subwa.php">a skateboarder jumping over the tracks</a> at the 145th Street stop in Harlem. This photo, shot by Allen Ying, came from a video shoot for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429205753/http://mandibleclaw.blogspot.com/">MandibleClaw</a>. They wrote at the time, &quot;We waited till about 5 a.m. to get this trick but it was worth it. I wasn&#x2019;t sure Koki was going to do it when we went down, but after a few run ups he landed it first try.&quot; MandibleClaw (aka Colin Read) has now released a preview of their subway skateboarding video&#x2014;and as you can see, even master skateboarders don&apos;t make it over the tracks the first time.</p>

<p>&quot;People online have been saying he should&apos;ve come from the other side, so he wasn&apos;t going toward the third rail, but it would have been impossible,&quot; photographer Allen Ying explained <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429205753/http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2013/03/skateboarder-jumps-over-nyc-subway-tracks.html">to Daily Intel</a>. &quot;We had scouted the subway pretty well. <strong>This spot is probably the only one where that was doable</strong>.&quot;</p>

<p>According to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429205753/http://www.mta.info/nyct/TransitAdjudicationBureau.html">NYC Transit Rules of Conduct</a>, it&apos;s a violation just to STAND on a skateboard on the subway. Considering all the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429205753/http://gothamist.com/tags/subwayfatalities">subway fatalities</a>, we wouldn&apos;t recommend any amateur skateboarders try this out anytime soon. Having said that, check out ManibleClaw&apos;s previous subway skateboarding video from 2011 below:</p>
