<p>A clerk at a Brooklyn porn shop <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111120171814/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn-sex-shop-worker-killed-botched-robbery-cops-search-suspect-foot-air-article-1.980101">was beaten to death early this morning</a> in what cops believe was a botched robbery. The clerk, who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111120171814/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/klyn_porn_store_clerk_beaten_to_MKFWyMJbvvN12nLnU62VwJ">the Post identified as</a> Nemal Randunu and who was apparently in his 50s, was bludgeoned to death around 12:30 a.m. at  Video Xcitement Inc. on 3rd Avenue near 25th Street. &#x201C;I don&apos;t know what happened. The police are still looking into it, but it might have been a robbery,&#x201D; the owner of the 24-hour Sunset Park sex shop told the Daily News.</p>

<p>Authorities are now searching for a Hispanic male suspect, who they say came to Video Xcitement to rob the store. It&apos;s unclear what led to Randunu being clobbered on the head though&#x2014;he died inside the porn shop from massive head trauma, NYPD sources said. Police added that the suspect left the store with a black garbage bag stuffed with an unidentified object. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s very sad. He&#x2019;s a good guy. He came from Sri Lanka to make a living. He worked five or six nights a week here,&#x201D; said Vertino Rodriguez, who works in a liquor store across the street. </p>

One reader wrote us saying they were &quot;disgusted&quot; that the lede for their story refers to the victim as &quot;an over-the-hill porn store clerk.&quot; You can see a screenshot of the homepage lede below.</p>
