It is unclear what caused the shooting at around 8:15 p.m. Friday night, but according to the News, the five-year-old was mindlessly munching on Chicken McNuggets on Grand Avenue with other kids when he was shot in the leg. &quot;Everybody was out here chilling. All of a sudden, I heard the sound of gunshots. I just dived on the floor,&quot; said Adam Frias.</p>

<p>Four or five rounds went off as people ducked and ran for cover. &quot;One guy was bleeding and ran to the corner store [on W. Fordham Ave.]. The little kid was unconscious. One of his legs was bloody,&quot; said Joon Cecebe. In addition to the five-year-old, a 31-year-old woman was hit in her arm, and a 30-year-old man was shot in the calf. All the victims are expected to survive.</p>

<p>Last month, a five-year-old girl was also shot in the Bronx, also the victim of stray bullets stemming from an apparent gang fight. Last night, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623140934/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2011/06/11/2011-06-11_thug_nabbed_in_shooting_of_bx_girl_5.html">police arrested</a> Francisco Nunez, a Trinitario gang member, and charged him with attempted murder, assault and criminal possession of a weapon in the shooting. The little girl survived the bullet, but had part of her intestines removed.</p>
