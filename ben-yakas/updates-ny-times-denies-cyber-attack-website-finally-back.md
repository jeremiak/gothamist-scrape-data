<p>Have you ever had that nightmare where you&apos;re running away from some unspecific monster and then you suddenly start to fall, and then bombs start dropping from giant zeppelins and your teeth are all bursting like kernels of popcorn and the NY Times website is down? Well that nightmare has basically become a reality today: the NY Times website has been down for nearly an hour, and according <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131004233445/http://www.foxbusiness.com/technology/2013/08/14/new-york-times-site-experiences-major-outage/?cmpid=cmty_twitter_fb">to Fox Business</a>, it&apos;s under CYBER ATTACK.</p>

<p>Times spokesperson Danielle Rhodes Ha <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131004233445/http://bigstory.ap.org/article/new-york-times-website-goes-down">told AP</a> that the newspaper is looking into the cause of the outage, but offered no further details. The site also tweeted, &quot;The New York Times Web site is experiencing technical difficulties. We expect to be back up shortly.&quot; We&apos;re guessing that&apos;ll happen roughly one second after we click publish on this post.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: The NY Times has tweeted a very verbose update about the outage, promising it&apos;s not a cyber attack:</p>

<p>&quot;We will communicate further when we have more information&quot;? Certainly sounds like somebody wants to be cybering right about now. At least we have some assurances that the problem will be solved in a timely manner:</p>
