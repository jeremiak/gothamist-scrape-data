<p>In yet another instance that proves real life is, at best, just an extended commentary on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425173031/http://gothamist.com/tags/seinfeld"><em>Seinfeld</em></a>, the real Kenny Kramer has sued comedian and <em>Seinfeld</em> writer/actor Fred Stoller over the line &quot;not that there&apos;s anything wrong with that,&quot; the famous catchphrase from the show which was allegedly co-opted by Kramer on his &quot;Kramer&apos;s Reality Tour&quot; bus rides, and mentioned by Stoller in his autobiography, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425173031/https://twitter.com/Seinfeld2000">just imagen if Gorge and Jarry were still in TV today.</a></p>

<p>Let&apos;s back up a moment to get all the Seincontext out of the way: the line &quot;not that there&apos;s anything wrong with that&quot; came from the fourth season episode &quot;The Outing,&quot; which revolved around Jerry and George being mistaken for a gay couple. The landmark episode almost didn&apos;t happen because of fears of offending the gay community&#x2014;until writer Larry Charles casually mentioned the phrase, and Seinhistory was made.</p>

<p>Real life Kramer of course started his &quot;Kramer&apos;s Reality Tour&quot; and &quot;Kramer&apos;s Reality Road Show&quot; in the mid-90&apos;s to cash in on his fame as the inspiration for Michael Richards&apos;s character on the show. Stoller, who wrote for the show for a year and played <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425173031/http://seinfeld.wikia.com/wiki/Fred_Yerkes">Fred Yerkes</a> in the seventh season episode &quot;The Secret Code,&quot; published his autobiography <em>My Seinfeld Year</em> in 2012. </p>

<p>Real life Kramer apparently took some Seinumbrage with something Stoller wrote in the book: in his lawsuit, Kramer accuses Stoller of smearing him by claiming his tour guides would yell &quot;Not that there&apos;s anything wrong with that!&quot; at gay people while leading tours through Greenwich Village. If this sounds like the makings of a <em>Seinfeld</em> episode, well, Stoller would probably agree with you. When Stoller was asked about the lawsuit earlier this year, he sounded as confused as we are:</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425173031/http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv-movies/kenny-kramer-inspiration-kramer-seinfeld-files-1m-suit-article-1.1561825">Kramer told the News</a> that Stoller &quot;make me look like a total idiot&quot; in his Seinbook, singling out the &quot;nothing wrong with that&quot; anecdote and suing Stoller for $1 million. &quot;It&apos;s not funny. It&apos;s just nasty. He&apos;s worried about this affecting his business,&quot; said Kramer&apos;s lawyer, Fred Lichtmacher. &quot;He doesn&apos;t want to be viewed as a gay basher.&quot; </p>

<p>The suit was in court this week, where Lichtmacher confirmed that the tour was in an enclosed, air-conditioned bus, so...passersby wouldn&#x2019;t actually have been able to hear the line, if it even was said, and even if it was said, it was a direct reference to something on the show that was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425173031/http://books.google.com/books?id=CeqG46cYjuMC&amp;pg=PA191#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">a landmark TV moment</a> about homophobia and changing social values, but what do we know, we use BoscoLOL as our pin number. &#x201C;What if there&#x2019;s gay people on the bus?&#x201D; he countered. The judge added: &quot;What about the audience? Can we assume it&#x2019;s strictly <em>Seinfeld</em> fans who get it, who understand what it&#x2019;s all about?&quot; Only Seinfeld fans know that it is all about nothing, and nothing is all it is about, except for yadda yadda yadda or maybe the manssiere.</p>

<p>&quot;It&apos;s such a strained and artificial construction to say all of this is taunting of gays,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425173031/http://pagesix.com/2014/05/07/kramer-vs-comic-in-battle-over-seinfeld-gag/?_ga=1.226470682.1062663257.1383749145">said Stoller&apos;s Seinlawyer</a>, David Albert Pierce. &quot;It&apos;s a frivolous case. Talk about life imitating art. This is far more frivolous than any cases the character Kramer has ever brought.&quot;</p>

<p>We don&apos;t quite understand why saying the line would be considered gay bashing, but we&apos;ve seen <em>Seinfeld</em> before&#x2014;Lichtmacher, on the other hand, has only seen one episode (not the one in question), and isn&apos;t even a fan of the show, which makes us question whether he&apos;s even human, let alone sponge-worthy.</p>
