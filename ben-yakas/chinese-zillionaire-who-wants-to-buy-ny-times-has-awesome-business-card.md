<p>Kazillionaire Chen Guangbiao, one of the top 400 richest people in China, recently <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150613005602/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/01/business/media/chinese-businessman-announces-bid-to-buy-stake-in-times-co.html?_r=0">announced his intentions to buy</a> the NY Times with his gajillions of moneys. While the Times thus far has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150613005602/http://blogs.wsj.com/chinarealtime/2014/01/08/rebuffed-by-new-york-times-chinese-billionaire-chen-guangbiao-remains-undaunted/">respectfully declined</a> his requests for a meeting to discuss such an investment of gobagillions, if they got a better look at his business card, they might change their minds. Because clearly anyone who is a demolition expert, a moral leader, and the &quot;most influential person of China&quot; deserves a shot at the top of the masthead.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150613005602/http://www.businessinsider.com/chen-guangbiaos-incredible-business-card-2014-1">Business Insider got</a> a look at the bongbazillionaire&apos;s English-language business card, which doesn&apos;t even have room to mention the fact that Chen is also a singer (he starts off his press conferences with a song). <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150613005602/http://www.buzzfeed.com/peterlauria/why-a-chinese-tycoons-plans-to-buy-the-new-york-times-arent">According to Buzzfeed</a>, Chen said he was prepared to offer $1 billion for the Times at a press conference on Tuesday morning; by the end of the day, he was willing to increase his offer to $3 billion. Of course, this is where things get a little funky, because Chen reportedly has a personal wealth <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150613005602/http://www.businessinsider.com/chinese-recycling-tycoon-says-he-wants-to-buy-the-new-york-times-2013-12">around $740 million</a>, but swears he&apos;d be able to make $3 billion appear at a moment&apos;s notice, so who knows how many quattuordecillions he really has. </p>

<p>To be sure, Chen&apos;s pursuit of the NY Times is absurd any which way you cut it: why would anyone want to buy a newspaper in the 2014 media market <em>for $3 billion</em>? And why would the family-owned NY Times ever sell to a Chinese businessman known for his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150613005602/http://wiki.china.org.cn/wiki/index.php/Chen_Guangbiao">&quot;questionably motivated&quot;</a> philanthropic tactics? Then again, it&apos;s always smart to have an earthquake hero around the office, just in case. <br>
