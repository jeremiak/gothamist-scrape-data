<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502105950/http://www.septembereleven.net/">Gary Suson</a>, who calls himself the &#x201C;Official Photographer at Ground Zero for the Uniformed Firefighters Association,&#x201D; got exclusive access to the area in the months after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502105950/http://gothamist.com/tags/911">September 11th</a>. He later published a book of his photos, &quot;Requiem: Images of Ground Zero,&quot; and opened up the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502105950/http://www.groundzeromuseumworkshop.com/home.html">Ground Zero Museum Workshop</a> in the Meatpacking District with remnants from the site. When Suson opened the nonprofit museum in 2005, he said 9/11 charities would get &#x201C;the proceeds.&#x201D; But families of 9/11 victims <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502105950/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/kin_rip_fotog_blood_display_lgs1NXrGVIwa8a3ra9ingM?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Manhattan">told the Post that</a> it hasn&apos;t really happened: &#x201C;It&#x2019;s just appalling that people think they can make money off the pain and suffering of the surviving family members,&#x201D; said Al Santoro, a retired deputy chief who lost his 23-year-old firefighter son that day. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s just deplorable.&#x201D;</p>

<p>The price of tickets to the museum, located in a one-room loft on West 14th Street, is now $25 for adults, and $21.50 for kids (plus a $2.50 processing fee). Based on his tax returns, the Post found that Suson donated less than 6% of the profits from the museum to charities between 2008-2011, a period in which the museum made approximately $200K a year. </p>

<p>Then there is the matter of those remnants, which Suson has claimed he was given permission to take (you can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502105950/http://www.youtube.com/user/AmerikanHistory?feature=watch">watch several interviews with him here</a>): in his taped tour, he says &#x201C;artifacts were being thrown away...I asked permission of fire officers if I could salvage them. Luckily, they said yes.&#x201D; Among the items he has are a Path station clock, a twisted piece of fuselage from American Airlines Flight 11, chunks of World Trade Center window glass, eyeglass frames in a case, a burnt cellphone, a doll, a woman&#x2019;s dusty shoe, and a &#x201C;golf ball that sat on the desk of a stockbroker at Cantor Fitzgerald.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Former Deputy Chief Jim Riches, whose 29-year-old firefighter son Jimmy was killed on 9/11, disputes that claim: &#x201C;He wasn&#x2019;t given special permission to remove what he wanted from the site,&#x201D; Riches told the Post. &#x201C;No one was.&#x201D; Joe Soldevere, a spokesman for the city&#x2019;s Department of Design and Construction, which was in charge of the WTC recovery, agreed, saying it did not &#x201C;authorize anyone to take WTC artifacts.&#x201D;</p>
