</div></div>					<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141022210023/http://gothamist.com/tags/adoption">Adopting or fostering</a> abused, neglected, abandoned or forgotten animals is a mitzvah of the highest order&#x2014;but once you&apos;ve stared into the expressive face of a giant, elderly, droopy-eyed puppy (fact: all dogs are puppies), you will quickly realize that the animal was doing <em>you</em> a mitzvah all along, glueing together the pieces of your formerly abused, neglected, abandoned and forgotten heart with the slobber of love. That&apos;s just about how we felt when we saw the photos of the four dogs above&#x2014;and hopefully one of you will feel strong enough to give them a home.</p>

<p>The owner of these four dogs died on August 13th. The dogs were brought to the New York Animal Care and Control facility in Brooklyn. They include 10-year-old Mike, a Neapolitan Mastiff mix; Mick, a 10-year-old Neapolitan Mastiff mix; Maury, an 8-year-old Dogue De Bordeaux; and Marlon, another 8-year-old Dogue De Bordeax.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141022210023/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/4-Dogs-Brooklyn-Urgent-Need-New-Homes-Guardian-Dies-Euthanized-271846731.html?_osource=SocialFlowTwt_NYBrand">According to NBC</a>, both Mike and Mick are described as &quot;very friendly,&quot; while Marlon is said to be &quot;quiet, alert and responsive.&quot; However, Maury is said to be frightened in the shelter environment. That&apos;s Maury in the third photo above. LOOK AT POOR MAURY AND HIS AMAZING FACE.</p>

<p>The dogs are being evaluated for placement right now, but anything we can do to get them adopted, the quicker the better.
