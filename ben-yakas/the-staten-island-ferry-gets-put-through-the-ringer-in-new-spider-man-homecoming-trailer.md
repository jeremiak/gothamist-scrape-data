<p>There&apos;s no MGMT soundtrack <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170330180132/http://gothamist.com/2016/12/09/spiderman_homecoming_trailer.php">this time</a>, but Spider-Man Mach III (Tom Holland, RIP Tobey Maguire &amp; Andrew Garfield) is still obsessing about becoming an Avenger in the latest trailer for <em>Spider-Man: The High School Years: The Quest To Conjure Up The Spirit Of John Hughes</em>. </p>

<p>While the first trailer set the tone for the new Spider-Man series (see: JOHN HUGHES + MGMT x MARVEL CINEMATIC UNIVERSE), the latest one gives a much more clear indication of the plot, with Spidey trying to take on the Vulture (Michael Keaton) and his out-of-work, colorfully-named cronies (The Tinkerer, Shocker). Peter Parker disappoints his mentor (Robert Downey Jr&apos;s Iron Man), hangs with his high school friends, and learns some hard lessons about responsibility and power along the way.</p>
