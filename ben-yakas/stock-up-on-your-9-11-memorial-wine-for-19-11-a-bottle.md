<p>It&apos;s a product we could have imagined the perpetually classy 757 owner <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160727103116/http://gothamist.com/tags/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> spitballing while slicing up a double-layered pizza with knife and fork...and then <em>rejecting</em> for being unclassy. And yet, you can now drown your memories of that painful day with commemorative booze: a Long Island winery <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160727103116/http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/nationnow/2011/08/10th-anniversary-911-memorial-wine.html">has created a</a> 9/11 Memorial Commemorative Merlot and a 9/11 Memorial Commemorative Chardonnay. And each costs $19.11 a bottle if you buy directly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160727103116/http://www.liebcellars.com/our-wines/great-wines-for-good-causes.htm">from the winery</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160727103116/http://liebcellars.com/">Lieb Family Cellars</a>, who produced the wine, admit on the descriptions of the bottles that the grapes were grown &quot;90 miles from the site of the World Trade Center.&quot; But class knows no distances! The winery says they do plan to give 6 percent to 10 percent of the proceeds from the sale of these wines to the National September 11 Memorial and Museum. </p>

<p>Gary Madden, general manager of the winery, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160727103116/http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/nationnow/2011/08/10th-anniversary-911-memorial-wine.html">told the LA Times</a> that they&apos;ve &quot;probably donated $25,000&quot; already from sales of their September Mission Merlot, which only costs $9.11 a bottle&#x2014;in case you&apos;re not picking up on the theme of this particularly winery, they donate 91.1 cents of every bottle of that to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160727103116/http://www.septembersmission.org/">September&apos;s Mission foundation.</a></p>

<p>You can see more pictures of the wine <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160727103116/http://gawker.com/5832701/drown-your-sorrows-in-911-memorial-wine">here.</a> The product has inspired us to follow through on a long-forgotten dream of ours, and create a September 11 memorial malt liquor that you&apos;ll never forget: <em>Colt 9/11.</em></p>
