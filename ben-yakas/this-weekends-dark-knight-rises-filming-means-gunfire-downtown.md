<p>If you hear gunfire down by Zuccotti Park this weekend, DON&apos;T PANIC! It&apos;s <em>probably</em> not protesters fighting over the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161421/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/04/occupy_wall_street_now_has_porta-po.php">newly-installed porta potties.</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161421/http://gothamist.com/tags/thedarkknightrises"><em>The Dark Knight Rises</em></a> is back to filming in Manhattan on and around Wall Street this weekend&#x2014;and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161421/http://www.dnainfo.com/20111103/downtown/dark-knight-rises-shoot-brings-simulated-gunfire-wall-street">according to DNAInfo</a>, they&apos;ve posted notices around the neighborhood to let people know they&apos;ll be using fake gunfire.</p>

<p>&quot;The scenes we will be filming will have simulated gunfire and automatic weapon fire,&quot; the notice from Subconscious Productions said.
