<p>Last month, members of the group Answers Coalition <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150126044651/http://gothamist.com/2010/12/13/protesters_accuse_continental_bar_o.php">protested</a> outside of the Third Avenue bar the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150126044651/http://continentalnyc.com/clubinfo.html">Continental</a>, accusing the bar of having a racist door policy. Owner Trigger Smith was defiant in the face of their criticisms of his &quot;unwritten dress code,&quot; and there was another demonstration yesterday outside the club. And now, it seems that the City Commission on Human Rights has been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150126044651/http://eastvillage.thelocal.nytimes.com/2011/01/21/bar-is-subject-of-bias-investigation/">investigating</a> the allegations of racial discrimination.</p>

<p>Smith, who is white, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150126044651/http://eastvillage.thelocal.nytimes.com/2011/01/21/bar-is-subject-of-bias-investigation/">told The Local</a> that he would fully cooperate with the investigation, but denies that there is any racial bias in his door policy: &#x201C;There&#x2019;s not a prejudiced bone in my body.&quot; Nevertheless, he refuses to talk to protesters, said that he would not comply with the coalition&#x2019;s request that he post a statement opposing discrimination on Continental&#x2019;s web site, won&apos;t host multicultural themed nights at the club, and plans on continuing his unwritten dress code, which prohibits saggy jeans, open-laced sneakers, and &quot;blingy&quot; necklaces or sideways caps. &#x201C;It just so happens that more minorities wear these,&quot; he said. But countless posts on Facebook <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150126044651/http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=58211944728&amp;v=wall">message group</a> &quot;Boycott Continental Bar in NYC&quot; disagree with Smith&apos;s assessment, including one man who says he was denied entry this past Friday: &quot;Just got denied 2 hours ago because me and my friends were black....ridiculous.&quot;</p>
