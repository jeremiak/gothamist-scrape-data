<p>From the tempting-fate files: according to law enforcement officials, pickpocketing is an old man&apos;s game, and it&apos;s dying out. Nearly all &quot;career pickpockets&quot; known to prey on riders in Manhattan&apos;s subways are in their 40s and 50s, transit detectives <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160301235607/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/11/14/2010-11-14_no_future_in_picking_pockets.html">tell the News</a>. And it seems that the younger folk don&apos;t much care for the risks involved with the age-old profession...except maybe when it comes to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160301235607/http://gothamist.com/2010/11/10/cell_phone_thieves_on_the_loose_nea.php">cell phones</a>.</p>

<p>&quot;You don&apos;t find young picks anymore. It&apos;s going to die out,&quot; said NYPD Transit Bureau Detective Nelson Dones. Among the bald or nearly-bald master pickpockets are a 63-year-old man with a gray handlebar mustache, a 75-year-old, and presumably 78-year-old <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160301235607/http://gothamist.com/2009/11/30/warrant_issued_for_elderly_grifter.php">Katherine Kelly</a>, who has been arrested at least 37 times. It was a skill which the older generation used to pass down to younger people, with a kind of apprenticeship relationship. These criminals are proud of their trade; they consider it an insult to be called a &quot;lush worker,&quot; which is the term used for picks who prey on drunken riders who pass out on trains. </p>

<p>And this isn&apos;t just about not having means or opportunity; even if you offered them a job, Dones doesn&apos;t think they&apos;d change their stripes: &quot;I don&apos;t believe if you offered them a decent job with a 401(k) plan, any would take it. <strong>In 30 years, I&apos;ve never found a person who is a pickpocket say they&apos;ve changed their life around, say they&apos;ve found Jesus or a better way of life.&quot;</strong> But did the News jinx it by declaring pickpocketing dead?</p>
