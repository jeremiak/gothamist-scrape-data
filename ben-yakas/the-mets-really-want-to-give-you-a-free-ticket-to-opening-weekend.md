<p>It may not feel like spring outside, but opening day for the 2014 MLB season is just about here! The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429152159/http://gothamist.com/tags/yankees">Yankees</a> will embark on their Farewell Jeter campaign on Tuesday against the Astros, while the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429152159/http://gothamist.com/tags/mets">Mets</a> open the season against the Washington Nationals on Monday. But the Mets are more concerned about getting butts in seats <em>next</em> weekend. They <em>really</em> want you to come to Citi Field for opening weekend against the Cincinnati Reds&#x2014;so much so, that they are literally giving free tickets away to anyone who follows them on Twitter.</p>

<p>Anyone who follows @Mets and @SNYtv on Twitter will receive a &quot;complimentary Mets ticket in the Promenade courtesy of SNY to one of the opening weekend (Saturday, April 5 &amp; Sunday, April 6) games when the Mets host the Reds.&quot; In addition, they also have a special &quot;Buy One Ticket, Get One Ticket Free&quot; offer available for opening weekend in various seating locations. You can see <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429152159/http://newyork.mets.mlb.com/nym/ticketing/tweet_a_ticket.jsp?partnerId=as_nym_20140327_20813514">more details about the offers here.</a></p>

<p>The Mets have gotten progressively better at utilizing social media to fill seats: they&apos;ve made <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429152159/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/31/video_mets_make_harlem_shake_video.php#photo-1">goofy Harlem Shake videos</a> (this is still progress), unleashed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429152159/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/16/video_mets_ace_matt_harvey_asks_bas.php">Matt Harvey on Fallon</a>, and even hosted a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429152159/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/11/photos_the_mets_had_a_giant_slumber.php#photo-1">giant slumber party.</a> Let&apos;s hope things go better this opening weekend than they did two years ago, when they also offered a buy-one-get-one-free deal and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429152159/http://nypost.com/2012/04/05/mets-in-opening-day-ticket-panic/">still couldn&apos;t sell out the park opening day.</a></p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: When we spoke to a Mets spokesperson this morning, the free tickets were still available, but they seem to have sold out for now (but keep checking in case they release some more in the coming days). However, the buy-one-get-one-free deal is still available. </p>
