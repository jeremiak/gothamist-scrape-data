<p>This week, we saw a photo of a group of young ladies <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509174553/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/31/photo_this_is_not_how_your_should_w.php">striking a pose while waiting on the subway tracks</a>. It was a perfect example of what to do if you want to end up on the cover of the dallies as yet another sad statistic on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509174553/http://gothamist.com/tags/subwayshoving">subway deaths.</a> If you ever were curious about what it looks like when you&apos;re on the tracks as a subway arrives at a station, don&apos;t give in to the urge to experience in real life&#x2014;just watch the video below (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509174553/http://www.reddit.com/r/nyc/comments/17saet/mta_track_training_class_new_workers_are_required/">via Reddit</a>), as one person watches an R train fly by as part of their MTA Track Training.</p>

<p>The uploader notes, &quot;I was standing 6 inches away from a moving Subway train.&quot; All MTA safety inspectors, or anyone that works closely with the subways, are required to pass an eight hour training course designed to teach participants how to safely walk and work on the tracks. You can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509174553/http://www.nycdistrictcouncil.com/mta-track-safety-training.aspx">learn more about it here</a>, but one of their tasks is that they have to walk from one station to another; whenever a train comes, they must find a niche along the wall (or under the platform) to stand.</p>

<p>A Reddit user <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509174553/http://www.reddit.com/r/nyc/comments/17remo/at_west_4th_last_nightthese_guys_have_no_fear/">posted this photo</a> of some track workers doing just that the other day. Considering all the incidents with people being shoved, or falling, into the tracks, it might be good for the MTA to explore a way of educating straphangers a bit more about these niches, and exactly where to stand if a train is coming.</p>
