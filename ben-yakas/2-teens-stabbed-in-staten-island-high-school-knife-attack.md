A third teen, 16-year-old Larry Adeyanju, was arrested and charged with felony assault and criminal possession of a weapon. According to police, Adeyanju was hauled to the dean&apos;s office at Curtis High School after the stabbings&#x2014;where he made a very unsuccessful attempt at hiding the bloody knife. It sounds like teens at the school aren&apos;t very surprised by the incident, or the increase in security thereafter: &#x201C;It&#x2019;s Curtis. We&#x2019;ll get over it,&#x201D; said freshman Raquel Rodriguez.<p></p>

<p>All three teens involved in the attack live together in a community residence in New Brighton. One victim, a 15-year-old, suffered stab wounds to his chest and abdomen, while the other, an 18-year-old, was stabbed in his left arm&#x2014;the victims are stepbrothers, as well. Department of Education spokeswoman Margie Feinberg confirmed the incident took place, and added that it spilled outside of Curtis High School: &#x201C;There was a fight in the school and it continued outdoors. Two students were stabbed and taken to the hospital. A suspect has been arrested. The school is cooperating with police.&#x201D;</p>
