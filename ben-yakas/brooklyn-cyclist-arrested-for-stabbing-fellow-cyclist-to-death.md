<p>A Brooklyn cyclist has been arrested for allegedly stabbing a fellow cyclist to death. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406153538/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/man-stabs-fellow-bicyclist-death-brooklyn-brawl-article-1.1448537">According to the News</a>, 22-year-old Royston French fatally stabbed 29-year-old Keith Daniels during an argument on E. 34th Street (near Beverly Road) in East Flatbush on August 27th.</p>

<p>French, Daniels and two other cyclists were all riding in that area around 7:30 p.m. that day when the argument started. It&apos;s unclear what prompted the fight between the two men (or whether they knew each other beforehand), but as Daniels walked back to his bike, French allegedly came up behind him and plunged a knife into his side. French fled the scene on his bike; police found Daniels there, and he was rushed to Kings County Hospital, where he died.</p>

<p>French was arrested by police on Friday, and has now been charged with murder and criminal possession of a weapon.</p>
