<p>Mayor Bloomberg has made <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429011527/http://gothamist.com/2010/08/03/bloomberg_chokes_up_during_ground_z.php">no secret of his support</a> for the would-be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429011527/http://gothamist.com/tags/mosque">&quot;Ground Zero Mosque,&quot;</a> a proposed Islamic community center for lower Manhattan that isn&apos;t actually at Ground Zero. But the dallies seem <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429011527/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/emails_show_bloomberg_office_desire_y3VfyeNsKALjUHguKwt2fO">mildly</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429011527/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/12/23/2010-12-23_bloombergs_aides_provided_political_support_for_ground_zero_mosque_released_emai.html">shocked</a> by the &quot;revelation&quot; that his administration was actively trying to help Imam Feisal Abdul Rauf make the Park 51 project a reality. Among the emails released yesterday include a drafted letter written by Community Affairs Commissioner Nazli Parvizi for Rauf&apos;s wife, Daisy Khan, to send to Community Board 1, which was voting on the project at the time. </p>

<p>However, Community Board 1 Chairwoman Julie Menin says her board never even received the letter-in-question from Khan, and the Mayor&apos;s involvement &quot;certainly didn&apos;t change the way we view the project.&quot; Another email stated that Immigrant Affairs Commissioner Fatima Shama expedited a temporary public assembly permit for the group to conduct prayers in January; another email noted that organizers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429011527/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704278404576038090585417146.html?mod=googlenews_wsj">agreed to fund </a> a 2009 Ramadan event, Iftar, at Gracie Mansion.   </p>

<p>Critics of the mosque charge that this proves the administration was in collusion with the project&apos;s backers to rig public opinion, but Bloomberg spokesman Stu Loeser said today that these kinds of assistance were typical of the regular work of the Community Affairs department. </p>
