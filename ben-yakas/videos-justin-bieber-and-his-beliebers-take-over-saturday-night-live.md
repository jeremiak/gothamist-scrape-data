Every week, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160515112536/http://gothamist.com/tags/snl"><em>Saturday Night Live</em></a> is pretty dependable for a few laughs interspersed among incredibly varied qualities of sketches&#x2014;it&apos;s always better when they ramp up their surreal tendencies and downplay their least likable ongoing sketches (looking at you, &quot;The Californians&quot;). But it&apos;s become much rarer to have a front-to-back good episode&#x2014;and this week&apos;s installment, hosted by Justin Bieber, was definitely not one. And a lot of that was due to the fact that despite him not being a very funny or comfortable host, the audience was filled with Beliebers&#x2014;they ate up any awkward, pandering thing he gave them (flashing his abs, singing a capella, saying he was sorry for smoking weed).</p>

<p>But there were highlights: Kenan Thompson was fantastic as &#x201C;that one black guy in every commercial&#x201D; on Weekend Update; the Bieber-mocking sketch featuring all the Bieber decoys seemed to have some real tension between the star and the performers (unfortunately, this sketch is not online); and despite it being a one-note joke, we kinda loved the yell-happy &quot;GLICE&quot; sketch. Taran Killam was sorta channeling Chris Farley! A lot of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160515112536/http://fuckyeahglice.tumblr.com/">other people</a> seemed to like it too, it seems.</p>

<p>Click through for those sketches, plus a Super Bowl cold open, Bieber&apos;s Valentine, the antics of Taco, Bravo&apos;s newest reality shows, the return of the very adult The Miley Cyrus Show, a &quot;Grease&quot; parody, Weekend Update, and Bieber performing two songs that we definitely didn&apos;t mute, no sir.</p>
