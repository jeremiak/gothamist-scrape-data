<p>Whatever you thought of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508164758/http://gothamist.com/tags/jeremylin">Jeremy Lin&apos;s</a> all-too-brief stint in NYC last year&#x2014;whatever you thought of the way he left the team and the money it would have cost to keep him&#x2014;there&apos;s no denying that Lin singlehandedly reinvigorated the Knicks franchise and season, captivating the city and connecting with fans in a way that stars Carmelo Anthony and Amare Stoudemire never could. There&apos;s no better proof of that than the five-year-old in the videos below&#x2014;the first video shows Naim having a serious breakdown over Lin leaving. Lin was touched by the video, contacted the family, and ended up meeting Naim via Skype, encouraging him to keep rooting for the Knicks. &#x201C;They&#x2019;re going to be a great team with or without me, alright?&#x201D; Lin says to the kid. &#x201C;You have to keep going to their games and watching them. They&#x2019;ll be really good.&#x201D;</p>

<p>While Naim doesn&apos;t know enough to understand the grim reality of luxury taxes, salary caps, and the wild mercury sound of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508164758/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/04/video_james_dolan_sings_his_new_hit.php">JD and the Straight Shot</a>, he has now learned the most important lesson when it comes to being a Knicks fan: it sucks being a Knicks fan. Almost as much as it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508164758/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/18/video_6-year-old_realizes_its_very.php">sucks being a Jets fan.</a></p>
