We&apos;re headed into the third season, which is an adaptation of the much-loved third book (or at least <em>half</em> of that book), and you can be assured that many heads will roll as the season progresses. But wait, you say&#x2014;what if I haven&apos;t read the books, don&apos;t obsess over every tidbit of casting news (Diana Riggs <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506102142/http://hbowatch.com/diana-rigg-cast-as-the-queen-of-thorns-for-game-of-thrones-season-three/">as Queen of Thorns</a>? Perfect), and can&apos;t quite remember where we left off with season 2? Worry not young wargs: below, check out who&apos;s dead and who&apos;s still alive. But beware, because spoilers are coming.</p>

<p>First off, go ahead and watch a recap of season 2 with Executive Producers, D.B. Weiss and David Benioff. Or watch The Daily Beast&apos;s much <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506102142/http://www.thedailybeast.com/videos/2013/03/26/game-of-thrones-in-three-minutes.html?source=socialflow&amp;account=thedailybeast&amp;medium=twitter">more streamlined version.</a> </p>
