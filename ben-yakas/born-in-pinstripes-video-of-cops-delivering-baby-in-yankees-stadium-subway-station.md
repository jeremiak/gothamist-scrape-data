But really, if you were forced to choose, wouldn&apos;t you rather be born near Yankees Stadium than CitiField? Baby Maxwell was born at 10:25 a.m. inside the 161st Street station after mom Tamika Snipe went into labor on the 4 train. You can see SFW cell phone video of it below.</p>

<p>&quot;She had some pain. The contractions got worse, so she got off the train. A woman came in and said the woman&apos;s water broke and she was in labor,&#x201D; NYPD Lt. Sylvia Mendoza <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504151249/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/bronx/good_catch_cops_deliver_baby_at_DWAB9Rs3waY4pQrjj5fAaN">told the Post</a>. Snipe, 21, was transported to the station. &quot;The mother said the baby was coming. She felt the head coming out. Two female officers assisted the mother, took off her pants and shoes and the baby was crowning,&quot; Mendoza said. Afterwards, the mom and her newborn were taken to Columbia Presbyterian Hospital in stable condition. No word on whether any babies born in the vicinity of Yankees stadium <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504151249/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/13/after_you_sleep_with_derek_jeter_yo.php">automatically get signed Derek Jeter balls</a>.</p>
