<p>At this point, we really feel a little bad for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503154331/http://gothamist.com/tags/chrischristie">Chris Christie</a>&#x2014;he might be a political bully with backwards views on social reforms, but he&apos;s also a human being with feelings. And sometimes these feelings take the form of delusions, such as his ongoing delusion that he and his favorite musician, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503154331/http://gothamist.com/tags/brucespringsteen/1">Bruce Springsteen</a>, are best friends. Christie <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503154331/http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2014/08/chris_christie_spars_with_nj_woman_over_bruce_springsteen.html">got into an argument at a town hall meeting</a> yesterday with a woman who claimed that Springsteen had asked Christie to stop using his music at political events. Christie&apos;s response: NA NA NA I CAN&apos;T HEAR YOU NA NA NA.</p>

<p>Here&apos;s his actual response, which isn&apos;t much more eloquent (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503154331/http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2014/08/chris-christie-loses-it-over-bruce-springsteen.html">via Daily Intel</a>): &quot;No. Never did that. Nah, you&#x2019;re wrong about that. Bruce has never asked me to do that. I saw Bruce about a week and a half ago. And he had every opportunity to tell me not to. He didn&#x2019;t and he never has,&quot; Christie said. &quot;Bruce has never asked me to do that.&quot;</p>

<p>Here&apos;s the rest of that glorious exchange:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;Nah, listen. I know him, and you&#x2019;re wrong. I understand you&#x2019;re now expressing your politics. You&#x2019;re now expressing your politics and your objection, and that&#x2019;s fine. Don&#x2019;t put it in Mr. Springsteen&#x2019;s mouth &#x2014; put it in yours.

<p>I know Bruce and I spoke to Bruce and you&#x2019;re wrong. When I leave, just so we can have this lady be a little calmer, let&#x2019;s play Bon Jovi on the way out.&quot;</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>To recap: Christie has seen Springsteen perform <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503154331/http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2012/06/chris-christie-really-really-still-loves-bruce.html">more than 130 times</a>. He has (unsuccessfully) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503154331/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/09/nyregion/09bruce.html?_r=1&amp;ref=nyregion">begged Springsteen</a> to play his inauguration. He&apos;s sung &quot;Thunder Road&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503154331/http://gothamist.com/2012/09/05/video_chris_christie_and_jimmy_fall.php">with Jimmy Fallon</a>. He has hugged The Boss once (a hug <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503154331/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/07/video_chris_christie_tells_jon_stew.php">he gushed about on The Daily Show</a>), and he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503154331/http://www.cbsnews.com/news/nj-gov-chris-christie-weeps-after-meeting-bruce-springsteen/">wept after meeting him.</a> And Springsteen has returned all that affection <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503154331/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/15/video_bruce_springsteen_jimmy_fallo.php">by making fun of him</a> on national television. </p>

<p>And yet still, there&apos;s only one man <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503154331/http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2012/07/jersey-boys/309019/">who Christie would go gay for</a>, were he gay (and ya know, were gay marriage legal in his state).</p>
