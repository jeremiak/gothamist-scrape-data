<p>A dolphin stranded on a beach on Long Island was successfully rescued on Thursday. According <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130614083622/https://www.facebook.com/riverheadfoundation">to The Riverhead Foundation</a>, a boater spotted the Risso dolphin on a sandbar near Fire Island around noon that day. The 600-pound, 9-foot-long female dolphin appeared to be &quot;severely underweight and compromised,&quot; and was unable to move out of the sandbar on Oak Beach. You can see a video of the subsequent rescue&#x2014;which included loading the dolphin on a stretcher for transport&#x2014;below.</p>

<p>Thankfully, the dolphin survived the transport: &quot;She is currently swimming on her own within the hospital tank at the Long Island Aquarium,&quot; Riverhead said. Rescue Program director Kimberly Durham <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130614083622/http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2013/06/07/dolphin-rescued-from-long-island-sandbar/?mod=WSJBlog">told the Journal that</a> the dolphin is about 100 pounds underweight, and it could have a two month recovery ahead before they can let it back into the wild.  &#x201C;We still have a very long road ahead of us - a very expensive road, it turns out,&#x201D; she said, noting that this kind of dolphin typically eats 80 pounds ($200 worth) of squid per day.</p>

<p>There have been quite a few dolphin sightings around the city this year already: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130614083622/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/17/photos_videos_there_are_two_dolphin.php#photo-1">multiple dolphins</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130614083622/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/13/breaking_dolphin_spotted_in_east_ri.php">were spotted</a> in the East River on the Upper East Side; and a dolphin <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130614083622/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/25/the_dolphin_trapped_in_the_gowanus.php">tragically died</a> after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130614083622/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/25/bdolphin_reportedly_stranded_in_the.php#photo-1">getting stuck</a> in the Gowanus Canal in January.</p>
