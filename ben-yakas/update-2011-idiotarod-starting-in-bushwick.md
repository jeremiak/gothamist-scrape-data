Check-in is at 10:53 a.m., and the race start time is scheduled for 11:30 a.m. Organizers remind that, &quot;There is NO FOOD THROWING. Do not bring food to throw, it will be taken from you.

The after party is at coco66 in greenpoint!&quot; You can see some more pictures <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111126142827/http://www.flickr.com/photos/27594459@N04/5398774280/">here</a>, and we&apos;ll have photos from Katie up soon!</p>
