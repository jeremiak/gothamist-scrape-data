<p>It seems like only yesterday we were debating term limits and soda bans, but my how the time flies: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130220131446/http://gothamist.com/tags/mayorbloomberg">Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg</a> will give his 12th and final State of the City address today. Assuming, of course, he doesn&apos;t pull a wildcard and announce he&apos;s running for a 4th term. You can watch it below starting at noon&#x2014;we already know he&apos;ll focus <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130220131446/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/14/bloomberg_last_ban_mayors_final_sta.php">on the styrofoam menace</a>, and we know that he&apos;ll enter to Jay-Z&apos;s &quot;Empire State Of Mind&quot; (not a joke). But will he wear a comfort sweater? Will Lydia Callis translate? Will he develop a case of Senioritis, flip on a pair of sunglasses, and flip everyone off? You&apos;ll have to watch below to find out.</p>
