<p>Ned&apos;s head is on a stick, Jon Snow looks appropriately sad, Cersei is drunk, and Melisandre is still yammering on about the Lord of Light&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428172459/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/29/who_is_still_alive_going_into_seaso.php"><em>Game Of Thrones</em> is back tonight</a>! And with it comes more of that special something that places <em>GoT</em> above all its other premium cable competitors: sexposition (the art of peppering otherwise dry narrative dumps with nudity and sex scenes). <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428172459/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/28/game_of_thrones.php#photo-1">Gothamist&apos;s favorite actress Natalie Dormer</a>, aka Margaery Tyrell, told the Post it is what it is: <strong>&#x201C;The work is the work, that&#x2019;s the way it is.&#x201D; </strong> You can see a NSFW compilation of the show&apos;s greatest sexposition hits below.</p>

<p>In an interview <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428172459/http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv-movies/natalie-dormer-soaks-moment-game-thrones-article-1.1303202?localLinksEnabled=false">with the News</a>, Dormer gave more details about what it&apos;s like on set when those scenes come up: &#x201C;They put us all up in the same hotel whether we&#x2019;re (filming) in Croatia or Belfast, so pretty much the person who has a sex scene at the end of the week is the person who&#x2019;s in the gym or not coming out for dinner,&#x201D; she told them, laughing. You can read an excellent, detailed interview with Dormer all about Margaery&apos;s place in the world of GoT <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428172459/http://www.hitfix.com/the-fien-print/interview-game-of-thrones-co-star-natalie-dormer-discusses-her-margaery-tyrell">at Hitfix.</a></p>

<p>In an interview <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428172459/http://www.motherjones.com/media/2013/03/hbo-game-thrones-season-3-interview-david-benioff-dan-weiss">with Mother Jones</a>, series creators David Benioff and Dan Weiss discuss walking a fine line with it: &quot;Personally, I pay less attention to intricate plot points delivered during sex scenes,&quot; Benioff joked when asked whether people pay closer to attention to scenes with nudity. &quot;Yes, that&apos;s a tricky line to walk,&quot; added Weiss. &quot;Sex grabs people&apos;s attention. But once it has their attention, it tends not to let go of it.&quot; But both posited that George R. R. Martin&apos;s books are chockfull of even more extreme sexual situations, something which Gothamite and Martin aficionado David Jacobs agrees with wholeheartedly: <strong>&quot;The oft-parodied levels of sex and violence in the show are taken to an even higher level in the books.&quot;</strong></p>

<p>Esme Bianco, who plays the whore Ros who has become a favorite of Littlefinger, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428172459/http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/05/18/game-of-thrones-esm-bianco-talks-about-ros-sexposition-nudity-and-more.html">was also sensitive</a> to criticisms of the sexposition scenes, many of which she has been in: &#x201C;The books are not an easy read. They are brutal and have their fair share of sex in them. It would be na&#xEF;ve to think that HBO would take a story in that genre and just do the safe &#x2026;version of it. That scene is beautifully shot and shows quite clearly the kind of world that the characters are living in.&#x201D;</p>

<p>New cast member Ciaran Hinds, who plays the much-talked-about leader of the Wildings, Mance Rayder, sounded much more put off by the sexposition <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428172459/http://www.irishcentral.com/ent/Interview-with-Irish-actor-Ciaran-Hinds---star-of-Cat-on-a-Hot-Tin-Roof-with-Scarlet-Johansson-187186871.html">in an interview with Irish Central</a>: &#x201C;I saw the first series and I found some of the sexuality and violence a little gratuitous and it annoyed me but then it calmed down a bit, but the storytelling and the juggling of the storylines are fantastic. It draws you in and takes you elsewhere.&#x201D; We&apos;re a little surprised by his reaction, considering the fact he starred in another sex-friendly HBO classic, <em>Rome</em>. </p>

<p>But fellow actor John Bradley, who plays the bumbling Night&apos;s Watch member Samwell Tarly, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428172459/http://www.nypost.com/p/pagesix/the_game_is_on_024fwpNy8NPyJUxpdXC38J">told the Post</a> he was much less apprehensive about more nudity: &#x201C;I hope so. If not, I&#x2019;m going to be sorely disappointed.&#x201D; Something tells us he really gets on with 13-year-old show consultant Adam Friedberg:</p>
