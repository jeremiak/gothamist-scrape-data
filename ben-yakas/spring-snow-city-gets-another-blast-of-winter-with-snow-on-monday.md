<p>Spring may have started last Wednesday, but did you know &quot;Spring&quot; is Latin for &quot;Lie?&quot; According to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509172757/http://www.accuweather.com/en/weather-news/snow-slush-rain-for-dc-philly/8767309">weather alarmists</a>, the city will be hit with <em>more</em> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509172757/http://gothamist.com/tags/snow">snow</a> tomorrow. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509172757/http://www.weather.com/weather/tomorrow/10025">The Weather Channel</a> says we have a 90% chance of snow, which the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509172757/http://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?CityName=New+York&amp;state=NY&amp;site=OKX&amp;textField1=40.7198&amp;textField2=-73.993&amp;e=1">National Weather Service</a> puts at 1-4 inches. Some overenthusiastic sites even say we&apos;ll get &quot;at least a half foot of heavy, wet snow.&quot;</p>

<p>And like clockwork, we just received this latest update: &quot;*WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY* FOR NYC AND L.I. FROM 6AM MONDAY THRU MIDNIGHT. 1-3 INCHES OF SNOW MAY ACCUMULATE.&quot; As if we didn&apos;t already have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509172757/http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/03/21/punxsutawney-phil-indicted-in-ohio/2008163/">enough evidence to convict Punxsutawney Phil</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509172757/http://www.theonion.com/articles/punxsutawney-phil-beheaded-for-inaccurate-predicti,31712/">mount his head on a tiny, adorable pike.</a> </p>

<p>But let&apos;s try to view this positively&#x2014;maybe Mother Nature knows you never bothered to bust out that sled this winter. Let&apos;s assume that this is going to be our <em>last</em> real snow of the season (...which maybe is an assumption <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509172757/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/10/sayonara_snow_the_last_snow_timelap.php">we shouldn&apos;t make</a>, but oh well), and do all those wintery things we meant to do: go ice skating, build a diminutive snowman, drink hot chocolate, make smores, get in a snowball fight, eat some matzo ball soup, celebrate Passover, you know&#x2014;all the things you&apos;d do if you only had tomorrow off. </p>
