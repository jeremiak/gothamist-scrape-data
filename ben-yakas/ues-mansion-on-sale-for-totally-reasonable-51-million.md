<p>The seven-story, 16,000-sq-foot building is located at 12 East 79th Street between Fifth and Madison Avenues. It was built by the Ogden family between 1901-1903, and was originally designed as two separate homes for siblings Charles and Mary Ogden. It was bought by the UK-based <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140215045547/http://www.philosophyworks.org/landing/">School of Practical Philosophy</a> in 1975, who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140215045547/http://secretoflife.typepad.com/the_secret_of_life/2007/04/practical_philo.html">have been accused</a> of being a &quot;cult&quot;&#x2014;thought the Times said in 2010 that if it is, it&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140215045547/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/17/nyregion/17critic.html">an unsuccessful one.</a>  </p>

<p>The apartment includes an elevator, a roof garden, another garden, a basement, iron fences, open urns, broad low stoops, and service entries on the lower level. And hey, with the leftover money you didn&apos;t spend on the single most expensive apartment in NYC, you can build your own waterfall slide contraption.</p>
