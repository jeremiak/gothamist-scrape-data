<p>According <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140823115105/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/camper_mac_attack_IErwi9aOGMCPDdYJw2WcyI">to the NY Post</a>, an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140823115105/http://gothamist.com/tags/occupywallstreet">Occupy Wall Street</a> protester had a temper tantrum in the McDonald&apos;s near Zuccotti Park yesterday, after employees allegedly refused to give him free food. Fisika Bezabeh, 27, allegedly ripped a credit-card reader from a counter and threw it at workers just after 2 a.m. last night (could he have an relation to boxer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140823115105/http://boxrec.com/list_bouts.php?human_id=483458&amp;cat=boxer">Fasika Bezabeh</a>?). However, the Post specifies that Bezabeh was only &quot;seen hanging out&quot; with protesters, so it&apos;s unclear whether he actually is part of OWS, or just one of a growing number of rabble rousers who have descended upon Zuccotti to stir up trouble and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140823115105/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/04/video_deranged_man_kicks_tents_at_o.php">inspire some fun headlines for the rag</a>.</p>

<p>After all, the Post hasn&apos;t exactly been Occupy Wall Street&apos;s biggest fan since its inception&#x2014;but their contempt for OWS has blossomed this week into an all-out hit job, with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140823115105/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/04/video_deranged_man_kicks_tents_at_o.php">catty cover headlines</a> (&quot;Zoo-Cotti!&quot;), <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140823115105/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/03/the_ny_post_hates_occupy_wall_stree.php">bitter editorials</a>, and lots of exclusives about &quot;protesters&quot;&#x2014;or you know, anyone hanging out in lower Manhattan, regardless of associations&#x2014;behaving badly.</p>

<p>To that end, they also report today that, as their misleading headline put it, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140823115105/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/occupy_bum_busted_for_peeing_on_0yHGf6v1Sye9rAWwCaWu2O">&quot;&apos;Occupy&apos; bum busted for peeing on cop car.&quot;</a> But in the story itself, they clarify that 26-year-old Edgar Rivera is a drunken man who has &quot;been crashing with the Occupy Wall Street protesters&quot; was arrested for urinating on an NYPD van parked next to Zuccotti Park. But hey, this <em>is</em> a newspaper who labels a photo of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140823115105/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/05/nypd_vehicle_kills_87-year-old_ww_i.php">a WWII veteran struck and killed</a> by an NYPD car <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140823115105/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/klyn_rev_mowed_down_by_cop_car_0CziuTT5bHvG2HvmbAjwDI">as &quot;geezerkilled&quot;.</a> Right click on the photo for a healthy dollop of outrage. </p>
