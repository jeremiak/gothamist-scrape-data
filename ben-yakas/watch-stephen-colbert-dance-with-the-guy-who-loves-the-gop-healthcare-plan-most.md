<p>After months of playing footsie with the electorate about their plans to repeal-and-replace Obamacare, Republicans finally unveiled their healthcare plan (aka &quot;Obamacare Lite&quot;) this week. Stephen Colbert immediately got into the nitty gritty last night: &quot;So this bill is going to be like those fancy restaurants where they don&apos;t have what it costs on the menu?&quot; </p>

<p>He also pointed out that the plan will cover &quot;20 million fewer Americans than Obamacare,&quot; and he has a hard time imagining who could possibly be happy with this plan&#x2014;well, except for the Grim Reaper of course. After having a jolly dance with him, Colbert added, &quot;Where was I? Oh yeah, we&apos;re all going to die.&quot;</p>

<p>In the second half of the monologue, Colbert focused on new HUD Secretary Ben Carson, and his idiotic comments in which he called slaves &quot;immigrants, and the Jews in Egypt were pyramid interns.&quot;</p>

<p>Also, you&apos;ll be happy to note that Colbert has remained the dominant force in the late night TV landscape for the fifth week in a row&#x2014;and that&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170914134124/http://pagesix.com/2017/03/07/fallon-feeling-the-pressure-amid-colbert-ratings-wins/?_ga=1.144984436.112495035.1432131367">reportedly pressuring</a> Jimmy Fallon to adjust his own show in response. As we previously wrote, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170914134124/http://gothamist.com/2017/02/17/jimmy_fallon_trump_tool.php">he really could use it!</a></p>
