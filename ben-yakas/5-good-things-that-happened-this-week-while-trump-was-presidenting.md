Once again, it&apos;s Friday, and we invite you to take a break from the distressing state of the world and check out five objectively good things that happened this week.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Nothing warmed the empty cavernous space where my heart should be like Patrick Stewart and his adventures with his new foster dog, Ginger. LOOK AT HOW MUCH SHE LOVES HIM!!! Please adopt her, Jean-Luc! </li>

	<li>We like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170320081241/http://gothamist.com/tags/billmurray">Bill Murray</a> quite a bit. He&apos;s a very good actor and funny guy! I&apos;ve personally considered <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170320081241/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/10/bill_murray_life_cult.php">joining his cult.</a> He also seems like a pretty supportive dad, whether he&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170320081241/http://gothamist.com/2016/09/17/bill_murray_bartender.php#photo-1">serving up drinks</a> at his son&apos;s bar in Greenpoint, or, as he did this week, proudly rooting for his son Luke, who is an assistant coach for the Xavier Musketeers. Murray <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170320081241/http://www.vulture.com/2017/03/watch-bill-murray-go-full-proud-papa-at-ncaa-tournament-game.html">went full-March Madness!</a></li>
	<li>This year has already been chock full of some instant classics (see: Migos <em>Culture</em>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170320081241/http://www.npr.org/2017/03/06/518379457/first-listen-the-magnetic-fields-50-song-memoir">Magnetic Fields <em>50 Year Memoir</em></a>), but this week saw some of the best indie rock artists of the last decade releasing excellent new material that made me happy. That includes a banging new Spoon album (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170320081241/http://pitchfork.com/news/72294-stream-spoons-new-album-hot-thoughts/?mbid=homepage-more-latest-and-video">stream it here</a>) where synths take the place of guitars, a very pretty and Byrdsian new Real Estate album (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170320081241/http://www.stereogum.com/1930372/stream-real-estate-in-mind/music/album-stream/">stream here</a>), and a new single from Feist (that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170320081241/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h66Lvzlj1Uk">sounds like vintage PJ Harvey</a>).</li>
	<li>Those adorable kids who interrupted a BBC interview on-air were at it again this week, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170320081241/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/tv/0/bbc-interview-kid-marion-kellys-press-conference-appearance/">charming the world at a press conference</a> in which they talked about their viral fame. We can only hope the little girl <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170320081241/https://twitter.com/TheDaiLlew/status/842049231317794816?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">will be president of Earth</a> one day.</li>

	<li>And finally, while the epic blizzard may have been a bust in NYC, at least one dog was out there enjoying the snow life to the max. </li>
