<p>&quot;For some, the weekend is a time to rest, relax, spend time with family,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170209234747/http://gothamist.com/tags/sethmeyers">Seth Meyers</a> said as he started his latest segment of &quot;A Closer Look&quot; to examine all the disharmonious Donald Trump weekend news updates. &quot;But for the Trump administration, it&apos;s a time for making up fake tragedies and openly trying to blame the court system for future terror attacks.&quot; </p>

<p>Between the continuing legal battle over the immigration and refugee ban, Trump&apos;s comments about Putin and America&apos;s innocence (or lack thereof), and the Bowling Green Massacre that never was (&quot;Like the Titanic crashing into the Hindenburg, or when Lee Harvey Oswald was shot by a unicorn&quot;), Meyers had plenty of things to say about the administration&apos;s sloppy lies and half-truths. &quot;Even when they&apos;re lying, they&apos;re distracting us from other, worse lies,&quot; he noted. &quot;That&apos;s like telling people you have a girlfriend in Canada when actually you have a dead body in the basement.&quot;</p>

<p>Watch below as he learns that we&apos;ve had the sane version of Trump so far (&quot;What does the insane version do, ban all people named Zach?&quot;), dives into golf hypocrisy, and dismisses pro-Trump rallies in Midtown: &quot;Fifty to one hundred people is not a rally. It&apos;s a Times Square corner. It&apos;s the line to get into Dave &amp; Busters.&quot;</p>
