<p>A few months ago, Google finally confronted their glasshole problem head on, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150324064551/http://gothamist.com/2014/02/19/google_glassholes.php">releasing a list of &#x201C;Do&#x2019;s and Don&#x2019;ts&#x201D;</a> for Glass Explorers that amounted to a very call for basic human decency and respect. Paramount among their concerns were glassholes who break the rules or are rude to those of us who aren&apos;t <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150324064551/http://gothamist.com/tags/googleglass">aspirational cyborgs</a>. Now, one East Village restaurant has incurred the wrath of these very glassholes for the crime of asking someone to please put their Glass away inside their restaurant.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150324064551/http://evgrieve.com/2014/05/a-google-glass-feast.html">EV Grieve has the details</a> about what went down at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150324064551/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/05/feast.php#photo-1">3rd Avenue joint Feast</a> at the end of April: Katy Kasmai was asked to take off her Glass before dining, because the restaurant had previously received several comments about privacy from other guests when a Glass Explorer ate there. Kasmai allegedly refused to take hers off, and left. <br>
&quot;We try to give everyone the best experience possible and she didn&apos;t get that,&quot; Feast management told them.</p>

<p>Karmai <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150324064551/https://plus.google.com/+KatyKasmai/posts/3PvxJted6qm">wrote about the experience</a> on Google+ on April 20th: &quot;For the first time ever this place, Feast, in #NYC just asked that I remove +Google Glass because customers have complained of privacy concerns in the past. Never has happened to me before in the one year I&apos;ve had Glass. I left. #throughglass&#xFEFF;.&quot; She added in a comment, &quot;I did ask if they restrict cellphone access as well. They said no. Anyway plenty of good restaurants nearby, I&apos;m at ABC Kitchen now. Better food. No strange Glass rules.&#xFEFF;&quot;</p>

<p>And then, Feast says that they suddenly were inundated with negative reviews online&#x2014;most of which referenced the Glass situation:</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="feast2.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150324064551im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/feast2.jpg" width="640" height="349" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="feast3.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150324064551im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/feast3.jpg" width="640" height="389" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>Let&apos;s circle back around to those Google Do&apos;s And Don&apos;ts again:</p>

<blockquote>Don&apos;t Be creepy or rude (aka, a &#x201C;Glasshole&#x201D;). Respect others and if they have questions about Glass don&#x2019;t get snappy. Be polite and explain what Glass does and remember, a quick demo can go a long way. In places where cell phone cameras aren&#x2019;t allowed, the same rules will apply to Glass. If you&#x2019;re asked to turn your phone off, turn Glass off as well. <strong>Breaking the rules or being rude will not get businesses excited about Glass and will ruin it for other Explorers.</strong></blockquote>

<p>&quot;When the first thing that comes up when you search Feast in Google is a 3.1, it can really hurt a restaurant like us,&quot; the Feast manager <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150324064551/http://evgrieve.com/2014/05/a-google-glass-feast.html">told EV Grieve</a>. &quot;Then you have 13 people, which is about half the total reviews, who have never been to our restaurant let alone live in NYC, leave you one-star reviews &#x2026; it&apos;s malicious and technically a violation of Google&apos;s own terms for leaving reviews. Again I can understand her leaving the one-star based on her experience, but 12 others with no experience on who we are or what we do is unfair.&quot;</p>

<p>Despite&#x2014;or perhaps because of&#x2014;this bad press that came from this situation, Feast says they&apos;re open to revisiting the issue in the future: &quot;The fact is that the policy of asking Google Glass wearers to remove them is based off experience. It&apos;s not a policy set in stone so it could very well change.&quot;</p>
