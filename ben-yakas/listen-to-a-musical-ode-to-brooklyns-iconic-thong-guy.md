<p>Gothamist has long been beguiled by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140527220121/http://gothamist.com/tags/thongguy">Thong Guy</a>, whose dedication to wearing the least amount of clothing permissible in NYC is only matched by his wanton disregard for other people&apos;s eyes. Now finally, someone has written a musical tribute to the man who lets it all hang out: below, listen to Modern Beast&apos;s soft rock instant classic, &quot;Brooklyn Thong Guy.&quot;</p>

<p>After a sweet solo section worthy of the Doobie Brothers (or at least the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140527220121/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Doobie_Brothers#The_2000s">2014 Doobie Brothers</a>), songwriter and lead singer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140527220121/http://www.timelliscomedy.com/">Tim Ellis</a> concludes, &quot;Don&apos;t put your clothes on/because then I wouldn&apos;t get to sing this song/about the Brooklyn Thong Guy.&quot; Based on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140527220121/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/10/thong_guy_speaks.php">our conversation with him back in 2012</a>, we don&apos;t think there&apos;s any need to worry about that happening anytime soon. Thong Guy knows all too well that he has a responsibility to keep the flame burning for his fellow brothers who enjoy wearing a &quot;tiny bit of fabric covering [their] schlong.&quot; </p>
