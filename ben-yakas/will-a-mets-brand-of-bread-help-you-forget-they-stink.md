title: Will A Mets Brand Of Bread Help You Forget They Stink?

										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="121810mets.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424153447im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/121810mets.jpg" width="220" height="220" class="image-left"> </span></p>

<p>They&apos;ve <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424153447/http://gothamist.com/2010/12/03/k-rod_pleads_guilty_to_assault_but.php">dealt with</a> the K-Rod controversy, and cleaned house a bit. They&apos;ve got a new <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424153447/http://gothamist.com/2010/10/29/mets_officially_introduce_alderson.php">GM</a> and a new <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424153447/http://gothamist.com/2010/11/21/report_mets_choose_terry_collins_as.php">manager</a>. So now it&apos;s time to ask the hard questions: <strong>&quot;If the Mets&apos; logo were to appear on your favorite brand of bread, how would it affect your purchase?&quot; </strong></p>

<p>With the stink of the last few underwhelming seasons still clinging to the team, the Mets have begun thinking outside the box, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424153447/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/queens/mets_fans_hit_foul_poll_trying_to_1GBWKzs2fOqeSXvRq17alK">sending out</a> online surveys to try to figure out how to re-brand themselves and win back fans. In addition to the bread question, there was also a question about the perception of the Mets as &quot;authentic,&quot; &quot;blue-collar&quot; or &quot;proud.&quot; Self-described &quot;lifelong&quot; Mets fan Corey Keyes gave a most reasonable response to the bread query: if he saw a loaf of Met bread, &quot;I would probably have to set the [supermarket] aisle on fire&#x2014;based on how pathetic they are on the field and how embarrassing the management and players are off the field.&quot;</p>
