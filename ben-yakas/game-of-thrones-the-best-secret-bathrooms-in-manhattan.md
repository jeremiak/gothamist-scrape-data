<p>Unless you subscribe to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509195155/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/23/bloombergs_advice_for_success_dont.php">Mayor Bloomberg School Of Holding It In</a>, you&apos;ve likely encountered some public urination crises. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509195155/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/18/nyc_restroom_public_urination.php">Peeing in New York is tough.</a> Starbucks can be a pretty decent option, but can you hold it for 20 minutes waiting on line? Or what if it&apos;s one of those Starbucks that locks its bathroom randomly? Or what if Starbucks <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509195155/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/16/toilet_tragedy_starbucks_has_begun.php">goes through with previous threats</a> to eliminate their public bathroom policy entirely? </p>

<p>Thankfully, you have some hidden options: there are bathrooms <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509195155/http://www.nycgovparks.org/facilities/bathrooms">in just about every park in NYC</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509195155/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=se.windro.Way2GoNYC.standard">there are apps</a> to help sort your options, and there are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509195155/http://www.nyrestroom.com/">websites wholly dedicated</a> to creating an organized list of such places (it seems you have a lot of choices in the Garment District). Obviously bars are always pretty easy places to use for their facilities, but most of them aren&apos;t open during the day; hotels are often good as well, as long as you know how to avoid direct eye contact with any concierges and act like you belong there. </p>

<p>So <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509195155/http://www.reddit.com/r/nyc/comments/1q9pvh/secret_bathroom_spots/">over at Reddit</a>, users who are highly invested in finding secret spots to pee around Manhattan have started compiling their own list. Some are highly concerned about their favorite spots getting blown up. &quot;If bathroom traffic to these non-bathroom places goes up, you can bet the managers will notice,&quot; writes This-Color-Is-Blue. &quot;And when bathroom-traffic rises, the percentage chance that someone will use their bathroom &apos;disrespectfully&apos; also rises. And it only takes one person to fuck-up in there for them to restrict bathroom privileges for everyone.&quot; In addition, user Marklyon apparently is a precog: &quot;Tomorrow, though, it will be on Gothamist. Monday, in the subway newspapers. In a week, the NYT Style Section.&quot;</p>

<p>But isn&apos;t the whole point to try to help out your fellow human being during a crisis? We&apos;ve all experienced the agony of emergency bathroom needs&#x2014;if lists like these can help even one person avoid a public incident, then we think it&apos;s worth ruining a spot or two. And realistically, people are lazy&#x2014;they&apos;ll probably forget about a lot of these places. Here, have another beer. </p>

<p>Check out some of their favorite &quot;secret&quot; spots around Manhattan, plus a few of our trusty standbys mixed in.</p>
