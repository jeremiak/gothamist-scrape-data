</div></div>					<p>Thousands of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150613073043/http://gothamist.com/tags/occupywallstreet">Occupy Wall Street</a> protesters have now begun filing into Times Square for a massive <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150613073043/http://www.theoccupationparty.com/">Occupation Party</a>, in part to celebrate the spreading of OWS <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150613073043/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/15/occupy_wall_street_spreads_across_g.php">across the globe</a> today. The police have begun setting up barricades to keep the protesters within certain areas, and portions of the sidewalks have become almost impassable. However, the mood around midtown is joyous&#x2014;you can watch a live stream from there below, and we&apos;ll be giving live updates for the next few hours. <strong>[More Updates Below]</strong></p>

<p>According to James Thilman, our reporter at the scene, there are sporatic eruptions of extended cheering between chants: the usuals, such as &quot;Banks got bailed out, We got sold out, Whose street? Our streets!&quot; and, &quot;we are unstoppable, another world is possible.&quot; Police are keeping people&#x2014;particularly bewildered tourists&#x2014;on the sidewalks moving, while protesters are confined to large areas in the center of the square, with limited entrances to barricaded area. There are lots of people with tambourines and other instruments, and the crowd continues to grow ever larger.</p>

<p><strong>Update 6:35 p.m.</strong>: Reports are coming in that police have started arresting rowdy protesters. There have been reports of mounted policemen pushing back and forth with boxed in protesters&#x2014;and it seems at least one man ascended a traffic light to flash the peace sign (and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150613073043/http://twitpic.com/70vy8h">now is doing a &quot;mic check&quot;</a>).</p>

<p><strong>Update 6:45 p.m.</strong>: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150613073043/http://twitter.com/#!/Newyorkist/status/125339425914892291">NewYorkist tweets that</a> he&apos;s seen, &quot;At least two large NYPD trucks moved into Bway, coming north of 46th full if barticafes. Currently placing them in pedestrian plaza.&quot; With the square packed in as it is already, and more and more people joining in on the occupation, it&apos;s hard to imagine the police barricades, which are keeping people on the sidewalks and in designated areas, lasting through the whole evening. However, it seems to be working thus far: police have just started letting traffic come through 7th Avenue.</p>

Smaller, easier to defend.&quot;</p>

<p><b>Update 11:35 p.m.</b>: Thilman tells us that at the General Assembly discussion, a protester says to crowd, &quot;Ask yourself, are you against parks closing at midnight or wall street? We need real estate, but we need to get it in the smartest and most strategic way possible.&quot; Also, three police buses just pulled up across from the park. </p>

<p>Thilman adds it seems only a small portion (10-20%) of those gathered &quot;raised their hands when asked who is willing to stay and get arrested. Most want to table discussion and disperse rather than risk arrest.&quot; </p>

<p>Witnesses say there are dozens of cops on the scene, many in riot gear.</p>
