<p>A Carnegie Deli manager <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508153018/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2014/04/01/police-man-mugged-outside-port-authority-bus-terminal-while-hailing-taxi/">was assaulted</a> at Port Authority on Monday, and he says that instead of intervening or calling police, bystanders stood and took video of it. Jose Robles, 52, was allegedly assaulted by Sossony Bryant, 31, around 5:45 a.m. on Eighth Avenue near West 42nd Street.<strong> &quot;People were watching and they were having a good time filming,&quot;</strong> Robles <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508153018/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/port-authority-attack-victim-angry-do-nothing-witnesses-article-1.1742519">told the Daily News</a> from the hospital. </p>

<p>Robles told cops that Bryant hit him in the head, kicked and beat him while on the ground, and also threw his shoes into the street. His left arm was broken in three places, including his elbow that needed reconstructive surgery; he suffered two black eyes; and he&apos;s waiting to find out whether his hip is broken. </p>

<p>Robles, who has been a manager of the Carnegie Deli for the last 26 years, told the News Bryant had been following him, but doesn&apos;t know why he assaulted him: &quot;He wouldn&#x2019;t stop. I tried to get up again, but he grabbed my jacket and spun me around and he grabbed my shoes and threw them in the street and started kicking me again,&quot; he said.</p>

<p>Bryant, who is homeless and has a record of several arrests for assault, has been charged with attempted robbery and assault. As for the other people who were standing around as he was assaulted: &quot;I called for help, but people were just filming on their cell phones. I ran into the Port Authority and cops were coming down the escalator,&quot; Robles said. &quot;I&#x2019;ve seen other incidents like this and I&#x2019;ve called police immediately. I&#x2019;ve always tried to help.&quot;</p>
