<p>A Times Square Statue Of Liberty has been arrested for brawling with a fellow Times Square Statue Of Liberty. According to police, 41-year-old Alexander Lopez assaulted a 23-year-old man in Times Square around 4 p.m. Wednesday. Not since the days of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427141519/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/22/times_square_weed_man_arrested_afte.php">Weed Man vs Weed Man</a> has there been such an epic Times Square battle. </p>

<p>A source <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427141519/http://nypost.com/2014/06/13/two-men-dressed-as-statue-of-liberties-brawl/">told the Post</a> that the two got into the tussle over the territory in front of the Marriott Marquis at Broadway and 45th Street. Lopez allegedly became physical with the other man first, pushing him to the ground, causing pain and swelling. </p>

<p>After the two men ran into each other again at the same spot on Thursday, the 23-year-old reported the incident; Lopez was arrested, and has been charged with assault in the incident.  No word on whether Alien or Predator were brought in as character witnesses <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427141519/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/weed-guy-stabs-beer-guy-times-square-article-1.1379660">this time</a>.</p>
