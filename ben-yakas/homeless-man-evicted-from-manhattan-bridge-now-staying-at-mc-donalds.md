<p>On Thursday, the homeless man who has been living inside the Manhattan Bridge for the past year <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508124209/http://gothamist.com/2014/04/17/photos_police_remove_homeless_man_f.php#photo-1">was uprooted by police</a>. The man, 57-year-old Joe Zhou, moved to NYC 13 years ago, and has been living in the bridge for over a year. And since his eviction, he&apos;s been staying at a 24-hour McDonald&apos;s: &quot;Without an ID, I just have to spend another night in McDonald&#x2019;s...I&#x2019;m looking for any other option,&quot; he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508124209/http://nypost.com/2014/04/19/homeless-bridge-vagrant-now-at-a-24-hour-mcdonalds/">told the Post</a>. &quot;I&#x2019;m afraid to be around too many people who know me.&quot;</p>

<p>With the help of a translator, the Post finally got some more background about Zhou, and how he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508124209/http://gothamist.com/2014/04/13/homeless_people_are_reportedly_livi.php">ended up living in the bridge</a>. Zhou told them he was born in the southern costal region of Fujian province in 1957; he says he was married with children and worked as a livery driver there until he moved to America (he didn&apos;t explain why he moved here, nor where his wife and kids are now). </p>

<p>&quot;America is better than China because there are so many places to make money &#x2014; but they won&#x2019;t give me the opportunity right now,&quot; he noted, adding that he flitted between odd jobs, but wasn&apos;t able to hold one for more than a few weeks. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508124209/http://gothamist.com/2014/04/16/homeless_man_says_hes_lived_inside.php">He previously said</a> he suffered a financial loss through gambling which led to his current homeless state, and says he makes enough money to eat now by selling casino vouchers on the black market.</p>

<p>Zhou says he much preferred his 10.5 square foot plywood and Styrofoam space in the bridge, which was built into the underside of the upper deck of the bridge (above the bike lanes, below car traffic) about 150 feet east into the bridge&#x2019;s Brooklyn-bound side. For now he&apos;ll spend his time in city shelters or McDonald&apos;s, but he hates both places. &quot;I insulated [the bridge space] well from things on the street...But they threw all my stuff out! Everything out!&quot; he said, referring to cops throwing out his stove, a reading lamp and a &quot;pantry&quot; stocked with beer.</p>
