<p>It&apos;s bad enough when politicians <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130815201330/http://gothamist.com/2012/08/11/video_romney_introduce_ryan_as_next.php">make verbal flubs</a> during major speeches&#x2014;just imagine how embarrassing it would be if those mistakes were enshrined in print. Well, Sheepshead Bay assembly candidate <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130815201330/http://www.akselrod4assembly.com/">Ben Akselrod</a> is experiencing that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130815201330/http://www.sheepsheadbites.com/2012/08/in-flubbed-campaign-lit-assembly-candidate-says-crime-is-up-in-the-negrohood/">after thousands of mailers went out</a> to Democratic voters saying that crime is up in the &#x201C;negrohood.&#x201D;</p>
