<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2009_11_daddy1.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629175242im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2009_11_daddy1.jpg" width="240" height="260" class="image-left"> </span>It feels like the whole city is in preparation for tonight&apos;s Game 6 World Series showdown, the game which could clinch the title for the Yankees, including our beloved local rags, and you know that old saying: give a rag a fish, and you&apos;ll feed them for a day, but teach a rag to fish, and you&apos;ll get endlessly rehashed stories forever!</p>

<p>As reported <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629175242/http://gothamist.com/2009/11/03/patersons_world_series_tickets_now.php">yesterday</a>, the Post broke the news that Gov. Paterson had been given tickets to Game 1 of the Series for free, and was in a tiff with the Yankees president over who-offered-what. Today, the Post <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629175242/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/gov_won_balk_at_probe_of_my_yank_CLPbIGmsbopL3DDlbIZ4BI">reports</a> that Gov. Patterson welcomes &quot;a state investigation into the ethics of his accepting as many as five free Yankee tickets worth nearly $2,000 for the opening game.&quot; A Paterson spokeswoman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629175242/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/2009/11/04/2009-11-04_gov_paterson_says_world_series_ticket_for_him_was_free_other_paid_for.html?r=news">reassured the public</a> that, &quot;checks to cover four of the five $425 seats, which were behind home plate, have been mailed.&quot;</p>

<p>If you&apos;re looking to find seats for tonight and aren&apos;t the Governor of NY, prepare to shell out an extremely healthy amount&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629175242/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/the_seat_kQ7cM6RV8zk9IR15RttEZK">tickets are selling</a> in the 4 to 5-digits range on Stubhub, and go as high as $24,900, which will give you two seats four rows behind the Yankees dugout. There are still tickets available in the $600-$1000 range, if you don&apos;t mind sitting near the foul poles or in the upper deck. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629175242/http://www.myfoxny.com/dpp/sports/mlb/yankees/091103-ghosts-of-old-yankee-stadium">FoxNY dives</a> into an investigation of the ghosts of Yankees Stadium old. They seem particularly concerned about Babe Ruth&apos;s spirit, but with no one returning calls for interviews, they bargain that &quot;the new stadium has tried to appease the ghosts.&quot; One man who will probably not outrun his ghosts? Pedro Martinez, who famously referred to the Yankees as his &quot;daddy&quot; several years ago, starts tonight for the Phillies. A good rag <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629175242/http://www.nypost.com/p/sports/yankees/daddy_out_whup_pedro_bombers_have_EATWRFlubLVgrbtZ5PQYlK">never forgets a headline worth remembering</a>&#x2014;especially when it can include a <strong>Pedro-as-baby centerfold</strong> (after the jump!):  </p>
