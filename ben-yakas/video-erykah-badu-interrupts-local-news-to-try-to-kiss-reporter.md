<p>While soul singer Erykah Badu may have been busy hanging out in Bed-Stuy <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150421224302/http://gothamist.com/2014/06/29/photos_dave_chappelle_wesley_snipes.php">at Spike Lee&apos;s block party this weekend</a>, she was out and about in midtown Manhattan on Friday when <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150421224302/http://pix11.com/2014/06/28/see-it-erykah-badu-interrupts-live-shot-to-kiss-pix11s-mario-diaz/">she stumbled upon</a> PIX11 reporter Mario Diaz doing a story on Shia LaBeouf&apos;s meltdown. And like any human being who has ever found themselves in the background of a live broadcast, Badu started doing weird, awkward, funny shit&#x2014;including trying to kiss Diaz. Watch below.</p>

<p>She smirks! She makes a rude gesture! She does funny walks back and forth! She wears a Pharrell-sized hat! Later on Twitter, she acknowledged it was her and apologized to Lopez, which led to this exchange:</p>

<p>For what it&apos;s worth, it&apos;s pretty clear Badu was just following the old &quot;do unto others&quot; golden rule, as she sings in &quot;Kiss Me On My Neck:&quot; <strong>&quot;I want somebody to walk up behind me/ And kiss me on my neck and breathe on my neck.&quot; </strong></p>
