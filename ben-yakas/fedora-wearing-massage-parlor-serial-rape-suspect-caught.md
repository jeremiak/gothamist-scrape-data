<p>Police have arrested the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140903132035/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/20/video_serial_rapist_suspected_of_se.php">fedora-wearing suspect</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140903132035/http://gothamist.com/2012/08/22/video_man_suspected_of_beating_sexu.php">accused of raping</a> two women at massage parlors in Manhattan and Queens over the last two months, and it comes just after he allegedly attacked another massage parlor in Long Island yesterday. Zhordrack Blodywon, 40, has been charged with rape, robbery, criminal possession of stolen property, thanks to a tip to Crime Stoppers.</p>

<p>Cops received a call around 1 a.m. Saturday about a robbery in progress at the Butterfly Massage Parlor in Long Island; due to the description of the suspect by the 42-year-old  robbery victim, the Special Victim&apos;s Unit also responded to the call. They then received a tip from Crime Stoppers giving the name of the suspect. Around 1 p.m. that afternoon, cops received a call that Blodywon was trying to rob another massage parlor in Great Neck (an employee recognized him from stories about him). Blodywon fled on a bus, and Nassau County Cops were able to find him on it and arrest him. He was in possession of a BB gun and a hunting knife.</p>
