                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="62313cohen.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130729111315im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/62313cohen.jpg" width="640" height="480" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>Wedged between profiles of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130729111315/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/23/fashion/what-price-generosity.html?ref=fashion">extravagant philanthropists</a> and articles about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130729111315/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/23/fashion/molly-pure-but-not-so-simple.html?ref=fashion">MDMA tailor-made</a> for anxious mothers who need to email you at 7 a.m. about how you don&apos;t need drugs to be happy, this weekend&apos;s NY Times Style Section also included <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130729111315/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/23/fashion/from-the-middle-ages-to-the-middle-aged.html?_r=1&amp;">a piece on musician Rufus Wainwright</a>, who will turn 40 in less than a month. It&apos;s a pleasant enough article, filled with anecdotes about magic wands, except for one little detail: the NY Times killed off Leonard Cohen! </p>

<p>Having seen him <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130729111315/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/08/photos_video_leonard_cohen_takes_ma.php#photo-1">elegantly shuffling to and fro at Radio City Music Hall</a> a few months ago, we can say with much certainty that the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130729111315/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/21/extra_extra_2579.php">Canadian Artist of the Year</a> is very much alive and well, and performing some of his best shows ever currently. Thankfully, the paper caught its mistake, and included the correction you see above. Even if they did briefly send him to an early grave, we know Cohen has a healthy sense of humor&#x2014;we&apos;re sure he would forgive them anyhow.</p>
