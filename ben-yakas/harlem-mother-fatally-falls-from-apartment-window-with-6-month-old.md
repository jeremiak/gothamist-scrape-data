<p>A Harlem mother died this afternoon after falling from an eight-story apartment window with her six-month-old son. An FDNY spokesperson tells us the incident happened around 3:30 p.m. on Bradhurst Avenue, near W. 147th Street. The 45-year-old mother was dead at the scene, and the baby was taken to Harlem Hospital. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604035839/http://pix11.com/2013/03/13/woman-and-young-child-killed-after-falling-from-harlem-apartment-building/#axzz2NSOY8XYm">WPIX</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604035839/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/mother-infant-dead-8-story-fall-article-1.1287649">the Daily News</a> say he died there, while <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604035839/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2013/03/13/woman-dies-after-jumping-from-harlem-high-rise-with-baby/?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter">CBS</a> and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604035839/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/14/nyregion/mother-dies-in-leap-from-harlem-building.html">Times</a> both report that he&apos;s still alive.</p>

<p>Police sources <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604035839/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/14/nyregion/mother-dies-in-leap-from-harlem-building.html">told the Times</a>, &#x201C;Looks like a suicide,&#x201D; and &quot;an official source&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604035839/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/mother-infant-dead-8-story-fall-article-1.1287649">also told the Daily News</a> a similar thing, but that hasn&apos;t been confirmed yet. An anonymous source told us that a man may have pushed the woman out the window and then shot himself, but we haven&apos;t been able to confirm those details yet either. We&apos;ll update when we know more.</p>
