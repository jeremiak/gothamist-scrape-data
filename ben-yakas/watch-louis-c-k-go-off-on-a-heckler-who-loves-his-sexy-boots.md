<p>When national treasure <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424160433/http://gothamist.com/tags/louisck">Louis C.K.</a> performed at the NY City Center on March 1st <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424160433/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/15/louis_ck_tickets_on_sale.php">as a benefit</a> for P.S. 3 on Staten Island, he was interrupted by a female heckler who complimented him on his sexy boots. And to C.K., positive heckles are no better than positive stereotypes&#x2014;you can see him <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424160433/http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/1a89xv/louis_ck_reacts_to_a_positive_heckle/">go off on her</a> in the hilarious video below.</p>

<blockquote>I was at this show, and it got much worse later on. About 30 minutes later, as Louis was trying to segue into a joke about the zoo, the same woman yelled something like, &quot;Have you ever seen the monkey who smokes cigarettes?&quot; He fucking lost it on her.

<p>He told her that she was a terrible, mean-spirited person, and basically reenacted his conversation with the woman outside the comedy club from the heckler episode of Louie.</p>

<p>It was pretty great.</p></blockquote><p></p>
