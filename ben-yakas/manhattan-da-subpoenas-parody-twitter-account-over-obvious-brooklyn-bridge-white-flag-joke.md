You may recall that back in the heady days of a few weeks ago, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501170333/http://gothamist.com/tags/whiteflag">two white flags were mysteriously installed on the Brooklyn Bridge</a> prompting a lot of confusion and a bit of hysteria. They were possibly put there by an &quot;insider,&quot; or perhaps a marauding gang of trouble-making skateboarders, but we don&apos;t really know because the NYPD hasn&apos;t named any suspects nearly a month later. But they claim they&apos;re <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501170333/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/nypd-catching-behind-brooklyn-bridge-flag-caper-article-1.1896734">really really close</a> to finding the culprits: &quot;We think we have a very good idea of who&#x2019;s responsible,&#x2019;&quot; Police Chief Bratton said. </p>

<p>But we can guarantee at least one person who did NOT commit the crime: the parody Twitter account <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501170333/https://twitter.com/BicycleLobby">Bike Lobby.</a> However, that hasn&apos;t stopped the District Attorney&apos;s office from (hilariously) subpoenaing them because of a transparently jokey tweet. </p>

<p>So what did Bike Lobby, a parody account which was inspired by the ramblings of reactionary anti-bike nut <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501170333/http://gothamist.com/tags/dorothyrabinowitz">Dorothy Rabinowitz</a> (she claimed that cops had their hands tied by the &quot;all-powerful bike lobby&quot;), tweet to inspire such paranoia?</p>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Earlier today we hoisted two white flags to signal our complete surrender of the Brooklyn Bridge bicycle path to pedestrians.</p>&#x2014; Bike Lobby (@BicycleLobby) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501170333/https://twitter.com/BicycleLobby/statuses/491590676816363520">July 22, 2014</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//web.archive.org/web/20150501170333js_/http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></center>

<p>Hours after they tweeted that, it seems both AP and Daily News reported on the tweet as if the parody Twitter account (note in their Twitter bio: &quot;Parody account.&quot;) were real. That same day, Bike Lobby immediately clarified that, again, they were a parody account.</p>

<p>So&#x2014;and we&apos;re going out on a limb here&#x2014;perhaps one reason why it&apos;s taken so long for the NYPD to even name a suspect, let alone arrest somebody, in this incident is that they&apos;ve spent a certain amount of time/man power/resources/taxpayer&apos;s money pursuing dead-end leads like a Twitter parody account that clearly marked that it was a Twitter parody account. </p>

<p>Then again, that Bike Lobby sure has stirred the pot over the last year.</p>
