After unleashing a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510022808/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/26/photo_newest_banksy_is_on_a_truck_i.php#photo-1">&quot;grumpy&quot; truck</a> in Sunset Park yesterday, Banksy&apos;s latest piece for his Better Out Than In series just popped up at Noble and West Streets in Greenpoint. And <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510022808/http://banksy.co.uk/2013/10/27/blocked-messages">according to Banksy</a>, the graffiti is a response to a rejected NY Times editorial he wrote about One World Trade Center.</p>

<p>&quot;Today&#x2019;s piece was going to be an op-ed column in the New York Times,&quot; he writes on his site. &quot;But they declined to publish what I supplied. Which was this...&quot; You can see the editorial, which mocks the building for looking &quot;like something they would build in Canada,&quot; above.</p>

<p><strong>[UPDATE]</strong> A spokeswoman for the Times, Eileen Murphy, confirmed that Banksy&apos;s submission didn&apos;t make the cut. &quot;He did submit an op-Ed and art. We couldn&apos;t agree on either the piece or the art, so we did reject it,&quot; Murphy said via email, adding, &quot;What he has posted on his site is not exactly the same as what he submitted.&quot;</p>

<p>Murphy declined to describe the art or elaborate on what precisely was different with the version of the op-ed that appeared on Banksy&apos;s site. &quot;It was close, just not exactly the same.&quot; </p>
