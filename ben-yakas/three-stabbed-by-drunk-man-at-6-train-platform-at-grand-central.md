<p>Three people were stabbed and slashed by an intoxicated man at Grand Central Terminal last night. Police say the incident happened around 12:15 a.m. as a northbound 6 train pulled into the station. A 38-year-old suspect, who was drunk, was acting belligerently as he tried to exit the train, bumping into a child who was trying to board. The suspect then got into a fight with a 25-year-old man, believed to be the child&apos;s father.</p>

<p>The suspect took out a knife, stabbing that man in the chest; the suspect also slashed a 29-year-old man in the arm, and a 27-year-old man in the stomach. All three victims were taken to Bellevue Hospital; the father is in critical condition, while the other two men are in stable condition. </p>

<p>The child was unharmed in the melee, and the knife was recovered by cops. Charges are pending for the suspect.<br>
