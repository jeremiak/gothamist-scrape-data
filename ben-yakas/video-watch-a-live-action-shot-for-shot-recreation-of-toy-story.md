<p>Sweding, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130219194539/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweded#.22Sweded.22">Michel Gondry-coined</a> term for fans remaking movies with low (or no) budget, has become an increasingly popular way to have fun with movie trailers on the internet, with everything from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130219194539/http://www.vulture.com/2012/03/watch-a-sweded-avengers-trailer.html"><em>The Avengers</em></a> to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130219194539/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFZBz3ZiQbk"><em>Jurassic Park</em></a> getting the DIY treatment.
