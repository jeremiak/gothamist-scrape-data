<p>Last year, Joe Biden <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161210153818/http://gothamist.com/2015/09/11/biden_colbert_video.php">made an emotional appearance</a> on the newly-launched <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161210153818/http://gothamist.com/tags/stephencolbert"><em>Late Show With Stephen Colbert</em></a> shortly after his son Beau died, getting into a poignant, funny, and vulnerable conversation about loss and grief. The two renewed their rapport last night when Biden returned to give the nation a family pep talk about the coming Trump presidency: &quot;It happens to every family, but I&#x2019;m telling ya: This terrible feeling you&#x2019;re having right now, it&#x2019;s not permanent,&quot; Biden said. &quot;It&#x2019;ll be over in four years, maybe eight.&quot;</p>

<p>In the longer interview segment, Colbert pressed Biden on whether he regretted not jumping into the 2016 presidential ring when he had the chance: &quot;I know I made the right decision for my family. I know I made the right decision. I&apos;m not sure I would have been able to put my whole heart into it,&quot; Biden said, referring to the death of his son Beau. &quot;What I regret is the circumstance that led me to not be able to run...Do I think I was best prepared, at this moment, to lead the country? I did. The issues of greatest concern were in my wheelhouse, things I&apos;ve dealt with my whole career. So in that sense, I&apos;m disappointed...But I don&apos;t regret the actual decision.&quot;</p>

<p>As for reports of him saying he was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161210153818/http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/05/politics/joe-biden-2020-run-election/">open to running in 2020</a>, Biden walked back his comments, and then played coy: &quot;I don&apos;t plan on running again, but to say you know it&apos;s going to happen in four years I just think is not rational,&quot; he said. &quot;I can&apos;t see the circumstance in which I&apos;d run, but what I learned a long, long time ago, Stephen, is to never say never. You don&apos;t know what&apos;s going to happen. Hell, Donald Trump&apos;s going to be 74, I&apos;ll be 77, and in better shape. I mean, what the hell?&quot;</p>

<p>In the second half of the interview, they talked about a congressional bill, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161210153818/http://www.phillyvoice.com/biden-in-2020-with-a-smile-he-says-hes-not-ruling-/">named for Beau Biden</a>, that will fund a massive effort to advance cancer research (&quot;The Cancer Moonshot&quot;).</p>

<p>And in his opening monologue, Colbert riffed on Al Gore&apos;s climate change talk with Trump yesterday, and the member of the Electoral College who announced <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161210153818/http://gothamist.com/2016/12/06/republican_elector_trump.php">he wouldn&apos;t vote for Trump.</a> &quot;This makes [him] what&apos;s called a &apos;faithless elector,&apos;&quot; Colbert said, &quot;Also the name of a Lifetime movie about a wife who discovers her husband is having an affair with a voting machine.&quot;</p>
