                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="100413bikers.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203054130im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_arts_john/100413bikers.jpeg" width="640" height="350" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>Prosecutors said the SUV driver who was involved <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203054130/http://gothamist.com/tags/motorcyclerallyroadrage">in a road incident with a group of motorcyclists</a> last weekend <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203054130/http://nypost.com/2013/10/05/biker-beatdown-was-6-on-1-included-head-stomps/">was brutally beaten by up to six bikers</a>. An account of the incident from SUV driver Alexian Lien was given in court last night as the first motorcyclist arrested for the incident, Robert Sims, was arraigned on charges of gang assault, felony assault, and weapon&apos;s possession. &#x201C;The defendant is clearly seen stomping on [Lien&#x2019;s] head,&#x201D; assistant district attorney Joshua Steinglass told the judge, who set bail at $100K.</p>

<p>Lien told prosecutors that a motorcyclist smashed the window of his car with his helmet, then five or six other motorcyclists dragged him out of the car and attacked him, kicking him in the head as he tried to crawl to safety. Prosecutors claim that the 35-year-old Sims&#x2014;who has been previously arrested for car theft, gun possession, drug possession and samurai sword possession&#x2014;admitted he was caught on camera.</p>

<p>But defense attorney Luther Williams maintains his client is innocent and the motorcyclists only pursued Lien to prevent him from leaving the scene after hitting fellow motorcyclist Edwin Mieses with his car. A friend of Sims&apos; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203054130/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/undercover-biker-watched-beating-desk-duty-sources-article-1.1477174">told the Daily News</a> that he is a friendly guy known for walking his Shih Tzu: &#x201C;Why would they charge him?&#x201D; the unidentified friend asked. &#x201C;He was in the wrong place at the wrong time. How do they know he did anything?&#x201D;</p>

<p>In addition to Sims and 28-year-old Christopher Cruz, who has been charged with misdemeanor reckless driving and unlawful imprisonment (for allegedly trapping Lien with his motorcycle), a third motorcyclist was arrested yesterday. Reginald Chance, 37, has been charged with gang assault, felony assault and criminal mischief.</p>
