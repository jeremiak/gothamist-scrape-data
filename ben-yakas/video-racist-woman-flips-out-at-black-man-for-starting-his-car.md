<p><strong>Update Below</strong>&quot;Racism is alive and well, I tell ya,&quot; says the upstate New York man taking the video below. We don&apos;t see what happens <em>before</em> the video starts, but both he and the woman seem to agree that the confrontation was sparked when the man started his car and scared the woman&apos;s children (which, in and of itself, is pretty odd). Regardless, what is captured on video is ugly and unmistakably racist: &quot;I called you a n*****,&quot; the woman shrieks. &quot;You&apos;re a n*****. Nasty fucking n*****.&quot;</p>

<p>Incredibly, the woman has the gall to accuse the man of being a &apos;racist n*****&apos; several times, despite noting that her children &quot;don&apos;t like black people either.&quot; As the video&apos;s uploader put it, &quot;I&apos;m more upset that it was done in front of her children. They will have hate and have no idea where it came from.&quot;</p>

<p>The video hits a crescendo as the woman beseeches her husband to come over and kick the man&apos;s ass. &quot;He thinks he&apos;s gonna get something out of this,&quot; the woman rants to her husband. &quot;Oh he knows the cops? <strong>How many cops have I stripped for, you&apos;re not getting far bitch.</strong>&quot; For once, we <em>really</em> would have liked to have seen how this one played out with the police. </p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: The woman in the video has been identified as Janelle Ambrosia of Buffalo, NY. She has been all over social media all morning since her identity was revealed, defending herself <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422202344/https://twitter.com/JanelleAmbrosia">by tweeting things like</a>, &quot;if you act like a n***** you&apos;re going to be called a n*****&quot; and &quot;I have black friends. So i don&apos;t need to hear opinions of people that don&apos;t know me.&quot; A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422202344/https://www.facebook.com/pages/Janelle-Ambrosia-is-racist/519401824853952">Facebook page has been set-up</a> dedicated to exposing her racism; the person who made it wrote, &quot;Please show support to this page. Racism will not be tolerated and she clearly does not know that.&quot;</p>

<p>Ambrosia also called 93.7 WBLK early this morning to defend herself, saying the man &quot;almost ran over&quot; her son prior to the video starting; she also claimed that he called her a &quot;crackheaded cracker.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I&apos;m not a racist, I have a black cousin,&quot; she says. &quot;Quite frankly, if you look it up, n***** means an &apos;ignorant person,&apos; it has nothing to do with race.&quot; When pushed about saying that her son &apos;doesn&apos;t like black people,&apos; she added, &quot;Oh well, I don&apos;t even know what I said, I was pretty pissed off.&quot;</p>
