<p>Brenner was a favorite of Johnny Carson; he made his first appearance on <em>The Tonight Show</em> in January 1971, and went on to appear 158 times. In a recent <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506143820/http://www.cbsnews.com/videos/david-brenner-on-comedy-then-and-now/">interview on &quot;CBS This Morning,&quot;</a> Brenner recalled Carson&apos;s explanation as to why he was asked to perform stand-up on the show so often: <strong>&quot;He said, &#x2018;Because I like to sit back, smoke a cigarette and laugh for six minutes.&apos;</strong>&quot;</p>

He was family to me in the deepest, most supportive sense. His passing leaves a hole in my life that can never be replaced.&quot; </p>

<p>In addition to his many <em>Tonight Show</em> appearances, Brenner also penned several books and starred in four stand-up specials for HBO. He is survived by three children and his third wife, pairs skating champion Tai Babilonia.</p>
