<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none" style=" width:640px; "> <img alt="201110_chainsaw.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20111101203550im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/201110_chainsaw.jpg" width="640" height="350"> <br> <i>&quot;Don&apos;t be a buzzkill, man&quot;</i></div> <p></p>

<p>Is the video below&#x2014;in which a disgruntled driver cuts down a parking meter with a chainsaw&#x2014;real or fake? The internet <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111101203550/http://www.buzzfeed.com/scottmos/crazy-guy-cuts-off-parking-meter-after-argument-wi-4e1n">isn&apos;t quite</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111101203550/http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=004_1319545805">sure</a>, but the video has blown up in the meantime. The uploader writes: &quot;caught this on my iphone during a cab ride in brooklyn: a cop was giving these two guys a ticket because their van was parked by an expired parking meter and one of them got really mad and cut off the meter with a saw!!!&quot; Watch below:</p>

<p>At the end of the day, we don&apos;t think it really matters if it&apos;s real or not&#x2014;because once it&apos;s on the internet, there&apos;s bound to be copycats. There are still a few of these scattered around the city (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111101203550/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/19/manhattan_is_too_cool_for_single-sp.php">outside of Manhattan</a>), but once some impressionable, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111101203550/http://gothamist.com/tags/teens">nihilistic teenagers</a> get a look at this vid, we imagine there&apos;ll be even fewer of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111101203550/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/22/city_will_attempt_to_sell_51000_old.php">these relics</a> left.</p>
