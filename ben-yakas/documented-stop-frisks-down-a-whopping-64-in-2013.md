<p>Overall <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150103065053/http://gothamist.com/tags/stopandfrisk">stop-and-frisks</a>, stop-and-frisk complaints, and police misconduct complaints all decreased considerably last year, according to the latest report from the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150103065053/http://gothamist.com/tags/ccrb">Civilian Complaint Review Board</a> (CCRB). The annual report, which you can peruse in full below, reveals that the number of stop-and-frisk complaints dropped from 1,496 in 2012 to 1,364 in 2013, a 9% decrease.  </p>

<p>And most remarkably, the number of documented NYPD stop-and-frisks dropped an overall 64% from 533,042 in 2012 to 194,000 in 2013. As it happens, this decrease in documented stops comes in the wake of a change in NYPD policy: In March of last year, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150103065053/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/21/stop-and-frisk_trial_cops_say_they.php">in the midst of a landmark lawsuit</a> over stop-and-frisk, NYPD brass also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150103065053/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/27/nypd_changed_stop_frisk_policy_on_e.php">ordered officers to more thoroughly document</a> their stops on the so-called UF-250 forms.</p>

<p>Altogether, there were 5,410 complaints about police misconduct in 2013, a 6% decrease from 2012 and a 29% decrease from 2009, when a record 7,660 complaints were filed. The CCRB conducted 2,082 full investigations in 2013, successfully mediating 132 cases. </p>

<p>152 officers were disciplined by the NYPD for cases previously substantiated by the CCRB. </p>

<p>And it seems the CCRB is either getting better at investigating cases (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150103065053/http://gothamist.com/2012/11/28/ccrb_gets_stronger_but_will_people.php">possibly due to recent reforms</a>), or cases are becoming more easy to investigate: CCRB substantiated misconduct in 31% (191) of the stop-and-frisk cases that it investigated in 2013. By comparison, in 2010 and 2011 the substantiation rate was 16% and in 2012 the board substantiated misconduct in 27% of stop-and-frisk complaints.</p>

<p>A few more interesting pieces of information to draw out of the report: people were most likely to complain about an NYPD stop if they were also frisked. While officers documented searches in 9% of street encounters, 55% (745) of the 1,364 stop-related complaints in 2013 contained an allegation of an improper search; 40% of stop-and-frisk complaints included an allegation of improper force, a statistically insignificant change from 39% in 2012.</p>

<p>The CCRB notes that there should be an asterisk attached to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150103065053/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/14/police_brutality_complaints_dip_due.php">the first two months of 2013</a>: due to the after-effects of Hurricane Sandy, the CCRB&#x2019;s toll-free 800 number was out of service and was not restored until March 2013. Thus, there were 50% fewer calls for January and February in 2013 than there were in 2012, but they note, &quot;civilian complaints to the CCRB have been steadily declining since the highs of 2006-2009 when there were over 7,000 complaints per year.&quot;</p>
