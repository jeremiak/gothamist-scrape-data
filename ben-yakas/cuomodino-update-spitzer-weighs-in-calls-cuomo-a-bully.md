Especially former Governor and current CNN host <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110226115344/http://gothamist.com/tags/eliotspitzer">Eliot Spitzer</a>, who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110226115344/http://www.nydailynews.com/blogs/dailypolitics/2010/09/eliot-spitzer-everyone-knows-a.html">talked at length</a> about old sparring partner Cuomo on CNN&apos;s &quot;American Morning&quot; today (you can see the video below). He discussed how NY is really three states and the power of Paladino&apos;s populist rage, but mostly he said some harsh things about Cuomo, who he&apos;s had a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110226115344/http://www.nydailynews.com/blogs/dailypolitics/2010/04/is-spitzers-tee-off-on-cuomo-r.html">complicated history</a> with.</p>

<p>When asked what he thought Cuomo should do to engage the public, he all but called Cuomo a bully and thug: &quot;...of course, the problem that Andrew has is that everybody knows that behind the scenes, <strong>he is the dirtiest, nastiest political player out there </strong>and that is his reputation from years in Washington. When his father was governor, he was the tough guy. <strong>He has brass knuckles and he played hard ball. He has a lot of enemies out there. Nobody&apos;s been willing to stand up to him.</strong>&quot; </p>

<p>But now that Cuomo doesn&apos;t look as untouchable as he did before <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110226115344/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/22/new_poll_shows_paladino_closing_in.php">certain polls were released</a>, Spitzer imagines things may change in the Cuomo camp: &quot;When it appeared he was going to win, it was inevitable. If it appears not to be inevitable, things may change. He has a lot of folks, he&apos;s really been on the wrong side of who may stand up and say, wait a minute, he may not want to pretend he plays that game. He does, and he&apos;s worse at it.&quot;</p>
