</div></div>					<p>This morning, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501180743/http://gothamist.com/2012/09/21/photos_video_welcome_to_barclays_ce.php#photo-1">we got a close look</a> at the long-awaited <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501180743/http://gothamist.com/tags/barclayscenter">Barclays Center</a> at the ribbon cutting ceremony/unveiling. And in addition to taking in all the breakfast spreads and Marty Markowitz speeches, we caught a glimpse at some of the new food establishments available around the arena. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501180743/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/29/barclays_center_wants_to_serve_broo.php">And as promised</a>, it is a very Brooklyn-centric group of concessions.</p>

<p>There are 37 concession stands altogether in the arena. As you can see above, we spotted <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501180743/http://gothamist.com/tags/fattycue">Fatty &apos;Cue</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501180743/http://gothamist.com/tags/brooklynburger">Brooklyn Burger</a>, Paisano&apos;s, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501180743/http://gothamist.com/tags/calexico">Calexico</a>, and Brooklyn Bangers among the concession stands; in the luxury box area, we saw Clinton Hill Burgers, Fort Greene Grill and Stoli. Here are some more details on food offered, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501180743/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/26/dining/the-barclays-center-in-brooklyn-showcases-the-boroughs-food.html?hp">via the Times:</a></p>

<blockquote>The final selection is a mix of Brooklyn standbys like Nathan&#x2019;s Famous and L&amp;B; Spumoni Gardens and newer artisan entrepreneurs including McClure&#x2019;s Pickles, Brooklyn Cupcake and Calexico.

<p>Brooklyn Bangers, from the Michelin-starred chef Saul Bolton (of the restaurants Saul and The Vanderbilt), will offer brisket hot dogs ($9.75); Zakary Pelaccio of Fatty &#x2019;Cue will sell barbecue brisket and pork sandwiches ($13.75 and $12.75, respectively), and the Red Hook Lobster Pound will supply lobster rolls ($18.50).</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>Food operations will be managed by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501180743/http://www.levyrestaurants.com/">Levy Restaurants</a>, a food operator for the US Open and many other sports and entertainment venues. Developer Brett Ratner has dubbed the food &quot;Brooklyn Taste:&quot; &#x201C;Even before it became the food capital, there were 90 different ethnic groups,&#x201D; Ratner told the Times. &#x201C;We had an opportunity that almost nobody else ever had: to pick through all these different types of restaurants and foods and make it local.&#x201D; They add that there is talk of offering &#x201C;Brooklyn Taste&#x201D; cooking classes and a cookbook; no word on whether there will be any &quot;Brooklyn Taste&quot; monocle-holding lessons.</p>
