<p>For everyone who is unable to tune in to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140424033038/http://gawker.com/a-california-radio-station-has-been-playing-nelly-for-1-1544497911">all-Nelly, all-&quot;Hot In Herre&quot; radio station</a> in San Francisco, the video below is the next best way to add 100% more joy to your weekend.</p>

<p>The video, which was shot at Mystic Aquarium, shows musician Tom Leigh playing the Scottish smallpipes (a smaller version of the bagpipes) for Juno, Naluark and Kela, four of the beluga whales who reside in the Connecticut aquarium.</p>

<p>This of course isn&apos;t the first time that Juno and the gang has been serenaded by musicians: back in 2011, Mariachi Connecticut <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140424033038/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/03/video_mariachi_band_serenades_juno.php">played for the eager whales</a>. &quot;Juno paid attention the whole time we played,&quot; bandleader Eduardo Rocha told us at the time. &quot;He was very attentive and an excellent audience. He was knocking his head against the glass, like he was tipping his hat.&quot;</p>
