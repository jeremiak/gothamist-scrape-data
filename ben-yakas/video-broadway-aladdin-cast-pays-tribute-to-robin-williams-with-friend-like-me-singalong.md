<p>The cast of <em>Aladdin</em> on Broadway paid tribute to Robin Williams this week by asking the audience to participate in a singalong of one of his iconic performances. As you can see in the video below, the cast and audience were led by Tony Award winner James Iglehart in singing &quot;Friend Like Me&quot; in his honor. </p>

<p>&quot;When I was 17 years old, I had watched every Disney cartoon in the world,&quot; Iglehart, who plays Genie on Broadway, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504142426/http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/theater-arts/robin-williams-honored-aladdin-cast-braodway-article-1.1903465">told the crowd</a>. &quot;And they had put [Williams] in a Disney cartoon to play this iconic role of the Genie&#x2026;and he sang [&quot;Friend Like Me&quot;], and I looked at my mom and I said, &apos;If I could just do something like that.&apos;&quot; Below, you can see Williams&apos;s version from the movie.</p>
