Earlier this summer, a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424161125/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2013/06/18/brooklyn-da-man-indicted-for-training-dogs-for-dog-fighting/">Brooklyn man was indicted</a> on dozens of charges for torturing and injuring animals as part of a pit bull fighting ring. Seven pit bulls were removed from the home of 39-year-old Leslie Alexander in May. But now, those seven adult dogs have been rehabilitated by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424161125/http://www.nycacc.org/">Animal Care and Control</a>&#x2014;three of them still need to be adopted, and there is also a litter of eight adorable puppies available, as you can see in the photos above.</p>

<p>Two of the dogs had come in pregnant and had 16 puppies between them (half of them have already been placed in homes). Authorities say that along with the dogs, they found 25 dog kennels, treadmills, syringes, a stick used to break a dog&#x2019;s grip on another animal or object, and scales with rope attachments used to strengthen a dog&apos;s jaws.</p>

<p>&quot;Considering their background and what they had to go through and endure, our hope is that someone will have a soft spot in their heart and give them a second chance by adopting,&quot; AC&amp;C; spokesman Richard Gentles <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424161125/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/show-dogs-puppy-love-article-1.1427119">said.</a></p>

<p>AC&amp;C; say that all adoptions include spay/neuter, vaccinations, a pre-registered microchip, an identification tag, one month of free pet health insurance, and a certificate for a free initial exam at a participating vet. If you&apos;re interested in adopting any of the adults of puppies, you can email adoption@nycacc.org. You can also meet Luis and Judy in person in the Brooklyn Care Center located at 2336 Linden Boulevard, Brooklyn. </p>
