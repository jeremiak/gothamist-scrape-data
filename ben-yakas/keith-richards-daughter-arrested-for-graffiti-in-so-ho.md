Richards was allegedly scrawling &quot;TNA&quot; (with a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110624104024/http://www.tmz.com/2011/03/02/keith-richards-daughter-arrested-model-theodora-richards-rolling-stones/">&quot;paint marker&quot;</a>) on the building on Spring Street, which houses St. Anthony&apos;s Convent, when police caught her late last night; she also had marijuana and Xanax pills on her person. She was charged with making graffiti, possession of a graffiti instrument and possession of a controlled substance. </p>

<p>Richards, 25, has modeled for a Tommy Hilfiger campaign and appeared in various fashion magazines, including Vogue, Glamour and Rolling Stone. Unlike her hard-living father, who is notorious for his heroin-fueled exploits with the Stones, Richards <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110624104024/http://www.femalefirst.co.uk/celebrity/Theodora+Richards-11019.html">told FemaleFirst</a> that she wasn&apos;t really into drugs: &quot;My dad&apos;s generation was all about rebellion. I&apos;m rebelling against my generation in a softer way. Many of the kids around me just want to go out and party every night but I don&apos;t. I&apos;m not a big fan of drugs. Everybody&apos;s had their own experience.&quot; But what&apos;s more rebellious than <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110624104024/http://gothamist.com/2010/12/08/keith_richards_killed_an_orchid.php">smoking cigarettes</a> in the NY Public Library?</p>

<p>As for her &quot;TNA&quot; message, we have two major theories: maybe she&apos;s a part of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110624104024/http://streetfiles.org/search/Tna">TNA graffiti crew</a>, or she&apos;s a huge <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110624104024/http://www.tnawrestlingnews.com/">Total Nonstop Action Wrestling</a> aficionado. Reader David Webb posits his own idea: &quot;I have a theory about her tag.  Given the photograph of her in lingerie, might not TNA stand for &quot;Tits -n- ass&quot;?&quot;</p>
