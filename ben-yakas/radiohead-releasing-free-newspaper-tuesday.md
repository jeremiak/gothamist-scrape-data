<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:365px; "> <img alt="32511radiohead.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110327041500im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/32511radiohead.jpg" width="365" height="439"> <br> <i>via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110327041500/http://www.ateaseweb.com/2011/03/24/radiohead-to-issue-newspaper-the-universal-sigh-on-monday/">ateaseweb</a></i></div> It was just over a month ago that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110327041500/http://gothamist.com/tags/radiohead">Radiohead</a> made their surprise eighth album, <em>The King of Limbs</em>, available to download, and across the land people <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110327041500/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/19/dancing_thom_yorke.php">danced like Thom Yorke</a> and were merry. Now with the physical release of the understated, glitchy eight-track album coming next week, Radiohead have made another surprise announcement: the band has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110327041500/http://theuniversalsigh.com/">produced a newspaper</a> called &quot;The Universal Sigh&quot; (a line from standout track &quot;Bloom&quot;) which it is giving out for free around the world next week!<p></p>

<p>&quot;The Universal Sigh&quot; is not to be confused with Radiohead&apos;s &quot;newspaper album&quot; option for <em>The King Of Limbs,</em> which contains hundreds of pieces of artwork, and which won&apos;t be released until late May. Radiohead add that the event will not be repeated, and this is not a live performance by the band...which doesn&apos;t address the (albeit unlikely) possibility of new songs somehow emerging out of this giveaway. Radiohead junkies are still <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110327041500/http://thekingoflimbspart2.com/">holding out hope</a> that new material will be released at some point in the near future. Also, it would be nice if they played a freaking concert in New York sometime this decade. </p>

<p>There are three NYC locations to pick up the newspaper on Tuesday, which will be available starting at 1 p.m., and are sure to go quick. They <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110327041500/http://theuniversalsigh.com/environment/">also add</a> that the project will be environmentally-friendly: &quot;Radiohead will measure the carbon footprint of this project, and to offset the potential ecological impact we will retire the carbon credits used.&quot; The locations can be found in the map below:</p>
