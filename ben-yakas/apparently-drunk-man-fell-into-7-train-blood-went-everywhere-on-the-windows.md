<p>A man stumbled into the side of a train and badly injured himself this morning. According to FDNY, the incident happened around 10:30 a.m. at the Junction Boulevard station in Queens. They say that the man, who is said to be in his 20s, fell and hit his head on the 7 train as it was pulling out of the station. </p>

<p>MTA confirmed the man &quot;stumbled into&quot; the side of the train. According to the latest report, the man is currently awake, breathing, and bleeding from the head. First responders are still at the scene waiting for the man to be transported, and an FDNY spokesman added that the man &quot;seems to be intoxicated.&quot; If you want an idea of what it looks like when someone falls into a train, you can see a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407133004/https://twitter.com/sawuonthetrain/status/306770480189292544">video of such an event from last year here.</a></p>
