Except that he&apos;s not really a Vietnam vet. And he has both of his arms. <p></p>

<p>A Post photographer snapped a shot of McMahon with both arms out after a day of begging for change, and they were pissed at the scam: &quot;he carries on with his wounded-soldier act, day after day, weaving through traffic and occasionally cursing out people who refuse to give.&quot; They discovered that there&apos;s no record of him in the Marines or in Vietnam, and he has a rap sheet of 20 arrests, many for disorderly conduct and &quot;fraudulent accosting&quot; (aka, being a scammer). &quot;<strong>He&apos;s been doing the fake-arm thing for at least 20 years. He&apos;s crazy as a bat. Everyone around here knows about it</strong>,&quot; said Robert Gainey, a vet who did two tours in Vietnam.</p>
