<p>It&apos;s unclear how exactly the dog in the video below got stuck on the ledge on Court Street, across from Carroll Park. But the little guy was apparently trapped by the window guard, and was very obviously scared&#x2014;he almost fell a few times before he was ultimately rescued by the FDNY. The real story here is that no <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150928122206/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/13/fdny_rescues_nypd_officer_trying_to.php">cops got stuck</a> while trying to rescue the doggy. That&apos;s progress!</p>
