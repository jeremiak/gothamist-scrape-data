<p>Now that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508154911/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/15/video_bruce_springsteen_jimmy_fallo.php">Bruce Springsteen</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508154911/http://gothamist.com/2014/04/09/watch_chris_christie_get_very_uncom.php">Joy Behar</a>, and every late night host in the United States have paved the way for other comedians to make <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508154911/http://gothamist.com/tags/chrischristie">Chris Christie</a>/Bridgegate jokes, <em>Family Guy</em> is getting in on the action. The show sent out a flier to Emmy voters this week asking them to name the show &quot;best animated program,&quot; and warning, &quot;Vote for us, or it&#x2019;s time for some traffic problems in Brentwood.&quot; Who knew manatees <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508154911/http://www.southparkstudios.com/clips/103666/idea-balls">could be so witty</a>! </p>

<p>For NYers who don&apos;t quite believe America stretches beyond the tri-state area, Brentwood is the Los Angeles neighborhood where many Emmy voters live. The warning of course is a reference to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508154911/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/08/top_christie_aide_emailed_time_for.php">an email written by</a> former Christie aide Bridget Anne Kelly, who said about the closures: &quot;It&apos;s time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee.&quot; As for the cones, that likely references <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508154911/http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2013/12/christie_on_fort_lee.html">comments Christie made in December 2013</a> when he joked at an early Bridgegate press conference, &quot;I worked the cones. Unbeknownst to anyone, I was working the cones.&quot;</p>

<p>And now that we&apos;ve taken apart the joke piece by piece, clearly it&apos;s twice as funny as it was before. Hey, at least they kept away from the low-hanging <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508154911/http://gothamist.com/2014/04/25/lol_obesity.php">fat jokes</a>. Christie does not appreciate those.</p>

<p>It sure is a good thing for them that Christie has no interest in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508154911/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/08/chris_christie_i_had_no_idea_my_top.php">payback politics.</a> This was relatively tame for <em>Family Guy</em>, who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508154911/http://insidetv.ew.com/2014/04/24/family-guy-emmy-chris-christie/">previously besieged</a> Emmy voters by mocking the film <em>Precious</em> (&quot;Vote for us or you&#x2019;re racist&quot;) and <em>Girls</em> (&quot;Here&#x2019;s a load of comedy to shoot on your chest&quot;).</p>
