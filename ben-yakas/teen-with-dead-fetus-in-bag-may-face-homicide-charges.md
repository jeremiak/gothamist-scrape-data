<p>Yesterday, two teens were allegedly shoplifting at the Herald Square Victoria&apos;s Secret when police found a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131021173625/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/17/shoplifters_reportedly_arrested_fou.php">dead fetus in one of their bags</a>. Tiana Rodriguez, 17, and Francis Estevez, 17, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131021173625/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/18/teen_with_dead_fetus_in_bag_charged.php">have both been charged</a> with petit larceny and criminal possession of stolen property. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131021173625/http://nypost.com/2013/10/18/mom-of-victorias-secret-baby-facing-homicide-charges/">According to the Post,</a> the autopsy report states that the baby died of asphyxiation soon after being born alive at full-term, and Rodriguez, the mother, may be facing additional homicide charges.</p>

<p>According to the police, they were called to the store at 1:24 p.m. because security officers had pulled the teens aside and checked their bags due to a &quot;strong odor and found a fetus inside the bag&quot; of Rodriguez. Rodriguez, who already has a toddler, reportedly told cops that the baby wasn&apos;t full-term, &quot;she suffered a miscarriage&quot; on Wednesday, and she didn&apos;t know what to do with the fetus. The teens are expected to be arraigned at Manhattan Criminal Court later today.</p>

<p>Friends and onlookers told local papers that they thought Rodriguez had to have mental troubles to carry around a fetus. &#x201C;That&#x2019;s horrible,&#x201D; shopper Yvonne Sonera <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131021173625/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/dead-fetus-found-bag-midtown-store-article-1.1488876">told the Daily News</a>. &#x201C;She must be going through a big depression. She must have been wondering how she was going to get rid of it.&quot;<br>
