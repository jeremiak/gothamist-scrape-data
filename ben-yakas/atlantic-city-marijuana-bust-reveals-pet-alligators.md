<p>Atlantic City police thought they were dealing with a normal <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140326003433/http://gothamist.com/tags/marijuana">marijuana</a> bust when they raided an alleged drug dealer&#x2019;s home Friday. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140326003433/http://www.pressofatlanticcity.com/news/press/atlantic_city/two-alligators-confiscated-as-part-of-atlantic-city-marijuana-bust/article_4bfebe2a-e0dc-11e0-98bf-001cc4c002e0.html">They seized a pound of weed</a>, a gun, hollow point bullets, and money which they believe is profit from the suspect&apos;s pot-dealing business. Oh, and they also found two pet alligators.</p>

<p>Alleged dealer Kemyatta (Kenyatta) Johnson, 38, was arrested by police on several drug and weapon charges, and is being held on $100,000 bail. The baby alligators, which were inside an aquarium in the home, were approximately 2-feet-long. Unlike a responsible burgeoning James Bond villain, who would make sure to cross his t&apos;s when it comes to spy-dining companions, Johnson did not have a reptile license, and the animals were turned over to the Humane Society. Maybe they can make it in Hollywood yet:</p>
