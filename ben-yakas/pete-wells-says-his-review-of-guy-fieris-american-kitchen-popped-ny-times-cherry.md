<p>This week, the New Yorker has a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170901040008/http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/09/12/pete-wells-the-new-york-times-restaurant-critic">giant profile of NY Times food critic/restaurant assassin Pete Wells</a> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170901040008/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/12/per_nay_jose.php">RIP Per Se bong water</a>), and it is one of the best things you&apos;re going to read this week. In addition to granting us a glimpse into the feisty world of food reviewing and how Wells conducts his business, it is chock-full of memorable anecdotes and Wells&apos; reflections on some of his most infamous reviews&#x2014;including <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170901040008/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/14/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-guys-american-kitchen-bar-in-times-square.html?pagewanted=all">his classic takedown</a> of Guy Fieri&apos;s formaldehyde factory Guy&apos;s American Kitchen &amp; Bar.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170901040008/http://gothamist.com/2012/11/14/have_your_read_the_timess_amazing_a.php">Back in 2012</a>, Wells wrote a scathing restaurant review of the Times Square monstrosity written entirely in the form of questions; the piece became the paper&apos;s fifth-most-e-mailed article of that year. </p>

<blockquote>A review of a bad restaurant seems to expand its writer&#x2019;s reach more than an unhappy review of a book or a film. A restaurant can deceive, humiliate, and poison us in a way that &#x201C;Zoolander 2&#x201D; cannot. In the case of Guy&#x2019;s American Kitchen, readers were shown two compelling, class-tinged power struggles: one involved an absent, wealthy celebrity and his exploited customers; the other set the institution of the Times against the institution of Guy. As Wells put it, &#x201C;One would not think they exist in the same universe. It&#x2019;s like Deadpool on &#x2018;Downton Abbey.&#x2019; &#x201D; His rejection of Guy&#x2019;s American Kitchen was, he assured me, not inevitable: even if he was not truly confounded by a lack of authenticity in a mega-restaurant spun off from reality-television self-caricature, his hope for something good could nevertheless be real. Shortly after the review appeared, he told Margaret Sullivan, then the Times&#x2019; public editor, &#x201C;I would have liked to write the &#x2018;man bites dog&#x2019; review.&#x201D; He went on, &#x201C;This is important American food that makes a lot of people very happy. And, since that&#x2019;s the case, you ought to do it right.&#x201D;

<p>The column appeared online on a Tuesday. Wells was immediately overwhelmed by e-mail and Twitter reactions. &#x201C;I remember having to walk away from my computer,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;It was like a pinball machine&#x2014;everything was lighting up.&#x201D; Some Fieri fans wished harm on his family. Editors at other publications assigned think pieces about Fieri: journalism&#x2019;s pilot fish, nibbling on flesh snagged between the predator&#x2019;s teeth. That night, &#x201C;Good Morning America&#x201D; sent a reporter to the restaurant, to review Wells&#x2019;s review, while shooting undercover video of French fries.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>The success of the review led Wells to note that &quot;people said that the Times had lost its virginity,&quot; meaning that the Times would scramble to replicate the viral success of the piece in the future (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170901040008/https://www.buzzfeed.com/mylestanzer/exclusive-times-internal-report-painted-dire-digital-picture?utm_term=.neelZrbMD#.oje4zOwQP">which...well...</a>). It also may have gone to Wells&apos; head a bit:</p>

<blockquote>In October, Wells appeared at the Southern Foodways Alliance, an annual event held in Oxford, Mississippi. Wearing a highwayman&#x2019;s mask, and billed only as the Masked Avenger, he walked onstage, read the Fieri review to a live piano accompaniment, then walked off. Although the article was relevant to the event&#x2019;s theme&#x2014;Southern food in popular culture&#x2014;one member of the audience still found the performance a little unbecoming, &#x201C;like a musician who had one hit and is singing it, a cappella, years later.&#x201D; The observer added, &#x201C;There may have been a cape.&#x201D; Wells told me that he wore a Gandalf robe belonging to the son of the event&#x2019;s organizer.</blockquote>

<p>The story is bookended by Wells going to review David Chang&apos;s Momofuku Nishi; Chang compared the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170901040008/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/18/dining/momofuku-nishi-review.html">resulting review</a> to &quot;something akin to a diagnosis of terminal cancer.&quot; The last several paragraphs of the profile are devoted to Chang railing against Wells (&quot;I can&#x2019;t ever read that review again&#x2014;I&#x2019;ll get so fucking angry I&#x2019;ll die&quot;), calling him &quot;a fucking bully&quot; who has led to him losing business. Chang offered his own take on the reviewer&apos;s psyche:</p>

<blockquote>&#x201C;New York City is now not the city that we moved to when we moved here.&#x201D; Wells thrives on discovery, Chang said, but he&#x2019;s looking in the wrong places. &#x201C;We live in a digital world, and Pete still lives in an analog world,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;He wants the new, but he&#x2019;s still in love with the fucking old. And I don&#x2019;t think he has reconciled that with himself. I think Pete Wells reviews on nostalgia.&#x201D;</blockquote>

<p>Other things we learned in the piece: Guy Fieri was raised by parents who ate a macrobiotic diet (this explains a lot); Wells dined one time at Se&#xF1;or Frog&apos;s with Jason Biggs (&quot;Here I am with the New York Times food critic, who can make or break a restaurant, and here he is dancing a conga line, doing sugary shots, while a house band is singing the shittiest music in the world.&quot;); Wells often has a slower meal than other diners &quot;because dishes get done again and again until they are deemed exemplary;&quot; and Wells has some controversial views on the current NYC dining scene: <strong>&quot;If you look at where the good food is in New York, it&#x2019;s really in Manhattan and Queens,&#x201D; he said. &quot;I&#x2019;m sorry, other boroughs, I&#x2019;m sorry.&quot;</strong><br>
