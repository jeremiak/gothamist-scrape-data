<p>Over the last year or so, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507075013/http://gothamist.com/tags/jerryseinfeld">Jerry Seinfeld</a> has really embraced this whole internet THING, between the archives <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507075013/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/04/video_whats_the_deal_with_the_new_s.php">on his website</a>, his car and coffee-obsessed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507075013/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/12/video_has_jerry_seinfeld_finally_ma.php">web series</a>, and his NY Times <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507075013/http://www.nytimes.com/video/2012/12/20/magazine/100000001965963/jerry-seinfeld-how-to-write-a-joke-.html">feature on how to write a joke</a>. Now that he&apos;s mastered that, he&apos;s moving on to music <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507075013/http://www.vulture.com/2013/01/wale-and-seinfeld-making-an-album-about-nothing.html">by teaming up with</a> rapper and noted <em>Seinfeld</em> aficionado Wale for <em>The Album About Nothing.</em> And of course, it all came together in a very Seinfeldian manner, as he explained in the video below.</p>

<p>Wale&apos;s breakout mixtape was 2008&apos;s <em>Seinfeld</em>-inspired <em>The Mixtape About Nothing</em>, which featured clips from the show. Wale followed that in 2010 with the sequel <em>More About Nothing</em>. It seems Seinfeld was vaguely aware of this, and subsequently hung out with Wale after a concert this year. But here&apos;s the part where things get a little weird and Seinfeldian:</p>

<blockquote>He wanted me to do something with him. I didn&apos;t understand it, but he did and then I kind of liked the guy, I dug the guy, and I listened to his music, I liked the music. So I said alright, I&apos;ll do it, even though I didn&apos;t know what I was going to do. So I said to my wife, &apos;I&apos;m doing this thing with this guy Wale&apos; and she said, &apos;Wale is my favorite hip-hop artist. I have every single thing.&apos; Somehow, she missed anything that had to do with me, but has every other cut, everything else he&apos;s done. I said, &apos;Just type in Wale and me and see what comes up.&apos;</blockquote>

<p>We can&apos;t wait till the Larry David-inspired followup, perhaps titled, <em>The Pretty, Pretty, Pretty Good Album</em> or <em>Ehhh, A Little Too Saucy</em>.</p>
