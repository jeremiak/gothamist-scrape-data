<p>An unscientific but totally accurate study conducted at Gothamist HQ today found that 9 out of 10 human beings identify <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501174800/http://gothamist.com/tags/woodyallen">Woody Allen</a> as the &quot;stereotypical Jewish person.&quot; At this point, Woody Allen is indivisible from his signature black horn rimmed-style glasses. And yet, for some people, that just isn&apos;t Jewish enough. A Brooklyn yeshiva has reportedly banned Woody Allen-style glasses for being &quot;too goyish&quot; and too &quot;modern.&quot;</p>

<p>Bobov 48, located in Borough Park, handed down the decree recently, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501174800/http://failedmessiah.typepad.com/failed_messiahcom/2013/04/bobov-48-yeshiva-bans-all-children-to-wear-modern-glasses-with-thick-black-frames-because-its-too-go-345.html">according to Failed Messiah</a>. We don&apos;t profess to know Yiddish well enough <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501174800/http://failedmessiah.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451b71f69e2017d430c42ed970c-pi">to read the letter in question</a> (though, if any of you do, please let us know exactly what it says!), but we&apos;re trusting Failed Messiah&apos;s sources on this one. Suffice to say, there is nothing in the universe goyish about the person worrying about &quot;Jew eat&quot; in the clip below.</p>
