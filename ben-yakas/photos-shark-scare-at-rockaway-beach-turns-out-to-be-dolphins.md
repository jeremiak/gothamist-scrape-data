<p>A pleasant Saturday afternoon at Rockaway Beach descended into confusion, chaos, and a cacophony of whistles when lifeguards alerted beachgoers about a possible shark sighting in the water. The sighting occurred around 4 p.m. near Beach 96th&#x2014;and during Shark Week no less.</p>

<p>Baby sharks have of course been spotted at the beach in the past:</p>

<p>Area man Max Rivlin-Nadler was at the scene soaking in the good vibrations when the commotion happened: &quot;The lifeguards ordered everyone out of the water, except one gentleman decided to approach the dolphin (or shark) pod.&quot;</p>

<p>That man may have been a Red Sox fan:</p>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Everyone at Rockaway beach was just told 2 get out bc of a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150513081555/https://twitter.com/hashtag/shark?src=hash">#shark</a> in the water.

<p>Rivlin-Nadler was introspective about the experience: &quot;They looked like dolphins. But then again, perhaps they were sharks? Either way, we live in a world of danger, where even a day at the beach can become a spectacle, surrounded by hundreds of fellow New Yorkers breathlessly wondering, &apos;shark or dolphin?&apos; Or, &apos;is that guy who was selling nutcracker&apos;s still around?&apos;&quot;</p>

<p>Whether he was or wasn&apos;t still around, we know one thing for sure: it&apos;s never okay to run into the water to try to touch sharks, but it is perfectly reasonable to do so to try to touch dolphins.</p>
