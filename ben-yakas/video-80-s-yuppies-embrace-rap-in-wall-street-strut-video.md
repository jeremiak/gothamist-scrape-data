<p>We interrupt your sedate Super Bowl weekend to bring you the most important novelty rap music video of the 1980s or perhaps of any time since the invention of the moving camera: &quot;Wall Street Strut&quot; by The Wall Street Rappers. It&apos;s got everything you could want in a video: yuppies, breakdancing, dollar signs instead of S&apos;s, inexplicable seizure-like dancing, creepy sexual metaphors involving squash, and a vocal performance comparable to AC/DC&apos;s &quot;Big Balls.&quot;</p>

<p>Amazingly, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501161910/http://www.newyorker.com/archive/1985/07/01/1985_07_01_024_TNY_CARDS_000341348">the New Yorker had</a> a Talk of the Town piece on the video shoot in 1985, in which the producer explains that the video tells the story &quot;of a yuppie stockbroker who freaks out in his office one day because he is overburdened with work.&quot; Over 30 real Wall Street workers were used in the video, with scenes filmed in the offices of Henderson Brothers, in Harry&apos;s Restaurant, and in front of the World Trade Center. Also, the producer became convinced that &quot;there&apos;s an actor lurking under every pin-striped suit in town.&quot;</p>
