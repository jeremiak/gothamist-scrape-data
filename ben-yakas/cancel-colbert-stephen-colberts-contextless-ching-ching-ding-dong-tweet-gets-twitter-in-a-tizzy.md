<p>On Wednesday, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429214348/http://gothamist.com/tags/stephencolbert">Stephen Colbert</a> went after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429214348/http://dcist.com/tags/washingtonfootballteam">Washington R*dskins</a> owner Dan Snyder for his stubborn refusal to change the name of the team, despite the fact that, you know, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429214348/http://dcist.com/2013/02/we_are_very_proud_to_omit_the_name.php">&quot;R*dskins&quot; is a racist slur.</a> The clip, which you can watch below, was classic Colbert, using his &quot;wilfully [sic] ignorant&quot; character to mercilessly satirize a real issue. It was yet another in a long line of similar Colbert segments&#x2014;but because of an out-of-context Tweet, the #CancelColbert hashtag was born... nearly a day after the actual segment aired.</p>

<p>&quot;I am willing to show #Asian community I care by introducing the Ching-Chong Ding-Dong Foundation for Sensitivity to Orientals or Whatever,&quot; read the now-deleted tweet, made by the show&#x2019;s Twitter (not Colbert&apos;s personal Twitter). The #CancelColbert hashtag was started sometimes Thursday evening by Suey Park (who previously started the #NotYourAsianSidekick hashtag)&#x2014;you can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429214348/https://twitter.com/suey_park">peruse her feed to get a taste of some of the outrage.</a> </p>

Colbert himself Tweeted:</p>

<p>This wasn&apos;t even the first time Colbert has used the <em>purposefully</em> offensive Ching Chong Ding Dong character to call out someone in real life: back in 2011, Colbert pulled the character out to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429214348/http://thecolbertreport.cc.com/videos/091ydv/rush-limbaugh-speaks-chinese">mock Rush Limbaugh&apos;s attempts at speaking Chinese.</a></p>

<p>As <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429214348/http://www.thewire.com/national/2014/03/colbert-report-joke-deemed-more-offensive-than-other-colbert-report-jokes/359765/">The Wire writes</a>:</p>

<blockquote>Colbert&#x2019;s entire schtick is playing a more overt caricature of conservative talking heads, making their implicit racism explicit in what is now an extended, decade-long bit. That one line &#x2014; when divorced from context &#x2014; appeared to just be a racist quip possibly illustrates the point. It&apos;s cranking offensiveness up so far as to be inherently unbelievable. Again, react however you choose, but this sort of thing is Colbert&#x2019;s bread and butter.</blockquote>

<p>WSJ.com columnist Jeff Yang, who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429214348/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/21/jeff_yang_on_espns_terrible_headlin.php">railed against ESPN.com&apos;s &quot;Chinks In Armor&quot;</a> headline during Linsanity, wrote <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429214348/https://www.facebook.com/originalspin/posts/10202160445987350?stream_ref=10">on Facebook</a> that everyone needs to calm down:</p>

<blockquote>I&apos;m sorry, the whole #&#x200E;CancelColbert campaign is ridiculous and makes it seem like those who are leading it either don&apos;t watch Colbert or don&apos;t get him. The whole point of that episode was that he&apos;s satirizing the hypocrisy of the Redskins for trying to distract from their racist name by setting up a lame &quot;foundation&quot; in support of &quot;Original Americans.&quot; He transposed that joke to Asians by way of illustration, but it could have been any race or ethnicity--and in the past it has been, because Colbert is enacting a parody of a racist, elitist, false-populist equal opportunity offender right wing noisemaker.

<p>This shouldn&apos;t require explanation and the people boosting this campaign are sacrificing credibility and damaging our ability to work toward addressing real issues (and real racists).</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>Or to put it another way: meaningful conversation on Twitter is already tough enough without having to deal with out-of-context bullshit like this clogging our feeds.</p>
