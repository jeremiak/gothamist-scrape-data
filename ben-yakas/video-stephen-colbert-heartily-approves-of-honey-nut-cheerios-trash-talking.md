	<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2013_01_ohsnap.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130606035640im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/2013_01_ohsnap.jpg" width="640" height="443" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>It seems that the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130606035640/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/09/carmelo_anthony_lost_cool_when_kevi.php">Carmelo Anthony/Kevin Garnett trash talking feud</a> has been as entertaining for Stephen Colbert as it has been for the rest of NYC. On his program last night, Colbert gave Garnett a tip of the hat for integrating product placement into his trash talking, inadvertently setting off the hottest new sports trend: &quot;Forget gym shoes or Sprite. From now on, all NBA games should be filled with athletes incorporating national brands into their taunting: &apos;Yo mama&apos;s so fat she should switch to Chobani non-fat Greek yogurt, now with active probiotics!&apos;&quot;</p>

<p>Funny enough, the lady so favorably compared to Honey Nut Cheerios kinda agrees: &quot;Not for nothing,but we ALL deserve a check or some free cereal 4all the publicity we&apos;ve given Honey Nut Cheerios! LOL,&quot; LaLa Vasquez <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130606035640/https://twitter.com/lala/status/289574406685081600">Tweeted</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130606035640/http://instagram.com/p/UVB6aLRjS1/">Instagramed last night</a>, commenting publicly on the scandal for the first time since <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130606035640/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/10/doc_rivers_kg_never_said_lala_taste.php">her estranged husband</a> and Garnett got into it earlier this week. The NY Post <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130606035640/http://www.nypost.com/p/pagesix/la_la_anthony_responds_to_honey_GuxaESzlUQfTtU7MiyPfSM">also weighed in</a>: &quot;Though she did not confirm or deny rumors, General Mills might be the only one winning in this situation&quot;</p>

<p>Anthony returns tonight after his one game suspension over the Garnett incident. He&apos;ll join the Knicks to face against the Chicago Bulls at MSG&#x2014;and hopefully he can show off some <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130606035640/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_breakfast_cereals">Razzle Dazzle Rice Krispies moves and won&apos;t play like Frosted Shredded Wheat, because that would be totally Wackies.</a></p>
