                            <p><strong>The National Return</strong><br>
As we <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131207114113/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/05/week_in_rock_motionless_animals_dan.php">hinted last week</a>, the National played the first of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131207114113/http://www.brooklynvegan.com/archives/2010/03/the_national_na.html">two &quot;secret&quot; shows</a> last night at the Bell House in Gowanus as a warm-up for their upcoming tour behind new album <em>High Violet</em>. The band played an 18-song set for the cramped, sold-out crowd (which included a beardless Michael Stipe!), augmented by 5 other musicians, including a small horns section and a violin player. Although there were nearly as many people on-stage as you&apos;d find at a Broken Social Scene concert, the arrangements never felt indulgent or flashy. The older songs, including a raucous &quot;Abel&quot; and the superb <em>Boxer</em>-trilogy &quot;Slow Show,&quot; &quot;Apartment Story,&quot; and &quot;Start a War,&quot; were all more muscular than their recorded versions. </p>

<p>It was a very fun night; what else can you call an evening when lead singer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131207114113/http://gothamist.com/2008/02/21/matt_berninger.php">Matt Berninger</a> continually flashes devil&apos;s horns (albeit, it was a sign to their sound person to turn up the reverb, but still). The band looked delighted throughout the entire set, Berninger in particular; he was equally traipsing and lunging around the stage, sometimes with goblet of wine in hand, sometimes throwing his newly-bought mic stand around. During the encore, he walked into the audience, straining his vocals and elating fans during a jet-fueled &quot;Mr November.&quot; </p>

<p>The bulk of the set was a showcase for 11 new tunes (most likely all from the upcoming LP); on the whole, the new songs sound like a summation of (and progression from) their last two major albums, taking the tension-filled skeletons of the <em>Boxer</em>-era songs and injecting <em>Alligator&apos;s</em> guitar-catharsis, with slightly expanded arrangements. Highlights included set opener &quot;Blood Buzz, Ohio,&quot; slow burner &quot;Vanderlylle Cry Baby&quot; (you can see video <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131207114113/http://pitchfork.com/news/38174-video-the-national-play-new-song-vanderlylle-cry-baby-in-brooklyn/">here</a>), rocking &quot;Conversation 16,&quot; and the already-classic ballad &quot;Runaway.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131207114113/http://themusicslut.com/2010/03/the-national-the-bell-house-give-me-the-keys/">Here&apos;s the full setlist</a>, and below, you can see a video of last night&apos;s set-closer &quot;Fake Empire.&quot;</p>
