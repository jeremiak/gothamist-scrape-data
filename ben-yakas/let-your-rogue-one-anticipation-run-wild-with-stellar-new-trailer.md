<p>Do you like watching AT-ATs shoot laser beams at panicking crowds? Do you enjoy listening to vaguely mystic blind warriors waxing poetic about The Force? </p>

<p>Do you get off on wide-angle vistas featuring Ben Mendelsohn&apos;s white cape flapping in the wind? Do you go nuts for new robots who are voiced by the great Alan Tudyk (and who seems to be channeling Anthony Daniels)? </p>

<p>Do you think Forest Whitaker does his best work when he looks like he hasn&apos;t slept in a few days? Do you go batshit for glimpses of Darth Vader, no matter how minor the tease? </p>

<p>Are you kind of sick of stories involving the Death Star or Starkiller Base or any other giant planet-killing machine but willing to put up with it one more time because a) remaking <em>The Dirty Dozen</em> in space is a great idea for a film; b) you&apos;ve accepted that there will be new <em>Star Wars</em> movies for the rest of your life and you like the idea of more anthology films set in the universe rather than just stretching out the Skywalker family saga another three movies; and/or c) you have a huge crush on Felicity Jones and just want her to be happy and successful? </p>

<p>And most of all, do you live for the sound and sight of Mads Mikkelsen being a badass in space? If so, then press play already on the latest&#x2014;and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110084820/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/07/rogue_one_star_wars_trailer.php">by far best</a>&#x2014;trailer for <em>Rogue One: A Star Wars Story</em>, what are you waiting for?!</p>
