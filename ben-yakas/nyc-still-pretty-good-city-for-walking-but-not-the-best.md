<p>A new scientific study done by those pocket-protecting eggheads over at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150530045619/http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2010/12/americas-most-walkable-cities/67988/">Atlantic Monthly</a> says that NYC has ranked as one of the top five most walkable cities in America. But why aren&apos;t we number one? Because standing in our way is the god-forsaken, gay pothead homeless persons paradise that is San Francisco. </p>

<p>According <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150530045619/http://www.walkscore.com/NY/New_York">to Walkscore</a>, we&apos;ve got really, really walkable neighborhoods (including perfect walking scores for Little Italy, Garment District, Greenwich Village, Tribeca, Financial District, and West Village). Now, we don&apos;t have a clue what any of this really means, but we do know for sure that we&apos;ve been robbed. So watch out San Francisco: we&apos;d hate it if you had some sort of &quot;accident,&quot; and lost the use of those pretty little legs of yours.</p>
