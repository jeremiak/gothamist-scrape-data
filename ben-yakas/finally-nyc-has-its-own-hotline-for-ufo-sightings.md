										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="41011ufo.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504153901im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/41011ufo.jpg" width="260" height="305" class="image-left"> </span>A Brooklyn man has started a 24-hour UFO hotline, empowering NYers to testify to their close encounters with freaky creatures who don&apos;t live off the L. &quot;How is anybody going to report this stuff if everyone is discouraging them? I&apos;m looking at witnesses as a resource rather than someone to slam around,&quot; founder Joe Capp <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504153901/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/klyn_hotline_fields_reports_of_illegal_Jyu6o1wVPLYJPooRLNXpiN?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">told the Post</a>. We&apos;re relieved, since for too long, NYers have had nowhere to go with their dramatic tales and footage of unidentified objects...except for all the dallies, countless UFO websites and message boards, etc.</p>

<p>Capp, a retired computer consultant in Sheepshead Bay, started the hotline in February, and says he&apos;s fielded nearly two dozen calls already. He says the most memorable sighting he&apos;s received has been from a woman who spotted three lights moving in unison in the sky over Park Slope, which sounds a lot like a Williamsburg sighting <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504153901/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/09/video_are_ufos_the_cause_for_the_ge.php">from March</a>, which was also seen the previous <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504153901/http://gothamist.com/2010/01/28/video_do_you_want_to_believe_in_ufo.php">two</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504153901/http://gothamist.com/2009/02/04/mysterious_northern_lights_over_nyc.php">years.</a> </p>

<p>Capp and the phoneline are part of the &quot;NY UFO Meeting Group&quot;&#x2014;on their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504153901/http://ufomedia.blogspot.com/">UFO Media Matters</a> site, they say they advocate for UFO witnesses to be treated &quot;fairly and with respect.&quot; About the hotline, they write: &quot;If you wish to talk someone or have us document your sightings or paranormal activity please call us. All calls are held in [strict] confidence.&quot; The number is: (347)-298-9020. At least one member of the group is happy to find new ways of connecting with fellow UFO enthusiasts, whether they be terrestrials or extraterrestrials: &quot;It&apos;s good to hear shared experiences,&quot; said group member Julio Barriere, who the Post adds, &quot;said he sees UFOs any time the sky is clear.&quot;</p>
