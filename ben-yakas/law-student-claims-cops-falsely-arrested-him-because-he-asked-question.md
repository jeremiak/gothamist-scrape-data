<p>We&apos;ve heard countless stories of cops overstepping their duties to teach law-abiding citizens cruel lessons about what cops can do when you piss them off. Sometimes they throw you in jail because <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150113020212/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/17/cops_arrest_professors_wh.php">you touched their shoulder</a>, because you <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150113020212/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/02/student_arrested_for_36_hours_by_ny.php">forgot to carry ID</a>, because you dared <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150113020212/http://gothamist.com/2013/12/13/freelance_photographer_sues_nypd_fo.php">photograph one in public</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150113020212/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/14/we_just_paid_22k_because_a_cop_arre.php">criticized stop-and-frisk</a>. Law student Tzvi Richt claims in a new lawsuit that he was falsely arrested after asking a cop a few questions. &quot;Who the f-k do you think you are?&quot; officer Graham Braithwaite allegedly asked Richt after arresting him.</p>

<p>Richt, 22, a first-year student at Cardozo School of Law, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150113020212/http://nypost.com/2014/03/28/law-student-calls-out-cops-gets-wrongfully-cuffed-lawsuit/">told the Post that he was headed home</a> in December after taking finals when he spotted officers Braithwaite and Jason Pinero honking at a man to move his car from a bus zone at Kings Highway and East 16th Street. Once the man scurried to leave, the cops pulled into the same spot and headed over to a nearby food truck to eat. </p>

<p>Richt approached them to ask whether they &quot;thought what they had done was right,&#x201D; the suit states. &#x201C;Kicking a civilian&#x2019;s car out of a bus stop so that they could park there just to get food.&#x201D; Richt says he asked in a respectful manner and was not &#x201C;yelling or shouting,&quot; but Braithwaite ignored him. &quot;Plaintiff responded by asking whether he wasn&#x2019;t allowed to ask a question of a police officer,&quot; the suit states. Braithwaite asked Richt for ID, Richt responded by asking whether he had the right to make that request, and boom, he was in handcuffs.</p>

<p>When Richt asked more questions at the station, cops told him &quot;it&#x2019;s none of your f&#x2014;-g business.&quot; He was eventually charged with two disorderly conduct citations, both of which were dropped when Braithwaite didn&apos;t show up in court. Richt now fears that his false arrest will negatively affect his chances of passing the Bar.</p>
