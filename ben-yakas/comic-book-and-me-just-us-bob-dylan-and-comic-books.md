</div></div>					<p>This week, Bob Dylan turned 70-years-old, and we took an extensive look back through his lifelong <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150530210641/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/24/video_talkin_bob_dylan_new_york_bir.php#photo-1">love affair with NYC</a>. But Comic Book Resources decided to honor the former Lucky/Boo Wilbury in a different way: with an unbelievably extensive five-part look at all of Robert Zimmerman&apos;s comic book appearances and references!</p>

<p>It&apos;s really worth looking through all five parts&#x2014;which are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150530210641/http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2011/05/24/70-bob-dylan-comic-book-references-part-1/">here</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150530210641/http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2011/05/24/70-bob-dylan-comic-book-references-part-2/">here</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150530210641/http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2011/05/24/70-bob-dylan-comic-book-references-part-3/">here</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150530210641/http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2011/05/24/70-bob-dylan-comic-book-references-part-4/">here</a>, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150530210641/http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2011/05/24/70-bob-dylan-comic-book-references-part-5/">here</a>. We ran through them and crunched some numbers, and found that &quot;All Along The Watchtower&quot; and &quot;The Times They Are A-Changin&apos;,&quot; with nine references each, are the top most referenced songs for comic book writers to use&#x2014;in particular, Alan Moore&apos;s classic <em>Watchmen</em> has several uses of &quot;Watchtower,&quot; as well as &quot;Desolation Row.&quot; </p>

<p>There are also a lot of bizarre and random occurrences: did you know that Batman once stopped by to listen to Dylan (with Joan Baez by his side) play &quot;Visions of Johanna&quot;? We&apos;re also pretty sure the world has yet to hear Dylan&apos;s lost classic, &quot;Protest Songs For Migrant Garbageman.&quot; There are plenty of humorous appearances: National Lampoon had their &quot;Ventures of Zimmerman&quot;,  along with its sequel, &quot;Son-O-God Meets Zimmerman&quot;&#x2014;although both seem oddly heavy on the Jewish imagery. Mad Magazine especially likes to make fun of him: one comic reads, &quot;<strong>over the course of his career, Bob Dylan has filled his harmonicas with 674 gallons of spit.&quot;</strong></p>

<p>Other songs referenced include: &quot;This Wheel&apos;s on Fire&quot;, &quot;Quinn The Eskimo,&quot; &quot;Simple Twist of Fate,&quot; &quot;Hard Rain&apos;s a-Gonna Fall,&quot; &quot;Like A Rolling Stone,&quot; &quot;Positively 4th Street,&quot; &quot;Knockin&apos; On Heaven&apos;s Door,&quot; &quot;Forever Young,&quot; &quot;Masters of War,&quot; &quot;Gates of Eden,&quot; &quot;I Shall Be Released,&quot; &quot;It Ain&apos;t Me Babe,&quot; &quot;Song For Woody,&quot; &quot;Just Like a Woman,&quot; &quot;Dirge&quot; and &quot;Shelter From The Storm.&quot; How could the writers forget classics such as &quot;Wigwam,&quot; &quot;Wiggle Wiggle&quot; and &quot;If Dogs Run Free&quot;?</p>

<p>You can browse through some of our favorite comic references above. And below, listen to <em>The Basement Tapes</em> classic, &quot;Yea! Heavy And A Bottle Of Bread,&quot; which is all about Dylan and his comic book...catching a trout...with a nose full of pus...we think...</p>
