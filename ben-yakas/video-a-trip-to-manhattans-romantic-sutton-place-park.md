<p>In the American Masters documentary about him last year, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501174841/http://gothamist.com/tags/woodyallen">Woody Allen</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501174841/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/01/woody_allen_thinks_annie_hall_is_ok.php">revealed his true thoughts</a> about <em>Manhattan</em>: he thought he had made a terrible film, that he &quot;had blown it so badly it was unreleasable.&quot; But to most film aficionados and Allen fans, <em>Manhattan</em> has stood the test of time as one of Allen&apos;s warmest, most optimistic and romantic movies. AV Club writer Noel Murray <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501174841/http://www.avclub.com/articles/the-pushpull-of-woody-allens-manhattan,81885/">took a pop pilgrimage to NYC</a> to visit Sutton Place Park by the Queensboro Bridge, the spot of one of the most iconic scenes in the whole of Allen&apos;s oeuvre. </p>

<p>According to Bob Egan, who runs <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501174841/http://popspotsnyc.com/">PopSpotsNYC</a>, it turns out that they really did film at 5 a.m. in the morning. They also had to bring their own bench for Allen and Diane Keaton to sit on by the East River. The other really nice part of the piece: this was Murray&apos;s first trip ever to NYC! He summed it up by explaining how hard it was to sum up: &quot;I&#x2019;ve spent less than 48 hours in New York in my entire life, and it&#x2019;s still hard to capture my impressions from just a day and a half in the city.&quot;</p>
