<p>We live in a strange new world in which the mayor of NYC <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140320191729/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/03/mayor_de_blasio_shovels_his_sidewal.php">shovels his own snow</a> and nationally-syndicated columnists <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140320191729/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/03/david_brooks_smoking_pot.php">out themselves as degenerate drug users</a>. The times they are a-changin&apos;, so maybe we shouldn&apos;t be so surprised that critics&apos; tweets are now being turned into advertising fodder in print publications: NY Times film critic and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140320191729/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/19/ny_times_film_critic_to_great_googa.php">GoogaMooga aficionado</a> A.O. Scott discovered just that this morning when a tweet he made about <em>Inside Llewyn Davis</em> showed up as a full-page print ad on page c7 of today&apos;s Times.</p>

<p>Here&apos;s what Scott, who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140320191729/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/06/movies/inside-llewyn-davis-directed-by-joel-and-ethan-coen.html?_r=0">adored the acclaimed movie</a>, originally tweeted:</p>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>You all keep fighting about Wolf of Wall St. and Am Hustle. I&apos;m gonna listen to the Llewyn Davis album again. Fare thee well, my honeys.</p>&#x2014; a. o. scott (@aoscott) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140320191729/https://twitter.com/aoscott/statuses/417821156729581568">December 31, 2013</a></blockquote>

<p>You might be wondering why CBS Films, which released the film, would choose a tweet about the soundtrack rather than one about the movie itself (which Scott has given plenty of praise in other tweets). A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140320191729/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/04/movies/awardsseason/hoping-that-llewyn-davis-sounds-like-a-best-picture.html?ref=movies">story in the Times</a> this weekend points to the logic behind the ad campaign: the promoters &quot;have gone to extraordinary lengths in using the folk music at the movie&#x2019;s center to attract audiences, woo Oscar voters and sell its soundtrack album.&quot;</p>

<p>So while you debate whether a blurbed tweet <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140320191729/https://twitter.com/tyburr/status/419488121277804544">is a bleat or a twerb</a>, let&apos;s all contemplate the possibilities for future tweet-based advertising:</p>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>hmm <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140320191729/https://twitter.com/jenchung">@jenchung</a> since I was priced out of that neighborhood a decade ago I doubt they&apos;ll use anything. Unless they use exactly that...</p>&#x2014; a. o. scott (@aoscott) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140320191729/https://twitter.com/aoscott/statuses/419483968925204480">January 4, 2014</a></blockquote>
