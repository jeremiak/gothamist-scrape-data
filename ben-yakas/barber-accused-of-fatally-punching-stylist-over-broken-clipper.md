<p>A fistfight between a barber and a stylist on Staten Island ended in tragedy when one man <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130729111255/http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2013/05/man_dies_of_injuries_from_stat.html#incart_river">died from his injuries</a>. Barber Timothy Evans, 31, is accused of punching co-worker Michael Alao, 22, on April 30th at Forever Fridays barbershop. The fight reportedly started because Evans was angry over a broken clipper, and blamed Alao. &#x201C;He was upset and an argument ensued,&#x201D; regular John Dunkley <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130729111255/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/staten_island/shear_madness_Ikq3pLNm9oGHvCBOh2DMMP?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Staten%20Island">told the Post</a>. &#x201C;It was a fistfight gone very wrong.&#x201D;</p>

<p>In a statement to police, Evans said the argument started the day before the fistfight: &quot;Mike proceeds to come off rudely, and words are spoken.&quot; Evans said he tried to stop the argument, but Alao kept it going: &quot;I ended up walking out to leave out the shop to get away from everybody. As I leave, Mike comes after me in fight mode. I proceeded to defend myself. I didn&apos;t mean for things to go for [a] wrong turn as it did and I&apos;m deeply apologetic and remorseful,&quot; Evans said. Evans hit Alao in the head, and suffered a fatal fracture to his skull in the fall. He died six days later of &#x201C;blunt trauma&#x201D; at Richmond University Medical Center.</p>

<p>Alao&#x2019;s mother, Pamela, and girlfriend, Pamelo Johnson, said the fight was all over a misunderstanding; they claim that a couple of kids had accidentally dropped and broken the clippers. &#x201C;[Evans] was blaming Michael because they broke. So the next day he hid Michael&#x2019;s clippers And wouldn&#x2019;t give them back. [Evans] was telling Michael, &#x2018;You have to pay for the clippers.&#x2019; That&#x2019;s when they got into the scuffle out back behind the barbershop,&#x2019; &#x201D; Johnson told the Post.</p>

<p>Evans, a convicted drug dealer who had finished parole in March after being released from prison in April 2012, was reportedly good friends with Alao, and once had helped Alao during a fight. Evans has been charged with third-degree assault, a misdemeanor, though officials say the investigation is still open. Barber shop&#x2019;s owner says the whole thing was an accident: &#x201C;They worked side-by-side...I gave the police the video [surveillance]. You can see he slipped and fell,&#x201D; said owner John Brumble.</p>
