<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406143500/http://gothamist.com/tags/rexryan">Rex Ryan</a> is a passionate man with varied tastes: he appreciates snack time, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406143500/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/05/photo_rex_ryan_stranded_at_jfk_airp.php">orange sweatshirts</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406143500/http://gothamist.com/tags/prettyfeet">pretty feet</a>, the art of football, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406143500/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/09/photos_video_rex_ryan_runs_with_the.php#photo-1">running with the bulls</a>, and as we&apos;ve now learned, hanging out at Hooters. </p>

<p>As <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406143500/http://deadspin.com/rex-and-rob-ryan-hit-up-hooters-because-of-course-they-1527783421">Deadspin pointed out</a>, Ryan and his twin brother Rob &quot;Wolfman&quot; Ryan visited an Indianapolis Hooters for a photo op while in town for the NFL Combine this week. Of course, there&apos;s only one thing Ryan loves more than fried chicken wings and scantily-clad waitresses: forgotten Jets QB <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406143500/http://gothamist.com/tags/marksanchez">Mark Sanchez</a>. </p>

<p>Despite a disastrous 2012 season (never forget the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406143500/http://gothamist.com/tags/buttfumble">buttfumble</a>) and sitting out the 2013 season with an injury, Ryan still believes Sanchez can be the Jets QB next season: &quot;I always want guys back,&quot; he said <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406143500/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2014/02/21/does-rex-ryan-want-mark-sanchez-back-on-jets-absolutely/">at the NFL Combine</a>. &quot;[Would] I want him back? Absolutely. Would I want all my guys back? You guys know my answer. You know how I feel about my players. That&#x2019;s just the way it is.&quot;</p>

<p>If Sanchez is on the roster this season, he&apos;ll be due a $2 million bonus in March and brings a $13.1 million cap charge. On the plus side, he is throwing with &#x201C;good velocity&#x201D; in Southern California four months after surgery for his throwing arm, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406143500/http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/football/jets/source-jets-sanchez-throwing-good-velocity-rehab-article-1.1625745">according to the News.</a> On the down side, oh, let&apos;s just revisit the play below:</p>

<p>&quot;When people bleed for you, it&#x2019;s hard not to be loyal to those players,&quot; Ryan added. And when you <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406143500/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/04/rex_ryan_has_a_sexy_bicep_tattoo_of.php">bleed ink for people</a>, it&apos;s probably hard to be objective as well.</p>
