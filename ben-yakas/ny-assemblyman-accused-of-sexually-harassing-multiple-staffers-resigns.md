Gabryszak wrote in his resignation letter that there was &quot;never any intent on my part to sexually harass any member of my staff,&quot; but admitted that there &quot;was mutual banter and exchanges that took place that should not have taken place because it is inappropriate in the workplace.&quot; You can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509134144/http://www.buffalonews.com/city-region/albany-politics/text-of-dennis-gabryszaks-resignation-letter-20140112">read the whole letter here.</a><p></p>

<p>Over the last month, the 62-year-old Gabryszak has been sued by multiple former female staffers who say he continually harassed them. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509134144/http://gothamist.com/2013/12/21/assemblyman_dennis_gabryszak.php">Some of the women claim</a> he sent them a video of himself receiving oral sex, joking he had a tattoo on his genitalia, and telling one employee he &quot;got a boner&quot; when he saw her in the office. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509134144/http://gothamist.com/2013/12/26/fourth_female_staffer_files_sexual.php">Another claims</a> he repeatedly sexually harassed her, creating a &quot;hostile and offensive work environment.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509134144/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/04/two_more_female_staffers_file_sexua.php">And yet another claims</a> he tried to kiss her in his apartment before threatening to fire her.</p>

<p>After the initial allegations came out, Gov. Cuomo said Gabryszak should resign if any of it were true. The governor gave this statement today:</p>

<blockquote>Following the latest reports of horrific behavior in the Assembly against Assemblymember Gabryszak, I asked him to either deny the allegations or resign immediately. Today, he has given us his answer. Our representatives in elected office can and should be held to a higher standard -- especially at a time when the Legislature&apos;s ethics are being questioned and the confidence of their constituents being undermined. This kind of alleged behavior has no place in New York State government or any other office in society. My thoughts are with the alleged victims and Mr. Gabrysak&apos;s family during this difficult time.</blockquote>

<p>The resignation comes a day before members of the Assembly are set to begin their first full day of the 2014 legislative session. Cuomo hasn&apos;t said when (or if) he will call a special election to fill the seat.</p>
