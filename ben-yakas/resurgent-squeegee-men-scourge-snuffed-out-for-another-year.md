<p>This week, the NY Post <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150724041335/http://nypost.com/2014/08/07/squeegee-men-are-back-and-terrorizing-city-streets/">cast its terrible gaze</a> upon the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150724041335/http://nypost.com/2014/08/08/bratton-vows-to-crack-down-on-squeegee-men/">very important scourge</a> of squeegee men, who they treat like the tsetse flies on the &quot;broken windows&quot; of NYC. They plastered the face of squeegee king Gregg Washington <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150724041335/http://gothamist.com/2014/08/08/squeegee_men.php">on their cover</a> with the completely hysterical headline, &quot;Squeegee men are back terrorizing NYC streets,&quot; because what strikes terror into the hearts of New Yorkers like having a confrontation with a stranger? Anyway, at best, the Post <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150724041335/http://nypost.com/2014/08/10/homeless-man-racks-up-178th-squeegee-bust/">successfully strong-armed</a> the police into arresting Washington, as they gleefully announced today, so MISSION ACCOMPLISHED. </p>

<p>Washington, 40, was plying his trade on 42nd Street and 9th Avenue when he was arrested around 10:30 a.m. on Saturday. For Washington, who has been squeegeeing since before you were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150724041335/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8KRaSXd4oA">a squee</a> in your parent&apos;s eyes, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150724041335/http://nypost.com/2014/08/10/homeless-man-racks-up-178th-squeegee-bust/">this was his</a> 178th arrest for washing motorists&#x2019; windshields and his 225th arrest overall. </p>

<p>Note: way down in the ninth paragraph of the story, we learn that &quot;Washington&#x2019;s 225 arrests include marijuana possession, but no violent or serious offenses.&quot;</p>

<p>So good job NY Post! You&apos;ve vanquished squeegeeing and made the slow entranceways to major bridges and tunnels once again safe for drivers. Washington certainly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150724041335/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/12/squeegee_king_busted_for_186th_time.php">won&apos;t be back on the streets</a> squeegeeing again&#x2014;it&apos;s one thing to be arrested 178 times for the same reason, but 179 would just be silly&#x2014;and we certainly won&apos;t be talking about the terrorism of squeegee men ever again, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150724041335/http://gothamist.com/2008/09/15/squeegee_men_not_wiped_out_entirely.php">unlike all</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150724041335/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/20/bloomberg_vows_to_protect_city_from.php">those other</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150724041335/http://gothamist.com/2014/08/08/squeegee_men.php">times.</a> </p>
