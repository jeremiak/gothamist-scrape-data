<p>Rumors have been flying around Twitter today that Jay-Z would be playing a surprise &quot;secret show&quot; in the heart of Bushwick this afternoon. Various outlets <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406145859/http://globalgrind.com/2013/08/24/jay-z-planning-secret-show-brooklyn-bushwick-vmas-details/">tweeted and reported</a> that Jay-Z would perform before the VMA&apos;s at 421 Troutman Street along with Justin Timberlake and Beyonce, which sounded pretty far-fetched to us, but who knows, Jay-Z is into weird stuff these days. It&apos;s been a couple hours, and Revolt TV <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406145859/https://twitter.com/RevoltTV/statuses/371336567765614592">has retracted their initial announcement</a>, but hundreds of people have been crowded there just in case. </p>

<p>If anything changes and Jay-Z does materialize, we&apos;ll update and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406145859/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGcWTIWYDMQ">eat our shoe</a>. But until then, watch as anticipation curdles into despair and disappointment in the photos and tweets below.</p>
