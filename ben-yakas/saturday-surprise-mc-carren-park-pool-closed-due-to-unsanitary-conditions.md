<p>The more things change, the more they poop the same: according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429120518/https://twitter.com/Just_Dom/status/231793304998658048">various</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429120518/https://twitter.com/DBTH/status/231792698661691393">Tweeters</a>, the newly renovated fight club/public toilet <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429120518/http://gothamist.com/tags/mccarrenparkpool">McCarren Park Pool</a> has been closed due to &quot;unsanitary conditions.&quot; Chris Hollenbeck <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429120518/https://twitter.com/CRHollenbeck/status/231793228742004736">tweeted</a>, &quot;A loudspeaker echoes omnipresent over #McCarren, &apos;Attention: Due to unsanitary conditions the pool is now closed. Please exit the pool bed.&apos;&quot; Maybe it was just a Baby Ruth?</p>

<p>In case you&apos;ve forgotten, McCarren Park Pool <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429120518/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/09/mccarren_park_pool_evacuated_after.php">had a previous incident</a> with fecal matter (dubbed Poopgate) last month&#x2014;cops <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429120518/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/10/mccarren_pool_poopgate_brooklyn_cop.php">vehemently denied</a> any pooping had occurred, but a lifeguard later <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429120518/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/15/mccarren_park_pool_lifeguard.php">confirmed the story to the Post.</a> They also gave the lowdown on park procedure for such &quot;unsanitary conditions:&quot; &quot;We cleared out the pool and made everyone stand on the sides. <strong>The rule is five minutes for poop and 25 minutes for throw-up.</strong> Luckily, there were two new lifeguards, so we made them clean it up.&quot;</p>

<p>Maybe we all should be following Kris Chu: he&apos;s the Cassandra who foretold of this development a few hours ago with a very timely tweet:</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> McCarren Park Pool remained closed for the rest of the day Saturday, but workers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429120518/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20120804/greenpoint/mccarren-pool-abruptly-closes-saturday">told DNAInfo</a> that they&apos;d be re-open on Sunday&#x2014;at least, you know, until the next incident.</p>
