<p>A little over a week ago, a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130807021843/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/22/times_square_weed_man_arrested_afte.php">fight broke out between two Times Square mainstays</a>, and for once, it had nothing to do with marauding gangs of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130807021843/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/08/cookie_monster_arrested_for_shoving.php">copyrighted characters.</a> Dwight Laird, who goes by the moniker &quot;Weed Head,&quot; was arrested for stabbing Wayne Semancik, known as &quot;Beer Man,&quot; five times with a pen. And Laird says he&apos;s unapologetic over it: &quot;He deserves what he got,&quot; Laird, 30, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130807021843/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/weed_head_defends_pot_shot_ZMAn1uxm8dLsLGjp06jQSL">told the Post</a>. &quot;I&apos;m not proud of what I did, but I&#x2019;m not apologizing.&quot;</p>

<p>The fight broke out over a panhandling turf dispute around 10:15 p.m. at 42nd Street near 7th Avenue on June 21st. &#x201C;Near 42nd Street and Seventh Avenue, he said, &#x2018;Get off my block!&#x2019; &#x201D; Laird, who is also known as the Weed Man in a Box, told the Post. &#x201C;He told me he had a knife. I turned away, and for whatever reason, he hit me.&#x201D; </p>

<p>According to Semancik, Laird spit in his face: &quot;When you spit in my face, darling, I&apos;m going to hit you. I don&apos;t care who you are, how big you are, I&apos;m going to hit you,&quot; Semancik <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130807021843/http://www.ny1.com/content/top_stories/184298/man-arrested-after-argument-between-panhandlers-leads-to-alleged-assault-in-times-square">told NY1</a>. &quot;So the man, he pulled out a pen because I was hitting him, and he started stabbing me in the face, and I have five stab wounds in my face right now.&quot;</p>

<p>Laird was charged with second-degree assault in the incident; his next court date is in October. The most indelible image captured during the dispute was that of cops talking to eyewitnesses Alien and Predator. We thought it was remarkable that they had learned to work together, but according to Semancik, they&apos;ve always been cooperative with one another: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130807021843/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/26/nyregion/in-times-square-a-clash-of-panhandlers.html">he told the Times</a> those two are brothers from North Carolina who regularly work together.</p>
