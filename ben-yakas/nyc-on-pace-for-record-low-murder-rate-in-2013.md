                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="11313cops.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20140221071403im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/11313cops.jpg" width="640" height="445"> <br> <i> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140221071403/http://www.flickr.com/photos/kenstein/10177468864/">runs with scissors&apos; flickr</a></i></div> <p></p>

<p>According to the latest <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140221071403/http://nypost.com/2013/11/02/nyc-on-track-to-be-nations-safest-city/">NYPD crime statistics</a>, NYC is currently on pace in 2013 to have the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140221071403/http://gothamist.com/tags/murderrate">lowest number of homicides</a> in over 60 years. There have been 279 homicides in the city through the end of October, down 23% compared from 364 murders up to this point in 2012. If current trends hold, we will have around 100 fewer deaths this year than last year&#x2014;and that would mean an average of fewer than <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140221071403/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/29/city_has_seen_fewer_than_one_murder.php">one murder a day</a>.</p>

<p>Altogether, NYC had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140221071403/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/28/nyc_hits_record_low_murder_rate_in.php">419 murders in 2012</a>, which was the lowest number of murders since the NYPD started keeping track of these statistics in 1963. For some more perspective, NYC has a rate of 2.9 murders per 100,000 people, which, if you&apos;re looking at murder alone, makes it one of the top five safest big cities in America with a population over 250K; Detroit has the most with 54 per 100K, Baltimore and Newark each have 34 per 100K, Chicago has 18.5 and LA has 7.8. </p>

<p>However, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140221071403/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/14/fbi-crime-stats-mixed-for_n_3439629.html">if you take all violent crimes into account</a>&#x2014;such as rape, robbery, and felonious assault&#x2014;New York&apos;s success is mixed. Robberies increased in the city by 2% last year, a fact that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140221071403/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/28/crime-is-up-and-bloomberg-blames-iphone-thieves/">Mayor Bloomberg blamed on the theft of Apple devices.</a> </p>

<p>As for the intrinsic question of <em>why</em> the murder rate has been steadily going down over the last couple years&#x2014;and remaining low&#x2014;Police Commissioner Ray Kelly credits the NYPD&#x2019;s focus on youth gangs and domestic violence, along with &quot;hot-spot policing&quot; and an expanding use of electronic data to identify crime trends. In 2012, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140221071403/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/15/nypd_solved_57_of_murders_last_year.php">police cleared</a> 74.8% of the city&apos;s homicides; not counting cold cases, the NYPD solved 57% of the year&apos;s 419 homicides.</p>

<p>What&apos;s the elephant in the room? As of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140221071403/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/28/murder_rate_1.php">August this year</a>, the NYPD conducted 53 percent fewer street stop-and-frisks&#x2014;58,088, to be exact&#x2014; than it did in the same period last year. </p>
