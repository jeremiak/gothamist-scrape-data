<p>At the beginning of 2013, British comedians Sanderson Jones and Pippa Evans started <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424160422/http://sundayassembly.com/">The Sunday Assembly</a>&#x2014;essentially, the group is a way for atheists to enjoy the community and activity associated with religion, but without any talk of God. They host lectures from authors, scientists and humorists, there are live band singalongs, and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424160422/http://www.tntmagazine.com/london/arts-and-culture/comedian-sanderson-jones-opens-londons-first-atheist-church">group&apos;s guiding principle is</a> to &quot;live better, help often and wonder more.&quot; Now, the group is coming to America to test the waters here&#x2014;starting in Hell&apos;s Kitchen.</p>

<p>The group, which has a regular following of about 600 people in London, will wash ashore at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424160422/http://tobaccoroadnycofficial.com/">&quot;bikini bar&quot; Tobacco Road</a> in Manhattan for the their first U.S. gathering on June 30th at 12:30 p.m. With the help of Bronx resident and documentarian Michael Dorian, they&apos;re trying to get a band to play songs by David Bowie, the Beatles and the Rolling Stones. The bar has also agreed to have bartenders cover up the parts that <strike>God</strike> random collisions of particles in space gave them to create a more family-friendly atmosphere for the occasion. </p>

<p>After NYC, the group is planning to hit Los Angeles, the Silicon Valley area, San Francisco, Seattle, and Chicago. &quot;Lots of people are giving us warnings that it&apos;s going to be different over there, but so far, we&apos;ve just had a lot of support from the people in America,&quot; Jones told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424160422/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/british-atheist-group-host-sermon-city-dive-bar-article-1.1373821">the Daily News.</a> They should be just fine, as long as they don&apos;t bring up <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424160422/http://gothamist.com/tags/atheists">9/11 crosses.</a></p>
