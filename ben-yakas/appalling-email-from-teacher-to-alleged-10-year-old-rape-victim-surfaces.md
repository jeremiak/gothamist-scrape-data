<p>On Wednesday, a 40-year-old Special Education Bronx teacher <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130927200336/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/19/bronx_teacher_arrested_for_allegedl.php">was arrested and accused of raping</a> a 10-year-old student. Anthony Criscuolo, who taught at PS 386, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130927200336/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/20/family_of_10-year-old_allegedly_rap.php">has been charged with</a> first-degree rape and predatory sexual assault against a child. The alleged rape came to light after the young girl&apos;s mother <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130927200336/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/bronx/bronx-teacher-busted-raping-student-10-email-rough-article-1.1377916?localLinksEnabled=false">found sexually explicit emails</a> Criscuolo sent the girl the day after he allegedly raped her in the back of a car: &#x201C;I was too rough. Sorry. It&#x2019;s normal,&#x201D; he wrote to the fifth grader. &#x201C;You may feel pain for a few days.&#x201D; He also asked, &#x201C;How did it feel for you?&#x201D;</p>

<p>The girl told detectives that Criscuolo had informed her she was going to receive an award on Monday&#x2014;he allegedly forged a letter about the award on school letterhead to give to her mother. The girl&apos;s parents allowed him to take her to the award ceremony; but he instead took her to a parking lot and allegedly raped her in his car.</p>

<p>According <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130927200336/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/bronx/vile_mail_to_kid_qG8FtSkx48v742JzjEsVPN">to court papers</a>, Criscuolo&apos;s sexual assaults on the girl began in April, and at least one of them happened in a building on East 181st Street. &#x201C;I like you,&#x201D; he was quoted as telling the girl at one time. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m doing this because I like you. I don&#x2019;t want you to feel uncomfortable. If you feel uncomfortable, tell me to stop.&#x201D;</p>

<p>School Chancellor Dennis Walcott said officials were moving to fire Criscuolo from his $73K-a-year job, though he remains a city employee for now. &#x201C;He will not be teaching for us again,&#x201D; Walcott said sternly. &#x201C;We&#x2019;re not going to tolerate this. This is unacceptable. He will not go back to teach at all.&#x201D;<br>
