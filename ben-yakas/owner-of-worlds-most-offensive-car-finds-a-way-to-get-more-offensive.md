You know that phenomenon where a person sees their picture in the paper, hates it, and decides they need to lose 15 pounds immediately? Well, Fried had his own version of that: he looked at the photo of his offensive bumper, and decided he could use a few more. So he&apos;s unveiled his latest piece of intolerant poetry: <strong>&quot;Boston MASSacre: G-d&apos;s response to America&apos;s 1st gay marriage state.&quot;</strong></p>

<p>Not everyone was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428175512/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/21/bumper_stickers.php">as charmed</a> by Fried and his logic-based homophobia as we were it seems&#x2014;one of his neighbors, presumably a Jewish person, left a note on his windshield giving him a strong piece of their mind. </p>

<blockquote>To the owner of this car:

<p>And you wonder why the rest of the world hates us?!?!</p>

<p>You are one of the worst people to ever come into existence, and you make the rest of us look bad. I hope you burn in hell you pathetic excuse of a human being.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>Whoa whoa whoa, hold up their feller&#x2014;there&apos;s no need to group Fried in with other Jewish people. We have a feeling he&apos;d be much more comfortable being grouped together with likeminded individuals such as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428175512/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/26/kirk-cameron-anti-gay-advocate-rejects-gay-youth_n_1707570.html">Kirk Cameron</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428175512/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/03/07/celebrity-homophobic-rants-mel-gibson-victoria-jackson_n_1326557.html">Mel Gibson</a>, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428175512/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/russia-the-country-that-hates-gay-people-8616223.html">Russia.</a></p>
