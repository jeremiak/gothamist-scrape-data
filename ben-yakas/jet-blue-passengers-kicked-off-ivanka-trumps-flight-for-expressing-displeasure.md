title: JetBlue Passengers Kicked Off Ivanka Trump's Flight For 'Expressing Displeasure'
---

	
										<p>A couple was reportedly kicked off a JetBlue flight before it left JFK this morning after they allegedly harassed Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner. You can see three now-deleted tweets about the incident from Matthew Lasner, a Hunter College professor, below.</p>

<p>In the initial tweet, sent out around 9:15 a.m. Thursday, he wrote, &quot;Ivanka and Jared at JFK T5, flying commercial. My husband chasing them down to harass them. #banalityofevil.&quot; Then about an hour later, Lasner wrote, &quot;Ivanka and Jared on our flight. My husband expressed displeasure in a calm tone, JetBlue staff overheard, and they kicked us off the plane.&quot; In a final tweet, about 20 minutes after that, he tweeted the photo of Ivanka with the caption, &quot;Ivanka just before @JetBlue kicked us off our flight when a flt attendant overhead my husband expressing displeasure about flying w/ Trumps.&quot; </p>

<p>The Daily Mail <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171102013335/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4059082/Ivanka-Trump-aggressively-confronted-man-JetBlue-sitting-children-screams-father-ruining-country-asks-flight.html">has now identified</a> Lasner&apos;s husband as Dan Goldstein, a lawyer from Brooklyn. TMZ has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171102013335/http://www.tmz.com/2016/12/22/ivanka-trump-flight/">a few more details</a> about the incident, though they do not cite any particular source: </p>

<blockquote>Ivanka was on a JetBlue flight leaving JFK Thursday morning with her family when a passenger started screaming, &quot;Your father is ruining the country.&quot; The guy went on, &quot;Why is she on our flight. She should be flying private.&quot; The guy had his kid in his arms as he went on the tirade.

<p>A passenger on the flight tells TMZ Ivanka ignored the guy and tried distracting her kids with crayons.  </p>

<p>JetBlue personnel escorted the unruly passenger off the flight. As he was removed he screamed, &quot;You&apos;re kicking me off for expressing my opinion?!!&quot;</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>The flight departed for San Francisco without reports of further incident. JetBlue said in a statement, &quot;The decision to remove a customer from a flight is not taken lightly. If the crew determines that a customer is causing conflict on the aircraft, the customer will be asked to deplane, especially if the crew feels the situation runs the risk of escalation during flight. In this instance, our team worked to re-accommodate the party on the next available flight.&quot;</p>

<p>The most surprising thing about the incident, besides the fact that Ivanka&apos;s father is going to be our next fucking president, may be that Trump and Kushner were flying coach.</p>
