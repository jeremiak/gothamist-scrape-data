Member Julio Chavez is charged with killing Maurice Parker on May 18, 2007, in Flushing&#x2014;and all because of a misunderstanding. Chavez <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151015001356/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2011/03/04/2011-03-04_he_had_just_given_a_soul_to_the_devil_witness_recalls_slay_susps_rant.html">mistook Parker</a> for a member of the rival Bloods gang, because he was wearing a red sweatshirt. According to accomplice and former MS-13 gang member Jose Molina, Chavez went on a long rant in Spanish after the murder, saying amongst other things: &quot;<strong>Yeah, homie, that&apos;s how you&apos;re supposed to do it. You see the blood coming out of his head?...The beast has eaten!&quot;</strong><p></p>

<p>Federal prosecutors unsealed a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151015001356/http://www.fbi.gov/newyork/press-releases/2011/25-members-of-the-ms-13-street-gang-indicted-on-federal-racketeering-charges">70-count indictment</a> charging 25 members of the gang with federal rackateering charges, including murder, assault with dangerous weapons, witness tampering and retaliation, extortion, narcotics trafficking. They also announced yesterday that they will seek the death penalty against MS-13 gang member Rene Mejia, who allegedly helped execute a Long Island mother and her 2-year-old son last year.</p>
