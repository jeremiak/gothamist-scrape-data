<p>Topless activist <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503231456/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/18/east_village_topless_woman_gets_sup.php">Moira Johnston</a> has become <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503231456/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/20/video_a_nsfw_interview_with_the_eas.php">a familiar face</a> around the East Village (and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503231456/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/01/nsfw_photo_topless_lady_spotted_on.php">the subways too!</a>) thanks to her very public displays of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503231456/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/12/was_mysterious_topless_bowery_woman.php">NY State law.</a> As if to further cement her celebrity status, Lindsay Lohan&apos;s dad <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503231456/https://twitter.com/mikelohan/status/223127782669029377">tweeted a NSFW picture</a> of her shocking a UPS delivery guy in lower Manhattan this week&#x2014;and his far less famous daughter <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503231456/https://twitter.com/lindsaylohan">re-tweeted it too.</a> </p>

<p>Hmm, getting associated with the Lohans might not best thing for a topless activist&#x2014;they already have a high rate of being unjustly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503231456/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/08/topless_activist_taken_for_mental_e.php">taken to hospitals for mental evaluations</a> with doctors who have never heard of the law. On the other hand, maybe this could be a good influence on Lindsay&#x2014;she&apos;s really been hanging out with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503231456/http://laist.com/2012/07/13/lilo_gaga_lana_slumber_party.php">some sketchy types lately.</a></p>
