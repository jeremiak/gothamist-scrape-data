<p>We&apos;ve all been there before: even after you&apos;ve lifted a few weights and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508080804/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/12/videos_dont_forget_to_work_out_when.php">perfectly-executed some rave moves</a>, you still haven&apos;t gotten the dance out of your system. Sometimes you just gotta keep on groovin&apos; as you go about your day&#x2014;so we totally get the man in the video below, who was spotted throwing out some <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508080804/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xi4O1yi6b0">Elaine Benes-worthy moves</a> on the 4 train on Friday morning.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508080804/https://www.youtube.com/user/MrBrown123">Gian Franco Morini</a> told us that his girlfriend, Natasha Catherine Robinson, was on her way to work on the 4 train at Bowling Green around 9:15 a.m. yesterday (when the subways were eerily half-empty due to Easter and Passover) when she ran into the &quot;beefy stripper guy&quot; really <em>feeling</em> it. &quot;She said that people was pretending that he was invisible: the best NY reaction to weird people in order to [not] get killed and live a long life,&quot; Morini added.</p>

<p>The man is lucky that he stuck to dance moves that kept him away from the subway pole, as cops haven&apos;t been to kind toward <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508080804/http://gothamist.com/tags/subwaydancing">&apos;It&apos;s Showtime!&apos; breakdancers lately</a>...or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508080804/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/20/city_pays_75k_to_couple_arrested_fo.php">Charleston-dancing,</a> come to think of it. It&apos;s generally safest to leave self-expression <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508080804/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/03/everybody_dance_now_videos_of_peopl.php">to the platforms</a>, lest you get <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508080804/http://gothamist.com/2014/04/19/watch_straphangers_react_to_a_squea.php">side-eye for miles.</a></p>
