<p>&quot;The last 24 hours in politics have been truly mind-boggling. You&apos;ve got the president doubling down on his false wiretapping claim, Republicans scrambling to cobble together a healthcare bill before anyone even knows what&apos;s in it, and new reports that Trump associates may have coordinated with Russia,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170326170304/http://gothamist.com/tags/sethmeyers">Seth Meyers</a> said last night as he set the stage for his latest installment of &quot;A Closer Look.&quot; &quot;If you feel overwhelmed by the constant drumbeat of scandal with this administration, you&apos;re not alone: just check out Senator John McCain&apos;s face...congratulations Senator. You may not know what an emoji is, but you just became one.&quot; </p>

<p>The bulk of the segment was dedicated to the Republicans&apos; struggle to ram Trumpcare (or is it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170326170304/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/23/us/politics/trump-health-care-bill-regrets.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=first-column-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news">Ryancare</a>?) down the nation&apos;s throat, and the many last-minute changes to the bill made to appease hard-line conservatives. &quot;So, Republicans are radically reshaping one-fifth of the economy in a matter of hours, behind closed doors, with no public input,&#x201D; Meyers said. &#x201C;That is insane, cruel and reckless.&quot;</p>

<p>And in another segment, Meyers chided Trump for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170326170304/http://gothamist.com/2017/03/23/sick_burn.php">inadvertently quoting an SNL bit</a> in his Time Magazine interview yesterday: &quot;I didn&#x2019;t mind when you talked dirty with Billy Bush, or told Russia to hack Hillary&#x2019;s emails. But when you start stealing bits from &#x2018;Weekend Update&#x2019; anchors, it is on!&quot; He added: &quot;You know I hate to say this, but, &apos;Donald, you ignorant slut!&apos;&quot;</p>
