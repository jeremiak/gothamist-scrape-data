<p>We don&apos;t often see the classic <em>Twin Peaks</em> phrase &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160510130747/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cymp70Jn1UE">wrapped in plastic</a>&quot; taken so literally&#x2014;but a Redditor <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160510130747/http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/1c4jie/an_orthodox_jew_in_an_airplane_with_women_so_he">posted the above photo</a> of an Orthodox Jewish man who did just that on a recent flight. Poster &quot;FinalSay&quot; initially assumed the man was covering up because he was in front of women, but others pointed out that it is much more likely that the man is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160510130747/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kohen">a &quot;Kohen&quot;,</a> who are holy priests (or descended from them). </p>

<p>Kohens <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160510130747/http://judaism.about.com/od/jewishbeliefsandlaws/f/kohen_dead.htm">are prohibited</a> from flying over cemeteries (&quot;A kohen initially was not supposed to approach any dead body, and if he did so he became ritually impure&quot;), which as you can imagine, could be a major problem for travel. According <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160510130747/http://www.haaretz.com/news/ultra-orthodox-passengers-riot-aboard-el-al-plane-over-screening-of-film-1.243447">to Haaretz</a>, Rabbi Yosef Shalom Eliashiv, the leader of the Lithuanian Haredi community in Israel, &quot;found a solution to this issue, ruling that wrapping oneself in thick plastic bags while the plane crossed over the cemetery is permissible.&quot;</p>
