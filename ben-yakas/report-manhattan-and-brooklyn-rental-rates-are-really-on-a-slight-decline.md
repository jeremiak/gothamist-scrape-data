<p>Things are already <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130219065707/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/12/5_charts_show_just_how_bad_nycs_mid.php">tough out there for the middle class</a> and don&apos;t seem to be getting much better&#x2014;but at least there&apos;s the (prospect of) good news on the horizon. According to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130219065707/http://www.elliman.com/reports-and-guides/reports/new-york-city/january-2013-manhattan-and-brooklyn-rentals/2-405">latest market report</a> by Douglas Elliman [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130219065707/http://www.elliman.com/pdf/ee9140b7b493eaae44ed15375427419e583574f3">PDF</a>], Manhattan and Brooklyn <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130219065707/http://gothamist.com/tags/rent">rental rates</a> are on a decline, thanks in part to buyers. Oh sure, this is probably the equivalent of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130219065707/http://arresteddevelopment.wikia.com/wiki/Development_Arrested">a <em>Mad Money</em> &quot;Don&apos;t Buy&quot;-to-&quot;Risky&quot; upgrade</a>, but it&apos;s still worth breaking out a &quot;Renters Love Buyers&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130219065707/http://thebluthcompany.tumblr.com/post/27382461973/banners-in-arrested-development">banner</a>, don&apos;t you think?</p>

<p>According to the latest data, the average price of a Manhattan rental apartment was down for the fifth consecutive month to $3,211, $23 less than in December. Median rental prices were only up 2.6% over the last month after a 12-month stretch of 7.5% average annual increases. The median rental price in Brooklyn was down over 4% from last month to $2,527 as well. &quot;It looks like we are running out of gas, in terms of growth,&quot; Jonathan Miller, CEO of appraisal firm Miller Samuel (which compiles the reports for Douglas Elliman) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130219065707/http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/real-estate/rent-relief-manhattan-brooklyn-red-hot-rental-markets-cooling-article-1.1262306">summarized to the News</a>. &quot;The march upward wasn&apos;t sustainable.&quot;</p>

<p>The last time <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130219065707/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/12/report_brooklyn_rents_giving_manhat.php">we checked in</a>, it appeared as though Brooklyn rents had finally climbed up into the same ridiculous hemisphere as Manhattan rents. But breaking down the new numbers a bit more: Brooklyn studio apartments had a big increase in average rental prices in the last month, up 18% from $1,825 to $2,125&#x2014;but that&apos;s still lower than a year ago, when it was $2,369. Median rental prices for Brooklyn studios are $1,795, over a 5% decrease from a year ago. Overall, the number of new studio, one-bedroom, and two-bedroom apartments in Brooklyn are up a lot as well. </p>
