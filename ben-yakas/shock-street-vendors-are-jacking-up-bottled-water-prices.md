<p>In NYC, we&apos;re lucky to have some of the greatest tap water in the entire world&#x2014;Sulfate, Radio-Nuclides, Trihalomethanes, N-Nitrosodimethylamine, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150602010035/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/05/what_else_is_in_your_tap_water_besi.php">and all the rest included.</a> Even our milky water is delicious! We <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150602010035/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/05/nyc_water_board_approves_rate_incre.php">pay a little extra</a> for that quality. And yet, some people insist on buying bottled water from sidewalk stands and food markets&#x2014;and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150602010035/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/three_bucks_bottle_that_water_torture_qqAoEuynHQGfZugDhnEp3N?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Local">according to the Post</a>, sellers have been jacking up the prices to $3 a bottle this summer.</p>

<p>&#x201C;As soon as I paid for it, I knew I just got taken for a ride,&#x201D; tourist Ben Pastor, visiting from Toronto, told them. &#x201C;But I was thirsty&#x2014;what was I going to do?&#x201D; One Sixth Avenue hotdog vendor confessed that he jacked up the price of water by 50 cents a bottle, adding that he&#x2019;ll likely cut the price when cooler weather arrives. &#x201C;That&#x2019;s how we do it,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;But don&#x2019;t blame me. I&#x2019;m just the worker. It&#x2019;s the cart owner who sets the prices.&#x201D; Wait, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150602010035/http://gothamist.com/tags/vendor">vendors</a> jack up prices to take advantage of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150602010035/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/29/what_happens_when_nycs_tourism_bubb.php">tourist economy</a>? Next you&apos;ll be telling us Mayor Bloomberg has a problem <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150602010035/http://gothamist.com/tags/sodaban">with sugary drinks.</a></p>
