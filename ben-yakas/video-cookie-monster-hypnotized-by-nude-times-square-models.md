<p>Spending as much time in Times Square as he does, you&apos;d expect that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150417235030/http://gothamist.com/tags/cookiemonster">Cookie Monster</a> would have gotten used to the occasional naked lady or two, courtesy of artist <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150417235030/http://gothamist.com/tags/andygolub">Andy Golub&apos;s</a> body painting excursions. And yet, Cookie Monster just can&apos;t take his googly eyes off the topless women in the video below (Mario and Minnie Mouse also look slightly scandalized). Hey, whatever keeps the costumed characters from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150417235030/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/09/times_square_cookie_monster_called.php">shoving two-year-olds</a>!</p>
