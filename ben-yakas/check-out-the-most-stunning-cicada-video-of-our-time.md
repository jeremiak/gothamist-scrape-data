<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717103902/http://gothamist.com/tags/cicadas">Cicada lust</a> may have given way to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717103902/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/28/fine_lets_talk_about_nycs_out-of-co.php">The Great Cronut Craze of 2013</a> over the last week, but we haven&apos;t forgotten about our hump-happy insect overlords. Billions of them emerged across the East Coast recently after 17 years dormancy underground, biding their time until <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717103902/https://www.google.com/search?q=high+fade&amp;aq=f&amp;oq=high+fade&amp;aqs=chrome.0.57j0j60j65j0l2.2418j0&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=iman+shumpert+hair&amp;spell=1&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=72qnUbadHces4APNpICQBg&amp;ved=0CCgQvwUoAA&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_qf.&amp;bvm=bv.47244034,d.dmg&amp;fp=d448b6bc5c92f47b&amp;biw=1428&amp;bih=724">high top fades</a> made a comeback. We may not have gotten to see many outside of Staten Island, but who needs to see things in real life when there are gorgeous documentaries to watch! </p>

<p>Natural history filmmaker and time-lapse photographer Samuel Orr has been following and filming various broods of periodical cicadas since 2007. He&apos;s already collected over 200 hours of footage, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717103902/http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/motionkicker/return-of-the-cicadas">he has a Kickstarter</a> in which he&apos;s trying to raise money to be able to film the Brood II from May-August 2013. All of that footage will go towards an hour long documentary that will be broadcast on PBS sometime in 2014. Based on the trailer below for &quot;Return of the Cicadas,&quot; he certainly knows how to bring out the bugs&apos; best sides.</p>
