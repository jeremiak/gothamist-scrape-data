<p>It seems obvious that one shouldn&apos;t try to kayak during <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160714151640/http://gothamist.com/tags/hurricaneirene">Hurricane Irene</a>, a storm which has already brought the MTA to a complete standstill without uprooting a single tree&#x2014;heck, just <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160714151640/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/27/bloomberg_6.php">boarding up your home</a> can be dangerous in this weather. And yet, two people who completely ignored the warnings about Irene <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160714151640/http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2011/08/cops_pulls_2_kayakers_from_wat.html">had to be rescued</a> by emergency services this evening off of Great Kills, Staten Island. As a grumpy Mayor Bloomberg said tonight, <strong>&quot;Clearly a reckless act that diverted badly needed NYPD resources.&quot;</strong></p>

<p>The two <em>adult</em> males capsized off Mayberry Promenade earlier this evening. They were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160714151640/http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2011/08/27/two-staten-island-kayakers-are-rescued/?mod=WSJBlog">found by</a> an NYPD Patrol Boat; they floated in the water wearing lifejackets for approximately 30 minutes before their rescue. As Bloomberg put it, <strong>&quot;Why they were out there, in spite of the warnings, I don&apos;t know.&quot;</strong> During <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160714151640/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/27/bloomberg_everyone_should_stay_insi.php">his evening update</a> on Irene, Bloomberg used the two as examples of what NYers should <em>not</em> do during the storm. </p>

<p>And there is a moral to this story: after the men were safely brought to Great Kills Marina, they were issued summonses.</p>
