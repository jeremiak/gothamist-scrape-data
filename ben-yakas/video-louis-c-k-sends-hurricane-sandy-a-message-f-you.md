<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405204448/http://gothamist.com/tags/louisck">Louis C.K.</a>&#x2014;who is gearing up to host <em>Saturday Night Live</em> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405204448/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/31/video_louis_ck_embraces_the_weather.php">for the first time</a> this weekend&#x2014;appeared on Late Night With Jimmy Fallon last night to delivery a very special message to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405204448/http://gothamist.com/tags/hurricanesandy">Hurricane Sandy</a>, on behalf of all New Yorkers. Among other things, he also discussed how he&apos;s really regretting not buying a mansion and some horses now that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405204448/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/28/louis_ck_cancels_shows_due_to_paul.php">&quot;Paul Bunyan Shitcloud&quot;</a> has destroyed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405204448/http://gothamist.com/2012/09/04/photo_louis_cks_yacht_gets_stuck_in.php">his boat</a>: &quot;I had exactly enough money to buy a boat...I rent an apartment, and I own a boat.&quot; </p>

<p>C.K. also described what it was like gearing up for SNL with the table read, and his anxieties over forgetting his lines. He also said there was one sketch he was particularly excited about, even though it made him nauseous to think about: &quot;There&apos;s one sketch that I&apos;m in that I really hate, because what Im doing in it is really embarrassing, and I&apos;m wearing stuff and it&apos;s awful. But I knew there should be one thing in it that I really don&apos;t want to do.&quot; Unfortunately, you probably <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405204448/http://gothamist.com/2012/11/02/louis_ck_line.php">won&apos;t be able to get stand-by tickets</a> for tomorrow.</p>
