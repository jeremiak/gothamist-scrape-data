<p>A man was struck by a 1 train in lower Manhattan this afternoon. According to the FDNY, the man was struck by a southbound 1 train at the Canal Street station near Varick Street just after 3 p.m. According <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130605052252/https://twitter.com/jadabird/status/312650122435637248">to a witness</a>, &quot;Guy was leaning over track and got sideswiped by downtown 1/9 train. Moving and breathing.&quot; </p>

<p>FDNY added that he was taken to Bellevue Hospital, but were not sure of his condition. Another <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130605052252/https://twitter.com/TerriT/status/312653759362789377">witness tweeted</a>, &quot;Man hit by 1 train at canal. I was on it. He&apos;s ok. But they carried him out and it wasn&apos;t pretty.&quot; Yesterday, a man <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130605052252/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/14/person_fatally_struck_by_train_at_b.php">was fatally struck</a> by a train in midtown Manhattan.</p>
