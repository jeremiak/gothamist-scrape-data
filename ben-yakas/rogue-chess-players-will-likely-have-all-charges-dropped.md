<p>Great news summons aficionados: those outlaw chess players who were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160417051328/http://gothamist.com/2010/11/17/nypd_cracking_down_on_rogue_chess_p.php">ticketed</a> this fall will likely have all their charges dismissed! Seven chess players were given tickets for playing on chess boards in a children&apos;s play area in Inwood, which caused much <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160417051328/http://gothamist.com/2010/11/21/residents_rally_to_support_chess_pl.php">controversy</a> amongst parents in the area whose children had learned to play from the men. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160417051328/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/12/29/outlaw-chess-players-likely-to-have-charges-dismissed/">Yesterday morning</a>, three of the men were given &quot;adjournments in contemplation of dismissals,&quot; meaning the charges will be dropped if they stay out of trouble for six months. </p>

<p>One of the men didn&apos;t show up to court, and two others turned down the deal out of principle, and plan to fight in court. One of those men, Yacahudah Harrison, claims that a park ranger had explicitly given him permission to play at the tables, and wants the charges to be dismissed outright. Checkmate.</p>
