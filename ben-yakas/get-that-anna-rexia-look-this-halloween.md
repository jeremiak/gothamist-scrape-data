<p>You might not believe it, but Halloween is just a little over a month away. And as such, people have already started thinking about what <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151105042427/http://gothamist.com/2010/10/29/group_protests_slutty_child_hallowe.php">inappropriate</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151105042427/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/07/in_law_school_steve_levy_dressed_as.php">button-pushing</a> costume we might don this year. Oh sure, a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151105042427/http://gothamist.com/2010/02/10/sesame_street_2.php">sexy Sesame Street costume</a> worked just fine in 2010, but this is 2011! It&apos;s a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151105042427/http://gothamist.com/tags/planking">brave new world</a>! But we think we&apos;ve found the costume for you to make the perfect splash on October 31st: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151105042427/http://www.rickyshalloween.com/women-halloween-costumes/anna-rexia.html">&quot;Anna Rexia.&quot;</a></p>

<p>The costume, which was designed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151105042427/http://www.dreamgirldirect.com/index2.html">by Dreamgirls</a>, has been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151105042427/http://boingboing.net/2007/10/08/anna-rexia-halloween.html">floating around the internet</a> picking up controversy for a few years on sites such as HalloweenStreet. They quickly removed it from their site after numerous complaints about bad taste: &quot;We seriously apologize if this costume has offended anyone. The costume has been taken down from our store due to the complaints and we didn&apos;t realize the kind of harm this would cause.&quot; </p>

<p>But it seems that Ricky&apos;s Costume Superstore isn&apos;t fazed by the prospect of offending hundreds of thousands of women who have struggled with eating disorders their whole lives&#x2014;the product <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151105042427/http://www.rickyshalloween.com/women-halloween-costumes/anna-rexia.html">is currently &quot;coming soon&quot;</a> (there&apos;s even <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151105042427/http://www.3wishes.com/images/annarexiaplus-d.jpg">a &quot;plus&quot; size</a>). We spoke to Ricky&apos;s today, however, and they told us that despite the &quot;coming soon&quot; banner, they are no longer in the hilariously-offensive-costumes business: <strong>&quot;Ricky&#x2019;s NYC is actually no longer selling that costume and has taken it off their website.&quot;</strong></p>
