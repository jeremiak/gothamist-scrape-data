<p>On a windy, drizzly, downtrodden day like today, you might like to stare off into the distance and slip into fantasies of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507003330/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/25/five_great_local_beaches_you_can_ge.php#photo-1">sand clogging up your toes</a>&#x2014;but hopefully you&apos;re not tied to being nekked in those fantasies, because the last bastion of nude sunbathing in the area is going by the wayside. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507003330/http://gothamist.com/tags/fireisland">Fire Island</a> National Seashore authorities have announced that they will start enforcing long-standing laws banning nude sunbathing. We can think of at least one person who must be happy about this development:</p>

<p>Fire Island chief ranger Lena Koschmann <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507003330/http://www.newsday.com/long-island/towns/officials-ban-nude-sunbathing-on-fire-island-1.4717776">told Newsday they were enforcing</a> the nudity ban because of increased complaints about sex, masturbation and prostitution. &quot;We&apos;ve been struggling to make it work because Fire Island has a history of that type of use and people have been coming there for years,&quot; Koschmann said. &quot;The more we talked about it and researched it, the more we realized that that use wasn&apos;t compatible with an area like Lighthouse Beach.&quot;</p>

<p>Also hurting <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507003330/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7T8Z96GYPG8">the lazy sunbathers</a>: Hurricane Sandy <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507003330/http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/11/23/15390793-nys-fire-island-saved-from-sandy-by-dunes-but-those-are-gone-now?lite">wiped out the barrier island&apos;s dunes</a>, which previously provided some cover and obscured the view for the beachgoers with delicate sensibilities. &quot;There has been a huge change in the demographic and the types of activities happening there in the last 10 or 15 years,&quot; said Koschmann. &quot;Now when you go out there it&apos;s a party atmosphere. There&apos;s DJs and music, and people partying and drinking.&quot; But no more genitalia. </p>
