<p>Last week, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130728081037/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/05/video_jerry_seinfeld.php">we saw the teaser</a> for Jerry Seinfeld&apos;s new web series, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130728081037/http://comediansincarsgettingcoffee.com/">Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee.</a> From what we could gather from the little info available, a bunch of high-profile guests&#x2014;including Larry David, Ricky Gervais, Colin Quinn, Bob Einstein, Michael Richards and Alec Baldwin&#x2014;would be joining Seinfeld for rides in his classic car collection. Now, a new promo (which you can watch below) gives a lot better indication of what the series will be like&#x2014;and as David puts it, &quot;you have finally done a show about nothing.&quot;</p>

<p>So it seems Seinfeld WON&apos;T be spending all of the series in one of his ridiculous classic cars&#x2014;there&apos;ll be plenty of footage of the comedians shooting the shit in various coffee shops. Already, we&apos;re most excited for the David episode&#x2014;as was proved in the seventh season of <em>Curb Your Enthusiasm</em>, the two still have a hilarious, easy going chemistry that brings out the best in Jerry. </p>

<p>And what&apos;s more Larry David than refusing to get coffee on a show about drinking coffee: &quot;I can talk just as well holding this cup [of Herbal Tea] as if there were coffee in it. What&apos;s the difference?&quot; David asks. Seinfeld&apos;s response: &quot;We go to an ice cream shop, I get a cone, and you get a salad. That&apos;s the difference. And you go, &apos;What? I&apos;m eating, you&apos;re eating!&apos;&quot;</p>
