<p>The Times has a new profile of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602114453/http://gothamist.com/tags/andrewcuomo">Andrew Cuomo</a> today, in which they harshly take him to task for his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602114453/http://gothamist.com/2010/10/16/sigh_paladino_attacks_cuomo_on_his.php">historical indecisiveness</a> on gay marriage and his ties to special interests. Oh wait, it&apos;s actually about his car collection. Vroom! Could this be the Times&apos; subtle way of confirming that Cuomo&apos;s sexual prowess is, indeed, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602114453/http://gothamist.com/2010/10/08/paladino_fails_to_change_his_campai.php">legendary</a>? All we know is, Cuomo really loves playing with his cars, whether he&apos;s using his &quot;Jedi level&quot; skills to tinker with the engines, or his 1968 Pontiac GTO convertible to romance Sandra Lee. Maybe Cuomo can get the NJ king of the turnpike ode, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602114453/http://gothamist.com/2009/12/09/the_boss_snubs_jerseys_new_republic.php">Bruce Springsteen</a>, to play his inauguration.</p>
