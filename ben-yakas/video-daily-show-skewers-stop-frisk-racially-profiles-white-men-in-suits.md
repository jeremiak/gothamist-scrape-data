<p>John Oliver, who has been doing an excellent job filling in for Jon Stewart on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504232814/http://gothamist.com/tags/dailyshow">the Daily Show</a> this summer, covered this week&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504232814/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/12/federal_judge_stop_frisk_violates_u.php">big federal ruling</a> that the NYPD&apos;s use of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504232814/http://gothamist.com/tags/stopandfrisk">stop-and-frisk</a> is unconstitutional. He compared it to catch and release fishing (&quot;Except you get to feel the fish up and shout out at it before throwing it back. Also, almost all the fish are brown.&quot;), and nailed the divide between those who are actually affected by the policy and everyone else: &quot;For years opinion has been divided on stop-and-frisk, with Black and Latino residents of this city saying it&apos;s an invasion of their liberty, and white residents saying, <strong>&apos;Oh I think I heard a thing about that on NPR. Is that still happening?&apos;</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>Following a brief detour making fun of camera-loving Carlos Danger, Oliver focused on Mayor Bloomberg and Ray Kelly&apos;s reactions to the decision. After playing clips of various people describing their experiences being stopped and frisked, Oliver had a eureka moment, and tried to couch it in terms white people could understand: &quot;You know how we feel at the airport, when the TSA is patting us down, unnecessarily delaying us, looking for weapons we obviously don&apos;t have?&quot; he asked. &quot;And we&apos;re just trying to get to our gate? <strong>Well, just imagine your entire neighborhood is Terminal B at LaGuardia, and the TSA agents sometimes talk to you like this: &apos;Um, boarding pass please and what the f*** are you looking at?&apos;&quot;</strong> </p>

<p>Senior correspondent Jessica Williams didn&apos;t think that stop-and-frisk was going far enough&#x2014;so she headed to one of NYC&apos;s most crime-ridden neighborhoods to profile white men in suits: Wall Street, also known as White Bronx and Business Harlem. &quot;It is a hard fact that white collar crime is disproportionately committed by people who fit a certain profile,&quot; Williams said. &quot;So if you&apos;re a, say, white, Upper East Side billionaire with ties to the financial industry like Michael Bloomberg, you&apos;ve just got to accept being roughed up by the police every once in a while.&quot;<br>
