At least two female teachers have filed complaints about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140506224908/http://bronxdalehigh.org/">Bronxdale High School</a> principal John Chase Jr., and one even filed a harassment report with the local police precinct because he, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140506224908/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/bronx/hs_sex_machine_znpviKY8SzyOGzqMFLhsxJ">in the words of the Post</a>, &quot;proudly prattled about putting his Peter into school office orifices.&quot; As one angry staffer told them,  <strong>&#x201C;The fact that he&#x2019;s still in the building is absurd. He keeps talking about his dick.&#x201D;</strong><p></p>

<p>According to a Sept. 19 police report, Chase allegedly told one school staff member, &#x201C;We have a fancy copy machine that does all sorts of things. It even has a hole to stick your dick in for a blow job.&quot; In addition, Chase allegedly talked about a hole in the wall&#x2014;left behind by phone repairmen&#x2014;with great enthusiasm, because he said it meant he could shove his member into it whenever he wanted. He also allegedly made other sexually explicit remarks to staff.</p>

<p>A spokeswoman for the Department of Education said that its internal Office of Equal Employment was investigating one allegation of misconduct against Chase, who was hired as a science teacher in Brooklyn in 2006. He was a teacher and assistant principal at Brooklyn Academy for Conservation and the Environment before he was appointed interim acting principal at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140506224908/http://insideschools.org/high/browse/school/1736">Bronxdale HS</a> in July. </p>
