<p>A 66-year-old man was saved by some quick thinking fishermen after he fell into Jamaica Bay in Brooklyn yesterday. The man, whose name hasn&apos;t been released, was preparing to fish and sitting on a rail at Brooklyn&#x2019;s Canarsie pier at around 12:45 p.m. when he fell in. That&apos;s when the two fishermen, whom the Post identify as Frankie and Ray, were able to cast a line and snag the flailing man by his sweater and keep his head above water until officials arrived. &quot;He was 230 pounds and the current would have taken him out,&quot;  witness Joseph Bologna <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150103065912/http://nypost.com/2014/04/26/fisherman-casts-rod-and-hooks-drowning-man-saving-him/">told the Post</a>. &quot;The guy was bobbing up and down. They were trying to save him.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Frankie and Ray grabbed him with a gaff&#x2014;a treble hook,&#x2019;&#x2019; Bologna added. &quot;They couldn&#x2019;t pull him out of the water, but they kept him from going under. If they didn&#x2019;t use the hooks, he would have drowned.&quot; Firefighters were able to get the man onto an NYPD boat and started first aid. &quot;He had a very weak pulse,&quot; Detective Mark Sondero, part of the NYPD harbor unit rescue team, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150103065912/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/fisherman-save-drowning-man-hooking-sweater-article-1.1770531">told the News</a>. &quot;He was not breathing and turning blue.&quot;</p>

<p>Fellow fisherman John Lopez said someone aboard the rescue boat initially made a sign that he had died: &quot;But then a guy [another rescuer] jumped from his boat to the other boat and used a defibrillator. The guy [saved from drowning] gave out a big yell and everybody cheered. It was a miracle that they saved his life.&quot;</p>

<p>The man was taken to Brookdale Hospital where he is listed in critical condition.</p>
