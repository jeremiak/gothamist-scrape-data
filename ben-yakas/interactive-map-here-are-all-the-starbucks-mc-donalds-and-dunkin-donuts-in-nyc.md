<p>Considering how many locations these corporations have in the area, it&apos;s probable that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506102424/http://gothamist.com/tags/mcdonalds">McDonald&apos;s</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506102424/http://gothamist.com/tags/starbucks">Starbucks</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506102424/http://gothamist.com/tags/dunkindonuts">Dunkin&apos; Donuts</a> are the most frequented eateries in NYC, as they are in the rest of the United States. But up until now, you&apos;ve had to go through brand websites and complicated Google searches to find out <em>where</em> these stores were. Well, search no longer: in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506102424/http://www.smalldatajournalism.com/projects/one-offs/fusion-doh-map/">handy map below</a>, you can see the locations for all the city&apos;s finest McDonald&apos;s (yellow), Starbucks (green) and Dunkin&apos; Donuts (brown).</p>

<p>Well, it has almost every location&#x2014;the new <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506102424/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/10/bedford_ave_dunkin_donuts_now_open.php">Dunkin&apos; on Bedford Avenue</a> was a little too new to make the cut. The interactive map was made by Dan Nguyen, as part of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506102424/http://www.smalldatajournalism.com/projects/one-offs/mapping-with-fusion-tables/">a tutorial on how to do data visualizations with spreadsheets and Google Fusion Tables.</a></p>

<p>All the data comes from the NYC Health Department as of the start of October 2013; below, you can also check out an interactive map that shows the locations mapped by the score of their latest health inspections.</p>
