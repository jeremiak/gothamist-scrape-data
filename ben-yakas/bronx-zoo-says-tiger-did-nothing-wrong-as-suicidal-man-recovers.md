<p>Yesterday afternoon, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424155434/http://gothamist.com/2012/09/21/breaking_man_jumped_into_the_tiger.php">a man was mauled by a tiger</a> after he jumped out of the Bronx Zoo&#x2019;s Wild Asia Monorail and into a tiger den. The victim, who has now been identified as 25-year-old David Villalobos, was mauled by Bachuta, an 11-year-old male Amur tiger, around 3 p.m. Friday. His leg was mauled and his lung was punctured, among other injuries; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424155434/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20120921/belmont/man-critically-hurt-after-landing-tiger-den-at-bronx-zoo">sources told DNAInfo that</a> Villalobos told people there he jumped in on purpose because &quot;he wanted to die.&quot; &#x201C;He&#x2019;s amazing and he loves everybody,&#x201D; the victim&#x2019;s sister, who didn&apos;t give her name, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424155434/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/bronx/man-injured-jumping-falling-tiger-den-bronx-zoo-article-1.1165004">told the News</a>. &#x201C;I really don&#x2019;t know what happened.&#x201D;<br>
<span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right"> <img alt="92212tiger2.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424155434im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/92212tiger2.jpg" width="150" height="188"> <br> <i style=" width:150px; ;display:block"> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424155434/http://streeteasy.com/nyc/contact/102093-david-villalobos">via Street East</a></i></div> Villalobos, from Mahopac, was able to leap over a perimeter fence from the monorail, a feat the Zoo said had never been done before. &#x201C;The tiger was asleep. But then the tiger started chasing him, and it chewed off his foot,&#x201D; one worker who saw the attack firsthand <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424155434/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/bronx/bx_zoo_tiger_mauls_monorail_jumper_rBAAlWt5a1GKUK5SwnlGyO">told the Post.</a> Emergency response staff were able to chase the tiger off using a CO2 fire extinguisher; once the tiger backed off, Villalobos was instructed to roll under a hot wire to safety.<p></p>

<p>Altogether, he suffered &quot;various bites or puncture wounds on his arms and legs and also the top of his shoulder on his back,&quot; said Bronx Zoo Director Jim Breheny. He also suffered a broken arm and ankle, likely from the jump. Breheny was quick to point out that although they were ready to shoot the tiger if necessary, &quot;the tiger did nothing wrong.&quot; &quot;Tigers are extremely capable predators: They typically grab a prey animal by the back of the neck and it&apos;s over very quickly,&quot; Breheny said. &quot;This cat did not do this to the individual.&quot; </p>

<p>&#x201C;We&#x2019;ve never had a single incident like this,&#x201D; Breheny added. &#x201C;You have to be determined to jump out.&#x201D; Villalobs is still at Jacobi Hospital in serious condition. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424155434/http://www.facebook.com/david.m.villalobos">On his Facebook page</a>, where he lists &quot;Mother Earth&quot; as his religion, he had posted a picture of a tiger on Thursday. A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424155434/http://www.nbcwashington.com/news/national-international/Bronx-Zoo-Tiger-Den-Man-Attacked-Loses-Foot-170748326.html">former classmate told NBC,</a> &quot;Recently I saw some of the stuff he wrote on Facebook and it seemed a little strange,&quot; Paul Giarraputo said. &quot;He wrote a lot of deep emotional things&#x2014;very religious, spiritual.  I wouldn&apos;t say depressing.  He was very in tune with his mind and religion.&quot; </p>
