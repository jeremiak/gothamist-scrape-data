David John and Cardenas fooling around (David John)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>Last week, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405030302/http://gothamist.com/2014/03/16/nypd_officer_claims_boss_sexually_h.php">an NYPD officer filed a lawsuit</a> against her boss, whom she claims subjected her to regular sexual harassment in front of other officers, including groping her, showing her photos of his penis, and referring to her as his &quot;work pussy.&quot; Now the accused harasser, Sgt. David John, has filed a countersuit against officer Ann Cardenas, claiming she was the one texting him explicit things&#x2014;like the photo showing her in a Catwoman costume, above. &quot;She&#x2019;s trying to ruin my reputation,&#x201D; he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405030302/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/nypd-sergeant-accused-harassing-officer-fires-back-article-1.1726279">told the News</a>. &quot;It&#x2019;s definitely a scam. I thought I was surrounded by friends and now I feel like Julius Caesar, they stabbed me in the back.&quot;</p>

<p>Cardenas, 29, said in her suit that the 41-year-old John harassed her for more than a year while they both worked at the 83rd Precinct in Bushwick. But John says in his $35 million suit that they were intimate about 10 times in an arrest processing room in the station house. He says he referred to her as his &quot;work wife,&quot; and they had an affectionate and flirtatious relationship: &quot;She was a very cool person to talk to,&#x201D; he said. &quot;She gave me advice on women during my divorce.&#x201D;</p>

<p>John, who is a 20 year NYPD veteran, has filed for retirement, but that is on hold while the Brooklyn district attorney&#x2019;s office and the NYPD&#x2019;s Internal Affairs Bureau investigate Cardenas&apos; claims. &#x201C;They took my guns away, they took my name away, they took my livelihood,&#x201D; he added. Cardenas&apos; lawyer responded to his countersuit, saying, &quot;Any physical contact that there may have been [between Cardenas and John] was forcible and without her consent.&quot;</p>
