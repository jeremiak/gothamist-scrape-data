<p>Back in the &apos;90s, pro skateboarder <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141022155633/https://www.facebook.com/markthegonzgonzales">Mark &#x201C;The Gonz&#x201D; Gonzales</a> designed the Circle Board&#x2014;it&apos;s the Voltron of skateboards, and includes nine boards attached to each other in the shape of a water wheel. He recently crafted a new one and took to the streets of Manhattan to try it out, as you can see in the video below (which includes Woody Allen-style credits and Dave Brubeck&apos;s &quot;Take 5&quot; on the soundtrack). </p>

<p>It doesn&apos;t exactly lend itself to the urban environment&#x2014;we would certainly not recommend anyone tries using one in traffic, like the guys in the video do. But the real question is: can you <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141022155633/http://gothamist.com/2013/12/06/watch_a_gif_of_skateboarder_jumping.php">jump over the subway tracks</a> with it?</p>
