<p>Rabbi Yehuda Levin has long been an outspoken and controversial figure in the Orthodox Jewish community, and even more extreme than many of his allies&#x2014;his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110725092629/http://gothamist.com/2010/10/06/cuomo_paladino_woo_the_jews.php">unholy team-up</a> with former Republican gubernatorial candidate Carl Paladino last year fizzled out after Paladino <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110725092629/http://gothamist.com/2010/10/14/rabbi_levin_almost_choked_on_his_sa.php">reneged on anti-homosexual remarks</a> he had made. But now, Levin is really going out of his way to stir the pot: in his weekly internet broadcast, Levin <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110725092629/http://joemygod.blogspot.com/2011/07/rabbi-yehuda-levin-gay-marriage-caused.html">blamed the murder</a> of eight-year-old Hasidic boy <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110725092629/http://gothamist.com/tags/leibykletzky">Leiby Kletzky</a> on Jews who supported gay rights, gay marriage, and abortion clinics.

<blockquote>Why was this [death of Kletzky] allowed to happen? Let&#x2019;s think about it. If we go back to the cause, the effect was he was the victim, but the cause was a Jew [Yiddish] that the evil will come to destroy you within your midst. [...] For too long we have been turning our cheek, we have been turning away and ignoring the agenda of the descendants of Amalek [evil] &#x2014; first they [Gay&apos;s] wanted rights, then they wanted adoption, they wanted special protections, and ultimately they wanted marriage &#x2014; and we all know that we did precious little. If those three or fourth thousand people [who searched for the boy when we went missing], at the direction of the greater Israel and their leaders and their common sense, would have come out, maybe, against the marriage, against this final nail in the coffin of morality&#x2026;maybe we wouldn&#x2019;t have had to had this episode of Amalek [evil] replay itself. This is a time for introspection&#x2026;This came in the very aftermath of the marriage bill, my dear friends, and not doing anything.</blockquote>

<p>Levin has made no secret of his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110725092629/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcB9SZn3MQU">disgust toward homosexuality</a>, and he has argued in the past that he is justified because he is &quot;standing up for his religion.&quot; The National Organization for Marriage (NOM), who are also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110725092629/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/12/national_organization_for_marriage.php">adamantly anti-gay marriage</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110725092629/http://thinkprogress.org/lgbt/2011/07/20/273787/nom-rabbi-blames-gay-marriage-for-murder/">recently invited</a> Levin to join them at a rally protesting New York&#x2019;s same sex marriage bill, which will go into effect this Sunday.</p>
