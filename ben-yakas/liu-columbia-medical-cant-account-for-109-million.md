										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="7910countingfail.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522150921im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/7910countingfail.jpg" width="240" height="189" class="image-left"> </span>A new audit of Columbia University Medical Center has revealed that it has been given over $100 million of city money for work it can&apos;t prove it provided, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522150921/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/07/09/2010-07-09_audit_cant_account_for_109m_of_columbia_work.html">according</a> to City Comptroller John Liu. Health and Hospitals Corporation (HHC) prepaid Columbia $109 million to provide health care for Harlem Hospital during 2008 and 2009, but record-keeping was so terrible that there is no proof most of the work was ever done. </p>

<p>Harlem Hospital got into trouble earlier this year when it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522150921/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/26/over_4000_heart_tests_went_unread_b.php">came out</a> that 4,000 echocardiogram tests were never read by doctors making a diagnosis, and at least 200 people who received those unread tests <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522150921/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/29/200_died_after_heart_tests_went_unr.php">died</a>.</p>

<p>While Liu lambasted the &quot;loosey-goosey&quot; nature of the dealings, the HHC and Columbia put out a joint statement refuting the comptroller&apos;s claims: &quot;Many of the report&apos;s primary assumptions and conclusions are grossly misleading and inaccurate.&quot; That said, we&apos;ve been thinking of all the imaginary things that Columbia could have secretly been using the money for, such as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522150921/http://gothamist.com/2010/02/08/coyotes_at_columbia.php">coyote-wrangling</a>, hiring <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522150921/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/25/columbia_valedictorian_stole_patton.php">joke-writers</a>, or, who knows, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522150921/http://gothamist.com/2010/06/24/court_upholds_columbias_manhattanvi.php">storming the beaches of Manhattanville</a>.</p>
