<p>A cyclist is clinging to life after a hit-and-run driver plowed into him Saturday while fleeing from cops following a violent mugging in Manhattan. Cyclist Al-Matin Mohamed was riding in a bike lane on E. 29th Street around 6:30 a.m. Saturday <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406153623/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/08/cyclist_struck_by_hit-and-run_drive.php">when the Infiniti barreled into him</a> while going the wrong way down the street. &#x201C;His feet were on the sidewalk. The rest of his body was on the street,&#x201D; witness Cecilia Cargill, who went to help Mohamed, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406153623/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/cops-seek-midtown-mugger-mowed-3-article-1.1366951">told the News</a>. &#x201C;He was fighting, fighting, fighting. At first he was unconscious, but then he opened his eyes. I told him not to give up...He was dying. I started praying.&#x201D;</p>

<p>&#x201C;He looked into my eyes as I was praying for him. It looked like he was saying, &#x2018;I&#x2019;m dying, pray for me,&#x2019; &#x201D; she added. Mohamed suffered head trauma, two broken legs, a fractured pelvis and a broken arm. He recently moved to NYC, and was working a one-month stint with pastry chefs at Le Bernardin on W. 51st Street.</p>

<p>&quot;He was easily going 40 to 50 mph,&quot; cabbie Robert <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406153623/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/horror_in_penn_mug_aftermath_LQwrV14MHLgBVOW4RUuJuJ?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Manhattan">told the Post about the driver.</a> &quot;It was a loud crash. You could hear the steel of the pole dragging across the street.&quot; The driver crashed into a local laundromat, abandoned his car, and fled the scene on foot eastward. </p>

<p>Police say the incident was sparked after the driver was involved with a mugging: he and an accomplice allegedly punched a 28-year-old man and grabbed his watch and bag near Penn Station at 34th Street and Seventh Avenue. The accomplice ran off, but the mugger got in his car, running over a cop&#x2019;s foot and hitting a 23-year-old woman before speeding down Sixth Avenue, and eventually hitting Mohamed. </p>
