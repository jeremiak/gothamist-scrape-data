<p>Good news/bad news time: on the plus side, there were fewer overall suspensions at city schools last year over the previous year. But on the negative side, dozens of 4- and 5-year-olds were among those who were suspended. &quot;It&apos;s hard to fathom any reason why nineteen 4-year-olds would be suspended from school by a competent educational system,&quot; New York Civil Liberties Union executive director Donna Lieberman told the News. Seriously: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426152107/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IONyLZn0pLI">four-year-olds, dude.</a></p>

<p>Lieberman was referring to Public School 189 in Manhattan in particular, which handed out 19 suspensions to kindergartners last year. Some of those involved kids who were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426152107/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/05/kindergartners_caught_doing_hanky-p.php">allegedly caught touching and kissing each other</a> in the Washington Heights school. Two parents of kids in the class filed notices of claim against the city, each seeking $5 million in damages, alleging the sexual behavior occurred since last September. </p>

<p>&#x201C;That is so unfair for those kids,&#x201D; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426152107/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/education/dozens-4-5-year-olds-suspended-schools-year-article-1.1203575">said Josephine Aspha</a>, mother of a PS 189 second-grader. &#x201C;I witnessed teachers and staff yelling at other kids [on a recent day]. I understand kids can be kids, but it was kind of chaotic,&#x201D; she said, adding that she wished the school could deal with behavioral problems without resorting to suspensions. </p>

<p>Lieberman also noted that minorities and kids with special needs were more often the targets of discipline. Black kids served 53% of the suspensions, despite representing only 28% of the city&#x2019;s students; and students with disabilities served 32% of suspensions despite only making up 12% of the student population. &quot;These are statistics that have failure written all over them,&quot; Lieberman said.</p>
