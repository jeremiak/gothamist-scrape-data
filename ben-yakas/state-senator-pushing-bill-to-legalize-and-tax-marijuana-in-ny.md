<p>The NYPD has seemingly made good on their promise to cut back on meaningless low-level <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140205195545/http://gothamist.com/tags/marijuana">marijuana possession</a>&#x2014;arrests for weed possession are on track to fall by 20% in 2013, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140205195545/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/12/marijuana_arrests_keep_falling_nypd.php">police say that overall enforcement</a> of marijuana laws are taking a back seat to drugs that can actually kill you. Nevertheless, medical marijuana reform and other such measures keep <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140205195545/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/22/nyc_marijuana_reform_hits_pot_hole.php">hitting potholes in Albany</a>. State Senator Liz Krueger is pushing ahead for something even bigger: &#x201C;It is my intention as a New York State senator to soon introduce a law that would actually decriminalize, regulate and tax marijuana in New York,&#x201D; she <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140205195545/http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/politics/2013/05/8530084/new-non-smoking-champion-marijuana-legalization-new-york">told a crowd this week</a> on the Upper East Side.</p>

<p>According <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140205195545/http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/politics/2013/05/8530084/new-non-smoking-champion-marijuana-legalization-new-york">to CapitalNY</a>, Krueger unveiled a draft of her bill, &quot;Marijuana, Regulation, and Taxation Act.&#x201D; Under it, NY adults would be allowed ot grow up to six pot plants at home; they could buy and sell weed just like alcohol; weed sales would be regulated by the New York State Liquor Authority; drivers wouldn&apos;t be allowed to operate vehicles under the influence; and pot would be taxed heavily, around $50 an ounce.</p>

<p>Most of the proceeds from the sales (80%) would go to the state&#x2014;the rest would go toward substance abuse, criminal re-entry and job training programs. Krueger, who noted she hasn&apos;t smoked pot since the 1970s, had a very sympathetic audience&#x2014;but even with Gov. Andrew Cuomo supporting decriminilizing small amounts of marijuana, it&apos;ll be an uphill battle to get this bill the support it needs.</p>

<p>&quot;In the same way that Harvey Milk felt strongly that if you want rights then you have to stand up and say that you want your rights, and that you&#x2019;re gay and you want your rights, and I think it&#x2019;s the same way with pot smokers,&quot; said panelist Julie Holland, a psychiatrist who wrote <em>The Pot Book</em>. &quot;I think that people have to stand up and say...&apos;I&#x2019;m a C.P.A. and I pay my taxes and I vote and I&#x2019;m a pot smoker.&quot; </p>

<p>Perhaps they should also consider some alternative selling points as well:</p>
