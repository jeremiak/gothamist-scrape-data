<p>A woman was allegedly raped in Central Park early this morning. Police say that the incident happened around 4:30 a.m. near 100th Street and Fifth Avenue inside the park. According <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140208080801/http://nypost.com/2013/11/17/police-investigating-alleged-central-park-rape/">to the Post</a>, the woman told police that a man approached her, pulled her off the path and raped her in a wooded area in the northeast corner of the park.</p>

<p>Cops say no arrests have been made, and the investigation is ongoing. We&apos;ll update as we learn more information. </p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: Cops tell us that the woman initially walked into the park with her alleged attacker early this morning&#x2014;she wasn&apos;t jumped or dragged into the park. They also say the incident was reported closer to 3:30 a.m. </p>

<p>Police haven&apos;t released any other info about the incident, including the age of the woman, yet. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140208080801/http://awalkintheparknyc.blogspot.com/">A Walk In The Park noted that</a> a large hilly area on the East side of the park was cordoned off for most for the day as crime scene personnel gathered evidence. </p>
