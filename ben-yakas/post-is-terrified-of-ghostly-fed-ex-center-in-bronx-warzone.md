title: Post Is Terrified Of Ghostly FedEx Center In Bronx Warzone

<p>Are you wondering what happened to that desperately-needed package of hygiene products your mom promised she sent you weeks ago? Well, if you live in a building in Manhattan without a doorman or neighbor to sign for your package, it&apos;s probably stuck in the Bronx at a massive FedEx storing facility. But that&apos;s not in just any old corner of the Bronx: it&apos;s in the Fallujah section of the borough.</p>

<p>At least <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120119084118/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/bronx/it_fedex_bx_where_house_bYz0UQukVUXYoXrmFgmKZK?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">that&apos;s what the Post</a> would have you believe. The center, at 670 E. 132 St. in Port Morris, is located in the 40th Precinct, which has seen a minor spike in crime this year, with robberies up 13 percent compared with 2009. But the way the Post describes it, you&apos;ll be taking your life into your hands to try to venture there to retrieve your Christmas socks, and that&apos;s if you can even <em>find </em>it. If you take the subway, forget it: you&apos;ll have to face a &quot;harrowing&quot; 15 minute walk, at the end of an &quot;unnamed access road that doesn&apos;t appear on Google Maps,&quot; if it even ever existed at all! Think driving there will be easier? Only if you enjoy &quot;dark, derelict industrial parks populated by drug pushers and prostitutes hassling and harassing&quot; you. </p>

<p>Maybe FedEx doesn&apos;t want you to find them; after all, they don&apos;t even post directions to the service center on their website. Or maybe there&apos;s some nefarious conspiracy afoot...&quot;It&apos;s not like we&apos;re trying to hide it. If someone wanted to know, they could call our customer-service line. The operator will have a screen with the directions,&quot; FedEx spokeswoman Sally Davenport said. But that&apos;s exactly what a spooky ghost would <em>want </em>you to believe.</p>
