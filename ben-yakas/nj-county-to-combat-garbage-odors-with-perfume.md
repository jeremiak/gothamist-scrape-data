And since <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160312145828/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/26/bronx_tenants_consider_plan_to_pump.php">it&apos;s been tried</a> it in the Bronx and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160312145828/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/01/can_perfume_cover_up_queens_stench.php">in Queens</a>, the county will try to combat the smell <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160312145828/http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2010/08/middlesex_county_attempts_to_n.html">with perfume</a>. A flatbed truck equipped with special nozzles stalks through the garbage, releasing hundreds of gallons of a fragrant, soapy, slightly citrus-scented spray. In 2007, the county tried attaching deodorizing sprays to the landfill&apos;s fence, which didn&apos;t work, and gives added pressure to this scheme. Local resident Jerri Shink said, &quot;It&#x2019;s terrible...We go to the grocery store and my son tells people, &#x2018;<strong>We live in the stinkiest part of town</strong>.&#x2019; You can&#x2019;t open a window. At times it will permeate the walls.&quot;</p>
