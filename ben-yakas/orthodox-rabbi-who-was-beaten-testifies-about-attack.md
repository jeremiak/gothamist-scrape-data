<p>The Brooklyn Rabbi who was brutally attacked by two teenagers on Thanksgiving <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170620020831/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/reliving_his_hate_terror_IJehd6Iy0T6Lh1m35q8pVJ?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">testified</a> in Brooklyn Family Court yesterday about the harrowing experience. Joel Weinberger, 26, gave an account of his beatdown, which left him hospitalized for four days with his jaw wired shut and a broken leg, forced to undergo surgery for a broken eye socket that included having three plates implanted in his face. The teens taunted him with shouts of &quot;Jew! Jew!&quot; as &quot;they ripped off my clothes, my hat and my yarmulke. They were punching my face,&quot; he said.</p>

<p>The two 15-year-old boys were charged with assault as a hate crime, and were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170620020831/http://gothamist.com/2010/12/09/teens_connected_to_several_orthodox.php">connected</a> with at least two more attacks on Orthodox Jews in the past weeks. Two NYPD offices testified that the teens said they attacked &quot;the Jew&quot; because &quot;it was something fun to do.&quot; According <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170620020831/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/12/10/2010-12-10_teen_accused_of_beating_rabbi_to_unconsciousness_laughs_during_testimony_from_al.html">to the News</a>, Det. Nicole Carter said the boys claimed they &quot;were bored,&quot; went to a park, bought a &quot;$5 bag of weed, got high&quot; and then decided to go to what they called &quot;Jew Town.&quot; The teens also said that it was easy to attack Jews, because &quot;they don&apos;t hit back.&quot; In case any of that didn&apos;t convince the Judge this was a bias crime, Weinberg added that he offered the two teens his wallet and phone, but they didn&apos;t take them. </p>

<p>As if this wasn&apos;t all disgusting enough, it doesn&apos;t seem like the teens have much remorse: one of them was laughing during the proceedings, prompting a warning from the judge to &quot;treat the process with dignity.&quot; In <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170620020831/http://gothamist.com/2010/12/09/teens_connected_to_several_orthodox.php">previous testimony</a> in the case, it was revealed that the two teens are truants who attend school less than 50% of the time, use drugs, and exhibit &quot;behavior that is out of control,&quot; and according to a defense lawyer, at least one of the teens &quot;needs a substance abuse program.&quot;</p>
