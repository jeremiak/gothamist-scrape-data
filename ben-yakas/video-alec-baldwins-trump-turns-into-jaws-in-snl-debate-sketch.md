<p>Alec Baldwin returned to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171020192350/http://gothamist.com/tags/snl"><em>Saturday Night Live</em></a> for the third consecutive week of ripped-from-the-headlines grotesque Donald Trump shenanigans on the campaign trail. The cold open was devoted to the second &quot;and worst ever&quot; presidential debate, and touched upon Trump&apos;s sexual assault accusations, Trump menacing Hillary Clinton on stage like Jaws, Trump&apos;s racism (&quot;That&apos;s a great question Denzel&quot;), Ken Bone (Bobby Moynihan almost steals the entire sketch) and what Hillary likes about Trump: &quot;Donald Trump and I disagree on almost everything, but I do like how generous he is. Just last Friday, he handed me this election.&quot;  </p>

<p>Guess who was watching SNL this week and wasn&apos;t very happy:</p>
