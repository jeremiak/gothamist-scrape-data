<p>Lt. John Pike has become one of <em>the</em> internet memes of 2011, after video of him <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141220081953/http://sfist.com/2011/11/19/uc_davis_police_brutally_pepper_spray_student_protesters_video.php">nonchalantly pepper-spraying peaceful UC Davis protesters</a> went viral, inspiring <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141220081953/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/23/pepper_spray_developer_shocked_at_i.php">widespread outrage</a>. It&apos;s been internet-immortalized in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141220081953/http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/pepper-spray-cop-casually-pepper-spray-everything-cop/photos">countless Photoshopped images</a>&#x2014;and now, one person has brought a piece of that meme to her Christmas tree!</p>

<p>A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141220081953/http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/mzjja/my_friend_abbie_has_the_best_christmas_sweater/">Reddit user uploaded</a> the above photo, made by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141220081953/https://twitter.com/#!/abbieheppe">Abbie Heppe</a>, of a sweater depicting Baby Jesus being casually pepper-sprayed. Heppe confirmed she knitted it herself on Twitter, adding she makes &quot;silly Xmas sweaters every year.&quot; If you don&apos;t have the skills to make that, you can always go with another OWS-themed product: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141220081953/http://www.instructables.com/id/THE-COMPLETE-RADICAL-SNUGGIE-OCCUPY-quite-WARM-/">&quot;THE COMPLETE RADICAL SNUGGIE: OCCUPY (quite) WARM and (kinda) DRY!&quot;</a></p>
