<p>A 27-year-old man is in critical condition after being struck by a hit-and-run driver in Gowanus early today. Police say the incident happened around around 7:30 a.m. Saturday. They say the man, whose name hasn&apos;t been released, was repairing a Ford Expedition parked halfway on the sidewalk in front of Samba Transmission &amp; Auto Repair (where he worked) on Third Avenue near 7th Street when he was struck by a driver in a black Nissan.</p>

<p>A witness <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140513231514/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/man-clings-life-hit-and-run-accident-article-1.1787255">told the News</a> he was on the road along with the hit-and-run driver at the time: &quot;This guy behind me [in the Nissan] kept beeping at me,&#x201D; Kero told them. &quot;The guy shifted over to the bike lane. He had to be doing 40 to 45 MPH for sure.&quot; </p>

<p>Kero, who didn&apos;t give his last name, doesn&apos;t think the driver saw the victim: &quot;He didn&apos;t see the [Ford Expedition under repair] and swerved to get out of its way. I went into the opposite lane into oncoming traffic to get out of his way. He sideswiped the Ford&apos;s bumper and the [victim] had been standing in the bike lane with his back to us. He hit the guy and the guy went flying and slammed into a parked car head-first.&quot;</p>

<p>Kero says he followed the Nissan down to 14th Street before he lost him&#x2014;&quot;He kept beeping at cars in front of him ...He was swerving a lot&quot;&#x2014;but he was able to get his license plate number and give it to police. The victim was taken to Methodist Hospital in critical condition with severe head trauma. Police add that the investigation is ongoing.</p>
