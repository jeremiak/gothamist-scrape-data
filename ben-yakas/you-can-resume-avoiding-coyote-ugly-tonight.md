<p> <span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none" style=" width:640px; "> <img alt="21811coyote.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120119093439im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/21811coyote.jpg" width="640" height="426"> <br> <i>The whole gang is back! <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120119093439/http://www.coyoteuglysaloon.com/uglypix/main.php?g2_itemId=45380">Coyote Ugly</a></i></div> <p></p>

<p>You just can&apos;t keep a low-to-medium quality stank bar down: Coyote Ugly is set to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120119093439/http://www.dnainfo.com/20110217/lower-east-side-east-village/coyote-ugly-reopen-after-health-department-violations">re-open</a> tonight after being shuttered for the past two days. The seminal East Village dive, which spawned multiple locations around the world as well as a movie based on it, was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120119093439/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/17/coyote_ugly_temporarily_shut_down.php">shut down</a> on Feb. 15 after its latest DOH inspection, during which it was given 90 violation points. </p>

<p>Two days is surely enough time to get the plumbing working, get rid of the rats, get rid of the mice, get rid of the filth flies, wash all the surfaces, sanitize the utensils, and get a Food Protection Certificate. At least they have a surefire plot for <em>Coyote Ugly 2: 2 Sexy 4 Health Inspections</em> (and they can always bring in Kevin Smith <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120119093439/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0200550/trivia">for rewrites</a>).</p>
