The video shows him grabbing her and eventually slamming her against a wall, preventing her from leaving. He then threw her to the ground, kicking and stomping on her. &quot;Why, why you hit me?,&quot; Perez <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160628065057/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local/new_york&amp;id=9051338">told ABC</a> she screamed at her attacker. &quot;Why, why you hit me?&quot;</p>
