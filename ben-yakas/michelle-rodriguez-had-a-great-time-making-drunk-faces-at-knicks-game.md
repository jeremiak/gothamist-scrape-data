<p>Celebrity Row at Madison Square Garden can be a very fun place for celebrities, a safe space where Louis C.K. can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506005606/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/24/best_gif_ever_louis_ck_and_john_sta.php">rub shoulders with John Starks</a>, Spike Lee can indulge in some yell-therapy, and Larry David <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506005606/http://ftw.usatoday.com/2013/11/larry-david-knicks-fan-photo/">can be as miserable as he likes.</a> It&apos;s also an ideal place for celebrities to get hammered, try on the goofiest drunk faces, and make out with models.

It is the internet&apos;s sworn duty to document such behavior for the historical records, so take a glance at some of the pics below&#x2014;just don&apos;t hate on her because she had a much better time than you did at your last Knicks game.</p>
