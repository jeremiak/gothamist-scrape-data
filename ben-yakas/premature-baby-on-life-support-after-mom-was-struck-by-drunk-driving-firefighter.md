<p>A baby girl delivered prematurely <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504151135/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/bronx/firefighter-hits-2-women-car-charged-dwi-article-1.1712494">is on life support</a> after her 7-months-pregnant mom was struck by a drunken firefighter while crossing the street in the Bronx this week. Off-duty FDNY Lieutenant Sean Farrell, 39, struck Mantaz Begum, 42, as the pregnant mom and a friend crossed Westchester Avenue near White Plains Road on her way home around 6 p.m. Thursday. &quot;Yes, I was driving. I was just making a turn on Westchester [Avenue], and all of a sudden, boom! I hit those ladies,&quot; Farrell told cops afterwards.</p>

<p>Farrell, who was previously arrested for drunk driving in 2010, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504151135/http://nypost.com/2014/03/07/newborn-on-life-support-after-drunk-firefighter-crashes-into-pregnant-mom-court-papers/">allegedly admitted</a> to cops that he had drunk two beers before driving. The Post reports that he was &#x201C;unsteady on his feet, incoherent, and had bloodshot and watery eyes&#x201D; when he was arrested. He refused to take a Breathalyzer after the incident, and has been charged with DWI; he also has been suspended for 30 days without pay by the FDNY.</p>

<p>Begum had an emergency C-section at Jacobi Medical Center, and was delivered successfully two months early; the baby girl is on a ventilator because her lungs aren&#x2019;t fully developed. Her big sister Mousumi Akhter, 17, picked out the name Mahzabin (which means &quot;power&quot;) for her: &quot;I was searching on the &#xAD;Internet for an Islamic girl name. I wanted it to be a powerful name because something bad happened to her but she survived,&#x201D; she <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504151135/http://nypost.com/2014/03/08/dwi-firefighter-called-incoherent-after-ramming-pregnant-ma/">told the Post</a>. &quot;I want her to get healthier and stronger. I know in my heart that she is going to be OK.&quot;</p>
