They got into a physical fight, during which Davis pulled out a knife and stabbed 57-year-old Palacios in the stomach. Palacios was taken to the hospital in stable condition where he calmly called his wife, telling her &#x201C;I had an accident. I&#x2019;m at Jacobi. Come down.&quot; </p>

<p>Davis was arrested at the scene, and has been charged with assault and criminal possession of a weapon.
