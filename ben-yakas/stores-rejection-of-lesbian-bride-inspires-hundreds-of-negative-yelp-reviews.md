										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160408143306im_/http://gothamist.com/upload/2011/08/2011_08_groomfull.jpg" width="309" height="400" class="image-left"> </span>Yesterday, we heard about a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160408143306/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/18/lesbian_bride_scolded_rejected_by_n.php">lesbian bride-to-be who was scolded</a>, and then turned away, from a bridal shop in New Jersey because of her sexuality. The story inspired outrage and vitriol toward the bridal shop across the internet, but nowhere more pervasive than on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160408143306/http://www.yelp.com/biz/here-comes-the-bride-somers-point">Here Comes The Bride Yelp page</a>, where around 400 people have posted negative reviews in the last day, with such gems as: &quot;Therefore, myself, an American that believes in the right of everyone to live a life free of inequalities,<strong> I will never ever without a gun to my head step foot through your threshold</strong>...unless I&apos;m a zombie and if that happens,  I&apos;m coming for your brains first.&quot;</p>

<p>Alix Genter, who is set to marry her longtime partner in NY next year, had picked out a dress at Here Comes The Bride when manager Donna Saber found out she was gay&#x2014; because she&apos;d crossed out the word &quot;groom&quot; and written &quot;partner&quot; instead on the paperwork, and Saber called that a &quot;provocation&quot;&#x2014;and refused to sell her the dress. Saber said what Genter was planning was &quot;illegal&quot; and that &quot;we do not participate in any illegal actions.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I was devastated. I was crying. I called her a bigot; I told her, &apos;I am a happy person and you are a miserable person.&apos; Then she hung up on me,&quot; Genter said. According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160408143306/http://www.nj.gov/lps/dcr/law.html">the N.J. Law Against Discrimination</a>, it is unlawful for a person to refuse to buy from, sell to, contract or otherwise do business with an individual because of the individual&apos;s affectional or sexual orientation.</p>

<p>And now, outraged commenters who read the story have taken to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160408143306/http://www.yelp.com/biz/here-comes-the-bride-somers-point">Yelp page</a> to malign the shop. &quot;<strong>So, according to your actual customers - you&apos;re a pushy, overpriced scam artist with poor social skills who can&apos;t even do measuring and alterations properly - AND you&apos;re a homophobe. Kind of impressive, actually</strong>,&quot; said Althea A. &quot;If they were GIVING the dresses away, I still wouldn&apos;t want to be associated with the actions of Donna, the homophobic manager who refused to sell a dress to a gay customer,&quot; said Anne L. People have also added over 20 pictures of gay flags, gay couples, and other gay imagery.</p>

<p>But as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160408143306/http://news.cnet.com/8301-17852_3-20094347-71/yelp-to-pull-critical-reviews-of-anti-gay-marriage-bridal-store/">Cnet points out</a>, the reviews probably won&apos;t be up for much longer. Yelp&apos;s Chantelle Karl told them: &quot;While Yelp does not support any sort of discrimination, reviews of businesses on Yelp should be about the customer experience not the views of a business or its employees...As is our normal procedure, we&apos;ll be working to pull these reviews and notify the reviewers in the coming days.&quot; Commenter Jeff B. asked them to reconsider though: &quot;I urge you to take exception in this instance, as bigotry is something that affects EVERYONE and, because our concerns are based on real-life events, <strong>I believe the Yelp community should be allowed to participate in this form of boycott</strong>.&quot;</p>

<p>The cherry on top of all this? Because of the inundation of negative Yelp reviews, Saber <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160408143306/http://thedailywh.at/2011/08/18/here-comes-the-bigotry-of-the-day/">has reportedly agreed</a> to meet with the bride&apos;s parents &#x201C;to try to smooth things over.&#x201D; She might want to leave out that bit about how she &quot;sensed&quot; Genter&apos;s father&apos;s disappointment in her decision to marry a woman.</p>
