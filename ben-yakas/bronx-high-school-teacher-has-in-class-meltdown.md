One Bronx high school teacher had a complete breakdown in front of his students yesterday after one student reportedly misbehaved. &#x201C;He kind of lost it a little bit. He was taken away on a stretcher,&#x201D; a fellow teacher <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150102031840/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/bronx/bx-high-school-teacher-peter-bogolub-throws-tantrum-cuts-class-article-1.995789">told the News.</a><p></p>

<p>History teacher Peter Bogolub&apos;s meltdown started around 12:15 p.m. yesterday when a student misbehaved during class at Bronx Engineering and Technology Academy in Marble Hill. He allegedly threw a chair across the room and cut himself in the process. &#x201C;A teacher at Bronx Engineering and Technology Academy expressed anger and distress in front of his classroom today,&#x201D; said Education Department spokesman Matt Mittenthal. &#x201C;Students were moved to another room and are safe, and the teacher was taken to the hospital for medical attention.&#x201D; Police said that Bogolub, who was taken to North Central Hospital, suffered an anxiety attack and had trouble breathing.</p>

<p>Students indicated that Bogolub was a popular teacher: &#x201C;He helped us after class. He&#x2019;s the reason I passed my Global History Regents, actually,&quot; said student Jamie. Students even reportedly broke into a chant of &#x201C;Free Bogolub&#x201D; during lunch Thursday. The super at Bogolub&apos;s apartment building, Luis Nunez, was shocked: &#x201C;What you&#x2019;re telling telling me, I can&#x2019;t believe you. He&#x2019;s very respectful, very quiet.&#x201D;</p>
