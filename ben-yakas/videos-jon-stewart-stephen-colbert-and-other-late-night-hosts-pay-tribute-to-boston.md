<p>Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert both paid tribute to Boston last night after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130521043301/http://gothamist.com/tags/bostonmarathon">the deadly marathon bombings</a> which killed three people and injured over 170 more. Both hosts kept their remarks short and sweet at the top of their programs, with Stewart giving thanks to Boston for their resiliency and for &quot;inspiring and solidifying my belief in humanity and the people of this country.&quot; </p>

<p>Colbert skipped his usual intros to make his remarks, in which he praised the home of the buckle-hatted pilgrims and the toughness of its residents: &quot;But here&apos;s what these cowards really don&apos;t get: they attacked the Boston marathon. An event celebrating people who run 26 miles on their day off until their nipples are raw for fun.&quot;</p>

<p>On Monday night, other late night hosts&#x2014;including Conan O&apos;Brien, Craig Ferguson, and Jimmy Kimmel&#x2014;also spoke about the tragic bombing. You can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130521043301/http://theweek.com/article/index/242790/watch-late-night-hosts-react-to-the-boston-marathon-bombing">see all three here</a>&#x2014;and below you can watch Ferguson, who noted he has a personal history with the city, and was particularly emotional: &quot;Obviously the news of today is so horrendous that it would seem insensitive at best to say &#x2018;It&#x2019;s a great day for America,&quot; so I won&#x2019;t be starting the show with that tonight. Is anyone else sick of this s***? I seem to have to say that too often.&#x201D; </p>
