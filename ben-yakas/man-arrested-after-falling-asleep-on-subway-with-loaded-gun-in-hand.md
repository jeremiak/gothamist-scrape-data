<p>A teenager was arrested after he fell asleep on the subway while holding a loaded gun in his hand. Demarrius Jackson, 19, was spotted on a N train with the weapon around 7 a.m. Saturday. According to an NYPD release, a straphanger who got off at Times Square told cops she had spotted Jackson &quot;lying outstretched on the train seats with a firearm in his hand.&quot;</p>

<p>Three officers boarded the train, which was being held by the MTA, doing just that: snoozing across two seats located near the rear doors while holding the gun in his hands. Jackson, from South Carolina, was charged with criminal possession of a loaded firearm, possession of a defaced firearm and unlawful possession of marijuana (cops also found pot in his pocket after this arrest).
