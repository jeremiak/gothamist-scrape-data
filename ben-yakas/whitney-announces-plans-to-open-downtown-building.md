title: Whitney Announces Plans To Open Downtown Building

										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:250px; "> <img alt="41210whitney.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503150239im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/41210whitney.jpg" width="250" height="144"> <br> <i>The (future) Whitney Museum</i></div> After nearly two years of haggling, the board of directors at the Whitney Museum have approved plans to begin construction on a new building in the meatpacking district in Manhattan, to be completed by 2015. <strong>&#x201C;Downtown is a new city, a new nation. Why shouldn&#x2019;t the Whitney be the museum of record there?&#x201D;</strong> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503150239/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/26/arts/design/26plan.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">said</a> Leonard Lauder, the Whitney&#x2019;s chairman emeritus and largest benefactor.<p></p>

<p>Lauder wasn&apos;t always so gung-ho however; the cosmetics heir <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503150239/http://gothamist.com/2008/03/19/whitney_museum_1.php">donated</a> $131 million in March 2008, but had been adamantly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503150239/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/12/board_members_split_on_whitney_high.php">against</a> the second site until recently. Now, having changed his mind (&#x201C;there is no better time to build than now, with construction costs and interest rates at an all-time low,&#x201D; he told the Times), the new Renzo Piano-designed site, to be located near the foot of the High Line, has a $680 million green light.</p>

<p>There will be collateral damage however: because of the size and scope of the project, the Whitney will most likely need to lease its Marcel Breuer-designed original home on Madison Avenue and East 75th Street. And they might just end up leasing it to the Met! An anonymous source told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503150239/http://www.artinfo.com/news/story/34685/whitney-in-talks-to-lease-breuer-building-to-the-met/">Art Info</a> about the possible indecent museum proposal: &#x201C;They&#x2019;ve come to the realization they can&#x2019;t run two places, and they really want to build downtown. Leonard has given all this money but will withdraw it if they get rid of the Madison Avenue building. <strong>This is a way of keeping both buildings and benefiting from it.&#x201D; </strong></p>
