<p>Earlier this week, the city health commissioner jumped at the chance to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110515093959/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/13/city_health_commish_wants_to_take_a.php">further alienate</a> lovers of beloved alco-caffeinated-sugar goop <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110515093959/http://gothamist.com/tags/fourloko">Four Loko</a>, by backing State Senator Jeff Klein&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110515093959/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/28/new_four_loko_not_good_enough_for_s.php">legislation</a> to ban all alcopop drinks from being sold in groceries and bodegas. But the politicians&apos; attempts to marginalize the liver-burning sewer swill has only inspired and motivated its most ardent devotees, who are now coming to its defense...in the name of Democracy: <strong>&quot;Taking away Four Loko is an attack on our freedom and way of life,</strong>&quot; said Brooklyn DJ <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110515093959/http://radicalouting.com/antonglamb/">Anton Glamb</a>.</p>

<p>Glamb, part of the &quot;Bushwick hipster music group Radical Outing,&quot; is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110515093959/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2011/04/15/2011-04-15_brooklyn_deejay_pens_album_in_support_of_four_loko_wants_old_recipe_back_in_stor.html">speaking out</a> against the continued neutering of the gummy bears-gone-crunk drink: &quot;I think that it&apos;s sad that they changed the original formula, a lot of people depended on that drink for their weekend festivities. I think it&apos;s unfair the way that they&apos;re singling out this drink.&quot; Glamb is such a fan, he made an album at the end of last year devoted to the drink, called <em>Never Forget Four Loko,</em> featuring songs such as, &quot;I Drink Four Loko in the Rain,&quot; &quot;Four Loko USA,&quot; and &quot;Girl I Want to Buy You a Can of Four Loko Tonight.&quot; Nothing screams freedom like re-appropriating 9/11 slogans.</p>

<p>And we think somebody might be harboring a bit of a grudge against Governor Cuomo: &quot;Now I hate Andrew Cuomo, what a homo, he&apos;s the fucker that took my Four Loko away. And I will travel to other states to get my fucking Four Loko&apos;s anyway.&quot; Here&apos;s the album:</p>

<p>If you&apos;re so inclined, you can download Glamb&apos;s surprisingly well-produced album (it sounds a little like Chromeo!) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110515093959/http://radicalouting.com/neverforget/">here</a>. Glamb isn&apos;t the only Four Lokartist: Youtube has tons of amateur rappers and musicians who have written (mostly terrible) songs in tribute to the Loko, including the &quot;official&quot; music video:</p>
