<p>With <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140424132009/http://gothamist.com/2014/02/12/more_snow_anyone.php#photo-1">more bastard snow</a> on the way, New Yorkers would be wise to remain vigilant about where they are walking tomorrow, lest they become victim to a bulldozing snow plow. That&apos;s what happened to poor Pedro Plaza last week as he was walking past JM Legend Auto dealership in Sheepshead Bay. &quot;The video I don&apos;t see, but my friends say, &apos;I saw your video, very funny!&apos;&quot; 33-year-old Plaza <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140424132009/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Man-Knocked-Over-Wave-Snow-Plow-Truck-Painful-Wife-Didnt-Believe-Him-245016191.html">told NBC</a>. &quot;Very painful to me.&quot;</p>

<p>Plaza discussed the incident in the video above, posted by the dealership, saying he never saw the snow plow coming. &quot;Then, &apos;Oh, I&#x2019;m on the floor,&apos;&quot; he said. &quot;My head, my eyes now, I have a little pain.&quot; He said when his wife saw his injuries, she didn&apos;t believe his story: &quot;She asked, &apos;What happened, you fight with somebody?&apos;&quot; he recalled. &quot;No, the one truck came to the street and put the ice in my face...&apos;No, I don&apos;t believe it.&apos;&quot;</p>

<p>When asked if he wanted to sue the city, Plaza responded, &quot;I think yes...it&apos;s not safe.&quot; After the videos racked up so many pave views, the Sanitation Department said it was investigating the plow drivers for speeding: &#x201C;The department is taking disciplinary action against the operators,&#x201D; the agency said in a statement.</p>
