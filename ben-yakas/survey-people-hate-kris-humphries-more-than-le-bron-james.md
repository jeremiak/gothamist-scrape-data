<p>Less than two months ago, the basketball season <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120504163723/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/14/nba_players_reject_deal_from_owners.php">seemed lost</a>&#x2014;but on Sunday, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120504163723/http://gothamist.com/tags/basketball">the NBA</a> returns! It&apos;s going to be an exciting Christmas day to herald in the condensed 66-game season, with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120504163723/http://espn.go.com/nba/schedule">marquee matchups between</a> several title contenders, including the Knicks/Boston Celtics, Dallas Mavericks/Miami Heat, LA Lakers/Chicago Bulls, Oklahoma City Thunder/Orlando Magic and LA Clippers/Golden State Warriors. But the real question isn&apos;t who to support&#x2014;everyone who cares already has a team they&apos;re loyal to&#x2014;it&apos;s who to hate. And it seems <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120504163723/http://espn.go.com/new-york/nba/story/_/id/7379217/kris-humphries-most-disliked-nba-player-according-survey">there&apos;s a new villain in the league</a>: Kris Humphries.</p>

<p>The soon-to-be former Mr. Kim Kardashian was voted the most disliked player in the NBA, according to a survey conducted by Nielsen and E-Poll Market Research <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120504163723/http://www.forbes.com/sites/tomvanriper/2011/12/21/the-nbas-most-disliked-players/">that appeared on Forbes.</a> And yes, Kim is to blame for that: &#x201C;He&#x2019;s been on five magazine covers, all in a negative light. It&#x2019;s all so recent, he&#x2019;s gotten all this publicity for something other than basketball talent,&#x201D; said Stephen Master, VP at Nielsen Sports. We&apos;re guessing it&apos;s his talent for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120504163723/http://gawker.com/5862726/kris-humphries-loves-to-fart-on-girls">farting on girls</a>?</p>

<p>Knicks star Carmelo Anthony, who forced a trade from Denver to NY last season, also made the list at number seven, just behind Metta World Peace, Kobe Bryant and Tony Parker. Humphries, who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120504163723/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/22/early_addition_949.php">was booed</a> during his first preseason games this past week, seemed nonplussed about his ascendance to villain status: &#x201C;He doesn&#x2019;t blame Kim. This is all about playing basketball and he refuses to let the boos and hatred get to him,&#x201D; a source <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120504163723/http://www.hollywoodlife.com/2011/12/22/kris-humphries-booed-madison-square-garden-reaction/">told Hollywood Life.</a> Perhaps Humphries has begun practicing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120504163723/http://www.aoltv.com/2011/11/28/kris-humphries-freaks-out-over-naked-yoga-kourtney-kim-video/">some alternative methods to deal with those boos.</a></p>
