<p>So many subway etiquette situations stem from a basic disrespect for other people&apos;s space&#x2014;whether you&apos;re taking up a seat <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160315054724/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/15/etiquette.php">with a banana peel</a> or an antique table, like the person in the photo above. &quot;I saw this straphanger today on a crowded G train,&quot; Jeffrey Rodriguez told us. &quot;Many passengers were standing...I was amazed no one said anything!&quot; </p>

<p>You may be thinking to yourself, &quot;Well, where else was this person going to put their giant table?&quot; And it&apos;s a fair point: you obviously can&apos;t block the doors, and it&apos;d probably cause just as many problems (with circulation) by putting the table in the middle of the car. However, here&apos;s the rub: if you must transport such a large object via our communal mass transit system, then you need to accept the fact that you also must sacrifice <em>your</em> seat. </p>

<p>Every person has the right to a single seat on the subway&#x2014;so if your antique table is taking up one seat, then you&apos;ll just have to bite the bullet and stand up for the ride. When in doubt (or when taking up lots of space), just be chivalrous! It&apos;s a better way of living, as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160315054724/http://www.retronaut.com/2011/09/tokyo-subway-manner-posters-1976-1982/">Tokyo&apos;s classic subway manners posters</a> attest.</p>
