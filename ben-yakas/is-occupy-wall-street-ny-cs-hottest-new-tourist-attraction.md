(<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111030170811/http://www.flickr.com/photos/62159569@N08/6265552274/in/photostream/">scoboco&apos;s flickr</a></i></div> <p></p>

<p>Mayor Bloomberg performed a bit of verbal jujitsu this morning on his weekly radio broadcast&#x2014;he called the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111030170811/http://gothamist.com/tags/occupywallstreet">Occupy Wall Street</a> protests down in Zuccotti Park <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111030170811/http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/culture/2011/10/3832298/now-occupy-wall-street-attracting-tourists-says-bloomberg">&quot;a tourist attraction.&quot;</a> Just two weeks ago, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111030170811/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/08/old_man_bloomberg_tired_of_occupy_w.php">Bloomberg said on the same program that</a> protesters were &quot;trying to take away the tax base we have, because none of this is good for tourism&quot;&#x2014;despite the fact that tourists <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111030170811/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/03/occupy_wall_street_turning_zuccotti.php">have been flocking</a> to the park to see it in person (or join in). </p>

<p>Maybe this means Bloomberg thinks Zuccotti Park is becoming the seedy underbelly of NYC, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111030170811/http://twitter.com/#!/erickuo/status/127376612957224960">as Eric Kuo put it</a>: &quot;things can both be a tourist attraction and bad for tourism: porn shops in times square circa the 80s?&quot; We think Bloomberg&apos;s about-face might stem from a more poetic place&#x2014;it&apos;s just like Walt Whitman once wrote: &quot;Do I contradict myself? Very well then I&apos;ll just run for a fourth term and make it up to you because you people need me, do you even realize how much you need me?&quot;</p>

<p>Speaking of tourists, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111030170811/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/she_plans_to_stray_awhile_opuo0dDOjE39dfRDdUZ1sM#ixzz1bQBjpGUA">Post featured an out-of-towner today</a> who has decided to make Zuccotti Park her semi-permanent home&#x2014;and every graf in the story seems to scream &quot;BAD MOM&quot; reading between the lines. Mother-of-four Stacey Hessler left her banker husband and kids&#x2014;son Peyton, 17; and daughters Kennedy 15, Sullivan, 13, and Veda, 7&#x2014;in Florida to come support OWS here, and is pretty intense about sticking around: &quot;I&#x2019;m not planning on going home...&#x201C;I have no idea what the future holds, but I&#x2019;m here indefinitely. Forever,&quot; she said. </p>

<p>The Post seems to get off on what they call her &quot;obsession&quot; with OWS: &#x201C;Military people leave their families all the time, so why should I feel bad?&#x201D; a defiant Hessler told them. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m fighting for a better world.&#x201D; They are particularly interested in the details about her relationship with her family, like the fact she&apos;s only spoken with them three times in the 12 days since she arrived in NYC and got dreadlocks: &#x201C;[My husband] says he&#x2019;s working for &#x2018;the Man,&#x2019; and I&#x2019;m fighting against him...My mother told me I was being very selfish.&quot;</p>
