<p>This month, Diet Coke unveiled its latest campaign to get you <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426180209/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-2564659/Diet-coke-addict-drinks-FIFTY-cans-day-spent-150-000-fizzy-drink-habit.html">hopelessly addicted</a> to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426180209/http://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/2013/08/10/america-diet-soda-addiction-health-hazard-can/v5TscM41c9NvboXtkhdCnI/story.html">sugary garbage.</a> In San Francisco, the ads <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426180209/http://sfist.com/2014/02/27/diet_coke_ads_target_sf_techies.php">have been marketed toward the niche tech sect</a>, while here in NYC they seem focused on the kind of people who say things like, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426180209/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/02/nyregion/brooklyn-communal-cool-the-brand.html">&quot;for our generation of artists, we realize that we are each our own brand.&quot;</a> But maybe it wasn&apos;t the best idea to craft an ad campaign design that unsubtly nods toward cocaine addiction, as everyone who has seen the ads has noticed.</p>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>&quot;You&apos;re on coke.&quot; Huh. Really?

<p>Obviously the campaign isn&apos;t &quot;You&apos;re On Coke.&quot; Technically speaking, it&apos;s <strong>&quot;You&apos;re On. Diet Coke.&quot;</strong> As Stuart Kronauge, general manager for sparkling beverages at Coca-Cola North America, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426180209/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/10/business/media/news-from-the-advertising-industry.html">explained to the Times</a>, the campaign &quot;presents Diet Coke helping Taylor Swift and other millennial women and men by providing an energetic &apos;uplift for those moments when you really need to be on.&apos;&quot; For the Swift TV ad, they switch the phrase around to emphasize, &quot;Diet Coke, You&apos;re On.&quot;</p>

<p>But for everyone looking at the printed ad from any distance, the stand-out words are YOU&apos;RE ON COKE. And there&apos;s little doubt that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426180209/http://droga5.com/">Droga5, New York</a>, who created the campaign, didn&apos;t realize this and giggle to themselves about how clever it was.</p>

<p>If Diet Coke is looking for some new ideas to continue expanding the ads, there&apos;s plenty of material to work with.</p>
