Naief Al-mateiry&apos;s defense lawyer Henry Asbill told jurors at Manhattan Supreme Court this morning that the encounter between Al-mateiry and the unnamed 69-year-old UWS man was <strong>&quot;rough sex for money between two consenting adults who both may have had a little too much to drink.&quot; </strong><p></p>

<p>The two men met at an Upper East Side piano bar, Townhouse, in February 2009; Al-mateiry claims he is a gay gigolo, and at the time told the older man that &quot;he&apos;d like him to be his daddy-o,&quot; to which he replied, <strong>&quot;Well, I&apos;ll be your daddy, but I won&apos;t be your sugar daddy.&quot;</strong> According to the prosecution, the rendezvous transformed into a harrowing kidnapping, which included Al-mateiry beating the UWS man with a broken hanger and sodomizing him with a three-foot-long shoe-horn. The defense claims any violence was &quot;consensual, routine S&amp;M;,&quot; and called the victim, a separated married man, a liar. </p>

<p>Prosecutor Maxine Rosenthal also told jurors that they will hear a phone call confession by Al-mateiry, according to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422170209/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2010/04/13/2010-04-13_saudi_man_accused_of_raping_kidnapping_uws_man_tells_court_hey_im_just_a_gigolo.html">News.</a> The Post, with signature subtly, wonders whether the Saudi government, who had initially offered to pay for Al-mateiry&apos;s bail, &quot;is paying for his three-member, high-power Washington-based defense team.&quot;</p>
