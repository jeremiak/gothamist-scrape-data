<p>Everyone has heard of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131024004607/http://gothamist.com/tags/quietcar">quiet cars</a> (even if it&apos;s sometimes <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131024004607/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/10/nj_transit_quiet_does_not_mean_sile.php">hard to define</a> &quot;quiet&quot;), but what about conversation cars?  That&apos;s the question posed by a piece <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131024004607/http://www.nydailynews.com/opinions/2011/01/14/2011-01-14_lets_talk_stranger_why_our_subways_should_have_conversation_cars.html#ixzz1B2gCKYVg">in the News</a> today. The idea is to reclaim the lose art of conversation, and to disconnect ourselves from our iPods, iPads, smart phones and obsessive self-interest. &quot;What if, instead of treating your morning commute like a yoga retreat, you actually wanted to take a (wholesome, noncreepy) interest in one or two of the several thousand human beings around you. Where&apos;s the car for that? Where, on your bus or train, do you go for decent conversation?&quot; We like the idea of it, but we wonder if it would descend into something more akin to a &quot;pickup car&quot; for singles (not that this would necessarily be a bad thing). Would you ride in a conversation car?</p>
