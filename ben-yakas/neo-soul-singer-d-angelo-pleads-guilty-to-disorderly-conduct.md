But even though he hasn&apos;t released any new music, he&apos;s still had some time for extra-curricular activities. To that end, the singer appeared in Manhattan Criminal Court yesterday to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429124601/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2011/03/12/2011-03-12_dangelo_pleads_guilty_to_sex_rap.html">plead guilty</a> to disorderly conduct for asking an undercover cop for sex last year.</p>

<p>D&apos;Angelo <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429124601/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/07/dangelo_busted_asked_undercover_cop.php">was caught</a> &quot;cruising&quot; through the West Village last March, when he mistook an undercover cop for a prostitute and propositioned her for oral sex for $40. He <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429124601/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/angelo_takes_disorderly_conduct_geZSYPKUD2hZ4Vhq6llTYM?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">pleaded guilty</a> to a reduced charge of disorderly conduct, a violation that gets rid of the sex-solicitation charge and doesn&apos;t carry a criminal record or any penalties. </p>

<p>D&apos;Angelo has had several run-ins with the law in the past decade, largely involving his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429124601/http://www.spin.com/articles/dangelo-what-hell-happened">well-documented</a> drug habit. His legal and substance troubles have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429124601/http://www.newsweek.com/blogs/pop-vox/2009/07/23/d-angelo-is-alive-and-not-so-well-and-living-in-richmond.html">haunted him</a>, and prevented him from completing his in-work album, tentatively titled <em>James River</em>, which supposedly will contain collaborations with the likes of Prince, John Mayer, Cee-Lo Green, and Raphael Saadiq. Below, you can check out the famous video for his single &quot;Untitled (How Does It Feel)&quot;, aka the shirtless song:</p>
