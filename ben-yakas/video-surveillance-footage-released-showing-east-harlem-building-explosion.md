<p>Earlier this week, two buildings in East Harlem exploded <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429160838/http://gothamist.com/tags/gasleak">due to a gas leak</a>, killing at least <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429160838/http://gothamist.com/2014/03/14/8_dead_harlem_explosion.php">eight people</a> and injuring dozens more. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429160838/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2014/03/14/cbs-2-exclusive-video-shows-east-harlem-blast-in-progress/">CBS has now released</a> surveillance footage of the explosion from the ground, taken from various security cameras mounted on buildings across the street from the scene at Park Avenue off 116th Street. </p>

<p>The FDNY and other officials are still at the scene sorting through the debris and trying to confirm what caused the explosion, but the National Transportation Safety Board is confident it was a gas leak. It turns out that the soil around the two building was soaked with high concentrations of natural gas; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429160838/http://nypost.com/2014/03/15/soil-around-blast-building-soaked-with-natural-gas/">Con Edison took soil samples</a> from about 50 spots around the area, which showed that the concentration of natural gas was between 5 and 20 percent. </p>

<p>&quot;Normally the soil in New York City, 18 to 24 inches below the ground, would have zero concentration of natural gas,&#x201D; NTSB member Robert Sumwalt said. &#x201C;The fact that in at least five of the holes, the concentration of gas was between 5 and 20 percent, that tells us that that&#x2019;s a pretty good concentration of gas in that area. That further leads to the hypothesis that this may well have been a natural gas leak.&#x201D;</p>

<p>If their hypothesis is confirmed, it&apos;ll be cold comfort to 32-year-old Corey Louire, the East Harlem resident who noticed the smell of gas the night before the explosion, and called Con Ed about it the morning of the explosion. &quot;I feel terrible for all those people that lost their lives. I never imagined anything like this could ever happen,&quot; Louire, who lives on the second floor of a building one door down from the scene, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429160838/http://nypost.com/2014/03/15/only-man-to-call-con-ed-before-blast-anguished-over-delay/">told the Post.</a></p>

<p>Louire and his fianc&#xE9; smelled the gas on Tuesday evening, and he tried investigating around the block before calling his super. &quot;We&#x2019;ve smelled gas before, and nothing ever happened,&#x201D; he said. &quot;I didn&#x2019;t want to make a call, and then it&#x2019;s just a false alarm.&quot; As he took kids to school Wednesday morning, he called his super, and then Con Ed to report the smell. He got through to Con Ed around 9:13 a.m., and they told him to leave his apartment; he was waiting in the lobby of his building for them to arrive when the explosion occurred down the block. &quot;I feel terrible for all those people that lost their lives. I never imagined anything like this could ever happen,&quot; he added.</p>
