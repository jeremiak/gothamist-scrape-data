<p>NASCAR driver Tony Stewart <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141022152442/http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/08/10/us/ap-us-tony-stewart-crash.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;version=HpHeadline&amp;module=second-column-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news&amp;_r=0">fatally struck another driver</a> during a race in upstate NY on Saturday. As you can see in the graphic video below, 20-year-old driver Kevin Ward Jr. exits his vehicle during the 25-lap race at Canandaigua Motorsports Park, and points at Stewart&apos;s car in an apparent attempt to confront him. Ward&apos;s car had crashed after a collision with Stewart one lap earlier. </p>

<p>Witness Tyler Graves, a sprint-car racer and friend of Ward&apos;s who was at the race,<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141022152442/http://www.sportingnews.com/nascar/story/2014-08-10/tony-stewart-sprint-car-hits-driver-fight-incident-trouble-investigation-new-york-watkins-glen-kevin-ward"> described to Sporting News</a> what he saw happened:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;Tony pinched him into the frontstretch wall, a racing thing,&quot; Graves said. &quot;The right rear tire went down, he spun on the exit of (Turn) 2. They threw the caution and everything was toned down. Kevin got out of his car. &#x2026; He was throwing his arms up all over the place at Tony for most of the corner.

<p>&quot;I know Tony could see him. I know how you can see out of these cars. When Tony got close to him, he hit the throttle. When you hit a throttle on a sprint car, the car sets sideways. It set sideways, the right rear tire hit Kevin, Kevin was sucked underneath and was stuck under it for a second or two and then it threw him about 50 yards.&quot;</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>Ontario County Sheriff Philip Povero told reporters that Stewart was &quot;visibly shaken&quot; after the collision and had been &quot;fully cooperative&quot; with investigators. &quot;This is right now being investigated as an on-track crash and I don&#x2019;t want to infer that there are criminal charges pending,&#x201D; Povero said. &#x201C;When the investigation is completed, we will sit down with the district attorney and review it. But I want to make it very clear: there are no criminal charges pending at this time.&quot;</p>

<p>A spokesman for Stewart, a three-time NASCAR Sprint Cup Champion, called the incident a &quot;tragic accident:&quot; &quot;Our thoughts and prayers go out to his family and friends,&#x201D; the spokesman said in a statement. &quot;We&#x2019;re still attempting to sort through all the details.&quot; However, Stewart&apos;s racing team manager Greg Zipadelli said Stewart will still race in NASCAR&apos;s event Sunday at Watkins Glen, calling the race &quot;business as usual.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: Upon further considering, Stewart&apos;s spokesmen <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141022152442/http://www.newsday.com/sports/motor-racing/tony-stewart-nascar-driver-hits-kills-driver-on-ny-track-1.9018144">announced this morning that</a> he will not race today, a day after he fatally struck another driver. According to Zipadelli, Stewart &quot;feels strongly&quot; he shouldn&apos;t participate in the event at Watkins Glen. </p>
