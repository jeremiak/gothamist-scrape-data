<p>Manhattan is a world in which the middle class is defined as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510022125/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/19/do_you_make_235000_congrats_youre_m.php">someone making $235K a year</a>. It&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510022125/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/16/video_hilarious_hypocrite_only_want.php">very special</a> indeed, especially for the few people left <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510022125/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/02/manhattan_apartments_scarce_for_the.php">who can afford property.</a> Artist and web researcher <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510022125/http://nickolaylamm.com/">Nickolay Lamm</a> decided to visualize the extent of wealth inequality in the neighborhoods of Manhattan <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510022125/http://www.mydeals.com/blog/what-if-you-could-see-inequality/post">with a series of 3D maps.</a></p>

<p>As for how the graph works: the data on income was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510022125/http://www.arcgis.com/home/webmap/viewer.html?useExisting=1&amp;services=814b785f25e24c9d8fc1a61ea61c0462">collected from ArcGIS</a>. If one neighborhood has a net worth of $500K, then the height of the 3D bar was 5 cm. If the neighborhood has a net worth around $50K, it would be .5 cm. &quot;I thought to myself, what if you could actually see inequality? This relatively even landscape would look much different,&quot; he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510022125/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2396495/Where-wealthiest-citizens-New-York-live-The-3D-map-shows-vast-income-difference-neighborhoods.html">told the Daily Mail</a>.</p>

<p>A few years ago, graphic designer Kelli Anderson <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510022125/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/20/neat_map_illustrates_wealth_inequit.php">produced a slightly different map</a> illustrating income inequity using data culled from the Wall Street Journal. &quot;The American Dream suggests that if you work hard enough, you can achieve it,&quot; he added. &quot;However, it&apos;s clear that the landscape in order to achieve that dream is not as even and equal as it appears on the surface.&quot; Check out <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510022125/http://www.mydeals.com/blog/what-if-you-could-see-inequality/post">more graphs here.</a></p>
