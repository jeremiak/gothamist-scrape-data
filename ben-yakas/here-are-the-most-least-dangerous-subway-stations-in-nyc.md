<p>Let&apos;s break that down a bit:</p><ul><br>
	<li>There were nearly 48,000 felonies and misdemeanors recorded during this span.</li><br>
	<li>The most overall crime occurred at major hubs Times Square (1/2/3/7/N/Q/R/S/A/C/E), 125th Street (4/5/6) and Union Square (L/N/Q/R/4/5/6). The highest crime rates (per 100K trips) were at Broad Channel (A/S), Broadway Junction (A/C/J/Z/L), and Beach 105th Street (A/S). </li><br>
	<li>The least amount of overall crime occurred at Aqueduct Racetrack (A), 77th Street (R), and Hunters Point Avenue (7). The lowest crime rates (per 100K rides) were at Wall Street (2/3), Wall Street (4/5), and 77th Street (R).</li><br>
	<li>Times Square and Union Square were, unsurprisingly, among the top three in all major crimes (property crimes, violent crimes, weapons possession, misdemeanor sex crimes and drug crimes).</li><br>
	<li>Grand Central (S/4/5/6/7) had the most misdemeanor sex crimes.</li><br>
	<li>Annual number of crimes decreased 12% from 2009 to 2012; coupled with increased ridership, the crime rate decreased by more than 16%.</li><br>
	<li>The most reported subway crime was larceny (about 13,000 instances); that&apos;s followed by weapons possession (5,361), assault (4,379) and robbery (3,756).</li><br>
	<li>Nearly 70% of all robberies involved physical force or a threat of physical force.</li><br>
	<li>Nearly 40% of all crime was recorded during the hours between 11 a.m. and 5 p.m. That includes the primetime of 3-4 p.m., when teens are getting out of school; there were 4,668 incidents recorded during that hour alone.</li><br>
	<li>Straphangers are least likely to be the victim of a crime during the morning rush hour and most likely very late at night, with the highest rate between 2 a.m. and 4 a.m. (6 crimes per 100K riders)</li><br>
</ul><p></p>
