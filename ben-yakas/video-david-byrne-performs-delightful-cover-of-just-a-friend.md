<p>Last night, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150103063519/http://gothamist.com/tags/davidbyrne">David Byrne</a> headlined a concert at Le Poisson Rouge for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150103063519/http://contentcreatorscoalition.org/">Content Creators Coalition</a>, a &quot;group of artists, creators, and interested people&quot; trying to raise awareness of and support for a radio performance royalty (more specifically, they&apos;re against how US stations screw performers out of radio royalties). To prove their point, Byrne and other musicians (including REM&apos;s Mike Mills, Cake&apos;s John McCrean, Tiff Merritt, and more) covered songs that were popularized by artists who were not the writers (see: Whitney Houston never got a royalty anytime &quot;I Will Always Love You&quot; played on the radio), which culminated in this gem of a performance of Biz Markie&apos;s &quot;Just A Friend.&quot;</p>

<p>Last fall, Byrne railed against online streaming services such as Pandora and Spotify <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150103063519/http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/oct/11/david-byrne-internet-content-world">in an article for The Guardian</a>, and he also plugged CCC as &quot;an entity that speaks out on artists&apos; behalf.&quot;</p>
