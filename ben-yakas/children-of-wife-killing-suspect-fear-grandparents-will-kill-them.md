And worse, they are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130911032310/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2011/10/04/2011-10-04_we_fear_grandpa_will_kill_us_cry_kids_of_slain_mom.html?r=news%">allegedly terrified of the grandparents</a> who they have been staying with.  When asked by a cousin to play, five-year-old Riyan Parvaiz responded: &quot;<strong>If I leave my seat they will kill me the way they killed my mother,</strong>&quot; lawyer Freda Khan recounted in Brooklyn Family Court.<p></p>

<p>Riyan and his two-year-old brother, Shayaan, have been staying with their paternal grandparents since the killing of their mother, Nazish Noorani. The children&apos;s father, Kashif Parvaiz, has been charged with arranging for his mistress, Antoinette Stephen, to murder his wife by shooting her in broad daylight while the couple strolled on a suburban NJ street. Prosecutors <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130911032310/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/23/bail_for_sociopathic_wife-killing_s.php">have called Parvaiz</a> &quot;sociopathic&quot; and &quot;narcissistic,&quot; while Stephen <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130911032310/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/04/woman_accused_of_killing_nj_mom_den.php">has denied</a> her involvement in the murder.</p>

<p>Parvaiz&apos;s parents have filed for permanent custody of the children, but the arrangement is being challenged by their mother&apos;s parents, who live in Flatbush, and who are the ones alleging the children are scared of their paternal grandparents. Noorani&apos;s parents added that they have only seen the kids once since their daughter&apos;s murder and the children seemed &quot;extra withdrawn and very fearful.&quot;</p>
