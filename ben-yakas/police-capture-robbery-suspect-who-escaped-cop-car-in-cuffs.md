<p>The robbery suspect <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602120047/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/26/robbery_suspect_makes_dramatic_esca.php">who made a dramatic escape</a> from the back of a cop car has been caught. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602120047/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/11/26/woman-who-escaped-from-police-car-in-handcuffs-is-recaptured/">According to the Times</a>, Janine Power, 28, of Brooklyn, was recaptured Saturday afternoon at a gas station on Coney Island Avenue and Avenue P with alleged accomplice Anthony D&apos;Angelo, 41, of Staten Island. She wasn&apos;t wearing her handcuffs anymore: &#x201C;How can you escape wearing cuffs? Once they put you inside the car, how can you get out?&#x201D; asked Abdul Rehman, the weekend attendant at the gas station where the suspects were caught. &#x201C;She must be a genie or something.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Power, who had a prior brush with the law for the sale and possession of illegal drugs, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602120047/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/brooklyn-escaped-prisoner-janine-power-escaped-cop-car-134527538.html">had been arrested</a> on Thursday afternoon after allegedly robbing a cab driver of $30 and his cell phone. She was being transported from the 60th Precinct to central booking in downtown Brooklyn when <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602120047/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/cops-hunt-thanksgiving-thief-fled-car-cuffs-article-1.982978">she managed to pry open the door</a> to the police car at the intersection of Stillwell and Neptune Avenues. She fled the car in handcuffs&#x2014;another prisoner in the backseat did not. &#x201C;They don&#x2019;t know how she got out of the car,&#x201D; said Detective Brian Sessa, a police spokesman.</p>

<p>She was allegedly aided by D&apos;Angelo; according to the Times, witnesses identified  D&#x2019;Angelo and Power as having stolen a 1996 Buick early Saturday. Police tracked the two around Coney Island and were able to capture them easily. D&#x2019;Angelo is being charged with grand larceny, criminal possession of stolen property, hindering prosecution and obstructing governmental administration. Power is also being charged with grand larceny, as well as escape. &#x201C;You can&#x2019;t just escape and nothing happens to you,&#x201D; Detective Sessa said. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s illegal to escape.&#x201D;</p>
