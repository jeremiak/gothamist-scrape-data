<p>The folks over at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428172451/http://www.youtube.com/user/BadLipReading?feature=watch">Bad Lip Reading</a> have produced a lot of good internet content, but this absolutely hilarious <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428172451/http://gothamist.com/tags/gameofthrones"><em>Game Of Thrones</em></a>-inspired video may truly be their best work yet. They describe the premise of the film <em>Medieval Land Fun-Time World</em>: &quot;Theme park manager Eddie Stark has one week to whip his lackluster group of employees into shape before the park&apos;s grand opening.&quot; </p>

<p>You&apos;ll be confronted with a lot of important questions along the way: should they make iPhones for babies? Are you a fan of the Pikachu? How do you feel about people who go hot doggin&apos;? And what happens when you eat kitten meat?</p>
