The incident happened around 7:20 a.m. Sunday, about 100 feet north of the Spuyten Duyvil station. Many passengers noted that the train was traveling &#x201C;a lot faster&#x201D; than normal when it hit a curve before the station. But the train&apos;s operator, William Rockefeller, told investigators that the brakes didn&apos;t work when he neared the curve.</p>

<p>According <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140210112020/http://nypost.com/2013/12/01/derailed-train-operator-brakes-didnt-work/">to the Post</a>, Rockefeller, 46, has worked for Metro-North for 20 years and has never been involved in an accident before. &#x201C;He&#x2019;s one of the better engineers, the most dependable. And he really does like trains,&#x201D; his father, William Sr., told them. &#x201C;His wife called us just to let us know [he was involved]. We&#x2019;re doing as good as can be expected&#x2026;We&#x2019;re holding up.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Gov. Cuomo said this morning that there were no signs of terrorism or criminal conduct, but noted that investigators, including the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) and the FBI, will explore whether speed or the brakes were to blame for the crash. &quot;The black box will say what the speed was, whether or not the brakes were applied before the emergency brakes &#x2014; there&apos;s an emergency brake on that turn &#x2014; went off, or if [those] went off,&quot; he said. Westchester County Executive Robert Astorino also said that NTSB investigators would examine &#x201C;the track itself to see if it was stable.&#x201D;</p>

<p>More than 100 people were aboard the 5:54 a.m. train out of Poughkeepsie, which was due to arrive at Grand Central Station at 7:43 a.m.&#x2014;the train was never going to stop at the Spuyten Duyvil station. Seven cars, including the locomotive, were all knocked off of the tracks. Passenger Frank Tatulli told ABC that it was traveling &#x201C;a lot faster&#x201D; than it normally does. Commuter Dianna Jackson, who was flung six feet upon impact, told the News, &quot;The driver was going around the curve really fast. Next thing you know (we&apos;re) in middle of wreckage.&#x201D;</p>

There was a derailment of a 24-car freight train carrying garbage <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140210112020/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/19/metro-norths_hudson_line_service_su.php#photo-1">south of the Spuyten Duyvil station last July</a>, but officials note these scenarios are very different and completely &quot;unrelated.&quot; There was also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140210112020/http://nypost.com/2013/12/01/spuyten-duyvil-curve-has-a-deadly-history/">a massive train collision</a> at the same location in 1882 which led to the death of State Senator Webster Wagner.</p>

<p>One of the assistant conductors of the train, Maria Herbert, was treated for head, shoulder and rib injuries. &#x201C;You can&#x2019;t just be a regular dummy on the street to have that job,&#x201D; her husband William <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140210112020/http://www.metro.us/newyork/news/local/2013/12/01/bronx-train-derailment-metro-north/">told Metro</a> at New York-Presbyterian Hospital. William <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140210112020/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-bound-metro-north-passenger-train-derails-bronx-article-1.1533963">told the News</a> he blamed the MTA for the incident, saying the agency has cut corners when it comes to safety. &#x201C;The MTA is not the greatest organization,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s all about the money. It&#x2019;s save money first and safety second.&#x201D;</p>

<p>It&apos;s unclear when Metro-North service will resume for the line. &quot;I think it&apos;s safe to say that tomorrow, people who use this line should plan on a long commute, or use the Harlem line,&quot; Cuomo said during a press conference this afternoon. The NTSB head added that they will investigate both maintenance and personnel records, interview the train crew in the next day or two, and they anticipate being on scene for the next 10-12 days.</p>

<p>Cuomo was adamant that the problem isn&apos;t just the curve before the station: &quot;The curve has been here for many many years, trains take the curve everyday...If there&apos;s a change that the MTA can make, then great. It can&apos;t just be the curb.&quot;</p>
