<p>On Friday, it was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170321021159/http://gothamist.com/2010/12/03/brooklyn_rabbi_and_sons_accused_of.php">reported</a> that a Brooklyn Rabbi and three of his sons were suspected of sexually abusing four female relatives. One of those sons, Yechezkel Kranczer, 24, was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170321021159/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/12/04/2010-12-04_rabbis_son_accused_of_sexual_abuse_ordered_to_stay_away_from_underage_victims.html">arraigned on charges</a> of sexual abuse and endangering the welfare of a child in Brooklyn Criminal Court yesterday.</p>

<p>His passport was taken away, but he was let go on a $10,000 bail. Rabbi Kranczer and his 21-year-old legally-blind son Asher fled to Israel on Monday night, and police are currently coordinating with Israeli police to track him down. <strong>&quot;This family...has been engaged in a horrific pattern of sexual abuse,</strong>&quot; said Assistant District Attorney John Holmes. Kraczer, his father Rabbi Kranczer, and two other brothers are accused of abusing four relatives, now aged 20, 19, 17 and 8, for years. It&apos;s unclear what the familial relationship was between the men and women, but Rabbi Kranczer is married to his first cousin; police raided their Midwood home, where they raised 14 children together, and which police believe was the site of many of the sexual attacks.</p>
