<p>The NYPD officer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509002050/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/25/fbi_arrests_nypd_officer_for_attemp.php#photo-1">who was arrested Thursday</a> for allegedly attempting to &quot;kidnap women and cook them&quot; was denied bail during his hearing in Manhattan Criminal Court yesterday. Gilberto Valle, a 28-year-old married six-year veteran of the NYPD, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509002050/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/25/photos_cannibal_cop_called_himself.php#photo-1">has been charged with</a> conspiracy to kidnap and accessing a computer without authorization, for which he faces up to life in prison. It&apos;s now been revealed <em>how</em> Valle was caught: his estranged wife, Kathleen Cooke Mangan, discovered his &#x201C;tactical plan,&#x201D; which he called his blueprint for &#x201C;Abducting and Cooking,&#x201D; on his computer last month: <strong>&quot;When she saw what was on the computer, what he was into, she literally ran out of the house with just the clothes on her back,&quot;</strong> a law-enforcement source <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509002050/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/nypd_stew_women_cannibal_cop_plots_Lh3CnedXJxReJ9UGYf1vSJ">told the Post.</a></p>

<p>Mangam contacted the FBI about the &#x201C;weird stuff&#x201D; she found on his computer (including the names, photos, dates of birth, heights, weights and bra sizes of dozens of women), then immediately left the state with the couple&#x2019;s year-old baby daughter. &#x201C;I was thinking of tying her body onto some kind of apparatus,&#x201D; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509002050/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/mind-accused-cannibal-article-1.1192701">he allegedly wrote to</a> a co-conspirator in one of many email and IM conversations. &#x201C;Cook her over a low heat, keep her alive as long as possible.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Public defender Julia Gatto <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509002050/http://www.timesunion.com/news/crime/article/NYC-officer-detained-in-ghoulish-kidnap-plot-3982421.php#photo-3644272">initially argued for bail</a>, saying the Valle was only guilty of a &quot;deviant fantasy.&quot; &quot;There&apos;s no actual crossing the line from fantasy to reality,&quot; Gatto said. &quot;At worst this is someone who has sexual fantasies about people he knows and he talks about it on the Internet.&quot; But Assistant U.S. Attorney Hadassa Waxman pointed out that he was  too close to carrying out the &quot;grotesque and disturbing&quot; plots: &quot;[He had] plans to kidnap, rape, torture, kill and eat the body parts of young women, some of whom the FBI has identified and they acknowledge knowing the defendant for a period of time,&quot; she said.</p>

<p>Valle, who attended Archbishop Molloy High School in Queens and then studied psychology, criminology and criminal justice at the University of Maryland, joined the police force in 2006. His younger brother denied the charges and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509002050/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/fbi-arrests-nypd-article-1.1191956">defended him to reporters</a>: &#x201C;He&#x2019;s a nice guy,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m upset.&#x201D; Neighbors were in shock still as well: &#x201C;That&#x2019;s absolutely horrifying,&#x201D; said David Rosenblatt. &#x201C;I never heard of anyone doing that, let alone in this building. This is supposed to be one of the nicer areas of Queens.&#x201D;</p>

<p>You can take a look <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509002050/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/25/photos_cannibal_cop_called_himself.php#photo-1">through Valle&apos;s OKCupid profile here</a>, in which he seemed to have an obsession with food (that extended to a creepy explanation of why <em>Green Eggs And Ham</em> is his favorite book), and how he views himself: &quot;I also consider myself a true gentleman, and chivalry is huge with me (yes, I will open doors and pull out chairs for you).&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509002050/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20121025/new-york-city/cannibal-cops-wedding-registry-featured-baking-pans-oven-mitts">DNAInfo also dug up</a> his wedding registry from earlier this year, which included lots of baking pans and oven mitts.</p>
