<p><strong>[Important Nothing Is Really Real Is It? Update Below]</strong> After seeing one too many <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420083246/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/18/video_subway_spaghetti_spat_sparks.php">subway spaghetti slap fights</a>, we generally believe that eating on the subway is a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420083246/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/27/food_fight_state_senators_want_to_o.php">bad idea</a> and just poor subway etiquette (unless you want to share a pizza pie with your fellow straphangers). <em>Having said that</em>, if you&apos;re going to eat on the subway, you might as well go all out and start shucking oysters, right? That&apos;s just what the man in the video below apparently decided to do on the N train. </p>

<p>&quot;NYC is gross,&quot; writes the uploader. Clearly this person hasn&apos;t seen people <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420083246/http://gothamist.com/2014/02/20/photo_popping_zits_subway.php">popping each other&apos;s pimples</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420083246/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/28/memorable_photo_sleepy_man_hangs_br.php">hanging brain</a>. We also are hoping that this shuckster isn&apos;t just part of some stupid viral marketing&#x2014;although even if it is, he&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420083246/http://safeoysters.org/fishermen/">risking life and limb</a> doing so. </p>

<p>Next time you&apos;re thinking about shucking in public, do remember to bring <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420083246/http://gothamist.com/2014/03/21/masterful_subway_eating.php">a classy tray table.</a></p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Because nothing can just be what it is&#x2014;and because nobody can do anything in public that isn&apos;t some stunt or call for attention&#x2014;sources tell us the video is (surprise!) a &quot;prank,&quot; and the guys shucking are actually BuzzFeed employees. Which makes this video a huge BuzzBummer and BuzzKill.</p>

<p>Maybe this was for BuzzFeed Videos, or maybe these guys really did just decide to go shucking underground for themselves. Either way, they are certainly no <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420083246/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/11/subway_cheese.php">Brie-Eating Connoisseur</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420083246/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/08/photo_this_woman_is_all_of_us.php">Barefoot Beer-Drinking Mama.</a></p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: A BuzzFeed source tells us that the employee in the video is &quot;a creative who works on the ad side.&quot; But BuzzFeed spokesperson Ashley McCollum adds that this shucking project wasn&apos;t for them: <strong>&quot;The oyster shucking was not a part of any BuzzFeed official or unofficial project. Just good ol&apos; internet fun, it seems.&quot;</strong> </p>

<p>We&apos;re still feeling a bit burned by the (clearly) staged video, so we&apos;ll point out that just because it isn&apos;t a BuzzFeed video doesn&apos;t mean it&apos;s not a project for some other ad campaign. It&apos;s just like Oasis once said: don&apos;t believe the truth! Especially if you&apos;re slowly walking down the hall faster than a cannonball, which, <em>really</em>, doesn&apos;t make any sense. But neither does this video! </p>
