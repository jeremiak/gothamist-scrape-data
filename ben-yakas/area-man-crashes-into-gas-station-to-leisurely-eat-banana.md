<p>A man who apparently has a passionate love for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140214033944/http://kimberlysnyder.net/blog/2012/12/29/bananas-natures-most-perfect-food/">nature&apos;s most perfect food</a> crashed his car multiple times into a Connecticut gas station this week in order to get a single solitary banana and leisurely eat it. As anyone with an internet connection circa 2002 knows, a man&apos;s got to do what a man&apos;s got to do when it&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140214033944/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8MDNFaGfT4">peanut butter jelly time</a>.</p>

They say the suspect repeatedly rammed his station wagon into the building, breaking through the glass. Then the driver got out, took a banana off a shelf, peeled it and ate it. &quot;He didn&apos;t appear to be in any rush,&quot; said Sgt. Christopher J. Perry.</p>

<p>No other items were stolen from the store during the break-in. Police are still searching for the banana bandit. Below, you can see an exclusive video of the suspect in action:</p>
