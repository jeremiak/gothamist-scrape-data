<p>The incident happened just before 4 a.m. Sunday morning as the 34-year-old woman was walking along 16th Street between 11th Avenue and Prospect Park Southwest. The man snuck up from behind, grabbed her and started to lift her dress up and pull at her underwear. He then threw her on the ground and punched her as he attempted to sexually assault her. </p>
