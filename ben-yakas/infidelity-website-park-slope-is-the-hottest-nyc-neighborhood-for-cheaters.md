<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140309153720/http://gothamist.com/tags/parkslope">Park Slope</a> is the kind of neighborhood where young men <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140309153720/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/02/check_out_this_book_of_1990s_sticke.php">accumulate ginormous sticker collections</a> and locals bicker passionately <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140309153720/http://gothamist.com/tags/parkslopecoop">over their precious food co-op</a>&#x2014;so it&apos;s completely understandable why a lot of residents would seek out some sort of action just to feel alive again, man. And it seems a significant number of locals have been pursuing extramarital affairs, according to the scummy website responsible for arranging those very meetups!</p>

Park Slope came in first with 10 percent of their clients; Gramercy Park and Tribeca followed with 9.7 and 9.3 respectively. </p>

<p>Ashley Madison has mastered the art of infidelity trolling: they know that if your husband is having a lot of steak dinners in Midtown, he&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140309153720/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/25/cheating_spouses_really_prefer_to_e.php">definitely having an affair</a>, and that Mother&apos;s Day is the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140309153720/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/17/wanna_have_an_affair_try_chelsea_th.php">best day of the year to cheat</a>. But hey, who are we to judge&#x2014;all we have planned for tonight is a romantic dinner for one <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140309153720/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/29/white_castle.php">at the most erotic joint in town.</a></p>
