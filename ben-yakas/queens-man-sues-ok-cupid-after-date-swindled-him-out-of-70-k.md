<p>A Queens man <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510032256/http://nypost.com/2014/03/18/man-sues-okcupid-after-date-swindles-him-for-7k/">is suing OKCupid</a> after he was swindled out of $70K by a man he met on the dating website. Michael Picciano, 65, says in his lawsuit that OKCupid and parent company IAC failed to conduct &quot;even minimal screening of its subscribers and therefore deceptively creating the impression that their dating service was safe...when in fact...[it] was a trap for the unwary.&quot; Picciano believes that it&apos;s OKCupid&apos;s fault that he willingly handed over tens of thousands of dollars to a stranger. To paraphrase Raylan Givens, Picciano seems like the type of fella that walks under a flock of birds and is surprised when he ends up with shit on his face.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510032256/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/man-gave-70-000-man-met-okcupid-article-1.1725706">Picciano said he connected with</a> a man who said he was named Bruce Thompson in February 2013, and he started messaging him because he &quot;felt safe and trusted the profile&quot; due to OKCupid billing itself as &quot;the best free dating site on Earth,&quot; despite the fact that it IS a free dating site open to anyone with an email address.  </p>

<p>After 10 days of messaging on OKCupid, they started emailing and calling; by the end of March, the Texas-native Thompson was asking him for money for a new computer parts business. And less than two months after meeting a stranger on the Internet (and never in person), Picciano agreed to send him $24,000...and then he transferred even more money to different names (&quot;Dennis E. Racer&quot; in Addison, Texas, and an &quot;Edmond Thebeau&quot; in Canada) per Thompson&apos;s request, until the total charges came to $70,460. </p>

<p>At this point, Picciano finally realized he was being played, and went to police; so far, they haven&apos;t been able to track Thompson down. Picciano believes he is still on OKCupid trolling for victim under the name &quot;bigheartedbt&quot; (his previous screen name was &quot;genuine&#xAD;guy62&quot;). Looking through <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510032256/http://www.okcupid.com/legal/terms">OKCupid&apos;s terms and conditions</a>, it doesn&apos;t seem as if OKCupid would be liable for what happens <em>after</em> someone uses their website, which is one of those things the vast majority of users inherently understand. After all, you really never know <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510032256/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/25/photos_cannibal_cop_called_himself.php#photo-1">who you could be talking to on a free dating website.</a></p>
