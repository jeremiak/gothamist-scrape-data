                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="32210ticket.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20131112020755im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/32210ticket.jpg" width="230" height="178" class="image-left"> </span>This week marks the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131112020755/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/21/parking_grace_period_begins_today.php">start</a> of the 5-minute grace period on muni meters, and in the aftermath of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131112020755/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/13/some_taxi_drivers_scammed_fares_out.php">taxi scandal</a> and the unrelenting nature of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131112020755/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/15/subway_douchery.php">subway douchery</a> , some New Yorkers might be thinking of getting their cars out of storage early this year. However, since Mayor Bloomberg took office there&#x2019;s been a 45 percent increase in traffic-enforcement agents and a 64 percent spike in parking fees, so you&apos;re likely to run into one while visiting your grandparents <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131112020755/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/22/ues.php">at their retirement home.</a> Thankfully, there are some easy ways to avoid lovely Rita&apos;s wrath. </p>

<p>NY mag has some <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131112020755/http://nymag.com/guides/parking-tickets/64928/">helpful hints</a> in this week&apos;s issue on beating the orange ticket, including <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131112020755/http://nymag.com/guides/parking-tickets/64927/">iPhone apps</a> to guide you to busted meters, an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131112020755/http://nymag.com/guides/parking-tickets/64926/">interview</a> with a meter maid (don&apos;t bother leaving a note on the dash), and tips on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131112020755/http://nymag.com/guides/parking-tickets/64917/">appealing</a> tickets. To summarize: look for any errors on the tickets, always plead &quot;not guilty&quot; (and you&apos;ll likely get reduced ticket), and if you think the meter maid made a mistake, get proof (i.e., take a picture of that broken meter).</p>
