										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="92813train.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231070931im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/92813train.jpg" width="640" height="480"> <br> <i> &quot;This is what it&apos;s like to be stuck standing on a crowded derailed F train for NEARLY TWO HOURS. Goodbye, Friday night. We&apos;re done.&quot; (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231070931/http://instagram.com/p/eyTSgDEVUO/">Gatsdee</a>)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>Most New Yorkers would agree that there&apos;s no better way to cap off a long work week than being trapped on a subway for hours with hundreds of other straphangers. So approximately 1,300 commuters are probably counting their lucky stars after they got stuck on the F train for over two hours last night in Manhattan. According to the MTA, a southbound F train ran over a broken rail south of the West 4th Street station around 7:10 p.m.; the train didn&apos;t derail, but it couldn&apos;t move anywhere on the snapped track. And as you can see in the Tweets and Instagrams below, people were mighty pleased about the situation:</p>

<p>The MTA deployed a rescue train to pick up passengers and take them to the W. 4th Street Station, but they claim between 700-800 refused to take it. Some commuters disputed this claim. &#x201C;We were told that there was a rescue train, but it left without us,&#x201D; Kate Vance, who was in the second car, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231070931/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/f-train-halt-due-snapped-track-article-1.1470240">told the News</a>. &#x201C;It was too crowded.&#x201D;</p>
