Leyritz was found guilty of a lesser misdemeanor DUI charge, for which he faces six months in prison. On Dec. 28, 2007, after celebrating his birthday club-hopping in Fort Lauderdale, FL, Leyritz was in a car crash with 30-year-old Ann Veitch. Blood alcohol tests showed that both Veitch and Leyritz, who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412164901/http://gothamist.com/2008/11/16/exyank_leyritz_denies_full_culpabil.php">denied responsibility</a> for the crash back in 2008, were under the influence. Leyritz settled the civil suit earlier this year, and will pay $1,000 a month for 100 months to Veitch&apos;s family.</p>
