<p>Forget <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150423234454/http://gothamist.com/tags/homelessness">homelessness</a>, forget <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150423234454/http://gothamist.com/tags/stopandfrisk">stop-and-frisk</a>, forget <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150423234454/http://gothamist.com/tags/incomedisparity">income disparity</a> and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150423234454/http://gothamist.com/tags/affordablehousing">lack of affordable housing.</a> The biggest crisis facing NYC on June 5th, 2013 is the scourge of adult kickball: <strong>&quot;I have lived in the neighborhood when there were gangs running around, heroin, but this is one of the most annoying, obnoxious things</strong>,&#x201D; Karen Gehres, a Lower East Side resident for more than 30 years, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150423234454/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20130605/lower-east-side/les-residents-launch-petition-boot-obnoxious-adult-kickball-league">told DNAInfo</a>. Adult kickball: it&apos;s worse than heroin! </p>

<p>Gehres, who has lived across from P.S. 142 for the last five years, is spearheading a campaign to shut down the adult <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150423234454/http://gothamist.com/tags/kickball">kickball</a> league that uses the school&apos;s courts at Delancey and Attorney Streets most weeknights and every Saturday. &quot;It is a very frat-house behavior,&quot; she said. &quot;I don&apos;t want to insult children and say it is childish &#x2014; these are adults screaming, trying to relive their youth or something.&quot;</p>

<p>Her husband explains that between the howling and the lights, the league has ruined their summer evenings: &quot;First, it started off two or three years ago with a few grown-ups playing,&quot; explained Gehres&apos; husband Phil Penman. &quot;Then, slowly it became stadium lighting, adults screaming their heads off, and it got later and later. Sometimes they play until 10 or 11 at night.&quot; The horror.</p>

<p>We spoke with Kevin Dailey, the commissioner of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150423234454/http://www.brooklynkickball.com/">Brooklyn Kickball</a>, who said that he had never had a noise complaint problem in his neck of the woods: &quot;There is nothing different about kickball from any other league in terms of noise. Regardless of whether people respect kickball as a sport or not, people are just trying to recreate.&quot; </p>

<p>Dailey did note that his league plays at night &quot;across the street from a dormant high school, where many fields buffer us from residents.&quot; But they seem to get along with other locals: &quot;<strong>Our league is successful because we haven&apos;t bothered anybody,</strong>&quot; Dailey concluded. &quot;This sounds like one of those, &apos;selfish drunken hipsters ruining the quality of life for everyone else,&apos; one of those BS stories.&quot;</p>

<p>None of which solves Gehre&apos;s problem: &quot;This goes on from the minute the weather is nice &#x2014; you can&apos;t open your windows or hear yourself think in your own apartment,&quot; she said, noting that she wants the league to move to East River Park, or somewhere not near her apartment. &quot;I didn&apos;t save for that long for somewhere I can&apos;t even open up the windows.&quot; </p>

<p>If you too believe in Gehres&apos; cause, she&apos;ll be presenting her argument to Community Board 3 on Thursday. Or if you don&apos;t want to be an incredulous party-pooper, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150423234454/http://worldofsolitaire.com/">you can always play Solitaire indoors.</a></p>
