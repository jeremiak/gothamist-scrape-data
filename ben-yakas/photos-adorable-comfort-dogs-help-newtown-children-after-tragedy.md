</div></div>					<p>Much of the discussion in recent days regarding the tragic <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160129054808/http://gothamist.com/tags/newtownshooting">Newtown shooting</a>&#x2014;which left 28 people dead, including 20 children&#x2014;has revolved around gun violence, and debates about stricter gun laws. But the children of Newtown are still trying to process what exactly happened last Friday morning&#x2014;and they&apos;re getting some help dealing with all those feelings from some much-needed comfort dogs. &quot;A parent will say, &apos;Thank you so much, I saw my child smile&#x2014;and they haven&apos;t smiled for days,&apos; &quot; Vida Johnston, director of operations for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160129054808/http://lutheranchurchcharities.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;layout=blog&amp;id=25&amp;Itemid=95">Lutheran Church Charities&apos;s K-9 Comfort Dogs</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160129054808/http://www.people.com/people/package/article/0,,20656736_20657586,00.html">told People</a>. &quot;The kids are telling the dogs about their own pets, they&apos;re [helping] them laugh, they&apos;re helping some of that burden drop off a bit. And the dogs just lay there, saying the more the merrier.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;At a high school school today the reaction was overwhelming,&quot; Johnson added. &quot;Dogs have the amazing ability to zero in on the person in front of them that has the greatest need. They can have six or seven people sitting there and they go to the one who has the loss. The dogs know; it&apos;s amazing to watch.&quot;</p>
