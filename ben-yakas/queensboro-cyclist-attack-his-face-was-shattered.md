<p>Cyclist Joel Custer is recovering at Cornell Hospital after he was attacked by a half-naked elderly man while biking over the Queensboro bridge <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412164145/http://gothamist.com/2010/11/12/naked_guy_attacks_cyclist_on_queens.php">yesterday morning</a>. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412164145/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/psycho_jumps_bridge_cyclist_OVGcI9UAyDv7pgO2TZSJfP">He lost</a> a few teeth and suffered a split lip and possibly a broken jaw that he underwent emergency surgery for yesterday. One reader painted a portrait of the scene which made it sound even worse than that:</p>

<blockquote>The cyclist was hurt extremely severely and almost killed.  His face was shattered, and he bled so much that he had to have a hole cut into his neck so he wouldn&apos;t asphyxiate on his own blood.  This is not funny--just a guy on his way to work.  Horrific.</blockquote>

<p>Custer was attacked, seemingly randomly, by 65-year-old Everett Gayle, who police <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412164145/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/psycho_jumps_bridge_cyclist_OVGcI9UAyDv7pgO2TZSJfP">described</a> as an &quot;emotionally disturbed person,&quot; and who was taken to Elmhurst Hospital for psychiatric evaluation, and will likely be charged with assault. Many cyclists have previously pointed to the vulnerability of the bike/pedestrian path of the bridge, but expressed shock that the attack happened during the day. Another reader wrote of their experience on the bridge:</p>

<blockquote>Somebody almost caught me by waiting in the shadows at the end of the twisty portion of the Manhattan Bridge on the Manhattan side last July - he was waiting in that spot which always gets that warm draft of subway air &amp; made a grab for my handlebar.

<p>It seems like an incredible lapse in security not to have (effective) surveillance on the bridge&apos;s bike paths, given that they&apos;ll close them for hours if they find so much as a discarded flashlight.</p></blockquote><p></p>
