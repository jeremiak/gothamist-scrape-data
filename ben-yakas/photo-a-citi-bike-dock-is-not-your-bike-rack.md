<p>We&apos;ve spotted plenty of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160405140617/http://gothamist.com/tags/citibike/1">Citi Bikes</a> in places they shouldn&apos;t be&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160405140617/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/22/photo_straphanger_takes_citi_bike_f.php">on the subway</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160405140617/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/18/ucb_and_citi_bike.php">at a comedy show</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160405140617/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/01/photo_the_strangest_place_to_find_a.php">hovering in the sky</a>&#x2014;but this is the first time we&apos;ve seen a regular bike wedged into a Citi Bike dock. &quot;Found a regular bike locked into one of the CitiBike racks on 16th and 5th, taking up space,&quot; says tipster Christian Arichabala. It&apos;s one thing to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160405140617/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/04/and_now_let_us_cover_the_citi_bikes.php">trash a docking station</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160405140617/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/18/vandal_smashes_citi_bike_docking_st.php">smash it in protest</a>, but this is just <em>rude</em>. </p>

<p>We strongly advise you leave Citi Bike stations for Citi Bikes, and count your lucky stars <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160405140617/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/15/vertically_challenged_murray_hill_r.php">you&apos;re tall enough to even ride one.</a> </p>
