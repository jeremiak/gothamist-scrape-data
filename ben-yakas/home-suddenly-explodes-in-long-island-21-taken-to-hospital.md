<p>A vacant home in Long Island <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629164047/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/house_explodes_in_li_tC9DlYQAsuTbMJ1NsTxQGJ">suddenly exploded</a> earlier this morning, blowing out the windows of neighboring homes and sending 21 people to the hospital. Police haven&apos;t been able to figure out exactly why the Brentwood home exploded, but nobody was killed in the accident. &quot;<strong>I was in bed and it felt like an earthquake. I thought a plane hit the house</strong>. All the shelves and windows in my house broke and collapsed. We were lucky we were sleeping or we would have been hurt badly,&quot; said Mushin Kiryaman, a neighbor who lives across the street.</p>

<p>Over 100 firefighters <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629164047/http://www.newsday.com/long-island/suffolk/explosion-levels-vacant-brentwood-home-1.2835860">responded to</a> the explosion, which occurred at around 10:45 a.m. this morning. It sent glass and debris flying all across the neighborhood, including sneakers and umbrellas which hung from nearby trees. Suffolk County police are investigating the circumstances of the explosion, and said it may have been caused by a ruptured gas line; they are also looking into the possibility that it may have been arson. According to neighbors, the couple who own the home, Donna and Heriberto Soto, had been renovating the unoccupied home, which was for sale.</p>

<p>Another neighbor told the Post: &quot;I was in my room getting ready for a family function when the house shook and I heard the explosion. The houses immediately around it had broken windows and shifted doors. My neighbor said the chandelier came crashing down in her house.&quot; </p>
