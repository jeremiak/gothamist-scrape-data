<p>Last year before starting their world tour behind <em>The King Of Limbs</em>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160503161420/http://gothamist.com/tags/radiohead">Radiohead</a> played two <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160503161420/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/29/radiohead_resurfaces_at_roseland_vi.php#photo-1">relatively intimate sets</a> at Roseland Ballroom in NYC, their first time performing in about three years (give or take a television appearance). A bunch of awesome Radiohead fans from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160503161420/http://www.ateaseweb.com/">Ateaseweb</a> have now compiled a multi-camera document of one of those complete gigs&#x2014;and the band even gave them a perfect sounding soundboard mix of the audio to use! You can watch/listen to the whole show below.</p>
