										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none" style=" width:640px; "> <img alt="22611mets.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20140319011459im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/22611mets.jpg" width="640" height="395"> <br> <i>(AP)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>Throughout this whole <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140319011459/http://gothamist.com/tags/mets">Madoff lawsuit mess</a>, which has overshadowed the Mets spring training thus far, CEO Fred Wilpon and COO Jeff Wilpon have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140319011459/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/16/wilpons_vow_not_to_give_up_controll.php">insisted</a> that their financial troubles would not affect the team in the least. Even as they&apos;ve sought to sell 20-25 percent of the club, they&apos;ve framed it as a anticipatory, shrewd move, not a desperate one. But it turns out that the Wilpons and MLB were fully aware of the Mets financial crisis as early as last fall, when MLB <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140319011459/http://sports.espn.go.com/new-york/mlb/news/story?id=6159722">gave the team</a> a $25 million loan.</p>

<p>&quot;We said in October that we expected to have a short-term liquidity issue. To address this, we did receive a loan from Major League Baseball in November. Beyond that, we will not discuss the matter any further,&quot; the team said <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140319011459/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/26/sports/baseball/26mets.html?_r=1&amp;ref=sports">in a statement</a>. MLB commissioner Bud Selig, a close friend of the Wilpons who directly advocated for Sandy Alderson to become the team&apos;s new general manager, personally signed off on the loan. In addition, more information was revealed this week showing just how close the team was to Madoff: according <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140319011459/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/21/sports/baseball/21wilpon.html">to the Times</a>, select people, including Larry King, were given the chance to invest with Madoff through Wilpon&apos;s company Sterling Equity. </p>

<p>One woman who did so explained that there were bizarre rules involved with it, and investors weren&apos;t allowed to contact Madoff directly: &#x201C;We never questioned the fact we weren&#x2019;t allowed to contact Madoff because of our confidence in Sterling. We invested because we trusted these two people absolutely; because they were big business and we assumed they knew what they were talking about,&#x201D; said the woman. </p>

<p>With this new information, it is abundantly clear just how dire the situation may be for the team, and how aware of it the Wilpons are. And despite a desire to retain a controlling interest in the team, the Wilpons have now <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140319011459/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/queens/mets_mil_bailout_Fu4xf6MgfDtVbJVfDqG30O?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">reportedly agreed</a> to sell up to 49 percent of the team, a marked change from their past statements.</p>
