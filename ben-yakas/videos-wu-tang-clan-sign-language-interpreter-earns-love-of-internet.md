<p>The best part of Mayor Bloomberg&apos;s many, many press conferences during <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130624075540/http://gothamist.com/tags/hurricanesandy">Hurricane Sandy</a> wasn&apos;t his Spanish recaps or Ray Kelly&apos;s turtleneck ensembles&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130624075540/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/30/bloombergs_sign_langauge_translator.php">it was Lydia Callis</a>, the American Sign Language translator who genuinely kept us engaged during Bloomberg&apos;s droll recaps. You wouldn&apos;t think you&apos;d need such a presence at a festival like this past weekend&apos;s Bonnaroo, especially not with dynamic performers such as the Wu-Tang Clan and R Kelly. And yet, the talk of the Internet this week is none other than mysterious <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130624075540/http://www.stereogum.com/1383081/the-9-best-things-at-bonnaroo-2013/top-stories/lead-story/attachment/holly-the-asl-translator-bonnaroo-2013/">ASL translator Holly</a>, whose joie de vivre stole the show, as you can see in the videos below.</p>

<p>In addition to the Wu-Tang and R Kelly sets, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130624075540/http://www.stereogum.com/1383081/the-9-best-things-at-bonnaroo-2013/top-stories/lead-story/attachment/holly-the-asl-translator-bonnaroo-2013/">Stereogum adds</a> that she &quot;didn&apos;t just sign every word, but put <em>back</em> into it. In fact, Matt &amp; Kim called her onstage during their set, and she was a game participant, satisfying Kim&apos;s request she demonstrate the signs for &apos;pussy,&apos; &apos;vagina&apos; (note: same sign!), and &apos;Bonnaroo.&apos;&quot; We only wish we could have seen her pull off the toot toots and beep beeps of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130624075540/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/23/where_were_you_when_you_first_heard.php">&quot;Ignition (Remix)&quot; in person.</a></p>
