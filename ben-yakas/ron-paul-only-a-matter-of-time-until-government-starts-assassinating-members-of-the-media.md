<p>Everyone&apos;s favorite <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160106131521/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/21/from_the_mailbag_america_loves_ron.php">Kantian epistemologist</a> Ron Paul is still unnerved by what he calls <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160106131521/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/30/ron_paul_criticizes_obama_for_assas.php">the American &quot;assassination&quot;</a> of the U.S.-born al Qaeda leader and terrorist recruiter Anwar al-Awlaki last week. Yesterday, Paul <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160106131521/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/2011/10/06/2011-10-06_ron_paul_government_could_begin_to_target_media_just_like_it_has_with_terrorist_.html">told an audience at</a> the National Press Club that citizens needed to protest the killing, or else the government may start eyeing new targets for assassination soon: &quot;Can you imagine being put on a list because you&apos;re a threat? What&apos;s going to happen when they come to the media? What if the media becomes a threat? Or a professor becomes a threat?...This is the way this works. It&apos;s incrementalism,&quot; he said.</p>

<p>&quot;It&apos;s slipping and sliding, let me tell you,&quot; he said. Al-Awlaki <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160106131521/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/30/american-born_al_qaeda_leader_anwar.php">was killed in Yemen</a> by a missile fired from an American drone aircraft; it was the first time since the Sept. 11 attacks that an American citizen had been deliberately targeted and killed by American forces. Also during his speech, Paul compared al-Awlaki, and Samir Kahn, another American-turned-al Qaeda operative killed in the attack, to Nazi war criminals. &quot;All the Nazi criminals were tried. They were taken to court and then executed. The reason we do this is because we want to protect the rule of law,&quot; said Paul. </p>

<p>Paul, who also announced that he had raised $8 million from supporters, said that Obama was to blame for the erosion of civil liberties, and called the &quot;assassination&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160106131521/http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2011/10/ron-paul-says-obama-has-committed-an-impeachable-offense/">an impeachable offense</a>: &quot;We have crossed that barrier from republic to dictatorship, to tyranny to empire.&quot;</p>

<p>Paul <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160106131521/http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20116242-503544.html">also showed solidarity</a> with the &quot;legitimate&quot; protesters of Occupy Wall Street: &quot;I think civil disobedience, if everyone knows what they&apos;re doing, is a legitimate effort. It&apos;s been done in this country for many grievances... The solution is to get a healthy economy back.&quot;</p>
