<p>A Pennsylvania man whose estranged wife allegedly attempted to castrate him survived a brush with life as a eunuch or worse thanks to his thick jeans. And if this story isn&apos;t already some incredibly ingenious viral marketing for Levi&apos;s new 501 Crotch Guard Formula Jeans, then we&apos;re off to the patent office. </p>

<p>Lisa Jones-Orock, 39, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140424132834/http://pittsburgh.cbslocal.com/2014/03/18/woman-charged-after-trying-to-cut-off-mans-penis-with-box-cutter/">allegedly attempted to cut off</a> Gerald Lee Orock Jr&apos;s penis with a box cutter during a fight at his Ellwood City home last week. Jones-Orock initially claimed that her husband had attacked her with a knife, but police soon discovered that the 56-year-old Orock Jr had cuts on the crotch area of his jeans, and defensive wounds on his left forearm and fingers.</p>

<p>&quot;His wounds appear defensive and he did state that Lisa was trying to cut his penis off,&quot; New Castle police Cpl. Steven Brooks <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140424132834/http://www.post-gazette.com/local/region/2014/03/18/Police-Wife-attempted-to-sever-husband-s-penis/stories/201403180174">wrote in the complaint</a>. Jones-Orock was already in jail on a separate outstanding bench warrant for a DUI when police realized that she was the alleged assailant in the incident.</p>

<p>Jones-Orock has been charged with aggravated assault, simple assault, possession of marijuana and harassment in the incident; her husband has been charged for violating a protection from abuse order Jones-Orock had previously taken out.  </p>
