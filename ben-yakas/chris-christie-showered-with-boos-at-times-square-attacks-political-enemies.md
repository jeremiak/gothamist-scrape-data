<p>As if <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503154627/http://gothamist.com/tags/chrischristie">Gov. Chris Christie&apos;s</a> week couldn&apos;t get any worse after a former top Port Authority official claimed that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503154627/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/31/port_authority_official_claims_chri.php">&quot;evidence exists&quot; proving Christie knew about the lane closings on the George Washington Bridge</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503154627/http://nypost.com/2014/02/01/christie-booed-jeered-at-times-square-super-bowl-kickoff-event/">he was booed</a> while appearing in Times Square for the Super Bowl Hand Off Saturday afternoon.</p>

<p>Also on Saturday, Christie sent out a 700-word email to allies titled, &#x201C;5 Things You Should Know About The Bombshell That&#x2019;s Not A Bombshell,&#x201D; in which he attacks accuser David Wildstein&apos;s character as well as the NY Times&apos; &quot;bombshell&quot; report: &quot;Bottom line&#x2014;David Wildstein will do and say anything to save David Wildstein,&quot; the email concludes. You can read it in full below.</p>

<p>An attorney for Wildstein, who is a high school friend of Christie&apos;s who resigned from the Port Authority in December as the scandal heated up, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503154627/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/31/port_authority_official_claims_chri.php">sent a letter</a> to the Port Authority on Friday stating that &#x201C;evidence exists &#x2026; tying Mr. Christie to having knowledge of the lane closures, during the period when the lanes were closed. contrary to what the Governor stated publicly in a two-hour press conference.&#x201D; Christie responded by citing &quot;sloppy reporting&quot; by the Times, then reverted to personal attacks on Wildstein: &quot;In David Wildstein&#x2019;s past, people and newspaper accounts have described him as &#x2018;tumultuous&#x2019; and someone who &#x2018;made moves that were not productive.&apos;&quot; He then went on to dredge up allegations from high school hoping to discredit him: &quot;He was publicly accused by his high school social studies teacher of deceptive behavior.&quot;</p>

<p>Christie has been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503154627/http://gothamist.com/2014/02/01/david_wildstein_was_pretty_creepy_a.php">desperately trying to distance himself</a> from Wildstein <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503154627/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/08/chris_christie_i_had_no_idea_my_top.php">in recent weeks</a>, despite previously praising him and reportedly using him as his &quot;eyes and ears&quot; in the Port Authority. Wildstein, who reportedly got his position at the Port Authority <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503154627/http://nypost.com/2014/02/01/christie-blasts-bridgegate-accuser-amid-new-accusations/">because of his friendship with the governor</a>, has been downgraded from an old friend to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503154627/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/09/christies_schoolmate_pleads_5th_dur.php">someone Christie is barely acquainted with</a> and has only met a few times in his life. Political reporters aren&apos;t buying it:</p>

<p>Brian Adams, a former political reporter in New Jersey and now an assistant professor of history at Baruch College, nailed the pettiness of Christie&apos;s strategy <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503154627/http://talkingpointsmemo.com/cafe/well-that-escalated-quickly">with this long piece for Talking Points Memo:</a></p>

<blockquote>It is hard for me to believe that the governor of an American state could author such a piece of risible juvenilia, except it is even harder for me to believe a paid communications professional could have been behind this. The &#x201C;argument&#x201D; Christie (or possibly one very very close longtime advisor) is making here is that David Wildstein is a bad guy.

<p>Why?</p>

<p>Because as a &#x201C;a 16-year-old kid&#x201D; he filed a lawsuit over a school board election and was &#x201C;publicly accused by his high school social studies teacher of deceptive behavior.&#x201D; Because he was, according to Christie, a &#x201C;tumultuous&#x201D; person (not the correct usage of that word, Governor, but whatever). Because he was &#x201C;a political animal&#x201D; who had &#x201C;a controversial tenure&#x201D; as the mayor of Livingston. Because he &#x201C;made moves that were not productive.&#x201D;</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>He adds that Christie is a hypocrite about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503154627/http://gothamist.com/2013/12/10/chris_christies_buddy_closed_down_g.php">payback politics</a>:</p>

<blockquote>And here we get to the heart of the matter. David Wildstein was put in the Port Authority by Chris Christie, in a job Christie invented, to be the governor&#x2019;s eyes and ears - his enforcer. Wildstein was put at the Port so Christie could more effectively use the Port as an extension of his political operation (as Steve and I are documenting, more and more, with each passing week).

<p>So spare us the shock that Wildstein is &#x201C;a political animal.&#x201D; Christie knew who Wildstein was before he appointed him to this job. There is no sense in distancing yourself from one of your own appointees who was given a job specifically because his skills matched what you were looking to accomplish with that appointment.</p></blockquote><p></p>
