<p><strong>Game Of Thrones Power Rankings Week 9</strong></p>

<p><strong>1. Darth Sansa:</strong> Jon Snow begins the episode unable to recognize how much his sister has changed over the course of the show, how trauma and experience has hardened her into a real player in the game. &quot;Did it ever once occur to you that I might have some insight&quot; into Ramsay, she asks. By the end of the conversation, she reveals her only code now: &quot;No one can protect me. No one can protect anyone.&quot;</p>

<p>Jon gets it much more by the end&#x2014;seeing her was enough to stop him from punching Ramsay to death&#x2014;though he&apos;s not there to witness her verbal dismantling of her rapist, captor and second husband: &quot;Your words will disappear. Your house will disappear. Your name will disappear. All memory of you will disappear.&quot; She doesn&apos;t add that his face will also soon disappear, but that would just be gilding the lily. </p>

<p>Thanks to her matter-of-fact threats (&quot;You&apos;re going to die tomorrow Lord Bolton, sleep well&quot; is pretty brutal!), standing up to her brother, taking charge of the battle by bringing in reinforcements on her terms, killing her tormentor (her first kill), and becoming the lady of Winterfell once again, she&apos;s earned the top spot on the list. Having said that, it still doesn&apos;t quite make sense why she never gave Jon a head&apos;s up that she had reached out to the Vale, even if she thought it wasn&apos;t likely to happen. (A lot of Stark-loyalist soldiers probably would have appreciated that.)</p>

<p>But she can&apos;t trust anyone&#x2014;no one can protect her. And the only reward right now is the hint of a smile which spreads over her face once she&apos;s taken her revenge. Ramsay and his  torture parties will seem like distant memories by next season, but Sansa is only getting started. And she really rocks that cape.</p>

<p><strong>2. Accurately Replicating The Feeling Of Being Buried Alive Under A Crunch Of Human Bodies In A Medieval-Style Battle:</strong> I have never been in a medieval-style battle...nor any battle of any kind that involved bloodshed (unless you count a particularly vicious stick fight I had with my next door neighbor in 5th grade, in which case I am a hardened veteran of war), but this episode seemed to do a bang up job of capturing the essence of the experience, with all the chaos and hacked limbs you might expect. </p>

<p>Directed by Miguel Sapochnik (who also helmed <em>Hardhome</em>), &quot;Battle Of The Bastards&quot; was filled with great cinematography and instantly memorable shots (those horses riding into the scrum in slow motion, and Jon Snow gasping for air as he was squeezed by men from all sides, stood out for me). Whether you think it&apos;s plot armor or luck that Jon Snow survived, replicating the claustrophobic feel of battle turned out to be the show&apos;s biggest production to date. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021151555/http://www.ew.com/article/2016/06/16/game-thrones-battle-bastards-numbers">It took</a> 600 crew members, 500 extras, 25 days, and over $10 million to make it all work. The fact that it married two huge battles (Starks/Boltons and the dragon-centric Meereen siege) with some character resolutions (Sansa/Ramsay), charming pairings (Davos/Tormund, Dany &amp; Tyrion/Yara &amp; Theon), and some incredibly gorgeous camera work made it one of the most satisfying episodes of the season.</p>

<p>Sapochnick discussed some of the inspirations for the battle scenes (and complications filming it) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021151555/http://www.ew.com/article/2016/06/19/game-thrones-battle-director">with EW</a>:</p>

<blockquote>Initially we based BOB on the battle of Agincourt which took place between the French and English in 1415. But as needs changed, as did budgets, it became more like the battle of Cannae between the Romans and Hannibal in 216 BC.

<p>The strategy and tactical aspect was a key thing for David and Dan. They wanted to specifically focus on that so that we could really see the way Ramsay ensnares and outguns Jon in the almost exactly the way the same way Davos had planned to defeat the Bolton army. I also did a bunch of research into Alexander the Great who was legendary in his strategic battle prowess.</p>

<p>That said at some point you need to put all the research down and tell a good story. The Bolton Shield wall, for example, was a production-friendly way to emulate a &#x201C;double envelopment pincer move&#x201D; [without] using horses as originally scripted, and also as a way to avoid seeing horizons on the field and therefore having to dress fewer dead bodies or stage background fights so deep because we didn&#x2019;t have the money.  </p></blockquote><p></p>

<p><strong>3. Balling Your Eyes Out On National Television:</strong> Congratulations to the Cleveland Cavaliers, who snapped a 52 year losing streak over the Golden State Warriors last night. It was an incredibly thrilling game, which I can definitively say because I watched the first quarter and the last 45 minutes. It seemed likely that Game 7 would overshadow the penultimate episode of GoT on social media, but once LeBron started leaping across the paint to block Draymond Green&apos;s soul, it turned into the Gold Wedding. Commissioner Adam Silver has already called it &quot;one of the greatest games in NBA history,&quot; which is kind of like calling <em>The Americans</em> season four one of the greatest seasons of a show in television history&#x2014;it may be a little premature to make declarations about the historical impact of something which happened five minutes ago, but it also <em>really</em> might be true.</p>

<p>And huge congratulations to LeBron James and JR Smith. James put his team on his shoulders and put up huge play after huge play, especially over the last three games of this historically improbable comeback. And JR is... great at being JR. They earned every tear of joy. Jon Snow could probably learn something from them about actualizing his emotions. </p>

<p><strong>4. The Legend Of The Beggar Queen:</strong> No ruler that ever lived had the support of all the people, but the really good ones all had reputations that preceded them, which is something Dany has going for her after the showdown with the Masters in Meereen. &quot;My reign has just begun,&quot; she says as she climbs aboard the most cinematic (and well-behaved) CGI dragon I&apos;ve ever seen burn men to ashes in a TV show.</p>

<p><strong>5. Horses:</strong> I never quite grasped just how strategically vital horses would be in a battle like this. Yet the &apos;higher ground&apos; made all the difference, especially when the knights of the Vale arrived with some much-needed reinforcements and literally slammed into the Bolton army head-first. </p>

<p>Plus, there is no underestimating how cool horses <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021151555/http://www.mnn.com/earth-matters/animals/photos/12-astonishing-facts-about-horses/horses-have-weird-side#top-desktop">can be</a>: they can&apos;t vomit, they&apos;re related to rhinos, they never laugh, and sometimes they poop on Jon Snow: &quot;In fact, one of the hardest scenes to shoot was the parlay between the different factions prior to the actual battle,&quot; director Miguel Sapochnik <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021151555/http://www.ew.com/article/2016/06/19/game-thrones-battle-director">told EW</a>. &quot;Getting a bunch of horses to just stand there all day and do nothing is much harder than getting them to run around. They would fart and pee a lot, often in the middle of [star Kit Harington&#x2019;s] lines.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>6. Jon Snow&apos;s Never-Ending <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021151555/http://www.simpsoncrazy.com/lists/retirement">Day Before Retirement</a>:</strong> We learned this week that Jon is kind of a terrible tactician (though to be fair, he didn&apos;t know backup was on the way when he met with his &quot;war council&quot; and mansplained battlefield strategy to Sansa), and still prone to emotional lapses in judgement (which is why Ramsay was able to bait him into the middle of the field). We also learned that he&apos;s still struggling with his resurrection, enough that he&apos;s staying up all night talking to Melisandre about God like a freshman in college who recently <em>really</em> got into Sufjan Stevens.</p>

<p>He has her words of encouragement (&quot;Maybe he brought you here to die again&quot; is a hell of a pep talk) ringing in his ears during the battle, but even when all the noise and music fades out and he finds himself having a serene moment while embedded underneath accumulating piles of bodies, he finds the strength to climb back toward the light. After this battle, he&apos;s certainly earned himself a vacation, maybe to somewhere warm like Dorne&#x2014;too bad he probably won&apos;t ever get to take it.</p>

<p><strong>7. The Season Of Misandry:</strong> GoT really nailed the Father&apos;s Day vibes throughout the episode: &quot;Our fathers were evil men, all of us here,&quot; Dany says at one point. &quot;They left the world worse than they found it. We&apos;re not going to do that.&quot; But hey, at least nobody was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021151555/http://gothamist.com/2014/06/16/game_of_thrones_power_rankings_the_4.php">fatally shot on the toilet</a> this year!</p>

<p>Dads may have inspired these strong women in various ways&#x2014;Dany, Yara, Sansa &amp; Lady Mormont in this episode, plus you could add Arya, Cersei, the Queen Of Thorns, Brienne of Fucking Tarth, Margaery Tyrell, and even Ellaria Sand &amp; the Sand Snakes to that list&#x2014;but they are going to remake the world in their own image. And if the ladies of the Known World murder an evil uncle or two along the way (or perhaps a sadistic killing machine who delights in feeding people to his dogs), all the better.</p>

<p>Let&apos;s all take a moment to step back and appreciate something that no one could have predicted back in the pilot: there is a legit possibility that GoT will end with women ruling the majority of the Seven Kingdoms and beyond. &quot;All Men Must Die,&quot; the saying goes, but they never said anything about the women.</p>

<p><strong>8. Yara &amp; Theon Greyjoy 3.0: The Reboot:</strong> Still can&apos;t help but feel that the inter-Iron Islands drama is largely plot glue to help move Dany from Meereen to Westeros, but at least it&apos;s finally paying off with a fun scene featuring Tyrion sniping at Theon (&quot;We all live complicated lives, don&apos;t we?&quot;), Dany taking away the Iron way of life (no more reaving, roving, raiding or raping), and Yara making sex eyes at Dany (&quot;I never demand, but I&apos;m up for anything really&quot;). </p>

<p><strong>9. Tormund Eloquencebane&apos;s Overtures Of Friendship:</strong> This battle-centric episode got a shot of humor thanks to Tormund, who has become one of the secret MVPs of the season. There&apos;s his dumbfounded reaction to learning about the pincer movement/double envelopment; commiserating with Jon Snow about &quot;that cunt&quot; Ramsay Snow; his very serious concern about real-life demons; and his endorsement of sour goat&apos;s milk: &quot;Stronger than any of the grapewater you southern twats like sucking on.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>10. Tyrion&apos;s Topsy-Turvey Rollercoaster Of Counseling Rulers:</strong> Tyrion has a surprisingly easy time convincing Dany he has been running the city competently while she was burning down buildings in Vaes Dothrak, despite all appearances to the contrary upon her return. His advice to make a strong statement to the Masters and the region without literally burning cities to the ground pays off big. Her sense of diplomacy has improved leaps and bounds since he started counseling her.</p>

<p>Also interesting to note: while he relishes the chance to call out the Masters for their hypocrisy and dishonorable natures (&quot;It always seems a bit abstract, doesn&apos;t it, other people dying?&quot;), he still has to turn away from Grey Worm cutting their necks open. Tyrion is no great warrior like his brother Jaime once was, but he&apos;s definitely Dany&apos;s best chance at navigating a lot of personalities and taking over Westeros.</p>

<p><strong>11a. The Accent Formerly Known As Littlefinger</strong>: Oh hey, thanks for stopping by and smiling like a total creepster for a few seconds.</p>

<p><strong>11b. The Fanatic Formerly Known As Melisandre</strong>: Still serving the Lord of Light. Still bumming out Jon Snow something fierce. Still missing &quot;war council&quot; meetings. Still responsible for Shireen&apos;s death. Still on this show!</p>

<p><strong>12. PSA: Take Care Of Your Dogs:</strong> This episode has a pretty solid takeaway for any aspiring pet owners embedded into its plot. Bad dog owners get what they deserve! </p>

<p><strong>13. Happy Shitting:</strong> It&apos;s been 10 episodes (and a year in real time) since Stannis and Melisandre <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021151555/http://gothamist.com/2015/06/08/game_of_thrones_power_rankings_the_8.php">sacrificed his daughter Shireen</a> to the Lord of Light in an attempt to improve weather conditions in the North and defeat the Bolton army. It didn&apos;t work, but Ser Davos has only asked Melisandre once about what happened there (as far as we can tell). Now that he&apos;s discovered the remnants of the toy he once gave her, he&apos;s at a simmering rage. After he learns the full truth, he&apos;s going to have to walk <em>really</em> far away from camp so no one can hear him shitting (and crying) his guts out.</p>

<p><strong>14. Running In A Straight Line:</strong> Rickon was always the most expendable Stark to people outside the Powers That Be here at GoT Power Rankings, so it&apos;s wholly unsurprising that he&apos;s dead now (although the manner in which he was killed was particular cruel). We know a lot of people probably didn&apos;t get a huge emotional impact out of his death, but no one cried to the blue <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021151555/http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_maigucyAU61qcngeko6_250.gif">corn moon</a> in our hearts like him. </p>

<p>And the worst part (or perhaps most typical) is that it&apos;s all his own fault: if he had just zig-zagged instead of running in a straight line, we would still have Rickon Watch 2016 to get us through the long winter. Some little lords are just too beautiful for this world.</p>

He was always more of a cartoonish evil character than most of the GoT villains (give or take a Walder Frey), but actor Iwan Rheon never got enough credit for the subtly campy, theatrical line readings he would use to keep the psychotic character off-balance (not to mention his bug-eyed enthusiasm for playing his sadistic games). </p>

<p><strong>The Viserys Targaryen Memorial Least Powerful Person Of The Week Award:</strong> There are an overwhelming number of options this week: The Sons Of the Harpy who watched a Dotraki horde rush over to kill them. The Bolton foot soldiers on the frontlines who were killed by their own arrows. The men on the Masters&apos; boats who were burned to a CGI crisp. The sniveling Masters themselves, who turned on one of their own in a heartbeat. But this award goes to <strong>All Of Us</strong> for not being able to do more to save poor Rickon.

<p><strong>&quot;Hey! This Seems Like Something Important We&apos;re Supposed To Pay Attention To&quot; Westerosi History Lesson Of The Week: </strong></p>

<p><em>Tyrion</em>: Welcome home.<br>
<em>Dany</em>: Uh, what&apos;s up with these ships attacking the city?<br>
<em>Tyrion</em>: It&apos;s cool, don&apos;t worry about it, the city is fine.<br>
<em>Dany</em>: I&apos;m worried about it.<br>
<em>Tyrion</em>: That makes sense.<br>
<em>Dany</em>: <em>Ugh</em>, now I have to go kill every man, woman &amp; child.<br>
<em>Tyrion</em>: Remember how your dad was kinda crazy?<br>
<em>Dany</em>: I know you are but what am I?<br>
<em>Tyrion</em>: Yeah, but did you know he strategically planted WILDFIRE all around King&apos;s Landing and was planning to burn the city to the ground before my brother stabbed him in the back?<br>
<em>Dany</em>: Oh yeah, didn&apos;t we learn about that back in season two when Tyrion was still Hand of the King and trying to dig up all the WILDFIRE he could to defend the city from Stannis?<br>
<em>Tyrion</em>: Yes, I am Tyrion, that was me. <br>
<em>Dany</em>: And is that what Qyburn was whispering to Cersei about last week?<br>
<em>Tyrion</em>: Yes, although I don&apos;t know how you know that.<br>
<em>Dany</em>: I wonder if this information will prove to be important at a later date.<br>
<em>Tyrion</em>: Indeed, I too wonder.</p>

<p><strong>Rickon Watch 2016: Is Rickon Going To Die?</strong> Let&apos;s keep this simple. One last time:</p>

<strong>Way Beyond The Wall</strong>: As is befitting an episode which only took place in two locations (Winterfell and Meereen), we didn&apos;t have the time to check in around the rest of the Known World this week. Soooo (big breath): no Jaime &quot;Human Embodiement of a C+&quot; Lannister, Brienne Of Fucking Tarth, Pod, Ser Bronn, or any Freys or Tullys. No Arya or Faceless Monks. No Hound or Brotherhood Without Banners (nor any Catelyn Stark References).</p>

<p>We didn&apos;t stop by King&apos;s Landing, so no Cersei, Zombie Mountain, Tommen, Margaery and Loras Tyrell, the Queen of Thorns, Grand Maester Pycelle, Kevan Lannister, Lord Oaf Of Highgarden, Septa Unella, or the High Sparrow (aka Shoeless Zealot). There was no sign of Bran, The Worst Teenager North Of The Wall, or his traveling companions, Meera Reed and Coldhands/Benjen Stark/Soap Opera Plotline Incarnate. Still no sign of Gilly, Sam and his family. Ser Friendstone is still off traveling the world.</p>

<p>We didn&apos;t take a trip to the Iron Islands. No Robyn Arryn, aka Prepubescent Julian Casablancas. Still no sign of Dorne/Sand Snakes/Ellaria Sand since the premiere (we are very okay with that). No Children of the Forest, White Walkers or Night&apos;s King either, although we did have this watermelon carving video to hold us over.</p>

<p>Now to our regular absentees (which for the first time in three years, doesn&apos;t include Beric Dondarrion or Thoros of Myr!): no Previously On GoT Replay Of Joffrey Baratheon&apos;s Death, Previously On GoT Ghost Of Ned Stark&apos;s Manbun, or Previously On GoT Ghost Of Robert Baratheon&apos;s Unkempt Beard. No sign of Pirate Of Stannis Salladhor Saan (remember him?), no Hot Pie and as mentioned before, definitely no Gendry (you know! The guy on the rowboat!).</p>

<p>On next week&apos;s season finale of GoT (&quot;The Winds Of Winter&quot;), Cersei has her day in court, Jon kisses Sansa on the forehead, and the Freys host dinner again. Until then, enjoy a very frantic animal edition of the theme song.</p>
