<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510022756/http://gothamist.com/tags/banksy">Banksy</a> has updated his website with the latest piece for his open air street art tour of NYC, and it&apos;s...ant art. There was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510022756/http://www.banksy.co.uk/2013/10/19/staten-island">no text accompanying</a> the video (see it below) of the ant art piece, which is located somewhere on Staten Island, but it appears similar to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510022756/https://www.google.com/search?q=banksy+bush&amp;espv=210&amp;es_sm=91&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=EpliUvOvJ6-v4APj54GADA&amp;ved=0CCwQsAQ&amp;biw=1436&amp;bih=728">a vaginal piece he did a few years back.</a> Or maybe it&apos;s a commentary on the upcoming <em>Ant-Man</em> movie!</p>

<p>Notably, Banksy has now made it to all five boroughs with this piece: There have been numerous ones in Brooklyn and Manhattan, and this past week there was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510022756/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/16/photos_ronald_mcdonald.php#photo-1">a traveling piece in the Bronx</a> and a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510022756/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/14/photo_latest_banksy_seems_to_be_in_1.php#photo-1">stencil Woodside, Queens</a>. Will he travel to a sixth borough next?</p>
