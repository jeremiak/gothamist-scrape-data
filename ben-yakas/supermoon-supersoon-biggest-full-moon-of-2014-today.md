<p>Today, the moon will be at its closest point to Earth at the same time that it is full, an event scientists call a &#x201C;lunar perigee,&#x201D; or as we around the office like to howl, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141005012306/http://gothamist.com/tags/supermoon">SUPERMOOOOOOOOOOOON.</a> We already <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141005012306/http://gothamist.com/2014/07/13/photos_summers_first_supermoon_over.php#photo-1">had one last month</a>, but today&apos;s is supposed to be the best (and brightest) of the year. The moon will become full as of 2:09 p.m. ET Sunday, but don&apos;t worry about that pesky sun blocking your view&#x2014;it will continue looking bright and full through Sunday evening into Monday early morning.</p>

<p>The U.S. Naval Observatory says the moon will be 12% bigger and 30% brighter than it was in January 2014.

<p>The next Supermoon will occur on September 9th. If you get any great photos of tonight&apos;s moon, feel free to send them to photos@gothamist.com or tag them as &quot;Gothamist&quot; on Flickr.</p>
