<p>Generally speaking, trying to surf on anything but water is a bad idea&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150409202727/http://gothamist.com/tags/subwaysurfing">subway surfing</a> is demented, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150409202727/http://kiloo.com/games/subway-surfers">Subway Surfer</a> the app is addictively demented, and hitching onto the backs of cars is pretty unadvisable as well. One Brooklyn man learned that the hard way this week when he fell off the back of a truck in Williamsburg. &quot;His clothing was shredded off,&quot; witness Amanda Foreman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150409202727/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20140521/williamsburg/man-hurt-fall-after-hitching-ride-on-back-of-truck-police-say">told DNAInfo</a>. &quot;He was bleeding from his neck and arms. I checked his pulse on his right wrist and neck. It was very shallow.&quot;</p>

<p>Police say that the man, who is believed to be in his 20s, fell off a food delivery truck near Bedford Avenue and North 11th Street not far from McCarren Park around 4:30 a.m. this morning. DNAInfo reports that the driver told investigators he had no idea the man was on the truck, and didn&apos;t stop initially after he fell. The surfer, whose name hasn&apos;t been released, was taken to Bellevue Hospital in serious but stable condition.</p>

<p>Police say the investigation is ongoing, but no criminality is suspected. </p>
