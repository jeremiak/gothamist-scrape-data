<p>In the past week alone, three people <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150622034602/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/19/two_people_killed_another_hurt_in_t.php">have been killed</a>, one person has had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150622034602/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/20/man_critically_injured_after_being.php">a leg severed</a>, and two others have been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150622034602/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/21/l_train_service_suspended_after_man.php">seriously injured</a> in separate <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150622034602/http://gothamist.com/tags/subway">subway incidents</a>. This morning <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150622034602/http://transportationnation.org/2013/01/23/manhattan-borough-president-calls-for-probe-in-subway-safety/">on WNYC</a>, Manhattan Borough President Scott Stringer said that this recent surge of subway deaths means <strong>&#x201C;we&#x2019;re really on pace now to hit 116&#x201D;</strong> in 2013. In light of this, Stringer and Transportation Commission Chairman James Vacca have now called for, respectively, an in-depth investigation and emergency hearings into these deaths, and what can be done to prevent them.</p>

<p>&quot;Even one life lost on our subway tracks is one life too many,&quot; Vacca said in a statement announcing the emergency hearings. &quot;It&apos;s time for elected officials, the public and the MTA to say &apos;enough is enough&apos; and actually do something about this problem. Standing by without a plan of action as incident after incident occurs is not an option,&quot; he said. &quot;The MTA needs to bring all the stakeholders to the table and acknowledge that this is a serious problem that demands a coordination solution, and they must tell the public what their plan is.&quot; Vacca&apos;s call came after a woman attempted suicide at the Bedford Avenue L Train station <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150622034602/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/21/l_train_service_suspended_after_man.php">on Monday</a>&#x2014;a day before another person <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150622034602/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/22/person_struck_by_2_train_at_times_s.php">fatally ran head-first</a> into the side of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150622034602/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/subway_suicide_horror_DggxnZQfYtGWLUfGZ8HSvI">a northbound 2 train.</a> </p>

<p>Last year, there were 54 (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150622034602/http://www.amny.com/urbanite-1.812039/manhattan-boro-prez-scott-stringer-calls-for-audit-into-subway-safety-1.4492644">or 55</a>&#x2014;we&apos;re seeing a slight discrepancy in the stats you believe) deaths-by-subway, and approximately 150 incidents where people were struck by subways. Stringer plans to call on the MTA Inspector General &quot;to conduct an in-depth investigation of recent subway-related injuries and fatalities and consider safety programs now being effectively utilized in transit systems across the world.&quot; Those possible programs include everything from new signage to sliding doors.</p>

<p>The MTA <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150622034602/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/29/mta_to_revisit_installing_sliding_d.php">has noted</a> that they are open to considering installing sliding doors on some subway platforms. Thomas Prendergast, the agency&#x2019;s acting executive director, previously <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150622034602/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/13/mta_exploring_installing_sliding_do.php">said that the L is an ideal test spot</a> because it doesn&#x2019;t share track with other lines and is used by only one type of train. But based on our conversation <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150622034602/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/30/jfk_airtrain_architect_on_subway_sl.php">with transit architect Jonathan Cohn</a>, the design director of the JFK AirTrain, it sounded as though the MTA was just indulging a good but ultimately too-tough-to-implement idea.</p>

<p>Having said that, the MTA haven&apos;t sat back while all this has been happening as well: they&apos;re already planning an &#x201C;aggressive passenger information campaign&#x201D; to warn straphangers to stand away from the platform edge. That includes revamping the announcement system to increase the frequency of the messages. The MTA is also considering expanding the &#x201C;see something, say something&#x201D; campaign to ask straphangers to look out for the mentally ill.</p>

<p>In addition, the TWU <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150622034602/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/19/twu_launches_campaign_against_mta_t.php">has also launched a flyer campaign</a> aimed at slowing down the speed of trains as they enter subway stations. That was an idea <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150622034602/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/20/subway_hero_describes_saving_man_fr.php">subway hero Ramiro Ocasio</a>, who selflessly saved an elderly man who had fallen onto the tracks last Friday, strongly agreed with. </p>
