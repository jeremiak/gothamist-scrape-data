										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="111613boobjob.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504140945im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/111613boobjob.jpg" width="640" height="427"> <br> <i> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504140945/http://www.shutterstock.com/pic-3155290/stock-photo-a-woman-considering-a-breast-augmentation-metaphor-skeptical.html?src=lOc3SnDgle1IsqEMuxllWg-1-9">Shutterstock/Kzenon</a></i></div> <p></p>

<p>We all know that everyone <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504140945/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/26/everyone_loves_to_get_a_boob_job.php">loves getting boob jobs</a>&#x2014;breast augmentation operations have increased 40 percent in the past decade in America. But the stupid government won&apos;t allow people under 22 to express their god-given right to place silicone implants inside their bodies. One 19-year-old figured out a way around such trivialities: she scammed an Upper East Side plastic surgeon out of a $7,500 boob job.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504140945/http://nypost.com/2013/11/15/teen-scams-plastic-surgeon-to-buy-bigger-breasts/">According to the Post</a>, the teen used a fake ID to fill out paperwork at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504140945/http://www.bodycosmetica.com/">Body Cosmetica</a> on East 85th Street on April 12, 2012. She also used a bogus credit card to pay for the procedure, and disappeared into the night. It took the company over a year and a half to figure out they had been scammed because it took the credit card company that long to confirm it was a scam.</p>

<p>But the <strike>BREAST</strike> best part of all this is the quippy police sources who offered the Post these groaners: &#x201C;The cops are working vigorously to get this huge bust,&#x201D; said one cop. &#x201C;I guess some people will do anything for bigger breasts. This lady really takes the cake,&#x201D; another added&#x2014;though that one would have been better had he said &quot;This lady really takes the BOOB JOB,&quot; because that&apos;s exactly what she did, amirite?</p>
