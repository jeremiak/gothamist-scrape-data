</div></div>					<p>They weren&apos;t joking about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160818181433/http://gothamist.com/2012/08/15/heavy_thunderstorms_possible_later.php">a possible thunderstorm rolling through today</a>&#x2014;the sky was just enveloped by grey clouds and heavy rains have been pouring down over most of Brooklyn and Queens. Those rains have also reportedly taken down the E train: &quot;E train is shut down. Flooding in the subway&#xBB; thank God I got off and took the 7 today,&quot; tweeted <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160818181433/https://twitter.com/moneyronweather/status/235808680711426049">one straphanger.</a></p>

<p>Above, you can see photos from various spots in the two boroughs where reports of flooding are coming in. And it might not be over just yet: the National Weather Service has extended the Flash Flood Warning for Queens and Brooklyn until 5:30 p.m., and issued a Severe Thunderstorm Warning for Queens, Brooklyn, and Manhattan until 4:45 p.m. </p>
