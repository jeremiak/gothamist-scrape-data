<p>The final remaining Borders Books and Music stores closed last Sunday, after the company filed for bankruptcy and were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111030170229/http://gothamist.com/2011/07/18/good-bye_borders_book_seller_prepar.php">forced to liquidate</a> completely earlier this year. But some employees got in a last word on the bookstore chain, by posting this airing of grievances about customers.  Check out the full list after the jump.</p>

<p>The person who posted the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111030170229/http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/kjygd/things_we_never_told_you_ode_to_a_bookstore_death/">picture on Reddit</a> isn&apos;t sure which store the list originates, but they surmise that the employees who wrote it &quot;do appear to have been snotty, arrogant hipsters, nonetheless.&quot; As a former employee of Borders ourselves, we agree with some of the things on the list, especially the bit about Nicholas Sparks, books-turned-movies (we especially hated it when good books got saddled with terrible movie still photo covers), and the daycare bit. Other things&#x2014;the coupons, &quot;quick question&quot; and reading porn&#x2014;never bugged us in the least. </p>

<p>One thing that DID really annoy us, which we would add to this list (from experience): nuns who tried to use their special educators discount to buy sapphic vampire softcore porn as &quot;teaching materials.&quot; Don&apos;t try it, sister.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111030170229/http://shelf-life.ew.com/2011/09/20/borders-employees-complaints/">full list of grievances</a> below:</p>

<ul>
	<li>We hate when a book becomes popular simply because it was turned into a movie.</li>
	<li>It confused us when we were asked where the non-fiction section is.</li>
	<li>Nicholas Sparks is not a good writer&#x2026;if you like him, fine, but facts are facts.</li>
	<li>We greatly dislike the phrase &#x201C;Quick question.&#x201D; It&#x2019;s never true. And everyone seems to have one.</li>
	<li>Your summer reading list was our summer reading NIGHTMARE. Also, it&#x2019;s called summer reading, not three days before school starts reading.</li>
	<li>It&#x2019;s true that we lean to the left and think Glenn Beck is an idiot.</li>
	<li>We always knew when you were intently reading Better Homes and Gardens, it was really a hidden Playboy.</li>
	<li>Most of the time when you returned books you read them already &#x2014; and we were onto you.</li>
	<li>Limit One Coupon did not mean one for every member of your family &#x2014; this angered us. Also, we did know what coupons were out.</li>
	<li>It never bothered us when you threatened to shop at Barnes &amp; Noble. We&#x2019;d rather you do if you&#x2019;re putting up a stink.</li>
	<li>&#x201C;I was just here last week and saw this book there&#x201D; meant nothing to us. The store changed once a week.</li>
	<li>When you walked in and immediately said, &#x201C;I&#x2019;m looking for a book,&#x201D; what you really meant to say is, &#x201C;I would like you to find me a book.&#x201D; You never looked. It&#x2019;s fine, it&#x2019;s our job &#x2014; but let&#x2019;s be correct about what&#x2019;s really happening here.</li>
	<li>If you don&#x2019;t know the author, title, or genre, but you do know the color of the cover, we don&#x2019;t either. How it was our fault that we couldn&#x2019;t find it we&#x2019;ll never understand.</li>
	<li>We were never a daycare. Letting your children run free and destroy our section destroyed a piece of our souls.</li>
	<li>Oprah was not the &#x201C;final say&#x201D; on what is awesome. We really didn&#x2019;t care what was on her show or what her latest book club book was. Really.</li>
	<li>When you returned your SAT books, we knew you used them. We thought it wasn&#x2019;t fair &#x2014; seeing that we are not a library.</li>
</ul>
