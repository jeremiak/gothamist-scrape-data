<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429165338/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/weather/severe-weather-alerts/">Flood warnings</a> are in effect around the tri-state area today as a heavy, hard rain keeps a-fallin&apos;. Suffice to say, it is supremely gross outside&#x2014;and particularly dangerous if you need to drive anywhere. But even if you don&apos;t go outside, you may not be safe: the flooding <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429165338/http://www.reddit.com/r/nyc/comments/jicwg/my_apartment_is_flooding_from_the_rainstorm/">has spread indoors</a> as well.</p>

<p>There have already been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429165338/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2011/08/14/heavy-rains-flood-streets-trap-cars-in-parts-of-nyc-and-long-island/?utm_source=home&amp;utm_medium=dl&amp;utm_campaign=rainy-and-cool">many reports of</a> cars trapped in water in Brooklyn&#x2014;five cars were stuck in water at Garfield Street between 4th and 5th avenues, and people had to be rescued from a car under four feet of water at 9th Street and Smith Street. On the BQE, Roosevelt Avenue was closed down because of stranded cars there and the Staten Island Expressway closed between Clove Road and Richmond Road.</p>

<p>Con-Ed says it has reports of scattered outages around the city, mostly in Staten Island and Brooklyn. And <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429165338/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2011/08/14/2011-08-14_rain_snarls_traffic_floods_subways_in_new_york_city.html">NYC Transit announced that</a> the flooding has affected the below train lines:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Northbound A and C trains are operating express between Canal Street and 59th Street Columbus Circle due to switch problems at Canal St.</li>
	<li>N service is suspended between Whitehall St. and Coney Island-Stillwell Avenue</li>
	<li>R service is suspended between Pacific St. and 95th St.</li>
	<li>Shuttle bus service is in place for N and R customers between Coney Island-Stillwell Avenue and Pacific Street.</li>
	<li>The D is operating on the Q line in both directions between Coney Island-Stillwell Avenue and DeKalb Avenue due to water condition at 36th St. in Brooklyn.</li>
	<li>Northbound E and F trains are operating express from West 4th Street to 47th-50th-Rockefeller Center due to flooding at 34th St. The southbound E is terminating at Second Avenue.</li>
</ul>

<p>The series finale of the Yankees/Rays series <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429165338/http://www.nydailynews.com/blogs/yankees/2011/08/yanks-and-rays-rained-out-aj-to-pitch-monday">has also been cancelled</a> due to the rain. As of this morning, three inches of rain had fallen in Central Park, four inches had fallen in Brooklyn, and almost six inches was reported at JFK and at Bellmore, Long Island. And with a week or more of thunderstorms ahead, don&apos;t expect the rain to abate <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429165338/http://www.weather.com/weather/tenday/10025">anytime soon too.</a> We think Dusty had it right:</p>
