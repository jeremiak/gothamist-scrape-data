<p>Police are searching for a man who stole a necklace off of a three-year-old in a Queens McDonalds recently. Cops say that the suspect followed the toddler and her mother into a McDonald&apos;s in Jackson Heights on August 30th around 1:45 p.m. The man waited until the little girl began walking upstairs in the restaurant, then grabbed the gold necklace from off of her and ran out. </p>
