<p>Last week, the internet briefly roused itself from its summertime hibernation when it was reported that you could <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502194159/http://hyperallergic.com/135139/artist-offers-cage-stay-on-airbnb/">stay in a jail cell for just $10 a night</a> via AirBNB. The cage, which actually just costs a person $1 a night and is located in Bushwick, is a project by artist Miao Jiaxin&#x2014;but faster than you can scream <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502194159/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/17/brooklyn_man_giving_away_his_giant.php">&quot;Human-Sized Hamster Wheel,&quot;</a> it was removed from AirBNB. There apparently is some serious demand for fantasy jail experiences, so Miao has now posted the listing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502194159/https://www.facebook.com/miaojiaxinstudio">on his Facebook</a>. </p>

<p>Here are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502194159/https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.1506601739556344.1073741830.1505614209655097&amp;type=1">all the relevant details about the cage</a>, which includes <em>quite</em> a lot of rules about how to behave inside:</p>

<p>&quot;It&#x2019;s not for fun,&quot; Miao, a Shanghai native who moved to New York 2006, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502194159/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/brooklyn-artist-jail-cell-studio-renting-1-article-1.1850031">told the Daily News</a>. &quot;It&#x2019;s for an experience. More like a psychological New York City experience.&quot; AirBNB said they took down the listing because it was more of an art project than an accommodation; Miao <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502194159/http://hyperallergic.com/135139/artist-offers-cage-stay-on-airbnb/">argued back</a>, &quot;This room has bed, heating, air conditioning, refrigerator, a private full bathroom with shower within the same space. It is a very comfortable accommodation which can be considered as a theme hotel.&quot; </p>

<p>It may not be meant for fun (&quot;Everybody is living in a cage,&quot; Miao told them, although he also referred to it as a &quot;theme hotel&quot;), but it kind of seems like performance artist <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502194159/http://gothamist.com/tags/matthewsilver">Matthew Silver</a> may have been having at least a <em>little</em> fun trying it out in the video below:</p>
