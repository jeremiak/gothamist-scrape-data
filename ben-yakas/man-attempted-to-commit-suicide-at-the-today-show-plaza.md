<p>According to cops, the unidentified man was in the plaza around 7:50 a.m. when the incident happened; he was able to cut his wrists and possibly his arms with the knife before he was tackled by security. He was taken to St. Luke&#x2019;s Hospital for treatment. Lauer noted that the man said something about not wanting to harm others, but did want to cause harm to himself.</p>
