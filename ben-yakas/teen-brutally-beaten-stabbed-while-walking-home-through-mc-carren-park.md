<p>A 16-year-old was savagely beaten and nearly stabbed to death by a group of teens while walking home through McCarren Park Friday night. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427145832/http://www.metro.us/newyork/local/article/1147361--teen-nearly-killed-walking-home-through-mccarren-park-in-williamsburg">According to Metro</a>, two brothers were walking near Driggs and Union Avenues around 9:20 p.m. Friday when they were confronted by three people who told them it was gang territory. The three then allegedly hit one brother in the face with a brick, threw him to the ground and repeatedly punched and kicked him in his face, head and body. They also slashed him in the neck and back. </p>

<p>An eyewitness <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427145832/http://awalkintheparknyc.blogspot.com/2012/07/teen-severely-beaten-stabbed-in.html">told A Walk In The Park</a> the confrontation was even more brutal than that, saying the group attacked the boy with bats and broken bottles: &quot;They were swinging baseball bats, punching him and throwing things. They hit him with a bottle. It was the whole group, everybody was getting their punches in. They seemed hell bent on killing this kid.&quot; The witness called 911 and yelled at the attackers, which caused them to flee: &quot;Unfortunately, the victim had been beaten quite severely by then and stabbed but he was still conscious.&quot;</p>

<p>The victim was taken to Bellevue Hospital, and survived the attack. Argenis Zarzuela, 18, Seth Martinez, 16, and Kenny Nunez, 15, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427145832/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20120710/williamsburg/teen-stabbed-mccarren-park">have been arrested</a> for the attack. All three have been charged with attempted murder, gang assault, criminal possession of a weapon and menacing. </p>

As tempting as it may be for the media to fold this into the &quot;McCarren Park Pool Pandemonium&quot; narrative, not every violent incident is the result of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427145832/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/01/video_what_its_like_waiting_to_get.php">long lines</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427145832/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/09/mccarren_park_pool_evacuated_after.php">evacuations.</a></p>

<p>As for the security of the actual park, Geoffery Croft of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427145832/http://nycparkadvocates.org/">NYC Parks Advocates</a> told us he recently sent the Parks Department and the mayor&apos;s office an email blasting the city for lying about the level of parks enforcement in city parks: &quot;Despite what the Parks Department says, there&apos;s not a single park enforcement officer available for patrol in Brooklyn. They&apos;re not out in parks patrolling, like a beat cop. They&apos;ve lost 42% of their officers since 2008, and the remaining ones are assigned to beaches and pools.&quot;</p>
