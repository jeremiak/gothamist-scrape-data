										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="32513bad1.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150511170421im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_chrisrobbins/32513bad1.jpeg" width="365" height="366" class="image-left"> </span>The EMS lieutenant who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150511170421/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/24/ems_bad_lieutenant_cries_when_racis.php">tweeted a bevy of racist, antisemitic comments</a> and was suspended after he hit the front page of the NY Post has now resigned from the FDNY. EMS Lt. Timothy Dluhos, 34, who went by the moniker &quot;Bad Lieutenant&quot;, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150511170421/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/staten_island/whiner_loser_quits_ems_5GQ8nB1YtIsf0HnRKpNW4O?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Staten%20Island">chose to resign to avoid</a> any potential disciplinary charges that could have led to his firing when his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150511170421/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/25/racist_bad_lieutenant_suspended_fro.php">30-day suspension</a> ended April 24. &#x201C;He displayed bad judgment,&#x201D; said First Amendment attorney Ron Kuby, who told the Post he had spoken with Dluhos. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s incredibly sad that stupid tweets could erase over a decade of service.&#x201D;</p>

<p>To recap: Dluhos used a portrait of Adolf Hitler for his Twitter avatar (@BKNorthLt), and lamented working with &quot;coloreds&quot; while noting that &quot;chinks can&apos;t drive&quot; and calling Mayor Bloomberg &quot;King Heeb.&quot; After being confronted by a Post reporter, Dluhos was photographed wearing a jacket embroidered with the words &quot;Bad Lieutenant&quot; and sobbing on his stoop. &#x201C;There has got to be a lot worse out there than me,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;My life is ruined. Oh, my God. I&#x2019;m so sorry.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Dluhos is the second prominent FDNY member to resign in recent months over racist tweets&#x2014;FDNY Commissioner Salvatore Cassano&apos;s son <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150511170421/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/18/fdny_commissioners_son_resigns_afte.php">resigned from the EMS</a> due to a series of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150511170421/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/18/son_of_fdny_commissioner_uses_twitt.php">hate-filled tweets</a> in March as well. More <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150511170421/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/31/multiple_fdny_emts_have_posted_grap.php">bad social media behavior</a> from EMTs came out after that as well.</p>

<p>Dluhos, who officially retired on April 16 and will get a partial pension, may have found himself a new job by now though: he previously moonlighted for Richmond County Ambulance on Staten Island part-time, and has worked more hours for the service since his suspension. </p>
