<p>For the past several months, we&apos;ve lamented the fact that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140330021243/http://gothamist.com/tags/snl"><em>Saturday Night Live</em></a> has given short shrift to the copious new featured players brought in this season. One of those comedians who hasn&apos;t been given too much airtime (ranked <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140330021243/http://www.thewire.com/entertainment/2014/02/were-pulling-you-brooks-wheelan/357765/">second-to-last in airtime</a>, in fact) is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140330021243/http://brookswheelan.tumblr.com/">Brooks Wheelan</a>, a very funny stand-up comic whose lack of presence on the show was a joke unto itself in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140330021243/http://gothamist.com/2013/12/22/videos_jimmy_fallon_and_justin_timb.php#photo-4">a game show sketch during Jimmy Fallon&apos;s episode</a> (his guy who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140330021243/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/13/videos_saturday_night_live_has_bump.php#photo-8">regrets his Red Hot Chili Peppers tattoos</a> was good as well, and probably his most prominent character thus far).</p>

<p>But as you can see in the video below, you don&apos;t have to feel <em>too</em> bad for him: he recorded a second of every day of his past year, a year in which he started as an LA stand up comic with an engineering day job and ended up as a featured player on <em>SNL</em>. He&apos;s traveled a whole lot, listened to some great records, moved to the greatest city in the world, hung out with fellow SNLers, and held some pretty awesome dogs.</p>

<p>He&apos;s certainly had a very fortunate year, although as he notes, &quot;if you only film one second out of your day and put it to music, it looks like your day was much cooler than it actually was.&quot; </p>
