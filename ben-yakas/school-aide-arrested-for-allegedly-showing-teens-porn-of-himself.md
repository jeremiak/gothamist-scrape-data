<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="3110handcuff.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110409055008im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/3110handcuff.jpg" width="180" height="177" class="image-left"> </span>It seems pretty obvious to us that there are certain professions where one shouldn&apos;t under any circumstance try to casually watch or share porn, like say, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110409055008/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/17/pediatrician_charged_with_producing.php">pediatricians</a>, or school workers. This is what <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110409055008/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/19/porn_gets_its_own_domain_xxx.php">.XXX is for</a>! And yet, it seems like some people just can&apos;t help themselves.</p>

<p>Bronx school aide Isaac Bowens <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110409055008/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2011/04/08/2011-04-08_bronx_school_aide_is_busted_in_dirtypix_rap.html">was arrested</a> for allegedly showing two female students pornographic images inside M.S. 219 in Morrisania. Bowens, who also coaches the boys basketball team, showed the girls either pornographic photos or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110409055008/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local/new_york&amp;id=8060121">videos</a>&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110409055008/http://bronx.ny1.com/content/top_stories/137048/doe-employee-charged-with-showing-lewd-pictures-to-bronx-students">NY1 says</a> that they were &quot;lewd photos of himself&quot;&#x2014;and one of the girls complained. NY1 also implies that this sort of behavior may have occurred more than once. </p>

<p>Bowens has been suspended without pay by the DOE, and cops charged him with harassment, disseminating indecent material to a minor and endangering the welfare of a minor. This arrest comes on the heel of a recent boom in underage sex scandals, including a 20-year-old SI woman who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110409055008/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/31/si_sex_scandal.php">was arrested</a> for allegedly having sex with a 13-year-old, two Paramus chaperones <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110409055008/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/06/paramus_pervs_arrested_for_sex_with.php">were arrested</a> for &quot;inappropriate sexual contact&quot; with female students, and a NJ woman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110409055008/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/02/nj_woman_charged_for_having_sexual.php">was arrested</a> for carrying on a sexual relationship with two 15-year-olds. Just take a cue from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110409055008/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/10/the_mark_sanchez_scandal_that_wasnt.php">Mark Sancehz&apos;s playbook</a> and just avoid anyone under the age of 17 completely from here on out.</p>
