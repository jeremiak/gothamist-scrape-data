<p>A lot of parents resort to telling their kids that babies were carried in the sky by storks&#x2014;one day when Fatawmatt Kaba sits her son down to teach him about the birds and the bees, it won&apos;t be much of a stretch to tell him he really did drop out of the sky. Kaba went into labor and delievered a healthy baby boy while on a flight from South Africa to NYC on Saturday. &quot;You could see his little umbilical cord still attached,&quot; passenger Jamahl Winters, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504151203/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/exclusive-woman-birth-flight-south-africa-nyc-article-1.1284152">told the News</a>. &quot;It&#x2019;s amazing. I didn&#x2019;t think stuff like that really happened in real life. I thought it was something that happened in TV and movies.&quot;</p>

<p>Kaba, of Angola, was four hours into the 16-hour trip from Johannesburg to JFK Airport when she went into labor yesterday; officials say South African Airways Flight 203 was some 38,000 feet over West Africa around 8:30 p.m. when it happened. Officials initially considered diverting the plane, but that wouldn&apos;t help the mom-to-be, whose baby was coming one way or another. The pilot asked over the plane&#x2019;s loudspeaker if there was a doctor on board&#x2014;and lucky for all involved, there were two and a nurse, including pediatric anesthesiologist Dr. Julie Williamson.</p>

<p>&#x201C;It was exhilarating,&#x201D; Williamson, who was returning from a weeklong medical conference in South Africa, told the Daily News. &#x201C;While there was a lot of discussion whether to divert the flight, she made the decision for us by saying, &#x2018;Push!&#x2019; And when we checked, the baby was crowning, and she delivered him in two pushes.&quot; Williamson added that she hadn&apos;t delivered a baby since medical school 15 years ago. &#x201C;He nursed right away,&#x201D; said Williamson. &#x201C;And she was a very strong woman &#x2014; never cried, never complained. It was amazing.&#x201D;</p>

<p>The baby, named Mamel Joella, is resting at Jamaica Medical Center with his mom; because he was born outside of U.S. airspace, he will not be an American citizen. Despite the happy ending, this whole situation is probably why doctors <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504151203/http://www.babycenter.com/404_is-it-safe-to-fly-during-my-third-trimester_2599.bc">strongly recommend</a> women shouldn&apos;t fly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504151203/http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/air-travel-during-pregnancy/AN00398">late in their pregnancies</a>: you may not have doctors on your flight!</p>
