<p>Last week, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502142101/http://gothamist.com/tags/prince">Prince</a> and his merry band of purple funkadelic sax blasters&#x2014;the New Power Generation&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502142101/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/23/purple_reign_prince_threw_a_funk_pa.php">played two surprise sets</a> together at City Winery in Tribeca, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502142101/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/26/purple_sunrise_prince_plays_another.php">delighting fans</a> till early in the morning with lengthy, sweaty funk jams. It&apos;s unlikely that you&apos;ll get the opportunity to see Prince in such an intimate setting anytime soon, so savor the excellent video from those shows that Prince has now uploaded to the 3rdEyeGirl YouTube.</p>

<p>If you know anything about Prince, then you know how much he loathes having his music on the internet&#x2014;the man <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502142101/http://news.cnet.com/8301-10784_3-9778087-7.html">has sued YouTube</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502142101/http://www.switched.com/2007/11/07/prince-sues-his-number-one-fans/">fan sites</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502142101/http://news.cnet.com/8301-10784_3-9807555-7.html">even a suburban mom</a>, to get his music off the web. So it&apos;s nice to see him seemingly embracing the internet, joining Twitter, proving he has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502142101/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/18/prince_tweets_amazing_breakfast_can.php">a sense of humor about himself</a>, and posting live videos for the first time over the last few weeks. Maybe he&apos;s finally realized that cameras <em>don&apos;t</em> interfere with his ability to seance with the funk vibes of the universe.</p>
