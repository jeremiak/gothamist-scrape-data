<p>Yesterday we <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429062751/http://gothamist.com/2013/12/26/the_top_10_most_memorable_subway_mo.php">counted down our 10 favorite subway moments of 2013</a>, including subway sharks, spontaneous sax battles, death-defying ollies, happy headbangers and barefoot mamas. But not everything was kittens and selfies: for every person who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429062751/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/19/photo_an_elegant_dining_experience.php">conjured Victorian-era manners</a> while riding, there was someone <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429062751/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/19/photo_lazy_sunday_straphanger_sips.php">sipping Bacardi while sitting cockeyed across the seats</a>. Below, check out 20 bizarre things New Yorkers hauled along with them on the subway in 2013. </p>

<p><strong>Furniture</strong>: Let&apos;s start with something simple. People move all the time, and not everyone wants to hire a U-Haul to carry <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429062751/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/10/whats_worse_bringing_your_motorcycl.php">their chairs</a>, their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429062751/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/11/photo_man_relaxes_on_la-z-boy_chair.php">La-Z-Boys</a> or their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429062751/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/09/photo_dont_take_up_subway_seats_wit.php">antique tables</a>. Of course, couches <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429062751/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/11/photo_this_couch_was_put_on_the_sub.php">are a whole other story.</a></p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="81113couch1.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429062751im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/81113couch1.jpg" width="640" height="478"> <br> <i> Ty (right) and her friend</i></div> <p></p>

<p><strong>Patio Furniture</strong>: But even couches seem reasonable compared to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429062751/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/30/photo_bros_bring_patio_furniture_on.php">entire patio furniture sets.</a></p>

<p><strong>Unwrapped Mattresses</strong>: And patio furniture seems positively civilized compared to the the dude who decided <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429062751/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/30/sure_why_not_use_the_l_train_to_tra.php">to drag his queen sized mattress through the subway.</a></p>

<p><strong>Bags Of Cash</strong>: While we always go for the tried-and-true method of stashing our bundles of cash under our mattress, we can understand why some might be more attracted to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429062751/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/10/video_confident_subway_rider_packs.php">the old &quot;throw it in a garbage bag and haul it around with you at all times&quot; option.</a></p>

<p><strong>Surfboards</strong>: Seeing a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429062751/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/09/subway_surfboard.php">surfboard on the train</a> makes almost no sense.
