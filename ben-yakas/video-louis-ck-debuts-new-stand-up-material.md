<p>Not only does comedian <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405204517/http://gothamist.com/tags/louisck">Louis CK</a> have the balls to repeatedly ask Donald Rumsfeld if <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405204517/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/25/louis_ck_repeatedly_asks_donald_rum.php">he&apos;s a lizard alien</a>, but he truly has a deep and abiding love for the city, and isn&apos;t afraid to let people in on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405204517/http://www.fxnetworks.com/shows/originals/louie/map.php">his favorite NY haunts</a>. Despite his recent fame, he&apos;s also still one of the hardest working comedians we&apos;ve come across&#x2014;every year, he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405204517/http://www.boston.com/ae/tv/articles/2010/06/25/comic_louis_cks_new_show_follows_no_rules__and_thats_how_he_likes_it/">throws out</a> his old material, and forces himself to come up with a brand new set. Last night, he unveiled some of his new jokes on <em>Letterman</em>, during his first <em>Late Show</em> appearance <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405204517/http://www.esquire.com/features/man-at-his-best/q-and-a/louis-ck-interview-0611-2">in 15 years</a>.

<p>And on his FX show <em>Louie</em>, also last night, CK spent an extended trip at the start of the show on the subway&#x2014;and he totally nailed it. His subway experience included watching a violinist perform while a homeless man undresses and washes himself, a young boy trying to convince a young girl to marry him, and a surreal, mysterious bubbling liquid. Considering that the subway really is filled with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405204517/http://gothamist.com/2011/07/22/video_young_lady_tries_to_beat_the.php">pantsless women</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405204517/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/18/video_subway_spaghetti_spat_sparks.php">spaghetti brawlers</a>, and people who put <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405204517/http://gothamist.com/2010/08/10/sad_rat_man.php#photo-1">rats in their mouths</a>, CK&apos;s vision doesn&apos;t sound too far off to us.</p>
