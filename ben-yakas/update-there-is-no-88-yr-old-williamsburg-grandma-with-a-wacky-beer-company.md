<p><strong>[UPDATE Below]</strong> There are a lot of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130704082238/http://www.coolgrandma.com/">cool grandmothers</a> out there, but eccentric Williamsburg native Ethel Goldschmidt may take the bundt cake. After her husband of 60+ years died, the octogenarian has started her own beer company, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130704082238/http://ethelsbrew.com/">Ethel&apos;s Brew</a>, carrying the label &#x201C;go out with a bang.&#x201D; Because wouldn&apos;t you rather have your beer brewed by someone who has been going to Oktoberfest since the 1950s? Below, watch a video in which Ethel narrates how she got to this point:</p>

<p>&quot;It&apos;s not about being blonde or brunette,&quot; Ethel said in a press release. &quot;The girls who have more fun are the ones with my beer. I&apos;m very excited to finally bring my late husband&apos;s dream to life and to start my own beer company.&quot; The brew is described as &quot;a clean, smooth, European-style busty blonde brewed with three different types of malt, is produced from French barley and several varieties of hops.&quot; </p>

<p>Along with the brew comes a very wacky advertising campaign, including the photos above and videos interspersed throughout this post. The best one however is a man-on-the-street interview with some of her Brooklyn neighbors, who talk about spotting Ethel walking down Metropolitan at 3:30 a.m., how much Ethel likes to drink 40s, and according to one woman, how terrible it is that she&apos;s wasting her late husband&apos;s money:</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: Sometimes wacky advertising turns out to be TOO wacky: it seems that Ethel&apos;s Brew and its creator, Ethel Goldschmidt, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130704082238/http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ddb-claims-enigmatic-ethels-brew-beer-launch-160672875.html">are completely made up parts of a make believe ad campaign</a> by advertising agency DDB, created essentially to tout the company&apos;s expertise at successfully being able to make shit up. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130704082238/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/28/ethels_brew_is_a_big_fat_lie_ethel.php">Read more about it here.</a></p>
