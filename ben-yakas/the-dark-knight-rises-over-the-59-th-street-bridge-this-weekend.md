<p>Last weekend, thousands of extras spread out near Wall Street to film some epic battle scenes for obscure indie film <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161345/http://gothamist.com/tags/thedarkknightrises"><em>The Dark Knight Rises</em>.</a> There was gunfire, batwings and appearances from most of the movies&apos; stars&#x2014;and it seems we&apos;re in store for another dose of Batman-ing this weekend. The film <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161345/http://www.ny1.com/content/top_stories/150655/-dark-knight--shoot-to-close-portion-of-59th-street-bridge">will be shooting</a> on the upper level of the span of the 59th Street Bridge until 8 p.m. tonight. It will <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161345/https://twitter.com/?photo_id=1#!/JackRicofficial/status/135248947093577728/photo/1">also be closed</a> for filming tomorrow as well, between 1 a.m. and 8 p.m.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161345/http://www.comicbookmovie.com/fansites/debbiedowner/news/?a=49722">According to ComicBookMovies</a>, one extra passed along an email with some details of what kind of scene will be shot there (small spoiler alert): &quot;You have survived a long time isolated in Gotham City, Dress down in wintery clothing, some work-wear, boots, long trousers and hats and gloves, NOTHING NICE, you should look a bit like refugees.&quot; Below, you can check out a very high quality video from last weekend&apos;s filming, which shows Catwoman (Anne Hathaway) in action:</p>

<p>The 59th Street Bridge, also known as the Ed Koch Queensboro Bridge, has made several famous appearances in popular art before. Our favorites include that indelible poster for Woody Allen&apos;s immortal <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161345/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0o6QKpNK9Cc"><em>Manhattan</em>,</a> F. Scott Fitzgerald&apos;s novel &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; (&quot;The city seen from the Queensboro Bridge,&quot; Nick says, &quot;is always the city seen for the first time, in its first wild promise of all the mystery and the beauty in the world&quot;), and <em>The Simpsons</em> episode &quot;You Only Move Twice&quot; (when Hank Scorpio destroys it to show that he&apos;s not bluffing).</p>

<p>Of course, there&apos;s also the chipper Simon and Garfunkel song <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161345/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLWF2G0XsRA">&quot;The 59th Street Bridge Song (Feelin&apos; Groovy).&quot;</a> Below, listen to the smokey, slowed-down, definitive rendition of &quot;The 59th Street Bridge Song,&quot; performed by Al Kooper and Mike Bloomfield.</p>
