</div></div>					<p>The full details of Tuesday&apos;s harrowing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529134155/http://gothamist.com/2010/08/25/passenger_charged_with_hate_crime_f.php">cabbie stabbing incident</a> have emerged. According to police, Michael Enright, 21, a film student at the School of Visual Arts, was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529134155/http://www.ny1.com/content/top_stories/124409/attacked-muslim-cab-driver-to-meet-with-mayor">&quot;highly intoxicated&quot;</a> when he hailed Ahmed Sharif&apos;s taxi at 6 p.m. that evening. &#x201C;He asked me where I&#x2019;m from. I said Bangladesh. Second question he ask me, are you Muslim? I said yes. Then he tells me &#x2018;assalamu alaikum&apos; [&apos;peace be unto you&apos; in Arabic],&#x201D; Sharif, 43, told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529134155/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2010/08/25/cops-man-stabbed-cabbie-after-asking-if-he-was-muslim/">CBS</a>.</p>

<p>Sharif <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529134155/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/muslim_driver_claims_report_had_Q0XBoYKQbmlzqXMiqydOEK">told</a> police that Enright began ridiculing the Muslim holiday of Ramadan and then started a bizarre, belligerent rant: &#x201C;<strong>This is checkpoint motherfucker. I have to put you down. You have to bring Abdullah to this checkpoint, I have to bring him down, too.</strong>&#x201D; Enright thrust the blade of his Leatherman folding knife through the open window of the cab&apos;s plexiglass partition, ultimately slashing the cab driver across the throat, shoulders, arm, hands and lip. </p>

<p>But Sharif was able to lock Enright in his back seat, abandon his cab and call 911. An officer on patrol nearby arrived to find Mr. Enright <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529134155/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703632304575452082357090808.html?mod=WSJ_NY_MIDDLELEADNewsCollection">sprawled out on the street</a>, having fallen after climbing out one of the cab&apos;s back windows. &quot;I saw on his face so much hate and so upset, the anger at me, because of my religion. And it&apos;s a shock to me,&quot; said Sharif. At Enright&apos;s arraignment yesterday, Manhattan Assistant District Attorney James Zaleta said, &quot;The EMT on the scene said if the cut had been any longer or deeper he [Sharif] would have been dead on the scene...<strong>This was a highly vicious attack on an innocent person based on his religion.&quot;</strong></p>

<p>Enright, who grew up in Brewster, a small village in Putnam County, was charged with second-degree attempted murder as a hate crime, first-degree assault as a hate crime and criminal possession of a weapon and faces up to 25 years in prison if convicted. At his arraignment, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529134155/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/26/nyregion/26cabby.html?_r=1&amp;ref=nyregion">his lawyer Jason A. Martin said</a>, &#x201C;He&#x2019;s terrified. He&#x2019;s shocked at the allegations. He&#x2019;s just trying to cope with it right now.&#x201D; </p>

<p>Cops <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529134155/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/muslim_driver_claims_report_had_Q0XBoYKQbmlzqXMiqydOEK">believe</a> he was intoxicated at the time of his arrest, and a city official briefed on the investigation said there was an empty bottle of Scotch in his backpack. A police source <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529134155/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/08/26/2010-08-26_untitled__2cab26m.html">said</a> he also had a personal diary filled with pages of &quot;pretty strong anti-Muslim comments&quot; with him, and that the journal equated Muslims with &quot;killers, ungrateful for the help they were being offered, filthy murderers without a conscience.&quot;</p>
