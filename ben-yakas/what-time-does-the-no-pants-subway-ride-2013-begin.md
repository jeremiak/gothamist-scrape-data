<p>The annual <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130114083950/http://gothamist.com/tags/nopantssubwayride">No Pants Subway Ride</a>&#x2014;that festive-if-contrived occasion that encourages pants-hating New Yorkers to bum-rush the subways and pants-hating haters to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130114083950/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/07/destroy_the_date_no_pants_subway_ri.php">get all riled up about it</a>&#x2014;is happening today starting at 3 p.m. It&apos;s important information to know in case you want to avoid the hordes of pantsless straphangers&#x2014;or, ya know, if you want to drop trou and join in. Organizers may be facing a shortage of skinny legs this year thanks to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130114083950/http://gothamist.com/tags/flu">the flu epidemic</a>. Will fear of catching a communicable disease keep the unpantsed masses from turning up? Please?</p>

<p>Either way, you can get <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130114083950/http://improveverywhere.com/2013/01/07/no-pants-subway-ride-2013-details-for-new-york/">all the relevant information about the event here.</a> As always, people are encouraged to leave their cameras at home&#x2014;but since some of you are obviously not going to do that, you should feel free to send pics to tips@gothamist.com, or tag them as &quot;Gothamist&quot; on Flickr. </p>
