Police Officer Anthony Rodriguez, 27, was suspended following the incident, which took place near 183rd St. around 3 a.m. on Thanksgiving. Rodriguez refused a breathalyzer test, but officers noticed his speech was slurred and his eyes were bloodshot. According <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140520151041/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/bronx/drunk_cop_second_arrest_OrRAk0HHUWGGljPJBf5caI?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">to the Post</a>, Rodriguez pleaded guilty earlier this month to drunkenly resisting arrest at a Mets-Padres game in June.
