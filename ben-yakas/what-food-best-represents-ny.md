<p>Cat photo aficionados I Can Has Cheezburger took some time out of their busy schedule of posting pictures of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504170117/http://icanhascheezburger.com/2011/01/13/funny-pictures-nut-gud-enuff-lolcat/">semi-incomprehensible</a> lolcats to post <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504170117/http://noms.icanhascheezburger.com/2011/01/12/funny-food-photos-food-by-state/">Food By State</a>, a picture-graphic tutorial that gives each state an edible representation. Some of them make sense (California=Grapes), some are bizarre (Utah=Green Jell-o), and some are too true (Nevada=Buffets). NY was represented by pizza, and although Supreme Court Judge Antonin Scalia would probably <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504170117/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/04/justice_scalia_issues_decision_on_n.php">agree with</a> their assessment, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504170117/http://gothamist.com/2010/12/15/how_new_york_eats.php">others</a> might ask, &quot;but what about our <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504170117/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/13/jay-z_enters_chicken_biz.php">chicken wings</a>, or our <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504170117/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/05/williamsburg_1.php">all organic</a> bodegas? Shouldn&apos;t we have a rainbow-colored flag of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504170117/http://gothamist.com/2010/06/30/map_where_to_eat_what.php">different ethnic foods</a>?&quot; But it comes down to the triangle: do you think pizza is really <em>the</em> quintessential NY food?</p>
