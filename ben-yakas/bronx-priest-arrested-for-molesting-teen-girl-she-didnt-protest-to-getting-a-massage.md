Father Jaime Duenas, 87, was arraigned on charges of sexual abuse, forcible touching and endangering the welfare of the 16-year-old girl. And according to prosecutors, he gave this excuse in his cell before his arraignment last night: <strong>&quot;She didn&apos;t protest to getting a massage...She was wearing short skirts.&quot;</strong><p></p>

<p>Duenas was arrested inside the rectory of the Church of the Blessed Lady in Eastchester yesterday afternoon.
