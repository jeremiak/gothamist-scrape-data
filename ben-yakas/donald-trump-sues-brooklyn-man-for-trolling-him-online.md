<p>Generally speaking, being labeled a troll is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604151036/http://gawker.com/5992261/the-20-best-trollings-in-modern-history/gallery/1">not a particularly positive thing</a>&#x2014;but when someone is actively trolling <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604151036/http://gothamist.com/tags/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> from his mother&apos;s basement and successfully pissing him off, it doesn&apos;t seem like such a negative title. And that&apos;s essentially what Brooklyn resident J. Taikwok Yung has been doing for the last six years, buying up various domain names that include &quot;Trump&quot; and posting identical sites &quot;parodying&quot; Trump. &quot;Yung is as brazen and unrepentant a cybersquatter as one might find,&quot; Trump&apos;s lawyers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604151036/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/trump-sues-b-klyn-man-400k-websites-article-1.1303096?localLinksEnabled=false">declared in papers filed this week</a> in Brooklyn Federal Court.</p>

<p>Trump is suing Yung, a 33-year-old &quot;self-described hacker and full-time schlub&quot; who lives in Canarsie with his mother in a two-bedroom apartment, for $400K in damages. Yung&apos;s legal fight with Trump started in 2007 when Yung registered four domain names&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604151036/http://trumpindia.com/in/">trumpindia.com</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604151036/http://trumpbeijing.com/cn/">trumpbeijing.com</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604151036/http://trumpmumbai.com/dn/">trumpmumbai.com</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604151036/http://trumpabudhabi.com/rn/">trumpabudhabi.com</a>&#x2014;shortly after Trump&apos;s son Eric announced plans to build hotels and condos in southeast Asia. Trump&apos;s legal team offered him $100 each for the domains, which he rejected; they subsequently took their case to the World Intellectual Property Organization, which ultimately ruled against Yung.</p>

<p>Yung doesn&apos;t specialize in just mocking Trump though&#x2014;he&apos;s collected nearly 200 domain names, including ones related to Merrill Lynch and Bank of America. But he has a particular love for trolling Trump, because, as he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604151036/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/trump-sues-b-klyn-man-400k-websites-article-1.1303096?localLinksEnabled=false">told the Daily News</a>, he once loved Trump and saw himself as an &quot;amateur Trumpster.&quot; He&apos;s since become disillusioned with his one-time hero though: &quot;It&apos;s hypocrisy,&quot; Yung said of Trump&apos;s legal attacks on him. &quot;He promoted the art of the deal and doesn&apos;t practice any of that.&quot;</p>

<p>Now, let&apos;s not mince words: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604151036/http://trumpindia.com/in/">Yung&apos;s parody sites</a> aren&apos;t particularly interesting or biting, mostly filled with some Trump parody videos from YouTube. They don&apos;t even seem to have been updated in almost two years (the last post is all about the &quot;abysmal drop&quot; in ratings for <em>Celebrity Apprentice</em>). And we imagine Trump has probably never seen the sites himself, as he has much more important things to do, like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604151036/http://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-nymag-twitter-rant-2013-3">rail against NY Magazine</a> or re-tweet <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604151036/https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/318076170862215168">people</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604151036/https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/317936116428840960">complimenting</a> him <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604151036/https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/317932478444761088">again</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604151036/https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/317752297574760448">again</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604151036/https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/318082677523759104">again.</a></p>
