                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="122813kanye.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20140205202605im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/122813kanye.jpg" width="640" height="479"> <br> <i> Uh huh honey</i></div> <p></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140205202605/http://gothamist.com/tags/kanyewest">Kanye West</a> has had a hell of a year being very Kanye West-y: he released the best album of the year (also his angriest album), he fought photographers and Jimmy Kimmel, he inspired the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140205202605/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRckgn36lzY">best music video of the year</a>, he grossed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140205202605/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/paul-mccartney-kanye-west-top-billboards-hot-tours-tally-20131227">over $25 million on tour</a>, he got engaged to Kim Kardashian and had a baby, and he generally was America&apos;s most beloved megalomaniac. But during the final <em>Yeezus</em> tour stop in Toronto this week, he revealed a shocking new year&apos;s resolution: to be less Kanye West-y in 2014. Savor the 27 minute rant below, because it may be his last for awhile.</p>

<p>&quot;Everything I&apos;m saying that&apos;s not allowed, soak it in right now. This might be the last time y&apos;all hear me talk s--t for a long time,&quot; West said during the now-ritual &quot;Runaway&quot; rant section of the show. &quot;Might be another, like, six months. At least. You&apos;re just gonna have to run back the interviews and s--t if you wanna hear some realness...I&apos;m gonna tell y&apos;all right now: All of the ideas, the things they call rants...save those tapes and everything, because I&apos;ve decided to completely focus everything in 2014 on all the new ideas, all the creative outlets.&quot;</p>

<p>Do we really want to live in a world where Kanye West isn&apos;t encouraged to be as Kanye West as he wants to be? As we noted <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140205202605/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/20/photos_videos_kanye_west_barclays_c.php#photo-2">when we saw West at Barclays Center last month</a>, that&apos;s how we want him: complaining that nobody believes in him while also basking in the glory of knowing everyone at his shows loves him. Talking about how much he hates being pigeon-holed, while over-sharing in exactly the way we expect.</p>

<p>Who knows if the vow of silence will last, but we don&apos;t really see any need for him to change: whether you think he speaks truth to power or he&apos;s an incoherent scatterbrain, he <em>is</em> the greatest rapper alive. As long as he keeps making music as powerful, fearless and muscular as <em>Yeezus</em>, he can rail all he wants about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140205202605/http://gawker.com/i-will-die-for-what-s-in-my-heart-kanye-west-in-his-562700648">his trendsetting abilities.</a></p>
