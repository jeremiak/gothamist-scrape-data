<p>Director Jason Reitman has been staging star-studded live readings of classic films around L.A. for years now, from <em> Reservoir Dogs</em> to <em>The Big Lebowski</em> to <em>American Beauty.</em> His latest event is one close to our hearts: next Thursday, Reitman will stage a reading of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501174827/http://gothamist.com/tags/woodyallen">Woody Allen&apos;s</a> classic <em>Manhattan</em> at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. &#x201C;From the onset of the Live-Read series, we wanted to hit all the major writers and Woody Allen is simply one of the greatest screenwriters of all time,&#x201D; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501174827/http://insidemovies.ew.com/2012/11/09/jason-reitman-woody-allen-manhattan-live-read/">Reitman told EW</a>. &quot;If you&#x2019;re going to make a series based on dialogue, you can&#x2019;t find much better than Woody Allen.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Reitman explained he chose <em>Manhattan</em> over <em>Annie Hall</em> and <em>Crimes and Misdemeanors</em> because of &quot;how few characters there are and the way it uses the city.&#x201D; He also explained its mass appeal beyond neurotic, nebbish New Yorkers: &quot;It&#x2019;s also a perfect movie for both those who live in New York, and outsiders who are fascinated by it. Diane Keaton is a transplant, new to the city, versus Woody Allen who is the most obvious native. <strong>He is the picture they would put in biology book if you needed a diagram of a New Yorker.</strong>&#x201D;</p>

<p>Earlier this year, Reitman staged a reading of <em>The Apartment</em>  at the TimesCenter in Manhattan, a few months after he staged it in L.A. So maybe there&apos;s hope he&apos;ll bring <em>Manhattan</em> to its namesake early next year. As for who will be in it, Shailene Woodley (the future Mary Jane Watson) will play Mariel Hemingway&apos;s Oscar nominated Tracy, Fred Savage will play Yale, Mae Whitman will play Yale&apos;s wife, Erika Christensen will play ex-wife Jill, and <em>The League&apos;s</em> Jason Mantzoukas will play Dennis. Reitman hasn&apos;t said who will play Woody and Diane Keaton yet, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501174827/http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/04/03/jason-reitmans-live-read-series-to-bring-the-apartment-to-new-york-this-month/">it&apos;ll likely be two big names</a>&#x2014;just imagine the sparks flying between <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501174827/http://gothamist.com/2012/09/19/photos_first_look_at_woody_allens_l.php#photo-1">Andrew Dice Clay</a> and Lindsay Lohan in the scene below:</p>
