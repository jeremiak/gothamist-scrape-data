</div></div>					<p><strong>[Update Below]</strong> The magical horse dog you can see in the photos above was spotted on the R train today by one tipster: &quot;It was weird as hell,&quot; they told us. &quot;She got on at Union Square where I was. I got off at Prince. I took a bunch of pics&#x2014;have some of her on the platform with that beast too.&quot; If you saw a magical creature stumbling around our urban jungle, wouldn&apos;t you do anything you could to capture its essence too?</p>

<p>According <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430052648/http://www.mta.info/nyct/rules/rules.htm">to the MTA</a>, no animals are allowed on the subway &quot;unless enclosed in a container and carried in a manner which would not annoy other passengers.&quot; Even if you&apos;re holding it in your arms, cops have been known to arrest people: in one high-profile incident, commuter Chrissie Brodigan <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430052648/http://gothamist.com/2009/06/30/woman_says_misogynistic_cop_arreste.php">was arrested in 2009</a> for not having her pug restrained in a bag (because it was sick and she was carrying it). </p>

<p>The only other exception to the MTA&apos;s rule are service animals (which &quot;does not include a therapy animal or animal used for emotional support&quot;). This dog pictured here does have a neck collar with handle, but the tipster didn&apos;t seem convinced it was servicey:</p>

<blockquote>It didn&apos;t seem like a service dog to me. No sign on it or a typical type of service dog handle. She sure wasn&apos;t blind. She was just holding it on a leash, but it did have some sort of neck collar that had a handle on it too. 

<p>No one seemed scared because the dog was pretty chill but everyone, and I mean just about everyone, on the car was looking like, &quot;what the fuck is that huge ass dog doing on the train?&quot; When people got on and off I would say they tried give themselves a wide berth. </p>

<p>How did it even get through the turnstile?</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>Whether or not it was or wasn&apos;t a service dog, what we&apos;d really like to know is why this lady is taking mass transit <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430052648/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adBmLtE4wwg">when her dog can obviously FLY?</a></p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: Thanks to a couple readers, we now know the woman in the photos is Estelle &quot;Cissy&quot; Stamm, co-founder of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430052648/https://www.facebook.com/pages/New-York-Area-Assistance-Dogs/193923094060201">New York Area Assistance Dogs</a>; and the adorable 120 pound service dog is Wargas. Stamm <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430052648/http://gothamist.com/2009/01/05/woman_sues_nyc_transit_over_giant_d.php">previously was awarded $10,000 from the city</a> after two policemen gave her a ticket for bringing the dog into a subway station. </p>

<p>She sued NYC Transit for $10 million after that because, as stated above, the MTA still doesn&apos;t recognize certain kinds of service animals (&quot;does not include a therapy animal or animal used for emotional support&quot;). Stamm <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430052648/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/woman-sues-10m-denied-subway-rides-dog-article-1.420230">has previously said</a> that the &quot;dog protects her from childhood memories of sex abuse.&quot; In a comment on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430052648/http://thepoodleanddogblog.typepad.com/the_poodle_and_dog_blog/2009/01/woman-sues-for-10m-for-being-denied-subway-rides-with-dog.html">the Poodle and Dog Blog</a>, she expanded upon this:</p>

<blockquote>I&apos;ve used a task trained service dog for 12 years to mitigate the effects of PTSD and a hearing impairment. My dogs are well trained and we have never been asked to leave a place of public accommodation because of their behavior. If there were any evidence that my dogs posed as danger to people on the transit system, that would have been a part of their defense, and they could move to ban me from the system. Nowhere is that allegation made. And the public&apos;s protection is that it is perfectly legal to eject a person with a service dog if that dog is posing a direct threat or danger. If you&apos;ll note, buried in the article is the report of an incident during which I was physically threatened. My service dog was lying at my feet and behaved as she was trained to do; she didn&apos;t even raise an eyebrow much less get up and take on a defensive position.</blockquote>
