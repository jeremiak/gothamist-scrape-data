										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="32611boob.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150601011114im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/32611boob.jpg" width="240" height="196" class="image-left"> </span>For Real Housewives and porn stars, it&apos;s practically part of their professions. Sexy banker had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150601011114/http://gothamist.com/2010/06/09/sexy_banker_had_two_boob_jobs.php">two of them</a> in hopes of transforming herself into &quot;Tits on a stick.&quot; But it seems that everyone in America is into boob jobs...except maybe when they get <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150601011114/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/02/si_mom_says_plastic_surgeon_gave_he.php">four breasts</a> out of it.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150601011114/http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/03/21/a-decade-of-boosting-breast-size/?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">new data</a> released by the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, breast implant operations have increased 40 percent in the past decade, and nearly 300,000 women had a boob job done last year. But when you consider that huge breast implants could <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150601011114/http://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/10/03/bulgarian_airbags/">save your life</a> in a car accident, it all kind of makes sense, doesn&apos;t it?</p>

<p>Interestingly, while nearly 90,000 had breast lifts last year, nearly the same amount had surgery to reduce breast size as well. While breast enhancement surgeries have increased, nose jobs, liposuction and lip augmentation are all on the decline. Botox is on the rise though: 5.4 million people received injections in 2010, up a staggering 584 percent from 2000. Overall, women account for 91 percent of cosmetic procedures. And the other nine percent are Sly Stallone. </p>
