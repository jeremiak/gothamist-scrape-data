<p>Omerta&apos;s be damned: John Gotti Jr. is really going forward with plans to bring his life story to the big screen. And while Gotti may have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412172316/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/22/deadlock_don_making_a_movie_about_h.php">envisioned</a> Sylvester Stallone directing it initially, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412172316/http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118029067">Variety reports</a> that Nick Cassavetes is in talks to direct now. And who would be better than Cassavetes, the auteur behind movies such as &quot;The Notebook,&quot; &quot;My Sister&apos;s Keeper,&quot; and &quot;Alpha Dog,&quot; to bring the story of the Gambino crime family to life? </p>

<p>Then again, according to Gotti, &quot;this is not a mob story. That&apos;s one misconception. This is a father-son story.&quot; As long as they can find a part for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412172316/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/22/deadlock_don_making_a_movie_about_h.php">Paulie Walnuts</a>, we&apos;ll hold out hope for the movie.</p>
