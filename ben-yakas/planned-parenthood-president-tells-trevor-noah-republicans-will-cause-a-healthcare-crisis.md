<p>With Republicans having already begun <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508061254/http://gothamist.com/2017/01/12/affordable_care_act_repeal_vote.php">the process of gutting Obamacare</a>, Cecile Richards, president of Planned Parenthood, was on the Daily Show last night to try to cut through the mistruths and confusion around the organization. Richards explained what health services are actually reimbursed by the government, and discussed Paul Ryan&apos;s vow to defund PP. </p>

<p>&quot;I really do think it&apos;s a matter of folks in Washington [understanding] that women&apos;s need for health care, it&apos;s not a partisan issue,&quot; she said. &quot;And that&apos;s what I think women are so perplexed about&#x2014;why are people playing politics with women&apos;s health care in America? The women who come to Planned Parenthood, they are Democrats, Republicans, Independents, they&apos;re not coming to make a political statement, they&apos;re coming because they need high-equality affordable health care, and that&apos;s what we provide.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It&apos;s not only that [Republican leadership] want to end access to Planned Parenthood, they want end access to care for a lot of folks in this country, and I believe it is going to cause a healthcare crisis,&quot; she added, advocating for people to call their senators and congressman to fight the plan.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508061254/http://jezebel.com/planned-parenthoods-cecile-richards-says-demand-for-iud-1791025113">separate interview</a> on CNN earlier this week, Richards said that there has been a 900 percent increase in women trying to get into Planned Parenthood to get an IUD: &#x201C;Because they&#x2019;re desperately concerned that they might lose their access to healthcare and they know that Planned Parenthood is the place that can provide it.&quot; You can watch that interview below.</p>
