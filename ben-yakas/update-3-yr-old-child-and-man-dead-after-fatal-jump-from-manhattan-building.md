A witness told them the boy was wearing Christmas pajamas: &quot;They were pumping his chest and working on him, and nothing,&quot; said Luis Ortiz, who was at St. Luke&#x2019;s Roosevelt Hospital, at the time. &quot;You could tell he was slipping away. They said the father was up there, but they didn&#x2019;t bring anyone else in. It was just heartbreaking.&quot;</p>
