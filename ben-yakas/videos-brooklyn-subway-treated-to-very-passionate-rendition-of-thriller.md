<p>We may be sticklers for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150314023232/http://gothamist.com/tags/subwayetiquette">subway etiquette</a>, but we&apos;re not above recognizing passion when it is literally screaming in our face and won&apos;t stop. To that end, we bring you the man in the videos below, who was spotted singing Michael Jackson&apos;s &quot;Thriller,&quot; Survivor&apos;s &quot;Eye Of The Tiger&quot; and The Wanted &quot;Glad You Came&quot; on a 4 train in Brooklyn this week. Are you impressed by his enthusiasm, or do you feel a kinship with the red bearded man sitting next to him, who seems to be fantasizing about punching him?</p>

<p>Some are already assuming this is staged, but the uploader writes: &quot;Honestly, no staging here. this guy just kept singing and dancing. I have a fourth video from the series where he sings &quot;moves like jagger&quot; but it&apos;s ruined by someone yelling at him the whole time.&quot; Either way, it&apos;s still better than <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150314023232/http://gothamist.com/2012/09/11/subway_etiquette_the_subway_is_not.php">subway bowling</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150314023232/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/11/please_stop_with_the_subway_dance_p.php">platform dance parties.</a> Check out the other two songs below.</p>
