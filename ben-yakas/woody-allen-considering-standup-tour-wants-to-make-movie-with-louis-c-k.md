<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501174753/http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/07/17/woody-allen-standup-guy/">NY Times sat down</a> with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501174753/http://gothamist.com/tags/woodyallen">Woody Allen</a> in the lead up to the release of his newest film, <em>Blue Jasmine</em>, and they learned that he has been inspired by working with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501174753/http://gothamist.com/tags/louisck">Louis C.K.</a> Allen told them that he wants to write a movie specifically for the two of them&#x2014;and he also said that he is considering doing a standup tour!</p>

<p>Allen said he wasn&apos;t familiar with C.K.&apos;s work before he saw the sketch above (with fellow <em>Blue Jasmine</em> star Bobby Cannavale). &quot;He&#x2019;s clearly such a sweet guy,&quot; Allen said, noting he wasn&apos;t right for the role that ended up going to Andrew Dice Clay. (CK <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501174753/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/05/woody_allen_told_louis_ck_he_was_to.php">has discussed this before</a>.) &quot;<strong>I&#x2019;d love to do a movie with him and me, a comedy. I&#x2019;m looking for some idea that would work, for the two of us to do.</strong>&quot; This sounds incredibly exciting, although we&apos;re a little scarred from the on-paper perfect team-up of Larry David and Allen in <em>Whatever Works</em>; maybe Woody could just make an appearance in season 4 of <em>Louie</em>?</p>

<p>Either way, this C.K. project won&apos;t be his next film: he reveals that he&apos;s already written that one, and it is &quot;a perfect movie for Colin Firth and Emma Stone, so that&#x2019;s what I did.&quot; As for his own standup, Allen said he was inspired after seeing the 85-year-old Mort Sahl. &quot;Since I saw him, I&#x2019;ve just been toying with the idea,&quot; Allen said. <strong>&quot;I would love to see if I could. Just getting together an hour of stuff to talk about would be a lot of work.&quot;</strong> Something tells us he&apos;ll have no problem coming up with the material.<br>
