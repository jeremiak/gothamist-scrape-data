<p>A man jumped in front of the Q train during rush hour in Brooklyn yesterday. According to police, the incident happened around 6:26 p.m. at the Church Avenue B/Q train station. They say the man jumped in front of a Manhattan-bound Q train; he was removed from beneath the train and taken to Kings County Hospital. &#x201C;He was standing right there and he jumped,&#x201D; one eyewitness <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130619011653/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/survived-homeless-man-jumps-front-q-train-lives-article-1.1238663?localLinksEnabled=false">told the News</a>. &#x201C;It was crazy.&quot;</p>

<p>&#x201C;They got him out by putting these air bags under the train and lifting,&quot; the witness added. &quot;He was still alive. I can&apos;t believe he survived.&#x201D; According to police, he was taken to the hospital in critical condition, and listed as &quot;likely to die.&quot; The victim has not been identified yet, but the News does refer to him as a &quot;homeless man.&quot; FDNY adds that he is in his 30s.</p>
