<p>Last Week Tonight (aka &quot;<em>Ballers</em> for weak insecure people&quot;) isn&apos;t back on HBO until September 25th, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021124820/http://gothamist.com/tags/johnoliver">John Oliver</a> has a civic duty to keep <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021124820/http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2016/04/late-night-comedy/475485/">eviscerating worthy targets</a> even when he&apos;s on vacation (and even when the entire country is on vacation). </p>

<p>To that end, Oliver proposed some ideas on how to build off of the rule that one shouldn&apos;t wear white after Labor Day&#x2014;like ending the scourge of winking. &quot;A wink is a gesture that is somehow both deeply sexual and incredibly unsexy, like licking a pine cone,&quot; he reasons. Check it out below.</p>
