<p>Multiple attacks on Jews in Brooklyn have led police to investigate whether they are part of an ongoing series of hate crimes&#x2014;or whether they&apos;re just random attacks by teens playing a game called &quot;knockout.&quot; Police Commissioner Ray Kelly told reporters yesterday that there have been at least seven attacks on Jews in Crown Heights recently, including two misdemeanor assaults: &#x201C;It is difficult to tell [if it is a pattern] at this time,&#x201D; Kelly said, noting that the Hate Crimes Task Force was now investigating. &#x201C;Obviously, some of it is based on descriptions. The crowds change in size, so it&#x2019;s hard to tell if it is a clear pattern.&#x201D;</p>

<p>The most recent attacked occurred around 9:30 p.m. on Sunday evening on Kingston Avenue near Crown Street. A 19-year-old Jewish man was crossing the street when he was punched in the face by a man in a group of about 10 black males, all in their late teens and early 20s. &#x201C;He was actually holding an expensive camera. And they punched him and nothing was stolen,&#x201D; Rabbi Yaacov Behrman, the executive director of the Jewish Future Alliance, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150307233329/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2013/11/12/brooklyn-rabbi-gang-of-teens-playing-disturbing-game-of-knock-out-the-jew/">told CBS</a>. You can see video of that assault below, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150307233329/http://crownheights.info/crime/410596/video-attempted-knockout-assault-caught-on-survailence/">courtesy of Crown Heights.info</a>. The punch can be seen in the video at the :13, :41 and :48 second marks.</p>

<p>Brooklyn Assemblyman Dov Hikind <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150307233329/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2013/11/12/brooklyn-rabbi-gang-of-teens-playing-disturbing-game-of-knock-out-the-jew/">said the attacks</a> aren&apos;t about stealing anything&#x2014;they&apos;re just anti-Semitic. Behrman agrees: &#x201C;And they&#x2019;re playing a game: &#x2018;knockout.&#x2019; &#x2018;Knock out the Jew,&#x2019; maybe. And they&#x2019;re going around the neighborhood punching Jews.&quot; </p>

<p>This &quot;knockout&quot; game&#x2014;in which teens sucker punch strangers on the street&#x2014;has apparently been growing in popularity over the last year, as you can see in the video below. But it&apos;s unclear whether the game specifically targets Jewish people; attacking people for fun has long been a popular pastime among our nation&#x2019;s poorly supervised teens.</p>
