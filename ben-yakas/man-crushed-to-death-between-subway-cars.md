The victim was on a Bronx-bound 6 train near 96th street just before 4 a.m. Saturday morning when he was crushed to death on the tracks. <p></p>

<p>The man, described as between 30 and 40, didn&apos;t have any identification on him, and was trying to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429071648/http://gothamist.com/2007/03/06/between_subway.php">cross cars on the train</a> when he lost balance and fell through. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429071648/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/09/12/2010-09-12_subway_rider_falls_between_cars_and_is_killed.html">Witnesses told police</a> his body was dragged underneath the train before the subway conductor realized what had happened; the train&apos;s emergency break, which is supposed to be triggered if anything is on the track, didn&apos;t go off. </p>

According to the Post, transit union officials say there has been an unusually high number of people jumping or falling on the city&apos;s subway tracks this year. </p>
