Melisa Jackson is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130416054315/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/13/nyregion/13ems.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">charged</a> with a single misdemeanor count of official misconduct for not treating victim Eutisha Rennix, who died after a chronic asthma attack. Prosecutors allege to know the real reason why Jackson called 911 instead of staying to help the woman: &quot;The reason she couldn&apos;t stay is <strong>Ms. Jackson sneaked out of work where she was supposed to be manning a dispatch terminal</strong>,&quot; said ADA Kevin Richardson at the arraignment.<p></p>

<p>Prosecutors believe Jackson snuck out while on duty to meet her EMT boyfriend, Jason Green, who was on an authorized break (he was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130416054315/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/19/nypd_says_emts_murder_not_linked_to.php">killed</a> during an unrelated shootout in SoHo in July). She was scared of getting caught, so she fled, and was derelict of her obligation to provide medical attention. Jackson&apos;s lawyer argued that his client was the only person in the store who did anything to aid Rennix. He also argued that Rennix had refused to go to a hospital earlier, because she needed the hours at work. The family of Rennix <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130416054315/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/emt_rap_in_gal_death_Odw9QbhCn8ijEBX5Q8dDsL?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">refuted those claims</a>: &quot;To try to blame the victim for the failure of a trained emergency medical technician to do their duty is an outrage.&quot;</p>
