<p>There are but a few things that Americans can truly agree on: <em>Seinfeld</em>, brunch, cheerleaders, our constitution-given right to sue anyone over anything, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140423145337/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/30/america_best_condiment.php">mayonnaise</a>, antipathy for Shia LeBeouf, and the <em>Fast and Furious</em> film series. But the number one thing that Americans can unite about? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140423145337/http://gothamist.com/tags/pizza">Pizza</a>. </p>

<p>According to the government&apos;s National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey &quot;What We Eat in America,&quot; <strong>1 in 8 Americans &quot;consumed pizza on any given day.&quot;</strong> That amount increases to 1 in 4 when looking at American males aged 6-19. Pizza provides one-fourth of total daily energy for people when they eat it&#x2014;pizza is literally jet fuel for Freedom. So the next time you feel a wave of patriotism wash over you, you don&apos;t have to drape yourself in an American flag&#x2014;you&apos;d do your country proud to spritz yourself in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140423145337/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/30/pizza_perfume.php">pizza perfume</a>.</p>
