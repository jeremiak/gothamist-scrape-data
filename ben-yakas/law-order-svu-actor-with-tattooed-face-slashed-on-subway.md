<p>An actor with a tattooed face was slashed on a train in lower Manhattan this weekend.</p>

<p>The incident happened on Saturday evening, when 31-year-old Douglas Drucker, who played a gang leader on an episode of <em>Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit</em>, got aboard a southbound E train around 6 p.m. &quot;I was listening to music, in my own world. This guy comes through the cars while the train is moving,&quot; Drucker <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016021448/http://nypost.com/2016/10/12/law-order-actor-attacked-on-subway/">told the Post.</a></p>

<p>The man, whom Drucker said was shoeless and had bleeding feet, made eye contact with him and snapped, &quot;What the fuck are you looking at.&quot; As the train pulled into the World Trade Center station, Drucker walked away, but the suspect followed him. &quot;I was trying to play it cool, but then I realized he was out of his mind,&quot; Drucker <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016021448/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/exclusive-law-order-actor-slashed-subway-article-1.2827040">told the Daily News</a>. &quot;He was like pacing back and forth, and he came out with a knife.&quot; The man punched him in the back of the head, and slashed him with the knife on the left hand and on the left shoulder.</p>

<p>The slasher then fled the scene. Drucker was treated for his lacerations. Police describe the suspect as around 40 years old and approximately 6 feet tall, and was last seen wearing a black hat, long sleeved shirt, and blue jeans with a black backpack. An NYPD spokesperson said no arrests have been made and the investigation is ongoing.</p>

<p>Drucker, who works part time at &quot;Ripley&#x2019;s Believe it or Not!&quot; in Times Square, told the News that he has some sympathy for his attacker: &quot;A lot of times, I&apos;m playing the bad guy &#x2014; I understood where he was coming from in a way.&quot;</p>
