<p>It feels like its been quite awhile since one of those epic <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429120523/http://gothamist.com/tags/kanyewest">Kanye West</a> Twitter rants/meltdowns of yore (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429120523/http://gadgets.boingboing.net/2008/06/25/kanye-west-rant-was.html">&quot;I&#x2019;m typing so fucking hard I might break my fucking Mac book Air!!!!!!!!&quot;</a>)&#x2014;but with West dating Kim Kardashian, it was only a matter of time. And lo and behold, West <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429120523/https://twitter.com/kanyewest">took to Twitter</a> this afternoon to contemplate and question the meaning of the word &quot;bitch&quot; after he got some complaints about his new ode to Kim, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429120523/http://www.tmz.com/2012/08/07/kanye-west-kim-kardashian-perfect-bitch/">&#x201C;Perfect Bitch.&#x201D;</a> As West puts it: &quot;Feelings are the only facts.&quot;</p>
