In it, he discussed the fallout from his new relationship with Traci Johnson, and moving into the house of his agent, where he said they were hiding out in his attic. <strong>&quot;Lep&#x2019;s Jewish, and it was like a reverse Anne Frank thing,&quot;</strong> he said.<p></p>

<p>Of course, only the most dedicated of Anne Frank scholars knows that Frank was hiding out from Nazis because she too had dumped her eight-months-pregnant wife for a 23-year-old former NBC intern. Here&apos;s the entire excerpt the quote comes from:</p>

<blockquote>Barber and Johnson went into hiding in the attic of Lepselter&#x2019;s house in New Jersey. &#x201C;Lep&#x2019;s Jewish,&#x201D; says Barber, &#x201C;and it was like a reverse Anne Frank thing.&#x201D; (Here is Barber writ small: He has the wit and smarts to make an Anne Frank allusion and the artlessness to liken himself&#x2014;an adulterer trying to elude gossip columnists&#x2014;to a Holocaust victim.)</blockquote>

<p>MSNBC sounds bemusedly horrified: &quot;Yowza. Not so sure about the smarts, however.&quot; The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111013154643/http://www.nypost.com/p/sports/giants/tasteless_tiki_VgoV055eG1W8NCF6bbwE8J">Post calls it</a> &quot;despicable,&quot;  and credits him with his &quot;gift for saying exactly the wrong thing almost every time he opens his mouth.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111013154643/http://deadspin.com/5805181/tortured-analogy-leads-tiki-barber-to-declare-himself-a-reverse-anne-frank">Deadspin asks</a> the really tough questions though: &quot;who are the reverse Nazis?&quot; (History buffs know them as the cuddly, fun-loving Sizan army.)</p>

<p>Back in March, after the scandal had broke, he had lost his NBC job, was barred from his babies&apos; birth, and was sued by cycling fitness chain Flywheel Sports, Barber announced that he was planning to unretire from the NFL. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111013154643/http://content.usatoday.com/communities/thehuddle/post/2011/05/tiki-barber-credits-24-year-old-girlfriend-for-sparking-nfl-comeback/1">He credited</a> his new girlfriend with inspiring him to start playing again; Johnson added, &quot;It was tough for him to just be motivated to get dressed and do something productive with his life, instead of just sitting home with the puppies.&quot; We wonder if Anne Frank had as tough a time getting motivated when she was just sitting in her attic, playing with her puppies.</p>
