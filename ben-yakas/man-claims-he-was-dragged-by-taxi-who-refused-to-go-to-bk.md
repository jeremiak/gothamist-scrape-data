</div></div>					<p>Last week, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150223101728/http://gothamist.com/2010/10/17/brooklyn_bridge_construction_causin.php">we wondered</a> whether all the construction on the Brooklyn Bridge was causing taxi drivers to boycott trips to Brooklyn. Today, we received a tip from reader Jerrell Horton, describing just such an experience he claims he had last night. He allegedly hailed a yellow cab in Manhattan after leaving <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150223101728/http://gothamist.com/2009/10/23/greenhouse_shut_down_after_stabbing.php">Greenhouse</a>, and asked to be taken to Brooklyn: &quot;<strong>It was insane. He stopped, and when I told him my destination he took off while I was dragging from the door...He knew he was dragging me. I was injured.</strong>&quot; Above, you can see two pictures of his injuries, which he took with his iPhone.</p>

<p>According to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150223101728/http://www.nyc.gov/html/tlc/html/passenger/taxicab_rights.shtml">Taxicab Rider&apos;s Bill of Rights</a>, riders have the right to be taken to &quot;any destination in NYC, Westchester, Nassau, or Newark Airport,&quot; and can submit a complaint to the TLC if the driver does not comply.</p>
