                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="62313seconds.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20131021151021im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/62313seconds.jpg" width="640" height="442" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>Oftentimes when <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131021151021/http://gothamist.com/tags/tourists">tourists</a> try to articulate their visits to our <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131021151021/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/22/times_square_weed_man_arrested_afte.php">strange</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131021151021/http://gothamist.com/tags/trolling">provocative</a> city, you end up with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131021151021/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/24/aussie_tourist_128423735th_person_t.php">shit-talking Australians</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131021151021/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/07/video_texan_reviews_nyc_notes_its_k.php">philosophically-stunted Texans</a>. But once in a while, you get something really lovely, like this video compiled from footage <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131021151021/https://vimeo.com/68815947">taken by a native San Franciscan</a> earlier this month. </p>

<p>&quot;My heart belongs to San Francisco&#x2014;but that doesn&apos;t mean I can&apos;t have a love affair on the side,&quot; he writes. &quot;This is a San Franciscan&apos;s perspective of the people and place that make New York City. I visited NYC for 12 days in June and brought my Canon 7D with me everywhere.&quot; That includes lots of glimpses of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131021151021/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/08/photos_insane_mud_at_governors_ball.php">very soggy Governors Ball</a>, along with a lot of big targets (Times Square, Yankee Stadium, Brooklyn Bridge, High Line, etc). But aside from the music, the one second glimpses of nearly a fortnight in NYC works exceptionally well.</p>
