After Kerry Washington hosted <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140219101833/http://gothamist.com/tags/snl"><em>Saturday Night Live</em></a> last weekend&#x2014;and the show took the opportunity to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140219101833/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/03/videos_saturday_night_live_3.php#photo-1">address criticisms about the lack of diversity in the cast</a>&#x2014;things were decidedly less meta this week as Lady Gaga pulled double duty as host and musical guest. Gaga took every opportunity she could to play up her over-the-top image, parodying her songs and fashion choices in several sketches. </p>

<p>Of course, those parodies were hit-and-miss (with a lot of awkward thrown in). Things started with the monologue, in which Gaga performed a big band version of &quot;Applause&quot; that was all about her <em>not</em> taking herself too seriously. Then there was the &quot;The Worst Cover Songs Of All Time,&quot; one of those sketches in which the cast gets to trot out some obscure, hilarious impressions (Rick Ross singing &#x201C;Cups,&#x201D; Lana Del Ray And Nathan Lane singing Shaggy&#x2019;s &#x201C;It Wasn&#x2019;t Me&#x201D;). Gaga covered Madonna&apos;s &quot;Express Yourself&quot;...by performing &quot;Born This Way.&quot; </p>

<p>A particularly notable sketch featured an elderly Gaga living in an Upper West Side apartment in the year 2063, forgotten by everyone. The sketch was intellectually compelling&#x2014;was this purely driven by the writers, or is this a peak at how Gaga views her own legacy?&#x2014;was well acted (with Gaga performing some brief piano takes of some of her hits), and had a great, creepy ending. But was it funny? Not really. The audience seemed particularly confused as to whether they should be laughing or &quot;awwing&quot; at the situation. </p>

<p>All three of Gaga&apos;s sketches (Monologue, Worst Cover Songs, Elderly Gaga) are not available online because of copyright issues. (Luckily you can see her excellent performance of &#x201C;Do What U Want&#x201D; with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140219101833/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1717583/lady-gaga-r-kelly-saturday-night-live.jhtml">R. Kelly on push-up duty</a>). </p>

<p>Overall, there was only one <em>bad</em> sketch that never worked (the Condo Board one, another NYC-centric sketch). All of the other bits had strong performances: Bobby Moynihan continued his season of scene-stealing by portraying Rob Ford in the political cold open. Jay Pharoah showed off a near-perfect Kanye West impression in Waking Up With Kimye. Vanessa Bayer killed it as a child actor in Spotlightz. Blockbuster was a strong, eerie (but not funny &quot;Ha Ha&quot;) digital video, a la last season&apos;s Sad Rat. </p>

<p>The best performance of the night belonged to Taran Killam as speech critic Jebediah Atkinson on Weekend Update, who hopefully will become a regular there. Click through for all those sketches, plus a couple fake ads. And appreciate the good this week, because next week the host is <em>Hunger Games</em> third banana Josh Hutcherson. Who? Exactly.</p>
