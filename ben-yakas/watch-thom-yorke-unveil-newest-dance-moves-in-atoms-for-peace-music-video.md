<p>As Sasha Frere-Jones notes in the New Yorker this week, Thom Yorke has successfully made the transition from anxious post-modern worrier to groovy dance freak. With the release of side band <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130304005703/http://atomsforpeace.info/">Atoms For Peace</a>&apos;s debut album, the twitchy and seductive <em>Amok</em>, the band has released a music video for sexy album track &quot;Ingenue.&quot; Yorke is in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130304005703/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/02/video_dancing_tank_top_thom_yorke_c.php">full-ponytail mode</a> for the elusive dance, pairing off with contemporary dancer Fukiko Takase for a strange, utterly compelling performance that is a worthy followup to his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130304005703/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/19/dancing_thom_yorke.php">much emulated</a> &quot;Lotus Flower&quot; dance.</p>

<p>The video was directed and choreographed by Garth Jennings and Wayne McGregor, the same team behind &quot;Lotus Flower.&quot; There are a few classic Yorke moves involved&#x2014;arms outstretched opening the curtains, twitchy hands freak-out, suit over the head&#x2014;and a few very welcome new ones&#x2014;pointing in unison, contemporary karate chopping, and floor writhing, to name but three. </p>

<p>For anyone who is not familiar with Atoms for Peace, the band was formed in 2010 as a chance for Yorke to perform his solo album <em>The Eraser</em> live for the first time&#x2014;we were won over by them during a full-bodied, percussion-heavy set <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130304005703/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/09/week_in_rock_thom_yorke_girls_cu.php#photo-1">at Roseland Ballroom</a>. Right now, the band only has a few DJ sets lined up, but Yorke has hinted that a full band tour <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130304005703/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/atoms-for-peace-release-amok-stream-hint-at-more-u-s-tour-dates-20130218">may be coming later this year.</a></p>
