<p>Last week, Mayor Bloomberg <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170306111430/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/16/bloomberg_does_not_like_slut_shamin.php">got in touch with his feminine side</a> as he considered whether or not he&apos;d sign new legislation punishing taxi drivers who are convicted of knowingly transporting sex trafficking victims. Today at the signing ceremony, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170306111430/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/mayor-bloomberg-sign-bill-crack-cabbies-sex-trafficking-article-1.1099546?localLinksEnabled=false">he decided to delay making a decision</a> for a few more days&#x2014;because he&apos;s worried his daughters might be mistaken for hookers. &#x201C;I do worry that if my daughters are out there after they&#x2019;re at a club and they come out late at night and they&#x2019;re dressed a lot more risque-ly, if that&#x2019;s a word, than people of my generation did, but still appropriately for this generation, it does put a taxi driver in a difficult position,&#x201D; Bloomberg said.</p>

<p>Last Friday, Bloomberg channeled his inner Goddess as he questioned the specifics of the bill: &#x201C;You know, if I were a young lady and I dressed in a &#x2018;sporty way&#x2019;&#x2014;or however you want to phrase it...I would not want somebody thinking that I&#x2019;m a prostitute,&#x201D; Bloomberg said during his weekly radio show. &quot;There&#x2019;s nothing wrong with that. Maybe it&#x2019;s not appropriate to go to the workplace, but at night, sometimes sure, why not.&#x201D;</p>

<p>The bill would ensure that cabbies caught transporting prostitutes would lose their license for a first offense, and face an additional $10,000 fine the second time around. In several recent sex trafficking cases, it&apos;s come out that certain cabbies were in on the deals, pocketing half the money of their earnings. Executive Director Laurel W. Eisner of the Sanctuary for Families&#x2014;a victims advocacy group that was instrumental in constructing the law&#x2014;told us a bit more about the new cabby law:</p>

<blockquote>The law will not discourage drivers from picking up &quot;sex workers&quot; or women dressed in any particular way. The law will discourage drivers from engaging in crimes involving sex trafficking, which entail actively participating in and profiting from coerced prostitution. A driver must first be criminally convicted of one of the enumerated felony crimes under existing penal law before being subject to the civil penalties of this law. Picking up a passenger in the ordinary course of business does not implicate the State penal law and does not trigger the provisions of this bill.</blockquote>

<p>City Council Transportation Chairman James Vacca <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170306111430/http://online.wsj.com/article/AP96253c0a06ff489abce6e91a696d9269.html">was very disappointed</a> in Bloomberg&apos;s delay: &quot;The bill is very specific. This took months of negotiation,&quot; he said. &quot;We did not want anyone singled out, and it does not single anyone out based on what they look like.&quot; City Council Speaker Christine Quinn <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170306111430/http://www.wnyc.org/blogs/wnyc-news-blog/2012/jun/20/bloomberg-delays-signing-sex-trafficking-bill/">also was frustrated</a>, saying it &#x201C;demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of what our bill does: making sure convicted traffickers are punished for their crimes.&#x201D;</p>
