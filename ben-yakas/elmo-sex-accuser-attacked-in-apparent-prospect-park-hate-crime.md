<p>One of the men who accused Elmo puppeteer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130608075716/http://gothamist.com/tags/kevinclash">Kevin Clash</a> of underage sex abuse last year <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130608075716/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/elmo_vic_the_latest_gay_assault_glA0WRNU3dju29kAG1TU5J">was attacked in Brooklyn this week</a> in what police say was the latest hate crime against a gay person. Kevin Kiadii, 25, was punched and kicked by five men who shouted anti-gay slurs at him and a friend in Prospect Park on Wednesday. &#x201C;I&#x2019;ll kill you, faggot,&#x201D; one of the men said, according to Kiadii.</p>

<p>Kiadii, a professional makeup artist, said one of the men have him a &quot;straight sucker punch&quot; to the face. He grabbed a bottle of perfume from his bag and used it like pepper spray on the man who punched him. &#x201C;If it wasn&#x2019;t for my Dior bottle, I&#x2019;d be in so much damage,&#x201D; he told The Post. </p>

<p>In the attack, Kiadii injured his finger, arm and face, and bruised his shoulders and ribs. Police caught the five suspects&#x2014;the five men, who range in age from 16 to 21, were all charged with gang assault as a hate crime. There has been a rash of hate crimes against gay people in recent weeks, with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130608075716/http://gothamist.com/tags/hatecrime">most of the those attacks taking place in Manhattan.</a></p>

<p>Kiadii was the fifth person to come forward last year to accuse Clash of underage sex abuse. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130608075716/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/elmo-puppeteer-hit-5th-sex-allegation-article-1.1305743">He claimed that</a> Clash &#x201C;trolled gay telephone chat-line rooms to meet and have sex with underage boys.&#x201D;</p>
