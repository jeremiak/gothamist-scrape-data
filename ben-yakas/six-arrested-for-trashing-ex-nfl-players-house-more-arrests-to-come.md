<p>Six teens and young adults <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426151812/http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/football/6-arrests-vandalism-nfl-player-upstate-new-york-home-article-1.1468886">were arrested yesterday</a> for their part in the massive Labor Day weekend bash that took place at former pro football player Brian Holloway&apos;s upstate NY home. The six people&#x2014;who range in age from 17 to 21&#x2014;were arrested Thursday after Holloway, a former Patriots and Raiders offensive lineman, signed papers authorizing the local sheriff to bring charges for the party, which caused thousands of dollars of damage to this house. &#x201C;Everyone that broke the law, I&#x2019;m pressing charges against,&#x201D; Holloway said. &#x201C;The parents had a chance and students had a chance to come forward, and only four did.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Holloway re-posted photographs of many of the teens on a site called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426151812/http://helpmesave300.com/">HelpMeSave300.com</a> in an attempt to &quot;teach our kids to be accountable.&quot; He also asked for the teens to come to a picnic for veterans at the home to help clean it up&#x2014;in the end, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426151812/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/22/few_teens_who_trashed_ex-nfl_player.php">only a few teens did</a>. &#x201C;I tried to be as accommodating as I could, but they took their stand by not showing up,&#x201D; Holloway said.</p>

<p>Police said the ringleader of the party was 19-year-old Seth Hawk, whom Holloway said he had taken into his family a few years ago. Hawk faces felony charges of burglary and criminal mischief and misdemeanor charges of endangering the welfare of a child and unlawfully dealing with a child. He&#x2019;s also accused of advertising the party and supplying the alcohol.</p>

<p>The other suspects <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426151812/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2434711/Brian-Holloways-house-trashed-Six-people-arrested-including-friend-NFL-stars-son.html">are also facing</a> a variety of charges, including second-degree criminal trespass and felony fourth-degree grand larceny. </p>

<p>Holloway, who lives primarily in Tampa now, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426151812/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/20/parents_of_teens_who_trashed_ex-nfl.php">told us last week that he estimates</a> there is $20-40K in damage to the house, including smashed windows and glass doors, an &quot;enormous amount&quot; of graffiti, urine-soaked carpets, holes in the ceilings, and a stolen eagle statue (which has since been returned). He also said that many parents of the teens who vandalized the home have threatened him with lawsuits for re-posting their Tweets and Instagrams of the party.</p>
