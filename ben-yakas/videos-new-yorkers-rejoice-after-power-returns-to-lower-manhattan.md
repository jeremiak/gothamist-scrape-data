<p>The lights have finally come back on in most of lower Manhattan after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161010/http://gothamist.com/tags/hurricanesandy">Hurricane Sandy</a> knocked power out everywhere below 39th Street last Monday. Con Ed brought back power <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161010/http://gothamist.com/2012/11/02/power_is_coming_back_on_in_lower_ma.php">to the East Village and LES</a> Friday evening, and restored power to the West Village, SoHo, TriBeCa and Kips Bay overnight (after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161010/http://gothamist.com/2012/11/02/turn_on_the_lights_power_is_being_t.php">a bit of teasing</a>). At this point, most of Manhattan has power back (and they&apos;re hard at work restoring the last networks downtown now). And downtown residents were certainly relieved and grateful, as you can see in the videos below of them hooting, hollering and cheering as power first came back.</p>

<p>Yesterday morning, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161010/http://gothamist.com/2012/11/02/con_ed_expects_to_restore_power_to.php">there were</a> 226K Manhattan residents without power; as of 7 a.m. today, there are only 5,800 without power. According to their Twitter feed, they are currently working on the Greeley network (Madison Avenue to 6th Avenue and 39th/40th Streets to 35th/36th Streets), the Cortland network (West to Broadway/State Street &amp; Liberty to Battery w/sliver at Trinitiy to Bway&amp;Vesey; to Liberty), and Freedom network (West to Church&amp;Vesey; to Cedar w/sliver at Albany&amp;Cedar; to Washington&amp;Greenwich;).</p>

<p>Altogether, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161010/http://www.coned.com/newsroom/news/pr20121103.asp">Con Ed has restored power</a> to more than 645K customers around the city, or approximately 70 percent everyone who lost power during the storm. There are still 81K without power in Queens, 31K in Brooklyn, 31K in Staten Island and 25K in the Bronx. But it may take <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161010/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/11/01/new-york-con-edison-power_n_2059366.html">until next weekend</a> for many of those places to see their power restored.</p>
