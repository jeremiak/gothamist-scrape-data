<p>The incident happened just after noon Sunday at the intersection of Ditmars Blvd and 21st Street in Astoria. The fire truck was heading west on Ditmars to the scene of a fire when a Q11 bus slammed into it. &quot;I saw the driver, the fireman, look to the left and the bus hit him,&#x201D; witness Diana Temkin <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110082527/http://nypost.com/2016/06/26/pregnant-woman-child-among-14-injured-in-bus-crash/">told the Post</a>. &quot;I saw his face.&quot;</p>

<p>Twelve people on the MTA bus were hurt, as well as five firefighters. None of the victims had life-threatening injuries, and all were taken to Elmhurst Hospital, except for one firefighter who went to Mt. Sinai Hospital. At least three parked cars were also damaged in the crash. </p>

<p>The witness told the Post that a pregnant woman and a baby were among the injured: &quot;There was a little baby bleeding,&quot; Temkin added. &quot;And there was a pregnant lady that they helped off the bus and laid on the floor. She was definitely injured. There was also a little 9-year-old girl who looked really hurt.&quot; </p>

<p>Other witnesses added that the bus appeared to be &quot;going way too fast, looked like 100 miles an hour.&quot;</p>

<p>Police added that no arrests have been made, and the investigation is ongoing.</p>
