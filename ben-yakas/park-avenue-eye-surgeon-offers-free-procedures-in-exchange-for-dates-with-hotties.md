<p>Eye surgeon Dr. Emil Chynn of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429092451/http://www.parkavenuesafesight.com/">Park Avenue LASEK</a> has had some very bad luck when it comes to dating. It&apos;s gone so bad, he&apos;s decided to offer free procedures to anyone who can get him a date with a hottie. But not just any hottie: according <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429092451/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/the_fix_is_in_YHSFrt59ocSn9iMKAt6j5M">to the Post</a>, she must be a &quot;very skinny,&quot; dress size 0-2, white, aged 27-35, graduate of an Ivy League school, &#x201C;Type B&#x201D; personality (not &#x201C;Type A&#x201D; like him), and a rating of 8 or 9 on a 1-to-10 attractiveness scale. It&apos;s good to know there are still some romantics out there, at least.</p>

<p>Here&apos;s what you get if you are able to find that special someone for Chynn:</p>

<blockquote>For a first date, he&#x2019;ll shell out a $100 reward. He&#x2019;ll offer free eyelash-enhancer Latisse or pay $200 for the second date; he&#x2019;ll offer free Botox or pay $300 for a third date; he&#x2019;ll offer free Juvederm injections or $400 for a fourth date; and free Lasek surgery on one eye worth $2,000 or $500 cash for a fifth date.</blockquote> 

<p>It seems Chynn has been seeking potential matchmakers at networking events around the area. He&apos;s only had two set-ups since sending out his email detailing his needs, and he didn&apos;t go on either date because the women didn&apos;t match his rigorous parameters. &quot;The yield is very low because I&#x2019;m so picky,&#x201D; he told the Post. &quot;I&#x2019;m not crazy I just want someone who&#x2019;s the right age and same the same sort of education and we&#x2019;re compatible and loves me for me.&quot; </p>

<p>This isn&apos;t the first time that Chynn has tried to think outside the box while looking for a mate: he regularly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429092451/http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2012/05/nyc-surgeon-offers-10000-to-charity-for-intro-to-woman-of-his-dreams/">places personal ads</a> in Columbia University&#x2019;s alumni magazine offering $10K to charity for helping finding his perfect lady. And a few years ago, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429092451/http://gawker.com/5485270/best-roommate-ad-ever-free-manhattan-studio-for-back+walking-wife+finding-female">he posted a roommate ad</a> on Craigslist offering free rent to a woman who would walk on his back for an hour every day and help find him a wife. </p>
