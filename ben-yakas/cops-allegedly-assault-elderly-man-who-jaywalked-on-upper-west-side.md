<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Just witnessed this on Upper West Side with my friend Ian, who was interviewed by the New York Post: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150105215539/http://t.co/2bZyLRAq5y">http://t.co/2bZyLRAq5y</a></p>&#x2014; Josh Dawsey (@jdawsey1) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150105215539/https://twitter.com/jdawsey1/statuses/425035791476457472">January 19, 2014</a></blockquote>

<p>The Post notes that the victim didn&#x2019;t seem to understand English-language commands: &quot;The guy didn&#x2019;t seem to speak English. The cop walked him over to the Citibank&quot; near the northeast corner of 96th and Broadway, witness Ian King told them. &quot;[The officer] stood him up against him the wall and was trying to write him a ticket. The man didn&#x2019;t seem to understand, and he started walking away.&quot; </p>

<p>When the officer pursued the man, all hell broke loose: &quot;The cop tried to pull him back and that&#x2019;s when he [the pedestrian] began to struggle with the cop,&quot; King continued. &quot;As soon as he pushed the cop, it was like cops started running in from everywhere.&quot; The man ended up bloody and bruised, then was handcuffed and taken away.</p>

<p>Community Board 7 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150105215539/http://www.nyc.gov/html/mancb7/downloads/pdf/chair_letter_to_forgione.pdf">offered eight actions that should be taken</a> after the recent spate of pedestrian deaths in the area; none of them included issuing tickets for jaywalking. NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton has long been an advocate for the strategy though&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150105215539/http://www.nytimes.com/1998/02/08/nyregion/police-balk-at-crackdown-on-jaywalkers-by-giuliani.html">back in 1998</a>, officers told the Times they were annoyed by the tactic. </p>

<p>At <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150105215539/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/15/de_blasio_pedestrian_deaths.php">a press conference</a> last week, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150105215539/http://www.streetsblog.org/2014/01/16/brattons-bad-data-on-pedestrian-injuries-wont-get-us-to-vision-zero/">Bratton cited figures on &quot;pedestrian error&quot;</a> contributing to collisions involving death or injury without mentioning his source, and stressed the need for &quot;pedestrian education.&quot; Mayor de Blasio later said the emphasis would be on education, and not enforcement.</p>

<p>Cops told us they have no information about the incident right now. We&apos;ll update when we learn more.</p>
