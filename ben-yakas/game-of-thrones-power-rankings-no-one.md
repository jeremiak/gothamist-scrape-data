This week, Jaime weighed his options, Cersei answered a request, and Grey Worm told a joke. GOT is all about how people jockey for power, so click through for our SPOILER-FILLED season six <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025143141/http://gothamist.com/tags/gameofthronespowerrankings">Game Of Thrones Power Rankings.</a></p>

<p><strong>Game Of Thrones Power Rankings, Week 8</strong></p>

<p><strong>1. Violence As A Choice Vs. Violence As A Disease:</strong> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025143141/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/06/game_of_thrones_power_rankings_the_9.php">Last week</a>, we were told by dear departed Brother Ian McShane that violence is a disease (&quot;You don&apos;t cure it by spreading it to more people&quot;). This week, we saw things from Cersei&apos;s perspective, as she actively chooses (and delights in) violence as the only thing she can control in her life anymore. </p>

<p>That struggle wedges its way into almost every conflict in the episode: Cersei and Zombie Mountain choose violence, but the Brotherhood Without Banners (and The Hound) respect justice more than pain. Jaime, Brienne and Edmure all try to bring a peaceful resolution to the Riverrun conflict, but Blackfish is so committed to fighting he ends up dying somewhere in the bowels of the castle. Arya just wants to get outta Braavos, not poke assassin monks in the eyes. And next week we have the seemingly unavoidable Stark/Bolton conflict coming to a very violent head. </p>

<p>Don&apos;t even ask any of the Greyjoys what they think:</p>

<p><strong>2. Arya Finally Breaks Up With The Face-Shifting Assassin Monks Who Speak In The Third Person And Occasionally Blind You And/Or Stab You In The Gut To Teach You Some Sort Of O Henry-esque Lesson:</strong> After nearly two seasons of sweeping floors and disobeying orders at the House of Black and White, Arya Stark of Winterfell is back, and she&apos;s ready to go home. Stab wounds to the gut can&apos;t kill her, bad soup can&apos;t kill her, wound-opening parkour moves can&apos;t kill her, and even Terminator: Mean Girls Edition can&apos;t kill her. Everything&apos;s coming up Arya!</p>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">wow surprised this episode&apos;s title was &quot;Terminator Waif Versus Arya Stark&apos;s Plot Armor&quot; that is strangely specific <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025143141/https://twitter.com/hashtag/GameofThrones?src=hash">#GameofThrones</a></p>&#x2014; Sonny Bunch (@SonnyBunch) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025143141/https://twitter.com/SonnyBunch/status/742175253707784193">June 13, 2016</a></blockquote>

<p>On the one hand, it&apos;s good that Arya got to spend a very long semester abroad trying, like so many angsty young people before her, to obliterate her personality and forget about her past one assassination at a time. It was like a bad mushrooms trip: Arya had to disassemble herself in order to figure out what really mattered to her and get through the trauma of most of her family being murdered. And she picked up some pretty sweet fighting skills along the way, which really came in handy in the final battle with the Waif.  </p>

<p>On the other hand, the Powers That Be here at GoT Power Ranking HQ never felt wholly convinced that Arya really wanted to become a faceless assassin monk (code name: No One), which makes her time in Braavos feel a bit hollow. How different is she really now from when she started (minus the additional murdering skills)? How much of this was needed to grow Arya as a character, and how much was it needed as (mostly enjoyable) wheel-spinning until it was time for her to head back to Westeros and (hopefully) reunite with her family? </p>

<p><strong>3. Peer Pressure, Social Drinkers, &amp; Jokes Galore:</strong> The best scene in the entire episode peaks early when Tyrion badgers and cajoles Missandei and Grey Worm into <em>finally</em> drinking wine with him. Drinking is an intrinsic part of being human, by Tyrion&apos;s definition, and in case that wasn&apos;t convincing enough, &quot;anyone not drinking is disrespecting our Queen.&quot; Then he reveals his retirement plans: &quot;I&apos;d like to have my own vineyard, make my own wine. &apos;The Imp&apos;s Delight.&apos; Only my close friends could drink it.&quot; It&apos;s like hanging out with season two Tyrion all over again!</p>

<p>Then for a brief, beautiful moment, the episode turns into a GoT version of <em>Comedians In Cars Getting Coffee</em>, with botched jokes about the ruling classes (totally lost on people outside of Westeros), a philosophical discussion of what jokes are (&quot;a joke is like a story, not a true story...&quot;), some polite (and encouraging) fake laughter from Tyrion, and one surprise belly laugh thanks to Grey Worm. </p>

<p>And thanks to the Great Masters, we&apos;ll never find out what happened in that brothel with the honeycomb and jackass...</p>

<p><strong>4. Daenerys Stormborn Of The House Targaryen, The First Of Her Name, The Unburnt, Queen of Meereen, Queen of the Andals And The First Men, Khaleesi Of The Great Grass Sea, Breaker Of Chains, Mother Of Dragons, Sleeper Of Daario, Inadvertent Incinerator Of Little Children, The Meereen Machine, Into The Distance Starer, High Lord Of Title-Heavy Introductions, Queen Of Nothing, Arriver At Opportune Times:</strong> So...she showed up for about 10 seconds? And she... didn&apos;t say anything? And GoT blew their CGI budget on next week&apos;s big battle so we only got to see Drogon flying away in the distance? </p>

<p>We have a bad feeling that we won&apos;t get the conclusion of the Meereen siege until the finale in two weeks, which makes us wonder why they didn&apos;t just have her ride in with the calvary then. Everything about Dany&apos;s story right now is frustrating&#x2014;it&apos;s time to head to Westeros already! If she isn&apos;t headed there by the finale, we&apos;re adding a new title to her name: &quot;Delayer Of Inevitable.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>5. Tyrion &amp; Vary&apos;s Topsy-Turvy Rollercoaster Of Friendship:</strong> Somewhere between bantering about Vary&apos;s inability to shave and Tyrion&apos;s stature as the most famous dwarf in the city/world, these two besties shared a nod and shoulder grasp filled to the brim with meaning. &quot;I&apos;m going to miss you,&quot; Tyrion reluctantly admits. &quot;I know,&quot; Varys says, channeling Han Solo. Tyrion and Varys turned into <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025143141/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kiNJcDG4E0">Rick and Renault</a> so slowly we almost missed it. </p>

<p><strong>6. Anticipation:</strong> This wasn&apos;t a <em>bad</em> episode by any means&#x2014;things were kind of slow and there was certainly a lot of set up (the tea kettle that is Cersei is ready to blow), but Arya&apos;s story in Braavos had a nice conclusion, Tyrion had a lot of funny scenes, Brienne Of Fucking Tarth got an emotional reunion with Jaime, and The Hound killed a couple people (and perhaps found some new traveling companions). But compared to other eighth episodes from previous seasons...well, this episode lacked the <em>oomph</em> of last year&apos;s masterpiece <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025143141/http://gothamist.com/2015/06/01/game_of_thrones_power_rankings_hard.php">&quot;Hardhome&quot;</a> or season four&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025143141/http://gothamist.com/2014/06/02/game_of_thrones_the_mountain_and_th.php">&quot;The Mountain and The Viper.&quot;</a> </p>

<p>But there are only <em>two</em> more episodes left this year and they look like they&apos;re gonna be doozies&#x2014;especially next week&apos;s <em>Braveheart</em>-esque battle royale between the forces of the Starks and the Boltons. There are <em>a lot</em> of plot balls hanging in the air, so we can&apos;t wait to see how everything shakes out to end season six.</p>

<p><strong>7. Missandei/Grey Worm Shippers:</strong> Wine might make Missandei feel funny, but nobody makes her laugh harder than Grey Worm. These two remain some of our favorite quaternary characters in the show. Who would have thought that some of the most romantic scenes in GoT history would focus on a eunuch and a translator.</p>

<p><strong>8. Lady Brienne Of Fucking Tarth/Jamie &quot;Human Embodiment Of A C+&quot; Lannister Shippers:</strong> Ser Bronn&apos;s crude gossiping (&quot;You think they&apos;re fucking?&quot;) sets the subtext for a pair of tense, lovely scenes reuniting long lost pals Brienne and Jaime. Unfortunately, Jaime has regressed somewhat since the last time they met. He&apos;s clinging to an old idea of who he is and should be, focusing all his energy on his unyielding, all-encompassing love for Cersei. He wants to believe this is the core truth about himself. </p>

<p>Based on his conversation with Edmure, it&apos;s clear that this love is the thing that helps him go to sleep at night thinking he&apos;s a decent man (or at least not an <em>evil</em> man). He takes Edmure&apos;s questions (&quot;How do you tell yourself that you&apos;re decent after everything that you&apos;ve done?&quot;) seriously&#x2014;if every bad thing he&apos;s done has been in service of someone else, maybe he can transcend his sins. He even repeats the same line he used to justify pushing Bran out the window in the pilot: &quot;The things we do for love.&quot;</p>

<p>If you&apos;re rooting for Jaime/Cersei to scorch the Known World with their love, then you&apos;re rooting for stasis, for Jaime to fundamentally stay the same character we met in season one. Which is why Brienne is such a fascinating influence on him&#x2014;she encourages self-reflection, feeds his empathy, and pushes him to honor his oaths.</p>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Brienne is all of our emotions, always. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025143141/https://twitter.com/hashtag/GameofThrones?src=hash">#GameofThrones</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025143141/https://t.co/fUUKXXhDwb">pic.twitter.com/fUUKXXhDwb</a></p>&#x2014; Maester Patches (@misterpatches) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025143141/https://twitter.com/misterpatches/status/742180510806507520">June 13, 2016</a></blockquote>

<p>Actor Nikolaj Coster-Waldau <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025143141/http://www.ew.com/article/2016/06/12/game-thrones-jaime-brienne-reunion">talked to EW</a> about their connection: &quot;Jaime is always about Cersei and what he can do to help her and how to achieve whatever she wants. And for Brienne, it&#x2019;s the same &#x2014; she has an oath to Catelyn Stark. She&#x2019;s extremely strong willed and has her honor and has to do the right thing always. Sometimes, with both them, you just want go, &#x2018;For godssake, let it go for a one second. What about what you want?&#x2019; They never listen to themselves. And what I love about the end of this scene is there&#x2019;s some heartbreak because, once again, they were close. But are they ever gonna be able to talk about something other than someone else&#x2019;s agenda?&quot;</p>

<p>And shit, there has never been a more erotically charged moment involving a Valyrian sword than when Jaime says, &quot;It&apos;s yours, it&apos;ll always be yours&quot; regarding Oathkeeper. That last hand wave alone is sure to keep this ship afloat for a few more seasons.</p>

<p><strong>9. Ser Bronn/Podrick Payne, World&apos;s Oldest Squire Shippers:</strong> There&apos;s a thin line between old friends horsin&apos; around and sexual harassment, but these two make it work, despite all the &quot;magic cock&quot; jokes and noogies. &quot;Assume everyone wants to hit you, because they do Pod,&quot; Bronn explains affectionately. &quot;Everyone wants to hit a fucking squire.&quot;</p>

<p>But a show of hands: who here immediately remembered that Pod and Bronn were old pals (along with Tyrion) back in seasons two and three?</p>

<p><strong>10. Excessive Catelyn Stark References That May Or May Not Portend Some Big Things (But Probably Not):</strong> Brienne and Blackfish talk about Cat (Sansa apparently writes, or demands things, just like her mother); Jaime reminisces about the time she hit him on the head with a rock (&quot;I admired her&quot;); and the Brotherhood Without Banners is suddenly back and ready to do &quot;something larger than ourselves.&quot; Sure seems like a lot of discussion of a long-dead character all of a sudden, coming at the end of a season that emphasized resurrections/the power of magic and had an ongoing Revenge Of The Starks theme at play. For those who read the books (or pay attention <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025143141/http://www.theverge.com/2016/6/12/11906394/game-of-thrones-theory-lady-stoneheart-twist-season-six">to the many theories</a> floating around the internet), this all seems a bit too coincidental, doesn&apos;t it?</p>

<p>But here&apos;s the thing about spoiler-friendly book conspiracies: they&apos;ve almost never come true. Most people walked away from this episode deflated because it seemingly closed the door on two long-held theories (you can read more about them <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025143141/https://filmschoolrejects.com/game-of-thrones-explained-no-one-season-6-episode-8-8c45cd93817#.6upiypw3i">here</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025143141/https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2016/06/game-of-thrones-recap-no-one-cleganebowl-lady-stoneheart?mbid=social_twitter">here</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025143141/http://www.businessinsider.com/game-of-thrones-cleganebowl-not-happening-2016-6">here</a>, and that&apos;s that for now). For what it&apos;s worth, every time one theory dies, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025143141/https://www.reddit.com/r/freefolk/comments/4ntdqg/demons_made_of_snow_and_ice_and_cold_the_ancient/">another rises from its ashes like a tinfoil hat-wearing phoenix.</a></p>

<p><strong>11. Cersei&apos;s Season Of Nothing Left To Lose:</strong> Her only living son betrayed her; her brother has been sent out of the city; she&apos;s been confined to the Red Keep; she can&apos;t have a trial-by-combat; the Tyrells have gone their own way; and she&apos;s a pariah among royals and commoners alike. But she still has her fierceness. And she still has lots of wildfire stationed around the city, as Qyburn alludes in his whispers.</p>

<p>It&apos;s just like Chekhov said: if fictional Cersei (as played by Lady Crane in the opening scene) vows vengeance upon her enemies in the first act, then the real Cersei must have her revenge before the end of the season.</p>

Shopping, Westerosi Style:</strong> Apparently, the easiest way to get a new pair of boots isn&apos;t to order a pair on Zappos&#x2014;all you have to do is come upon a ragged band of religious fanatics who are hanging some of their rogue members, and then try on the shoes of the victims as they hang in the air! </p>

<p><strong>13. The Hound&apos;s Revenge Tour 2016: Brotherhood Without Torture:</strong> What happens when an unstoppable killing machine force meets an immovable impossible-to-kill object? Three years ago, Beric Dondarrion and his six companions would probably be dead already. But now, post-Hippie Pacifist Lumberjack Camp? Sandor Clegane doesn&apos;t even get to chop off one measly hand. &quot;Bunch of Nancy&apos;s,&quot; he mutters disappointedly. At least these buzzkills weren&apos;t around when Clegane was swinging his axe into people&apos;s genitalia at the start of the episode.</p>

<p>And so we get the much-anticipated (at least by the Powers That Be who write the <strong>Way Beyond The Wall</strong> section every god damn week) return of the Brotherhood Without Banners and their two nominal leaders, Beric Dondarrion and Thoros of Myr. We haven&apos;t seen them since since <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025143141/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/13/game_of_thrones_power_rankings_the_1.php">&quot;The Bear And The Maiden Fair,&quot;</a> back when The Hound had no patience for fire swords or religious martyrs. </p>

<p>But a lot has changed since then. His time <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025143141/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/06/game_of_thrones_power_rankings_the_9.php">with Brother Ian McShane</a> has mellowed him out. Dondarrion hits the nail on the head, echoing what McShane told Clegane last week: &quot;Good and bad, young and old, the things we&apos;re fighting will destroy them all alike. You can still help a whole lot more than you&apos;ve harmed Clegane. <strong>It&apos;s not too late for you.</strong>&quot; Mostly, The Hound wants to be useful with whatever time he has left&#x2014;and if he gets to take down some bad people while doing so, the more the merrier.</p>

<p><strong>14. Tommen, King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Boners:</strong> Is Tommen aware of how he&apos;s alienating (and likely dooming) his mother? Does he know he&apos;s being used by the High Sparrow to initiate a religious takeover of the city? Does he have any idea that he&apos;s the product of incest? Does he know he looks more uncomfortable than Ned Stark while sitting on the Iron Throne?</p>

<p>None of that matters, because Tommen still has a weird ass voice. I don&apos;t like it, I can&apos;t stop noticing it, and I just don&apos;t like it at all.</p>

<p><strong>15. A Fate More Ignominious Than Death-By-Axe: Death By Off-Screen Red Shirt:</strong> The Waif dies off-screen, but at least we get <em>proof</em> of her demise when Arya hangs her face on the wall in the Hall Of Faces or whatever they call the basement rec room at Camp Assassin Monk. </p>

<p>The Blackfish gets no such exit&#x2014;the stubborn old goat would rather die for his pride than for his blood. &quot;I haven&apos;t had a proper swordfight in years,&quot; he says. &quot;I expect I&apos;ll make a damn fool of myself.&quot; That&apos;s not a <em>bad</em> last line, but getting killed by anonymous Lannister soldiers off-screen, along with a perfunctory head nod from Jaime, does not constitute a &quot;good death.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>The Viserys Targaryen Memorial Least Powerful Person Of The Week Award:</strong> For the third week in a row, <strong>Lord Edmure Tully</strong> put in a commanding performance as &quot;Guy Most Likely To Be Kept In A Basement Jail By His Enemies And His Family.&quot; He almost escaped his fate as least powerful person of the week when he started poking at Jaime&apos;s sense of decency, but it was not to be. Once Jaime threatened his child (with death-by-catapult) and convinced Edmure he had nothing to lose, the Lord Of Riverrun caved, made the Tully troops lay down their arms, betrayed his uncle, and surrendered the castle. </p>

<p>And now he gets to wear a House Frey novelty shirt. I assume they have those, and I assume they say things like, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025143141/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeRks0a3YnE">&quot;A Wedding Needs A Bedding!&quot;</a> </p>

<p><strong>The Ser Pounce Memorial Most Powerful Pet Of The Week Award:</strong> More than ever, <strong>Zombie Mountain</strong> really felt like Cersei&apos;s pet this week. Maybe it was his eager-to-please nature? Maybe it was the puppy-like hop in his step as he marched by Cersei? Maybe it was because his face looked extra zombie-ish as he ripped the dude&apos;s head off? Who knows! </p>

<p><strong>The Hodoriffic Honorary Minor Character Of The Week Award:</strong> At first, we were leaning toward giving this to our beloved Lord Oaf Of Highgarden, just for the way he silently stood by Tommen with his arms folded behind his back. Trust us, it was <em>delightful</em>. But to mix things up, let&apos;s give it this week to <strong>Random Braavosi Woman Upset About The Young Woman Who Just Tumbled Into Her Basket.</strong> We see big things in her future.</p>

<p><strong>Long Lost Character Brienne &amp; Pod Are Most Likely To Bump Into While Rowing:</strong> <strong>Gendry</strong>! Remember Gendry?! It only makes sense: Bran Stark, Rickon Stark, Benjen Stark, Edmure Tully, Blackfish, The Hound, Beric Dondarrion, Thoros of Myr, and Walder Frey have all returned after long absences.

<p><strong>Way Beyond The Wall</strong>: As ever, we didn&apos;t have time to check in on all our favorite wargs and weirdos. We didn&apos;t check in with Bran, The Worst Teenager North Of The Wall, or his traveling companions, Meera Reed and Coldhands/Benjen Stark/Soap Opera Plotline Incarnate. Still no sign of Gilly, Sam and his family. Dany swooped in at the last second, but no sign of Daario 2.0 or the Dothraki horde, and Ser Friendstone is still off traveling the world.</p>

<p>We stopped by King&apos;s Landing, but a lot of people were missing, including Margaery and Loras Tyrell, the Queen of Thorns, Septa Unella, and the High Sparrow (aka Shoeless Zealot). We didn&apos;t check in with almost anyone in the North, including Jon Snow, Darth Sansa, Ser Davos, Melisandre, Lyanna Mormont, Wun Wun, or Tormund Eloquencebane. No Yara and Theon Greyjoy 3.0: The Reboot, no Children of the Forest, Night&apos;s King or White Walkers.</p>

<p>We didn&apos;t take a trip to the Iron Islands. No time for Winterfell either, so no Ramsay Bolton or Rickon Stark. No The Accent Formerly Known As Littlefinger or Robyn Arryn, aka Prepubescent Julian Casablancas. Still no sign of Dorne/Sand Snakes/Ellaria Sand since the premiere (we are very okay with that). We didn&apos;t see Walder Frey either.</p>

<p>Now to our regular absentees (which for the first time in three years, doesn&apos;t include Beric Dondarrion or Thoros of Myr!): no Previously On GoT Replay Of Joffrey Baratheon&apos;s Death, Previously On GoT Ghost Of Ned Stark&apos;s Manbun, or Previously On GoT Ghost Of Robert Baratheon&apos;s Unkempt Beard. No sign of Pirate Of Stannis Salladhor Saan (remember him?), no Hot Pie and as mentioned before, definitely no Gendry (you know! The guy on the rowboat!).</p>
