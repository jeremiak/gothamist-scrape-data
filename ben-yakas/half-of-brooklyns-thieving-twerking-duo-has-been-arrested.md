<p>One half of the thieving duo who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140206154655/http://gothamist.com/2013/12/11/video_brooklyn_thief_preps_with_hou.php#photo-3">twerked for an hour before robbing a Clinton Hill woman</a> this month has been arrested. Akintunde Mills, 47, has been charged for opening packages belonging to Brooklyn resident Lindsay Riddle and stealing more than $200 worth of clothing. You know, after his accomplice twerked on top of him and benches for over an hour outside of Riddle&apos;s apartment building.</p>

<p>&quot;Her endurance was rather impressive,&quot; Riddle, a 27-year-old Graphics Coordinator with VH1, told us about the incident, which took place on Dec. 4th. &quot;I&apos;m not exaggerating when I say she did this for an hour...For an entire hour. Rest breaks were had, but she got right back up and dropped it like it was hot, often times on the lap of the man.&quot;</p>

<p>Mills has been charged with burglary, possession of stolen property and criminal trespassing. His accomplice is still on the loose, still presumably <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140206154655/http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=twerk">rhythmic gyrating the lower fleshy extremities</a> in a lascivious manner. </p>
