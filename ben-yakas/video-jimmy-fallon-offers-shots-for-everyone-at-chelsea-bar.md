<p>On Thursday night, Jimmy Fallon <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509171027/http://gothamist.com/2014/04/12/jimmy_fallon_narrowly_escapes_east.php">narrowly escaped a brawl</a> at East Village bar Niagara.  &quot;Fallon was pretty shaken up,&quot; a source told the Daily News about the incident. &quot;He was at the wrong place at the wrong time, and chaos erupted around him.&quot; But apparently it didn&apos;t shake him up <em>too</em> much, since Fallon was back out on the town Friday night, giving out shots at a Chelsea bar&#x2014;and it was caught on video.</p>

<p>&quot;He knows the owner of the bar,&quot; Richie Alexander, who took the video, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509171027/http://pagesix.com/2014/04/12/jimmy-fallon-gets-rowdy-again-at-nyc-bar/?_ga=1.31545788.349300054.1312455005">told the Post</a> about the scene. &quot;I tried to buy him a shot, but he says he doesn&#x2019;t do shots, so I bought him a beer. I guess so many other people were offering to buy him a shot, that he just bought the whole bar a shot of vodka.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509171027/http://gothamist.com/tags/jimmyfallon">Fallon</a> has been known to take (in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509171027/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/13/opinion/sunday/a-wit-for-all-seasons.html?ref=maureendowd">words of Maureen Dowd</a>) his &quot;ingratiating boy next door&quot; vibe and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509171027/https://twitter.com/DerekHenryFlood/status/431488635846664192">step behind the bar</a> from time to time around the city. In 2009, he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509171027/http://www.eonline.com/news/155576/jimmy-fallon-late-night-bartender">jumped behind the bar</a> &quot;at Marc Forione and started pouring shots for everyone in the house,&quot; and he&apos;s been spotted even more recently than that doing so at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509171027/https://artiholics.com/2014/02/13/lou-reed-heaven-pie-sky-pizza-underground-macaulay-culkinbetty-t-kao/">Two Boots Williamsburg&#x2018;s opening party.</a></p>

<p>Alexander was cagey about exactly which bar Fallon was at, blaming his forgetfulness on drunkeness: &quot;We just walked in off the street,&#x201D; he explained. &quot;It was somewhere around 23rd and 10th.&quot; If you know what bar it was, let us know. </p>
