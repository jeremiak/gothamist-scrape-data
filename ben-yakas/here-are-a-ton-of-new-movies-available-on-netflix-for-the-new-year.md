<p>Last week, we turned to the great philosophers to try to make sense out of the fact that Netflix <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422200108/http://gothamist.com/2013/12/27/here_are_all_the_movies_expiring_on.php">was removing tons of awesome movies</a> as of January 1st, 2014. Why would the streaming gods spite us when we still hadn&apos;t gotten to see <em>50 First Dates</em>? Netflix may taketh, but it giveth in equal measure, for they have added a mountain of new movies that you can spend your snowcation binging on. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422200108/http://instantwatcher.com/titles/visual?infinite=1">Instant Watcher</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422200108/http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1u6yh8/surviving_the_new_years_eve_netflix_bloodbath_a/">Reddit</a> have compiled all the films, and below, you can see a handy list of some of the highlights.</p>

<p>As to why there are such overhauls of their collection, a spokesperson <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422200108/http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/netflixs-expiring-movies-what-to-watch-tonight-if-youre-staying-in/2013/12/31/76c7f19a-7238-11e3-8def-a33011492df2_story.html">explained to the Washington Post</a> this was a normal thing, &quot;due to the nature of licensing deals and windows renewing/expiring, we constantly have titles coming on &amp; off the service.&quot; </p>

<p>And if you really want to geek out on Netflix data, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422200108/http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/01/how-netflix-reverse-engineered-hollywood/282679/">The Atlantic obsessively (and impressively) analyzed</a> and reverse-engineered how Netflix&apos;s vocabulary and grammar work, only to discover the service has 76,897 unique ways to describe types of movies. They break down favorite locations, time periods, adjectives, actors and more to get to the heart of Emotional Independent Sports Movies and Visually-striking Goofy Action &amp; Adventure. And there&apos;s the added bonus of @darth photoshops as well!</p>
