<p>BREAKING NEWS: it&apos;s apparently an incredibly slow news day for the Daily News and NY Post. But is it really so slow that they need to resort to posting the same photos of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130619011030/http://gothamist.com/tags/alecbaldwin">Alec Baldwin</a> and Hilaria Baldwin&#x2014;maybe having an argument, maybe talking emphatically, maybe just being normal human beings&#x2014;while walking their dogs in the Village? We know not everyone has the fast track <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130619011030/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/11/photo_a_haunting_encounter_with_goo.php">on cyborgunicorn spotting</a>, but this is pretty pathetic even for them.</p>

<p>Oh sure, there&apos;s an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130619011030/http://www.nj.com/mercer/index.ssf/2013/05/trenton_standoff_with_armed_ma.html">intense hostage situation</a> happening in NJ and people are chomping at the bit <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130619011030/http://gawker.com/more-than-78-000-have-applied-to-die-on-mars-in-front-o-501686962">to go to Mars</a>, but instead, both newspapers have deemed these photos worthy of lengthy and intimate examination. </p>

<p>According <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130619011030/http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/gossip/alec-baldwin-wife-hilaria-heated-dispute-walk-article-1.1340859">to the News</a>, they &quot;seemed to be engaged in a heated dispute,&quot; and Hilaria &quot;looked upset as she turned away from Baldwin&#x2019;s tirade.&quot; Of course, a fried of the couple confirmed that &quot;there was absolutely no issue&quot; between them, answering the News&apos; own headline, but should that matter? Even if they were having a fight, who cares&#x2014;we thought the Daily News wasn&apos;t US Weekly, at least not yet.</p>

<p>But we have to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130619011030/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/photos_alec_baldwin_angry_walk_with_goUNWBxulLRlUMudX5x0HL">give the Post some credit</a>&#x2014;they at least used the photos as an opportunity to get poetic with their bile: </p>

<blockquote>Baldwin, clad in black slacks, black T-shirt and shades, brandished a cell phone in front of her face as she leaned back with her arms behind her. They then continued walking as <strong>Baldwin, his neck muscles taught and bulging with anger, continued yapping at his sad-faced wife. In one shot, the couple&apos;s two dogs stare at each other - as if they&#x2019;d seen it all before.</strong></blockquote>

<p>We&apos;re so happy the Post got their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130619011030/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/opinion/opedcolumnists/item_BaU8lygeOwWfjAnIAYW8MJ">in-house dog whisperer</a> to weigh in on this one. </p>
