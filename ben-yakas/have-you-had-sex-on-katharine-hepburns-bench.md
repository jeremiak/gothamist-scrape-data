title: Have You Had Sex On Katharine Hepburn's Bench?

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="22411epburn.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110225105819im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/22411epburn.jpg" width="240" height="237" class="image-left"> </span>We were teased with a touch of spring <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110225105819/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/18/call_for_photos_show_us_some_cargo.php">last Friday</a>, and it seems that some people went a little batshit crazy over it. Locals have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110225105819/http://www.dnainfo.com/20110223/murray-hill-gramercy/katharine-hepburn-bench-defiled-by-sex-drugs-volunteers-say">complained</a> that they&apos;ve spotted people engaging in sex acts on a bench in Dag Hammarskjold Plaza, as recently as last Friday. But this is no ordinary bench: it was owned by longtime resident Katharine Hepburn, and donated by her estate. And these were no ordinary sex acts: they were afternoon delights!</p>

<p>Sherrill Kazan, president of the volunteer group <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110225105819/http://www.hammarskjoldplaza.org/">Friends of Dag Hammarskjold Plaza</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110225105819/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/sex_and_drugs_disgrace_to_the_bench_T8G4wvkUVtgzTbEsSSztIN?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">told reporters</a> that she saw four women fooling around on the bench in broad daylight, while two men seemingly stood guard (while smoking weed) at &quot;4:30 in the afternoon.&quot; Police say they arrested three men for drug possession later that evening in the Plaza, which is a 1.5-acre garden and green space on East 47th Street and Second Avenue. </p>

<p>Kazan believes they were women from a nearby shelter, and hopes the added attention from police will keep the space clean of all the sexing: &quot;It&apos;s the environmental jewel of the East Side. The work that goes into this garden, you wouldn&apos;t have a clue,&quot; she <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110225105819/http://www.dnainfo.com/20110223/murray-hill-gramercy/katharine-hepburn-bench-defiled-by-sex-drugs-volunteers-say">told DNAInfo.</a> We contact Kazan for comment, but it&apos;s especially important they get this taken care of now, since the group wants to host outdoor movies&#x2014;but they are only allowed to do so during the afternoons, which could lead to some awkward run-ins.</p>
