Anthony Weiner was hard at work on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504174806/http://gothamist.com/2010/01/12/weiners_plan_to_make_diplomats_pay.php">a plan to make</a> diplomats pay for their $18 million worth of parking infractions. Weiner may have turned out to be a hypocrite&#x2014;he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504174806/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/29/anthony_weiner_owed_2180_in_dc_park.php">himself owed</a> $2,180 in unpaid Washington DC parking tickets&#x2014;in more ways than one, but his fight against diplomats&apos; ticket exceptions was left hanging in the wind. But <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504174806/http://blogs.forbes.com/jonbruner/2011/07/12/the-worlds-most-corrupt-diplomats-as-told-through-parking-tickets-map/#more-439">Forbes has taken to statistics</a> and maps to better expose the sordid underbelly of what Andrea Peyser <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504174806/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/national/ny_now_foreign_soiled_aO2qBVSSksO04WuZjDCjkI">once referred to as</a> those &quot;malodorous, greedy, drunk and demented&quot; foreign nationals.<p></p>

<p>In the graphs, Forbes compares two separate studies: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504174806/http://www.nber.org/papers/w12312">one compiled in 2006</a> which was a comprehensive list of diplomatic parking violations and staffing levels to find the countries with the most violations per U.N. diplomat; and one dealing with corruption scores from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504174806/http://www.transparency.org/policy_research/surveys_indices/cpi">Transparency International</a>. And the results? Statistically titillating, but unfortunately, ultimately not that illuminating: &quot;The correlation between political corruption and parking violations is statistically robust, but a quick comparison between the two maps suggests that it&#x2019;s not universal.&quot;</p>

<p>But there is a positive look at the future: since 2002, when the U.S. began withholding parking fines from foreign aid payments: violations fell by 90 percent immediately after the measure was passed. Uh, except for Egypt, who still owes $1.9 million in unpaid parking fines from last year alone. Check out the statistical maps in full below:</p>
