<p>There are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130522185545/http://www.gigwise.com/photos/66150/why-all-the-hate-noel-and-liam-gallaghers-angriest-quotes">some family feuds</a> you just do not want to have anything to do with&#x2014;throw in toilet paper accusations and threats, and you&apos;re in for a true shitstorm of emotions. Shared DNA and shared toilet facilities is apparently what did in siblings Howard Meltzer, 67, and Bernice Meltzer, 72&#x2014;Bernice called cops on her &quot;pee-ved&quot; brother after she had allegedly stolen the last roll of toilet paper from their bathroom this week. &quot;Five hours he was knocking on that door,&#x201D; a law-enforcement source <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130522185545/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/storm_in_zany_sibling_feud_RVj1I5kHnbYAdx9VZbKHrM?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Brooklyn">told the Post</a>. &#x201C;It sounds like he absolutely had to go bad.&#x201D; As Martin Lawrence would say: &quot;shit just got real.&quot;</p>

<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130522185545if_/http://www.youtube.com/embed/uvqJ1mTkEuY" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>The siblings, who have duel restraining orders on each other despite the fact that they live together in Midwood, got into a physical fight after the paper snatching. &#x201C;The roll was full when I went there in the morning,&#x201D; Howard explained to The Post after being released without bail. &#x201C;She unloaded a whole roll and left just a little, and when I looked up to the reserve, it wasn&#x2019;t there.&#x201D; Howard, who walks with a cane and sometimes uses a motorized scooter, said he knocked on her door for over five hours, till midnight Tuesday, trying to get the toilet roll from her.</p>

<p>Bernice was hit with a misdemeanor criminal-contempt charge and released without bail; Howard was arraigned on felony criminal-contempt charges. Both violated their orders of protection. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s crazy that you have two people fighting over toilet paper. I can only imagine what was going on with these two,&#x201D; the law-enforcement source told the Post. &#x201C;When you gotta go, you gotta go!&#x201D;</p>

<p>And the person who was most amused by this whole situation? <strong>&#x201C;The judge had a copy of the complaint in his hand and started laughing,&#x201D;</strong> the law-enforcement source added.</p>
