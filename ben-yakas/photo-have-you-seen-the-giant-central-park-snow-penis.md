<p>A few years ago, the Egyptian government <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160228022332/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/07/egypt_threatening_to_take_back_cleo.php">threatened to repossess Cleopatra&apos;s Needle</a>, the 69-foot-tall obelisk that was built around 1450 BC to honor Pharaoh Thutmose III, and ended up on a knoll in Central Park just behind the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1880. Well Egypt, Cleopatra&apos;s Needle is all yours&#x2014;we can give it the shaft now that a new phallic monument has been erected in Central Park.</p>

<p>The snow penis, which was apparently constructed sometime on Thursday during the snowstorm, is located in the East Green. It is one of eight designated &quot;Quiet Zones&quot; in Central Park, all the better to silently contemplate the vastness and vas deferens of this life.</p>

<p>This isn&apos;t the only impressive snow penis to go up in the tri-state area: three young woman from Rowan University in Glassboro, NJ spent a snow day <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160228022332/http://www.brobible.com/life/article/rowan-university-girls-snow-penis/">constructing their own detail-oriented hammerquist.</a> We should all be glad we live in a state that affords us the freedom to craft snow sculptures that truly reflect the passion of its creators.</p>
