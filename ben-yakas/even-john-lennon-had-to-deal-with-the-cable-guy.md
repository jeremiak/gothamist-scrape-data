<p>Yeah, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160420214945/http://gothamist.com/tags/johnlennon">John Lennon</a> wrote some pretty good songs and threw what were basically <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160420214945/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/12/video_vintage_footage_shows_most_am.php">the coolest parties ever</a>&#x2014;but he was also just a dude, like the rest of us! And that means he had to do everyday tasks like buy marmalade, get the gas tanks filled for both cars, and wait around for the HBO guy to come between 3 and 5. Of course, unlike us, Lennon likely made <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160420214945/http://www.brainpickings.org/index.php/2011/11/24/john-lennon-to-do-list/">the above to-do list</a> (which is being sold <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160420214945/https://www.gottahaverockandroll.com/LotDetail.aspx?lotid=7921&amp;searchby=0&amp;searchvalue=None&amp;page=0&amp;sortby=0&amp;displayby=2&amp;lotsperpage=25&amp;category=2&amp;seo=John-Lennon-Handwritten-%22To-Do%22-List">for $3,000 at auction</a>) for his personal assistant&#x2014;why else would he write down, &quot;Tell me about my Hair Dryer?&quot; Unless he really <em>was</em> just like us, and was losing his mind one household chore at a time.</p>
