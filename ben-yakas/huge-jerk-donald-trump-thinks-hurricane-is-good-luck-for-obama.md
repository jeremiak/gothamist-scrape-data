<p>We expect combover enthusiast <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160622155902/http://gothamist.com/tags/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> to be the classiest birther in the room at all times, so we&apos;re never really shocked when he pulls a stunt like attempting to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160622155902/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/24/video_donald_trumps_big_october_sur.php">publicly extort the president in the name of charity</a>. That&apos;s just Trump being Trump! But Trump may have reached classy nirvana today in a series of increasingly heinous and deplorable tweets in which he politicized Hurricane Sandy to attack Obama. If you&apos;ve ever wanted to stare into the void, here&apos;s your shot.</p>

<p>It IS true that there is literally nothing he need ever say ever again. While Obama critics like NJ Gov. Chris Christie have been able to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160622155902/http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2012/10/chris-christie-obama-sandy-romney.html?mid=twitter_nymag">rise above partisan bullshit to commend the president</a> on how he&apos;s handled the crisis and aided states in their recovery efforts, Trump once again lived up our expectations of him. Someone really should <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160622155902/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/25/videos_jon_stewart_and_stephen_colb.php">dip their enormous balls in his big mouth.</a></p>
