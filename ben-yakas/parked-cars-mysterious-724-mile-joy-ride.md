										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="83010joyride.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231094001im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/83010joyride.jpg" width="220" height="92" class="image-left"> </span>A Westchester couple who left their car in a long-term parking lot near JFK airport returned home 11 days later <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231094001/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2010/08/29/mileage-jump-has-couple-wondering-where-cars-been/">to find</a> it had accumulated 724 miles. It&apos;s a car mystery equivalent to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231094001/http://www.trivia-library.com/b/mystery-in-history-missing-portion-of-the-nixon-watergate-tape.htm">18 minute gap</a>: will we ever know what happened during those 724 miles?</p>

<p>Mimi and Ulrich Gunthart, of Briarcliff Manor, saw a news report last month about parking lot attendants abusing customers vehicles, and marked down their cars mileage before dropping it off. &quot;It was like a game. We never expected it to happen to us,&quot; Mimi <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231094001/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/bmw_park_joy_ride_afXZ7ZU8z5rO7ldS2THLCI?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">said</a>.</p>

<p>They were in for another surprise when they picked their car up from the AviStar parking lot; an instructional Russian-language CD they had in the car came on blasting at full volume. There was also a small ink stain on the passenger seat, but no other damage to the car, and no charges on their E-Z pass. David Menter, a regional manager for AviStar, said the company &quot;found nothing out of the ordinary&quot; looking over its inventory logs. Despite what they presume was a 724 mile joy ride, the Gunthart&apos;s aren&apos;t holding it against the lot. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231094001/http://www.motorator.com/videos/307">guys in the picture</a> appreciate it.</p>
