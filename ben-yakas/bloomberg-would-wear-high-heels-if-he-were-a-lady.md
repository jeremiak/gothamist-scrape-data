title: Bloomberg Would Wear High Heels If He Were A Lady

                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="101713bloomberg.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203061415im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/101713bloomberg.jpeg" width="640" height="422"> <br> <i> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203061415/http://www.shutterstock.com/pic-141561031/stock-photo-beautiful-alluring-woman.html?src=8AV43-oq_72762-5XokR0w-1-58">Shutterstock/ kiuikson</a></i></div> <p></p>

<p>It turns out <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203061415/http://gothamist.com/tags/bloomberg">Mayor Bloomberg</a> shares a lot more in common with Sarah Jessica Parker than we ever imagined: in a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203061415/http://www.newyorker.com/talk/2013/10/21/131021ta_talk_mead">Talk Of The Town piece</a> in this week&apos;s New Yorker, Bloomberg discusses his fondness for high heels:  &quot;I like women and I think that they look stunning in high heels&#x2014;not that they look bad without high heels. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203061415/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/07/bloomberg_calls_bill_de_blasio_camp.php">I wouldn&apos;t criticize anybody</a>,&quot; Bloomberg reportedly said. <strong>&quot;But, if I were a woman, I think I would wear high heels.&quot;</strong></p>

<p>For all you Bloomberg fanatics out there, this is hardly a surprise: Hizzoner&apos;s passion for a sturdy pair of Manolo Blahnik&apos;s came to light last January in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203061415/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/28/look_at_the_ass_on_her_stuff_bloomb.php">NY Magazine profile of Christine Quinn</a>, when she revealed that Bloomberg &#x201C;likes me in high heels&quot; and would &quot;yell at me&quot; for wearing flats. </p>

<p>While Bloomberg may have a high heel fetish worthy of Rex Ryan, he doesn&apos;t have any desire to start wearing them right now: &quot;I don&apos;t care if a woman is taller than me, with or without heels,&quot; he told the New Yorker. &quot;I just like women.&quot; Hmm, some might say that he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203061415/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/18/watch_fran_lebowitz_hilariously_psy.php">doth protest a bit too much on that height stuff.</a></p>
