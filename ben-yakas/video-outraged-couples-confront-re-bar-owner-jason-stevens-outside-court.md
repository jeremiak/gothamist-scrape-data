<p>Infamous reBar owner Jason Stevens made a brief but noisy appearance in Brooklyn Criminal Court this morning. Stevens, 40, was on hand to plead not guilty to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502110041/http://gothamist.com/2014/05/15/rebar_owner_arrested.php">tax fraud charges and grand larceny</a>. Upon arrival he was showered with insults by more than a dozen unhappy couples who had been left in the lurch when Stevens <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502110041/http://gothamist.com/2014/05/09/dumbo_rebar_closed.php">abruptly shuttered reBar</a> two weeks ago. &quot;Here we are thinking you&#x2019;re a nice guy and you were just pulling a wedding Ponzi scheme,&quot; said Fabienne Fhal, who lost $12.5K when her June 8th wedding was canceled, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502110041/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20140522/dumbo/angry-couples-lash-out-at-former-rebar-owner-amid-plea-negotiations">according to DNAInfo</a>. &quot;Now you are using our money to pay your bail. I hope your kids are proud of you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If you think we&#x2019;re not going to sue the living crap out of you, you&#x2019;re wrong!&quot; she also shouted. &quot;Disgusting! You are disgusting!&quot; Others in the crowd were holding signs and yelling, &quot;Jason Stevens is a thief,&quot; &quot;Where&#x2019;s our money?&quot; and &quot;Stealing is a crime!&quot;</p>

<p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;d never seen him before in person so seeing him today was sickening,&#x201D; Heather Epstein, who lost a $20K deposit at reBar, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502110041/http://nypost.com/2014/05/22/angry-couples-confront-bar-owner-who-stole-wedding-deposits/">told the Post</a>. &quot;He stole a piece of my wedding,&#x201D;&#x200B; Epstein said. Stevens reportedly kept quiet and spent most of his court appearance fiddling with his phone. &quot;Seeing him right now without anything to say is really frustrating,&#x201D; Steve Obeng <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502110041/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/bar-owner-accused-stealing-deposit-money-article-1.1801977">told the News</a>. &quot;There was no remorse in him,&#x201D; added Obeng&#x2019;s wife-to-be Suzanne Budesa.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502110041/http://gothamist.com/2014/05/11/rebar_owner_owed_irs_millions_claim.php">Some former employees told us</a> that Stevens made off with around $150,000 in wedding deposit checks and $27,000 in cash. Stevens had been audited by the IRS last year, and those former staffers suggest he owed $2.5-3 million in unpaid sales tax from between 2009-2012.</p>

<p>A prosecutor indicated that a settlement might be reached in the case by the next court date June 12th, a deal which would not include criminal charges. However, the NYC Department of Consumer Affairs confirmed that they were working with the Kings County DA on the investigation, and many couples <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502110041/http://gothamist.com/2014/05/15/rebar_workers_save_day.php">are still planning</a> on joining together for a class action lawsuit.</p>
