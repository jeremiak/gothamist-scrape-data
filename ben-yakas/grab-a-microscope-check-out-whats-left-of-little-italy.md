<p>Things have been getting worse and worse for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429110641/http://gothamist.com/tags/littleitaly">Little Italy</a> over the last decade (see: the battle over the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429110641/http://gothamist.com/tags/sangennaro">San Gennaro festival</a>), and they only seem to be getting ...worser. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429110641/http://nypost.com/2014/03/30/changing-times-pushing-little-italy-to-brink-of-extinction/">NY Post has a story</a> today all about how Little Italy is dying due to rent increases and the changing demographics of the neighborhood, and it sounds like your children won&apos;t have a Little Italy to visit in the future: &quot;You can&#x2019;t rebuild Little Italy,&quot; said Robert Ianniello Jr., owner of Umbertos Clam House. &quot;If we go away, it will never be here again. You can&#x2019;t build an Olive Garden and say it&#x2019;s Little Italy.&quot;</p>

<p>Ianniello points to exorbitant rent increases as one of the major problems, saying he&apos;s received rent bills from a new landlord nearly twice what he had been previously paying: &#x201C;It&#x2019;s a landlord problem,&#x201D; said Ianniello, who also heads the Little Italy Merchants Association. &#x201C;They think this is Fifth Avenue.&#x201D; At least eight eateries have shuttered over the last year, including Giovanna&#x2019;s, Positano Ristorante, and S.P.Q.R., all of which were force to closed due to rent increases.</p>

<p>In addition, there&apos;s the matter of the changing shape of the neighborhood: Little Italy used to stretch from Lafayette Street to the Bowery and from Kenmare to Canal Streets. Now it&apos;s been reduced to about three blocks. In 1950 almost half of the 10,000 NYers living in the area identified themselves as Italian-American (2,149 of them were even born in Italy), but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429110641/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/22/would_the_last_italian_in_little_it.php">as of the most recent census</a>, only 5% of the 8,600 area residents called themselves Italian-American, and not one of them had been born in Italy. 4,400 of them were immigrants however, with 89% of them hailing from Asia.</p>

<p>&quot;Right now, there is just enough of a population to keep up traditions,&#x201D; Italian historian Emelise Aleandri told the Post. &quot;But it&#x2019;s going to be more difficult to keep the area Italian if the merchants and businesses leave&quot; Also not helping anything: losing patrons to ginormous <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429110641/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/13/little_italy_losing_customers_to_be.php">Flatiron Italian food emporium Eataly</a>, and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429110641/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/31/just_call_it_little_ital-bee.php#photo-1">occasional bee attacks</a> which have plagued the area in recent years.</p>

<p>Of course, people have been writing obituaries for Little Italy for a while now: &quot;Little Italy has become Littler Italy,&quot; Joseph V. Scelsa, president of the Italian American museum, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429110641/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/24/nyregion/24museum.html">noted in 2007.</a></p>
