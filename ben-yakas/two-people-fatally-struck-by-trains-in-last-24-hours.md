<p>Three people were struck by trains, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509165625/http://gothamist.com/tags/subwayfatalities">two fatally</a>, over the last two days. According to FDNY, the most recent incident happened this morning just after 6 a.m. A man struck by a southbound E train as it pulled into the 23rd Street station near 8th Avenue in Manhattan. Police say the unidentified man was in the tunnel when he was struck; he was declared dead at the scene.</p>

<p>Then last night around 9:20 p.m., another man was fatally struck by an F train at the Second Avenue station near E. Houston Street. Police say he is believed to have jumped in front of the train, but the investigation is ongoing. And on Thursday, a man was struck by a northbound M train at the Bryant Park station around 6 a.m. He was taken to Bellevue Hospital in critical condition.</p>

<p>At least <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509165625/http://gothamist.com/2014/02/21/at_least_six_people_ended_up_on_the.php">six people either fell</a> onto the subway tracks, or were struck by a subway the week before, including one person who died. And earlier this month, comedian Liza Dye <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509165625/http://gothamist.com/2014/02/15/comedian_struck_by_train_after_text.php">was struck by a train</a> after she slipped and fell (and/or fainted) on the platform while texting and walking.</p>
