<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427150448/http://gothamist.com/tags/bedbugs">bedbug assault</a> on our mass transit system seemed to slip off a bit this week, but it might be back with a vengeance: the MTA confirmed that they are investigating reports of bedbugs on the 7 train. Excuse us one moment, we&apos;ll be right back.</p>

<p>Straphanger Kedem Deletis <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427150448/http://www.businessinsider.com/mta-investigating-bedbugs-on-nyc-subway-7-train-2014-8">told Business Insider that</a> he&apos;s a regular 7 line rider, and saw the bugs on his commute from Woodside to Bryant Park: &quot;This morning, I noticed them coming out from under the seat to feed on people&apos;s legs,&quot; Deletis told them. &quot;I was on the 7 express train which arrived at Bryant Park at 10 a.m. The cart I was in was one or two carts behind the center operator cart.&quot; </p>

<p>Here&apos;s an exclusive photo of the train&apos;s bedbug riddled exterior:</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="0813147trainbugs.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427150448im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_arts_john/0813147trainbugs.jpg" width="640" height="480"> <br> <i> Photograph by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427150448/https://www.flickr.com/photos/intexp7/8611905748">InTexp7/Flickr</a> (Jen Chung)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>Deletis called the MTA to report it, and was asked what kind of proof he had: &quot;What exactly should I have done? Raised a panic on the train and have people screaming and hurt?&quot; Deletis asked. &quot;Maybe captured one of these bedbugs and risk bringing one home?&quot;</p>

<p>So far this month there have been bedbugs found <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427150448/http://gothamist.com/2014/08/06/bed_bugs_on_the_n_train.php">on at least</a> three <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427150448/http://gothamist.com/2014/08/07/bedbugs_n_train_subway.php">N trains</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427150448/http://gothamist.com/2014/08/09/5_train_taken_out_of_service_becaus.php">one 5 train, and possibly one 4 train.</a> We&apos;ll update the post once we hear more about the MTA&apos;s investigation, unless of course they find bedbugs, in which case <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427150448/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FPELc1wEvk">RUN AWAY.</a></p>
