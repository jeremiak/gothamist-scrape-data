The Journal <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150415224522/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB20001424052748703357104575045584007339958.html#mod=todays_us_nonsub_page_one">investigates</a> the lack of punchy, original new band names in the age of Google and MySpace. They find that even a super group consisting of Dave Grohl, John Paul Jones and Josh Homme couldn&apos;t get their first choice for a name, Caligula, because it was already taken by at least seven other acts, including a defunct techno outfit from Australia. Instead, they used Them Crooked Vultures, which the Journal points out, &quot;held no special meaning.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150415224522/http://www.rovicorp.com/">Rovi Corp.</a>, a licensing company, says they added an average of 6,521 new band names a month to their databases last year; <strong>the most commonly used names are Bliss (18 bands), followed by Mirage and One (15 each), and then Gemini, Legacy, Paradox and Rain.</strong>  At least we can feel assured that there&apos;s no lack of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150415224522/http://www.cracked.com/article_15118_the-25-most-ridiculous-band-names-in-rock-history.html">terrible names.</a><p></p>

<p>It&apos;s especially a problem in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150415224522/http://nymag.com/arts/popmusic/features/61879/">Brooklyn</a>, where thirteen new bands seem to pop up every day. They point to the story of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150415224522/http://www.myspace.com/thisisdiscovery">Discovery</a>, Kathleen Cholewka&apos;s Brooklyn-based band which she started in 2004. Lo and behold, another <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150415224522/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discovery_%28band%29">Discovery</a> started in Brooklyn in 2005, and the two were even mistaken for one another in Time Out New York listings. Her name-rights feud transferred to the battlefields of Wikipedia: &quot;Using the open-access encyclopedia, she made edits to the entry for a more prominent Discovery, formed by members of the successful rock bands Vampire Weekend and Ra Ra Riot. Ms. Cholewka wrote that her band &apos;rightfully owns the trademark&apos; to Discovery, based on her paid gigs in New York clubs. She also added a few jabs about her opponent&apos;s music.&quot; One of them should just change their name to Discovery.Com!</p>

<p>To aid the aspiring indie rocker coming up with an unforgettable name, here are a few easy suggestions: Grizzly Nair, The Pain of Being Kevin Smith&apos;s Armrest, The Saxonphone Uprising, Bathsiderodromophobia, and Taint Misbehavin&apos;. Okay, that last one is more of a freaky porn title, but Pissed Jeans is taken. </p>
