<p>The RV is gone, the meth empire has crumbled, and breakfast is no longer being served: after 61 episodes of vicarious thrills and agonizing sympathy pains, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203070411/http://gothamist.com/tags/breakingbad"><em>Breaking Bad</em></a> will air its finale this Sunday at 9 p.m. on AMC. And while some people haven&apos;t watched the show due to some <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203070411/http://entertainment.time.com/2013/09/26/why-i-dont-watch-breaking-bad/">mixture of laziness and stubbornness</a>, many more are salivating at the prospect of one last ride through the ABQ. And many of those people are positing their own (likely wrong) theories about the finale online.</p>

<p>Bryan Cranston has called the ending <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203070411/http://www.eonline.com/news/461675/bryan-cranston-teases-breaking-bad-s-series-finale-at-emmys-we-have-to-see-if-anyone-survives-the-holocaust">&quot;perfect&quot; and &quot;unapologetic&quot;</a>; creator Vince Gilligan has said he and the writers took inspiration from <em>Casablanca</em>, and notes <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203070411/http://www.vulture.com/2013/01/vince-gilligan-on-writing-breaking-bad-finale.html">the ending is &quot;polarizing.&quot;</a> Other than that, all we know is that &quot;woodworking&quot; will somehow come up (Gilligan mentioned that on &quot;Talking Bad&quot; last week). In an age of leaked episodes and rampant spoilers, it&apos;s kind of amazing to realize that no one really has any solid idea what is going to happen in the finale. But that hasn&apos;t stopped rampant speculation! </p>

</ul>

<p>Most likely, most (if not all) of these theories will be wrong, but that doesn&apos;t change the fact you still have approximately 52 hours to fill until the final episode. In the meantime, you can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203070411/http://www.vulture.com/2013/09/seitz-11-favorite-breaking-bad-episodes.html?mid=twitter_vulture">revisit classic old episodes</a>, watch <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203070411/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xly33prLXvg">emotional supercuts</a>, and recall every <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203070411/http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/television/2013/09/jesse_from_breaking_bad_video_every_bad_thing_that_s_happened_to_jesse_pinkman.html">horrible thing that has happened to Jesse Pinkman</a>. You should also probably <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203070411/http://previously.tv/saturday-night-live/will-happen-tina-fey-hosts-time/">tune into SNL,</a> just in case.</p>

<p>Our only prediction: we wouldn&apos;t be shocked if the finale&apos;s cold open showed Walt back in the classroom taking attendance, meeting new student Jesse Pinkman for the first time. But like all <em>Breaking Bad</em> theories, we&apos;re probably dinging up the wrong tree.</p>
