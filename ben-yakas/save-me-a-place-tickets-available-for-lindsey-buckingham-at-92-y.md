<p>Our fingers are still tingling with anticipation over the news that our favorite late-&apos;70s world conquering pop band Fleetwood Mac <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424153937/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/31/fleetwood_mac_will_tour_next_year.php">may very well probably be touring</a> next year. But while we appreciate <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424153937/http://gothamist.com/tags/stevienicks">Stevie Nicks</a> as much as the next crystal vision lover, we&apos;ve always been bigger fans of the hugely under-appreciated guitarist/singer Lindsey Buckingham&#x2014;which is why we&apos;re also excited about the fact that Buckingham will be coming back to the city solo later in the fall!</p>

<p>On Friday, November 4th, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424153937/http://www.92y.org/Uptown/Event/Lindsey-Buckingham.aspx">Buckingham comes to 92nd Street Y</a> for a conversation with Rolling Stone contributing editor Anthony DeCurtis on his career, including the tumultuous years with the Mac and his critically acclaimed solo albums. It&apos;s unclear whether he&apos;ll be performing any songs, but we certainly hope so! </p>

<p>Below check three fantastic Buckingham videos from across his career: the music video for his <em>National Lampoon</em> mega hit &quot;Holiday Road,&quot; vintage video of him recording &quot;Save Me A Place&quot; for Mac&apos;s masterpiece <em>Tusk</em>, and an emotional live performance of &quot;Never Going Back Again&quot; with Stevie Nicks.</p>
