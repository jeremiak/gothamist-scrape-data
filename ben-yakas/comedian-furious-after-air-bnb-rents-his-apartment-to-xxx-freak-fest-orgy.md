<p>A comedian is furious after he unknowingly rented out his Manhattan apartment on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508172637/http://gothamist.com/tags/airbnb">AirBNB</a> to an orgy&#x2014;and he fears he will be evicted now. &quot;I&apos;ve got to move,&quot; comedian <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508172637/http://ariteman.com/t/">Ari Teman</a> told us. &quot;We don&apos;t think it&apos;s safe here now given 50 pimps and prostitutes know the address and might be upset at getting caught. Plus, it just feels disgusting to be here right now.&quot;</p>

<p>Teman had decided to rent out his luxury studio apartment for the weekend to &quot;David,&quot; a &#x201C;Verified&#x201D; AirBNB member with multiple positive reviews who wrote him, &quot;I am looking for a place for my brother and sister in law who visiting for a wedding this weekend. I just don&#x2019;t have the space for them.&quot; After handing over the keys to &quot;David&quot; Friday afternoon, Teman realized he forgot a bag, and showed up around 11:30 p.m. to grab it. That&apos;s when he discovered that this was no wedding party: instead, it was an &#x201C;XXX Freak Fest&#x201D; orgy.</p>

<p>Teman then found out that the cell phone number &quot;David&quot; had left with him is the same one seen in the photo below to call &#x201C;TWINN&#x201D; for the location of a &#x201C;BBW PANTY RAID PARTY&#x201D; in a post by &#x201C;The Black Dr. Ruth&#x201D;</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="31614org.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508172637im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/31614org.jpg" width="640" height="343"> <br> <i> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508172637/http://dearairbnb.tumblr.com/">via Tenan</a></i></div> <p></p>

<p>Teman says there are &quot;over $87,076 in losses&quot; because of the party&#x2014;that includes a broken sofa, bed, torn lamp, coffee table, drum set, and a Fender guitar. In addition, his clothing was mysteriously wet (&quot;I don&#x2019;t even want to know how it&#x2019;s wet,&quot; he noted), plus condoms and liquor lying around. But even worse, he can&apos;t look his fellow tenants in the eye anymore, and his super wants to evict him. Teman wrote <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508172637/http://dearairbnb.tumblr.com/">in an impassioned Tumblr post:</a></p>

<blockquote>I enjoy a &#x201C;Festival&#x201D; as much as the next fellow, but this is a family building and some people don&#x2019;t enjoy having their neighbor&#x2019;s worldly possessions tossed in a pile into the common area, while a group of strangers form a pile to have their private areas tossed. As such, I&#x2019;m going to be evicted.</blockquote>

<p>We got no answer when we called the number for &quot;TWINN&quot; listed above, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508172637/http://gawker.com/man-unwittingly-rents-out-apartment-on-airbnb-for-xxx-1544961941?utm_campaign=socialflow_gawker_twitter&amp;utm_source=gawker_twitter&amp;utm_medium=socialflow">Gawker says they got through</a> and spoke with a man who identified himself as &quot;David.&quot; He insisted that he did nothing wrong, there was no party, and anyway, his rental agreement with Teman stated that he could have up to 50 guests (a claim Teman disputes).</p>

<p>Teman was understandably angry at AirBNB, but he says they&apos;ve been very receptive since he initially contacted them and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508172637/http://dearairbnb.tumblr.com/">wrote the post</a>, wiring him $23,817 and sending someone to change his locks: &quot;AirBNB has been in contact every day. Their staff has been helpful,&quot; Teman told us. <strong>&quot;AirBNB is putting me in a hotel for a week.&quot;</strong></p>

<p>AirBNB also sent Gawker this statement:</p>

<blockquote>Over 11 million guests have had a safe and positive experience on Airbnb and problems for hosts and guests are incredibly rare, but when they happen, we try to help make things right. We were appalled when we learned about this incident and we took immediate action to help this host. The individual who rented this space has been permanently removed from our site. We&apos;ve reimbursed the host for damages to his apartment and ensured he has a new place to stay. In the days ahead, we&apos;ll continue to work with the host to assist him with his additional needs and we will work cooperatively with any law enforcement agencies that investigate this matter.</blockquote>
