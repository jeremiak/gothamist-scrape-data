<p>Earlier this month, a pit bull puppy was hospitalized with a broken neck after being brutally thrown from a moving car in Long Island. Three-month-old pup Joey, who was tossed out in a trash bag, fractured six neck vertebrae when he hit the ground. But good news! Joey was discharged from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424161155/http://www.vmcli.com/">Veterinary Medical Center of Long Island in West Islip</a> on Friday&#x2014;he&apos;s walking again, he can bark, he&apos;s eating, he&apos;ll be up for adoption in one month! &quot;We are not 100 percent sure he will ever walk normally, but he will be able to walk and run,&quot; Dr. Lynda Loudon-Sheppard, chief of emergency medicine, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424161155/http://www.newsday.com/long-island/suffolk/abused-pit-bull-puppy-gets-back-on-his-paws-1.3945195">told Newsday.</a></p>

<p>In addition to his neck injuries, doctors say the three-month old was malnourished, covered with fleas, and had bite marks on his neck, which might indicate the pup had been used as a bait dog by dog fighters. But he&apos;s much improved after three weeks at the veterinary center: &quot;He&apos;s doing very well,&quot; said  Loudon-Sheppard. &quot;He tires very easily, but he&apos;s much stronger than we ever expected at this stage.&quot; </p>

<p>Nevertheless, he&apos;ll still need months of care and physical therapy twice a day. His custom neck brace will arrive this week from Canada. Later, he will strengthen leg muscles on a water treadmill&#x2014;an adorable water treadmill we bet.
