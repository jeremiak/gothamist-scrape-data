<p>It&apos;s understandable that one might start to feel frustrated after they hear John Lennon&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111212100121/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yN4Uu0OlmTg">&quot;Happy Xmas (War Is Over)&quot;</a> for the nine hundredth time in the background of Starbucks&#x2014;and though it may sometimes feel like the only good Christmas song by one of The Beatles, there were plenty of other ones recorded by the group that have been forgotten over the years. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111212100121/https://twitter.com/#!/WFMU/status/145903178616012800">WFMU pointed out</a> a nifty list of all the rare fan club-only Beatles Christmas singles from between &apos;63-&apos;69&#x2014;you can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111212100121/http://www.norwegianwood.org/beatles/disko/html/xmas2.html">download MP3s of all the tunes here.</a></p>

<p>The records run the gamut including everything from covers of holiday classics (&quot;Jingle Bells&quot;) to poems (John Lennon&apos;s &quot;Jock &amp; Yono&quot; and &quot;Once Upon a Pool Table&quot;). Besides the goofy collages and spoken word tracks, there is at least one pretty cool rock song, &quot;Christmas Time is Here Again.&quot; Oh sure, nothing could possibly top &quot;Wonderful Christmas Time,&quot; but for Beatles lovers (and who isn&apos;t?), it&apos;s a fun, little-paid attention to corner of their discography. Below, check out some of our favorites, including the aforementioned &quot;Christmas Time Is Here Again,&quot; the piano improv &quot;Everywhere It&apos;s Christmas,&quot; and more. Happy Crimble!</p>
