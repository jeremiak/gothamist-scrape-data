                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:200px; "> <img alt="9211deathpenalty.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130729174246im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/9211deathpenalty.jpg" width="200" height="303"> <br> <i>Ronnell Wilson in 2007</i></div> The man who was previously found guilty and sentenced to death for the 2003 murder of two undercover police officers in Staten Island <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130729174246/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/staten_island/stupid_defense_from_si_cop_killer_vZ0PkNGr5MRaR7c66Vc5RL">has a new defense strategy</a> to avoid the death penalty during his &quot;penalty phase&quot; retrial next year. The lawyer for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130729174246/http://gothamist.com/tags/ronellwilson">Ronnell Wilson</a> called him &quot;mentally incompetent&quot; during a hearing in Brooklyn federal court, and argued that he may not be eligible for the death penalty as a result.<p></p>

<p>Defense lawyer David Stern said that he planned to have Wilson examined by a shrink, and also gather testimony from friends and relatives who knew him growing up: &quot;There was no investigating [of his mental capacity] done during the first trial,&quot; said Stern, who didn&apos;t represent Wilson during that first trial. A 2002 Supreme Court case barred the execution of the mentally retarded. Even though Wilson was sentenced to death in 2007 for killing the officers in a gun buy-and-bust operation, it was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130729174246/http://gothamist.com/2010/06/30/death_penalty_sentence_vacated_for.php">tossed on appeal</a> last year.</p>

<p>Relatives of the two officers Wilson was convicted of killing, Detectives Rodney Andrews and James Nemorin, were upset with the new strategy. Detectives Endowment Association President Michael Palladino called it a &quot;charade&quot; and <strong>&quot;an insult to the individuals who God did not bless with an intellect.&quot;</strong></p>
