And once you&apos;re in that club, it&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428172515/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/08/judge_bars_landlords_from_evicting.php">pretty difficult</a> to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428172515/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/12/faye_dunaway_now_claims_nyc_is_her.php">kick you out</a>. But one landlord has allegedly come up with a novel new way to try to get some septuagenarian rent-stabilized tenants to scram: spread rumors that they&apos;re incestuous!<p></p>

<p>At least that&apos;s what 75-year-old Clara Sharma and her 71-year-old roommate-brother Charles Steene <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428172515/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/sibs_fight_incest_rent_slap_8nJuSsekKMzF4wjRIZv9bO?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">claim their landlord is doing</a> to them. Sharma, who moved to her three-room, prewar apartment at 600 W 111th Street in 1964, told the Post she believes the landlord, R.A. Cohen &amp; Associates, has been telling other residents that she sleeps with her brother. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s character assassination. I&#x2019;m not that kind of person.<strong> I was never that hard up that I would tap on family</strong>,&#x201D; she said.</p>

<p>In addition, she believes they reported the siblings to Adult Protective Services and also told neighbors she was mentally unstable. In her $50 million lawsuit filed last week, she said neighbor Alan Messmann called her &#x201C;wacky&#x201D; last year, and then referred to her as &#x201C;an incestuous little witch.&#x201D; At least no children have been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428172515/http://www.metatube.com/en/videos/67176/Damn-It-Feels-Good-to-be-a-Lannister/">thrown out of a window of a tower in Winterfell</a> because of this alleged relationship...yet.</p>
