<p>A Bronx woman was stabbed 40 times by a stranger with a rusty steak knife last month&#x2014;and despite being stabbed in the heart, she survived. Alyssa Wilcynski, 35, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160723173731/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/bronx/woman_stabbed_times_lives_u2XfvVGEgi287u5UO2IeUP">told the Post</a> she was heading to her Mott Haven apartment around 10:40 p.m. on March 15th when the attacker followed her into her building. She said he came at her with the blade on the stairs near the sixth floor, and she fought back by biting him on the neck and arm, but the attack was too much: &#x201C;It knocked me out for a split second,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;He must have thought I was dead...I knew I was going to die.&#x201D;</p>

<p>A neighbor found her in a pool of blood, and told Wilcynski&#x2019;s husband, 38-year-old Patrick Sotomayor, that his wife had just been stabbed. She was rushed to Lincoln Hospital, where she underwent open-heart surgery, as well as stomach and kidney operations. &#x201C;God was with me, because I didn&#x2019;t die,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;The doctors were great. They saved my life.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Police have not found the suspect yet, and the investigation is ongoing. &#x201C;He pierced her heart,&#x201D; said Wilcynski&apos;s husband. &#x201C;He&#x2019;s still out there. I want him off the street&#x2014;he&#x2019;s an animal.&#x201D;</p>
