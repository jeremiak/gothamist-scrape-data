<p>Mayor Bloomberg&apos;s final State Of The City address is underway (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429162013/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/14/video_watch_bloombergs_final_state.php">watch it here</a>), but there already is some seriously questionable fanfare going on there. Most prominently, there are &quot;sports banners&quot; hung around the Barclays Center touting various crime stats. It&apos;s one thing to be self-congratulatory and to proclaim in an email that you&apos;ll be stepping onstage to &quot;Empire State Of Mind&quot; after a children&apos;s dance performance set to Vanilla Ice&#x2019;s &#x201C;Ice Ice Baby.&#x201D; (this really happened). It&apos;s another thing to treat &quot;Fire Fatalities&quot; and homicides like they&apos;re retired basketball superstars. To be sure, the NYPD and FDNY have done a commendable job keeping NYC safe, but every number on those triumphant banners represents <em>people who are now dead.</em></p>

<p>The NYPD was proud enough <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429162013/http://twitpic.com/c3q1jc">they also Tweeted a photo</a> of one of the banners. It&apos;s really too bad about their tone-deafness, considering the fact we were really starting to get into the pre-event DJ set, which included cutting-edge tunes such as &quot;Jamboree&quot; by Naughty By Nature, &quot;Sexual Healing&quot; by Shaggy ft. Marvin Gaye, and &quot;Where My Girls At&quot; by 702.</p>
