<p>A woman is in critical condition after being shot during an alleged home invasion in Queens. According to cops, the 22-year-old woman was shot around 9 a.m. Sunday in an apartment on 127th Street in Kew Gardens. She was transported to Jamaica Hospital where she underwent surgery. Police say she is still in critical condition and no arrests have been made, but at least one person is being questioned.</p>

During a struggle with the attackers, the boyfriend claims one of the guns went off, hitting the woman. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420034259/http://www.nydailynews.com/blogs/theshack/2014/02/man-says-home-invaders-shot-his-girlfriend-in-head">The News says</a> that the woman was struck in the forehead by the bullet. The boyfriend then drove her to the hospital, which police confirmed.</p>

<p>&quot;Sounded like a heavy hammer,&quot; neighbor Charlie Webber told the Post about what he heard this morning. &quot;It scared me. It got my attention. But they&#x2019;ve been doing construction next door so I figured it was just them.&quot; Another neighbor added that the couple fight regularly: &quot;You can hear the woman screaming,&quot; said Carlos Gomez. &quot;This has been happening since they moved in four months ago.&quot;</p>
