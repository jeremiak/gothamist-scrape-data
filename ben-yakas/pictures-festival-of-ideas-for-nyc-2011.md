This past week, we <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150918185435/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/04/nyc_of_2030_is_filled_with_organic.php">took a look</a> at five architects&apos; futuristic renderings of NYC in the year 2030, which included quite a lot of algae. The project is part of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150918185435/http://www.festivalofideasnyc.com/">Festival Of Ideas For The New City</a>, which has been taking place around Lower Manhattan all week. Yesterday was the StreetFest along the Bowery, where inventors, designers, urban farmers, tinkerers, and artists could all showcase their various projects. Among the hundreds of organizations taking part in the event was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150918185435/http://www.artinoddplaces.org/">Art In Odd Places</a>, whose members include Ari Tabei, Nicholas Fraser, Edith Raw, and Gretchen Vitamvas&#x2014;you can see examples of all their works above. Click through to see some of the highlights, including crocheted people, giant girlzilla&apos;s, and gowns made of trash.</p>
