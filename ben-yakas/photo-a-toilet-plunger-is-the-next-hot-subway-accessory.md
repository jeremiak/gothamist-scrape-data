<p>It all seems so obvious after you look at the photo. We&apos;ve already descended into an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509151731/http://gothamist.com/tags/subwayetiquette">etiquette-less society underground</a>, hellbent on disturbing one another with our bare feet, our nail clippings, our banana peels and our hanging brains. We already treat the subway like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509151731/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/08/photo_what_compels_a_human_being_to.php">our personal toilet</a>&#x2014;so we can all learn something from this young woman, who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509151731/http://en.rocketnews24.com/2013/06/21/toiletally-crazy-woman-takes-the-plunge-on-the-subway/">re-contextualized her toilet plunger</a> and put it to far better use in a Tokyo subway car.
