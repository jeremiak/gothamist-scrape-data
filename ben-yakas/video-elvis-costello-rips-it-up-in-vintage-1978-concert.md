<p>While most people were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502142123/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/21/what_time_is_the_mayan_apocalypse.php">waiting for the end of the world</a> yesterday, we stumbled upon this absolutely essential vintage Elvis Costello concert footage&#x2014;and yes, he does perform his own &quot;Waiting For The End Of The World.&quot; Costello and the Attractions performed live at WDR Studio-L in Cologne on June 15th, 1978, rolling through a blistering 13 song set for Rockpalast television. Watch it in full below, and don&apos;t be worried about any invisible shivers running down your spine.</p>

<p>The set is mostly a mix of tunes from his first two perfect records, <em>My Aim Is True</em> and <em>This Year&apos;s Girl</em>, including knockout versions of &quot;(I Don&apos;t Want To Go To) Chelsea,&quot; &quot;Lipstick Vogue&quot; and &quot;You Belong To Me.&quot; But the highlight is an early version of one of Costello&apos;s most shamefully overlooked early masterpieces, &quot;Two Little Hitlers,&quot; from the then-forthcoming <em>Armed Forces</em>. Although it has a few lyrical changes, the tune encapsulates Costello&apos;s vision for that album, which combined complex lyrics dealing with &quot;emotional fascism&quot; in both public and private lives with Abba-inspired, keyboard-drenched music: &quot;Two little Hitlers will fight it out until/One little Hitler does the other one&apos;s will.&quot;</p>
