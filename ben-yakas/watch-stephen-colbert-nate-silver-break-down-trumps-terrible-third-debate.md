<p>If you were anything like us, you were curled up in an anxiety ball with your fingers over your eyes <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161023025636/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/20/trump_clinton_last_debate.php#photo-1">watching all the highlights from last night&apos;s debate</a>, including Donald Trump arguing the finer points of puppetry, complaining about his Emmy snubs, and calling out &quot;bad hombres&quot; all over. </p>

<p>But if you had something better to do and/or care about your mental health and missed it, there&apos;s no one better at holding your hand as you walk through the inferno than <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161023025636/http://gothamist.com/tags/stephencolbert">Stephen Colbert</a>, who did a recap of the debate in his monologue last night (and paraded his own Emmys around). &quot;Democracy is going to end with a cliffhanger,&quot; is not something any of us want to hear.</p>

<p>Colbert also had as his guest &quot;election prophet extraordinaire&quot; Nate Silver, who picked apart just how much Trump&apos;s final debate performance was a disaster: &quot;It&#x2019;s as though she was ahead by 10 points in a football game, and Trump just threw a pick-six,&quot; Silver said. &quot;So, it&#x2019;s not looking too good for Donald J. Trump.&quot;</p>

<p>Colbert also tackled Trump&apos;s rigged elections claims by having registered dead voter Horace McNulty, played by Hugh Laurie, drop by to share his take on the election.</p>
