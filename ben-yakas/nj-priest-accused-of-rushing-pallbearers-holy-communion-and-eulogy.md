										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="31711priest.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20151221211135im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/31711priest.jpg" width="250" height="188" class="image-left"> </span>A NJ Priest has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151221211135/http://www.myfoxny.com/dpp/news/nj-priest-criticized-for-handling-of-funeral-20110315">been accused</a> of extreme rudeness by two of his congregants who claim that he interrupted and rushed them through their grandmother&apos;s funeral service. Sisters Laurie Treene and Robyn Nini say that Reverend Bartley P. Baker, of St. Leo&apos;s Roman Catholic Church in Elmwood Park, ruined their 96-year-old grandmother&apos;s funeral, cuing the proverbial awards show music at points: <strong>&quot;I got about halfway through [my eulogy] and he ran up to the podium and said, &apos;Wrap it up! Wrap it up!&apos; I was just flabbergasted,&quot;</strong> said Treene.</p>

<p>The sisters said that Baker also rushed an elderly relative while giving her the host during communion: &quot;She slowly opened her mouth and she bit on it so that she would not choke. He yelled, &apos;Lady, put it in your mouth. Lady, put it in your mouth,&apos;&quot; Treene said, avoiding any jokes at the elderly lady&apos;s expense. Then as the casket was being brought out, Treene said his twitchy ways really went too far: &quot;He walked down in front of the casket. Like an air traffic controller, he motioned the funeral pallbearers, &apos;Come on! Come on! Come on!&apos; Like, where was he going?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Heartless. He showed no compassion and was totally heartless,&quot; said Nini. A spokesman for the Robin Catholic Archdiocese of Newark said the issue was being looked into, but this may not be the first account of Father Baker&apos;s impatient and rude behavior. There is a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151221211135/http://www.thepetitionsite.com/556/petition-to-remove-the-present-pastor-from-stleos/">petition online</a> created by disgruntled members of the church, which complains that Baker has not integrated into the community: &quot;He refuses to return our calls unless we email him or have the secretary inform him; he has moods of hot/cold tempers, at the point of losing his temper in front of everyone.&quot; Currently, it has no signatures however.</p>

<p>On the one hand, Father Baker sounds impatient, moody, and pretty lousy at his job; on the other hand, at least this is a story about a Priest which has nothing to do with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151221211135/http://gothamist.com/2008/10/11/st_johns_priest_emailed_teen_dirty.php">accusations</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151221211135/http://gothamist.com/2010/12/19/high-ranking_ny_priest_defrocked_fo.php">convictions</a> of molestation. Glass half full people.</p>
