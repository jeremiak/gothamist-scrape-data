<p>A 14-year-old boy from Buffalo who recorded an &quot;It Gets Better&quot; video earlier this year <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160402120003/http://www.buffalonews.com/city/schools/article563538.ece">was found dead</a> of an apparent suicide. Jamey Rodemeyer had written extensively online about being bullied at school. &quot;I always say how bullied I am, but no one listens. What do I have to do so people will listen to me?&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160402120003/http://hausofjamey.tumblr.com/post/10005840360/i-always-say-how-bullied-i-am-but-no-one-listens-what">he wrote on his Tumblr</a> on September 9th. You can watch his tragic &quot;It Gets Better&quot; video below:</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160402120003/http://thedailywh.at/2011/09/20/rip-jamey-rodemeyer-at-14/">A year ago</a>, the online bullying of Jamey got particularly intense, and classmates started leaving anonymous homophobic messages on his Formspring account such as: &#x201C;JAMIE [sic] IS STUPID, GAY, FAT ANND UGLY. HE MUST DIE!&#x201D; Another read: &quot;I wouldn&apos;t care if you died. No one would. So just do it :) It would make everyone WAY more happier!&quot; Jamey made his contribution to Dan Savage&apos;s &quot;It Gets Better&quot; anti-bullying campaign in May, saying: &quot;People would just keep sending me hate, telling me that gay people go to hell. Just love yourself and you&apos;re set. And I promise you, it&apos;ll get better.&quot; His video has now been viewed over 100,000 times. </p>

<p>On Sunday, he published his last two entries on his Tumblr: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160402120003/http://hausofjamey.tumblr.com/post/10348199728/i-just-wanna-see-my-great-grandma-right-now">one was a message</a> saying he wanted to see his great grandmother, who had recently passed away. The other <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160402120003/http://hausofjamey.tumblr.com/post/10348560993/thank-you-lady-gaga">was a message to</a> his hero, Lady Gaga: &quot;Thank you Lady Gaga. For everything you have done for me. Paws up forever.&quot;</p>

<p>Jamey&apos;s parents said he was routinely harassed in school as well because of his sexuality, but he constantly denied anything was wrong to them. &quot;He used to cry about it, be sad and angry. But lately, he&apos;s been blowing them off, or at least we thought he was,&quot; said his mother Tracy Rodemeyer. She met with some of his friends at Williamsville North on Monday, and was amazed by the outpouring of grief: &quot;I didn&apos;t realize how many people he touched. He was the sweetest, kindest kid you&apos;d ever know. <strong>He would give all his heart to you before he gave any to himself.&quot;</strong></p>

<p>Today is the one-year-anniversary of the start of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160402120003/http://www.itgetsbetter.org/">&quot;It Gets Better&quot;</a> video project, which was started by Savage and his husband Terry Miller as a response to the suicides of teenagers who were bullied because of their perceived homosexuality. Tomorrow is the one-year-anniversary of the death of Rutgers student <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160402120003/http://gothamist.com/tags/tylerclementi">Tyler Clementi</a>, who committed suicide after he realized that his homosexual encounter had been broadcast via webcam allegedly by his roommate.</p>
