<p>Last Sunday night, Justin Daudi was traveling on the C train from the West 4th Street station just after 7 p.m. when he noticed a front panel on the car was swinging wide open. &quot;This would be the panel which usually is machine screwed closed and has some sort of advertisement banner on it,&quot; Daudi, a Web Application Developer living in Washington Heights, told us. You can see video of what he&apos;s talking about below.</p>

<p><iframe src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427164714if_/http://player.vimeo.com/video/64314203?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" width="640" height="480" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen></iframe> </p><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427164714/http://vimeo.com/64314203">C Train</a> from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427164714/http://vimeo.com/gothamist">Gothamist</a> on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427164714/http://vimeo.com/">Vimeo</a>.</p><p></p>

<p>Daudi was extremely worried about what that panel was for: &quot;I immediately noticed that behind this panel is a lever for separating the car from the rest of the train,&quot; he said. &quot;I was horrified and surprised that such a serious breach in security and safety could be allowed. And from the look on their faces I would say the rest of the passengers in the car were equally as bothered.&quot;</p>

<p>Despite Daudi&apos;s speculation about separating cars, the MTA tells us that the panel in question doesn&apos;t actually control that: &quot;The panel provides access to lubricate and provide maintenance to the sliding door,&quot; spokeswoman Deirdre Parker told us. We tried to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427164714/http://www.nycsubway.org/perl/caption.pl?/img/cars/sheet-r32.jpg">search blueprints</a> for any hint where this mysterious lever might be, but Parker said it was for naught: &quot;There is no &apos;lever&apos; to separate cars. He&#x2019;s been watching too many old movies. Our subway cars come in permanently attached units of four or five cars each.&quot;</p>

<p>Having said that, Parker added it was &quot;very unusual&quot; for such a panel to be open, because &quot;they are locked and can only be opened with a key.&quot;</p>

<p>So as for what straphangers should do if they see such a panel open, Parker has some simple advice: &quot;Alert the train crew. If they report it later, they should note the number of the subway car so that it can be located and corrected.&quot; And, ya know, resist the urge to fiddle with the instruments, lest you freak out your fellow riders and/or over lubricate the doors.</p>
