<p>During the GOP Presidential debate on Thursday night, some vocal Republicans <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110927131147/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/23/video_audience_boos_gay_soldier_at.php">could be heard booing</a> a gay active member of the military who asked a question about the now-defunct &quot;Don&apos;t Ask Don&apos;t Tell&quot; military policy. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110927131147/http://spreadingsantorum.com/">aptly-renamed</a> Rick Santorum was given a lot of flack for seemingly ignoring the boos as he gave his typically backwards response to the question. But yesterday, Santorum <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110927131147/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/2011/09/24/2011-09-24_rick_santorum_i_didnt_hear_booing_of_gay_soldier_questioning_dont_ask_dont_tell_.html">lamented the acoustics</a> of the debate venue, and claimed he hadn&apos;t heard the boos at the time: &quot;<strong>I condemn the people who booed that gay soldier,</strong>&quot; he told Fox News&apos; Megyn Kelly too-little-too-late. Watch his sorta mea culpa below.</p>

<p>Santorum went on to further clarify: </p>

<blockquote>I have to admit, I seriously did not hear those boos. Had I heard them, I certainly would have commented on them. But, as you know, when you&apos;re in that sort of environment, you&apos;re sort of focused on the question and formulating you answer, and I just didn&apos;t hear those couple of boos that were out there. But certainly had I, I would&apos;ve said, &quot;Don&apos;t do that. This man is serving our country and we are to thank him for his service.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>Kelly, who was the moderator of the debate, offered some further support to Santorum by saying she wasn&apos;t sure whether the heckling was aimed at the soldier, or aimed at the policy he was asking about...even though it&apos;s a moot point: whichever thing they were booing about, it was a nakedly dumb and ugly moment. </p>

<p>As the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110927131147/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/09/23/santorum-dadt-repeal-detrimental_n_977715.html">Huffington Post points out</a>, Santorum is increasingly alone in his stance, even among his other conservative colleagues, when it comes to bringing back DADT: &quot;Following the debate, no other candidate or campaign offered support for a reinstitution of the law.&quot; Former New Mexico governor Gary Johnson <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110927131147/http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/post/gop-debate-soldier-booed-unconscionable-silence-follows/2011/03/04/gIQAhee0qK_blog.html">echoed that sentiment</a>, saying he regretted not calling out those hecklers at the time: &quot;The booing that occurred last night at the event is not the Republican Party that I belong to.&quot; </p>
