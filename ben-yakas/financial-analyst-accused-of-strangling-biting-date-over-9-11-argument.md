<p>A Bushwick man has been accused of assaulting a first date after the two got into a heated argument about 9/11. Financial analyst Andrew Francis, 36, allegedly strangled Paul Gallagher and bit his finger over the subject of September 11th: &quot;The defendant stated that he hated Americans and said he wanted to kill Americans and believed Americans got what they deserved on 9/11,&quot; said Assistant District Attorney Wilfredo Cotto, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426134241/http://nypost.com/2014/05/30/ex-banker-choked-date-after-911-argument/&quot;&gt;according to the Post.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two men met on a dating service and met up at Francis&#x2019; Bushwick apartment; they were watching the movie &lt;em&gt;Troy&lt;/em&gt; (John Liu" s="" <a="">favorite movie</a>!) when they started talking about politics. According to the criminal complaint, Francis hit Gallagher over the head with an &quot;unknown object,&quot; put his hands around Gallagher&apos;s neck and squeezed, and then wrestled him onto the ground. Gallagher claims he suffered swelling and lacerations to the forehead, a sore throat, bite marks to his finger, substantial pain, fear of further injury, and annoyance.</p>

<p>&quot;It was one date that is clearly not going to happen again,&#x201D; said Francis&apos; lawyer, defense attorney Cary London, in court. &quot;This is an online date gone bad and it&#x2019;s why you shouldn&#x2019;t talk politics in the bedroom.&quot; (Or maybe the lesson is more about why you shouldn&apos;t act like a violent psychopath?) Francis, who currently works at Columbia University and previously worked at Citigroup, Microsoft and American Express, has been hit with charges including assault, strangulation, menacing, and harassment. </p>
