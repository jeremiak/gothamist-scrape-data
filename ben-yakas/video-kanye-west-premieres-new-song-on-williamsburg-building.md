<p>But this isn&apos;t just a Brooklyn thing: 66 different buildings in 10 cities around the globe (New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Miami, Chicago, Toronto, Paris, London, Berlin, and Sydney) will be blessed with the new video/projection/giant Kanye head. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428142953/http://www.kanyewest.com/">Go to West&apos;s website</a> to see a map of the locations and find out when they&apos;ll be projected there.
