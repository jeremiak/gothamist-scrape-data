Roberto Sanchez used by internet troll to woo women</i></div> <p></p>

<p>We already knew not to trust <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140411040455/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/13/nobody_can_resist_the_romeo_grifter.php">anyone we meet</a> on the internet, but alleged New Yorker &quot;Dylan Sorvino&quot; might take the cake for biggest douchebag on the web: Sorvino <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140411040455/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/national/facebook_seducer_faux_gi_joe_jCgsYyHygvygXOIyFQF7QO">is accused of</a> using pictures of a dead war hero to seduce the women he met online. He used photos of Sgt. Roberto Sanchez, a 24-year- old US Army Ranger killed in combat in Afghanistan in 2009 after five tours of duty, for his Facebook profile, while pretending to be in the Army. Sanchez&apos;s family was alerted to the scam this week. &quot;This guy went on the Ranger battalion Web site looking for a fallen soldier to use. My son died for this country. How can anyone do that? It&apos;s so heartless,&quot; said Sanchez&apos;s mother, Wendy Holland.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140411040455/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/national/facebook_seducer_faux_gi_joe_jCgsYyHygvygXOIyFQF7QO">According to</a> some of his online paramours, Sorvino would play poker through Facebook and invite female players to be his &quot;friends;&quot; he then would begin his seduction routine, emailing sweet nothings to the women for months while pretending to be overseas in a war zone. He also allegedly used Sanchez&apos;s photos for profiles he posted on Myspace under the name Kyle Anderson, and on Bebo.com under the username &quot;Slyfoxrngrd.&quot; Sorvino quickly deleted the Facebook and other profiles after he was confronted online by some of Sanchez&apos;s friends. Since there were no financial loses from the fraud, the FBI said it was unlikely to launch an investigation into the scam. At least it seems that Sorvino never actually met any of the women, who vary in age from 30-50, in real life; considering what an internet troll he was, we can&apos;t imagine just how trollish he looks in reality.</p>
