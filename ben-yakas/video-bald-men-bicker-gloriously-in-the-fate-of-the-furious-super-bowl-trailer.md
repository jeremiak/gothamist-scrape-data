<p>We&apos;re only two months away from the release of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170630223021/http://gothamist.com/2016/12/12/the_fate_of_the_furious_trailer_arg.php"><em>The Fate Of The Furious</em></a>, a.k.a. <em>Fast &amp; Furious 8</em>, a.k.a. <em>Fast 8</em>, a.k.a. <em>Furious 8</em>, a.k.a. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170630223021/http://gothamist.com/2015/03/26/fast_furious_hot_take.php"><em>Family: The Movie Of The Life</em></a>. And if you thought the Super Bowl would go by without us getting a new glimpse at our favorite globe-trotting, prison-breaking, car-gasming heroes, then maybe you are wearing a tight t-shirt that is cutting off circulation to your brain (and you should consider getting another size).</p>

<p>Watch below as we get a few more glimpses of the big New York setpiece showdown (we are legally required to mention that these NYC scenes <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170630223021/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/13/an_outrage.php">were at least partially filmed in Cleveland</a>), more of the submarine car chase, and of course, lots of bald men arguing with each other (presumably over whose baldness is superior).</p>

<p>Here&apos;s the official synopsis for the eighth chapter of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170630223021/http://gothamist.com/tags/thefastandthefurious">the Furious saga</a>, which touches on the fact the movie was filmed in Cuba, Iceland and New York/Cleveland:</p>

<blockquote>Now that Dom and Letty are on their honeymoon and Brian and Mia have retired from the game&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;and the rest of the crew has been exonerated&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;the globetrotting team has found a semblance of a normal life. But when a mysterious woman seduces Dom into the world of crime he can&#x2019;t seem to escape and a betrayal of those closest to him, they will face trials that will test them as never before.

<p>From the shores of Cuba and the streets of New York City to the icy plains off the arctic Barents Sea, our elite force will crisscross the globe to stop an anarchist from unleashing chaos on the world&#x2019;s stage&#x2026;and to bring home the man who made them a family.</p></blockquote><p></p>
