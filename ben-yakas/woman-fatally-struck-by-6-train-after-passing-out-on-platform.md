										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right" style=" width:300px; "> <img alt="2011_05_lexline.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424005448im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2011_05_lexline.jpg" width="300" height="186"> <br> <i>Via WABC 7</i></div> Police say that a woman was fatally hit by a No. 6 train after she passed out and fell onto the tracks at the 77th Street stop on the Upper East Side this afternoon. It&apos;s suspected she was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424005448/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local/new_york&amp;id=8165020">overcome by the heat</a>. &quot;A woman was cut in half,&quot; one subway rider, who was treated for shock at Lennox Hill Hospital after witnessing the crash, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424005448/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/rider_struck_and_injured_by_no_train_s5rqcK1M8vhWJOBHgwziQP">told the Post</a>.<p></p>

<p>The young woman fainted on the Lexington Avenue line&apos;s platform around 3 p.m. After falling on the tracks, she was struck by a northbound No. 6 train which was just arriving. Local service was shut down for a couple hours after the accident, and all trains were running express between Grand Central and 125th Street. </p>

<p>One commenter who claimed they were on the train at the time of the accident wrote this account <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424005448/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2011/06/01/2011-06-01_woman_struck_by_no_6_subway_train_after_passing_out_and_falling_on_tracks_on_77t.html">on the News&apos; website</a>: &quot;I was on the #6 when it happened and sat at 103rd for 20 minutes; finally, the train proceeded to 86th Street and couldn&apos;t go no further. I stood on the platform, for at least a half hour, and informed my fellow strap hangers that there was no service. One would think that the MTA would have provided one person to direct everyone to the express trains that were still running. But all people got was a garbled message and some notice rolling across those new train arrival signs in neon red.&quot;</p>
