<p>A landlord has been accused of drugging and raping at least four women at an Upper West Side apartment.</p>

<p>Eliseo Adorno, 67, was arrested in July and arraigned on criminal sex act, rape, sex abuse and unlawful surveillance charges. Prosecutors said that officials uncovered 350 sexually explicit photos and 45 videos taken between October 2014 and March 2015 at Adorno&apos;s $8,500/month apartment at the Langham at 135 Central Park West near Central Park.</p>

<p>&quot;Each image and video depicts an asleep or unconscious woman photographed in the most intrusive way imaginable,&quot; Manhattan prosecutor Melanie Soberal said, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021112539/http://nypost.com/2016/09/14/landlord-used-central-park-west-pad-as-personal-rape-den-lawyers/">according to the Post.</a> &quot;They have absolutely no recollection of any of the conduct depicted in the images or videos,&quot; Soberal said. She added that the victims were so drugged, that in &quot;some videos, snoring can be heard in the background.&quot;</p>

<p>The crime was apparently uncovered after one victim found photos of herself on Adorno&apos;s phone. </p>

<p>&quot;What he has done to these victims, in taking these pictures not just of himself engaging in sexual acts with the victims but of the victims&apos; bodies in the most intrusive, outrageous, unthinkable angles and views, they couldn&apos;t be more violated,&quot; Soberal said.</p>

<p>Prosecutors urged the judge to hold the suspect without bail, because Adorno has multiple properties upstate and in the city. </p>

<p>Adorno&apos;s defense lawyer Kimberly Summers, who previously defended <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021112539/http://gothamist.com/tags/seanshaynak">the Brooklyn high school teacher</a> who was found guilty of engaging in sexual misconduct with multiple underage students, told us, &quot;[W]hile the DA&apos;s office alleged during arraignment that there were multiple women, the defendant has only been charged with assaulting 2 complainants.&quot;</p>
