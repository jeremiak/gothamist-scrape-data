<p>Police are trying to track down a bag thief who was caught on camera in West Village bar. The suspect, who you can see in the photos above, stole a woman&apos;s purse at Fat Cat Club on Christopher Street around 9 p.m. on October 12th. It goes without saying that the term &quot;hipster&quot; has dissolved into utter meaninglessness at this point, but c&apos;mon, there&apos;s no mistaking those chunky eyeglass frames&#x2014;nor the outsized gesticulations captured so vividly on the left. We&apos;d know that &quot;Oh please, Slanted &amp; Enchanted is OBVIOUSLY better than Brighten the Corners!&quot; declarative arm gesture anywhere. <br>
 <br>
We&apos;re just wildly speculating here, but this suspect may have taken the purse (which contained credit cards and a cell phone) to help feed his ravenous addiction to artisanal mayo, so approach with caution. Anyone with information in regards to this incident is asked to call the NYPD&apos;s Crime Stoppers Hotline at 800-577-TIPS. The public can also submit their tips by logging onto <a href="WWW.NYPDCRIMESTOPPERS.COM">the Crime Stoppers Website.</a> </p>

<p>Phone and fancy gadget thefts <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141022205825/http://gothamist.com/tags/icrime">have skyrocketed</a> in the last few years (there&apos;s a damn good reason why <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141022205825/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/22/of_course_the_nypd_has_an_apple_cri.php">there&apos;s a dedicated iCrime theft squad</a>), and police have warned nightgoers in the Village that there have been a rash of thieves snatching phones from clubbers&apos; and barflies&apos; bags. Of course, if you <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141022205825/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/22/pro-tip_dont_leave_your_4800_purse.php">leave your bag unintended anywhere</a> in NYC, you&apos;re asking for trouble.</p>
