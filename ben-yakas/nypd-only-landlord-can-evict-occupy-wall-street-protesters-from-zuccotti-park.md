<p>As <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140823204138/http://gothamist.com/tags/occupywallstreet">Occupy Wall Street</a> stretches into its third week at Zuccotti Park, it seems the fate of the protest in its current incarnation rests in the hands of the park&apos;s landlord&#x2014;not the NYPD. According <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140823204138/http://www.dnainfo.com/20111006/downtown/only-park-owner-can-kick-out-occupy-wall-street-protesters-nypd-says">to DNAInfo</a>, an NYPD detective said that the executives of Brookfield Properties, who manage the park, are the only ones who can kick out protesters. </p>

<p>Det. Rick Lee, a community affairs officer at lower Manhattan&apos;s 1st Precinct, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140823204138/http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/culture/2011/10/3640197/end-game-zuccotti-park-according-nypd-landlord-has-push-political-bu">explained the situation to</a> locals at Community Board 1&apos;s Financial District Committee meeting last night. &quot;A representative for Brookfield would go into the park and say, &apos;You&apos;re in violation of the rules of the park. You have to leave.&apos; If they don&apos;t leave, they&apos;re trespassing. Then the police would get involved.&quot; So it&apos;s Brookfield&apos;s move to make: &quot;That&#x2019;s the scenario. Politically, when that button is going to be pushed is beyond my pay grade...I couldn&apos;t tell you.&quot;</p>

<p>Last week, Brookfield officials <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140823204138/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/04/tomorrows_occupy_wall_street_march.php">released a statement</a> saying that the park management recognizes people&apos;s right to peaceful protest, but they &quot;also have an obligation to ensure that the park remains safe, clean, and accessible to everyone.&quot; It also notes that the park hasn&apos;t been cleaned since September 16, one day before the protests began, and that &quot;sanitary conditions have reached unacceptable levels.&quot; OWS spokesman Patrick Bruner told us the group was trying to address many of those problems before things got any worse.</p>

<p>But the larger point is that despite <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140823204138/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/30/bloomberg_implies_wall_street_prote.php">his ominous intonations</a>, Bloomberg can&apos;t personally remove protesters from the streets of the park. And even if Brookfield doesn&apos;t kick them out, protesters have another major problem on the immediate horizon: the weather. Many protesters and OWS organizers are scrambling to find a solution to cold weather conditions, and thus far have only found that they can&apos;t afford the proper gear to keep people warm.</p>
