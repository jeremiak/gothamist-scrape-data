										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none" style=" width:640px; "> <img alt="62810ltrain.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429172454im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/62810ltrain.jpg" width="640" height="428"> <br> <i>Idle Type&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429172454/http://www.flickr.com/photos/idletype/2661400669/">Flickr</a></i></div> <p></p>

<p>The scientists over at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429172454/http://newyork.craigslist.org/mis/">Craigslist</a> have been crunching the numbers and have come up with a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429172454/http://www.scribd.com/doc/33665192/Subway-Missed-Connections">foolproof analysis</a> of the most romantic subway lines and stations in NYC. And the L train was named the best subway line to find romantic <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429172454/http://gothamist.com/2010/06/09/shooting_on_l_train_platform_at_uni.php">fireworks</a>.</p>

<p>Craigslist looked at over 500 ads posted over the period of a recent month by Subway-users in the &#x201C;Missed Connections&#x201D; section of Craigslist New York; the number of Missed Connections ads mentioning a particular station was then divided by the annual ridership at that stop to determine the romantic formula. The Morgan Avenue stop was named the most romantic station, while the Lexington Avenue/59th Street Station was named the least romantic station. </p>

<p>As City Room <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429172454/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/06/28/the-love-train-goes-to-williamsburg/">points out</a>, the most interesting aspect of the, ahem, <em>study</em>, is how romance is defined as <strong>&#x201C;the best odds of a fellow passenger falling for you across a crowded car or platform, and then posting a &#x2018;Missed Connections&#x2019; ad on Craigslist in search of you.&#x201D;</strong> Which is great, because nothing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429172454/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/25/another_craigslist_killing_li_woman.php">bad</a> has ever come by responding to messages on Craigslist. </p>
