But he did admit to defrauding his own charity.<p></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150718202822/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/06/nyregion/nechemya-weberman-testifies-in-his-own-defense-in-sex-abuse-trial.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;_r=0">Weberman admitted on the stand</a> to using money from his nonprofit organization, B&#x2019;lev V&#x2019;Nefesh, to pay for his own child&#x2019;s tuition at the United Talmudical Academy in Williamsburg, the same school <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150718202822/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/05/hasidic_principal_on_alleged_sex_ab.php">which insisted to the victim&apos;s parents</a> that the teen meet with Weberman for counseling or else leave the school. &#x201C;So you&#x2019;re getting a salary and paying your children&#x2019;s tuition?&#x201D; asked Assistant District Attorney Kevin O&#x2019;Donnell. &#x201C;I did if I needed to,&#x201D; Weberman replied. Weberman, who called himself a &quot;rabbinical counselor&quot; despite no training, said the non-profit was used to raise money for those who can&#x2019;t afford his services. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150718202822/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/perv_case_hasid_blow_defense_eUouBMCi7Uvupy4WB137BI">But prosecutors brought up</a> the fact that financial records show that the charity&#x2019;s credit cards were used at BMG Corset &amp; Lingerie, The Lingerie Shop and other undergarment stores. &#x201C;Me, myself, I&#x2019;m not aware of this,&#x201D; Weberman claimed. &#x201C;This is the first time I heard about it.&#x201D; Weberman also described his first meeting with the teen: &#x201C;She said, &#x2018;Why should I trust you? Why should I talk to you? You look like a Hasidic f--k. You look like my father,&#x2019; &#x201D; Weberman testified.</p>

<p>Weberman actually went out of his way to besmirch the teen, saying at one point, &#x201C;There are people who are better than her, right.&quot; As for why he felt that way, he said the alleged victim was &#x201C;fresh&#x2019;&#x2019; and &#x201C;immodest&#x2019;&#x2019; unlike other girls: &#x201C;That&#x2019;s why these were girls who were better than her.&#x2019;&#x2019; </p>

<p>Besides Weberman, who has 10 children and 18 grandchildren, there was also testimony from Baila Gluck, a runaway who lived in Weberman&#x2019;s office for two years. She said that two other girls stayed at the home around the same time; one of them told authorities she caught Weberman and Gluck in a compromising position, a charge she denied. &#x201C;Do you recall an occasion when [another girl] walked into the room and you were sitting on his lap and the defendant had an erection?&#x201D; O&#x2019;Donnell asked. &#x201C;No. That never happened,&#x201D; Gluck answered.</p>

<p>Weberman was the defense&apos;s last witness; today both sides got the chance to sum up their arguments. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150718202822/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/molloy-weberman-courtroom-resembles-nightclub-article-1.1214343">The Daily News wrote that</a> the courtroom had started to resemble nightclub with all the people trying to get in and watch. One of those nightclubbers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150718202822/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/arrogant_satmar_abused_his_vast_e0sCYVgCQh7A2rwxPRsTCO?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Local">was Andrea Peyser</a>, who gave her typically reasonable two cents about the &quot;slimy bastard&quot; Weberman: &quot;The accuser, who turned 18 yesterday, had the grave misfortune of loving and revering this human piece of filth...I&#x2019;m ashamed to be of the same faith as this evil, malicious creep.&quot;</p>
