<p>Yesterday, 21-year-old Aidan Folan <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130510161640/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/03/21-year-old_arrested_for_brutal_f_t.php">was arrested in connection</a> with the vicious attack against a woman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130510161640/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/03/video_woman_brutally_beaten_at_f_tr.php">at an F train station in Borough Park</a> last month. Folan, who was charged with robbery and assault in the second degree in the incident, was recognized thanks to the black hoodie he was wearing, which had &quot;Alpha Phi Delta&quot; on the front and &quot;Stugotz&quot; and the number 27 on the back. It turns out that one of Folan&apos;s frat brothers ratted him out to cops after seeing the surveillance video of the attack: &quot;Being human beings, we felt compelled to do that,&quot; the fraternity member <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130510161640/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/frat_house_animal_yj3e9uaeiZnZpw5XmqDsqL">told the Post</a>. &quot;I think any human being would feel compelled. We were just appalled.&quot;</p>

<p>The frat member, who didn&apos;t give his name, called Folan &quot;a member in bad standing&quot; who received the hoodie during the one year he spent at St. Francis College in Brooklyn Heights. Folan, who was arrested on January 12, 2013 for &quot;unlawful possession of Marihuana,&quot; studied Broadcast Journalism at St. Francis, <strike>and works as a counselor at the Center for Family Life in Sunset Park</strike>. (<em>According to the Center for Family Life, Folan was a summer intern there through the City&apos;s Summer Youth Employment Program for six weeks only last summer and &quot;has NO current involvement with that program.&quot;</em>) The frat brother called Crime Stoppers and gave them all the info they had on Folan, including his Bay Ridge address. </p>

<p>On Saturday, March 9, 2013, around 2:40 a.m., 55-year-old Dina Perez exited the southbound F at the 18th Avenue subway station and was assaulted by a man. Perez said that the suspect didn&apos;t speak once during the attack, during which she was beaten and kicked by the suspect. </p>

<p>The frat has received hundreds of angry emails in the last few days, and Folan&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130510161640/http://www.facebook.com/Stugotz27">Facebook has been bombarded</a> with similar messages&#x2014;and he&apos;s gotten the meme-treatment.</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="4413stugo.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130510161640im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/4413stugo.jpeg" width="640" height="544"> <br> <i> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130510161640/http://imgur.com/mXUk2uA">via</a></i></div>  <p></p>

<p>The member who called in the tip on Folan sounds embarrassed and disgusted with his alleged attack. &#x201C;Our thoughts, prayers and sympathy go out to Ms. Perez as she recovers from this ghastly act,&#x201D; said the fraternity member who called cops. &#x201C;The alleged actions that Mr. Folan is being charged with are heinous and completely repugnant to the membership and tradition of Alpha Phi Delta fraternity. The video shows brutal and cowardly actions against Ms. Perez.&#x201D;</p>

<p>&#x201C;If he&#x2019;s found guilty, we will immediately expel him &#x2014; not that it&#x2019;ll mean anything to someone who did that,&#x201D; the frat member said, adding that they hope Folan gets the strictest punishment if found guilty. &#x201C;We are embarrassed that he was a part of our brotherhood.&#x201D;</p>
