                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="10913outkast.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20140212104456im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/10913outkast.jpeg" width="640" height="500" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>(So) fresh (and so clean) off the announcement that they will be one of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140212104456/http://laist.com/2014/01/08/coachella_2014_lineup_announced_wit.php">headliners of Coachella 2014</a>, it was confirmed today that OutKast will also be the main headliner for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140212104456/http://gothamist.com/tags/governorsball">Governors Ball 2014</a>. So you can probably save some airfare if you are getting super excited about seeing OutKast&#x2014;unless you&apos;re a Muse fanboy, of course.</p>

The rest of the lineup hasn&apos;t been announced yet, but the fest will give out some hints on its <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140212104456/https://www.facebook.com/GovBall">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140212104456/https://twitter.com/GovBallNYC">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140212104456/http://instagram.com/govballnyc">Instagram</a> accounts in the next couple days. So far, it seems <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140212104456/https://twitter.com/GovBallNYC/status/421344445238628353">Phoenix will be playing</a> and maybe the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140212104456/https://twitter.com/GovBallNYC/status/421135818645061632">hologram ghosts of Tupac and Biggie.</a> Let&apos;s just hope it&apos;s a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140212104456/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/08/photos_insane_mud_at_governors_ball.php">tad bit less muddy this year.</a></p>

<p>As for OutKast, they may be hitting the summer festival circuit hard in 2014, but don&apos;t expect much more than that for now: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140212104456/http://consequenceofsound.net/2013/11/its-official-outkast-are-reuniting/">according to Revolt TV</a>, the reunion is &#x201C;currently set to exist solely in the live setting, with no new album plans in sight, for now.&#x201D; We&apos;ll take what we can get, and we&apos;ll wish them well and to go to Yale.</p>
