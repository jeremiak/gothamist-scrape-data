<p>All those hours of clicking through <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160227231904/http://offbeathome.com/2012/10/giraffe-manor">Giraffe Manor vacations</a> and Paul Ryan&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160227231904/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/11/early_addition_1137.php">pumping iron photo spreads</a> may have led you to forget about the existence of print magazines&#x2014;in which case, you may have missed the big <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160227231904/http://gothamist.com/tags/arresteddevelopment"><em>Arrested Development</em></a> cover story on this week&apos;s Entertainment Weekly. There are some particularly good tidbits in the article from creator Mitch Hurwitz: &quot;They&apos;ve destroyed the environment, the environment has destroyed them...There are a lot of ostriches. I would describe this season of <em>Arrested</em> as being bird-heavy.&quot; That sounds awful <strike>fishy</strike> chickeny to us.</p>

<p>&quot;We&apos;re trying not to do greatest hits. I&apos;m trying to resist just giving the fans what they know. That will be fun in the short term, but I don&apos;t think it&apos;ll be nourishing,&quot; Hurwitz added. As for where the Bluths are when we pick up, &quot;Things have gone very badly for them in every way&#x2014;sexually, biochemically.&quot; Will Arnett expanded upon that: &quot;Left to their own devices, these people always become the very worst versions of themselves. And they were left to their own devices once again, and they didn&apos;t disappoint. So you&apos;re going to find them in the most magnified states of disrepair. They made increasingly bad choices, and it&apos;s a snowball effect.&quot;</p>
