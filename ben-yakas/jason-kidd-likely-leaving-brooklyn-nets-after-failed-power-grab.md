<p>Soon-to-be-former Brooklyn Nets Coach <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506172249/http://gothamist.com/tags/jasonkidd">Jason Kidd</a> isn&apos;t just transparently clumsy <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506172249/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/29/jason_kidd_fined_50000_for_spilled.php">with his sodas</a>&#x2014;he&apos;s also transparently clumsy with his attempts at power grabs. According <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506172249/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/30/sports/basketball/jason-kidd-nets-bucks.html?_r=1&amp;smid%3D=tw-nytsports">to the Times</a>, Kidd recently approached Nets&#x2019; ownership with a request to head the team&#x2019;s basketball operations, a position that would put him above general manager Billy King. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506172249/http://gothamist.com/tags/nets">The Nets</a>, unsurprisingly, told the second-year coach, &apos;Thanks, but no thanks&apos;&#x2014;and now it looks like he&apos;s headed to the Milwaukee Bucks.</p>

<p>In addition to wanting more power than King (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506172249/http://nypost.com/2014/06/28/denied-promotion-jason-kidd-gets-ok-to-talk-with-bucks/">the only people in the league</a> both coaching a team and overseeing basketball operations are San Antonio&#x2019;s Gregg Popovich, Detroit&#x2019;s Stan Van Gundy, Minnesota&#x2019;s Flip Saunders and the Clippers&#x2019; Doc Rivers), many believe that Kidd was jealous of some other coaching deals this offseason, particularly new Knicks coach Derek Fisher and almost Knicks coach Steve Kerr, who both received five-year, $25 million deals. Kidd led the Nets to a 44-38 record, sixth in the Eastern Conference, in his first season as coach; they ultimately lost to the Miami Heat in the Conference Semifinals.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506172249/http://sports.yahoo.com/news/jason-kidd-in-talks-to-run-bucks--basketball-operations-after-failed-power-play-with-nets-072327526.html">According to Yahoo Sports&apos; Adrian Wojnarowski</a>, &quot;the possibility of Kidd being afforded this kind of power and responsibility is being met with downright mockery among NBA owners and executives.&quot; He writes:</p>

<blockquote>Kidd&apos;s thirst for more power and money began to escalate with Golden State&apos;s and New York&apos;s hirings of Steve Kerr and Derek Fisher, respectively, as coaches, league sources said. Kidd was livid they were paid contracts substantially higher than what the Nets paid Kidd as a rookie coach.

<p>&quot;That got him - especially Fisher,&quot; one official told Yahoo Sports.</p>

<p>Kidd was hired for three years, $10.5 million, only to be livid over Kerr and Fisher getting four-year deals guaranteeing more than $4 million dollars per season. Lost on Kidd was this: His dicey history made him unappealing as a coach, except with the Nets.</p>

<p>Despite Kidd&apos;s greatness as a Hall of Fame point guard, he had a long career of clashing with front-office executives and coaches, a domestic abuse charge and a DWI guilty plea that left him suspended for his first two games as an NBA head coach. Kidd had little leverage upon his hiring as coach, which is why the Nets refused to overpay him market value.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>The Nets may be done with Kidd and his soda-spilling antics, but the Bucks apparently are sweet on him, and may be willing to give him full control of basketball operations as he wants. &quot;Kidd has had a personal and financial partnership with [Bucks co-owner Marc] Lasry, and now he&apos;s leveraging that relationship into talks to run the Bucks franchise, sources said,&quot; Wojnarowski adds. Note: Kidd still has three years left on his $10.5 million deal with Brooklyn, and the Bucks have both coach Larry Drew and general manager John Hammond already under contract.</p>

<p>As for who might replace Kidd with the Nets, two names already being bandied about are former Golden State Warriors coach Mark Jackson and former Memphis Grizzlies coach Lionel Hollins. </p>
