<p>Two people were killed and a third was injured in separate train incidents on Tuesday and Wednesday. The MTA says the most recent incident happened just before 2 p.m. today, when a man jumped in front of a southbound M train at the 34th Street station near 6th Avenue. The FDNY tells us the man was DOA at the scene.</p>

<p>Yesterday around 2 p.m., a man was boarding a northbound 5 train at Bowling Green in Manhattan when he slipped. His foot got stuck in the gap between the platform and the train. The MTA says the train was taken out of service, and the conductor stayed with the man until EMS arrived; he was taken to a local hospital in unknown condition.</p>

<p>And also Tuesday morning, a man believed to be in his 50s was fatally struck by a southbound 6 train at the Hunts Point Avenue station in The Bronx. NYPD add it&apos;s unclear whether that man fell onto the tracks or had already been down there.<br>
