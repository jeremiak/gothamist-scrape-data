<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170426051918/http://gothamist.com/tags/sethmeyers">Seth Meyers&apos;s</a> latest segment of &quot;A Closer Look&quot; was filmed on Monday afternoon, well before news broke that national security adviser General Michael Flynn had resigned due to multiple potentially-illegal phone calls he had with Russia&apos;s Ambassador before Trump was president. But in the midst of recapping Trump&apos;s weekend, Meyers waded right into Flynngate as part of the &quot;crisis within [Trump&apos;s] own government&quot; with aplomb: &quot;He talked to the Russian ambassador five times, but couldn&apos;t be certain if they talked about Russian sanctions?&quot; Meyers asked. &quot;That&apos;s like me saying I talked to Serena Williams on the phone five times but I can&apos;t say for sure whether or not anyone mentioned tennis.&quot;</p>

<p>Referring to Vice President Pence&apos;s defense of Flynn from January, Meyers added: &quot;Either Flynn straight-up lied to Mike Pence or Mike Pence lied to us. But of course, to Mike Pence, a lie is just a truth that hasn&#x2019;t gone through conversion therapy yet.&quot;</p>

<p>Watch below as Meyers also covers Trump&apos;s absurdly public visit to Mar-A-Largo with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, and his continued and persistent lies about voter fraud. Come for the New Hampshire jokes, stay for the roasting of Stephen Miller: &quot;In case you&apos;re wondering what being sinister does to you, that guy is 31-years-old and he already looks like he&apos;s two-thirds of the way to Montgomery Burns.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170426051918/http://gothamist.com/tags/stephencolbert">Stephen Colbert</a> also picked up on both the Mar-A-Largo and Stephen Miller (aka &quot;The Young Gargamel&quot;) threads, with Colbert lacing into Miller (&quot;What the fuck are you talking about?&quot;). After showing a clip of Miller vowing to go on any show and repeat his lies about voter fraud, Colbert formally invited him onto his show: &quot;And guess what? You&apos;ve already confirmed that you&apos;ll be here tomorrow. Need evidence? Ask anyone in the state of New Hampshire. And listen: if you don&apos;t show up, I&apos;m going to call you a liar. And if you do show up, I&apos;m going to call you a liar to your face.&quot;</p>

<p>Following up on his vow, Colbert also spliced Miller into lots of other TV shows, including <em>The Walking Dead</em> and <em>Game Of Thrones</em>.</p>
