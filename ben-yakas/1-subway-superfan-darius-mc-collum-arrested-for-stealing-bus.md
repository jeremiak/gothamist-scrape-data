McCollum, 45, was spotted driving the coach northbound on a ramp of the Van Wyck Expressway at 8:50 a.m. and was arrested without incident, police <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151116024922/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/subway_car_stealer_busted_for_stealing_cz8BCyoV04Ai8fdnMfyF5L">said</a>. Interestingly, according to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151116024922/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/08/31/a-stolen-bus-leads-to-an-all-too-familiar-suspect/">Times</a>, he stole a Trailways bus from NJ instead of one from NYC Transit. He was charged with grand larceny and criminal possession of stolen property. </p>

<p>This was McCollum&apos;s 27th arrest; his last one came in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151116024922/http://gothamist.com/2008/10/07/1_subway_fan_darius_mccollum_arrest.php">October 2008</a>, for impersonating a federal employee. McCollum is diagnosed with Asperger&apos;s Syndrome, and has spent more than a third of his life in jail for victimless transit-related offenses. His most famous theft was taking an E train six stops to World Trade Center when he was 15.  </p>

<p>Recently, the MTA warned employees that McCollum was spotted near bus depots in the Bronx.  NYC Transit spokesman Paul Fleuranges <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151116024922/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/subway_car_stealer_busted_for_stealing_cz8BCyoV04Ai8fdnMfyF5L">said</a>, &quot;This posture has been instrumental in raising awareness among our employees and has helped prevent him from gaining access to our facilities and equipment. We applaud the NYPD&apos;s recent arrest, and hope he is punished to the fullest extent of the law and kept far away from anything with wheels.&quot;</p>
