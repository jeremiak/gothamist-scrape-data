<p>The asteroid didn&apos;t wipe us all out, we&apos;re pretty sure it&apos;s warm-ish outside, all we want to do is go home and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130326204807/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/15/cancel_your_plans_hulu_has_entire_c.php">stream the Criterion Collection</a>&#x2014;and yet, it&apos;s still Friday afternoon last we checked. Not even all the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130326204807/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/15/the_35_most_important_fashion_week.php">sideboobs and fur boobs</a> in the world could change that fact. But thankfully, the folks over at Sports Illustrated have been hard at work providing <strike>all the hard-hitting sports coverage you&apos;ve come to expect</strike> lots of swimsuit-related content. Today&apos;s tidbit: swimsuit models doing the dread &quot;Harlem Shake.&quot; It&apos;s not much, but it will get you 30 seconds closer to the weekend.</p>

<p>In case you missed the news and/or don&apos;t care about America, our girlfriend <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130326204807/http://gothamist.com/tags/kateupton">Kate Upton</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130326204807/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/12/video_kate_uptons_2nd_sports_illust.php#photo-1">was revealed to be</a> the 2013 Sports Illustrated Swimsuit issue cover model this week, making her the first back-to-back beauty since Tyra Banks. We already celebrated <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130326204807/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/09/celebrate_kate_uptons_2nd_swimsuit.php">by sampling of some of her finest work captured on video</a>&#x2014;but SI also posted a behind-the-scenes video of Upton reflecting on the achievement. And it turns out she <em>literally</em> risked body and health for all of us. So it&apos;s your national duty to watch the video below, lo that her sacrifices be not in vain&#x2014;and hey, you&apos;ll be 1:40 closer to drinking your way through the East Village or wherever tonight.</p>
