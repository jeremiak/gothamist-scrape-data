<p>The 13th annual <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150103083729/http://gothamist.com/tags/nopantssubwayride">No Pants Subway Ride</a> is set to kick off (all the pants) at 3 p.m. this afternoon. Which means today is a very good day for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150103083729/http://www.tumblr.com/tagged/i-hate-pants">anti-pants activists</a>, as well as people who are into acquiring communicable diseases from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150103083729/http://gothamist.com/tags/subwayetiquette">germ-ridden cesspools.</a> [<strong>UPDATE:</strong> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150103083729/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/13/photos_no_pants_subway_ride.php">Here is our photo gallery</a> of yesterday&apos;s spectacle.]</p>
