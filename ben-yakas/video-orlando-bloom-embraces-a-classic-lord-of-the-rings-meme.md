<p>Do you remember <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422220054/http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/theyre-taking-the-hobbits-to-isengard">&quot;They&apos;re Taking The Hobbits To Isengard&quot;</a>? It was one of those unstoppable internet memes from the wild west days of 2005, a jolly loop of actor Orlando Bloom repeating the titular phrase as hobbits danced and Aragorn gazed blankly, looking a bit constipated. Bloom, who has been in New Zealand shooting scenes for the last two new <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422220054/http://gothamist.com/tags/thehobbit"><em>The Hobbit</em> films</a>, finished filming yesterday, and to celebrate, director Peter Jackson got him to recreate the meme in the video below.</p>
