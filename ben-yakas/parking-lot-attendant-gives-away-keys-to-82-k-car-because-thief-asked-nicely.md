<p>Dae Do definitely didn&apos;t need to be Loki in order to steal an $82K black 2014 Audi from a parking lot in Tribeca&#x2014;police say all he had to do was conjure up some crocodile tears and ask for it. Do, 20, has been arrested after he allegedly convinced a parking attendant to give him the car, then went on a joyride causing thousands of dollars of damage.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405023914/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20140806/tribeca/parking-lot-gives-keys-82k-audi-thief-who-claimed-he-lost-his-ticket">According to DNAInfo</a>, Do told parking attendants at Alliance Parking on Canal Street that he&#x2019;d lost his claim ticket for the Audi, which was parked in an outdoor lot, but pleaded that he <em>needed</em> to get the car before midnight. And apparently, because he asked nicely, the attendant gave him the keys and let him drive off on August 1st.</p>

<p>Do was caught by police a day later speeding on the NJ Turnpike; he allegedly put more than a thousand miles on the car, smashed the fender, and stunk up the interior. &#x201C;He made the interior disgusting,&quot; said owner Caroline Bone. &quot;He not only ruined the front fender, he also put 1,100 miles on the car in about 24 hours.&quot;</p>

<p>Do has been charged with receiving stolen property and hindering apprehension. Bone added that she and her husband have spent over $2K to get the car out of the pound, and start cleaning it, and it&apos;ll take thousands more to fix it. They are obviously planning to the sue the parking lot. </p>
