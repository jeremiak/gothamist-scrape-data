<p>Since we tend to avoid Times Square under all circumstances, we&apos;ve yet to experience the joy of stumbling upon tween band <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150721052017/http://www.unlockingthetruthband.com/">Unlocking The Truth</a> rocking out with their particular brand of 6th grade shred metal. But after watching the videos below of the three-piece performing (legally) by the subway entrance at W 40th Street and 7th Avenue, it almost makes us want to take a trip to Disney Square just for them.</p>

<p>The group, which consists of 11-year-old Brooklyn residents Malcolm Brickhouse (electric guitar) and Jarad Dawkins (drums) (as well as new bassist Alec Atkins), first formed as Tears of Blood in 2007 (when they were...6). They&apos;ve been performing around Times Square for at least a year on-and-off. In a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150721052017/http://www.villagevoice.com/2012-09-12/music/at-metal-school-with-unlocking-the-truth/full/">profile by the Voice</a> last fall, they discussed their intense practice schedule (&quot;When we have a show, my mom makes us practice as late as 12, making us do hour sets and 15-minute breaks&quot;) and revealed they had some real insights into their fellow rockers, as when they discussed Slash: &quot;He&apos;s mean. He has a rhythm guitarist, but he wants the fame, so when the rhythm guitarist has a solo, he comes next to him and steals the fame.&quot;</p>

<p>If you want to see them in person, they have at least three shows scheduled in Times Square this month (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150721052017/https://www.facebook.com/UnlockingTheTruth">check their Facebook for more information</a>), including one tomorrow <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150721052017/http://profiles.sonicbids.com/events/index/UnlockingTheTruth/3511546">starting at noon</a>. If you do go, make sure to wear appropriate <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150721052017/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/11/video_happiest_headbanger_in_brookl.php">headbanging clothes.</a></p>
