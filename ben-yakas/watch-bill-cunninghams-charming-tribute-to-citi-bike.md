										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="201202_billc.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160204105212im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/garth/201202_billc.jpg" width="640" height="427"> <br> <i> Bill Cunningham, earlier this Fashion Week (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160204105212/http://www.samhorine.com/">Sam Horine</a> / Gothamist).</i></div> <p></p>

<p>We still have a bad taste in our mouths because of yesterday&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160204105212/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/01/video_conservative_who_represents_m.php">inflammatory anti-bikeshare &quot;Death By Bicycle&quot; video piece by Wall Street Journal editorial board member Dorothy Rabinowitz</a>. We felt an extreme disconnect from reality watching her frothing at the mouth over how &quot;begrimed&quot; the city has become thanks to a few thousand blue bikes. Thankfully, there are plenty of other much more rational and amusing voices in this city&#x2014;including the one and only <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160204105212/http://gothamist.com/tags/billcunningham">Bill Cunningham</a>, who made this charming video ode to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160204105212/http://gothamist.com/tags/citibike">Citi Bike.</a></p>

<center><iframe width="480" height="373" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" id="nyt_video_player" title="New York Times Video - Embed Player" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160204105212if_/http://graphics8.nytimes.com/bcvideo/1.0/iframe/embed.html?videoId=100000002256686&amp;playerType=embed"></iframe></center>

<p>Where Rabinowitz complained about &quot;bicyclists who veer in and out of the sidewalk, empowered by the city administration, with the idea that they are privileged,&quot; Cunningham sees only joy, humor, and progress in the new program. And if anything, he thinks it&apos;ll help improve foot traffic amongst impatient NYers:</p>

<blockquote>It&apos;s great for the New Yorkers who always have been totally impatient. When they walk on the sidewalk, they don&apos;t stop for anyone. And it&apos;s really hilarious to watch them come around the corner when two of them meet face-to-face and neither one will stop! But at any rate, now they&apos;re all on bikes.</blockquote>

<p>And he can&apos;t stop laughing all throughout the video! Who doesn&apos;t love this man! </p>
