<p>Last week on the season premiere of the final season of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130819165136/http://gothamist.com/tags/breakingbad"><em>Breaking Bad</em></a>, Skinny Pete and Badger discussed <em>Star Trek</em>, Jesse got a kind of paper route, and Hank and Walt had a chat. This week, Walt took a trip to the desert, Huell rolled around in a pile of money, and Skyler asked if she was under arrest. Check out some thoughts about the newest episode, &quot;Buried,&quot; below.</p>

<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="//web.archive.org/web/20130819165136if_/http://www.youtube.com/embed/ar7sf30PZu8?list=PLF579DA1151B2CD70" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p><strong>Buried</strong>: Walt buries the money in the desert. Hank buries the case for now&#x2014;he won&apos;t tell his colleagues about his brother-in-law&apos;s crimes until he can get real proof. Lydia does her best to bury her head in the sand by closing her eyes as she walks among the dead bodies of Declan&apos;s crew. Skyler buried her love for Walt, but there&apos;s a reason (beyond the kids) that she&apos;s stuck out this long&#x2014;whatever feelings she still has for the father of her children peaks out in the tender scene where she cradles him on the floor of the bathroom. Jesse is buried in guilt, trying anything to stop thinking about all those dead bodies and ruined lives he and his partner have left in their wake. And at one point, it briefly appears as if Huell may be buried in a giant pile of money.</p>

<p><strong>Scrooge McDuck</strong>: The first episode had Badger weaving a morality tale about abusing the transporter for pie-eating glory. This episode had Huell (&quot;I gotta do it man&quot;) and Bill Burr (&quot;We are here to do a job, not channel Scrooge McDuck!&quot;) lying down on the aforementioned giant pile of money and making snow angels.</p>

<p><strong>Hank&apos;s Obsession</strong>: From the moment he stepped out of the White&apos;s bathroom, Hank has been in shock. His interactions with Skyler, Marie and his colleagues at work don&apos;t help him snap out of it. His face has been flush ever since he learned who Walt really was; it&apos;s been a few days, but he doesn&apos;t look like he&apos;s slept much if at all. </p>

<p>Skyler claims that &quot;what you want is to get Walt at all costs.&quot; He&apos;s panting, he&apos;s muttering to himself under his breath, he&apos;s barely able to conceal his fury (&quot;put that animal away&quot;)&#x2014;it&apos;s clear why Skyler would think that. Is Hank just rushing everything, the enormity of Walt&apos;s betrayal clouding his vision? Was he honest that he cared first and foremost about protecting Skyler, or was he manipulating her (he did take that tape recorder out pretty quickly) to nail Heisenberg? In his quest for justice, has Hank started to break bad?</p>

<p><strong>&quot;Am I Under Arrest?&quot;</strong>: Skyler&apos;s repeated line &quot;Am I under arrest?&quot; was pretty killer&#x2014;she said it with the same unhinged cadence as she told her sister to &quot;shut up&quot; in the first half of season five. But this was different: Skyler went through a wide range of emotions as Hank talked throughout the scene, all with facial tics and a hushed tentativeness. Once she started speaking up, it was calculating (she needed a scene to get out of there); Skyler, like Walt, is getting good at thinking on her toes.</p>

<p><strong>Marie&apos;s Kleptomania Returns</strong>: It still feels like Hank and Marie are fated to look after Flynn and baby Holly eventually&#x2014;just not yet. And not like this, not when Marie is overwhelmed after learning the extent of Skyler&apos;s complicity with her husband&apos;s crimes, and tries to abduct Holly. It all ends with Skyler uttering her least believable lie yet, comforting the baby by cooing that it&apos;s all okay, when it most definitely won&apos;t be. Patton Oswalt may have nailed it:</p>

<p><strong>&quot;You Have To Get Him&quot;</strong>: The scariest line during tonight&apos;s episode wasn&apos;t, &quot;<em>Breaking Bad&apos;s</em> Aaron Paul stars in a premiere event: <em>Last House On The Left</em>.&quot; It was what Marie said to Hank after having a confrontation with her sister that was every bit as devastating for both parties as the one between Hank and Walt last week. This was one of actress Betsy Brandt&apos;s best scenes in the whole show. Last week, Hank uttered in disbelief, &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t even know who I&#x2019;m talking to.&quot; Marie is able to say that with a single slap.</p>

<p><strong>Lydia Stages A Bloody Coup In High Heels</strong>: Lydia is still all nerves, but she&apos;s cold as ice, just as Mike intimated. Declan doesn&apos;t care about the quality of their product, but Lydia&apos;s Czech Republic connection does. And so she teams up with Uncle Jack and Todd. At least her heels matched this time.</p>

<p>It seems as if she&apos;s picked up a couple lessons in ruthlessness and single-mindedness from Walt. Just as Walt made deal after deal to cook for and with bigger and badder folks as he began climbing the corporate meth ladder, so too has Lydia started trading alliances to stay one step ahead. Is Lydia Walt&apos;s parallel? She similarly doesn&apos;t look the part, which means people still underestimate her and end up getting shot by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130819165136/http://fridaynightlights.wikia.com/wiki/Herc">former <em>Friday Night Lights</em> actors</a>. Todd <em>is</em> definitely bizarro Jesse.</p>

<p><strong>Meth Damon</strong>: Todd is arguably the sweetest, certainly the most agreeable, and likely the least murderous member of his uncle&apos;s neo-Nazi gang. But even when he&apos;s trying to be helpful&#x2014;especially when he&apos;s trying to be helpful&#x2014;he&apos;s the creepiest. </p>

<p><strong>Weird Camera Angles Of The Night</strong>: The episode was excellently directed by one of the show&apos;s veterans, Michelle MacLaren (she&apos;s directed nine episodes so far, including the Hank and the Cousins shootout extravaganza &quot;One Minute&quot;). She made Walt look like the weak, sick shell of a man we first met in season one as he dug in the red sandy haze of the desert. And along with it, we got shovel POV and money barrel POV shots!</p>

<p><strong>Quiet Jesse</strong>: Tonight&apos;s episode was bookended by our only glimpses of a very worn out Jesse Pinkman who didn&apos;t have a single thing to say. In the beautiful, slow, Coen brothers-esque opening scene, an old man finds that the trail of money leads him to a near-catatonic Jesse spinning blankly on a roundabout. In the tense final scene, we learn he was picked up by police after that incident&#x2014;and we&apos;re left at the edge of our seats as Hank smooth talks his way into the interrogation room. Skyler might be sticking by Walt, but Jesse is the wild card now. And he certainly seems completely ready to confess all his sins to someone (next week&apos;s episode title is <em>Confessions</em>...).</p>

<p>And boy are we excited for the next episode. Have any two people been more damaged by Walt than Hank and Jesse? What are the chances that they&apos;ll actually work together to bring down Walt?</p>

<p><strong>A Lie Agree Upon</strong>: Walt truly seems ready to give himself up, but only if he can still cling to one last lie: that all those deaths were worth it for the money, and that the money can be used for good. Skyler seems to be all-in with him now, and she chooses the Pinkman strategy: &#x201C;The way Hank talks, he&#x2019;s got his suspicions but not much else,&#x201D; Skyler tells Walt as he offers to turn himself in. <strong>&#x201C;Maybe our best move is to stay quiet.&quot;</strong></p>

<p><strong>&quot;I Am The Danger&quot;</strong>: Walt spends too much time burying the money in the desert and contemplating turning himself in to pose any particular threats or plan any empires. Even his minor victories are short lived: after staring Hank down at the end of the driveway like two star-crossed adversaries in a Western, Walt goes into full panic mode (ala the frantic opening scene of season 4&apos;s &quot;Shotgun,&quot; also directed by MacLaren! She likes panicked Walt). When he comes out of that, he looks frailer than he has since season two as he wakes up on the bathroom floor (we even get a glimpse of him in the old tighty whities, the ultimate symbol of his early-series emasculation). He also finally admits he made a mistake, which is a very un-Heisenberg thing to do.</p>

<p>At least Walt always has time to yell at Saul: &quot;I&apos;ll send <em>you</em> to Belize.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Next Week</strong>: Hank has a talk with Jesse. Walt and Skyler go out for dinner with Hank and Marie (and don&apos;t drink margaritas). Samuel L. Jackson and Bob Odenkirk will appear on <em>Talking Bad</em>. And hopefully, Flynn will appear long enough to gulp down some OJ or grab some toast.</p>
