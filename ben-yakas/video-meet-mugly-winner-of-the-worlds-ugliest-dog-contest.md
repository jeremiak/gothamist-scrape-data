<p>Earlier this year, the winner of the 2011 World&#x2019;s Ugliest Dog contest <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130626221753/http://thedailywh.at/2012/03/15/rip-yoda-at/">died at the age of 15</a>. Owner Terry Schumacher noted that she initially mistook Yoda, a Chinese crested-Chihuahua mix, for a rat when she found her abandoned behind an apartment building. After a period of mourning, the time came yesterday to pick a sucessor to Yoda&#x2014;and little Mugly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130626221753/http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2012/06/uk_pup_mugly_crowned_worlds_ug.html">has now been declared</a> the new World&apos;s Ugliest Dog.</p>

<p>Mugly is an 8-year-old Chinese crested dog from the United Kingdom. &quot;I couldn&apos;t speak when they announced Mugly&apos;s name,&quot; said Bev Nicholson, the dog&apos;s owner. &quot;I didn&apos;t know which way to look. I was shaking as much as the dog.&quot; Mugly was awarded $1,000 and a year&#x2019;s worth of dog cookies. Mugly has some experience in the ugly dog contests: he was named Britain&apos;s ugliest dog in 2005. </p>
