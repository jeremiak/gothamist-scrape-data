<p>Parts of Staten Island were completely destroyed when Hurricane Sandy hit the city in 2012&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140817201134/http://gothamist.com/2012/11/02/dispatch_from_staten_island.php#photo-1">Midland Beach</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140817201134/http://gothamist.com/2012/11/14/video_inside_devastated_staten_isla.php">New Dorp</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140817201134/http://gothamist.com/2012/11/12/photos_south_of_staten_islands_midl.php#photo-1">Oakwood</a> were hit hardest, and saw the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140817201134/http://gothamist.com/2012/11/02/sandys_nyc_death_toll_rises_to_41_w.php">highest cluster of Sandy-related fatalities.</a> Since then, the city has been considering various ideas as how to avert another weather-related catastrophe from devastating the vulnerable area. One such idea that is gaining momentum: a wall of oysters.</p>

<p>&quot;They don&apos;t act as a flood wall that completely stops the water,&quot; Gena Wirth of SCAPE/Landscape Architecture, the project&apos;s lead designers, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140817201134/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20140815/tottenville/wall-of-oysters-will-help-staten-island-weather-future-storms">told DNAInfo</a>. &quot;They reduce water velocity, they reduce erosion of the shoreline and they reduce the height and intensity of the waves.&quot; The project is called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140817201134/http://www.rebuildbydesign.org/project/scape-landscape-architecture-final-proposal/">&quot;Living Breakwaters,&quot;</a> and you can see a video of the proposal below.</p>

<p><iframe src="//web.archive.org/web/20140817201134if_/http://player.vimeo.com/video/91648619" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen></iframe> </p><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140817201134/http://vimeo.com/91648619">Living Breakwaters</a> from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140817201134/http://vimeo.com/rebuildbydesign">Rebuild by Design</a> on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140817201134/https://vimeo.com/">Vimeo</a>.</p><p></p>

<p>&quot;Living Breakwaters&quot; has been awarded $60 million via a federal competition for a pilot program in the Raritan Bay off of Staten Island. Designers hope that the reefs will also restore some ecological aspects of area.  &quot;Actually by attenuating the waves the project could potentially reduce the flood plane in that area,&quot; said Pippa Brashear, who is part of one of the teams working on the project. &quot;That could bring that down by two feet, that could make the difference of a floor of your house being in and out of the insurance zone.&quot;</p>

<p>One very important addendum: you can&apos;t eat the oysters. So there will be an Oyster Cam installed to deter people from doing so: &quot;Anyone can log on and kind of check out the oyster cam,&quot; Wirth added. &quot;There will be a camera out there that would help make sure that people aren&apos;t harvesting the oysters to eat them.&quot;</p>
