The steaks were high for those involved, who did everything they could to steer clear of hurting the animal, who had escaped capture twice before thanks to her deer friends! <p></p>

<p>Milford animal control director Rick George says it took two tranquilizer darts to subdue the cow; the 1 year old calf was not injured, except for a bloody nose she received when trying to get out of the feeding pen the group had made to contain her. But the oddest part of an overall odd story (the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130523111721/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/conn_cow_found_after_months_on_the_8RCkfADHksW1ypqc5i5hoK?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">Post erroneously claimed</a> Wanda was 800 pounds!) is <em>who</em> Wanda was hanging out with during her five month journey: Wanda had joined up with a herd of deer who acted as her protection. The deer would stomp and snort to alert Wanda to possible danger, George said. </p>

<p>So for one brilliant moment, Wanda the 400-pound runaway cow and her deer best friends were legendairy throughout the forests of Connecticut. We feel we should apologize for all the terrible cow puns in the post&#x2014;after all, we cud have stopped, but we didn&apos;t.</p>
