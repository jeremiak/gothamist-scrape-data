<p>As Neil Sedaka <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150914220545/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbad22CKlB4">once noted</a>, breaking up <em>is</em> hard to do&#x2014;but what he left out is that having your ex-girlfriend&apos;s new boyfriend call an airport to say you are carrying a bomb on you is EVEN HARDER. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150914220545/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/national/plane_man_charged_recall_love_triangle_boIwY3T9cssZcA22RxiojM">That&apos;s basically what happened</a> to Christopher Shell, who turned 29 on Thursday, the same day his ex&apos;s new boyfriend sought to &quot;avenge&quot; her honor by calling in a bomb hoax. </p>

<p>Shell was on a U.S. Airways flight bound from Philadelphia to Dallas when all the commotion happened. Well, at first things were okay: &quot;I&apos;m not going to lie, I feel Blessed on of my new neighbors works Security at PHL airport, walked me right in str8 though security with a breeze, and also got us a couple free fruits!&quot; he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150914220545/http://www.facebook.com/christopher.shell.7">wrote on Facebook</a>. But after the flight took off, Kenneth W. Smith Jr. allegedly called police at the Philadelphia airport to report that Shell was carrying a liquid explosive. Shell was merely upset at first, as he wrote on Facebook:</p>

<blockquote>Im not going to lie, I&apos;m pretty disappointed in US Airways currently. We just spent a half hour in the air to be notified that the plane, &quot;has technical difficulties&quot; and had to fly back! Flight 1267 CANCELED. Gay!</blockquote>

<p>Once it landed, Shell was taken off the plane at gunpoint by authorities. &#x201C;He was obviously very alarmed as I would be if, if heavily armed police officers entered a plane to take me off. He was certainly stunned,&#x201D; said Philadelphia Police Chief Inspector Joe Sullivan. During their interrogation, Shell said that this &#x201C;nasty prank&quot; grew out of a feud involving himself, his ex, and her new boyfriend &quot;Kenny.&quot; Shell had recently traded &quot;hostile messages&quot; on his cellphone with his ex-girlfriend about the situation, according to the affidavit.</p>

<p>When Smith was questioned, he admitted making the call from a payphone to &quot;avenge&quot; the ex, because he claimed Shell had posted a compromising picture of her on Facebook (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150914220545/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2012/09/06/us-airways-plane-returns-to-philly-over-phony-tip-about-explosives/">CBS reports Smith</a> became enraged &quot;when Shell claimed he had slept with his old girlfriend again&quot;). Smith has since been charged with conveying false information that interfered with aviation and using an instrument of commerce (the payphone) to do so.</p>

<p>Not that things went smoothly for Shell the rest of his birthday: after he was cleared in Philadelphia, he was allowed to fly to the Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport. And upon arrival there, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150914220545/http://www.philly.com/philly/news/20120907_Man_victim_of_airline_hoax_in_Philly__then_gets_busted_in_Dallas.html?c=r">he was swiftly arrested</a> for outstanding warrants, including a 2006 conviction for possession of a controlled substance. But at least he bounced back enough to make one more Facebook wall post: &quot;If u have questions or want an interview with me, it will cost u $$$$ until then. Sry. Message me your offers as I&apos;ll go with the most $$$!&quot;<br>
