<p>Police are looking for a naked man who allegedly tried to rape a woman in Brooklyn this week. </p>

<p>The incident happened yesterday around 11:15 p.m. in the vicinity of East 55th Street and Avenue J in the Flatlands section of Brooklyn. The 23-year-old victim was walking toward her home a few blocks away when the unidentified suspect, who was completely nude, grabbed her from behind. He allegedly threw her to the ground and forcibly touched her. </p>

<p>The woman was able to free herself as the man tried to rape her. According <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161113153655/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/nude-man-rape-brooklyn-woman-asked-pray-article-1.2771638">to the Daily News</a>, the suspect said, &quot;pray for me&quot; before running away.</p>
