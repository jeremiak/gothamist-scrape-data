<p>The man <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150515025618/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/04/video_man_screaming_i_hate_white_pe.php">who was attacked in broad daylight in Union Square</a> this past week is allegedly brain dead. Suspect LaShawn Marten, 31, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150515025618/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/06/union_square_possible_hate_crime.php">has been charged with felony assault</a> in the incident, which occurred around 2:45 p.m. on Wednesday. The 62-year-old victim, who Marten is accused of punching in the face, hit his head on the pavement, causing him to slip into a coma at Bellevue Hospital. But <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150515025618/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20130906/union-square/man-coma-after-racist-union-square-attack-sources-say">according to DNAInfo</a>, the victim has been declared brain dead.</p>

<p>They say the man in a coma is a Sheepshead Bay resident who is the primary caretaker for his 92-year-old mother, who has Alzheimer&apos;s disease. &quot;He&apos;s a very good guy,&quot; neighbor Janice Nadel said. &quot;He always helps us when we need to change a lightbulb or something.&quot; </p>

<p>Marten had been playing chess in the Square before the incident; sources say he jumped up allegedly shouting &quot;I hate white people,&quot; then struck the first victim. The suspect &quot;made statements to the effect that &#x2018;I&#x2019;m going to punch the first white man that I see,&quot; Police Commissioner Ray Kelly confirmed yesterday. </p>

<p>&quot;It was random, it was for no apparent reason,&quot; James Hall-Collins, who took the above video of the aftermath, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150515025618/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/NYPD-Hate-Crimes-Unit-Investigating-Union-Square-Attack-Police-Commissioner-222759461.html">told NBC</a>. &quot;He just walked up and hit him.&quot; Two other men, 48- and 18-years-old, came to the aide of the first victim, and were also attacked by Marten. </p>

<p>Police say Marten has a prior conviction for assault in NY, and the he has numerous other prior arrests, mostly out of state. When he was arraigned Thursday night, DNAInfo report he mocked the judge and asked that his bail be set at one penny&#x2014;in response, the judge set bail at $1 million. </p>

<p>Police are still investigating the incident as a possible hate crime. Witness Joey Boots told us cops have surveillance video (from across the street) that shows the incident: &quot;You can see the guy getting up, taking his shirt off then putting it back on, looking agitated.&quot;</p>
