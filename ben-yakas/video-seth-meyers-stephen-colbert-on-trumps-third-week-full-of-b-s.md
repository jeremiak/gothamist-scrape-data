<p>It feels like a lifetime, but we&apos;ve now reached the end of the third week of Trump&apos;s presidency. And the amount of huge and ridiculous scandals&#x2014;from Trump&apos;s national security adviser <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170408000620/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/09/us/flynn-is-said-to-have-talked-to-russians-about-sanctions-before-trump-took-office.html?smid=tw-share&amp;_r=0">talking US sanctions with Russian officials</a> to Trump&apos;s spokeswoman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170408000620/http://gothamist.com/2017/02/09/buy_ivanka_or_labor_camp.php">shilling for his daughter&apos;s brand</a> in front of the presidential seal&#x2014;keep adding up. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170408000620/http://gothamist.com/tags/sethmeyers">Seth Meyers</a> tried to hit as many of this week&apos;s scandals as he could, to paint a picture of how Trump has been abusing his presidential powers, lying about facts, and then blaming everything on the media. &quot;Trump hasn&apos;t just used his presidential powers to threaten private companies and state lawmakers: he&apos;s also used his office to attack the free press by repeatedly claiming there&apos;s a conspiracy in the media to cover things up, like what he claims is the historically high crime rate,&quot; Meyers said before playing a clip of Trump lying about the crime rate. &quot;You know, it&apos;s easy to surprise people if you just make shit up.&quot; Watch as Meyers turns to alcohol to deal with Trump.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170408000620/http://gothamist.com/tags/stephencolbert">Stephen Colbert</a> followed a similar thread, tackled Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch&apos;s statements on Trump&apos;s anti-judicial comments, Trump&apos;s less-than-stellar military record, and his predilection for calling adviser&apos;s at 3 a.m.: &quot;That must have been annoying, but still better than a 3 a.m. text from Trump that says, &apos;U up?&apos;&quot; Watch as Colbert receives his own call from Trump, who is very confused about this whole government thing.</p>

<p>Colbert also coined the term &quot;FlakeNews&quot; and covered Conway&apos;s &quot;free commercial&quot; for Ivanka&apos;s brand: &quot;You can trust Kellyanne Conway&apos;s fashion advice&#x2014;most high school marching bands already do.&quot;</p>
