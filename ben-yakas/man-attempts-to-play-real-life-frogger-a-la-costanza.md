<p>Not everyone in the US is as obsessed with the snowpocalyptic <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425172909/http://gothamist.com/tags/blizzageddon">Boxing Day Blizzard</a> as we are. Some people are just going about their normal, regular, everyday lives, such as a 23-year-old man from South Carolina <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425172909/http://www.foxnews.com/us/2010/12/29/cops-man-playing-real-life-frogger-hit-suv/">who was hit</a> by an SUV while trying to play a real-life version of the arcade classic <em>Frogger</em>. </p>

<p>According to Anderson Chief Jimmy Dixon, the man had been discussing the game with his friends prior to the incident; he allegedly yelled &quot;go&quot; before darting into oncoming traffic in the four-lane highway. Of course, the incident resembles the late-season <em>Seinfeld </em>episode where George Costanza attempts this very thing (see the video below). We hope the young man doesn&apos;t continue mimicking Costanza, and risk inheriting the life of a bitter Latvian Orthodox double dipper who once tried to seduce his cousin.</p>
