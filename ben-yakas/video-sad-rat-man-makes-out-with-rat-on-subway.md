<p>Do you remember Big Balls? That&apos;s the rat in the above picture who we met <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150314022835/http://gothamist.com/2010/08/10/sad_rat_man.php#photo-1">last summer</a>, after a reader sent us a photo of the owner stuffing him in his mouth. The tipster who took the photo told us, &quot;The rat&apos;s name is Big Balls. The guy has it written on a piece of paper he shows tourists when they ask.&quot; Now, new footage of Sad Rat Man stuffing Big Balls in his mouth have emerged on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150314022835/http://nyctheblog.blogspot.com/2011/03/man-enthusiastically-makes-out-with-rat.html#more">NYC The Blog</a>. In the first video, it appears he is only kissing/making out with Big Balls, since he doesn&apos;t stuff him in his mouth entirely. In the second video, he swills Big Balls in his mouth as if he were wine. Warning: NSFratphobics.</p>
