<p>As Mayor Bloomberg <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170319173603/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/09/bloomberg_gives_blizzard_update_loo.php">discussed earlier this morning</a>, at this point we&apos;re totally done with the storm <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170319173603/http://gothamist.com/tags/nemo">somewhat-sketchily-known-as-Nemo</a>. And it&apos;s safe to say that the blizzard wasn&apos;t really as bad <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170319173603/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/06/snow_storm.php">as was first predicted.</a> All that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170319173603/http://gawker.com/5982823/send-this-video-to-all-the-people-in-your-life-who-are-panic+buying-bread-and-milk-right-now-because-of-some-snow">panic shopping</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170319173603/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/08/dumping_nemo_has_the_weather_channe.php">nomenclature fretting</a> was for naught in NYC. So on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170319173603/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/09/free_snow_day_snow_day_snow_day_in.php">this official NYC Snow Day</a>, we encourage you to go forth and shake out the cobwebs like the shirtless jogger above, who was captured running through Central Park early this morning.</p>

<p>Not incidentally, Central Park got 11 and a half inches during the storm, which should make for some fantastic conditions <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170319173603/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/08/your_5_borough_guide_on_where_to_go.php">for sledding</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170319173603/https://twitter.com/search?q=dog%20central%20park&amp;src=typd">animal-play-time</a>. Or you could strap onto a cab and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170319173603/http://imgur.com/6j41qLU">go sledding like this dude</a>. Or if you&apos;re into <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170319173603/http://mashable.com/2013/02/08/harlem-shake/">dumb internet memes</a>, you could always get your friends together and do the &quot;Harlem Shake&quot; or whatever on Park Avenue.</p>
