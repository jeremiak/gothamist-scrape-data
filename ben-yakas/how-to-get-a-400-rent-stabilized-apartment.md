<p>Generally, we think of rent stabilized apartments as the dominion of the politically-connected, the corrupt, the elderly, and the damn lucky, no good relatives of those elderly. But just as with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229202921/http://gothamist.com/tags/lost">the island</a>, there are certain loopholes a savvy person can use to get their very own rent-stabilized apartment!</p>

<p>There is a loophole in the city&apos;s housing law that applies to the city&apos;s 30,000 Single Room Occupancies (SRO): &quot;An individual can become a permanent tenant by simply requesting a lease. If someone comes in and pays for a night, he or she can request a lease orally, or in writing. The very act of requesting a lease gives you statutory tenancy,&quot; Marti Weithman, director of the SRO Law Project, told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229202921/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/nyc_suite_est_deal_XpF8N7Rh7prq2LqNnmdsiL?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">the Post</a>. Anyone who stays in one of these rooms for 30 consecutive days automatically becomes a permanent resident. </p>

<p>That&apos;s just what retired computer-systems administrator Dorothy Williamson did; the 70-year-old checked into the Imperial Court Hotel at 79th Street and West End Avenue as a &quot;tourist&quot; in 2009 for a 10-day stay. Two years later, she now pays $398 a month for a room on the UWS. Keep in mind, you will be living in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229202921/http://www.gothamist.com/tags/sro">an SRO</a>, which means communal bathrooms, small rooms, and in some places, local residents trying to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229202921/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/26/uws_sros_sue_to_stay_in_business.php">get rid of</a> your building. But for a certain <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141229202921/http://gothamist.com/tags/jimmymcmillan">rent-obsessed politician/musician</a>, we think this&apos;ll sound like music to his ears. </p>
