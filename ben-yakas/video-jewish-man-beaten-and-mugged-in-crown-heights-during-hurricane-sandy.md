<p>A Jewish man was brutally beaten and mugged by five attackers in Brooklyn just as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130613144923/http://gothamist.com/tags/hurricanesandy">Hurricane Sandy</a> hit the city Monday night. The attack happened just before 7 p.m. on Monday, at the corner of Albany Avenue and President Street in Crown Heights. As you can see in the surveillance video below, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130613144923/http://www.crownheights.info/index.php?itemid=47920">obtained by Crown Heights.info</a>, the victim is continually punched and kicked by the perps as the winds howl around them.</p>

<p>Eventually, the suspects stole the victim&apos;s wallet and cell phone. But before leaving the scene, one of the perps &quot;sadistically&quot; steps on the unconscious man&apos;s head. We contacted the NYPD for more information, and we were told they would &quot;have to look into it.&quot;</p>
