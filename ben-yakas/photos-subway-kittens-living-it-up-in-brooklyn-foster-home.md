</div></div>					<p>You may recall that just before Labor Day Weekend, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150402173214/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/29/video_adorable_kittens_frolic_on_su.php">a pair of adorable kittens frolicking on the train tracks</a> brought subway service to a standstill in Brooklyn for several hours. August and Arthur were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150402173214/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/30/subway_kittens_finally_rescued_will.php">eventually safely rescued</a>&#x2014;no thanks to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150402173214/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/31/joe_lhota_would_have_let_subway_kit.php">anti-kitten mayoral candidate Joe Lhota&apos;s</a>&#x2014; and the two are now being fostered in an apartment in Bushwick. &quot;They&apos;re still really shy. I think they&apos;ve been stray for a while,&quot; foster dad Steven Liu <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150402173214/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/subway-kittens-find-home-brooklyn-article-1.1446404">told the News</a>. &quot;We&apos;re not thinking about giving them a bath yet; they&apos;re still really scared.&quot;</p>

<p>August and Arthur, who are believed to be around two months old, have everything a kitten could want: scratching posts, toys (including a giant plush rat), tons of cardboard boxes to conquer, and two other cats (Alice and Ralph) to play with. Liu says he&apos;ll gives updates about the kittens&apos; progress on his site <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150402173214/http://scratchingpad.tumblr.com/">Scratching Post</a>. &quot;My roommates helped me rearrange the kitten towers so that there are a lot hiding places when they get scared,&quot; he wrote in his first entry on them. &quot;When we&#x2019;re down there, the kittens are pretty calm and will start purring when we pick them up for some good old chin and butt scratches.&quot; </p>

<p>However, the living room of the apartment literally scares the shit out of them&#x2014;they also don&apos;t seem to have much fondness for the Daily News. During their photoshoot, the kittens let Liu know their feelings through <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150402173214/http://scratchingpad.tumblr.com/post/60343685422/after-the-ny-daily-news-photoshoot-with-the">ancient kitten communication techniques. </a> </p>
