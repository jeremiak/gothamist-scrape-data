Who hasn&apos;t been curious about meeting who lives there now? A couple months ago, the <em>New Yorker</em> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140816034444/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/12/christopher_walken_freaked_out_by_t.php">took Christopher Walken</a> to his childhood home in Astoria for such a trip, and last week, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140816034444/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/08/23/2010-08-23_seinfeld_star_jerry_stiller_visits_chez_costanza__its_fantastic_owners_going_hom.html">Daily News took actor Jerry Stiller</a> there as well. But Stiller, who played Frank Costanza, originator of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140816034444/http://gothamist.com/2009/12/23/happy_festivus_everyone.php">Festivus</a>, on <em>Seinfeld</em>, was going to visit his TV home, the brick house on 37th St. that was used for the exterior shots of the Costanza residence. And Stiller <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140816034444/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/08/23/2010-08-23_seinfeld_star_jerry_stiller_visits_chez_costanza__its_fantastic_owners_going_hom.html">decided</a> to do a stop-and-chat.<p></p>

<p>Stiller had never visited the home before, and was only there to pose by the house as part of a series on historic places in Queens. There he met Jack and Bessie Lopipero, both 84, the long-time residents of the house, who were flabbergasted and delighted by his unexpected visit, greeting him at the door: &quot;Hey, Costanza&apos;s father!&quot; The three spent an hour talking fondly. Bessie said, &quot;This is the happiest day of my life. You really made my day.&quot; Later on, Stiller told the News, &quot;This is probably the best thing I ever did in my life.&quot; But what the hell does that mean??</p>
