<p>Jewels <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503021508/http://thevillager.com/villager_221/anticsoutofhand.html">was a regular</a> on &#x201C;Crusty Row&#x201D; in Tompkins Square Park&#x2014;a section of park benches frequented by homeless and traveling punks&#x2014;for two decades. East Village photographer Bob Arihood, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503021508/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/02/bob_arihood_founder_of_neither_more.php">who died</a> two years ago, chronicled Jewels&apos; life on his blog <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503021508/http://neithermorenorless.blogspot.com/search?q=Jewels">Neither More Nor Less</a> (you can see one of his photos above). Jewels was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503021508/http://gawker.com/129714/les-jewels-the-face-of-east-village-heroin">very open about his heroin use</a>, telling the NY Times in 2005, &quot;I died four times in one day, and I&apos;m still here.&quot; </p>

<p>In recent years, Jewels had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503021508/http://www.flickr.com/photos/11205114@N03/6200840373">gotten involved</a> with Occupy Wall Street, protested against <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503021508/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/07/east_village_lefties_discomfit_the.php#photo-1">East Village gentrification</a>, and reportedly was sober for a time. Below, you can see a video of him trash sledding.</p>
