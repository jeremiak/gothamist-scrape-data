<p><strong>Update Below</strong> A 19-year-old woman has been accused of throwing her newborn baby down a garbage chute in the Bronx yesterday. According <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130601152210/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/teen_survive_throws_infant_down_LZdcLAdwS34AVSelSHurtJ?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=%0A++++++++++Brooklyn">to the Post</a>, the baby was found dead in a trash bag in the basement of the West Farms Road building on Saturday. &#x201C;We all went down together and we saw the small little bag in the garbage,&#x201D; said Jose Garcia, the building&#x2019;s super. &#x201C;I was about to change the garbage bags myself. I might not have even seen it if I didn&#x2019;t know to look for it.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Police say the teen went to Albert Einstein Hospital afterwards and reportedly admitted to doctors that she gave birth, then threw the child down a garbage chute that leads to an incinerator. It&apos;s not clear whether the baby was born alive or not, but officials did note the baby appeared to have been born premature. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130601152210/http://longisland.news12.com/news/police-newborn-found-in-dumpster-1.5153721?qr=1">Neighbors told News 12</a> more details about the incident, including that the teen gave birth in her bathroom and asked her brother for scissors and a bag. No charged have been filed as of yet.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> The accused teen, 19-year-old Ariel Devonish-Francis, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130601152210/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/bronx/bronx_trash_charged_chute_misdemeanor_h8rTSeS4uMiURsc770ZInM">has now been charged</a> with unlawful disposal of a cadaver, a misdemeanor. She could face more charges if t e city Medical Examiner&apos;s Office finds that the premature baby she delivered was born alive before it was thrown out in a black plastic bag.</p>
