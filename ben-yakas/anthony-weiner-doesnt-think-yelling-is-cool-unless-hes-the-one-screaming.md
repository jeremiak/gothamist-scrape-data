<p>NY Times reporter <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504131702/https://twitter.com/mikiebarb">Michael Barbaro</a> has had some fun on the campaign trail recently following the merry adventures of our numerous mayoral candidates. This week alone, he picked up on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504131702/http://gothamist.com/tags/anthonyweiner">Anthony Weiner&apos;s</a> latest unofficial slogan (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504131702/https://twitter.com/mikiebarb/status/352191497191432194">&quot;It&apos;s just a couple of dick pics&quot;</a>), and witnessed him <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504131702/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/04/nyregion/weiner-to-heckler-take-a-hike.html?_r=1&amp;">getting heckled on the Upper West Side</a>. It seems Weiner is not a fan of yelling...unless he&apos;s the one doing the yelling. </p>

<p>&quot;I&#x2019;m not going to be bullied by people like you, now or when I become mayor,&quot; Weiner told the heckler, who was angry Weiner supported the war in Iraq in 2002. &quot;If you want to have a conversation, I respect you enough to have a conversation. <strong>But yelling at the top of your lungs is not the New York way. We don&#x2019;t roll like that</strong>.&quot; First off, it totally IS the New York way to yell at the top of your lungs when you&apos;re arguing, whether or not you realize you&apos;re doing so. </p>

<p>And more importantly, this is Weiner we&apos;re talking about&#x2014;the guy loves getting theatrical and yelly any chance he gets, as you can see in the classic video below.</p>

<p>Even this highlight reel of his &quot;best&quot; moments is chock full of him talking over people and yelling at them while having &quot;conversations.&quot; </p>
