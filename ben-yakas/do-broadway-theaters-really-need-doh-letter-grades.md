title: Do Broadway Theaters Really Need DOH Letter Grades?

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:300px; "> <img alt="61911theater.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110621081753im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/61911theater.jpg" width="300" height="201"> <br> <i><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110621081753/http://www.flickr.com/photos/nyclovesnyc/5215869909/">NYC[heart]NYC&apos;s flickr</a></i></div> As we <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110621081753/http://gothamist.com/tags/lettergrades">well know</a>, all restaurants in the city get letter grades from the DOH, whether or not they <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110621081753/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/15/doh_fines_804_restaurants_for_hidin.php">decide to show them</a>. Some have even suggested that supermarkets <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110621081753/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/08/should_supermarkets_be_given_letter.php">should get them</a> as well. But do Broadway theaters really need grades too?<p></p>

<p>Because theaters have concession stands, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110621081753/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2011/06/19/2011-06-19_bway_cant_song__dance_out_of_grades.html">they&apos;re subject to the same</a> Health Department inspections and letter grades as regular restaurants, which even the DOH admits sounds a bit funny, considering no cooking is ever done: &quot;Even with the limited food and drink offerings typically found at theaters, there is a risk of food-borne illness if food safety practices are not followed,&quot; said agency spokeswoman Zoe Tobin. All of the city&apos;s theaters will have been graded by the fall, and will be required to put them on display, just as with restaurants...although, we all know how that&apos;s going. </p>

<p>That last point may cause a problem: the director of business affairs for private company Theater Refreshment Co. noted that many theaters are restricted as to where it can post signs. &quot;We post them on the inside of our office door,&quot; Krista Lynn Peckyno <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110621081753/http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118038751?refCatId=15">told Variety Magazine.</a> She added that unannounced inspections have been &quot;an annoyance,&quot; with inspectors something coming during performance, or even at intermission, the worst time for concession operators. But she does see a point to the process, which can generate fines from $200 to $2,000 per violation: &quot;<strong>It seems to be a good way for the city to make some money</strong>,&quot; she said skeptically.</p>
