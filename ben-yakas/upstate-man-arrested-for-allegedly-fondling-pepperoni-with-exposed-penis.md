<p>Here at Gothamist, we strive to provide you with all the hard hitting <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426151836/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/17/brooklyn_bar_on_the_hunt_for_the_sm.php">penis-related news stories</a> of the day, from Brooklyn to Potsdam. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426151836/http://www.wwnytv.com/news/local/Potsdam-Man-Accused-Of-Rubbing-Pepperoni-On-His-207749061.html">Police have arrested</a> a 41-year-old upstate man who allegedly rubbed a packaged stick of pepperoni on his exposed penis. The pepperoni <em>was</em> packaged, but his package was not. See what we just did there? Yeah, it&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426151836/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/21/video_rebecca_black.php">Friday, Friday</a>...</p>

<p>Potsdam resident John Allison <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426151836/http://wzlx.cbslocal.com/2013/05/17/mugshot-of-the-day-fondling-some-pepperoni/">was caught</a> on surveillance camera at a local Hannaford store fondling the pepperoni. After he rubbed his person on the pepperoni, he put it back on the shelf. Allison has been charged with public lewdness; he was also charged with fourth-degree criminal mischief because Hannaford is unable to sell the pepperoni. </p>

<p>On the surface, this is highly odd and gross. But maybe we&apos;re just looking at it the wrong way: maybe customs are different in northern NY. And at least the pepperoni was packaged&#x2014;no one <em>had</em> to know about this incident. Hannaford&apos;s should just be glad that Allison didn&apos;t try to steal any steak.</p>
