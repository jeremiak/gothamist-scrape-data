<p>Yankee Stadium <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130303055317/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/30/sports/ncaafootball/yankees-call-up-some-tougher-sod-for-pinstripe-bowl.html?_r=1&amp;partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">has been re-sodded</a> with thick, heavy Long Island turf for this afternoon&apos;s second annual Pinstripe Bowl between Rutgers (8-4) and Iowa State (6-6). People seem quite excited about it too: &quot;Pinstripe Bowl&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130303055317/https://twitter.com/#!/search/%22Pinstripe%20Bowl%22">is trending on Twitter</a> in NY; the Empire State Building <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130303055317/http://www.newyorkology.com/archives/2011/12/empire_state_in_2.php">was lit last night in anticipation</a> &#x2014;red, white and red on the north and south sides for Rutgers, red, yellow and red on the east and west sides for Iowa State&#x2014;and Rick Santorum <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130303055317/http://www.ricksantorum.com/pressrelease/santorum-public-schedule-december-30-31">is hosting his own Pinstripe Bowl Watch Party</a>! Hell, they even rang the bell at the NYSE:</p>

<p>&quot;Certainly looking forward to having a lot of Rutgers faithful in the stands,&quot; Rutgers coach Greg Schiano <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130303055317/http://espn.go.com/new-york/ncf/story/_/id/7401988/pinstripe-bowl-preview-rutgers-scarlet-knights-versus-iowa-state-cyclones">said yesterday afternoon at the final pregame news conference</a> at Yankee Stadium. &quot;You know how that can become a big advantage in a football game.&quot; Despite lacking that home-field advantage, Iowa State coach Paul Rhoads agreed that playing at Yankee Stadium had his players pumped: &quot;It&apos;s one of the greatest sports venues that there is, and to get a chance to play a football game in it will be a lifetime&apos;s worth of memories for our football team.&quot;</p>

<p>Rutgers already played a game at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130303055317/http://gothamist.com/tags/yankeestadium">Yankee Stadium</a> this year, beating Army 27-12 on Nov. 12. They&apos;ve sold out more than 13,000 tickets of their allotment for today&apos;s game, which kicks off at 3:20 p.m. (and will be shown on ESPN). Hopefully <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130303055317/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/06/metallica.php">in keeping with stadium tradition</a>, Metallica&apos;s &quot;Enter Sandman&quot; will be heard at least once today.</p>

<p>And don&apos;t forget, there&apos;s quite a lot on the line: a basket of Italian foods and a bushel of Iowa sweet corn.</p>
