										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="9910rail.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505123006im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/9910rail.jpg" width="250" height="188" class="image-left"> </span>A man miraculously survived a roll in the hay with the third rail Monday night, despite being zapped with 625-volts of electricity. Witnesses say Andy Morris, 44, was pushed onto the tracks at the Broadway Junction station in East New York after a drawn out drunken argument. &quot;He first started twitching and then you started seeing smoke coming from his head. <strong>You could smell the flesh burning</strong>,&quot; witness Marlon Probherbs <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505123006/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/09/09/2010-09-09_hit_3rd_rail__lived_survives_625volt_shock_after_maniac_shoves_him_onto_track.html">told the Daily News</a>.</p>

<p>Morris, a currently unemployed construction worker, doesn&apos;t remember the events of the evening: &quot;When they electrocuted me, they erased my memory.&quot; But witnesses say that he got into a verbal argument with two younger passengers while on a Queens-bound A train; the argument spilled onto the subway platform 10 stops later. Witnesses <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505123006/http://www.fox13now.com/news/wpix-man-survives-subway-fall,0,4164682.story">told</a> cops that Morris was drunk and belligerent, and took a couple swings at the other men. Probherbs says Morris was as much an instigator as he was victim, but a third party watching the melee at the platform is the person who pushed him onto the tracks. Witnesses told police they were certain he was killed.</p>

<p>Despite surviving his brush with the third rail, Morris, who lives at Samaritan Village, a homeless shelter in East New York, fears he won&apos;t be able to work again: &quot;My fingers are fried.&quot; Police have not charged Morris with any crimes. In April, a MTA track worker <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505123006/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/26/nyc_transit_worker_dies_after_third.php">died from a third rail electrocution</a>; the union says the third rail was turned off during the work, but for some reason, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505123006/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/27/transit_worker_killed_when_third_ra.php">it was turned on again</a>.  </p>
