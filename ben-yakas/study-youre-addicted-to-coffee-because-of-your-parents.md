<p>Last week, we dove <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110515103335/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/01/dumb_study_the_beautiful_people_are.php">head first into</a> the USA Today &quot;Your Life&quot; section, and went on a fantastical journey of unsurprising discoveries! We learned some tough lessons about ostracized overweight children, had a few laughs about irritating &quot;beautiful&quot; people, and realized that &quot;Your Life&quot; really meant <em>&quot;Our Lives.&quot;</em> And this week, they bring even <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110515103335/http://yourlife.usatoday.com/health/story/2011/04/Coffee-addiction-may-be-grounded-in-genes/45899600/1">better news</a>: our coffee addiction isn&apos;t our fault! It&apos;s all because of our damn genes!</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110515103335/http://yourlife.usatoday.com/health/story/2011/04/Coffee-addiction-may-be-grounded-in-genes/45899600/1">According to</a> the new public health study, funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, there are two specific genes which help determine whether you&apos;ll be addicted to coffee. The genes are labeled CYP1A2 and AHR-the former has been linked to the process by which caffeine is metabolized, and the latter regulates the activity of CYP1A2. And people who carry the  &quot;high-consumption&quot; variation of either gene appear to drink more coffee. </p>

<p>&quot;People don&apos;t really suspect it, but genetics plays a big role in a lot of behaviors, such as smoking and alcohol consumption. And now it turns out that it has a part in how much caffeine we drink,&quot; said study co-author Dr. Neil Caporaso, branch chief of genetic epidemiology at the National Cancer Institute. We&apos;re going to assume this means that all those with the &quot;high-consumption&quot; variety just can&apos;t help it if they have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110515103335/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/03/news_you_can_use_drinking_coffee_is.php">bigger hearts</a>, too.</p>

<p>They discovered that people who carried the highest-consumption genotype of either the CYP1A2 or the AHR gene consumed an extra 40 milligrams of caffeine compared with those bearing the lowest-consumption genotype. Caporaso says the interesting part is realizing that the way we drink caffeine is not just random: &quot;It&apos;s related to the genetic hand of cards you were dealt. And that means that now we can dissect people into fast metabolizers and slow metabolizers: people who have just one small coffee and feel well-caffeinated for a day, and people who have two large ones and then another Coke a little later in the day to get the same effect.&quot; This news really puts all of those $30 cups of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110515103335/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/27/cat_poop_coffee_goes_for_30_a_cup.php">cat poo</a> coffee into perspective.</p>
