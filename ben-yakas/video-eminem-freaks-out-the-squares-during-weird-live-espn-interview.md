<p>Apparently Eminem has a new album coming out, so he appeared during ESPN&#x2019;s Michigan-Notre Dame broadcast Saturday to promote his latest single, &#x201C;Berzerk,&#x201D; because why wouldn&apos;t a rapper premiere his music video during a college football game? Eminem apparently was weirded out by the whole thing, and proceeded to act bizarre and stilted on camera. Was he high, or was he just <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130911034022/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXp96Um-TAs">&apos;avin a laff</a>?</p>

<p>We&apos;re pretty sure he was just &apos;avin a laff&#x2014;he even <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130911034022/http://instagram.com/p/d-5ktOpY1P/">Instagrammed an appropriately dopey pic</a> from the broadcast later to show how self-aware he was about it. And it there was <em>some</em> logic to his appearance: the new single will be featured on &#x201C;Saturday Night Football&#x201D; in future weeks. </p>

<p>But his strategy to drum up some attention&#x2014;staring dead-eyed slightly off-screen, barely answering any questions, embracing awkward silence, and complimenting announcer Brent Musburger&#x2014;worked just as he intended. People were concerned that he was ill, or stoned, or on bad molly. &quot;The broadcasters chuckled. The men shook hands. And then America wondered what just happened,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130911034022/http://nypost.com/2013/09/08/eminem-makes-bizarre-appearance-on-espn/">the Post wrote</a> while huddled in a corner rocking back and forth. </p>
