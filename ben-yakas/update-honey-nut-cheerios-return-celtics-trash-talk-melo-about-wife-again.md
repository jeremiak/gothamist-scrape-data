<p><strong>[Update Below]</strong> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140301085040/http://gothamist.com/tags/knicks">The Knicks</a> showed up to Madison Square Garden dressed for a funeral last night, but they ended up being the ones carted out of the Garden in terrible shape after a 92-86 loss forced a game 6 in Boston on Friday. As if that weren&apos;t bad enough, the ghost of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140301085040/http://gothamist.com/tags/honeynutcheerios">Honey Nut Cheerios</a> was invoked by Celtics benchwarmer Jordan Crawford at the end of the game, when he got in Carmelo Anthony&apos;s face and said what appeared to be: &quot;that motherfucker fucked your wife.&quot; Check out the video below.</p>

<p>In case <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140301085040/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/09/carmelo_anthony_lost_cool_when_kevi.php">you&apos;ve somehow forgotten the context</a>, trash talking extraordinaire Kevin Garnett got in Melo&apos;s face during a Knicks/Celtics game back in January, reportedly saying to him, &#x201C;Your...wife tastes like Honey Nut Cheerios.&#x201D; Anthony, who was separated from wife LaLa Vasquez at the time, then stood outside the Celtics bus waiting for him after the game. It ended up providing good fodder <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140301085040/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/11/video_stephen_colbert_heartily_appr.php">for Stephen Colbert</a>.</p>

<p>Melo resisted the urge to fight back this time, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140301085040/http://bostonherald.com/sports/celtics_nba/boston_celtics/2013/05/celtics_notebook_jordan_crawford_not_in_a_melo_mood">saying after last night&apos;s game</a>, &#x201C;I&#x2019;m not thinking about no Jordan Crawford. Not at this point in time. I&#x2019;ll tell you that. <strong>I don&#x2019;t even think he deserves for you to be typing right now.</strong>&#x201D; Considering Crawford didn&apos;t even get to the enter last night&apos;s game, he may have a point. Raymond Felton added that it was &quot;just some words. That&apos;s the game of basketball; it happens. You get in the playoffs, it gets intense sometimes. Just words, nothing serious.&quot; </p>

<p>Oddly, Crawford denied that he was there at the time of the incident, even though he clearly was. &#x201C;Not me. You&#x2019;d better go talk to someone who was there,&#x201D; he said. Suffice to say, hopefully the Knicks can channel some of this frustration into game 6 and end this series and not become another NYC footnote to history.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> LaLa Vasquez has responded to the alleged insults by posting <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140301085040/http://instagram.com/p/Y0QM3-xjT5/">the below instagram</a> with this incredibly pointed rejoinder: <strong>&quot;Try again. You on the bench for a reason.&quot;</strong></p>
