<p>A Long Island bus driver has been arrested and accused of breaking a five-year-old autistic boy&apos;s arm. Police say that Richard Mason, 39, allegedly grabbed Connor Shirangi&#x2019;s arm and twisted it behind his back while trying to discipline the boy on Monday. Connor&#x2019;s mother, Desiree Johnston-Shirangi, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131007091714/http://pix11.com/2013/10/03/long-island-school-bus-attendant-accused-of-breaking-special-needs-childs-arm/#axzz2gcjaMbTv">told PIX11 that</a> doctors believe Connor&apos;s injuries were consistent with being tied down and having his airway restricted. &#x201C;<strong>My son was going through this and the fear that he had to the point that he urinated in his pants and I wasn&#x2019;t there,</strong>&#x201D; Johnston-Shirangi said.</p>

<p>Johnston-Shirangi added that Mason initially told her that her son injured his arm by punching a window, and that he told the other children on the bus not to tell their parents what happened. &#x201C;Connor was swinging his feet and kicking the seat of the bus and Mr. Mason apparently got upset and handled him the way you wouldn&#x2019;t handle anybody,&#x201D; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131007091714/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2013/10/03/l-i-school-bus-attendant-accused-of-breaking-5-year-old-autistic-boys-arm/">she told CBS</a>. &#x201C;From what the doctors are saying, he used excessive force on my child.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Mason <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131007091714/http://longisland.news12.com/news/bus-aide-richard-mason-accused-of-assaulting-5-year-old-boy-with-autism-1.6187912">told News 12 Long Island</a> that that boy was &#x201C;pounding his hand against the window and to prevent the window from shattering, I blocked him.&quot; Many commenters on that story came to Mason&apos;s defense, including Melanie Donus, a mother of an autistic child who says she knows Mason very well:</p>

<blockquote>I happen to know richard very well...my 5 year old non verbal child with autism was on that bus. Richard has been good to us and Maxx loved him! There were 2 brothers fighting on the bus and he was trying to break it up. My heart goes out to the parents as i can imagine how they feel, however I am waiting to hear more details of the investigation before i form an opinion. I think that the word discipline may have confused the community.</blockquote>

<p>Mason&#x2019;s niece defended her uncle in court yesterday: &#x201C;He&#x2019;s not that kind of person. He wouldn&#x2019;t do something like this,&#x201D; the niece, Anisha Fluellen, said. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m so frustrated at this situation.&#x201D; Fluellen ended up in a heated confrontation with Johnston-Shirangi, who told her, &quot;I hope he gets the help he needs.&#x201D;</p>
