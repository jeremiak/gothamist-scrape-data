<p>&quot;The Trump administration has dealt with a series of internal and foreign crises, the national security adviser has resigned just 24 days into Trump&apos;s presidency, and defense officials from both parties are freaking out&#x2014;how could things possibly get any crazier?&quot; Seth Meyers asked last night before tackling the latest news that Trump campaign officials were in frequent contact with Russian officials before the election. &quot;This administration is like a really intense haunted house, where every door you think is an exit is just a door to an even scarier room,&quot; Meyers continued. &quot;How do I get out of this fucking place? I wet my pants three rooms ago!&quot;</p>

<p>Watch below as Meyers dissects the ways in which the White House has turned into another episode of <em>The Apprentice</em>, and deconstructs Trump&apos;s assurances that he would &quot;win so much you may even get tired of winning.&quot; As Meyers put it, &quot;No one gets tired of winning. It&apos;s never happened. If anyone did, it would be DJ Khaled. All he does is win and he doesn&apos;t seem tired in the least.&quot;</p>

<p>Stephen Colbert kicked off The Late Show with the news that Andrew Puzder, &quot;the suburban dentist you meet at the swingers party,&quot; had withdrawn his nomination from becoming Trump&apos;s labor secretary, then dove into all the latest Russian news: &quot;We just learned from multiple intelligence sources that Trump aides were &apos;in constant touch&apos; with senior Russian officials during the campaign,&quot; he said. &quot;&apos;Constant Touch&apos; by the way is also Trump&apos;s Secret Service code name.&quot; </p>

<p>Colbert also had a <em>Usual Suspects</em> parody about Trump&apos;s collusion with Russia.</p>
