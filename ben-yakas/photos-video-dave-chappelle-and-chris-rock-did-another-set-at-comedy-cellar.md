</div></div>					<p>It wasn&apos;t enough that Dave Chappelle and Chris Rock <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424160436/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/27/dave_chappelle_and_chris_rock_perfo.php">did one surprise night</a> at the Comedy Cellar together&#x2014;they returned last night, and brought famous friends including Kevn Hart (this week&apos;s SNL host), Marlon Wayans, Bill Bellamy, and Questlove along for the ride. Questlove in particular was insanely happy about it, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424160436/http://instagram.com/questlove/">posting the photos above</a> along with a long description of the evening, which he said turned into &quot;a mini roast/dozens/lovefest.&quot; Check out some video from the show below, plus Questlove&apos;s whole account.</p>

<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424160436if_/http://www.youtube.com/embed/jgK1iiQcEbM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>Here&apos;s what Hart <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424160436/http://instagram.com/p/WSPwtkiYv-/">tweeted about it</a>: &quot;Last night was EPIC...Dave Chappell, Chris Rock, Marlon Wayons, Bell Belamy &amp; Myself all graced the stage together at the Comedy Cellar WOOOW #ComedicHistory&quot; And here&apos;s Questlove&apos;s description:</p>

<blockquote>I once sat in on drums with Prince on bass, Sheila E on percussion, Frank Mcomb on keys, Rachelle Ferrell on vocals doing Stevie Wonder&apos;s catalogue (who incidentally was also sitting in....with Joni Mitchell &amp; Selma Hayek as our audience) and I *think* I might have felt as high as I did tonight. 

<p>I was working on the other side of the world when suddenly I got a &quot;get yo arse down here NOW!!!!!&quot; text. Sure enough I made it just in time to see the best night ever at the comedy cellar: Hannibal was on 1st, then Chapelle did an amazing off the top bit about what life will be like in a South African jail with prosthetic legs...and the pope quitting his career too. &amp; then the floodgates opened: Hart riffed on Spilling drinks on Hov then everyone got in a cipher doing a mini roast/dozens/lovefest about each other. It was honest to god like watching the comic version of &quot;scenario&quot; or &quot;the symphony&quot; jokes and punchlines were flying fast. Stories of way back when was told. And I had the best seat in the house (Dave told me to play piano....but I took the bench just to get a good view) amazing night watching #themaster5 </p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>So here&apos;s the question for you comedy fans: is it worth heading to Comedy Cellar tonight <em>just in case</em> lightning strikes three times?</p>
