And now, you too can own one of these immobile treats!<p></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509222317/http://www.streetsblog.org/2010/06/15/want-the-best-deal-on-parking-get-yourself-a-police-surgeon-placard/#more-229771">Streetsblog</a> takes you through the steps: if you&apos;re an MD, which covers podiatrists, chaplains, dentists, acupuncturists and lawyers, among others, you can send a copy of your medical license, diploma, resume, and a $250 check to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509222317/http://amtrakpolicesurgeon.com/doc.html">Amtrak Police Lodge #189</a>, an affiliate of the Fraternal Order of Police based in Maple Shade, New Jersey. You also agree to treat members of the lodge. They&apos;ll designate you an &quot;Amtrak Police Surgeon&quot; and send along an &quot;unofficial&quot; parking placard that looks suspiciously like an official document. </p>

<p>If you don&apos;t want to become an Amtrak police surgeon, you could become a member of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509222317/http://nyspia-surgeondivision.org/member.html">Surgeon Division</a> of the New York State Police Investigator Association, a local of the International Union of Police Associations, which has the same requirements. The Police Investigator Association&apos;s Jim O&apos;Connor explained his view of the placards: <strong>&quot;It&apos;s just a courtesy placard, it doesn&apos;t give you any specific rights.&quot;</strong> Both programs are administered by Dr. Sheldon Werner of Wappingers Falls, New York, so a third step might be to befriend the hell out of him. </p>
