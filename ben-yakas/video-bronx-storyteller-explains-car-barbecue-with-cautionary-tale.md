<p>Newark had Phillip Roth; Brooklyn had Walt Whitman; and the Bronx now has the gentleman in the video below, who weaves a cautionary tale about what happens if your lady catches you doing the &quot;doo doo doo...doo doodoo doodoo doo <em>doo</em> doo doo&quot; with another woman. Or as he puts it: &quot;This is what goes down when you go out on your girl&#x2014;she comes and burns up your car!&quot; Like that old saying goes, don&apos;t play with fire if you can&apos;t take the heat from the subsequent carbecue (no not <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604133029/http://www.thecarbeque.com/">carbeque</a>). </p>
