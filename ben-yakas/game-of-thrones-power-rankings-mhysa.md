<p>Last week on <em>Game Of Thrones</em>, our minds were blown <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428172104/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/03/game_of_thrones_power_rankings_rain.php">by the dread Red Wedding</a>. This week, Jon and Ygritte had a painful break up, Arya vented a bit, and Daenerys moshed. Since the show is all about how people jockey for power, we&apos;ve decided to follow along this season with our <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428172104/http://gothamist.com/tags/gameofthronespowerrankings">Game of Thrones Power Rankings</a>&#x2014;aka, who is owning this week.</p>

<p><strong>Game Of Thrones Power Rankings, Week 10:</strong></p>

<p><strong>1. Daenerys Targaryen</strong>: She ends the season in a pretty good place, greeted as a liberator by the former slaves of Yunkai. Also got to recreate the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428172104/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxKWTzr-k6s">&quot;Even Flow&quot; music video</a> as our closing shot of the season.</p>

<p><strong>2. Tywin Lannister</strong>: As we expected, Tywin orchestrated the whole Red Wedding coup. And then he told Tyrion how not killing him as a baby was his greatest personal sacrifice. Ice cold.</p>

<p><strong>3. Roose Bolton/Walder Frey</strong>: Oh, you fellas want to twirl your moustaches a bit longer? At least until all those Stark bloodstains are removed? Proceed.</p>

<p><strong>4. Joffrey Baratheon</strong>: Got sent to his room without supper after he dared to stand up to his grandfather. At least he didn&apos;t kill any puppies!</p>

<p><strong>5. Stannis Baratheon</strong>: He&apos;s still kind of a drip, but he has renewed purpose after he learns of the danger of the White Walkers. He may turn out to be a hero yet (an incredibly serious, dutiful, drippy hero).</p>

<p><strong>6. Ser Davos</strong>: After learning to read, saving Gendry, and standing up to Melisandre, he has now ascended to the mantle of &apos;most decent man in Westeros.&apos;</p>

<p><strong>7. Cersei Lannister</strong>: We learned this week that she was once happy, and even Joffrey can&apos;t take that away from her. But maybe she&apos;ll be a little happier now that her brother-lover is back. Probably not, but still.</p>

<p><strong>8. Melisandre</strong>: For the last two seasons, it was all shadow babies and killing your enemies and sacrificing innocents to the Lord of Light...and now the War of the Five Kings doesn&apos;t matter? </p>

<p><strong>9. Tyrion Lannister</strong>: Training Podrick Payne to become a better drinker is probably a more fruitful endeavor than trying to get Sansa not to hate him at this point.</p>

<p><strong>10. Bran Stark</strong>: Hung out with Jon Snow&apos;s soulmate Samwell without getting annoyed at him, and magically dropped his voice a few decibels. What can&apos;t this kid do!</p>

<p><strong>11. Hodor</strong>: The best moment of last night&apos;s episode was Hodor blushing when he realized someone had heard of him. </p>

<p><strong>12. Jon Snow</strong>: Breaking up is hard to do, especially when you have three arrows in your back. Ygritte is a romantic, isn&apos;t she.</p>

<p><strong>13. Arya Stark</strong>: Con: seeing your brother&apos;s body with his direwolf&apos;s head. Pro: stabbing the shit out of some rank-and-file soldier.</p>

<p><strong>14. Jaime Lannister</strong>: And the Kingslayer returns home a broken, bearded, handless man. But at least he gets a reunion with his sister-lover filled with meaningful shuffling and pained eye contact.</p>

<p><strong>15. Sansa Stark</strong>: Damnit. Just when things were going so well with Tyrion and the dung revenge plots, she finds out about her family...</p>

<p><strong>16. Samwell Tarly</strong>: We owe young Samwell an apology for getting so angry with him after he left the Dragonglass that killed the first White Walker <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428172104/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/20/game_of_thrones_power_rankings_seco.php">in &quot;Second Sons&quot;</a> behind in the snow. We didn&apos;t realize he had plenty more of them. But really, isn&apos;t it Samwell&apos;s fault we didn&apos;t know that? It&apos;s always Samwell&apos;s fault. </p>

<p><strong>The Viserys Targeryen Memorial Least Power Person Of The Week Award</strong>: <em><strike>Theon Greyjoy</strike> Reek</em>&#x2014;After a season of tedious psychological and physical torture at the hands of the literal and figurative bastard Ramsay Snow, Theon&apos;s transformation into Reek seems...reasonable. It just sucks that he had to become <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428172104/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhwbxEfy7fg">an SNL sketch</a> for that to happen.</p>

<p><strong>Rickon Watch 2013: Did Rickon Do Anything?</strong> He and Osha are off on their own adventures now. After last week&apos;s emotional outing&#x2014;in which he got a few actual lines&#x2014;we can&apos;t blame Rickon for taking a well-deserved rest. It&apos;s exhausting having dialogue. </p>

<p><strong>Not Applicable</strong>: Since this was the season finale, we had a chance to check in with a lot of characters, wrapping up some storylines (Yunkai, Jaime/Brienne&apos;s journey) and starting new ones (Stannis and The Wall, The Iron Islands attempt to rescue Theon). Nevertheless, we didn&apos;t have time to see everybody: the Brotherhood Without Banners; Littlefinger; the whole Tyrell clan; and of course, the little-seen Mance Rayder. </p>

<p>This wraps up possibly the best season of <em>Game Of Thrones</em> yet. Until next season, let&apos;s revisit the world&apos;s worst bedtime story ever:</p>
