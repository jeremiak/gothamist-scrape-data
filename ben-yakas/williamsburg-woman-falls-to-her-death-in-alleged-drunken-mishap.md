<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231232504/http://nypost.com/2014/04/04/drunk-woman-falls-to-death-in-williamsburg/">According to the Post</a>, Shaw had gotten into a fight with her boyfriend Alex Douglas, 42, at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231232504/http://gothamist.com/tags/luckydog">Lucky Dog</a>. The dispute reportedly culminated in Douglas locking Shaw out of his Kent Avenue apartment. While Douglas was inside with friends, sources tell the Post that Shaw climbed a fire escape ladder to his fourth floor window in an attempt to get in, only to find it was locked. She then allegedly lost her footing and fell.</p>

<p>&quot;She was drinking with her boyfriend all night,&quot; a source told the tabloid. &quot;He locked her out. She went up to the roof and fell off.&quot; No charges have been filed, and police say the investigation is ongoing.</p>
