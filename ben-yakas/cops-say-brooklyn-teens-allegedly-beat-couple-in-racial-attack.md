<p>Cops say that a white couple was brutally beaten by a gang of Brooklyn teens last week in what they are characterizing as a racial assault. During the confrontation, victim Ronald Russo claims the teens beat him on the pavement, and yanked his wife by the hair while shouting things like, &#x201C;Get those crackers!&#x201D; and &#x201C;Get that white whore!&#x201D;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203064604/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/brooklyn-youths-attack-couple-racial-attack-cops-article-1.1490901">According to the News</a>, the attack occurred around 7 p.m. Monday as a group of 10 black teens were crossing Avenue U at E. 58th Street near Kings Plaza Shopping Center in Mill Basin. Driver Russo and his wife Alanna, both 30, apparently honked at the teens to move because they had a green light, and the kids started kicking the car. </p>

<p>When Russo got out to inspect the damage, the teens allegedly dragged him to the ground punching and kicking him. He suffered a fractured nose, a broken septum, a blood clot and abrasions to his shoulder. Meanwhile, his wife says her head was slammed into the ground by a 12-year-old girl who pulled on her hair. She suffered a black eye, bleeding and difficulty breathing.</p>

<p>Four teens have been arrested so far for the incident. Kashawn Kirton, 18, has been charged with gang assault, harassment and menacing charges, all as hate crimes. Daehrell Finch, 17, has been charged with gang assault, assault, menacing and harassment but does not face hate-crime charges.Two more teens, a 12-year-old girl and a 14-year-old boy, have also been arrested, but their names have not been released.</p>

<p>Kirton, who is a freshman at St. Francis College, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203064604/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/brooklyn-youths-attack-couple-racial-attack-cops-article-1.1490901">told the News</a> that he had nothing to do with the attack, and was inside a Lowe&apos;s store when it occurred: &#x201C;I have relatives who are white. Cousins and stuff,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;My school is mainly white. More than half my friends are white. I wouldn&#x2019;t use words like that.&#x201D; He added that he believes he was arrested because he was wearing the same outfit as one of the assailants.</p>
