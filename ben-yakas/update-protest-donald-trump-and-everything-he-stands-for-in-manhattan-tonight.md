<p>The election is over and the wrong person won, but the voices of the oppressed, the disenfranchised, the horrified and the devastated will not be silenced. There are pro-women, pro-immigrant, and pro-humanity groups <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161128144954/http://jezebel.com/a-list-of-pro-women-pro-immigrant-pro-earth-anti-big-1788752078">you can donate to now.</a> And you can join your fellow New Yorkers in the streets of Manhattan tonight to give Donald Trump, and people who ascribe to his hate-and-fear driven worldview, a piece of your mind.</p>
