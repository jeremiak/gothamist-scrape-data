<p>A Manhattan dad flying back to NYC with his 12-year-old son has been accused of groping a sleeping female passenger last year. According to recently unsealed documents <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604104735/http://www.thesmokinggun.com/documents/assault-on-jetblue-flight-578312">obtained by The Smoking Gun</a>, Upper East Sider Brett Zorse, 50, put his hand under the skirt of the woman on a JetBlue flight last April from San Francisco to JFK. The 32-year-old woman said he offered up this defense at the time: &#x201C;It&#x2019;s not like I molested you. It&#x2019;s not like I stuck my finger in your pussy or grabbed your tits.&#x201D; </p>

<p>Zorse followed up that statement by noting, &#x201C;I wouldn&#x2019;t mind a massage right now.&#x201D; Zorse was sitting in between his 12-year-old and the woman, who was on the aisle. The woman told investigators that Zorse&#x2019;s &#x201C;conversations throughout the flight all turned to a sexual nature&#x201D; and that he was very &#x201C;touchy feely.&quot; At one point during the flight, when the woman offered to get something from the overhead compartment for Zorse so he wouldn&apos;t have to reach over her, he said, &#x201C;I&#x2019;d really like to climb all over you.&#x201D;  </p>

<p>Zorse has been charged with simple assault and faces up to six months in jail if convicted of the misdemeanor. Zorse told investigators that he thought the woman was &#x201C;flirting with him,&#x201D; and claimed that she told him that &#x201C;he was attractive and he was a good father.&#x201D; He also admitted placing his hand on the woman&#x2019;s leg for &#x201C;approximately 30 seconds.&quot; We&apos;re just a bit surprised he didn&apos;t <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604104735/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/10/man_who_groped_flight_attendant_my.php">blame it on blood sugar</a>, or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604104735/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/04/photo_one_way_to_deal_with_unruly_a.php">temporary insanity.</a></p>
