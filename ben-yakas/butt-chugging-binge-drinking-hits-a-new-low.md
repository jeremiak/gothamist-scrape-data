<p>First kids got wasted off of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430034903/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/27/vodka_eyeballing_trend_jumps_the_po.php">Vodka Eyeballing</a>, then they chugged <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430034903/http://gothamist.com/tags/fourloko">Four Lokos</a>, and along the way they injected themselves with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430034903/http://gothamist.com/2010/10/06/new_trend_alert_spaghetti_tacos.php">Spaghetti Tacos</a>&#x2014;and now comes the latest iteration of those disgusting ways to get yourself wasted in the most awkward manner possible: butt chugging! For when your mouth just isn&apos;t fast enough! </p>

<p>Butt chugging <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430034903/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/bottoms-university-tennessee-student-hospitalized-alcohol-enema-kills-article-1.1168506">is in the news</a> because a 20-year-old University of Tennessee student was rushed to the hospital with alcohol poisoning after he and his fellow frat members had allegedly conducted &#x201C;alcohol enemas.&quot; That involved them pouring wine through a rubber tube inserted into their rectums. &#x201C;The abundance of capillaries and blood vessels [in the rectum] greatly heightens the level and speed of the alcohol entering the blood stream as it bypasses the filtering by the liver,&#x201D; police spokesman Darrell DeBusk said in a statement.</p>

<p>Alexander Broughton&apos;s blood alcohol level was &quot;well over&quot; 0.40 percent when he was brought to the hospital. His frat, Pi Kappa Alpha, has been suspended for 30 days while the incident is investigated: &#x201C;Although these activities are isolated to a small group of individuals, the Fraternity recognizes that this is an opportunity to increase the public&#x2019;s awareness of what appears to be an unfortunate and extremely dangerous practice by some young people today,&#x201D; they <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430034903/http://wreg.com/2012/09/25/parents-concerned-over-dangerous-drinking-trends/">said in a statement.</a></p>

<p>In the wake of the press furor over butt chugging, Broughton&apos;s father, Mark Broughton, claims law enforcement&apos;s characterization of the incident <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430034903/http://www.wptv.com/dpp/news/national/alcohol-enema-butt-chugging-father-of-university-of-tennessee-fraternity-member-denies-claims">has been overblown</a>: &quot;The incident as reported is not true in its entirety,&quot; he said. &quot;There is significantly erroneous information out there and it has come from the Knoxville Police Department.&quot; He&apos;s not denying that SOME sort of butt chugging occurred though: &quot;I&apos;m not saying the entire story is false &#x2014; it&apos;s not. But portions of it were significantly erroneous.&quot; </p>

<p>We took a glance at YouTube to get a better idea of this butt chugging phenomenon (which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430034903/http://gawker.com/5528131/butt+chugging-what-is-it-and-whos-doing-it">has been whispering about</a> across the internet for some time now), and it ain&apos;t pretty. Go ahead and watch the videos below (mostly SFW) if you want the visceral experience. Watching these videos, one realizes it&apos;s only a matter of time before some kid takes shoving alcohol up their butt to the next level, and tries smoking crack cocaine through their anus.</p>

<p>But hey, at least it amused Anderson Cooper!</p>
