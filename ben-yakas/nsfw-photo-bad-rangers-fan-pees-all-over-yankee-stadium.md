<p>Last night, the Rangers played their second of two games <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407150723/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/22/watch_yankee_stadium_get_transforme.php">at Yankee Stadium</a> as part of the NHL&apos;s new Stadium Series. The Rangers beat both the Devils and Islanders this week to dominate at The House Across The Street From The House That Ruth Built. </p>

<p>The whole event was a wild success for the NHL, with two minor exceptions: Cee-Lo was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407150723/http://www.cbssports.com/nhl/eye-on-hockey/24424866/photo-ceelo-green-gives-fans-at-yankee-stadium-the-double-bird">handing out middle fingers</a> like they were going out of style, and the gentleman above decided to relieve his bladder in the middle of the stadium in front of strangers. </p>

<p>Is this the feeling Macklemore and Ryan Lewis were singing about during their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407150723/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/18/everything_about_that_macklemore_su.php">fake surprise NYC bus ride</a>? Is this what REO Speedwagon has been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407150723/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd4j1Ms1VYE">trying to tell us</a> all these years? Did he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407150723/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/28/memorable_photo_sleepy_man_hangs_br.php">lose his safety partner</a> while riding to the stadium and panic?</p>

<p>Below, you can see the picture in its full unashamed, untouched, and undignified form. </p>

<p>LAST CHANCE TO CLICK AWAY before you see that which cannot be unseen:</p>
