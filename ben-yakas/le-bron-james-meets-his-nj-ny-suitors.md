</div></div><p>At the stroke of midnight Thursday, the LeBron James <strike>sweepstakes</strike> sweep-him-off-his-feet-stakes began in earnest, after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602122032/http://gothamist.com/2008/11/21/the_knicks_look_to_the_future.php">years of preparation</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602122032/http://gothamist.com/2010/06/30/the_end_is_nigh_lebrons_decision_lo.php">months of speculation</a>, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602122032/http://gothamist.com/2010/06/30/empathic_billionaires_and_real_esta.php">weeks</a> of celebrity <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602122032/http://gothamist.com/2010/06/15/lebron_recruitment_attemts_will_nev.php">recruitment videos</a>. The Nets and Knicks got to make the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602122032/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/02/sports/basketball/02nba.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">first pitches</a> to LeBron, with back-to-back meetings in Cleveland, Ohio on Thursday. And Knicks Coach Mike D&apos;Antoni sounded peppy and &quot;cautiously optimistic&quot; afterward, saying, <strong>&#x201C;We tried to put him in a New York state of mind.&#x201D;</strong> </p>

<p>But despite that cautious optimism, there are still four more strong teams that will be pitching LeBron&#x2014;Miami, Cleveland, Chicago and LA. And despite all the basketball courts in Harlem <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602122032/http://origin.ny1.com/content/top_stories/121463/lebron-fans-make-full-court-press-in-harlem">engraved with his likeness in a Knicks uniform</a>, the Knicks have a decidedly weaker sales pitch than the other squads, much of which is their own fault, as the Times <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602122032/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/02/sports/basketball/02lebron.html?_r=1&amp;partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">points out</a>: &quot;The difference is that they have managed to position themselves as the most desperate of James supplicants based on who they are, how bad they&#x2019;ve become, how much they&#x2019;ve promised and how little they will have to offer their fan base if Plans A and B do not work out.&quot;</p>

<p>The Nets&apos; new coach Avery Johnson only said, &quot;The meeting went very well,&quot; but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602122032/http://www.nj.com/nets/index.ssf/2010/07/nets_definitely_in_the_game_as.html">according to the Star-Ledger</a>, Nets officials believe their pitch would be hard to follow: </p><blockquote>[James] listened attentively to [Nets owner Russian billionaire Mikhail] Prokhorov and [Onexim CEO Dmitry] Razumov as they explained how they will expand his profile on a global scale. He heard [outgoing Nets president] Thorn and Johnson share their plan for building a championship-caliber roster with a long shelf life. He was given an evocative demonstration by [Nets CEO Brett] Yormark about how he could become not only King of Brooklyn, but of all of New York. <p></p>

<p>And then, according to reporters at the scene, Jay-Z stayed behind to reinforce the Nets&#x2019; bullet points and get a feel for how his 25-year-old prot&#xE9;g&#xE9; reacted to the presentation.</p>

<p>It didn&#x2019;t take long to discern that James was blown away. </p>

<p>According to one Nets official, James also gave them a candid warning that the team should prepare to have enough room under the salary cap to afford two maximum-value contracts should he decide that New Jersey is his next destination. </p></blockquote><p></p>
