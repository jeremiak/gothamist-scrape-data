<p>Two 15-year-old girls have been arrested for allegedly mugging a series of people in northern Manhattan with scissors. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150409202401/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20140607/washington-heights/scissors-wielding-teen-girls-arrested-for-muggings-uptown-park">DNAInfo reports</a> that the teens were part of a crew with two boys who threatened to stab people with scissors if they didn&apos;t hand over their wallets and phones. </p>

<p>The teens allegedly pulled scissors on a 47-year-old man near the Fort Tryon Park playground just around 2 p.m. on June 2nd. The teens demanded his iPhone, and the man picked up a stick to try to defend himself, causing the teens to scatter. Soon after that incident, the girls allegedly put a 24-year-old woman in a chokehold while their accomplices stole her makeup, keys, and wallet with $450 inside of it. </p>

<p>The girls were arrested soon after, while the two teen boys got away. Cops say in addition to those two incidents, the teen girls are believed to have pulled scissors on at least three other victims the week before. Their names have not been released, and they have been charged with first-degree robbery. </p>
