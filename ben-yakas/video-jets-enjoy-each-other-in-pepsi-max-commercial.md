<p>The woefully underperforming Jets and Giants have spent all week <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120103110920/http://espn.go.com/new-york/nfl/story/_/id/7377245/talk-cheap-new-york-giants-new-york-jets-plenty-say">trash talking</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120103110920/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/19/rex_ryan_still_wants_to_take_over_n.php">each other</a> in anticipation of their Christmas Eve battle of mediocrity. We expect it to go the way Harry Caul put it in <em>The Conversation</em>: &quot;One side&#x2019;s just losing faster than the other.&#x201D; But the Jets aren&apos;t just a football team anymore&#x2014;they <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120103110920/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/24/video_sanchez_wipes_nose_contents_o.php">wipe each others boogers</a>, they go <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120103110920/http://gothamist.com/2010/08/23/mark_sanchez_stud_or_dork.php">to Broadway shows</a>, and now, they star in Pepsi Max commercials together.</p>

<p>It&apos;s not all that surprising that the <strike>team</strike> &quot;special group of people&quot; would end up in this position&#x2014;they are led by &quot;fish out of water&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120103110920/http://gothamist.com/tags/rexryan">Rex Ryan</a>, the breakout star of <em>Hard Knocks</em>, <em>CSI</em>, and next year&apos;s Adam Sandler comedy <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120103110920/http://deadspin.com/5856553/rex-ryan-to-appear-as-patriots-fan-in-adam-sandler-movie-also-starring-vanilla-ice-susan-sarandon"><em>I Hate You, Dad</em></a>. The 30-second spot entitled &quot;Locker Room&quot; will air nationally during Saturday&apos;s Jets-Giants game, and then will plaster your TV screen with Gang Green in January.</p>

<p>We think it&apos;s great that Ryan and his merry group have stayed plenty busy with side projects, lest this whole football thing doesn&apos;t work out. We can&apos;t wait till Bart Scott&apos;s affordable line of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120103110920/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/05/bart_scott_trademarks_his_catchphra.php">&quot;Can&apos;t Wait&quot;</a> crockery comes out! It&apos;s just too bad that none of this will bring any comfort <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120103110920/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/18/video_6-year-old_realizes_its_very.php">to the Jets biggest fans.</a></p>
