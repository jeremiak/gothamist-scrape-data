<p>Most things in this life are too good to be true, whether it&apos;s an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429152156/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/04/03/beyonce-intern_n_5083235.html">internship with Beyonce</a>, a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429152156/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/17/brooklyn_man_giving_away_his_giant.php">human-sized hamster wheel</a>, or the concept of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429152156/http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=True%20Love&amp;defid=2145413">true love</a>. At this point, we don&apos;t really trust anyone, especially someone who offers things for free on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429152156/http://gothamist.com/tags/craigslist">Craigslist.</a> <em>Having said that,</em> we can&apos;t just ignore it when a person <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429152156/http://newyork.craigslist.org/mnh/zip/4406934895.html">claims that they are giving away</a> <strong>hundreds of pi&#xF1;atas</strong>, now can we? </p>

<p>You can read the full Craigslist blurb below, in which the person claims they have three rooms full of empty pi&#xF1;atas in Manhattan, just waiting for you to fill them with candy, and then gorge yourself into a sugar-induced coma: </p>

<blockquote>Commercial tenant has moved out leaving 3 rooms full of new unused Pinatas. Various shapes, sizes, and themes. Big, small, traditional, spongbob squarepants all that shit.

<p>Pinatas are empty and In good new condition. I need them gone by Saturday afternoon when new tenant will begin moving in stuff and do not want to pay for a dumpster. Come and take as many as you possibly can.</p>

<p>Please contact my assistant Tina for the address in Midtown. Serious inquiries Only. <strong>I&apos;m not trying to get shot by wackos on the internet over fucking Pinatas</strong>.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>That last line should be on the masthead of The Internet. </p>

<p>We&apos;ll update if/when we hear back from Tina, who we&apos;ve called several times for more information. </p>

<p>Even if you don&apos;t get through to Tina&#x2014;even if this turns out to be another irritating and utterly pointless viral hoax&#x2014;maybe we should all use this as an opportunity to re-evaluate our lives and throw more pi&#xF1;ata parties. </p>
