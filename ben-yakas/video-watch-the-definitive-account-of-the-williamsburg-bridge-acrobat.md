<p>This past July, acrobat Seanna Sharpe and magician Thomas &quot;Savage&quot; Skinner <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150904003853/http://gothamist.com/2011/07/12/acrobats_pull_incredible_stunt_on_t.php#photo-1">left people in awe</a> as they performed a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150904003853/http://gothamist.com/2011/07/11/right_now_acrobat.php">dangerous stunt</a> atop the Williamsburg Bridge dubbed &quot;Risk Life For Flight.&quot; The two were promptly arrested and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150904003853/http://gothamist.com/2011/07/14/williamsburg_bridge_acrobat_charged.php">charged with</a> felony reckless endangerment, which carried up to a seven year prison sentence. Now, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150904003853/http://all.ronenv.com/post/12969423008">artist RonenV</a> has assembled footage from onlookers and the performers (including a never-before seen camera angle from 285 feet over the train traffic) to create the definitive account of their incredible act that day. Watch it below:</p>

<p>The video concludes with a fitting post-script&#x2014;initially, the two were charged with reckless endangerment, a class A felony, and used <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150904003853/http://gothamist.com/2011/07/16/williamsburg_bridge_acrobats_invoke.php">the Philippe Petit defense</a>, based on the man who walked between the twin towers in 1974 and had his charges dropped, as precedent for their stunt. According to the video, they were given a standing ovation at Rikers, their bail money was raised on Twitter in under an hour, charges were reduced to a misdemeanor, and they were given a plea deal: five free performances for children.</p>
