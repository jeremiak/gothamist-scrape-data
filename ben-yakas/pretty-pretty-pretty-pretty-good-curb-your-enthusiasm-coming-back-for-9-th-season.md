<p>America finally is great again, and it had nothing to do with Presidential YouTube Commenter Donald Trump: HBO announced today that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171026014535/http://gothamist.com/tags/larrydavid">Larry David</a> is bringing back the funniest show on television, <em>Curb Your Enthusiasm</em>, for a ninth season. This is huge! This is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171026014535/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zret7O8YoU">gigantic</a>!</p>

<p>It&apos;s been five years since season eight of <em>Curb</em>, in which Larry learned to love Palestinian chicken, gained fame as a subway hero, became frenemies with Michael J Fox, and was officially kicked out of NYC by then-Mayor Bloomberg. The season ended with Larry and Leon (JB Smoove) in Paris.</p>

<p>Since then, David has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171026014535/http://gothamist.com/2014/08/07/larry_david_broadway.php">starred in a Broadway play</a> he wrote about sitting shiva (<em>Fish In The Dark</em>), written and starred in an HBO movie about electric cars and the band Chicago (<em>Clear History</em>), and repeatedly said he had little interest in reviving <em>Curb</em>. &quot;I guess the odds would be against it. I guess, right now, the odds would be against it, probably 6 to 1,&quot; he said <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171026014535/http://gothamist.com/2014/12/17/larry_david_seinfeld_finale.php">during an interview</a> in December 2014.</p>

<p>But perhaps spending the last year <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171026014535/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/18/video_larry_david_is_bernie_sanders.php">inhabiting Bernie Sanders&apos; soul</a> as a frequent part-time player <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171026014535/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/07/larry_david_snl_pretty_pretty_good.php">at SNL</a>, and the overwhelming praise it brought, was the thing that finally inspired him to start working on it again. Or maybe it was all that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171026014535/http://gothamist.com/2015/01/16/video_larry_david_is_all_about_that.php">hot hotel sex</a>.</p>

<p>Here&apos;s the full HBO announcement:</p><blockquote>The Emmy&#xAE;- and Golden Globe-winning comedy series CURB YOUR ENTHUSIASM, starring Larry David, will return to HBO for its ninth season, it was announced today by Casey Bloys, president, HBO programming. Details of the new season will be announced as they are confirmed.<p></p>

<p>&#x201C;We&#x2019;re thrilled that Larry has decided to do a new season of CURB and can&#x2019;t wait to see what he has planned,&#x201D; said Bloys.</p>

<p>Asked why he decided to come back, David said, &#x201C;In the immortal words of Julius Caesar, &#x2018;I left, I did nothing, I returned.&#x2019;&#x201D;</p>

<p>CURB YOUR ENTHUSIASM stars &#x201C;Seinfeld&#x201D; co-creator David as an over-the-top version of himself in an unsparing but tongue-in-cheek depiction of his life. With 80 episodes to date, the show is HBO&#x2019;s longest-running scripted comedy or drama series. David also starred in and co-wrote the 2013 HBO Films presentation &#x201C;Clear History.&#x201D;</p></blockquote><p></p>
