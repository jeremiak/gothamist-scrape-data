<p>A man in a wheelchair was fatally struck by a train in the Bronx last night. According to police, Ronald Paige, 66, was struck by a northbound 2 train around 8:50 p.m. Saturday at the Intervale Avenue station at Intervale and Westchester Avenues. Cops say he &quot;rolled himself into the oncoming train.&quot;</p>

<p>Paige was taken to Bronx Lebanon Hospital, where he was declared dead. Although it&apos;s yet to be determined whether the man purposefully or accidentally rolled into the train, an NYPD spokesman said, &quot;No one pushed him into the train, it&apos;s not a crime.&quot; The medical examiner will determine cause of death.</p>
