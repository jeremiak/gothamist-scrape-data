<p>Ahh, assistant district attorneys&#x2014;whether they&apos;re allegedly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427145504/http://gothamist.com/2012/11/10/allegedly_drunk_brooklyn_ada_arrest.php">slapping EMTs</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427145504/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/09/should_brooklyn_adas_put_blackface.php#photo-1">wearing blackface</a>, they&apos;re always a barrel of laughs! And on Thursday night, a Brooklyn ADA joined that motley crew when <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427145504/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/drunk_with_power_UhcTDoNobI7W4VHgibcgfL?utm_source=SFnewyorkpost&amp;utm_medium=SFnewyorkpost">he was arrested after refusing to pay his cabbie</a>. And after cops were brought in to settle the dispute, Imran Ansari allegedly told them, <strong>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m a Brooklyn ADA and I outrank you.&quot;</strong></p>

<p>Ansari was headed home to Long Island City around 10:20 p.m. on Thursday when taxi driver Mohammad Hossain stopped at 48th Avenue and Vernon Boulevard to let him out. He owed the driver $21.50 fare: &#x201C;I&#x2019;m not going to pay you,&#x201D; Ansari allegedly told him. After cops arrived, Ansari admitted he had no money, and he was arrested and charged with theft of services, a class-A misdemeanor. He was also suspended from the Brooklyn DA&#x2019;s Office, according to Jerry Schmetterer, chief spokesman for the Brooklyn DA.</p>

<p>&#x201C;All he had to do was pay the 20 bucks. What a jerk,&#x201D; a law-enforcement source told the Post. &#x201C;The one thing you don&#x2019;t do when you&#x2019;re a DA is tell people you&#x2019;re a DA! That&#x2019;s when you get in trouble.&#x201D; <br>
Earlier this year, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427145504/http://gothamist.com/tags/williambryanjennings">a (now former) Morgan Stanley banker</a> was accused of stabbing a cabbie over a fare after a 40-mile trip to Connecticut. Those charges were later dropped, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427145504/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/12/charges_dropped_against_allegedly_s.php">to that driver&apos;s frustration.</a></p>
