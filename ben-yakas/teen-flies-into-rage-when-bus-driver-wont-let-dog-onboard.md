Driver Marlene Bien-Aime told 17-year-old Steangeli Medina she couldn&apos;t carry her dog in her jacket when she tried to board the Bx9 on Fordham road yesterday. That&apos;s when Medina lost it:  &quot;She punched the driver in the face. <strong>She then drags her off the bus by her hair...where she punched and kicked her repeatedly about the body</strong>,&quot; a source <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120126041303/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2011/06/22/2011-06-22_teen_faces_rap_in_bx_bus_beatdown.html">told the News</a>.<p></p>

<p>Bien-Aime was taken to St. Barnabas Hospital with a black eye, facial cuts, and chest injuries; Medina was charged with assault, menacing and harassment. And during the fracas, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120126041303/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/bus_driver_beaten_up_ArXAnKvOxjsWTNUqUUMXrK?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">Post says</a> the dog disappeared!

<p>According <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120126041303/http://mta-nyc.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/mta_nyc.cfg/php/enduser/std_adp.php?p_faqid=514&amp;p_created=1054149029&amp;p_sid=6Z4vp9Ti&amp;p_lva=516&amp;p_sp=cF9zcmNoPTEmcF9zb3J0X2J5PSZwX2dyaWRzb3J0PSZwX3Jvd19jbnQ9MyZwX3Byb2RfbHZsMT0mcF9wcm9kX2x2bDI9JnBfcGFnZT0xJnBfc2VhcmNoX3RleHQ9cGV0cw**&amp;p_li=">to the MTA</a>, small domestic pets are only permitted on subways, NYC Transit and MTA buses if they are in kennels or similar small containers that &quot;can be accommodated by you on your lap without annoyance to other passengers.&quot; </p>

<p>Frank Austin, a vice chairman of Transport Workers Union Local 100, was appalled by the attack: &quot;The bus driver was doing her job, enforcing the rules, and was assaulted while performing her duties, for no apparent reason.&quot; This incident is a far cry from another <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120126041303/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/08/bus_rage_you_should_have_f-ing_kill.php">bus/dog confrontation</a> from the spring, when a Brooklyn woman got so enraged when her B74 bus driver swerved to avoid hitting a dog, she pummeled him while screaming, &quot;You should have fucking killed the dog.&quot;</p>
