<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:215px; "> <img alt="3411ahmadinejad.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412183813im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/3411ahmadinejad.jpg" width="215" height="254"> <br> <i>&quot;Why did you trade Jay Buhner?&quot;</i></div> Considering how much time he spends restricting the rights of his people and alleging that 9/11 was a giant Western conspiracy, we&apos;d be surprised to learn that Iranian president and clown-of-the-century nominee <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412183813/http://gothamist.com/tags/mahmoudahmadinejad">Mahmoud Ahmadinejad</a> has any time for something like sports. But it turns out that Ahmadinejad has a huge thing for soccer&#x2014;so much so, that one US diplomat <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412183813/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/2011/03/04/2011-03-04_mahmoud_ahmadinejad_called_the_george_steinbrenner_of_iran_by_a_us_diplomat_wiki.html">dubbed him</a> &quot;The George Steinbrenner of Iran.&quot;<p></p>

<p>This report comes via a US cable released by WikiLeaks, which details the president&apos;s meddling with Iran&apos;s national soccer team. It seems that Ahmadinejad <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412183813/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/international/wikileaks_ahmadinejad_is_steinbrenner_IyhDrhnkne71Xb8x3lTm5M">hoped to use</a> the popularity of Iran&apos;s Team Melli to generate support for his campaign before the 2009 elections. He even influenced the firing of two coaches within weeks in 2009&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412183813/http://gothamist.com/tags/georgesteinbrenner">Steinbrenner</a> of course was notorious for firing 21 managers during his 37 years as Yankees owner. It seems Ahmadinjead stepped over the line in the past with the team: Team Melli was suspended from international tournament play in 2006 because of &quot;repeated violations&quot; by Ahmadinejad, who ignored rules barring political interference in the sport. </p>

<p>Even with his meddling, we&apos;re a little uncertain whether this is <em>really</em> a fair comparison. Unless Ahmadinejad writes pools and puddles of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412183813/http://gothamist.com/2010/10/15/pools_and_puddles_of_purple_passion.php">purple prose</a>, or enjoys the company of an eggplant calzone for lunch everyday, we just can&apos;t get behind the comparison with The Boss. And of course, according to past WikiLeaks, Ahmadinejad had previously been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412183813/http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/140882">compared to</a> Hitler. </p>

<p>Ahmadinejad has already <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412183813/http://articles.nydailynews.com/2010-11-29/news/27082690_1_iranian-leader-iranian-president-mahmoud-ahmadinejad">dismissed</a> the Wikileak cables as a United States ploy to make him look bad. But try as he might to put on his sunny clown-face, obviously not everything is right in Ahmadinejadland: the president <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412183813/http://www.autoevolution.com/news/ahmadinejad-sells-his-peugeot-for-25-million-32261.html">recently sold</a> his 1977 Peugeot 504 for $2.5 million, saying that the money will go to fund the build of 60,000 homes for women and the disabled...but we&apos;ll believe it when we see it.</p>
