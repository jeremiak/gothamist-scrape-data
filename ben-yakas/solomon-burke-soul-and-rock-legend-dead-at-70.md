Burke, a pioneer of soul, rock and R&amp;B; in the 1960s, scored several huge hits in that decade, including &quot;Cry To Me&quot; and &quot;Everybody Needs Somebody To Love,&quot; both of which were featured prominently in movies (<em>Dirty Dancing</em> and <em>The Blues Brothers</em>, appropriately) and both of which were covered by the nascent Rolling Stones. Burke was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2001.</p>

<p>Legendary Atlantic Records producer Jerry Wexler once called Burke, &quot;<strong>the best soul singer of all time</strong>,&quot; but he never achieved the same level of fame as his contemporaries, such as James Brown and Marvin Gaye. Burke was also a preacher, and imbued his music with a bone-deep spirituality. He lived quite a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412160856/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/51942/217711">colorful life</a> outside of music and the church too: he had 21 children, 90 grandchildren, and 19 great-grandchildren. He <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412160856/http://www.avclub.com/articles/rip-solomon-burke,46177/">ran</a> a mortuary business, sold chicken and porkchop sandwiches to musicians who he toured with, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412160856/http://www.roctober.com/roctober/solomonburke.html">supposedly also ran</a> a drugstore whose pharmacy required him to ride a bike to gets perscriptions filled.</p>

<p>For the uninitiated, it is highly recommended that you check out his late-career masterpiece, the Grammy-winning <em>Don&apos;t Give Up On Me</em>, and it&apos;s followup <em>Make Do With What You Got</em>. Both albums feature Burke covering obscurities and newly-written songs from the likes of Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, Tom Waits, Elvis Costello, Van Morrison and Brian Wilson. Below, you can see a live performance of the title track from <em>Don&apos;t Give Up On Me</em>, with Burke bursting in passion from his signature chair.</p>
