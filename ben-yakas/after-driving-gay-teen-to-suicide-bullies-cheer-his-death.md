<p>Last week, a 14-year-old boy who was bullied because of his sexuality <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160831092250/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/21/teen_who_recorded_it_gets_better_vi.php">was found dead</a> of an apparent suicide. The death of Jamey Rodemeyer, who had recorded a striking &quot;It Gets Better&quot; video months before, has provoked an outpouring of sympathy for the family, and support for anti-bullying laws. But according to Jamey&apos;s parents, the bullies who allegedly drove Jamey to suicide <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160831092250/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/2011/09/27/2011-09-27_parents_of_gay_teen_who_committed_suicide_jamey_rodemeyer_say_taunts_continue_af.html">are still harassing</a> the family and defiling Jamey&apos;s memory. </p>

<p>Tracy and Tim Rodemeyer appeared on the Today Show yesterday to discuss what happened to their son. In the course of the interview (which you can watch below), they revealed that their 16-year-old daughter Alyssa was harassed at her homecoming dance by the same teens who had bullied her brother for being gay. &quot;<strong>It was supposed to be a time for her to grieve and have fun with her friends, and it turned into bullying even after he&apos;s gone</strong>,&quot; Rodemeyer said.</p>

<p>&quot;She was having a great time, and all of a sudden a Lady Gaga song came on, and they all started chanting for Jamey, all of his friends. <strong>Then the bullies that put him into this situation started chanting, &apos;You&apos;re better off dead!&apos; and &apos;We&apos;re glad you&apos;re dead!&apos; and things like that,&quot;</strong> Tracy Rodemeyer told NBC.</p>

<p>Last week, Jamey&apos;s hero Lady Gaga <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160831092250/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/22/lady_gaga_wants_to_meet_with_obama.php">publicly expressed her grief</a> over his death, and paid nearly 40K <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160831092250/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/26/lady_gaga_pays_38500_to_meet_presid.php">to meet with President Obama</a> to discuss anti-bullying laws.
