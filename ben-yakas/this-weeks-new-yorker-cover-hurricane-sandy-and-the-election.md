<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160207201542/http://gothamist.com/tags/newyorker">The New Yorker</a> revealed the cover of this week&apos;s issue, which comments on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160207201542/http://gothamist.com/tags/hurricanesandy">Hurricane Sandy</a>, the blackouts of lower Manhattan, and the upcoming election. Artist <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160207201542/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/09/adrian_tomine_graphic_novelist.php">Adrian Tomine</a> described how he ended up connecting the storm&apos;s destruction with the election: &#x201C;Where I was in Brooklyn, I don&#x2019;t think I would have even known that there was a major storm happening,&#x201D; he said. &quot;So I spent the whole night glued to the Internet and watching everything unfolding, just being shocked that this kind of dramatic destruction was happening just miles outside my home. And I started thinking about how it would affect the election...and somehow these two significant events just came together into that one image for me.&quot;</p>

<p>Tomine, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160207201542/http://www.amazon.com/dp/177046087X">who has a new book out</a> featuring his extensive and always excellent work for the magazine, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160207201542/http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/culture/2012/11/cover-story-sandy-and-election.html">further explained:</a></p>

<blockquote>For all its really horrible effects, I feel like the storm has made real a lot of issues in the election that were hypothetical, that were thrown around as debate topics&#x2014;global warming; and Is Obama enough of a leader to handle a natural disaster?; and Do we need FEMA? It&#x2019;s really interesting, and in a way useful, to see a lot of these things become actual issues that are right at hand.</blockquote>
