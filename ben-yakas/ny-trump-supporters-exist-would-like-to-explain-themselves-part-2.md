<p>What New Yorker would vote for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161227203448/http://gothamist.com/tags/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a>? And knowing what the atmosphere is like here, would they even tell anyone about it? For the past month, I&apos;ve been talking to every New York-based Trump supporter I could find to try to parse those questions.</p>

<p>Yesterday, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161227203448/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/26/new_yorkers_for_trump.php">we published the first six interviews</a>, and below, you&apos;ll find six more New Yorkers opening up about what life is like in NYC for Trump supporters. Their words are only edited for clarity.</p>

<p><em>Asa Jonathan Low, 43, Coney Island (above)</em></p>

<p><strong>What are your thoughts on the election? Do you think the media has treated Trump unfairly?</strong> Yes, I think they have treated him unfairly, and I think the media has to change its ways. I think all the bad publicity is Hillary Clinton&#x2019;s camp feeding the media bad press, and the media falling for it. </p>

<p><strong>Have you felt pressure from your friends or family about your support for Trump? Do you ever feel like you can&#x2019;t discuss it with them, or discuss it in public?</strong> No. I&#x2019;m very open about my support for Trump.</p>

<p><strong>Do any of his policies or the things that he&#x2019;s said give you pause? </strong>No, they don&#x2019;t. Because it&#x2019;s all Hillary Clinton&#x2019;s camp. Hillary Clinton&#x2019;s camp is making false media about him. They paid off the media, they bought the media, and now the media is making him feel bad&#x2014;making him look bad. Bottom line: it&#x2019;s Hillary Clinton&#x2019;s camp.</p>

<p><strong>What about the things that he&#x2019;s said?</strong> That&#x2019;s false. He only said those things in the debate. The first debate is when he said those things. And they were wrong because she was pressuring him. </p>

<p><strong>What things are you talking about specifically?</strong> All the bad publicity about him hating women. Like in the second debate, when he said he doesn&#x2019;t hate women. He&#x2019;s for women. All these women are out here for nothing. They&#x2019;re protesting a man who said those things and they took it wrongly. They&#x2019;re the wrong ones not him.</p>

<p><strong>When did you decide to vote for Trump?</strong> I decided that we needed to make America great again. And I decided, right then and there, that I was going to vote for Donald Trump. </p>

<p><strong>Is there any cognitive dissonance between living in New York City, which is a typically left-leaning environment, and supporting Trump?</strong> No. I support him thoroughly. And fully. And with all my heart and soul.</p>

<p><strong>Do you find yourself holding your tongue about politics around Hillary supporters or do you debate them?</strong> I debate them, which I&#x2019;m about to do right now. Are we done? </p>

<p><strong>Is there anything that you could imagine happening between now and the election that could change your mind?</strong> No. Nothing. </p>

<p><em>Anonymous, Greenpoint, 30&apos;s </em></p>

<p><strong>What are your thoughts on the election?</strong> It&apos;s a fascinating shitshow. I&apos;m extremely distrustful of both sides of the media, who I feel basically create the news and then &quot;report&quot; it. I also think this election, even more than 2012, demonstrates how influential social media is both the news cycle and our brains.</p>

<p>Evolutionarily, we&apos;re not equipped to process event &gt; instant commentary &gt; more commentary &gt; then even more commentary on the opposing side&apos;s commentary &gt; next event somewhat caused by volcanic commentary, etc. Even in 2005 we could have an event and wait at least a few hours to think about what the fuck just happened; now, that&apos;s over, and it&apos;s just a deluge of people convincing you to feel &quot;the right way&quot; about what&apos;s happened. And I think the overall effect of this is resentment, division, and confusion.</p>

<p>Viewed as a whole, social media is basically bad and causes more distortion than clarity on our reality. But maybe I&apos;m just an old man....</p>

<p><strong>Do you think the media has treated Trump unfairly?</strong> Yes, of course. But I think Rush Limbaugh has treated Hillary and Bernie unfairly. That&apos;s the game and that&apos;s how everyone makes money. I do think the media has specifically tried to make Trump seem SCARY, but I think that strategy is ineffective because they&apos;re preaching to the already-converted, and the people they need to convince don&apos;t watch those shows or read those papers.</p>

<p>Also, if there was video of Trump collapsing and his right foot completely going dead (like Hillary on 9/11) that would have been a MUCH bigger story.</p>

<p><strong>Have you felt pressure or judgement from friends and loved ones about Trump, or have you kept it to yourself? Do you fear public shaming?</strong> Yes, absolutely. And this is really the heart of the matter: Under the stewardship of the left, culture is now inhospitable to dissent. You actually can&apos;t disagree with people anymore. It&apos;s unfortunate, but to be honest I&apos;d rather talk about about almost anything else besides politics when I&apos;m out so it&apos;s not that annoying for me personally.</p>

<p><strong>Do any of his policies, or any of the things he&apos;s said, give you pause?</strong> Yes. He&apos;s appeared clueless over a few major issues and the wall talk was over-the-top. But I also think he&apos;s done what he&apos;s done to sub-communicate information to the people he believes will get him elected. I think it&apos;s all been part of his strategy, and he&apos;ll actually govern in a more tempered way. Of course, I could be completely wrong and the Trump train will plow ahead with just as much bluster once he&apos;s in office.</p>

<p><strong>Do you hate Hillary?</strong> I wouldn&apos;t go as far as &quot;hate&quot; but I think she&apos;s a phony. As in, I don&apos;t really ever believe much of what she says, and I think she&apos;ll say whatever is to her advantage at that particular moment. I find her mannerisms, way, countenance (whatever you want to call it) practiced ... and therefore suspicious.</p>

<p><strong>When did you decide (was there a conscious moment/event/speech/etc) to vote for Trump?</strong> All the wall talk is, of course, pretty crazy. However, I like that he was basically communicating that borders matter, which is an important issue for me. I&apos;d say also that I have a much more negative view of where our country is headed&#x2014;even when compared to as recently, say, 2008. When Obama was elected, I really did feel like we were getting somewhere culturally and it was such a big step forward for America. But now, eight years later things just feel worse, and way more fractious. So, to me, Hillary feels like continuing the status quo and Trump will certainly be different, which by my lights at this stage of the game feels like a better option.</p>

<p>If/when Trump wins, though ... my God that&apos;s going to be a really annoying few weeks in New York. But I imagine a lot of clicks for Gothamist!</p>

<p><strong>Is there any cognitive dissonance between living in NYC, a typically liberal-leaning urban environment, and supporting Trump?</strong> Eh, not really. Politics, for the most part, is boring to talk about. I&apos;d rather talk about sandwiches, tunes, sports, etc., so it&apos;s not that big of a deal. (Cue the comment section, &quot;WHITE PRIVILEGE&quot;)</p>

<p><strong>Do you find yourself holding your tongue about politics around Hillary supporters or debating them?</strong> It depends on where I am and whom I&apos;m with but generally speaking, yes. If you&apos;re opposed to the immigration policy we have in place, or you think maybe we shouldn&apos;t be throwing ourselves into conflicts in the Middle East, or we have too many abusing the welfare state, you&apos;re labeled a bad person. So best to really just leave it alone.</p>

<p><strong>And is there anything that you could imagine happening before the election that might change your vote?</strong> I still haven&apos;t decided if I&apos;m voting for Trump, or not voting at all. I&apos;ll see how I feel after the debates.</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="103516trump6.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20161227203448im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/103516trump6.jpg" width="640" height="427"> <br> <i> Getty Images</i></div> <p></p>

<p><em>George Bezama, &quot;former architect, now Internet businessman&quot;</em></p>

<p><strong>What are your thoughts on the election? Do you think the media has treated&#xA0;Trump&#xA0;unfairly?</strong>&#xA0;Well, I have to say this is certainly an unusual election. In both parties there were unorthodox candidates that weren&#x2019;t really there in any other recent election. In my opinion the GOP &#x201C;establishment&#x201D; put up a similar fight as did the Dem &#x201C;establishment&#x201D;, but in the end were more willing to go with whom their voter base wanted. (One more reason to vote GOP!) I do believe the media has had a strong slant against Mr. Trump. Even during the GOP primaries, the media were first on Mr. Bush&#x2019;s side and then on Mr. Cruz&#x2019;s. Now, during the general election, outside of a very few &#x201C;mainstream&#x201D; media sources, almost all the TV and newspaper outlets are for Hillary.</p>

<p><strong>Have you felt pressure or judgement from friends and loved ones about&#xA0;Trump, or have you kept it to yourself? Do you fear public shaming?&#xA0;</strong> Everyone that knows me personally knows I support Trump. I don&apos;t like keeping secrets.</p>

<p><strong>Do any of his policies, or any of the things he&apos;s said, give you pause?&#xA0;</strong> I think many of his policies are actually logical, although his argumentative style is blustery quick facts instead of slow explanatory (necessary due to TV presentation). That said, Mr. Trump seems to occasionally lose his cool. I hope this trait does not end up with him using a nuclear weapon. Even used on terrorists, it would cause immense political damage. Which is still better than Hillary, who seems eager to actually get us into a war with a nuclear power&#x2014;Russia.</p>

<p><strong>Do you hate Hillary?&#xA0;</strong> &#x201C;Hate&#x201D; is a strong word. I have a strong suspicion of, dislike of, and distrust of Hillary Clinton. Hating someone takes too much energy and there are better things to do in life.</p>

<p><strong>When did you decide (was there a conscious moment/event/speech/etc) to vote for&#xA0;Trump?&#xA0;</strong> The system, even the GOP system, needed a shake-up. I supported him since July after listening to several of his speeches/talks.</p>

<p><strong>Is there any cognitive dissonance between living in NYC, a typically liberal-leaning urban environment, and supporting&#xA0;Trump?&#xA0;</strong> Yes. Outside of my personal acquaintances and friends, I&#x2019;m here to get things done and live life, not talk politics with people. New Yorkers are great people outside the political realm. But the general atmosphere is something in the back of my mind.</p>

<p><strong>Do you find yourself holding your tongue about politics around Hillary supporters or debating them?&#xA0;</strong> Depends on the occasion. Most of the time it would interfere with work, so I avoid it. And most of the time, they just repeat lines and don&#x2019;t have too many logical arguments.</p>

<p><strong>And is there anything that you could imagine happening before the election that might change your vote?</strong> If Trump starts eating babies, I&#x2019;ll change my mind.</p>

<p><em>Millie Efraim, 21, Upper East Side, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161227203448/https://www.everipedia.com/millieefraim/">&quot;cultural commentator/critic&quot;</a></em></p>

<p><strong>What are your thoughts on the election? Do you think the media has treated Trump unfairly?</strong> I think the entire election has merely been a reaction to Donald Trump. Starting from the Republican primaries to the result of the Democratic candidate and the ugly battle between the front runners now. Just until before the election it was cool to say the media was biased&#x2014;obviously it&apos;s not just cool, it&apos;s true. However now that the media has been turned against Donald Trump it is backwards to make the same claim. It&apos;s interesting how anything affiliated with the conservative movement is regarded negatively by the majority of mainstream media and therefor regarded negatively by the American youth. </p>

<p><strong>Have you felt pressure or judgement from friends and loved ones about Trump, or have you kept it to yourself? Do you fear public shaming or whatnot?</strong> I&apos;ve always had an affinity for Donald Trump and his brand name, he&apos;s sort of a living icon of the past that we they don&apos;t make anymore. He&apos;s bold, he has gravitas, he&apos;s sometimes crass but so was Joan Rivers (RIP). I&apos;m all about that era. That being said I was pretty open about being thrilled when Trump announced his candidacy and overtime my parents were actually the ones to tell me to tone it down! I&apos;ve definitely been unfollowed by a lot of people on Twitter/Facebook but it hasn&apos;t affected my relationships with anyone who has been a stable figure in my everyday life. </p>

<p><strong> Do any of his policies, or any of the things he&apos;s said, give you pause? </strong> I support same-sex marriage, however I get the feeling that Donald Trump wouldn&apos;t be spending his time in office reversing laws in the 37 states that have already legalized it. I myself don&apos;t affiliate as a conservative or a liberal and it is very unpopular to say this, but I think Trump has had to embrace certain political positions in order to please the Republican party. You would say that&apos;s corrupt but that&apos;s politics, no sane person in this day and age would enter the political field as you are bound to be utterly chewed and spit out by the media and public eye. What matters the most to me is that Donald Trump is an outsider and I&apos;d like to see Washington flipped upside down.</p>

<p><strong>Do you hate Hillary?</strong> I don&apos;t respect anyone who takes dirty money from corrupt leaders who treat women like dirt and then puts it into her &quot;foundation&quot; that coincidentally pays for her jet fuel as well. I also don&apos;t respect someone who lies to the country she has been serving and moreover someone who doesn&apos;t even know how to cover up her lies. I think there is a huge observation to be made about the mind state of American people. Our society has become so phatic, we have placed such immense weight on words rather than actions. When Donald Trump has been responsible for the death of anyone, let me know and I&apos;ll retract my vote&#x2014;and yes his business holds him reliable for thousands of lives actually. </p>

<p><strong>Is there any cognitive dissonance between living in NYC, a typically liberal-leaning urban environment, and supporting Trump?</strong> I&apos;m a pretty unapproachable person so my support for him hasn&apos;t really affected my day to day life in NYC and I don&apos;t really look like the &quot;typical&quot; Trump supporter. However being involved with art and fashion I do tend to keep my opinions to myself when I sense that the person takes politics too personally. </p>

<p><strong>Do you find yourself holding your tongue about politics around Hillary supporters, or debating/challenging them?</strong> If I&apos;m doing business with a Hillary supporter I respect their differences and I don&apos;t see why our political beliefs should interfere with our relationship. However, if I encounter a Hillary supporter outside of school or work I am very open to challenging them. And I have had healthy debates with some of them. </p>

<p><strong>Is there anything that you could imagine happening before the election that might change your vote?</strong> At this point I&apos;ve lost all regard for morals. Obviously both candidates are pretty unorthodox but I&apos;ve exhausted every possibility as to why someone who has been in public office from such a young age is so corrupt and unstable in her beliefs. </p>

<p>My parents actually met Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago in 2012. My mother was smoking a cigarette alone on the patio when Trump approached her and offered to bring her an ashtray. He then proceeded to offer to have the heat lamps turned on for her&#x2014;eventually this led to a conversation between both of my parents and their friends (who are immigrants from Iran&#x2014;they came here legally). I could easily see an opportunistic woman who was in my mother&apos;s position changing this story into Trump hitting on her or sexually harassing her. </p>

<p><em>Liam Crowley, 19, Fordham University-Rose Hill student, Belmont resident</em></p>

<p><strong>What are your thoughts on the election? Do you think the media has treated Trump unfairly?</strong> This election is totally unprecedented in its vulgarity and unpopularity, but it is exactly what this country needs in order to be more politically involved. The internet has played a bigger role in the election than any previous one. It&#x2019;s been extremely entertaining to watch. As a country, we are now more politically divided than ever, but that was inevitable in my opinion. Every American media outlet is biased in one way or another, and I believe that many reports of Hillary&#x2019;s corruption, shady history, and pandering were covered up or ignored. Obviously Trump made quite a few mistakes on the campaign trail, but there is no doubt that the media wants a Clinton victory. I knew this would be the case before the election season even started&#x2014;anyone paying attention would. </p>

<p><strong>Have you felt pressure or judgement from friends and loved ones about Trump, or have you kept it to yourself? Do you fear public shaming?</strong> I am fortunate enough to have a family that accepts my choice to support Trump. I have friends on both sides of the political spectrum. However, I do feel pressure here on campus and in the city to conform and support Hillary. I usually bring up politics when meeting new people just to get a sense of that person&#x2019;s philosophical background and intelligence. I don&#x2019;t care if I alienate people. If someone disagrees with me, a healthy debate can be personally rewarding for both of the sides involved. I just want to be honest about who I am.</p>

<p><strong>Do any of his policies, or any of the things he&apos;s said, give you pause?</strong> Trump previously said he would restrict the press in some ways if he became president, and that was concerning. Freedom of speech is an issue I take very seriously. I&#x2019;m not offended by anything he&#x2019;s said, even though I don&#x2019;t think he should have said much of it. I value policy over words, and I agree with much of Trump&#x2019;s policies.</p>

<p><strong>Do you hate Hillary?</strong> Yes, I despise what she represents. I absolutely hate hypocrisy, pandering, corruption, and deceit. I do not want more interventionist foreign policy or government regulation on the economy. There has never been a more establishment candidate for president than Hillary, and if she wins we will only continue the cycle of an inefficient and corrupt Washington. I refuse to support our government&#x2019;s current status quo. A liberal government will only serve to make our country weaker in the world economy, prone to more terrorist attacks, and involved in more expensive and unnecessary conflicts. </p>

<p><strong>When did you decide (was there a conscious moment/event/speech/etc) to vote for Trump?</strong> I think Hillary&#x2019;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161227203448/http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/04/hillary-clinton-pandering-radio/479004/">&quot;hot sauce&quot; comments</a> on &#x201C;The Breakfast Club&#x201D; morning radio show back in April were a tipping point for me. The shameless pandering proved to me that Hillary is unable to understand normal people and will never change her political tactics. It was so exploitive, awkward, and repelling to me that I knew I couldn&#x2019;t support her in any way. </p>

<p><strong>Is there any cognitive dissonance between living in NYC, a typically liberal-leaning urban environment, and supporting Trump?</strong> There is cognitive dissonance, but that is a good thing. Despite being one of the most diverse cities in the world, NYC is shockingly conformist in its political views. My hope is that if I make people uncomfortable or angry with my views, hopefully that person will look at their own views and logically support them. </p>

<p><strong>Do you find yourself holding your tongue about politics around Hillary supporters, or debating/challenging them?</strong> Hillary supporters tend to follow a herd mentality because she is so uncharismatic and bland. Most Hillary supporters I know are former Bernie supporters who sold out their beliefs to support the establishment, one of their many hypocrisies. I like to debate and challenge them because I come from the perspective of someone who is for Trump, whereas they come from the perspective of someone who is against Trump, not for Hillary. The irony is that they wanted political change, but they vehemently oppose Trump who clearly represents that change. </p>

<p><strong>Is there anything that you could imagine happening before the election that might change your vote?</strong> Trump has survived every pitfall so far, and I don&#x2019;t think anything can bring him down at this point. Nothing can change my vote; I&#x2019;m locked in for Trump. </p>

<p><em>Elena, 56, &quot;self-employed,&quot; lives in Trump Tower</em></p>

<p><strong> What are your thoughts on the election? Do you think the media has treated Trump unfairly?</strong> Absolutely. It&apos;s no question. Maybe Fox News treated him, maybe 85% fairly, and Hannity, too.</p>

<p><strong>Have you felt pressure or judgement from friends and loved ones about Trump, or have you kept it to yourself? </strong> All my family supports Donald Trump. The whole building supports Trump! Anyone who knows him personally is supporting him. I see him in the elevator, I know his kids. I know a different man. He is so nice with women. Look at his daughter. Half of the employees at his company are women. I don&apos;t believe this whole accusation.</p>

<p><strong>Do any of his policies, or any of the things he&apos;s said, give you pause?</strong> I fully support him. I haven&apos;t reconsidered. Not me, not anyone else I know.</p>

<p><strong>Do you hate Hillary?</strong> No. I admire her education. Not admire, but she made herself. She keeps her family together. I&apos;ve been married 37 years to the same man. Sometimes you have good days, some days are bad. I don&apos;t hate Hillary, I just support Trump. I don&apos;t have hate in my heart. Mr. Trump doesn&apos;t hate in his heart. This is why I support him.</p>

<p><strong>Is there any cognitive dissonance between living in NYC, a typically liberal-leaning urban environment, and supporting Trump?</strong> People have their opinion. I have my own. I have many reasons to vote for Trump. He&apos;s so strong for the First Amendment, which protects our freedom of speech. He respects freedom of speech.</p>

<p><strong>Do you find yourself holding your tongue about politics around Hillary supporters, or debating/challenging them?</strong> If people ask, I talk with them. I try and prove my point, and people listen. I&apos;m not ashamed; I&apos;m proud to support him.</p>

<p><strong>Is there anything that you could imagine happening before the election that might change your vote?</strong> There&apos;s no way.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum:</strong> Since these interviews were done over a month, I checked back in with a few people after the debates to see if anything had changed. The second interviewee in the piece&#x2014;<em>Anonymous, Greenpoint, 30s</em>&#x2014;had this to say: &quot;I&apos;m leaning towards not voting for Trump after all. It&apos;s not even because of anything specific from the debates or the leaked audio ... I think getting closer to the reality of voting for someone so &quot;unpresidential&quot;-slash-crazy has given me pause.&quot;</p>
