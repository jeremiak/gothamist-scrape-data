										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:250px; "> <img alt="42811yanks.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170314202833im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/42811yanks.jpg" width="250" height="146"> <br> <i>AP</i></div> The Yankees have made a few boneheaded errors in their day&#x2014;trading Jay Buhner  for Ken Phelps <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170314202833/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUwSxqnRW-8">comes to mind.</a> But thanks to one dopey Yankees season ticket rep, a much bigger error occurred this week: the Yankees <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170314202833/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/bronx/yanks_big_error_VCsqL8b9RZynjcoLZp5DbK?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">accidentally emailed</a> a file containing the private information on more than 20,000 season ticket accounts. Somebody get Costanza on the phone!<p></p>

<p>Included in the spreadsheet were account numbers, names, addresses, phone numbers, and email addresses of 21,466 season ticket plans. According <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170314202833/http://deadspin.com/#!5796294/yankees-accidentally-leak-personal-info-of-20000-season-ticket-holders">to Deadspin</a>, the information only included all of the &quot;non-premium&quot; seats, and excluded those in the luxury suites and the first few rows near the infield. The Yankees acknowledged the goof yesterday in an email sent to ticket holders; one such reader sent us the email he received (you can read it below). They stress that neither credit card information nor Social Security numbers were leaked. </p>

<p>According to members of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170314202833/http://forums.nyyfans.com/showthread.php/127243-Yankee-data-security-breach?p=7207707&amp;viewfull=1#post7207707">NYYfans.com message board</a>, who tried to crunch the numbers on some of the data, there are 2,179,237 total subscriber tickets sold for the year, 26,904 full season equivalents, and 17,686 separate subscriber accounts. As our reader pointed out, he has received no additional spam yet, but <strong>&quot;I am sure someone is going to sell that list to a telemarketer or something and then the fun will start.&quot;</strong></p>

<blockquote>Dear Yankees Season Ticket Licensee,

<p>We are writing to inform you about an accidental electronic distribution of information that you have previously supplied to the New York Yankees.</p>

<p>Monday evening, April 25, 2011 an employee of the Yankees sent an e-mail to several hundred Yankees Season Ticket Licensees.  The e-mail mistakenly attached an internal Yankees spreadsheet that listed the following information associated with your New York Yankees account:</p>

<p> &#xB7;         Your name, and the address, phone number(s), fax number, and e-mail address that you previously provided to the Yankees<br>
 &#xB7;         Your seat numbers, Yankees account number, Yankees account  representative name, and the ticket package code associated with your account</p>

<p>NO OTHER INFORMATION WAS INCLUDED IN THE DOCUMENT THAT WAS ACCIDENTALLY ATTACHED TO THE APRIL 25TH E-MAIL. THE DOCUMENT DIDNOT INCLUDE ANY BIRTH  DATES, SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS, CREDIT CARD DATA, BANKING DATA, OR ANY OTHER PERSONAL OR FINANCIAL INFORMATION.</p>

<p>Please note, immediately upon learning of the accidental attachment of the internal spreadsheet, remedial measures were undertaken so as to assure that a similar incident could not happen again.</p>

<p>The Yankees deeply regret this incident, and any inconvenience that it  might cause.</p></blockquote><p></p>
