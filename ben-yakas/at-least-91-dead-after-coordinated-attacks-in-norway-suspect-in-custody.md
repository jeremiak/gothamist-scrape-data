</div></div>					<p>At least 91 people were killed yesterday in Norway after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427192421/http://gothamist.com/2011/07/22/video_multiple_explosions_rock_gove.php#photo-1">two coordinated attacks</a> rocked the country&#x2014;and police <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427192421/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/24/world/europe/24oslo.html?_r=1&amp;hp">have now arrested and charged</a> a self-identified right wing Christian fundamentalist with spearheading the deadly attacks. Anders Behring Breivik, 32, is accused of dressing up as a police officer, entering the youth camp on the island of Utoya, and then shooting at least 84 people, most of whom were teens between 14 and 18. &#x201C;People were falling dead right in front of me. I ran through the campus to the tent area. I saw the gunman &#x2014; two people started to talk to him and two seconds later they were both shot,&#x201D; witness Adrian Pracon <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427192421/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-14259772">told the BBC</a>. </p>

<p>Pracon, who said he pretended to be dead &quot;to stay alive,&quot; described the gunman as &#x201C;sure, calm and controlled,&#x201D; and said that he &quot;screamed at us that we would all die.&#x201D; According to Labour Party member Bjorn Jarle Roberg-Larsen, Utoya has no bridge to the mainland, and terrified youths, who were attending a meeting of the ruling Labour Party, instead jumped into the water and &quot;started to swim in a panic...Others are hiding. Those I spoke with don&#x2019;t want to talk more. They&#x2019;re scared to death.&#x201D; Police chief Oystein Maeland <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427192421/http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/World-News/Video-Norway-Attacks---At-Least-91-Dead-In-Youth-Camp-Shooting-In-Utoya-And-Bomb-Attack-In-Oslo/Article/201107416035907?lpos=World_News_Carousel_Region_0&amp;lid=ARTICLE_16035907_Video%3A_Norway_Attacks_-_At_Le">told a news conference</a>: &quot;We can&apos;t guarantee that won&apos;t increase&quot;, adding the attack had reached &quot;catastrophic dimensions&quot;.</p>

<p>At the same time as the Utoya attack, at least two explosions occurred at a government building in Oslo, killing at least seven people, and leaving &quot;a lot&quot; of casualties. Manhattan-based pilot Ian Dutton, who was in Oslo during the attack, described it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427192421/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/2011/07/23/2011-07-23_shook_like_earthquake.html">to the News</a>: &quot;It was literally like a bolt of lightning had hit my bed. It knocked the air out of my lungs. It shook the hotel as if there had been an earthquake.&quot; Dutton&apos;s hotel was a quarter-mile from the blast site, and he had a bird&apos;s-eye view of the bomb&apos;s aftermath: &quot;There was a wall of debris and smoke, a big cloud. Right away, the first image in my mind was Sept. 11. It wasn&apos;t just smoke. It wasn&apos;t just flames. There was a big cloud that contained dust and dirt and broken up buildings.&quot;</p>

<p>Breivik has been implicated in the Oslo bombing as well as the Utoya slaughter, but police are still trying to determine if there was a second shooter on the island: &#x201C;We are not sure whether he was alone or had help,&#x201D; a police official, Roger Andresen, said at a televised news conference. Norway&apos;s prime minister Jens Stoltenberg denied that right-wing extremism was a particular problem for the country: &quot;Compared to other countries I would not say we have a big problem with right-wing extremists in Norway.&quot; According to an official report <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427192421/http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-07-23/norway-did-not-see-far-right-as-27serious-threat27/2807566">published this year</a>, Norwegian intelligence primarily feared an attack by Islamist extremists.</p>

<p>Police said they hadn&apos;t found any connections between Breivik and any particular anti-Islamic groups, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427192421/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/07/22/anders-behring-breivik-id_n_907513.html">the Huffington Post describes him as</a> an anti-Islamic nationalist, and the News <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427192421/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/2011/07/23/2011-07-23_who_is_anders_behring_breivik_norway_shooting_suspects_profile_emerges.html">dove into his Facebook page</a> to get an idea of who he is: among other things, the Norwegian national claims to be a fan of Winston Churchill, classical music, hunting, and serial killer TV show <em>Dexter</em>. It is also being speculated that Breivik used a front company, Breivik Geofarm, he founded in 2009 as an excuse to legally stockpile large quantities of fertilizer and other chemicals which he could have used to build the bombs.</p>
