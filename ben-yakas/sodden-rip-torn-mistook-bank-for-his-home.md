                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:250px; "> <img alt="2110torntorn.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20131213211049im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/2110torntorn.jpg" width="250" height="317"> <br> <i>(AP/Hermann J. Knippertz)</i></div> Some banks have been hit hard <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131213211049/http://gothamist.com/2009/12/01/goldman_sachs_bankers_ready_to_open.php">by the economy</a>, and some <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131213211049/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/15/us/15tax.html?ref=business">threatened by Obama</a>, but only one has been broken into by a wasted Rip Torn. It was first reported <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131213211049/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/national/actor_rip_torn_breaks_into_bank_kdpJfu8HvpPMtNwgAVBISP">over the weekend</a> that 78-year-old actor Torn was arrested for breaking into a Salisbury, Connecticut bank with a loaded revolver after closing hours, and jailed on $100,000 bail. It&apos;s now been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131213211049/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/rip_home_brew_BSov7UFoZ85LnfEJ9usX5O">revealed</a> that Torn had no intention of robbing the bank&#x2014;in fact, he was so plastered that he thought the back window to the bank, which he smashed open, was his front door. <p></p>

<p>When police found him on the ground of the bank, he thought he was dozing at home. Torn was charged with carrying a pistol without a permit, carrying a firearm while intoxicated, first-degree burglary, first-degree criminal trespass and third-degree criminal mischief. A &quot;glum-looking and disheveled&quot; Torn appeared in court today, according to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131213211049/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/actor_hauled_off_to_connecticut_ZWyqXH47ywnRXnicia6DbM">Post.</a> </p>

<p>Torn, whose credits range from the <em>Men in Black </em>movies to <em>The Man Who Fell to Earth</em> to <em>The Larry Sanders Show</em>, is no stranger to alcohol-related arrests. He was nabbed by Salisbury cops Dec. 14, 2008, on DUI charges after police spotted him driving his 1994 Subaru in the emergency lane&#x2014;with a Christmas tree strapped to the top. He had two past drunk-driving arrests in New York, one of which became notorious after a video emerged of the actor cursing at cops and refusing to cooperate with them. (You can see part of that video below.)</p>

<p>Even the head of the bank he broke into, President/CEO Mark E. Macomber, feels more sad than mad at Torn, telling <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131213211049/http://www.tmz.com/2010/01/31/rip-torn-bank-gun-drunk-loaded-revolver/">TMZ</a> he thought the actor needed help with his drinking. According to an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131213211049/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/rip_home_brew_BSov7UFoZ85LnfEJ9usX5O">anonymous Post source</a>, Torn&apos;s family has put him through several interventions, and &quot;Torn figured he had made significant progress <strong>by cutting back from four pints of alcohol a day to a single pint.&quot;</strong></p>

<p><strong>Update: </strong> Torn posted his bail, said &quot;Have a nice day,&quot; and immediately checked himself into a New York rehab facility this afternoon, according to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131213211049/http://www.nydailynews.com/gossip/2010/02/01/2010-02-01_rip_torn_to_enter_rehab_after_his_arrest_for_drunkenly_breaking_into_a_bank.html">Daily News</a>.</p>
