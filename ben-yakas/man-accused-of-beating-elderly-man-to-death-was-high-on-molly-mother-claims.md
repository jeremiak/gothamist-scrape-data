<p>The suspect who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406142418/http://gothamist.com/2014/05/13/east_village_beating_suspect.php">was arrested yesterday</a> for allegedly fatally beating an elderly man <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406142418/http://gothamist.com/2014/05/10/68-yr-old_in_critical_condition_aft.php">to death</a> in the East Village on Friday reportedly told his mother he was high on Molly before that attack. Jamie Pugh, 20, has been charged with second degree murder, assault, and robbery in the death of 68-year-old Ruan Wen Hui. His mother, Charlotte Pugh-Douglas, said in court today that someone had slipped Molly into his drink at a party Friday evening. &#x201C;He wasn&#x2019;t in his right state of mind,&#x201D; she said, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406142418/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20140514/east-village/attacker-was-high-on-molly-before-beating-68-year-old-death-mom-says">according to DNAInfo.</a></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406142418/http://gothamist.com/2014/05/11/graphic_video_of_man_beating_68-yr-.php">Graphic surveillance video shows</a> Hui being approached by a man on East 6th Street near Avenue D at around 8:45 p.m. Friday night. The suspect throws Hui to the ground before punching and stomping on his head. Hui, who lived on Avenue C and had just walked his grandchildren home at the time of the attack, died of his injuries on Sunday night.</p>

<p>Pugh&apos;s mother added that her son didn&apos;t remember the attack, and only became aware of it when a friend showed him the surveillance footage and noted the attacker looked like him. &quot;When he saw the video, it killed him inside. It hurt him. He was crying all weekend. He knows it&#x2019;s him. He just didn&#x2019;t remember,&quot; Pugh-Douglas said. Police <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406142418/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/14/nyregion/arrest-made-in-fatal-beating-of-68-year-old.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">were tipped off</a> to Pugh&apos;s location by someone in the neighborhood Tuesday night.</p>

<p>&quot;We feel so bad for the family and the man,&#x201D; Pugh-Douglas said, adding that her son has a 1-year-old daughter and was trying to get a job in security. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m sorry from the bottom of my heart, and so is Jamie. He&#x2019;s a good kid. He doesn&#x2019;t get into this stuff. If his friend hadn&#x2019;t slipped him those Mollys, this man would still be alive.&#x201D;</p>
