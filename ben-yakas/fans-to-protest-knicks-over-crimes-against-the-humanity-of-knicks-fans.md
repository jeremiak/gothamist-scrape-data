<p>Eight of nine losses since the All-Star break. Seven game losing streak to tanking teams like the Detroit Pistons and Orlando Magic. Sloppy play on the court; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506173210/http://gothamist.com/2014/02/25/knicks_guard_raymond_felton_arreste.php">gun incidents</a> off the court. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506173210/http://grantland.com/the-triangle/true-knicks-detective/">No deals</a> at the trade deadline. No future prospects in the draft. It&apos;s no wonder long-suffering <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506173210/http://gothamist.com/tags/knicks">Knicks</a> fans are feeling even more distraught and hopeless than usual. But some fans are channeling their depression into an event that will at least get them <em>feeling</em> something again: protesting the powers-that-be at MSG.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506173210/https://www.facebook.com/kf4lrally">Facebook group Knicks Fan for Life</a> is organizing a &quot;KF4L Rally&quot; in front of the Garden before the team hosts the Indiana Pacers on March 19th. Here is their manifesto:</p>

<blockquote>KF4L Rally Fan Discontent:
1) Dolan&apos;s failure to allow knowledgeable basketball people the autonomy/power to make basketball related decisions. (Pat Riley, Jeff Van Gundy, Donnie Walsh) His insistence on overriding the opinions of his basketball people by bidding against himself in negotiations and overpaying in trades. The rehiring of Steve Mills who has never been in the GM role before and presided over one of the most embarrassing eras in Knick history. 
<br><br>
2) The MSG Media Policy. Steve Mills has yet to speak to the media or fans about the state of the team since he came back. The fans deserve explanations and the media deserve to do their job in order to keep fans informed. The media policy creates an atmosphere in which competent GMs and coaches do not want to work in. 
<br><br>
3) The infiltration of CAA. Fans are uneasy of the abnormal influence CAA wields in the Knick organization. From a coach switching agents in order to sign a deal, to the team dealing a first rd pick for an oft injured forward repped by that same agency, to seemingly shady back room deals that allow Chris Smith to get signed to a fully guaranteed NBA contract. 
<br><br>
We understand Dolan will not sell. We understand change may not come of this. We just want our voices heard. We want to remind Dolan and the NBA that our voices matter. We buy the tickets, the jerseys, the NBA League Pass subscriptions. We are frustrated. We are tired. We deserve better.</blockquote>

<p>Desperate times call for desperate measures, but this wouldn&apos;t be the first time Knicks fans have risen up together. Back in 2007, fans <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506173210/http://blog.pennlive.com/lvsports/2007/12/fans_stage_protest_against_kni.html">rallied with signs at MSG</a> to beseech Dolan to fire then-coach Isiah Thomas. Although there haven&apos;t been any sexual harassment lawsuits recently, this current team is arguably playing as badly as that squad. And yet, Mike Woodson still has his job. What will it take for Dolan to finally cut the cord? What sort of proof will it take for him to finally see this team is the cruelest animal?</p>
