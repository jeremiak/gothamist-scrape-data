<p>If you&apos;ve felt like the subways have been missing a certain je ne sais quoi, perhaps it&apos;s the lack of Showtime in your life. The NYPD has been remarkably vigilant about cracking down on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140606050004/http://gothamist.com/tags/subwaydancing">subway breakdancers</a> in 2014: nearly 100 people have been arrested and charged for dancing on the subways this year. But NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton now says he&apos;s trying to come up with some sort of compromise, so life can get back to some sense of normal in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140606050004/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Footloose_(1984_film)">Bomont, New York City.</a></p>

<p>&quot;There is an opportunity in certain locations in the system where those individuals can perform and not be a risk to themselves, or to the public on moving cars,&quot; Bratton <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140606050004/http://nypost.com/2014/05/09/nypd-commish-defends-subway-dancers-says-they-deserve-space/">said on Friday</a>. &quot;On a subway car that sways, jilts, stops, it&apos;s too great to ignore and we will not ignore it.&quot; Bratton added that he would talk to the MTA about the idea, as well as permits being issued to entertain &quot;in appropriate places,&quot; which sounds a lot like how the NYPD has dealt with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140606050004/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/20/the_7_best_subway_buskers_in_nyc.php">underground buskers.</a></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140606050004/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Subway-Dancer-Arrests-NYC-NYPD-MTA-257160381.html">So far in 2014</a>, at least 46 people have been charged with reckless endangerment&#x2014;those are the Showtime breakdancers &quot;who swing from bars and do tricks over the heads of commuters.&quot; For some comparison, only two people were charged with reckless endangerment for that in 2013. </p>

<p>In addition to those 46, at least another 50 people have been arrested and charged with a lesser count of disorderly conduct for dancing on trains. Only one couple, as far as we know, have been arrested for dancing the Charleston on the subway, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140606050004/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/20/city_pays_75k_to_couple_arrested_fo.php">they were awarded $75K for their troubles.</a> All of which is to say, if you&apos;re going to dance on the subway this weekend, maybe you should stick to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140606050004/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/03/everybody_dance_now_videos_of_peopl.php">some classic moves</a>. We&apos;ll stick <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140606050004/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/11/video_happiest_headbanger_in_brookl.php">with some rigorous headbanging</a>, thank you very much. </p>
