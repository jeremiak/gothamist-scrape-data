<p>On Wednesday night, a 2-month-old baby being walked in his stroller <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504151310/http://gothamist.com/2012/09/06/two-month-old_baby_hit_by_stray_bul.php">was hit by a stray bullet in the Bronx</a>. The incident happened around 10:30 p.m. near the Seneca Houses in the Hunts Point section; little Trayvon Bunson, who was hit in the right shoulder, was taken to Lincoln Hospital and released later. Police have now released surveillance video of the two young-looking suspects fleeing the scene of the shooting. Watch below.</p>

<p>No arrests have been made yet, and the investigation is ongoing. Trayvon&apos;s aunt Klanee Brunson blamed the increase in gun violence and access to weapons: &quot;Everything needs to change. The community and the people in it. They need to stop letting people buy guns. People don&#x2019;t care if there are old ladies or babies on the streets. They don&#x2019;t care who is around.&quot;</p>

<p>Bronx Borough President Ruben Diaz Jr. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504151310/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2012/09/06/infant-grazed-by-bullet-in-the-bronx/">issued a statement</a> also calling for end to gun violence:</p>

<blockquote>I am deeply disappointed and saddened by the senseless gun violence in our borough this week, where a hard-working young man was killed while he worked at a gas station in East Tremont, and a 2-month-old baby boy was grazed by a stray bullet in Hunts Point. I speak for all Bronxites as we keep Lamin Sellah in our prayers and hope for little Trayvon Bunson&#x2019;s quick recovery. Ending gun violence has been a top priority of mine and I know it is a national problem. Unfortunately, despite our good work, too many firearms end up in the wrong hands both through legal and illegal means. We must all unite in putting an end to this senseless act of violence so we can better prevent these crimes and protect innocent people across our city and nation.

<p>I ask all Bronxites to be part of the solution and join my office as we go out into the community on September 22  for our annual &#x2018;Peace in our Streets&#x2019; initiative. I also urge all Bronxites with knowledge of illegal guns in their community to call 866-GUN-STOP to anonymously report those guns to the police.</p></blockquote><p></p>
