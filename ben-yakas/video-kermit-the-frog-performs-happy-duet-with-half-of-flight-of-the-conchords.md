<p>Tonight, Jason Segel&#x2014;the man entrusted with bringing the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406171448/http://gothamist.com/tags/muppets">Muppets</a> back onto the silver screen&#x2014;will be the host on <em>Saturday Night Live</em> (check out the promos below). We have a lot of faith in him&#x2014;after all, this <em>is</em> Nick Andopolis we&apos;re talking about, and anyone <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406171448/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzrMrglib6c">who can nail Styx&apos;s &quot;Lady&quot;</a> is gold in our book. We&apos;re keeping our fingers crossed for a Muppets cameo tonight, but until then, we&apos;ve really been enjoying this clip of Kermit the Frog performing &#x201C;Life&#x2019;s a Happy Song&#x201D;&#x2014;the opening number from the upcoming Muppets movie&#x2014;with <em>Flight of the Conchords&apos;</em> Bret McKenzie, the movie&apos;s music supervisor (and the song&apos;s author). Watch that below:</p>
