<p>After a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406145852/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JkGPwYDZUE">truly</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406145852/https://twitter.com/TheRealJRSmith/status/419324083906416640">boneheaded</a> loss to the Houston Rockets last night, it&apos;s not that surprising that fans and beat writers would rather focus on rumors of trades that have yet to be spoken outloud rather than (yet again) rehashing the desolate play of the team as it&apos;s currently made up. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406145852/http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/10233011/carmelo-anthony-blake-griffin-proposal-mulled">ESPN reports that</a> the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406145852/http://gothamist.com/tags/knicks">Knicks</a> and the Clippers have both internally discussed the <em>possibility</em> of proposing a Carmelo Anthony-for-Blake Griffin trade. Read between the lines people: this can only mean that the two teams are in psychic communication with one another as we type.</p>

<p>Or just read the lines as is: &quot;the clubs have not yet spoken to one another about a potential trade.&quot; As <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406145852/http://www.cbssports.com/nba/eye-on-basketball/24397382/report-clippers-knicks-considering-blake-griffin-carmelo-anthony-trade">CBS puts it</a>, &quot;this is very much when the girl&apos;s best friend tells the boy&apos;s best friend that the girl likes the boy but is too shy to say anything.&quot; Yeah, but for both teams to be discussing it in such a way that it &quot;leaked&quot; to ESPN, there must be something serious behind it, right? At least one of the teams must really want this trade to happen, <em>right??</em> Nope.</p>

<blockquote>One source close to the situation said the Clippers&apos; latest internal discussion ended in favor of keeping Griffin.

<p>New York&apos;s top priority, meanwhile, appears to be re-signing Anthony to a long-term deal this offseason.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>So this is a possible trade that hasn&apos;t been proposed by either side, because neither side really wants it to happen. This &quot;trade&quot; has been kicking around <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406145852/http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1886446-inside-the-one-trade-the-knicks-and-clippers-could-discuss-melo-for-griffin">since early December</a>, and it&apos;s no more credible or realistic now than it was then. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406145852/http://www.sbnation.com/nba/2013/12/14/5209814/blake-griffin-knicks-clippers-trade-rumors-insane">As SB Nation wrote</a>, the initial rumors were the product of &quot;insane Knicks exceptionalism&quot; run amok.</p>

<blockquote>There is minimal attention given to why the Clippers wouldn&apos;t do the deal; Donald Sterling is blamed/credited with vowing to never trade Griffin. The Knicks wouldn&apos;t do it because of the <strike>Illuminati</strike> CAA, who refuse to allow their client Carmelo Anthony to leave New York, where they run business services at Madison Square Garden.</blockquote>

<p>Would James Dolan really give up on Anthony after he moved heaven and Earth to bring him here (and shunned a lot of really good players in the process)? Is Anthony truly thinking about walking from the Knicks this off-season, even if CAA &apos;runs&apos; the team? Why would the Clippers risk their future on a guy who devotes himself to the cult of isolation plays? Would Tyson Chandler be part of this theoretical trade? Would draft picks be involved? Remember draft picks? </p>

<p>In case you can&apos;t tell from that last tweet, Gothamist&apos;s own Knicks beat writer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406145852/https://twitter.com/TheRealKingFish">Jonathan Fishner</a> is very much against this deal: &quot;It&apos;s a terrible idea and Blake Griffin sucks. I&apos;d need to check, but I believe he had microfracture surgery and is a power forward who relies on his athleticism. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406145852/http://gothamist.com/tags/amarestoudemire">Sound like anyone</a>?&quot; </p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: Here&apos;s Fishner&apos;s full thoughts on such a trade:</p>

<blockquote>If the Knicks really think Carmelo Anthony is leaving, it&apos;s time to tear this whole thing down and start over. Blake Griffin, who is averaging 22.1 points and 10.6 rebounds to Melo&apos;s 26.2 and 8.9, is not going to make the Knicks better than they are now. And paying him upwards of $17 million annually until 2017-18 won&apos;t give the Knicks any meaningful increase in cap flexibility, which they&apos;ll need considering Griffin is an extremely limited player outside of his ability to dunk the basketball. He can&apos;t shoot free throws, rarely shoots his jump shot and is a poor defender. He&apos;s had the luxury of playing with Chris Paul for the last couple of seasons and the two of them have won ONE playoff series. Sounds a little like the Knicks and Melo, except Melo&apos;s out there with Raymond Felton. Now, there is one point guard the Knicks are also rumored to covet, and that&apos;s Rajon Rondo. Well he can&apos;t shoot either, which would leave the Knicks to figure out how to find a stretch five who can also protect the rim (because Griffin can&apos;t). Too bad Kevin Garnett&apos;s washed up, he&apos;d be a nice fit. If the Knicks really think they are going to lose Carmelo Anthony, they should trade him for some combination of draft picks, young players and cap relief. Not a highly paid player with a limited offensive game who relies on his athletic ability and has had microfracture surgery. That&apos;s right, microfracture surgery, just like another highly paid offensive player who relied on his athletic ability and had microfracture surgery before coming to the Garden. And how&apos;s that working out?</blockquote>
