<p>In 2012, we profiled <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420040251/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/01/rent-a-gent.php">34-year-old single man Ian Zelesko,</a> who started Rent-A-Gent, a (chaste) service in which Zelesko offered to help single women do odd jobs around the house out of the goodness of his heart (and in return for some for Sierra Nevada Pale Ale). Rent-A-Gent was too good an idea for just <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420040251/http://rent-a-gent.tumblr.com/">one man&apos;s Tumblr</a> though&#x2014;now an unrelated company, presumably inspired by Zelesko&apos;s example, has launched their own pricey (but still chaste) version of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420040251/http://rentagent.me/">Rent A Gent.</a></p>

<p>The site describes its gents thusly: &quot;They represent the top 1% of the hundreds of men who applied to Rent a Gent. The services include singing, bar tending, dancing, cooking, teaching guitar, and serving as human furniture. Sex is not included but sexy outfits are.&quot; The company was started in May 2013, got its first client in November, and claims almost 150 women have used it since then. Prices for the men range from $300-800 per hour. </p>

<p>&quot;I realized that women want to be entertained by good-looking guys who are also smart and talented,&quot; co-founder and CEO Sara Shikhman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420040251/http://nypost.com/2014/02/23/new-company-lets-ladies-rent-guys-for-dates-handyman-tasks-and-more/">explained to the Post</a>. &quot;So now, my team and I hit LinkedIn, Monster and other career sites to recruit mostly Ivy League-educated men who are also actors, bartenders, cooks and more.&quot; </p>

<p>The site has a &quot;100 percent happiness guarantee,&quot; promising that women will receive a full refund if they aren&#x2019;t satisfied with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420040251/http://rentagent.me/all/adam.html">Adam The Breakdancing Stripper</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420040251/http://rentagent.me/all/harrison.html">Harrison The Revolutionary</a> (an expert in erotic hypnosis!), <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420040251/http://rentagent.me/all/gene.html">Gene The Karate Expert</a> , or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420040251/http://rentagent.me/all/antonio.html">Antonio The Wolf Of Wall Street.</a></p>

<p>The company is doing something right PR-wise: there have already been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420040251/http://grantland.com/hollywood-prospectus/bill-clinton-and-elizabeth-hurleys-torrid-fictional-affair-and-other-entertaining-lies-from-this-weeks-tabloids/">blind gossip items</a> about an &quot;aging pop legend&quot; who has been using Rent a Gent to find suitable male escorts to bring to her events. We think we have a rough idea of what that looked like:</p>
