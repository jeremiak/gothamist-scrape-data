<p>Investigators are still sorting through all the facts around last Sunday&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502122612/http://gothamist.com/tags/metro-northderailment">fatal Metro-North train derailment in The Bronx</a>, but the chief of the operator&apos;s union admitted yesterday that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502122612/http://nypost.com/2013/12/03/union-official-train-engineer-nodded-just-before-fatal-crash/">the worker &quot;basically nodded&quot; off</a> before the crash. &#x201C;He basically nodded... He had the equivalent of what we all have when we drive a car &#x2014; that is, you sometimes have a momentary nod,&#x2019;&#x2019; Anthony Bottalico, director of the Association of Commuter Rail Employees, said of engineer William Rockefeller Jr. </p>

<p>&#x201C;He caught himself, but he caught himself too late...He put the train in emergency, but that was six seconds prior to derailment,&#x201D; Bottalico added, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502122612/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/metro-north-train-engineer-daydreaming-crash-article-1.1535870">insisting that</a> Rockefeller made a &quot;mistake&quot; but didn&apos;t commit a crime. Altogether, four people were killed and 63 people were injured in the fatal crash which occurred around 7:20 a.m. Sunday morning. </p>

<p>The NTSB confirmed that the train was traveling 82 mph when it entered the sharp turn in Spuyten Duyvil, well over the 30 mph recommended speed. Initially, Rockefeller <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502122612/http://gothamist.com/2013/12/01/metro-north_conductor_blames_brakes.php">blamed the brakes for the incident</a>, but the NTSB disagreed: &#x201C;simply put...there is no indication that the brake systems were not functioning properly,&#x201D; said NTSB board member Earl Weener.</p>

<p>After the derailment, Rockefeller <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502122612/http://gothamist.com/2013/12/03/metro-north_operator_i_was_in_a_daz.php">allegedly told law-enforcement</a> that &#x201C;I was in a daze,&quot; and &quot;I don&#x2019;t know what I was thinking about and the next thing I know I was hitting the brakes.&quot; &#x201C;There was every indication he had time to get rest, to get focused,&#x201D; Weener added. &#x201C;There is no indication the brake systems were not functioning properly.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Because of Bottalico&apos;s comments, the NTSB <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502122612/http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304854804579237031765820694">has now removed the union</a> from the investigation. Bottalico &quot;discussed and interpreted information related to the ongoing investigation,&quot; the NTSB said, a violation of a confidentiality agreement all invested parties signed prior to the probe. </p>
