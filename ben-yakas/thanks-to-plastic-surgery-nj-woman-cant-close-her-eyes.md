title: Thanks To Plastic Surgery, NJ Woman Can't Close Her Eyes

										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:250px; "> <img alt="33011eyes.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508151450im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/33011eyes.jpg" width="250" height="188"> <br> <i>Marilyn Leisz (via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508151450/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2011/03/29/woman-unable-to-close-eyes-now-suing-n-j-plastic-surgeon/">CBS</a>)</i></div> Bad plastic surgery doesn&apos;t just happen to Sly Stallone: a NJ woman says an eyelid procedure gone wrong is the reason she can no longer close her eyes. Marilyn Leisz is suing Dr. Paul Parker for negligence for her eyes-stuck-wide-open surgery. &#x201C;All the favorite things I used to, like tennis, racquetball, swimming, horseback riding, bike riding, skeet shooting, gardening, I can&#x2019;t do those things,&#x201D; Leisz <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508151450/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2011/03/29/woman-unable-to-close-eyes-now-suing-n-j-plastic-surgeon/">told CBS</a>.<p></p>

<p>Leisz admits that she had had several plastic surgery operations prior to the eyelid operation. She said she went to Parker, a Bergen County plastic surgeon, to correct bumps on her eyelids from a cosmetic procedure performed by another doctor. But the married mother of two claims she wasn&apos;t warned of the risks, and was told later by another doctor that she wasn&#x2019;t a good candidate for this surgery because she had had too many other procedures. Now, she can&apos;t fully close her eyes, even when she sleeps: &quot;&#x2026;To blink I really have to really squeeze my eyes to&#x2026;fully close my eyes.&#x201D; She has to use gel at night, and a vaporizer so she doesn&#x2019;t scratch her eyes; she is losing her eyesight as well. </p>

<p>In the pantheon of botched plastic surgery <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508151450/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/26/everyone_loves_to_get_a_boob_job.php">procedures</a>, this is definitely up there with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508151450/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/02/si_mom_says_plastic_surgeon_gave_he.php">four breasted lady</a>. But maybe this is some sort of existential crisis made real&#x2014;after all, some might say that hell is being in a room with other people <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508151450/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Exit">without ever blinking.</a></p>
