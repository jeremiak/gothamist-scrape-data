<p>It turns out that some cable guys hate cable guys just as much as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422214421/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/17/is_the_waiting_for_the_cable_guy_ti.php">everyone else hates</a> cable guys. Time Warner employee Jason A. Steward <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422214421/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/queens/queens_cable_boss_busted_head_facebook_Uu22uPTGon2AEaEOtRQ4PL">was arrested after he reportedly ranted on Facebook</a> about wanting to kill his boss: &#x201C;There is not a word in the dictionary that can express the rage that im in! I really really hate Fritz!&#x201D; Steward wrote about his supervisor, Fritz Guerrier. &#x201C;I wish I had a machine gun to give them all the business.&quot; </p>

<p>&#x201C;I will go to work and blow all them low budget [expletive ] heads off,&#x201D; Steard added in his September 13th Facebook post. &#x201C;Make u [Guerrier] suck the gun before I off U [expletive ].&#x201D; Steward, who lives in the Bronx but works in Queens, had been involved in an ongoing dispute over overtime pay with Guerrier; Steward admitted to police that he was &#x201C;intoxicated and angry&#x201D; when he ranted on Facebook. He has now been charged with a felony charge for making a terroristic threat and two misdemeanor counts of aggravated harassment.</p>

<p>&#x201C;I would like to put everyone at ease and apologize once again,&#x201D; Steward later told authorities. &#x201C;I never intended to hurt anyone and words will not express how sorry and senseless my behavior was; I am deeply embarrassed for my stupid actions.&#x201D; Steward faces up to seven years in prison. Sheesh, and there we were thinking that cable guys have these carefree lives <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422214421/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/17/ex-employee_sues_time_warner_cable.php">watching porn all day</a> instead of answering <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422214421/http://gothamist.com/2012/09/14/even_patrick_stewart_cant_get_time.php">Jean-Luc Picard&apos;s cries for help.</a></p>

<p>Eric Mangan, a spokesperson for Time Warner Cable, said, &#x201C;We thank the Queens District Attorney for quickly investigating this threat. Ensuring our people&apos;s safety is a top priority. Mr. Steward was terminated from Time Warner Cable on September 15 as we have zero tolerance for this behavior.&#x201D;</p>
