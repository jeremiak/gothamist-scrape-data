<p>There finally seems to be a (literal) light at the end of the tunnel for Manhattan residents: Con Edison said today that they believe power will be restored to all of the island <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161021/http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-02/con-ed-still-sees-full-manhattan-power-restoration-tomorrow.html">by tomorrow.</a> </p>

<p>Around 226K customers are still <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161021/http://www.coned.com/newsroom/news/pr20121102.asp">without power in Manhattan</a> (mostly in lower Manhattan below 39th Street). Initially, spokesman Robert McGee <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161021/http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-02/u-s-sends-marines-as-new-york-struggles-back-from-storm.html">told Bloomberg</a> that &quot;significant progress&quot; has been made, and said it could be back as early as this evening. Fellow spokesman Mike Clendenin corrected that, saying it wouldn&apos;t be till tomorrow. And now, Con Ed&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161021/https://twitter.com/ConEdison/status/264371354722246656">Twitter feed</a> is keeping expectations in check: &quot;Two specific networks on the very tip of lower Manhattan may come back today, still on target for the rest of Manhattan by Sat...&quot;</p>

<p>We&apos;ve contacted Con Ed to try to get some more clarity about which networks might be back today, and their timetable for tomorrow. In the meantime, Con Ed will also be handing out dry ice around the five boroughs at noon this afternoon. In Manhattan, they&apos;ll be at Union Square Park - 14th Street and Union Square West (South Side); in Brooklyn, they&apos;ll be at Walgreen&#x2019;s on Neptune Avenue (between W. 5th &amp; 6th Streets); in the Bronx, they&apos;ll be at 1846 Radcliff Avenue (between Morris Park Avenue &amp; Rhinelander Avenue); in Queens, they&apos;ll be at Francis Lewis Playground PS130 (at Francis Lewis Boulevard &amp; 42nd Avenue); and on Staten Island they&apos;ll be at the entrance to Great Kills Park on Buffalo Street. </p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: Con Ed is toying with our hearts today: first, this morning they said power would be restored to Manhattan sometime today, then they revised that to say it would be back before the end of tomorrow...and now, they&apos;re back to saying today. Gov. Andrew Cuomo <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161021/https://twitter.com/nytjim/status/264389583461036032">said as much during</a> his press conference this afternoon. He added, &quot;I&apos;ll call the utilities once a day until they can reliably deliver the product that they&apos;re selling to New Yorkers.&quot;</p>
