title: Please Refrain From Choking Your Bus Driver In The Middle Of The BQE
---

	
										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="71611choke.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501163348im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/71611choke.jpg" width="250" height="162" class="image-left"> </span>No one could be blamed for losing their minds a little on the migraine-inducing unavoidable major artery that is the BQE&#x2014;many who came before us have cursed the name Kosciusko as some karate-techno song drifted through the window during some endless traffic jam caused by a broken down truck...and many after us will as well. But it still doesn&apos;t mean you should resort to choking your bus driver for not letting you off in the middle of the bridge.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, that&apos;s just what Christian Jesselli <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501163348/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/nypd_blotter/nypd_daily_blotter_33lyBhqOfalLZuaeWx6UnK#ixzz1SH2OWoEd">is accused of doing</a> late the other night. The 27-year-old allegedly yelled at the driver to pull over as the packed bus traveled near 86th Street and Dahlgren Place in Dyker Heights on the BQE at 12:10 a.m. Thursday. When the MTA bus driver shockingly refused, Jesselli started slapping and choking him. Passengers called 911 and restrained Jesselli, who was charged with attempted assault and reckless endangerment.</p>

<p>To sum up: everyone hates the God-forsaken slabs of concrete that is the BQE. Everyone <em>should be</em> pulling for the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501163348/http://gothamist.com/2010/08/25/is_bqe_tunnel_bypass_possible.php">BQE tunnel bypass</a> to come to be. But there&apos;s no need to be violent about it. Maybe next time, Jesselli should try putting on some <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501163348/http://gothamist.com/2007/10/30/bqe.php">relaxing music</a> to take his mind off of the road.<br>
