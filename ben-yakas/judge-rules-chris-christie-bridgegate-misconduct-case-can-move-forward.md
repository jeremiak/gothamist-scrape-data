<p>A year ago, a dead-eyed Chris Christie <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170506041541/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/02/dead-eyed_christie_drumpf.php">was debasing himself</a> on national television in an attempt to charm his way into a cabinet position in Donald Trump&apos;s administration. As recently as last November, he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170506041541/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/09/chris_christie_seems_poised_for_whi.php">still seemed &quot;poised&quot;</a> for a White House job of some sort. And <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170506041541/https://www.leafly.com/news/politics/chris-christie-just-interview-job-trump">earlier this week</a>, after Christie had lunch with Trump amid major personnel upheaval, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170506041541/https://www.yahoo.com/news/trumps-in-trouble-is-it-christie-time-already-100043322.html">Yahoo declared</a>, &quot;Trump&#x2019;s in trouble. Is it Christie time already?&quot;</p>

<p>But Christie should probably put any potential White House ambitions on the backburner, since he still has some pesky legal issues to deal with at home. A judge <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170506041541/http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2017/02/bridgegate_misconduct_complaint_vs_christie_can_pr.html">has found probable cause</a> for a citizen&apos;s misconduct complaint to proceed against Christie for his role in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170506041541/http://gothamist.com/tags/bridgegate">Bridgegate</a> scandal. But hey, Christie might get the chance to answer the age-old question: can you host a successful <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170506041541/https://sports.vice.com/en_us/highlight/chris-christie-who-is-still-governor-of-new-jersey-phillies-suck">sports talk radio show</a> from prison?</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170506041541/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Chris-Christie-Bill-Brennan-Probable-Cause-Misconduct-George-Washington-Bridge-Lane-Closure-Scandal-Judge-Rule-Citizen-Complaint-413938833.html">NBC reports:</a></p>

<blockquote>Judge Roy McGeady had previously ruled in October that the case had merit to proceed, but a state Superior Court Judge overturned his decision and kicked it back to McGeady&apos;s court for another hearing Thursday. Again, McGeady found there was probable cause for the complaint, despite statements last month from the Bergen County prosecutor&apos;s office that it would not pursue charges.

<p>The complaint, filed by former Teaneck firefighter William Brennan, accuses Christie of failing to stop subordinates from purposely creating traffic jams to punish a Democratic mayor who didn&apos;t endorse him for reelection.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170506041541/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/21/wchris_christie_bridgegate.php">Last fall</a>, former aide Bridget Kelly testified that Christie knew about the planned lane closures on the GW Bridge when they were first proposed and that he once threw a water bottle at her in anger. Both Kelly and fellow aide Bill Baroni <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170506041541/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/04/bridgegate_verdict_christie_cronies.php">were found guilty</a> on all counts related to Bridgegate; their testimony was quoted in Brennan&apos;s complaint.</p>

<p>Brian Murray, press secretary for Christie, said in a statement that McGeady is &quot;violating the law, pure and simple...This concocted claim was investigated for three months by the Bergen County Prosecutor&#x2019;s office, which summarily dismissed it, after concluding that the very same evidence relied upon again by this judge was utter nonsense. That is exactly what it is. The law requires this judge to have done the same. This is a complete non-event.&quot;</p>

<p>At least Christie has good friends like Trump <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170506041541/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/01/05/donald-trumps-utter-decimation-of-chris-christie/?utm_term=.d7ba23b5f928">who&apos;ll definitely have his back</a>, no matter what comes. </p>
