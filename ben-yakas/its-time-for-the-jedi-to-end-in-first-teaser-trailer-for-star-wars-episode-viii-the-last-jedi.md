<p>&quot;I only know one truth: it&apos;s time for the Jedi to end,&quot; Luke Skywalker says ominously at the end of the first teaser trailer for the new <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170420111344/http://gothamist.com/tags/starwars">Star Wars</a> movie, aka <em>Star Wars Episode VIII: The Last Jedi: What Do They Know?: Do They Know Things?: Let&apos;s Find Out!</em> We may not know whether the titular Jedi are singular or plural, but It will probably save America. Watch it below.</p>

<p>Rey is training all over the place! Luke is whispering a lot! Finn is...still napping! Poe is running toward explosions! Leia is looking at holograms! The Millennium Falcon is shooting bad guys! Rylo Ken has a scar! There&apos;s a cool-looking space battle! Much like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170420111344/http://gothamist.com/2014/11/28/video_star_wars_the_force_awakens_t.php">the first teaser</a> for <em>The Force Awakens</em>, they&apos;ve done a good job of teasing a lot without giving much away. </p>

<p>(Funny enough, Luke only says &quot;It&apos;s time for the Jedi to end&quot; in the teaser above, but the one shown at &quot;Star Wars Celebration&quot; in Orlando on the livestream had the full line at the start of the post, and I&apos;m keeping it that way.)</p>

<p>Here&apos;s the first poster for the new film:</p>

<p>During the panel discussion, various cast members appeared on stage and talked a little bit about the new film. We &quot;go deeper into Rey&apos;s story,&quot; Daisy Ridley said. &quot;Rey has a certain expectation [about meeting Luke]...it&apos;s difficult when you meet your heroes, because it might not be what you expect.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It&apos;s a test for all the characters, but specifically for Finn,&quot; said John Boyega. &quot;Is he going to be part of the Resistance or is he going to continue running from the First Order? We&apos;ll see.&quot; Director Rian Johnson added that the galaxy has been thrown into chaos after the events of <em>The Force Awakens</em> and the First Order &quot;are making some big moves. Things are going to get dire.&quot;</p>

<p>We also were introduced to Kelly Marie Tran, who plays new character Rose, a maintenance worker in the Resistance who apparently shares a lot of scenes with Finn. </p>

<p>And here are a few behind-the-scenes pics:</p>
