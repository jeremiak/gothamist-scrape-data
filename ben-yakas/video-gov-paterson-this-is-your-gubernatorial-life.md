<p>Gov. Paterson has been in office for nearly 34 tumultuous months since he took over from hooker-aficionado Eliot Spitzer in March 2008. Between the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412172436/http://gothamist.com/2010/02/10/ny_times_what_bombshell_story.php">almost-scandals</a>, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412172436/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/19/major_day_according_to_several.php">actual-scandals</a>, and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412172436/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/24/governor_paterson_on_saturday_night.php">SNL-parodies</a>, it was in his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412172436/http://gothamist.com/2010/12/01/paterson_says_it_sucked_being_gov_r.php">own words</a>, &quot;very challenging, very difficult, very painful at times.&quot; Now that he&apos;ll be handing the gubernatorial baton off to Andrew Cuomo in January, he and the media have started the process of excavating his short term in office. And he&apos;s already given an exit interview with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412172436/http://www.wmht.org/index/tv-1/wmht-weekly-local-programs-10/new-york-now-34.html">New York Now</a>. </p>

<p>In that exit interview, he says of his tenure as Governor: &quot;<strong>This is probably the most difficult period to manage in NY states&apos; history</strong>, and without any preparation, I came into office on March 17 on a couple of days notice, and worked us through the most difficult economic crisis we will see in our lifetimes. When you&apos;re Governor and you have that many decisions to make, you&apos;ll make mistakes. But if you keep working, and you keep learning, you can get to a point where you have success.&quot; Among other things, he also talks about one of his greatest regrets: &quot;I regret not appointing the Senator early, but it&apos;s hindsight that informs me of it...I think the frenzy is what led to the unfortunate mis-characterization of one of the candidates [Caroline Kennedy] by people working for me, something I will regret for a long time.&quot; Below, you can see a compilation of memorable moments from Paterson&apos;s term in office.</p>
