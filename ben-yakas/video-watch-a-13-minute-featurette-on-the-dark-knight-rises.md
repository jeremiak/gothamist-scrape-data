<p>Sometimes we feel like we know nothing and everything about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161318/http://gothamist.com/tags/darkknightrises"><em>The Dark Knight Rises</em></a>&#x2014;the East River bridges get blown up, Bane has some sort of asthma, Catwoman is Batman&apos;s new best friend...and there are a lot of street closings? Now, Warner Brothers has released a 13-minute featurette on the summer blockbuster. For those who are spoiler-averse, there&apos;s very little new footage, but there are lots of interviews with the cast and crew, and a lot of behind-the-scenes footage from the final part of Christopher Nolan&apos;s Batman trilogy. Watch below:</p>

<p>The movie, which will be released on July 20th, had its first advanced screening for critics this week, and the reactions were overwhelmingly positive&#x2014;it even received a standing ovation. One <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161318/https://twitter.com/tommcauliffe">lucky viewer</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427161318/http://www.comicbookmovie.com/fansites/nailbiter111/news/?a=63076">gave Comic Book Movie</a> some general impressions of it: &quot;The trilogy is greater than the sum of its parts, and for me the 3rd was the very best part of the whole story...Godfather 3 never happened. Xmen 3 &amp; Spider-Man 3 were awful, this film was the perfect final chapter in the trilogy.&quot;</p>
