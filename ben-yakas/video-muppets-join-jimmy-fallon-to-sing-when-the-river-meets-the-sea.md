<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406171406/http://gothamist.com/tags/themuppets">The Muppets</a> are no stranger to <em>Late Night With Jimmy Fallon</em>&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406171406/http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Late_Night_with_Jimmy_Fallon">they&apos;ve made 13 appearances</a> on the show since 2009, including a few Christmas-themed singalongs. Last night, Kermit and Robin (Kermit&apos;s nephew) showed up to sing &quot;When The River Meets The Sea,&quot; a sweet little tune from the John Denver/The Muppets &apos;70s album, with Fallon and The Roots. Watch it below!</p>

<p>Below, you can listen to the original John Denver-sung version of the song. And below that, you can watch a short clip of Fallon and The Muppets singing a seemingly impromptu version of Harry Nilsson&apos;s classic &quot;One.&quot;</p>
