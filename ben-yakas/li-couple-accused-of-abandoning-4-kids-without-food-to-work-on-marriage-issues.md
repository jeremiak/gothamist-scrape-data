<p>A Long Island couple has been arrested and accused of leaving their four children home alone without food or heat for nearly a week. Tulio Ayala, 34, and Maria Ayala, 31, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140410030649/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/long-island-couple-leaves-4-children-home-days-food-heat-cops-article-1.1614205">have been charged with</a> endangering the welfare of their children&#x2014;ages 15, 13, 8, and 4&#x2014;all so the couple could &quot;work out their marital issues.&quot; But the Ayalas claim they&apos;ve been sold down the river by the children&apos;s grandmother.</p>

<p>&quot;We were having marital problems, and so I told my mom, &apos;I&apos;ll be back in a few days&#x2014;can you watch them?&apos;&quot; Tulio <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140410030649/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2014/02/13/long-island-couple-accused-of-leaving-4-kids-home-alone-for-6-days/">told CBS yesterday</a>. &quot;And you know, she said she was fine with it. I left them with money in my own house, and she lives in the basement and everything, so they were not unattended.&quot; The couple added that they left $100 dollars, food stamps and space heaters for the kids. </p>

<p>Whatever plans Tulio thought he had with his mother apparently didn&apos;t work out for her: they told CBS that grandmother was the one who called police, telling them the children had been left home alone. &quot;She never called or attempted to text me, and said look, &apos;I don&#x2019;t want to watch them,&apos;&quot; Tulio said. &quot;I would have come home.&quot; </p>

<p>Police say neighbors also reported the children were home alone, that the Ayalas were rarely home, that the grandmother worked a lot, and that the kids were using the oven for heat. &quot;You can tell when somebody needs something, and the little girl, Sasha &#x2014; which is my sweetheart; they all are - she would always tell me they were, &apos;I&#x2019;m hungry,&apos; and I would always, just, you know, give her stuff,&quot; neighbor Cathy Martin said. &quot;I didn&#x2019;t know it was to this level.&quot;<br>
