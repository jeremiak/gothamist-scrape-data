Hmm, men paying a middleman who encouraged his female client to have sex with them...what does that sound <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130830014728/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/30/escort_says_prince_charming_actuall.php">like</a>?</p>

<p>Finele Carpenter, 57, a former Ford and Jordache model, was in a Manhattan court this week having sued her doctor, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130830014728/http://www.castleconnolly.com/doctors/full.cfm?source=nymetro&amp;doctorID=81CC000988">Allen Collins</a>, founding chairman of Lenox Hill Hospital&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130830014728/http://www.zocdoc.com/lenoxhill/allen-collins-md-mph-5297">psychiatry department</a>. Carpenter, who was sexually abused as a child and raped in her 20s, began seeing Collins in 2000. He was very casual with sharing patients; he recommended a divorce lawyer patient of his to her during their second session, and soon began recommending clients to her as potential dates, many of whom were married. </p>

<p>Carpenter claims that Collins also revealed information he had heard about their sex life from the male client: <strong>&quot;[he] would ask me if I had an orgasm, what it felt like, how I felt, did it please me.</strong>..[he] told me I should never ask a man if he [was] on Viagra, which I had done&quot; and told her the man wouldn&apos;t be calling her again because his wife smelled perfume on him when he returned home.  After that relationship ended, Carpenter was referred to at least four other &quot;unhappily married&quot; patients of Collins, who allegedly hoped some would leave their marriages for her.  &quot;<strong>It was sexual voyeurism, all for the doctor&apos;s titillation</strong>,&quot; she said in court filings, adding he put her on nine different medications and scheduled her for three different 90-minute sessions a week. </p>

<p>Collins admitted he did set her up with clients, but positioned it as encouraging &quot;positive social encounters,&quot; and &quot;if things developed, things developed. I was not specifically recommending the development of a relationship in one way or another.&quot; However, a jury sided with Carpenter, who was awarded $400,000 for damages, as well as a reimbursement of $250,000 for the five years she saw him. </p>
