<p>And here is the least shocking news of the day: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429092601/http://gothamist.com/tags/rent">rents</a> in Brooklyn have continued to rise like a planet inhabited by apes over the last year. When once Brooklyn rents were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429092601/http://gothamist.com/tags/rents">too damn high</a>, now they are so damn high they have started carving artisanal bongs out of the remnants of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429092601/http://gothamist.com/2014/02/07/the_moonstruck_tree_has_been_choppe.php"><em>Moonstruck</em> tree</a> because getting high off nature is just more real, man.</p>

<p>According to the latest report from real estate firm Douglas Elliman [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429092601/http://www.elliman.com/pdf/8de2647033e4f4a21170af112e1e2f6282a62c67">PDF</a>], median rental prices in Brooklyn rose 11.6% from this time a year ago, reaching $2,890, the highest point in five years. Average Brooklyn rental prices increased nearly 3% to $3,178. While the average rental price of studios in Brooklyn has decreased nearly 5% to $2,300, the median rental price for studios has increased a whopping 27% to $2,260.</p>

<p>One other interesting tidbit: while prices for one- and two-bedroom apartments have increased in both average and median prices, the price for three-bedroom apartments has gone down quite a bit. Average three-bedroom rental prices have gone down 20% since 2013 to $4,281. There&apos;s also been a nearly 50% increase in the amount of three-bedroom units on the market in that period, so that&apos;s clearly the way to go if you don&apos;t mind sharing space with someone who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429092601/http://gothamist.com/2014/02/28/roommate_tinder_sex.php">may or may not have a Tinder addiction. </a></p>

<p>Of course, we still think you&apos;d probably be better off <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429092601/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/07/why_not_buy_this_island_instead_of.php">buying a small island</a> if you have the cash.</p>
