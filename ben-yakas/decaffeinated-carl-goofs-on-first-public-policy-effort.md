<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="92210paladino.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120605150628im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/92210paladino.jpg" width="250" height="136" class="image-left"> </span>Earlier today, Mayor Bloomberg <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120605150628/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/22/bloomberg_endorses_cuomo_for_govern.php">gave his endorsement</a> for governor to Andrew Cuomo, leaving mad-as-hell Republican candidate Carl Paladino very sad indeed. But instead of letting that sadness boil over and ferment into the frothy brew of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120605150628/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/20/sling_it_paladino_cuomo_posters_awe.php">rage and photoshopping skills</a> that it usually does, Paladino was on his best behavior the last couple days during a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120605150628/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/21/paladino_visits_root_of_all_new_yor.php">visit to NYC</a>.</p>

<p>One Republican source <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120605150628/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/09/22/2010-09-22_kinder_gentler_pol_shifts_to_the_issues__shows_some_love_for_the_big_apple_cuddl.html">told the Daily News</a>, &quot;<strong>The last 24 hours, he&apos;s looked more like &apos;decaffeinated Carl&apos; or &apos;Carl light,&apos; where he&apos;s still saying what&apos;s on his mind, but he&apos;s being less bombastic.</strong>&quot; He talked shop with former Gov. George Pataki, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120605150628/http://polhudson.lohudblogs.com/2010/09/22/paladino-calls-on-former-pataki-hand-to-lead-campaign/">hired a former Pataki aide</a> as his campaign chairwoman, met with Jewish leaders in Brooklyn, and generally tried to stick to talk about issues instead of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120605150628/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/20/paladinos_daughter_agrees_hes_no_ra.php">desperately</a> trying <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120605150628/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/20/paladino_bullies_cuomo_for_debate_h.php">to prove</a> he&apos;s no racist. </p>

<p>Sadly, one of his first attempts at a public-policy effort broke down completely. On John Gambling&apos;s WOR-AM show, Paladino announced his &quot;blue-ribbon tax cut team;&quot; but two of those memebers,  CNBC business-show host Larry Kudlow and former state Comptroller Ned Regan, said they knew nothing of the panel and hadn&apos;t talked to Paladino anytime recently. Regan <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120605150628/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/paladino_board_botch_QypHld81XCdfsqDaB52NQL?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">told the Post</a> he wouldn&apos;t serve, and Kudlow laughed maniacally when asked. Cuomo wasted no time seizing on the goof: &quot;I guess it&apos;s a new twist on the old theory that it&apos;s easier to apologize later than ask for permission first. <strong>So much for his first attempt at substance</strong>,&quot; said Cuomo spokesman Phil Singer.</p>
