<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501172256/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/19/its_international_talk_like_a_pirat.php">International Talk Like A Pirate Day</a> is coming up this Wednesday, September 19th&#x2014;and for once, there&apos;s an actual good reason why <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501172256/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/23/jets_enemy_bill_belichick_is_also_a.php">dressing up like Bill Belichick</a> wouldn&apos;t be the worst thing in the world. If you use proper pirate lingo at participating <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501172256/http://gothamist.com/tags/krispykreme">Krispy Kremes</a> on Wednesday, you&apos;ll get one free original glazed donut. And if you dress up like a pirate, you&apos;ll get a dozen original glazed donuts for free!</p>

<p>You can see the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501172256/http://krispykreme.com/Upload/Pdfs/TalkLikeaPirate.pdf">full list of participating stores here</a>&#x2014;that includes the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501172256/http://locations.krispykreme.com/location/new-york">midtown location at Penn Plaza</a> for NYers. In terms of the lingo, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501172256/https://www.facebook.com/events/281148181991387/">phrases such as</a> &quot;Ahoy Matey!&quot;, &quot;Blow Me Down!&quot;, &quot;Heave Ho!&quot;, &quot;Landlubber!&quot;, Sea Dog!&quot;, Thar She Blows!&quot; and &quot;Yo Ho Ho!&quot; all would work&#x2014;of course, you have to put in the requisite enthusiasm that the exclamation points suggest. But really, you might as well band together in your office and get one co-worker to bite the pirate bullet for the free dozen.</p>

<p>Oh, and in case there was any confusion, Krispy Kreme notes in the fine print: &quot;No purchase necessary. No coupon required. <strong>No weapons allowed</strong>. Limit one offer per guest per visit.&quot;</p>
