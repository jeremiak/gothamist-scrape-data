<p>The Awl points us in the direction of blogger Caroline, and the sad, all-too-typical <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141005023949/http://nogreatillusion.tumblr.com/post/2824969178/this-is-something-that-happened-to-me">story of her experience</a> with an emergency locksmith one late night. Caroline called an emergency locksmith at 1 a.m. when she couldn&apos;t get into her apartment, and was handed an exorbitant $613 bill, which he demanded she pay in cash on the spot. We can attest to the ridiculous pricing, since we had a similar experience last Fourth of July (the price goes up even higher on holidays, of course). But after Caroline called the locksmith&apos;s bluff about bringing in the cops, what happened next is a <em>bit</em> surprising: by her account, the officer who arrived treated her like shit.</p>

<blockquote>When I got home, I couldn&#x2019;t stop crying and shaking for two hours. I was sick to my stomach. I was $613 poorer. I have never had so much as a speeding ticket. I have never done drugs. I never drank underage. I trusted that the officer would recognize the situation for what it was - a scammer, taking advantage of a young girl living alone, who obviously didn&#x2019;t know better.</blockquote>

<p>Read her whole account of the terrible evening <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141005023949/http://nogreatillusion.tumblr.com/post/2824969178/this-is-something-that-happened-to-me">here</a>. The moral of the story is, whatever you do, don&apos;t call a locksmith in the middle of the night. Especially on a holiday. Instead, as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141005023949/http://www.theawl.com/2011/01/dear-young-people-you-never-ever-call-an-emergency-locksmith">The Awl says</a>, &quot;the answer is go sleep at a friend&apos;s house, or pick up someone in a bar and sleep at their house, or sleep in a park.&quot;</p>
