<p>Would it shock you to learn that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161031223653/http://gothamist.com/tags/ladygaga">Lady Gaga</a> is a bit of a diva? No, of course it wouldn&apos;t, because then she wouldn&apos;t be Lady Gaga. But that is the basis <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161031223653/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/25/lady_gaga_8.php">of a lawsuit</a> filed against her by former personal assistant Jennifer O&apos;Neill. O&apos;Neill wants hundreds of thousands of dollars in overtime pay which she believes she is owed, while Gaga called her a &#x201C;f--king hood rat who is suing me for money that she didn&#x2019;t earn.&#x201D; Gaga and O&apos;Neill have both been deposed now, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161031223653/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/national/gag_comes_off_gaga_lawsuit_fiery_Lhfr37x9GtF2mtKX1whpPN">the NY Post has</a> all the ego-stroking details from their testimonies. Because you don&apos;t actually want to read <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161031223653/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/ept_with_gaga_SLtvqBZmfPgiWrhzkMdiUM">the whole thing</a>, we&apos;ve picked out our ten favorite quotes.</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Lady Gaga has a healthy sense of self-esteem:</strong> &#x201C;She&#x2019;s just &#x2014; she thinks she&#x2019;s just like the queen of the universe,&#x201D; Gaga said during the deposition about O&apos;Neill. &#x201C;And, you know what, she didn&#x2019;t want to be a slave to one, because in my work and what I do, I&#x2019;m the queen of the universe every day.&#x201D; </li>
	<li><strong>Lady Gaga doesn&apos;t sleep alone:</strong> &#x201C;I was by her side virtually 24 hours a day, seven days a week,&#x201D; O&#x2019;Neill testified. &#x201C;That includes sleeping in the same bed with her. Because she did not sleep alone.&#x201D; She added that she felt it was a required part of her job. &#x201C;Unlike anybody else on that tour, I did not have my own hotel room. I was not asked if I wanted my own hotel room,&#x201D; she said.</li>
	<li><strong>Lady Gaga lets her assistants hang out with Terry Richardson, so why aren&apos;t they more appreciative?</strong> &#x201C;I&#x2019;m quite wonderful to everybody that works for me, and I am completely aghast to what a disgusting human being that you have become to sue me like this,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;Because [O&apos;Neill] slept in Egyptian cotton sheets every night, in five-star hotels, on private planes, eating caviar, partying with [photographer] Terry Richardson all night, wearing my clothes, asking YSL [Yves Saint Laurent] to send her free shoes without my permission, using my YSL discount without my permission.&#x201D;</li>
	<li><strong>Lady Gaga doesn&apos;t know how to work the DVD player, and/or is really lazy:</strong> &#x201C;Another thing she would do in the middle of the night, would be wake me up to have me change the DVD in the DVD player because she didn&#x2019;t want to watch that DVD any more and she couldn&#x2019;t get up to walk across the room to change the DVD herself,&#x201D; O&#x2019;Neill said.</li>
	<li><strong>Lady Gaga doesn&apos;t want her assistants getting laid:</strong> &#x201C;I had no privacy, no chance to talk to any family, no chance to talk to any friends, no chance to have sex if I wanted to have sex,&quot; O&apos;Neill said. &quot;There was no chance to do anything.&#x201D;</li>
	<li><strong>Lady Gaga doesn&apos;t fetch her own tampons:</strong> &#x201C;She might have said I need some tea, I need &#x2014; can you get my computer for me, can you get my phone, my battery is dead, I need a tampon, the toilet doesn&#x2019;t flush,&#x201D; O&#x2019;Neill said.</li>
	<li><strong>Lady Gaga is realistic about work hours...except when she&apos;s not:</strong> Gaga said in her deposition that all her employees work only an eight-hour day, noting, &#x201C;This job is a 9-to-5 job that is spaced out throughout the day.&#x201D; So on the one hand, &#x201C;You don&#x2019;t get a schedule that is like you punch in and you can play f--king Tetris at your desk for four hours and then you punch out at the end of the day.&quot; On the other other hand, &#x201C;I&#x2019;m not in any way discounting how hard an eight-hour work day can be, or discounting the role of an assistant.&#x201D; Because, &#x201C;an eight-hour workday could still be a very difficult workday, you know, if you&#x2019;re digging ditches or, you know, you&#x2019;re, you know, putting sealing on a roof, you know.&#x201D; So we&apos;re a bit confused: working for Lady Gaga is or is not harder than digging ditches?</li>
	<li><strong>Lady Gaga will not encourage your interest in tube tops:</strong> &#x201C;Not that people who do that don&#x2019;t deserve their hourly pay, but I&#x2019;m just pointing out that I deserve everything I&#x2019;ve worked for,&quot; Gaga said. &quot;I deserve every dollar of it. And she deserves every dollar of her $75,000 that we agreed to. But she does not deserve a penny more.&#x201D; Instead of paying O&apos;Neill, Gaga said she wants &quot;to give all the money that she wants to my employees that work hard for me now that deserve it. I&#x2019;m not going to give it to her so she can go to Intermix and buy herself a new tube top.&quot;</li>
	<li><strong>Lady Gaga doesn&apos;t like it when you embarrass her in front of Terry Richardson</strong>: Gaga noted that after she walked the runway at Thierry Mugler&#x2019;s fall 2011 fashion show, she and O&apos;Neill partied all night with Richardson and other socialites. The next day, when they had to fly back to America, O&#x2019;Neill insisted on sleeping in the second bed and &#x201C;completely, like, flipped out at me, beyond belief&#x201D; when &#x201C;I told her no.&#x201D; Gaga said: &#x201C;&#x2018;Jennifer, this is really inappropriate in front of Terry Richardson,&#x2019; and she was like, &#x2018;Don&#x2019;t I get some sort of seniority because I&#x2019;ve been here longer and I&#x2019;m your friend?&#x2019; &#x201D; That was probably the wrong thing to say: &quot;The first thing I thought was &#x2018;You&#x2019;re not my f--king friend,&#x2019; &#x201D; Gaga said.</li>
	<li><strong>Do Not Stare At Lady Gaga:</strong>&#x201C;Are you going to stare at me like a witch this whole time &#x2014; honestly?&#x201D; Gaga asked at the start of the deposition. &#x201C;Because this is going to be a long f--k ng day that you brought me here.&#x201D;</li>
