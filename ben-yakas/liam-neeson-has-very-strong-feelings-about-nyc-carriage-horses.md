<p>Mayor Bill de Blasio has promised to put an end to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150824042549/http://gothamist.com/tags/carriagehorses">New York City&apos;s horse and carriage industry</a> now that he&apos;s in office, siding with critics of the industry that charge the horses are forced to work long hours, squeeze into squalid living conditions, and navigate a dangerous traffic-congested environment. But there&apos;s one Northern Irish actor with a particular skill set; skills he has acquired over a very long career of making cinema about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150824042549/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1440129/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_16">board games</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150824042549/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0362269/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_44">sex researchers</a>. Skills that make him a nightmare for people who want to ban horse carriages. That would be Mr. Liam Neesons, of course.</p>

<p>Neeson has been a very <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150824042549/http://gothamist.com/2009/01/19/liam_neeson_hates_horses.php">passionate and outspoken advocate</a> of carriage horses in NYC for years, to the point that he has even claimed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150824042549/http://gothamist.com/2009/01/23/video_liam_neeson_would_live_in_nyc.php">he would live in their stables if he could</a>, if only society could accept Liam Neeson living in a horse stable. But in the meantime, Neeson is calling NY Post catlady-in-residence <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150824042549/http://gothamist.com/tags/andreapeyser">Andrea Peyser</a> up to coo in her ear about glue factories: &#x201C;They&#x2019;ll die, you know, darlin,&#x2019;&#x2009;&#x201D; Neeson <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150824042549/http://nypost.com/2014/01/10/liam-neeson-lambastes-call-to-ban-horse-drawn-carriages/">allegedly said to Peyser</a> in a real conversation they allegedly had with one another. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s criminal! This is an iconic, historic part of New York.&quot;  </p>

<p>&#x201C;The horses are incredibly well-treated. They&#x2019;re regulated up the wazoo. They get five weeks&#x2019; holiday every year,&quot; Neeson continued, assuming Neeson really did call Peyser, and this wasn&apos;t just one of those things where Peyser fell asleep while watching <em>Darkman</em>. &#x201C;Someone is going to take the horses in? To adopt the horses? Are they crazy? I don&#x2019;t think so! They&#x2019;ll go to the glue factory&#x2019;&#x2019; </p>

<p>Peyser has a hard time containing her glee over Neeson: she refers to him as a &quot;Hollywood badass,&quot; calls him a &quot;61-year-old heartthrob,&quot; says he has a &quot;gorgeous Northern Irish brogue,&quot; and declares <strong>&quot;the &#x201C;Schindler&#x2019;s List&#x2019;&#x2019; and &#x201C;Love, Actually&#x2019;&#x2019; star may be the last true Hollywood he-man.&quot;</strong> Neeson is no &quot;girly-boy,&quot; but rather a tough guy who doesn&apos;t live in NYC but counts carriage drivers among his closest friends and PETA is a bunch of evil sissies and only real men have the courage to love horses like men and Alec Baldwin is a nitwit and &quot;The Taken&quot; 1, 2 and 3 are really great movies about killing Europeans and   ...what? </p>

<p>Forget it Jake, it&apos;s Peysertown. </p>
