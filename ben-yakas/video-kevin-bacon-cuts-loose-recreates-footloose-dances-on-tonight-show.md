<p>Kevin Bacon took a break from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506143030/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09q04Dlh7r8">educating millennials about the &apos;80s</a> to recreate one of the defining cinematic moments of the &apos;80s for millennials who watch <em>The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon</em>. To celebrate the thirtieth anniversary of <em>Footloose</em>, Bacon performed a shot-for-shot recreation of scenes from the 1984 movie. Watch it below&#x2014;we&apos;re onboard with anything that gives Kenny Loggins another moment in the sun.</p>

<p>FYI, Bacon is being a good sport for Fallon, but if you happen to run into him at a wedding, maybe don&apos;t tell the DJ to play the song.</p>
