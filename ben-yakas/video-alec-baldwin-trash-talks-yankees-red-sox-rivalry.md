But maybe that means he&apos;ll have more time to root for the Yankees: New Era <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424153443/http://www.neweracap.com/en_US/Explore/mlb.aspx">launched</a> a new ad campaign in which Baldwin is a die-hard Yankees fan trash talking with John Krasinski, a die-hard Red Sox follower. Watch the video below:</p>

<p>Baldwin has the best line too: &quot;John, John, John, for the last time: this is not a rivalry. Just like fire doesn&apos;t have a rivalry with kindling. Lawnmowers don&apos;t have a rivalry with grass.  America doesn&apos;t have a rivalry with Costa Rica.&quot; For a soulless marketing campaign, it&apos;s pretty amusing! Also amusing: the utter panic spreading through Red Sox Nation after their dismal 1-7 start to this season. Even parents are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424153443/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/06/video_apparently_blood_is_not_thick.php">turning on</a> their children!</p>
