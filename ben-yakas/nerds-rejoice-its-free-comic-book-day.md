<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="5711comicbook.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110508064843im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/5711comicbook.jpg" width="250" height="386" class="image-left"> </span>The novel may be going the way of the Nook and the iPad, but there&apos;s still one form of larger-than-life storytelling which truly benefits from its physical incarnation: comic books! And today really is the greatest day to be a fan, or to dip your toes in the water of spandex-clad superheroes: it&apos;s the tenth annual <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110508064843/http://www.freecomicbookday.com/">Free Comic Book Day</a> (FCBD). Check out the introductory video below.</p>

<p>Marvel, DC and many of the other major imprints will be giving out free comic books all day as part of the annual promotional tradition. Among this years highlights are issues of <em>Green Lantern</em> and <em>Amazing Spider-Man</em>, a special team-up between Captain America and Thor called <em>Captain America/Thor: The Mighty Fighting Avengers</em> (a primer for/tie-in with the upcoming films), <em>Super Dinosaur</em>  written by <em>The Walking Dead</em> scribe Robert Kirkman, and all-new adventures for <em>Inspector Gadget</em> and <em>The Tick.</em> </p>

<p>As AV Club <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110508064843/http://www.avclub.com/articles/free-comic-book-day-offers-plenty-of-marvel-and-dc,55704/">points out</a>, the most intriguing/bizarre selection is <em>The Misadventures Of Adam West</em>, where the &#x201C;legendary star of the small and silver screen&#x2026;has his career youth-enized in this hip-whimsical, trans-dimensional epic of an adventure&quot; that eventually leads to Adam West saving the entire universe...hopefully in spandex. Oh, and be forewarned: his love life will also be irrevocably changed. Check out the full list <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110508064843/http://www.freecomicbookday.com/comics.asp">here</a>.</p>

<p>There will also be signings at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110508064843/http://www.jhuniverse.blogspot.com/">Jim Hanley&apos;s Universe</a> at W 33rd Street, and at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110508064843/http://www.brooklyncomicsandmore.com/">Brooklyn Comics and More, Inc.</a>, where noted author/illustrator Brian Wood will be appearing at noon. Here&apos;s the FCBD <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110508064843/http://www.freecomicbookday.com/fcbd_locator.asp">Store Locator</a> so you can see all the participating comic book stores. USA Today has some <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110508064843/http://content.usatoday.com/communities/popcandy/post/2011/05/free-comic-book-day-preview-my-top-10-comics/1">more info</a> for getting the most out of FCBD, including this pro-tip: &quot;Some shops will limit how many free comics you can take (and this is a bummer). Others won&apos;t carry the free books you&apos;re looking for. If your town has more than one comics shop, plan to visit them all.&quot;</p>
