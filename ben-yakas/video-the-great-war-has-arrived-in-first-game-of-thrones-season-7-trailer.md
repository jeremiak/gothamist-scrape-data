<p>Although we got <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170711004533/http://gothamist.com/2017/03/30/new_game_thrones_promo.php">a short teaser trailer</a> back in March, it feels like it&apos;s been an eternity since we last checked in with all of our favorite warring families and wargs from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170711004533/http://gothamist.com/tags/gameofthrones"><em>Game Of Thrones</em>.</a> But the wait is over, because winter is coming this summer and we now have our first look at new footage from the penultimate season seven. </p>

<p>The Lannister siblings are surrounded by enemies (and standing on a very bright map); Jon Snow attacks Littlefinger at one point (in what appears to be the tombs under Winterfell); Dany is setting up shop in Dragonstone; the Unsullied clash with Lannister troops; Dothraki soldiers show off their moves; there are glimpses of Theon Greyjoy, Melisandre, Arya, Sansa, Tyrion, Davos (still the voice of reason) and more (not to mention what appears to be Yara Greyjoy and Ellaria Sand making out); a very gross (possibly undead) hand reaching out; and lots of shots of dragons flying through the air. </p>

<p>July 16th is only seven and a half weeks (or 53 days) away. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170711004533/http://gothamist.com/tags/gameofthronespowerrankings">Game Of Thrones Power Rankings</a>, the only authoritative power rankings for the Seven Kingdoms (trust no imitators!), will return on July 17th.<br>
