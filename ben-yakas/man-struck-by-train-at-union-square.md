<p>A man was struck by a train in Union Square this morning. According to FDNY, the man was struck by a northbound R train just after 11:30 a.m. today; he has been transported to Bellevue Hospital in stable condition. It&apos;s unclear how he ended up on the tracks, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140206184412/https://twitter.com/jbchan/status/411901154302631936">witnesses say</a> he may have fallen onto the tracks: &quot;Someone fell on to the subway tracks at Union Square. Stunned and hoping for good news.&quot;</p>
