<p>This week, two teens <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150103062836/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/17/shoplifters_reportedly_arrested_fou.php">were allegedly shoplifting</a> at the Herald Square Victoria&apos;s Secret when police found a dead fetus in one of their bags. Tiana Rodriguez, 17, and Francis Estevez, 17, have both pleaded not guilty to charges of petit larceny and criminal possession of stolen property. Preliminary <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150103062836/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/18/teen_with_dead_fetus_in_bag_may_fac.php">autopsy reports state</a> the baby was born almost full-term and died of asphyxiation, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150103062836/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Victorias-Secret-Baby-Found-in-Bag-Asphyxiated-Sources-228374151.html">cop sources tell NBC</a> that it had fluid in its lungs and may have drowned. </p>

<p>Despite the fact that cop sources are telling multiple outlets about the autopsy report, the medical examiner&#x2019;s office officially states the cause of death is still under investigation; prosecutors likely won&apos;t increase the charges until the report is complete, which could take a few weeks. </p>

<p>The gravity of the situation wasn&apos;t lost on lawyers, as the two teens appeared in Manhattan Criminal Court yesterday for the shoplifting charges: &quot;I don&#x2019;t want to ignore the elephant in the room, but we are only arraigning the shoplifts...Shoplifting with a baby in her bag the entire time certainly suggests a little bit of difficulty following society&#x2019;s rules,&#x201D; assistant district attorney Robert Hettleman.</p>

<p>Rodriguez, who also has a two-year-old son, allegedly told cops she was only six-months-pregnant and that she miscarried on Wednesday; she added that she didn&apos;t know what to do with the fetus, which is why she was carrying it around at the Victoria&apos;s Secret on Thursday.</p>

<p>&quot;Right now, there&apos;s no proof that she facilitated the death of the baby,&quot; defense attorney Genay Ann Leitman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150103062836/http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2013/10/autopsy_of_fetus_found_in_shop.html#incart_river">told reporters</a>. &quot;She&apos;s a 17-year-old who just had a child die. It&apos;s pretty traumatic for anybody, kid or adult.&quot;</p>
