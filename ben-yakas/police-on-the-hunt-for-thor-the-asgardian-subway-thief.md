The suspect threatened the store manager on Tuesday night, holding his mystical <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131106215808/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thor_%28Marvel_Comics%29">Mjolnir</a> above his head in a threatening manner, and stole an undetermined amount of money. The suspect is described as a white male with light skin tone, approximately 6 feet tall, and 40-50 years old. He had long blonde hair and a blonde mustache.
