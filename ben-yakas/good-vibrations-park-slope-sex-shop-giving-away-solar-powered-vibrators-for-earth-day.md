<p>If you&apos;re anything like us, then nothing gets you hornier than reducing, reusing and recycling&#x2014;and there is no better day for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424164657/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendrophilia_(paraphilia)">dendrophiliacs</a> and the like than Earth Day, which is coming up next Tuesday. A Park Slope sex shop is getting into the spirit of the day by giving away some solar-powered vibrators. As the ad puts it: &quot;Now you can feel good about the planet while getting off.&quot;</p>

<p>Babeland Brooklyn, on Bergen Street, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424164657/https://www.eventbrite.com/e/earth-shattering-orgasms-for-earth-day-vibrator-giveaway-tickets-10847371781">will give away</a> the Solar Bullet (which normally costs $34) to the first 25 shoppers on Earth Day, starting at noon Tuesday. If you ride your bike to the store, you&apos;ll get a bonus BabeLube lubette to go with it. They add that you won&apos;t need to hand crank it (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424164657/http://instantrimshot.com/">Nailed It</a>) to get the Solar Bullet running&#x2014;it gives &quot;one hour of pleasure with a simple charge from the sun.&quot;</p>

<p>As one female colleague wondered idly, &quot;But where do you charge it? Outside??&quot; Babeland&apos;s Claire Cavanah <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424164657/http://www.brooklynpaper.com/stories/37/17/dtg-solar-powered-vibrators-2014-04-18-bk_37_17.html">told Brooklyn Paper</a>, &#x201C;Although you might want to keep it in a private area for charging, it also isn&#x2019;t immediately going to cause anyone to blush.&quot; Which is weird, because we were always under the impression that women were filled with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424164657/https://www.google.com/search?q=women+inner+light&amp;oq=women+inner+light&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0.1582j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;es_sm=91&amp;ie=UTF-8">an inner light</a> that shined brighter than a thousand suns.</p>
