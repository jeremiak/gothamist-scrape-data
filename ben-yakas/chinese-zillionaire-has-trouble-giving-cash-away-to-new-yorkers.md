<p>Kazillionaire Chen Guangbiao, who previously announced his far-fetched intentions <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425150258/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/08/chinese_zillionaire_who_wants_to_bu.php">to buy the NY Times,</a>  took out an ad in the New York Times last week <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425150258/http://gothamist.com/2014/06/18/chinese_billionaire_to_take_1000_de.php">promising lunch and $300</a> for &quot;1,000 poor and destitute Americans&quot; at the Loeb Boathouse restaurant in Central Park. To get the ball rolling on his plan, Guangbiao toured the neighborhood around Tribeca&#x2019;s New York City Rescue Mission on Tuesday, handing out $100 bills to random NYers. The only problem: NYers didn&apos;t want it.</p>

<p>Or at least one NYer, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425150258/http://nypost.com/2014/06/25/new-yorkers-reject-chinese-moguls-bid-to-give-them-100/">according to the Post</a>, really didn&apos;t want it: &quot;Like any New Yorker approached by a clueless smiling tourist, the man just put his head down and kept walking.&quot; It&apos;s unclear if other NYers also rejected his money, because Guangbiao seemingly only invited the Post on his charm offensive. There&apos;s no mention of anyone accepting the cash except for one busker.</p>

<p>Oh, and he did sing &quot;We Are The World&quot; with one homeless person. He has a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425150258/http://shanghaiist.com/2014/06/24/watch_chen_guangbiao_sings_we_are_t.php">thing for that song</a>, apparently.</p>

<p>&quot;The important thing to me is not the money I&#x2019;m donating, but to have people take notice of the plight of poor people,&#x201D; Chen told them through a translator. &quot;This, for me, is a journey of gratitude, not a journey of charity.&quot; If that is really true, then Guangbiao should reconsider his homeless cash plan: the rescue mission doesn&#x2019;t think he should hand out cash because many of the homeless diners have drug problems.</p>

<p>And if you&apos;re interested to learn more about Guangbiao, a recycling tycoon worth around $740 million <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425150258/http://www.businessinsider.com/chinese-recycling-tycoon-says-he-wants-to-buy-the-new-york-times-2013-12">according to Forbes</a>,  CNN has a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425150258/http://www.cnn.com/2014/06/25/world/asia/chen-guangbiao-profile/">big profile of him today.</a><br>
