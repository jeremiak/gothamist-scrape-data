<p>Have you ever passed by a basketball court and felt the urge to get in on a pickup game, but knew that you shouldn&apos;t because you&apos;re pretty sure that high schoolers could run laps around you at this point, and also you haven&apos;t played basketball since you were on the Junior Varsity team in middle school, and really that was more of an honorary position than one based on merit? If so, then you&apos;ll understand why the man in the video below nailing threes is a hero.</p>

<p>He writes about the video: &quot;Wherein I take over the game by hitting 4 consecutive three-pointers on a beautiful Sunday afternoon in Brooklyn, 2013. You can use this video in mix tapes as long as I&apos;m credited with on-screen caption of &apos;Roatti the White Tiger.&apos;&quot; Duly noted Roatti the White Tiger, duly noted.</p>
