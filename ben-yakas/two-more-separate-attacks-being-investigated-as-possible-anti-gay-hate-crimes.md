<p>This morning, it was reported that one of the men who accused Elmo puppeteer Kevin Clash of underage sex abuse last year <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429162845/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/01/elmo_sex_accuser_attacked_in_prospe.php">was attacked in Brooklyn this week</a> in what police say was another in a string of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429162845/http://gothamist.com/tags/hatecrime">recent hate crimes against gay people</a>. Police are investigating two OTHER separate attacks against gay men in Brooklyn and Queens that they believe were hate crimes as well. </p>

<p>According to police, a 49-year-old man was attacked in Jackson Heights around 4:15 a.m. on March 17th. Cops say the suspect punched the victim in the face while making anti-gay statements. The victim&apos;s face was bruised, and had redness and swelling on his lip. </p>

<p>In the second incident, a 27-year-old man was attacked on the J train in Williamsburg around 11:45 p.m. on Monday 26th. The victim was talking to another man when he was approached by the suspect who allegedly made anti-gay remarks; the suspect then punched him twice in the face, before retreating to another part of the train. </p>

<p>Anyone with information on either case should contact the Crime Stoppers hotline at 1-800-577-TIPS, or text CRIMES and then enter TIP577, or visit <a href="www.nypdcrimestoppers.com.">the Crime Stoppers website.</a></p>
