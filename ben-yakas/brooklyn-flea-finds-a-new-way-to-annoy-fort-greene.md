title: Brooklyn Flea Finds A New Way To Annoy Fort Greene
---

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:300px; "> <img alt="51111flea.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130317063558im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/51111flea.jpg" width="300" height="253"> <br> <i>Brooklyn Flea <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130317063558/http://www.flickr.com/photos/jglsongs/4513382514/">jglsongs&apos; flickr</a></i></div> The popular weekend market <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130317063558/http://gothamist.com/tags/brooklynflea">Brooklyn Flea</a> has not exactly endeared itself to all of Fort Greene&apos;s residents. Now, even though it only operates in the neighborhood on Saturdays (it&apos;s in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130317063558/http://gothamist.com/2010/12/16/flea.php">Williamsburg on Sundays</a>), some car owners are upset yet again with the bustling antique, clothes and food activity, because Flea <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130317063558/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/flea_bitten_locals_upset_that_arts_ZW3VJDnAqHNcZlxsx8HZuI?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">has asked the city</a> to reserve a loading zone for them...and that would take away precious free parking spaces!<p></p>

<p>Brooklyn Flea, which has operated in the schoolyard of Bishop Loughlin Memorial HS for four years, wants to set aside the entire south side of Lafayette Avenue from 7-10 a.m. and again from 5-8 p.m. so that the more than 150 vendors won&#x2019;t double-park when they set up and break down their booths. But at least 17 locals told Councilwoman Letitia James on Monday that that is asking too much of them: &#x201C;I live on this block, so why can&#x2019;t I park on my block?&#x201D; said Carolyn Mayers-Williams, who the Post slyly points out actually lives a bit further away near Carlton Avenue.</p>

<p>Even worse, residents opened up about their deepest, darkest fear...that they might be forced to park...in a garage! And it&apos;s not even like residents are getting anything out of the deal, like a unique cultural market in their backyard. Flea co-founder <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130317063558/http://gothamist.com/2008/04/04/jonathan_butler.php">Jonathan Butler</a> called parking the &quot;third rail of politics,&quot; and argued that a free space was a privilege, not a right (&quot;no one owns these spaces&quot;). He also said there&#x2019;s &#x201C;no silver bullet&#x201D; to fix the parking troubles in the neighborhood, and added, &#x201C;We are just trying to make life easier and safer.&#x201D; If you live in Fort Greene and want to take a side on the issues, Community Board 2 will address the matter  at their next meeting at St. Francis College on May 17 at 6 p.m. But everyone should try to stay calm and reasonable, because parking fights tend <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130317063558/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/04/dispute_over_parking_spot_ends_with.php">to escalate quickly.</a></p>
