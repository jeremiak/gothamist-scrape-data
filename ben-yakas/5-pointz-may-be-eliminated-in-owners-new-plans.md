<p>It could truly be the end for the iconic <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110307163131/http://gothamist.com/tags/5pointz">5 Pointz</a> graffiti mecca in Long Island City: the graffiti-caked artist space may soon be bulldozed and resurrected as high-rises, restaurants and retail stores.</p>

<p>The building&apos;s owner, developer Jerry Wolkoff, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110307163131/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2011/03/06/2011-03-06_spray_it_aint_so_redesign_may_nix_famed_5pointz_graffiti.html">told the News</a> that he met recently with city planning officials to discuss replacing it with two high-rise residential towers and up to 1,300 rental units. He also said his plans include a mix of shops and restaurants, a supermarket, an open-air concourse between the towers and a park, as well as a studio space for artists. Because Wolkoff&apos;s plans require the taller of the two high-rises to rise above 40 stories, it will require a special permit and likely a zoning change, which means the changes must be approved by the city&apos;s zoning and land-use review process. He expects to submit a formal proposal to the city in the next two weeks. </p>

<p>Back in 2009, jewelry designer Nicole Gagne was seriously injured during an external stairway collapse, which led to all the artists being forced <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110307163131/http://gothamist.com/2009/07/28/5_pointz.php">to vacate</a> the space. Wolkoff argues that his $300 million project would revitalize the area and provide for thousands of construction jobs: &quot;It is important for Long Island City, and it is important for Queens,&quot; he said. But artists are dismayed by the plans: <strong>&quot;If it were to happen, it would be no different than tearing down the MOMA or the Guggenheim.</strong> It is not just any other building with graffiti on it. It is the epicenter for graffiti artists from all over the world,&quot; said Jonathan Cohen, the founder of the 5Pointz collective.</p>
