<p>Hours after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151213045611/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/05/jimmy_mcmillans_rent_is_too_damn_lo.php">we spoke to</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151213045611/http://gothamist.com/tags/jimmymcmillan">Jimmy McMillan</a> about his current rent woes, a new clip has been put online showing our favorite former gubernatorial candidate waxing rhapsodic about some of his favorite things. The makers of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151213045611/http://www.damnthefilm.com/DAMN%21_the_film_the_rent_is_too_damn_high_movie.html"><em>Damn!</em></a>, the documentary on McMillan made during his rise-to-internet-fame last fall, released a deleted scene from the film today. In it, McMillan talks about his favorite rapper (Eminem), his favorite movie (<em>Deep Throat</em>&#x2014;&quot;I&apos;d like for every girl to practice that skill. If you&apos;ve got a man, treat him right!&quot;) and his unabashed appreciation for pot: <strong>&quot;Oh hell yeah. I was a pot-smoking motherf--er. You can tell everybody that.</strong>&quot; Watch the clip below:</p>

<p>And seeing as how three stories make a trend...the NY Times <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151213045611/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/08/05/complaints-that-rent-is-illegally-high-often-languish/">has a piece today</a> all about high rents, arguing that legitimate complaints that the rent is too high often gets ignored and swept under the rug. Amazingly, the damn paper gets through the whole damn story without once mentioning McMillan or the Rent Is Too Damn High Party. </p>
