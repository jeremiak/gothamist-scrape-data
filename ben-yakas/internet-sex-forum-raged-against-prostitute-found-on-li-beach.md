Police have talked to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110418215729/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/15/long_island_bones_arent_joel_rifkin.php">Joel Rifkin</a>, utilized <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110418215729/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/14/fbi_sends_in_spy_planes_to_search_f.php">spy planes</a>, and extended their investigation from Long Island to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110418215729/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/07/hunt_for_li_serial_killer_now_inclu.php">Atlantic City</a>. Now, there&apos;s been a strange new development in the case regarding one of the identified women: it seems that members of a Long Island internet sex forum <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110418215729/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2011/04/17/2011-04-17_internet_sex_forum_wanted_revenge_vs_long_island_hooker_later_murdered_dumped_in.html">discussed &quot;revenge&quot; plans</a> against her. <p></p>

<p>&quot;Humiliatrix69&quot;, a member of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110418215729/http://www.longislanderotic.com/">Longislanderotic.com</a>, claimed he had been &quot;suckered&quot; by hooker Amber Lynn Costello; he said he paid $200 for sex, only to be robbed by men who barged into her home. Other members of the website rallied around him, and vowed revenge in various ways. &quot;Italyrider&quot; asked for her address: &quot;No one from this board needs to be involved. I have friends who can take care of this s---.&quot; A self-declared ex-con known as &quot;Morrie&quot; wrote, <strong>&quot;Tell her we are all coming over there with baseball bats.&quot;</strong></p>

<p>The site&apos;s homepage says it is a place for &quot;escorts, adult entertainment, massage parlors, strip clubs, sex.&quot; Costello, a twice-divorced addict who also advertised her services on Craigslist and other sex websites, described herself as a &quot;Southern girl&quot; named &quot;Carolina,&quot; who was &quot;short, sexy &amp; a lot of fun&quot; on the site. She disappeared on Sept. 2 last year, eight weeks after Humiliatrix69 wrote about his experience. Her body was found and identified <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110418215729/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/24/all_bodies_found_on_li_beach_identi.php">in January</a>, along with three other prostitutes.</p>

<p>Costello&apos;s sister, Kimberly Overstreet, said her sister knew the risks of the job, and had arranged to meet a john on the day she disappeared. Joseph Palminteri, who lived across the street from Costello, described the chaotic scene at her house: &quot;It was always something. Lots of screaming. Lots of yelling. Lots of drugs. <strong>Sometime last July a naked man was banging on my door at 10 at night. He came from [Costello&apos;s] house. He was screaming: &apos;Don&apos;t let them kill me! He&apos;s going to kill me!&apos;&quot;</strong></p>

<p>Humiliatrix69 wrote at the time that he had wanted to be spiteful and get revenge, but chickened out in doing anything for real. After &quot;Morrie&quot; posted that no one would &quot;hear from those 2 girls anymore,&quot; Humiliatrix69 wrote, &quot;Thanks for all the help.&quot; However, the day the bodies were found and identified, Humiliatrix69 wrote, &quot;<strong>Hey, I posted my experience in frustration and anger cause I got ripped off, but I wouldn&apos;t wish death on no one. Hobbying [buying sex] is one thing, and [I] hate to say it ... karma is truly a b----.&quot;</strong></p>
