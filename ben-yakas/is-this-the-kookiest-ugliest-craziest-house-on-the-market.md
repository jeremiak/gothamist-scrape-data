<p>We have so many questions: how long has it looked like this? Who lived here before? How many bodies have been sewn into the walls? Is this the exact midway point between <em>Gilmore Girls</em> and <em>Grey Gardens</em>? Has David Lynch gotten into decorating along with transcendental meditation? Why are there random bits of rug randomly nailed into the floor? How many people have been driven insane in that attic space? And why can&apos;t I look at the photos while listening to extremely jazzy music to offset the deep creepiness (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170329171443/http://videos.era.com/24-brentwood-drive-avon-ct-06001/MLS-L10166749">oh wait, you can here!</a>).</p>

<p>Look, you could use your hard-earned money on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170329171443/http://gothamist.com/2016/08/12/lighthouse_for_sale_2016.php#photo-1">a lighthouse</a>, or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170329171443/http://gothamist.com/2014/10/28/buy_ct_town_and_save.php#photo-1">an abandoned town</a>, or even <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170329171443/http://gothamist.com/2014/12/18/greek_islands_bargains.php#photo-1">a Greek island</a>, and it would be a steal next to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170329171443/http://gothamist.com/tags/realestate">most NYC real estate prices.</a> But wouldn&apos;t you rather be living in a kitsch paradise that you could rent out to Ryan Murphy for the next season of <em>American Horror Story</em>?</p>
