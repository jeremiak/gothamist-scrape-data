<p>When he&apos;s not busy <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150527004721/http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-205_162-57577470/astronaut-chris-hadfield-shows-how-to-brush-your-teeth-in-space/">brushing his teeth</a>, demonstrating how <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150527004721/http://now.msn.com/chris-hadfield-astronaut-cries-in-space-to-show-tears-dont-fall">zero gravity affects tears</a>, or literally <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150527004721/http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-205_162-57578141/astronaut-chris-hadfield-shows-off-his-spacesuit-waltz/">waltzing in space</a>, Canadian Astronaut Chris Hadfield is taking beautiful photos of cities across the Earth from the International Space Station. Last month, he tweeted <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150527004721/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/26/photo_new_york_city_as_seen_from_sp.php">a beautiful photo of NYC at night,</a> lit up only by skyscrapers and the insignificant egos of a couple million straphangers. And in the last 24 hours, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150527004721/https://twitter.com/Cmdr_Hadfield/status/320675751580037120">he&apos;s tweeted</a> an equally beautiful new photo that shows what NYC looks like in the morning from space. </p>

<p>Hadfield tweeted: &quot;Tonight&apos;s Finale: Morning in NYC. Downtown Manhattan casts quite a shadow.&quot; If you haven&apos;t spent some time perusing the astronaut&apos;s surprisingly poetic Twitter feed, we suggest you do&#x2014;there are lots of other photos of places from space (for example, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150527004721/https://twitter.com/Cmdr_Hadfield/status/320854732870660096">this photo of a river</a> &quot;hiccups like a zipper on an old coat&quot;), as well as missives about zero gravity haircuts and days &quot;at the space spa.&quot; </p>
