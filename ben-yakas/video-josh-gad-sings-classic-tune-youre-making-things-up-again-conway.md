<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171023114318/http://gothamist.com/tags/kellyanneconway">Kellyanne Conway</a>, Trump&apos;s Minister Of Mistruths, got caught <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171023114318/http://gothamist.com/2017/02/03/kellyanne_conway_never_forge_it.php">in a strange situation last night</a> when she castigated the media for not covering the Bowling Green massacre, a despicable terrorist attack that never actually happened (much like Trump&apos;s massive inauguration crowds and Hillary Clinton&apos;s three million fraudulent votes&#x2014;hey, speaking of which, whatever happened to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171023114318/http://gothamist.com/2017/01/26/president_is_delusional_nbd.php">that investigation?</a>). The Internet had a lot of fun at her expense, but the best response to the Bowling Green mishegoss came via actor Josh Gad, who took to Twitter to sing a very catchy ditty called, &quot;You&#x2019;re Making Things Up Again Conway.&quot;</p>

<p>The song is so catchy and spot-on, we aren&apos;t even going to mention Gad&apos;s mustache. Okay, we&apos;re not going to mention it <em>again</em>. Here are all the lyrics:</p>

<blockquote>You&apos;re making things up again Conway
You&apos;re taking the truth and just adding bullshit
Be careful with what you say Conway
Because a lie is a lie

<p>You&apos;re making things up again Conway<br>
You&apos;re taking our language and vomiting horseshit<br>
Don&apos;t be a fibbing friend Conway<br>
Because your lies we despise</p>

<p>And just because you and your friends have no spleen<br>
It doesn&apos;t mean there is a real Bowling Green<br>
You lie on your talk shows, we fucking watch as your nose grows<br>
You&apos;re gonna get us killed with this stuff, ooh yeah! </p>

<p>You&apos;re making things up again Conway<br>
Oh Conway, shut up</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>You know who would really enjoy this melding of music and comic irreverence? Up and coming comedian/singer Kellyanne Fitzpatrick (see video below). But don&apos;t play it for modern day Kellyanne, she&apos;s liable <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171023114318/http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/kellyanne-conway-reportedly-punched-a-man-at-inaugural-ball.html">to punch someone.</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile, Conway is being a real special snowflake about her gaffe.</p>
