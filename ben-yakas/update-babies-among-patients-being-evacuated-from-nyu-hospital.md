<p>During his latest press conference on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425002855/http://gothamist.com/tags/hurricanesandy">Hurricane Sandy</a>, Mayor Bloomberg confirmed that NYU Hospital is without power, and they are currently in the process of evacuating patients. &quot;New York University Hospital&apos;s backup power, in spite of them assuring us that it&apos;s been tested, stopped working and we&apos;re working with them to help move people out,&quot; he said.</p>

<p>NYU Langone Medical Center&apos;s backup generator failed when <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425002855/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/29/lower_manhattan_loses_power_after_p.php">power went out in lower Manhattan</a> earlier this evening. ABC says there are 215 patients currently being taken out, many of whom are &quot;having trouble getting in contact with their families.&quot; An FDNY spokesman told us they assisted in transferring 45 critical patients to Mt. Sinai, and it appears as though they are dealing with non-critical patients now (along with babies).</p>

<p>According <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425002855/https://twitter.com/azipaybarah/status/263115140361244672">to WNYC,</a> Bellevue Hospital only &quot;has 2 hours of power left;&quot; FDNY didn&apos;t have any information currently about that. In addition, there were also reports that a fire had broken out on the third floor of Coney Island Hospital&#x2014;but the FDNY told us that they had responded to &quot;smoke conditions&quot;&#x2014;which were caused by a nearby car fire&#x2014;and found no injuries at the hospital.</p>

<p>&quot;We knew that this was going to be a very dangerous storm and the storm has met our expectations,&quot; Bloomberg also said tonight. &quot;The worst of the weather has come and the city is certainly feeling the impacts...The latest estimates show a quarter of a million customers without power.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: &quot;We are trying to move these patients as fast as possible. Hopefully in a number of hours,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425002855/https://twitter.com/ReuvenBlau/status/263125700549152768">said</a> Robert Grossman, Dean, NYU Medical Center. Patients are being taken to Sloan-Kettering in addition to Mt. Sinai. </p>

<p>Also, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425002855/https://twitter.com/WNYC/status/263119641692471298">according to reports</a>, Bellevue Hospital only has an hour of diesel fuel left for their generators&#x2014;they need 30 gallons per hour. It&apos;s unclear though whether they will attempt to bring fuel there, or start evacuating the hospital. We&apos;ll update as we learn more.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: There is now <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425002855/https://twitter.com/MichaelSkolnik/status/263136472180355072">an FDNY dispatch</a> calling for &quot;All available units responding to Bellevue Hospital for mass evacuation of all patients.&quot; </p>

<p><strong>Update 12:50 p.m.</strong>: There may not have been a fire there earlier this evening, but according to reports, they are definitely on backup generators now. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425002855/http://news.blogs.cnn.com/2012/10/30/superstorm-sandys-wrath/">CNN reports</a>, &quot;New York&#x2019;s Bellevue Hospital Center has flooded basement, using emergency backup power, but no injuries reported.&quot;</p>
