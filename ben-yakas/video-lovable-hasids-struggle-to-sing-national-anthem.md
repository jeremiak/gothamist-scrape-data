Everything that could go wrong does go wrong for the singers in the video below, who performed the national anthem at MCU park on Coney Island before the start of a friendly baseball game between the Flatbush Hatzolah and the NYPD earlier this week. Apparently none of them know the lyrics, so the lead guy whips them out on his smartphone&#x2014;this doesn&apos;t help the backup singers who just try to follow the melody line with pleasant mumbles. Then halfway through, someone has to stop them to let them know the mic isn&apos;t actually turned on. And yet, these troupers persevere. Hey, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131006151019/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/07/video_christina_aguilera_botches_na.php">it could have been worse.</a> </p>
