They started asking questions like: &quot;Level with me. Can a bedbug crawl from a theater seat into my coat?&quot; So they sat down with entomologist <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130705061728/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/23/bubonic_europe_in_your_bedroom_bed.php">Jeff White</a> of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130705061728/http://www.bedbugcentral.com/">BedBug Central</a> to ease their nerves. He told them that yes, bedbugs can crawl into your coat, but &quot;there&#x2019;s a little bit of a hysteria associated with these types of situations.&quot; They forgot to ask the most imporant question: Can I be infected if I share my espresso with a Puccini-lover? </p>
