This morning, Manhattan Republican Myers Mermel <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111212085405/http://www.nydailynews.com/blogs/dailypolitics/2010/05/mermel-for-governor.html">announced</a> that he has thrown his hat into the ring as a candidate for <strike>Jacob&apos;s position</strike> NY Governor. &#x201C;We all know how poorly our incumbents have fared, it is time to vote them out and for the people to have their voice heard. There is no secret to resolving our economic crisis, we must vote the current team out and start our reforms,&#x201D; he wrote on his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111212085405/http://myersmermel.com/">website</a>. Mmmm, <em>Mermel.</em><p></p>

<p>He came out with all guns blazing, bolstered by the results of a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111212085405/http://www.scribd.com/doc/31860667/R-Mermel-NY-Statewide-Survey-Executive-Summary">new poll</a> that shows him beating current Attorney General Andrew Cuomo two-to-one, and came to the conclusion that, &quot;Andrew Cuomo&#x2019;s role in the corrupt Eliot Spitzer and David Patterson administrations and his position as former Chairman of the federal department of Housing and Urban Development, or HUD, which shared significant responsibility in the sub-prime mortgage crisis, <strong>are weaknesses that a strong Republican candidate like Myers Mermel can exploit in the general election</strong>.&quot; Of course, a new <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111212085405/http://polhudson.lohudblogs.com/2010/05/24/cuomo-maintains-big-lead-gillibrands-support-grows-poll/">Sienna College poll</a> released today contradicts all that, showing Cuomo trouncing his three other Republican opponents, Rick Lazio, Carl Paladino and Steve Levy, by over 40 points. It&apos;s comforting to know Mermel is getting into the race with <em>completely realistic expectations.</em></p>

<p>Merman, a conservative real estate businessman, announced back in April he was running for Lieutenant Governor, with a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111212085405/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/29/mike_huckabee_endorses_ny_lt_gov_ca.php">video endorsement</a> from Mike Huckabee, where he calls him &quot;Governor-ready.&quot; (You can see video below)</p>
