<p>The Flaming Lips are never content to just rest on their discarded bunny-suits and plastic bubbles, not when there are new people being born every day who are just waiting to have their world-views smashed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509173233/http://www.avclub.com/articles/falling-out-of-love-with-the-flaming-lips,81348/">with naked music videos</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509173233/http://www.nme.com/news/the-flaming-lips/72999">explicit Instagram accounts.</a> To further their goal of bringing acid-tinged psychedelic pop to the masses, the Lips enlisted Yoko Ono to perform with them on <em>Late Show with David Letterman</em> last night, which you can see below. </p>

<p>Leave it to Letterman to perfectly sum up their performance of Ono&apos;s anti-war song &#x201C;Chesire Cat Cry:&#x201D; <strong>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s fun when you leave the theater humming the music from the show.&#x201D; </strong></p>

<p>But wait, that&apos;s not all: Ono also showed up at Terminal 5 last night to join the band during their headlining set (following performances by Sean Lennon&apos;s band The Ghost of a Saber Tooth Tiger and the excellent Australian group Tame Impala). </p>

<p>Hey, regardless of her speak-singing atonality, credit where credit&apos;s due: you would be lucky to be half as cool as Ono when you hit 80.</p>
