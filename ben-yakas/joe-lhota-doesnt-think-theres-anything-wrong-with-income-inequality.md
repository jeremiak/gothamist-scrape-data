title: Joe Lhota Doesn't Think There's Anything Wrong With Income Inequality

<p>Despite losing his cool during the mayoral debate this week, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203044848/http://gothamist.com/tags/joelhota">Joe Lhota</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203044848/http://nypost.com/2013/10/24/joe-lhota-im-back/">sounded re-energized</a> (and perhaps a bit delusional) about his chances to win the election. He&apos;s been on a <strike>charm</strike> fear offensive ever since, painting Bill de Blasio as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203044848/http://politicker.com/2013/10/joe-lhota-expounds-on-his-true-fear-of-what-bill-de-blasio-will-do-to-the-city/">the first horseman of the apocalypse.</a> And that included dismissing any notions that income inequality was a problem in NYC. Hmmmmmmmm <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203044848/http://gothamist.com/tags/bloomberg">who does this remind of us</a>?</p>

<p>On <em>Morning Joe</em> yesterday, Lhota acknowledged that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203044848/http://gothamist.com/tags/incomeinequality">income inequality</a> is a real thing, but he doesn&apos;t understand what the big deal is: &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t think it&#x2019;s a problem, it exists,&#x201D; he said. According <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203044848/http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/income-inequality-isnt-problem">to MSNBC</a>, he said you could &#x201C;deal with it&#x201D; by having a mayor who supports a growing economy that helps everyone get good jobs. &#x201C;Bill de Blasio doesn&#x2019;t have a job creation program, in fact I think he has a job destruction program, he wants to raise taxes in the city,&#x201D; Lhota said.</p>

<p>Of course, Bloomberg has been a mayor who has strongly supported a growing economy (especially in tech and construction areas)...and look where that got us. Regardless of whether you like de Blasio, he has turned the issue of income inequality into one of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203044848/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/15/de_blasio_keeps_beating_up_defensel.php">most important points</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203044848/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/13/plutocrats_tired_of_de_blasios_cute.php">of his campaign</a>, and started a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203044848/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/19/nyregion/poverty-rate-in-city-rises-to-21-2.html?_r=0">much-needed conversation</a> about the shrinking middle class, the increasing poverty rate, and lack of affordable housing. </p>

<p>And de Blasio&apos;s message has clearly struck a chord with voters (hence the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203044848/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/22/de_blasio_leads_lhota_by_44_points.php">40+ point lead</a>), but hey, Lhota doesn&apos;t think it&apos;s a big deal. And as a result, he sounds a lot like Bloomberg, who thinks homelessness is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203044848/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/19/bloomberg_thinks_homelessness_is_go.php">a &quot;good sign&quot; of a vibrant economy</a> and taking <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203044848/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/07/bloomberg_calls_bill_de_blasio_camp.php">money away from bankers is mean.</a> This is as good a reminder as any that one should never go full-Bloomberg&#x2014;although the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203044848/http://gothamist.com/tags/rudygiuliani">alternative isn&apos;t much better either.</a><br>
