<p>Donald Trump&apos;s uncomfortably comfortable relationship (or aspirational relationship) with Russia has made much of the country squirm&#x2014;or as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021162413/http://gothamist.com/tags/johnoliver">John Oliver</a> put it last night, &quot;It&apos;s a bit weird that you&apos;ve been objectively nicer to Vladimir Putin than you have to Meryl Streep.&quot;</p>

<p>Oliver dove into Trump&apos;s weirdly cozy feelings with Putin on the latest episode of <em>Last Week Tonight</em>, first documenting many of Putin&apos;s alleged dirty deeds (stole billions of dollars, assassinated his opponents, imprisoned protesters, signed anti-gay legislation) and his ability to manipulate the media to his advantage and turn himself into a folk hero: &quot;Putin has carefully created an atmosphere in Russia that is extremely hostile to any opposition,&quot; Oliver said. &quot;Standing up to him could mean being targeted by trolls, and not just on the Internet: When Garry Kasparov spoke at a political opposition event, he was interrupted, and this is true, but radio-controlled flying dildos.&quot;</p>

<p>He explained why Trump&apos;s continued insistence that &quot;getting along better&quot; with Russia would be a &quot;good thing&quot; might actually not be good. And Oliver then stepped in to launch a vigorous defense of America against Trump&apos;s own anti-American statements: &quot;Trump is basically the propagandist of Putin&apos;s dreams, and who knows why he&apos;s acting this wa.,&quot; he said. &quot;Maybe he&apos;s compromised, maybe he&apos;s an idiot, but since the President of the United States won&apos;t stick up for this country, I will: America and Russia are not the fucking same.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Don&apos;t get me wrong: America has had, and continues to have, endemic problems that need fixing; that might as well be the title of this show,&quot; Oliver <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021162413/http://www.rollingstone.com/tv/news/see-john-olivers-warning-to-trump-about-vladimir-putin-w467846">continued</a>. &quot;But hold on though, because our elections have some flaws, but they are not rigged. Our human rights record is far from perfect, but it does not compare to Putin&apos;s Russia.&quot; Watch below as Oliver uses some shitty but catchy techno music to educate Trump on the dangers of Putin.</p>

<p>In the first segment of the night, Oliver also explained how the miasma of daily Trump news has drowned out tons of bizarre and important stories: &quot;We begin this evening with President Trump, two words that will always sound unnatural together, like &#x2018;fuckable clown&#x2019; or &#x2018;Wolf Blitzer,&apos;&quot; Oliver said. &quot;And the reason we have to start with him is Trump dominates the news cycle the way a fart dominates the interior of a Volkswagen Beetle: there is simply no escape from him.&quot;</p>
