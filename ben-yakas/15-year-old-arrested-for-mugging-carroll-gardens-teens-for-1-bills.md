<p>A Brooklyn teen was arrested for going on a three day mugging spree last week&#x2014;a spree during which he allegedly only demanded $1 from each of his victims. Police say that the 15-year-old suspect, whose name has not been released, robbed at least six kids between the ages of 12-16 between Monday and Wednesday last week in Carroll Gardens. </p>

<p>In all of the incidents, the suspect flashed a knife on the teens and tweens and demanded $1 from each victim. The suspect was unsuccessful in four of the incidents; he ended up netting $12 from a 13-year-old victim, and the wallet of a 14-year-old (it&apos;s unclear how much money was in the wallet).
