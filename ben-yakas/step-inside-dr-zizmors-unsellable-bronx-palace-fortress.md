</div></div>					<p>Dr. Zizmor&apos;s advertising chokehold over the NYC mass transit system has been one of the singular achievements of the late 20th century. Regardless of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150812213402/http://gothamist.com/2014/04/11/dr_zizmor.php">what he looks like now</a>, Zizmor will always appear in our dreams straight outta 1993, with his jolly, almond-esque disembodied visage floating along a wave of oddly-saturated rainbows. But just because he&apos;s ubiquitous in the subways doesn&apos;t mean he doesn&apos;t have Normal Wealthy People problems, too&#x2014;and one of those problems apparently involves his palatial estate in The Bronx.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150812213402/http://ny.curbed.com/archives/2014/05/13/inside_the_unsellable_home_of_nycs_ubiquitous_dr_zizmor.php">As Curbed points out</a>, Zizmor&apos;s 6,332-square-foot Mediterranean Revival mansion in Fieldston has been on the market for almost two years with no buyers. The expansive home, which was built in 1928 by architect Dwight James Baum, contains seven bedrooms, six-and-a-half baths, a loggia, a sunken living room, and the &quot;remarkable architectural detail of a bygone era.&quot; </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150812213402/https://streeteasy.com/house/5021-iselin-avenue-bronx#tab_building_detail=1">According to Street Easy</a>, it was initially put on the market for $4.3 million in June 2012, although it&apos;s since been lowered to $3.9 million &quot;off-market,&quot; which we assume means Zizmor has been hocking it in Times Square alongside those comedy festival guys, or something. But money should be no question in the face of a piece of living NYC history. Based on his dermatological expertise, we&apos;d wager that indoor fountain doesn&apos;t just contain regular tap water. </p>
