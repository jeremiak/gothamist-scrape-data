										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="62412mets.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426153551im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/62412mets.jpg" width="250" height="188" class="image-left"> </span>There&apos;s no denying that the Mets are having a lot of fun this season&#x2014;following closer Frank Francisco comments calling the Yankees &quot;chickens,&quot; pitcher Tim Byrdak <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426153551/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/23/mets_reliever_takes_trash_talking_s.php">bought an $8 live chicken in Chinatown</a> and brought it to the clubhouse before Friday night&apos;s game as a practical joke. &#x201C;I told [Francisco] the Yankees sent it over for him. He had a look of concern,&#x201D; Byrdak said. &quot;Everyone got a good chuckle out of it.&quot; Initially, the bird was called &quot;Little Derek Jeter.&quot; But the team <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426153551/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/queens/good_cluck_charm_aP6cNOawQoF1SHNF5EfrWL?utm_source=SFnewyorkpost&amp;utm_medium=SFnewyorkpost">finally settled on naming it</a> after the toughest cockfighting rooster on the Upper West Side: Little Jerry Seinfeld. </p>

<p>The name is an homage to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426153551/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Little_Jerry">eighth season episode</a> of <em>Seinfeld</em> when Kramer buys a rooster and names it after Jerry. Seinfeld, a huge Mets fan in real life as well as on the show, told the Post he appreciated the gesture, but &#x201C;As much as I enjoy the Byrdak humor, he should be aware Little Jerry Seinfeld is no chicken.&#x201D; Check out video of the Mets bird in the clubhouse below.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it isn&apos;t quite feasible for the team to keep Little Jerry Seinfeld around for much longer. Instead, Byrdak <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426153551/http://espn.go.com/new-york/mlb/story/_/id/8090735/new-york-mets-find-home-tim-byrdak-chicken-little-jerry-seinfeld">will give the chicken to Farm Sanctuary</a> (in upstate Watkins Glen) in a ceremony outside the Mets clubhouse at 6 p.m. on Sunday. &quot;He&apos;s a very lucky bird, luckier than the rest of the market and the others who suffer,&quot; Farm Sanctuary spokesperson Meredith Turner said. &quot;We couldn&apos;t be more thrilled. Tim contacted us and made sure this bird would be able to enjoy the life that all chickens deserve.&quot;</p>
