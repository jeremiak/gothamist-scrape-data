<p>By Saturday, the second-to-last piece <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507075109/http://gothamist.com/tags/banksy">Banksy</a> put up in NYC&#x2014;a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507075109/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/30/photo_banksys_new_piece_is.php#photo-1">big cat across from Yankee Stadium in The Bronx</a>&#x2014;had been completely painted over.</p>

The message has silver paint over it, but with the right light, you can still make out some of the letters. </li>
</ul> 

<p>Of course, some of these pieces may disappear forever tomorrow, so take all this with a grain of salt (and let us know if one of them is gone). Lastly, a special thanks to Nic Garcia, Robert Dunning and Scott Lynch for all their help scavenging and photographing during the month of Banksy.</p>
