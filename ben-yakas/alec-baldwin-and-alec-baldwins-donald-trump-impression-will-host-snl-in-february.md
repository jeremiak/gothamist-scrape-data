<p>A lot of people were rightfully perplexed as to why <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170325192050/http://gothamist.com/tags/alecbaldwin">Alec Baldwin</a> wasn&apos;t on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170325192050/http://gothamist.com/tags/snl"><em>Saturday Night Live</em></a> this weekend, parodying the inauguration or Trump&apos;s first <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170325192050/http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/trumps-vainglorious-affront-to-the-c-i-a?reload">disastrous moments</a> as president. But maybe he just wanted to save up some material, since SNL announced today that Baldwin will host on February 11th (with musical guest, and human personification of the &quot;friendzone,&quot; Ed Sheeran). </p>

<p>If this means there&apos;s a chance Baldwin might portray Trump in the entire episode&#x2014;or even better, if they had a sketch with Baldwin-as-Trump re-enacting <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170325192050/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/11/snl_trump_reality_tv.php">Trump&apos;s disastrous SNL episode</a> (never forget just how much SNL has been trying to make up for that ever since)&#x2014;it would be must-see-TV. And even if they just have one or two Trump sketches, there&apos;s still a decent chance Trump might have an aneurysm while drafting tweets from the POTUS account.</p>

<p>Although Baldwin had been non-committal about whether or not he would continue doing his Trump impression on SNL after the election, he recently made it clear that he&apos;s going to keep popping up on SNL <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170325192050/http://gothamist.com/2017/01/11/alec_baldwin_considering_performing.php">for the foreseeable future</a> (and possibly perform his impression elsewhere). It&apos;s a good thing too, since Baldwin has seemingly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170325192050/http://gothamist.com/2016/12/04/again_snl_mocks_donald_trumps_tweet.php">gotten under Trump&apos;s skin</a> like no one else, prompting countless Twitterspasms from the president. Perhaps this is partially because Trump once actively <em>wanted</em> Baldwin to portray him&#x2014;be careful what you wish for.</p>

<p>Baldwin has hosted the show 16 times before, and holds the record for most times hosting. Before he gets his crack at number 17, Kristen Stewart will host SNL on February 4th with musical guest Alessia Cara. </p>
