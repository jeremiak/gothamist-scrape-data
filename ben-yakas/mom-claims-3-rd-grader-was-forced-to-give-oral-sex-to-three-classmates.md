<p>A Harlem mom claims in a lawsuit that her 8-year-old son was forced to perform oral sex on three other elementary school kids in a public school bathroom last year. The mother, whose name is being withheld, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130807022244/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/boy-forced-perform-oral-sex-male-classmates-article-1.1359299">tells the Daily News</a> that last March Public School 194 principal Josephine Bazan said, &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t know how to explain this to you, but your son was in the bathroom and was forced to perform oral sex on three boys.&quot; </p>

<p>According to the lawsuit, the third grader had just finished lunch and was in a hallway waiting for class to start when a fifth-grader and two other third-graders pushed him into a bathroom stall as he pleaded for help. The victim claims one kid held his hands behind his back while the other forced him onto his knees. &#x201C;When I was going on line three kids drag me to the bathroom and they pull down there (sic) pants,&#x201D; the lawsuit says he wrote in a statement to the school. &#x201C;I told them no but they didn&#x2019;t listen to me.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Cops arrested the two third-graders at the school on sexual misconduct charges. The fifth-grader was arrested on the same charges later at the precinct, the lawsuit says. But the mother of the victim is suing the DOE for $6 million because of &#x201C;emotional and psychological anguish,&#x201D; and for failing to alert parents and authorities that the fifth grader&#x2014;who was considered the &quot;ringleader&quot;&#x2014;had a history as a &#x201C;sexual deviant.&#x201D;</p>

<p>That student had been accused of touching a third-grade girl under her skirt during a reading class during the 2009/2010 school year, according to a separate lawsuit filed by the girl&apos;s mother. In that lawsuit, then principal Charyn Koppelson is accused of not punishing the student, and essentially covering up the incident: &#x201C;She said, &#x2018;He&#x2019;s just a kid,&#x2019;&#x201D; the girl&#x2019;s mom told the News. &#x201C;(The incidents) were never placed in the system at all.&#x201D;</p>
