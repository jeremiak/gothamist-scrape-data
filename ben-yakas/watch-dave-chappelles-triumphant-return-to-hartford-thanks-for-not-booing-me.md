<p>One year ago, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424160351/http://gothamist.com/tags/davechappelle">Dave Chappelle</a> came up against one of the toughest crowds of his career in the rough-and-tumble town of Hartford, Connecticut. After being <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424160351/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/30/videos_dave_chappelle_relentlessly.php">showered with a barrage of boos and heckles</a>, Chappelle gave up performing and walked off stage, vowing to never return to the &quot;evil&quot; city filled with &quot;young, white alcoholics.&quot; But a year is a long time, and Chappelle made a surprise return to Hartford last night to clear the air: &#x201C;I did not think I would ever come back to Hartford,&#x201D; Chappelle said to the enthusiastic crowd. &#x201C;It was a year ago tonight, I had 364 nights to think about that fatal night, one year ago...I was really immature about what happened.&#x201D; Watch his full 16 minute set below.</p>

<p>How exactly was he immature? &quot;Right after I left, I&#x2019;m sorry I did this, I made t-shirts that said &apos;Fuck Hartford,&apos;&quot; he continued. &quot;I&#x2019;m sorry I did that. And I hate to tell you that they were very good sellers. I got a lot of Internet orders, from Hartford, that was a surprise.&#x201D; Although he claims he didn&apos;t prepare for this show, he (hilariously) recounts everything that happened after that fateful show. </p>

<p>Chappelle performed in Chicago the night after the Hartford incident, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424160351/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/05/video_dave_chappelle_really_hates_h.php">said at the time</a>: &quot;I don&apos;t want anything bad to happen to the United States,&quot; Chappelle said, &quot;but if North Korea ever drops a nuclear bomb on this country, I swear to God I hope it lands in Hartford, Connecticut.&quot; </p>

<p>Chappelle apologized for that joke to the crowd around the five minute mark&#x2014;but he didn&apos;t have to worry about that too much, since this crowd was completely on his side during the show, laughing heartily and never booing him. &quot;Are you sure this is Hartford?&quot; he says around the seven minute mark. &quot;I swear to God I thought you were going to boo me the minute I came out,&#x201D; Chappelle said. &quot;Boy I wish you guys were here last year. This city is schizophrenic. It&apos;s like a whole new city from last year.</p>

<p>He ended the show with one last appeal: &quot;Since that fateful night last year I&#x2019;ve done 150 shows,&quot; he said. &quot;All of them went well. And I say that to say this, in case the media&#x2019;s watching: it was your fault...But thanks for not booing me when I came out.&quot;</p>
