<p>Many moon ago, the NY Post caught wind that a rehabilitating Derek Jeter had packed on a few extra pounds, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426153206/http://gothamist.com/2012/11/30/ny_post_fat-shames_husky_derek_jete.php">dubbing him &quot;Derek Eater&quot; on their front page.</a> Jeter is pretty much the most beloved man in baseball and a NYC institution, so we can only imagine what the dailies will make of the above photo of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426153206/http://gothamist.com/tags/arod">most hated man in baseball.</a></p>

<p>It&apos;s entirely possible that, like the Jeter photo, it&apos;ll turn out the extra paunch was just a bad photo angle taken at exactly the wrong time. Then again, with A-Rod sitting out the next season <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426153206/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/11/a-rod_banned_from_baseball_for_enti.php">thanks to his suspension</a>, there&apos;s nothing really stopping him from stretching out and really nesting, ya know? And more importantly, it doesn&apos;t matter, because <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426153206/http://theweek.com/article/index/248364/a-brief-history-of-why-everyone-hates-alex-rodriguez">everyone hates him</a> and people just want an excuse to ridicule him. The medium is the message ergo <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426153206/http://deadspin.com/derek-jeter-gossip-we-desperately-want-to-believe-1466653210">YEAH JEETS.</a></p>

<p>So what new nickname will this earn him? Fat-Rod? Dough-Rod? Tub-Rod? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426153206/http://deadspin.com/fat-a-rod-fat-a-rod-1501995520">Cake-Rod</a>? </p>
