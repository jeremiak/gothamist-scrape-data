<p>Thanks to the efforts of topless activists such as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504141019/http://gothamist.com/tags/hollyvanvoast">Holly Van Voast</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504141019/http://gothamist.com/tags/moirajohnston">Moira Johnston</a>, New Yorkers (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504141019/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/15/cops_told_not_to_arrest_topless_wom.php">and the NYPD</a>) are now well aware that all people are legally allowed to go topless on the streets of NYC (so long as their flesh doesn&apos;t incite a riot). It seems Johnston is expanding her awareness campaign to other cities as well, as you can see in the video below.</p>

<p>This isn&apos;t <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504141019/http://philly.curbed.com/archives/2012/07/03/topless-new-yorker-does-her-boob-thing-on-south-street.php">the first time</a> that Johnston, who is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504141019/http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/what_happened/Shes-Topless-Shes-Ours-SoProud-.html">originally from the suburbs of Philadelphia</a>, has strut her stuff around one of our <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504141019/http://gothamist.com/tags/philadelphia">sixth boroughs</a>. A person claiming to be a Philadelphia police officer commented on her actions on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504141019/http://www.philadelphiaspeaks.com/forum/queen-village-bella-vista-hawthorne/31257-topless-activist.html">message board Philadelphia Speaks</a>, saying: &quot;It is legal in Philadelphia. They made a few phone calls to the Law Department and as long as she isn&apos;t inciting a riot, a female walking around topless is legal.&quot; </p>

<p>The officer added that the first thing officers were told was, <strong>&quot;Don&apos;t take any pictures. Or at least don&apos;t get photographed taking pictures.&quot;</strong></p>

<p>For more things Moira, you can learn more about what spurred her to start her awareness campaign as she walks around Union Square in the video below.</p>
