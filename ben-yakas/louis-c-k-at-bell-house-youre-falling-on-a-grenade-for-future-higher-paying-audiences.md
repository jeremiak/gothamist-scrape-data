<p>Recently, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405204458/http://gothamist.com/2012/08/25/no_louis_ck_will_not_get_dressed_up.php">Chris Rock commented</a> that after toiling in the comedy salt mines for most of his career, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405204458/http://gothamist.com/tags/louisck">Louis C.K.</a> has hit his &quot;sweet spot.&quot; That was readily on display last night at the Bell House, as C.K. tested out over an hour&apos;s worth of new material at three last-minute shows in anticipation of his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405204458/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/26/louis_cks_tour_tickets_are_45_flat.php">big fall tour</a>. &quot;I apologize in advance for this show. That&apos;s why you paid $10 in Brooklyn,&quot; C.K. told the packed crowd at the 11 p.m. show. &quot;You are falling on a grenade for future, higher paying audiences.&quot;</p>

<p>After a brief but welcome warm up from Todd Barry (who lamented the drama of Yelp reviews), C.K. dominated the stage, lumbering and lithe at the same time, for a very sweaty 70 minutes. Without giving away too much, C.K.&apos;s new material doesn&apos;t let down in the least: there were riffs on Nixon breaking down, the joy of sitting on chairs, going to see <em>Prometheus</em> 3D stoned, cheating on spouses through corporate technology, and of course, lots of dead children jokes. There were brief Ron Paul impressions, ridiculous old lady voices, and a set closing bit that is one of the funniest things he&apos;s ever come up with.</p>

<p>C.K. obviously had a blast, and even came back for a rare, brief encore after much applause, at which point he was heckled by someone who knows him from his neighborhood: &quot;That is a perfectly legitimate heckle,&quot; he dryly noted. Check out some Twitter reactions (and Hipster Grifter appearances) below:</p>
