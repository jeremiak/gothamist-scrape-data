<p>There are a couple of important things to be gleaned from the video below. One is that you clearly don&apos;t want to start a fight on the subway in full view of a cop&#x2014;you probably shouldn&apos;t start <em>any</em> fights on the subway if you can help it (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150513081543/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/18/video_subway_spaghetti_spat_sparks.php">spaghetti scuffles</a> are an exception), but especially not when a cop is trying to mind his own business in the corner of the J train.</p>

<p>But just as importantly, you don&apos;t want to be like these guys taking video of the fight&#x2014;the ones laughing like hyenas and snorting in front of the camera because OMG BRO TWO WOMEN ARE FIGHTING AHHHHH, isn&apos;t that the craziest thing ever Bro?!? I suppose we should be grateful they didn&apos;t yell &quot;World Star&quot; incessantly, but if you can go through your daily life not acting like any of the people in this video, then you&apos;re already doing something right. <br>
