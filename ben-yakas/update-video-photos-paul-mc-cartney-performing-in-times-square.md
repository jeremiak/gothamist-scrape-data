<p>After he charmed a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502140024/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/09/paul_mccartney_playing_at_a_high_sc.php">Queens high school</a> with a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502140024/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/paul-mccartney-surprises-queens-high-school-with-auditorium-rock-show-20131009">13-song-set yesterday</a>, Sir Paul McCartney <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502140024/https://twitter.com/PaulMcCartney/status/388331639027548160">just announced</a> that he will be performing at Times Square this afternoon. &quot;Wow! Really excited to be playing New York Times Square at 1pm this afternoon!&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502140024/http://gothamist.com/tags/paulmccartney">Macca</a> tweeted. </p>

<p>It shouldn&apos;t be raining until after 3 p.m., so we&apos;d highly recommend taking a long lunch break, head over to 46th and Broadway immediately, and enjoy this Macca surprise. </p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: The show&apos;s over, but you can see some photos and videos of McCartney performing in Times Square this afternoon&#x2014;his stage is on a giant truck! (Which Phishlosopher John Del Signore notes was first done by Phish) We can definitely hear clips of three songs from his forthcoming record, including &quot;New,&quot; &quot;Everybody Out There&quot; and &quot;Save Us.&quot;</p>
