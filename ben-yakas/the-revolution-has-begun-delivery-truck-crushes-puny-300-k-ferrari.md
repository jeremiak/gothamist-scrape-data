<p>Bill de Blasio has been mayor for negative three days, and already he&apos;s enacting his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504134341/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/04/ask_a_native_new_yorker_2.php">radical pinko-commie agenda</a> with ruthless efficiency. A delivery truck driver accidentally backed into a $300,000 Ferrari FF on Columbus Avenue near West 69th Street in Manhattan on Halloween eve, crushing an emblem of prosperity. No word yet on whether this &quot;accident&quot; was caused by the increased supervision of stop-and-frisk tactics.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504134341/http://photoblog.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/10/31/21264812-300k-ferrari-run-over-by-delivery-truck-backing-up">According to NBC</a>, the driver of the Baldor Foods, Inc. truck told bystanders he &#x201C;didn&#x2019;t see nothing&#x201D; as he put the truck in reverse. After the incident, a traffic cop added insult to injury by placing a summons for double parking under the windshield of the crushed Ferrari. If ever NYC needed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504134341/http://gothamist.com/tags/rudygiuliani">a hero</a> to step up and defend the disenfranchised enfranchised, now would be the time.</p>
