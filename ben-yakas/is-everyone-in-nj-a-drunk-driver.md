<p>New Jersey drivers already have to deal with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508235625/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/07/jerseys_jitney_drivers_love_faceboo.php">less-than-sterling reputations</a>&#x2014;it&apos;s not a joke that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508235625/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yyuun4O9Ko0">&quot;go back to Jersey&quot;</a> is a normal thing that&apos;s said multiple times a day in NYC. But even hardened Jerseyans might be embarrassed and/or impressed that a rare drunk driving hat trick was achieved in NJ this week. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508235625/http://www.nj.com/hunterdon-county-democrat/index.ssf/2013/12/both_drivers_called_to_pick_up.html">According to the Hunterdon County Democrat</a>, 34-year-old Carmen Reategui was arrested for driving while under the influence of alcohol around 1:45 a.m. last Monday. So far so normal&#x2014;then she called Nina Petracca, 23, for a ride. While officers were explaining the potential liability form to her, they realized she &quot;displayed signs of intoxication.&quot; She was also arrested on a DUI charge.</p>

<p>Then both women called Ryan Hogan, 33, to pick them up. And guess what: as officers were once again explaining the potential liability form to her, they smelled alcohol on his breath as well. He was charged with DWI. Eventually, all three drivers were &quot;released to a sober adult.&quot; So three out of four NJ residents are drunk drivers, cool.</p>
