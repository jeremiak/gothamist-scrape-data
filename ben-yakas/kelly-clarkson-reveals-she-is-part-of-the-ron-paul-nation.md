<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none" style=" width:640px; "> <img alt="122911paul.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120104084904im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/122911paul.jpg" width="640" height="453"> <br> <i>Since You&apos;ve Been Ron Paul (AP)</i></div> <p></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120104084904/http://gothamist.com/tags/ronpaul">Ron Paul</a> is appreciative of all the supporters he can get, whether they <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120104084904/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/26/ron_paul_does_not_mind_his_racist_s.php">are racist</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120104084904/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/21/from_the_mailbag_america_loves_ron.php">Gothamist readers</a> or...Kelly Clarkson? Shocking many of her fans, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120104084904/https://twitter.com/#!/kelly_clarkson/status/152259502161399808">the former <em>American Idol</em> winner tweeted yesterday that</a> she loves Ron Paul, and plans to vote for him if he wins the Republican presidential nomination&#x2014;and then fellow pop star Michelle Branch chimed in that she too supported Paul! What&apos;s next, you&apos;re going to tell us that Selena Gomez <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120104084904/http://animalnewyork.com/2011/12/selena-gomez-watched-all-harmony-korines-movies-at-his-house/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+animalnewyork+%28ANIMAL%29&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader">is a fan of the work of Harmony Korine</a>?</p>

<p>Clarkson&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120104084904/http://www.whosay.com/kellyclarkson/content/180496?code=IVK1c5E">initial tweet read</a>, &quot;I love Ron Paul. I liked him a lot during the last republican nomination and no one gave him a chance. If he wins the nomination for the Republican party in 2012 he&apos;s got my vote. Too bad he probably won&apos;t.&quot; Branch responded to her, &quot;I wholeheartedly agree. #RonPaul.&quot; Both singers then <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120104084904/http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/celebritology/post/kelly-clarkson-tweets-support-for-ron-paul-receives-barrage-of-angry-tweets/2011/12/29/gIQArfWZOP_blog.html">faced a barrage of angry tweets</a> from their followers, who accused the two of supporting racism and the death penalty, and of not supporting equal rights for same-sex couples, by extension of their love for Paul.</p>

<p>Clarkson <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120104084904/http://www.whosay.com/kellyclarkson/content/180513?code=lEs1c5W">responded to those criticisms in a followup tweet</a>: &quot;I am really sorry if I have offended anyone. Obviously that was not my intent. I do not support racism. I support gay rights, straight rights, women&apos;s rights, men&apos;s rights, white/black/purple/orange rights. I like Ron Paul because he believes in less government and letting the people (all of us) make the decisions and mold our country. That is all. Out of all of the Republican nominees, he&apos;s my favorite.&quot; Branch also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120104084904/https://twitter.com/#!/michellebranch/status/152277150014246912">responded in turn:</a> &quot;Hmm. Didn&apos;t mean to offend. I am not racist and am absolutely not a homophobe. Just trying to weed through the non-impressive choices!&quot;</p>

<p>Clarkson later sent out one more message to her followers on the topic of Paul, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120104084904/http://www.whosay.com/kellyclarkson/content/180538?code=pVT1c6a">tsk tsk&apos;d them for attacking her</a>: </p>

<blockquote>Man my eyes have been opened to so much hate tonight. If y&apos;all ever disagree with something I say please don&apos;t feel the need to attack me. I will listen to what you say and any articles or viewpoints you have when you say it with respect. Being hateful is not a healthy way to get people to see or hear you. I was raised to respect people and their decisions and beliefs and I hope you will grant me the same decency. If you don&apos;t agree with me simply unfollow me. It&apos;s really that easy. I hope you don&apos;t because I would love the chance to hear what you have to say but if you&apos;re so blinded by hate you can&apos;t seek peace and progress then that is your unfortunate prerogative.</blockquote>

<p>In retrospect, it&apos;s not <em>that</em> surprising that Clarkson would align herself with Paul&apos;s libertarian views. In <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120104084904/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/30/fashion/kelly-clarkson-the-role-model-next-door.html?_r=1&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;pagewanted=all&amp;adxnnlx=1325174822-4OyIFc+PxqSjeSHq2ogjmg">an October NY Times feature</a>, it was revealed that Clarkson does her best to live off-the-paparazzi-grid in Nashville and on a ranch in Texas with her animal-rescue shelter (which includes 10 horses; innumerable dogs, cats, donkeys and goats, and a llama). She has also said she owns nine guns and sleeps with a Colt .45 (and loves Guns &apos;N&apos; Roses!). </p>

<p>And most importantly, anyone who has heard her recent single <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120104084904/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0C_oNMH0GTk">&quot;Mr. Know-It-All&quot;</a>&#x2014;which includes lines like: &quot;You ain&apos;t got the right to tell me/When and where to go, no right to tell me&quot;&#x2014;could see this coming a thousand miles away.</p>
