title: Vengeful NYers Trying To Prove NYC Is The Rudest City

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none" style=" width:638px; "> <img alt="41611rude.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110417214231im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/41611rude.jpg" width="638" height="424"> <br> <i><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110417214231/http://www.flickr.com/photos/weissfoto/2803827788/">weissfoto&apos;s flickr</a></i></div> <p></p>

<p>In January, Travel &amp; Leisure magazine released an article on a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110417214231/http://www.travelandleisure.com/articles/americas-rudest-cities">dumb survey</a> that purported that NYC is the second rudest city in America. As we <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110417214231/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/21/moronic_survey_says_new_yorkers_are.php">pointed out</a>, Travel &amp; Leisure completely misrepresented the survey, which was actually about how &quot;friendly&quot; a city is, in their pursuit of a juicy, click-friendly headline. Nevertheless, some NY natives were quite upset that LA was named ruder than us&#x2014;so they <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110417214231/http://rudenyc.tumblr.com/">started a tumblr</a> to collect evidence of NY&apos;s &quot;inner asshole.&quot;</p>

<p>They say that they will take the evidence they collect on their site, &quot;Re-Establish NYC As The Rudest City In America&quot;, and send it to Travel &amp; Leisure &quot;to secure the title belt in 2012.&quot; They&apos;ve actually accumulated an impressive amount of rude material over the last three months (a &quot;celebration of rudeness&quot;). It includes everything from rude NYC cop stories (&quot;They sat at a table next to me and while consuming their &#x201C;free meal&#x201D; and loudly lacing their conversation with obscenities proceeded to trade stories on busting hookers&quot;), to profane subway drivers, pissed off subway preachers, angry Santas, and of course, Yankees fans.</p>

<p>In particular, the subway has proven to be the greatest litmus test for NYer&apos;s rudeness, and certainly the best documented: the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110417214231/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/18/video_subway_spaghetti_spat_sparks.php">spaghetti fights</a>, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110417214231/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/20/guerilla_subway_etiquette_posters_d.php">disregard</a> of seating priority, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110417214231/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/01/video_clipping_your_nails_on_the_su.php">fingernail clipping</a>, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110417214231/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/09/video_sad_rat_man_makes_out_with_ra.php">rats in the mouth</a>, and of course, the public <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110417214231/http://gothamist.com/2010/01/29/jerk_tops_off_subway_masturbation_w.php">masturbating</a>. And that doesn&apos;t even include all the other <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110417214231/http://gothamist.com/2010/01/07/subway_douchery_brings_up_undergrou.php">subway douchery</a>. </p>

<p>And the best part of all this: when we inevitably &quot;win&quot; the title belt, we won&apos;t even give a shit, cos <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110417214231/http://gawker.com/#!5128029/and-im-jeff-rossen-go-fuck-yourself-new-york">go fuck yourself</a>!</p>
