<p>Yesterday was the (surprisingly snowy) 252nd St. Patrick&apos;s Day Parade&#x2014;photos and videos from that to come later&#x2014;but today is the <em>actual</em> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406171322/http://gothamist.com/tags/stpatricksday">St. Patrick&apos;s Day</a>. So instead of tentatively stomping around Manhattan and playing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406171322/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/16/celebrate_st_patrick_with_a_game_of_1.php">&quot;Everyone&apos;s Irish Bingo,&quot;</a> we&apos;re keeping things cuddlier with some hilarious Muppets videos. Below, watch six Irish and green-themed Muppets sketches, including Kermit singing &quot;Bein&apos; Green&quot; with Lena Horne, Murray learning Irish step dancing, and the world&apos;s greatest rendition of &quot;Danny Boy&quot; ever.</p>

<p>First, three gifted singers who have all kissed the Blarney Stone&#x2014;Swedish Chef, Animal and Beaker&#x2014;perform the world&apos;s most heartbreaking version of &quot;Danny Boy.&quot;</p>

<p>The female Muppets, including Betty Lou, Zoe and Prairie Dawn, sing a song about being a girl of the world&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406171322/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfZx3KEGG3c">here&apos;s the original</a>, and below is the Irish version.</p>
