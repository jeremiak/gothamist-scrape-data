<p>We&apos;re well into what Bill Simmons has called &quot;one of the craziest months in NBA history,&quot; and things are starting to go bonkers with trade rumors. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111209161622/http://sports.yahoo.com/nba/news?slug=mc-spears_tyson_chandler_knicks_120811">According to Yahoo</a>, the Knicks are on the verge of signing center Tyson Chandler to a four year/$58 million deal. To free up space for Chandler, who played with the champion Dallas Mavericks last season, the Knicks will have to shed the contracts of Chauncey Billups and Ronny Turiaf. </p>

<p>Earlier today, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111209161622/http://www.nypost.com/p/sports/knicks/knicks_on_verge_of_acquiring_grant_Z4zAsnEzot25UPRWQR85SJ">the Post reported that</a> the Knicks were close to signing aging forward Grant Hill&#x2014;it&apos;s unclear whether the Chandler deal has cut off the possibility of that deal, or if they may sign both big men.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111209161622/http://espn.go.com/new-york/nba/story/_/id/7330900/tyson-chandler-dallas-mavericks-nears-deal-new-york-knicks-sources-say?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter">ESPN offers a scary preview</a> of what the Knicks might do after getting Chandler: trade Amare Stoudemire for Chris Paul. ESPN reports: &quot;Signing Chandler, sources said, could free up the Knicks to offer star forward Amare Stoudemire to the New Orleans Hornets in a trade scenario for Chris Paul, who badly wants to reunite with Chandler after their time together with the Hornets. Sources say that&apos;s one option New York is considering.&quot;</p>

<p>Paul has reportedly said that the Knicks <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111209161622/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/01/chris_paul_has_reportedly_requested.php">are his preferred destination</a>, but with the New Orleans Hornets seemingly determined to trade him before this season starts, things aren&apos;t so simple. Simmons devoted a column the other day to parsing the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111209161622/http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/7327616/the-fourth-day-nba-christmas">myriad possible trade destinations for Paul</a> (albeit before the Chandler/Stoudemire rumors began). </p>

<p>And today, one particular trade has taken center stage: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111209161622/http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/7332598/talks-three-way-trade-sending-chris-paul-new-orleans-hornets-los-angeles-lakers-pau-gasol-houston-rockets">ESPN reports the</a> Hornets are engaged in trade talks with the Los Angeles Lakers and Houston Rockets about a three-team trade that would send Chris Paul to the Lakers and Pau Gasol to the Rockets. There <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111209161622/https://twitter.com/#!/dailythunder/status/144870191933833218">is also speculation that</a> the emboldened Lakers could then trade Andrew Bynum and Lamar Odom for Orlando Magic superstar Dwight Howard!</p>

<p>Of course, all these trade rumors are just that. Bigger surefire deals <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111209161622/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/25/nets_inching_closer_to_carmelo_anth.php">have fallen through</a> at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111209161622/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/09/yankees_trade_for_ace_cliff_lee_imm.php">the last minute. </a> At least Los Angeles Clippers star Blake Griffin is having fun with it all, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111209161622/https://twitter.com/#!/blakegriffin/status/144897345061003264">tweeting</a>, &quot;Hey guys I just got traded...&quot; and then <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111209161622/https://twitter.com/#!/joelmchale/status/144899037584297984">following it with</a>, &quot;Stupid autocorrec.
