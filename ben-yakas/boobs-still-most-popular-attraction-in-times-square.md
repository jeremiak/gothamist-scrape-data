<p>Naked flesh has been littered across the city this summer, from the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150831194258/http://gothamist.com/tags/nakedbikeride">naked bike riders</a> to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150831194258/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/01/wall_street_got_naked_this_morning.php">naked Wall Street protesters</a>. And the nekked-ness hit Times Square this week when body painter <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150831194258/http://www.andygolub.com/">Andy Golub</a> painted a topless woman as a crowd of nearly 150 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150831194258/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/naked_city_show_off_OaYn9NnYqk7zXg2t59BeuO?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">gathered to watch</a>. At least things went better for them than it did for the recently <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150831194258/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/19/extra_extra_2017.php">busted Naked Cowgirl</a>.</p>

<p>Golub has been painting bodies in public spaces in NYC for years, including nearly two dozen times in Times Square: &quot;I&apos;m an artist and I like doing live painting. I&apos;ve been doing body painting for a long time, it&apos;s a really cool thing, and I like sharing it with the public,&quot; he told the Post. Onlookers and tourists seemed less than shocked by the nudity, and rather supportive of the model: &quot;I think she&apos;s very brave to be out here in the open for everyone to see her like and for this man to be paining on her body,&quot; said tourist Leni Puen.</p>

<p>A month ago, Golub and two completely naked models <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150831194258/http://www.newstrackindia.com/newsdetails/234739">were briefly arrested</a> on public-lewdness charges in Times Square. This time, Golub made sure that 23-year-old topless model Marla Mera had a g-string on. Although it&apos;s legal to be topless in public, police eventually did ask Mera to put on a bra when the crowd got too large. Below, watch a video of the scene yesterday, including a hilarious little kid (around 1:17) who noted to his father&apos;s surprise that this wasn&apos;t the first naked lady he&apos;s seen:</p>
