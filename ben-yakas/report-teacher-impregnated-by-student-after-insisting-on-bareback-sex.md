It seems that a 32-year-old instructor at DeWitt Clinton High School was fired after it came out that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160710153948/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/bronx-science-teacher-refused-condom-student-sex-romps-pregnant-report-article-1.1286858">she had an affair with a 17-year-old student</a>. But that&apos;s not all: she got pregnant with his child after she encouraged him not to use condoms&#x2014;and then she broke up with him because he was too immature.<p></p>

<p>Former science teacher Felicia Barahona, a veteran of the Afghanistan war, began the affair with the unidentified student in the fall of 2011, according to a report by the special commissioner of investigation, Richard Condon. The two had sex &#x201C;about five times a week, on weekdays and on weekends,&#x201D; the report claims. The student reportedly wanted to use protection, but Barahona told him &#x201C;she didn&#x2019;t like condoms&#x201D; and &#x201C;not to worry.&quot;</p>

<p>And then Barahona became pregnant. The young man accompanied her to doctor&apos;s appointments, and Barahona bought rings for the two of them. The student even moved in with her briefly&#x2014;but Barahona kicked him out within days. &quot;She told investigators it was at least partly because her mom found him drinking rum, which he wasn&#x2019;t legally allowed to do,&quot; the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160710153948/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/bronx/teacher_booted_her_baby_daddy_VfIMMlI8rj09Q9u1slQk0I?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Bronx">Post reported.</a></p>

<p>The affair lasted only four months altogether; Barahona had the baby in August, and was fired around the same time. When the Post chased her up for comment, she told them, &#x201C;I have nothing to say to you.&#x201D; Moral of the story: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160710153948/http://gothamist.com/tags/condoms">always use protection.</a></p>
