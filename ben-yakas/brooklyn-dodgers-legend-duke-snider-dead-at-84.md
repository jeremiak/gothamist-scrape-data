<p>Hall of Fame Brooklyn Dodgers player Duke Snider <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130723023656/http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/baseball/2011/02/27/2011-02-27_halloffamer_duke_snider_the_last_surviving_regular_of_the_boys_of_summer_dodgers.html">died today</a> of natural causes at the age of 84. Snider played 18 seasons with the Brooklyn and Los Angeles Dodgers (1947-62), New York Mets (1963), and San Francisco Giants (1964). &quot;The Duke of Flatbush&quot; made it to the World Series five times with Brooklyn, and winning in 1955 and 1959 (with LA). The eight-time All Star batted .295 with 407 home runs and 1,333 RBI in 2,143 games, and was a six-time top ten MVP finisher.</p>

<p>Born Edwin Donald Snider, he got his nickname at an early age, when his father noticed him returning home with a bit of a strut, and noted, &#x201C;Here comes the Duke.&#x201D; Also nicknamed &quot;The Silver Fox&quot; and &quot;The Duke of Flatbush,&quot; he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130723023656/http://laist.com/2011/02/27/the_duke_goes_to_the_big_dodger_in.php">remains</a> the Dodger franchise&apos;s all-time home run (389) and runs batted in (1,271) leader. Snider played during what many fans <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130723023656/http://www.nypost.com/p/sports/more_sports/former_brooklyn_dodgers_star_snider_5AxGDz5crik32pTzIA2xRO">considered</a> the city&#x2019;s golden era of baseball, along with fellow outfielders Willie Mays of the Giants and Mickey Mantle of the Yankees; he was one of the last surviving members of the &quot;Boys of Summer,&quot; who were memorialized in a book by Roger Kahn. Snider was also included in Terry Cashman&apos;s signature baseball ditty, &quot;Talkin&apos; Baseball - Willie, Mickey and the Duke&quot;.</p>

<p>Sportscaster Vin Scully, who called the Dodgers play-by-play when Snider was still in Brooklyn, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130723023656/http://laist.com/2011/02/27/the_duke_goes_to_the_big_dodger_in.php">said</a>: &quot;He was an extremely gifted talent and his defensive abilities were often overlooked because of playing in a small ballpark, Ebbets Field. When he had a chance to run and move defensively, he had the grace and the abilities of DiMaggio and Mays and of course, he was a World Series hero that will forever be remembered in the borough of Brooklyn. Although it&#x2019;s ironic to say it, we have lost a giant. He&#x2019;s joining a great Dodger team that has moved on and I extend my sympathies to his entire family, especially to Bev.&#x201D;</p>

<p>When we interviewed author Michael Shapiro in 2009, he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130723023656/http://gothamist.com/2009/05/15/michael_shapiro_author_bottom_of_th.php">told us</a> his fondest baseball memory: &quot;First game at the Polo Grounds with my dad and my brother. Mets v. Dodgers. A kid tried to get Duke Snider&apos;s autograph by hanging it over the grandstand railing. Duke tied the string to a water cooler.&quot;</p>
