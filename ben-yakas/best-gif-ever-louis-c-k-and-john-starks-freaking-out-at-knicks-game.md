										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2013-04_celebrityrow.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507075034im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/2013-04_celebrityrow.jpg" width="640" height="401" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507075034/http://gothamist.com/tags/knicks">The Knicks</a> took a 2-0 lead in their playoff series against the Boston Celtics last night with a commanding 87-71 victory at the Garden. While the game was won on shutdown defense in the second half, JR Smith was particularly fiery fresh off his Sixth Man Of The Year award win. He hit an incredible buzzer-beating three pointer with three men on him to close the first quarter, prompting a jubilant celebration filled with some air guitar windmilling.</p>

<p>But look up in the right corner of the screen when Smith gets down on his knees&#x2014;you can see dynamic duo of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507075034/http://gothamist.com/tags/louisck">Louis C.K.</a> and John Starks celebrating as well. It&apos;s especially appropriate, considering the fact Starks is the last Knicks player to win the Sixth Man Of The Year&#x2014;as for C.K., well, anytime he&apos;s visibly having fun makes us happy. Check out the essential gif of it (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507075034/http://twitpic.com/cllves">via Grantland</a>):</p>

<p>And the last fun tidbit: we wonder what CK and Lee were discussing here.</p>
