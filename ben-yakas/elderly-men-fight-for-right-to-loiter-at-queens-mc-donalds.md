<p>Now that we know one can eat <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507233821/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/05/video_science_teacher_claims_he_got.php">nothing but McDonald&apos;s and get healthier</a>, it&apos;s a wonder more people haven&apos;t taken to living in a McD&apos;s 24/7. Some senior citizens in Queens are apparently coming close to making the joint feel like a home away from home: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507233821/http://nytimes.com/2014/01/15/nyregion/fighting-a-mcdonalds-for-the-right-to-sit-and-sit-and-sit.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;_r=0&amp;referrer=">the Times reports</a> that elderly Korean men have been clashing with management at a Flushing McDonald&apos;s, where they&apos;re accused of loitering all day while sharing meager orders of fries.</p>

<p>The Times reports that the men occupy the benches at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507233821/http://gothamist.com/tags/mcdonalds">McDonald&#x2019;s</a> on the corner of Parsons and Northern Boulevards around 5 a.m., and often linger there till late at night. This has apparently been going on for the last five years, but tensions have escalated over recent months; there have been at least four 911 calls since Nov. to kick them out.</p>

<p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s a McDonald&#x2019;s,&#x201D; said Martha Anderson, the general manager, &#x201C;not a senior center.&#x201D; The men argue that they are paying customers, and it takes them a little extra time to get through their food: &#x201C;Do you think you can drink a large coffee within 20 minutes?&#x201D; David Choi, 77, said. &#x201C;No, it&#x2019;s impossible.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Of course, these elderly men don&apos;t particularly care for the food: &#x201C;We prefer our own Korean food,&#x201D; said Hoick Choi, 76. They even stock up on free lunch at a nearby senior center before returning to McDonald&apos;s. Instead, they are drawn to the place for companionship; many of the men are widowers.</p>

<p>Unless cops crack down and clear the McDonald&apos;s <a href="Elderly Men Fight For Right To Loiter At Queens McDonald&apos;s http://gothamist.com/2014/01/15/elderly_men_fight_for_right_to_loit.php">Zuccotti-park style</a>, these guys aren&apos;t going to roll over: &#x201C;I will just listen to them,&#x201D; Il Ho Park said after an officer told him to leave. &#x201C;But I will come back inside after they leave.&#x201D; As long as these guys don&apos;t pull a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507233821/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088933/"><em>Cocoon</em></a> and return as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507233821/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/29/fight-friendly_village_mcdonalds_to.php">rowdy teenagers</a>, maybe the Flushing McDonald&apos;s management should count their blessings. </p>
