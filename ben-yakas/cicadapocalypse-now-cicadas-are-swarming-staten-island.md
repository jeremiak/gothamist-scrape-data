<p>For weeks, we&apos;ve been molting in anticipation of the arrival of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429130052/http://gothamist.com/tags/cicadas">our cicada overlords</a>&#x2014;after 17 years of dormancy underground, billions of the Brood II cicadas have finally begun swarming the East Coast. Despite a few cicadas checking out all <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429130052/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/21/shut_up_cicadas_really_are_coming_l.php">the hoopla in Brooklyn</a>, most of them have been emerging in Staten Island, where thousands have been spotted over the last few days. </p>

<p>But we haven&apos;t even reached PEAK cicada yet: &quot;Cicadas are pretty active on SI though not the high point yet, probably within a 1-2 weeks,&quot; Louis Sorkin, entomologist at the American Museum of Natural History, told us. &quot;Last night was probably good for some activity since it was moist and warm. There are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429130052/http://www.statenislandmuseum.org/calendar-programs/">various programs to attend at Staten Island Museum</a> regarding cicadas.&quot; Check out some videos, tweets and Vines of what&apos;s been going on below.</p>

<p>And of course, once these little creatures get comfortable, all the hot sexy insect action can get underway:  &quot;Once their wings are good and hard, they&apos;ll start flying,&quot; Ed Johnson, director of science for the Staten Island Museum, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429130052/http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2013/05/cicadas_begin_their_staten_isl.html#incart_river">told SI Advance</a>. &quot;Then the males will start calling, and congregating in what are known as &apos;calling centers.&apos; All the males call together, which makes [their sounds] that much louder. This attracts the females from all around,&quot; he said. </p>
