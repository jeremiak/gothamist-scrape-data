This was probably the worst year to be a Knicks fan since the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170420072954/http://nymag.com/news/sports/games/62037/">&apos;08/&apos;09 era.</a> After several years of hope being built-up by the hiring of Phil Jackson and promises that management was serious about the rebuilding process, everything and everyone (including NYC&apos;s most beautiful skyscraper, Kristaps Porzingis) took a step back this year.
