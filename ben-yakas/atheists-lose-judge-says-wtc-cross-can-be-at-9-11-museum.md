<p>It&apos;s been awhile since we heard an update about the lawsuit atheists <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130403102357/http://gothamist.com/2011/07/27/atheists_sue_over_911_cross_at_wtc.php">filed against the 9/11 Memorial and Museum</a> over the establishment&apos;s decision to include the so-called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130403102357/http://gothamist.com/tags/911cross">&quot;9/11 cross.&quot;</a> But yesterday, a Manhattan judge <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130403102357/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/30/nyregion/judge-dismisses-suit-over-steel-cross-at-9-11-museum.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;_r=0">tossed out the lawsuit</a> by the American Atheists, arguing that the artifact could help tell the story of 9/11. &#x201C;No reasonable observer would view the artifact as endorsing Christianity,&#x201D; wrote Judge Deborah A. Batts. &#x201C;The cross does not create excessive entanglement between the state and religion.&#x201D;</p>

<p>The cross is made of two beams found in the wreckage of the World Trade Center after the September 11, 2001 attacks. Judge Batts agreed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130403102357/http://gothamist.com/2012/08/15/911_museum_to_atheists_and_the_911.php">with the museums rationale</a>, writing that the cross&apos; purpose there is &#x201C;historical and secular,&#x201D; and that the accompanying panels of text helped &#x201C;demonstrate how those at ground zero coped with the devastation they witnessed,&#x201D; justifying their inclusion.  </p>

<p>American Atheists Inc. said in their lawsuit, &quot;The WTC cross has become a Christian icon. It has been blessed by so-called holy men and presented as a reminder that their god, who couldn&apos;t be bothered to stop the Muslim terrorists or prevent 3,000 people from being killed in his name, cared only enough to bestow upon us some rubble that resembles a cross. It&apos;s a truly ridiculous assertion. It will just be a Christian icon, in the middle of OUR museum. This will not happen without a fight.&quot;</p>

<p>Edwin F. Kagin, a lawyer for the atheists group, told AP the group would appeal the decision: &#x201C;Naturally, we don&#x2019;t like the ruling and we think it&#x2019;s incorrect,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;For anyone to think this is not a religious symbol being moved for religious reasons into the World Trade Center museum is incredible.&#x201D;</p>
