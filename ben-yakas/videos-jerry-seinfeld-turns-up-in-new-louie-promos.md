<p>Like all reasonable people who partake in enjoyable things, we are eagerly anticipating the new season of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408231850/http://gothamist.com/tags/louie"><em>Louie</em></a>, which is set to premiere on FX on May 5th. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408231850/http://gothamist.com/2014/04/16/heres_the_new_louie_trailer.php">first trailer</a> for Season 4 showed Our Hero jumping off the Brooklyn Bridge with a bouquet of roses in his hand. But all week, FX has been quietly releasing more promos featuring actual footage from the new season, including a guest appearance from Jerry Seinfeld. If you ever wanted to see Seinfeld say &quot;vagina dirt&quot; or see a receptionist use a vibrator as a back massager, check out all seven of the promos below.</p>

<p>As <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408231850/http://gothamist.com/2014/03/13/louie_returns_in_may.php">previously reported</a>, the new season of <em>Louie</em> will include 14 episodes spread over seven weeks. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408231850/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/04/louis_ck_talks_upcoming_season_of_l.php">The new season includes</a> a mix of first season-esque episodes (lots of snappy sketches, multiple stories in an episode) and some multi-episode arcs (ala &quot;Late Show&quot; or &quot;Daddy&apos;s Girlfriend&quot;): &#x201C;There&apos;s some episodes that are just like, let&apos;s really get some basic laughs with some of these. It was fun to go back to that. And then there&apos;s other stories that, it&apos;s just gonna piss you off.&#x201D; At the Paley Center event for the show last year, C.K. added that &#x201C;I have a stomach ache about&#x201D; one episode in the new season in particular, though he wouldn&apos;t go into specifics about the story.</p>
