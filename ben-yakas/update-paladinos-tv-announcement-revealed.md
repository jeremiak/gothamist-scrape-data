										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="10710paladinolive.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170311022448im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/10710paladinolive.jpg" width="250" height="161" class="image-left"> </span>Like you, dear readers, we&apos;ve spent all day glued to our computer screens, waiting and anticipating Carl Paladino&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170311022448/http://gothamist.com/2010/10/07/paladino_to_make_mysterious_announc.php">mysterious television news bomb</a> which he promised to drop on us at the end of the work day. Would it live up to his crazier <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170311022448/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/22/paladino_sends_mario_jr_the_duck_to.php">antics</a>, or would it turn out to be another boring campaign stump speech? Well, it turned out to be...(see the video below!)</p>

<p>Sort of typical and disappointing. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170311022448/http://www.wivb.com/dpp/news/new_york/Paladinos-message-to-NY-voters">According to WIVB</a>, Paladino addresses some of the numerous controversies that have overtaken his campaign in the last weeks in the three minute video, including the confrontation with Post reporter Fred Dicker, his love child, and the accusations he made about Andrew Cuomo&apos;s infidelities. Paladino says he just wants to move past all the insinuations and innuendo, although as is always his problem, he can&apos;t help but throw in a jab that Cuomo&apos;s &quot;prowess is legendary.&quot; He accuses Cuomo of being afraid of a debate, and spends the last third of the video letting his his newly appointed Campaign Chairwoman Nancy Naples ask for emergency campaign donations.</p>

<p>So essentially, it was similar to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170311022448/http://gothamist.com/2010/10/05/paladino_what_affairs_this_is_about.php">every other attempt</a> Paladino&apos;s made this week to not sound <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170311022448/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/30/paladino_vs_the_ny_post.php">batshit crazy</a>. Certainly nowhere near as epic as we had hoped. About that debate point: at the same time Paladino is calling out Cuomo for not agreeing to debate, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170311022448/http://eon.businesswire.com/news/eon/20101007006895/en/News-12-Newsday-Hofstra-University-Partner-Bring">it was announced</a> that all seven candidates for governor have been invited for the first official debate at Hofstra University, on Monday, October 18 at 7:00 p.m. Six of the seven pol&apos;s, including Cuomo, Kristin Davis (Anti-Prohibition Party), Charles Barron (Freedom Party), Howie Hawkins (Green Party), Warren Redlich (Libertarian Party), and Jimmy McMillan (Rent is too Damn High Party) have agreed to attend. The only person who hasn&apos;t accepted the invitation? Carl Paladino.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: Cuomo has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170311022448/http://www.nydailynews.com/blogs/dailypolitics/2010/10/carl-paladino-liveblog.html">released a statement</a> in response to Paladino&apos;s video:<br>
</p><blockquote>Carl Paladino and his handlers can&#x2019;t con New Yorkers. They have seen the real Carl and they know he is unfit to be Governor with his unstable outbursts, smears, and total lack of substance. New Yorkers don&#x2019;t need his dysfunctional personality in Albany - Albany is dysfunctional enough. As we all know by now, Carl has a casual relationship with the truth. We have accepted a debate hosted by Newsday featuring all candidates, as requested by Carl, and it is Carl who has thus far declined. Just when you thought he couldn&#x2019;t get any lower, Carl once again debased himself and the entire political process.</blockquote><p></p>
