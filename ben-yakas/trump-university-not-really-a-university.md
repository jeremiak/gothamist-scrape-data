The state Education Department slammed the fauxiversity and Trump for &quot;misleading&quot; the public, in a letter obtained by the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160304222923/http://www.nydailynews.com/money/2010/04/16/2010-04-16_state_wants_to_demote_trumps_university.html">Daily News.</a> &quot;Use of the word &apos;university&apos; by your corporation is misleading and violates New York Education Law and the Rules of the Board of Regents,&quot; wrote Deputy Commissioner for Higher Education Joseph Frey.</p>

<p>Several complaints by people who attended the seminars given by Trump U. can be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160304222923/http://www.complaintsboard.com/complaints/trump-university-c118292.html">found online</a>, including many claims that the expensive classes are a scam: &quot;I, too, signed up for the 3 day class at $1495, after attending the 2 hour free event. The deal was, if you were dissatisfied after the 1st day, you could get your money back. The first day was full of excellent information, so of course, no one wanted their money back. <strong>The next 2 days were completely worthless. The focus for those 2 days was to sell you on other programs.</strong>&quot; One person says it was like listening to a &quot;<strong>high powered car salesman,</strong>&quot; and another complains that you are expected to sign up for a 35k &quot;gold&quot; package (though you can get <em>not</em>-sketchy coupons for classes <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160304222923/http://www.couponsnapshot.com/merchant-Trump-University-coupons-deals-8049.html">here</a>).</p>

<p>Trump University was also recently given a &quot;D&quot; rating by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160304222923/http://www.bbb.org/us/">Better Business Bureau</a>; university President Michael Sexton sounded dejected about the whole thing: &quot;We&apos;ll cooperate with them fully, and at the end of the day, if we&apos;re in violation of any state regulation, <strong>we will change our name to Trump Education.&quot; </strong></p>
