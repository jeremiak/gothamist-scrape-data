										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="9810espada.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150523083628im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/9810espada.jpg" width="250" height="196" class="image-left"> </span>Pedro Espada is great at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150523083628/http://gothamist.com/2010/08/04/video_espada_treats_protesters_like.php">throwing money around</a>, except maybe when it comes to his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150523083628/http://gothamist.com/2010/08/19/now_espadas_allegedly_stiffing_his.php">tailor</a>. So it&apos;s no big surprise that after being <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150523083628/http://gothamist.com/2010/08/24/espada_didnt_report_food_giveaway_f.php">called out</a> for not reporting any expenditures on his fruit and vegetable giveaway, Espada <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150523083628/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/espada_went_bananas_buying_fruit_6JBuE3OJBRlzAz1peGI8yJ">signed off</a> on a whopping $17,000 check for the produce.</p>

<p>Previously, Espada was accused of violating election law for failing to disclose the expenses associated with his anti-obesity food giveaway (which already netted him a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150523083628/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/10/pedro_espada.php">showdown</a> with one Bronx priest). So Espada wrote the check to Hunts Point Terminal Market on Aug. 25, two days after the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150523083628/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/bronx/espada_lips_on_bananas_LFpRxOBdo4c72YNzo25L5K">Post&apos;s story</a> first broke. But even his payoffs can&apos;t go exactly according to plan: a Hunts Point spokesman said Espada should have paid the vendors directly, not the market: &quot;The Hunts Point produce market is a real-estate entity and is not a seller of produce.&quot;</p>

<p>Espada is currently <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150523083628/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/bronx/2010/09/08/2010-09-08_and_then_there_were_2_race_for_espadas_state_senate_seat.html">facing</a> a tough Senate primary battle with Gustavo Rivera; a third challenger, Daniel Padernacht, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150523083628/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/07/race_between_espada_and_challenger.php">just dropped out</a>, placing his support behind Rivera in order to &quot;knock out&quot; Espada. With all the criticism and mounting anti-Espada sentiment (a group of comedians recently held a fund-raiser in Manhattan called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150523083628/http://www.newrooseveltinitiative.com/pirates_of_the_bronx">&#x201C;Pirates of the Bronx: The Curse of Pedro Espada&#x201D;</a>), some might think the jig is up for the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150523083628/http://gothamist.com/2009/04/21/bronx_state_senator_blocking_mta_ba.php">Bronxchester</a> Senator...except this is Pedro! His <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150523083628/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/03/nyregion/03espada.html">ringtone</a> is the theme from Rocky III, &#x201C;Eye of the Tiger.&#x201D; He kills with the skill to survive!</p>
