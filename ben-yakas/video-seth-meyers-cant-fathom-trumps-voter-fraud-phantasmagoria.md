<p>After <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170127182152/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/23/us/politics/donald-trump-congress-democrats.html">ranting about it</a> earlier this week, Donald Trump announced on Twitter this morning that he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170127182152/http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/25/politics/trump-calls-for-major-investigation-into-voter-fraud/">wants an investigation</a> into the &quot;voter fraud&quot; which he claims cost him the popular vote, despite there being <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170127182152/http://gothamist.com/2017/01/24/serial_gum_swallower_speaks.php">no evidence of it and experts calling bullshit on the claims</a> (he should ask advisor Steve Bannon about what it&apos;s like to be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170127182152/http://www.heraldtribune.com/news/20170124/column-does-stephen-bannon-live-in-sarasota-county-because-hes-registered-to-vote-here">registered to vote</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170127182152/https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/26/steve-bannon-florida-registered-vote-donald-trump">in two places</a>, if he really wants to learn about fraud). </p>

<p>Like most of us, Seth Meyers can&apos;t quite wrap his head around why Trump continues to pursue this issue: &quot;Hey, why do you keep lying about this?&quot; he asked. &quot;There is zero evidence for this claim. Also, why would you say 3-5 million people? We already know from the inauguration you have no idea what a million people look like.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hey, you won the election, what are you complaining about?&quot; Meyers continued. &quot;You&apos;re like a guy who wins the Super Bowl and spends the post-game interview complaining about a pass interference call in the first quarter. Winners don&apos;t complain about the final score, you know who does? Degenerate gamblers. But I guess if you knew anything about gamblers, your casinos would still be open.&quot;</p>

<p>CNN&apos;s Jake Trapper also has had it with Trump&apos;s erroneous claims, and set his attitude to extremely sassy for his report on the fraud claims:</p>

<p>If you want to know just how rare and difficult voter fraud is, we refer you to John Oliver&apos;s segment on it from last year.</p>

<p>If you need a chaser for this Trump shot, Meyers also went day drinking with the always delightful Retta:</p>
