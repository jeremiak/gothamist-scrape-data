<p>It&apos;s not easy to find outspoken <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022191803/http://gothamist.com/tags/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> supporters around the liberal bastion of NYC&#x2014;even local members of various NY-based Young Republican clubs have generally distanced themselves from him as the campaign has gone off the rails into some <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022191803/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/01/gross_trump_playboy_porn.php">increasingly</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022191803/http://gothamist.com/2016/09/30/donald_trump_sex_tape.php">unhinged</a> dimensions. But it seems that serious NY-based Trump supporters won&apos;t be staying in the shadows much longer: a number of major Alt-Right figures and Trump fanatics, including Milo Yiannopoulos, Gavin McInnes, and Martin Shkreli, will supposedly take part in a multimedia pro-Trump art show in Brooklyn this Saturday.</p>

<p>The event, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022191803/https://www.facebook.com/events/1753067734967011/">#DaddyWillSaveUs: Make Art Great Again!</a>, was organized by host  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022191803/https://twitter.com/lucianwintrich">Lucian Wintrich</a>, the openly gay conservative behind the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022191803/http://www.nbcnews.com/video/gay-conservative-behind-twinks4trump-takes-on-liberal-puritans-755328579598">&quot;#Twinks4Trump&quot; photo series</a> earlier this summer. The event is happening at 8 p.m. at 191 N 14th Street on the border of Williamsburg and Greenpoint (you may recognize the space as The Boiler, although this event is not being hosted by them).</p>

<p>According to the event&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022191803/https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/daddywillsaveus-make-art-great-again-party--2#/">Indiegogo fundraising page</a>, &quot;Headlining speakers and contributors for the opening include outspoken gay conservative Milo Yiannopoulos and Vice co-founder Gavin McInnes. Additional contributors include Martin Shkreli, David Angelo, Francis Legge, James O&apos;Keefe, the Godesky Brothers, Jon Proby, Sebastian Sommer, and more!!&quot;</p>

<p>Wintrich told us that all the featured guests &quot;are contributing art and will be attending, so far we are staying away from the speaker/soap box set up that is so worn thin with political events (although myself and Ali Akbar might introduce the event as a whole).&quot; He added that there will be lots of mixed media, from paintings to performances to installations, to photographs (which of course include the &#x201C;#Twinks4Trump&#x201D; photo series).</p>

<p>You can buy tickets to the event <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022191803/https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/daddywillsaveus-make-art-great-again-party--2#/">here</a>, and updates about the event <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022191803/http://www.daddywillsaveus.com/">will turn up here.</a></p>

<p>A spokesperson for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022191803/http://www.pierogi2000.com/">Pierogi</a>, which still operates The Boiler gallery space after relocating to the Lower East Side this year, confirmed the event is scheduled for this Saturday, but stressed that the show is &quot;not affiliated with The Boiler.&quot; </p>

<p>Contacted about his participation in the event, Martin Shkreli did not comment on whether he was producing any art for Trump, but did bring up the fact <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022191803/http://gothamist.com/2016/09/11/extra_extra_3484.php">that I wrote this about him</a> in September: &quot;Because he literally has nothing better to do, notorious dweeb Martin Shkreli showed up outside Chelsea Clinton&apos;s apartment today to taunt Hillary Clinton.&quot;</p>

<p>His response: &quot;What makes me a dweeb, exactly?&quot;</p>
