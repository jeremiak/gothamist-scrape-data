										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="91411police.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505123001im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/91411police.jpg" width="260" height="282" class="image-left"> </span>A veteran NYPD officer distraught over being called to testify in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505123001/http://gothamist.com/tags/ticketfixingscheme">ticket-fixing scandal</a> which has engulfed the police force this year allegedly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505123001/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/15/nyregion/possible-suicide-attempt-in-ny-ticket-fixing-inquiry.html?_r=1&amp;partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;pagewanted=all">attempted to commit suicide earlier today</a>. Officer Robert McGee, 62, a three-decade veteran and union delegate assigned to the 43rd Precinct, jumped in the tracks on the No. 1 line at a Riverdale subway station just before 5 a.m. this morning, and tried to electrocute himself by clutching the third rail. Earlier that night, McGee&apos;s wife <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505123001/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/cop_probed_suicide_nypd_tix_fix_kWJ44d74dvOXUnDUYmKeQO">had called cops</a> and said he &quot;was suicidal.&quot;</p>

<p>Even though McGee wasn&apos;t facing any criminal charges in the probe, he was reportedly distraught that he would be called to take the stand at trial against fellow cops accused of bribery or misconduct. A close friend <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505123001/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/15/nyregion/possible-suicide-attempt-in-ny-ticket-fixing-inquiry.html?_r=1&amp;partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;pagewanted=all">described him to the Times</a> as the type of officer who is willing to &#x201C;give you the shirt off his back.&#x201D; McGee even tried to retire in March to avoid this, but he wasn&apos;t allowed to when he was named in the probe: &quot;He&apos;s been stressed out by this for months. He was always very nervous and very stressed out by this -- more than anyone else,&quot; one police source <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505123001/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2011/09/14/2011-09-14_cop_probed_in_ticketfixing_tried_to_commit_suicide_in_subway_ahead_of_being_call.html">told the News.</a></p>

<p>This year, it has been revealed that more than 400 cops could be facing disciplinary charges in a massive ticket-fixing scheme, the implications of which could have negative consequences for many criminal cases. At least a dozen or more cops could be hit with criminal charges in the probe. Pat Lynch, president of the Patrolmen&apos;s Benevolent Association, blamed the ongoing probe and how prosecutors have mishandled the case for McGee&apos;s suicide attempt: &quot;<strong>It is no surprise that New York City police officers have reached a breaking point. This issue could have and should have been addressed differently.</strong> Police Officer McGee has served this city well for over three decades and is a man of honesty and integrity and he and others deserve better than this treatment.&quot;</p>
