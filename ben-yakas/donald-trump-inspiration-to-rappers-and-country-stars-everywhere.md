</div></div>					<p>Among the many hilarious, absurd things <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150823194824/http://gothamist.com/tags/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> has said this week, one quote has stood out like a strippers convention at Chuck E. Cheese&apos;s: during an interview with Post editor Fred Dicker, he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150823194824/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/14/trump_i_have_always_had_a_great_rel.php">declared proudly</a>, &quot;<strong>I have always had a great relationship with the blacks</strong>.&quot; The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150823194824/http://www.observer.com/2011/politics/roger-stone-cites-donald-trumps-rap-ubiquity">Observer had the good sense</a> to ask <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150823194824/http://gothamist.com/2008/05/25/roger_stone_spi.php">political guru</a>/<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150823194824/http://gothamist.com/2010/10/13/paladino_gay_gate_adviser_3_pride_p.php">gay enthusiast</a> Roger Stone what he could make of the quote; he replied, <strong>&quot;Trivia question&#x2014;how many hit rap songs mention Trump?</strong>&quot; It sounded like a challenge to us, so we did some searching, and found at least <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150823194824/http://search.azlyrics.com/search.php?q=donald+trump&amp;p=1">36 songs</a>, most of them rap (and one country), which namedrop The Donald.
