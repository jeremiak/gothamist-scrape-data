<p>A dog was fatally struck by an LIRR train in Queen yesterday, and its owner was grazed by the train chasing after it. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140307060820/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/31/nyregion/railroad-train-kills-dog-in-queens-disrupting-service-for-45-minutes.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;_r=1&amp;">According to the Times</a>, Duchess, a female pit bull, escaped through an open gate in owner Karma Gurung&apos;s Elmhurst backyard fence around 10 a.m. on Friday. The dog ran onto the train tracks, and was killed by a Penn Station-bound train from Great Neck, about 200 yard away from the Woodside station. </p>

<p> &#x201C;I was calling and she was running to me, too close to the tracks,&#x201D; Gurung told the Times, noting the one-year-old dog often played in the backyard unleashed. &#x201C;I was trying to grab hold of her at the same time as the train hit her right in the head.&#x201D; Gurung sustained a minor injury to his hand as he tried to pull her back. </p>

<p>Service on the line was delayed for about 45 minutes. &#x201C;It seemed like something else must have happened,&#x201D; said Jose Salamone, who was on the train headed to work. &#x201C;For a dog, we were held up there for more than an hour.&#x201D; When <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140307060820/http://gothamist.com/tags/subwaykittens">two kittens were spotted frolicking on the subway tracks</a> earlier this week, the B/Q line was shut down for nearly two hours to try to get them off of it.</p>

<p>Gurung maintains it was an accident, but he was also given a summons for trespassing on the tracks, according to the MTA. Initially, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140307060820/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20130830/woodside/dog-killed-after-being-taken-for-walk-on-lirr-tracks-mta-says">it was reported</a> that Gurung was walking the dog off-leash on the tracks, but that has since been refuted by the MTA.</p>
