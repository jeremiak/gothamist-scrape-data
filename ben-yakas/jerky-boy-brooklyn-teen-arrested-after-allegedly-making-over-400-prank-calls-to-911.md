<p>Brooklyn residents <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429215015/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/05/disgruntled_williamsburg_resident_a.php">can&apos;t stop, won&apos;t stop</a> making phony calls to 911: a 16-year-old teen has been arrested for making over 400 prank calls to 911 since last May. &quot;He reported police officers needing assistance, shots fired, motor vehicle accidents and disputes,&quot; a police source <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429215015/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/klyn_teen_dialed_more_than_times_6Y5g6lcIAVTHGUsFmFd9XN">told the Post</a> about Dean Whylie. Obviously this doesn&apos;t sound very good, but at least this prank didn&apos;t involve <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429215015/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/12/12/shark-attack-prank-video_n_2287659.html">shark attacks</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429215015/http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/12/09/royal-radio-pranks-gone-wrong.html">suicide</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429215015/http://gawker.com/5976204/behind-the-sandy-hook-truther-conspiracy-video-that-five-million-people-have-watched-in-one-week">Sandy Hook conspiracy theories.</a></p>

<p>Despite the fact that Whylie &quot;disguised&quot; his voice by pretending to be a woman on the phone, investigators <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429215015/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/teen-charged-400-plus-bogus-911-calls-article-1.1242352">traced most of</a> the 404 calls to the teen&#x2019;s E. 22nd Street home in Flatbush. Police say Whylie allegedly used two phones that weren&#x2019;t yet activated, but were set up for emergency calls only. One of those phones, which had been used to make 186 of the fake calls, was recovered.</p>

<p>This arrest comes less than a month since a Williamsburg resident was arrested for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429215015/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/05/disgruntled_williamsburg_resident_a.php">making phone calls to 911 complaining about his hipster neighbors.</a> Whylie has been charged with reckless endangerment, criminal impersonation, obstruction of governmental administration, filing false reports and criminal nuisance. </p>

<p>Although cops noted the teen could not give any explanation as to why he made the prank calls, it&apos;s pretty obvious that this was yet another copycat attempt at capturing the zeitgeist by a misguided teen enrapture by the Jerky Boys, those crude, bathroom-humor obsessed miscreants from Queens whose name is on the tip of everyone&apos;s tongues <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429215015/http://www.buzzfeed.com/perpetua/29-albums-that-are-now-20-years-old">because it is 1993</a>. Hey, have you guys heard this song &quot;Creep&quot; yet, the new single from that band named after a Talking Heads song?</p>
