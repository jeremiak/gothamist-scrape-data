<p>There&apos;s been a lot of advances in recent years for short men&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429074318/http://www.businessinsider.com/fashion-tips-and-styles-for-men-under-58-2013-10">unique clothing lines</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429074318/http://abcnews.go.com/Health/york-man-grows-inches-surgery/story?id=15776730">experimental procedures</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429074318/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/13/short-celebrity-men-taller-women_n_4270006.html">more and more pint-sized stars</a>&#x2014;but it&apos;s still pretty hard out there for short men, especially if you live in NYC. According to a new survey, NYC women don&apos;t have any time for the vertically challenged. </p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="12813date2.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429074318im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/12813date2.jpg" width="640" height="710"> <br> <i> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429074318/http://www.ayi.com/dating-blog/online-dating-height-short-men-nyc-jersey-city/">via AYI</a></i></div> <p></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429074318/http://www.ayi.com/dating-blog/online-dating-height-short-men-nyc-jersey-city/">AYI.com analyzed</a> over 50,000 interactions in the NY metropolitan area to determine how likely female online daters were to contact a men that was 5&#x2019;9&#x2033; or under when she viewed his profile. And the results were rather depressing: Manhattan women were the choosiest (only 1.2% would contact), followed by The Bronx (1.2%), Brooklyn (2.4%) and Long Island (3.7%). </p>

<p>&#x201C;Cross-culturally, women show a preference for taller mates,&#x201D; Dr. Jill Shapiro, a biological anthropologist at Columbia University, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429074318/http://nypost.com/2013/12/08/short-men-dont-stack-up-with-nyc-women/">explained to the Post</a>. &#x201C;Most people think it&#x2019;s related to sexual selection. Taller men are perceived to be healthier, be better providers. By being tall, you are signaling that you have good genes.&#x201D; And <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429074318/http://www.forbes.com/sites/tykiisel/2013/03/20/you-are-judged-by-your-appearance/">a higher-paying job.</a> </p>

<p>But there is hope for short men, and it resides a stone&apos;s throw away in the mythical land of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429074318/http://gothamist.com/tags/jerseycity">Jersey City,</a> where women aren&apos;t quite as discerning when it comes to height. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s going against the normal pattern for most humans,&#x201D; Shapiro said of Jersey City women. Well, we are talking about a place where people <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429074318/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/23/new_jersey_man_possibly_on_pcp_ate.php">occasionally eat their own fingers</a> and rents are not ridiculously high, so yeah, things are different over there.</p>
