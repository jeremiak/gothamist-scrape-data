<p>A Brooklyn bodega worker <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150916002320/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/brooklyn-bodega-clerk-slashed-face-telling-thug-food-stamps-buy-beer-article-1.1138177">was slashed in the face yesterday</a> by an allegedly drunk man after the clerk refused to accept food stamps for beer. The incident happened in the Express Deli in Bushwick about 7:35 a.m. Thursday, when the suspect attempted to buy a 22-ounce Colt 45 with a food stamp card. Witness Abdul Bin Ock described seeing the suspect slash victim Mutahar Murshed Ali&apos;s face: &#x201C;His face almost fell off,&#x201D; Ock told the News. &#x201C;His cheek ripped. There was so much blood. Every time he looks in the mirror, he has to see the same scar the rest of his life.&quot; </p>

<p>You can see surveillance video from that morning below: in it, Ali is sitting in a chair behind the counter before the suspect pulls out a blade. The attacker suddenly dives onto the counter and cuts open the clerk&#x2019;s face&#x2014;opening up a gash from his upper lip to his left sideburn. A different bodega worker there at the time described the attacker as &#x201C;drunk, falling and stumbling.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Ali told police he saw the suspect receive cash from an underage girl outside the store&#x2014;he believes the man was trying to buy the beer for the girl. According to the News, the suspect was described as a black man between the ages of 25 and 30, with short black hair and brown eyes, wearing black jeans and a white T-shirt, and carrying a black backpack.</p>
