<p>A little over a year ago, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130305014553/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/22/homeless_man_beaten_on_video_in_nj.php">we were horrified</a> by a video of two young New Jersey men <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130305014553/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/20/video_beating_bums_is_still_a_thing.php">beating up a homeless man</a>, seemingly for fun. One of those men, 22-year-old Taylor Giresi, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130305014553/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/nj_man_gets_years_for_videotaped_QyBjl2GXRfsYzsQKpMm1zI">has now been sentenced</a> to three years in prison for beating 50-year-old victim David Ivins. &quot;I already apologized to the homeless man; I knew him,&quot; Giresi said during sentencing. &quot;It wasn&apos;t like anything serious. But when I put it on YouTube it got serious. I wasn&apos;t trying to hurt the man.&quot;</p>

<p>In his plea deal, Giresi pled guilty to conspiring to use a juvenile (his 17-year-old companion) to commit a crime; as a result, the more serious charges, including assault and theft (the two allegedly stole Ivins&apos; bicycle), were dropped. Giresi&apos;s lawyer argued that his client has a low IQ and numerous psychological problems; he also claimed that Giresi was being egged on by the 17-year-old who was filming the beating. That 17-year-old spent more than two months in a state youth detention center, and later received a one-year suspended sentence, and was placed on probation.</p>

<p>&quot;What I did was wrong,&quot; said Giresi, who claimed he was under the influence &quot;of marijuana and something else&quot; that day. &quot;I wasn&apos;t thinking right. He said the wrong thing at the wrong time; I reacted on it.&quot; In the aftermath of the cruel beating, Ivins <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130305014553/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/22/homeless_man_beaten_on_video_in_nj.php">described the experience</a>: &#x201C;No good people, man. No good kids or youngsters. I think they should go away man...Scared me man&#x2014;kicking me in the face and kicking me in the chest.&quot;</p>

<p>You can see the disturbing original video below. In perhaps the most disturbing part, Giresi knocks over Ivins, causing his nose to start bleeding. &quot;Oh, my God, you&apos;re bleeding!&quot; the 17-year-old cameraman says. &quot;We didn&apos;t mean to do that. I&apos;m sorry. I&apos;m so sorry. Wipe off the blood.&quot; The cameraman then tells Giresi to give Ivins a hug. Except when Ivins reaches out to accept one, Giresi goes ahead and knees him in the stomach. For good measure, he later kicks in him the head.</p>
