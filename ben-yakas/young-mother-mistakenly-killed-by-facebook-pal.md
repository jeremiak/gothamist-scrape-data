Bolivia Beck, 21, was walking with her 21-year-old boyfriend, ex-con Joey Colon, when mutual friend Gary Davis encountered them Monday night at the Millbrook Houses in the South Bronx. He allegedly fired two shots in an apparent attempt to kill Colon, but instead hit Beck in the head.<p></p>

Beck, who has a four-year-old daughter and worked at Toys &quot;R&quot; Us, died yesterday from her injuries.</p>
