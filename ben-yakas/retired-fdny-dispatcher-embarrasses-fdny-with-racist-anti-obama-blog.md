<p>Is it possible to go a week without another FDNY-related racist social media meltdown? This week, FDNY said <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408145519/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/fdny_will_tweak_its_tweeters_wFs60GD7gsU4657xzJgUwO?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20Local">they will issue</a> new &#x201C;guidelines for social media usage&#x201D; in the wake of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408145519/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/31/multiple_fdny_emts_have_posted_grap.php">several high profile</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408145519/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/24/ems_bad_lieutenant_cries_when_racis.php">embarrassing</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408145519/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/18/fdny_commissioners_son_resigns_afte.php">incidents</a>. But will it apply to former or retired members? Because even if it doesn&apos;t, they&apos;re probably going to want to talk to retired FDNY dispatcher Edmund Schneider about his &quot;anti Obama anti libtard&quot; blog, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408145519/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/fdny_blog_bigot_iq55UnelQAZy1rD60jCnhL?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Brooklyn">in which he rails against</a> &#x201C;Negroes,&#x201D; &#x201C;Mooslims&#x201D; and &#x201C;fags.&quot;</p>

<p>Schneider, 71, retired from the FDNY 23 years ago (he receives a monthly pension of approximately $1.5K). But his whole online persona is based around being the &quot;FDNY Retiree,&quot; tweeting as &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408145519/https://twitter.com/FDNYRetired">FDNYRetired&quot;</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408145519/https://twitter.com/FDNYretiree">&quot;FDNYRetiree,&quot;</a> and selling FDNY-emblazoned merchandise (placemats, bookmarks, CDs of 9/11 images) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408145519/http://fdnyretiree.com/">on his blog.</a> Some of the most offensive posts seem to have been deleted now, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408145519/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/fdny_blog_bigot_iq55UnelQAZy1rD60jCnhL?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Brooklyn">the Post preserved</a> some for the history books:</p>

<ul>
	<li>&#x201C;If you ACT like a n-----, you&#x2019;re gonna be CALLED a n-----!&#x201D; he warned in a February post accompanied by a photo of a black woman with watermelon rinds on her chest.</li>
	<li>&#x201C;Negroes commit by FAR the bulk of the violent crime in the United States,&#x201D; he wrote in March. &#x201C;But why? Simple, really, it&#x2019; something called a &#x2018;FAMILY,&#x2019; &#x2014; which is foreign to the average Negro, who lives in a household run by a &#x2018;mammy ho&#x2019; who pumps out kids like a bunny for welfare checks.&#x201D;</li>
	<li>&#x201C;Politically correct imbeciles decided to grant the &#x2018;mostly female Negro&#x2019; 911 dispatchers virtually lateral access to the &#x2018;mostly white male&#x2019; FDNY dispatch force. And they destroyed it!&#x201D; he wrote.</li>
	<li>Of First Lady Michelle Obama, he snipes, &#x201C;The Mooch sure as hell has a big, fat ass! And it&#x2019;s black, too.&#x201D; He also calls President Obama a &#x201C;black bastard&#x201D; and &#x201C;the anti-Christ.&#x201D;</li>
	<li>Bill Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton (a &#x201C;lessie&#x201D;) &#x201C;flipped on fags&#x201D; to support &#x201C;fruitcake marriage.&#x201D;</li>
	<li>&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t Trust a Single Damned Muslim!&#x201D; he titled another diatribe.</li>
</ul>

<p>Schneider, who lives in Florida, defended himself to the Post: &#x201C;Offensive is in the eye of the beholder. It&#x2019;s not hate speech. It&#x2019;s all opinion, and it&#x2019;s all based on fact,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m not a racist. Some of my best friends in the Fire Department were black, and some of them were over at my house.&#x201D; But all of that doesn&apos;t mean the FDNY is too pleased with what their former staff member is writing: &#x201C;The vile and despicable ramblings on this Web site are clearly the work of a sick individual with way too much time on his hands,&#x201D; an FDNY spokesman said. &#x201C;We have referred the matter to the Law Department.&#x201D;</p>

<p>At least Schneider wasn&apos;t too upset at the Post for calling him out today: </p>
