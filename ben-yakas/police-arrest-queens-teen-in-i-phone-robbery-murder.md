Police <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140922013142/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/queens/queens_teen_arrested_for_alleged_uVMS3gccRttXhXQO5ROk4N?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">have now arrested</a> 17-year-old Stephon Huffman for the botched robbery and murder of Patrick Dixon. </p>

<p>Police say Dixon, 17, was exiting a bus with a friend around 11 a.m. on 142nd Street around Foch Boulevard last Friday, when five teens approached them and attempted to take Dixon&apos;s iPhone. When Dixon fought back, Huffman allegedly sliced his neck; the crew then panicked when they saw the blood, and fled the scene. </p>

<p>Huffman was identified by witnesses from a photo array, and is charged with murder, robbery tampering with evidence and criminal possession of a weapon. According to  what appears to be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140922013142/http://www.myspace.com/youngsteph123">Stephon Huffman&apos;s MySpace</a>, Huffman hails from the &quot;CITY OF YANKEE HATZ.&quot;</p>
