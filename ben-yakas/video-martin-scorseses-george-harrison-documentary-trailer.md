<p>In October, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405013847/http://blogs.indiewire.com/thompsononhollywood/2011/08/24/trailer_watch_scorseses_george_harrison_doc/">HBO will debut</a> Martin Scorsese&apos;s two-part documentary, <em>George Harrison: Living in a Material World</em>, nearly a decade since the &quot;quiet&quot; Beatle died of lung cancer. The documentary, which was first pitched to Scorsese by Harrison&apos;s widow Olivia in 2005,  includes new interviews with Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr, Yoko Ono, George Martin, Tom Petty, and Eric Clapton (who recalls watching Harrison write &quot;Here Comes the Sun&quot;).  Watch the trailer below:</p>

<p>Scorsese says that the heart of the film lies in Harrison&apos;s spiritual quest, which started once the Beatles first became successful: &quot;He was trying to find a way to simplicity, a way to live truthfully and compassionately. It was never a straight line, but that&apos;s not the point. I think he found an understanding: that there&apos;s no such thing as &apos;success&apos; - there&apos;s just the path,&quot; said Scorsese. </p>

The two-part documentary will premiere on HBO on October 5 and 6.</p>
