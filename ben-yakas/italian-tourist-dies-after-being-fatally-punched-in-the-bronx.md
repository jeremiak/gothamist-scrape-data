<p>An Italian tourist in NYC to visit his girlfriend was fatally punched outside a bodega in the Bronx on Friday. Police say that Oliver D&#x2019;Orio, 37, was punched in the face around 12:10 a.m. yesterday in front of Guerrero Bodega on Washington Avenue and East 184th Street. He hit his head on the sidewalk and immediately lost consciousness; he was taken to St. Barnabas Hospital where he was pronounced dead. You can see video of the punch below:</p>

<p>Witnesses say that D&apos;Orio was asking customers, including the suspect, at the bodega for alcohol when the incident happened: &quot;[D&apos;Orio] was pestering [the suspect], saying, &apos;Buy me a beer, buy me a beer,&apos;&quot; bodega clerk Julio Minier <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140526200038/http://nypost.com/2014/05/23/swiss-tourist-killed-in-the-bronx/">told the Post</a>. &quot;They came out onto the street and when the fight started he punched him with an open hand. The man went down. I knew he was dead when he hit the ground.&quot; </p>

<p>Other locals told the Post that D&apos;Orio, who was reportedly drunk and carrying a banana that night, had been menacing people prior to the incident: &quot;Last night he was yelling outside and banging outside the Phoenix House [rehab center]. He was yelling and banging on the door&#x2026;holding a bottle of [booze] ten minutes before he was put down,&quot; said neighbor Luis Williams.</p>

<p>D&apos;Orio, an Italian citizen who lives in Switzerland, had been in the city for 10 days; he was planning to fly home next Thursday. &quot;That guy didn&#x2019;t mean to kill him,&#x201D; a witness named Frankie <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140526200038/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/italian-man-visiting-ny-dies-fistfight-bronx-bodega-article-1.1803357">told the News</a>. &quot;They started fighting and he fell back and hit his head&#x2014;and he didn&#x2019;t get back up.&quot;</p>
