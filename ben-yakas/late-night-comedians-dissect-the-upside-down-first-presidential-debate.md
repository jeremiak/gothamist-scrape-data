<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108030738/http://gothamist.com/2016/09/26/clinton_trump_debate_2016.php">first 2016 presidential debate</a> between Hillary Clinton and Ambulatory Cheetos Product Placement Ad was filled with sniffles, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108030738/http://gothamist.com/2016/09/27/debate_takeaways.php#photo-1">mansplaining</a>, incorrect facts <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108030738/http://gothamist.com/2016/09/27/trump_stop_and_frisk.php">about stop-and-frisk</a>, and all the Rosie O&apos;Donnell insults one could hope for. The consensus is that Clinton <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108030738/https://twitter.com/SteveKornacki/status/780753243966177280">handily &quot;won&quot;</a> the debate, unless you think Trump is incapable of losing anything (or if you&apos;re <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108030738/https://twitter.com/davidfrum/status/780580701422755840">a wee bit misogynistic and very unaware of it</a>). But don&apos;t believe us (or the polls), believe the late night comedians (and their hard-working teams!) who scrambled to analyze, dissect and mock the debates barely an hour after they finished on live television. </p>

<p>First up: Stephen Colbert broke down the debate in his monologue, from Trump&apos;s constant sniffing (which made him &quot;sound like the coked-up best man in the bathroom at a wedding&quot;) to the one word that summed up the night (Trump&apos;s constant interjections of &quot;WRONG&quot;).</p>

<p>Colbert also talked to an &quot;undecided voter&quot; played by guest Rob Lowe.</p>

<p>Trevor Noah and <em>The Daily Show</em> had a bounty of clips (seriously, kudos to the editors and writers who had to put this together in about thirty minutes) from the debate, and took umbrage with Trump&apos;s insults against third-world airports: &#x201C;Our airports are nicer than yours, Donald Trump,&quot; Noah, who is from South Africa, said. &quot;Asshole, you didn&#x2019;t land in a third world country; don&#x2019;t involve us in your problems.&quot;</p>

<p>Seth Meyers used his excellent &quot;A Closer Look&quot; segment to dive into Trump&apos;s seven favorite (and only?) words: Best, Huge, Ivanka, Big, Wall, Great and Tremendous.</p>

<p>Jimmy Kimmel came at it with a slightly different (but very Kimmel) angle, interviewing people on the street about <em>their</em> reactions to the debate&#x2014;only he did so Monday afternoon, hours before the debate even happened.</p>

<p>Jimmy Fallon added his typically trenchant political commentary on the state of our political discourse in a segment in which he forced <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108030738/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AinrgnXqT8k">Samuel L. Jackson to yell at kittens.</a></p>

<p>And of course, the best commentary of the evening comes via Seinfeld2000:</p>
