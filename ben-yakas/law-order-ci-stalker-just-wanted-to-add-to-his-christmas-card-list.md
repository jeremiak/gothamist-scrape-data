<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="62310erbe.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811094334im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/62310erbe.jpg" width="230" height="349" class="image-left"> </span>The man who was accused of stalking <em>Law and Order: Criminal Intent</em> star Kathryn Erbe <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811094334/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/29/law_and_order_star_stalked_by_singe.php">earlier this year</a> was charged with interstate stalking by federal prosecutors yesterday. Charles Nagel, 36, of Philadelphia, was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811094334/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/creepy_law_order_fan_charged_with_n87Zxob9ZW7faMP1F9XDhN">arrested</a> on state misdemeanor charges in March after he had accosted the actress on the <em>Law and Order</em> set several times over the past two years. Maybe he was just trying to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811094334/http://gothamist.com/2008/05/03/umas_stalker_wa.php">amuse her</a>?</p>

<p>Nagel initially convinced Erbe he was a just a longtime fan, and got her to pose for photos with his two daughters, Batgirl and Harley Quinn (both named after Batman characters); he later <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811094334/http://www.nydailynews.com/gossip/2010/06/22/2010-06-22_man_charged_with_stalking_law__order_actress_kathryn_erbe.html">wrote</a> Erbe a 7-page long letter in April 2009 filled with &quot;his demented observations,&quot; including: &quot;I am absolutely spellbound by your beauty, your so expressive, adorable &amp; sexy and your aged to perfection...<strong>I am not trying to invade your privacy. I just want to be friends with you...and add you to my Christmas card list.&quot; </strong></p>

<p>Nagel also used the pseudonym &quot;Cindy Momberger&quot; on Facebook to try contacting her, writing, &quot;I pray to GOD you will talk to me and end my heartache. It&#x2019;s only harmless communication...I&#x2019;m not after anything else. Honest!&#x201D; He also reached out to Erbe&apos;s relatives, and eventually posted a photo of Erbe&apos;s brother with a hand-drawn penis superimposed on it, as well as a photo of Erbe&apos;s 14-year-old daughter with a hand-drawn cockroach on her face and the words &quot;I&apos;m ugly!&quot; coming out of her mouth. Nagel faces up to five years in prison if convicted.</p>
