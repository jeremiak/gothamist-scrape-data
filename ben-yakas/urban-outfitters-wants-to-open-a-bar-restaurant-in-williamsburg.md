<p>In March, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502104826/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/05/anthropologie_and_urban_outfitters.php">we learned than there will</a> soon be new places for men to sit on couches when Anthropologie and Urban Outfitters open stores in Williamsburg. With the stores neighboring a Whole Foods and American Apparel (appropriately), this is set to create a Commercial Hipster Mecca that could stand as a tribute to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502104826/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/16/ny_times_trolls_brooklyn_hipsters_w.php">wheat-paste sloganeers and futurism consultants</a>. But it&apos;s not enough just to provide the classiest place to buy your knockoff <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502104826/http://gothamist.com/2011/07/30/did_urban_outfitters_rip_off_black.php">Black Flag Four Logo shirts</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502104826/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/19/urban_outfitters_offering_two_bushw.php">Bushwick-branded sleeveless tees</a>: Urban Outfitters also wants to get you drunk.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502104826/http://newyork.grubstreet.com/2013/05/urban-outfitters-williamsburg-restaurant-bar.html?mid=twitter_thecutblog">Grub Street noticed</a> that Urban Outfitters was on the agenda of more than 50 bars and restaurants up for liquor licenses at Monday night&apos;s CB1 Brooklyn meeting <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502104826/http://www.nyc.gov/html/bkncb1/downloads/pdf/combined_notice_05132013.pdf">PDF</a>). The form lists: &quot;Urban Outfitters, Inc, 98 North 6th Street (new, liquor, rest).&quot; The store hasn&apos;t officially filled out a liquor license application, but this is the first step in that process. It&apos;s unclear what form the restaurant might come in (could it be a sidewalk cafe? an in-house deli), but it&apos;s clear the company has big ambitions with the project. </p>

<p>At least this way we may be able to answer an age-old question: how drunk do you have to get to buy <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502104826/http://www.urbanoutfitters.com/urban/catalog/productdetail.jsp?id=24849424m&amp;parentid=SEARCH+RESULTS">Tiger Hipster underwear?</a></p>
