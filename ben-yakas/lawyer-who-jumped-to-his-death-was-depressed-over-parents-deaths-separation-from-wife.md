<p>An attorney <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141023002641/http://gothamist.com/2014/03/07/lawyer_suicide.php">jumped to his death</a> onto scaffolding outside of a building near City Hall on Friday morning. Leonard Morton, 45, was declared dead after police found his body lying facedown on the scaffolding on Broadway near Barclay Street around 7:20 a.m. yesterday. Friends say that Morton was bipolar, and was suffering from depression due to a separation from his wife, as well as the death of both of his parents. &quot;He was going through a terrible, terrible depression,&#x201D; close friend Linda March <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141023002641/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/lawyer-jumps-death-broadway-building-article-1.1714319">told the News</a>. &quot;He was a very intelligent person and a very good lawyer.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;For the past week something was definitely wrong with him,&quot; Juan Diaz, a receptionist at the law firm where Morton worked, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141023002641/http://nypost.com/2014/03/07/lawyer-falls-to-death-from-12th-floor-office/">told the Post</a>. &quot;Usually he comes in and says hello and asks me how I&#x2019;m doing. But for the past week he never said anything.&quot; Morton, who ran <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141023002641/http://lenmortonlaw.com/attorneys">his own law practice</a> in the building, was also an adjunct professor at Hunter College; he formerly served as an administrative law judge for the city and was also a captain in the New York Army National Guard Judge Advocate General Corps. </p>

<p>Morton was reportedly pulled into his depression when his mother, Deanna Morton, died in her sleep in November 2011; Morton&apos;s father died within the next year. Friends told the News that Morton was able to pull out of the depression last year, but went into a manic phase a few months ago, eventually separating from his wife of three years. &quot;He could get very boisterous and very loud when he was in that stage,&quot; March said. &quot;It was very hard for her to deal with that.&quot;</p>

<p><em>If someone you know exhibits warning signs of suicide: do not leave the person alone, remove any firearms, alcohol, drugs or sharp objects that could be used in a suicide attempt, and call the U.S. National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 800-273-TALK (8255) or take the person to an emergency room or seek help from a medical or mental health professional.</em></p>
