<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021215339/http://gothamist.com/tags/winterstorm">big winter storm</a> has swallowed our city and turned it into the inside of a particularly fearsome snow globe, shutting down <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021215339/http://gothamist.com/2017/02/09/snow_flights_canceled.php">airports and bridges</a>, and generally creating the perfect conditions for Bane to size control of the city. But there is one exciting development: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021215339/http://gothamist.com/tags/thundersnow">Thundersnow</a>, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021215339/http://gothamist.com/2010/12/26/rare_thundersnow_happening_in_manha.php">&quot;holy grail&quot;</a> of meteorological events, has already struck all across Connecticut&#x2014;and has seemingly made it to NYC as well!</p>
