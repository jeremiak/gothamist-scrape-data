                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="51813googa.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20131224063340im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/51813googa.jpg" width="640" height="427"> <br> <i> Nothing captures the spirit of Brooklyn like a Lexus parked in the middle of Prospect Park (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131224063340/https://twitter.com/Lexus/status/335782894985433088">Lexus Twitter</a>)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>After weeks of anticipation, griping, and anticipatory griping, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131224063340/http://gothamist.com/tags/googamooga">The Great GoogaMooga food and music festival</a> got underway on a beautiful Friday yesterday with a big concert (The Darkness/The Flaming Lips/Yeah Yeah Yeahs) and lots of vendors. Now that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131224063340/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/18/ny_times_film_critic_still_hates_go.php">AO Scott has started hatetweeting</a> like a witty <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131224063340/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb2zIR2rvRQ">Kraken</a> who hasn&apos;t gotten his quail eggs, it really feels like old times. But <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131224063340/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/16/googamooga.php">organizers promised that</a> this year&apos;s festivities would correct some of their previous mistakes (see: excessive lines, food shortage, beer shortage, lack of vegetarian options, cell phone service). People seem more pleased with this year&apos;s festival than not&#x2014;although there are still some <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131224063340/http://stomachmonster.wordpress.com/2013/05/18/the-great-googamooga/">very unhappy people</a>. Reporter <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131224063340/https://twitter.com/LaurenFaceEvans">Lauren Evans</a> sent us this report from yesterday.</p>

<blockquote>The food was between $8 and $12&#x2014;most of it seemed to be around $10. The Coffin Bao Fried Chicken was roughly the size of a grown man&apos;s fist, and, for all intents and purposes, appeared to be a piece of fried chicken inside a donut. So...delicious. Best deal that I saw was the free range buttermilk dipped fried chicken strips ($10) from Dirty Bird. There were several, and they were juicy. The worst deal looked like the $12 bacon flights from Baconland. They were just a few strips of bacon artfully arranged on a plate. For $12, I&apos;d want at least half a pound. 

<p>The place filled up as the evening wore on, but we never waited more than a few minutes. Earlier in the night, around 7 p.m., some vendors like Fatty Cue were actually soliciting people to come to their stands. </p>

<p>Remarkably un-scarring Port-o-Potty experience. Little to no lines. </p>

<p>Lots of Coachella-esque festival getups. Knit shirts, bad leg tattoos. A girl in a coonskin cap with what appeared to be a bloody nose screamed &quot;Sarah!&quot; directly into my face. This was around 6:30 p.m. </p>

<p>The sound was actually pretty good. I could hear Wayne Coyne and Karen O&apos;s respective shrieks from a surprising distance around the park. </p>

<p><strong>Cell phone service: Still spotty, but not hopeless.</strong></p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>&quot;Not hopeless.&quot; What more could we ask for from a three-day festival that will gross over <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131224063340/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/17/a-curious-costbenefit-analysis-of-a-park-fund-raiser/?ref=nyregion">a million dollars and cause lots of damage around the park</a>!

<p>So far, today seems a bit quieter, perhaps with people nervous about the overcast weather. On the plus side, around noon, there were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131224063340/https://twitter.com/annezelek/status/335791714243592193">no lines for beer.</a> </p>
