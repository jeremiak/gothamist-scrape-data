<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="91710goldman.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110706134256im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/91710goldman.jpg" width="250" height="174" class="image-left"> </span>Goldman Sachs, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110706134256/http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/12697/64796">&quot;vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity,&quot;</a> gave its largest donation ever to the Harlem Children&#x2019;s Zone yesterday. Goldman Sachs Gives, a fund supported by the investment company and its partners, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110706134256/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/09/16/harlem-childrens-zone-gets-20-million-gift/">gave $20 million</a> to the charter school operators, toward the creation of a new school and community center at Harlem&#x2019;s St. Nicholas Houses. Their massive donation (some perspective: $20 million is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110706134256/http://voices.washingtonpost.com/postpartisan/2010/07/sec_settlement_is_a_major_vict.html">approximately what Goldman earns in 1/2 a day</a>) comes on the heels of a major <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110706134256/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/15/women_sue_goldman_sachs_for_male_co.php">gender bias lawsuit</a>, which the more cynical among us may say is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110706134256/http://gothamist.com/2010/01/11/goldman_sachs_to_donate_money_so_it.php">convenient timing</a> for such an announcement.</p>

<p>Former VP Cristina Chen-Oster, former managing director Lisa Parisi, and former associate Shanna Orlich accuse <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110706134256/http://gothamist.com/tags/goldmansachs">Goldman</a> of a persistent pattern of bias toward its female employees, including a noticeable lack of women in top managerial positions. The NY Times <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110706134256/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/16/business/16bias.html?_r=3&amp;ref=business">recaps some of the details and accusations</a>: Chen-Oster, who worked at the company for nearly a decade, said she experienced &#x201C;increased hostility and marginalization at the firm&#x201D; after a married colleague kissed and groped her following an employee celebration at strip club Scores. Orlich paints the company as a boy&apos;s club, with push-up contests and frequent golf outings which she was never invited to (despite being a varsity golf player in high school). The lawsuit also claims that a managing director also hired scantily clad female escorts wearing Santa hats to attend a holiday party.</p>

When women are excluded from strip club outings, they miss out on networking and deal-making that can be critical to their career climb.&quot; </p>

<p>Former Goldman employee Nomi Prins <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110706134256/http://www.businessinsider.com/nomi-prins-i-left-goldman-because-i-got-sick-of-the-soulless-pursuit-of-pay-and-promotion-2010-9">writes that she&apos;s unsurprised</a> about the lawsuit, but that money is the only important signifier for the company: &quot;The truth is, I left because... I know exactly what I need to do to be successful here, and I have no desire to do it... And part of that was due to the fact that I was sick of haggling with the men in my chain and the soulless pursuit of promotion and pay, and wanted my life to take another direction.&quot;</p>
