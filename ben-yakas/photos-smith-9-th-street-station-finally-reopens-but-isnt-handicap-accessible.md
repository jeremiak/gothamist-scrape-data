It took an intensive two-year, $32 million station rehabilitation project, but the highest subway station in the world is now refurbished and fully functional&#x2014;for everyone but the handicapped. &quot;Other than that, the train station is wonderful,&quot; Dannelle Johnson of Red Hook told us. &quot;Just include the handicapped accessible and it&apos;s at 100%. Right now it&apos;s at 95%.&quot;</p>

<p>Before renovations, local resident John Montalvo (who you can see in photo #5 above) was able to traverse the station with some struggle; he looked forward to the renovations expecting there would be improvements for handicapped people like himself. Now, he is disappointed and &quot;so fucking pissed&quot;; not only is there no wheelchair access&#x2014;there are an extra set of stairs just to enter the building. There&apos;s even an area to the side of the entrance that would have been perfect for a ramp (see photo #3)&#x2014;but instead, there are just more stairs there. </p>

<p>MTA spokesman Kevin Ortiz tells us there were structural issues that made it impossible to install an elevator: &quot;The design for ADA elevators at this station was structurally unwieldy and financially prohibitive due to the station&apos;s layout.  There are ADA stations along the F line at Jay Street-MetroTech and Church Avenue.&quot; </p>

<p>It&apos;s unfortunate that there can&apos;t be more done to aide the disabled, people with walkers or strollers, and the elderly, because otherwise, the station is quite impressive all around, with a new architectural metal panel escalator enclosure, two escalators, state-of-the-art public address and CCTV systems, and a 14-foot-tall mosaic. There&apos;s also a permanent extension of the G train to Church Street. </p>

<p>&quot;It will definitely be nice to have the new station instead of having to walk up to Carroll Street, and maybe I&apos;ll be able to reliably catch the F train there,&quot; said Carroll Gardens resident Eleanor, who declined to give her last name. &quot;The F is always packed during rush hour and it&apos;s not uncommon for people to have to wait for multiple trains to get on at Carroll or Bergen. Even though the F is a direct commuting route for me, the platform is sometimes so packed that I end up taking the G and transferring to the A/C just to get to work in Dumbo. We&apos;ll see how Monday goes.&quot; </p>
