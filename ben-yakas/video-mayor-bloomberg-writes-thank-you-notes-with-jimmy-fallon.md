<p>With a new mayor on the way riding a wave of populist anger over his administration, it&apos;s safe to say <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422150355/http://gothamist.com/tags/mayorbloomberg">Mayor Bloomberg</a> has been a bit checked out lately. But with only a few weeks left in office, he took a break from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422150355/http://gothamist.com/2013/12/02/report_bloomberg_kept_on_golfing_in.php">playing golf in Bermuda</a> to stop by Late Night With Jimmy Fallon to write some thank you notes to Fallon, Jay Z, the statue of liberty, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422150355/http://gothamist.com/tags/sodaban">Big Sodas</a>: &quot;Thank you large sodas for not taking it personally.&quot;</p>

<p>This is probably the loosest and most comfortable we&apos;ve seen Bloomberg in...years? Ever? Usually he&apos;s extra awkward in obligatory media appearances, but those extra hours on the course really have done wonders for his aura. </p>
