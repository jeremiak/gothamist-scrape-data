<p>There were a lot of victims affected by the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144918/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/14/chris_brown_tweets_photo_of_injured.php">out of control bottle fight</a> at Soho club WiP (Work in Progress) last week&#x2014;that includes Chris Brown, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144918/http://gothamist.com/tags/drake">Drake</a>, their respective entourages, unsuspecting <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144918/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/14/photos_tourist_claims_she_was_hit_b.php#photo-1">Australian tourists</a>, blood-soaked SUV&apos;s, and Rihanna&apos;s reputation. Oh yeah, and multimillionaire basketball star Tony Parker, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144918/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/san-antonio-spurs-guard-tony-parker-suing-w-i-p-club-20-million-scratched-retina-suffered-chris-brown-drake-brawl-article-1.1100276?localLinksEnabled=false">who is now suing</a> the club and its operators for $20 million over a scratched retina.</p>

<p>Parker, who plays for the San Antonio Spurs, alleges the club&apos;s security and supervision was negligent for allowing the brawl to ever happen. He alleges the club knew there was &quot;bad blood between Drake and Brown,&quot; and kept selling alcohol to them and their crews anyway, despite the fact that some were &quot;visibly intoxicated.&quot; </p>

<p>When the bottles started getting thrown, Parker says he was hit by shards of glass, which scratched his cornea. Well, if it&apos;s any consolation, that fight has ruined Jay-Z&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144918/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20120621/prospect-heights/jay-zs-barclays-center-4040-club-wont-have-bottle-service">new 40/40 club at Barclays Center</a>, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144918/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/17/has_the_drakechris_brown_spat_ruine.php">threatened the future of bottle service</a> in NYC as we know it. And as for any more consolation, there&apos;s always <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144918/http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=5744114">that $50 million contract</a> Parker signed with the Spurs.</p>
