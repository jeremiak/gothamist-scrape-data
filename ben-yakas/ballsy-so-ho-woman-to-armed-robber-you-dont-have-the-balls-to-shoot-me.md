<p>A SoHo resident stood up to an armed mugger last week, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406163737/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20130710/soho/soho-woman-tells-armed-robber-he-didnt-have-balls-shoot-cops-say">telling him to his face</a> that he didn&apos;t have the balls to shoot her. Anna Graham, 54, was smoking a cigarette in her pajamas in front of her home on Grand Street around 1 a.m. on July 3rd when two robbers approached her and demanded her wallet. &#x201C;He asked me for my wallet and I said, &#x2018;Are you kidding me?&#x2019; &#x201D; Graham <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406163737/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/gutsy-soho-woman-tells-armed-mugger-doesn-b-s-shoot-cops-article-1.1395048">told the Daily News</a>. &#x201C;I was in my pajamas, for Christ&#x2019;s sake!&quot;</p>

<p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s when the gun went against my forehead,&#x201D; Graham, who was in front of a friend&apos;s car at the time, continued. &#x201C;He said, &#x2018;I&#x2019;ll shoot you, b---h!&#x2019; I said, &#x2018;No, you won&#x2019;t.&#x2019; &#x201D; At that point, the accomplice told him to shoot her: &#x201C;He lowered it to my chest. The other one was right next to him saying, &#x2018;Shoot! Shoot! Shoot!&#x2019; &#x201D; Graham said she kept eye contact with the one suspect though: &#x201C;I said, &#x2018;It&#x2019;s not easy to shoot someone. You have to have balls to do that. And you have none.&#x2019; &#x201D;</p>

<p>&#x201C;For a second there, I saw fear&#x2014;for just a split second,&quot; she added. &quot;I went against all the rules, everything he knew about life.&#x201D; At that point, a female friend of Graham&apos;s came out of the apartment and tried to pounce on the robbers; another friend came soon after, and called 911. </p>

<p>The muggers fled at that point, but not before grabbing an iPad mini, a Samsung Galaxy cell phone and about $600 in cash from the car. Police add that they still remain at large. A neighbor <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406163737/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/shoot_me_hah_c9rw7kkKVC5WyeJMxksY5K">told the Post</a> that this was par for the course from Graham:  &#x201C;She doesn&#x2019;t take s--t from anyone,&#x201D; said Angus Kneale. </p>

<p>This kind of confrontational approach to muggers doesn&apos;t always end so happily. The &quot;you don&apos;t have the balls to shoot me&quot; remark is chillingly similar to the last words of 28-year-old actress-playwright Nicole duFresne, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406163737/http://gothamist.com/2005/01/28/murder_on_the_lower_east_side.php">who was shot dead in front of her friends</a> on Clinton Street in 2005. duFresne reportedly told a group of teens trying to mug her and her friends, &quot;What are you going to do, shoot us?&quot; 21-year-old Rudy Fleming did just that. <br>
In 2006, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406163737/http://gothamist.com/2006/12/12/nicole_dufresne.php">Fleming was sentenced to life in prison</a> without parole, and the murder in part <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406163737/http://gothamist.com/2008/03/04/richard_prices.php">inspired Richard Price&apos;s excellent novel</a><em> Lush Life.</em></p>
