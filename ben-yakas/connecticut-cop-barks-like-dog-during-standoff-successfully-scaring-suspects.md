<p>Connecticut police channeled Loki, the god of trickery, to deflate a standoff situation this week. New Haven cops <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130510154744/http://articles.courant.com/2013-03-29/community/hc-new-haven-felons-0330-20130329_1_police-dog-hamden-officers-k-9-unit">were led on a chase</a> by two convicted felons, who were wanted for a stolen car, on Friday morning around 10:30 a.m. The suspects ended up in a standoff with officers in a three-family home&#x2014;cops told them a K-9 unit would be sent into the house. But since no dogs were actually available, one officer did the most logical thing imaginable: he started barking like a dog.</p>

<p>And it worked! Suspects Kwame Wells-Jordan, 20, and Norman Boone, 23, were freaked out by the barking and walked out of the house where they had been hiding. Wells-Jordan and Boone were charged with theft of a motor vehicle and burglary; police added that other charges could be pending.</p>

<p>As for the quick thinking officer, Gideon Gurley, who witnessed the standoff, was pretty impressed: &quot;They were trained. These cops were trained to do stuff like that,&quot; Gurley <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130510154744/http://www.wfsb.com/story/21830842/suspects-arrested-after-standoff-in-new-haven">told WFSB</a>. &quot;I guess that was the best technique to do what they needed to do to get people out.&quot;</p>
