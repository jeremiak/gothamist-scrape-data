<p>A cabbie who allegedly continually sexually harassed a customer has had his license revoked by the Taxi and Limousine Commission. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405030342/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/cabbie-harasses-customer-making-horny-article-1.1429485">According to the News</a>, Tashfeen Awan was accused of harassing the female customer during a ride on Nov. 14, 2012. <strong>&#x201C;Am I making you uncomfortable, honey, or am I making you horny?&#x201D;</strong> the married father of three asked the woman repeatedly. But maybe he was just a really big Mike Meyers fan, amirite? There are still a few of those out there campaigning for a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405030342/http://screenrant.com/austin-powers-4-mike-myers-official-rob-127932/">fourth <em>Austin Powers</em> film</a>, right??</p>

<p>&#x201C;Oh honey, I bet you like to be on top,&#x201D; Awan allegedly said to the woman. &#x201C;I bet you like to ride the horsey.&#x201D; The woman said she repeatedly told the cabbie she was uncomfortable with his comments, but he continued with his barrage of lines. Awan later testified and admitted that he made some of the comments, but he claimed he it was just innocuous banter. This goes to show, yet again, that if a cabbie must use a popular culture figure as an aspirational figure, they should always stick with Travis Bickle.</p>
