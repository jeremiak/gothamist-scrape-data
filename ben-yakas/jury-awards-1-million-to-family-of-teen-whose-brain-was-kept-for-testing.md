In 2005, 17-year-old Jesse Shipley <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150615044350/http://gothamist.com/2010/10/05/family_said_burying_sons_brain_with.php">died in a car crash</a>; though his family buried him, his brain was kept by the Medical Examiner and discovered in a jar two months later by his classmates on a school trip to the mortuary. &quot;They were outraged that the medical examiner would take organs without telling a family member and hold them for a long time,&quot; the Shipleys&apos; lawyer Anthony L. Galante <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150615044350/http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2011/11/a_jury_awards_1m_to_the_family.html">told SILive</a>, explaining the jury&apos;s decision.<p></p>

<p>The family conducted a second burial after discovering the morgue&apos;s mistake; they buried jars containing his brain and other tissue samples in a small casket on top of the one containing his body. Despite the verdict, the city is planning on appealing, and the family will likely not see the money anytime soon.</p>

<p>Jesse and his sister, Shannon, then 14, were riding in a Mercedes-Benz that collided with an SUV in January 2005. The impact crushed the back seat where Jesse was sitting; Shannon, the front-seat passenger, suffered minor physical injuries. The medical examiner ended up keeping the brain and other parts for study, despite not informing the family. Andre Shipley said, &quot;I physically had [his brain] when it was returned to us from the morgue. It&apos;s my son. It&apos;s part of my son. It&apos;s my flesh. It&apos;s very upsetting, but what can I have done?&quot;</p>
