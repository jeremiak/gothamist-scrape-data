<p>A 28-year-old woman was sexually assaulted near City Hall early Sunday morning. According to police, the woman was on Park Row near Beekman Street, across from City Hall Park, around 4:45 a.m. this morning. The attacker, who the victim described as a Hispanic man wearing a red Adidas jacket, approached her and pulled down her underwear. According <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130519162218/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/cops-hunt-city-hall-perv-article-1.1316295?localLinksEnabled=false">to the News</a>, he then &quot;penetrated with his finger and told her not to scream.&quot;</p>

<p>However the woman did scream, drawing the attention of several nearby construction workers who came over and scared off the attacker. The woman was taken to Beth Israel Hospital in stable condition. No arrests have been made, and police are looking for the suspect. </p>
