<p>Due to damage from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510022159/http://gothamist.com/tags/hurricanesandy">Hurricane Sandy</a> last year, the MTA has started extensive work to repair the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510022159/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/05/r_train_east_river_tunnel_will_prob.php">R train&apos;s East River tunnel</a> and the Greenpoint Tube (which carries <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510022159/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/05/g_train_hell_greenpoint_tunnel_will.php">the G train</a> under Newtown Creek). It&apos;s bad enough that the R and G trains are going to be messy for the next year&#x2014;Chairman Thomas Prendergast revealed yesterday that even more lines will need a lot of work to repair damage as well.</p>

<p>&#x201C;Nine of the tubes were damaged pretty substantially,&#x201D; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510022159/http://nypost.com/2013/09/17/superstorm-sandy-subway-damage-remains-extensive/">he said at a breakfast</a> of the Citizen Budget Commission. &#x201C;We&#x2019;re going after the two that were damaged the most. We know there&#x2019;s problems in the other tubes, but we really can&#x2019;t deal with those until we deal with these.&#x201D; The next up on the list:  the Cranberry Street Tunnel, which serves the A and C lines, and the Clark Street Tunnel, which serves the 2 and 3 lines. </p>

<p>After that, there&apos;s damage on the Joralemon Street and Rutgers tubes, which serve the 4, 5 and F trains, and on the Canarsie tube, which serves the L train. So Sandy will still be [euphemism for not-so-gently making love] with the city for years to come! On the plus side, at least scientists assure us that another freak hurricane will <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510022159/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/17/good_news_sandy_wont_happen_again_f.php"> not hit the city in our lifetimes</a>, nope no way.</p>
