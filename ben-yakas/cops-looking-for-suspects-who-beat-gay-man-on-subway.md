<p>Earlier this week, a 23-year-old gay man <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130224132718/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/20/gay_man_beaten_on_subway_while_stra.php">said he was beaten on the subway</a> in a vicious homophobic attack while other straphangers looked on and did nothing. Cops have now sent out a crime sheet on the incident, as well as sketches of two of the six suspects (which you can see above) who are accused of beating Urena Morel Frankelly.</p>

<p>The incident happened around 6 p.m. last Monday when Frankelly and his partner boarded a southbound 2 train at 125th Street. A woman on the train began taking photos of them; when they asked her to stop, her friend unleashed a homophobic verbal tirade. That escalated into the six attackers, three men and three women, physically assaulting Frankelly. </p>

<p>They were able to get off at 96th Street; Frankelly was transported to St. Luke&#x2019;s Hospital, where they treated him for a laceration over his left eye and several facial lacerations.  &#x201C;Everyone was watching &#x2014; no one helped us,&quot; Frankelly&apos;s partner told the News. &quot;That was a very scary situation for us.&#x201D; Police say all six suspects are &quot;described as dark skinned [and] in their early twenties.&quot;</p>

<p>Anyone with information in regards to this assault is asked to call the NYPD&apos;s Crime Stoppers Hotline at 800-577-TIPS. The public can also submit their tips by logging onto the Crime Stoppers Website at WWW.NYPDCRIMESTOPPERS.COM or texting their tips to 274637(CRIMES) then enter TIP577.</p>
