<p>Jon Stewart has been mostly MIA during this election season, only popping up here and there to hang out <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170904214951/http://gothamist.com/2016/07/22/jon_stewart_trump_rnc.php">with Stephen Colbert</a>, smear Cheetos <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170904214951/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/11/jon_stewart_donald_trump.php">on his face</a>, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170904214951/http://gothamist.com/2016/05/21/jon_stewart_saves_horse_attacked_by.php">save a pony</a>. We were really hoping that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170904214951/http://gothamist.com/2015/11/03/stew_beef_content_machine.php">his deal with HBO</a> would mean he&apos;d be on air more to hold our hands through this nightmare election, but we&apos;ll have to settle for what we get. Last night, Stewart performed at the annual <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170904214951/http://gothamist.com/tags/standupforheroes">Stand Up For Heroes</a> benefit show (which was presented by and kicked off the New York Comedy Festival), and told the story of his first Twitter beef with Donald Trump, which led to him nicknaming Trump, &apos;Fuckface Von Clownstick.&apos;</p>

<p>&quot;You might be asking yourself, &apos;Jon, have you had any experiences with either candidate that might be relevant?&apos;&quot; he introduced the story. &quot;And I&#x2019;m glad you brought that up.&quot; Watch Stewart tell the story in the video below.</p>

<p>&quot;I thought when a guy got off a bus and says, &apos;I&apos;m going to grab her on the pussy,&apos; then okay, we&apos;re done. The election is over,&quot; Stewart said during the show. &quot;Usually that is a signifier that we don&apos;t have to pay attention anymore.&quot; Stewart insisted that he&apos;s been out of the game long enough that he&apos;s &quot;not as much of a political analyst,&quot; but he still was incredulous over the state of the election: &quot;Then the FBI jumps in, and all of a sudden there&apos;s a whole new thing... and then it goes back to Anthony Weiner? This is insane... as a writer, honestly, the first woman president and she&apos;s taken down by Bush and Weiner, like, that&apos;s just bad writing.&quot;</p>

Including this one:</p>

<blockquote>The first is a story of an 80-year-old couple. &#x201C;They&#x2019;re in an alley, up against the fence, and they&#x2019;re screwing the hell out of each other,&#x201D; he said. After falling in exhaustion, Springsteen explained, the woman says to her husband, &#x201C;You didn&#x2019;t screw me like that 50 years ago.&#x201D; The punchline: &#x201C;50 years ago that fence wasn&#x2019;t electrified.&#x201D;</blockquote>
