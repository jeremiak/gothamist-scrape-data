[UPDATE BELOW] <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161023032939/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/19/nyc_stops_broadway_bomb_skateboard.php#photo-1">As we reported this week</a>, NYC officially shut down this year&apos;s permit-less <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161023032939/http://gothamist.com/tags/broadwaybomb">&quot;Broadway Bomb&quot;</a> event, a nearly 8-mile Manhattan race for longboard aficionados in which they skate from West 116th Street by Riverside Park all the way down to the Charging Bull in the Financial District. But the defiant longboarders are out in full force anyway, despite cops setting up roadblocks and cutting off Broadway at various parts on the Upper West Side. &quot;NYPD cop tells me &quot;hundreds, maybe thousands&quot; of #skateboarders are out for the #broadwaybomb,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161023032939/https://twitter.com/CarolineYLChen/status/259689794148384769">tweeted Caroline Chen</a>.

<p>Police have brought lots of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161023032939/https://twitter.com/wingate6256/status/259681819291684865">orange nets</a> with them, so it seems possible that there will be some arrests soon. We&apos;ll update as we learn more information.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: Despite the dominant police presence around the Upper West Side, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161023032939/http://instagram.com/p/RAmZsrxhrE/">and threats</a> that participants would be arrested, it seems that many skaters have made it to the end of the race untouched. &quot;Celebration at the end of the #BroadwayBomb route. The NYPD arrived about 15 min later,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161023032939/https://twitter.com/nycdad/status/259699558790074368">tweeted NYC Dad.</a> &quot;Downtown, the NYPD has stopped battling the skateboarders,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161023032939/https://twitter.com/nycdad/status/259706433812197376">he added.</a></p>

<p>So far, we haven&apos;t heard any reports of anyone being arrested (and the NYPD had no information about any arrests as well). Not that it made it any safer out there: one person tweeted about skaters <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161023032939/https://twitter.com/Laaara_notLaura/status/259701140487299072">almost getting run over by a bus</a> in Times Square, while <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161023032939/https://twitter.com/fattsmann/status/259704751371997185">Kenneth Ng tweeted</a>: &quot;Saw people wipe out and get bloodied @ #broadwaybomb. If it were a sanctioned event, EMTs and marshals would be there to help. But it&apos;s not.&quot;</p>
