Police decided to check out the apartment in the Justice Sonia Sotomayor Houses in Soundview after they smelled a strange odor while responding to a different incident there. And what awaited them inside was like a scene out of <em>Dexter</em>: blood covered the kitchen floor, cleaning products all around the room and a bloody hatchet lying nearby.<p></p>

<p>The duffel bag was found drenched in blood in the kitchen closet. &quot;It&apos;s soaked. It&apos;s a river of blood coming from the bag, at least 8 pints,&quot; said a police source. Police believe the body may have been decomposing for days before they discovered it. The identity of the victim hasn&apos;t been released yet, but neighbors told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412185247/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2011/03/20/2011-03-20_a_river_of_blood_rotting_mutilated_body_of_400lb_man_found_in_bag_in_apt.html">the News</a> they were shocked by the crime: &quot;He was a nice person to everybody. He was really nice to my kids. He used to give them candy or toys,&quot; said Yaniris Laureano, 21. &quot;He&apos;d give me lectures about life lessons. He was a cool guy,&quot; said Anthony Terc, 17. Even after he was taken out, the smell lingered: &quot;It was a bad smell and it&apos;s still there. It smells like a dead rat. It&apos;s bad,&quot; said Laureano. </p>
