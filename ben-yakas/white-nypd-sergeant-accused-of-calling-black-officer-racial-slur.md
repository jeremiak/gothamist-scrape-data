<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="101211cop.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20111018081639im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/101211cop.jpg" width="240" height="360" class="image-left"> </span>According <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111018081639/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2011/10/12/2011-10-12_nypd_probing_officers_charge_that_white_sergeant_in_bklyn_called_him_boy_cop_boo.html">to the Daily News</a>, a white NYPD sergeant in Brooklyn is being investigated for allegedly using a racial slur against a black officer. Sgt. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111018081639/http://www.linkedin.com/pub/sean-patrick-mclaine/b/60/675">Sean McLaine</a>, of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111018081639/http://gothamist.com/2010/12/12/more_police_officers_getting_sick_o.php">ever-troubled</a> 79th Precinct in Bedford-Stuyvesant, has been accused of calling Officer Roberto Stokes &quot;boy&quot; several times. Stokes&apos;s lawyer, Norman Siegel, said the incident was indicative of a culture of racism within the NYPD: &quot;<strong>In the year 2011, somebody calling an African-American officer a boy is simply unacceptable.</strong> This incident is part of a larger problem of race with that precinct.&quot;</p>

<p>Stokes, who filed a complaint against McLaine two weeks ago, said McLaine was trying to get him to take prisoners to Central Booking when McLaine &quot;told Stokes, <strong>&apos;Be a good boy - okay, boy?&apos;</strong>&quot; Stokes responded, &quot;You can&apos;t talk to me that way.&quot; McLaine&apos;s lawyer Andrew Quinn argued that race had nothing to do with the incident&#x2014;McLaine had been admonishing Stokes for using his name in a police report he had nothing to do with: &quot;Why do you have to treat me like a child?&quot; Stokes asked during the argument, according to Quinn. &quot;The sergeant then said, &apos;Well then be a good little boy and do your prisoner transport.&apos;&quot;</p>

<p>Since then, McLaine has been bounced to the NYPD&apos;s Viper unit, which monitors surveillance cameras at city housing projects. Opinions were decidedly harsh over at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111018081639/http://theerant.yuku.com/topic/45002#.TpW4uUAu7fQ">the message board for current and retired police officers, Thee Rant</a>, where several people admonished Stokes for treating &quot;every mono-syllable word as an &apos;offense&apos; against someone.&quot; OntheDL wrote:</p>

<blockquote>I hope the rest of the job is watching this one. These rookie scumbags from the PJ&apos;s are looking to jam you up for anything. I hope all the new bosses get the message. Rock these scumbags on their evals, drop paper with little catch phrases like &quot;does not respond well to authority&quot;, &quot;does now work well with others&quot;, &quot;often requires additional supervision&quot;. I&apos;ve been called white boy, east cupcake, and a few others by other cops and bosses. Walk it off you little scumbag.</blockquote>
