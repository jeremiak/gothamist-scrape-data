<p>A 22-year-old was fatally struck by a vehicle in a hit-and-run in Manhattan early this morning. According to police, the incident happened just before 3 a.m.; the victim was found at the intersection of 12th Avenue and 23rd Street on the West Side Highway. Police found the man on the ground unconscious and unresponsive with severe body trauma; he was taken to Bellevue Hospital where he was pronounced dead.</p>

<p>Police have determined that the pedestrian was struck in the crosswalk by an unknown vehicle traveling southbound on 12th Avenue. The driver then fled the scene, leaving the victim in the middle of the road; it hasn&apos;t been determined yet whether the victim had the &quot;walk&quot; signal. There have been no arrests so far, and police say the investigation is ongoing. </p>
