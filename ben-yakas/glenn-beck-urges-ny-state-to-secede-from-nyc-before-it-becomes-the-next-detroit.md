<p>Glenn Beck has been warning us about Bill de Blasio&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151025184923/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/02/glenn_beck_de_blasio_makes_bloomber.php">&quot;Marxist communist with a history of supporting terrorism&quot; agenda</a> for weeks now, but we didn&apos;t listen. <em>We just wouldn&apos;t listen.</em> And now that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151025184923/http://gothamist.com/tags/billdeblasio">de Blasio has won</a> ushering in a thousand years of The Bad Old Days, Beck is doing everything he can to save what little of New York state he can: &quot;This is a city that has gone insane, and you are going to be held responsible for it,&#x201D; Beck <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151025184923/http://www.glennbeck.com/2013/11/06/was-glenn-able-to-get-through-nyc-mayor-elect-bill-de-blasio%E2%80%99s-victory-speech-without-walking-out-of-the-room/">declared this week</a>. &#x201C;If I were in New York State right now, I would be filing for a motion to secede from New York City.&quot;</p>

<p>Beck struggled to watch de Blasio&apos;s entire victory speech on air, punctuating various parts by waxing poetic over the last &quot;strongman&quot; mayor, Rudy Giuliani (&quot;Somebody who&apos;s gonna take care of them&quot;), trembling at the scourge of &quot;progressivism,&quot; and tsk-tsking de Blasio for thinking inequality is an important issue. Why couldn&apos;t we have just listened to Beck and avoided this hellscape reality which we now face? We have no excuses:</p>

<blockquote>And when it comes to de Blasio, the guy is a communist. That was out. Everybody knew. In New York, you have no excuse. This guy is going to make your life a living hell. For anybody who is working in New York and is too young to have lived through New York in the 1970s, do yourself a favor, go ahead and do some research on what it was like to live in New York before Rudy Guiliani&#x2026; You won&#x2019;t even be able to travel to that city soon. He will destroy it. New York will become the next Detroit, if they don&#x2019;t stop it at some point.</blockquote>

<p>You can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151025184923/http://www.glennbeck.com/2013/11/06/was-glenn-able-to-get-through-nyc-mayor-elect-bill-de-blasio%E2%80%99s-victory-speech-without-walking-out-of-the-room/">go here</a> to watch Beck&apos;s entire rant, or you could <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151025184923/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ke-_nKHpDs">watch Axl Rose ask for some reggae.</a> Spoiler alert: Axl is less of a waste of time.</p>
