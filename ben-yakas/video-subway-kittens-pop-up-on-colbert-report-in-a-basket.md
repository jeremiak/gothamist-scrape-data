                            <p>The NYC mayoral race was justly eclipsed last week by the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130909075330/http://gothamist.com/tags/subwaykittens">subway kittens</a> who briefly brought service <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130909075330/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/29/video_adorable_kittens_frolic_on_su.php">to a standstill</a> in Brooklyn by frolicking on the train tracks. Last night, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130909075330/http://gothamist.com/tags/stephencolbert">Stephen Colbert</a> lamented the plight of the victims of those adorable kitties in a hilarious segment: &quot;Hundreds of Brooklynites were stuck on the platform with nothing to Instagram, thousands of baristas were late for their shifts&#x2014;worst of all, dozens of bands were instantly formed and named, &apos;The Subway Kittens.&apos;&quot; And then he brought the actual subway kittens August and Arthur&#x2014;along with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130909075330/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/05/subway_kittens_living_it_up_in_broo.php#photo-1">current foster dad Steven Liu</a>&#x2014;onto the show in a basket!</p>

<p>After running through each of the mayoral candidates responses to the kittens (and dropping a ridiculously perfect Sal Albanese impression), Colbert turned his attention to &quot;the only pro-dead kitten candidate in this race...or any race:&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130909075330/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/31/joe_lhota_would_have_let_subway_kit.php">Joe Lhota</a>! After praising his campaign strategy (&quot;He&apos;ll sweep up in the key anti-kitten demographics of sociopaths, rats large enough to vote, and Alf&quot;), he offered Lhota the much coveted Colbert Bump...as long as he kills the kittens with a monkey wrench or baseball bat.</p>
