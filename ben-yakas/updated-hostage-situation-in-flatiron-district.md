<p>We&apos;ve been receiving reports from tipsters and seeing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110727231439/http://twitter.com/#!/search/flatiron">chatter on Twitter</a> that there is a possible hostage situation, involving a gunman, happening right now on 22nd Street near the Flatiron building. According to tipsters in the area, cops have blocked off a four-block area on Broadway, north of 21st and south of 23rd, south of Madison Square Park. One person told us that &quot;everyone is looking out the window at 21st and Broadway...and there are people with binoculars on the roofs.&quot; We&apos;ll update as we learn more about the situation; you can send us info at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110727231439/mailto:tips@gothamist.com">tips@gothamist.com</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110727231439/http://twitter.com/#!/kristrange/status/96290142393864192">several</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110727231439/http://twitter.com/#!/olivergibson/status/96293561514987520">Twitterers</a> on the scene, there is a man with a gun holding his wife hostage. In addition, cops <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110727231439/http://twitter.com/#!/Shimon/status/96297978066767872">are advising</a> people in the Flatiron building to stay away from the windows. </p>

<p><strong>Update [3:26]</strong>: other Twitterists are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110727231439/http://twitter.com/#!/benjamenwalker/status/96298914336092160">reporting that</a> there may have been shots fired already, although <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110727231439/http://twitter.com/#!/heidiwmetcalfe/status/96299783735607297">another advises</a>: &quot;ok, ok, let&apos;s all keep calm. gunman in flatiron area appears to have locked himself into an apartment.&quot; The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110727231439/http://www.observer.com/2011/07/breaking-hostage-situation-at-flatiron-tea-shop/">NY Observer is reporting</a> that the incident appears to be taking place at the Argo Tea shop in the retail space at the bottom of 949 Broadway, between 22nd and 23rd Street.</p>

<p><strong>Update [3:38]</strong>: a worker inside the Flatiron building notes that the hostage situation is happening at the building <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110727231439/http://twitter.com/#!/thedaysbetween/status/96302496946978816">next to the Flatiron</a>: &quot;Please note, no has barricaded themselves inside the flatiron. We are all safe. It is in a nearby building.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110727231439/http://twitter.com/#!/MacmillanLib/status/96302854175858688">Others are</a> confirming that it isn&apos;t at the Argo Tea Shop as was previously said, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110727231439/http://twitter.com/#!/WNYC/status/96300857984950272">WNYC reports</a>: <strong>&quot;NYPD confirm someone has barricaded themselves in an apt near (not at) the #Flatiron building, and officers have responded.&quot;</strong></p>

<p><strong>Update [3:44]</strong>: a reader sent in the three photos above, and wrote: &quot;These were taken at 2pm today outside the Polaris nail salon on 22nd east of Broadway.  The police entered the building next door.&quot; To be clear: the hostage situation is <em>not</em> taking place at the Flatiron building. According to a source there, &quot;the police said there have been no shots fired and it&apos;s taking place <strong>at 14 E.22nd street.&quot;</strong></p>

<p><strong>Update [3:50]</strong>: conflicting reports coming in. One reader says he talked to a cop on the scene, who told him: &quot;The guy shot his landlord, people saw through the window, now he&apos;s barricaded himself in his apartment. Apparently the NYPDs got snipers on the scene.&quot;</p>

<p>Another Twitterer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110727231439/http://twitter.com/#!/nbahadur/status/96305389812981760">is writing that</a> police &quot;took down police tape on broadway between 22 and 23 outside the flatiron&quot;, and that ambulances are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110727231439/http://twitter.com/#!/nbahadur/status/96306084750434305">making their way</a> to the scene.</p>
