<p>Three people were injured when an allegedly drunk driver <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110927131145/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2011/09/24/2011-09-24_drunk_driver_plows_into_cab_witnesses_say_there_was_a_screech_then_pow.html">ran a red light and smashed into</a> a taxi in Harlem early this morning. The accident occurred around 4:30 a.m. this morning on 125th Street and Frederick Douglass Boulevard; police say that a 26-year-old woman sped through a red light right into a taxi. &quot;I was waiting at the red light. I heard the noise of it braking, the screech of tires and then it hit the yellow cab. [She] hit him so hard the yellow cab came and hit my car,&quot; said livery driver Kallo Mamadou, who was waiting in the opposite direction from the speeding car.</p>

<p>The driver and a male passenger <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110927131145/http://www.dnainfo.com/20110924/harlem/crash-involving-cab-leaves-two-hospitalized">were both taken</a> to the hospital, as well as the 43-year-old cab driver. Police said they expected to charge the woman with a driving while intoxicated charge; her male passenger was issued a summons for possession of marijuana.</p>
