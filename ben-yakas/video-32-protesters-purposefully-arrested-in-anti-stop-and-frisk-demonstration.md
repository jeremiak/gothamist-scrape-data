<p>Thirty-two demonstrators, including Princeton professor Cornel West, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111031061742/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/21/cornel_west_and_other_occupy_wall_s.php">were purposefully arrested yesterday</a> in Harlem at an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111031061742/http://gothamist.com/tags/occupywallstreet">Occupy Wall Street</a>-related protest against the NYPD&apos;s controversial <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111031061742/http://gothamist.com/tags/stopandfrisk">stop-and-frisk</a> policy. Hundreds of protesters gathered outside the 28th Precinct at West 123rd Street and Frederick Douglass Boulevard and linked arms blocking the entrance. <strong>&quot;You have to fight arbitrary police power,&quot;</strong> said West, who was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111031061742/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/16/cornel_west_hundreds_of_others_arre.php">also arrested this week</a> at a protest in D.C.

<p>During the afternoon, West declared that protesters were prepared to go to jail over what they deemed a civil disobedience protest: &quot;We need to bear witness to injustice. If cops need to take us to jail, take us to jail,&quot; West said. Also arrested with West were several community and religious leaders; Carl Dix, a national spokesman for the Revolutionary Communist Party; and James Vrettos, a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice. Most of those arrested <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111031061742/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2011/10/21/2011-10-21_nypds_stop_and_frisk_tactics_protested_in_harlem_princeton_prof_cornel_west_amon.html">were released from</a> the 33rd Precinct later that day to cheers from the crowd assembled there.</p>

<p>Dix explained why he was taking part in the non-violent civil disobedience protest, and recounted the story of his first encounter with the police in an editorial <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111031061742/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/carl-dix/new-york-stop-and-frisk_b_1024234.html">for the Huffington Post</a> yesterday: &quot;This policy is wrong. It is illegal, racist, unconstitutional and intolerable! It is just one of the many pipelines into the wholesale mass incarceration of a generation of Black and Latino youth...Just like the Jim Crow of my youth, this &quot;New Jim Crow&quot; of mass incarceration and criminalization is totally unjust, immoral, and illegitimate.&quot;</p>

<p>The NYPD stopped-and-frisked <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111031061742/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/23/nypd_stop_and_frisks_reach_record_h.php">a record 601,055 people</a> last year (the vast majority of whom were Black or Latino), and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111031061742/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/01/cop_stop_and_frisk_racial-profiling.php">are on pace</a> to exceed that number this year. The march came a day after several elected officials <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111031061742/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/20/city_officials_call_for_fed_probe_i.php">called for a federal probe</a> into the policy, and the same week that an eight year NYPD veteran <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111031061742/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/17/staten_island_cop_arrested_allegedl_1.php">was arrested and charged</a> with civil rights violations in connection with a racially-charged stop-and-frisk arrest on Staten Island.</p>

<p>On his weekly radio program yesterday, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111031061742/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/21/protesters-of-police-stop-and-frisk-practice-are-arrested/?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">Mayor Bloomberg vigorously defended</a> the policy&#x2014;he reasoned that we&apos;d be left with &#x201C;a society you can&#x2019;t live in,&#x201D; without it. </p>

<blockquote>It&#x2019;s used in communities where we have lots of guns and lots of murder victims. And we&#x2019;ve brought crime down 35 percent in the last 10 years. We have&#x2014;I don&#x2019;t know&#x2014;I don&#x2019;t think we&#x2019;re going to set a record for low murders, but we&#x2019;ll have the second best year in the history of the city this year, and there&#x2019;s a reason for those things, and this is one of the tactics.

<p>People say, &#x2018;Oh, you can do it without that&#x2019;; well, you know...some people don&#x2019;t want you to do anything.</p></blockquote><p></p>
