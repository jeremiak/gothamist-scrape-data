										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="91611nypd.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505122957im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/91611nypd.jpg" width="250" height="271" class="image-left"> </span>This week, a veteran NYPD officer distraught over being called to testify in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505122957/http://gothamist.com/tags/ticketfixingscheme">ticket-fixing scandal</a> which has engulfed the police force <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505122957/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/14/cop_in_ticket-fixing_probe_tries_to.php">attempted (but failed) to commit suicide</a>. Officer Robert McGee, who is currently at North Central Bronx Hospital because of burns from clutching the third rail, is telling friends that he&apos;s &quot;ashamed of this whole thing.&quot; One source close to McGee <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505122957/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2011/09/16/2011-09-16_tremendous_love_for_suicidal_cop.html">told the News</a>, &quot;He said it was a spur-of-the-moment decision. He&apos;s 62, with 30 years [on the job] and an unblemished record, and to go out like this is not the way to retire. You want to retire the way you came in, with pride.&quot;</p>

<p>Despite facing no criminal charges himself, McGee, a union delegate assigned to the 43rd Precinct, was distraught over having to testify against fellow officers who fixed tickets for family, friends or profit. A Bronx police source said that other cops have become despondent and depressed as the probe has dragged on for months and charged have built up: &quot;The mental health of some of these guys has become an issue [for prosecutors].&quot; Another source said that the overriding emotion was slightly more aggressive: &quot;most guys are pissed...They&apos;re like, &apos;Indict me already and let the truth come out.&apos;&quot;</p>

<p>As of now, it&apos;s unclear whether prosecutors will still call McGee to testify on the stand if/when there&apos;s a trial: &quot;It&apos;s tricky. <strong>They don&apos;t want to lose their witness, so they&apos;re going to have to handle this with kid gloves.&quot;</strong></p>
