<p>It seems as though <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110820084029/http://gothamist.com/tags/donaldtrump">Donald &quot;Enormous Balls&quot; Trump</a> misses the days when he was fake running for president and fake caring about birth certificates; since then, the living hairpiece has begun reasserting himself into political conversations, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110820084029/http://www.newsmax.com/InsideCover/Trump-Obama-Bus-Perry/2011/08/18/id/407751">criticizing Obama</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110820084029/http://blogs.abcnews.com/george/2011/08/donald-trump-handicaps-the-2012-republican-field.html">handicapping the Republican candidates</a>, and even fake flirting <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110820084029/http://blogs.abcnews.com/george/2011/08/donald-trump-still-flirting-with-a-3rd-party-run.html">with a 3rd party run</a>. But who cares about all that when we can take a peek at the &quot;yards and yards of gold silk&quot; inside his private 747 Trumplane!</p>

<p>Trump <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110820084029/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZq3iCn2y74&amp;feature=player_embedded">posted a video tour</a> of the incredibly classy and not-at-all over the top plane on his YouTube channel today. In the video, Amanda Miller (the secretary from <em>The Apprentice</em>) woodenly takes us on a tour of the Rolls Royce-powered plane to the soundtrack of some cheesy <em>Cribz</em>-esque music. The seats are embroidered with the Trump family crest! The seat belts (along with everything else) is 24-karat gold plated! There are thousands of Trump-approved movies available! The guest bedroom has mohair! </p>

<p>And best of all, the master bedroom is covered in those &quot;yards and yards of gold silk.&quot; What else would be appropriate for the man who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110820084029/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/02/video_berserk_jon_stewart_shreds_tr.php">eats his pizza with a fork and knife</a>?
