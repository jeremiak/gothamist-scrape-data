<p>In case you&apos;ve set your RSS feed only to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428182354/http://gothamist.com/2010/11/27/omg_justing_bieber_graces_manhattan.php">Justin Bieber</a>-related information for the past couple months, people have been none too chipper about the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428182354/http://gothamist.com/tags/fullbodyscanners">TSA full-body scanners</a> and full-body pat downs which have taken over our airports this holiday season. But one woman didn&apos;t find getting digitally naked to be satisfyingly invasive enough; she took it a step further, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428182354/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/weird/Woman-Strips-On-JFK-Bound-Flight-110935659.html">stripped naked</a> mid-flight on a plane from Chicago to JFK last night. And worst of all, she broke the first rule of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428182354/http://gothamist.com/2010/11/12/reporter_allegedly_witnesses_prison.php">doing-something-crazy</a> club, and did it in front of a reporter!</p>

<p>A Newsday news manager was on Delta Flight 6562 Saturday night when the unidentified 30-something-year-old woman in coach began to strip twenty minutes before the plane began its descent. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428182354/http://www.newsday.com/news/new-york/female-passenger-strips-naked-on-flight-to-jfk-1.2499706?p=">According to</a> David Holland, the Newsday manager, the woman began crying, yelling and saying &quot;No! No! No!&quot; when flight attendants tried to cover her with blankets. &quot;She didn&apos;t seem like she was coherent...Everybody was leaning in, trying to get a view of what all the commotion was,&quot; he said. The woman was brought to Jamaica Hospital Medical Center, was deemed an emotionally disturbed person. </p>

<p>This wasn&apos;t the worst example of mid-flight nudery recently: just before Thanksgiving, a man burst out of the airplane toilet on a flight in Russia <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428182354/http://www.metro.co.uk/weird/847938-plane-makes-emergency-landing-after-passenger-bursts-out-of-toilet-naked">completely naked</a>, and proceeded to frolic around plane until an emergency landing was required. The picture on the website accompanying the story could lead anyone to become emotionally disturbed.</p>
