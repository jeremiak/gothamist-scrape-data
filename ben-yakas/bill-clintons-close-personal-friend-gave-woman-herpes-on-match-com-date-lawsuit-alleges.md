<p>We know not everyone who uses online dating services keeps <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160209200210/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/17/ladies_men_make_spreadsheets_of_the.php">dating spreadsheets</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160209200210/http://gothamist.com/2006/08/05/valentine_sues.php">scams people</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160209200210/http://www.xojane.com/it-happened-to-me/i-cruised-okcupid-and-craiglist-for-dates-so-i-could-eat">for dinner</a> and (allegedly) spreads herpes, but there are certainly a lot of sick fish in the sea. According <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160209200210/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/social_disease_network_vmyJGVU8EjBefLAUYe84yH?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Local">to a new lawsuit</a>, the former CEO of Calvin Klein jeans gave herpes to a woman he met on Match.com in between bragging about being a &quot;close personal friend&quot; of Bill Clinton.</p>

<p>In the lawsuit, the aforementioned woman claims that she connected with Arnold Simon on Feb. 4th for a date; he had described himself &quot;as looking like Humphrey Bogart.&#x201D; During the drinks-and-dinner date, she says Simon kept talking about his friendship with Clinton, noting he had just eaten lunch with him at Candle 79 on the Upper East Side. Records do show that Arnold contributed at least $1 million to Clinton&#x2019;s foundation.</p>

<p>Arnold sent her a dozen long-stemmed roses the next day, and she agreed to go on another date with him on Feb. 10th. &#x201C;He picked me up in an Audi A9,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;He had a driver. He said, &#x2018;I&#x2019;ll bring my Bentley the next time.&#x2019; He takes me to Scalinatella. Everyone knew him there. They put us at a nice table.&#x201D; By the end of the night, the two were back at Simon&apos;s apartment; she says she asked him whether or not he had any STDs, but he insisted he was clean, and claimed he had undergone regular tests.</p>

<p>&#x201C;We had sex unprotected,&#x201D; the woman said in the suit, claiming that she was disease-free at the time of the encounter. Two weeks later, she had herpes, and now she wants monetary compensation from Simon. But for what it&apos;s worth, she does know that it was probably a bad idea to have unprotected sex in the first place with a stranger: &#x201C;I absolutely should have used a condom. I let my guard down.&#x201D; Even more importantly: why did everyone have to drag Bill Clinton into this? Does this mean women are not to trust men who brag about being buds with our 42nd president? Did Bill Clinton <em>know</em> his friend had herpes? Did Simon pay off Bill Clinton not to tell people? How deep does this conspiracy run?? </p>
