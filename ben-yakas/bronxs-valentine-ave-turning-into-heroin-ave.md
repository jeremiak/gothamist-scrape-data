You might want to stay away from Valentine Avenue in the Bronx. The Bedford Park road has become central to the burgeoning heroin trade; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429062053/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/bronx/2010/09/19/2010-09-19_valentine_at_heart_of_smack.html">according to the News</a>, there have been relentless stabbings, gunfire, street robberies and gang activity over the summer there. One veteran narcotics investigator said the neighborhood was as bad as Washington Heights in the &apos;80s: &quot;It&apos;s been that way for quite some time. <strong>There&apos;s a saturation effect. After a while, people on the block will ignore it rather than jeopardize their safety by complaining</strong>.&quot; <p></p>

<p>In July, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429062053/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/28/bronx_heroin_bust_results_in_31_arr.php">police busted</a> the notorious La Perla Organization, who ran a $40,000 a day heroin enterprise on Valentine between E. 194th to E. 196th. It&apos;s gotten so bad that when the nations Drug Czar Gil Kerlikowske visited, he had six bodyguards accompany him on a tour of the area. </p>
