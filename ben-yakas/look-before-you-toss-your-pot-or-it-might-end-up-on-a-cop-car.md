So he decided to throw it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623143310/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2011/06/22/national/main20073297.shtml#ixzz1Q1zX06Sd">out the window</a>... and it landed right on the cop&apos;s vehicle. Was it bad luck? Or could the man have been the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623143310/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/01/mysterious_packages_of_pot_being_de.php">mysterious Marijuana fairy</a> we&apos;ve heard so much about?</p>

<p>Cops say they spotted Sean Schmidt, 20, standing with his upper body sticking out the sunroof of his car traveling on Interstate 190 in Buffalo late Monday night.

And as for the troopers, we must add, as ever: at least Schmidt didn&apos;t ask them to wait while <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623143310/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/10/man_asks_police_to_wait_while_he_fi.php">he finished smoking his crack.</a></p>
