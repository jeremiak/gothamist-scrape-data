The final night of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160131210435/http://gothamist.com/2012/09/20/videos_bruce_springsteen_caps_nearl.php#photo-1">his three shows</a> there was delayed by a storm, but Springsteen made up for it by staying onstage <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160131210435/http://brucespringsteen.net/news/2012/notes-from-the-road-night-3-in-east-rutherford-nj">until 2 a.m.</a>, the show climaxing with his mother Adele and other family members bringing cake onstage. </p>

<p>Altogether, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160131210435/http://backstreets.com/setlists.html">he played 33 songs</a> over the 3 1/2 hour show&#x2014;among the highlights were tour premieres of &quot;Cynthia,&quot; &quot;In the Midnight Hour,&quot; and &quot;Into The Fire,&quot; which was dedicated to NYC firefighter Rich Nappi and his wife Mary Ann. Nappi <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160131210435/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/22/thousands_gather_at_fdny_line_of_du.php">was killed while battling a fire</a> in Bushwick, Brooklyn in April.</p>

<p>There was also a cover of CCR&apos;s &quot;Who&apos;ll Stop The Rain;&quot; outings for <em>Born In The USA</em> deep cuts &quot;Cover Me&quot; and &quot;Downtown Train;&quot; rarities &quot;Janey Don&apos;t You Lose Heart&quot; and &quot;Pay Me My Money Down;&quot; the one-two <em>Born To Run</em> punch of &quot;Meeting Across The River&quot; and &quot;Jungleland;&quot; and the goofy charm of &quot;Glory Days.&quot; You can see Springsteen and Little Stevie hamming it up in a particularly close video below.</p>

<p>Then before the final song, Adele Springsteen came out with a giant cake in the shape of a guitar. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160131210435/http://www.nj.com/springsteen/index.ssf/2012/09/bruce_springsteens_birthday_pa.html">The Star-Ledger describes</a> what happened:</p>

<blockquote>Prior to the song, Bruce&apos;s mom Adele, his oldest sister Ginny, Patti Scialfa&apos;s mother and brother, plus Maureen Van Zandt came out with a huge birthday cake. This time Steven led the fans in singing &quot;Happy Birthday.&quot; Bruce blew out the candles and then started cutting up the cake. The first piece went to his &quot;first fan&quot; Obie who was in the front row. Both Bruce and Steven introduced Obie. &quot;She was following me when she was 16,&quot; Bruce said.

<p>Several other fans in the front of the pit got pieces of cake personally delivered by Bruce. He would have brought out even more, except he ran out of plates.</p>

<p>Bruce wanted to make sure his Mom had earplugs before playing the song. &quot;I don&apos;t want to make my mother go deaf on my birthday!&quot; Everyone stayed on stage to sing the finale. Ending a big party!</p></blockquote><p></p>
