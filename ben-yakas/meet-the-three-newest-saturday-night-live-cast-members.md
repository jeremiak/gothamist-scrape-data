Which means we are getting three new feature players this season: Mikey Day, Alex Moffat and Melissa Villase&#xF1;or, who will all make their debuts during the October 1st season premiere.</p>

<p>Day has been a staff writer at SNL since 2013, and was also a head writer and a featured player in this summer&apos;s now-cancelled <em>Maya &amp; Marty</em> variety/sketch show. Day previously was a cast member of MTV&apos;s improv comedy series Wild &apos;N Out (along with Killam and fellow SNL-er Pete Davidson); he also played Evan Ferguson in the classic YouTube comedy series, &quot;David Blaine Street Magic: YouTube Edition.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161113152558/http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/tv/ct-saturday-night-live-adds-alex-moffat-of-chicago-20160912-column.html">Moffat is</a> a Chicago improv and sketch performer, a Second City alum who co-starred in the 2015 indie <em>Uncle John.</em> Villase&#xF1;or is an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161113152558/https://www.facebook.com/Melissacomedy/">LA-based comedian</a> who does a lot of impressions <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161113152558/https://www.youtube.com/user/melissav87/videos?view=0&amp;flow=grid&amp;sort=p">on YouTube.</a></p>

<p>There is also a rumor, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161113152558/http://decider.com/2016/09/09/snl-new-castmembers-mikey-day-chris-redd/">first reported by Decider</a>, that SNL will bring Chicago sketch comic Chris Redd as cast member, but that hasn&apos;t been confirmed by SNL. Redd appeared in the Andy Samburg/Lonely Island film <em>Popstar</em> as Hungry the Hunter this summer.</p>

<p>After a lot of controversy <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161113152558/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/03/videos_saturday_night_live_3.php#photo-1">in 2013</a> about a predominantly white cast, SNL skewered itself for its own lack of diversity, &quot;but it was weird: SNL got to address the elephant in the room, and sort of apologize about it, while at the same time confirming that nothing was really going to change anytime soon.&quot;</p>

<p>We still don&apos;t know who is hosting the premiere of the 42nd season, which is just two and a half weeks away, but in the meantime, you can go ahead and catchup with last season&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161113152558/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/02/the_best_live_sketches_of_saturday.php">best live sketches</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161113152558/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/01/best_snl_season_41.php">best pre-taped segments</a>, and every <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161113152558/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/29/snl_best_cut-for-time_sketch.php">cut-for-time sketch.</a> </p>
