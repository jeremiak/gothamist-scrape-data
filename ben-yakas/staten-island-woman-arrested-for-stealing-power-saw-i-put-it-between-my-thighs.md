<p>Traditionally, very little power saw <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130511002141/http://gothamist.com/2006/07/06/man_attacks_sub.php">news is</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130511002141/http://gothamist.com/2006/07/07/postal.php">good news.</a> But we&apos;re relieved that Barbara Curbelo wasn&apos;t injured during her arrest as she attempted to steal one of them in Staten Island. However, we do have some questions for her about how she managed to carry it out of the store: &quot;I put it between my thighs. I sell it to buy food,&quot; she allegedly told cops, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130511002141/http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2013/03/staten_island_woman_charged_wi_3.html#incart_most-comments">according to SILive.</a></p>

<p>According to cops, Curbelo removed a DeWalt power saw from a dispaly shelf inside the Lowe&apos;s store in Mariners Harbor. She then placed the saw, which is valued at $145, under her skirt and left without paying. The 55-year-old woman, who lives in New Brighton, was quickly arrested; it turns out she has 14 prior arrests dating to 1999, mostly for stolen property, petit larceny and drug possession.</p>

<p>She has been charged with misdemeanor counts of attempted petit larceny and attempted criminal possession of stolen property in the fifth-degree. Look for Curbelo&apos;s column, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130511002141/http://nymag.com/thecut/2013/03/women-losing-objects-in-their-vaginas-a-review.html">&quot;I Had A Power Saw Stuck Between My Legs,&quot;</a> next week on XOJane. <br>
