<p>Because we spend so much time focused on his brilliant movies and essays rather than his personal life, it&apos;s sometimes easy for us to momentarily forget that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507080035/http://gothamist.com/tags/woodyallen">Woody Allen</a> is <em>kinda-sorta-probably</em> super creepy, what with the whole marrying-your-adopted-daughter-and-ripping-apart-your-family thing. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507080035/http://www.vanityfair.com/online/daily/2013/10/mia-farrow-children-family-scandal">A new Vanity Fair piece</a> on Mia Farrow and her many children is a reminder that regardless of whether you agree with the morality of what he did, Allen left a permanent scar on his former family. But there&apos;s a new wrinkle in the story: Farrow admits that she&apos;s not sure whether her son Ronan Farrow is Allen&apos;s son, or Frank Sinatra&apos;s. And Ronan is taking the revelation in stride.</p>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>Listen, we&apos;re all *possibly* Frank Sinatra&apos;s son.</p>&#x2014; Ronan Farrow (@RonanFarrow) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507080035/https://twitter.com/RonanFarrow/statuses/385412266625351681">October 2, 2013</a></blockquote>

<p>When asked pointblank about Ronan&apos;s parentage, Farrow tells them he is &quot;possibly&quot; Sinatra&apos;s. Farrow of course was married to Sinatra from 1966 to 1968, but she continued to be his lover on and off afterward, even reportedly during her time with Allen. Ronan has long been described as the only biological child of Farrow and Allen, who were together from 1980-1992. The family has never done a DNA test to prove who the father is, and this is the first time Farrow has publicly admitted the possibility it&apos;s not Allen.</p>

<p>When Nancy Sinatra Jr. was asked about Ronan&#x2019;s being treated as a member of her family, Sinatra told Vanity Fair, &#x201C;He is a big part of us, and we are blessed to have him in our lives.&#x201D; As you can see in the photo above, this could explain a few things about Ronan&apos;s looks&#x2014;at the same time, Sinatra would have been around 78 when Ronan was conceived. </p>

<p>Either way, we&apos;re sure Ronan is pretty, pretty pleased with the idea. </p>
