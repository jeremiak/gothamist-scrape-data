<p>We only have a few more days left of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504194848/http://gothamist.com/tags/truedetective">smelling the psychosphere</a> before we learn that the Yellow King was just <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504194848/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvA4Tbjk8tk">a desert hallucination</a> or whatever. But thankfully, <em>Game of Thrones</em> will be back just in time to fill the Carcosa-sized hole in our hearts! And it&apos;s coming even sooner than you realized: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504194848/http://www.barclayscenter.com/events/detail/game-of-thrones-epic-fan-experience">HBO will host a viewing</a> of the first episode of the new season for 7,000 lucky fans in just two weeks.</p>

<p>HBO will host &#x201C;The Epic Fan Experience&#x201D; on Thursday March 20th at the Cushman &amp; Wakefield Theater at Barclays Center. In addition to the advanced screening of the episode, there will also be costumes and props displays <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504194848/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/28/sit_on_the_iron_throne_at_game_of_t.php">from the traveling exhibition</a>, photo ops on the Iron Throne and other special surprises. Keep in mind, those special surprises will likely not include <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504194848/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/28/game_of_thrones.php#photo-1">whirlwind romances with Margaery Tyrell</a>, but one can always hope for the best!</p>

<p>The tickets cost $15 and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504194848/http://www.ticketmaster.com/event/00004C5BF19F7D2D?brand=barclays&amp;camefrom=CFC_BARCLAYS_CTR_GOT">will be on sale tomorrow</a>. Also keep in mind: HBO is very serious about you not spoiling anything from the premiere&#x2014;to that end, all electronic devices will be checked prior to entering Barclays. So you should probably skip the event if you are prone to breaking out in sweats and jitters when you are torn apart from your iPhone. Especially if this is what you sound like unplugged from The Machine:</p>
