<p><em>Girls</em> are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231093545/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/11/last_nights_girls_forget_about_the.php">getting it on</a>, taxi drivers are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231093545/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/13/viral_video_alert_cab_drivers_sexy.php">composing slow jams for the ages</a>, and everything&apos;s coming up Justin Timberlake&#x2014;throw in the spring weather that is starting to creep in, and things are really taking a turn for the sexy. Sexy search site <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231093545/http://www.pornmd.com/sex-search">PornMD has compiled a list</a> of the most-searched terms for the last six months around the world, which means you can finally find out what kinds of porn your fellow New Yorkers prefer without needing to take a terrifying peek into their browser history.</p>

<p>The NY list is pretty basic&#x2014;you have your &quot;college,&quot; your &quot;amateur,&quot; your &quot;MILF&quot; and &quot;teen.&quot; We&apos;re a little surprised that &quot;straight (gay)&quot; made it and not &quot;lesbian,&quot; but we have to admit to being completely ignorant about who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231093545/http://www.thelisaann.com/">Lisa Ann</a> was up until about 20 minutes ago or so. Does she have a NY chapter to her fanbase or something? She <em>did</em> play Serra Paylin in the cinematic classic <em>Who&apos;s Nailin&apos; Paylin?</em> And <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231093545/https://twitter.com/thereallisaann/status/311683173522235393">she does appreciate <em>Seinfeld</em></a>...albeit the finale.</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141231093545/http://www.pornmd.com/sex-search">click through their survey</a> to check out other states (Floridians love &quot;creampie,&quot; Californians love &quot;asian&quot;), the US on the whole (&quot;milf&quot; is #1, &quot;anal&quot; is #10), and other countries around the world. Now, we don&apos;t want to <em>judge</em> anyone, but there are some seriously disturbing (and plain weird) search trends in certain places: people in South Korea search for &quot;shitting&quot; and &quot;mother,&quot; people in India search for &quot;rape,&quot; people in Nigeria search for &quot;things I jack off to&quot;...and then there&apos;s Iceland.  </p>
