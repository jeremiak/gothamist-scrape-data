I think I&apos;ve seen everything I came for today.&quot;</a></i></div> <p></p>

<p>In case you haven&apos;t made your way to Prospect Park today to take part in the NY Times&apos; least favorite food and music festival, things have been pretty low-key at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130729105005/http://gothamist.com/tags/googamooga">GoogaMooga</a>. Reporter John Del Signore says that it&apos;s been drizzling a bit, which may be driving some people away, and photographer Scott Lynch added there were no lines to be seen. &quot;Seriously: vendors engaging in patter to try and get passersby to buy,&quot; he told us. &quot;Beer and wine, same thing. Even Umami Burger was pretty much walk-right-up and order.&quot; Thankfully, we came upon one of the mythical <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130729105005/http://gothamist.com/tags/googleglass">cyborgunicorns</a> in the wilds of the Lexus-sponsored woods. </p>

<p>Based on his attire, we suspect this futurism guinea pig may have run the Brooklyn Half Marathon in his head gear, which would have totally earned him a mega wedgie were this high school. But while we shine the spotlight on this Google snowflake, we also know deep in our hearts that we&apos;re staring into the enhanced eyes of the inevitable. Next year at GoogaMooga, you won&apos;t be able to throw a stone without hitting someone wearing Google Glass. </p>
