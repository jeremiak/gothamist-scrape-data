<p>It&apos;s not every day that one sees <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160228154652/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/20/williamsburg_brand_camels_have_arri.php">non-filtered camels</a> ambling around Brooklyn&#x2014;but if you poked your head out from under the covers this afternoon, you would have seen just that. Camels (along with goats and at least one unhappy donkey) roamed the streets of Greenpoint and Williamsburg today for the Three Kings Parade, hosted by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160228154652/http://www.elmuseo.org/3k2014/">El Museo del Barrio.</a></p>

Below, check out some tweets and photos from people shocked to discover Sunday can also be hump day.</p>
