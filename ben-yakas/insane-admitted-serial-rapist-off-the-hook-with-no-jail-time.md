<p>A former Manhattan court juvenile counselor who pleaded guilty to raping a 15-year-old and sexually assaulting a 15-year-old and a 16-year-old will be formally sentenced to 10 years&apos; probation and no prison time next week. And this has a lot of people understandably furious, especially with the female judge who gave the rapist the softest possible punishment allowed. More than a hundred protesters <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110707173514/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/11/10/2010-11-10_furor_over_sex_raps_probation.html">demonstrated outside</a> Manhattan Criminal Court yesterday, chanting &quot;<strong>We&apos;re here to say, serial rape is not okay!</strong>&quot; DA Cy Vance Jr. agreed with them in a statement regarding the Judge&apos;s decision: &quot;This was an egregious breach of the public&apos;s trust.&quot;</p>

<p>Tony Simmons, 42, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110707173514/http://www.dnainfo.com/20100928/downtown/da-cy-vance-blasts-outrageously-lenient-sentence-for-admitted-rapist">worked as a counselor</a> in the city&apos;s Department of Juvenile Justice between 2000 and 2008. He admitted to raping Ashley, a 15-year-old who was given 12 months in prison for filing a false police report. She <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110707173514/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/10/03/2010-10-03_raped_by_judge_and_justice_system.html">told the News</a> that he nonchalantly raped her in 2005 while she waited in the courthouse basement for her case to be called. &quot;I was very scared. I was terrified. He was a very large man...I knew I was just raped. I knew it wasn&apos;t supposed to happen. I didn&apos;t think anybody would believe me.&quot; </p>

<p>She was too scared to file a report on Simmons, who the kids referred to as Tyson (as inappropriate a nickname as they come?), and who looks like a scarred, villainous mobster from an old Batman comic book in his recent <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110707173514/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/11/10/2010-11-10_furor_over_sex_raps_probation.html">court room sketch</a>. Simmons wasn&apos;t caught until another 15-year-old girl <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110707173514/http://www.ny1.com/content/top_stories/89933/juvenile-justice-counselor-faces-sex-abuse-charges/">came forward</a> to say he had sodomized her behind a locker in the girls holding area, which he stocked with condoms and cookies. </p>

<p>Jane Manning, president of the National Organization for Women in New York, said the three girls who came forward were insulted by the legal system: &quot;<strong>I think the judge has fallen prey to the notion that these women matter less because these girls had been in trouble with the law</strong>.&quot; Worst of all, according to protesters, it was a female Judge who signed off on the no-jail sentence: &quot;These are powerful women. They are not sensitive to the rest of us who don&apos;t have the power. I can&apos;t believe it was a woman judge who made this decision,&quot; said Janice Barringer, 67. </p>
