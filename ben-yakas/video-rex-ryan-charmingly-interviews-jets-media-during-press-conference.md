<p>It&apos;s been a rather quiet offseason for Jets head coach <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428180610/http://gothamist.com/tags/rexryan">Rex Ryan</a>, give or take the occasional <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428180610/http://gothamist.com/2014/02/21/photo_of_course_rex_ryan_loves_hang.php">trip to Hooters</a>. Now with preseason <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428180610/http://sports-kings.com/nysportskings/rex-ryan-geno-smith-first-michael-vick/">under way</a>, the Jets media scrums have begun anew&#x2014;but Ryan <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428180610/http://www.nydailynews.com/blogs/jets/video-ny-jets-coach-rex-ryan-turns-tables-plays-reporter-press-conference-blog-entry-1.1897925">decided to change things up a bit</a> on a &quot;boring day&quot; by sitting in the media section and asking the Jets beat reporters questions. And it was, unsurprisingly, pretty charming. </p>

<p>Ryan justifies the topsy-turvy turnaround by noting, &quot;this is my time, six years here.&quot; He showed a real understanding and respect for the media, and an appreciation for the ups-and-downs of their day-to-day jobs. </p>

<p>Ryan asked ESPN reporter <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428180610/https://twitter.com/RichCimini">Rich Cimini</a> (the guy at the podium) how they get through boring training camp days like this: &quot;When we have a boring, flat day...we come into the press conference, hoping, counting on you giving us something to write about. Giving us a good quote or headline. But I think today is one of those days...we&apos;re really not helping the cause right now. I know everyone&apos;s thinking, we want Rex up there right now.&quot; He might have been wrong about that last bit though, considering how delighted the other reporters seemed.</p>

<p>Later, Ryan responded to a question about what kinds of things annoys him about the media: &quot;I think sometimes though when you sit in here, it&#x2019;s like guys: how many times are you going to ask me a question about a quarterback thing that clearly I don&#x2019;t want to answer,&quot; Ryan said. &quot;Let&#x2019;s ask it sideways, let&#x2019;s do it this way, and I know you guys try to pick on me and sometimes I&#x2019;ll slip up, make a mistake and then you guys pounce all over it.&quot;</p>

<p>He also admitted that he loathed being asked questions about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428180610/http://gothamist.com/tags/timtebow">Tim Tebow</a> back in 2012: &quot;I&#x2019;ll admit it, I absolutely did. You did because you&#x2019;re talking about a <em>backup</em> quarterback.&quot; For the record, he&apos;s not even <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428180610/http://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/2014/08/07/tim-tebow-embracing-new-broadcasting-job-while-waiting-on-another-chance-to/">a backup anymore</a>.</p>
