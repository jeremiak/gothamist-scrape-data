</div></div>					<p>Yesterday, we were tantalized by the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150726141332/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/14/have_you_fallen_for_a_hipster_trap.php">&quot;hipster trap,&quot;</a> baited with PBR, American Spirits, pink sunglasses and a yellow bike chain. We talked to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150726141332/http://twitter.com/willhimself">Will Simon</a> today, who took the above picture on Sunday, and he told us a little more background info on the cardboard traps.</p>

<p>Simon told us the two people responsible for the &quot;hipster traps&quot; are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150726141332/http://www.jeffgreenspan.com/">Jeff Greenspan</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150726141332/http://www.hunterfine.com/">Hunter Fine</a>, and adds &quot;looks like they&apos;ve done some similar outdoor work in NYC before.&quot; And we have taken notice of some of those other projects: Greenspan was the artist who came up with the idea for the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150726141332/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/19/tourists_now_have_their_own_sidewal.php">tourist sidewalk lane</a>, in conjunction <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150726141332/http://gothamist.com/2010/06/08/that_sidewalk_line_dividing_tourist.php#photo-1">with</a> Improv Everywhere.  Fine describes this work, &quot;<strong>Urban Traps is a project where we lay traps for certain subcultures. Our goal is protect neighborhoods from infestation and collect different species for further study.&quot;</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>And yesterday, Greenspan <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150726141332/http://twitter.com/GspanNYC/status/47369709959659520">tweeted</a>, &quot;Placing some hipster traps in Williamsburg now. If you know a place that needs one, or have suggestions for bait, let me know.&quot; He also gave a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150726141332/http://twitter.com/GspanNYC/status/47369863819304960">preview of</a> a spin-off project: <strong>&quot;Coming soon: Bridge and Tunnel Traps. Watch your step.&quot;</strong> If you see any of the &quot;hipster traps&quot; around town, email us with pics at tips@gothamist.com.</p>
