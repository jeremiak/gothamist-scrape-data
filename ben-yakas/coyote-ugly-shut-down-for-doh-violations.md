<p>Is there trouble in stanky paradise? Yesterday, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141028101838/http://evgrieve.com/2011/02/doh-closes-coyote-ugly.html">EV Grieve noticed</a> that <strike>hepatitis-hotspot</strike> tourist-beloved dive <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141028101838/http://www.coyoteuglysaloon.com/newyork/">Coyote Ugly</a> has been shut down because of DOH inspections. The East Village bar, which opened in January 1993 and spawned multiple locations around the world as well as a movie based on it, scored <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141028101838/http://a816-restaurantinspection.nyc.gov/RestaurantInspection/SearchDetails.do">40 points</a> during a DOH visit in December, for violations such as &quot;plumbing not properly installed or maintained,&quot; &quot;evidence of mice or live mice present,&quot; filth flies everywhere, and unwashed surfaces.</p>

<p>In the latest DOH visit in February, they had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141028101838/http://a816-restaurantinspection.nyc.gov/RestaurantInspection/SearchDetails.do">90 violation points</a>! We shudder to imagine what will happen to all those wide-eyed, bushy-tailed young women looking to make their dreams of dancing on bars come true:</p>
