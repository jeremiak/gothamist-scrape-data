With that in mind, we bring you <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406000201/http://gothamist.com/tags/stillgotit">Still Got It</a>, our tribute to establishments that continue to serve mouthwatering meals and drinks long after the buzz has faded&#x2014;or if the lingering hype is still justified.</em><p></p>

<p>There is certainly no shortage of pizza places in the five boroughs, from the greasy to the thin-crusted to deep-dish (if that&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406000201/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/04/justice_scalia_issues_decision_on_n.php">even really pizza</a>). Pizza is so important here, it&apos;s spawned it&apos;s own mini industry of connoisseurs, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406000201/http://slice.seriouseats.com/">several</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406000201/http://www.idreamofpizza.com/">websites</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406000201/http://www.sliceharvester.com/">dedicated</a> to rating the almighty slice. But whenever we find a place where everything in addition to the pizza is also exceptional, from the atmosphere to the service to the seating, we know we have a keeper. And Bed-Stuy&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406000201/http://www.saraghinabrooklyn.com/">Saraghina</a> is just such a place that makes us want to linger. </p>

<p>Saraghina is a model of minimalism and simplicity done right: their menu is only one page, buoyed by a rotating lineup of seasonal specials every night. They only accept cash, don&apos;t take reservations, and don&apos;t do delivery. But they&apos;re a restaurant that actively wants you to come, sit, and stay for awhile, and has the room for larger parties. When you walk into the front dining room, you&apos;re greeted by a wood-burning oven and several busy but friendly servers; when you walk to the back room, it has an even nicer, somewhat-romantic ambiance, with a decor that is a mix between farmhouse and European. The pizza is fresh, ungreasy and delicious, there are several vegetarian options, and the grilled octopus salad is highly recommended. And perhaps best of all, they have a garden sitting area. It&apos;s a gem worth braving a trip to Bed-Stuy for. </p>
