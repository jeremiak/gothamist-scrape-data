<p>Between Trump&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025143451/https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-used-258000-from-his-charity-to-settle-legal-problems/2016/09/20/adc88f9c-7d11-11e6-ac8e-cf8e0dd91dc7_story.html?tid=pm_politics_pop_b">misuse of charity funds</a>, Skittles having its good name dragged through <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025143451/http://gothamist.com/2016/09/20/thanks_for_ruining_skittles_donald.php">the political mud</a>, and Brangelina <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025143451/http://laist.com/2016/09/20/brangelina_bye.php">imploding</a>, we&apos;re all in desperate need of some not-terrible news today. And <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025143451/http://gothamist.com/tags/louisck">Louis C.K.</a> is here to provide it to his &quot;dear, dear friend[s]&quot; by announcing a bunch of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025143451/https://louisck.net/tour-dates">new tour dates</a> that will keep C.K. on the road through at least January, and possibly for all eternity.</p>

<p>Among the new dates, C.K. will be performing at NJPAC in Newark, NJ in October, Wells Fargo Center in Philly in November, and he&apos;ll return to MSG for a show on December 14th (worth noting: he has no shows scheduled between December 15th and January 3rd, so I wouldn&apos;t be shocked if he added a few more MSG dates once the initial one sells out, as it inevitably will). You can see all the tour dates, plus ticket purchasing info, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025143451/https://louisck.net/tour-dates">here.</a></p>

<p>But wait, there&apos;s more! C.K. promises he&apos;ll keep touring in 2017, because he can&apos;t stop, even if he hates Kansas City:</p>

<blockquote>The tour dates being announced today cover until mid January.  But I will be touring heavily far beyond that. So if you don&apos;t see your town on the list, it is likely that I&apos;m coming to you later in the year.  It&apos;s NOT because I hate your town.  Indeed I go to towns that I hate to work all the time.  For instance, I played in Kansas City this summer.  And I had a great time there.  And boy do I hate Kansas City.  I hate Kansas City so much, that I had to go to a doctor to &quot;have that looked at&quot;. Luckily, the doctor assured me that I am very healthy and that, indeed, Kansas City is an astonishing dump.  

<p>This tour has been great so far.  I&apos;m really enjoying it.  So I&apos;m going to keep it going for a long time.  How long?  I don&apos;t know.  </p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>In his email, he also encourages fans to watch Pamela Adlon&apos;s excellent new series <em>Better Things</em> (which he is a producer/writer on), and also gave an update on all the lousy parenting he&apos;s been getting up to:</p>

<blockquote>Otherwise nothing much is going on.  I&apos;m enjoying being as good a standup comedian as I can be right now and raising my children to the best of my ability, which makes me feel a little bit sorry for my children.  But YOU can rest assured that I&apos;m a far better comedian than I am a father.  For two simple reasons.  You pay me more than my children do.  The other reason is that if you apply experience, dedication, time, creativity, carelessness and care, study, patience and just tough hard work, to standup, you get better at it. If you apply all of that to parenting, you get worse. </blockquote>
