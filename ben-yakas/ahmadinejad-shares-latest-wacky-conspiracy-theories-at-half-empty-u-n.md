In <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120123073929/http://gothamist.com/2009/09/24/protests_outside_walkouts_inside_ah.php#photo-1">previous years</a>, half the delegates have walked out after Ahmadinejad railed against Jews, America, and rational thinking&#x2014;but things were truly <strike>different</strike> exactly the same this year. Ahmadinejad gave his usual dumb speech filled with anti-Semitic conspiratorial BS, and delegates from the U.S., France, Germany, the United Kingdom and nearly a dozen other countries all walked out in disgust. You can watch his entire <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120123073929/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/22/video_stephen_colbert_doesnt_get_th.php">&quot;argle-bargle&quot;</a> speech at the bottom, if you so wish.<p></p>

<p>This year, the theme of Ahmadinejad&apos;s talk was <strike>scrapbooking</strike> memories...<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120123073929/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/2011/09/22/2011-09-22_iranian_president_mahmoud_ahmadinejads_un_speech_prompts_us_delegation_to_walk_o.html">both imaginary and real</a> (mostly imaginary). Ahmadinejad suggested that President Obama had Osama Bin Laden killed to keep him from revealing who <em>really</em> was behind 9/11 (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120123073929/http://www.abovetopsecret.com/forum/thread1404/pg1">aliens?</a>). Then he ranted about how the Jews blah blah Zionism blah and America blah blah 9/11 blah: &quot;By using their imperialistic media network which is under the influence of colonialism they threaten anyone who questions the Holocaust and the Sept. 11 event with sanctions and military actions,&quot; he whispered lustily to the room. Someone obviously is aching for his own <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120123073929/http://videogum.com/378942/this-is-your-lucky-coin-the-we-killed-osama-bin-laden-coin/webjunk/viral-marketing/">Osama bin Laden gold coin</a>:</p>

<p>Mark Kornblau, spokesman for the U.S. Mission to the UN, was just as bored with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120123073929/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/04/us_diplomat_calls_ahmadinejad_the_g.php">&quot;The George Steinbrenner of Iran&apos;s&quot;</a> reheated hate speech as we were: &quot;Mr. Ahmadinejad had a chance to address his own people&apos;s aspirations for freedom and dignity, but instead he again turned to abhorrent anti-Semitic slurs and despicable conspiracy theories.&quot; It&apos;s a good thing that Ahmadinejad has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120123073929/http://gothamist.com/2010/10/14/chief_inspector_mahmoud_ahmadinejad.php">formed his own ragtag posse of independent truth-seekers</a> to investigate 9/11 outside the jurisdiction of those smug liberal elites in that fascist world organization. And it&apos;s extra good he recruited the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120123073929/http://www.southparkstudios.com/full-episodes/s10e09-mystery-of-the-urinal-deuce">Hardly Boys to help find some raging clues</a>!</p>
