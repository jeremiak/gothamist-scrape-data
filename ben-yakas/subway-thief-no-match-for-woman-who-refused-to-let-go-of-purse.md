                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="32013train.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130729105702im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/32013train.jpeg" width="640" height="421"> <br> <i> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130729105702/http://www.flickr.com/photos/lemmingstone/453689896/">lemmingstone&apos;s flickr</a></i></div> <p></p>

<p>The NYPD <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130729105702/http://www.nyc.gov/html/nypd/html/crime_prevention/riding_the_subway.shtml">would likely advise</a> that if someone tries to rob you on the subway, you shouldn&apos;t put up a fight (lest they have a weapon, or are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130729105702/http://gothamist.com/tags/subwayshoving">mentally unstable</a>). But one tenacious woman refused to part ways with her purse when she was attacked by a man on Monday&#x2014;even after he dragged her down a flight of stairs by the bag!</p>

<p>According to the criminal complaint, the 24-year-old woman was at the 18th Street 1 train station around 3:20 p.m. on Monday when 20-year-old Robert McLeod tried to snatch her purse. The woman, who wasn&apos;t identified in the complaint, was dragged down the stairs, hitting her head and injuring her leg in the process. </p>

<p>The woman suffered bruising, swelling and pain to her leg and head and was taken to the hospital. Transit police arrested McLeod at the station. He has since been charged with felony assault and attempted robbery. So would you accept being dragged down stairs to hold onto your belongings?</p>
