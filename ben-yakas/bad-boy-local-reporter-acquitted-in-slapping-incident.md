<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:220px; "> <img alt="32311dementri.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120119080118im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/32311dementri.jpg" width="220" height="281"> <br> <i>Vince DeMentri</i></div> The former WPIX reporter who was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120119080118/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/16/slap-happy_local_reporters_trial_gr.php">accused</a> of slapping the Bahamian UN ambassador&#x2019;s chauffeur over a parking spot <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120119080118/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2011/03/22/2011-03-22_former_wpix_reporter_vince_dementri_acquitted_at_trial_for_striking_un_ambassado.html">was acquitted</a> yesterday. Self-described &quot;bad boy&quot; Vince DeMentri was fired three days after the incident came to light last year, and immediately turned his focus onto getting his job back:<strong> &quot;I&apos;m the victim and I&apos;m not the villain and guess what, I need a job,&quot;</strong> he said, moments after dramatically throwing up his arms in a victory sign.<p></p>

<p>DeMentri had been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120119080118/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/21/slap_happy_local_news_reporter_figh.php">charged</a> with misdemeanor counts of attempted assault and harassment, but the testimony of the the chauffeur ended up being his best defense. Chauffeur Hurley Senanayake accused DeMentri of calling him the n-word, an allegation which came as a surprise to the defense, prosecution and judge. DeMentri&apos;s lawyer called the the lawsuit an attempt at a payday: &quot;This was absolutely the single worst witness I have ever come across,&quot; said Jeffrey Lichtman, whose former clients include John Gotti Jr.  The judge sided with him in the end. </p>

<p>&quot;I paid an incredible price. I just want my life back...My life won&apos;t be complete until I have my job back,&quot; DeMentri <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120119080118/http://www.philly.com/philly/entertainment/118471479.html">added</a>. If Ernie Anastos could make it, then we&apos;re sure DeMentri will figure out a way to keep <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120119080118/http://gothamist.com/2009/09/17/video_ernie_anastos_drops_f-bomb_ch.php">fucking that chicken.</a></p>
