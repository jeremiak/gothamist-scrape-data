                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="83113rosh.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20131128063651im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/83113rosh.jpg" width="640" height="443" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>We know it&apos;s Labor Day Weekend and you&apos;re probably only thinking far enough into the future to wonder where you&apos;re going to get a mojito this evening, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131128063651/http://gothamist.com/tags/roshhashanah">Rosh Hashanah</a> is coming up mighty soon&#x2014;it starts on Wednesday! Have you even bought <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131128063651/http://gothamist.com/2012/09/26/anal_atonement_we_ride_out_yom_kipp.php">your caffeine suppositories yet</a>? To better get you in the mood for the Jewish high holy days, watch the ridiculously great video below, a Rosh Hashanah-themed cover version of Daft Punk&apos;s &quot;Get Lucky.&quot;</p>

<p>This video has everything: shofar blasts, countless back flips, auto-tuned children, unkempt beards, inadvertent <em>Star Wars</em> references (&quot;The Force from the beginning&quot;), outdoor guitar solos, breakdancing, highly coordinated backup dancers, and apples dipped in honey. This is definitely up there with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131128063651/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2raQbAvo0s">the Colbert parody</a> and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131128063651/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3r3BOZ6QQtU">evolution of music version</a>.</p>
