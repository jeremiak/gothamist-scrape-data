But what if...what if you don&apos;t want to wait on line? If you&apos;re willing to part with some extra cash, you can call Robert Samuel, who started <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429081459/http://wecanwait4u.com/">SOLD Inc (Same Ole Line Dudes)</a> to aid in your quest to try the latest trendy thing FIRST because that is very important.</p>

<p>Samuel <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429081459/http://ny.racked.com/archives/2014/03/25/sold.php">talked to Racked</a> about his unique service (&quot;NYC&apos;s Only Professional Line Sitting &amp; Line Management Solution For Consumers &amp; Businesses&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429081459/https://twitter.com/sold_inc">reads their Twitter bio</a>), which charges $25 for the first hour and $10 for each additional half hour on a queue. </p>

<p>Here&apos;s the heroic origin behind the business, which Samuel says he inadvertently started in September 2012 at the iPhone 5 launch, which also happens to be the longest he&apos;s waited in any line.  </p>

<blockquote>19 hours for the iPhone. That was how the whole idea of line sitting came about. I was an employee at AT&amp;T;, and I lost my job. I wanted to supplement my income because I used to sell iPhones, and this time I wasn&apos;t going to be able to sell them and make a big commission check. I live a few blocks from the Apple store on 14th Street, so I said, &quot;Let me wait in line for somebody else and make them happy.&quot;

<p>The guy that hired me cancelled and said he wasn&apos;t going to use me&#x2014;he was just going to get it online but that he was still going to pay me. He paid me $100 and I resold the spot and made another $100, and then I called my friends and told them to come on down, because I just made $200 standing in one spot on a weekday afternoon.</p>

<p>They came down and took up spaces, but after a while they got tired and went upstairs to my house and hung out, and I ended up selling one of their spots. I also sold milk crates for $5 a piece that I had in my house. At this point, the line was getting long and people didn&apos;t want to stand, and some people didn&apos;t want to sit on cardboard on the floor, so my milk crates came in handy at $5 a pop. That&apos;s $325.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>Since then, the business has expanded: &quot;I have fifteen people that are interested and about seven that actually respond to my texts for jobs,&quot; he said. His client list has also widended, from &quot;two or three uber rich clients&quot; who want to stay on the cutting edge, to &quot; teenage girls that I did the Isabel Marant for H&amp;M.;&quot; He thinks business has boomed because of a phenomenon he dubs, &quot;FOMO: fear of missing out. Especially [in] New York, you have friends and you&apos;re hanging out and it&apos;s like, &quot;Did you see that new exhibit at MoMA?&quot; &quot;Do you know what a Cronut is?&apos;&quot;</p>

<p>Some of his descriptions of the lines make people sound surprisingly pleasant (&quot; No one&apos;s going to say, &apos;You move your feet you lose your space.&apos;&quot;) considering how early (5 a.m.) many of these lines start to form. Samuels adds that he hasn&apos;t gotten into any fights yet, but &quot;that&apos;s been one of my biggest fears.&quot;<br>
