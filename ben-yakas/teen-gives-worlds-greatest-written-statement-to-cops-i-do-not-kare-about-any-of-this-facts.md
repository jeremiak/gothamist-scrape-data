<p>A 16-year-old Staten Island teen was arrested this week (#boring) and charged with a hate crime (#h8crime) for a racially-motivated burglary (#youonlyliveyolo)&#x2014;but he apparently wasn&apos;t too worried about any of this. According <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130515185445/http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2013/04/teenage_staten_island_hate_cri.html#incart_m-rpt-2">to SILive</a>, 16-year-old suspect Shaquan Butler, of West Brighton, wrote out two statements on separate legal pads after being arrested: <strong>&quot;Hi, you&apos;ve got me in a room with cops. Big gas. Thank you tho,&quot;</strong> and, <strong>&quot;My statement. I do not kare about any of this. #facts.&quot;</strong> </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130515185445/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/nypd_blotter/nypd_daily_blotter_vhtP4vIuv6t3HWUmzg7bJO?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=NYPD%20Blotter">Police allege that</a> Butler and two other suspects targeted a neighbor&apos;s house across on March 27. According to court papers, Butler kicked the front door, then used a shopping cart to force it open; he held a broken glass bottle in his hand, while his accomplices carried a metal pipe and a knife. Butler allegedly yelled at one of the people who was home, &quot;Get the (expletive) out of here. We&apos;re going to take everything out. Get the (expletive) out of here you Mexican.&quot;</p>

<p>Later that evening, police came to arrest Butler, but he fled on foot. He ran into a home nearby, shoving aside a four-year-old boy in the process, then hid under a bed in the basement before officers found him. Butler has now been charged with second- and third-degree burglary as a hate crime, second-degree menacing as a hate crime, fourth-degree criminal mischief as a hate crime and second-degree criminal trespass as a hate crime.</p>

<p>When he was initially arrested, Butler denied he did anything wrong: &quot;It wasn&apos;t me. I don&apos;t know what you&apos;re talking about. I&apos;m cool with them,&quot; Butler said, according to law-enforcement sources. But then he allegedly admitted he was in the house...but he had a darn good reason to be: &quot;I was inside a couple of months ago. <strong>OK, I was in that day. I was going to borrow a scale.&quot;</strong></p>
