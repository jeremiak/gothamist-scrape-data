title: That'sss All Folksss: Bronx Zoo Cobra Officially Named "Mia"
---

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:365px; "> <img alt="040711cobra.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120607200807im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/040711cobra.jpg" width="365" height="250"> <br> <i>Introducing...Mia!</i></div> It was barely two weeks ago that the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120607200807/http://gothamist.com/tags/egyptiancobra">Bronx Zoo Cobra</a> escaped from her cage and slithered her way into our hearts. Since then, we&apos;ve had a lot of fun keeping track of her Twitter updates, making snake puns, and trying to come up with a name for her. The results of that naming contest <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120607200807/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2011/04/07/2011-04-07_meet_mia_bronx_zoo_cobra_finally_has_a_name_thanks_to_new_yorkers_who_voted_in_o.html">are now in</a>, and she will forever more be known as...Mia. As in &quot;missing in action.&quot; Hey, at least it wasn&apos;t <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120607200807/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/04/cobra_naming_contest_down_to_five_n.php">Wanda</a>. She <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120607200807/http://twitter.com/#!/BronxZoosCobra/status/56026718267375617">tweeted</a> her lukewarm response to the news: &quot;So, the vote is in. They want to name me Mia. <strong>But in my heart I&apos;ll always know that my true name is Mrs. Justin Bieber.&quot;</strong><p></p>

<p>Mia beat out the other four finalists, Cleopatra, Subira, Amanuet, and Agnes, in the naming contest, which drew nearly 60,000 voters. She will go back on display for the first time since she escaped this Saturday at the Bronx Zoo. Unfortunately, none of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120607200807/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/03/cmon_bronxdini_is_the_best_cobra_na.php">our suggestions</a> were taken into account, including <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120607200807/http://twitter.com/#!/johnsellers/status/54024467600523264">Hissy Elliott</a>, Hissni Mubarak, Fangtasia, Lady McAdder, and the entirely appropriate Runaround Sue&#x2014;songwriter Dion DiMucci grew up one block from the Bronx Zoo, after all. </p>

<p>We&apos;re not sure if this marks the end of our collective obsession/love affair with Mia, but since we were already once bitten by her charms, we hope she is not too shy to make some appearances in the future. In the meantime, here&apos;s a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120607200807/http://thedailywh.at/2011/04/06/bamf-of-the-day-5/">harrowing video</a> of some asp-hole in sandals just going about his business, cleaning the snake pit perilously:</p>
