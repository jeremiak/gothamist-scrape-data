<p>Look, we might not personally be into peeling off our Jordaches, knocking knees with de-pantsed trailblazers, and risking communicable diseases during the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150103063606/http://gothamist.com/tags/nopantssubwayride">No Pants Subway Ride</a>. But it&apos;s pretty much the cuddliest, least threatening post-undergrad collegiate-aping event this side of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150103063606/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8XGmZ8HDIU">Bomont</a>. Sadly, that&apos;s not how the MTA feels&#x2014;which is what subway motorman Christopher Chase, who was written up for participating in the event this winter, recently discovered: &quot;I think it&apos;s stupid,&quot; said Chase <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150103063606/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/mta-worker-spanked-joining-pants-subway-ride-article-1.1743702">told the Daily News</a>. &quot;I don&apos;t see the point in making such a big deal over nothing. I wasn&apos;t on duty or in uniform or anything like that, and it was a public event.&quot;</p>

<p>Chase, 39, who has worked for the MTA for nine years, was written up for &quot;conduct unbecoming&quot; for going in his skivvies on his day off (he was actually officially on vacation during that time) for the No Pants ride <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150103063606/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/13/photos_no_pants_subway_ride.php#photo-1">in January.</a> In addition, he was &quot;reinstructed&quot; on the MTA&apos;s code of conduct, and ordered to promise in writing that he would &quot;refrain from any future behavior that could sully the MTA&apos;s reputation.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We received a complaint and had to look into it,&quot; MTA spokesman Kevin Ortiz said about the photo above, which Chase posted to his Facebook wall. Although he wasn&apos;t officially &quot;disciplined,&quot; Chase was upset enough to get his union involved: TWU Local 100 lawyer Betzabeth Sanchez wrote in a complaint to the MTA that the writeup was &quot;plainly unreasonable&quot; and a &quot;chilling&quot; violation of the right to free speech. </p>
