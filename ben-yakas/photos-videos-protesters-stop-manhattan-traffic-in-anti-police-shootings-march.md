<p>Traffic was brought to a standstill along Fifth Avenue by 6 p.m. Thursday as protesters make their way toward Times Square; as of 6:20 p.m.,  Fifth Avenue was totally shut down on W 29th Street according to people at the scene. Protesters have been allowed to move freely through stopped traffic, with police generally taking a hands-off approach to the march so far.</p>
