                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="11014train.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20140214033711im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/11014train.jpeg" width="640" height="413" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>Last year, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140214033711/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/31/video_delightful_ventriloquist_prov.php">we were thoroughly charmed</a> by the voice-throwing techniques of Queens-born Nigel Gabriel Dunkley, aka <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140214033711/https://twitter.com/@docta_gel">Docta Gel</a>.

<p>Did his efforts prove fruitful? We&apos;ll have to wait for Sunday to find out, when the second part of the video is released. For what it&apos;s worth, he&apos;s really made us re-think our longstanding apprehension toward <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140214033711/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyzDqv8Cfjw">dummies with dummies.</a></p>
