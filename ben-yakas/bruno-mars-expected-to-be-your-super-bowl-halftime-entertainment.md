<p>After last year&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151207093802/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/03/what_time_does_beyonce_perform_at_t.php">Beyonce Bowl</a> symbolically (or literally?) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151207093802/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/04/superdomes_super_bowl_blackout_caus.php">caused power outages</a> at the Superdome, it&apos;s understandable that officials would want to choose someone slightly less spectacular for this year&apos;s Super Bowl halftime show. And <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151207093802/http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-bruno-mars-super-bowl-20130906,0,6962677.story">according to the LA Times</a>, they&apos;ve chosen just the correct low wattage of star power in that case: Bruno Mars is expected to perform at the halftime show at Super Bowl XLVIII next February. Bon Jovi fans won&apos;t be happy about this.</p>

<p>With the Super Bowl taking place at MetLife Stadium in February, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151207093802/http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2013/08/super_bowl_xlviii_halftime_show_local_promoters_suggest_billy_joel_and_cirque.html">locals were hoping that</a> someone like Bon Jovi or Billy Joel would get the nod this year (patron saint of NJ Bruce Springsteen already had a crotch-splitting performance in 2009). One fan had this vision: &quot;We have this amazing heritage of artists &#x2014; everybody from Bruce to Bon Jovi to Dionne Warwick to Kool &amp; the Gang to Frankie Valli,&quot; New Jersey Performing Arts Center CEO John Schreiber told The Star-Ledger. &quot;It&#x2019;s like an amazing mashup of brilliant Jersey-born-and-raised musicians. You would see the history of rock, performed by the greatest artists in the world, who all hail from New Jersey.&quot;</p>

<p>Maybe officials really did want Bon Jovi, but the band is in disarray after guitarist Richie Sambora left the band (or was kicked out) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151207093802/http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/music-arts/bon-jovi-guitarist-richie-sambora-booted-band-reports-article-1.1435431">earlier this year.</a> And Joel <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151207093802/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/26/magazine/billy-joel-on-not-working-and-not-giving-up-drinking.html?pagewanted=all">sorta hates pop music</a> these days. An NFL spokesman would only jokingly confirm to LA Times that &quot;Janet Jackson and Miley Cyrus have been ruled out as performers.&quot;</p>

<p>So instead of Jay-Z and Justin Timberlake, instead of Taylor Swift or Lady Gaga or Adele or another NSYNC reunion or (our dream choice) David Bowie, we&apos;re left with Mars, who is perfectly adequate and completely uninspiring. He only has two albums and a few huge singles (the best of which, &quot;Locked Out Of Heaven,&quot; is pretty much a rip off of The Police), but certainly won&apos;t be the worst act to grace the halftime show (it&apos;s hard to imagine anything topping the Black Eyed Peas in that regard). It&apos;s just pretty underwhelming coming after The Boss, The Stones, Paul McCartney, Prince, Madonna, The Who and Beyonce. </p>

<p>Though we suppose this <em>is</em> a huge get for the fedora industry.</p>
