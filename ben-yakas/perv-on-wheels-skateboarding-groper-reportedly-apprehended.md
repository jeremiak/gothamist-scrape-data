In the past week, we&apos;ve heard several first-hand accounts of an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150527143604/http://gothamist.com/tags/serialgroper">Upper East Side serial groper</a> who has been attacking women for the past seven months. Then earlier today, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150527143604/http://gothamist.com/2011/07/21/bicycle-riding_groper_attacking_wom.php">we heard about</a> the bicycle-riding groper attacking women all over Astoria. And now, it seems that a skateboarding groper has been apprehended by police on the Upper West Side near Columbia! Reader Mary M. recounted her experience with the groper this afternoon below:  <p></p>

<blockquote>Well there seems to be something in the air...

<p>I&apos;ve read about the UES groper, and I live in Astoria, so this morning I came across the why leave Astoria post about the bicycle gropers.</p>

<p>The latest (and I almost can&apos;t believe this actually happened), skateboard-by groping!</p>

<p>I&apos;m currently teaching at a Summer camp near Columbia university.  Today, as I was walking back to camp after lunch, on BROADWAY, about 1:15 pm, a guy on a skateboard was approaching me. He looks like a student, certainly not out of place.<strong> As he passes he reaches over and grabs my breast!</strong></p>

<p>I didn&apos;t know what to think for the first 30 seconds, it was so odd! Luckily, I was right near the Columbia security booth so I immediately went there, spoke to them, and called 911.</p>

<p>The good news is, the cops caught the guy within 15 minutes! He had grabbed about 6 other girls around the same time and place. Phew!</p>

<p>What I wanna know, however, <strong>is how someone wakes up in the morning and decides &quot;today, I&apos;m going to put on my sweet straw fedora, skateboard through a busy campus area, and grab as many ladies as I can!&quot; and you really expect to not get caught??</strong></p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>We called the police to get more details on the arrest, but they told us they had no information about it at the time, though once we told them the details we knew, they advised that we should call back a little later for more info.</p>
