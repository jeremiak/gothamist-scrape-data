<p>We&apos;ve been trying to wean ourselves off of eating worms ever since we saw a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151107221021/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Eat_Fried_Worms_%28film%29">terrifying documentary</a> about the subject, but it seems that many New Yorkers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151107221021/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/arousing_success_for_love_bug_p4CC6laeuVGjIQ4Q7xdPTK?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">have been turning</a> to the squirmy invertebrates as an amorous remedy. &quot;Himalayan Viagra,&quot; aka &quot;yarsagumba&quot; or &quot;dong chong xia cao,&quot; is being sought out by older men to jumpstart their love lives&#x2014;the dried dead bodies of the worm can be brewed into an anti-impotence tea. And you know it&apos;s gotta work if people are shelling out serious bones to get it.</p>

<p>The virile worms <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151107221021/http://blog.xnepali.com/yarsagumba-the-himalayan-viagra/">come from</a> the highlands of Nepal, where they are attacked by a beige fungus that kills and entombs them. Older NYers have been paying $800 an ounce for the slithery Viagra substitute: &quot;It&apos;s like the ultimate invasion of the body snatchers...It&apos;s hard to come by, and the demand for it is very high because of there&apos;s a lot of hype,&quot; said Thomas Leung, owner of Kamwo, a Chinese herbal pharmacy on Grand Street. Leung, who remembers selling the worms for $6.50 decades ago, said the sweet-tasting substance is commonly used in formulas to treat chronic asthma, and is a centuries-old remedy for lung and kidney health. &quot;The kidneys are responsible for sexual and reproductive functions, so people kind of stretch that and say, &apos;Well if you consume this, you&apos;ll have that.&apos; Very few people who sell this are going to tell you that, because they want to keep the hype up,&quot; he added. He also sounds mildly amused by the absurd amount Westerners are willing to pay for it: <strong>&quot;People always ask, &apos;Is it really that good?&apos; And I say, &apos;It&apos;s not $800 good.&apos; &quot;</strong></p>
