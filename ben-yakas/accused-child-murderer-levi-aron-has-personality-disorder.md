<p>Although the man who confessed to killing and dismembering 8-year-old Hasidic boy Leiby Kletzky last month was recently found <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170223082622/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/04/child_murder_suspect_found_fit_for.php">mentally competent</a> to stand trial, a psychiatric evaluation has found that he has a personality disorder. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170223082622/http://gothamist.com/tags/leviaron">Levi Aron</a>, who has pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder and kidnapping charges, is portrayed as a troubled, confused man with a &quot;flat&quot; and &quot;apathetic&quot; mood in the report, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170223082622/http://online.wsj.com/article/AP28fdbe63dd9045dc862c3467f3bcbbe4.html">according to the AP</a>. In addition, it was revealed that his sister died while institutionalized for schizophrenia. </p>

<p>This week, Aron was moved from Bellevue Hospital to Rikers Island; but the accused killer is being housed apart from the other inmates and being kept on suicide watch. &quot;He&apos;s in an area all by himself. They opened it up just for him,&quot; a jail supervisor <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170223082622/http://www.nydailynews.com/blogs/dailypolitics/2011/08/confessed-child-murderer-levi-aron-moved-from-bellevue-to-rikers-island-placed">told the News.</a> They also note that it costs the city more than $70,000 to house an inmate on Rikers for a year, and that number shoots up with the added expense of a personal monitor.</p>

<p>Last weekend, Aron&apos;s self-proclaimed best friend <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170223082622/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/06/friend_says_accused_child_murderer.php">called him </a>&quot;borderline retarded.&quot; Police <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170223082622/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/05/accused_child_killer_levi_arons_con.php">also released</a> his chilling full confession, which included bizarre quips to police after he was arrested, such as &quot;I&apos;m famous.&quot; Aron&apos;s defense attorney&apos;s have previously claimed that the court-ordered psychological exam found that Aron had been hearing voices and &#x201C;telling him to take his own life for what he did.&#x201D;</p>

<p>The &quot;Jewish Elvis,&quot; Hasidic singer Lipa Schmeltzer, has unveiled his seven minute long tribute to Leiby, &quot;Leiby Forever.&quot; He spoke <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170223082622/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2011/08/10/2011-08-10_hasidic_singers_video_pays_tribute_to_leiby.html?r=news&amp;ut">to the News</a> about his motivation for writing the song: &quot;Leiby represents a message. We couldn&apos;t find Leiby alive. But there are so many people alive who are still lost. Fathers without jobs. Kids without food. We need to make the world a happier place.&quot; A portion of the sales from &quot;Leiby Forever,&quot; which is now on sale at iTunes and TopJewishMusic.com, will go to the Leiby Kletzky Memorial Fund.</p>
