<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="122312lanza.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20121224171520im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/122312lanza.jpg" width="640" height="480"> <br> <i> Ryan Lanza (Facebook); Adam Lanza (AP)</i></div> <p></p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: It seems the Facebook chat scoop was too good to be true: the NY Post has updated their story about Ryan Lanza saying <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121224171520/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/national/killer_bro_miss_him_UBnKkkMyeD6oCL13RIWiAL">they had been tricked</a>. &quot;A spokesman for the Lanza family says an imposter is behind Ryan Lanza&apos;s Facebook page and that Ryan did not post the messages in this story.&quot; We&apos;ve updated the story to reflect this change.</p>

<p>The Post reported earlier today that for the first time since he was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121224171520/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/14/photos_videos_what_we_know_about_al.php">erroneously identified</a> as the suspect in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121224171520/http://gothamist.com/tags/newtownshooting">the devastating Newtown school shootings</a>, Ryan Lanza allegedly spoke out about the death of his mother, Nancy Lanza, and brother, actual shooter Adam Lanza. &#x201C;I am a victim,&#x201D; the person allegedly posing as 24-year-old Ryan <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121224171520/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/national/killer_bro_miss_him_UBnKkkMyeD6oCL13RIWiAL">told the Post in a Facebook chat</a>. &#x201C;I loss [sic] my mom and brother.&#x201D;</p>

<p>The Post claimed that Ryan popped back up on Facebook this weekend, posting tributes to both his brother and mother on a page that has since been discredited. Under a picture of a younger Adam, the person wrote: &#x201C;R.I.P...I will miss you bro. I will always love you as long as I live.&#x201D; Under a photo of his mother, he wrote: &#x201C;I miss you mom. I love you so much. You will be always in my heart.&quot; He also left a message for the 20 children and six teachers who were killed in the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting: &#x201C;You all will be truly be missed,&#x201D; he wrote. &#x201C;God Bless.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Another person posted on this fake Facebook wall that his brother deserved to &#x201C;rot in hell&#x201D; and was the &#x201C;scum of the earth.&#x201D; The impostor responded: &#x201C;I am so tired of people blaming me for something my brother did. I love Adam, his [sic] my brother,&#x201D; he wrote. &#x201C;But you have no right to call my brother names when he isn&#x2019;t here no more. Just let my brother rest in peace. Please. Respect that.&#x201D; This person explained to the Post: &#x201C;He is calling my brother a monster when he don&#x2019;t even know him,&#x201D; Lanza said.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121224171520/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/tears-fall-newtown-victims-laid-rest-article-1.1226040">last three funerals</a> for victims of the mass shooting happened this weekend as well: Josephine Gay, 7, and Ana Marquez-Greene, 6, were eulogized in Connecticut, while 6-year-old Emilie Parker was buried in Utah. &#x201C;It does not make sense,&#x201D; Robert E. Weiss said during his homily at Josephine&#x2019;s funeral Mass at St. Rose of Lima Roman Catholic Church. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121224171520/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/23/nyregion/newtown-mourns-last-of-its-children-killed-in-massacre.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">He added that</a> the children did not die in vain: &#x201C;If these 20 cannot change the world, then no one can,&#x201D; he said. </p>

<p>Police Chief Michael Kehoe <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121224171520/http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=50137654n">also sat down with CBS</a> to describe the &quot;carnage&quot; he witnessed as one of the first responders inside Sandy Hook: &quot;It was devastating, absolutely devastating. I had no words, I felt a little bit of anger towards the person who had done this.&quot; He said he also felt regret that he couldn&apos;t have been there to stop the murders: &quot;Well you feel a sense of guilt that you weren&apos;t there quick enough to do that. But I also know that our response stopped the threat where he was, and he could not proceed any further,&quot; said Kehoe.</p>
