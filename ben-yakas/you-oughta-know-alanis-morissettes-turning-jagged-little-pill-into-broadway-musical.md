<p>Notable Canadian <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408100937/http://gothamist.com/tags/alanismorissette">Alanis Morissette</a> took over the music world in 1995 with her confessional album <em>Jagged Little Pill</em>. The album spawned something like 4 zillion hit singles and sold 33 gajillion albums, and turned Morissette into a household name for awhile. Fast forward 18 years and a lot of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408100937/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanis_Morissette_discography">awkwardly-titled follow-up albums</a> later, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408100937/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/184191-Alanis-Morissette-Adapting-Hit-Album-Jagged-Little-Pill-for-Broadway">Morissette has announced</a> that she&apos;s turning <em>Pill</em> into a Broadway musical. Is this ironic? Is this a little bit ironic? Is it too ironic? </p>

<p>Morissette is adapting all the songs from the album, plus other material from her catalogue and new songs written specifically for the production. She&apos;s collaborating with Tony and Pulitzer Prize winner Tom Kitt (who worked on the jukebox musical version of Green Day&apos;s <em>American Idiot</em>), who will write orchestrations and new arrangements for the production. </p>

<p>The best part of all of this of course is Morissette&apos;s classic Morissette-esque statement on the project, which is just as purple as you&apos;d hope: &quot;I look forward to taking the heart of Jagged Little Pill and expanding its story, <strong>fleshing it out into ever deeper layers of emotionality, specificity, humanity, power, physicality, spirit and fabulism</strong>,&quot; Morissette said in a statement. &quot;I look forward to collaborating with [producer Vivek J. Tiwary] and Tom and our whole inspiring team to create something greater than the sum of our parts.&quot;</p>

<p>Hopefully she can weave in a cameos from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408100937/http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/entertainment/2013/09/how-dave-coulier-knew-alanis-morissettes-you-oughta-know-was-about-him/">Dave Coulier</a> and Larry David:</p>
