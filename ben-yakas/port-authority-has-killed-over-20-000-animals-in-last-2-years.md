<p>This week, animal lovers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508153028/http://gothamist.com/2014/03/01/nyc_will_wipe_out_mute_swans_with_b.php">were relieved</a> when the Department of Environmental Conservation announced that they would scuttle their aggressive plan <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508153028/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/29/die_swans_die.php">to either shoot or lethally gas</a> mute swans around NY, in favor of using birth control to curtail the growing population. But here&apos;s a sobering counterpoint: the Port Authority has killed approximately 20,561 animals over the last two years at various city airports.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508153028/http://nypost.com/2014/03/02/pa-killed-20k-animals-at-area-airports-in-past-two-years/">The Post found out</a> all the 2012-13 data through a Freedom of Information request. The dead animals include one endangered species (Northern Harrier), one threatened species (American Kestrel), 11 at risk species (Ospreys), and a shit ton of gulls (5,729 Laughing gulls, 2,445 Herring gulls, 414 Great black-backed gull). The Port Authority has long taken the initiative to kill animals it deems at risk of interfering with flights at airports, from the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508153028/http://gothamist.com/2013/12/09/snowy_owls.php">snow owls</a> to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508153028/http://gothamist.com/2010/11/16/turns_out_geese_were_gassed_at_jfk.php">geese.</a> After some of these larger-scale incidents, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508153028/http://gothamist.com/2013/12/10/snowy_owls_wont_be_slaughtered_anym.php">authorities have promised</a> to trap and relocate animals in the future, although those promises have sometimes <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508153028/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/10/700_geese_sent_to_special_place_whe.php">turned out to be hollow.</a></p>

<p>Bizarrely, the Port Authority also killed a parakeet, which outraged Priscilla Feral, president of nonprofit <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508153028/http://friendsofanimals.org/">Friends of Animals</a> (who sued the PA last year over <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508153028/http://friendsofanimals.org/news/2013/december/victory-snowy-owls">the killing of snow owls at JFK</a>). &quot;The idea that parakeets would bring down an aircraft is ridiculous,&quot; she said. &quot;This gives you an idea of how trigger-happy they [the PA] are.&quot;</p>

<p>In 2012, a Port Authority spokesman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508153028/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/10/keeping_jfks_airspace_safe_by_keepi.php">gave us some insight</a> on the constant struggle to keep winged animals at bay, explaining that a team of wildlife supervisors drive around JFK in SUVs using noisemakers, balloons, lasers, and shotguns to disperse or kill birds that may put human fliers in danger. </p>
