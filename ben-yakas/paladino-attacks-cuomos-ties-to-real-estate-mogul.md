<p>After a week of doing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130702175237/http://gothamist.com/tags/carlpaladino">everything wrong</a>, it&apos;s nice to see Kooky Carl Paladino getting back to his core values, and the bread and butter of his campaign: hard-hittingly hilarious <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130702175237/http://gothamist.com/2010/10/07/new_paladino_posters_photoshop_our.php">photoshopped posters</a>. His latest one depicts gubernatorial opponent Andrew Cuomo with some of NY&apos;s more troubled Democratic politicians. Among them is Andrew Farkas, the real estate mogul who currently serves as finance chairman in Cuomo&#x2019;s campaign for governor, but who used to be one of Cuomo&apos;s enemies.</p>

<p>In 1997, while serving as the nation&apos;s housing secretary, Cuomo was pursuing a case in which Farkas&#x2019;s financial company had paid millions of dollars in kickbacks to a landlord. They settled the case however, and became friends a few years later; Cuomo even worked for one of Farkas&apos;s companies, and was paid more than $2.5 million in salary. Paladino has routinely criticized Cuomo for his relationship with Farkas, who has helped Cuomo raise hundreds of thousands of dollars for his campaign: &quot;Here&#x2019;s a man who stole millions of dollars, and Andrew gives him a pass,&#x201D; Paladino said on a radio show last week. The Times has the whole complicated tale of their relationship <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130702175237/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/15/nyregion/15cuomo.html">here</a>.</p>
