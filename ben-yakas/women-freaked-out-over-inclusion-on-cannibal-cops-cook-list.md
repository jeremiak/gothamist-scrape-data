<p>This week, an NYPD officer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509002320/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/25/fbi_arrests_nypd_officer_for_attemp.php#photo-1">was arrested for allegedly attempting</a> to &quot;kidnap women and cook them.&quot; Gilberto Valle, a 28-year-old married six-year veteran of the NYPD, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509002320/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/25/photos_cannibal_cop_called_himself.php#photo-1">has been charged with</a> conspiracy to kidnap and accessing a computer without authorization. Yesterday, it was revealed that Valle was turned in by his wife <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509002320/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/26/cannibal_cop_was_turned_in_by_horri.php">after she discovered his &#x201C;tactical plan,&#x201D;</a> which he called his blueprint for &#x201C;Abducting and Cooking,&#x201D; on his computer. Some of the women on that list are significantly freaked out about being included: &#x201C;I was so shaken when I found out it was him,&#x201D; Beverly Seiger <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509002320/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/queens/cop_chicks_freakassee_ZX8gE1PgAY3woK2SBM9lwK">told the Post</a>. &#x201C;I used to walk his dog. I&#x2019;ve been to his house many times. He&#x2019;s been to my house.&#x201D; </p>

<p>&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t want to be on his list!&#x201D; Seiger said. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m so thin, he would use me as toothpicks.&quot; She says she got to know him at a Forrest Hills park he would visit regularly with his wife and baby daughter. &#x201C;The women in this neighborhood now are freaked out,&#x201D; she added. &#x201C;Nobody was skeeved by him at all. He was normal,&quot; said Judy Levin. &#x201C;You wouldn&#x2019;t think twice about inviting him into your house.&#x201D; Realizing she hadn&#x2019;t seen Valle&#x2019;s bulldog, Dudley, since his arrest, &#x201C;I thought, &#x2018;Oh my God, did he eat the dog?&#x2019; &#x201D; Another man remarked, &#x201C;I know three girls who are scared and concerned because he knows what buildings they live in.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Valle was actually arrested on Wednesday, even though it wasn&apos;t announced until Thursday&#x2014;that&apos;s because cops spent that time <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509002320/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/hunt-cannibal-pals-article-1.1193612">trying to find out who Valle&apos;s two co-conspirators are</a>. One of them is believed to be living outside the country, but the other&#x2014;who discussed &#x201C;buying&#x201D; an unnamed woman from Valle for $5,000 in February&#x2014;lived in the country at the time. Cops are trying to track them down still.</p>
