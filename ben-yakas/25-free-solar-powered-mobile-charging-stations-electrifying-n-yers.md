</div></div>					<p>Forget <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429152226/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/21/of_course_park_slope_gets_solar_pow.php">solar-powered trash cans</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429152226/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/24/solar-powered_pizza_boxes_hitting_u.php">solar-powered pizza boxes</a>: New Yorkers have been getting a free charge this week thanks to newly-installed solar-powered mobile device charging stations. So far, there are 25 of these stations spread out across the five boroughs as part of AT&amp;T;&apos;s pilot program, and as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429152226/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/21/in_defense_of_salmoning_on_a_bike.php">Gothamist&apos;s in-house salmon</a> put it, &quot;People seem excited about these stations.&quot;</p>

<p>But the best part is that you don&apos;t need AT&amp;T; to use them: they accommodate up to six devices at a time, with dedicated ports for iPhones, Androids, BlackBerrys and standard USB charging cables. As <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429152226/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/18/technology/att-to-introduce-solar-powered-charging-stations.html?_r=1&amp;">the Times notes</a>, the initial stations in DUMBO, Union Square Park and other places will only be there for three-to-four weeks at a time until October. But if the program is deemed successful, you can expect a lot more of them to pop up in the future.</p>

<p>You can check out the full list of locations with this <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429152226/http://www.att.com/Common/about_us/pdf/att_street_charge.PDF">PDF map here</a>.</p>
