<p>How do you get people to pay attention to gun safety issues? It&apos;s a topic which Mayor Bloomberg and anti-gun groups nationwide <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140629061933/http://gothamist.com/tags/nra">have struggled with</a> at times, especially in the face of the NRA&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140629061933/http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2013/03/national-rifle-association-ads-history">intense advertising campaigns.</a> But one gun organization, that advocates for gun safety, may have figured out a way to brake through the gun rhetoric miasma: dildos.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140629061933/http://www.takeonthecode.com/index.html">Evolve</a>, a NYC-based gun safety group (not a political organization) that believes in gun safety and the reduction of gun violence, has come up with novel approach to the polarizing gun debate: &quot;Find a human insight - one that is true and indisputable to both sides of the debate - and leverage that insight to make the world a better place,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140629061933/http://www.forbes.com/sites/willburns/2014/06/27/evolve-introduces-a-new-weapon-in-the-gun-debate-human-nature/">Forbes writes</a>. &quot;In the case of the Evolve video, the insight isn&#x2019;t about gun rights or banning guns, but something as simple as, <strong>&apos;If they find it, they will play with it.&apos;</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>If they&apos;re looking for more gun safety ideas for their next ad campaign, all they have to do is look around: NYC is full of drunk cops <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140629061933/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/01/drunk_corrections_officer_allegedly.php">waving around their weapons in bars</a>, tourists <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140629061933/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/24/psa_to_everyone_dont_bring_your_gun.php">carrying loaded guns at major sites</a>, and Homeland Security chiefs <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140629061933/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/06/ny_state_homeland_security_commissi.php">using guns as laser pointers.</a></p>
