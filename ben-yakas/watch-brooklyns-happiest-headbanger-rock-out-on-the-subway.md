<p>Anyone born with the ability to grow <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151210153605/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0vf3o0vOi4">god-given strands of metal hair</a> has a God-given duty to rock their locks to the fullest extent of the Gwar. And so we proudly salute the young man in the video below sporting Chris Cornell-circa-1988 locks headbanging his way across Brooklyn on the R train, as if he were on his way to meet <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151210153605/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TIDqRu3Xyw">Riki Rachtman</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151210153605/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hrwJnBxwlU">skulking Eddie Veddar.</a> </p>

<p>The fact he also practices his scary metal voice completely unselfconsciously&#x2014;in addition to performing several windmill head moves on-and-off <strong>for 11 minutes</strong>&#x2014;only enhances our admiration. If only we could know what sweet siren had inspired such ferocity of headbanging&#x2014;it&apos;s probably the same thing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151210153605/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DypvmH4ov4">that got these grandparents headbanging.</a></p>
