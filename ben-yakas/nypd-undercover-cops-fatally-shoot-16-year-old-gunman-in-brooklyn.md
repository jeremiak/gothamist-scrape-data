<p>Two plainclothes police officers fatally shot a 16-year-old in Brooklyn last night, after the teen allegedly pulled a loaded gun on them. According to police, Kimani Gray was shot multiple times in the leg and stomach when he pointed a .38-caliber gun at the cops in East Flatbush just before 11:30 p.m. on Saturday. &quot;The cops, they just jumped out of the car so fast,&quot; witness Devonte Brown <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170225043545/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/teen-fatally-shot-police-brooklyn-saturday-night-article-1.1284326">told the News</a>. &quot;They started shooting him and he went down, he was bleeding, holding his side, screaming, &apos;stop, stop,&apos;&quot; Brown said of Gray.</p>

<p>Police say that the two officers were on patrol in the area in an unmarked car when they saw a group of young males in front of 473 East 52nd Street. Officers said Gray split from the group when he noticed the officers, and he began adjusted his waistband. The officers got out of the car and walked toward Gray, who had the loaded .38 caliber black revolver in his hand. </p>

<p>The officers fired upon Gray at least six times; Gray didn&apos;t fire any shots. He was taken to Kings County Hospital, where he died. Both officers were taken to New York Methodist Hospital in stable condition with trauma and tinnitus. &quot;We didn&apos;t know he had a gun,&quot; said 15-year-old Akeem Brown, who was one of the six teens hanging with Gray. &quot;We were just hanging out.&quot; Cops added that Gray had four prior arrests on his record, including charges of grand larceny, possession of stolen property and inciting a riot.</p>
