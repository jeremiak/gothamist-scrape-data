<p>Seventy-two-year-old songwriter, film director and one-time Oscar winner (for penning schmaltzy &apos;70s pop tune &quot;You Light Up My Life&quot;) Joseph Brooks  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811113120/http://gothamist.com/2010/01/20/oscar_winner_joseph_brooks.php">was previously indicted on 91 counts</a> for allegedly luring at least 13 young women to his apartment via Craigslist ads and raping and sexually assaulting them. And now prosecutors claim that&apos;s just the tip of the iceberg.</p>

<p>According to prosecutors, Brooks promised the would-be starlets fame and a part in his next movie, but is accused of sexually assaulting and raping them (this is the man who once <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811113120/http://www.romantic-lyrics.com/ly6.shtml">wrote</a>, &quot;it can&apos;t be wrong when it feels so right&quot;). Today, on the eve of his trial in Manhattan Supreme Court, prosecutors <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811113120/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2011/01/28/2011-01-28_joseph_brooks_oscarwinner_accused_in_13_sex_assaults_attacked_many_more_women_pr.html">say that they have evidence</a> that Brooks attacked at least a dozen more women in years past. </p>

<p>The statute of limitations means he can&apos;t be tried for those assaults, but prosecutors want the women to testify as character witnesses. His son, Nicholas Brooks, is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811113120/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/06/soho_house_murder_suspect_allegedly.php">accused</a> of killing his fashion designer girlfriend at the Soho House. </p>
