<p>A Westchester schools superintendent <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150528011601/http://www.lohud.com/story/news/education/2014/05/02/greenburgh-schools-chief-sued/8608299/">has been sued by eight employees</a> who say he used racist profanity to yell at them&#x2014;and that included 26 variations of the word &quot;bitch.&quot; The Greenburgh School District employees&#x2014;which include a human resources director, a principal, guidance counselors and teachers&#x2014;say they&#x2019;ve been &quot;intimidated, degraded, rendered anxious, distracted from their professional duties and responsibilities&quot; by superintendent Ronald O. Ross and his use of language. He probably didn&apos;t know that when it comes to that word, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150528011601/http://gothamist.com/2012/09/02/philosopher_kanye_west_ponders_the.php">feelings are the only facts.</a> </p>

<p>Here&apos;s the full list of &quot;bitch&quot; variations he allegedly wielded against his coworkers and subordinates:</p>

<ul>
	<li>&quot;White Bitch&quot;</li>
	<li>&quot;Whining White Bitch&quot;</li>
	<li>&quot;Black Bitch&quot;</li>
	<li>&quot;Fat Bitch&quot;</li>
	<li>&quot;Old Black Bitch&quot; </li>
	<li>&quot;Old Fat Black Bitch&quot;</li>
	<li>&quot;Nazi Bitch&quot;</li>
	<li>&quot;Russian Bitch&quot;</li>
	<li>&quot;Cancer Bitch&quot; </li>
	<li>&quot;Jew Bitch&quot;</li>
	<li>&quot;Midget Bitch&quot; </li>
	<li>&quot;Fat Drunk Bitch&quot; </li>
	<li>&quot;False Titty Bitch&quot; </li>
	<li>&quot;Fake Titty Bitch&quot; </li>
	<li>&quot;Old Black Bitch&quot; </li>
	<li>&quot;Old Fat Black Bitch&quot; </li>
	<li>&quot;Nosey Jew Bitch&quot;</li>
	<li>&quot;Black Bitches&quot;</li>
	<li>&quot;Dumb Bitch&quot;</li>
	<li>&quot;Fucking White Bitch&quot; </li>
	<li>&quot;Fat White D-e Bitch&quot; </li>
	<li>&quot;White D-e Bitch&quot;</li>
	<li>&quot;Drunken Bitch&quot;</li>
	<li>&quot;Deaf White Bitch&quot; </li>
	<li>&quot;Racist White Bitch&quot; </li>
	<li>&quot;Racist Brazilian Bitch&quot;</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to that impressive list, Ross allegedly used other racial terms such as &quot;Aunt Jemima,&quot; &quot;Clarence Thomas,&quot; &quot;White Uncle Tom,&quot; &quot;White Devil,&quot; &quot;sell out,&quot; &quot;crackers,&quot; &quot;trailer trash,&quot; and &quot;Oreo.&quot; The employees say he mocked teachers for both losing and gaining weight over the school intercom; he suggested a teacher&apos;s cancer was caused by her being a bitch (see: &quot;Cancer Bitch&quot;); he made derogatory comments about both Muslims and Jews; and he told female students they were &quot;going to be roofied and raped&quot; in college.</p>

<p>When <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150528011601/http://nypost.com/2014/05/03/42-obscene-and-racist-ways-a-schools-superintendent-referred-to-his-employees/">confronted by the Post</a> about the charges, Ross told them, &quot;I don&#x2019;t know anything about it.&quot; Is it possible the employees got Ross confused with another linguist who has a known fondness for the word &quot;bitch?&quot;</p>
