But the perps who manhandled the house of the Antos family were no average burglars. No, these cold-hearted robbers were just assholes.<p></p>

<p>The Antos&apos; son, Eric, 8, has cystic fibrosis, and is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110706134320/http://www.cff.org/Chapters/longisland/">literally the poster child</a> for the Long Island branch of the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. The thieves broke through a back window of their West Sayville home, drugged their dogs, and stole $726 that had been donated to Eric. They also took Eric&apos;s medicine, which costs $2,000-a-month, and which his family cannot afford to replace currently. According to Eric&apos;s doctor Joan DeCelie-Germana, the medicine would be of no use to a drug addict looking for a fix. They also stole a teddy bear that Eric picked up on a trip to Disney World, which was paid for by the Make-A-Wish Foundation. &quot;I&apos;m scared of going to sleep because I don&apos;t want him coming back in when I&apos;m sleeping,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110706134320/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2010/09/16/thieves-rob-sick-child-of-his-medication/">said Eric Antos.</a> </p>

<p>His mother is understandably distraught: &quot;If the guy is that desperate that he&apos;s got to steal, steal money, jewelry whatever. Keep that. Just give me my son&apos;s medication. That&apos;s what he needs to sustain his life,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110706134320/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local&amp;id=7672119">Stacey Antos told ABC.</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110706134320/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cystic_fibrosis">Cystic Fibrosis</a> is a disease that causes thick mucus to build in the lungs and digestive tract that causes progressive disability and sometimes early death.</p>
