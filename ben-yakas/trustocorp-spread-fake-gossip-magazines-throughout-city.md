<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111111202955/http://www.trustocorp.com/">Trustocorp</a> have been developing quite the reputation with their public art projects, from street signs advising you <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111111202955/http://gothamist.com/2011/07/20/new_signs.php#photo-1">to cheer up</a> to street signs notifying you that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111111202955/http://gothamist.com/2010/01/11/street_artist_reminds_brooklyn.php">you&apos;re lame</a>, from indictments of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111111202955/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/18/trustocorp_takes_on_reality_televis.php">reality TV shows</a> to warnings not to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111111202955/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/11/psa_dont_feed_the_hipsters.php">feed the hispters.</a> Now, they&apos;ve unveiled <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111111202955/http://arrestedmotion.com/2011/08/streets-contests-trustocorp-tabloid-magazine-interventions/">their newest project</a>: they&#x2019;ve gone into magazine stands, bookstores and pharmacies throughout Hollywood, Manhattan, Williamsburg, LAX and JFK to mix copies of their fake gossip rags, featuring pregnant Donald Trump, a sexed-up Sarah Palin, and an overdosed Lindsay Lohan, in with the real ones. Unlike their other projects, which were somewhat passive in nature, this &quot;intervention&quot; seems harder for the consumers of tabloid culture to ignore.
