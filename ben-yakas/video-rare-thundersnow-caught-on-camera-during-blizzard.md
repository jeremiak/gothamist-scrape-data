<p>Weather enthusiasts have long called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170404091741/http://gothamist.com/tags/thundersnow">Thundersnow</a> the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170404091741/http://gothamist.com/2010/12/26/rare_thundersnow_happening_in_manha.php">&quot;holy grail&quot;</a> of meteorological events&#x2014;it is the incredibly rare kind of thunderstorm with snow falling instead of rain. The last time we saw it was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170404091741/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/26/and_we_have_thundersnow.php">over two years ago</a>&#x2014;but it happened <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170404091741/https://twitter.com/BuzzFeedNews/status/300002623661162497">all across</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170404091741/https://twitter.com/Occuweather/status/300024602271301632">Long Island</a> and other parts of NY during last night&apos;s nor&apos;easter. And the elusive event was even captured on camera by Christine Heeren in Middle Island, NY. Watch below, and see the sky literally turn purple!</p>
