<p>Internet dating: If you&apos;re not getting <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150103064317/http://gothamist.com/2014/04/02/spurned_okcupid_date_steals_womans.php">robbed in real life by your date</a>, then you&apos;re probably getting conned by them in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150103064317/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/29/recession_tip_make_matchcom_suckers.php">some other way</a>. A two-time cancer survivor says that she was cheated out of $86K by a man she met on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150103064317/http://gothamist.com/tags/match.com">Match.com</a>. &quot;I cashed money out of an IRA; out of, you know, retirement money,&quot; the woman, who didn&apos;t want her name used, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150103064317/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2014/04/04/woman-scammed-out-of-86000-on-match-com-relationship/">told CBS</a>. &quot;You want to believe, because you think you&#x2019;re developing a relationship.&quot;</p>

<p>The 59-year-old woman, who lives in Montclair, NJ, had a six-month online relationship with  a man who called himself Maxwell Yas in 2012. Yas, who used a fake photo, claimed he was 60 years old, from New York, and working as a civil engineer in Malaysia. He told her he was in financial trouble and needed money, and she agreed to wire it to him: &quot;I&#x2019;ve always been a very rational person, and everything told me: &apos;No, you have to question this. It doesn&#x2019;t sound right,&apos;&quot; the woman said.</p>

<p>The FBI have launched an investigation, but say it is highly unlikely they&apos;ll recover the money. The woman wants to tell her story, though, to warn others of similar scams: &quot;No matter what they say; no matter what kind of tale they tell you, you really have to be brave and say no.&quot;</p>

<p>Although Match has done a decent job of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150103064317/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/18/matchcom_to_eliminate_sex_offenders.php">weeding out sex offenders</a>, this is far from the first grifter to take advantage of lonely people on the site: a 53-year-old Long Island divorcee lost $25K to one in 2010, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150103064317/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/13/nobody_can_resist_the_romeo_grifter.php">at least two men</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150103064317/http://gothamist.com/2010/01/29/dating_site_grifter_convinced_women.php">have been arrested</a> and charged with perpetrating cons on the site.</p>

<p>And these troubles have extended to other online dating sites including OKCupid, which was recently <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150103064317/http://gothamist.com/2014/03/19/queens_man_sues_okcupid_after_date.php">sued by a Queens man</a> after he was swindled out of $70K by a man he met on the dating website.</p>
