<p>Jon Stewart, Javier Munoz of <em>Hamilton</em>, and an adorable street urchin joined Stephen Colbert on <em>The Late Show with Stephen Colbert</em> last night for a mini-musical on the importance of voting in this election. And it included a centerpiece gag with Colbert and Stewart doing a double spit take as Colbert reminded Stewart about who exactly is running this year: &quot;Are you serious? That angry tax-and-draft-dodging little orange groundhog is running for president?&quot; Watch below, or else Trump&apos;s tiny hands might get a nuke.</p>
