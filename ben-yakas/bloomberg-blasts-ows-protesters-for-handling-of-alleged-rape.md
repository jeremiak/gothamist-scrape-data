<p>Every day, Mayor Bloomberg seems to be getting <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111104062519/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/21/mayor_bloomberg_promises_to_start_a.php">angrier and angrier</a> at Occupy Wall Street protesters, whether it&apos;s because they&apos;re <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111104062519/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/08/old_man_bloomberg_tired_of_occupy_w.php">ruining tourism</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111104062519/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/13/protesters_refuse_to_leave_zuccotti.php">making a mess</a>, or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111104062519/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/02/mayor_bloomberg_says_he_isnt_playin.php">hurting families</a>. Today, he chastised OWS for how they handled the situation with the kitchen worker who was arrested for sexual abuse in the Zuccotti Park tents yesterday. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111104062519/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/mayor-bloomberg-blasts-occupy-wall-street-protesters-reporting-crimes-cops-article-1.971741">Bloomberg was furious about a report that</a> demonstrators kicked the man out of the park instead of calling police: &quot;If this is in fact happening&#x2014;and it&apos;s very hard to get good information&#x2014;<strong>it is despicable. I think it is outrageous and it really allows the criminal to strike again making all of us less safe.&quot;</strong></p>

<p>26-year-old Tonye Iketubosin of Crown Heights <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111104062519/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/02/occupy_wall_street_kitchen_worker_a.php">allegedly raped an 18-year-old woman</a> from Massachusetts early Saturday morning, and sexually assaulted another 18-year-old woman on October 25th at the park. According to Beau Sibbing, a Wisconsin resident who has been working in the kitchen at Zuccotti Park for the past three weeks,  Iketubosin was banned from the park after word spread of the allegations; but he kept showing up, and on Tuesday night, &quot;a whole bunch of people came and made him leave the park. Then the NYPD picked him up. I wasn&apos;t sure if it was for his own safety or if he was being arrested.&quot;</p>

<p>The mayor called the occupiers&apos; version of vigilante justice &quot;disturbing,&quot; and was asked if he was &quot;very&quot; concerned about the practice: &quot;&apos;Very&apos; understates it. It is a very high priority. We have an obligation to protect everybody in the city.&quot; He added that recent developments have left Brookfield Properties, who owns the park, &quot;very concerned&quot; about what&apos;s happening there: &quot;They are clearly worried about their liability and we are dealing with them all the time,&quot; he said. </p>

<p>Yesterday, after a group of lower Manhattan politicians petitioned him to crack down on quality-of-life infractions. Bloomberg <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111104062519/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/02/mayor_bloomberg_says_he_isnt_playin.php">told reporters that</a> OWS was wearing out its welcome, and &quot;no one should think that we won&apos;t take actions that we think are appropriate when we think they are appropriate.&quot;</p>
