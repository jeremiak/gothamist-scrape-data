<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161203153831/http://gothamist.com/tags/stephencolbert">Stephen Colbert</a> returned from Thanksgiving vacation just in time to mercilessly mock Mitt Romney for his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161203153831/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/30/trump_catchers_mitt.php">dinner date with the devil</a> this week. After playing a clip of Romney insulting Donald Trump during the campaign (&quot;He gets a free ride to the White House, and all we get is a lousy hat&quot;), Colbert continued, &quot;Yes, all we get is a lousy hat, and the garlic soup and frogs legs. I bet those frogs legs taste a little bit like Trump&apos;s balls.&quot; Come for the eating crow jokes, stay for the sad trombone sound effect. </p>

<p>While we normally associate him with musicals we haven&apos;t seen and promoting dangerous driving habits, James Corden also couldn&apos;t help but get in on the Mitt action, summarily identifying Mitt&apos;s face in the much-circulated photo of him and Trump at dinner: &quot;That&#x2019;s the exact same face he makes when his wife catches him watching a PG-13 movie on Netflix.&quot;</p>
