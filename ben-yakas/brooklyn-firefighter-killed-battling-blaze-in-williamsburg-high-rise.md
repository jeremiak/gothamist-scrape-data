<p>A Brooklyn firefighter <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140709015035/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/06/nyregion/firefighter-dies-after-blaze-at-brooklyn-high-rise.html?partner=socialflow&amp;smid=tw-nytmetro">died while battling a blaze</a> at a Williamsburg high rise last night. Officials say that a fire broke out on the 19th floor of a 21-story public housing building at 75 Wilson Street around 9 p.m. Saturday. Lt. Gordon Matthew Ambelas, 40, a 14-year veteran of the FDNY, was searching for residents on the 19th floor when he got stuck in an apartment and fatally injured. </p>

<p>&quot;We have lost a real hero tonight and our hearts are heavy,&quot; Mayor de Blasio said at a press conference last night outside Woodhull Medical Center (you can see it above). &quot;I ask every New Yorker to keep the lieutenant in their prayers.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He was trapped deep into the [burning] apartment and he did sustain multiple injuries,&quot; added FDNY Commissioner Daniel Nigro. &quot;Ambelas went into the apartment to search for life and did not come out, and by the time his brother firefighters found him, it was too late for him.&quot;</p>

<p>Last month, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140709015035/http://www.nyc.gov/html/fdny/html/events/2014/062614b.shtml">Ambelas was honored</a> for helping to save 7-year old Mendy Gottlieb, who got his arm and head trapped in a roll-down security gate and was pulled 15 feet off the ground. Ambelas and fellow firefighter Lashawnda Brinson used the &quot;jaws of life&quot; to get him out, and were given plaques: &quot;[This incident] shows that FDNY members are always ready to help others,&quot; he said at the time. &quot;It was great teamwork all around.&quot;</p>

<p>Ambelas <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140709015035/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/firefighter-critical-condition-brooklyn-blaze-article-1.1856407">is survived by</a> his wife, Nanette, and two daughters. More than 100 firefighters were called for the fire last night, which was under control by 10:30 p.m.; four other people, including two firefighters, had minor injuries.</p>
