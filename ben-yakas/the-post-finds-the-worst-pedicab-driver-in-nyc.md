title: The Post Finds The Worst Pedicab Driver In NYC
---

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="121210pedicab.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623141615im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/121210pedicab.jpg" width="230" height="252" class="image-left"> </span></p>

<p>We&apos;ve heard plenty about rotten taxi shenanigans, from drivers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623141615/http://gothamist.com/2010/10/24/man_dragged_by_taxi_who_refused_to.php">who refuse</a> to go to Brooklyn to nefarious <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623141615/http://gothamist.com/2010/11/28/driver_alleges_taxi_scam_was_purpos.php">overcharging conspiracies.</a> But the true scourge on wheels isn&apos;t cab drivers, but rather those lawless renegades known as pedicabs. And if they were to have a poster child, he would be Seydou Kone, the &quot;worst pedicabby in New York City,&quot; according <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623141615/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/worst_cabby_in_nyc_xHKFbL99KAou2bGGk2HexK">to the Post.</a></p>

<p>By his own admission, Kone is not a law-abiding citizen: he has accumulated nearly 90 violations this year and four open arrest warrants for failing to pay tickets. Kone says that he often runs red lights, doesn&apos;t signal at turns, disobeys traffic signs, blocks crosswalks and even rides on sidewalks. He sounds like he&apos;s almost proud of his unlawfulness, and practically brags to the Post about it; he even let them take a lovely portrait for their bitter piece on him. Unfortunately for him, the Post <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623141615/http://gothamist.com/tags/pedicab">really really</a> hates pedicabs, and by extension hates him and quotes such as this: &quot;I got a court day Monday, Friday and next Friday, too...Sometimes the cops like to give out the ticket. We don&apos;t do anything. It&apos;s not only me. It&apos;s pedicab drivers.&quot; Thankfully the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623141615/http://gothamist.com/2009/10/15/video_rickshaw_spider-man.php">Spiderman rickshaw driver&apos;s</a> good name has not been sullied!</p>
