<p>Have you gotten the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430052616/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/28/alec_baldwin_2_text_w3dding_411_to.php">411 text</a> yet on where <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430052616/http://gothamist.com/tags/alecbaldwin">Alec Baldwin&apos;s</a> wedding reception will be taking place later today? No matter: the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430052616/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/wed_you_gonna_do_about_it_YZcFHaodP9c01rbiJShVvI?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Manhattan">NY Post has you covered</a>. Baldwin&apos;s wedding to fianc&#xE9;e Hilaria Thomas will take place at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430052616/http://www.oldcathedral.org/">St. Patrick&#x2019;s Old Cathedral</a> on Mott Street&#x2014;and the reception will take place NYU&apos;s Kimmel Center, on the top floor of the building&#x2019;s Rosenthal Pavilion room. So now paparazzo know exactly where to bring their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430052616/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/22/daily_news_sends_alec_baldwin_passi.php">passive agressive wedding gifts.</a></p>

<p>The Post adds that the space can hold up to 300 guests, offers &quot;stunning views of Washington Square Park,&quot; and goes for a &quot;bargain- basement price of just $615 for four hours for NYU alumni, such as Baldwin.&quot; As for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430052616/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/29/alec_baldwin_2.php">yesterday&apos;s minor altercation with a photographer</a> outside his East 10th Street home, Baldwin&apos;s daughter Ireland told the Post it was a case of pre-wedding stress: &#x201C;[he&apos;s] actually a very mellow guy, and since he changed his diet, he&#x2019;s been doing so much better...This is all just wedding stress.&#x201D; </p>

<p>As if to prove his daughter right, Baldwin shared a public smooch with Thomas last night outside Italian eatery Emporio in Nolita&#x2014;right in front of mortal enemies the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430052616/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/alec_baldwin_and_fiance_share_sidewalk_4F2BaSsRCUFCPcvw6zqgbJ">Post</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430052616/http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/alec-baldwin-fiancee-hilaria-thomas-engage-pda-cameras-eve-wedding-article-1.1105304">Daily News.</a> The Post handled the PDA with the maturity of an 8-year-old: &quot;Aww...Eww...&quot;</p>
