<p>Faced with the prospect of another year in the shadow of White Castle, with their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429130130/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/10/white_castle_burger_scented_candles.php">erotic scented candles</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429130130/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/29/white_castle.php">sexy Valentine&apos;s Day reservations</a>, KFC finally stepped up to the big leagues with the most romantic of big gestures: fried chicken prom corsages. &quot;Looking for a corsage that will make your date&#x2019;s eyes light up and her mouth water?&quot; Kentucky floral shop <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429130130/http://www.nanzandkraft.com/gifts/kfc-chicken-corsage">Nanz &amp; Kraft write</a>. &quot;This KFC drumstick corsage is the Secret Recipe to making sure this year&#x2019;s dance will be one you both remember.&quot; Especially when it is exhibit A in a class action lawsuit against KFC about the marketing of fatty foods and its deleterious effects upon children.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429130130/http://www.kfc.com/corsage/">The KFC Chicken Corsage</a> costs $20 each, and contains a $5 gift card so you can customize your corsage with Original Recipe, Extra Crispy, or Kentucky Grilled Chicken. Just so it&apos;s clear: they send you the corsage, and then you take the gift card and buy a piece of chicken from your local KFC. They don&apos;t actually ship you the corsage with the chicken. They aren&apos;t barbarians.</p>

<p>Of course, you don&apos;t even need to be going to prom to get one of these babies&#x2014;you could just be someone who wants a way of gnawing on processed chicken scraps without having to get grease all over your fingers. And it&apos;s completely reusable! If so, make sure you order soon&#x2014;there are 100 available, and as of yesterday, at least <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429130130/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/lifestyle&amp;id=9501774">20 had been ordered.</a> Ernie Anastos would definitely be in favor of this product.</p>
