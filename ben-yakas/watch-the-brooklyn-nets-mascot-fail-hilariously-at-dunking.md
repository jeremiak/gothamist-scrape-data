										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="101613nets.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428175932im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/101613nets.jpeg" width="640" height="456" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>For a while now, we&apos;ve been wary of the Brooklyn Nets&apos; mascot the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428175932/http://gothamist.com/2012/11/05/15_nets_tickets_are_one_way_to_forg.php">Brooklyn Knight</a>, an armor-plated <em>Voltron</em> reject who shoots sparks out of his toes. Last night during a Nets/Celtics preseason game, the Knight officially dropped off our creepy list thanks to what has to be one of the worst attempts at dunking in the history of professional mascots. </p>

<p>&#x201C;You could not do that if given a thousand chances,&quot; said anchor Ian Eagle during the YES Network broadcast of the game. &quot;Maybe five hundred thousand chances.&#x201D; Best of all, nobody could get the ball down at first, so play just resumed with it lodged underneath the shot clock into the second quarter.</p>

<p>In conclusion, go home Brooklyn Knight, you&apos;re drunk.</p>
