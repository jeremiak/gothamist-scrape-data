<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:250px; "> <img alt="62211dog.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623135601im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/62211dog.jpg" width="250" height="309"> <br> <i>Guapo! (via News)</i></div> What monetary amount is extreme emotional distress equal to? For one Long Island man who really, really misses his best friend, it&apos;s exactly $11 million. Ilich Jorquera <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623135601/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2011/06/22/2011-06-22_man_sues_exgirlfriend_for_11_million_for_running_off_with_his_pet_schnauzer_name.html">is suing his ex-girlfriend</a> for that amount, claiming that she stole their two-year-old Schnauzer Guapo after they broke up. &quot;I miss him every single day. Sometimes I talk to myself and I feel like I&apos;m talking to him... I love that dog and I know I can take better care of him,&quot; said Jorquera, a landscape contractor.<p></p>

<p>Jorquera <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623135601/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/dog_man_sues_ex_girlfriend_for_after_egEjgPzwGF7oEaGnbVwtkJ">claims in his lawsuit</a> that he and his girlfriend of five years, Carla Pimentel, split up earlier this year; after he returned home in February from a trip, he discovered she had taken the pooch. He admits that the dog was registered in his ex&apos;s name, but he says they both agree he was the primary caretaker, walking him four or five times a day: &quot;I walked him, fed him and played with him every day...he was my best friend.&quot; He also says he took financial responsibility for the dog, and paid for Guapo to go to the vet and groomer every month.</p>

<p>Jorquera was shocked that Pimentel would secretly take the dog. He hasn&apos;t heard from his ex in four months, and has become impatient with the emotionally distressing situation: &quot;She was just too busy to properly care for him... I cannot wait any longer for Carla to come to her senses.&quot; His lawyer noted that although most animals are treated as property, Guapo is much more to her client: &quot;One cannot just get another dog and expect that animal to fill the void.&quot;</p>
