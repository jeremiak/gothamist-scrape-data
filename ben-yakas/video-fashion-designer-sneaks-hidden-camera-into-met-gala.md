<p>The Metropolitan Museum of Art&apos;s big annual gala, aka the Met Gala, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505201817/http://gothamist.com/2014/05/05/photos_lupita_beyonce_kim_kanye_tay.php#photo-1">took place this week</a>&#x2014;and you almost certainly weren&apos;t there (though if you were, please feel free to take us next year). However, fashion designer Cynthia Rowley decided to strap a GoPro Hero3 camera to her purse and record the festivities. This is basically the closest we&apos;ll get to being a celebrity, at least until we make our way back into John Malkovich&apos;s brain.</p>

<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="//web.archive.org/web/20150505201817if_/http://www.youtube.com/embed/9mr_Ty09Quk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>You can definitely see J Crew boss Jenna Lyons (along with Public School designers Maxwell Osborne and Dao-Yi Chow), Michelle Williams (but only her body), Hayden Panettiere (she&apos;s the one laughing, always laughing), Donatella Versace, Bill Cunningham (1:30!), Dita Von Teese, Katie Couric&apos;s elbows, and &quot;a shoeless Lena Dunham tip-toeing through the Met.&quot; Maybe YOU can recognize even more celebrities, because you always have been a celebrity inside, and you&apos;ve just never been given a chance to shine, but this is your chance to shine, you celebrity you.</p>

<p>But wait, there&apos;s more: this wasn&apos;t the only internal video captured of the festivities. Full time model and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505201817/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/08/michelle_rodriguez_had_great_time_m.php">part time Michelle Rodriguez drinking buddy</a> Cara Delevingne uploaded a few videos of herself in an elevator with other starlets (including Reese Witherspoon, Zooey Deschanel, and Kate Upton). </p>

<p>The videos have been removed, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505201817/http://gawker.com/partying-reese-witherspoon-dispenses-sex-wisdom-in-elev-1573454926">but Gawker has them here</a> for your vicarious viewing pleasure. Now if someone could just explain what Witherspoon meant when she said, &quot;[You know] what&apos;s the most important thing in a name&#x2014;for a girl? It&apos;s that a man can whisper it into his pillow,&quot; that would be most helpful. </p>

<p>Finally, here&apos;s an exclusive look inside the ladies&apos; room:</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: The video has been made private for some reason, which is the digital equivalent of a bouncer stepping in front of you and gently pushing a hand into your chest, making it clear <em>you don&apos;t belong.</em></p>

<p>The Daily Mail <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505201817/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2623329/An-close-personal-glimpse-inside-Met-Ball-secret-CAMERA-designer-Cynthia-Rowley-hid-purse.html">has some more screenshots</a> from the vid in the meantime; while we all wait to see if the video will be put back up, we&apos;ll be here whispering Reese Witherspoon&apos;s name into our pillow.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: ABC thankfully captured the video before it went down, so we can begin the process of learning to live again (vicariously):</p>
