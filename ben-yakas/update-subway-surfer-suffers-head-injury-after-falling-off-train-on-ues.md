<p>Police add that the investigation is ongoing. Southbound 6 service is running express from 125th Street to Grand Central right now. We&apos;ll update with any more information as it becomes available. </p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: Police say the 45-year-old man was riding <em>on top of</em> the 6 train when he fell and hit his head on a steel beam.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151209204330/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/man-rushed-hospital-riding-top-subway-article-1.1501501">According to the News</a>, the 45-year-old man who fell off the train was a homeless man who friends call &quot;Grumps.&quot; And he was reportedly smoking synthetic marijuana, K2, before climbing onto the train. &quot;He was hanging out getting high,&quot; said Pablo Reyes, who identified himself a friend. &quot;I told him, &#x2018;Stop getting high off that s**t. It ain&#x2019;t no good for you. He probably was hallucinating.&quot;</p>

<p>&#x201C;He was standing up with his hands open,&#x201D; Reyes added. &#x201C;He saw the beam coming. He laid down. He tried to duck down. It opened his head right up.&#x201C; Reyes said Grumps had been panhandling earlier in the day, and has been homeless for about a year.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: The News now reports that the man who fell off the train has died.</p>
