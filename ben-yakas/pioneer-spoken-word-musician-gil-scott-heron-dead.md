<p>Musician Gil Scott-Heron, whose politically-charged spoken-word music paved the way for modern rap, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120124131313/http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2011/05/27/us/AP-US-Obit-Gil-Scott-Heron.html?_r=1&amp;partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">died yesterday</a>. The writer of the seminal &quot;The Revolution Will Not Be Televised&quot; was 62 years old. Listen to a clip below.</p>

<p>Scott-Heron is known for his mix of minimalist percussion, often anchored by long-time collaborator pianist Brian Jackson, and highly expressive lyrics, a blend of poetry and politics which critiqued the superficiality of modern America, and chronicled inner-city living and &quot;black America.&quot;</p>

<p>Born in Chicago, Scott-Heron moved to the Bronx when he was a teenager; in 1970, he released his breakthrough album, <em>Small Talk At 125th and Lennox</em>, which he recorded in Harlem, and which set the groundwork for the rest of his career, which included more than a dozen albums. In 1974, he released one of his most acclaimed records, <em>Winter in America</em>, which included the soul single &quot;The Bottle.&quot;</p>

<p>He was often referred to as the &quot;Godfather of Rap&quot;, a title he found lacked nuance: &quot;If there was any individual initiative that I was responsible for it might have been that there was music in certain poems of mine, with complete progression and repeating &apos;hooks,&apos; which made them more like songs than just recitations with percussion,&quot; he wrote in the introduction to his 1990 collection of poems, &quot;Now and Then.&quot; Nevertheless, Kanye West cited him as a major inspiration, and sampled him on his songs &quot;My Way Home&quot; and &quot;The People.&quot; Scott-Heron&apos;s final fantastic album, <em>I&apos;m New Here</em>, was released last year.
