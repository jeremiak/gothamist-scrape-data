                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="62613sanchez1.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130731071829im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/62613sanchez1.jpg" width="640" height="480" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>If interception-throwing aficionado <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130731071829/http://gothamist.com/tags/marksanchez">Mark Sanchez</a> never threw another pass for the Jets, he&apos;d have a hard enough time as it is living down his infamous <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130731071829/http://gothamist.com/2012/11/23/thanksgiving_day_massacre_jets_on_b.php">Thanksgiving Day buttfumble</a>, the play that has become synonymous with the team&apos;s Sanchise-era. But maybe he&apos;s not too worried about his derriere overshadowing his sinking career, since he has no problem shaking his rump for two attractive young ladies in a series of Vines that were deleted, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130731071829/http://www.terezowens.com/mark-sanchez-dances-naked-with-two-girls/">then re-spawned</a> in the videos below. </p>

<p>In case you feel scandalized by the butt above, the video contains glimpses of Sanchez bopping around, smoking something, flashes of cleavage and wine bottles, and a woman whose joyous scream sounds like that of a fussy baby. According <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130731071829/http://deadspin.com/mark-sanchez-looks-like-he-had-a-grand-old-time-last-ni-573703698">to Deadspin</a>, one of the young women in the video is Alana Kari&#x2014;she&apos;s the one who initially posted the Vines, taken in California&#x2019;s Napa Valley, which she subsequently deleted. Obviously this is embarrassing, but Sanchez should take some comfort in knowing he&apos;s not the footballer player <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130731071829/https://twitter.com/Patriots/status/349894951775125504">having the worst day today.</a></p>
