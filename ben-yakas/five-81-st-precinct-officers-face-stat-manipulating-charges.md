Among them is Deputy Inspector Steven Mauriello, the former commanding officer of Bedford-Stuyvesant&apos;s 81st precinct, and one of the major figures in the stat manipulation lawsuit brought about by Officer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111101203227/http://gothamist.com/tags/adrianschoolcraft">Adrian Schoolcraft</a> this year.<p></p>

<p>Mauriello is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111101203227/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2010/10/15/2010-10-15_nypd_deputy_inspector_steven_mauriello_charged_with_tampering_with_crime_reports.html">accused</a> of tampering with grand larceny and stolen vehicle reports, as well as misleading investigators. Back in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111101203227/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/26/brooklyn_leaders_call_for_81st_prec.php">May</a>, City Council members and community leaders asked NYPD Commissioner Ray Kelly to relieve Mauriello of duty because of his role in the stats lawsuit; on Officer Schoolcraft&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111101203227/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/05/brooklyn_cops_secret_recordings_rel.php">secret recordings</a>, you can hear Mauriello, who was his precinct commander in 2008 and 2009, ordering officers to make arrests with the intent of coming up with a charge later, rounding up people on low level charges such as &quot;blocking the sidewalk&quot; or not having identification, and holding them for hours. He was ultimately transferred from the 81st to the Bronx. </p>

<p>According to Roy Richter, head of the Captains Endowment Association, Mauriello &quot;feels abandoned by the department he has faithfully served for over two decades.&quot; Among the other four officers, one sergeant is accused of failing to verify that two patrol officers filed a robbery complaint, while two patrol officers are charged with not filing the complaint in the first place; a second sergeant is expected to be charged next week. Nevertheless, the five officers only face internal charges, were not removed from duty and were expected to keep their jobs, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111101203227/http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5ieTjbEWm3fOShrzZ4JXW2outcRGA?docId=ddaf7a4ff6e142e39fcbac1ae57825ce">according to officials</a>. They will receive disciplinary recommendations from an administrative judge, and could face lesser penalties such as loss of pay or vacation days.</p>
