					<p>Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump both suspended their presidential campaigns to travel to  Ground Zero this morning to join mourners for the 15th anniversary of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016143137/http://gothamist.com/tags/911">September 11th attacks</a>. They were joined by Mayor Bill de Blasio, former Mayor Rudy Giuliani, NJ Gov. Chris Christie, and outgoing NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton to honor the 2,977 people killed that day.</p>

I&#x2019;m glad there are more people here today because the crowd was getting less and less. People still remember. That&apos;s the important thing.&quot;</p>

<p>Neither of the candidates, who have promised to suspend campaign activities today in honor of the occasion, spoke at the event.

<p>Clinton, who was at the time New York&apos;s junior senator and visited the site the day after the attacks, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016143137/http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/11/politics/hillary-clinton-september-11/index.html">was interviewed by CNN</a> about her memories of the day. &quot;We saw this curtain of black smoke that was stretched across the island,&quot; Clinton recalled. &quot;Occasionally it would be broken by a firefighter coming out. I remember one image so indelibly, dragging his ax, and it was as close to depiction of hell that I&apos;ve ever personally seen.&quot; </p>

<p>Calling it a &quot;sickening experience,&quot; she added that she has met with families in the years since the attacks: &quot;I would meet these shattered lives of people where they were broken, but I saw so many of them strengthen and show such resilience. So I felt privileged,&quot; Clinton said. &quot;It gave me an insight into the human spirit&#x2014;and I like to think the spirit of New York and America&#x2014;that I wish every American could understand.&quot;</p>

<p>Clinton reportedly overheated at the ceremony and left after an hour and a half, heading to her daughter Chelsea&apos;s apartment near Madison Square Park. She released the statement below.</p>
