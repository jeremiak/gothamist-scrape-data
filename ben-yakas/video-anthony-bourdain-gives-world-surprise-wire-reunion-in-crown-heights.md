<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160629074024/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/04/anthony_bourdains_final_destination.php">As we mentioned</a> over the summer, Anthony Bourdain decided to wrap up <em>No Reservations</em> on the Travel Channel (before moving to CNN) with a farewell trip to Brooklyn. A clip from the series finale, airing November 5th, is now online&#x2014;and it features a surprise reunion of two awesome actors from <em>The Wire</em>! You come at the king, you best bring delicious goat curry.</p>

<p>As you can see, Bourdain had Michael K Williams, forever known as Omar Little, helping him out on his tour of Crown Heights. And while eating at Gloria&apos;s, they run into actor Jamie Hector, better known as the ruthless drug kingppin Marlo Stanfield. &quot;By the way, this is a totally unset up, coincidental moment,&quot; Bourdain claims in the voiceover. Well, his name is his name, so we&apos;ll go with it. Also watch out for a cameo from the NY Times&apos; David Carr at 2:26. </p>

<p>Of course, this isn&apos;t the first time Bourdain has hung-out with various <em>Wire</em> actors:</p>
