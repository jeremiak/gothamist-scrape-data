                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="102313anchorman.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20140307060856im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/102313anchorman.jpg" width="640" height="479" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>After years of rumors, months of hype, and dozens of commercials featuring Will Ferrell&apos;s mustachioed face shilling for some product or another, <em>Anchorman 2</em> was finally released into the world this past winter. And it was...<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140307060856/http://www.metacritic.com/movie/anchorman-2-the-legend-continues">perfectly okay</a>, if kind of forgettable. But even if you found it underwhelming, you might love the new version of the film packed with 763 new jokes coming to theaters next week!</p>

<p>Before the film was released, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140307060856/http://thedissolve.com/news/768-a-separate-movie-is-being-made-from-anchorman-2-ou/">director Adam McKay noted</a>, &quot;We did so much improv on this one that we can literally replace every single joke in the movie and put in alt scenes and alt improv runs. I think the editor&#x2019;s working on it right now, with 250 new jokes.&quot; He mentioned the idea of releasing a super-sized version of the film on the midnight movie circuit or perhaps a DVD release ala <em>Wake Up Ron Burgundy</em>. </p>

<p>But it seems Paramount executives &quot;surprised them by insisting on a theatrical rerelease,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140307060856/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/21/movies/anchorman-2-returns-call-it-2.html?_r=1">according to the Times</a>. As a result, the rerelease, officially called <em>Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues: Super-Sized R-Rated Version</em>, will be in theaters for one week only starting next Friday. It&apos;s at least 20 minutes longer, much raunchier, and includes a musical number. &quot;This is a stitched up, Frankenstein version,&quot; McKay said. &quot;You&apos;ll either love it or hate it.&quot;</p>
