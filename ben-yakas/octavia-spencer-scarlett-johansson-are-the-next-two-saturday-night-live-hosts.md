<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170227011636/http://gothamist.com/tags/snl"><em>Saturday Night Live</em></a> has enjoyed its <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170227011636/http://pagesix.com/2017/02/07/trump-spoofs-drive-snl-ratings-to-22-year-high/">best ratings</a> in over two decades thanks to the tireless work of the cast and crew, attention-grabbing guest star turns from the likes of Alec Baldwin and Melissa McCarthy, and a relentless hounding of Donald Trump. (You know, give or take that one time they <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170227011636/http://gothamist.com/2015/11/08/donald_trump_snl_terrible_terrible_terrible.php#photo-1">had him on the show</a> during the build-up to the election, but I guess we all are kind of ready to forgive them for that, considering how much they&apos;ve reset themselves as an adversarial satirical force against Trump, and how much even their most mild sketches seem to get <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170227011636/http://gothamist.com/2017/01/27/donald_trump_snl_2.php">under the skin</a> of the 45th president; it would have been better if the show, and particularly Lorne Michaels, publicly acknowledged that having Trump on was a huge mistake, but since when has Michaels apologized for anything, especially an episode that despite being god-awful remains a <em>memorable</em> one people still talk about&#x2014;as has been repeated way too much since Trump was elected, comedy isn&apos;t going to save us, but if it pisses off the commander-in-chief enough that his aides have to hide the remote from him lest he turn the TV on and see Kate McKinnon as gremlin Jeff Sessions, then that&apos;s at least something of a corrective. In lieu of SNL being granted special powers to bring impeachment charges against the president, we&apos;ll settle for them being able to piss him off on a regular basis).</p>

<p>Oh, you&apos;re still here! In that case, SNL announced that Octavia Spencer will host when the show returns on March 4th, with musical guest Father John Misty. Then on March 11th, Scarlett Johansson will host for a fifth time, with musical guest Lorde.</p>

<p>As an aside, Father John Misty has a verbose new album coming out in April, <em>Pure Comedy</em>, that seemingly takes his ironic/genuine hipster doofus persona as far as it could possibly go. It&apos;s pretty good stuff, especially if you like Elton John music and lines like, &quot;bedding Taylor Swift every night inside the Oculus Rift.&quot; (And yes, that is the first line of the second song on the album.) Anyway, apropos of that, here is my favorite tweet about FJM.</p>
