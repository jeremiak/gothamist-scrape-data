<p>This week, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150523014139/http://schomburgcenter.tumblr.com/post/49864401842/does-the-man-on-the-right-remind-you-of-someone">The Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture at the New York Public Library posted</a> a photo of a man in Harlem in 1933 that they think bears a striking resemblance to Jay-Z. And now, everyone from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150523014139/http://www.buzzfeed.com/desusnice/jay-z-the-time-traveler-a3hy">Buzzfeed</a> to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150523014139/http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/gossip/jay-z-look-alike-discovered-1933-photograph-article-1.1339258">Daily News</a> to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150523014139/http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/1e0214/is_jayz_a_time_traveler_this_photo_from_the_new/">Reddit</a> has embraced time travelling Jay-Z. </p>

Is Jay-Z a time traveller, or is everyone just being kinda racist today without realizing it? Thank god there&apos;s one Superman-obsessed man who can give us an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150523014139/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/nicolas-cage-vampire-letterman-ghost-rider-289323">accurate first person account</a> of  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150523014139/http://www.buzzfeed.com/babymantis/nicolas-cage-is-a-time-traveler-1opu">the last 200 years or so.</a></p>
