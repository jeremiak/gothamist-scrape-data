<p>An MTA worker <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507223542/http://www.westsiderag.com/2012/07/11/breaking-mta-worker-injured-after-contact-with-third-rail-at-72nd-street">was badly burned</a> by the third rail yesterday, temporarily shutting down service on the 1/2/3. The incident happened just after 8 p.m. Wednesday, as the signal mechanic was working near the W. 72nd Street station. &#x201C;There was a spark, kind of like a firecracker,&#x201D; straphanger Stephen Wolf, who saw the sparks while on a northbound train, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507223542/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/signal-worker-burned-rail-manhattan-subway-tunnel-article-1.1112618?localLinksEnabled=false">told the Daily News</a>. &#x201C;Then there was a bigger set of sparks, then a bang near the door&#x2014;a couple people jumped pretty high.&#x201D;</p>

<p>The worker was rushed to New York Presbyterian-Weill Cornell Medical Center, and treated for second and third-degree burns; police said his injuries were serious, but not life threatening. All 1/2/3 train service was temporarily suspended between 42nd and 96th Streets&#x2014;service was finally restarted around 9:30 p.m. NY Times reporters Mike Grynbaum pointed out that since Fastrack work was happening on the A/C/E, the accident exposed a hole in the service coverage plan: </p>

No real contingency if 1/2/3 has problems, like tonight.</p>&#x2014; Mike Grynbaum (@grynbaum) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507223542/https://twitter.com/grynbaum/status/223248583858728960" data-datetime="2012-07-12T02:53:04+00:00">July 12, 2012</a></blockquote>
