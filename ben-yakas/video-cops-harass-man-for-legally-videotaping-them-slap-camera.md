<p><strong>[Update Below]</strong> It is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150223101755/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/21/psa_it_is_100_legal_to_film_the_pol.php">100% legal to film anyone</a>&#x2014;including police officers&#x2014;in public places. And it is also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150223101755/http://www.aclu.org/free-speech/know-your-rights-photographers">100% legal to film them in MTA stations,</a> as long as you&apos;re not interfering with any law enforcement activity. Robert Strype certainly wasn&apos;t interfering when he started filming two MTA cops kicking an old homeless man out of the 125th Street Metro North station on Friday morning around 8 a.m. &quot;I was up on the balcony at the station and I started filming what they were doing and that is where the video starts,&quot; he told us. &quot;I was asked ridiculous questions and one of the cops swiped at my phone at one point.&quot;</p>

<p>As you can see in the video, Strype didn&apos;t say anything to the cops until they called him over and proceeded to grill him over whether he had a train ticket. &quot;The bald cop was a jerk, he the one who initially waved at the camera and then smacked at it,&quot; Stryper said. The bald cop clearly smacks the camera around the 1:25 mark, saying, &quot;Get that shit off of my face.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;The other cop seemed to be getting off on his authority, he was the one who initiated contact and lectured at me,&quot; Strype added. That officer never directly says that Strype was doing anything illegal, but after his lecture, he refers to the videotaping as &quot;extra and unwarranted in my opinion,&quot; and recommends Strype wait upstairs at the outdoor platform for his train. </p>

<p>We&apos;ve contacted the MTA for comment. &quot;I found the entire ordeal to be ridiculous,&quot; Strype told us. &quot;I was not interfering with them in any way. I was up on a balcony and i did not say a word.&quot; At least Strype wasn&apos;t <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150223101755/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/16/video_bronx_man_hauled_to_jail_for.php">handcuffed and taken to a jail cell for his non-offense.</a></p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: We spoke to Metro North spokeswoman Marjorie Anders about the incident, and she offered this comment: &quot;Friday was a very special day. Tensions were high on all parts, in all areas of the nation. Everyone was on edge. No harm done on a very, very weird day in the nation. &quot;</p>
