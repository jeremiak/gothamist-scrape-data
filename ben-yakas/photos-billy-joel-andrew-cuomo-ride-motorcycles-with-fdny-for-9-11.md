<p>Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Billy Joel led a procession of FDNY members for a 9/11 memorial motorcycle ride to Ground Zero this morning. The group gathered at Rescue 1 firehouse on West 43rd Street and then headed down the West Side Highway to attend the 9/11 memorial ceremonies. Cuomo rode a black Harley-Davidson, while Joel was on a blue-and-white Drifter. &quot;They invited me to be in the motorcycle ride. It&apos;s an honor,&quot; Joel <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150916053604/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/gov-cuomo-billy-joel-lead-9-11-motorcycle-ride-article-1.1451965">told the Daily News</a>. &quot;I was at Ground Zero a few days after 9/11 and it was the worst thing I ever saw in my life. To be asked to do this is very moving.&quot;</p>
