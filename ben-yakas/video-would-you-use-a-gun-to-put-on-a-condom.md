<p>Last month, The Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130517071711/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/21/early_addition_1229.php">issued a challenge</a>: anyone who can come up with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130517071711/http://www.grandchallenges.org/Explorations/Topics/Pages/NextGenerationCondomRound11.aspx">a &quot;transformative idea&quot;</a> to reinvent the condom (that &quot;significantly preserves or enhances pleasure, in order to improve uptake and regular use&quot;) will get $100,000 grant. While our own submission, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130517071711/http://www.maxilyrics.com/busta-rhymes-gimme-some-more-(dirty-version)-lyrics-7597.html">&quot;The Busta Rhymes Proposal,&quot;</a> didn&apos;t really go anywhere, the folks over at the Slingshot Channel have come up with their own (terrifying) device: the Condom Applicator Slingshot Gun. </p>

<p>&quot;Nothing fasincates male human beings more than guns and sex,&quot; says inventor Joerg Sprave. &quot;So when we combine both, you must see the huge potential this has.&quot; Yes, it has potential&#x2014;the potential to terrify any male who comes in contact with the device. It helps somewhat that Sprave keeps giggling at the invention, although as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130517071711/http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/1bulwf/my_favorite_response_to_bill_gates_condom/">one Redditor put it</a>, &quot;This guy would make a great Bond villain.&quot;</p>

<p>This also isn&apos;t the first time that Sprave has had some fun with those D.I.L.D.O.s. Below, watch as he tries out his &quot;Launcher of Love.&quot; </p>
