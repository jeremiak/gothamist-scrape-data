</div></div>					<p>Over the weekend, we learned a  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150808124245/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/20/what_are_your_ideas_for_an_nypd_mas.php">bit about Pipo-kun</a>, the official mascot for the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department, who shows up at any Tokyo police event and has become synonymous with their officers. So <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150808124245/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/20/what_are_your_ideas_for_an_nypd_mas.php">we asked you</a> what your ideas were for a NYPD mascot&#x2014;some of you suggested subway rats, &quot;an overweight tribal tattoo with a mustache&quot;, an &quot;anally inserted billy club,&quot; or something &quot;riding a bicycle.&quot; But above, you can see some of  the illustrated results, including Officer Bully, Texty the Traffic Pigeon, and more!</p>
