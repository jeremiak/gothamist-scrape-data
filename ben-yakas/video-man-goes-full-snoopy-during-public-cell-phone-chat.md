                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="9213cellphone.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20131006180824im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/9213cellphone.jpg" width="640" height="425" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>There are originals, there are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131006180824/http://www.cwtv.com/shows/the-originals">CW Originals</a>, and then there is this gentleman in the video below, who is a true original, a pioneering original, and an original maverick. Having said that, he&apos;s also not original, because he&apos;s blatantly ripping off <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131006180824/http://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=http://www.serenityhealth.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/830434-snoopy_large.jpg&amp;imgrefurl=http://www.serenityhealth.com/blog/build-dog-snoopy-dog-house/&amp;h=300&amp;w=300&amp;sz=7&amp;tbnid=86swAgAPuY97KM:&amp;tbnh=90&amp;tbnw=90&amp;zoom=1&amp;usg=__mbVN7BdWT7qF5LBY02srHzKVG1Y=&amp;docid=UyhZDfjXGonpeM&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=q90kUvbpGMXcsATBnIHQBg&amp;ved=0CC0Q9QEwAA&amp;dur=980">Snoopy&apos;s style</a>, but at least he&apos;s taking Snoopy&apos;s vibe and pushing it in a wondrous new direction. If Snoopying becomes the next Planking, you can thank this man.</p>
