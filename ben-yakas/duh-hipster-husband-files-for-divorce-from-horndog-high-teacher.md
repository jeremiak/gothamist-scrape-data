At the time, Sayar&apos;s 40-year-old husband Jimmy Lathrop <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428161135/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/03/horndog_teacher_with_the_mermaid_ta.php">denied reports</a> that he was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428161135/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/02/horndog_high_teacher_goes_on_offens.php">looking to divorce her</a>&#x2014;but it was just a matter of time, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428161135/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/from_bed_to_worse_QZgT0proK4hUYRlg0b9vdM?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Brooklyn">as the Post points out</a> today that Lathrop finally filed for divorce in January.</p>

<p>&#x201C;Mr. Lathrop has full confidence in the judicial system, and hopes for a speedy resolution of his divorce as he moves on with his life,&#x201D; said Lathrop&#x2019;s attorney, Todd Spodek. Sayar refused to talk about it, telling the Post, &#x201C;My husband&#x2019;s name is still on the lease here. We share a beautiful daughter together.&quot; Lathrop has reportedly already moved out of the couple&apos;s Park Slope home; a source told the Post a major reason he wants the divorce is because he&apos;s worried that if she pleads or is found guilty, she&#x2019;ll be branded a sex offender, limiting the activities she can do with their young daughter.</p>

<p>Sayar and then 16-year-old Kevin Eng <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428161135/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/31/married_teacher_taught_student_abou.php">allegedly exchanged</a> 3,856 text messages over a 17-day period in 2011; Eng admitted he had sex with Sayar eight to 12 times, including some late night SUV sexcapades and sex during school when she was supposed to be tutoring him. They were round out after Eng&apos;s girlfriend got suspicious, hacked into this Facebook account, and found messages such as, &#x201C;I love you so much&#x201D; and &#x201C;I always loved you, since last year.&#x201D; Eng&apos;s mother has since sued the city and teacher <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428161135/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/18/mom_sues_city_10_million_after_her.php">for $10 million dollars.</a></p>
