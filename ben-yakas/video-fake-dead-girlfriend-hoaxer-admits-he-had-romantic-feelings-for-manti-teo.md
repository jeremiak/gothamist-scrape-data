<p>Last week, we all enjoyed a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427162101/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/24/live_blog_katie_couric_interviews_m.php">riveting afternoon interview</a> between Katie Couric and Notre Dame football star <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427162101/http://gothamist.com/tags/mantiteo">Manti Te&apos;o</a> about his fake dead girlfriend scandal&#x2014;and this week we get to do it all over again, except with Dr. Phil and admitted hoaxer Ronaiah Tuiasosopo. The first half of the exclusive interview with air tomorrow, but Dr. Phil gave the Today Show some sneak peeks (which you can watch below). Suffice to say, while Te&apos;o is &quot;faaaaar&quot; from gay, Tuiasosopo definitely had some complicated feelings for Te&apos;o.</p>

<p>&quot;Here we have a young man that fell deeply, romantically in love,&quot; Dr. Phil told NBC. &quot;I asked him straight up, &apos;Was this a romantic relationship with you?&apos; And he says yes.<strong> I said, &apos;Are you then therefore gay?&apos; And he said, &apos;When you put it that way, yes.&apos; And then he caught himself and said &apos;I am confused.&apos; &quot;</strong> Welcome to the club Ronaiah&#x2014;we&apos;re all very confused about every facet of this increasingly convoluted story.</p>

<p>Yet again, Tuiasosopo will take full responsibility for the hoax in the interview, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427162101/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/24/manti_teo_hoaxer_admits_he_called_t.php">as he did last week</a>&#x2014;that means he&apos;ll once again claim he was the one posing as fake dead &quot;girlfriend&quot; Lennay Kekua on the telephone during all their late-night calls. Of course, after voicemails from Kekua were played on Couric&apos;s show, one of Tuiasosopo&apos;s cousins <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427162101/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/25/manti_teo_hoaxers_female_cousin_may.php">claimed someone else was in</a> on the hoax: &#x201C;There is no doubt whatsoever that it&#x2019;s Tino [Tuiasosopo].&quot;</p>

<p>Te&#x2019;o had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427162101/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/24/live_blog_katie_couric_interviews_m.php">told Couric that</a> he always thought the voice he heard as Kekua was a woman. &#x201C;Well, it didn&#x2019;t sound like a man. It sounded like a woman,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;If he somehow made that voice, that&#x2019;s incredible, that&#x2019;s an incredible talent to do that. Especially every single day.&quot;</p>

<p>Dr. Phil added that Te&apos;o &quot;absolutely, unequivocally&quot; wasn&apos;t involved in the hoax. As for why this whole cockamamie mess happened, Dr. Phil teased, &quot;Ronaiah had a number of life experiences that damaged this young man in some very serious ways.&quot; But if you want to find out more, you&apos;re going to have to tune in for what is bound to be, at best, a thoroughly depressing exploration of one sad man&apos;s messed up life!</p>
