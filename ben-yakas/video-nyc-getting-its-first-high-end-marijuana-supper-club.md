<p>Now that we&apos;ve spent some time getting all <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504132720/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/24/heres_what_it_looked_like_when_mari.php#photo-1">nostalgic for the days when marijuana grew out of the ground in Brooklyn</a>, it&apos;s time to start living in the present again. Sure, the governor has been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504132720/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/07/sorry_cuomo_doesnt_care_about_marij.php">a major disappointment on the issue</a> and the president <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504132720/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/19/president_obama_marijuana_is_not_mo.php">is scared of rocking the boat</a>, but the country on the whole is becoming more progressive about pot, and lots of folks are trying to show that it&apos;s not just some <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504132720/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/03/david_brooks_smoking_pot.php">goofy juvenile experiment you outgrow.</a> To that end, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504132720/http://ny.eater.com/archives/2014/01/marijuana_supper_club_new_york_.php">Eater reports that</a> NYC is getting its first fine dining marijuana supper club.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504132720/http://www.sinsemil.la/">According to their website</a>, Sinsemil.la was founded un NYC: &quot;Marijuana varietals are tested not just for their organic qualities, but specifically to balance the flavors of each dish and for their psychoactive properties throughout the flow of the dinner. Sinsemil.la isn&apos;t about getting high&#x2014;it is about haute cuisine.&quot; </p>

<p>Sinsemil.la joins a long line of classy supper clubs around the city, including <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504132720/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/11/inside_bishops_barons_a_new_supper.php#photo-1">Bishops &amp; Barons</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504132720/http://gothamist.com/2013/12/08/photos_sleep_no_more_now_has_a_magi.php#photo-1">Sleep No More</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504132720/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/23/inside_ginnys_supper_club_the_gorge.php#photo-1">Ginny&apos;s Supper Club</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504132720/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/03/sushi_supper_club_brooklyn_oenology.php">Mayanoki Sushi Supper Club.</a></p>

<p>In the video above, you can see glimpses of the nine items on their tantalizing spring tasting menu, including cold-smoked Peconic Bay scallop crudo with chorizo, Og Kush oil, fresh coriander and lemon; potato gnocchi with White Widow buttered wild mushrooms and fresh Diesel; confit chicken wings and frisee salad with Mango Kush croutons and smoked Niman Ranch bacon; and pasture-raised pork schnitzel with overwintered vegetables and Og Kush butter. </p>

<p>Just typing that out is making us very hungry. If it&apos;s 5 o&apos;clock somewhere, then it&apos;s gotta be 4:20 right now, right?</p>
