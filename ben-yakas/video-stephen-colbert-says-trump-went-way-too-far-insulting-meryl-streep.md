<p>All the major late night hosts are pretty disparate in style and substance (well, with a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170914133056/http://time.com/4033750/vanity-fair-late-night-tv/">few notable exceptions</a>), but there is one thing that can unite them all: Donald Trump attacking Meryl Streep. Seth Meyers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170914133056/http://gothamist.com/2017/01/10/seth_meyers_trump_look.php">called Trump</a> the &quot;Meryl Streep of having thin skin&quot; after Trump responded to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170914133056/http://laist.com/2017/01/08/meryl_globes.php">actor&apos;s thoughtful critique</a> at the Golden Globes with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170914133056/http://laist.com/2017/01/09/trump_reacts_to_meryl_streep_speech.php">Twitter vitriol</a>. </p>

<p>Stephen Colbert went one further, dedicating his monologue to defending Streep: &quot;Look, Mr. Trump, you can refuse to release your taxes. You can call to ban an entire religion. You can play footsie with a dictator. But calling Meryl Streep overrated? No! Too far. You know, I wasn&apos;t going to go to that million woman march, but now I am... It&apos;s going to be a million Meryl march.&quot;</p>

<p>Ben Affleck and Jimmy Kimmel got into it as well: &quot;If there&apos;s one thing truly in the world that we know is not true, it&apos;s that Meryl Streep is overrated...It&apos;s like, &apos;Ghandi: terrible leader!&apos;&quot;</p>

<p>Even James Corden took a break from carpool karaoke to cover Streepgate: &quot;This was actually good news for Meryl because &apos;Most Overrated Actress in Hollywood&apos; was literally the only award she hadn&apos;t won yet,&quot; he said. &quot;I guess if you want to see real acting, just watch the Republican Congress as they pretend that everything&apos;s going to be okay for the next four years.&quot;</p>
