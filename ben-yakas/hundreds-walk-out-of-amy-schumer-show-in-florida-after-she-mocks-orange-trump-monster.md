<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161113153433/http://gothamist.com/tags/amyschumer">Amy Schumer</a> has kept her politics pretty close to the chest during this election season, barely taking <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161113153433/https://www.instagram.com/p/BLpGPpkDJZB/">any time out</a> of her busy schedule of book appearances, stand-up tours and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161113153433/https://twitter.com/amyschumer/status/780864697071316992">voter registration events</a> to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161113153433/http://www.salon.com/2016/05/13/watch_amy_schumer_proclaim_her_undying_love_for_hillary_clinton_in_120_hilarious_seconds/">proclaim her undying love</a> for Hillary Clinton. What does she <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161113153433/https://www.bustle.com/articles/151099-amy-schumer-officially-endorses-hillary-clinton-uses-the-perfect-bambi-quote-for-the-occassion">really think</a>?!? What is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161113153433/http://www.cbsnews.com/pictures/celebrities-who-support-hillary-clinton-election-2016/8/">she hiding</a>?!? So it came as a complete shock&#x2014;nay, a monocle-shattering shock!&#x2014;to a Florida audience this weekend when Schumer decried Donald Trump as, among other things, an &quot;orange, sexual-assaulting, fake-college-starting monster.&quot; </p>

<p>Around 200 fans walked out of Schumer&apos;s show at the Amalie Arena in Tampa on Sunday after she started making fun of Trump. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161113153433/http://www.tampabay.com/blogs/the-buzz-florida-politics/trump-fans-boo-walk-out-on-amy-schumer-in-tampa/2298412">Tampa Bay Times reports:</a></p>

<blockquote>She made it clear she doesn&apos;t understand how people can support Trump. At one point, she asked for a Trump supporter - preferably one with sleeves, she told security personnel - to join her up on stage to explain their enthusiasm for Trump. One fellow did, but he said he was voting for Trump mainly because he doesn&apos;t trust Clinton. When some audience members booed, the actor/comedian invited them to leave and also asked security to remove anyone booing.

<p>&quot;I don&apos;t want to hear that. We wanted to have a good night without distractions with the politics,&quot; said Bryon Nfinger.</p>

<p>&quot;It&apos;s a bit much,&quot; echoed his wife, Chrissy Nfinger. </p>

<p>They both said everybody has a right to their opinion but thought Schumer went on too long. </p>

<p>&quot;The show became political. I definitely didn&apos;t come to hear this,&quot; said Ryan Atwood.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>For <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161113153433/http://www.tampabay.com/blogs/soundcheck/review-amy-schumer-gets-raunchy-blasts-donald-trump-at-tampas-amalie-arena/2298417">some perspective</a>: only a handful of comedians have ever headlined Amalie Arena, and Schumer was the first woman to do so. Also, there were more than 10,000 people there, so 200 butthurt apples seems pretty decent for Florida. And Schumer showed lots of love fo the city during the set: &quot;Please don&#x2019;t get it twisted: I fucking love Tampa, okay? I do. That&#x2019;s the truth. It is the only place I&#x2019;ve ever had a one-night stand. And so it is forever in my heart as an amazing city.&quot;</p>

<p>Plenty of people were impressed with her set as well, especially a moment when she reflected on coming forward as a sexual assault victim and asked other women to standup if they were as well.</p>

<p>Maybe one day Amy Schumer will make her political views clear so that fans will never be so ambushed like that again.</p>
