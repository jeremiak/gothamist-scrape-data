<p>A Queens man has been arrested after he allegedly threatened to blow up multiple police stations&#x2014;and all because he was upset over being written up for a summons, which in NYC is like being upset over excess air conditioner liquid dropping on your head. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140630192247/http://www.newsday.com/long-island/nassau/richard-bolton-of-queens-threatened-to-blow-up-nassau-nyc-police-precincts-cops-say-1.8598864">Police say that</a> Richard Bolton, 30, called 911 at 3:20 a.m. Friday and said he was on 165th Street in Jamaica and had a bomb strapped to him. He claimed he was going to blow up a nearby police precinct, then head to Nassau County and blow up some more, all because he had been written up for a summons. It&apos;s not clear what he was written up for, though presumably it was less serious than threatening to blow up the NYPD, so perhaps Bolton did not think this one out.</p>

<p>It turned out Bolton was actually at his home in Queens Village when he called, and police arrested him a short time later. He has been charged with making a terroristic threat. He has not been charged with extreme dumbassery, but that&apos;s only because that is not a real charge.</p>
