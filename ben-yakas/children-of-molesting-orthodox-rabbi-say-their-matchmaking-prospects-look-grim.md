The children of convicted grabby-hands Rabbi Gavriel Bidany <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150418214011/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2011/05/12/2011-05-12_lock_up_dad__we_cant_be_wed_rabbis_kids_cry.html">pleaded with the court</a> for leniency for their father, who faces up to six months in prison, because it hurts their chances to get married: <strong>&quot;Today I am 21 and I need to start my own family...and without my dad it is impossible. It would hurt my match-making possibilities,</strong>&quot; said Avishar Bidany. <p></p>

<p>Rabbi Bidany was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150418214011/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/05/rabbi_guilty_of_molesting_woman_on.php">found guilty</a> last week of groping a female Israel Defense Forces officer while on a trans-Atlantic flight <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150418214011/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/14/unkosher_love_rabbi_arrested_for_in.php">in March</a>; he had claimed that his hands were moving involuntarily while he slept. One of his daughters argued that without Rabbi Bidany, a 48-year-old marriage counselor who has 11 offspring altogether, she would have a very hard time finding a husband: &quot;I am begging you your honor, I have reached an age (22) where I need to find a groom and start a family. And without my father it is very difficult. This could harm my matchmaking process -- starting a home. My whole future depends on it,&quot; wrote Eden Bidany.</p>

<p>Her brother, Ariel, offered a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150418214011/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/bride_and_oy_iOm0zz0ID12O87XsxH0HPL?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">very similar plea</a>: &quot;Have pity on me. I have reached the age of 21, and need to find a bride, get married and have a family. When my father is not with me, it is going to be very hard and would hurt my matchmaking. I would like to get married properly with my father at my side please.&quot;</p>

<p>Bidany&apos;s children&apos;s words may have helped a little: He <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150418214011/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/bronx/rabbi_gets_days_in_prison_for_trans_W0EMRbzjA59ryzcvqRTu1K">was sentenced</a> to serve 60 days in a federal prison for groping the female passenger. Magistrate Judge Ramon Reyes, Jr. told the Brooklyn federal court that he had testified falsely, and added: &quot;Rabbi Bidany committed a serious crime...and such conduct cannot be tolerated.&quot;</p>
