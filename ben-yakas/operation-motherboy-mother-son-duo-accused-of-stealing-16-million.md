Prosecutors say that bookkeeper Judy Del Galdo embezzled the money from her employers at Hi-Fashion Fabrics, Inc. and Timeless Treasures Fabrics, Inc., in order to maintain a lavish lifestyle for her and her son Joseph, which included yachting, jetting, and cruising in a $127,000 Mercedes.</p>

<p>The 66-year-old mother, who worked at the two companies for over 22 years, forged the companies&apos; president&apos;s signature on hundreds of checks <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629085406/http://www.dnainfo.com/20110624/greenwich-village-soho/mother-son-allegedly-stole-16m-from-soho-fabric-shop">over the last seven years</a>; those checks were deposited into a bank account in the name of a dummy company called &quot;Tea-Rific Beverage, Inc.&quot; Joseph was the sole signatory on the account, according to the indictment. In addition to the extravagances such as three homes and a Mercedes, the pair also used the money to fund Joseph&apos;s ambulance company. Prosecutors revealed a thorough list of what they allegedly spent the embezzled money on:</p>

<ul>
	<li>$500,000 in flights on private jets</li>
	<li>$458,000 in other travel and hotel expensive</li>
	<li>$368,000 in payments toward a million dollar yacht</li>
	<li>$564,000 in credit card payments</li>
	<li>$330,000 in payments for luxury suites and sponsorships at Madison Square Garden and the Meadowlands Sports Complex</li>
	<li>$166,000 in home theater purchases</li>
	<li>$42,000 in custom tailored suits</li>
	<li>$54,000 in Apple and iTunes purchases</li>
	<li>$62,000 in private school tuition</li>
	<li>$493,000 in cash withdrawals</li>
	<li>$889,000 in mortgage and related payments on three different properties -- all now in foreclosure.</li>
	<li>$55,000 Infiniti QX56</li>
</ul>

<p>The two companies, which are owned by the same family, so trusted Del Galdo that they only noticed the discrepancies in the books a few months after she had retired. Del Galdo&apos;s lawyer said the pair had already started paying back the company: &quot;We gave them everything -- cars, houses, memorabilia, jewelry, money, the proceeds from the ambulance company.&quot; The lawyer was also concerned about Del Galdo not receiving her Xanax prescription, although there was no mention about her missing this year&apos;s motherboy contest:</p>
