<p>Mayor Bloomberg and Schools Chancellor Dennis Walcott <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111119230324/http://www.ny1.com/content/top_stories/151019/school-bus-driver-strike-may-be-looming--city-says">warned today that the city</a> is facing &#x201C;strong possibility&#x201D; of a school bus strike next week, one which Bloomberg says would result in &quot;chaos.&quot; Local 1181 of the Amalgamated Transit Union is threatening to strike over the city&apos;s plan to ask for bids for service to transport special education pre-kindergarten children for next school year. &#x201C;So the union is threatening an illegal strike that would harm the education of more than 152,000 students if it doesn&#x2019;t get its way. And that&#x2019;s just outrageous,&#x201D; Bloomberg <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111119230324/http://www.mikebloomberg.com/index.cfm?objectid=B80202CC-C29C-7CA2-FFE1AE691E6424E8">said at City Hall earlier.</a></p>

<p>Bloomberg said the strike seems imminent, but stressed that what the union is seeking is illegal: &#x201C;The union representing school bus drivers is seeking something that we are not legally allowed to offer: Job guarantees for certain current drivers. The highest court in New York State has ruled unambiguously that the law doesn&#x2019;t allow that. The law mandates that we seek bids from bus companies in a competitive fashion; it prohibits us from doing what the union wants.&quot; You can read Bloomberg&apos;s whole speech, including what parents should do should a strike occur, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111119230324/http://www.mikebloomberg.com/index.cfm?objectid=B80202CC-C29C-7CA2-FFE1AE691E6424E8">here.</a></p>

<p>Union president Michael Cordiello <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111119230324/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/education/school-bus-union-local-1181-threatens-strike-mayor-bloomberg-chaos-article-1.979743">told the News that</a> the strike could happen any time: &quot;In a time when the economy is failing and people need to be in work, this is all about protecting jobs.&quot; Walcott sent out a letter to parents (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111119230324/http://content.ny1.com/downloads/Chancellor_Letter_Bus.pdf">read it here</a>) saying the city is &quot;deeply concerned about the impact of a strike on our students and families and we want you to be prepared in the event one occurs.&quot; </p>

<p>Among those contingency plans, Walcott said the city has already purchased some 300,000 Metrocards which will be distributed to students who now take a yellow bus from a bus stop to school. In addition, students who have to take a car or taxi to school will be reimbursed for the cost; field trips will be canceled for schools affected; and lateness and absence due to a strike will be excused. </p>
