<p>A man has been arrested for allegedly secretly filming a woman who was masturbating in her Williamsburg apartment. According to police, Gabriel Carbona was arrested around 11:30 p.m. Wednesday at the elevated Marcy Avenue J train platform after he allegedly was caught using his cell phone to record a woman masturbating in her apartment. &quot;It&apos;s horrible. It&apos;s creepy and it&apos;s nasty,&quot; the 29-year-old victim <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203054548/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/train_peeper_arrest_MDzvovYeUToWcP8MpNHWMP">told the Post</a>. &quot;I felt really safe in that neighborhood, but now that this happened I don&apos;t feel safe.&quot;</p>

<p>Cardona allegedly told cops he wasn&apos;t some sort of peeping Tom on the prowl&#x2014;rather, he was an innocent browsing Tom who came upon a masturbating women in the wilds of Brooklyn (albeit in her own home): &quot;Cardona told cops, &apos;I was not going to put the video on YouTube. It was a thrill for me and I was going to show it to my girlfriend,&apos;&quot; a law-enforcement source told the Post.</p>

<p>Police added that Carbona has been charged with unlawful surveillance. Now if he had claimed he was taking artsy photos rather than video, he might not be in so much trouble, as a Manhattan Supreme Court Justice ruled this week that a photographer who took a series of surreptitious photos of his neighbors and exhibited them in a gallery <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203054548/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/09/peeping_tom_photography_totally_leg.php">had every legal right to do so.</a></p>
