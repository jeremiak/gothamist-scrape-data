<p>On the first Monday of the month, culinary collective <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160115044949/http://www.arazorashinyknife.com/">A Razor, A Shiny Knife</a> staged a guerrilla six course lunch on the L train, which sounded pretty delicious <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160115044949/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/02/l_train_six_course_gourmet_lunch_f.php">to us</a>, kind of annoying to some of you, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160115044949/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/04/dining/04train.html">rather impressive</a> to the NY Times. Now, the group has released a video of the subway d&apos;h&#xF4;te, taken by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160115044949/http://studiofeast.com/2011/05/06/video-the-l-train-lunch/">one food blogger</a> who &quot;wore a camera mounted to a headband for the entire platform plating &amp; train car service.&quot; </p>

<p>Even though most of our readers believe eating on the subway <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160115044949/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/22/should_eating_on_the_subway_be_outl.php">should be made illegal</a>, all the unsuspecting riders who took part in this event look like they had a pretty great time. Of course, no <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160115044949/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/18/video_subway_spaghetti_spat_sparks.php">spaghetti was involved</a> with this meal. </p>
