<p>Like many Americans, Miley Cyrus can&apos;t stand <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171030064816/http://gothamist.com/tags/woodyallen">Woody Allen</a>&#x2014;or at least &quot;everything he stands for&quot;&#x2014;in the first trailer for Allen&apos;s upcoming Amazon series, <em>Crisis In Six Scenes</em>. </p>

<p>The comedy, which takes place during the turbulent 1960s, revolves around a middle class suburban family who is &quot;visited by a guest who turns their household completely upside down.&quot; In addition to Allen and Cyrus, the show stars Elaine May, Rachel Brosnahan and John Magaro. The six episode, one season (Allen has vowed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171030064816/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/woody-allen-interview-he-wont-889678">not to do another TV show again</a>) show premieres September 30th. </p>

<p>&quot;Hopefully people will find it amusing,&quot; Allen said of the show in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171030064816/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/woody-allen-interview-he-wont-889678">an interview</a> earlier this summer. &quot;It&apos;s not going to start any new religions, I can tell you that.&quot; With expectations sufficiently tamed, let&apos;s hope this is more of a <em>Radio Days/Sweet &amp; Lowdown</em> kind of period piece, rather than a <em>Magic in the Moonlight</em>.</p>
