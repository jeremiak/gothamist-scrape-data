title: Caption It: Bloomberg Sends Entourage DVDs To Vets

										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none" style=" width:640px; "> <img alt="2411bloomtourage.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20151109010641im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/2411bloomtourage.jpg" width="640" height="427"> <br> <i><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151109010641/http://www.flickr.com/photos/nycmayorsoffice/5413451189/">nycmayorsoffice</a></i></div> <p></p>

<p>As part of his AFC Championship Jets/Steelers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151109010641/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/21/bloomberg_announces_jetssteelers_be.php">bet</a> with Pittsburgh Mayor Luke Ravenstahl, Mayor Bloomberg agreed to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151109010641/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/03/mike_makes_good_on_bet_desecrates_r.php">hoist</a> the Steelers&apos; &quot;Terrible Towel&quot; on a NYC landmark, and assemble care packages for soldiers who are back from overseas, while wearing a Steelers jersey. And the Mayor did so <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151109010641/http://origin.nydailynews.com/blogs/dailypolitics/2011/02/terrible-towel-rises-over-nyc">yesterday</a>, donning a black Hines Ward uniform while putting the packages together...then we noticed what he was packaging: season six DVDs of <em>Entourage</em>. </p>

<p>While we obviously support the Mayor&apos;s work for veterans, there&apos;s something undeniably odd about him in his ill-fitting Steelers jersey, gift wrapping the coke-fueled exploits of Vince Chase and Johnny Drama for recently returned soldiers. What would you caption the photo?</p>
