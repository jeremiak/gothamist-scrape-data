<p>After Gov. Cuomo said that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140226195630/http://blog.timesunion.com/capitol/archives/203801/cuomo-extreme-conservatives-have-no-place-in-the-state-of-new-york/">&quot;extreme conservatives...have no place in the state of New York, because that&#x2019;s not who New Yorkers are,&quot;</a> textbook extreme conservative Glenn Beck went on a tirade against Cuomo. First he wrote <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140226195630/http://www.theblaze.com/contributions/gov-cuomo-are-we-welcome-in-new-york/">an open letter to the governor implying he&apos;s a tyrant; then </a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140226195630/http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2014/01/21/watch-glenn-becks-takedown-of-ny-gov-cuomo-plus-he-tells-megyn-kelly-his-biggest-regret-from-his-time-at-fox-news/">on &quot;The Kelly File,&quot;</a> he compared Cuomo to the former governor of Alabama who sought to delay the civil rights movement. All in all, pretty normal, extremist Glenn Beck stuff&#x2014;except Beck <em>also</em> had a rare moment of clarity while reflecting back on his own history at Fox News: <strong>&quot;I think I played a role, unfortunately, in helping tear the country apart.&quot; </strong></p>

<p>&quot;I remember it as an awful lot of fun and that I made an awful lot of mistakes, and I wish I could go back and be more uniting in my language,&quot; he said soberly. &quot;I didn&#x2019;t realize how really fragile the people were, I thought we were kind of more in it together. Now I look back and I realize if we could have talked about the uniting principles a little more instead of the problems, I think I would look back on it a little more fondly. But that&#x2019;s only my role.&quot;</p>

<p>As refreshing and un-Beckian as this is, let&apos;s all keep in mind that just two months ago <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140226195630/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/07/glenn_beck_urges_ny_state_to_secede.php">Beck was urging NY state to secede from NYC</a> because our new socialist mayor is going to turn the city into Detroit. Between that and his comparison of extreme conservatism to the Civil Rights Movement (SERIOUSLY), we can all sleep soundly tonight knowing that Beck has not become fully self-aware just yet.</p>

<p>Speaking of totally reasonable, Beck went on a slightly different tirade this morning, arguing that by trying to stop the teaching of creationism as science, Bill Nye is acting just like the Catholic Church when they imprisoned Galileo for denying that the Earth was not the center of the universe. You can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140226195630/http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2014/01/22/glenn-beck-bill-nyes-creationism-denial-is-like-the-catholic-church-jailing-galileo/">read more about that here</a>, or you could <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140226195630/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ke-_nKHpDs">watch Axl Rose ask for some reggae</a>. Spoiler alert: as always, Axl is less of a waste of time.</p>
