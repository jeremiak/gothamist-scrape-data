<p>Have you started freaking out about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170420192418/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/25/big_weather.php">the hybrid hurricane/winter storm that is due to hit the city this weekend</a> (during a full moon no less)? Because the MTA is already getting prepared! &#x201C;The planning has started,&#x201D; MTA Chairman Joseph Lhota <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170420192418/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/mta_plans_for_hurricane_sandy_VNfHgOj185xfy0rQ6ACV0H">said during an interview</a> on WNYC, noting he already has had two MTA meetings about the upcoming storm. But if you think the MTA is getting hot-to-trot, just check out <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170420192418/http://www.hpc.ncep.noaa.gov/discussions/hpcdiscussions.php?disc=pmdepd">the National Weather Service&apos;s update below</a>&#x2014;you know things are getting real when they start dropping literary references all over this place.</p>

<blockquote>DESPITE A MODEST CLUSTER OF OUTLYING DETERMINISTIC SOLUTIONS AND ENSEMBLE MEMBERS FROM THE VARIOUS MODELING CENTERS, THE LION&apos;S SHARE OF GUIDANCE INDICATES THAT THE CIRCULATION ASSOCIATED WITH HURRICANE SANDY WILL PASS CLOSE ENOUGH TO THE AMPLIFYING POLAR TROUGH OVER THE EASTERN UNITED STATES TO BECOME INCORPORATED INTO A HYBRID VORTEX OVER THE MID ATLANTIC AND NORTHEAST NEXT TUESDAY.

<p>THE HIGH DEGREE OF BLOCKING FROM EASTERN NORTH AMERICA ACROSS THE ENTIRE ATLANTIC BASIN IS EXPECTED TO ALLOW THIS UNUSUAL MERGER TO TAKE PLACE, AND ONCE THE COMBINED GYRE MATERIALIZES, IT SHOULD SETTLE BACK TOWARD THE INTERIOR NORTHEAST THROUGH HALLOWEEN, <strong>INVITING PERHAPS A GHOULISH NICKNAME FOR THE CYCLONE ALONG THE LINES OF &quot;FRANKENSTORM&quot;, AN ALLUSION TO MARY SHELLEY&apos;S GOTHIC CREATURE OF SYNTHESIZED ELEMENTS</strong>.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>Invoking Mary Shelley and starting to prep subway evacuation plans&#x2014;this is making us want to haul out our <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170420192418/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/26/play_hurricane_irene_bingo_drinking.php">old Hurricane Bingo cards</a> already. Except this year, we&apos;ll have to honor Sandy by changing all the &quot;Irene&apos;s&quot; to lots of <em>Grease</em> and Bruce Springsteen references.</p>
