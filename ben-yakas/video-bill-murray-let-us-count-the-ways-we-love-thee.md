What other 59-year-old <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141224233335/http://gothamist.com/2008/12/08/bill_murray_slumming_it_at_brooklyn.php">crashes hipster house parties with MGMT</a>? Well here are two more reasons to love him: he likes to walk the streets of Williamsburg <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141224233335/http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2010/04/bill_murray.html">late at night</a>, <em>and</em> he&apos;s a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141224233335/http://www.pri.org/arts-entertainment/books/bill-murray-poet.html">&quot;frustrated&quot;</a> poet, just like us! He even dropped by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141224233335/http://www.poetshouse.org/">Poet&apos;s House</a> last year as it was being constructed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141224233335/http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2010/04/watch_as_bill_murray_reads_poe.html">to read</a> to the construction workers (you can see the video below). The only thing that could match that would be re-imaging <em>Groundhog&apos;s Day</em> as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141224233335/http://www.script-o-rama.com/movie_scripts/g/groundhog-day-script-transcript.html">an epic poem</a>.</p>
