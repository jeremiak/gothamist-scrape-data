<p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021073217/http://gothamist.com/tags/kanyewest">Kanye West</a> was supposed to play Governors Ball and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021073217/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/06/video_kanye_west_asked_de_blasio_to.php">almost-kinda played Webster Hall</a> (if you consider Kanye standing up through a sunroof and high fiving fans in the middle of 3rd Avenue for about 15 minutes an acceptable substitute for music being played, then he <em>definitely</em> put on quite the show). But as the old adage goes, Kanye taketh and Kanye giveth&#x2014;and now you&apos;ll have another chance to see him at an all-new festival popping up at Citi Field in October!</p>

<p>West will headline the inaugural Meadows Music and Arts Festival, presented by Founders Entertainment (the same organizers behind Governors Ball), on October 1st and 2nd at Citi Field and Flushing Meadows-Corona Park. In addition to West, other performers include The Weeknd, Chance The Rapper, Kygo, The 1975, Bryson Tiller, Grimes, Chromeo, Pusha T, Yeasayer and more. You can see the full lineup plus all the pricing ($230 for GA for two days, $495 for VIP for both days) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021073217/http://themeadowsnyc.com/Tickets/">here.</a></p>

<p>West is also playing two shows <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021073217/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/14/kanye_west_msg_tickets.php">on his &quot;Saint Pablo&quot; tour</a> at MSG in September, but those are mostly sold out already. &quot;The booking of Kanye West was born out of his weather related canceled appearance at Governors Ball 2016,&quot; Founders Entertainment said in a statement. &quot;[We] saw a booking for West at the new The Meadows Music and Arts Festival as a way to follow through on bringing him to New York City for his only North American festival appearance in 2016.&quot;</p>

<p>Tom Russell, one of the partners at Founders Entertainment, added: &quot;As a native New Yorker I grew up in awe of the innovative spirit surrounding Flushing Meadows-Corona Park. With this event we can shine a spotlight once again on this iconic neighborhood and bring with it the economic benefits, strong community partnerships and local hiring for which Founders Entertainment is known.&quot;<br>
