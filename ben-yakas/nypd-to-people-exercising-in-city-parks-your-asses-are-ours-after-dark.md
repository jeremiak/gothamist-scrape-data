<p>This week, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408125552/http://gothamist.com/2014/02/28/ceo_ticketed_for_running_in_central.php">Peter Shankman learned some hard truths</a> about exercising in city parks when he was given a summons for running in Central Park too early in the morning. As we&apos;ve since learned, Shankman was hardly the first New Yorker to be punished for his devotion to maintaining his own physical health&#x2014;hell, he wasn&apos;t the only NYer punished <em>this week</em>. Crown Heights resident Bill Bradley, 28, was arrested in Prospect Park this past Tuesday after he was caught running in the park at 6:15 p.m., <em>just</em> after sunset. </p>

<p>Bradley, who wrote up <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408125552/http://nextcity.org/equityfactor/entry/i-was-arrested-for-running-after-dark">his story for Next City</a>, told us he runs in the park 6 or 7 days a week (almost always at night), and hasn&apos;t had a problem with police before this. He was given a misdemeanor for &quot;disobeying a park sign,&quot; then arrested after cops discovered he had a warrant for an unpaid summons for drinking on his own stoop. Except, of course, he had paid it: &quot;The city, it appeared, had either not received or failed to cash my check. Municipal efficiency at its finest.&quot;</p>

<p>While Bradley&apos;s arrest was at least partially due to incompetence, he was surrounded by other men while spending the night at the 72nd Precinct in Sunset Park who were all there for various similar (and similarly minor) misdemeanor charges (&quot;Unpaid speeding tickets, hopping a turnstile, outstanding summons&quot;). His court-appointed lawyer explained:</p>

<blockquote>&#x201C;I see these cases all the time,&#x201D; Danny Ashworth, a staff attorney at the Legal Aid Society and my court-appointed representation, told me over the phone yesterday. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s the &#x2018;broken windows&#x2019; theory of law enforcement in action. The concept is, you catch 10,000 little fish in your net, you get a couple of big fish, too. Too bad for the little fish.&#x201D;</blockquote>

<p>Bradley was one of the first called before the judge on Wednesday; his ticket was dismissed immediately. If it seems somewhat coincidental that two people were ticketed for the same minor, usually overlooked offense this week, it probably isn&apos;t: &quot;Most people who&apos;ve gotten in touch think it&apos;s a bogus charge, and have mentioned <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408125552/http://gothamist.com/tags/quotas">end of the month quotas</a> as a reason I didn&apos;t just get a warning,&quot; Shankman had theorized. </p>

<p>Like Shankman, 44-year-old UES resident Kyle Thomas was training for an Ironman competition in November 2012 when he was busted for the same offense in Central Park: &quot;It was an egregious waste of the court&apos;s time and even the judge thought so,&quot; Thomas told us.</p>

<p>Thomas was running south on the West Side loop of the park near 72nd Street when he was stopped by cops around 4:45 a.m. that day, and given the misdemeanor. Thomas, who estimates he still bikes and runs four times a week at that hour, says he usually doesn&apos;t have any problem with the cops who monitor the park. He appeared in court to fight the ticket: &quot;The judge was asleep, he was 100 years old. It was like a scene from <em>Night Court</em>,&quot; he told us. &quot;I stood up said things like, &#x2018;This is an egregious and surreptitious waste of the court&apos;s time and tax payers money, etc.&#x2019; I based my defense on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408125552/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf-Jv4_viQw">the scene from <em>Ghostbusters II</em></a>, when they were in court. Lol but serious.&quot;</p>

<p>After his speech, he was asked to approach the judge: &quot;He asked me if I knew that the park was officially closed [at that hour]. I told them, &apos;I didn&#x2019;t know a park can close?&apos; The judge said, &#x201C;now you know&#x201D; and it was dismissed.&quot; </p>

<p>Other people who exercise in the park regularly reached out to us after becoming incredulous upon reading Shankman&apos;s story: &quot;I am in the park before 6 a.m. at least three times a week all year,&quot; UWS resident Jim Matison, 69, said. &quot;I was there [Friday] morning in the cold at 5:45 for an hour...I am far from alone; hundreds of others are doing the same thing including numerous dog walkers.  And the police see us all and never say a word.&quot; He told us: <br>
 <br>
</p><blockquote>I have never been hassled by the police, but every year they get into the &#x201C;ticket-the-bikers&#x201D; madness.  Running over pedestrians in crosswalks is bad (tickets are appropriate), but on some sections of the roads in the park bikers (good ones) are able to exceed the speed limit of 25 mph.  Tickets have been issued to 27 mph speeders.</blockquote><p></p>

<p>As we&apos;ve previously reported, the NYPD does seem <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408125552/http://gothamist.com/2012/09/10/central_park_cyclist_crackdown_cont.php">to start aggressively enforcing</a> traffic laws in Central Park <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408125552/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/22/cops_ticketing_cyclists_in_central.php">once a year</a> or so with no warning&#x2014;at least for bikers and runners, if not drivers.</p>

<p>Matison added that he noticed multiple large signs scattered about the park with rules listed along with a map: &quot;The good news is that the rules indicate that the park closes at 1:00 a.m. <strong>There was no mention of the time it opened</strong>.&quot; </p>

<p>Thomas had one idea as to how the city could stop wasting city resources with these nonsense tickets: &quot;The city could offer athletic passes kind of like the ones used to swim laps in Lasker Pool. That way both the city and residents are saved from this bureaucratic loop hole,&quot; he said. </p>
