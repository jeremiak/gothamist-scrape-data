<p>It seems that there <em>are</em> two sides to every transsexual porn star date-gone-awry story.  Kayla Coxx, a &quot;sultry transsexual porn star from LA&quot; best known for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503193756/http://www.monstersandcritics.com/people/news/article_1262123.php/Heidi_Fleiss_revenge_on_Charlie_Sheen">hocking</a> a video of her hanging with Charlie Sheen, had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503193756/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/06/date_with_transsexual_porn_star_a_t.php">called the cops</a> on artist Allan D. Hasty just before New Years, alleging that he stiffed her on her &quot;date&quot; fee, and that he had live grenades, guns, and drugs all over his apartment. But Hasty spoke with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503193756/http://scallywagandvagabond.com/2011/01/extortionist-meth-head-tranny-porn-star-sets-up-her-client/">Scallywag and Vagabond</a>, and gave his own rundown of the evening in question, which paints a slightly different picture of Coxx as an &quot;extortionist meth head tranny porn star.&quot;</p>

<p>Hasty says that he was looking for a model for an upcoming project, and was not a &quot;self-proclaimed fan&quot; of Coxx; Hasty alleges that she and her boyfriend asked him if he knew how to score meth. Later, she demanded he pay her for her time, apropos of no prior agreement. When he refused, she threatened to &quot;call the cops and tell them about his &#x2018;live&#x2019; grenade and gun.&quot; Both the grenade and gun were not live, just theatrical props he was using for another project. He says that Coxx lowered the amount of money she wanted from $2000 to $1200, but he still didn&apos;t have anything to give her. </p>

<p>Five hours after she left, the police raided his apartment, evacuated the building, and arrested him. The story went viral, but Hasty was released from jail, and only cited for a violation for saline bags (another prop for his art), which Scallywags says &quot;is akin to getting a ticket for spitting on the sidewalk, not even a misdemeanor.&quot; In the end, Hasty was left with with his home in an utter mess, courtesy of the NYPD, and from all we can tell, there were no happy endings to this story.</p>
