<p>We&apos;re all super pumped about the results of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141112104447/http://gothamist.com/tags/census2010">2010 Census</a>. Who isn&apos;t dying to find out that white people still live on the Upper East Side? But some just can&apos;t wait for the results to come in to start writing their angry editorials: the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141112104447/http://www.nydailynews.com/opinions/2010/11/07/2010-11-07_how_segregation_plagues_bloombergs_new_york_black_white_and_wrong_all_over.html?page=1">Daily News points out</a> today that in the 2000 census, New York was America&apos;s third most racially segregated city, after Detroit and Milwaukee. And as far as they can tell, the results of the latest survey will come to terrifyingly similar conclusions. </p>

<p>They blame some of the housing segregation on real estate professionals who &quot;unlawfully steer white and black renters and buyers to different neighborhoods.&quot; According to Craig Gurian, executive director of the Anti-Discrimination Center, a civil rights organization, the problem is more political in nature: &quot;There has been, in my opinion, an unholy alliance in this city, where patterns of segregation are accepted by a variety of political leaders. You have to have a belief in civil rights enforcement like every other kind of law enforcement. You have to make it more than a once-in-a-while kind of thing.&quot;</p>

<p>Last month, digital cartographer Eric Fischer made a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141112104447/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/20/map_shows_manhattan_is_full_of_whit.php">series of maps</a> based on the 2000 Census data that showed the racial breakdown of America&#x2019;s biggest cities, and which seemed to confirm a lot of what the News argues about the chunkiness of the NYC &quot;melting pot.&quot; The main question we have: will the new Census results show us anything new?</p>
