<p>We&apos;re still picking our jaws off the ground, but they did it: the Jets just defeated the Patriots 28-21 in New England. They played a ferocious defensive game, and Pats QB Tom Brady never looked entirely comfortable. Bill Simmons of ESPN <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160921112057/http://twitter.com/sportsguy33/status/26800145546878976">tweeted</a>, &quot;Outcoached, outplayed, outeverything. Congrats to the Jets.&quot; Sports writer Michael Weinreb <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160921112057/http://twitter.com/MichaelWeinreb/status/26800674708652032">tweeted</a>, &quot;An overzealous goofball has absconded with Tom Brady&apos;s birthright. This is his Winklevoss moment.&quot; And Dan Shanoff of Quickish <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160921112057/http://quickish.com/">wrote</a>, &quot;if you&apos;re going to talk, you better back it up. But if you can back it up, you have earned the right to talk all you want.&quot; We&apos;re excited to watch the post-game interview with Rex Ryan, for what is sure to be one of the greatest post-game interviews of all time.</p>
