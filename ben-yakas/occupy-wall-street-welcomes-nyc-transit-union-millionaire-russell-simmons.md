<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141013221525/http://gothamist.com/tags/occupywallstreet">Occupy Wall Street</a> protesters have had  support from assorted celebrities and intellectuals over the course of the past two weeks, from the likes of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141013221525/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/27/dr_cornel_west_joins_occupy_wall_st.php">Cornell West</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141013221525/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/27/happening_now_susan_sarandon_talks.php">Susan Sarandon</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141013221525/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPR4X-di3gc&amp;feature=player_embedded">Tom Morello</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141013221525/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/27/video_michael_moore_visits_occupati.php">Michael Moore</a>. And while it seems a certain <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141013221525/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/30/live_video_stream_will_radiohead_sh.php">band best-left-unnamed</a> were never actually planning to drop by unannounced at Zuccotti Park this afternoon, protesters gained another two allies in their fight this week: the NYC transit union and Russell Simmons!</p>

<p>The Transit Workers Union Local 100&apos;s executive committee, which oversees 38,000 subway and bus workers, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141013221525/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/09/29/nyc-transit-union-joins-o_n_987156.html">voted unanimously Wednesday night</a> to support the protesters. The union is planning a rally on October 5 to explicitly express their support. &quot;The call went out over a month ago, before actually the occupancy of Wall Street took place,&quot; said 32BJ spokesman Kwame Patterson. Now, he added, &quot;we&apos;re all coming under one cause, even though we have our different initiatives.&quot;</p>

<p>Hip-hop impresario and Ashley Dupre mentor <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141013221525/http://gothamist.com/tags/russellsimmons">Russel Simmons</a> lent his support to protesters as well, giving out 500 bottles of water on Wednesday. He gave them words of encouragement too, posting a letter &quot;in solidarity&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141013221525/http://globalgrind.com/news/russell-simmons-i-am-asking-united-states-government-raise-my-taxes%23ixzz1ZMVq2WEo">on GlobalGrind.</a> He also urged the protesters to remain civil and to more clearly define their agenda: &quot;I think they have to keep this completely nonviolent...The kids that are there now are among the sweetest and the most idealistic and the most safe. I feel responsible to them and I feel responsible for them as a person with more resources.&quot; </p>

<p>He summed up his experience with the protesters like so:<strong> &quot;I felt more connected to the people in the park than to people in the boardroom.&quot;</strong></p>
