But you know you&apos;ve probably stepped over a line when you start filling jars with cash just because one tells you to. That&apos;s what happened to Dane Chan, who is suing Greenwich Village fortune teller Sylvia Mitchell, of &quot;Zena Psychic.&quot; Chan <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150610022557/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan_psychic_nothing_but_scammer_nSqZOs0ssbX8YCQswH6SSO">claims</a> that Mitchell conned her out of nearly $10,000 in late 2008, while Chan was going through personal problems, such as a recent breakup, under the guise of &quot;cleansing&quot; rituals to rid her of &quot;impurities.&quot; And nothing filthier than lucre!</p>

<p>Those rituals included the aforementioned <em>classic</em> stuffing-money-in-a-jar <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150610022557/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/02/17/2010-02-17_fortune_tellers_predictions_included_bilking_insecure_woman_out_of_50000_lawsuit.html">trick</a>: &quot;<strong>Chan was instructed to tuck nine $100 bills and a prayer list outlining her future goals inside a jar.</strong> She was then told to fill the jar halfway with water, spit in it and sleep with her jar under her pillow for a week,&quot; before handing it over to Mitchell. Chan also accuses Mitchell of stealing her credit card twice to go on shopping sprees at a Ralph Lauren store to buy materials for the cleansing. </p>

<p>This seems to be Mitchell&apos;s M.O. though&#x2014;there are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150610022557/http://gypsybuster.blogspot.com/">several reports</a> on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150610022557/http://losangeles.citysearch.com/profile/45470444/los_angeles_ca/zena_psychic.html">different websites</a> that warn about her, including detailed descriptions by several victims on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150610022557/http://www.ripoffreport.com/Psychic/Sylvia-Mitchell/sylvia-mitchell-zena-psychic-7268b.htm">Ripoff Report</a> which describe the cons she pulled on Chan to a tee: </p>
