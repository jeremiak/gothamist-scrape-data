<p>This week, Buzzfeed writer McKay Coppins <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140424134441/http://www.buzzfeed.com/mckaycoppins/36-hours-on-the-fake-campaign-trail-with-donald-trump">published a harrowing account</a> of spending 36 hours in semi-close quarters with our favorite very classy combover enthusiast, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140424134441/http://gothamist.com/tags/donaldtrump">Donald Trump.</a> We already knew that Trump, who has turned the art of being a professional used car salesman into a life mantra, is a vacuous airbag <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140424134441/http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/newsdesk/2011/04/donald-trump-mark-singer.html">with no inner life</a> and no scruples if it affords him the chance to get in front of a camera. But that doesn&apos;t mean we didn&apos;t find Coppins report to be an enjoyable read. So below, we&apos;ve broken up some insights into the man behind the combover with some classic Buzzfeed buttons.</p>

<p><strong>OMG</strong>: The thrust of the piece: Trump is desperately insecure and trapped in &quot;the bubble of luxury and loyalty.&quot; He&apos;s constantly looking for validation for his every utterance. Coppins doesn&apos;t think there&apos;s even a remote chance Trump is serious about his political aspirations (such as running for governor of NY). </p>

<blockquote>The purpose of all this posturing is clear; Trump very badly wants to be taken seriously as a potential political candidate and not be written off as a man-boy who cried wolf. But, at the same time, he plainly has no interest in actually running for office. </blockquote>

<p>It feels at times in the piece as though even Trump is starting to get tired of the back-and-forth bullshit media games he plays, the will-he-won&apos;t-he scripts that always end up with birther blather and wasted cash. Yet, Trump seems to crave validation from members of the media more than anyone else:</p>

<blockquote>Trump explains that he doesn&#x2019;t necessarily &#x201C;like&#x201D; the members of the press so much as he &#x201C;respect[s]&#x201D; them. More to the point, he understands them &#x2014; how to feed them, how to flatter them, how to use them, how to put on a show for them, and how to intimidate them. Sometimes, he does all of it in one interview.</blockquote>

<p><strong>WTF</strong>: You know that someone like Trump is surrounded 24/7 by yes men&#x2014;that&apos;s a given when you&apos;re dealing with an egomaniac who flirts with political office with nary a policy thought in his gold-flecked head. But we didn&apos;t realize the extent to which these yes men have drunk the kool-aid. In fact, it sounds like they&apos;ve been doing keg stands with the kool-aid.</p>

<blockquote>As I quietly eat my salad and listen to the three men talk, I am struck by their reverence for the boss, to whom they unwaveringly refer as &#x201C;Mr. Trump,&#x201D; even among one another. The notion that Trump is a credible threat to run for president is treated with nothing but credulity &#x2014; even when we&#x2019;re off the record, and even when they&#x2019;re carrying on private conversations they don&#x2019;t know I&#x2019;m eavesdropping on.</blockquote>

<p>And this gilded palace of positivity where Trump lives is apparently not enough to satisfy him:</p>

<blockquote>Within the bubble of luxury and loyalty Trump has created for himself, he hears about his own greatness every day from people on his payroll, or people who profit from his TV show, or people who are simply excited to see a famous person in real life. In this context, his mission to make me and my colleagues in the political press take him seriously seems to have little to do with answering a call to public service, or even a juvenile cry for attention. It&#x2019;s about satisfying his insatiable thirst for validation from a world where people don&#x2019;t reflexively call him &#x201C;Mr. Trump.&#x201D;</blockquote> 

<p><strong>WIN</strong>: As previously mentioned, Trump doesn&apos;t have much time for introspection. But while he tries his darndest to be as selective with what he says in front of him as he can, Coppins was able to elicit two honest responses from Trump. First this one, which is as close to a Freudian slip as one can hope to get with someone as paper-thin as Trump:</p>

<blockquote>Isn&#x2019;t it possible he&#x2019;s simply bored with real estate and reality TV, that he&#x2019;s searching for stimulation? Trump shrugs. &#x201C;Who knows what&#x2019;s in the deepest part of my mind? That could be possible.&#x201D;</blockquote>

<p>Then there was this hilarious moment when Trump admitted to being self-aware about his trolling (while learning the word):</p>

<blockquote>I ask Trump if he has ever heard the word &#x201C;trolling,&#x201D; and at his request, I define it for him. He mulls it over for a second, and then confesses, &#x201C;I do love provoking people. There is truth to that. I love competition, and sometimes competition is provoking people. I don&#x2019;t mind provoking people. Especially when they&#x2019;re the right kind of people.&#x201D;</blockquote>

<p><strong>TRASHY</strong>: Trump is nothing if not a Grade-A misogynist: women are only worth mentioning if they are particularly attractive. After they arrive at Mar-a-Lago, a 17-acre Moorish estate in Palm Beach, Fla., &quot;Trump leans in close, and lowers his voice. &apos;There are a lot of good-looking women here,&apos; he says. Then he strides off, salad in hand.&quot;</p>

<p>Later, he notices a picture of Coppins&apos; wife and 1-year-old on his phone: &#x201C;Wife and baby? Wow! Congratulations!&#x201D; he emotes. <strong>&#x201C;I was just looking down and saying, &#x2018;Wow, that&#x2019;s a good-looking woman!&#x2019;&#x201D;</strong></p>

<p>Okay, an exception to the rule: Trump really likes Maureen Dowd, Diane Sawyer, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140424134441/http://gothamist.com/tags/andreapeyser">Andrea Peyser</a> (&#x201C;a firecracker&#x201D; who &#x201C;actually is a legitimate reporter,&#x201D; which... well, you two definitely belong together).</p>

<p><strong>FAIL</strong>: Oh right, Trump is married, but who cares about that when there are good-looking women and wives to ogle at. The only mention of third wife Melania comes when discussing whether they can take the aforementioned trip to Florida. &quot;There is also the fact that tomorrow is his anniversary with his third wife, Melania. <strong>Trump doesn&#x2019;t seem to mind missing it. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s fine,&#x201D; he says, prompting chuckles from the yes-men.&quot;</strong></p>

<p><strong>CUTE</strong>: This is probably the only true revelation of the piece (and also explains how Buzzfeed got to spend so much time with him in the first place): Trump sounds a little obsessed with Buzzfeed. </p>

<blockquote>He introduces me to an older, German-accented gentleman who appears to be in charge of the event.
<br><br>
&#x201C;He&#x2019;s the biggest blogger in the world,&#x201D; Trump tells the man. &#x201C;You look at him, and he&#x2019;s sort of handsome, but his power is immense.&#x201D; He turns to me. &#x201C;Isn&#x2019;t that right?&#x201D;
<br><br>
Before I can answer, he is facing the German gentleman again. &#x201C;Have you heard of BuzzFeed?&#x201D;
<br><br>
The man doesn&#x2019;t want to say no, but it&#x2019;s clear he&#x2019;s unfamiliar.
<br><br>
<strong>&#x201C;It used to be the New York Times, now it&#x2019;s BuzzFeed,&#x201D;</strong> Trump explains. He pauses a beat, and then adds, almost wistfully, &#x201C;The world has changed.&#x201D;</blockquote>

<p><strong>LOL</strong>: Throughout the piece, there are ominous warnings that despite his affection for Buzzfeed and Coppins&apos; wife, Trump&apos;s vindictiveness is but a moment from erupting.</p>

<blockquote>But later in our interview, he feels compelled to fire a warning shot. &#x201C;If I am treated unfairly, I will go after that reporter,&#x201D; he tells me. Trump, who doesn&#x2019;t use email, has been known to print out articles about himself that he doesn&#x2019;t like and scrawl handwritten hate notes across the top before mailing them to reporters.
<br><br>
&#x201C;Are you going to come after me when this article comes out?&#x201D; I ask.
<br><br>
&#x201C;Maybe.&#x201D;</blockquote>

<p>His prophecy came true: &#x201C;It is a totally dishonest and unfair article, written by a politically irrelevant website,&#x201D; Trump&#x2019;s EVP and Special Counsel Michael Cohen <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140424134441/http://www.thewrap.com/donald-trump-hits-back-buzzfeed-dishonest-article-written-irrelevant-website/">told TheWrap</a>. &#x201C;From the moment the reporter entered the vehicle to the time he left Mar-a-Lago, his only goal was to write a negative piece.&#x201D; The piece has &quot;closed the door&quot; on any BuzzTrump team-ups in the future.</p>
