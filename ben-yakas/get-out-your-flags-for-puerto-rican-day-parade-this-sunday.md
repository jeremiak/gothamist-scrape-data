There are expected to be more than 80,000 people marching at the annual parade, and close to 3 million revelers lining the parade route from 44th to 86th Streets on Fifth Avenue. The event kicks off Sunday at 11 a.m.</p>

<p>The 2011 Parade Grand Marshals are Robert I. Unanue, President of Goya Foods, Inc., and Carlos Unanue, President of Goya Foods Puerto Rico. One major piece of advice: go to the bathroom before you head out to see the parade. &quot;Sanitation wants us to put up public toilets, but the city doesn&apos;t want too many for security reasons. We used to have 100 toilets but now we only put up 20,&quot; said Madelyn Lugo, chairwoman of the board of directors of the National Puerto Rican Day Parade. Also, remember not to mistakenly burn any flags in an overly festive mood:</p>
