title: Wife Wants Dead Husband's Sperm For His Girlfriend
---

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="101710sperm.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412161500im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/101710sperm.jpg" width="220" height="281" class="image-left"> </span>Some wives are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412161500/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/26/paladinos_wife.php">surprisingly understanding</a> when their husbands tell them out of the blue that they have a ten-year-old love child with their former mistress. Other wives are so understanding, they get court orders to extract sperm from their recently deceased husband so that his girlfriend can have his baby. </p>

<p>Victoria Chege made that odd request this week, asking a Manhattan judge for permission to harvest late husband George Kamau&apos;s sperm. Kamau, 37, committed suicide Oct. 11 in Norwalk, Conn. at the home of Etaghua Asefa, 35, who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412161500/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/sperm_widow_in_mistress_twist_82zUiQBcQtHLpvSXD1K5vN">identified herself</a> to cops as the dead man&apos;s girlfriend. In court papers, Chege referred to Asefa as a &quot;family friend and appointed surrogate [mother],&quot; who was supposed to &quot;give birth to the child he wanted but was prevented from conceiving.&quot; Justice Shirley Warner Kornreich <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412161500/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/now_it_grave_to_cradle_48QNKmtp3WZrUXgCjxZTOP?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">signed off</a> on Chege&apos;s sperm-preservation request, but fertitlity experts say the sperm must be taken from a corpse within 36 hours of death for it to be viable. Kamau was dead for at least 60 hours before Kornreich signed the order.</p>

In <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110412161500/http://gothamist.com/2009/03/04/judges_nix_parents_desire_for_grand.php">another case</a>, a Judge didn&apos;t allow a couple to use their deceased son&apos;s sperm to produce a grandchild .</p>
