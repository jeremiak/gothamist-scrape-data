<p>We <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150808084910/http://gothamist.com/2010/12/26/the_changing_face_of_sports_groupie.php">already knew</a> that Facebook is the best way for ambitious women to meet jocks, but it&apos;s quickly becoming the best way to meet prostitutes! The Daily News <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150808084910/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2011/02/27/2011-02-27_very_friendly__but_for_a_fee_hookers_flocking_to_facebook.html">discovered</a> Sudhir Venkatesh&apos;s month-old (but still compelling) look at the changing face of NYC&apos;s sex trade <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150808084910/http://www.wired.com/magazine/2011/01/ff_sextrade/all/1">in Wired</a>, which we already noted at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150808084910/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/03/how_much_is_a_hand_job_in_your_boro.php">start of the month</a>. But it&apos;s never a bad time to learn that 83 percent of the 290 NYC-based prostitutes he interviewed have a Facebook page! </p>

<p>Venkatesh argues that Facebook allows hookers to take &quot;control of their image, set their prices, and sidestep some of the pimps, madams, and other intermediaries who once took a share of the revenue.&quot; NYPD spokesman Paul Browne sounded unimpressed: &quot;Everybody is using the internet.&quot; The News also spoke to a 32-year-old prostitute who thinks Facebook is too innocent for such <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150808084910/http://gothamist.com/2010/11/18/anti-facebook_nj_preacher_fights_di.php">digital temptations</a>: &quot;It&apos;s a place for teenagers to socialize, to play games, to meet friends - not a place for some dumb ass to find a piece of ass.&quot; So...the elephant in the room: has anyone met a lady of the night on Facebook? Or do you prefer doing it the old fashioned way&#x2014;at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150808084910/http://newyork.timeout.com/sex-dating/42097/best-happy-ending-parlors">happy-ending parlors</a>?</p>
