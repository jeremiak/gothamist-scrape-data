<p>And worst of all: the private schools offered to pay $52.6 million in 2006 for construction and refurbishment of the sports fields, as long as they could get the field 2/3 of the time during the peak hours of 3-6pm. Their offer was eventually turned down <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150110222955/http://gothamist.com/2008/02/01/randalls_island_4.php">because of a lawsuit</a> brought by public school parents, community groups and park advocates, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150110222955/http://gothamist.com/2007/02/10/randalls_island.php">arguing that the city had no right</a> to grant private schools special access to public land. The city still renovated the fields, and the end result turned out the same. According to the Department of Parks and Recreation, independent private schools used the fields 56 percent of the time, compared with 13 percent for public schools; the rest of the time it is used by other private institutions, including the Catholic schools and community organizations. </p>

<p>Although public schools are allowed to request the use of the fields, many don&apos;t have the same resources as private schools, such as buses, so students are forced to take public transportation, and many have trouble getting to the fields in a &quot;reasonable amount of time to make use of them.&quot; A very sad picture is revealed:</p>
