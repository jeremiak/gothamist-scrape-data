<p>Last weekend, a 55-year-old woman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140606044103/http://gothamist.com/2014/04/27/woman_fatally_struck_by_train_at_as.php">was fatally struck by a 6 train</a> at Astor Place when she leaned over the platform and was hit by an oncoming train. Now video has emerged showing another woman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140606044103/http://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/WATCH-Woman-Falls-Onto-Tracks-at-SEPTA-Station-257236881.html?_osource=SocialFlowTwt_PHBrand">who was seriously injured</a> after leaning over a train platform in Philadelphia and falling onto the tracks. You can watch the harrowing incident below.</p>

<center><script type="text/javascript" charset="UTF-8" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20140606044103js_/http://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/portableplayer/?cmsID=257280421&amp;videoID=a2pDgB72avIA&amp;origin=nbcphiladelphia.com&amp;sec=news&amp;subsec=local&amp;width=600&amp;height=360"></script></center>

<p>The woman, whose name hasn&apos;t been released, was waiting at the Ellsworth-Federal SEPTA station around 1:15 p.m. Tuesday when she leaned over, lost her footing, and landed on the third rail. &quot;The electrical current runs through your body,&quot; SEPTA Police Chief Tom Nestel <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140606044103/http://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/WATCH-Woman-Falls-Onto-Tracks-at-SEPTA-Station-257236881.html?_osource=SocialFlowTwt_PHBrand">told NBC</a>. &quot;It interferes with your major organs. It can shut down your heart. It can cause death and it often does.&quot;</p>

<p>The woman, who police say somehow got on the platform without paying, was immediately aided by other waiting passengers and SEPTA workers at the station, who were able to shut off power and call for help immediately. The woman was taken to a local hospital in serious condition. &quot;Everybody on that platform either ran to help or ran up to the cashier to notify SEPTA,&quot; Nestel added. &quot;She is still alive because of the great work of the fire department and Jefferson Hospital.&quot; </p>
