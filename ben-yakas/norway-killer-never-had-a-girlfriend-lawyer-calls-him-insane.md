<p>Norway is still reeling from the horrific terror attacks on Friday which left <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427192412/http://gothamist.com/2011/07/23/at_least_91_dead_after_coordinated.php#photo-1">76 confirmed dead</a> in Ut&#xF8;ya and Oslo. Anders Behring Breivik, the man <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427192412/http://gothamist.com/2011/07/24/norwegian_terror_suspect_admits_to.php">who confessed</a> &quot;to the factual circumstances&quot; of the coordinated attacks on Norway&apos;s government headquarters and a youth retreat, is currently being detained in solitary confinement for eight weeks, but his lawyer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427192412/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/27/world/europe/27oslo.html?_r=1&amp;ref=world">has implied that</a> he may seek an insanity plea for his &quot;very cold&quot; client: &quot;<strong>This whole case has indicated that he&apos;s insane. He expects that this is a start of war that will last for 60 years, but his mind is very...well, I don&apos;t want to comment more on his mind, but that&apos;s what he believes</strong>,&quot; attorney Geir Lippestad <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427192412/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/2011/07/26/2011-07-26_andres_behring_breivik_accused_norway_gunman_very_likely_insane_says_his_lawyer.html">told reporters yesterday.</a></p>

<p>Lippestad said Breivik told cops he was part of a Christian crusader army trying to save Europe from what they see as a Muslim invasion: &quot;He looks upon himself as a warrior. And he started this war, and takes some kind of pride in that.&quot; He also reportedly took drugs to &quot;to be strong, to be efficient, to keep him awake&quot; during the 90-minute attack on the youth camp, and one of the first questions he asked police after his arrest was how many people he had killed.</p>

<p>In his rambling 1,500-page manifesto, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427192412/http://gothamist.com/2011/07/25/norway_killer_says_more_cells_exist.php">Breivik claimed that</a> he was focused on driving out the &quot;Muslims,&quot; &quot;Marxists&quot; and &quot;multiculturalists&quot; as part of his pseudo-holy war. But an unidentified friend of Breivik <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427192412/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/2011/07/26/2011-07-26_psycho_behind_norway_massacre_was_bullied_never_loved_by_ladies_friend_of_anders.html">gives more details</a> about his motivations, and suggests there was another reason for his extremist views: girls never paid attention to him. &quot;He has never had a girlfriend, as far as I know,&quot; the friend said. In addition, Breivik underwent plastic surgery on his forehead, nose and chin to try to improve his chances. A photo has also surfaced of Breivik dancing at a Gay Pride event in Oslo seven years ago, although the gunman insisted he was straight in his manifesto.</p>

<p>The names of the 76 massacre victims have now been released, and President Obama paid his respects at the Norwegian Embassy yesterday. Norwegian prime minister Jens Stoltenberg <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427192412/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/28/world/europe/28norway.html?ref=world">spoke at a news conference this morning</a>; he discussed mourning for the victims, repudiated the violence of the attacks, but said this should not curtail free speech in the country: <strong>&#x201C;We have to tolerate also views we don&#x2019;t like,</strong>&#x201D; he said. </p>

<p>Even so, there is one thing that everyone <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427192412/http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2011/07/26/norway-shooter-breivik-gets-off-easy-maximum-sentence-is-21-years.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+thedailybeast%2Farticles+%28The+Daily+Beast+-+Latest+Articles%29&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader">seems angry about</a>: Breivik won&apos;t get the death penalty, nor is it likely he&apos;ll get life in prison, because of Norway&apos;s lenient system of justice. As of now, he&apos;s eligible for 21-years in prison, the max, which may be increased only if he is identified as a possible risk of repeat offenses. Breivik may eventually end up at Halden, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427192412/http://www.novinite.com/view_news.php?id=130636">the &quot;heavenly&quot; prison</a> which spent roughly $1 million on paintings, photography and light installations for prisoners, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427192412/http://www.time.com/time/photogallery/0,29307,1989083_2137368,00.html">including a mural by Norwegian graffiti artist Dolk</a>, which &quot;brings a touch of humor to a rather controlled space.&quot;</p>
