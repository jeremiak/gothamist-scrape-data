<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509165911/http://gothamist.com/tags/triumphtheinsultcomicdog">Triumph The Insult Comic Dog</a> only emerges from his extended hibernation a few times a year at best these days, so we cherish any opportunity to witness him pooping on well-intentioned people across the United States. NYers were in for a treat last week when Triumph went to various bars around Astoria to soak in the &quot;flashmob of horrible BO&quot; and hilariously poop on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509165911/http://gothamist.com/tags/worldcup">World Cup fans.</a> Watch it below.</p>

<p>&quot;The excitement of minimal contact, the thrill of low-scoring,&quot; he intones. &quot;If you like watching porn in reverse, this sport is for you.&quot; He parties with the Colombian fans with fake cocaine, discovers all Greek fans work at diners, and mocks the &quot;easter egg&quot;-like colors of Uruguayan fans. And there is the promise of more Triumph/World Cup action soon.</p>

<p>&quot;Everyone is cheering their countries in their favorite sport,&quot; Triumph says. &quot;The rest of the world calls it football. In America, we call it a &apos;fucking waste of time.&apos;&quot;<br>
