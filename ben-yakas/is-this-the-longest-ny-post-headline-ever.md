	<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="51813post.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130724063500im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/51813post.jpg" width="640" height="396"> <br> <i> Screenshot</i></div> <p></p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130724063500/http://gothamist.com/tags/nypost">NY Post</a> prides itself on its <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130724063500/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/opinion/opedcolumnists/item_BaU8lygeOwWfjAnIAYW8MJ">sex-obsessed cat lady columnists</a>, its round-the-clock Alec Baldwin-baiting coverage, and most of all, its lurid, attention-grabbing, and sometimes <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130724063500/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/18/teen_on_ny_post_cover_today_swears.php">often libelous</a> headlines and front pages. The NY Post style has become so popular, they&apos;ve even launched a tour bus based around it. But today, they may have broken their own formula with their longest, clunkiest headline ever: &quot;Gospel singer suing McDonald&apos;s after she allegedly bit into piece of glass while eating chicken sandwich, which she claims ruined her voice.&quot;</p>

<p>The 22-word long headline is almost as long as the entire first graf, which spells out the same information&#x2014;it only adds that it took place in Manhattan and singer Jacqueline Simpson is from Brooklyn. Simpson claims she bit into the piece of glass in May 2010 at a McDonald&apos;s on Broadway in the Financial District&#x2014;now she has &quot;a hoarse, rattly voice&#x201D; and people mistake her for a man on the phone.</p>

<p>But just think of all the wasted opportunities the Post had for this headline. Below are but a few of our suggestions:</p>
