<p>You may or may not love <em>Late Late Show</em> host James Corden, whose effervescent personality often comes across like someone just gave a theater kid a shot of espresso at 12:30 a.m., but there&apos;s no denying that like Wolverine, he is the best there is at what he does. And what he does is get world-famous singers to drive around in cars with him and singalong to their biggest hits in a manner which comes across as genuine and off-the-cuff (even if it&apos;s as manufactured as any other celebrity appearance).</p>

<p>&quot;Carpool Karaoke&quot; has become a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161210223139/http://www.ew.com/article/2016/02/04/james-corden-carpool-karaoke-adele-justin-bieber-elton-john">huge viral hit</a>, even generating its own <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161210223139/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/james-corden-late-late-show-873953">spinoff show</a>. And the latest edition of it gives you a good indication of why: watch below as Madonna drives around NYC with Corden singing some of her biggest hits (&#x201C;Vogue,&#x201D; &#x201C;Papa Don&#x2019;t Preach,&#x201D; &#x201C;Express Yourself,&#x201D; &quot;Music,&quot; &#x201C;Ray of Light&#x201D;), in between twerking and dishing on her relationship with Michael Jackson.</p>

<p>Madonna doesn&apos;t sit still for most of the car ride, constantly moving around in her seat, at one point even lifting her leg up to the ceiling (&quot;I feel so inadequate,&quot; Corden responds appropriately). She turns around in her seat and twerks for the camera after &quot;Bitch I&apos;m Madonna,&quot; which prompted Corden to note, &#x201C;That&#x2019;s the first in-car twerk I&#x2019;ve ever seen.&quot; </p>

<p>And then there&apos;s the Michael Jackson story: in between &quot;Ray of Light&quot; and &quot;Music,&quot; Madonna recalls a romantic evening with him. &quot;Baby, I&#x2019;ve been around. Yeah, tongue-in-mouth kissing,&quot;  she told Corden. &quot;He&#x2019;s a little bit shy. However, he was a willing accomplice. I did get him to, sort of, loosen up with a glass of Chardonnay. And it did wonders. It worked wonders.&quot;</p>
