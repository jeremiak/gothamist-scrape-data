[Update Below] A man who climbed on top of the Manhattan Bridge is currently involved in a stand-off with police. The upper level of the bridge was closed around 2:20 p.m. Wednesday when the man, who was shirtless in red board shorts, climbed to the top of the Brooklyn-side of the bridge. Over 15 police vehicles and dozens of officers are at the scene now trying to talk the man down. We&apos;ll update once we learn more information.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: The dramatic stand-off ended around 2:40 p.m. when police were able to reach the man and voluntarily take him into custody. </p>
