<p>It&apos;s been over two months since John Oliver <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021172839/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/14/john_oliver_president_trump.php">was last on air</a>, parsing the results of the election and the coronation of President Wombat. Since then, he&apos;s kept himself busy <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021172839/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/21/stephen_colbert_john_oliver_share_t.php">sharing his anxieties</a> with Stephen Colbert and learning that gay New Yorkers care more about Wendy Williams <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021172839/http://gothamist.com/2017/01/03/video_billy_eichner_investigates_wh.php">than him</a>. But <em>Last Week Tonight</em> is coming back in a few weeks, which means it&apos;s time for a great new promo&#x2014;featuring the likes of Larry David, Kumail Nanjiani and the Iron Throne from <em>GoT</em>.</p>

<p>David has been off doing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021172839/http://gothamist.com/tags/larrydavid">&quot;...things!&quot;</a> like getting the long-awaited ninth season of <em>Curb Your Enthusiasm</em> off the ground. While we don&apos;t know yet when it might premiere, you can tune into HBO at 11 p.m. on February 12th to see the season premiere of <em>Last Week Tonight</em>.</p>
