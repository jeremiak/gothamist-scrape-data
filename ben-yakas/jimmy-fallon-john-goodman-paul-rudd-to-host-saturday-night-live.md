<p>With Bill Hader, Fred Armisen, and Jason Sudekis gone (and Seth Meyers with one foot out the door), <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150103064701/http://gothamist.com/tags/snl"><em>Saturday Night Live</em></a> is undergoing a very transitionary 39th season. In their place, there have been interchangeable new (white) cast members, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150103064701/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/03/videos_saturday_night_live_3.php#photo-2">awkwardly-acknowledged controversies</a>, and that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150103064701/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/06/videos_saturday_night_live_turns_in.php#photo-1">terrible Miley Cyrus episode</a>. But thankfully, we finally have some good hosts to look forward to: Paul Rudd, John Goodman, and Jimmy Fallon will each return to host the show in December. Is it too much to hope for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150103064701/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrMf8MRQ0dc">Stumblin pt 2</a>?</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="112113snl2.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150103064701im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/112113snl2.jpeg" width="640" height="480" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>Up first is Paul Rudd, making his third hosting appearance, with musical guest One Direction on December 7th&#x2014;considering Rudd is promoting <em>Anchorman 2</em>, we would not be shocked to see a Will Ferrel/Ron Burgundy cameo, or perhaps the whole Chanel 4 News Team. Then on December 14th comes John Goodman, who&apos;ll be hosting for the 13th time. He&apos;ll have musical guest Kings of Leon (performing for their third time on the show) with him. </p>

<p>And finally on December 21st, Jimmy Fallon will return for the second time since he left the show to host the last episode of the year&#x2014;and he&apos;ll bring good buddy and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150103064701/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/10/video_justin_timberlake_and_stefon.php#photo-1">Five-Timers Club member</a> Justin Timberlake along as musical guest. Although we&apos;d bet a lot of money that Timberlake will show up in plenty of sketches as well.</p>

<p>So yeah, lots of good hosts a&apos;coming. A lot of tried and true hosts, sure, but we&apos;d take any of these three over Bruce Willis or whoever it is that is hosting this weekend. We&apos;d certainly rather watch Fallon breaking in the middle of the happiest place on Earth than Cyrus sticking her tongue out <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150103064701/http://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/miley-cyrus-tells-saturday-night-2332055">to smell</a> or whatever. </p>
