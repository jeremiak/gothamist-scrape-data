<p>A newlywed Pennsylvania couple <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140331102659/http://www.pennlive.com/midstate/index.ssf/2013/12/newlywed_husband_aided_wife_in.html">have been arrested and accused</a> of killing a man they met on Craigslist to celebrate their three-week wedding anniversary and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140331102659/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2519750/Revealed-Newlywed-thrill-killers-used-Craigslist-lure-married-man-sex-stabbed-20-times-theyve-wanted-murder-together.html">fulfill a longtime fantasy</a>. Elytte Barbour, 22, and wife Miranda Barbour, 18, have been charged with the murder of 42-year-old Troy LaFerrara. &quot;They went out to dinner on Veteran&apos;s Day to celebrate and to enjoy the thrill of killing,&quot; Sunbury Police Chief Stephen Mazzeo <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140331102659/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/pennsylvania-newlyweds-homicide-honeymoon-police-article-1.1540634">told the Daily News.</a></p>

<p>Elytte Barbour told officers before his arrest last night that he and his wife had planned to kill before but their plans never worked out until LaFerrara responded to Miranda&apos;s Craigslist ad offering companionship. &#x201C;She is not a prostitute,&#x201D; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140331102659/http://www.pennlive.com/midstate/index.ssf/2013/12/newlywed_husband_aided_wife_in.html">Elytte explained</a>, saying Miranda made anywhere from $50 to $850 for meeting men for dinner or a walk. &#x201C;What she does is meet men who have broken marriages or have no one in their lives and she meets with them and has delightful conversation.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Sunbury police say that Elytte told investigators he hid in the backseat of the couple&#x2019;s SUV as his wife picked up LaFerrara at a mall on Nov. 11. He told police that his wife signaled him, and he wrapped a cord around LaFerrara&#x2019;s neck, restraining him while Miranda stabbed him. LaFerrara was stabbed 20 times altogether, and the couple dumped his body in an alleyway, where it was found the next day. </p>

<p>Miranda was charged earlier this week charged with criminal homicide, aggravated assault, simple assault and criminal conspiracy and possession of instruments of crime. But she initially told investigators that her husband had nothing to do with it; she first claimed that she stabbed him after he groped her and put a hand on her neck.</p>

<p>The couple, who were married on Oct. 22, were celebrating their three-week wedding anniversary the night of the murder. Miranda has a 16-month-old child from a previous relationship; the father of that child is dead, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140331102659/http://www.dailyitem.com/breakingnews/x602337049/COPS-YOUNG-NEWLYWEDS-THRILL-KILLERS">police are now looking into</a> the circumstances around his death. </p>
