<p>The beginning of April is always jam-packed with exciting events and occasions. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405202817/http://gothamist.com/tags/lcdsoundsystem">LCD Soundsystem</a> are playing their final shows this week, the MLB season starts for the Yankees on Thursday, and April Fools Day is Friday (is it really a coincidence that the Mets first game is the same day?). But of course, the <em>most important</em> event of the week will happen on Saturday.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405202817/http://www.pillowfightday.com/2011/new-york-city">Pillow Fight Day 2011</a> will take place around the world this Saturday. It&apos;ll start at 3 pm in Union Square, where people have been swinging pillows at one another for the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405202817/http://gothamist.com/tags/pillowfight">last few years</a>. According to host <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405202817/http://www.newmindspace.com/">Newmindspace</a>, over 5,000 people participated in last year&apos;s event. There will also be an after party at Hiro Ballroom, featuring Hellfire Machina. Just <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405202817/http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=164979500216417">remember</a>: only soft pillows, pajamas are encouraged, and lay off people with cameras or without pillows. After all, Big Brother <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405202817/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/20/pillow_fight_4.php">will be watching</a>. And it almost goes without saying, but since some people are in denial: don&apos;t bring any pillows that have ever come in contact with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405202817/http://gothamist.com/tags/bedbugs">bed bugs</a> with you, mkay?</p>
