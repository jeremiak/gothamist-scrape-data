<p>You&apos;ve seen them <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509165606/http://gothamist.com/2014/02/20/sharknado_filming.php#photo-1">filming in Times Square</a>; you&apos;ve seen <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509165606/http://gothamist.com/2014/02/25/sharknado_exclusive_photos.php#photo-1">their prop faces</a>; you&apos;ve even seen them <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509165606/http://gothamist.com/2014/06/05/watch_nyc_get_sharknadod_in_new_sha.php">squash Citi Bike riders</a>. But now comes the first actual clip from forthcoming TV movie event of the century, <em>Sharknado 2: The Second One</em>, and boy is it great: there&apos;s a defrosted Mark McGrath, a cameo from hipster-hating (and hat-free) Judah Friedlander, a glimpse of Perez Hilton, raspy acting from star/hero/ageless teenager Ian Ziering, and of course, a man-devouring subway shark.

<p>The disaster epic comes out July 30th on SyFy, so don&apos;t say we didn&apos;t warn you. And in case you&apos;re worried about a real life sharknado hitting NYC, a spokesman for the city&#x2019;s Office of Emergency Management <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509165606/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/14/ny_post_trying_hard_to_prove_that_s.php">previously noted</a> that sharknados are, surprisingly, not a real weather phenomenon: &quot;There&#x2019;s a zero probability of sharks raining down on New York.&quot;</p>
