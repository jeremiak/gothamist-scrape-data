<p>Trolls come in many forms, be it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425231545/http://gothamist.com/tags/rushlimbaugh">oxycodone-enriched radio blowhards</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425231545/http://gothamist.com/tags/donaldtrump">classy used car salesmen</a>, or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425231545/http://gothamist.com/tags/bloomberg">diminutive mayors</a>&#x2014;but there ain&apos;t no troll like a pasty, bearded internet troll hellbent on bringing the pwnage. To that end, one very passionate Mets fan has been arrested and charged for sending a series of threatening tweets to Mets executives, players, coaches, and even Citi Field. </p>

<p>Aryn Leroux, 42, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425231545/http://www.courant.com/news/connecticut/hc-west-haven-mets-threat-1024-20131023,0,4376945.story">was arrested today</a> in West Haven for the alleged threats, which included a &quot;specific threat&quot; to Citi Field. He has been  charged with threatening in the second degree and breach of peace. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425231545/http://richmacleod.tumblr.com/post/64871447971/notable-mets-twitter-troll-arrested">According to Richard MacLeod</a>, Leroux is none other than notorious Mets Twitter troll <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425231545/https://twitter.com/danxtanna">@danXtanna</a> (who deleted his profile around 4 p.m. this afternoon). MacLeod writes:</p>

<blockquote>Over the past season, &#x201C;Tanna&#x201D; had run-ins with Mets players publicly and not-so publicly, making specific threats towards players, staff and the ballpark. While I won&#x2019;t say specifically what the threats were, know that they were serious enough to warrant police attention.</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425231545/http://deadspin.com/man-arrested-for-threatening-the-mets-1450822211">Some Deadspin commenters</a> took note of some of the offending tweets, including ones in which he wanted to fight pitcher Jon Rauch, mocked Justin Turner&apos;s girlfriend, threatened to poison patrons of Citi Field attending Mike Piazza&apos;s Hall Of Fame Induction, and threatened to ram into certain officials in their cars.</p>

<p>Here are two typical tweets: &#x201C;tomorrow is Friday the 13th&#x2026; lets get a gang of us to wear Jason Vorhees masks to Citi-Field and go skin us a GM-Owner-Manager&#x201D; and &#x201C;think of it&#x2026; it would be the lead story on CNN&#x2026;. #mets fans kill the team owner-gm-manager. before they kill us #selfdefense.&#x201D; So for the most part, it seems like typical, if violent, troll garble. You&apos;d think this fan would know by now that his efforts are unnecessary&#x2014;the Mets <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425231545/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/10/mets_successfully_offend_american_i.php">are their own worst trolls.</a></p>
