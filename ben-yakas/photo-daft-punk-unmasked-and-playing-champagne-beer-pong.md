<p>With Daft Punk in town <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429092441/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/05/daft_punk_shooting_video_in_midtown.php#photo-1">shooting some video</a> (hopefully involving <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429092441/http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=GGJy822geAg">mom jeans</a>) in midtown yesterday, we got into a discussion with coworkers about how no one has seen what the titular duo look like without their helmets on in over a decade. Electronic duo the Knocks coincidentally decided that yesterday was the perfect time to post a photo of them sans robotics. And of course&#x2014;<em>of course</em>&#x2014;they&apos;re playing &quot;champagne beer pong,&quot; the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429092441/http://www.rap-up.com/2013/03/02/video-mariah-carey-plays-champagne-pong-with-jimmy-fallon/">sport of Mariah Carey.</a></p>

<p>As <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429092441/http://gawker.com/heres-what-daft-punk-look-like-without-their-helmets-511561986">Gawker points out</a>, The Knocks quickly realized their faux pas, and deleted the photo&#x2014;they updated their status with: &quot;GUESS WE WEREN&apos;T SUPPOSED TO POST THAT PIC :X.&quot; While Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo and Thomas Bangalter basically look exactly how we always imagined (ie, slightly more rumpled Vincent Cassel), the &quot;champagne beer pong&quot; (which really is champagne pong, right?) is what kills us. </p>

<p>Then again, considering the fact that they are basically <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429092441/http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1565721/daft-punk-scores-second-week-at-no-1-on-billboard-200-chart">keeping their record label in business</a>, Columbia should probably do whatever they can to appease the French artists&#x2014;if that means they have to break out the fancy pink cookies, then so be it. </p>
