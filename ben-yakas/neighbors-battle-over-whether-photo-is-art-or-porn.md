                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:365px; "> <img alt="3611nude.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130821044403im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/3611nude.jpg" width="365" height="548"> <br> <i><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130821044403/http://www.rafaelfuchs.com/#a=0&amp;at=0&amp;mi=2&amp;pt=1&amp;pi=10000&amp;s=3&amp;p=22">Rafael Fuchs</a></i></div> <p></p>

<p>It&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130821044403/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/28/upper_east_side_neighbor_refuses_to.php">tough</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130821044403/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/16/neighbor_tiff_over_smoking.php">enough</a> living in cramped apartment buildings with only paper thin walls to separate you from your neighbor, but trying sharing a communal space with a pornographic artist! That&apos;s the hell that Marie Nazaire has been living with: her neighbor, photographer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130821044403/http://www.rafaelfuchs.com/">Rafael Fuchs</a>, put up a photo montage featuring buxom nudes in the lobby of their Bushwick apartment building. Nazaire, who has two children, saw the piece as porn, and ripped it down. And Fuchs told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130821044403/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/naked_aggression_in_klyn_art_war_FEXALzLufDGdTukOhmk7kJ?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">the Post</a> he was a bit upset, to say the least: <strong>&quot;I was mad. I felt like I was raped.&quot;</strong></p>

<p>The battle between the two infested the rest of the building, a six-story former ribbon factory called Castle Braid that has become a mainstay for art exhibits, fashion shows and film screenings. Fuchs says Nazarie destroyed his 18-foot-long &quot;Nude Megillah&quot; piece, a one-of-a-kind worth $7,200, and she should pay him for it. &quot;It&apos;s a unique edition...The process of creating this long piece was spontaneous,&quot; Fuchs said. You can see some of his nude pieces on his website <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130821044403/http://www.rafaelfuchs.com/#a=0&amp;at=0&amp;mi=2&amp;pt=1&amp;pi=10000&amp;s=0&amp;p=21">here</a> (NSFW).</p>

<p>Eventually, the two decided to settle their disagreement the old fashioned way: by taking it to a TV court show. They taped their appearance on &quot;The People&apos;s Court&quot; with Judge Marilyn Milian this week. It will be shown on TV sometime in the next eight weeks, but if you don&apos;t want to wait that long to find out what happened, here&apos;s the verdict (spoiler alert): Milian ruled Nazaire would not have to reimburse Fuchs because he couldn&apos;t prove the work&apos;s value. </p>
