<p>While <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170914123950/http://gothamist.com/2017/02/28/jon_stewart_trump_colbert.php">Jon Stewart being delightful</a> on <em>Late Show with Stephen Colbert</em> has been dominating the morning roundups, there was plenty of other good material on late night television Monday. Seth Meyers gave a preview of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170914123950/http://gothamist.com/2017/02/28/what_time_does_trump_sulfur.php">Trump&apos;s congressional address tonight</a>, touching on Trump rambling on about the Lincoln Tunnel, his vague healthcare plans, media leaks, Trump&apos;s slow transformation into Tarzan (&quot;Melania wife. Where Melania? Trump sad.&quot;) and the fact that Stephen Miller is basically Squidward.</p>

<p>After showing one clip of Trump ranting about the media and one story in particular which cited nine sources, Meyers gave Steve Bannon a much-deserved shoutout in Trump voice: &quot;He&#x2019;s so sure it&#x2019;s not nine people. &apos;There can&#x2019;t be nine sources because we haven&#x2019;t even hired nine people yet. The only people who work at the White House are me, Spicey, Kellyanne, Frederick Douglass, and that guy [Bannon] who&#x2019;s always telling me to shut my fucking mouth. He&#x2019;s a bad dude, he scares me, that guy.&apos;&quot;</p>

<p>Colbert also picked up on Trump&apos;s anger over anonymous sources, indulging his request to the media to stop citing them and &quot;say it to my face.&quot; Colbert smooshed his face into the camera for effect and did just that: &quot;You Donald Trump are a horrible, horrible human being. Horrible.&quot;</p>

<p>He also took Cartoon Trump out of the digital cupboard to get to the heart of the reason why Trump is so terrified to attend the White House Correspondent&apos;s Dinner.</p>

<p>Over at The Daily Show, Trevor Noah also found Trump&apos;s attacks on the media to be inescapable. &quot;Wow, &apos;the enemy of the people?&apos; Now aside from that being a catchphrase made famous by Comrade Mustache over here [Stalin], it&apos;s patently untrue. The media is a vital part of any functioning Democracy.&quot; Of course, as he then discovered, the <em>entire</em> newspaper is sometimes rage-inducing, but the media is still important!</p>

<p>If you&apos;re looking for something a bit different, Jimmy Kimmel offered his perspective on what happened at the end of the Oscars broadcast on Sunday.</p>

<p>And over on Conan, O&apos;Brien shared a personal story about Bill Paxton. </p>
