<p>The Roots drummer Questlove is the closest thing we have to a Renaissance Man (give or take a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406145915/http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0984310053/welcometoholl-20?tag=vglnkc7117-20">poetry-writing cornrowed James Franco</a>)&#x2014;when he&apos;s not <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406145915/http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/18/questlove-to-teach-at-nyu/">teaching at NYU</a>, he&apos;s doing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406145915/http://www.rollingstone.com/movies/videos/fred-armisen-battles-questlove-in-fallon-drum-off-20130103">drum-offs on <em>Late Night With Jimmy Fallon</em></a>; when he&apos;s not <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406145915/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/questlove-elvis-costello-and-the-roots-recorded-a-brilliant-album-20130221">doing collaborative albums</a> with Elvis Costello, he&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406145915/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/28/photos_video_dave_chappelle_and_chr.php">hanging onstage with Dave Chappelle</a>. So of course Questlove would be the person drop the surprise news that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406145915/http://gothamist.com/tags/justintimberlake">Justin Timberlake</a> will be releasing a <em>second</em> album later this year: &#x201C;spoiler alert. 20/20 Vol 2 comes out in nov. (10 songs now&#x2026;..10 songs later= 20 vision).&quot;</p>

<p>Questlove made the comment on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406145915/http://board.okayplayer.com/okp.php?az=show_topic&amp;forum=4&amp;topic_id=11868379&amp;mesg_id=11868379&amp;page=#11868537">Okplayer&#x2019;s message board</a> while defending Timberlake&apos;s new album, <em>The 20/20 Experience</em>, after a harsh review <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406145915/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/17/arts/music/justin-timberlake-releases-the-20-20-experience.html?_r=0">in the NY Times</a>. He admitted to having some reservations about the (very long) new songs, but overall commends Timberlake and Timbaland for the ambitious album: &quot;anywho&#x2026;.i love the songs, but was worried on how he will cut the prime rib to feed to toothless babies. ballsy move however. i applaud ballsy moves.&quot; </p>

<p>After the news got out and spread to sites such as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406145915/http://consequenceofsound.net/2013/03/is-justin-timberlake-releasing-another-album-in-november/">Consequence of Sound</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406145915/http://pitchfork.com/news/49987-uestlove-says-justin-timberlake-will-release-a-second-volume-of-the-2020-experience-this-year/">Pitchfork</a>, Questlove followed up with some disappointment that it had spread so far and wide:</p>

<blockquote>friggin mofos done ran with this info snitching and shit.
this is why i really can&apos;t eff with this site no more.
back before social media i was all sharing treats and happy in our insular world.
now mofos all using my position to get their blogs posting on.</blockquote>

<p>At this point we&apos;re inclined to believe Questlove, because as stated above, <em>he&apos;s Questlove</em>. At the same time, we also believed that Radiohead was going to release a <em>King Of Limbs pt II</em> (we&apos;re still waiting to hear &quot;The Present Tense&quot;), so take it with a grain of salt.</p>
