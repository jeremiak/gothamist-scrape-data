<p>A year ago, micro penis owners across Brooklyn were the focus of Kings County Bar&apos;s first ever <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508072900/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/17/brooklyn_bar_on_the_hunt_for_the_sm.php">Smallest Penis In Brooklyn Pageant</a>&#x2014;the ultimate wet t-shirt contest for infinitesimal penises. The event was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508072900/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/21/smallest_penis_contest_brooklyn.php#photo-1">such a diminutive hit</a>, they&apos;ve decided to continue the tradition: the second annual Smallest Penis In Brooklyn Pageant will take place on Saturday, June 14th at the Bushwick bar.</p>

<p>Here&apos;s all the important info about the event for any prospective participants:</p>

<blockquote>Our expert judges will take every little thing into account, including the contestants&#x2019; poise in both evening wear and bathing wear, talent, personality, and how well they represent the ideal of a man with a small dong.  This day is about celebrating the fun-sized guys.  Well-hung men shouldn&apos;t even think about crashing, they will be ejected from the pageant and humiliated!
 
Anyone who is interested in becoming a contestant, or who would like to be a judge (little experience required), please send email to SPB.Brooklyn@gmail.com. You must be over 21, and you must be able to attend in person (no photo or video entries.)</blockquote>

<p>Admission for the day will cost $5, first come first serve; there&apos;s a limited number of VIP seats (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508072900/https://www.facebook.com/kingscountybarspb">find out more here</a>), which come with micro-bottle service and &quot;personal attention from a penis kitten.&quot; We&apos;re working on clarifying what that means. In addition to a crown, the title of Mr. Smallest Penis In Brooklyn 2014, and the undeniable envy of your peers, the winner of the contest will also receive a cash donation to the charity of his choice (which could be himself). <br>

The crowd was great as well. Everyone seemed to just relax and have a bit of fun for the afternoon, which is good.&quot;</p>
