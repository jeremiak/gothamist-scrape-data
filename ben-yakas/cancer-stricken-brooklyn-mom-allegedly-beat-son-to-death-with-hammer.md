<p>The Brooklyn mom who allegedly told police <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130613144918/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/07/brooklyn_mom_allegedly_confesses_to.php">that she killed her 7-year-old son and then attempted to commit suicide by pills</a> has been charged with murder. Mother Tenika Revell, 40, has been charged with second degree murder, manslaughter and endangering the welfare of a child in the death of her son Bernard, who was known as &quot;Little B.&quot; </p>

<p>Bernard, who was found with bruises and lacerations to his head, was bashed in his head with a hammer, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130613144918/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/new-york-episode-child-murder-days-brooklyn-mom-allegedly-kills-son-9-commit-suicide-article-1.1109576">according to the News.</a> &#x201C;She is an excellent mom. This doesn&#x2019;t make sense. If I was here it wouldn&#x2019;t have happened. She must have snapped,&#x201D; Ravell&#x2019;s cousin, Kay Jefferson, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130613144918/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/big_apple_heat_is_just_murder_2IKOYnLqEKr3zWJERDq2FK/1">told the Post.</a></p>

<p>Revell called 911 just before 11 p.m. Friday and told the operator that she killed her child and had taken pills to try to end her own life. When police arrived at her Bedford-Stuyvesant apartment, Bernard was already dead. Revell was still alive, and she was was taken to Woodhull Medical Center. Police sources said Revell had at least 33 prior arrests, including several for prostitution; she also served two separate stints in prison after being convicted of attempted robbery and attempted burglary.</p>

She added that Ravell was close with her son: &#x201C;She and her son were tight. It was always her and her son. She brought him a skateboard, a bike. She took him to the beach. She took him everywhere.&#x201D;</p>
