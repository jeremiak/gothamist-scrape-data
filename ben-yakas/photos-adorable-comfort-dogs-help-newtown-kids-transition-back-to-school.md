This week, the students who survived <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150921052440/http://gothamist.com/tags/newtownshooting">the tragic shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut</a> returned to school, only a few weeks after 20 of their classmates and six of their teachers and administrators were killed. And they weren&apos;t alone: the comfort dogs <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150921052440/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/19/photos_comfort_dogs_help_newtown_ch.php#photo-1">who visited Newtown in the immediate aftermath</a> of the shooting returned to help the children transition back to school. You can check out some photos above.</p>

<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150921052440if_/http://www.youtube.com/embed/rL7pS6WmX88" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>&#x201C;We were told that some of the students didn&#x2019;t want to come to school, but when they heard the comfort dogs would be there, they came,&#x201D; Tim Hetzner, president of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150921052440/http://lutheranchurchcharities.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;layout=blog&amp;id=25&amp;Itemid=95">Lutheran Church Charities</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150921052440/http://www.religionnews.com/2013/01/04/lutheran-comfort-dogs-welcome-students-back-to-newtown-school/">told RNS about the visit</a>. &#x201C;Some teachers also said they needed the dogs, to be able to face the students.&#x201D; Hetzner said the kids petted and stroked the dogs&#x2019; fur, gave them kisses and hugs, and some talked to them: &#x201C;One girl was sharing with the dog. She had a sibling who had died.&#x201D;</p>

<p>The dogs weren&apos;t the only ones <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150921052440/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/04/r_kelly_and_gabrielle_giffords_comf.php">offering comfort to the survivors of the shooting</a> this week: former Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, who was shot in Arizona two years ago, visited Newtown Friday for a private meeting with families of the victims. And R. Kelly released a musical tribute to the survivors of the shooting, &quot;I Know You Are Hurting.&quot;</p>
