<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170706165216/http://gothamist.com/tags/saturdaynightlive"><em>Saturday Night Live</em></a> closed the book on season 42 this weekend <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170706165216/http://gothamist.com/2017/05/21/snl_videos_dwayne_the_rock_johnson.php#photo-1">with presidential hopeful The Rock</a>, the return of David S. Pumpkins, a very ravenous Katy Perry performance, and farewells to three cast members (Bobby Moynihan, Vanessa Bayer and Sasheer Zamata). </p>

<p>After struggling to satirize the Republican presidential race last year, SNL stepped up its game this time. It was arguably the most politically-focused season for the show yet, with Trump&apos;s entrance into the Oval: Kate McKinnon made Kellyanne Conway almost relatable, Melissa McCarthy turned Sean Spicer&apos;s rage spirals into comedy gold, Beck Bennett perfectly played Putin as a shirtless puppet master, Cecily Strong was cold as ice as the impenetrable Melania Trump, Mikey Day deserves extra credit for donning the grim reaper suit to play Steve Bannon, and Alec Baldwin was at the center of it all, portraying Trump.</p>

<p>Between the noticeably sharper political parodies, the historical first time hosts (Dave Chappelle! Aziz Ansari!) and the fact that the president routinely derided the show in his various tweetstorms, this also turned out to be one of the highest rated SNL seasons in over two decades.</p>

This is all highly subjective, but think of it as a cheat sheet for the best of season 42. First up, check out the top 20 pre-taped segments and commercials. (We&apos;ll have more later this week.)</p>

<p><strong>The Best Pre-Taped Segments (aka The Digital Shorts Awards)</strong></p>

<p>During the first half of the season, there were several cinematic <strong>Melania Moments</strong> that popped up again and again to remind us that Melania has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170706165216/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sComDKkYIKQ">an inner life</a> we can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170706165216/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sJAIPM6K4o">barely fathom.</a></p>

<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170706165216if_/https://www.youtube.com/embed/LGkly56lGtM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>Kate McKinnon helped turn Kellyanne Conway into a household name, and she popped up in a series of sketches throughout the season depicting her life inside and outside the campaign. The best of those came in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170706165216/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/09/lin-manuel_miranda_hosts_saturday_n.php#photo-9">in Lin-Manuel Miranda&apos;s episode</a>, with <strong>A Day Off</strong>. (The weirdest and darkest was definitely the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170706165216/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pRt4dFBkCA"><em>Fatal Attraction</em> one with Jake Tapper</a>.)</p>

<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170706165216if_/https://www.youtube.com/embed/Zjbc15X1zSM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>In response to the rise of cable dramas masquerading as half-hour comedies, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170706165216/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/23/americas_dad_tom_hanks_hosts_snl_fo.php#photo-6">Tom Hanks led</a> the cast of <strong>Funny New Comedy</strong>, a new CBS show about a family of adjunct professors who are all diagnosed with depression on the same day.</p>

<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170706165216if_/https://www.youtube.com/embed/AMpRJwP5y9Q" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>Another great recurring bit all season was the behind-the-scenes &quot;romance&quot; between <strong>Kyle Mooney and Leslie Jones</strong>. It kicked off with a sketch in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170706165216/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/13/dave_chappelle_points_out_america_e.php#photo-11">the Chappelle episode</a>; the couple popped up in the background of several pre-taped segments; then was the subject of a full skit <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170706165216/http://gothamist.com/2017/05/14/melissa_mccarthy_snl_5_timers.php#photo-12">in the Melissa McCarthy episode</a> with Mooney and Jones dealing with their marriage problems, jealousy and their child Lorne.</p>

<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170706165216if_/https://www.youtube.com/embed/TXq02b4F0QE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170706165216if_/https://www.youtube.com/embed/vKOb-kmOgpI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p><strong>Through Donald&apos;s Eyes</strong>, from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170706165216/http://gothamist.com/2016/12/11/watch_john_cena_portray_surreal_gia.php#photo-11">the John Cena episode</a>, was arguably my favorite Trump-related sketch of the entire season.</p>

<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170706165216if_/https://www.youtube.com/embed/rJ6WuWeBoY8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>Chance The Rapper stole the show in the Obama ode <strong>Jingle Barack</strong> (though <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170706165216/http://gothamist.com/2016/12/18/casey_affleck_reps_boston_in_saturd.php#photo-6">host Casey Affleck</a> was very good as dancing Jesus).</p>

<p><strong>Hillary Actually</strong> was a lovely goodbye to Kate McKinnon&apos;s Hillary, also in the Affleck episode.</p>

<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170706165216if_/https://www.youtube.com/embed/IAhF8tPqafQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>Pete Davidson had a very stressful meet cute <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170706165216/http://gothamist.com/2017/02/05/photos_videos_kristen_stewart_drops.php#photo-11">with host Kristen Stewart</a> in <strong>Meet Cute</strong>.</p>

<p>In the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170706165216/http://gothamist.com/2017/02/12/photos_videos_alec_baldwin_as_presi.php#photo-12 ">Alec Baldwin episode</a>, Leslie Jones decided she was ready to don the orange makeup and wig in <strong>Leslie Wants To Play Trump</strong>.</p>

<p>The country finally found a conservative to cheer in <strong>Republican Movie Trailer</strong> in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170706165216/http://gothamist.com/2017/03/05/photos_videos_octavia_spencer_on_sn.php#photo-4">Octavia Spencer episode.</a></p>

<p>Cecily Strong had to deal with skeezy guys in <strong>Girl At A Bar</strong> in Spencer&apos;s episode as well.</p>

<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170706165216if_/https://www.youtube.com/embed/kTMow_7H47Q" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>The U.S. customs welcome video got some updates in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170706165216/http://gothamist.com/2017/02/05/photos_videos_kristen_stewart_drops.php#photo-4">Kristen Stewart&apos;s episode</a>.</p>

<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170706165216if_/https://www.youtube.com/embed/QDydKwmrHFo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>Also from the C.K. episode, we find out what the director behind the <strong>Pepsi Commercial</strong> was thinking.</p>

<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170706165216if_/https://www.youtube.com/embed/Pn8pwoNWseM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p><strong>Birthday Clown</strong>, one more from the C.K. episode, was also great thanks to Bobby Moynihan... although it had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170706165216/http://www.cnn.com/2017/04/12/entertainment/louis-ck-clown-snl/">a controversial origin</a>, being very similar to a short film by Tig Notaro.</p>

<p>The simple physical comedy of <strong>Basketball Scene</strong> made me laugh out loud quite a lot in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170706165216/http://gothamist.com/2017/04/16/videos_jimmy_fallon_snl_2017.php#photo-12">Jimmy Fallon episode</a>.</p>

<p><strong>The Best Fake Commercials</strong></p>

<p>Some ideas are so simple you wonder how they never existed before. Other ideas are just <strong>CHONK</strong>, like this perfect little ad from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170706165216/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/16/snl_emily_blunt.php#photo-7">Emily Blunt&apos;s episode.</a></p>
