<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501170334/http://www.businessinsider.com/author/anthony-weiner">Professional hockey commentator</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501170334/http://gothamist.com/tags/anthonyweiner">Anthony Weiner</a> has done an excellent job of not doing anything stupid in public since his comeback flameout during last summer&apos;s mayoral primaries (give or take a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501170334/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/23/weiner_finally_throws_inevitable_pl.php">pee tantrum</a>). Things were finally coming up Weiner...until today, when Our Hero had a minor but notable bump in the road on his favorite social media tool: Twitter, the place where our innermost dreams and desires are exposed to pubic scrutiny and retweets. </p>

<p>The problems started when Weiner, who has been pretty active on Twitter this year, favorited a tweet by Vox&apos;s Matt Yglesias reading, &quot;Tinder will now be the ultimate sext machine.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501170334/http://www.buzzfeed.com/andrewkaczynski/tinder-sexting-story-gets-the-anthony-weiner-favorite-on-twi">Buzzfeed has the screengrab here</a>&#x2014;of course, people thought it was <em>pretty, pretty</em> funny that a guy best known for his predilection for sexting was actively liking a sext machine.</p>

<p>Weiner purged his favorites after that, and he explained to Buzzfeed, &quot;there were a bunch of favorites there that I didn&#x2019;t either didn&#x2019;t recognize or mean to favorite. im not clear on how they got marked in the first place but I assume hit the little star thing accidentally as I scrolled through stuff.&quot; The whole &quot;I don&apos;t understand how fav&apos;ing works&quot; argument is a little hollow at this point, but hey, at least he didn&apos;t claim any <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501170334/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/29/weinergate_did_anthony_weiner_tweet.php">right wing conspiracies</a> were involved. </p>

<p>Weiner handled the utterly minor brushback well, taking it all in stride on Twitter:</p>

<p>That last one is a joke, which was lost on some:</p>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501170334/https://twitter.com/anthonyweiner">@AnthonyWeiner</a>, How do you buy 1,000 shares of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501170334/https://twitter.com/Tinder">@Tinder</a> stock when it&apos;s not publicly traded?</p>&#x2014; Dawn Kopecki (@Dawn_Kopecki) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501170334/https://twitter.com/Dawn_Kopecki/statuses/477492311178231808">June 13, 2014</a></blockquote>

<p>Anyway, the moral of this story is that everyone over 25 should probably avoid all new technologies. Also, fav&apos;ing a tweet nearly a week later is very gauche indeed.</p>
