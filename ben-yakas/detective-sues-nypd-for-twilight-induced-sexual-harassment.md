										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="31311twilight.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150808161000im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/31311twilight.jpg" width="250" height="242" class="image-left"> </span>Last year, an NYPD Chief <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150808161000/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/18/detective_allegedly_harassed_boss_w.php">was accused</a> of sexually harassing a detective by utilizing the raw sexual energy of the <em>Twilight</em> saga in a series of very hip text messages. After the allegations came out, Bronx Deputy Chief Michael Gabriel <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150808161000/http://gothamist.com/2010/06/30/twilight_cop_resigns_under_sexual_h.php">retired quietly</a>, but Detective Dawn DelValle-Sanchez was upset that the NYPD allowed him to depart in the midst of the investigation. So now, she&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150808161000/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/policewoman_bares_fangs_vs_twilight_Uy80GBJBDFSgGBBJYdEb1K?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">filed a lawsuit</a> against the the department&#x2014;and if we had ever read or seen any <em>Twilight</em> junk, we&apos;re sure we&apos;d have a jokey reference to it here!</p>

<p>DelValle-Sanchez claims that between December 2009 and April 2010, Gabriel launched a campaign of &quot;gross...unwanted attention of a personal and sexual nature,&quot; all under the &quot;pretense of practicing his texting skills.&quot; In her complaint, she says he would refer to her as &apos;Bella&apos; and himself as &apos;Jacob,&apos; &quot;equating what should have been a professional relationship to the &apos;Twilight&apos; movies.&quot; He allegedly made comments about her body and her marriage, hit on her repeatedly, and tried to give her a massage once. </p>

<p>To apologize for that awkward incident, he texted:<strong> &quot;I ask for ur forgiveness and another chance (Think Bella forgiving Jacob),&quot;</strong> and &quot;I will accept any penalty; hard labor, probation, a time out. ... Do werewolves kill humans just like vampires?&quot; She initially did not complain to the Internal Affairs Bureau because she feared they would take Gabriels side. And now she feels she&apos;s been proven right, because the department was &quot;more interested in protecting Deputy Chief Gabriel&quot; than in protecting her.</p>

<p>Over at our favorite police message board, Thee Rant, current and retired officers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150808161000/http://theerant.yuku.com/topic/30306/Bronx-NYPD-commander-accused--sexually-harassing--detective?page=2">discussed the allegations</a>, and related their own experiences with both parties&#x2014;one said of Gabriel, &quot;He was a good cop, professional, before he was a chief, though I can&apos;t speak for the recent alleged lapse in judgment or erratic behavior.&quot; They seem to agree that Gabriel, at the very least, was going through some embarrassing form of mid-life crisis, but user iluvmysmith said that the story illustrated a darker aspect to the relationship between commanding officers and female subordinates:</p>

<blockquote>Its unfortunate that the guy had to get jammed up and get his name and face in the paper. It really is. However its about time somebody got slapped around for this.  Ive seen sgt&#x2019;s, lt&#x2019;s, capt&#x2019;s, even inspectors go crazy over a piece of azz in the various command and bureaus I have been in (transit then narcotics) and it makes no sense. These so-called bosses, these career minded leaders of men, the alleged best and brightest turn into hormonal teenage boys when ever a female is present.  They will hand out favors in the form of lost time, signed 28&#x2019;s, plush assignments, even transfers in exchange for, not sex itself, but the possibility of MAYBE having a shot at having sex with these women that work in our commands. Think I&#x2019;m full of sh!t? Remember when the last impact class came out and bosses that would be caught dead at roll call came strolling around checking out the new prospects? Or how about when the new female rookie gets made the sgt operator and the sgt does all the driving?...

<p>So why then? Why does a boss who knows better if for no other reason than he&#x2019;s a boss and the subject was covered on the test to become a boss, fall into this trap time and again? Arrogance? Low self esteem? Overactive imagination ? who can say? <strong>I will say this&#x2014;when you take a test and pass, you give up the right to play grab ass&#x2026;</strong></p></blockquote><p></p>
