<p>With Colorado making recreational marijuana legal for the first time, pot has been on every pundit&apos;s mind. Jon Stewart took a long look at the media&apos;s scaremongering over it on The Daily Show last night, covering the &quot;nonsensical arguments of the marijuana-texting industrial complex,&quot; the &quot;old-timey Americana restoration hour&quot; that is Bill O&apos;Reilly&apos;s show, the hypocrisy of alcohol-guzzling morning news anchors, and best of all, the moral loopiness <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508155359/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/03/david_brooks_smoking_pot.php">of former pot inhaler David Brooks</a>. Watch the segments below.</p>

<p>O&apos;Reilly believes that pot-smoking is &quot;literally Russian roulette,&quot; except for the one exception that guns &quot;must never be criminalized and restricted in any way ever.&quot;</p>

<p>Brooks believes that pot is morally and legally wrong, now that he doesn&apos;t party so much anymore.</p>

<p>And finally, Stewart points out the fact that a lot of these news anchors really like drinking on their programs, and imagines their line of thought: &quot;I just hope I don&apos;t see any of those loser potheads while I&apos;m getting all fucked up because that would kill my totally socially acceptable alcohol buzz.&quot; Marijuana is a deadly gateway drug from which &quot;no sane person can hope to escape. But our view of alcohol is not even benign indifference, but celebratory.&quot; Hey, as long as no one gets &quot;all potted up on weed&quot; and tries to drive, it&apos;s all good, right? </p>
