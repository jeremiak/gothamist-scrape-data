<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170404144450/http://arthousecoop.com/projects/sketchbookproject">Sketchbook Project</a>, one of the most popular, fun international projects by Brooklyn-based organization Art House Co-op, is coming into town today. The project, which includes over 10,000 Moleskine sketchbooks filled with artwork by people from 104 countries, will <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170404144450/http://flavorwire.com/150368/daily-dose-pick-art-house-co-op">begin</a> a U.S. tour this month, and will be on display at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170404144450/http://arthousecoop.com/library">Brooklyn Art Library</a> in Williamsburg for the next week. </p>

<p>You can check out any of the books on one of their seven rolling shelves, which fit approximately 780 books each; artists are able to track where on the tour their book is viewed and how many times someone pulled it from the shelf.
