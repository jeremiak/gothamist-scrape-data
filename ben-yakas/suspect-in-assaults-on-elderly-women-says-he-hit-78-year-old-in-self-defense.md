Barry Baldwin claims that most of those assaults, including one against <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140309173044/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/20/78-year-old_brooklyn_woman_punched.php">a 78-year-old woman</a>, were in self-defense.  </p>

<p>Baldwin is accused of hitting the women in seven separate attacks in Canarsie and Midwood between Nov. 7th and Dec. 27th. There was no mention of the so-called &quot;knockout game&quot; in his statements about each attack. &quot;I hit a lady on the head in self-defense,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140309173044/http://nypost.com/2014/01/29/knockout-guy-i-slugged-78-year-old-other-women-in-self-defense/">he told cops about</a> the first attack on Nov. 7th. &quot;I was passing by a lady using a phone and I hit her head in self-defense because of the way she looked,&quot; Baldwin said of the last attack. </p>

<p>As for the Dec. 21st attack in which he allegedly struck a 33-year-old woman walking with her 7-year-old daughter, Baldwin told investigators that he was trying to protect his drink: &quot;There was a Dunkin&#x2019; Donuts beverage in his hand and the woman almost bumped his coffee so he swatted, but didn&#x2019;t attack her but that she had a kid with her...Defendant stated it wasn&#x2019;t a whipping, but he was trying to protect his drink. It was just a love tap.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Baldwin <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140309173044/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/knockout-suspect-bizarrely-claims-self-defense-article-1.1595801">is also accused</a> of hitting two women on Christmas Eve in separate attacks in Canarsie Park: &quot;I was passing by two ladies at the Canarsie Park but I hit them in self-defense because &#x2026; I was feeling ill.&quot;</p>
