Yesterday, a man <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140205183805/http://gothamist.com/2013/12/14/man_struck_by_train_at_union_square.php">who fell onto the subway tracks at Union Square</a> survived after he laid down on the roadbed between rails. At first, officials believed that Ralph Mercado, 55, had been struck by a northbound R train just after 11:30 p.m. on Saturday. But it turned out that the train rolled over Mercado without touching him thanks to his quick thinking. </p>

<p>&#x201C;He did like a push up and went down. It rolled right over him,&#x201D; witness Suzannah Troy, who took the video below, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140205183805/http://nypost.com/2013/12/14/man-survives-fall-on-subway-tracks-by-laying-low-in-gap/?utm_campaign=SocialFlow&amp;utm_source=NYPTwitter&amp;utm_medium=SocialFlow">told the Post</a>. &#x201C;The train was moving as slow as possible.&#x201D;</p>

<p>&#x201C;I heard screaming. He was reaching out to the people reaching out to help him, but there wasn&#x2019;t enough time to grab him,&#x201D; Troy added. &#x201C;He went back to the middle. His head turned looking at the train. [Then] he&#x2019;s right under the train! He&#x2019;s right here!&#x201D; It&apos;s still unclear how Mercado ended up on the tracks&#x2014;some witnesses say he fell, but he allegedly told cops that he jumped down to save a woman who had fallen (witnesses say there was no woman).</p>

<p>Mercado was taken to Bellevue Hospital in stable condition, where he&#x2019;s undergoing a psychological evaluation.</p>
