                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="112213walken.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20140205195009im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/112213walken.jpg" width="640" height="480"> <br> <i> (Courtesy Sergio P.)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>Last month, we saw photographic evidence that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140205195009/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ7z57qrZU8">dancing enthusiast</a> Christopher Walken was randomly picked up by two strangers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140205195009/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/22/photo_christopher_walken_hitchhikin.php">who saw him struggling to hail a cab on the Upper West Side.</a> Sergio P. told us that he and his friend Ash K., both 38, had been driving down Columbus Avenue around 9:30 a.m. on Tuesday Nov. 19th when they spotted the iconic actor: &quot;He said he was hailing a cab. Wasn&apos;t weirded out [by the situation], but did look at us both and into the car. We were really nice and told him we were fans and would be honored to give him a lift. [He was] totally cool with it.&quot; So now you know how to act if you happen to drive by Walken.</p>

<p>&quot;I have never picked up anyone. Not an actor or a random person,&quot; Sergio told us. Walken told them politely, &quot;I don&apos;t want you guys to go out of your way. I am going straight downtown and you can leave me anywhere.&quot; Sergio described a little bit of what the three men talked about as they drove from around W. 83rd Street to somewhere in the W. 40s: &quot;Since we were in NY he knew the area well but couldn&apos;t believe how much things had changed. Also told us he was born in Astoria Hospital, because my son went to St. John&apos;s High School. We talked about neighborhoods in NY and acting&#x2014;he gave [Ash] advice on acting.&quot;</p>

<p>The best part: Walken is even nicer than we imagined. &quot;We had time to talk because there was traffic but it was moving. When we stopped at his destination he didn&apos;t immediately get out. Finished the conversation and got out a few minutes after.&quot; So feel free to kindly offer Walken a ride if you see him&#x2014;it&apos;s probably better that way <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140205195009/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSRm_X3BLPU">than the other way around.</a></p>
