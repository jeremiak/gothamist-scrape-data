<p>A few years ago, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504132715/http://gothamist.com/tags/stuyvesant">Stuyvesant High School</a> was embroiled in a cheating scandal that led to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504132715/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/31/ex-stuy_principal_stan_teitel_royal.php">negative headlines</a> and high-profile firings. But according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504132715/http://nypost.com/2014/03/23/drug-abuse-soaring-at-stuyvesant-high-insiders/">a report in the Post today</a>, Stuy students have weaned themselves off of their addiction to cheating only to develop an even more insidious addiction to DRUGZ. &quot;LSD is a big thing,&quot; an anonymous teacher told them. &quot;They brag about it.&quot;</p>

<p>Of course, just because kids brag about something doesn&apos;t mean little Timmy and Betty are injecting ketamine into their eyeballs. As long as drugs have existed, teenagers have been doing them&#x2014;and as long as they do exist, teenagers will continue doing them. And whoever heard of drug abuse at a preppy NYC school?! Really, the only question is whether this particular collection of hormonal masturbation machines are doing more than their fair share of drugs. </p>

<p>In the last two academic years since the cheating scandal broke, cops have been summoned to the school 77 times by 911 calls. Seven of those were drug-related, two of those for narcotic sales. Even the students interviewed by the Post say only a small percentage of the school population uses drugs: &quot;We haven&apos;t smelled it in the bathroom in two years,&quot; one noted. </p>

<p>So no, it doesn&apos;t seem like there&apos;s a particularly crazy drug epidemic worming its way through Stuy. But it does sound like Principal Zie Zhang has been tougher than her predecessor: there were 69 &quot;principal&#x2019;s suspensions&quot; of students and 24 &quot;superintendent&#x2019;s suspensions&quot; in the 2012-2013 school year, her first in charge. There were less than 20 suspensions altogether the year before.</p>
