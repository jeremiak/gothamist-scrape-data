<p>Between the allegations of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140226194758/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1221984/Fraudster-Bernie-Madoff-cocaine-office-dubbed-North-Pole.html">rampant cocaine use</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140226194758/http://www.nydailynews.com/2.1353/bernie-madoff-wooed-robbed-blind-ex-mistress-sheryl-weinstein-claims-steamy-book-article-1.396241">George Clooney-esque charisma</a>, and a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140226194758/http://gawker.com/5340936/your-bernie-madoff-penis-size-update">winky dinky penis size</a>, it doesn&apos;t feel like we could possibly learn much more new information about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140226194758/http://gothamist.com/tags/madoff">Bernie Madoff</a> and the shenanigans that went on at his offices. And yet: new allegations surfaced this week that Madoff had been involved in a love triangle with one of five Madoff Securities workers who are currently on trial for their roles in the $65 billion Ponzi scheme.</p>

<p>According <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140226194758/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/bernie-madoff-relationship-love-triangle-employee-court-papers-article-1.1422906">to the News</a>, prosecutors declined to specify which of the five defendants was prey to Madoff&apos;s undeniable sexuality&#x2014;but that doesn&apos;t leave too many choices. That includes former secretary Annette Bongiorno (whom <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140226194758/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/pump_and_hump_eUPF1TXEW60x6KjS8UlCgJ">the Post describes</a> as &quot;his short, portly 65-year-old ex-secretary&quot;), office worker Joann Crupi (who previously told the court she has a lesbian partner and two adopted sons), or the wife of one of the three men accused in the indictment.</p>

<p>According to the suit, &quot;the government&apos;s investigation has revealed that over the course of the multi-decade fraud alleged in the indictment, a number of Madoff Securities employees and customers - including expected witnesses, defendants and others - were engaged in romantic or sexual relationships,&quot; with one another. This isn&apos;t the first time Madoff allegedly stepped out with an employee; accountant Sheryl Weinstein wrote <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140226194758/http://www.amazon.com/Madoffs-Other-Secret-Money-Bernie/dp/B003D7JTB8">a tell-all</a> about her affair with him, which included the aforementioned small penis details.</p>

<p>In other Madoff news, his only surviving son, 47-year-old Andrew, received a donor lymphocyte infusion this week to help him fight stage-four cancer. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140226194758/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/andrew-madoff-continues-battle-stage-four-cancer-article-1.1422947">He added that</a> regardless of whether he survives, it won&apos;t change his feelings toward his father: &quot;Even on my deathbed I will never forgive him for what he did.&quot;</p>
