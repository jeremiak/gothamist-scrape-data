<p>Melania Trump came out of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170128213622/http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/melania-trump-conspiracy-theorist">conspiracy theorist closet</a> this week when she gave a pair of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170128213622/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/18/melania_trump_stockholm_syndrome.php">softball interviews</a> defending her husband&apos;s good name from the bad words and worse actions he has taken. While some <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170128213622/http://www.nationalreview.com/article/441189/melania-trumps-cable-interviews-help-restore-confidence-donald-trump?utm_campaign=trueAnthem%3A+Trending+Content&amp;utm_content=58074bdf04d3017d89c07050&amp;utm_medium=trueAnthem&amp;utm_source=twitter">found strength</a> in her dedication to denying the reality of who her husband is, others tried to decipher whether she was actually blinking SOS in morse code. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170128213622/http://gothamist.com/tags/stephencolbert">Stephen Colbert</a> falls into the latter camp&#x2014;and he invited Fake Melania Trump, a.k.a. Tony award-winning actress Laura Benanti, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170128213622/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh1wctQNKRM">back on his show</a> to parody her. Watch below as Fake Melania Trump gives increasingly smoldering glances as she defends Trump&apos;s disgusting decision to ride on a bus, while definitely not being coached and/or held at gunpoint by an unseen man off-camera.</p>

<p>&quot;He explained it was locker room talk,&#x201D; she said. &quot;I did not know this, but when American men gather to sport they always brag of grabbing women by the Billy Bush.&quot; When she described her husband&#x2019;s comments as &#x201C;boy talk,&#x201D; Colbert interjected, &quot;I hate to point this out, but your husband isn&#x2019;t a boy, he&#x2019;s a 70-year-old man.&quot; She responded, &quot;Boys, men &#x2014; it&#x2019;s the same. No matter how nice they seem, secretly they&#x2019;re all foul-mouthed Billy Bush-grabbing pigs. They&#x2019;re all animals. If only a woman could be president.&quot;</p>

<p>The Daily Show also took a closer look at Melania&apos;s interviews, and found they were eerily similar. On the bright side, Trevor Noah pointed out, &#x201C;at least she&#x2019;s only plagiarizing herself now.&quot;</p>

<p>In the words <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170128213622/http://thehill.com/blogs/in-the-know/in-the-know/301738-ivanka-trump-reacts-to-accusations-against-father">of Ivanka Trump</a>: &quot;I will say, I can&apos;t wait till the election is over.&quot;</p>
