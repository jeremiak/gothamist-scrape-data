title: Be On The Lookout For West Village Bench Thief

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none" style=" width:480px; "> <img alt="22411bench.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110225105854im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/22411bench.jpg" width="480" height="640"> <br> <i>via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110225105854/http://paperandstring.com/nyc/west-village/news/alert-bench-thief-strikes-mepa">Paper and String</a></i></div> <p></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110225105854/http://paperandstring.com/nyc/west-village/news/alert-bench-thief-strikes-mepa">Paper and String reports</a> that there may be a bench thief on the loose in the West Village. They stumbled upon a handwritten sign demanding the return of a communal bench near 647 Hudson Street. It reads: &#x201C;Whoever stole our bench. Please return it. It has been with us for over 25 years and means alot to us and our neighborhood.&#x201D; Could someone just have wanted a bench in their apartment to throw their dirty laundry onto? Or is this some kind of conspiracy?</p>

<p>A bench really doesn&apos;t seem like the most convenient item to pilfer. In the past, some local businesses downtown have removed their benches because they didn&apos;t want people &quot;living&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110225105854/http://gothamist.com/2010/08/19/american_apparel_removes_once_famou.php">outside their store</a> anymore. So perhaps a neighboring store didn&apos;t appreciate the late-night crowds the local bench attracted. Maybe it&apos;ll mysteriously turn up <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110225105854/http://gothamist.com/2007/12/20/mysterious_tall.php">on tall stilts</a> on Houston Street. Or maybe this is the first step toward some diabolical advertising campaign, like the creepy one a clothing store in New Zealand is currently using&#x2014; Superette <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110225105854/http://consumerist.com/2011/02/we-hope-this-is-real-metal-plates-on-benches-leave-ads-indented-on-ladies-legs.html">installed plates</a> on benches which imprint their ad onto the back of bare legs. After all, one man&apos;s &quot;veritable army of free media&quot; is another man&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110225105854/http://gothamist.com/tags/upskirt">upskirt perv</a>. </p>
