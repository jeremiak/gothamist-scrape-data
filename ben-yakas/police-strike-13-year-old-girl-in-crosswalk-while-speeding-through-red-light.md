<p>Police officers struck a teen girl in The Bronx early Saturday morning while speeding through a red light. FDNY confirmed that a 13-year-old girl was hit on Grand Concourse near East 170th Street just after midnight; the victim, who hasn&apos;t been identified, was taken to Jacobi Hospital in serious condition.</p>

<p>Witnesses <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140625013729/http://nypost.com/2014/06/21/girl-struck-by-cop-car-speeding-through-crosswalk/">told the Post</a> that the girl had the crosswalk: &quot;The cop car was going north on Grand Concourse and had just given someone a ticket when it sped off through a red light and hit the girl in the crosswalk,&quot; said witness Charles Simpson. Cops told them the car was responding to a stabbing nearby and had its lights and siren on.</p>

<p>Multiple witnesses said the victim looked severely injured: &#x201C;She was mangled. She was all twisted up. She was bleeding from the mouth and neck,&#x201D; said a witness named Erica.</p>
