<p>What&apos;s the deal with ticket prices to see Jerry Seinfeld in London? The &quot;lord of the manor&quot; is performing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406145217/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-12016896">one night</a> at London&apos;s 20,000-capacity O2 Arena on June 3, his first UK gig since July 1998. British fans were already upset that ticket prices were high to begin with (between $108-155); but hours after the show was put on sale, the prices had already <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406145217/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/international/seinfeld_tix_top_in_london_e0BL7YRhWDXznXnmSwQPgO?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">rocketed up</a> to over a thousand dollars a piece thanks to ticket scalpers. </p>
