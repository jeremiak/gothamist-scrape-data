<p>This week, a man was arrested <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506102630/http://gothamist.com/2014/08/15/pregnant_woman_punched_in_knockout.php">for punching a seven-months pregnant woman</a> who was walking in Brooklyn. Suspect Willie Stephens, 33, allegedly attacked 34-year-old Jannatul Ferdous at 3:45 p.m. on Thursday as Ferdous walked with a friend down Monroe Street near Ralph Avenue in Bedford-Stuyvesant. &quot;She was lying on the ground and this guy was standing there laughing after he hit her,&quot; the friend, Nasrin Akter, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506102630/http://pix11.com/2014/08/15/pregnant-woman-struck-down-in-the-street-by-random-passerby/">told PIX</a>. &quot;I was just so scared for the baby.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He didn&#x2019;t say anything,&quot; Ferdous, through a translator, told PIX about the attack. &quot;A man was walking toward us and then he just hit me.&quot; Stephens allegedly hit her in the head, knocking her unconscious. &quot;I was scared and worried about the baby,&quot; Ferdous, who  moved to Brooklyn three years ago from Bangladesh with her 40-year-old husband,<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506102630/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/pregnant-woman-punched-brooklyn-knockout-game-cops-article-1.1905251"> told the News.</a></p>

<p>Thankfully, the baby was not hurt during the incident: &quot;I&#x2019;m happy he&#x2019;s in jail because he can&#x2019;t hurt anyone else,&quot; Ferdous said. &quot;The baby is perfectly fine and we&#x2019;re going to press charges. He needs to serve his time. We want to stop him from hurting someone else.&quot;</p>

<p>Stephens, who lives at a shelter in East New York, has been charged with attempted assault as a hate crime. Initial reports indicated this might be a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506102630/http://gothamist.com/tags/knockoutgame">knockout game assault</a>, but he&apos;s charged with a hate crime because prosecutors believe he targeted her because she was wearing a burka. Stephens&apos; lawyer refuted that: &quot;I have complete sympathy for this victim, but we&apos;re disputing some of the facts,&quot; attorney Mike Pate told the News. &quot;There is no evidence whatsoever that this is a hate crime.&quot;</p>
