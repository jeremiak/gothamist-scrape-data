But Bloomberg is also a pragmatist, so the fact he needs his own private Dassault Falcon 900 jets to travel is justifiable, despite the carbon contradiction. But after a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170404182349/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/17/ray_kelly_feature.php">mention</a> by NYPD Commisioner Ray Kelly that he gets lifts to Florida for vacations by the Mayor, it begs the question: who else exactly is getting lifts on Air Bloomberg?<p></p>

<p>In last week&apos;s NY Magazine profile on Kelly, Kelly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170404182349/http://nymag.com/news/crimelaw/66025/index4.html">discusses</a> the perks of being close friends with the Mayor:</p>

<blockquote>Kelly and Bloomberg get along so well Bloomberg gives Kelly lifts on his private jet. Bloomberg goes to Bermuda. Kelly and his wife get off in Florida, where they have a weekend retreat.

<p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s great,&#x201D; Kelly says of flying Air Bloomberg. &#x201C;Only way to travel.&#x201D;</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>It&apos;s well known the Mayor uses the plane frequently to travel to Bermuda, where he is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170404182349/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/26/bloomberg_beloved_in_bermuda.php">&quot;beloved.&quot;</a> As the Daily News <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170404182349/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/05/23/2010-05-23_mikes_jet_setters_kelly_and_quinn_fly_high_on_the_sly_on_air_bloomberg.html">points out</a>, the Mayor doesn&apos;t disclose his private jet manifesto, neither who was on it nor where it goes. No such trips have been mentioned on disclosure forms by Kelly since 2004. </p>

<p>The News <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170404182349/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/05/23/2010-05-&lt;br /&gt;
23_mikes_jet_setters_kelly_and_quinn_fly_high_on_the_sly_on_air_bloomberg.html">talked</a> to two longtime Bloomberg staffers who were &quot;stunned&quot; at the report that the Mayor gave Kelly a lift for a vacation. The paper posits the possible ethical implications: <strong>&quot;what&apos;s the difference between a boss giving his underling a lift on his jet and the boss giving his underling a couple of airline tickets?&quot;</strong></p>
