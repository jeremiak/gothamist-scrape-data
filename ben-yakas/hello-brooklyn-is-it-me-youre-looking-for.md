										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="3611richie.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429125207im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/3611richie.jpg" width="370" height="387" class="image-left"> </span>We were somewhere feeling lonely, and then we saw this sign: at the end of the week, the above picture of a homemade Lionel Richie tear-off sign <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429125207/http://thedailywh.at/2011/03/04/lost-sign-of-the-day-2/">made the rounds</a> on the internet, delighting people everywhere. And today, the sign <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429125207/http://twitpic.com/46uzun">was spotted</a> in Brooklyn!</p>

<p>Of course, who could forget the classic <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429125207/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDZcqBgCS74">music video</a> for the song &quot;Hello,&quot; in which Richie falls in love with a blind girl, who eventually is able to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429125207/http://www.macalester.edu/~fines/lionel/">sculpt his head</a>. We&apos;re not sure where the original sign was posted, but a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429125207/http://i.imgur.com/L9KpH.jpg">template</a> has been made so that anyone can print out a copy and post it in their neighborhood, as it should be. After all, that&apos;s what Herbert Hoover meant when he said, &quot;A chicken in every pot and a Lionel Richie on every street.&quot; </p>

<p>Since it&apos;s too rainy outside right now to go on a Richie treasure hunt, below you can check out our two favorite &quot;Hello&quot;-related videos; one of Richie singing the song after inhaling helium, and the other a tender moment for Jerry Seinfeld.</p>
