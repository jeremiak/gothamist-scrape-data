</div></div>					<p>Recently, we learned that street vendors <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429152303/http://gothamist.com/2012/08/19/bottled_water.php">have been jacking up the price of bottled water</a> to $3 a pop&#x2014;which is absurd for several reasons, not least of which is that we have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429152303/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/05/what_else_is_in_your_tap_water_besi.php">arguably the best tap water</a> in the country, with more than one billion gallons a day piped in from the Catskills and elsewhere to our homes, businesses and parks. There&apos;s no need for <em>anyone</em> to pay money to quench their thirst in this city! To that end, we enlisted drinking fountains aficionado Jacob Daniels to help guide us around the best drinking fountains in Manhattan.
