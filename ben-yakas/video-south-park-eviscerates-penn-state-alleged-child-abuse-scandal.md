<p>As <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120518020617/http://www.centredaily.com/2011/11/16/2988948/interview-with-joe-amendola-and.html">more and more</a> twisted details about the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120518020617/http://gothamist.com/tags/pennstate">Penn State scandal</a> and former coach Jerry Sandusky&apos;s alleged sexual abuse of children comes to light, it seems as though there&apos;s no end to this horrible story. Moreover, there doesn&apos;t seem to be any appropriate way to be humorous about this scandal&#x2014;but that didn&apos;t stop <em>South Park</em> from hilariously ripping the whole thing last night with a seemingly endless slew of purposefully terrible jokes about the terrible subject (as well as a hefty dose of self-awareness). Watch a supercut (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120518020617/http://www.sbnation.com/ncaa-football/2011/11/17/2568387/penn-state-south-park-video">via SB Nation</a>) of all the Penn State-related jokes below:</p>

<p>After all the painful one-liners (&quot;Two Penn State administrators walk into a butt&quot;) and comparisons (&quot;You&apos;re going to be put into a foster home, so I need to know: would you like to go to Neverland Ranch, a Catholic Church or Penn State University&quot;), the show makes it clear that, as SB Nation points out, &quot;The only thing funny about this entire thing could be people trying to make something funny out of it.&quot; That self-awareness is the element which helped the episode elevate itself above trite mockery or shock comedy. And who else but <em>South Park</em> could make a line like, &quot;And it also says here that Penn State prefers to be losing at halftime, because at Penn State they like when you&apos;re a little behind in the locker room,&quot; completely, inappropriately funny?</p>
