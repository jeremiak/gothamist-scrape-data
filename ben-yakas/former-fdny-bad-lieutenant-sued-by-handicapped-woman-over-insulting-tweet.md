<p>Last spring, an EMS lieutenant who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130922035139/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/24/ems_bad_lieutenant_cries_when_racis.php">tweeted a bevy of racist, antisemitic comments</a> was suspended after he hit the front page of the NY Post. EMS Lt. Timothy Dluhos, 34, who went by the moniker &quot;Bad Lieutenant,&quot; ultimately <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130922035139/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/28/racist_bad_lieutenant_resigns_from.php">chose to resign</a> from the FDNY to avoid any potential disciplinary charges that could have led to his firing after his suspension was up. Today, he&apos;s learning yet again that actions have consequences (especially when the Post is involved): Dluhos and the city <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130922035139/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-emt-sued-wide-load-tweet-woman-article-1.1460381">are being sued</a> by the Brooklyn woman whose photo he tweeted (see above) along with the caption &#x201C;Wide Load.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Teena Gamzon, 65, who uses a wheelchair and has diabetes, filed the suit this week asking for unspecified damages for &#x201C;mental anguish, ridicule [and] emotional and mental distress.&#x201D; &#x201C;It was horrible,&#x201D; she <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130922035139/http://nypost.com/2013/09/19/bad-lieutenant-sued-by-wheelchair-woman/">told The Post</a>. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m even embarrassed in front of my granddaughter. She&#x2019;s 10 years old. She has to see her grandmother humiliated like that.&#x201D;</p>

<p>In the suit, she claims publication of the photo on the front page of The Post (&quot;and also on the Daily Mail, Huffington Post, and Gothamist Web sites&quot;) caused her to be &#x201C;confined to a bed and home for a period of time.&#x201D; Her lawyer told the News that his client is now confined to her home with shame.</p>
