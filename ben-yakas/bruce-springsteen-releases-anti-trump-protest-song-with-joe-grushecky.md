<p>American dream aficionado <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171024035202/http://gothamist.com/tags/brucespringsteen">Bruce Springsteen</a> has made no secret of his distaste for the 45th president of the United States, but he&apos;s kept his commentary to interviews and concert asides so far. Today, however, he announced that he teamed up with frequent collaborator Joe Grushecky for the release an outright anti-Trump <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171024035202/http://gothamist.com/2017/02/17/protest_songs_nyc_history.php">protest song</a> titled, &quot;That&#x2019;s What Makes Us Great.&quot;</p>

<p>The song is available to purchase from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171024035202/http://www.joegrushecky.com/">Grushecky&apos;s website here</a> (but will be on iTunes and various streaming services later today). Grushecky <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171024035202/http://www.post-gazette.com/ae/music/2017/04/18/Joe-Grushecky-Bruce-Springsteen-That-s-What-Makes-Us-Great-Houserockers-protest-song-Trump/stories/201704180186?curator=MusicREDEF&amp;pgpageversion=pgevoke">told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette</a> that he wrote the song around the time Donald Trump took office in January.</p>

<p>&quot;I had this song, and Bruce and I had been talking,&quot; he explained. &quot;I sent it to him and he liked it. I said, &apos;What do you think about singing on it?&apos; He gave it the Bruce treatment.&quot; Springsteen has the best verse in the song, referencing Trump&apos;s comments <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171024035202/http://ew.com/books/2017/01/25/trump-does-not-read-books-report/">that he doesn&apos;t read books</a> (and thus tangentially referencing the conspiracy theory that Trump <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171024035202/http://digg.com/video/trump-cant-read-samantha-bee">is functionally illiterate</a>): &quot;Don&#x2019;t tell me a lie/ And sell it as a fact/ I&#x2019;ve been down that road before/ And I ain&#x2019;t goin&#x2019; back/ And don&#x2019;t you brag to me/ That you never read a book/ I never put my faith/ In a con man and his crooks.&quot;</p>

<p>Grushecky, a former teacher, also explained his own reasons for writing an anti-Trump song: &quot;[Trump] lost me the moment he started <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171024035202/http://gothamist.com/2015/11/26/video_donald_trump_hatefully_mocks.php">making fun of special needs people</a>,&quot; he said. &quot;How could a person like that be president of the United States? Regardless of all the other [stuff], that to me is appalling. I have special needs people in my family and in my neighborhood. I worked with special needs people my whole life and I was really offended by it.&quot;</p>

<p>Back in January, Springsteen <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171024035202/http://gothamist.com/2017/01/30/bruce_springsteen_calls_trumps_musl.php">called Trump&apos;s travel ban</a> &quot;anti-democratic and fundamentally un-American,&quot; and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171024035202/http://gothamist.com/2017/01/23/springsteen_womens_march.php">praised the Women&apos;s March</a> as &quot;the new American resistance.&quot; </p>

<p>Springsteen, who received the Presidential Medal Of Freedom from President Obama in November, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171024035202/http://gothamist.com/2017/01/03/bruce_springsteen_trump.php">also spoke to Marc Maron</a> about his deep fears for the country and Trump&apos;s divisive mendacity. &quot;When you let that genie out of the bottle &#x2014; bigotry, racism, intolerance... they don&#x2019;t go back in the bottle that easily if they go back in at all,&quot; Springsteen said. &quot;Whether it&#x2019;s a rise in hate crimes, people feeling they have license to speak and behave in ways that previously were considered un-American and are un-American. That&#x2019;s what he&#x2019;s appealing to. So my fears are that those things find a place in ordinary, civil society.&quot; (In another interview, he was ever <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171024035202/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/bruce-springsteen-calls-donald-trump-a-moron-w441761">more blunt</a>: &quot;The republic is under siege by a moron.&quot;)</p>

<p>Don&apos;t expect too many other Bruce-penned protest songs about Trump coming our way anytime soon though: The Boss is expected to release a new solo album this year that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171024035202/https://www.jimmywebb.com/the-news/2016/9/7/bruce-springsteen-cites-jimmy-webb-and-glen-campbell-as-influences-on-new-album">he has compared</a> to the work of Jimmy Webb &amp; Glenn Campbell (&quot;pop records with a lot of strings and instrumentation&quot;).</p>
