If we had our way, every subway token booth in NYC would be transitioned into permanent puppy homes. Unfortunately, society hasn&apos;t quite caught up with us yet&#x2014;so we&apos;ll have to be satisfied with the knowledge that at least 19 dogs have new jobs with the MTA. You can see some candid photos from their K9 graduation above.</p>

<p>All 19 pups went through 12 weeks of intense anti-terrorism and bomb-detection training at an upstate farm. When they first arrived, most of them couldn&apos;t tell their tail from their snout: &quot;We call them green dogs because they don&#x2019;t know anything,&quot; officer Allen Kirsch, whose new partner Sentry graduated at the ceremony, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406162041/http://nypost.com/2014/06/13/k-9-police-cadets-graduate-in-special-ceremony/">told the Post</a>. &quot;They come full of energy and no obedience.&quot; Though this is an ideal state of doggyinnocenceness, we must drag them into the cynical arms of Maturity so they can do their jobs like the rest of us. </p>

<p>Twelves of the pups <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406162041/http://www.mta.info/news-canine-unit-k-9-unit-mta-pd/2014/06/13/19-canine-officers-graduate-mta-police-training">will join</a> their human partners in active duty inspecting unattended or suspicious packages and patrolling the trains, stations, tracks and facilities of the Long Island Rail Road, Metro-North Railroad and Staten Island Railway. Another seven pups will join the NYPD, Putnam County Sheriff&#x2019;s Office, and the police departments of Brewster and Warwick, NY. </p>

<p>The dogs joining the MTA Police are Augie, Chief, Daehan, Foxy, Geo, Holland, Joey, Mac, Patriot, Sentry, T.J. and Vinny. The seven joining the MTA&#x2019;s sister agencies are Blue, Boomer, Dante, Falco, Nox, Sentinel and Tank.</p>

<p>These 19 follow in the footsteps of pioneering police dogs, including <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406162041/http://gothamist.com/2009/10/03/rip_taz_the_last_911_search-and-res.php">Taz</a> (the last 9/11 search-and-rescue dog), <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406162041/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/03/heroic_k9_pup_blaze_retires.php">Blaze</a> (a gun-sniffing legend), <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406162041/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/02/scooby_the_nypd_bloodhound_dies.php">Scooby</a> (a bloodhound with a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406162041/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/16/video_remembering_scooby_the_heroic.php">nose for Justice</a>), and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406162041/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/26/photos_injured_k9_dog_bear_leaves_h.php#photo-1">Bear</a> (who was injured in the line of duty last year).</p>
