<p>How closely do you pay attention to the bill at the end of a meal? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406162737/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/rounding_up_eatery_violators_LTahFUGp1ZYKOdgmjQL2LP?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Local">The NY Post thinks you probably haven&apos;t been,</a> because restaurants have been ripping you off of your loose change. They claim that &quot;some&quot; NYC restaurants have been rounding up bills to the next dollar, which is illegal, mainly because counting change slows things down...and they&apos;ve shamed at least one Clinton Hill mainstay for doing so.</p>

<p>The Post calls out Dutch Boy Burger in Crown Heights; in August, one patron noticed her bill had a 47-cent &#x201C;rounding&#x201D; fee, which brought the total of her $6 meal with tax to $7. &#x201C;That is my money you literally just took for absolutely no reason besides being too lazy to go to the cash register in the next room,&#x201D; she wrote on Yelp. </p>

<p>Dutch Boy owner Matt Roff called it a computer error, while acknowledging it was a practice they had employed in the past: &#x201C;We figured a loss for us or the customer of one to four pennies was understandable, but we were then made aware that the system had been rounding to the dollar,&#x201D; Roff said. &#x201C;We stopped that method a long time ago.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Have you encountered this before? Would you care if a restaurant charged you up to 50 cents extra, if it meant you didn&apos;t have to end up like this guy?</p>
