<p>You thought it was bad that the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141022143555/http://gothamist.com/tags/rtrain">R train</a> tunnel connecting Manhattan and Brooklyn will be shutdown for over a year? Well here&apos;s the cherry on top: the Greenpoint Tube, which connects the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141022143555/http://gothamist.com/tags/gtrain">G train</a> between Queens and Brooklyn, will be shuttered for 12 weekends starting this summer. And THEN next year, it will be closed 24/7 for five weeks over the summer. As if the G train <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141022143555/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/29/the_g_train_sucks_and_other_dating.php">wasn&apos;t ruining enough lives as it is.</a></p>

<p>According to the MTA, power cables in the tube that were immersed in salt water are corroding from the inside, while corrosion on the outside of rails and fasteners raises the potential for short circuits. The controls for ventilation, lighting and communication systems were destroyed and have not been restored to their pre-Sandy condition. </p>

<p>The Greenpoint Tube, which carries the G train under Newtown Creek, will be closed for twelve, 53-hour long weekends starting July 6. The northernmost three stops&#x2014;<strong>Greenpoint Avenue, 21st Street and Court Square</strong>&#x2014;will be closed during these weekend shutdowns. G trains will still operate to and from Church Avenue and Nassau Avenue; a shuttle bus linking the shuttered stops will be provided.</p>

<p>The closures are planned to start at midnight on each Friday of the following weekends: <strong>July 6-7, 13-14, 20-21; August 3-4, 10-11, 17-18, 24-25; September 7-8, 28-29; October 5-6; December 7-8, and 14-15.</strong> Then everything will be dandy, until next summer, when it shuts down for five hellish consecutive weeks in a row. And, of course, let&apos;s just all hope we don&apos;t have another superstorm in the fall, because that would really put a crimp in everything.</p>
