Over 450 skaterboarding enthusiasts took over Broadway yesterday, darting past cabs and pedestrians alike for the annual &quot;illegal&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160324025315/http://bwaybomb.tumblr.com/">Broadway Bomb</a> event, a skating race across Manhattan. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160324025315/http://blog.broadwaybomb.com/">&quot;world&apos;s most dangerous skateboard race&quot;</a> started at w 116th street by Riverside Park, and ended at the <em>Charging Bull</em> statue at Bowling Green. The race was started by three skaters in 2001 who challenged each other to skate the full length of Broadway to the bull, and not get killed in the process. You can see a video of yesterday&apos;s event below.</p>
