<p>When he&apos;s not getting into <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150420113312/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/10/alec_baldwins_starbucks_tweet_inspi.php">Starbucks-related grudge matches</a> with the NY Post or re-tweeting videos of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150420113312/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2wag9ayuTU&amp;feature=youtu.be">his girlfriend&apos;s yoga routines</a>, mayor-in-training <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150420113312/http://gothamist.com/tags/alecbaldwin">Alec Baldwin</a> will often dive into his political beliefs&#x2014;and Baldwin has made no secret of supporting the Occupy Wall Street movement. And around midnight, Baldwin finally got a chance to head down to Zuccotti Park and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150420113312/http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/2011/10/alec_baldwin_occupy_wall_street.php">speak with protesters</a>. Watch video of the historic moment below:</p>

<p>Baldwin spent <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150420113312/http://twitter.com/#!/AlecBaldwin/status/126533611469021184">&quot;a too brief two hours&quot;</a> at the park talking to protesters, and helping with cleaning up going on. Reactions to Baldwin visiting was mixed. Bucky Turco of AnimalNY <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150420113312/http://twitter.com/#!/buckyturco/status/126647562617884672">tweeted</a>, &quot;As long as @AlecBaldwin doesn&apos;t call any of the #ows protesters a &quot;little pig,&quot; I&apos;m cool with him supporting the movement.&quot; Aaron Stewart-Ahn <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150420113312/http://twitter.com/#!/somebadideas/status/126523120239648768">was less enthusiastic</a>: &quot;Hearing @alecbaldwin is at @occupywallstnyc discussing influence of corporate $$$. He&apos;s an expert in this field, as a shill for Capitol One.&quot;</p>

<p>To his credit, Baldwin addressed his association with Capitol One, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150420113312/http://twitter.com/#!/AlecBaldwin/status/126540438411812864">defended the company</a>: &apos;I donated all of my fee from Capital One 2 arts charities. They have been gr8 partners in my support of the arts.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150420113312/http://twitter.com/#!/AlecBaldwin/status/126540835989893120">He added</a>, &quot;We need a healthy banking system in this country. We need strong capital markets. What is missing are regulations with teeth.&quot;</p>

<p>Alec isn&apos;t the only Baldwin offering his support to OWS: Billy Baldwin was there too this week (watch below)! We&apos;re still holding our breath waiting for <em>Bio-Dome</em> star <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150420113312/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/15/baldwin_vs_baldwin_stephen_hints_at.php">Stephen Baldwin</a> to weigh in, though.</p>
