<p>Approximately <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405032548/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/18/the_american_dream_in_action_homele.php">50,000 people spend the night</a> in NYC homeless shelters, according to the city&#x2019;s Department of Homeless Services. There are more people languishing on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405032548/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/24/amount_of_people_waiting_for_public.php">waiting list for public housing</a> than there are total public housing units in NYC. There is a serious <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405032548/http://gothamist.com/tags/homelessness">homelessness epidemic</a> happening in NYC that has not been seen since the Great Depression. And to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405032548/http://gothamist.com/tags/bloomberg">Mayor Michael &quot;Foot In Mouth&quot; Bloomberg</a>, all of these things are first and foremost &quot;good signs&quot; of a vibrant economy. &#x201C;Somebody said that there&#x2019;s not enough housing. That&#x2019;s a good sign. It doesn&#x2019;t mean it isn&#x2019;t a problem, but there are no vacancies,&#x201D; he said.</p>

<p>&#x201C;That will bring in investment, for people to build for all income levels, different kinds of housing,&quot; he said during his weekly radio appearance. &quot;In cities, if you want to have lots of vacancies where everybody could easily find a place, you don&#x2019;t have a good economy.&quot; Like with a lot of things Bloomberg says&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405032548/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2013/09/20/bloomberg-more-billionaires-moving-to-nyc-would-be-godsend/">more billionaires in NYC would be &quot;godsends&quot;</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405032548/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/23/bloombergs_advice_for_success_dont.php">don&apos;t go to the bathroom if you want to be successful</a>&#x2014;the point he&apos;s trying to make is eclipsed by his lack of empathy, and his inability to stop himself from sounding like Scrooge McDuck.</p>

<p>&#x201C;It is better to have the problem of a city that&#x2019;s growing than a city that&#x2019;s shrinking,&#x201D; Benjamin Dulchin, executive director of the Association of Neighborhood and Housing Developers in New York City, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405032548/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/bloomberg-calls-housing-crisis-good-sign-vibrant-economy-article-1.1489903">told the Daily News</a>. &#x201C;The rezoning this administration has done to encourage development is largely market-rate housing. There&#x2019;s a lot of building going on, but it is not necessarily what our population needs.&#x201D; This year, the waiting list for affordable housing has soared to 270,000 people; the total amount of public housing units in New York City (which are all occupied) is 178,900.</p>

<p>Bloomberg has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405032548/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/17/ny_times_gives_interactive_tour_sho.php">radically changed the skyline of NYC</a> through new housing and rezoning, but very little of that has gone toward public housing. He&apos;s been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405032548/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/11/bloomberg_administration_sued_for_p.php">sued by the City Council</a> for trying to lease public housing developments&apos; land to private luxury high rise developers. And he hasn&apos;t exactly been a sympathetic figure in the past toward those people in need: he&apos;s shown a tone deafness with low income families by suggesting the city <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405032548/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/17/bloomberg_wants_to_fingerprint_publ.php">fingerprint public housing residents</a>, and make them scan in using a fingerprint scanner.</p>

<p>&#x201C;The affordable housing crisis has gotten worse on his watch,&quot; Craig Gurian, of the Anti-Discrimination Center in NYC, told the News. &quot;He&#x2019;s literally out of touch. He doesn&#x2019;t experience what most people in the city are experiencing, which is a much greater sense of insecurity than they felt 12 years ago.&quot;<br>
