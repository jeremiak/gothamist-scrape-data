<p>A 9-year-old boy was killed, and three others were injured after an out-of-control SUV driver jumped the curb in Fort Greene earlier today. According to police, the incident happened on the corner of Dekalb and Clermont Avenues in Fort Greene about 12:45 p.m. Saturday. The red Ford SUV was driving westbound on Dekalb when it careened into another car as it turned left onto Clermont. The Ford then jumped the curb, striking a 47-year-old mother who was walking with her two children.</p>

<p>The 9-year-old was pinned by the car and pronounced dead at the scene. The mother, her other 5-year-old child and an 18-year-old woman (whom police do not believe was related to the family) were rushed to Kings County Hospital. Police add that the driver remained at the scene and no criminality is suspected at this time, but the investigation is ongoing.</p>

<p>The NYPD <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501163625/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/31/brooklyn_drivers_got_to_speed_throu.php">did not issue a single speeding citation last month</a> in Brooklyn&apos;s 76th and 78th Precincts (which include Red Hook, Carroll Gardens, Cobble Hill, Gowanus, or Park Slope). Park Slope&apos;s 78th Precinct includes the spot where 12-year-old <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501163625/http://gothamist.com/tags/samuelcohen-eckstein">Samuel Cohen-Eckstein</a> was struck by a van and killed earlier this month as he ran to retrieve his ball on Prospect Park West.</p>

According to an analysis of 2011 traffic data by Transportation Alternatives, speeding drivers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501163625/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/16/brooklyn_drivers_kill_the_most_peop.php">kill more people in Brooklyn than any other borough</a>, and 88% of Brooklyn drivers break the 30 mph speed limit.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> The NYPD has arrested the driver, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501163625/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/03/nypd_arrests_driver_who_fatally_str.php">more here</a>.</p>
