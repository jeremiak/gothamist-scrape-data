<p>A man was fatally struck by a train in Harlem last night. According to police, the 20-year-old man was struck by a southbound 1 train at the City College station at Broadway &amp; West 137th Street around 9 p.m. Friday night. Police add that there does not appear to be any criminality involved.</p>

<p>So far this year, 78 people have been struck by trains, resulting in 30 deaths&#x2014;which means we&apos;re on pace to exceed the 2012 totals, when 141 people were hit by trains, with 55 fatalities. To try to stop at least some incidents, Queens Councilman Peter Vallone, Jr. is pushing for subway track intrusion technology: &quot;This would alert the driver of the train to the fact that something is on those tracks and slow them down or stop that before someone gets hit or killed,&quot; he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130729112608/http://www.ny1.com/content/top_stories/183852/mta-investigating-methods-to-detect-people-on-tracks">told NY1.</a></p>

<p>There was at least one other subway incident yesterday that had a happier ending: an off-duty Con Edison supervisor helped save an intoxicated man who fell onto the tracks at the Lincoln Center 1 train stop around 5:40 a.m. &quot;He turned around. He came towards me. I grabbed him and I pulled him up off the tracks and pulled him onto the platform, and shortly after, the train came,&quot; Thomas Rowan <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130729112608/http://www.ny1.com/content/top_stories/183867/ny1-exclusive--con-ed-supervisor-discusses-rescue-of-man-who-fell-on-manhattan-subway-track">told NY1</a>. &quot;So he was lucky, &apos;cause I don&apos;t think that the train got a signal to stop.&quot;</p>
