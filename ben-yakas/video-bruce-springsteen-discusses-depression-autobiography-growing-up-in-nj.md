<p>Coming off one of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170626150108/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/28/springsteen_msg_river_review.php">the best</a> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170626150108/http://www.ew.com/article/2016/09/08/bruce-springsteen-breaks-us-record-longest-show">and longest</a>) E-Street Band tours in recent years, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170626150108/http://gothamist.com/tags/brucespringsteen">Bruce Springsteen</a> is showing no signs of slowing down&#x2014;The Boss is gearing up to release his autobiography at the end of the month, and he talked to CBS Sunday Morning today about the project, as well as his childhood, his struggles with depression, and the fire that drives his work: &quot;I believe every artist has someone who told them they aren&apos;t worth dirt, and someone who told them they were the second coming of the baby Jesus, and that&apos;s the fuel that stirs the fire.&quot;</p>

<p>Springsteen and host Anthony Mason  walk around Springsteen&apos;s hometown of Freehold, NJ (&quot;I may still cruise through once in awhile...they say you&apos;re looking to make things alright again, and of course, there&apos;s no going back&quot;) while reminiscing. They touch on &quot;Born To Run&quot; (&quot;I was trying to make the greatest record you ever heard&quot;), the death of Clarence Clemons (&quot;like losing the rain&quot;), battling depression in his 60&apos;s (&quot;It&apos;s like this thing that engulfs you...I got to where I didn&apos;t want to get out of bed&quot;), his complicated relationship with his father, and his unyielding passion for touring: &quot;My attitude at this point in my life is, this is what I love to do, I want to do as much of it as I can.&quot;</p>

<p>Keeping with the theme, Mason also talked to Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr about the new Ron Howard-directed Beatles documentary, <em>The Beatles: Eight Days A Week</em>, all about the band&apos;s touring days. Check that out below.</p>
