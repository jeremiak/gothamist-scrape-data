</div></div>					<p>A train service to the Rockaways <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425175010/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/29/a_train_service_to_rockaway_finally.php">finally resumed on Thursday</a>. It came months after Hurricane Sandy devastated the city, flooding the Broad Channel and Rockaway Park-Beach 116th Street stations, washing out 1,500 feet of tracks, and destroying miles of signal, power and communications wires. The MTA celebrated yesterday by running vintage R1/R9 subway cars, which were first put into service in the 1930s. &quot;In my 13 years in New York, I have never seen a subway train car like this,&quot; straphanger Everett J Hutton told us. &quot;There were ceiling fans, the car doors were open for people to mozy through, and the seats were cushy!&quot; Get a feel for the train with the photos above and video below.</p>
