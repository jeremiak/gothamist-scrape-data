It&apos;s the &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161113132205/http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/huppke/ct-trump-giuliani-woman-sexism-huppke-20161003-story.html">undergirding</a>&quot; of his entire campaign philosophy! Or... <em>is it all just an act for funsies? </em></p>

<p>Trump was asked yesterday about his history of talking about women like they&apos;re less than human, and he gave a very Trumpian explanation: &quot;A lot of that was done for the purpose of entertainment,&quot; he told Las Vegas&#x2019; KSNV. &quot;I can tell you this: There is nobody &#x2014; nobody &#x2014; that has more respect for women than I do.&#x201D; Oh, that clears up everything.</p>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Asked about his comments about physical attributes of women, Trump: &quot;A lot of that was done for the purpose of entertainment.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161113132205/https://t.co/vk13Tpt1GI">pic.twitter.com/vk13Tpt1GI</a></p>&#x2014; Sopan Deb (@SopanDeb) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161113132205/https://twitter.com/SopanDeb/status/783926646629949440">October 6, 2016</a></blockquote>

<p>Trump continued that &quot;you say things differently for a reason&quot; when you &quot;have one of the top shows on television,&quot; which is a pretty strange logic loop for someone to make when <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161113132205/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/18-real-things-donald-trump-has-said-about-women_us_55d356a8e4b07addcb442023">defending a history</a> of labelling women &quot;fat pigs,&quot; &quot;dogs,&quot; &quot;slobs&quot; and &quot;disgusting animals.&quot; </p>

<p>While Trump&apos;s implication that American TV viewers are the ones who want more aggression and nastiness toward women is hollow enough as is, it doesn&apos;t explain his pre-<em>Apprentice</em> language, like when he called women &quot;golddiggers&quot; in <em>The Art Of The Deal</em>, or when he told Esquire Magazine in 1991 that &quot;it doesn&apos;t really matter what [women] write as long as you&apos;ve got a young and beautiful piece of ass.&quot; And it doesn&apos;t explain why he hasn&apos;t been able to stop denigrating women post-<em>Apprentice</em> throughout this campaign, as when he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161113132205/http://gothamist.com/2016/09/27/mr_misogyny.php">body-shamed Alicia Machado</a>, a former Miss Universe winner, and called her &quot;Miss Piggy.&quot; <br>
 <br>
But hey, at least Trump knows it is a &quot;much different world now.&quot; And he&apos;s gone a full week without urging America <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161113132205/http://gothamist.com/2016/09/30/donald_trump_sex_tape.php">to &quot;check out&quot; a woman&apos;s sex tape</a>! The Trump campaign is becoming so great again, it&apos;s the best, really, believe me. </p>
