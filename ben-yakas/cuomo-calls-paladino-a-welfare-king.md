In the ad (which you can see below), Cuomo calls Paladino an Albany-insider with shady business dealings, and a &quot;welfare king&quot;!  </p>

<p>Prominently featured in the ad is the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160730102649/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/09/20/2010-09-20_huge_tax_break_fits_carl_to_a_tea_big_govt_foe_fights_for_14m_windfall.html">allegation</a> that Paladino received a $1.4 million state tax break to create jobs, but created only one. The ad comes after Spitzer criticized Cuomo&apos;s &quot;Rose Garden&quot; campaign yesterday, and intimated that Cuomo would be slinging mud with Paladino soon enough. </p>

<p>In response to Spitzer&apos;s comment that Cuomo is the &quot;dirtiest, nastiest political player out there&quot; yesterday, Cuomo spokesman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160730102649/http://www.nydailynews.com/blogs/dailypolitics/2010/09/wake-up-call-09242010.html">Josh Vlasto said</a>, &quot;<strong>The attorney general&apos;s record, credibility and honor speak for themselves, as do Mr. Spitzer&apos;s.</strong>&quot; </p>
