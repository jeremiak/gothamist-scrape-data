<p>Fort Greene residents are up in arms over the biggest controversy to hit the neighborhood since the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509165241/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/02/fort_greene_drama_cat_in_a_tree.php">Great Cat Rescue Mission of 2010</a>: neighbors say that Diamante&apos;s Brooklyn Cigar Lounge, which opened last year on South Oxford St., is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509165241/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/brooklyn/2010/11/12/2010-11-12_causing_a_big_stink_tenants_fume_over_cigar_bar.html">stinking up the area</a> with an ever-present smell which has invaded and polluted their living rooms. &quot;I cannot open my windows. It&apos;s a constant lingering odor. It&apos;s like someone is in our house smoking a cigar,&quot; said Luis Urrea, who lives across the street from the lounge.</p>

<p>Locals have begun petitioning owner David Diamante to install a better ventilation system to help stave off the polarizing odor. Smoking is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509165241/http://gothamist.com/2009/11/16/smoking_intolerance.php">banned</a> in city bars and restaurants (and lots of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509165241/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/16/smoking_world_reacts_to_park_beach.php">other places!</a>), but the Lounge doesn&apos;t serve food or alcohol, only the pungent promise of lung cancer. Diamente has already installed two smoke-eating machines to filter the air in the Lounge, but that hasn&apos;t stopped neighbors from lodging 13 complaints about the cigar bar with the city Buildings Department. </p>

<p>Brad Gerstman, a representative of 300 tobacco shops in the state, thinks that Diamente is a victim in a city-wide smoking witch hunt: &quot;He&apos;s in full compliance with the law.  He&apos;s worried for his livelihood...<strong>We&apos;re moving into an era of ultra-intolerance. People think they&apos;re entitled not to get a hint of smoke anywhere.&quot;</strong> But who would argue that people aren&apos;t entitled to the warm embrace of roasting tar marshmallows?</p>
