<p>Today is quickly turning into baby boomer songwriters appreciation day here at Gothamist: last night we saw <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509174717/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/05/randy_newman_live_in_tarrytown.php">Randy Newman</a> play his hit &quot;Short People,&quot; and today we&apos;re excited about the return of actual short person <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509174717/http://gothamist.com/2009/02/14/old_friends_simon_and_garfunkel_at.php">Paul Simon</a>. Simon <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509174717/http://www.paulsimon.com/">is releasing</a> his 11th album, <em>So Beautiful or So What</em>, on April 11th, his first new album in five years. And he&apos;s going on tour this spring, hitting the Beacon Theater in NYC on May 10th and 11th. Tickets go on sale Friday, March 11th at 9am <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509174717/http://www.ticketmaster.com/search?tm_link=tm_homeA_header_search&amp;q=paul+simon&amp;search.x=0&amp;search.y=0">here</a>.</p>

<p>You can hear his new single &quot;The Afterlife&quot; in the embed below (which really sounds like the best thing he&apos;s done in twenty years), and a video of Simon performing his jolly hit &quot;You Can Call Me Al&quot; in Central Park in 1991 (with Chevy Chase on pantomime sax!) below that:</p>
