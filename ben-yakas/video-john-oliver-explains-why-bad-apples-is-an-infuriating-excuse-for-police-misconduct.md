<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021160920/http://gothamist.com/tags/johnoliver">John Oliver</a> focused on police accountability on last night&apos;s <em>Last Week Tonight</em>, diving into the problems with a system that routinely excuses terrible (and often fatal) police misconduct with a wave of a hand and a dismissive cliche that prevents real change.</p>

<p>&quot;The phrase isn&apos;t, &apos;It&apos;s just a few bad apples, don&apos;t worry about it,&quot; Oliver said. &quot;The phrase is, &apos;A few bad apples spoil the barrel.&apos; And we currently have a system which is set up to ignore bad apples, destroy bad apples&apos; records, persecute good apples for speaking up and shuffle dangerous, emotionally unstable apples around to the point that children have to attend fucking apple classes. You cannot look at our current situation and claim that anybody likes them apples.&quot;</p>

<p>Oliver also discusses teens who have been given lessons on how to interact with police in order to minimize their risk of being shot. &quot;That is so fucking depressing,&quot; Oliver said. &quot;Especially when you realize that that&#x2019;s probably the only class where nobody will raise their hand and say, &apos;When are we ever going to use this?&apos;&quot;</p>
