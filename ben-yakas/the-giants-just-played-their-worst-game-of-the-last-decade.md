<p>Today, the Giants <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426235619/http://scores.espn.go.com/nfl/recap?gameId=330922029">lost to the Carolina Panthers 38-0</a> in the absolute worst game of the Tom Coughlin era. When the highlight of a game is your fumble-prone running back doing a backflip to celebrate a touchdown that is immediately taken away because of a holding penalty, you know things are seriously bad. Check out some appropriately depressed reactions below.</p>

<p>Eli Manning only had 12 completions, finishing with less than 120 yards&#x2014;although he may have broken the record for most Manning Faces in one game. The offensive line was inept while the Panthers defense was like a swarm of killer bees. Backup quarterback Curtis Painter actually entered the game (and threw an interception). This is the first time the Giants have started a season 0-3 since 1996 (when they went 6-10). </p>

<p>But hey, at least fans don&apos;t have to worry about the Giants letting us down later in the season: of the 161 teams that have started the season 0-3 since 1978, only five made the NFL playoffs.</p>
