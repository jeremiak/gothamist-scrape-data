title: Dishonest Cyber Mocks Trump After He Tweets Photo Of Trump Working Very, Very Hard On Big Speech

										<p>Donald Trump, who may or may not <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170120154334/http://www.esquire.com/news-politics/news/a52362/donald-trump-favorite-books/">be literate</a>, sent out a tremendous tweet this morning in which he posed in front of a Magic Eye-worthy backdrop while pretending to handwrite his inaugural address. </p>

<p>Sure, Trump has posed for smiling photos before with the likes of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170120154334/https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/760299757206208512?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">KFC chicken</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170120154334/https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/728297587418247168?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">taco bowls</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170120154334/https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/806246271405162500">mad dogs,</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170120154334/https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/776468635955130368">SO</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170120154334/https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/769323472048623616">MANY</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170120154334/https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/769331841316687873">THUMBS</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170120154334/https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/761773576101953536">UP</a>. But for someone who cares more about the optics of being president rather than <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170120154334/http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/01/donald-trump-weaseling-out-of-being-president">the actual work</a>, this seems like a bit of stretch, to say the least.</p>

<p>Trump might think of himself as David Blaine performing magic <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170120154334/http://variety.com/2016/tv/news/david-blaine-freaks-out-drake-chappelle-magic-trick-1201919696/">in front of a freaked out Drake</a> (just substituted Drake for the entire country), but thankfully, Twitter is never one to miss an opportunity to roast a megalomaniac who thinks he can pass off <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170120154334/http://www.snopes.com/trump-busted-using-empty-folders/">blank paper as important documents.</a> </p>
