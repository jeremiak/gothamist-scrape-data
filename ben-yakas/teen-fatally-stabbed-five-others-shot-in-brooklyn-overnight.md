<p>A teen was fatally stabbed, and five other people were shot last night in separate violent incidents across Brooklyn. Police say that Kenny Chen, 17, was stabbed on the corner of Benson Avenue and 26th Avenue around 3:40 a.m. near his home. Three or four suspects <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717104645/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/teen_stabbed_to_death_near_gravesend_pmXjvrqBUSJ3UwJ37N2jSL">were spotted</a> running away from the scene; cops also found a large quantity of marijuana on him at the time of his death.</p>

<p>According to the FDNY, a 19-year-old man was shot twice in the leg, and a 30-year-old man was grazed in the head around 3:30 a.m. near Milford Street and Hegeman Avenue in East New York. Both men were taken to Brookdale University Hospital with non-life threatening injuries.</p>

<p>Then around 4:20 a.m., three people were shot in the Bedford-Stuyvesant area. A 26-year-old man was shot once in the left arm and twice in the left leg; a 21-year-old woman was shot in the lower back and left hip; and a 45-year-old woman was shot in the left buttocks. All three were taken to local hospitals, and are expected to survive.</p>

<p>No arrests have been made in any of the incidents. Last weekend, at least <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717104645/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/03/nycs_violent_weekend_25_shootings_o.php">25 people were shot in a 48 hour period.</a> </p>
