<p>Here at Gothamist HQ, we are always fascinated by the non-emergencies that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504141159/http://gothamist.com/tags/311">piss off New Yorkers</a> enough to actively seek vengeance by way of anonymous 311 complaints, whether it&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504141159/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/24/interactive_map_what_neighborhoods.php">excess dog poop</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504141159/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/11/where_all_calls_go.php">refrigerator noises</a>, or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504141159/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/14/311_dispatcher_describes_most_ridic.php">jews having more holidays for alternate side parking.</a> The folks over at NYU&apos;s Furman Center have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504141159/http://furmancenter.org/thestoop/entry/summer-of-311">put together the above map</a> that illustrates the most common summertime complaints by neighborhood to the city&apos;s non-emergency line.</p>

<p>The information was compiled via 311 data from June-August 2012&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504141159/http://furmancenter.org/thestoop/entry/summer-of-311">go here to download</a> the full list of 311 complaints by neighborhood [xls]. Some interesting anomalies on the list: Woodside residents are annoyed by &quot;loud talking,&quot; Hollis residents are annoyed by &quot;illegal postering,&quot; Douglas Manor has a problem with &quot;dirty water,&quot; and Spuyten Duyvil/Kingsbridge residents are annoyed by &quot;no receipts.&quot; Oh, and Prospect/Lefferts Garden, Midwood, Flatbush, Crown Heights South and Mount Hope residents generally have a problem with &quot;ceilings.&quot; </p>
