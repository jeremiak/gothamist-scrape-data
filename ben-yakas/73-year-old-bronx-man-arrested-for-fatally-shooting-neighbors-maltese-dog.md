<p>A 73-year-old Bronx man has been arrested for fatally shooting his neighbor&apos;s Maltese dog. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130519160516/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/bronx/bronx-man-arrested-shooting-neighbor-dog-article-1.1316124">According to the News</a>, Donald Savino allegedly fired his two pellets from a high-powered air rifle from an open window at the 8-year-old dog, Spike, around 6 p.m. Tuesday. &#x201C;He was smelling a tree,&#x201D; said Spike&#x2019;s owner, Marco Lopez. &#x201C;Suddenly, I hear this noise...I hear my dog cry&#x2014;he was screaming in pain.&#x201D;</p>

<p>The fluffy 9-pound dog was rushed to an emergency vet, but he died from his injuries. Lopez said his wife and three children were devastated by the loss: &#x201C;You have no idea all the pain we went through,&#x201D; Lopez said. &#x201C;We loved (Spike) so much...It was such a terrible way that he died.&#x201D; Lopez bought a new poodle puppy, Lex, on Saturday to ease the family&apos;s pain.</p>

<p>Savino, who had a sign reading &quot;Keep your dog off the grass&#x201D; on his lawn, will be charged with animal cruelty and weapons possession (he was found with a Crossman .22-caliber Magnum rifle). As for why he did it, he allegedly confessed to officers: <strong>&#x201C;OK, I did it. I didn&#x2019;t mean to kill the dog. I just wanted to shoot it in the butt and scare him.&#x201D;</strong></p>
