<p>Considering the fact that almost every mayoral candidate has run on an anti-Bloomberg platform&#x2014;even the ones who aren&apos;t are distancing themselves from his administration&#x2014;it&apos;s no wonder that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503161401/http://gothamist.com/tags/mayorbloomberg">Mayor Bloomberg</a> has been even more ornery than usual lately. The cracks were showing in his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503161401/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/07/bloomberg_calls_bill_de_blasio_camp.php">&quot;class warfare&quot;-invoking New York Magazine interview</a>&#x2014;he seemed like a crotchety time bomb waiting to explode. And yesterday while announcing the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503161401/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/18/behold_the_giant_housingbowling_all.php#photo-1">$1.1 billion Essex Crossing development on the LES</a>, Bloomberg may have reached peak irritability with the press and public office.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503161401/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/19/nyregion/asked-to-reflect-bloomberg-grumbles-instead.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">As the Times reports</a>, Bloomberg jumped down the throat of one reporter who dared to ask him about his legacy:</p>

<blockquote>When one reporter suggested that a mixed-use development he was announcing might be one of his last such initiatives as mayor, he looked at her as though she were a lobotomy patient.

<p>&#x201C;I hope not,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;We&#x2019;ve got 104 days, and you can rest assured we&#x2019;ll be working as hard as we can. Why do you assume that?&#x201D;</p>

<p>Before she could answer, he went on: &#x201C;You probably wrote that after the second term we wouldn&#x2019;t do anything. And I think we&#x2019;ve done more in the third term than any administration&#x2019;s ever done &#x2014; certainly more than we did in the first and second term.&#x201D;</p>

<p>When the reporter asked him to reflect on his development legacy, he sniffed, &#x201C;I&#x2019;m not sure what the word even means.&#x201D;</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>Then a reporter who brought up the latest stop-and-frisk news&#x2014;Judge Shira Scheindlin <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503161401/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/17/stop-and-frisk_2.php">denied the city&apos;s request for a stay</a> during the review process earlier this week&#x2014;made the mistake of saying the judge &#x201C;ruled against you on the appeal.&quot; &#x201C;No, no, she didn&#x2019;t rule against me &#x2014; she ruled against the people of the city,&#x201D; he snapped like a turtle. Noting the ruling had been expected, he said, &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t know why it&#x2019;s even newsworthy, and I don&#x2019;t know that anybody even covered it other than a tiny bit.&#x201D;</p>

<p>When asked why he thought voters wanted the city to move in a new direction, Bloomberg retorted, &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t know, that&#x2019;s up to your job to find out...I really have no idea. All I can do is tell you what we&#x2019;ve done. <strong>If you want to write that, or if you want to make up some stuff, that&#x2019;s totally up to you. I have no idea.</strong>&#x201D; We shudder to imagine what would have happened if someone brought up <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503161401/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/23/bloombergs_advice_for_success_dont.php">his controversial bathroom stance.</a></p>
