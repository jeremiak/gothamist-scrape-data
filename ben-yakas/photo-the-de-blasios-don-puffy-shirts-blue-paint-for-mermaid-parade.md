<p>It&apos;s fair to say that twelve years of Mayor Bloomberg&apos;s somewhat-benevolent dictatormayoralship hardened us. He may have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140625015422/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/138267-PHOTO-CALL-Mayor-Bloomberg-Lets-His-Hair-Down">sang with the cast of the <em>Little Mermaid</em></a> during his once-a-year <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140625015422/http://gothamist.com/tags/innercircle">mandated playdate with the press</a>, but Bloomberg was not one to trifle with costumes, festivities, or smiling otherwise. It&apos;s been a different story in De Blasio&apos;s NY, a magical place where children <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140625015422/http://gothamist.com/2014/01/03/breaking_dante_de_blasio_shoveled_t.php">willingly shovel snow</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140625015422/http://gothamist.com/2014/05/28/sorry_rudy_de_blasio_may_bring_back.php">ferrets roam free</a>, and our mayor is currently wearing the puffiest shirt this side of a revival of <em>Pirates Of Penzance</em>.</p>

<p>As you can see above, the de Blasios have gone all-out for their first mayoral <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140625015422/http://gothamist.com/tags/mermaidparade">Mermaid Parade</a>, taking place in Coney Island this afternoon. We knew Chiara and Dante de Blasio would <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140625015422/http://gothamist.com/2014/05/29/the_de_blasio_siblings_crowned_merm.php">be the King and Queen</a>; we didn&apos;t know the whole family was going <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140625015422/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axHe_BVY_9c">to blue themselves.</a> Doesn&apos;t <em>really</em> explain why BDB is the only one dressed as a pirate, unless it&apos;s symbolic of the fact he steals from the rich and...has a boat?</p>

<p>Sure, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140625015422/http://gothamist.com/tags/billdeblasio">a lot of things haven&apos;t changed</a> since de Blasio has come to office&#x2014;just look at the current levels of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140625015422/http://gothamist.com/2014/06/10/more_arrested_for_marijuana_under_d.php">low-level marijuana arrests</a>&#x2014;but after suffering through Post-Bloomberg Stress Disorder, a little bit of fun and frivolity is a welcome change of pace. This might be the new look for the &apos;10s, and we&apos;re proud to say our mayor is at the cutting edge of style for once.</p>
