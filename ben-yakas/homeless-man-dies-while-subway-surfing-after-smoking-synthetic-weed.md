<p>Yesterday, a homeless man suffered a fatal head injury <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424004356/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/30/subway_surfer_suffers_head_injury_a.php">after subway surfing atop a 6 train in Manhattan</a>. That 45-year-old man, who police haven&apos;t yet identified, climbed between cars and atop the downtown 6 train near the 96th Street station just around noon on Wednesday; he spread out his arms, then hit a steel bar and suffered head trauma. And the man had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424004356/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/man-rushed-hospital-riding-top-subway-article-1.1501501">reportedly</a> been smoking synthetic marijuana before the incident.</p>

<p>Pablo Reyes, 45, identified the man as Grumps, a panhandler who has been homeless for about a year, and may have been staying at a shelter on West 25th Street. &quot;He was hanging out getting high,&quot; Reyes <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424004356/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/man-rushed-hospital-riding-top-subway-article-1.1501501">told the News</a>. &quot;I told him, &#x2018;Stop getting high off that s**t. It ain&#x2019;t no good for you. He probably was hallucinating.&quot; Reyes was a witness to the fatal incident as well: &#x201C;He was standing up with his hands open. He saw the beam coming. He laid down. He tried to duck down. It opened his head right up.&#x201C;</p>

<p>&#x201C;He was still breathing when I lifted him up,&#x201D; Reyes <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424004356/http://nypost.com/2013/10/30/rider-hit-by-beam-while-subway-surfing/">told the Post</a>. &#x201C;He was trying to talk &#x2014; &#x2018;Help me, help!&#x2019; I&#x2019;m in shock. There was a lot of blood on the tracks.&#x201D; The man died at Metropolitan Hospital. An MTA spokesman commented to the Post: &#x201C;Subway surfing is simply one of the dumbest things you can do.&#x201D;</p>
