<p>It was just over a year ago <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509173228/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/20/report_tonight_show_headed_back_to.php">that NBC announced</a> Jay Leno would retire and allow Jimmy Fallon to take the reigns of <em>The Tonight Show</em>. Now, having outlasted his longtime nemesis&#x2014;who officially bowed out of the late night wars <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509173228/http://laist.com/2014/02/07/video_jay_leno_leaves_the_tonight_s.php">in February</a>&#x2014;now <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509173228/http://gothamist.com/tags/davidletterman">David Letterman</a> is planning to announce his retirement from <em>The Late Show</em> tonight. So let the succession speculation begin! </p>

<p>A number of sources&#x2014;including <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509173228/http://variety.com/2014/tv/news/david-letterman-to-retire-from-cbs-in-2015-1201152380/">Variety</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509173228/https://twitter.com/m_millsey/status/451812377835864065">musician Mike Mills</a> (who was the first to Tweet about it), and CNN&apos;s in-house Twitter addict <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509173228/https://twitter.com/brianstelter/status/451816307814842368">Brian Stelter</a>&#x2014;have all confirmed that Letterman is planning to retire in 2015. Variety says he is expected to discuss his plan to retire on tonight&apos;s show. </p>

<p>Check out video of Letterman on <em>The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson</em> after it was announced that Leno would be made the next host:</p>

<p>As for his possible successor, some obvious candidates include Craig Ferguson (current host of <em>The Late Late Show</em> after Letterman), Conan O&apos;Brien, Amy Poehler (because she&apos;s perfect), and our <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509173228/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/20/the_top_15_candidates_to_replace_ji.php">#1 choice as always, Ant-Man</a>. </p>

<p>Also, it&apos;s worth noting that Letterman&apos;s retirement was a plot line on <em>Louie</em> in Season 3, in which C.K., Chris Rock and Jerry Seinfeld were all competing to be his successor (and C.K. learned that trying is its own victory). Also, David Lynch was involved; if David Lynch could be involved with this in real life, we&apos;d be entirely on board with that.</p>

<p>More food for thought: could it really be a coincidence this news broke a day after Bill Murray said it was on his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509173228/http://gothamist.com/2014/04/03/videos_bill_murray_goes_full_bill_m.php">bucket list to step into Letterman&apos;s shoes</a>?* </p>

<p>*[Yes, almost certainly]</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: Here is what Letterman told the audience at the taping of tonight&apos;s show, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509173228/http://www.hitfix.com/whats-alan-watching/david-letterman-to-retire-from-late-night">via HitFix</a>:</p>

<blockquote>The man who owns this network, Leslie Moonves, he and I have had a relationship for years and years and years, and we have had this conversation in the past, and we agreed that we would work together on this circumstance and the timing of this circumstance.  And I phoned him just before the program, and I said &#x2018;Leslie, it&#x2019;s been great, you&#x2019;ve been great, and the network has been great, but I&#x2019;m retiring.&apos;

<p>I just want to reiterate my thanks for the support from the network, all of the people who have worked here, all of the people in the theater, all the people on the staff, everybody at home, thank you very much.  What this means now, is that Paul and I can be married.</p>

<p>We don&#x2019;t have the timetable for this precisely down - I think it will be at least a year or so, but sometime in the not too distant future, 2015 for the love of God, in fact, Paul and I will be wrapping things up.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>Here&apos;s the official statement from Moonves:</p>

<blockquote>When Dave decided on a one-year extension for his most recent contract, we knew this day was getting closer, but that doesn&#x2019;t make the moment any less poignant for us. For 21 years, David Letterman has graced our Network&#x2019;s air in late night with wit, gravitas and brilliance unique in the history of our medium. During that time, Dave has given television audiences thousands of hours of comedic entertainment, the sharpest interviews in late night, and brilliant moments of candor and perspective around national events. He&#x2019;s also managed to keep many celebrities, politicians and executives on their toes - including me. There is only one David Letterman. His greatness will always be remembered here, and he will certainly sit among the pantheon of this business. On a personal note, it&#x2019;s been a privilege to get to know Dave and to enjoy a terrific relationship. It&#x2019;s going to be tough to say goodbye. Fortunately, we won&#x2019;t have to do that for another year or so. Until then, we look forward to celebrating Dave&#x2019;s remarkable show and incredible talents.</blockquote>
