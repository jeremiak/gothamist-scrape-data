<p>An Ithaca College student from Brooklyn was fatally stabbed after a large fight broke out at the Cornell University campus last night. </p>

<p>According <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110090255/http://www.ithaca.com/news/two-stabbed-at-cornell-info-sought/article_f51032a6-6d08-11e6-95e9-df1e0fb32807.html?bf">to Ithaca.com</a>, Cornell Police and Ithaca Police Department officers responded to a large fight in front of Olin Hall just before 2 a.m. It&apos;s unclear what started the fight nor how many people were involved.</p>

<p>Two Ithaca College students were found stabbed; one was taken by helicopter to the SUNY Upstate University Hospital where he was treated for multiple stab wounds and later released. The other, who has been identified <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110090255/http://ithacavoice.com/2016/08/19-year-old-ithaca-college-student-killed-stabbing-idd-family/">by The Ithaca Voice</a> as 20-year-old Anthony Nazaire, was transported to Cayuga Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead.</p>

<p>Nazaire was an Ithaca College sophomore from Brooklyn who had just returned to the college after spending the summer with his family in Flatbush, his cousin Channelle Nazaire told Ithaca Voice. &quot;He&apos;s never been in trouble with the law. He&apos;s a very good student,&quot; she said, adding that he was studying business administration. &quot;It&apos;s very hard for me to even understand. I&apos;m still in denial about it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I hope you will hold these students&#x2014; along with their families, friends, classmates, and professors&#x2014;in your thoughts and prayers at this difficult and tragic time,&quot; Ithaca College President Tom Rochon said in a statement.</p>

<p>This was the first homicide in Ithaca in nearly five years. No arrests have been made, and the investigation is ongoing. Authorities urge anyone with information about the crime to contact IPD at 607-272-3245 or Cornell Police at 607-255-1111.</p>
