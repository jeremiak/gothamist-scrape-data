<p>In case you needed another reason to never sit on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507080010/http://gothamist.com/tags/subway">subway</a> again, above you can see Example #4,909 why you should always give up that last seat to a pregnant woman. &quot;Somehow, I think I was the only one that noticed,&quot; Matt LaPolice told us about the photo he took on the 1 train on Friday. &quot;There was a woman sitting two seats over from him that clearly had no clue, or she wouldn&apos;t have been sitting so close...&quot; Well, it&apos;s not <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507080010/http://gothamist.com/2012/08/23/is_this_the_most_horrifying_subway.php">the <em>worst</em> subway photo</a> we&apos;ve ever seen, but still.</p>

<p>You might recall that Sen. Eric Adams started <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507080010/http://gothamist.com/tags/stopthesag">a &quot;Stop the Sag&quot; campaign</a> a few years ago, putting up billboards across Brooklyn encouraging teens to stop looking like fools with their pants on the ground; a Harlem man even <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507080010/http://gothamist.com/2010/12/16/harlem_inventor_creates_anti-sag_de.php">invented a device</a> to help regulate sag with mathematical precision. Bloomberg of course <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150507080010/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/23/nanny_bloomberg_doesnt_mind_if_your.php">undermined the whole campaign</a>, and look where we are today. So really, you can blame Bloomberg for this one. </p>
