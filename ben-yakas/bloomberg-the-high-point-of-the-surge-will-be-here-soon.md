<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141112134017/http://gothamist.com/tags/mayorbloomberg">Mayor Bloomberg</a> has cast aside the comfort-inducing sweaters he wore over the weekend in favor of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141112134017/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/29/mayor_bloomberg_says_remain_in_your.php">a serious business suit</a> to give the latest updates on Hurricane Sandy, and all the effects of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141112134017/http://gothamist.com/tags/frankenstorm">Frankenstorm</a>, today. Watch the press conference from the Office Of Emergency Management below (which should be starting around 5:30 p.m.), and try to take your mind off the fact we&apos;re now <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141112134017/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/29/cuomo_orders_shutdown_of_7_bridges.php">one step closer to</a> <em>Escape From New York</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: Bloomberg stressed how dangerous it is outside right now, and said that New York City would be in for the worst of the storm in the next couple hours. <strong>&quot;I think we can expect more flooding and outages. The most severe part of the storm is now beginning,&quot;</strong> he said. &quot;The worst is about to hit. I think we&apos;ve done all we can to prepare...The most important thing I can say is, if you&apos;re in your home or somewhere safe, stay there. Time for relocation or evacuation is over. Conditions outside are dangerous, and they&apos;re only going to get worse in the hours ahead.&quot;</p>

<p>Bloomberg noted that the storm surge is expected to peak at 8:15 p.m. ET. In the Battery, in the Rockaways and on Staten Island, the surge will be highest between 6:30 p.m. and 10:30 p.m. tonight, and in parts of the city that are on the Long Island Sound, the peak surge will be between 10 p.m. today and 2 a.m. tomorrow morning. He warned people to stay inside, avoid using elevators and stay away from windows, because the <br>
&quot;storm is moving at a faster pace than had been predicted...city is still very much within the danger zone.&quot;</p>

<p>Bloomberg also implored people to not call 911 for downed trees or flooding, telling them they should call 311 or text 311692 for that, and only call 911 if you&apos;re &quot;really in trouble.&quot; So far, only one person has been injured during the storm&#x2014;a jogger who was struck by a falling limb near Prospect Park; she is going to be okay though). Two people were given summonses for surfing as well (Ray Kelly noted that they refused to come out of the water at first). </p>

<p>While he implored people to &quot;try to relax and spend the night in,&quot; he reiterated that the &quot;city is open for business,&quot; and all city employees are expected to come to work tomorrow (&quot;provided they can do that safely&quot;). Public schools and city parks will be closed tomorrow, but sanitation crews will be working at 7 a.m. to collect debris: &quot;don&apos;t put out garbage tonight, but wait till the storm has passed.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>&quot;We have a recovery plan in place once the worst of storm is past,&quot; Bloomberg said. &quot;It&apos;s as bad a storm as we have seen modern day.</strong> The difference is, today we&apos;re prepared for it. In the olden days, you would have had lots of fatalities. We&apos;re not through this yet, but so far all the procedures we&apos;ve had in place [have worked]...I think we&apos;re probably better prepared than we&apos;ve ever been before.&quot; He added that he expects damage to be &quot;relatively minor,&quot; but the winds will remain high and it will still be dangerous outside Tuesday morning.</p>
