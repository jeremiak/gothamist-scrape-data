<p>If it wasn&apos;t for the billions of dollars and, oh, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160831035218/http://gothamist.com/tags/donaldtrump">everything about him</a>, we might begin to feel kind of bad about how easy it is to make fun of Donald Trump. We&apos;ve even petitioned to have the idiom changed to, &quot;like shooting Donald Trump&apos;s in a barrel.&quot; But as long as Trump does things like pretend to run for president in order to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160831035218/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/15/future_president_donald_trump_surge.php">increase the ratings</a> of his dumb reality show, <em>Celebrity Combover</em>, it&apos;s hard to feel anything but annoyance. Especially when he starts saying arrogant things such as: <strong>&quot;You land your plane at LaGuardia Airport, you go to LaGuardia Airport, it&apos;s like a Third World airport,&quot;</strong> Trump said <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160831035218/http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2011/04/17/trump-i%E2%80%99m-%E2%80%98much-bigger%E2%80%99-than-romney/">on CNN</a>.</p>

<p>City Councilman James Vacca, chairman of the council&apos;s transportation committee, was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160831035218/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/2011/04/17/2011-04-17_donald_trump_refers_to_laguardia_airport_as_third_world_says_hes_bigger_than_mit.html">not amused</a> by the comment: <strong>&quot;Is he referring to the diversity that represents New York City? This is not constructive and could certainly be interpreted that way.</strong>&quot; Trump went on to criticize American infrastructure and industry, which he said was being blown away by the Chinese, one of his major talking points: &quot;This country is a laughingstock throughout the world. It&apos;s being ripped-off by every country. If you look at what China is doing, they&apos;re stealing our jobs, they&apos;re taking our money. <strong>They&apos;re building bridges. They&apos;re building airports. They&apos;re building cities, brand new cities. When was the last time you saw a bridge being built in the United States?&quot;</strong> </p>

<p>Of course, NYC completed a $614 million project to replace the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160831035218/http://gothamist.com/tags/willisavenuebridge">Willis Avenue Bridge</a> over the Harlem River last summer. So the answer to that rhetorical question would at worst be...last summer. Vacca added that Trump shouldn&apos;t bite the hand that&apos;s put up with him all these years: &quot;I can&apos;t believe he said that...<strong>I know it&apos;s popular in other parts of the country to pick on New York for political gain, but he has been a New Yorker his whole life. I would hope he wouldn&apos;t try to benefit by slamming New York.&quot;</strong></p>

<p>Trump didn&apos;t save his disdain for NYC, its inhabitants, and its business projects though; he also got some jabs in at potential presidential opponent Mitt Romney. &quot;I&apos;m much bigger than this man and have a much, much bigger net worth. I mean my net worth is many, many, many times Mitt Romney,&quot; he bragged. Just like Vacca, Washington Post columnist George Will is also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160831035218/http://dailycaller.com/2011/04/17/george-will-trump-stands-chance-of-making-a-shambles-of-the-republican-party/">not amused</a> by Trump&apos;s rhetoric: &#x201C;Just by being there, he can hurt the Republican Party. <strong>He is what is called a &#x2018;blatherskite.&#x2019; That is a word my grandmother was fond of as someone who blathers promiscuously.&#x201D;</strong></p>

<p>But at least Trump has some real forward-thinking ideas about how to deal with surging gas prices: all we have to do <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160831035218/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/04/17/donald-trumps-lower-gas-prices-opec_n_850202.html">is use</a> our &quot;brain power!&quot; It&apos;s wonderful, and wholly appropriate, to see that Trump is now outsourcing his ideas to Zack Galifianakis&apos; character from <em>Dinner For Schmucks.</em></p>
