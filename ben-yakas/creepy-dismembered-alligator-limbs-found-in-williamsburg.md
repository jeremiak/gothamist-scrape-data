                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="62613allig.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130731072838im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/62613allig.jpg" width="640" height="420" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>There are still plenty of cynical New Yorkers who don&apos;t believe that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130731072838/http://gothamist.com/tags/alligators">alligators</a> roam our city&apos;s sewers, biding their time until the humans <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130731072838/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/25/sweaty_obama_global_warming_is_stil.php">completely compromise their environment</a> and they can rise up to enact vengeance upon the handbag industry. Well suck on this non-believers: <a hef="http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/bizarre-severed-alligator-limbs-brooklyn-street-article-1.1383207">the News reports</a> that assorted alligator limbs were found in Williamsburg near N. 10th Street. Does this mean Brooklyn has its very own <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130731072838/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Booth_(Blue_Velvet)">Frank Booth</a> targeting alligators?</p>

<p>Three legs were found scattered around the block according to Ricardo Rodrigo, a plant manager at a building across N. 10th Street&#x2014;but there&apos;s no sign of the head and rest of it. &#x201C;Maybe he ate the rest of it and didn&#x2019;t like the leg,&#x201D; Rodrigo said. &#x201C;Jungle Bob&#x201D; Smith, owner of Jungle Bob&#x2019;s Reptile World in Long Island, examined the limbs, and determined that the size of the legs indicate the gator would have been young, only about two to three feet long.</p>

<p>&#x201C;This is certainly a mutilation situation, and it&#x2019;s a sick individual who would do that,&#x201D; Smith told the News. &#x201C;Down South, people eat gator, they eat the tail part and cut it up to get the meat there. They kill it and chop it up like you would a chicken and often the head is used for weird souvenirs. The skin is used in the (fashion) world for shoes, suitcases and clothes.&quot; </p>

<p>But with no pet stores in the area, he was perplexed about the location: <br>
&quot;<strong>They&#x2019;re not something that&#x2019;s common in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn, that&#x2019;s the part that befuddles me</strong>.&#x201D; If anyone finds a severed ear next, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130731072838/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9OCA4FwSqs">do not investigate it.</a></p>
