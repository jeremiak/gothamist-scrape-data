	<p><br>
A suspect was taken into custody after a 29-year-old man was slashed in Bushwick this morning. According to police, the incident happened around 10:40 a.m. in front of 1153 Broadway. The victim was taken to Woodhull Hospital in stable condition; one suspect was caught at the scene and taken by police, and the weapon was recovered. </p>

<p>The stabbing brought a huge amount of policemen and several ambulances to the scene. Witnesses told us that the stabbing may have begun as a robbery either inside the Deli Plus bodega (see photo above) or on the sidewalk in front of the bodega, near the Kosciuszko stop on the J train. Police add that the investigation is ongoing, and charges are pending. </p>
