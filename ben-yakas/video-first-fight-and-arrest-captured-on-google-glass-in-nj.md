<p>They may not be available on the commercial market yet, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928032938/http://gothamist.com/tags/googleglass">Google Glass</a> has already passed so many important milestones: we&apos;ve had the first <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928032938/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uh-liQDE3cM">Glass skydiver</a>, the first <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928032938/http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-57587662-1/will-she-the-first-marriage-proposal-via-google-glass/">Glass marriage proposal</a>, the first bar <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928032938/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/10/seattle_bar_bans_google_glass_cheap.php">to ban Glass</a>, and of course, the first <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928032938/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/23/the_truth_about_google_glass_its_ok.php">utterly underwhelmed responses.</a> But now, one Glass explorer believes he has filmed the first fight and arrest captured on Glass in Wildwood, New Jersey on July 4th. Watch below.</p>

<p>It&apos;s hard to see the actual fight in Chris Barrett&apos;s video, but he says what&apos;s remarkable is that he was able to get so far into the crowd, and so close to the participants, without anyone noticing him filming. &#x201C;Otherwise, no one bothered me,&quot; he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928032938/http://www.showbiz411.com/2013/07/05/google-glass-first-public-fight-caught-live">told Showbiz 411.</a> &quot;I was able to get much closer with the glasses than if I had had a camera. I even got up behind a cop and he didn&#x2019;t say a word to me.&#x201D; </p>

<p>&#x201C;I think if I had a bigger camera there, the kid would probably have punched me,&#x201D; Barrett <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928032938/http://venturebeat.com/2013/07/05/i-filmed-the-first-fight-and-arrest-through-google-glass/">told Venture Beat</a>. &#x201C;But I was able to capture the action with Glass and I didn&#x2019;t have to hold up a cell phone and press record.&#x201D; Overall, he sounds more excited than nervous about the video capabilities: &#x201C;This is a huge step in citizen journalism,&#x201D; Barrett said. &#x201C;If Google Glass takes off, everyone&#x2019;s going to have their entire life captured&#x2026;first words, first steps&#x2026;but also people getting shot, and natural disasters.&#x201D;</p>
