<p>It&apos;s hard to believe it&apos;s been a year since the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504194846/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/03/game_of_thrones_power_rankings_rain.php">Red Wedding and the attendant blood-curdling screams</a>, but HBO&apos;s beloved epic <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504194846/http://gothamist.com/tags/gameofthrones"><em>Game Of Thrones</em></a> returns for Season 4 this Sunday night at 9 p.m. We&apos;ve just about reached the halfway point of the entire series (give or take George R.R. Martin grabbing a flagon of wine, putting on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504194846/http://grrm.livejournal.com/321271.html">a Jets jersey</a>, and locking himself in the New Mexico equivalent of Castle Black until HBO <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504194846/http://www.vanityfair.com/vf-hollywood/game-of-thrones-movie">agrees to a prequel or movie</a>)&#x2014;and for the first time, characters and storylines have begun to collide and commingle rather than just expand ever outward. There&apos;s no excuse for not knowing who Roose Bolton is anymore, although you will still be excused if you&apos;ve entirely forgotten about Rickon, because nobody cares about Rickon. </p>

<p>The first three episodes of the new season are as exciting as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504194846/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpAAsGhRm-E">a bear vs maiden cage match</a> right out of the gate; with three seasons of plotlines under their belt, showrunners David Benioff and D.B. Weiss are able to plug us right back into the action without a stutter (that includes a monumental second episode written by Martin). We&apos;ll have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504194846/http://gothamist.com/tags/gameofthronespowerrankings">weekly Power Rankings</a> just like last year, but in the meantime, check out 20 or so ways to inject <em>Game Of Thrones</em> content directly into your cortex in anticipation of this Sunday.</p>

<p><em>Note: possible SPOILERS ahead.</em></p>

<p>First, you probably want to go over what happened in Season 3. HBO offers this 25 minute recap.</p>

<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="//web.archive.org/web/20150504194846if_/http://www.youtube.com/embed/38hnsgqf8O0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>Maybe you want something shorter. Here&apos;s a three minute, <em>just the facts Jack</em> version.</p>

<p>But considering one thing that makes <em>Game Of Thrones</em> the show so great are those long and winding monologues, maybe you really want to revisit the best scenes from Season 3.</p>

<p>&quot;<em>Boooooring</em>, give me the Emoji version,&quot; said at least one person.</p>

<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="//web.archive.org/web/20150504194846if_/http://www.youtube.com/embed/l0SYKT4FgGU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>However, if you can&apos;t watch videos at work (or don&apos;t have the time to invest 3-35 minutes of your day), you can get a primer on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504194846/http://www.buzzfeed.com/kateaurthur/game-of-thrones-season-4-premiere-finale">where we left off with everyone here</a>, and see a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504194846/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1725411/game-of-thrones-whos-who-gifs.jhtml">gif guide to all the characters here</a>. </p>

<p>Perhaps this is all way too advanced for you. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504194846/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/14/should_you_read_the_game_of_thrones.php">Maybe you&apos;ve never read the books</a> or seen the show, and are getting mighty tired of hearing your friends drone on and on about White Walkers and Targaryeans and Unsullied. In which case, here&apos;s a crash course on all three seasons.</p>

<p>Now that everyone is caught up, let&apos;s geek out with some statistics and GOT ephemera, including these cool charts (murders, animal deaths, rapes) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504194846/https://twitter.com/AnnaHolmes">via Anna Holmes</a>.</p>

<p>And an &quot;honest trailer&quot; for the show.</p>

<p>Laudatory reviews for Season 4 have begun pouring in as well, and some of the best TV writers out there have weighed in, including <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504194846/http://grantland.com/features/game-of-thrones-season-four-hbo-returns/">Andy Greenwald at Grantland</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504194846/http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/post-red-wedding-game-thrones-works-find-itself-202952">Sonia Saraiya at AV Club</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504194846/http://time.com/47347/game-of-thrones-season-4-review/">James Poniewozik at Time</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504194846/http://popwatch.ew.com/2014/04/04/game-of-thrones-review-season-4/">EW</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504194846/http://www.salon.com/2014/04/03/game_of_thrones_season_4_review_violence_humor_revenge/">Salon</a> and more.

<p>HBO offers this &quot;foreshadowing&quot; video for Season 4.</p>

<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="//web.archive.org/web/20150504194846if_/http://www.youtube.com/embed/J5iS3tULXMQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>If you&apos;re in the mood to read speculation and spoilers about what&apos;s coming in the new season (which will use the second half of <em>A Storm Of Swords</em> plus likely parts of <em>A Feast For Crows</em>), there are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504194846/http://www.heavy.com/entertainment/2014/03/game-of-thrones-season-4-book-spoilers-deaths/">plenty</a> of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504194846/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/04/04/game-of-thrones-theories_n_5031083.html">places</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504194846/http://www.vulture.com/2013/06/what-will-happen-season-4-of-game-of-thrones.html">to do that.</a> Just don&apos;t click on any of those links unless you REALLY want to know.</p>

<p>And finally, maybe all you want right now is to see what <em>GOT</em> would look like if it were a &apos;70s sitcom.</p>
