Jeffrey Ritter, 32, of East New York, has been charged with criminal sexual act, robbery and sexual abuse. &quot;I didn&apos;t do it! I didn&apos;t do it!&quot; he yelled at reporters while being walked to the NYPD Special Victim&apos;s Unit headquarters in East Harlem.<p></p>

<p>According <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110604020422/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2011/06/02/2011-06-02_sicko_suspected_of_vicious_sex_assault_on_85yearold_woman_on_upper_east_side_arr.html">to the News</a>, Ritter is unemployed, lives with his transgender girlfriend and does odd jobs around the building, such as taking out the trash. He is heavily tattooed: most prominently, he has a NY Yankees logo beneath his left eye, and the name &quot;Tahtianna&quot; above his left eyebrow. On one side of his neck are the words &quot;Slow Poke,&quot; and on the other the initials &quot;SHLK.&quot; You can get a better look at the Yankees tattoo <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110604020422/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/nd_sex_fiend_prowls_upper_east_JUdKCiaQVyV6BxjuCWuPzI?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">here</a>.</p>

<p>On Memorial Day, the elderly woman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110604020422/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/01/cops_seek_suspect_who_sexually_assa.php">was attacked</a> before 6 a.m., on East 83rd Street near Madison Avenue. As the News reported, &quot;He grabbed her and dragged her down to the sunken stoop of a five-story building, where he forced her to perform oral sex before stealing a ring and fleeing. A nearby doorman ran up to the woman as the creep fled.&quot; The NYPD later released a surveillance camera still of the tattooed, Hispanic attacker.</p>
