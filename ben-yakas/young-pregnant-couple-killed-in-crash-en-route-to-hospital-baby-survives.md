<p>A young Orthodox husband and his pregnant wife were both killed in a car crash in Brooklyn yesterday while on their way to the hospital&#x2014;but their baby was born prematurely, and survived. According to police, Nathan and Raizi Glauber, both 21, were in the back of a black 2008 Toyota Camry livery cab on their way to a local hospital just after midnight when a grey 2010 BMW sedan slammed into them on Kent Avenue and Wilson Street.</p>

<p>At least one other car was involved in the incident; the driver of the BMW fled the scene on foot. Raizi Glauber was thrown from the car on impact and ended up under a parked tractor trailer. The couple had been on their way to Long Island College Hospital to see a doctor about an issue regarding her pregnancy. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504151226/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/expecting-parents-killed-brooklyn-car-crash-en-route-hospital-baby-survives-article-1.1278183">The Daily News reports</a> that despite Raizi Glauber being six months pregnant, EMTs from the Hatzolah ambulance service were able to deliver the baby boy before they reached the hospital. </p>

<p>The baby, who is just four pounds, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504151226/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local/new_york&amp;id=9013772">is in stable condition</a> in the ICU at Bellevue Hospital and and expected to live. Raizi Glauber died at Bellevue Hospital, while her husband was pronounced dead at Beth Israel Hospital. The livery driver was taken to Bellevue Hospital, where he is in stable condition.</p>

<p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s just unbelievable knowing that this child will now be raised without parents,&#x201D; community leader Isaac Abraham <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504151226/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2013/03/03/couple-killed-en-route-to-hospital-to-deliver-baby/">told CBS</a>. &#x201D;The impact will be from the schools to the shuls, to friends and neighbors. And the outreach will be tremendous.&#x201D; He added to the BMW driver: &#x201C;Give yourself up before we find you.&#x201D;</p>
