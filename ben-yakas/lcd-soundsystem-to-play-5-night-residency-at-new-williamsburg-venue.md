<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170331002316/http://gothamist.com/tags/lcdsoundsystem">LCD Soundsystem</a> is playing at your house in a few weeks, if your house happens to be the big new Williamsburg music venue Brooklyn Steel, in which case, I&apos;d be seriously concerned about (or...impressed with?) the long-term viability of your current living arrangement. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170331002316/http://gothamist.com/2016/12/06/brooklyn_steel_east_williamsburg.php">Brooklyn Steel</a>, the industrial-chic new music venue with an 1,800 audience capacity and supposedly top-notch acoustics, will open in East Williamsburg with a five-night residency from LCD Soundsystem on April 6th, 7th, 8th, 10th &amp; 11th (it is unclear what April 9th did to piss off the band, maybe it criticized <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170331002316/http://gothamist.com/2015/07/21/mta_lcd_beersystem.php">one of James Murphy&apos;s unwieldy passion projects</a>). Tickets for all five shows will go on sale Thursday, March 30th at noon&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170331002316/http://www.axs.com/series/4139/lcd-soundsystem-tickets?skin=brooklynsteel">you can purchase tickets here.</a></p>

<p>(Additionally, a limited number of tickets per show will be available for purchase in-person at the no-fee Mercury Lounge and Music Hall of Williamsburg box offices, while supplies last. Line forms at 11 a.m. on Thursday, and there is a strict two-ticket limit per person/household, per event night and across the five-night run.)</p>

<p>The roster of live acts already booked to play Brooklyn Steel includes The Decemberists, PJ Harvey, Pixies, Two Door Cinema Club, Tycho, Chairlift, Real Estate, Whitney, Mitski, NAO, Ween, Dawes, Goldfrapp, Catfish and the Bottlemen, Slowdive, Clutch, Perfume Genius, Animal Collective, Laura Marling, Frightened Rabbit and The Specials. You can see their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170331002316/http://www.bowerypresents.com/brooklyn-steel/">full lineup here.</a></p>

<p>LCD Soundsystem reunited in the winter of 2015/2016 less than five years after a very grand, very public breakup tour, with the promise of a new album forthcoming. The band jumped to Columbia Records to release their first post-retirement record, although that 2016 deadline has long since passed, and there have been few updates on when the new music might come. All things considered, we&apos;re always excited for new LCD music, and this would be a pretty perfect occasion to premiere it. And worst case scenario, a few hours dancing ourselves clean still seems fun as hell: </p>
