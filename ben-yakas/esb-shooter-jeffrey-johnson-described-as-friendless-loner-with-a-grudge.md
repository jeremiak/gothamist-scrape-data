<p>Yesterday, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522031001/http://gothamist.com/2012/08/24/five_shot_outside_empire_state_buil.php#photo-1">two people were killed and nine others were injured</a> after a disgruntled ex-employee killed his former boss near the Empire State Building. Shooter Jeffrey Johnson, 58, used a .45-caliber handgun to kill Steve Ercolino, 41, his former boss at Hazan Imports, outside the company offices at 10 W. 33rd Street just after 9 a.m. A more complete picture is now emerging about Johnson, whom neighbors and former co-workers describe as a friendless, mellow, &quot;neat freak&quot; loner who held a grudge against Ercolino.</p>

<p>The super of Johnson&apos;s six-story walk up on East 82nd Street, where he lived for about 18 months, told the Times Johnson <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522031001/http://gothamist.com/2012/08/24/esb_shooting.php#photo-1">had a routine he stuck to</a> every day, which included always wearing a tannish brown suit and taking a morning trip to McDonald&apos;s: &quot;This guy was very mellow,&quot; Guillermo Suarez <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522031001/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/24/jeffrey-johnson-empire-state-building-shooter_n_1828692.html">told HuffPo</a>. &quot;Very mellow and very lonely.&quot; </p>

<p>Neighbor Gisela Casella, who lived upstairs from Johnson, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522031001/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2012/08/24/neighbor-alleged-midtown-shooter-was-nicest-guy-but-a-little-weird/">told CBS he was</a> &quot;the nicest guy,&quot; and she couldn&apos;t believe what happened: &#x201C;He would always wear nice suits, beige, tie, so I said to myself &#x2018;Boy he must have some job,&#x2019; maybe works in a bank. He&#x2019;s a big shot,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;I knew he was a little weird because he was a neat freak, put [his] name very neatly by the door.&quot; Casella also told the News that she never saw him on a date: &#x201C;He never had a girlfriend. I used to think he deserved a nice girlfriend.&#x201D;</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522031001/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/25/nyregion/in-empire-state-killing-a-grudge-boiled-over.html?_r=1&amp;partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">Times reports that</a> Johnson attended Ringling College of Art and Design in Sarasota, Fla., from 1978 to 1980, leaving a year shy of the three years required for a certificate. Co-workers told them that he spoke cryptically of past military service; he told a former landlord, Kathleen Walsh, that he was a sharpshooter. </p>

<p>He also owned his own T-shirt design company called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522031001/http://www.stjollytshirtart.com/care/">St. Jolly T-Shirt Co.</a>, with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522031001/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/killer_sexpot_doodle_fetish_f7OHFbtYTF1VuVnVQXRVeK">lots of drawings</a> of women and motorcycles. He set up the website last October, after he had been fired. You can see two videos from his Youtube channel below:</p>

The NY Times said that they had at least one physical altercation in the office, which led to Ercolino getting an order of protection against Johnson.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522031001/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Empire-State-Building-Shooting-Suspect-Jeffrey-Johnson-167331715.html">NBC sheds more light</a> on their animosity: according to a police report, Johnson confronted Ercolino inside an elevator at their office and told him, &quot;I am going to kill you.&quot;  Law enforcement sources told them that Johnson blamed Ercolino for not pushing his line of products at Hazan enough, leading to poor sales. &quot;I know there was animosity between them,&quot; said Nicholas D&apos;Aurizio, who began working at Hazan after Johnson had left. &quot;I know they had a not so great past. But nothing that would ever make you believe that something like this would happen.&quot;</p>

<p>&#x201C;This guy was very eccentric,&#x201D; one co-worker <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522031001/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/25/nyregion/in-empire-state-killing-a-grudge-boiled-over.html?pagewanted=2&amp;_r=1&amp;partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">told the Times</a> about Johnson. &#x201C;He was so detail-oriented. If he had a free minute, he would start doing origami. The things that came out of his mind were so original and creative, you knew that his mind didn&#x2019;t work the same way as normal people. But you worked with the guy so long, that you just chalked it up to Jeff being Jeff.&#x201D;</p>
