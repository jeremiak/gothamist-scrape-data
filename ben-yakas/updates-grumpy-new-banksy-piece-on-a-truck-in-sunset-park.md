After <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510022807/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/25/new_banksy_is_at_elizabeth_and_hous.php">making us wait all day</a> yesterday for his ghoulish Blue Oyster Cult-referencing bumper car Grim Reaper, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510022807/http://gothamist.com/tags/banksy">Banksy</a> was much more forthcoming with his latest open air piece today. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510022807/http://banksy.co.uk/2013/10/26/sunset-park">newest work</a> is an &quot;alternative New York bumper slogan&quot; on a truck somewhere in Sunset Park: &quot;The grumpier you are the more assholes you meet.&quot; </p>

<p>It&apos;s unclear whether the truck is moving around&#x2014;a la the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510022807/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/05/lastest_banksy_piece_is_inside_a_mo.php#photo-1">Waterfall mobile</a> or the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510022807/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/11/stuffed_animal_truck_is_the_work_of.php#photo-1">stuffed animal convoy</a>&#x2014;or stationary like the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510022807/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/15/photos_les_banksy_being_dismantled.php#photo-1">LES car</a>. We&apos;ll update once we know more.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: According <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510022807/http://animalnewyork.com/2013/banksyny-26-sunset-park/">to AnimalNY</a>, the truck is standstill, and can be found at 131 47th Street between 1st and 2nd Avenues.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: Nic Garcia went down to see the truck, and saw a lot of people dirt tagging the truck. He said there were no guards or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510022807/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/18/a_guide_to_banksys_nyc_team.php">Banksy team members</a>, &quot;just Banksy fans, and a surprisingly small number of us. Industrial area, nobody working.&quot;</p>
