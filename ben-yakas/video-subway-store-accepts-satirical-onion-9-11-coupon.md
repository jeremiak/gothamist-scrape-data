<p>The Onion was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150713104015/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/11/att_apologized_for_this_911_twitter.php">prescient as usual</a> last week when it &quot;reported&quot; on a new <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150713104015/http://www.theonion.com/articles/new-subway-promotion-to-honor-subtember-11,33768/?ref=auto">Subway promotion to honor September 11th</a>: &#x201C;From the Structural Steel Melt on Tower 7-Grain bread to the Twin Chowers cold cut combo with Ground Zero-Carb vinaigrette on a Let&#x2019;s Whole Wheat Roll, we&#x2019;ve got something for everybody this Subtember 11.&#x201D; One man decided to prank his friend into thinking the deal was real&#x2014;only as you can see in the video below, at least one Subway store ended up actually accepting the coupon!</p>

<p>Video uploader Travis Northup explained what happened: </p>

<blockquote>I played a prank on my friend and convinced him that The Onion&apos;s satirical 9/11 deal was a real promotion, and when he and my other co-worker (who was in on it) went to grab the food Subway actually honored the promotion. I gave my co-worker a blown up version of the picture that The Onion made for their article and they accepted it. I have a receipt showing a subtotal of $9.11 before taxes. My mind was blown.</blockquote>

<p>As you can hear, the men asked three times whether &quot;that&apos;s a good coupon,&quot; only to walk out of the store slightly in disbelief. You can see a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150713104015/http://imgur.com/a/zQQU6">photo of the receipt showing the $9.11 price here.</a></p>

<p>The Onion&apos;s article came a day after Kenneth Cole <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150713104015/http://gawker.com/kenneth-cole-volunteers-to-die-in-syria-1258930718">was widely criticized</a> for using Syria as a way to sell shoes. Similarly, Subway was not amused by The Onion&apos;s joke:</p>
