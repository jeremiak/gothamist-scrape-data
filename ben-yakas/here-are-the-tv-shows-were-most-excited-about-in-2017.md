<p>There were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170319100003/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/proof-tv-full-list-1400-859851">over 400 original scripted TV shows</a> in production last year. That number will almost certainly increase in 2017, thanks to streaming services&apos; &quot;throw a bunch of shows at the viewers and see what sticks&quot; ethos. It will probably get up to the thousands by the time President Trump mandates that <em>Celebrity President</em> be on at any given time of day. Amidst all these options, it can feel overwhelming keeping track of what&apos;s worth watching and what isn&apos;t. Below, check out a list of our most anticipated shows for the first half of 2017. </p>

<p><strong>Taboo (FX, January 10th):</strong> What&apos;s better than Tom Hardy putting on another one of his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170319100003/http://grantland.com/hollywood-prospectus/the-growing-menagerie-of-bizarre-tom-hardy-accents/">bizarre accents</a> for a passion project? Tom Hardy putting on one of his bizarre accents for a passion project he co-wrote <em>with his dad</em>, Chips Hardy! <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170319100003/http://www.avclub.com/review/taboo-too-enthralled-its-own-secrets-248171">Early reviews</a> indicate that this show&#x2014;about an early 19th century adventurer who returns to England to avenge his father&#x2019;s death and comes head-to-head with the British East India Company, as personified by the wonderful Jonathan Pryce (Bernie Sparrow himself)&#x2014;is too grim and takes itself too seriously. But for those of us who need our fix of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170319100003/http://www.digitalspy.com/tv/news/a818509/tom-hardy-taboo-viewers-mumbling-complaints/">Tom Hardy mumbling</a>, this is must-see TV. </p>

<p><strong>The Young Pope (HBO, January 15th):</strong> Jude Law stars <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170319100003/http://gothamist.com/2017/01/09/more_like_young_nope.php">as the Jerk Pope</a> who loves Cherry Cola and cigarettes. Expect papal intrigue, Diane Keaton, lots of opulent white outfits, and the answer to the age-old question: how old is the Young Pope?</p>

<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170319100003if_/https://www.youtube.com/embed/6we2blItR4s" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p><strong>Homeland (Showtime, January 15th):</strong> What is Carrie Mathison doing living in Brooklyn? Didn&apos;t Quinn have major brain damage last season? How are Saul Berenson and Dar Adal still federal employees? Has this show gotten better since Brody died? Who in their right minds would allow Carrie to work for the government again? Is NYC going to be the target of a fictional terror attack? In what episode will Carrie inevitably go off her meds? We&apos;ll all have to watch to find out. </p>

<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170319100003if_/https://www.youtube.com/embed/6EBmdbsWTNE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p><strong>Legion (FX, Feb. 8th):</strong> If you put a gun to my head&#x2014;or if you, say, used your telekinetic abilities to hold a gun to my head&#x2014;I would say this is my number one most anticipated new show of the winter. The fact that it is tangentially related to the Marvel Universe (or, more accurately, to the Fox-owned continuity-be-damned X-Men movie universe) is just a cherry on top. The reason I&apos;m excited is because of showrunner Noah Hawley, who somehow made <em>Fargo</em>, a TV adaptation/extension of the classic Coen Brothers movie, into one of the best shows on air. Throw in a fantastic cast (Dan Stevens, Aubrey Plaza, Jean Smart, and Rachel Keller, among others), some suitably trippy and inventive visuals (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170319100003/http://ew.com/tv/2017/01/10/legion-marvel-x-men-fx/">&quot;It&#x2019;s David&#x2019;s experience of the world&quot;</a>), and inspiration taken equally from Pink Floyd and Chris Claremont, this has the makings of something special. </p>

 <br>
<strong>Girls (HBO, Feb. 12th):</strong> <em>Girls</em> got its mojo back last season, digging deeper into what it does best: tell mostly-contained short stories about damaged but (somewhat) sympathetic characters. If this final season <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170319100003/http://gothamist.com/2017/01/09/girls_final_season_trailer.php">continues the trajectory</a>, we expect another great season ahead, a moving and funny ending for a show that was always best when it wasn&apos;t trying to be the voice of a generation. (Although if everything is leading up to Hannah becoming a successful writer after EVERYTHING, hoo boy.)</p>

<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170319100003if_/https://www.youtube.com/embed/qSZ_ofVH-oE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p><strong>Big Little Lies (HBO, Feb. 19th):</strong> Holy Spicoli does this show have star power: Reese Witherspoon, Nicole Kidman, Shailene Woodley, Laura Dern, Alexander Skarsg&#xE5;rd, Adam Scott, and Zo&#xEB; Kravitz make up the main cast for this adaptation of the best-selling novel about abusive relationships, Californian living and <em>murder</em>. The trailers look good, TV vet David E. Kelly is the showrunner, and it&apos;s a miniseries that knows exactly where it&apos;s going&#x2014;at best, it&apos;ll be an acting tour de force that nets Witherspoon an Emmy next fall, at worst, a soapy story with some very pretty sunset vistas.</p>

<p><strong>Crashing (HBO, Feb. 19th):</strong> Will this be the year that Pete Holmes breaks out? The veteran stand-up comic has been on the verge of something big for awhile now (RIP <em>The Pete Holmes Show</em>), and with this autobiographical comedy produced by Judd Apatow (who also directed the pilot), it seems he may have finally found the right vessel for his talents. The show revolves around Holmes&apos; character divorcing his wife and subsequently couchsurfing his way across the city while struggling to make it in comedy&#x2014;just as he (basically) did in real life. </p>

<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170319100003if_/https://www.youtube.com/embed/U1vPbiStGAg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p><strong>Feud (FX, March 7th):</strong> Ryan Murphy went from the showrunner whose shows all tanked after season two (see: <em>Nip/Tuck</em>, <em>Popular</em>) to the showrunner with a golden touch (see: <em>American Crime Story</em>, <em>American Horror Story</em>). While it&apos;s not clear when the next Katrina-centric season of <em>Crime Story</em> will be released (perhaps later in 2017?), his latest anthology series about famous feuds will premiere before that. This eight-episode season will focus on the rivalry between divas Joan Crawford (Jessica Lange) and Bette Davis (Susan Sarandon) during the production of <em>What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?</em>, and sounds like it&apos;s right in his wheelhouse: real-life drama mixed with campy hysteria as performed by some of Murphy&apos;s favorite actresses (and yes, the wonderful Sarah Paulson is in the cast too). </p>

<p><strong>The Americans (FX, March 7th):</strong> The best show on TV returns for its penultimate season sometime this spring (likely late March or April). Philip and Elizabeth <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170319100003/http://ew.com/tv/2016/12/22/americans-season-5/">will be getting</a> new personas (Brad and Dee Eckert); Paige&apos;s nascent spying career will continue; Henry might actually get something to do (!?!); the FBI will be &quot;off in a new direction that we think will be intriguing;&quot; Stan is getting a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170319100003/http://tvline.com/2016/10/19/the-americans-laurie-holden-season-5-cast-fx/">new love interest</a>; and everything is probably gonna go to shit for everyone we care about at some point. Every season has every-so-subtly upped the ante and improved on the last, and we expect no difference now. </p>

<p><strong>Iron Fist (Netflix, March 17th):</strong> Here&apos;s the fourth entry in Netflix&apos;s Marvel Universe, which has proven to be the best television extension of the Marvel brand (sorry ABC), especially when it comes to exploring the origins of its less-well-known heroes (see: the excellent first seasons of <em>Jessica Jones</em> and <em>Luke Cage</em>). <em>Game Of Thrones</em>&apos; Finn Jones stars as the titular character, whose origins are a lot like Batman&apos;s in <em>Batman Begins</em> (except with more <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170319100003/http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/entertainthis/2016/03/17/marvels-iron-fist-casting-kicks-asian-representation-while-its-down/81915698/">representation issues</a>). But he&apos;s really not Batman, we swear&#x2014;he&apos;s just your run-of-the-mill rich guy who wears a costume and punches bad guys using martial arts and mysticism. </p>

<p><strong>The Handmaid&apos;s Tale (Hulu, April 26th):</strong> Elisabeth Moss stars in this adaptation of Margaret Atwood&apos;s classic piece of speculative fiction, which deals with a totalitarian theocracy taking over the country and setting women&apos;s rights back hundreds of years in the process. The book&apos;s themes feel more relevant than ever (sadly), and Hulu has been looking for the prestige project that would put them on the same level as Netflix and Amazon&#x2014;and this may be it. Also, don&apos;t expect everything to be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170319100003/http://ew.com/article/2016/12/02/elisabeth-moss-handmaids-tale-hulu-first-look/">wrapped up in one season</a>&#x2014;they want this to be their <em>House Of Cards</em>.</p>

<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170319100003if_/https://www.youtube.com/embed/Dre0wQmLGe8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p><strong>American Gods (Starz, April):</strong> It was a huge blow to Trekkies when Bryan Fuller announced he was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170319100003/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/bryan-fuller-as-star-trek-discovery-showrunner-941587">no longer showrunner</a> for the upcoming new series (<em>Star Trek: Discovery</em>). But one show&apos;s loss is another&apos;s gain&#x2014;and in this case, we&apos;re very excited about how he&apos;s going to adapt Neil Gaiman&apos;s classic <em>American Gods</em>, which is all about a battle between old Gods and new (Media, Internet, Intangibles). A dollop of <em>Hannibal</em>-worthy gothic/surreal atmosphere, a generous helping of Ian McShane monologues, and a whole lot of world-building to cover has got us pumped for this one. </p>

<p><strong>The Leftovers (HBO, April 16th):</strong> The most depressing (and oftentimes beautiful) show on TV about family, miracles and the healing power of smoking cigarettes returns after a year-long break for its third and final season. We know both the Garvey and Murphy clans will be back; we know the season will partially take place in Texas and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170319100003/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/leftovers-is-moving-australia-season-888077">partially in Australia</a> (which, lest you forgot, is where Kevin Garvey Sr. was last seen). Will we have another visit to the purgatory-like afterlife? Will the show explain the origins of the Sudden Departure? How many times will Carrie Coon and/or Regina King make us cry? </p>

<p><strong>Twin Peaks (Showtime, May 21st):</strong> That gum you like is finally coming back into style this spring. After years of false starts and premature hope, we are getting 18 hours of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170319100003/http://laist.com/2017/01/09/twin_peaks_2017.php">&quot;the pure heroin version of David Lynch.&quot;</a> All we know is that the new season is a closed-ended, one-time event, there are approximately <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170319100003/http://screencrush.com/showtime-twin-peaks-premiere-may/">10,000 actors in it</a>, and it will be must-see TV for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170319100003/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3IrMM0jc9M">Red Room fanatics</a>. And hopefully, we&apos;ll find out <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170319100003/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMMoRyC9Eaw">how&apos;s Annie.</a></p>

<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170319100003if_/https://www.youtube.com/embed/d714bEXFny4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p><strong>Fargo (FX, Spring):</strong> The best anthology series on TV couldn&apos;t come back soon enough. After season two jumped in time to 1979, season three will take place in 2010, and could include appearances from characters from season one (including the wonderful Molly Solverson). But even if it doesn&apos;t, the new cast is stacked: Ewan McGregor plays brothers (one of whom is the &quot;Parking Lot King Of Minnesota&quot;), Carrie Coon is the female lead, and there&apos;s a who&apos;s-who of characters actors filling in all the other colorful roles and trying on their best midwestern accents (Jim Gaffigan, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Scoot McNairy, David Thewlis, Michael Stuhlbarg, Shea Whigham, Karan Soni, Fred Melamed and Thomas Mann). </p>

<p><strong>Game Of Thrones (HBO, Summer):</strong> There are only seven new episodes coming in season seven, but they are expected to be even <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170319100003/http://winteriscoming.net/2017/01/03/will-episodes-game-thrones-season-7-supersized/">bigger than ever</a> (both in terms of set pieces and possible episode length). Everything seems to be consolidating toward a huge battle between Dany&apos;s forces and Cersei&apos;s at King&apos;s Landing, with every available family seemingly taking a side in the war. And there is still the matter of those pesky White Walkers at the gates of The Wall. Of course you&apos;re going to watch it&#x2014; how else are you going to find out whether Gendry is going to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170319100003/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/27/game_of_thrones_power_rankings_the_10.php">row back into the story?</a> </p>

<p><strong>Curb Your Enthusiasm (HBO, TBD):</strong> We&apos;re not saying that Bernie Sanders <em>had</em> to be sacrificed so that we could get <em>Curb</em> back...but that <em>is</em> what happened. After six years on hiatus, David is getting the band back together for a new season of sublime neurotic comedy. This seems as good a time as any to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170319100003/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHuNNslDowU">renew our vows</a> with the show: it&apos;s a <em>very</em> good show. Nine years! Pretty, prettttty, pretty goooood. And I am your devoted servant. Well, I don&#x2019;t know about servant. I&#x2019;ll certainly watch you.</p>

<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170319100003if_/https://www.youtube.com/embed/fW7YuXFSa_g" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p><strong>Nathan For You (Comedy Central, TBD):</strong> Besides some cameos in a few movies (including the underrated <em>Popstar</em>), Nathan Fielder was unusually quiet in 2016. Almost <em>too</em> quiet. We can only imagine he&apos;s been hard at work performing small business miracles across the country. Or maybe he&apos;s just been working for Pepsi part time.</p>

<strong>Review (Comedy Central, TBD):</strong> My <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170319100003/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/27/the_best_tv_shows_of_2015.php">favorite comedy of 2015</a> is getting a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170319100003/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/andy-dalys-review-end-shortened-867351">shortened season three</a> to finish off the tragic story of Forrest MacNeil, a professional critic who took it upon himself to review real life experiences on his program &quot;Review With Forrest MacNeil.&quot; Forrest (as played by the brilliant Andy Daly) has tried cocaine, eaten far too many pancakes, destroyed his marriage, and even served prison time throughout the first two seasons. But it can&apos;t get worse than the death of invisible friend Clovers...can it?</p>

<p><strong>Rick &amp; Morty (Adult Swim, TBD):</strong> The most manic, over-caffeinated sci-fi cartoon in history was sadly absent in 2016, but season three is due out any minute now (if you <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170319100003/http://www.idigitaltimes.com/rick-and-morty-season-3-release-date-will-mr-poopy-buttholes-secret-gif-code-reveal-574501">stare at Mr. Poopy Butthole</a> long enough, you can see the future apparently). Season two left off with Rick being imprisoned in galactic jail for the sake of his family, but don&apos;t expect that to last too long. </p>

<p><strong>The Deuce (HBO, TBD):</strong> With <em>GoT</em> likely being pushed back &apos;til early summer, there&apos;s a chance we won&apos;t see the latest show from David Simon and George Pelecanos until the fall. But it sounds like it&apos;s worth the wait: <em>The Deuce</em> is a sprawling look at the porn industry in Times Square in the 1970&apos;s, starring James Franco as twin brothers and Maggie Gyllenhaal as an entrepreneurial sex worker. Zoe Kazan, Ralph Macchio, and several <em>Wire</em> alums (Anwar Glover, Chris Bauer, Larry Gilliard Jr., Gbenga Akinnagbe) fill out the cast; Michelle MacLaren directed the pilot; and the writers room includes some of the best in the industry, including Richard Price, Megan Abbott, and Lisa Lutz. </p>
