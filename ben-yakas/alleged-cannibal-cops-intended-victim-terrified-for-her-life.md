<p>Last month, an NYPD officer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509002410/http://gothamist.com/tags/cannibalcop">was arrested for allegedly attempting</a> to &quot;kidnap women and cook them.&quot; Gilberto Valle&#x2014;a 28-year-old, married six-year veteran of the NYPD&#x2014;has been charged with conspiracy to kidnap and accessing a computer without authorization. Yesterday, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509002410/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/cannibal-intended-victim-terrified-article-1.1199849?localLinksEnabled=false">he was denied bail after</a> a lawyer for one of his intended victims said that his client &#x201C;is terrified for her life and safety if he should be released.&#x201D;</p>

<p>&quot;She&apos;s frightened, confined to her own home with her mother,&quot; said Michelle Mechanic, the lawyer for the woman identified as &quot;Victim 2&quot; in the complaint. &quot;She won&apos;t leave her small apartment out of abject fear...She can&apos;t imagine what she would do if he is released from custody.&quot; In <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509002410/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/25/fbi_arrests_nypd_officer_for_attemp.php#photo-1">an instant messenger conversation about</a> the plan on February 28th, Valle and a co-conspirator discussed plans to knock the woman out, then cook her.  </p>

<p>&quot;It is going to be so hard to restrain myself when I knock her out, but I am aspiring to be a professional kidnapper and that&apos;s business,&quot; he wrote. &quot;But I will really get off on knocking her out, tying her hands and bare feet and gagging her...I think I would rather not get involved in the rape. You paid for her. She is all yours and I don&apos;t want to be tempted the next time I abduct a girl.&quot; </p>

<p>Others who were on the list of around 100 women that Valle kept&#x2014;he was turned in by his wife after she discovered his &#x201C;tactical plan,&#x201D; which he called his blueprint for &#x201C;Abducting and Cooking&quot;&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509002410/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/27/women_freaked-out_over_inclusion_on.php">were also significantly freaked out</a> about being included: &#x201C;I was so shaken when I found out it was him,&#x201D; Beverly Seiger previously said. &#x201C;I used to walk his dog. I&#x2019;ve been to his house many times. He&#x2019;s been to my house.&#x201D;</p>
