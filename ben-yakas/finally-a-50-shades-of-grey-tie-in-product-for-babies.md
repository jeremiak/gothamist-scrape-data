<p>Last week, we had some fun diving into the thriving <em>50 Shades of Grey</em> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429103813/http://gothamist.com/2012/08/11/the_top_5_worst_50_shades_of_grey_t.php">secondary market</a>&#x2014;and we spent quite some time flicking through the 2,000+ <em>50 Shades</em>-related lifestyle items on Etsy. But <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429103813/http://www.regretsy.com/2012/08/15/laters-baby/">Regretsy pointed us</a> to what has to be the most brilliant/horrible items we&apos;ve seen: <em>50 Shades</em> baby products. Because nothing says &quot;9 months ago my mommy read Fifty Shades Of Grey&#x2026; and my dad was too lazy to wear a condom&quot; like these baby onesies. Check out <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429103813/http://www.etsy.com/shop/ExpressiveDesigns01?ref=seller_info_count">more baby products here</a>! What&apos;s next? <em>50 Shades of Grey</em> lunch boxes reading, &quot;Beat Me, Feed Me&quot;?</p>
