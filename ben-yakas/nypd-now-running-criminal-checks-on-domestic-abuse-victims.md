<p>It&apos;s already very difficult prosecuting <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130318030830/http://gothamist.com/tags/domesticabuse">domestic abuse</a> cases, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130318030830/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/26/wifebeaters_are_as_dumb_as_youd_ima.php">because 75 percent of the time</a> the women who were victimized stop helping prosecutors&#x2014;thankfully, wifebeaters like to brag about their misdeeds, and they are really, really dumb about it. But things are going to get even harder now that the NYPD has enacted a new directive: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130318030830/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/nypd_nab_the_victim_lXiQhecmrcMWX01cMEJ5JJ">according to the Post</a>, officers must run criminal checks on domestic abuse <em>victims</em> when they come forward. And if they have any warrants, even for minor offenses like unpaid tickets, a police source says &quot;you have no choice but to lock them up.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;This is going to deter victims of domestic violence,&quot; the police source said. &quot;They&apos;re going to be scared to come forward.&quot; The new directive, sent out in a memo on March 5th, has been set forth by Chief of Detectives Phil Pulaski, and already seems to be controversial among the rank and file. Their source said that the memo puts undue pressure on officers to make an arrest, even if someone was clearly battered by a spouse: &#x201C;We have every right to arrest that person at that moment,&#x201D; the source told the tabloid.</p>

<p>&#x201C;The majority of domestic-violence cases go unreported,&#x201D; said defense attorney Joseph Tacopina. &#x201C;This is just going to increase this percentage.&#x201D; Matrimonial lawyer Marilyn Chinitz agreed: &#x201C;That is very, very frightening. It would absolutely dissuade people. They would not report a crime because they would fear getting locked up. It would empower the perpetrator, and there&#x2019;s going to be more domestic violence as a consequence, and you&#x2019;re endangering children.&#x201D;</p>

<p>We&apos;ve contacted the NYPD for comment on the new policy.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: NYPD spokesman Paul Browne released this statement about the story: &quot;While it is standard practice and policy for detectives to investigate victims&#x2019; backgrounds to help lead them to the victims&#x2019; assailants, the NYPD - contrary to a published report  - has no  &#x201C;must arrest&#x201D; policy that applies to domestic violence  victims. In fact, the discovery of open warrants on domestic violence victims often results in their warrants being vacated.&quot;</p>
