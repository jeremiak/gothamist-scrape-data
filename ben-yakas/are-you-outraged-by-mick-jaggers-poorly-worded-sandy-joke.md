<p>Despite the fact that they had the shortest set of the many entertainers at last night&apos;s benefit <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121218192408/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/13/videos_photos_all-star_musicians_br.php#photo-1">12-12-12: The Concert For Sandy Relief at MSG</a>, it seems The Rolling Stones were able to stir up more controversy than Kanye West&apos;s skirt or Roger Daltrey&apos;s ageless bronze chest. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121218192408/http://washington.cbslocal.com/2012/12/12/jagger-sparks-some-controversy-with-comment-at-sandy-relief-concert-if-it-rains-in-london-youve-got-to-come-help-us/">Outraged articles</a> have been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121218192408/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/mick-jagger-sandy-humor-falls-flat-12-12-12-relief-concert-article-1.1219355">popping up</a> all over the web today over a joke Mick Jagger made during the show&#x2014;and it had nothing to do with his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121218192408/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/12/12/mick-jagger-moves-like-jagger_n_2287632.html">&quot;Moves Like Jagger&quot; remarks.</a> &quot; Before jumping into &quot;Jumpin&apos; Jack Flash,&quot; he said: <strong>&#x201C;But I&#x2019;ve got to say, if it rains in London, you&#x2019;ve got to come and help us, OK?&#x201D;</strong></p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="121312jagg.jpeg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20121218192408im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/121312jagg.jpeg" width="640" height="367"> <br> <i> The now-deleted offending Tweet</i></div> <p></p>

<p>Of course, nothing was helped when the &quot;joke&quot; was then Tweeted out on the Stones account (it was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121218192408/https://www.google.com/search?q=rains+in+london+rolling+stones+twitter&amp;oq=rains+in+london+rolling+stones+twitter&amp;aqs=chrome.0.57j62.7051&amp;sugexp=chrome,mod=5&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">subsequently deleted</a>). We&apos;ll confess that we didn&apos;t immediately pick up on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121218192408/http://www.mediaite.com/tv/mick-jagger-sparks-controversy-with-joke-about-americans-returning-the-favor-for-sandy-benefit-concert/">the controversial element</a> of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121218192408/http://twitchy.com/2012/12/13/jumpin-jackass-mick-jagger-tells-sandy-relief-victims-if-it-rains-in-london-youve-got-to-come-help-us/?utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;utm_medium=twitter">failed joke</a> at the time&#x2014;it is and was pretty apparent that he didn&apos;t mean anything insulting by it (as their Tweeting it out also attests). </p>

<p>Certainly, it wasn&apos;t a particularly <em>good</em> joke&#x2014;his other one about aging rockers (&#x201C;This has got to be the largest collection of old English musicians ever assembled in Madison Square Garden&#x201D;) was much better (and more accurate). So if Mick wants to get humorous, we can all agree that he should really stick to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121218192408/http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=r_I1-KvamTA">doing the rooster strut</a>, running <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121218192408/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUKKenvoH1U">rock and roll fantasy camps</a>, and maybe making the occasional <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121218192408/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-ZiYZ5pN3Y">pointed SNL cameo.</a> </p>
