<p>A 21-year-old skateboarder was fatally struck by a mini school bus with children onboard in The Bronx this morning. According to cops, Genielle Laboriel was skateboarding northbound on Melrose Avenue near 160th Street around 7:15 a.m. when she was struck by the bus. &quot;When the bus turned, she went under the front tire,&quot; Juanita Hernandez, a local resident who saw a neighbor&apos;s security camera footage of the incident, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131005005403/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/bronx/bronx-skateboarder-killed-mini-school-bus-carrying-children-article-1.1473968">told the Daily News</a>. &quot;In my opinion, it wasn&apos;t either one of their faults. I just think she lost control of the speed of her skateboard.&quot;</p>

<p>Hernandez claims that Laboriel was wearing headphones and no helmet. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131005005403/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20131002/morrisania/woman-dies-after-school-bus-hits-her-bronx-officials-says#slideshow_modal_slot_1">DNAInfo reports </a>that there were three kids on the bus at the time of the incident. Police add that there were no other reported injuries and the driver remained on scene. There are no arrests at this time and investigation is ongoing.</p>
