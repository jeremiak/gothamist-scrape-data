<p>A NJ man who served 15 years in prison for robbing a shoe store <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140608155831/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Man-Robs-Same-Store-Twice-Stride-Rite-Toms-River-Leaves-Prison-Robs-Store-252265861.html">attempted to rob that same shoe store</a> the day after he was released from prison. Christopher Miller, 40, was released from jail Friday, and his first stop as a free man on Saturday was at the Stride Rite shoe store in Toms River&#x2014;the same place he robbed in 1999. &quot;I knew who he was right away,&quot; the 43-year-old manager of Stride Rite, who worked there in 1999 when the first robbery occurred, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140608155831/http://nypost.com/2014/03/25/bandit-celebrates-release-from-prison-by-robbing-the-same-store/">told the Post</a>. &quot;I just think [he came back] because he didn&#x2019;t get anything the last time.&quot;</p>

<p>In 1999, then 25-year-old Miller tied up the manager, who was alone at the time, threatening her with a box cutter. On Saturday, Miller was more aggressive with her and a teenage employee. He ripped the drawer out of the cash register and took the $389 inside; when the two employees refused to go to a backroom or give him their car keys, he took their phones and ran. Police caught up to him down the block.</p>

<p>&quot;I have no idea what he was thinking,&quot; Officer Ralph Stocco from the Toms River Police Department told the Post. &quot;We thought it was extremely strange ourselves that he would just rob the same store a second time so many years later.&quot; Miller has been charged with robbery and is being held on $100,000 bail. Toms River Police Chief Mitchell Little told NBC he thinks Miller just wanted to go back to jail.</p>

<p>&quot;Maybe that&apos;s the only life he knows, and the only thing he could think of was going back to the same store and doing the same crime again&#x2014;getting caught and going back where he was taken care of and told what to do and getting meals and shelter and everything else,&quot; he said. </p>
