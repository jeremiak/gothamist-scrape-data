<p>After yesterday&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427162103/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/24/live_blog_katie_couric_interviews_m.php">riveting midday interview</a> with morning-turned-evening-turned-afternoon news host Katie Couric, we thought we had turned the page with this whole ridiculous <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427162103/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/23/manti_teo_admits_he_lied_about_fake.php">Manti Te&apos;o story</a>. Nope: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427162103/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/revealed_the_real_voice_of_fake_GfkurlQYJF0ZA6zzYtJmWI?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Local">the NY Post claims that</a> the female cousin of admitted hoaxer Ronaiah Tuiasosopo was heavily involved in the scam as well. Does that mean she&apos;ll have to write <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427162103/http://www.theonion.com/articles/i-just-want-to-apologize-to-manti-teo-for-what-i-p,30948/?ref=auto">an apology letter in The Onion as well</a>?</p>

<p>During the Couric interview yesterday, several voicemail message left by fake dead girlfriend Lennay Kekua were played on the air. After hearing the voicemails, one of Tino&#x2019;s cousins told The Post, &#x201C;There is no doubt whatsoever that it&#x2019;s Tino [Tuiasosopo].&quot; This despite the fact that Ronaiah Tuiasosopo <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427162103/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/24/manti_teo_hoaxer_admits_he_called_t.php">took full credit for the hoax</a> earlier this week, claiming he alone was behind late-night phone calls with Te&apos;o, and he altered his voice to play the part. </p>

<p>Te&#x2019;o told Couric yesterday that he always thought the voice he heard as Kekua was a woman. &#x201C;Well, it didn&#x2019;t sound like a man. It sounded like a woman,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;If he somehow made that voice, that&#x2019;s incredible, that&#x2019;s an incredible talent to do that. Especially every single day.&quot;</p>

<p>In one of the voicemails, Kekua accused Te&#x2019;o of having another girl in his room, saying, &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t know who answered your phone...I don&#x2019;t care. [Inaudible] I&#x2019;m trying. You made it clear what you want. Take care.&#x201D; One of the Post&apos;s sources said, &#x201C;That&#x2019;s the way [Tino] cries when she&#x2019;s feeling sorry for herself. Its her, that&#x2019;s the voice.&#x201D; Tino&apos;s father Bob declined to talk about the situation, but did say mysteriously: <strong>&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t want to divulge anything.&#x201D;</strong></p>

<p>To peel back the onion a little bit more, this is what Te&apos;o said Kekua told him about her relationship with her cousin Ronaiah Tuiasosopo during <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427162103/http://espn.go.com/college-football/story/_/id/8859544/highlights-manti-teo-interview-jeremy-schaap">his non-televised interview with ESPN</a>:</p>

<blockquote>MANTI TE&apos;O: I asked her sister, U&apos;i, and U&apos;i was supposed to bring her. But they were having an event for Lennay at that time in their hometown. And she couldn&apos;t make it. So she said that Ronaiah was going to bring her. So, she brought her to the hotel, the Ritz Carlton hotel, and that&apos;s when I first met her, and that&apos;s when I first met, face-to-face, Ronaiah.

<p>JEREMY SCHAAP: So who does this Ronaiah present himself as?</p>

<p>MANTI TE&apos;O: Ronaiah presents himself as Lennay&apos;s cousin, and the older brother of this little girl, Pookah.</p>

<p>JEREMY SCHAAP: What communication had you had with him prior to this?</p>

<p>MANTI TE&apos;O: The only communication I had with Ronaiah prior to this was he, in the beginning, when -- remember I told you when Lennay and I would talk and she&apos;d just leave, she would talk about Ronaiah. And how she and him were like Bonnie and Clyde: That was her cousin, her favorite cousin, and since I didn&apos;t know where Lennay was, the only one I knew of that probably knew where Lennay was was Ronaiah. So I was asking him, &quot;Do you know where your cousin went?&quot; And he said, &quot;Yeah, she went to Europe. Or, oh, yeah, I just saw her today, I&apos;ll tell her to contact you.&quot;</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>So yes&#x2014;perhaps Tino-as-Kekua was being more honest than Te&apos;o ever realized when she talked about her real cousin Ronaiah, and how they were like &quot;Bonnie and Clyde.&quot; And who knows <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427162103/http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/8856794/the-all-teo-mailbag">what new revelations</a> await us next: perhaps Te&apos;o will come out as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427162103/http://gawker.com/5940947/from-otherkin-to-transethnicity-your-field-guide-to-the-weird-world-of-tumblr-identity-politics">an Otherkin</a>. Perhaps Al Pacino will sign up to play Ronaiah Tuiasosopo in the HBO movie. Perhaps Katie Couric will turn out to have been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427162103/http://www.theonion.com/articles/i-was-one-of-several-people-duped-manti-teo-tells,31020/?ref=auto">a scarecrow all along.</a></p>
