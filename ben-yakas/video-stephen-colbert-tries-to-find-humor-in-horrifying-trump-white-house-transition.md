<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161114215049/http://gothamist.com/tags/stephencolbert">Stephen Colbert</a> took a break from poking himself with a straight pin to cover the start of the transfer of power between President Obama and Donald Trump <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161114215049/http://dcist.com/2016/11/trump_i_have_great_respect_for_obam.php">yesterday</a>. I desperately want some levity to balance out the horror-show of this week, but I&apos;m having a hard time embracing the humor of &quot;the most surprising remake of <em>Guess Who&apos;s Coming To Dinner</em>.&quot; This is all still happening, and despite the jokes, it&apos;s clear that Colbert has been hit as hard as the rest of us, and isn&apos;t just going to settle for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161114215049/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45ZmC-dhjGo">cutesy hashtag games.</a></p>

<p>To comprehend the darkness, you must stare it in the face: &quot;The first African American president sitting down with a president-elect who is endorsed by the Klan?&quot; Colbert said. &quot;A guy who spent five years, created his political career demanding Obama prove where he was born, then denying he did it.&quot;</p>

<p>Colbert and Patton Oswalt also made a commercial for a new product to help you swallow the bitter results of this election.</p>

<p>On <em>The Daily Show</em>, Trevor Noah was also grappling with how fast things are moving: &quot;God damn. That is so hard to watch. I know it has to happen, but does it have to happen so quickly? It&apos;s like if your dad dies and your mom starts dating at the funeral.&quot;</p>

<p>And over at <em>Late Night with Seth Meyers</em>, one of their writers, Amber Ruffin, has a message for white people: join the fun. &quot;They can spend their time trying to pass laws to take away your rights and silence your voice,&quot; she said, &quot;but all you have to do is live your lives right in their faces, and it proves that we simply cannot be stopped.&quot;</p>
