<p>Despite the fact that he&apos;s been called the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141029042323/http://www.up.edu/portlandmag/2006_spring/boss/boss1.html">&quot;Greatest Catholic poet of our time,&quot;</a> there are a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141029042323/http://www.jewornotjew.com/profile.jsp?ID=283">surprising amount</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141029042323/http://tzvee.blogspot.com/2009/01/is-bruce-springsteen-jewish.html">of websites</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141029042323/http://jewishornot.blogspot.com/2012/04/is-bruce-springsteen-jewish.html">dedicated</a> to answering the question of whether or not <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141029042323/http://gothamist.com/tags/brucespringsteen"><strike>Bruce</strike> BROOOOOCE Springsteen</a> is Jewish. Despite being the patron saint of Jersey Jews, sadly, he is not&#x2014;but that shouldn&apos;t stop the NY Times from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141029042323/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/07/booming/food-for-hungry-fans-of-the-boss.html">subtly changing his name</a> from Springsteen to Springstein and letting the chips fall where they may. Maybe they were confusing him with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141029042323/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUQZYLUpOKw">E Street drummer Max Weinberg</a>?</p>

<p>Funny enough, that wasn&apos;t the only Springsteen-related correction in the Times this week. Considering they spell his name &quot;Springsteeen,&quot; are they allowed to issue a correction to the correction?</p>

<p>In case you missed it, Springsteen and the E Street Band played &quot;Land Of Hope And Dreams&quot; at the Hurricane Sandy benefit concert on NBC last Friday. Watch it below.</p>
