<p>&quot;We spent so many hours together, we would divulge the most intimate details of our personal lives, like twins in a womb.&quot; That&apos;s how Jerry Seinfeld <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425173036/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF-QKIa4EXo">has described</a> his professional and personal relationship with Larry David while they were making <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425173036/http://gothamist.com/tags/seinfeld"><em>Seinfeld</em></a>. Which is why we felt so heartened when Redditor JoeToronto10 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425173036/http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/22uaq9/perhaps_the_greatest_seinfeld_moment_ever/">offered the above photo</a> as proof that the more things change, the more they stay the same: &quot;Friend (who took the pic) sent this to me awhile back,&quot; he wrote. &quot;It was in a NYC restaurant where Larry and Jerry were eating. Still so crazy how perfectly set up it is.&quot; Is Larry the devil and Jerry the angel, or the other way around?</p>

<p>The restaurant in question is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425173036/http://www.bubbys.com/our-restaurants/tribeca/">Bubby&apos;s in Tribeca</a>, where Larry has been spotted several times in the past (An intriguing aside: did you know there&apos;s a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425173036/http://www.bubbygram.com/larrydavidabny.htm">Larry David impersonator named Bubby Gram</a>?). We know Larry and Jerry have stayed in touch in the years since <em>Seinfeld</em>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425173036/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2U8mPjO4I38">with regular guest appearances</a> on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425173036/http://comediansincarsgettingcoffee.com/larry-david-larry-eats-a-pancake">each other&apos;s shows</a>, but there was no filming going on this day. </p>

<p>So this is exactly how we want to picture Jerry and Larry in real life: shooting the shit about intentional mumbling and pretzel etiquette or whatnot in some random NYC joint. Let&apos;s just hope Larry didn&apos;t have an incident after this photo was taken.</p>
