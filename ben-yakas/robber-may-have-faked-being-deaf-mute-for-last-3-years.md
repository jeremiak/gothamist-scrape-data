And with 64 adjournments under his belt, Wendy Gabriel&apos;s plan seems to be working. <strong>&quot;There is no dysfunction. He&apos;s not speaking because he doesn&apos;t want to,</strong>&quot; psychologist Barry Winkler <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424161328/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2011/04/28/2011-04-28_listen_up_rob_suspect_not_deaf_mute__shrink.html">told the News</a>. </p>

<p>Gabriel was charged with robbery, assault and grand larceny after his pit bull attacked a man he was allegedly robbing in June 2007. But since his arrest in 2008, Gabriel hasn&apos;t uttered a word in front of anyone&#x2014;he has communicated with judges and prosecutors through handwritten notes. He is attempting to put one over on this court and this system. It has to stop,&quot; said prosecutor Stephanie Catros. </p>

<p>Gabriel requested that he be self-represented, but Judge Judith Lieb rejected it, ruling that the real-time court reporter and other accommodations he would need are too cumbersome. She did try to tempt/trick him into a game of Simon Says: &quot;If you begin to speak, I will reconsider my decision.&quot;</p>

<p>Douglas Kahan, Gabriel&apos;s court-appointed legal adviser, says he has demonstrated a working knowledge of the law, and is disciplined, and thoroughly committed to his act, if nothing else: <strong>&quot;He appears to know what he&apos;s doing. But he has a huge distrust of lawyers and the system. He&apos;s never been caught red-handed hearing or speaking.&quot;</strong> Below, you can see a clip of Gabriel enjoying some gum:</p>
