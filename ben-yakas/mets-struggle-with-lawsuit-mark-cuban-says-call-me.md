<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:230px; "> <img alt="2311mets.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110706133229im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/2311mets.jpg" width="230" height="250"> <br> <i>Will Mr. Met every smile again?</i></div> <p></p>

<p>Settlement negotiations between the owners of the Mets and the trustee who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110706133229/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/28/wilpons_looking_to_sell_part_of_met.php">is suing</a> them, alleging that their company was a &#x201C;net winner&#x201D; in Bernard Madoff&#x2019;s Ponzi scheme, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110706133229/http://www.nypost.com/p/sports/mets/settlement_talks_break_down_between_bt0dE3ia9g111lRXNe2SAP">ended acrimoniously today</a>. It seems the talks broke down because the Wilpons were upset over details of the lawsuit leaking to the press, which resulted in a pretty lousy week for the Wilpons and the Mets organization. &quot;<strong>Defendants cannot cry confidentiality to this court while publicly attacking the complaint and continuing to frustrate the public&apos;s right to know the contents of the same complaint they disparage</strong>,&quot; said the trustee&apos;s lawyer, David Sheehan. </p>

<p>Because of the suit, the Wilpons are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110706133229/http://gothamist.com/2011/02/02/wilpons_dealing_with_madoff_mets_fa.php">looking to sell</a> around 25 percent of the team. They&apos;ve already had two potential buyers voice preliminary interest in aiding the team, liquor distributor and Georgi Vodka owner/provocateur <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110706133229/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/29/georgi_vodka_owner_wants_a_piece_of.php">Martin Silver</a>, and a group of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110706133229/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/30/martin_luther_king_iii_and_investor.php">investors</a> that includes Martin Luther King III, but neither party seems prepared to purchase a non-majority share. But maybe what the Mets really need is a loudmouth billionaire owner: Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban, whose net worth is $2.3 billion according to Forbes. He <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110706133229/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2011/02/03/mark-cuban-ill-answer-the-phone-if-mets-call/">told reporters</a> at the Knicks/Mavs game last night, &#x201C;If they want to sit down and sell me on it, I can be a willing buyer and a willing customer. But I&#x2019;m not going to be a bidder on anything.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Cuban had previously tried and failed to buy the Texas Rangers and Chicago Cubs, the experience of which has left a bitter taste in his mouth, but one which cannot be sated until he drinks the sweet nectar that is a major league baseball franchise. He said: &quot;If someone sees me as a potential owner, I&#x2019;ll take their call and discuss a deal. I&#x2019;m not going to get into a bidding situation ever again&#x2026;Obviously, I feel like I&#x2019;d be a good team owner in baseball, but I&#x2019;m not going to go through the same process I did with the Rangers and the Cubs...Like I said, I&#x2019;m not going to be making any phone calls, but I&#x2019;ll answer the phone.&#x201D;</p>
