<p>Cartoonish fictional characters such as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501173426/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/03/photo_darth_vader_takes_the_subway.php">Darth Vader</a>, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501173426/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/23/photo_ghostbuster_spotted_on_subway.php">Ghostbusters</a>, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501173426/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/23/photo_anthony_weiner_takes_subway_t.php">Anthony Weiner</a> have been known to take the subway&#x2014;so it was only a matter of time before the Invisible Man did so as well. This disturbing-looking person was spotted on the N train this week by a reader of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501173426/http://goingwitheddie.com/">Eddie Going.</a> It&apos;s a little creepy&#x2014;and unfortunate that this straphanger didn&apos;t take Robert Downey Jr.&apos;s advice more seriously: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501173426/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAKG-kbKeIo">&quot;Never go full Unitard.&quot;</a></p>

<p>Nevertheless, this isn&apos;t even close to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501173426/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/28/memorable_photo_sleepy_man_hangs_br.php">most</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501173426/http://gothamist.com/2012/08/23/is_this_the_most_horrifying_subway.php">disturbing</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501173426/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/08/photo_what_compels_a_human_being_to.php">thing</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501173426/http://gothamist.com/2012/11/30/two_young_ladies_filmed_giving_thei.php">we&apos;ve seen</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501173426/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/15/video_man_licks_shoe_on_subway.php">on the subway.</a> </p>
