<p>This week, a NJ teen <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408105310/http://gothamist.com/2014/03/20/teen_on_wire.php">was able to successfully sneak</a> all the way to the spire of the 1 WTC tower, aided in part by an easygoing elevator operator, a sleepy security guard, and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408105310/http://gothamist.com/2014/03/21/teens_are_amazing.php">ridiculous utter lack of security cameras</a> at the site. Jose Casquejo, 16, has now apologized for his stunt on Twitter, writing, &quot;I seriously apologize to anyone who may have been insulted or felt disrespected by my actions. It was not my intention to do so.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I walked around the construction site and figured out how to access the Freedom Tower rooftop,&quot; Casquejo, who has been charged with misdemeanor criminal trespass, told cops according to the criminal complaint. &quot;I found a way up through the scaffolding, climbed onto the 6th floor, and took the elevator up to the 88th floor. I then took the staircase up to 104th floor. I went to the rooftop and climbed the ladder all the way to the antenna.&quot;</p>

<p>NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408105310/http://nypost.com/2014/03/21/teen-apologizes-for-daredevil-wtc-climb/">was embarrassed and &quot;disappointed&quot;</a> by the incident: &quot;We&#x2019;ll work very closely with the Port Authority to determine exactly what happened,&quot; he told reporters Friday, even though Casquejo explained exactly what happened above. &quot;The penetration of the site is [the Port Authority&#x2019;s] responsibility, as well as the owner of the building and the security service he employed.&#x2019;&quot; Mayor de Blasio added, &quot;Obviously it&#x2019;s shocking and troubling, and I don&#x2019;t know how it possibly could have happened.&quot;</p>

<p>Good thing for Bratton and de Blasio that Casquejo isn&apos;t going anywhere, and probably can fit in some consultancy time in between seventh and eighth period classes. Instead of prosecuting Casquejo, Homeland Security (or the Port Authority, or the city) should hire him and his friends (the ones who helped planned the break-in) to evaluate the safety at various high-security, high-value targets. It would certainly make for a great McG movie in 20 years too.</p>

<p>&quot;They spent tens of millions of dollars in the security protocol for that site and obviously, it failed miserably, where a 16-year-old can simply go through a hole in the construction fence and make it up to the top of the tower,&quot; Manny Gomez of MG Security Services, and formerly of the NYPD and the FBI, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408105310/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2014/03/21/teen-who-allegedly-managed-to-sneak-to-top-of-1-wtc-apologizes-on-twitter/">told CBS. </a></p>
