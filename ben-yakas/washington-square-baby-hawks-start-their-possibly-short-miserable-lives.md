<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:300px; "> <img alt="5611hawks.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110508064919im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/byakas/5611hawks.jpg" width="300" height="229"> <br> <i>Margo Johnston</i></div> So: sometime in late March (around March 24), some folks <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110508064919/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/29/hawk-cam-updates-from-the-nest/#more-302033">noticed that</a> a red-tailed hawk had been tending three eggs, white with brown speckles, in a nest on the 12th-floor ledge outside the office of the president of NYU by Washington Square Park. So naturally, the Times went and set up a webcam of the action. Violet and her partner Bobby took turns watching over the eggs, which would take 32-36 days to hatch&#x2014;suffice it to say, City Room was enthralled with the saga. On Tuesday, they wrote that it was too late for the little critters: &quot;barring some kind of record-setting miracle, there will be no fuzzy ones in the nest this year.&quot; But they were wrong!<p></p>

<p>After that rollercoaster ride, at 8:30 a.m. this morning, one of the baby hawks was born! The NY Times got their Mother&apos;s Day Weekend miracle! According to hawk expert John Blakeman, it&apos;ll still take another 24 to 36 hours for the other two to hatch; then it will take four or five weeks before they start testing their wings. Of course, all of this is most likely moot, since there&apos;s a good chance they&apos;re going to die anyway, even if they aren&apos;t fed a piece of poison rat meat. According <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110508064919/http://urbanhawks.blogs.com/urban_hawks/2011/04/washington-square-prognosis.html">to Urban Hawks</a>: &quot;In general, 70% of all birds die in their first year of life.  It&apos;s a hard fact of nature.  Birds have a high mortality rate.&quot; Between the dogs, the rats, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110508064919/http://gothamist.com/2010/12/03/hawk_1.php">the poisons</a>, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110508064919/http://gothamist.com/2010/11/18/video_nyu_kids_freak_out_over_four.php">the NYU kids</a>, the future doesn&apos;t seem to bode well for them.</p>

<p>You can watch the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110508064919/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/29/hawk-cam-updates-from-the-nest/#more-302033">hawk cam here</a>. Today the Times wrote in what must be a first for them: &quot;Never have we been so ecstatic to be wrong.&quot; So enjoy the ecstasy hawk-lovers, because they may not be long for this world.</p>
