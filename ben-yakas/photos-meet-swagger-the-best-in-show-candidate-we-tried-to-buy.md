Going into the 137th <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430052638/http://gothamist.com/tags/westminsterdogshow">Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show</a> on Monday, we promised ourselves we would uphold the highest of journalistic standards, even at a dog show. But all that went out the window once we met Swagger, the old English sheepdog you see illuminating the photo above like a shaggy white sun. He&apos;s a surprise contender for Best-In-Show after he won best in group for herding dogs last night at MSG. And when his owner (jokingly) offered to sell him to us for $250, we&apos;d be lying if we said we didn&apos;t strongly consider it.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, as soon as photographer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430052638/http://colormekatie.blogspot.com/">Katie Sokoler</a> mentioned she lived in Brooklyn, he immediately took his offer off the table: &quot;Oh no, Swagger can&apos;t live in Brooklyn, no way.&quot; Swagger, who lives in Colorado most of the year, is an 18-month-old, 90-pound mass of white-and-grey fur whose eyes can barely be seen. He almost wasn&apos;t admitted into this year&apos;s competition&#x2014;Westminster expanded its rules this year to allow so-called &quot;class dogs,&quot; which are dogs that have not won enough shows under American Kennel Club rules to be considered &quot;champions,&quot; and Swagger was allowed in last minute.</p>

<p>And honestly, as much as we were taken with his giant paws and goofy face, we didn&apos;t think he&apos;d have much of a chance going up against the likes of a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430052638/http://animal.discovery.com/tv-shows/dogs-101/videos/puli.htm">Puli</a>, a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430052638/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CAM1ZXXOes">Beauceron</a> and a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430052638/http://animal.discovery.com/breed-selector/dog-breeds/herding/canaan-dog.html">Canaan Dog</a>. But Swagger charmed the judges and crowd (he got the loudest applause when he ran around the stadium) during the competition. </p>

<p>In their media packets, Westminster offers journalists tips on &quot;storylines&quot; to follow during the show&#x2014;the sort of stuff that can really make the event seem like a macro version of its most famous cinematic depiction, <em>Best In Show</em>. Swagger was unsurprisingly nowhere to be found on that list&#x2014;but now that he&apos;s broken through to our cold, pasty heart, he&apos;s the only storyline we need. Suffice to say, we&apos;ll be cheering for him tonight.</p>
