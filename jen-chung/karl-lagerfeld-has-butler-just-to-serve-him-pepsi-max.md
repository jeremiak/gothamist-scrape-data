<p>Karl Lagerfeld loves his kitten Choupette so much that he lets <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610170125/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/06/catsht_crazy_karl_lagerfelds_ipad-u.php">her eat on the table, helps her keep a diary and gives her two maids</a>. And the Chanel fashion designer loves Pepsi Max so much that, as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120610170125/http://www.nypost.com/p/pagesix/kaiser_karl_soda_slave_vb6c8UYsayTVX2v2JdZVXI">Page Six says</a> &quot;he also requires a butler to follow him around at parties with a goblet of Pepsi Max on a silver tray.&quot;</p>

<p>Page Six has humorous puns, reporting that at his party for his Little Black Jacket book (about Chanel&apos;s iconic jacket), &quot;the ponytailed potentate was tailed by a staffer from catering company Olivier Cheng, whose sole task was holding a silver tray with one full glass of Pepsi Max in case The Kaiser found himself dehydrated. The soda serf stood dutifully nearby a revolving ring of photographers and admirers around Lagerfeld, including Lily Collins, in case the design divo wanted a sip &#x2014; but he never touched the stuff. &quot; </p>

<p>And rapper Theophilus London said that when he was photographed by Lagerfeld for the book, &#x201C;During the shoot [Karl] had a personal guy that holds his drink. He takes a sip, the guy walks away and comes back.&quot;</p>

<p>Here&apos;s Lagerfeld discussing other important matters... like the wedding dress he designed for Drew Barrymore:</p>
