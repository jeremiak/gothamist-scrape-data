										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2009_09_ernie.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150806184040im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2009_09_ernie.jpg" width="260" height="190" class="image-left"> </span>Move over &quot;teachable moment,&quot; &quot;death panel,&quot; &quot;You lie! and &quot;Imma let you finish&quot;&#x2014;it&apos;s possible that My Fox NY anchor Ernie Anastos&apos; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150806184040/http://gothamist.com/2009/09/17/video_ernie_anastos_drops_f-bomb_ch.php">unwitting catch phrase has caught fire</a>!  Hell, it might even be the catch phrase of the century!  At first, the veteran local newsman&apos;s utterance &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150806184040/http://gothamist.com/2009/09/17/video_ernie_anastos_drops_f-bomb_ch.php">Keep fucking that chicken!</a>&quot; was limited to the local airwaves, but thank God for the Internet.  (And screw the &quot;maybe he meant &apos;keep plucking that chicken&apos;&quot; because that&apos;s just not fun.)  Now it&apos;s gone national (cable)&#x2014;on last night&apos;s Daily Show, Jon Stewart led off with a couple minutes dedicated to it:</p>

<p>My Fox NY/Channel 5 vice president Lew Leone issued a statement, &quot;We are disappointed with Ernie&apos;s comment on the air Thursday night,&quot; and later on, Anastos said on air, &quot;<strong>I misspoke during Thursday night&apos;s newscast. I apologize for my remarks to anyone who may have been offended.</strong>&quot;  A staffer t<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150806184040/http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv/2009/09/17/2009-09-17_ernie_anastos_.html">old the Daily News</a>, &quot;Everybody likes Ernie, and knows he would never say that on the air. Nobody has a bad word to say about Ernie. He&apos;s revered at the station.&quot;</p>

<p>After the jump: Remember South Park&apos;s take on loving chickens?</p>
