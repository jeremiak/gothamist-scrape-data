Al Sharpton at last week&apos;s summit <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510014927/http://gothamist.com/2014/08/01/sharpton_brings_up_dante_de_blasio.php">about NYPD and community relations</a> (Getty Images)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>Last week, Mayor de Blasio convened a round table with NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton and various community leaders to discuss police-community relations in the wake of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510014927/http://gothamist.com/2014/07/18/asthmatic_staten_island_man_dies_wh.php">Eric Garner&apos;s death during an arres</a>t. Of course, the Rev. Al Sharpton essentially stole any possible thunder from de Blasio <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510014927/http://gothamist.com/2014/08/01/sharpton_brings_up_dante_de_blasio.php">by remarking</a>, &quot;If Dante wasn&#x2019;t your son, he&#x2019;d been candidate for a chokehold&quot; and &quot;If we are going to just play spin games, I&#x2019;ll be the worst enemy because I am tired of seeing people bury their kin.&quot; Now it seems the mayor is a tad perturbed.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510014927/http://nypost.com/2014/08/08/de-blasio-furious-sharpton-showed-him-up-at-city-hall/">According to the Post</a>, &quot;De Blasio thought the activist preacher publicly humiliated him by spouting off from a seat of honor directly to the mayor&#x2019;s left, sources said Thursday.&quot;</p><blockquote>&#x201C;He was really pissed at what Sharpton did,&#x201D; one source said.<p></p>

<p>&#x201C;He felt [Sharpton] embarrassed him, and he regrets now that he let the press in and that he moved Sharpton up [to the dais].&#x201D;</p>

<p>Sharpton was initially supposed to be seated away from de Blasio with other community leaders, the source said.</p>

<p>Sources also said some of de Blasio&#x2019;s top aides are worried that Sharpton&#x2019;s stunt damaged the mayor&#x2019;s credibility as a leader as controversy continues to mount over Garner&#x2019;s July 17 caught-on-video arrest. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s obvious it was a mistake. It makes him look weak,&#x201D; a source said.</p></blockquote>Pretty smart for &quot;sources&quot; to play up this angle, especially after the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510014927/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/07/nyregion/after-eric-garners-death-de-blasio-seeks-a-tricky-balance.html?src=me">NY Times&apos; story reporting</a> how Sharpton didn&apos;t know he&apos;d be sitting near Bratton during the public meeting, &quot;With the public watching, Mr. Sharpton said he felt compelled to deliver his full-throated critique of the Police Department.&quot; (The Times also said de Blasio&apos;s &quot;vision&quot; to re-shape police-community relations &quot;remains vague.&quot;)<p></p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510014927/http://nypost.com/2014/08/08/al-sharpton-just-isnt-my-type/">Post&apos;s Andrea Peyser chatted</a> with Sharpton and claims that he really wants to be her friend. However, she writes, &quot;I&#x2019;ll never agree with Sharpton, not even on the weather.&quot;</p>
