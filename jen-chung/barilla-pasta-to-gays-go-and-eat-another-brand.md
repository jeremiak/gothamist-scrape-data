<p>Is it time to stick a fork in Barilla? Its chairman, Guido Barilla, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406152235/http://sfist.com/2013/09/26/barilla_pasta_boycott_called_for_af.php">said on Italian radio</a>, &quot;We won&#x2019;t include gays in our ads, because we like the traditional family. If gays don&#x2019;t like it, they can always eat another brand of pasta. Everyone is free to do what they want, provided it doesn&#x2019;t bother anyone else.&quot;</p>

<p>Barilla also said, &quot;I have no respect for adoption by gay families because this concerns a person who is not able to choose,&quot; insisting that women <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406152235/http://sfist.com/2013/09/26/barilla_pasta_boycott_called_for_af.php">play a &quot;central role&quot; in the family</a>.</p>

<p>Matthew Breen, editor in chief of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406152235/http://www.advocate.com/">The Advocate</a>, said, &quot;Guido Barilla&#x2019;s remarks are not only an insult to LGBT consumers, but they&#x2019;re bad business. The backlash, and calls for boycotts of the company&#x2019;s products by LGBT rights groups and even Italian politicians, is only to be expected. Barilla was blatant in his view that gay and lesbian couples, and their children, cannot constitute a family worth depicting in advertising, and that same-sex couples are unsuitable as parents.</p>

<p>&quot;His rejection of adoption by gay parents as suitable families contravenes the research that shows that children of gay and lesbians couples make great parents who raise healthy, well-adjusted children,&quot; Breen continued. &quot;And his ignorance of the gay and lesbian market sector is simply bad business.&quot; </p>

<p>The LGBT market is about $790 billion in the U.S. this year; the Advocate notes Barilla&apos;s 2010 revenue was $3.9 billion.</p>

<p>Barilla subsequently <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406152235/http://chicagoist.com/2013/09/26/barilla_pasta_chairman_tells_gays_t.php">issued a classic non-apology apology</a>, &quot;I&#x2019;m sorry if my comments on La Zanzara have created misunderstanding or polemic, or if I&#x2019;ve offended anyone. In the interview I only wanted to underline the central role of the woman in the family.&quot; </p>
