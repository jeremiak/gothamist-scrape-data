                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none" style=" width:640px; "> <img alt="2011_05_osamasign2.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20131216011855im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2011_05_osamasign2.jpg" width="640" height="478"> <br> <i>From reader E.N.</i></div> <p></p>

<p>The sign hanging outside a Red Hook home and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131216011855/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/02/brooklyn_acknowledges_bin_ladens_de.php">demanding, &quot;Where Is Osama Bin Laden?&quot;</a>&#x2014;complete with a counter of how many years and days had passed since 9/11&#x2014; was taken down yesterday.  Cheryl Stewart <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131216011855/http://brooklynpaper.com/stories/34/18/all_binladenlady_2011_5_6_bk.html">told the Brooklyn Paper</a>, &quot;<strong>I&#x2019;m elated. To me, this is a criminal justice issue. This man is a mass murderer, and I am always happy when someone flouting the law has been brought to justice.</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>Stewart, a sculptor, was upset that Bin Laden was off &quot;laughing his ass off&quot; while U.S. resources were focused on Iraq so she created the sign, &quot;I felt very helpless, so the only thing I thought to do was ask this very important question than no one else was asking. And I asked it every single day.&quot;  </p>

<p>The Brooklyn Paper also notes, &quot;Stewart is a self-described rabble-rouser &#x2014; and also one tough cookie. A car on Van Brunt Street slammed into her on April 11 while she was riding her motorcycle, shattering 18 bones. She finally returned home this week.&quot;</p>
