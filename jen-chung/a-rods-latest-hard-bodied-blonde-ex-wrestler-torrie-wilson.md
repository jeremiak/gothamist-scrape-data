<p>A local Boise TV anchor, Mike Murad, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529165448/http://www.nydailynews.com/gossip/a-rod-sleeper-hold-playboy-centerfold-torrie-wilson-article-1.998627?localLinksEnabled=false">told the Daily News</a> he saw A-Rod working out with Wilson at a gym in Boise.  When Murad asked if he could take a picture, A-Rod said no, &quot;I&#x2019;m trying to keep a low profile.&quot;  Murad <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529165448/https://twitter.com/#!/2NewsMike/status/152098921450176512">still took one though</a>! (Murad also Tweeted today, &quot;Wow! I was interviewed by the New York Daily News last night. Apparently some people are interested in this story&quot;). </p>

<p>Wilson was in the WWE between 2001 and 2008.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160529165448/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torrie_Wilson">According to Wikipedia</a>, &quot;Wilson&apos;s most high profile storyline during her first few years with the company was in 2002/3 when she feuded with Dawn Marie. In the angle, Dawn Marie attempted to marry Wilson&apos;s real-life father Al Wilson. Dawn also revealed that she had developed feelings for Torrie, and the two shared an on-screen kiss. Dawn even offered to cancel the wedding if Torrie would go to a hotel with her for the night. Despite this, as part of the storyline, Dawn developed feelings for Al and the two got married on an episode of SmackDown! in their underwear.&quot; And yes, YouTube does have Torrie and Dawn Marie&apos;s kiss:</p>

<p>Wilson recently Tweeted, &quot;Merry christmas eve! Jesus is the bomb-diggity!!! So happy to be with family &amp; friends ;)&quot;</p>
