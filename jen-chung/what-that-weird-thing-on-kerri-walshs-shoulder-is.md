<p>One of the smaller mysteries of the Olympics has been solved!  The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120119082006/http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/2008olympics/2008/08/15/2008-08-15_news_uncovers_beach_volleyball_ace_kerri.html">Daily News confirms</a> that the black tape-like stuff on U.S. beach volleyball player Kerri Walsh is in fact <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120119082006/http://kinesiotaping.com/">Kinesio tape</a>, a &quot;brand of therapeutic sports tape from an Albuquerque-based company that claims to assist and support muscles without inhibiting the joint&apos;s range of motion.&quot;  (Walsh had shoulder surgery last year.)</p>

<p>Of course, if you&apos;re an avid beach volleyball viewer, you probably have known since last weekend--<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120119082006/http://www.forbes.com/lifestyle/2008/08/15/kinesio-lifestyle-walsh-forbeslife-cx_avd_0815sport.html">Forbes reports</a> that Kinesio sales are up over 600%.  Hilariously, the News asked some people on the street what they thought it was, and responses included a &quot;tattoo,&quot; a &quot;blob,&quot; and --from a man named Richard--something &quot;probably covering a heart that says, &apos;I love Richard.&apos;&quot;</p>

<p>Walsh and teammate Misty May-Treanor are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120119082006/http://www.nbcolympics.com/beachvolleyball/resultsandschedules/day=9/index.html">facing off against Brazil</a> tonight at 10 p.m.  Oh, and for that other minor mystery, Michael Phelps&apos;s iPod probably <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120119082006/http://blogs.zdnet.com/Apple/?p=2142">has a lot of rap and hip-hop</a> on it (via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120119082006/http://kottke.org/08/08/michael-phelps-ipod">Kottke</a>).  </p>
