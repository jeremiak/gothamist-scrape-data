<p>Mayor Bloomberg and Schools Chancellor Joel Klein <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111117121959/http://nyc.gov:80/portal/site/nycgov/menuitem.c0935b9a57bb4ef3daf2f1c701c789a0/index.jsp?pageID=mayor_press_release&amp;catID=1194&amp;doc_name=http%3A%2F%2Fnyc.gov%2Fhtml%2Fom%2Fhtml%2F2008b%2Fpr358-08.html&amp;cc=unused1978&amp;rc=1194&amp;ndi=1">released the 2008 progress reports</a> for elementary, middle and K-8 schools (1,043 in total).  Bloomberg happily noted that 58% of schools moved up a letter grade (or received an A for a second year in a row), &quot;I am thrilled that the majority of schools earned a higher grade by improving performance over the past year. Now we&apos;ve got to keep that progress going.&quot;</p>

<p>Some stats from the Department of Education:<br>
</p><ul><li>Last year, there were 123 As for elementary schools; this year, there are 265. Last year, there were 30 As for K-8 schools; this year, there are 34. Last year, there were 73 As for middle schools; this year, there are 95.<br>
</li><li>More than half of the schools that earned As last year earned As again this year (57 percent). Of the 226 schools that got As last year, 128 were As this year and 75 were Bs.<br>
</li><li>Seventy-one percent of schools that received Cs and Ds last year rose to become As and Bs this year.</li></ul><p></p>
