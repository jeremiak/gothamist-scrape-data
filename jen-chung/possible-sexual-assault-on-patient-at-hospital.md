The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150929011054/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2008/11/12/2008-11-12_new_yorkpresbyterian_hospital_columbia_v.html">Daily News reports</a> that a nurse allegedly saw 27-year-old Yakov Kramer &quot;standing over the elderly man&apos;s bed.&quot;  Kramer was arrested last night and a &quot;cloth Kramer allegedly used to clean up the evidence was seized by the NYPD for testing&quot; (a police source said, &quot;<strong>He didn&apos;t know the victim - it looks like he just wandered into a room and took advantage</strong>&quot;).  The News called the home of Kramer&apos;s father, and a women said, &quot;The whole story is wrong and stupid... He was in the hospital with his wife. She had an appointment. Something is very wrong if someone could be arrested at a hospital.&quot;  The hospital&apos;s spokesperson told WCBS 2, &quot;We cannot confirm any details. But we did receive the report and we are investigating.&quot; </p>
