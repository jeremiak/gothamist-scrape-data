<p>The teen <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510011334/http://gothamist.com/2014/12/02/man_attacks_woman_carrying_baby_to.php">who was apparently caught on video mugging a woman of her cellphone</a> by kicking her to the ground <em>while she was carrying a baby</em> suddenly feels bad about everything. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510011334/http://7online.com/news/suspect-charged-with-dropkick-of-woman-carrying-baby-speaks-out/417612/">Alonzo Brown said, &quot;I&apos;m sorry&quot;</a> while he was being transported by the police. </p>

<p>Police released disturbing video showing a person follow a 24-year-old woman on a Bronx sidewalk and then kick her violently to the ground before grabbing her cellphone. </p>

<p>Odila Orozco had her two-month-old son Jordy in a sling, and when WABC 7 asked Brown who he was saying sorry to, he replied, &quot;The lady and the baby, I didn&apos;t know it was the baby that was there... I didn&apos;t see the baby,&quot; only realizing that the child was there after &quot;she hit the floor.&quot;</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="2014_12_baby1.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510011334im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2014_12_baby1.jpg" width="640" height="442"> <br> <i> Orozco and baby Jordy (WABC 7)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>However, Orozco wasn&apos;t convinced. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510011334/http://nypost.com/2014/12/03/i-didnt-see-the-baby-teen-who-allegedly-mugged-mom/">She told the Post</a>, &quot;He saw I was carrying a baby. But he hit me from behind and stole my phone... He attacked me and left me on the floor, crying with my baby... I can&#x2019;t forgive someone like that .&#x2009;.&#x2009;. If he was a hardworking man who understood what it was like to work by the sweat of his brow, then I would have more sympathy for him, but he&#x2019;s a criminal. How many other women has he hurt?&quot;</p>

<p>Orozco also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510011334/http://7online.com/news/suspect-charged-with-dropkick-of-woman-carrying-baby-speaks-out/417612/">wondered to WABC 7</a> if Brown would be sorry if Jordy died. Luckily, both mother and child appear to be fine.</p>

<p>Brown, who has been arrested 11 times before, is facing charges including robbery, assault, acting in a manner injurious to a child under 17 and criminal possession of stolen property.</p>
