Apparently former mayor&#x2014;and former presidential aspirant&#x2014;Rudy Giuliani invited Alaska Governor Sarah Palin to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141001084308/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/2009/06/07/2009-06-07_palin_hits_nyc_and_yankees_game.html">catch the Yankees-Rays game</a>. It was also a double date&#x2014;the Daily News reports, &quot;The GOP political duo and their spouses exchanged laughs, smiles and small talk as they watched the Yanks take on Tampa Bay. At one point, Giuliani snapped a photo of his wife, Judith, with Alaska&apos;s First Couple.&quot; Later in the evening, Palin was honored as an advocate for developmentally disabled children; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141001084308/http://www.newsday.com/news/local/newyork/ny-sarahpalin0608,0,6581433.story">Newsday reports</a> that group&apos;s founder &quot;can&apos;t say what type of advocacy work Palin has done on behalf developmentally disabled children, he said her popularity and high-profile status makes her an effective spokeswoman for the group and that&apos;s why Palin was chosen as this year&apos;s honoree.&quot;  Palin <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141001084308/http://gothamist.com/2009/06/07/palin_nibbles_the_ny_state_burbs_all_weekend_long.php">spent the earlier part of the weekend upstate</a>.</p>
