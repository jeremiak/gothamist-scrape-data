<p>Even though an Appeals Court <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140409013812/http://gothamist.com/2014/02/20/restaurant_in_union_square_is_good.php">gave the green light for construction to start</a>, a group opposing the construction of a restaurant in the northern end of Union Square is still praying for a miracle. The Post reports, &quot;Activists visited City Hall on Friday to deliver petitions against the controversial eatery, which is being built in the park&#x2019;s pavilion after a long battle with neighbors.&quot;</p>

<p>The controversial eatery has been the subject of a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140409013812/http://gothamist.com/2005/10/18/union_square_groups_claim_restaurant_is_lunacy.php">nearly 10 years-long battle</a>; opponents insisted a private restaurant would be a &quot;flagrant misuse&quot; of public parkland, noting there are only two playgrounds in the parks but 150 restaurants, bars and markets in nearby. A judge had agreed, saying the city <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140409013812/http://gothamist.com/2008/04/23/judge_halts_cit.php">needed state approval</a> to privatize the park but then a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140409013812/http://gothamist.com/2009/03/31/union_square_pavilion_restaurant_ge.php">State Supreme Court justice overruled</a>. Plaintiffs then <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140409013812/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/18/judges_union_square_pavilion_can_be.php">lost two appeals</a> to stop the restaurant.</p>

<p>A member of the Union Square Community Coalition told the Post, &quot;If we keep waiting, there&#x2019;s going to be a restaurant there before we know it... We thought things would be different [under de Blasio]. People are feeling a little betrayed.&quot; </p>

<p>At a March 9th rally, a number of elected officials argued why the restaurant shouldn&apos;t happen. Manhattan Borough President Gale Brewer said, &quot;It&apos;s beyond ironic that the Union Square pavilion where Emma Goldman and Dorothy Day made history practicing their brand of free speech could instead become home to free-range pork. This neighborhood already has an enormous choice of restaurants-- and a shortage of park space.  To put a restaurant here, in this designated National Historic Landmark, puts a price tag on the public&#x2019;s enjoyment of what should remain a public space.&quot;</p>

<p>Rep. Carolyn Maloney agreed, offering de Blasio a way out by blaming Bloomberg: &quot;For years this community has made it plain that it would be unconscionable to turn a part of Union Square Park, which has historically been a center of activism, recreation and other park uses, into just another high-end restaurant.  It blows my mind that the previous administration would consider confiscating precious park space to develop another fancy eatery and watering hole. I strongly urge Mayor de Blasio to cancel the arrangement.&quot;<br>
 <br>
Assembly Member Richard Gottfried voiced a possible solution, &quot;The Mayor has the legal right to cancel this contract for any reason. As the concession agreement provides and the City&#x2019;s Law Department vigorously argued to the New York State Court of Appeals, the license is freely terminable &apos;at will&apos; at any time which the City has vigorously argued.&quot;</p>
