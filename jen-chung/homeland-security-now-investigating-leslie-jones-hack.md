<p>The Department of Homeland Security is now heading the investigation into the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110102727/http://gothamist.com/2016/08/24/leslie_jones_website_hacked.php">hacking of actress Leslie Jones&apos;s website</a>. A DHS spokesperson <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110102727/http://variety.com/2016/digital/news/leslie-jones-hack-fbi-nude-photos-1201844574/">told Variety</a>, &quot;ICE Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) in New York does currently have an open investigation. As a matter of agency policy, we are unable to disclose any information related to an active investigation.&quot;</p>

<p>Jones&apos;s website was hacked early Wednesday, with her driver&apos;s license and passport information posted, plus nude photos and an image of Harambe, the gorilla killed at the Cincinnati Zoo. The website was taken offline.</p>

<p>This is not the first time Jones has been targeted online: Earlier this summer, as she was promoting <em>Ghostbusters</em>, conservative Breitbart writer Milo Yiannopoulos encouraged people to direct hateful, racist Tweets at Jones. Jones announced she was leaving Twitter because of the trolls, leading Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110102727/http://www.people.com/article/leslie-jones-twitter-jack-dorsey-accounts-suspended">reach out to her</a>. Twitter <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110102727/https://www.buzzfeed.com/charliewarzel/twitter-just-permanently-suspended-conservative-writer-milo?utm_term=.qwV47aenm#.xdW5y1k84">banned Yiannopoulos</a>, and Jones returned to Twitter. </p>

<p>The FBI was initially handling the website hack, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110102727/http://www.tmz.com/2016/08/25/leslie-jones-hack-homeland-security-cyber-crime/">TMZ reports</a>, &quot;We&apos;ve learned the case has now been transferred to Homeland Security for 2 reasons&#x2014;it has the most sophisticated cyber-crime unit in the country, and Leslie has history with the Dept.  One source tells TMZ Leslie had some sort of problem with catfishing in the past, and Homeland Security investigated the case. There&apos;s some evidence a group from Japan may have been the culprit in the current case.&quot;</p>

<p>Jones has not commented about the hack. Her colleagues and friends are continuing to rally around her:</p>
