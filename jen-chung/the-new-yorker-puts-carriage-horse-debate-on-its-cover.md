title: The New Yorker Puts Carriage Horse Debate On Its Cover
---

	
										<p>In the wake of actor <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140424044555/http://gothamist.com/2014/04/15/liam_neeson_horses.php">Liam Neeson&apos;s pro-carriage horse NY Times op-ed</a>&#x2014;and the Daily News&apos; campaign to save the industry and carriage horse opponents&apos; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140424044555/http://gothamist.com/2014/04/18/the_ecarriage_replacement_for_centr.php">introduction of a horseless carriage</a>&#x2014;artist Bruce McCall has waded into the fray with this week&apos;s cover for The New Yorker. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140424044555/http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/culture/2014/04/cover-story-bruce-mccall-the-cart-before-the-horses.html#slide_ss_0=1">He tells the magazine</a>, &quot;I&#x2019;ve never been in one of those carriages&#x2014;they&#x2019;re too slow for this fast-paced life.&quot;</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2014_04_nyercover.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20140424044555im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2014_04_nyercover.jpg" width="640" height="874" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>McCall lives near Central Park and says of his work, &quot;The Cart Before The Horses,&quot; &quot;I didn&#x2019;t take a great political stance about it. I just thought it was funny to see the horses pulled by the driver.&quot; But he added, &quot;I&#x2019;m on the side of the defenseless animals, but the other point about horses for me is that they clog traffic. I drive a lot in New York, and getting behind one of those carriages is a roadblock. They commandeer the road; they&#x2019;re turning onto Seventh Avenue or Eighth Avenue to go to or from the stables, and all traffic has to stop for them. They always take precedence, and that seems weird. A nineteenth-century traffic jam in this day and age seems silly.&quot;</p>

<p>Guess it would have been too obvious if he drew <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140424044555/http://gothamist.com/2014/04/17/hot_97_morning_show_encourages_de_b.php">Mayor de Blasio duking it out with Neeson</a>.</p>
