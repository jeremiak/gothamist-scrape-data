<p>Last year, the Brooklyn Bridge Park Corporation <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130806235444/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/25/renderings_of_proposed_brooklyn_bri.php#photo-10">shared proposals of the hotel and residential development</a> planned for Pier 1.  Now, it&apos;s believed that two of the seven initial teams will be picked.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130806235444/http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20120614/REAL_ESTATE/120619938">According to Crain&apos;s</a>, sources say that Toll Brothers and Starwood Capital Group get the go-ahead.  Both were on the shortlist of finalists (the third was The Dermot Company). The Times reports that Toll Brothers and Starwood &quot;combined elements of their plans late in the process,&quot; and there will be a &quot;200-room hotel and 160 condominium units. In addition, there will be 32,000 square feet of restaurant and banquet space, as well as a 6,000-square-foot spa. Three more apartment buildings, one at John Street and two next to Pier 6, are also planned for the park.&quot; All the buildings will have to comply with the height restrictions: &quot;The hotel building and a connecting residential building cannot exceed 100 feet in height, and a separate residential building cannot be more than 55 feet tall.&quot;</p>

<p>Still, the Brooklyn Bridge Park Corporation is reportedly still in talks with all three teams.  The announcement is supposed to be made on Tuesday.</p>
