<span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2012_04_wawlogo2.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160413093350im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2012_04_wawlogo2.jpg" width="200" height="205" class="image-left"> </span>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160413093350/http://www.wcs.org/">Bronx Zoo</a> recently welcomed three new additions and shared an adorable photograph of the black-necked swans cygnets.  Interesting fact: When they are small, they ride on the backs of their parents for &quot;warmth, transportation, and protection from predators.&quot;<p></p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160413093350/http://wcs.org/">Wildlife Conservation Society</a> explains, &quot;Carrying cygnets is most pronounced in black-necked and mute swans, but all true swans are known to do this behavior. Swans have several adaptations that accommodate their omnivorous diet, including a long neck and serrated bill which allow it to forage on submerged vegetation... One characteristic of black-necked swans is that they are the most aquatic of any swan and are often found in marine areas. Their legs are located farther back on the swan&#x2019;s body to accommodate this more aquatic existence, and hence, make them very ungainly on land.&quot;</p>

<p>They are native to South America, and the black-necked swans are one of four species at the Bronx Zoo&#x2014;there&apos;s also trumpeter swans, whooper swans, and coscoroba swans.  You can see water fowl at the Zoo&apos;s Heart Lake, on the western side of the zoo between the Southern Blvd. entrance and the Birds of Prey exhibit.</p>
