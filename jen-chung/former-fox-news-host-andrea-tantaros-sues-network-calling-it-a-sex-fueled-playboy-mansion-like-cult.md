Among the incendiary claims: Former Massachusetts Senator Scott Brown came on to her and put his hands on her waist, and her complaints to Bill Shine, who is now leading Fox News, went ignored.<p></p>

<p>Tantaros claims <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110090824/http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/08/andrea-tantaros-made-harassment-claims-against-roger-ailes.html">she was taken off the network</a> after she complained about Ailes and others, which is reminiscent of how Carlson says was shuffled off-air after she spoke out to Fox News brass. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110090824/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/23/business/media/andrea-tantaros-of-fox-news-claims-retaliation-for-harassment-complaints.html?_r=0">The NY Times reports</a>, &quot;The suit by Ms. Tantaros, filed in New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan, is the latest round in a contentious volley that began in late winter, when Fox claimed she had breached her employment contract by writing a book without receiving network approval.&quot; However, Tantaros says that the contract dispute is Fox News&apos; way of covering up her sexual harassment complaints about Ailes and Fox News star Bill O&apos;Reilly. </p>

<p>The lawsuit, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110090824/https://www.scribd.com/document/321971941/Tantaros-Complaint">which you can read here</a>, says, &quot;Fox News masquerades as a defender of traditional family values, but behind the scenes, it operates like a sex-fueled, Playboy Mansion-like cult, steeped in intimidation, indecency and misogyny,&quot; and says of the environment of intimidation, &quot;Ailes did not act alone. He may have been the primary culprit, but his actions were condoned by his most senior lieutenants, who engaged in a concerted effort to silence Tantaros by threats, humiliation, and retaliation.&quot;</p>

<p>Tantaros believed that Ailes used feared Fox News publicist Irena Briganti to smear her by setting up hostile interviews. When she talk to Shine about her concerns, the lawsuit states, &quot;Shine&#x2019;s response was shocking: He told Tantaros that Briganti &apos;is like a rabid dog on a chain that we can&#x2019;t control. Sometimes that dog gets off the chain.&apos; He then pointed to a magazine cover which had a picture of Ailes on the cover, and said: &apos;You see him? He&#x2019;s a very powerful man. This powerful man has faith in Irena Briganti.&apos; He then told Tantaros that she should not &apos;fight this&apos; and that she &apos;needed to let this one go.&apos;&quot;</p>

<p>New York Magazine&apos;s Gabriel Sherman, who wrote a book about Roger Ailes, had some thoughts about Shine&apos;s promotion:</p>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Two sources say timing of Shine and Abernethy promotions was partly because Rupert is going on vacation next week and needs execs to run Fox</p>&#x2014; Gabriel Sherman (@gabrielsherman) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110090824/https://twitter.com/gabrielsherman/status/764465688480219136">August 13, 2016</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//web.archive.org/web/20161110090824js_/http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></center>

<p>Once, Tantaro says, when she was walking down the hall at Fox News and said to hello to Ailes, he replied, &quot;We need to get you a tighter dress.&quot;</p>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">How Ailes talks about Fox News staff, according to one meeting described in Tantaros suit&#x201D; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110090824/https://t.co/xnfEpwT2Cj">https://t.co/xnfEpwT2Cj</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110090824/https://t.co/zO60Mq0RVQ">pic.twitter.com/zO60Mq0RVQ</a></p>&#x2014; Michael Calderone (@mlcalderone) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110090824/https://twitter.com/mlcalderone/status/768094342045167616">August 23, 2016</a></blockquote>

<p>Ailes also allegedly told her, &quot;I bet you look good in a bikini.&quot;</p>

<p>And then there&apos;s the accusation about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110090824/http://www.thesmokinggun.com/documents/oreilly/bill-oreilly-falafel-lawsuit-turns-ten-897562">alleged pervert Bill O&apos;Reilly</a>:</p><blockquote>[C]ommencing in February 2016, Bill O&#x2019;Reilly (&#x201C;O&#x2019;Reilly&#x201D;), whom Tantaros had considered to be a good friend and a person from whom she sought career guidance, started sexually harassing her by, inter alia, (a) asking her to come to stay with him on Long Island where it would be &#x201C;very private,&#x201D; and (b) telling her on more than one occasion that he could &#x201C;see [her] as a wild girl,&#x201D; and that he believed that she had a &#x201C;wild side.&#x201D; Fox News did take one action: plainly because of O&#x2019;Reilly&#x2019;s rumored prior sexual harassment issues and in recognition of Tantaros&#x2019;s complaints, [Fox News in-house lawyer Diane] Brandi informed [Tantaro&apos;s lawyer] that Tantaros would no longer be appearing on O&#x2019;Reilly&#x2019;s Fox News show.</blockquote>Her lawsuit explains that since it appears Fox News leaked details about her arbitration suit to the media, she&apos;s allowed to go forward with this legal action. &quot;The arbitration provision in Tantaros&#x2019;s employment agreement with Fox News ishighly unusual in that it specifically provides that publicly revealing anything about the existence or course of an arbitration is a material breach of the arbitration provision itself. As such, Fox News&#x2019;s leak of information about the arbitration to Mr. Grove was a material breach of the arbitration provision, and therefore permits Tantaros to proceed in this Court as opposed to in an arbitration.&quot;<p></p>

<p>Ailes is currently jobless, though probably <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110090824/http://gothamist.com/2016/08/16/thelma_and_louise_style.php">working on that Trump cable network</a>. </p>
