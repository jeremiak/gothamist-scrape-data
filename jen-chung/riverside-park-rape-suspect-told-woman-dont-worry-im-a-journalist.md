A woman who briefly went out with Hugues Akassy but found his behavior odd and aggressive said <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150318015610/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/metropolitan_museum_gallery_fiend_I3jO0YhwKMicUoysoGlcFJ?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">she received this text from him</a>, &quot;You are the most shallow, pathetic, retarded idiot woman I have ever met.&quot; And when he sent that text, Akassy was supposedly banging on her apartment door yelling &quot;bitch!&quot; because she wouldn&apos;t let him in her apartment.<p></p>

<p>Paula D&apos;Agostino, who works at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, said she met Akassy on the Upper West Side in 2009. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150318015610/http://www.dnainfo.com/20111024/upper-east-side/woman-says-alleged-riverside-rapist-charmed-her-stalked-her-at-museum">According to DNAinfo</a>, Akassy stopped her because she seemed familiar: &quot;She did not believe she&apos;d ever met the 43-year-old, but he asked her to get coffee after apologizing if it seemed &apos;too forward,&apos; D&apos;Agostino said. They went for coffee, discussed traveling and politics, and enjoyed each other&apos;s company, she testified.&quot;  She said, &quot;He seemed a very smart, articulate person &#x2014; one of those people you&apos;d expect to meet in New York,&quot; adding,  &quot;He told me, &apos;Don&apos;t worry, I&apos;m a journalist.&apos; We briefly discussed his work and he showed me his ID.&quot; </p>

<p>Akassy, who has recently <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150318015610/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/04/alleged_riverside_park_rapist_doesn.php">complained about being beaten in jail</a>, is accused of raping a woman (one he initially met at the Time Warner Center) while on a picnic date at Riverside Park.  His arrest prompted other women&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150318015610/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/date_with_the_rapist_ywrdGg4YUqQ6rcwiR08zVI">including a NY Post writer</a>&#x2014; to contact the Manhattan DA&apos;s office to say Akassy approached them in public places ( like the Fifth Avenue Apple Store) and then broke things off because he was very aggressive and even began to stalk them.  </p>
