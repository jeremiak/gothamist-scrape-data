The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110521105230/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2008/06/16/2008-06-16_rockland_cop_tied_to_fake_gynecologist.html">Daily News reports</a> that, according to sources, Monsey resident Zalman Silber &quot;tricked one woman into undergoing a pelvic exam by saying his friend, the Rockland County police officer, was a doctor who made house calls.&quot;  Sources also say the cop ended up conducting the exam in Silber&apos;s house--with Silber watching.</p>

<p>Prosecutors have charged Silber with third-degree sexual abuse and impersonating a doctor, after two victims from 2003 and 2004 picked him from a line-up.  A source said the victims were tricked into thinking they were participating in an insurance company survey, &quot;They knew something was wrong because you don&apos;t pinch nipples in exams like that.&quot;  Silber also allegedly had the women &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110521105230/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local&amp;id=6204690">turn on their sides for a rectal exam.</a>&quot;</p>
