<p>Ahead of NYU&apos;s presentation to Greenwich Village neighbors tonight, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502105646/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704198004575311161334409470.html?mod=WSJ_NY_MIDDLELEADNewsCollection">Wall Street Journal got a hold of renderings </a>of the 38-story tower that the school wants to build on Bleecker Street.  The building, which would include housing for faculty and a hotel for visiting faculty, is part of NYU&apos;s ambitious expansion plan, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502105646/http://www.nyu.edu/nyu2031/nyuinnyc/">NYU 2031</a>, to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502105646/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/23/nyu_expansive_dreams_to_increase_sp.php">increase its physical size by 40%</a>. But critics say it&apos;ll interfere with I.M. Pei&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502105646/http://gothamist.com/2008/11/18/silver_towers_landmarked.php">landmarked Silver Towers</a>.</p>

<p>Grimshaw Architects partner Mark Husser says, &quot;It would be built with a sensitivity to the existing buildings. It is meant to relate to the towers but also be contemporary.&quot; According to the WSJ, &quot;the new tower would use similar materials to the Pei structures and would be positioned at the site in a way not to cut off views from the existing buildings.&quot;  But Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation&apos;s Andrew Berman says, &quot;A fourth tower would utterly change Pei&apos;s design, and a Silver Towers reisdent complains, &quot;We are oversaturated with NYU building. They have a lot of other options, like in the financial district, but they are just greedy.&quot;  Well, NYU is in talks about possibly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502105646/http://ny.curbed.com/archives/2010/06/15/lower_manhattannyuvillage_love_triangle_heats_up.php">going to Ground Zero</a>.</p>

<p>NYU needs various approvals to move forward with the building; if the approvals don&apos;t come through, the tower would go where the supermarket on Laguardia is.</p>
