<p>Bill Hader, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150325052714/http://gothamist.com/tags/snl">Saturday Night Live</a>&apos;s rubbery-faced king of impressions, is going to leave the variety show after the season finale this week. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150325052714/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/15/arts/television/bill-hader-to-leave-saturday-night-live.html">He tells the NY Times</a>, &quot;It was a hard decision, but it has to happen at some point. It got to a point where I said, &apos;Maybe it&#x2019;s just time to go.&apos;&quot;</p>

<p>Hader has been with the show for eight seasons and has been known for his pitch-perfect parodies of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150325052714/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/14/videos_vince_vaughn_hosts_worst_sat.php#photo-4">Al Pacino</a>, a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150325052714/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/10/videos_justin_bieber_and_his_belieb.php#photo-4">dumb Californian</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150325052714/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/12/videos_zooey_deschanel_goes_quirky.php?gallery0Pic=6#photo-7">Clint Eastwood</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150325052714/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/04/videos_lindsay_lohan_tries_to_scare.php#photo-7">James Carville</a>. However, he&apos;s probably best known for being <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150325052714/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/10/video_justin_timberlake_and_stefon.php#photo-5">New York nightlife expert Stefon</a>:</p>

<p>Hader and writer John Mullaney collaborated the character of Stefon&#x2014;Mullaney had met someone who wanted to develop a club with &quot;everything&quot; while Hader based the look on a Chelsea coffee shop barista:</p>

<p>SNL producer Lorne Michael told the Times that when he first saw Hader, he was reminded of Dan Ackroyd, &quot;In terms of intelligence and talent, he was in that same tradition. He was so completely committed to the art of it and enough a student of it that there&#x2019;s something strikingly original. He didn&#x2019;t explode onto the air, but gradually he found his voice, and that became a huge thing.&quot;</p>

<p>Hader was nominated for a supporting actor Emmy this past fall and has been doing other <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150325052714/http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0352778/">TV shows (like The Mindy Project) and films</a>. He doesn&apos;t think his final show will be too emotional, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150325052714/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/20/video_snl_says_tearful_goodbye_to_k.php#photo-1">like Kristen Wiig&apos;s</a> last year, &quot;My joke was, we&#x2019;ll start singing &#x2018;Ruby Tuesday&#x2019; and just say bye to Kristen again. I can just do a little wave at goodnights, and that signifies it.&quot;</p>

<p>We&apos;ll have fewer laughs for sure&#x2014;just bask in Hader&apos;s brilliance as a Vietnam vet taking a puppet class:</p>
