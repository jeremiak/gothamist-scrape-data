<p>On July 14th, Bruce Springsteen was finishing up his gig as headliner of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406145111/http://www.hardrockcalling.co.uk/">Hard Rock Calling</a>&apos;s Saturday night concert in London&apos;s Hyde Park. So he brought out Paul McCartney to jam and sing with the E Street Band.  But when their finale rendition of &quot;Twist and Shout&quot; was going long&#x2014;and beyond a 10:30 p.m. curfew, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406145111/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/15/london_rich_people_hate_bruce_sprin.php">concert organizers cut off power to the rock legends</a> (see the video below!).  Which seriously pissed off Steven Van Zandt, aka Little Steven, of the E Street Band.</p>

<p>Van Zandt fired off a series of angry Tweets, &quot;One of the great gigs ever in my opinion. But seriously, when did England become a police state?&quot; and &quot;The cops got nothing more important to do? How about they go catch some criminals instead of fucking with 80,000 people having a good time?&quot;  Now, a week and a half later, he feels bad.</p>

<p>In a column for The Huffington Post, Van Zandt writes:</p><blockquote>Regarding [police officer] Nick [Aldworth] and his fellow officers I want to officially apologize for blaming them. I was mistakenly informed it was they who pulled the plug. We know now it wasn&apos;t. I apologize because I was wrong, because I have a lot of cop friends, and because I don&apos;t want the obviously hyperbolic question I asked, &apos;when did England become a police state?&apos; to be misinterpreted as a criticism of the police themselves. <p></p>

<p>We all know and should appreciate the tough job they do day after day putting their lives at risk for our safety. And we all know with the Olympics upon us their jobs will be twice as hard as the threat of terrorism is very real. I personally lost a policeman friend of mine in the line of duty so I truly understand what they go through on our behalf. </p>

<p>The point I was trying to make, clumsily as the attempt may have been, is we all need to keep a good eye on rules and regulations, enacted with the best of intentions, being carried out rigidly and mindlessly regardless of the circumstance.</p></blockquote>Van Zandt acknowledges that the organizers were trying to make sure their license for future shows wouldn&apos;t be revoked by the Westminster Council.  So he suggests that the Council, which might represent a few hundred homes, might be the &quot;&apos;tyranny of a minority.&apos; In this case a Council representing, what? 200? 300 homes? Against a rare moment of relaxation and pleasure in an increasingly cold and desperate world for 70,000?&quot;<p></p>
