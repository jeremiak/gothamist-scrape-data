<p>A man in his 50s was stabbed on the southbound 1 train platform at the West 18th Street subway station earlier this morning.</p>

<p>Police say that around 5:30 a.m. they were told of a male who had been stabbed. Officers found the victim stabbed multiple times in the torso. He was taken to Bellevue Hospital and is now in stable condition.</p>

<p>The NYPD believes the victim may have gotten into a dispute with three men on the platform. The investigation is continuing and southbound 1 trains are currently bypassing the station (check <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140606173749/http://www.mta.info/status/subway/123/23364706">MTA.info</a> for updates).</p>
