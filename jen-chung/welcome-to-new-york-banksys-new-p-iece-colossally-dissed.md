</div></div>					<p>Well, it was only a matter of time! Less than a day after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160309235158/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/01/banksys_back_in_nyc_for_octoberfirs.php#photo-1">Banksy revealed his first piece in New York</a> since 2010, the stencil was painted over. A Gothamist reader sent us this photograph from the Lower East Side, explaining, &quot;I got up early this morning to check out the Banksy on Allen between Hester and Canal before work and it&apos;s already been painted over.&quot;  </p>

<p>Banksy says he&apos;s &quot;attempting to host an entire show on the streets of New York,&quot; with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160309235158/http://www.banksyny.com/">his website</a> calling it an &quot;artists [<em>sic</em>] residency&quot; for the month of October. Given that his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160309235158/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/17/banksy_arrives_in_new_york.php#photo-1">2010 NYC pieces</a> were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160309235158/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/18/banksy_gets_dissed.php#photo-1">tagged nearly immediately</a> after they were revealed, it&apos;s not surprised that this one&#x2014;showing a boy holding a can of spray paint while standing on another boy&apos;s back (and the spray paint can is in a sign that says &quot;Graffiti Is A Crime&quot;)&#x2014;was hit hard.</p>

<p>At some point in the evening, the sign was removed, and later someone posted a tag in the white space. The graffiti this morning reads, &quot;(c) PHATLIPP Sweaty palms made me lose the love of my life :(&quot;</p>

<p>Now the wait is on for his next piece. Or is the promise of a month-long art show a hoax too?</p>
