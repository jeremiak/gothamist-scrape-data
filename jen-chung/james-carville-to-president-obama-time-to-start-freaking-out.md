Forget the  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110916223502/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/10/with_turner_ahead_dems_still_optimi.php">Democratic candidate kinda sucked</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110916223502/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/15/jon_stewart_democrats_agree_weiners.php">didn&apos;t even live in the district</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110916223502/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/2011/09/14/2011-09-14_only_in_ny__the_guy_in_the_twit_pix_isnt_the_car_wreck.html">ran a stupid campaign</a>. And ignore that Israel was a huge issue.  Because political strategist James Carville thinks Obama better start firing people NOW.</p>

One word came to mind: Panic</strong>.&quot;  His specific suggestions include: &quot;1. Fire somebody. No -- fire a lot of people... 2. Indict people. There are certain people in American finance who haven&apos;t been held responsible for utterly ruining the economic fabric of our country.... 3. Make a case like a Democrat. While we are going along with the Republican austerity garbage, who is making the case against it? It&apos;s not the Democrats!&quot; and &quot;4. Hold fast to an explanation. Stick to your rationale for what has happened and what is going to happen under your leadership.&quot; </p>

<p>Carville worries, &quot;As I watch the Republican debates, I realize that we are on the brink of a crazy person running our nation. I sit in front of the television and shudder at the thought of one of these <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110916223502/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/08/perry_calls_social_security_a_ponzi.php">creationism-loving, global-warming-denying</a>, immigration-bashing, Social-Security-cutting, clean-air-hating, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110916223502/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/14/video_1988_ron_paul_slams_chubby_dr.php">mortality-fascinated</a>, Wall-Street-protecting Republicans running my country.&quot;  </p>
