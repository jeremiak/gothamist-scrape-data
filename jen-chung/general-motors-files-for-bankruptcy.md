The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160309035615/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/02/business/02auto.html?hp">NY Times reports</a>, &quot;The company was forced into the filing by President Obama, who is betting that by temporarily nationalizing the onetime icon of American capitalism, he can save at least a diminished automaker that is competitive.&quot;<p></p>

<p>The government is providing $30 billion to GM&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160309035615/http://freep.com/article/20090601/BUSINESS01/90601021/GM%20files%20for%20bankruptcy%20protection?GID=HSThwgsdLUPzcFk221PaMMlWo9R5WC3KOy6tOpxHSa0%3D">on top of the $19 billion already given</a> to the automaker, which has seen its sales drop 50% this year&#x2014;during the bankruptcy. The government&apos;s contribution will become a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160309035615/http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=aA1LQFDhqkJ0&amp;refer=home">60% stake in the company</a>.  Of course, as the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160309035615/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB124385428627671889.html">Wall Street Journal puts it</a>, &quot;The question now facing 56,000 auto workers, 3,600 GM dealers and the Obama administration: Will it work?&quot;  </p>

<p>The WSJ also details some of the issues ahead, from not knowing when &quot;consumer demand for new cars will rebound&quot; to the &quot;possibility of meddling by Congress in the company&apos;s daily operations and business plans,&quot; plus &quot;closing more than a dozen factories and shedding the Pontiac, Saturn, Saab and Hummer brands...[which]could take years, with potential extra costs to taxpayers if the process bogs down.&quot; The Obama administration is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160309035615/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/06/01/AR2009060100697.html?hpid=topnews">also dealing with claims</a> that the restructuring plan is more favorable to UAW workers, than to other stakeholders.</p>

<p>Cantor Fitzgerald&apos;s chief global strategist in London, Stephen Pope, told Bloomberg News, &quot;It&#x2019;s been a long time coming, but the reality of a GM bankruptcy is still a bitter pill to swallow -- it&#x2019;s a bit like the Titanic sinking. This is a step they should have taken more than a year ago, which could have put them in much better shape before the economy went down.&#x201D;  The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160309035615/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/01/business/01downfall.html?ref=todayspaper">NY Times lists some missteps</a> by the automaker, such as &quot;bungl[ing] efforts in the 1980s to cut costs by sharing the underpinnings of its cars across different brands, blurring their distinctiveness&quot; and giving &quot;in to union demands in 1990 and created a program that paid workers even when plants were not running, forcing it to build cars and trucks it could not sell without big incentives.&quot;</p>
