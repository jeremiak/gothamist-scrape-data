<p>Yesterday, just after midnight, the over 160 Department of Sanitation employees headed to Times Square to clean up after the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150206152457/http://gothamist.com/2009/01/01/2009_new_years_in_times_square.php">New Year&apos;s revelers</a>. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150206152457/http://www.1010wins.com/Times-Square-Cleanup-Yields-41-Tons-of-Trash/3585318">According to 1010 WINS</a>, that crew worked until 8 a.m., and then another shift came in at 11 a.m. to further &quot;tidy&quot; up the area.  It&apos;s believed that over 41 tons of garbage were collected, but since there were 25 mph winds, it&apos;s hard to say exactly how much detritus they picked up.  Sanitation Commission John Doherty said, &quot;It takes a while. Last night was a windy night. <strong>There&apos;s probably confetti as far as the East River</strong>.&quot;</p>

<p>And the Times Square Alliance believes that a million people braved the freezing temperatures to ring in 2009 in Times Square.  </p>
