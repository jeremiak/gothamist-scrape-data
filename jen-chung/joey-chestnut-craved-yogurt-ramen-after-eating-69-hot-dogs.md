<p>How does it feel after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504174023/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/04/hot_dog_eating_contest_winner.php#photo-1">eating 69 hot dogs in 10 minutes</a> on a sweltering July day? Well, you&apos;re not very full. After <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504174023/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/04/hot_dog_eating_contest_winner.php#photo-1">his historic seventh win in a row</a>, Nathan&apos;s Hot Dog Eating Contest champion Joey Chestnut <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504174023/http://www.tmz.com/2013/07/05/joey-chestnut-nathans-hot-dog-eating-contest-video/">assured a TMZ cameraman</a> that he felt a &quot;little bit like garbage&quot;&#x2014;and that he had the meat sweats: </p>

<p>A little after that encounter, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504174023/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/hotdog-eating-champ-joey-chestnut-581152">Chestnut spoke to the Hollywood Reporter</a> at length about the process of getting back to &quot;normal,&quot; whatever normal is for a guy who can eat nine pounds of deep-fried asparagus (in 10 minutes) or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504174023/http://www.ifoce.com/rankings.php?action=detail&amp;sn=106">two gallons of chili</a> (in 6 minutes). </p><blockquote>&#x201C;I was feeling rough this morning, but as time passes I feel better and better and my body&#x2019;s getting back to normal,&quot; he told The Hollywood Reporter by phone on Friday. &quot;I was craving a yogurt because I had so much acid in my stomach.&quot; <p></p>

<p>...&quot;It depends on the contest. Hotdogs it takes a day and a half, two days. If it&#x2019;s chicken wings or ribs, I&#x2019;ll be feeling fine the next day because I&#x2019;m not eating that much food,&quot; he said. &quot;The chicken wings and ribs, I&#x2019;ll eat seven, eight pounds, maybe, of meat and it&#x2019;s pretty easy to digest that.&quot;</p>

<p>...&quot;I&#x2019;ve slowly made my body adapt and understand what&#x2019;s going to happen,&quot; Chestnut said about the repetition of his training sessions, which sees him fast for three days and drink gallons of water before binging in a practice contest. &quot;If somebody else tried to do that for the first time, fast for three days and eat a crazy amount of food, it&#x2019;d probably, I don&#x2019;t know, make them sick beyond belief.&quot;</p></blockquote>Chestnut, 29, feels that his limit is 70 hot dogs with the right weather and other conditions and hopes to compete until he&apos;s 35. By the end of the interview, he said, &quot;Actually I&apos;m feeling better right now. I think I&apos;m kind of craving ramen.&quot;<p></p>
