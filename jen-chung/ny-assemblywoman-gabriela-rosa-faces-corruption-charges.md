We <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504145214/http://gothamist.com/2014/05/07/ruben_wills_corruption.php">went seven weeks</a> without an elected official being charged with corruption! (If you&apos;re a pessimist, then it&apos;s only been three weeks since ex-Brooklyn DA Charles Hynes&apos; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504145214/http://gothamist.com/2014/06/02/investigation_finds_ex-brooklyn_da.php">alleged corruption was revealed</a>.) Today, upper Manhattan Assemblywoman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504145214/http://assembly.state.ny.us/mem/Gabriela-Rosa">Gabriela Rosa</a> is in the hot seat.</p>

But the United States attorney&#x2019;s office for the Southern District of New York issued an advisory on Friday afternoon, saying that a hearing for Ms. Rosa in a public corruption matter had been scheduled and using language that typically indicates that a plea is expected.&quot;</p>

<p>Of course, Rosa could change her mind about a plea. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504145214/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/assemblywoman-gabriela-rosa-scheduled-court-public-corruption-charges-article-1.1846687">According to the Daily News</a>, Rosa said after her winning her Assembly seat, &quot;To become the first Dominican-born woman elected in the history of the Assembly of New York, it&#x2019;s big.&quot;</p>
