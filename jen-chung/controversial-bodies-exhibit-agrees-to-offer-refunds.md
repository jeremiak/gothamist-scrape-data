<p>Did you venture to the South Street Seaport to see the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130608041814/http://www.bodiestheexhibition.com/">Bodies Exhibit</a> any time over the past three-plus years?  If so, you&apos;re entitled to a refund because Attorney General Andrew Cuomo and exhibitor Premier <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130608041814/http://www.oag.state.ny.us/press/2008/may/may29a_08.html">agreed to a settlement</a> after a disturbing 20/20 report suggested the bodies used were from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130608041814/http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/story?id=4950595&amp;page=1">executed Chinese prisoners who may have been tortured</a>.  </p>

<p>Premier licenses the bodies from Dalian Hoffen Bio Technique Company Limited, which &quot;<strong>acquired the bodies indirectly from the Chinese Bureau of Police, which deemed them unclaimed at death</strong>.&quot;  According to the AG&apos;s office, &quot;The bodies were put through a process called &apos;plastination,&apos; in which a cadaver is stripped of its skin, dissected to show a part of the internal anatomy and infused with plastic that is then hardened.&quot;  Flashback: When the exhibit first opened in NYC in 2005, a representative told the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130608041814/http://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/18/nyregion/18bodies.html">NY Times it cost $25 million to get the bodies</a>, &quot;I am certain that all these specimens were legally obtained.&quot;</p>

<p>Now, Cuomo say, &quot;Despite repeated denials, we now know that Premier itself cannot demonstrate the circumstances that led to the death of the individuals...This settlement is a start.&#x201D;  Premier said it was happy to reach a settlement and added, &quot;We look forward to exhibiting our bodies show in New York for many years to come.&quot;  Premier has put $50,000 in escrow; currently it&apos;s unclear how Bodies attendees can go about getting a refund.</p>
