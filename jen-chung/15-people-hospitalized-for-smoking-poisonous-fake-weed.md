<p>New Yorkers are getting increasingly sick from smoking packets of synthetic marijuana, which are still readily available in bodegas and head shops despite <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160310192309/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/29/fake_weed_gets_banned_in_ny_stoners.php">being banned two years ago.</a> According to a DOH release, fifteen people have been hospitalized with &quot;severe adverse reactions&quot; to the product since Thursday, and ER visits related to fake weed are up 220% in 2014.</p>

<p>The recent hospitalizations occurred in Harlem and Chelsea.</p>
