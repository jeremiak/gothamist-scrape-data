<p>One of the highlights of the upcoming Tribeca Film Festival is the Richard Linklater film, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604104346/http://tribecafilm.com/filmguide/513a83b7c07f5d4713000348-before-midnight"><em>Before Midnight</em></a>, the follow-up to 2004&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604104346/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvFosXeqmDg"><em>Before Sunset</em></a>, which, of course, was the sequel to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604104346/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtvrzpebA6k"><em>Before Sunrise</em></a> (1995). And now there&apos;s a trailer!</p>

<p>This third film continues to follow Jesse, an American, and Celine, a Parisian, who first met on a train ride and spend a memorable night together in <em>Before Sunrise. Before Sunset </em>showed another meeting between the pair, nine years later, with a married-with-a-son Jesse and Celine in Paris. Now, Jesse and Celine are now together, with twin daughters, visiting Greece, dissecting their relationship. Celine says of Jesse, &quot;You never stop ogling girls,&quot; and at another point, Jesse says Celine is the &quot;Mayor of Crazytown.&quot; </p>

<p>The Hollywood Reporter caught the film at Sundance and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604104346/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movie/before-midnight/review/414032">called it &quot;remarkable.&quot;</a> Delpy, Hawke and Linklater share screenwriting credit for this film (the trio, as well as Kim Krizian, were received a screenwriting Oscar nomination for <em>Before Sunset</em>) and they are giving a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604104346/http://tribecafilm.com/festival/events/directors-series-richard-linklater-with-ethan-hawke-and-julie-delpy">talk at the Tribeca Film Festival on April 22</a>.</p>
