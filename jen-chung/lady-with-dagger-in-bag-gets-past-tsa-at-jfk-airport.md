Yet this slip-up was just the latest in a string of embarrassing security mishaps &#x2014; three in February &#x2014; by the federal Transportation Security Administration.&quot;<p></p>

<p>The screening area at JetBlue&apos;s Terminal 5 was shut down for two hours and eventually the Port Authority police arrested Gabrielle Olsen, 26.  The Post reports, &quot;TSA agents had initially flagged her for having a bottle of liquid in her bag. The screeners confiscated the bottle but missed the antique knife, police sources said. It wasn&#x2019;t until after she had departed the security-check area at 6:09 a.m. that the knife was identified on a screening-machine X-ray. <strong>Olsen told police that her father, an antiques dealer, had given it to her for protection, police sources said.</strong>&quot; People, refer to this <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170325091129/http://www.tsa.gov/travelers/airtravel/prohibited/permitted-prohibited-items.shtm">list of prohibited items</a>! Fun fact: Dead snakes are allowed on the plane, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170325091129/http://blog.tsa.gov/2012/03/tsa-week-in-review-60mm-mortar-round.html">but if they were in liquid</a>...</p>

<p>There was an hours-long shutdown of the British Airways terminal at JFK Airport <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170325091129/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/24/jfk_airport_reopens_after_security.php">when a passenger evaded TSA screeners</a> on February 24. The Post adds, &quot;Earlier last month, a TSA agent mistakenly let a civilian get past a checkpoint. The man was merely trying to greet his wife.</p>
