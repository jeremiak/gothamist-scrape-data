</div></div>					<p>The MTA announced that a stained glass installation at the Freeman Street subway statio in the South Bronx has been recognized by the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160327030457/http://www.artsusa.org/">Americans for the Arts</a>&apos;s Year in Review &quot;as one of the most successful public art projects of the past year.&quot;  Bronx-born <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160327030457/http://artwing.com/">Daniel Hauben</a> created faceted glass scenes--called <i>The El</i>--for the downtown and uptown platforms.</p>

<p>Hauben, who received a proclamation from Bronx Borough President Adolfo Carrion Jr. and was celebrated by the MTA Arts for Transit and Bronx Council on the Arts, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160327030457/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/08/13/a-bronx-artists-ode-to-street-life-in-glass/">told City Room</a>, &#x201C;It&#x2019;s not Times Square, it&#x2019;s the Freeman Street station in the Bronx. Often, when I talk to people about it and show them images, when I tell them where it is, I feel it&#x2019;s not necessarily likely they&#x2019;ll make it to that part of the Bronx, which is not on the beaten path for a lot of people. It was certainly wonderful to get this kind of acknowledgment.&#x201D;<br>
