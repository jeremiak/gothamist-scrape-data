<p>Yesterday police <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427145818/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/17/police_use_pepper_spray_to_stop_mcc.php">pepper-sprayed McCarren Pool visitors</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427145818/http://awalkintheparknyc.blogspot.com/2012/07/nypd-arrest-3-in-mccarren-pool-assault.html">made three arrests,</a> but the bedlam wasn&apos;t limited to the pool itself. According to Williamsburg resident <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427145818/https://twitter.com/NickyBalls/status/225360087647133697">Nick Gallo,</a> who took the above photograph, the chaos in the pool spilled out onto Lorimer Street as police sirens blared from 12 squad cars. &quot;There was a huge crowd,&quot; Gallo says, adding that the police frantically exited their vehicles. &quot;One [cop] even dropped his walkie-talkie.&quot; </p>

<p>By the time Gallo got to the pool, he saw two men in handcuffs, who were screaming.  &quot;I think one had been maced,&quot; he recalled. &quot;He was yelling how his eyes hurt. A cop kept yelling, &apos;You&apos;re just going to make it worse!&apos;&quot;  There was also a large group of girls, apparently the arrestees&apos; friends, who looked &quot;upset and worried.&quot;  The police arrested three men&#x2014;ages 23 and 24&#x2014;who were hit with charges like obstruction of governmental administration, resisting arrest and disorderly conduct.</p>

<p>The pool&apos;s reopening after a $50 million renovation took place just three weeks ago; the day after it opened, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427145818/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/30/day_after_opening_mccarren_park_poo.php">lifeguards were attacked</a> (for prohibiting backflips); a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427145818/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/03/two_cops_sent_to_hospital_after_mcc.php">police officer was attacked</a>; and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427145818/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/03/in_addition_to_beatings_people_also.php">lockers were broken into</a>.  Today, the NYC Mayor&apos;s Office <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427145818/https://twitter.com/NYCMayorsOffice/status/225590195012116480">Tweeted</a>, ICYMI: Denis Hamill visited McCarren Park on Friday. He found a &quot;summer oasis of peace and calm&quot;: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427145818/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn-mccarren-park-pool-offers-a-summer-oasis-peace-calm-article-1.1114571">http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brook &#x2026;</a>&quot;</p>

<p>Gallo lives a block from the pool&#x2014;he can hear the pool&apos;s whistles from his apartment&#x2014;and swims laps during the pool&apos;s morning &quot;early bird&quot; hours.  His experiences in the past 20 days of the pool&apos;s renwed existence have been good, but his girlfriend wasn&apos;t able to swim the day someone <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427145818/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/09/mccarren_park_pool_evacuated_after.php">pooped in the pool</a>.  He has noticed that the pool&apos;s reopening means there are &quot;more kids hanging around.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I like the pool,&quot; Gallo said, but it&apos;d be &quot;fine just to have concerts at the pool again.&quot;  He added that his stepmother lived in the neighborhood when the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427145818/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/04/flashback_mccarren_park_pool.php">pool closed in 1984</a>, &quot;She said no one went there when it was open because <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427145818/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/04/the_mccarren_park_pool_is_history_d.php">it was bad</a>.  It was trouble.&quot;</p>
