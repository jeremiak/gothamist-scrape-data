<p>Rats are intelligent creatures&#x2014;they&apos;ve been wily enough to survive by eating all the trash we leave behind <em>and</em> developing immunities from all the raticide. And it seems they also don&apos;t appreciate your attempts to film them. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160812135915/http://www.theblaze.com/blog/2014/08/18/this-video-is-all-the-proof-you-need-that-giant-nyc-rats-are-not-actually-afraid-of-humans/">Josiah Ryan, editor at The Blaze, was waiting for a train</a> at the Bryant Park subway station on Friday and saw an &quot;enormous New York City rat loitering on the platform, possibly awaiting the D train. Being a responsible journalist, I swiftly whipped out my always-present camera to immortalize the creature for you and for posterity.&quot; And then the rat decided to <b>charge towards him</b> at an impressive clip:</p>

And this rat just comes straight at me with no provocation. I mean maybe he didn&#x2019;t want to be recorded. I don&#x2019;t know how smart they are.&quot; He added, &quot;The only damage was to my dignity. The rat passed nearby, possibly between my legs, but faded at the moment of crisis. If I have rabies, I don&#x2019;t know it yet.&quot;</p>

<p>Let&apos;s enjoy some of that rat&apos;s sprinting:</p>

<p>PIX11 reports that despite what the video suggests, the MTA feels its efforts to decrease the rat population&#x2014;by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160812135915/http://web.mta.info/nyct/RatPopulationManagementScientificFieldStudy.htm">sterilizing female rats with special non-toxic bait</a>&#x2014;are working.</p>
