<p>On Tuesday, an off-duty police officer was driving the wrong way on the NY State Thruway near Suffern <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510014722/http://gothamist.com/2014/08/12/off-duty_cop_dead_after_driving_wro.php">when he crashed into another vehicle</a> (which was going the correct direction). The officer, Richard Christopher, 32, died, as did the other driver, James Devito, 59. Now witnesses say that Christopher was making a U-Turn on the highway.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510014722/http://www.lohud.com/story/news/local/rockland/2014/08/13/thruway-double-fatal-wrongway-rockland-richard-christopher-james-devito/14011471/">The Journal News reports</a>, &quot;Several people saw a pickup truck driver make a U-turn across the Thruway and head south... One witness said the U-turn across the three northbound lanes happened near the Thruway overpass, about a half-mile from the accident site, police said in a statement. &apos;The vehicle faced south on the shoulder of the northbound lane. It&apos;s not something that is very common,&apos; said Trooper Matthew Iznicki, a spokesman.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510014722/http://dmv.ny.gov/about-dmv/chapter-5-intersections-and-turns#mku-trn">The NY State DMV says of U-turns</a>, &quot;Do not try a U-turn on a highway unless absolutely necessary.&quot;</p>

<p>Christopher was supposed to be at his Bronx precinct that day. Police are continuing to investigate the crash and why he was on the wrong side of the highway, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510014722/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/NY-Thruway-Wrong-Way-Crash-Witness-Accounts-Off-Duty-Cop-Truck-Turned-Around-I-87-271166881.html">toxicology tests are pending</a>.</p>
