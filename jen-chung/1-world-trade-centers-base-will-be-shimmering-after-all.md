<p>Last year, it was reported that the Port Authority was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408105434/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/12/one_world_trade_center_scraps_its_s.php">ditching plans to use shimmering &quot;prismatic glass panels&quot;</a> to make the bunker-like base of 1 World Trade Center look less <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408105434/http://gothamist.com/2005/06/30/freedom_tower_v_20.php">bunker-like</a>.  But now it looks like the base of tallest building in NYC (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408105434/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/09/1_world_trade_center_may_not_be_177.php">if not the U.S.</a>) won&apos;t look so ugly.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408105434/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/business/world_trade_center_offers_warm_welcome_98qnSJ2LCfZ3KTpBFJpTSJ">Post&apos;s Steve Cuozzo featured a new rendering of the base</a>, &quot;a shimmering, richly textured facade on four sides of glass, stainless steel and aluminum. While bickering goes on over the iconic office tower&#x2019;s crown, its street-level face is just as vital &#x2014; not only to Cond&#xE9; Nast employees who will move in by 2015, but to the millions of visitors to the 16-acre WTC site.&quot;  </p>

<p>The previous prismatic panels caused worries that they were easily break and the project was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408105434/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/12/nyregion/at-1-world-trade-center-effort-to-cover-base-in-glass-is-dropped.html">stopped after $10 million had been spent</a>.  Now, the new panels&#x2014;which Cuozzo describes as &quot;vertical glass fins protruding from panels of stainless steel slats. The fins will be arrayed in patterns that will vary as they move up the facade&quot;&#x2014;are expected to cost $40 million.  </p>
