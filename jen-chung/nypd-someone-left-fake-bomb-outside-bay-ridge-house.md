<p>The NYPD release images and video of a person wanted for questioning about a suspicious device left outside a home in Bay Ridge. Someone put a propane tank with a number pad and wire protruding outside retired firefighter Ed Green&apos;s house, rang the doorbell and ran away, causing chaos just after midnight yesterday.</p>

<p>Green called it &quot;pretty bizarre,&quot; but added, &quot;<strong>I&apos;ve been through 9/11 so it was no big deal for me.</strong> I was worried about my wife and kids.&quot;  Another neighbor felt it was pretty scary, &quot;There was wires on it. It looked like some kind of timing device. To put wires on something to alarm somebody, it&apos;s just odd. I would like to think it was just some stupid prank someone thought was funny.&quot;</p>

<p>State Senator Martin Golden <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130522113407/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/sicko_puts_fake_bomb_on_doorstep_H7DZhGGbK8rqTfsUDqhxtO?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20Brooklyn">wasn&apos;t laughing</a>, &quot;These childish pranks are no laughing matter. During a time of grave concern, when everyone is on heightened alert, to divert police and public resources for a gag is a criminal act, and should be treated as such.&quot;</p>

<p>The person of interest, seen fleeing the scene of the incident, is described as an adult white male wearing dark clothing.<br>
