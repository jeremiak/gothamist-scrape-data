<p>A 21-year-old sociopath-in-training was arrested yesterday for kicking a kitten. And the police caught up with him because the video&#x2014;which shows Andre Robinson grinning like a tough guy (and his friends laughing hysterically)&#x2014;was posted on Facebook.</p>

<p>Last Friday, the footage <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429123323/https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?v=555368927914541">was posted on On The Real</a>, with the message, &quot;This is NEVER okay to do. Please share; hopefully somebody will recognize this fool.&quot; </p>

<div class="fb-post" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?v=555368927914541" data-width="640"><div class="fb-xfbml-parse-ignore"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429123323/https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?v=555368927914541">Post</a> by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429123323/https://www.facebook.com/onthereal">On The Real</a>.</div></div>

<p>Apparently viewers of the video &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429123323/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2621153/Man-arrested-horrific-cat-kicking-video-surfaced-Facebook-horror-animal-lovers-helped-track-down.html">used video enhancing software to blow up the scene</a>&quot; which led cops to find the building, 1831 Fulton Street at the Breevort Houses. Police then recognized Robinson, who has prior arrests including knifepoint robbery. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429123323/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/cat-flying-kick-heartless-creep-bk-article-1.1780412">The Daily News reports</a> that he admitted to the cops that he was the kicker: &quot;Cops said Robinson had been outside waiting for a food delivery when the incident happened. He turned to his friends and said, &apos;Watch this,&apos; according to cops. One of his friends started recording with his phone as Robinson set his trap for the cat.&quot;</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429123323/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2014_04_kittenkick2.jpg"> <img alt="2014_04_kittenkick2.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429123323im_/http://gothamist.com/assets_c/2014/05/2014_04_kittenkick2-thumb-1200x444-841451.jpg" width="640" height="236" class="image-none"> </a> </span></p>

<p>The video shows Robinson kicking the cat very hard; &quot;According to the arrest report, the cat flew about 20 feet &#x2014; and a veterinarian confirmed to cops the brutal blow likely caused serious injury,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429123323/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/cat-flying-kick-heartless-creep-bk-article-1.1780412">per the Daily News</a>. It&apos;s unclear where the cat is now, but police are looking for it.</p>

<p>A police source <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429123323/http://nypost.com/2014/05/05/man-arrested-after-kicking-cat-in-shocking-video/">told the Post</a>, &#x201C;People who saw (the video) were really disturbed by it.&#x201D; Robinson was charged with aggravated animal cruelty.</p>

<p>However, Robinson&apos;s mother insisted he was not a bad person, &quot;He had to be high on something. It&#x2019;s very out of his character. He had to be high to do what he did. This isn&#x2019;t him... He loves animals. He loved his cats, he had dogs, he always loved them.&quot;</p>
