<p>A day after their daughter&apos;s funeral, the parents of the woman killed while jogging in Queens spoke to the press. Her mother, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108040057/http://www.fox5ny.com/news/186743723-story">Cathy Vetrano had this message</a> for the perpetrator: &quot;The whole world (will) know what a pathetic, puny, weak piece of filth you are.&quot;</p>

<p>Karina Vetrano, 30, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108040057/http://gothamist.com/2016/08/03/missing_jogger_found_dead_in_howard.php">was killed last Tuesday night</a>, during a 5 p.m. run through Howard Beach. Her father, who usually ran with her but didn&apos;t that night due a back injury, contacted the police when she didn&apos;t return home or answer her phone. At 11 p.m., police tracked her cellphone to Spring Creek Park near 161 Avenue and 78 Street; her father, who had joined the search, was the first to see his daughter&apos;s body. </p>

<p>Vetrano <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108040057/http://gothamist.com/2016/08/04/jogger_queens_rape_murder.php">was strangled and raped</a>, and the NYPD said that she fought her attacker. Her teeth <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108040057/http://gothamist.com/2016/08/05/slain_jogger_howard_beach.php">were reportedly broken</a> during the assault and her hands were found clutching weeds.</p>

<p>Philip and Cathy Vetrano appeared with other family members outside their Howard Beach home yesterday. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108040057/http://www.people.com/article/karina-vetranos-mother-lashes-out-at-daughters-killer">She told reporters</a>, &quot;My daughter was a force to be reckoned with. And I guarantee you, you motherf-----, that you will be reckoning with that force, not only for the rest of your pathetic life, but for the rest of eternity as you f------ burn in hell.&quot;</p>

<p>Philip Vetrano thanked the authorities for their work, &quot;All the police have been tireless, courageous, kind, generous and helpful beyond words. My self and my family owe everything to the NYPD.&quot;</p>

<p>There is currently a $10,000 reward for information leading to an arrest in the case. Meanwhile, investigators have been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108040057/http://gothamist.com/2016/08/06/slain_joggers_earphones_sneaker_fou.php#photo-3">combing through the tall, weedy</a> marshlands of Spring Creek Park in search of clues. </p>
