<p>Leibovits was convicted in March and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170323232218/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2010/04/12/2010-04-12_rabbi_baruch_lebovits_is_sentenced_to_10_23_to_32_years_in_prison_for_molesting_.html">sentenced to up to 32 years in prison</a>; he&apos;s currently at Rikers awaiting trial for a different sex abuse case. The Queens company providing the special Kosher food (Salisbury steak! cheese ravioli!) had offered to ship the items, but a Rikers captain went to pick it up because a delay.  </p>

<p>While the head of United Jewish Organizations of Williamsburg told the Post, &quot;This is not a privilege or an accommodation -- it&apos;s a right. Any Jewish prisoner has the religious right to eat food that is appropriate according his religious traditions,&quot; another Jewish advocate called it a &quot;big chutzpah... They are bending over backwards to help this molester. None of the other Jewish inmates can get that same food.&quot; Even FDNY chaplain Joseph Potasnik said, &quot;There&apos;s no reason to give special food to one inmate.&quot;</p>
