</div></div>					The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160824114136/http://www.mcny.org/">Museum of the City of New York</a> welcomed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160824114136/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/06/gothamist_celebrates_the_new_year_a.php">us to its landmark building last week</a>, opening up galleries featuring stunning exhibitions covering NYC&apos;s culture, urban planning, crime and more. Curators took us and our guests on tours of four wonderful exhibitions: <br>
<ul>
	<li><em><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160824114136/http://www.mcny.org/exhibitions/current/The-Greatest-Grid.html">The Greatest Grid: The Master Plan of Manhattan, 1811-2011</a></em> celebrates the 200th anniversary of NYC&apos;s street grid design and shows amazing maps and photographs of the city. </li>
	<li><em><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160824114136/http://www.mcny.org/exhibitions/current/Cecil-Beaton-The-New-York-Years.html">Cecil Beaton: The New York Years</a></em> is a look at the British dandy&apos;s conquest of Big Apple culture and society, through his photography and drawings (much of it for fashion publications like Vogue), design (he won an Oscar for designing costumes and set for <em>My Fair Lady</em>), relationships with Greta Garbo and Truman Capote and uncanny sense of the next big thing. </li>
	<li><em><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160824114136/http://www.mcny.org/exhibitions/current/Police-Work-Leonard-Freed.html">Police Work: Photographs by Leonard Freed, 1972-1979</a></em> is a gritty look at the crime-ridden days of the city, when cops&apos; lapels were as big as their squad cars. If you like the films of Sidney Lumet, you&apos;ll love this one. </li>
	<li><em><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160824114136/http://www.mcny.org/exhibitions/current/Kevin-Roche-Architecture-as-Environment.html">Kevin Roche: Architecture as Environment</a></em> pays tribute to the architect&apos;s works, including the Ford Foundation and the United Nations Plaza.</li>
</ul><br>
There are many <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160824114136/https://boxoffice.mcny.org/public/">upcoming tours and talks</a> about these exhibitions&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160824114136/https://boxoffice.mcny.org/public/">check them out</a>!
