<p>The Israeli military says it has found the bodies of three teenagers who were allegedly kidnapped by Hamas militants. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140706161545/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2014/06/30/kidnapped-israeli-teens/">The AP reports</a>, &quot;The grisly discovery culminated a feverish search that led to Israel&#x2019;s largest ground operation in the Palestinian territory in nearly a decade and raised fears of renewed fighting with Hamas. Eyal Yifrah, 19, Gilad Shaar, 16, and Naftali Frenkel, a 16-year-old with dual Israeli-American citizenship, disappeared while hitchhiking home near the West Bank city of Hebron late at night on June 12 and were never heard from again.&quot; </p>

<p>The bodies were found in Halhul, 15 minutes north of Hebron. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140706161545/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/01/world/middleeast/Israel-missing-teenagers.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;version=HpSumSmallMedia&amp;module=first-column-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news">According to the NY Times</a>, &quot;The disappearances set off an uproar in Israel and deeply aggravated the already strained relations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority, which had just taken steps to form a unity government backed by Hamas, the militant group that controls the Gaza Strip. Israeli officials, who have rejected that government, have identified two Palestinians from Hebron they say are affiliated with Hamas as prime suspects. Hamas did not take responsibility, but praised the abductions. The intensity and scope of the Israeli security operation to find the missing teenagers was the biggest in the West Bank in more than a decade, and has left at least five Palestinians dead.&quot;</p>

<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140706161545/http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=326958827&amp;ft=1&amp;f=">said the three teens were</a> &quot;were kidnapped and murdered in cold blood by wild beasts... Hamas is responsible, and Hamas will pay.&quot; </p>

<p>Naftali Frenkel&apos;s family is originally from Brooklyn, and local and state officials have issued statements:</p>
