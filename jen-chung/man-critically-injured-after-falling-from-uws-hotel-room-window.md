<p>A 29-year-old man was critically injured after falling from the 10th floor window of a Manhattan hotel room yesterday afternoon and landed on scaffolding. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160803052330/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/17/nyregion/man-critically-injured-in-fall-from-manhattan-hotel.html?_r=1">Another guest recounted</a>, &quot;I heard &#x2018;boom, boom&#x2019; and that was it. It was &#x2018;boom.&#x2019; And then &#x2018;boom.&#x2019; The first one was loud and the second was less.&quot;</p>

<p>The incident occurred at the Days Inn at 215 West 94th Street around 3:30 p.m. The victim, who is from Washington State, had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160803052330/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Man-Critical-after-Plunge-from-Hotel-Window-in-Manhattan-375955891.html">checked into the hotel on Thursday</a>. </p>

<p>Another person <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160803052330/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2016/04/16/police-man-critically-injured-after-falling-from-hotel-window/">told 1010 WINS</a> that the impact of the fall sounded like a gunshot. The victim was taken to St. Luke&apos;s Hospital in critical condition.</p>

<p>Police are investigating whether it was an accident or if he was pushed.</p>
