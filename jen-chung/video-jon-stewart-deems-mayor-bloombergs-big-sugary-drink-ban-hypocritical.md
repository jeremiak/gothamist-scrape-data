<p>In the wake of Mayor Bloomberg&apos;s latest effort to rule our lives/make sure we&apos;re not obese, Jon Stewart decided to dissect the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120604174929/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/30/bloomberg_wants_to_ban_sugary_drink.php">proposed ban on sugary drinks over 16 ounces</a> on The Daily Show last night: &quot;It combines the draconian government overreach people love with the probable lack of results they expect!&quot; Plus, the idea made Stewart agree with... Tucker Carlson.  </p>

<p>Stewart did acknowledge that he and Bloomberg do have some things in common, &quot;I know you can be intimidated by these large-sized drinks. You and I are both ... let&#x2019;s face it, small. We might see a generously-proportioned sugared beverage and think of it as a drowning hazard, but it&#x2019;s not fair!&quot;</p>

<p>Stewart didn&apos;t understand why Big Gulps are suddenly bad while you&apos;re still able to order about 7 pounds of meat at the Carnegie Deli (plus it costs $3 to split it) and questioned why Serendipity 3&apos;s Frrrozen Hot Chocolate was legal!  Also, he doesn&apos;t know why the fuck <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120604174929/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/27/times_square_pedestrian_plaza.php">there are picnic tables in Times Square</a>.</p>

And Stephen Colbert said <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120604174929/http://www.hulu.com/watch/366562/the-colbert-report-thu-may-31-2012#s-p1-so-i0">on The Colbert Report</a>, &#x201C;First he banned smoking, then he banned trans-fat. Then he added bike lanes everywhere, and now he&#x2019;s gone way too far. This is America, the land of plenty! We haven&#x2019;t achieved Type 3 Diabetes yet!&quot;
