<p>Six women are wanted for allegedly grabbing someone off the street, and then terrorizing her in a car. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160503154215/http://nypost.com/2015/12/12/jealous-bullies-abducted-me-beat-me-and-chopped-off-my-hair/">The victim claims</a>, &quot;This is basically over a boy.&quot;</p>

<p>According to the NYPD, this happened on Friday, December 4th, at 8:45 p.m. in the Bronx, near Grand Avenue:</p>

<blockquote> [Six] female suspects approached the 20 year-old female victim from behind as she was entering her residence, grabbed her and pulled her hood over her head and forced her into a black suburban vehicle. The suspects then drove off and took turns assaulting the victim with closed fists about the head and body causing pain and bruising. One of the suspects produced a small hand torch and a heated piece of metal and threatened to burn the victim.

<p>The suspect continued driving and assaulting the victim with one of the suspects using brass knuckles. The suspects then cut the victim&apos;s hair and threatened to cut her face. The suspects then drove the victim to an unknown location, shoved her out of the vehicle and fled in an unknown direction. The victim&apos;s property which included an iPhone 6s, jewelry, jacket and her keys were taken from her during the assault.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>Victim Omara Navarro spoke to the Post about the incident: &quot;I got kidnapped. My hoodie was over my head &#x2014; two girls came from behind and tried to get me to get into the car.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Navarro described the kidnapping, saying, &quot;They all jumped me, held my hands down and started cutting my hair. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m traumatized. Everyone here really loved my hair, so I&#x2019;m not used to this cut... I still hide it because me, myself, I&#x2019;m not comfortable with short hair yet.&quot;</p>

<p>She also said, &quot;I recently got my body done, I got liposuction. So they were hitting me around my body where I got weak, where I couldn&#x2019;t fight anymore.&quot;</p>

<p>Police also released three photographs of suspects, describing one as having a medium build and dark blonde hair; another as being approximately 22-years-old, 5&apos; and 130 pounds with brown eyes and long black hair; and the third as having a thin build and long black hair. </p>
