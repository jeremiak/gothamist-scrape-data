<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none" style=" width:640px; "> <img alt="2012_02_megamillions10.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120331164138im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2012_02_megamillions10.jpg" width="640" height="426"> <br> <i>People gather in a connivence store to buy Mega Millions lottery tickets yesterday in Portland, OR (AP)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>The blockbuster Mega Millions lottery, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120331164138/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/30/omg_tonights_megamillions_is_540_mi.php">which grew to $640 million</a> as the frenzy for a 1-in-176 million escalated, actually had winning tickets last night.  The winning numbers were 2, 4, 23, 38 and 46 and Mega Ball 23, and state lottery officials say that the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120331164138/http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505268_162-57407484/three-winning-mega-millions-tickets-sold/">tickets were sold in Maryland, Illinois and Kansas</a>.  It&apos;s expected that each winning ticket is worth $213 million before taxes.</p>

<p>There are no details about the ticket sold in Kansas yet, but the Illinois ticket&#x2014;a quick pick one!&#x2014;was sold in Red Bud, which is near Illinois while the Maryland ticket was sold in Baltimore County.  Carole Everett of the Maryland Lottery told the AP &quot;the last time a ticket from the state won a major national jackpot was 2008 when a ticket sold for $24 million,&quot; &quot;We&apos;re thrilled. We&apos;re due and excited.&quot;</p>

<p>And some more factoids from the AP: &quot;Americans spent nearly $1.5 billion for a chance to hit the jackpot, which amounts to a $462 million lump sum and around $347 million after federal tax withholding. With the jackpot odds at 1 in 176 million, it would cost $176 million to buy up every combination. Under that scenario, the strategy would win $171 million less if your state also withholds taxes.&quot;</p>

<p>However, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120331164138/http://twitter.com/katienelson36">according to the Daily News&apos;s Katie Nelson</a>, NYC wasn&apos;t a total loser: &quot;17 2nd prize Mega Millions winners in NY score $250k. (4 in Manh. 3 in Bx, 1 each in Bk, Qns and SI).&quot; </p>
