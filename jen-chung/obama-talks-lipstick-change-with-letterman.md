<p>Presidential candidate Barack Obama appeared on the Late Show with David Letterman and continued to speak out against the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160307123219/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/26633775/">&quot;phony outrage&quot;</a> of the McCain-Palin campaign over the lipstick on a pig remarks.  Letterman asked Obama if he ever actually put lipstick on a pig at about the 1:00 mark in the clip above.  Obama was playful, and eventually pointed out that if one were to actually follow the logic of the McCain-Palin camp illogic, Palin would be the lipstick in the situation.  Letterman, for his part, enjoyed the fact that the Republicans actually had to have a meeting to demand an apology from Obama.</p>

<p>Obama <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160307123219/http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/09/11/on-letterman-obama-discusses-palin-phenomenon/">also poked fun at himself</a> at not being media darling du jour.  But there were some serious questions: Letterman asked whether Obama would have chosen someone different (Hillary Clinton?) if John McCain had picked Palin first (Letterman also called the selection of Palin &quot;calculated...no doubt about it&quot;).  Obama said he wanted someone who can give him good ideas and good advice when he&apos;s making big ideas--and that&apos;s Joe Biden.</p>

<p>In the clip after the jump, Obama discusses Sepetember 11 and gives Giuliani credit and discusses some foreign policy.  </p>
