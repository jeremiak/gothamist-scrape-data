<p>Do not mess with Diddy&apos;s store frontage: The company behind the rap impresario-vodka shiller&apos;s Sean John clothing line is suing its landlord at 475 Fifth Avenue over scaffolding that has been up <em>since 2006</em>.  </p>

<p>TMZ, which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160411061039/http://www.tmz.com/2009/12/30/diddy-sean-john-lawsuit/">has a copy of the lawsuit</a>, says that lawyers for Diddy&apos;s company Christian contend that the landlord &quot;just left [the scaffolding] there -- sending Sean John sales down the toilet -- down nearly 50%&quot; and &quot;claim the scaffolding &apos;substantially obstructed the view of the clothing and furnishings displayed in the ground floor windows.&apos;&quot; Based on the Google Street View, it definitely doesn&apos;t look good.  Also, <em>three years of scaffolding</em>? That&apos;s worse than those buildings that seem to put up scaffolding for months every year!</p>

<p>Diddy&apos;s people want $2.5 million in damages and to be freed from their $660,000+/year lease. </p>
