					<p>It&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170830001041/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/21/nypd_vs_banksy.php">not Banksy</a>, but the NYPD will take whatever victories they can get against street artists. Last night the police department issued an unusually self-congratulatory press release, written in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170830001041/http://gothamist.com/2014/06/18/nypd_bypasses_the_media_to_tell_you.php">style of a heavily slanted news article</a>, about the arrest of Adam Cole, better known to New Yorkers as COST, whose murals and wheatpastes are a familiar sight, whether they are collaborations with others like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170830001041/http://gothamist.com/2009/10/20/high_line_graffiti_almost_all_rubbe.php">with REVS</a> or ENX.</p>

<p>According to the NYPD, Cole, 45, was busted on Sunday, and police officer Colin Sullivan has been determined to nab Cole. He even did research! Here&apos;s a quote from the NYPD&apos;s propaganda piece: &quot;Sullivan read up on the 45-year-old Cole, who had given extensive interviews over the years to newspapers and online sites, and showed published photos of Cole, aka &#x201C;Adam Cost,&#x201D; to his 6th Precinct colleagues - urging them to be on the look-out now that the plastered placards had reappeared.&quot; The NYPD also points out that COST has been posting a lot on Instagram:</p>

<p>The NYPD also made sure to inform the public that COST drives a Porsche Cayenne. The announcement, which stands in stark contrast to the traditionally dry, just-the-facts press releases issued by the NYPD daily, is presented below in full:</p><blockquote>The NYPD A self-described &#x201C;anti-artist&#x201D; known in the 1990s as one of the city&#x2019;s most prolific graffiti vandals - before he entered a self-imposed, 16-year hiatus - has reemerged with vigor, and found himself again in handcuffs.<p></p>

<p>Adam Cole, a Queens native who once specialized in wheat-pasting posters featuring his tag &#x201C;Cost&#x201D; onto walls and doors of private buildings and other structures, was spotted strolling back to his car on otherwise-desolate West 13th Street just before 4 a.m. on Sunday.</p>

<p>The &#x201C;Cost&#x201D; moniker, affixed by a glutinous mixture of water and flour or starch, popped up again across Manhattan over the past few years, and one particular cop took notice.</p>

<p>Police Officer Colin Sullivan read up on the 45-year-old Cole, who had given extensive interviews over the years to newspapers and online sites, and showed published photos of Cole, aka &#x201C;Adam Cost,&#x201D; to his 6th Precinct colleagues - urging them to be on the look-out now that the plastered placards had reappeared.</p>

<p>&#x201C;The tags I saw recently appeared to be pretty fresh,&#x201D; Sullivan said. &#x201C;Everyone in my unit was aware of what this guy looks like. I&#x2019;ve been boring these guys to death with Adam Cost pictures.&#x201D;</p>

<p>The hindering paid off this week as Sullivan&#x2019;s partners in the Cabaret Unit thought they recognized the man out for a super-early Sunday morning stroll. It didn&#x2019;t hurt that Cole was carrying an extendable pole with a wet brush affixed, and his clothes were covered in what appeared to be a goopy paste.</p>

<p>&#x201C;We noticed this man who fit (Cole) to a &#x2018;T&#x2019;,&#x201D; Sgt. Michael Alfieri said.</p>

<p>Alfieri, along with Police Officers Craig Sikorski and William Morris, then looked up and saw a rectangular &#x201C;Cost&#x201D; poster approximately two feet high and three feet wide - the fresh adhesive still dripping from it - emblazoned on scaffolding about 20 feet above a rare wine shop. A glue-filled container sat on the sidewalk below.</p>

<p>The lid for the drum of glue was next to Cole&#x2019;s Porsche Cayenne parked on the same Meatpacking District block, between 7th and 8th Avenues; additional drums and more long brushes could clearly be seen through the windows of the luxury SUV.</p>

<p>The NYPD executed a search warrant on the vehicle on Wednesday, and recovered adhesive, brushes, as well as hundreds of stickers and posters with &#x201C;Cost&#x201D; printed on them.</p>

<p>Cole was charged this week with criminal mischief, making graffiti, and possession of a graffiti instrument in nine separate incidents this year. He was released on bail after arraignment, and is due in court again on Friday.</p>

<p>In the 1990s, Cole was one of the best-known graffiti-ists, later dubbed &#x201C;legendary&#x201D; in a newspaper story marking the return of his tag to the quiet, dark streets of Manhattan.</p>

<p>Despite his ubiquitous work, he was arrested only a couple of times, in 1994, for using a broad-tip marker on a subway wall in Queens (and inexplicably carrying a canister of tear gas), and for tagging his nickname on the steps of another train station.</p>

<p>Cole then went underground for years. His tag first resurfaced around 2010, and more recently he has taken to Instagram, the online photo- and video-sharing social networking service, where his thousands of followers can view his latest tags around the five boroughs.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, police have their own video of the resurgent graffiti vandal.</p>

<p>A minutes-long surveillance tape outside one tagging location, Bar Nan&#xE1; on Gansevoort Street, shows Cole step out of his Porsche and get to work brushing on &#x201C;Cost&#x201D; posters with the very sticky wheat paste.</p>

<p>&#x201C;This stuff is impossible to get off the wall,&#x201D; Police Officer Sullivan said. &#x201C;That&#x2019;s why it&#x2019;s so expensive to remove.&#x201D;</p></blockquote>Street art enthusiast Jake Dobkin told us, &#x201C;COST is a legend and I respect the energy he&#x2019;s put into his recent come-back.  Still, there&#x2019;s a reason most of the artists who have gone &#x201C;all city&#x201D; and then gotten popped by the cops stick to the galleries and legal walls&#x2014;going big a second time is like drawing a target on your forehead for the Vandals Squad.&quot;<p></p>
