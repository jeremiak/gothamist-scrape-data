Ed Wynn Rivera, who suffers from cerebral palsy and is unable to communicate, was found after 17 hours of sitting in the bus (which was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160215011837/http://gothamist.com/2009/01/01/disabled_man_left_on_bus_for_19_hou.php">parked at a Brooklyn depot</a>), freezing and <i>still strapped to his seat</i>.  And what&apos;s more, Rivera had been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160215011837/http://www.nypost.com/seven/01022009/news/regionalnews/bus_freeze_ordeal_146864.htm">sitting right behind the driver</a>.</p>

<p>Linda Hockaday, who had worked for Outstanding Transport, was charged with reckless endangerment.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160215011837/http://wcbstv.com/local/missing.cerebral.palsy.2.898300.html">WCBS 2 reports</a> that sources say &quot;Hockaday admitted to knowing that Rivera was still on the bus when it was locked up on one of the coldest nights of the year.<strong> Her rationale for leaving? She apparently didn&apos;t want to be late for church.</strong>&quot;  Apparently she thought someone else would notice Rivera!  Only Hockaday was charged, and not the driver, because, as the bus matron, she is responsible for passenger safety.</p>

<p>Rivera&apos;s parents were worried when he didn&apos;t arrive back at their East Harlem home from his day program (in Tribeca) on Wednesday afternoon.  They called the police, which searched the depot with K-9 and aviation units but didn&apos;t find him.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160215011837/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/02/nyregion/02disabled.html?ref=nyregion">According to the NY Times</a>, &quot;On Thursday, the police, with help from Mr. Rivera&#x2019;s parents, searched another part of the depot and found Mr. Rivera in the vehicle.&quot;  Rivera&apos;s sister said, &quot;<strong>Of course we&apos;re angry ... How could you just lose a whole person?</strong> ... Now I can say honestly it is a happy New Year. I know that he&apos;s OK. My eyes are red from crying so much.&quot;</p>
