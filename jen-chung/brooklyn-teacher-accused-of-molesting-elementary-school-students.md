<p>Omil Carrasquillo, 36, was removed from P.S. 249 after the allegations were made last week. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013431/http://pix11.com/2014/09/24/exclusive-brooklyn-elementary-school-teacher-arrested-for-allegedly-molesting-multiple-students/">WPIX reports</a> that the alleged victims were students at the school and they &quot;were all 10 to 11 years old. Police sources say the incidents, which all took place on school property between late 2013 and now, were reported on September 19.&quot;</p>

The abuse continued when classes resumed earlier this month, police said. His arraignment was pending.&quot; </p>

<p>Carrasquillo, a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013431/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Omil-Carrasquillo-The-Canton-School-Molesting-Female-Students-NYPD-277042611.html">science teacher</a> with the NYC Department of Education since 2006, was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013431/http://7online.com/education/brooklyn-teacher-accused-of-sexually-abusing-young-girls/323316/">taken into custody yesterday</a>. The DOE said, &quot;These allegations are disturbing and we removed Mr. Carrasquillo immediately. He is not near any students. We are investigating the matter and supporting this school community.&quot;<br>
