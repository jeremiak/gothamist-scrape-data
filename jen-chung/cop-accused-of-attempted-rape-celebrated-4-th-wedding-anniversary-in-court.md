                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left"> <img alt="2013_07_cillos21.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130820200221im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2013_07_cillos21.jpg" width="260" height="317"> <br> <i style=" width:260px; ;display:block"> The Ciollos&apos; wedding picture</i></div> On Wednesday, July 10th, police officer Peter Ciollo was arrested for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130820200221/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/11/nypd_officer_accused_of_giving_teen.php">allegedly trying to rape</a> a 16-year-old girl&#x2014;after plying her with alcohol. He spent yesterday, July 11th, in court, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130820200221/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/11/cop_rape_staten_island_says_teen_ca.php">claiming his innocence</a>&#x2014;it also happened to be his fourth wedding anniversary with his wife Toni.<p></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130820200221/http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2013/07/staten_island_cop_plied_teen_w.html#incart_m-rpt-2">According to the Staten Island Advance</a>, Ciollo&apos;s lawyer said, &quot;Peter denies the allegations, maintains his innocence, looks forward to his day in court... His wife supports him.&quot; But wife Toni Ciollo &quot;spent her fourth wedding anniversary weeping in Staten Island Criminal Court, her bright blond hair pulled back into a tight ponytail.&quot; </p>

<p>What are the allegations? That he took two 16-year-olds to a Staten Island mall at 1 a.m. on July 5th, buying them alcohol and making them drink it&#x2014;and then forcing one to drive drunk to his home. There he allegedly gave them more alcohol, took one of the girls to his room where he showed her porn and suggested that they &quot;act out the actions portrayed in these videos.&quot; Ciollo then allegedly pawed her genitals and, while on a bed, rubbed himself on her. The victim fell asleep and when she awoke, she was not wearing her underwear, she was wearing his.</p>

<p>Law enforcement sources tell the Advance that Ciollo&apos;s wife Toni walked in on them. </p>

<p>Ciollo has been suspended from the police force. He had been working for the 120th Precinct but apparently an injury has kept him from full duty for two years. The 29-year-old, who also faces charges of unlawfully dealing alcohol to a child, endangering the welfare of a child, and sexual abuse, was released on $1500 bail.</p>
