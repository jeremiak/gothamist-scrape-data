<p>A video has been circulating of a man freaking out on a 6 train, yelling racial epithets at other subway riders as well as &quot;shoot me&quot; to a cop, stripping down, and lunging at other riders waiting on the Bronx subway platform before being subdued by a cop. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424005452/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2011/05/10/2011-05-10_naked_wacko_caught_on_tape_stripping_shouting_racist_obscenities_at_passengers_o.html">According to the Daily News</a>, &quot;The officer, assisted by several civilians, finally subdued the naked man. He was taken to Lincoln Hospital for a psychological evaluation and not charged.&quot;</p>

<p>Here&apos;s the video&#x2014;it&apos;s NSFW:</p>
