										<p>It&apos;s no <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161220144159/http://gothamist.com/2009/09/17/video_ernie_anastos_drops_f-bomb_ch.php">&quot;Keep fucking that chicken&quot;</a> but we&apos;ll take it:  On tonight&apos;s 6 p.m. Eyewitness News broadcast, anchor Bill Ritter was discussing how former police commissioner Bernard Kerik was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161220144159/http://gothamist.com/2009/10/20/bernie_kerik_is_going_to_jail.php">headed to jail</a>.  Unfortunately, the words &quot;top cop&quot; came out &quot;top cock.&quot;  Really&#x2014;watch for yourself:</p>

<p>Ritter caught his mistake; the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161220144159/http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv/2009/10/20/2009-10-20_channel_7s_bill_ritter_makes_top_ck_slip_in_story_on_top_cop_bernard_kerik.html">Daily News describes,</a> &quot;The 59-year-old co-anchor realized he flubbed, but looking unflustered immediately bobbed his head and uttered a cleaned-up instant replay, saying &apos;former New York City top cop.&apos;&quot;  He also told the News, &quot;<strong>I stumbled. It was a quick mistake, and I corrected it immediately.</strong>&quot; </p>

<p>And this comes 31 days after we wondered when someone from WABC would <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161220144159/http://gothamist.com/2009/09/19/keep_fucking_that_chicken_double_st.php">make an on-air gaffe</a>.</p>
