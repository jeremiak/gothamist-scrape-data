<p>A 65-year-old found herself $28,000 poorer after a run-in with two scammers earlier this month. Apparently they told her they needed to see her cash before they could trust her with a charitable donation.</p>

<p>The incident began in East Flatbush, on the corner of Church Avenue and Nostrand Avenue, on May 11, just before noon. According to the NYPD, the victim, a 65-year-old woman, was approached by an unidentified woman who started talking to her about a &quot;sizable charitable donation that the unidentified female claimed she could not make herself.&quot; Then an unidentified man joined the discussion, and the unidentified woman said &quot;that she wanted verify that the victim had financial means before entrusting her with money for the alleged donation.&quot;</p>

Apparently, the victim was told that the cash would be blessed. The victim left the car with a bag that allegedly had her $28,000 plus the donation, and the pair left.</p>

<p>When the victim got to her lobby, she looked inside the bag and found it full of shredded newspaper.</p>

<p>The NYPD released images and video of the suspects, who are both described as a being around 50 years old. They are wanted for grand larceny.</p>
