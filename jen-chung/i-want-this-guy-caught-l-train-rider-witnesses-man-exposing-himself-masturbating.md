<p>An L train rider was subjected to the sight of a man exposing himself and then masturbating on a Brooklyn subway on Tuesday night. The revolted witness took photographs of the man and told us, &quot;I want this guy caught. I feel violated and disgusted and want to put this man on blast in hopes someone will recognize him and turn him in.&quot; Now the NYPD has officially asked for the public&apos;s help in identifying him.</p>

<p>The incident occurred on Tuesday night, January 31, just before 10 p.m., on a Brooklyn-bound L train at Atlantic Avenue. The NYPD says, &quot;the individual sat across from the 30 year-old female victim, exposed his genitals and masturbated.&quot; </p>

<p>The victim shared another, more explicit photograph with us, showing the man&apos;s penis. She said, &quot;I was on the train with about 4-5 other people but [on that] side of the train I was on was just me by myself.&quot; The pervert got off the train &quot;before I did,&quot; she said, which relieved her. &quot;I was concerned that if the people on the train with me had left, it could have been a much worse situation.&quot;</p>

<p>When she got off at her stop, the woman recalled, &quot;I reported it to the conductor and was then taken to the transit police for further assistance where I was able to provide my statement to the police.&quot; She explained that the &quot;shame and feeling of being violated&quot; prompted her to speak directly with the police, but she also thinks &quot;it&apos;s great that there are other ways to report&quot; vile incidents of this nature, like the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016015405/http://mta-nyc.custhelp.com/app/ask_sh">MTA&apos;s website</a>.</p>

<p>She added, </p><blockquote>I am very upset about it not as the victim but as a woman. I hate that I have to be so guarded constantly because of how society just contributes to these and worse type of crimes. I am a strong advocate for women and that is why I think these crimes need to be blasted. This is not okay for a woman or just another person to have to witness...<p></p>

<p> I am a daily reader of Gothamist and it was because of all the previous articles about these types of crimes that during my moment of crisis I was able to remain calm and thought about gathering pictures and video to provide the police...</p>

<p>I truly hope that they find this guy because this is just not appropriate behavior. I should be able to feel safe on my way home from work/school/life.</p></blockquote> Authorities describe the suspect as 45-55 years old and 6&apos;1&quot;, with a large backpack and sunglasses. He was last seen wearing a dark colored coat, black pants, black boots, a gray knit cap and a multi-colored scarf around his neck.<p></p>
