And it&apos;s a rude awakening for some people:  One <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160305013335/http://wcbstv.com/local/mta.service.problems.2.1240839.html">told WCBS 2</a>, &quot;That seems like a lot at one time - 18 out of 20 - so very inconvenient for a lot of people. I&apos;m new to New York, I don&apos;t know if this is a regular thing.&quot; Welcome to New York, buddy!<p></p>

<p>Another stressed out straphanger&#x2014;a 23-year-old Williamsburg resident&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160305013335/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/sub_wait_woe_as_weekend_repairs_ZwQP1ZMFXl8BRAWghBhFaJ">told the Post</a>, &quot;<strong>The MTA just sucks</strong>. I was late for my class this morning because of a delay I didn&apos;t know about.&quot;  But a Queens resident who had paid attention to the many signs warning of issues said to WCBS 2, &quot;It just meant I had to leave the house earlier this morning. Now I have to walk six blocks out of my way, and hopefully get out at the stop I need in the Village - unless something is screwed up down there.&quot; </p>

<p>Here are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160305013335/http://tripplanner.mta.info/NewTP/serviceAdvisories/routeStatusResult.aspx?tag=ALL&amp;date=10/11/2009&amp;time=">today&apos;s subway diversions</a>&#x2014;luckily, it looks nice outside, so maybe it&apos;s time to stroll a bit too.  </p>
