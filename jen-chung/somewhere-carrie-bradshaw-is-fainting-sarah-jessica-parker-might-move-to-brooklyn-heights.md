<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506145141/http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/a-bit-sex-brooklyn-article-1.1050111">According to the Daily News</a>, Parker and &quot;husband Matthew Broderick are closing in on a contract to purchase adjacent townhouses on State St. near Sidney Place in the borough&#x2019;s most expensive neighborhood... When construction is completed, the combined home would create an urban mansion of approximately 7,000-plus square feet with a suburban-size backyard &#x2014; perfect for the family&#x2019;s growing children, son James Wilkie, 9, and twin daughters Marion and Tabitha, almost 3.&quot; </p>

<p>A source says, &quot;They loved the West Village but wanted something more private, laid-back and discreet.&quot;  Another interesting fact: Apparently it would be an &quot;off-market&quot; transaction because the &quot;houses weren&#x2019;t officially for sale.&quot;</p>

<p>Even though Parker&apos;s roots are humble (she has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506145141/http://www.nytimes.com/2000/07/30/business/talking-money-with-sarah-jessica-parker-start-welfare-riches-city.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm">said her family was on welfare while growing up in Ohio</a>), we can&apos;t help but remember when Miranda bought a townhouse in Brooklyn and Carrie Bradshaw voiced over, &quot;It was clear Miranda&apos;s life as we knew it was over.&quot;  Then, after Samantha bitches about the move, Miranda says with disgust, &quot;<strong>Brooklyn. I can&apos;t even say it, let alone live in it.</strong>&quot;</p>
