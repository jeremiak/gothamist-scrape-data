The city medical examiner determined Monday that the bone chips were not human, but more tests were being done on a ziplock bag full of dust.&quot;  Rosa Cerrato, who was cleaning out the van so it could be donated, was relieved the bones were not human, &quot;Thank God it&apos;s not somebody&apos;s relative.&quot;</p>
