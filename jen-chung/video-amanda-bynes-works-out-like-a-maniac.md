<p>Amanda Bynes, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717103753/http://laist.com/tags/amandabynes">teen star</a> who has seemingly been on a sad spiral, is in New York, Tweeting <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717103753/http://laist.com/2013/05/02/amanda_bynes_tweets_topless_photos.php">photos of herself wearing a bra</a> and talking about how she needs to lose 35 pounds to weigh 100 pounds. Jenny McCarthy, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717103753/http://chicagoist.com/2009/05/05/jenny_mccarthy_gets_oprah-cized.php">anti-vaccine crusader</a>, claimed the NYPD <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717103753/http://www.buzzfeed.com/tommywes/amanda-bynes-supposedly-got-a-visit-from-the-nypd-last-night">had visited a suicidal Bynes on Wednesday night</a>, but NYPD spokesman Paul freaking Browne told a gossip website that wasn&apos;t the case.</p>

<p>Browne <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717103753/http://www.hollyscoop.com/amanda-bynes/nypd-we-never-got-call-about-amanda-bynes.html">told Hollyscoop</a>, &quot;There is no 911 call to the apartment of Amanda Bynes and there is no police record of any of our officers having to go there. Even if a neighbor called the police directly there would be a record of it, as we have to make a note of everything any of our officers do and respond to, and there is absolutely no record of this.&quot; So this is good to know: Given Browne&apos;s (and NYPD DCPI&apos;s) track record of not responding to our emails/requests for information, we&apos;ll be sure to work in an Amanda Bynes angle in our next request for comment!</p>

<p>Anyway, here&apos;s a video of Bynes working out like a maniac:</p>
