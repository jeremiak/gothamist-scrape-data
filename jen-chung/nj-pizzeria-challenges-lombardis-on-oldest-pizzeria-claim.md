<p>It&apos;s a pizzeria showdown between a beloved NYC joint that started selling pizzas in 1905 and an upstart in Trenton, NJ that started its pizza business in 1912:  The Garden State&apos;s Papa Tomato&apos;s Pies says<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429201417/http://www.nj.com/entertainment/dining/index.ssf/2011/07/nations_oldest_pizzeria_in_tre.html"> it&apos;s the oldest pizzeria in the country</a> because Lombardi&apos;s shut its business for ten years.  Oh, it&apos;s on!</p>

<p>Papa Tomato&apos;s owner Nick Azzaro <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429201417/http://www.nj.com/entertainment/dining/index.ssf/2011/07/nations_oldest_pizzeria_in_tre.html">tells the Star-Ledger</a>, &quot;On [the Lombardi&apos;s]  website, they claim they were closed for ten years between 1977 and 1987. They&apos;re not really the oldest pizza restaurant.&apos;&apos; The Star-Ledger notes, &quot;Actually, Lombardi&apos;s, which opened as a grocery store in 1897 and started selling pizza in 1905, was closed between 1984 and 1994, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429201417/http://firstpizza.com/">according to its website</a>.&quot;</p>

<p>Diner&apos;s Journal weighed in, &quot;Ed Levine wrote [in his book Pizza, a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429201417/http://www.amazon.com/Pizza-Slice-Heaven-Ultimate-Companion/dp/0789312050">Slice of Heaven</a>]  that Papa&#x2019;s was the third pizzeria in the country, after Lombardi&#x2019;s and the late Joe&#x2019;s Tomato Pies, also in Trenton. If you consider the present Lombardi&#x2019;s as a newcomer, Papa&#x2019;s is the last standing of that triumvirate, and thus the oldest pizzeria in the country. Mr. Levine, by the way, awarded it three pies on a four-pie scale.&quot;</p>

<p>FWIW, Lombardi&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429201417/http://gothamist.com/2005/11/10/lombardis_pizza.php">celebrated its 100th birthday</a> with 5-cent pies in 2005... which means Papa&apos;s better be serving 12-cent pies next year!</p>
