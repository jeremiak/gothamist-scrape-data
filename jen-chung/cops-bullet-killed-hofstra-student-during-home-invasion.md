<p>The Nassau County police confirmed that one of its officers fired the bullet that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424164405/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/18/hofstra_junior_andrea_rebello_kille.php">killed Hofstra University junior Andrea Rebello</a> during a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424164405/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/17/hofstra_student_killed_in_home_inva.php">home invasion</a> early Friday morning in Uniondale. Nassau County police Commissioner Thomas Dale personally informed Rebello&apos;s parents at their Tarrytown home, wishing them his &quot;most sincere and heartfelt condolences,&quot; before making the announcement at a press conference.</p>

<p>Nassau County Homicide squad Lieutenant John Azzata said that Rebello, 21, had been used as a human shield by ex-con Dalton Smith, with her head in a headlock. Smith, 30, was dragging Rebello out of the house and apparently motioned that he was going to shoot the officers who responded. Smith also allegedly said, &#x201C;I&#x2019;m going to kill her.&quot; </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424164405/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2013/05/19/sad-graduation-day-at-hofstra-following-students-death-in-home-invasion/">Azzata said</a>, &quot; [Smith] points his gun at our police officer and at that point [the officer] fires the guns&#x2014;eight rounds. Seven of those rounds struck our subject. One of the rounds struck our victim.&quot; Both Smith and Rebello died.</p>

<p>Rebello; her twin sister Jessica; her sister&apos;s boyfriend, John Kourtessis; and their friend Shannon Thomas had just returned home. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424164405/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/hofstra-gunman-identified-thug-wanted-parole-violation-article-1.1347916">According to the Daily News</a>, &quot;they left the door open so the boyfriend could quickly go outside to move his car and avoid a parking ticket. Smith, clad in black and wearing a ski mask, saw the open door and burst inside the two-story home at 213 California Ave. at around 2:20 a.m.</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right"> <img alt="2013_05_daltonsmith.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424164405im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2013_05_daltonsmith.jpg" width="250" height="289"> <br> <i style=" width:250px; ;display:block"> An undated photograph of Dalton Smith</i></div> Azzata added, &quot;It appears to be a crime of opportunity... [Smith] was walking the neighborhood and saw the door open and thought there was an opportunity to go in.&quot; Smith apparently told the three women to go to the couch. Kourtessis came back in and was made to join them. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424164405/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/in_clutches_of_hofstra_fiend_rjnoueHdwcsuLrLvFTDjYN?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Local">Kourtessis spoke to the Post</a>, explaining that Smith was waving his gun at them, demanding money more money after the woman offered him the computers and jewelry in the house: <blockquote>The crook asked who had money in the bank. Shannon said she could get $700 from an ATM. Smith told her to go get it.<p></p>

<p>Shannon ran from the house, drove off and called 911.</p>

<p>Moments later, in the house, Andrea, Jessica and John heard a noise outside. Thinking Shannon had returned, Jessica went to the door. Instead, Jessica found police officers &#x2014; so she ran to safety.</p>

<p>Realizing the police had arrived, Smith reacted wildly.</p>

<p>&#x201C;I can&#x2019;t go back to jail! One of you, get over here,&#x201D; Smith said, according to Kourtessis&#x2019; account.</p>

<p>&#x201C;So I get up and come over and he puts me down with the gun to the back of my head,&#x201D; Kourtessis said. &#x201C;He said, &#x2018;Show them your hands and tell the cops to get out of there.&#x2019; Then he does the same to Andrea.&#x201D;</p></blockquote>At this point, the police had entered the house. An officer saw Kourtessis with Smith and then took cover. Kourtessis then ran down the stairs and behind a couch in the living room, yelling, &quot;The police are here.&quot; Smith then put Rebello in a headlock while coming downstairs. <p></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424164405/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/19/nyregion/suspect-in-hofstra-home-invasion-had-extensive-criminal-record.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">Hofstra students told the NY Times</a> that while the school&apos;s campus was safe, the street where Rebello lived, just south of campus, seemed less secure. One said, &quot;Walking after class after 7 p.m. or 9 p.m., it feels really unsafe to walk outside of campus across Hempstead Turnpike. If you walk around California Avenue and the streets around them, there are streets there that don&apos;t have street lamps.&quot;</p>

<p>The school&apos;s commencement ceremonies <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424164405/http://www.newsday.com/long-island/education/colleges/slain-hofstra-student-honored-at-commencement-1.5292803">were held today</a>; a moment of silence was observed for Rebello. Her funeral will be held <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424164405/http://www.lohud.com/viewart/20130518/NEWS02/305180038/Authorities-Cop-shot-Hofstra-student-woman-held-by-intruder">on Wednesday</a>.</p>
