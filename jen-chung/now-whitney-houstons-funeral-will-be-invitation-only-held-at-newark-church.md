Houston will not be buried in Newark, she said.&quot; The Star-Ledger believes that the plans changed late last night. The Prudential Center would have been able to hold almost 20,000 people, while the New Hope church holds about 300.  Additionally, &quot;Houston&apos;s body was brought to Whigham late Monday night as fans crowded Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard to catch a glimpse. The crowd of around 40 sang songs and applauded.&quot;</p>
