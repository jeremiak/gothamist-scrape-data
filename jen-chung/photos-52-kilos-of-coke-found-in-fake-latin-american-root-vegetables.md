<p>A man who lived across the street from a Bronx elementary school&#x2014;and close to two other public schools&#x2014;was arrested on Wednesday after investigators allegedly found 52 kilograms of cocaine &quot;concealed in fake Latin American root vegetables&quot; in his home, the Department of Justice announced. </p>

<p>The bust happened midday on July 6th, when DEA agents and a team from the Office of the Special Narcotics Prosecutor were conducting an ongoing heroin investigation near East 172nd Street and Stratford Avenue. From the DEA:</p><blockquote>At approximately 12:50 p.m., members of DEA Group D-43 observed a man carrying a black backpack, later identified as Francisco Ramirez, walk to the vehicle and unlock the door.  Agents and investigators approached Ramirez, observed suspicious activity, and talked to him. They subsequently conducted a search of his person and the vehicle. <p></p>

<p>Inside the backpack, agents and investigators found $100,000 cash wrapped in bundles. Ramirez also had eight glassine envelopes of heroin, five baggies of cocaine, 19 zips of crack cocaine, and a bag of marijuana in his pocket. A second backpack found in the trunk of the vehicle contained eight plastic yuccas, which New York State Police K-9 Lexy alerted to the presence of narcotics. </p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>When the investigators, joined by the NYPD&apos;s Bronx Narcotics team and Lexy the K-9, searched Ramirez&apos;s apartment at 1264 Manor Avenue an hour later, they allegedly discovered &quot;four large industrial sized laundry bags containing 96 fake hollowed out plastic yuccas,&quot; and a field test showed the yuccas had cocaine. Further, &quot;an excess of 500 grams of heroin, 20 grams of cocaine, a money counter, a scale, $225,000 in cash, empty vials and packaging materials in the apartment&quot; were found.</p>

<p>&quot;The extent that drug traffickers will go to make a profit from the sale of poison ceases to amaze me,&quot; DEA Special Agent in Charge James J. Hunt. &quot;For example, DEA has seized drugs concealed in random items such as chess pieces, tombstones, lollipops and live puppies.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016012222/https://www.dea.gov/pubs/pressrel/pr020106.html">Yes, puppies</a>!</p>

<p>Francisco Ramirez, 46, was charged with criminal possession of a controlled substance. </p>

<p>A neighbor <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016012222/http://abc7ny.com/news/police-find-cocaine-hidden-in-yucca-across-from-bronx-school/1417965/">who lives across the street was disgusted</a>, &quot;I saw the commotion, all the police cars. You would never think that, especially near a school. He shouldn&apos;t be doing that. Our kids come first.&quot;</p>
