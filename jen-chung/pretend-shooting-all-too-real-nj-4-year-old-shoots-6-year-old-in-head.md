Apparently the four-year-old <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130513141313/http://www.nj.com/ocean/index.ssf/2013/04/kids_may_have_been_pretend_shooting_when_one_was_shot_in_head.html#incart_m-rpt-1">took out the weapon for some &quot;pretend shooting.&quot;</a> The victim&apos;s father <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130513141313/http://www.nj.com/ocean/index.ssf/2013/04/kids_may_have_been_pretend_shooting_when_one_was_shot_in_head.html#incart_m-rpt-1">told the Star-Ledger</a>, &quot;It&apos;s not good.&quot;<p></p>

<p>The incident occurred yesterday at 6:30 p.m. in Toms River, NJ.  The younger boy took the rifle into his backyard. A neighbor told the Star-Ledger that &quot;he fired once from 15 yards away, striking Brandon [Holt] in the head. The older boy was sitting in a go-kart at the time, said Toms River Police Chief Michael Mastronardy at a press conference with Ocean County Prosecutor Joseph Coronato. While the 6 year old lies in critical condition at an area hospital, detectives continue their investigation, which included seizing a collection of guns from the 4-year-old&apos;s home, said another neighbor.&quot;</p>

<p>Little Brandon&apos;s uncle says that bullet went through the boy&apos;s head&#x2014;it&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130513141313/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Boy-Shot-Head-Neighbor-Toms-River-New-Jersey-Rifle-202085271.html">apparently lodged in his brain</a>. It&apos;s unclear if anyone will be charged.</p>

<p>Another neighbor <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130513141313/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local/new_jersey&amp;id=9057965">told WABC 7</a>, &quot;I&apos;m sad for the children involved and their families, but I&apos;m angry with whoever owns that gun and allowed a little child to get hold of it. A 4-year-old can&apos;t load a gun.&quot;<br>
