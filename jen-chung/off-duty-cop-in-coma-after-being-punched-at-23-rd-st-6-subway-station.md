<p>Apparently the off-duty detective, a 6-year veteran of the NYPD, and/or his companion may have gotten into an altercation with the attacker. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510015749/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/punched-train-platform-coma-head-injury-authorities-article-1.1864789">According to the Daily News</a>, &quot;he got into an argument with an unidentified man standing with two women,&quot; while <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510015749/http://nypost.com/2014/07/13/nypd-detective-in-coma-after-subway-platform-assault/">the Post reports</a>:</p><blockquote>The detective had been standing on the southbound platform with his cousin at around 6:30 p.m. when the cousin began &#x201C;bothering&#x201D; a panhandler &#x2014; and the suspect interceded by punching the detective in the head, law enforcement sources told The Post.<p></p>

<p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s not f&#x2014;ing right,&#x201D; the suspect shouted before striking and running off with his two female companions.</p></blockquote>The police are seeking the suspect, who is described as a Black male, early 40s, approximately 5&apos;9&quot;, and 200 lbs.
