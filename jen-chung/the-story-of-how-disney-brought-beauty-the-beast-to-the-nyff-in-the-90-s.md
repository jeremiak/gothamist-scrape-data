<p>Keeping its <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021110121/http://gothamist.com/2015/08/06/whit_stillmans_metropolitan_celebra.php">tradition of </a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021110121/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/11/dazed_and_confused_cast_richard_lin.php">anniversary screenings</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021110121/http://gothamist.com/2014/08/26/up_to_eleven_this_is_spinal_tap_wil.php">of beloved films</a>, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021110121/https://www.filmlinc.org/daily/25th-anniversary-screening-beauty-and-the-beast/">Film Society of Lincoln Center</a> will show Disney&apos;s 1991 critically acclaimed blockbuster <em>Beauty and the Beast</em> next month. To make the evening even more special, the original cast members will be there: Robby Benson (the Beast); Paige O&apos;Hara (Belle); and Richard White (Gaston); and the one and only Angela Lansbury, a.k.a. Mrs. Potts. </p>

<p>The animated film actually premiered as a &quot;work in progress&quot; 25 years ago at the New York Film Festival&#x2014;a third of the film was, the Film Society says, &quot;storyboard art and black-and-white animation tests&quot; at the festival. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021110121/http://www.nytimes.com/1992/01/19/movies/film-what-hollywood-got-for-christmas.html">The NY Times reported</a> at the time that Disney decided to take a chance by showing it at the more arthouse/world cinema-oriented festival&#x2014;a Disney executive recalled, &quot;There was a lot of gulping here. It was a risky but interesting idea to show it before that audience. We knew no one would hate the film. The worst they could say was, &quot;O.K., it&apos;s an animated film; why is it here?&apos;&quot; </p>

<p>The NYFF crowd gave a standing ovation, and the film went on to become the first animated motion picture to be nominated for a Best Picture Oscar (the other nominees that year were <em>Bugsy</em>, <em>JFK</em>, <em>The Prince of Tides</em> and, the winner, <em>The Silence of the Lambs</em>). It solidified Disney&apos;s return as an animation powerhouse (<em>Aladdin</em>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021110121/https://disneytheory.com/2014/10/05/aladdin-is-set-in-a-distant-post-apocalyptic-future-and-other-theories/">possibly foreshadowed by Belle</a>, was released in 1992; <em>The Lion King</em> in 1994) and also launched Disney&apos;s takeover of Broadway and Times Square, as <em>Beauty and the Beast</em> was the first film to be adapted into musical.</p>

<p>It&apos;s also argued that, relatively speaking, Belle was Disney&apos;s first attempt to remove its female heroines from the princess mold; screenwriter Linda Woolverton fought to make her less passive. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021110121/http://time.com/4344654/beauty-and-the-beast-linda-woolverton/">From Time</a>:</p><blockquote>In one scene, for example, Woolverton wrote Belle sticking pins into a map of all the places she wished to travel. By the time it got to storyboarding, Belle had been rewritten into a kitchen, decorating a cake. Woolverton protested, and the compromise that was reached had Belle with her nose in a book, a pastime at first considered too passive to be compellingly animated, which is why she always walks as she reads.</blockquote>One of Belle&apos;s main characteristics, though, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021110121/http://www.btchflcks.com/2016/08/how-feminist-is-beauty-and-the-beast.html#.V7R0jZMrIxg">is still her exceptional physical appearance</a>, and the romance itself might be characterized by others as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021110121/http://www.moviefone.com/2012/01/18/beauty-and-the-beast-3d/">&quot;Stockholm Syndrome.&quot;</a> <p></p>

<p>Disney is preparing for a big <em>Beauty and the Beast</em> push: It will <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021110121/http://movies.disney.com/beauty-and-the-beast">finally be available digitally on September 6</a>, and<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021110121/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c38r-SAnTWM"> its live action version</a>&#x2014;directed by Kenneth Branagh and starring avowed feminist Emma Watson as Belle; Cousin Matthew Crawley portrayer Dan Stevens as as the Beast; and Ewan McGregor taking over Jerry Orbach&apos;s Lumiere role&#x2014;will be released March 2017. <br>
 <br>
The film will screen on Sunday, September 18th. Tickets are $20 and on sale now at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021110121/http://filmlinc.org/">filmlinc.org</a>&#x2014;the catch is that the event is only available for Film Society members and patrons (<a href="filmlinc.org/membership">details</a>).</p>
