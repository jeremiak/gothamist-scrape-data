The Perry Avenue Building, which underwent a $25 million renovation, features the city&apos;s first wind turbines  mounted on a roof; remember when Bloomberg <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161229054755/http://gothamist.com/2008/08/20/mayor_bloomberg_goes_chasing_windmi.php">broached the idea of harnessing wind power</a> last year?</p>

<p>The 89,000 square-foot structure has rooftop solar panels, and along with the turbines, they will provide power to about 10% of the building. The city&apos;s press release also states the Perry Avenue Building has &quot;reflective roofing and pavement to reduce surface temperatures, the use of recycled rain water in toilets, recycled building materials, high-efficiency lighting fixtures, natural ventilation systems and special accommodation for bicyclists and low-emission vehicles.&quot; </p>

<p>Surround Art, the art services company who is leasing the building from the city, will lease space to artists, is paying a little bit of a premium for having a green home&#x2014;Surround Art CEO Mick Murray <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161229054755/http://fort-greene.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/04/09/from-navy-blue-to-green/">told The Local</a> &quot;he was paying $20 per square foot in the new building &#x2014; nearly triple his $6-a-foot rent in his other Navy Yard space, about double the $11-a-foot going rate for his kind of industrial space and 15 percent above the rate for new industrial space.&quot;  Murray said it was worth it, &quot;It makes a really big statement to our industry.&quot;</p>

<p>The city also announced plans for other projects at the Navy Yard, including the Duggal Greenhouse, which involves turning a one-story 30,000 square-foot building into &quot;a 60,000-square-foot LEED Platinum certified facility that will be used to manufacture eco-friendly products and will become a laboratory for new sustainable products,&quot; and ultimately hopes that 1,700 jobs will be created.</p>
