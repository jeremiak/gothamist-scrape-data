<p>One of the constants in our and many tri-state area residents&apos; lives will change after tomorrow: Sue Simmons, the irrepressible WNBC 4 anchor, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427162500/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/04/sue_simmonss_final_channel_4_newsca.php">will close out her 32-year career at the station</a>.  </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427162500/http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/television/tube-wnbc-salute-sue-simmons-day-long-reports-friday-article-1.1095066?localLinksEnabled=false">According to the Daily News</a>, &quot;The station looks back with on-air tributes starting on &#x201C;Today in New York&#x201D; and continuing on all newscasts at noon, 5 and 6 p.m.  There will be highlights from her career and interviews with current and former colleagues and well-known New Yorkers.
