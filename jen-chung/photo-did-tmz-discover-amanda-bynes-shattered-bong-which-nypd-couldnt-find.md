	<p>Last Thursday, Amanda Bynes was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717103258/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/23/amanda_bynes_arrested_in_midtown_fo.php">arrested for allegedly throwing a bong</a> out of her 36th floor apartment window in Midtown. However, police couldn&apos;t find the bong, leading the troubled starlet to insist <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717103258/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/25/_view_more_videos_at.php#photo-1">she&apos;s never had a bong</a> and that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717103258/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/27/amanda_bynes_is_suing_the_nypd_you.php">she was suing the NYPD</a> because they arrested her for no reason. But now TMZ thinks they have found the mysterious bong. Take a look:</p>

Some of the pieces of glass had what appeared to be black residue.&quot; </p>

<p>Further, &quot;A building employee told our producer cops didn&apos;t check the sub-roof during their investigation.  We were told cops would check it out later today.  Cops just arrived at the scene.&quot; The building is the Biltmore, on West 47th Street.</p>

<p>Bynes, who was also charged with marijuana possession and tampering with evidence, has claimed that what she threw out of the window was a vase. The police had been called to her apartment because the building&apos;s management complained that she was smoking pot in the lobby. She was taken to a hospital for a psych evaluation before being charged. </p>

<p>A judge <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717103258/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/24/amanda_bynes_heads_to_court_to_face.php">released Bynes on her own recognizance</a> last Friday, leaving the starlet to Tweet about the cops <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717103258/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/25/amanda_bynes_claims_nypd_officer_se.php">allegedly slapping her vagina</a> and how <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717103258/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/27/amanda_bynes_is_suing_the_nypd_you.php">she&apos;ll become a rapper next</a>. </p>
