<p>A cat owner says her 9-year-old tabby is a &quot;miracle cat&quot; after the cat fell 12 stories from an apartment on West End Avenue.  Andrea Lang <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130414120526/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/cat_mee_owch_hcBkWUN2wJomZEbkmted7M">told the NY Post</a> that the vets were shocked at Copper the cat&apos;s recovery, &quot;It&apos;s just remarkable. They said they didn&apos;t think she would make it... They actually suggested we put her down. But I said, &apos;Let&apos;s give it 24 hours.&apos;&quot;  And how did Copper fall?  Well, the fearless feline ventured through a 3-inch gap from an open window at Lang&apos;s 14th floor apartment and apparently fell onto the roof of a neighboring garage.</p>

<p>Lang, who has never lived in a high-rise apartment before, explained that she realized Copper was missing when her other cat showed up for a late-night Monday snack, but Copper didn&apos;t.  The Post reports, &quot;After the fall, the injured Copper spent nearly nine hours on the roof of the two-story garage because there was no access and Lang couldn&apos;t get hold of anyone who could help. Finally, the next morning, building service manager Juan Dominguez, 42, was able to help. He said he spotted the cat on the roof from the window of his own apartment, which is 10 floors below Lang&apos;s.&quot;  </p>

<p>Dominguez climbed down and rescued Copper who is fine, aside from the &quot;cast on her back right paw and a medicinal patch on the back left&quot; and a &quot;scar on her face&quot;. </p>
