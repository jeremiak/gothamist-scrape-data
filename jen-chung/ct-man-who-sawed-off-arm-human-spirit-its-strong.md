<p>The 31-year-old West Hartford resident who nearly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130513052842/http://gothamist.com/2010/06/10/ct_man_nearly_cuts_off_arm_to_free.php">sawed off his left arm</a> while trapped in a boiler told reporters that he first screamed for 12 hours while in his basement.  When it became clear no one was coming, Jonathan Metz <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130513052842/http://www.courant.com/community/west-hartford/hc-jonathan-metz-0616,0,939659.story">realized he started to smell his arm rotting</a>, &quot;At that point, I had a decision to make&quot; about cutting his arm off. &quot;I definitely dithered for a few hours after coming up with the initial idea,&quot; he said. &quot;I thought there must be some other way, so I kind of started looking around my surroundings again. Maybe there was something I missed. You know, what would MacGyver do if he were here?&quot;  (Video of his press conference below.)</p>

<p>After describing how he got caught in the boiler (he had been vacuuming it and was retrieving an attachment that fell off), It took himself six hours to &quot;psych&quot; himself up to before Metz went for it.  The Hartford Courant reports, &quot;Using his right arm and his mouth, he made a tourniquet out of his shirt and tied it around his left arm. Then he reached for power tool blades that were lying nearby and started cutting his arm, halfway between his left elbow and shoulder, he said. Metz is right-handed.&quot;  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130513052842/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/man_who_tried_self_amputation_thought_Mb3cFB3tFoXpHlGcvbzktK?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">He said</a>, &quot;I don&apos;t know how many strokes it took. But it was quite a few. So yes, every one, I was re-evaluating in some way, was it too late to stop? Or what was the point where there was no going back?&quot; He also hoped he could cut off his arm, put it in the freezer and have it surgically reattached.   </p>
