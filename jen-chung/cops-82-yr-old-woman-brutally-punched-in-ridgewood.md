<p>The police are hoping the public can help them find a man who allegedly punched an elderly woman in Queens on Thursday.</p>

<p>According to the police, at 6:35 a.m. on September 24, an 82-year-old woman was walking  at the intersection of Myrtle Avenue and Seneca Street in Ridgewood &quot;when the suspect came up behind her, and struck her with a closed fist to the side of her face causing bruising and swelling.&quot; Which sounds a lot like the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170902141601/http://gothamist.com/tags/knockoutgame">so-called knockout attacks</a>. </p>

<p>Police describe the suspect as being approximately 25 - 30 years-old and 5&apos;7&quot; tall and say he was wearing blue jeans and a black T-shirt with a design in white. Here&apos;s video of the suspect punching some fabrics hanging on the street:</p>
