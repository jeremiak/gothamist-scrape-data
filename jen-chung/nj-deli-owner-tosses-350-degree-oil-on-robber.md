<p>A NJ deli owner dealt with his first robbery this way: By throwing a pot of oil on the robber. The owner of Cos&apos;s Corner Deli <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928013449/http://www.nj.com/union/index.ssf/2013/08/linden_deli_owner_who_threw_hot_oil_on_robber_thats_my_hard-earned_money.html#incart_river">in Linden, NJ told the Star-Ledger</a>, &quot;I couldn&#x2019;t just stand here and watch him take my money. We don&#x2019;t rob people to make money. We work 12 to 15 hours a day to put bread on the table.&quot;</p>

<p>The incident occurred yesterday just after 2 p.m., when a man wearing a blue winter coat entered the deli and pointed a gun at the owner. The Star-Ledger reports, &quot;The owner retreated to the back while the man tried to open the cash register. Then, as the thief was preoccupied with the register, the owner grabbed a pot of hot oil next to the deep fryer and hurled it on the perpetrator.&quot; The owner said, &quot;It&apos;s like 350 degrees. I think that got him, <strong>he felt the heat, that&apos;s when he ran away.&quot;</strong></p>

<p>The police are reviewing surveillance footage and will be alerting area hospitals, in case the suspect sought medical attention for possible burns.</p>
