<p>You know how the city pushed the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151121122055/http://gothamist.com/tags/hudsonyards">Hudson Yards</a> mega-development plan, saying it would be good because it would, besides creating retail, commercial and residential space, bring in tons of construction jobs? Well, now it turns out that Related, the development company who is building it all (including a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151121122055/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/01/theyre_really_going_through_with_th.ph">51-story skyscraper</a>), has hired a huge California firm as the main contractor.  As the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151121122055/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/business/calif_carpetbagger_corrals_hudson_uooSa4YxUz19c2IcBEMCUK?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">Post reports</a> from a Crain&apos;s article, &quot;An outfit the size of Tutor Perini doesn&#x2019;t need to subcontract work to third parties because it owns companies that can perform tasks such as concrete placement and electrical work, while local developers have to outsource the business.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151121122055/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/california-company-build-hudson-yards-project-article-1.1006706?localLinksEnabled=false">Apparently Related wanted to keep costs down</a> and going with city contractors and unions, which had negotiated last year, would have made that difficult.  &#x201C;I think it&#x2019;s an aggressive move,&#x201D; Steven Spinola, president of the Real Estate Board of New York, told Crain&#x2019;s. &#x201C;Bringing another significant company like this into the city is positive for competition.&#x201D;</p>

<p>A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151121122055/http://www.related.com/ourcompany/press/105/MAYOR-BLOOMBERG-ANNOUNCES-MAJOR-PROGRESS-AT-HUDSON-YARDS-&amp;">press release from Related said</a> last year, &quot;Over 20,000 construction jobs will be generated by the construction of the Coach Building. Over 100,000 construction jobs will be generated by development of the Eastern Railyard (including over 80,000 direct jobs) and over 10,000 permanent new jobs will be generated upon completion of both yards, which will also serve as home to 30,000 office workers.&quot; <br>
