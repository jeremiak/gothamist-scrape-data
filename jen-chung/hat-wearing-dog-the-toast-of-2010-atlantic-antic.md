</div></div>					<p>Yesterday thousands of people flocked to Boerum Hill for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160210005610/http://www.atlanticave.org/antic2010/index.htm">Atlantic Antic</a>, the event that offers an &quot;only in Brooklyn&quot; mix of food (mmm, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160210005610/http://66squarefeet.blogspot.com/2010/09/atlantic-antic-la-mancha-sardines.html">sardines</a>), crafts, activities (the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160210005610/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/26/old_buses_take_to_nyc_streets_today.php">bus festival</a>!), music and more.

<p>There was also some dancing:</p>
