title: New Beatrice Inn Will Be Cozy, With No Smoking Or Paul Sevigny

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="beatriceback1109.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120324203722im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/arts_jen/beatriceback1109.jpg" width="150" height="257" class="image-right"> </span>Vanity Fair editor and restaurateur Graydon Carter spilled some details about the resurrection of the Beatrice Inn, restaurant and once-hot spot (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120324203722/http://gothamist.com/2009/01/28/beatrice_inn.php">before the D-list moved in</a>) that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120324203722/http://gothamist.com/2009/07/27/beatrice.php">closed in 2009</a>.  But it doesn&apos;t seem like Chloe Sevigny has any reason to root for it anymore.</p>

<p>Carter&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120324203722/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/07/get_carter_the_beatrice_inn_returni.php">involvement as a minority owner was revealed late last year</a> and he told the Wall Street Journal that the Bea will reopen in about five weeks, &quot;It&#x2019;s coming back, but it&#x2019;s going to be a different kind of place than what it was last. Whatever it was - and I&#x2019;m too old to have gone there, but my kids went - it won&#x2019;t be that. There will be no Paul Sevigny,&quot; the Sevigny brother and DJ who was one of the previous owners.  </p>

<p>Carter said there will be &quot;a lot of wood and subway tiles - it&#x2019;ll be cozy&quot; but there&apos;s won&apos;t be indoor smoking, which the Beatrice Inn did have: &quot;You can&#x2019;t get a license for that, unfortunately. I probably would if I could.&quot;</p>
