										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2013_06_hatefuljerks.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406152250im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2013_06_hatefuljerks.jpg" width="640" height="434" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>After Sunday&apos;s Pride march, a subway rider on the F encountered two men making homophobic comments and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406152250/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/03/video_two_men_harass_subway_riders.php">filmed their horrible rants against LGBT youth on the train</a>. The men then lashed out at the woman taping them, grabbing her and injuring her in the process. The police are now asking for the public&apos;s help in identifying them.</p>

<p>The NYPD characterizes the incident as an assault, not a hate crime. The victim, who was &quot;left with bruises and scratches,&quot; had said, &quot;I&apos;m having trouble getting the police to recognize the incident as something more than just &apos;harassment&apos; &#x2014; the video depicts several attacks that happened (twice upon me, and once upon the queer woman). It&apos;s really upsetting that the attacks were downplayed to &apos;harassment&apos; in the police report -- I was so specific and detailed about what happened.&quot; </p>

<p>The incident occurred at around 11:30 p.m. on Sunday, June 30. Anyone with information is asked to call Crime Stoppers at (800) 577-TIPS (8477). The public can also submit their tips by logging onto Crime Stoppers&apos; website at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150406152250/http://www.nypdcrimestoppers.com/">www.nypdcrimestoppers.com</a> or by texting their tips to CRIMES (274637), then enter TIP577.<br>
