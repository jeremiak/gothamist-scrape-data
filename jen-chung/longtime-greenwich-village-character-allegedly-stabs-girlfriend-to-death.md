<p>A 69-year-old Greenwich Village man was charged with fatally stabbing his longtime girlfriend in their apartment yesterday. Police say Dennis Gugliemo, a longtime neighborhood fixture, attacked Alice Birnbaum last night.</p>

<p>The NYPD says they responded to a 911 call about a woman stabbed inside 38 Downing Street. When they arrived to the apartment, they found Birnbaum, 59, with multiple stab wounds. Gugliemo allegedly used <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160814013740/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Man-Stabs-Girlfriend-Death-Greenwich-Village-257597151.html">both an axe and a knife in the attack</a>. Birnbaum was pronounced dead at the scene and Gugliemo was taken into custody.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160814013740/http://nypost.com/2014/05/01/fresh-out-of-the-psych-ward-man-arrested-in-girlfriends-death/">The Post reports</a> that Gugliemo had been released from Bellevue&apos;s psychiatric facility recently&#x2014;and that Birnbaum was involved with getting him out: A neighbor said, &quot;Last time I spoke to her she was talking about how she was fighting the doctors trying to get him out of Bellevue. He was released about 2 or 3 days ago.&quot;</p>

<p>Gugliemo founded Carmine Street Guitars nearby (he&apos;s not affiliated with them anymore) and was caught in 2012 using a patio chair to confront teens who were bothering others in the Village. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160814013740/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/chair-man-block-article-1.1150908">From the Daily News</a> (which has photos of many teens vs. Gugliemo):</p><blockquote>They were just causing problems,&quot; he later told the News. &quot;They think they can come down to the Village and intimidate people.&quot; Guglielmo fended off the group of teenagers outside the N&#xFA;mero 28 pizzeria.  <p></p>

<p>&quot;They&apos;re not from here,&quot; he said of the boys, adding they demanded money from pedestrians and argued with strangers. &quot;I live on the block,&quot; he went on. &quot;It&apos;s not a big deal.&quot;</p></blockquote><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160814013740/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/02/nyregion/man-arrested-in-fatal-stabbing-of-girlfriend.html?_r=0">According to the NY Times</a>, &quot;Mr. Guglielmo was often seen sunning himself and sometimes drinking in front of a local church. Several residents, when interviewed about Mr. Guglielmo, described him as &apos;a character.&apos; They asked not to be identified because they feared his brother, who also lives at 38 Downing.&quot;<p></p>

<p>Gugliemo was charged with murder in the second degree and criminal possession of a weapon.</p>
