<p>A gay man walking in the Bronx on Sunday was stabbed by two strangers yelling anti-gay slurs. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021134617/http://abc7ny.com/news/exclusive-man-stabbed-in-apparent-bias-attack-in-bronx/1424601/">The victim tells ABC 7</a>, &quot;I felt the blade, and when I felt the blade I stood still and I just looked at him.&quot;</p>

<p>The assault took place on July 10th, around 3:30 a.m., near Sunset Boulevard and Neptune Lane in Soundview. The victim, Marquis Devereaux, 49, said he was walking towards his home when two men started yelling &quot;homophobic slurs&quot; at him. </p>

<p>One of the suspects stabbed his left arm; Devereaux, who was treated at Montefiore hospital, said, &quot;What I felt was heat and what I felt was a sharp pain. And all I was telling myself was stay calm, stay alert.&quot;</p>

<p>Police released surveillance footage of the suspects; one was last seen wearing a light colored tank top and light colored pants while the other was last seen wearing a hooded sweater and shorts.</p>

<p>Recent events prompted Devereaux, who says he&apos;s been previously attacked for his sexuality, to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161021134617/http://abc7ny.com/news/exclusive-man-stabbed-in-apparent-bias-attack-in-bronx/1424601/">come forward about being attacked</a>: &quot;Situations like Dallas go through your head and you just think, in this case it&apos;s two black guys that have attacked each other and maybe the fact that I&apos;m gay won&apos;t matter.&quot;</p>
