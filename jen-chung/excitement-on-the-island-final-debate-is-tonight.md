<p>Tonight, the final presidential debate between John McCain and Barack Obama will be held at Hofstra University in Hempstead, Long Island--here&apos;s the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111109023137/http://www.hofstra.edu/debate/">Debate &apos;08 site</a>.  And you know that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111109023137/http://www.newsday.com/news/local/wire/newyork/ny-bc-ny--debate-traffic1015oct15,0,3155056.story">traffic will be a nightmare</a>.<br>

One student said there&apos;s a lot of enthusiasm among classmates,  &#x201C;I&#x2019;ve noticed a level of engagement in classes I haven&#x2019;t seen before this semester.

Hofstra president Stuart Rabinowitz said, &quot;It is amazing. I mean there are going to be 3,100 journalists here, live telecast back to Ireland, Japan, Singapore.&quot;</p>

And for those of you hoping for a better debate, moderator Bob Schieffer of CBS News has indicated he&apos;ll hold the candidates <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111109023137/http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1008/14570.html">accountable if they don&apos;t answer the questions</a>.</p>
