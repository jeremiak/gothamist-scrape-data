<p>Yesterday afternoon, a woman died after jumping off a Staten Island-bound Staten Island Ferry boat and into the New York Harbor.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429203952/http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2010/10/water_rescue_in_new_york_harbo.html">According to the Staten Island Advance</a>, &quot;The unidentified Hispanic woman, who was in her 30s, was pulled unconscious out of the water by two ferry deckhands who were lowered in a rescue boat launched off the ferry. The deckhands then handed the woman off to the crew of an NYPD rescue craft, which rushed her to South Cove Marina in Manhattan, where she was taken to&quot; Beekman Downtown Hospital, where she was pronounced dead at 5:42 p.m.</p>

<p>Witness Joe Romano tells us, &quot;The boats from both directions stopped and police boats and at least one water taxi were searching the water, too. A helicopter is also flying over.&quot;  Another ferry passenger told the Advance that help arrived quickly.  Last month, an East Village woman was rescued after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429203952/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/12/harbor_cops_rescue_suicidal_staten.php">jumping off the ferry</a>.  </p>
