<p>Jerry Seinfeld&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430035029/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/12/video_has_jerry_seinfeld_finally_ma.php">web series about nothing</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430035029/http://comediansincarsgettingcoffee.com/">Comedians In Cars Getting Coffee</a>, has featured many of his fellow famous funny men (and women), like Larry David, Ricky Gervais, Sarah Silverman and David Letterman. But the season 2 finale, with Chris Rock, features a brush with the law!</p>

<p>In this episode&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430035029/http://comediansincarsgettingcoffee.com/chris-rock-kids-need-bullying">watch it here</a>&#x2014;car fanatic Seinfeld (he has a fancy car temple/garage <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430035029/http://www.thesmokinggun.com/documents/crime/seinfelds-automotive-money-pit">on West 83rd Street</a>) takes a 1969 Lamborghini Miura P400S for a spin and picks up Rock at Rock&apos;s Alpine, NJ home. Rock greets Jerry with, &quot;This is my Tony Soprano house.&quot;</p>

<p>As they drive on what the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430035029/http://www.nj.com/bergen/index.ssf/2013/07/jerry_seinfeld_and_chris_rock_got_pulled_over_in_ramsey_and_it_was_hilarious.html#incart_river_default">Star-Ledger surmises</a> to be Route 17 in Ramsey, a cop pulls them over. Rock says to Seinfeld, &quot;Here&apos;s the crazy thing, if you weren&apos;t here, I&apos;d be scared,&quot; &quot;Right now, I&apos;m looking for <em>my</em> license!&quot; (Seinfeld is driving) and &quot;It&apos;d be such a better episode if he pulls me to the side and beats the shit out of me.&quot;</p>

<p>The cop asks Seinfeld where he&apos;s going and they say Alpine. He replies, &quot;Alpine? You&apos;re going the wrong way.&quot; Seinfeld doesn&apos;t help things when he admits it isn&apos;t his car.</p>

<p>Over ten years ago, a study showed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430035029/http://fcnl.org/resources/newsletter/feb01/racial_profiling_the_new_jersey_experience/">rampant racial profiling</a> of NJ drivers and passengers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430035029/http://archives.cnn.com/2002/LAW/03/27/nj.speeding.study/">by its police</a>&#x2014;aka, driving while black. </p>

<p>Rock has also made a point about racial disparity in Alpine:</p>
