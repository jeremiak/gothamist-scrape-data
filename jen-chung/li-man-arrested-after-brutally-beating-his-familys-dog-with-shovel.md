The dog, an 11-year-old border collie mix named Bella, was euthanized and Michael Gallagher, 56, was arrested later that evening.<p></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161228193233/http://abc7ny.com/news/police-man-beats-dog-with-shovel-while-neighbors-frantically-call-911/1671626/">A neighbor told WABC 7</a>, &quot;My neighbor across the street called me, screaming that she heard the dog being killed.&quot; When she looked outside, she saw Gallagher on the lawn with Bella. &quot;All of sudden, he comes out with this long zip tie,&quot; she said. &quot;And he&apos;s putting it around the dog&apos;s neck. The dog is in the bag,&quot; she recalled. </p><blockquote>&quot;I screamed at him to stop and said, &apos;What are you doing? What are you doing?&apos;&quot; she said. &quot;And he said the dog was sick, and he wanted to put it out of its misery. And I called him a couple of things.&quot;<p></p>

<p>The neighbor opened the bag, cut the zip ties and saw a bad cut on the dog&apos;s head.</p></blockquote><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161228193233/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2016/12/24/dog-beat-with-shovel-levittown/">A neighbor said</a>, &quot;You couldn&#x2019;t even see the tie around its neck because it was that embedded.&quot; Gallagher also allegedly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161228193233/http://www.newsday.com/long-island/crime/levittown-man-accused-of-animal-cruelty-nassau-police-say-1.12801443">slammed a shovel</a> into the dog&apos;s head.<p></p>

<p>He left the neighborhood and neighbors called his family about the incident. His daughter, Kerry Gallagher, said that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161228193233/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/long-island-man-badly-beat-dog-shovel-busted-article-1.2922507">her father had quit drinking six months ago</a>, but started again when one of their other dogs died early in the month, &quot;I think he either just blacked out or something snapped in his head. He&#x2019;s never been violent with the dogs ever before. He loves animals.&quot; </p>

<p>Gallagher, who works as a plumber for the NYC schools, was arrested at a 7-Eleven at 10:30 p.m. He apparently told detectives that he didn&apos;t remember the attack. He has been charged with aggravated cruelty to animals and torturing or injuring animals is being held on $300,000 bond or $150,000 cash, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161228193233/http://www.newsday.com/long-island/nassau/levittown-man-charged-in-dog-s-death-1.12802003">according to Newsday</a>.</p>

<p>Bella, who had been adopted by the family 11 years ago, was euthanized. Gary Rogers of the Nassau County SPCA said, &quot;The vet determined that the wounds were going to be fatal, and to put the animal out of its suffering.&quot;</p>

<p>Kerry Gallagher <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161228193233/http://nypost.com/2016/12/24/heartless-man-arrested-for-brutally-beating-his-dog-with-a-shovel/">said to the Post</a>, &quot;I was able to say goodbye, at least. She was a good dog, she did not deserve that. &#x2026; Something snapped in my dad&#x2019;s head.&quot;</p>
