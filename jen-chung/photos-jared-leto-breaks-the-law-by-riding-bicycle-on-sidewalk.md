<p>When it comes to sidewalk etiquette there is one rule that<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510014325/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/24/photos_bad_bicyclist_jake_gyllenhaa.php#photo-1"> seems to go widely ignored by celebrities in particular</a>: no biking on the sidewalk. The latest A-list offender is Jared Leto.</p>

<p>Yes, the beautifully tressed Oscar winner was spotted bicycling on the sidewalk in SoHo yesterday, blissfully unaware that police actually give <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510014325/http://www.streetsblog.org/2013/07/09/nypd-issues-more-tickets-for-sidewalk-riding-than-speeding-on-local-streets/">more tickets for riding a bike on the sidewalk</a> than speeding in the streets. (And currently, riding on the sidewalk is one of the things the NYPD is looking for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510014325/http://gothamist.com/2014/08/13/nypd_starts_2-week_bicycle_safety_e.php">during its two-week bicyclist crackdown</a>.)  You can read the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510014325/http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/bicyclists/biketips.shtml">regulations here</a>! On the other hand, this is probably part of Leto&apos;s calculated plan to be a rebellious rocker. </p>

<p>So, Jared, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510014325/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/14/there_is_an_epidemic_in_brooklyn_an.php">just get a scooter</a> and terrorize us that way.</p>
