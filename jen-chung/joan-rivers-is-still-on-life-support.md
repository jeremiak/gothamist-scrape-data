<p>Joan Rivers&apos;s daughter Melissa Rivers issued a statement about the legendary comedienne&apos;s condition today. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013953/https://twitter.com/ditzkoff/status/506853409736364032">The younger Rivers said</a>, &quot;On behalf of my mother and our family, we are extremely grateful for all the love and support we&apos;ve received. At this time she does remain on life support. I know my mother would be overwhelmed by the continued outpouring of kindness and I want to thank everyone for keeping us in their prayers.&quot;</p>

<p>Rivers, 81, has been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013953/http://gothamist.com/2014/08/29/joan_rivers_put_in_medically-induce.php">in a medically-induced coma</a> at Mount Sinai Hospital since Thursday night, hours after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013953/http://gothamist.com/2014/08/28/joan_rivers_critical.php">going into cardiac arrest</a> during an endoscopic procedure at a Manhattan clinic. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013953/http://www.eonline.com/news/574976/melissa-rivers-remains-focused-on-joan-rivers-road-to-recovery-is-keeping-everyone-together">A source told E!</a> that Rivers is making some progress, &quot;It&apos;s a slow process, but she&apos;s on the road to recovery. She&apos;s getting better. Don&apos;t believe all this ridiculous speculation.&quot;</p>

<p>The source also said of Melissa Rivers, &quot;She is a rock. She is calmer than I&apos;ve ever seen her. All these reports about doomsday are not true. She is her mother&apos;s daughter and she&apos;s tough as nails. She&apos;s the person keeping everyone together.&quot;</p>

<p>A Daily News source said that the family was going to start the process of trying to take Rivers out of the coma and that they <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013953/http://gothamist.com/2014/09/01/joan_rivers_daughter_says_we_are_ke.php">were considering suing</a> the clinic where Rivers was getting the endoscopy.</p>
