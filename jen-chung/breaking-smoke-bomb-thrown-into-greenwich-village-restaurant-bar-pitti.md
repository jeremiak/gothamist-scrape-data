<p>A truly startling incident occurred at a Greenwich Village restaurant this evening: A man apparently emerged from a sidewalk subway grate to throw a smoke bomb into Bar Pitti&#x2014;and then went back down the grate. It does not appear there were any injuries. </p>

<p>The restaurant is on Sixth Avenue between Houston and Bleecker Streets. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510012809/http://7online.com/news/smoke-bomb-thrown-into-greenwich-village-restaurant/345925/">WABC 7 reports</a>, &quot;The smoke bomb landed on a table.&quot; Actress Rose McGowan was at the restaurant at the time:</p>

<p>One witness, Da Silvano manager Anthony Curko,<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510012809/http://nypost.com/2014/10/10/man-throws-smoke-bomb-into-west-village-restaurant/"> told the Post</a>, &#x201C;I saw him come out &#x2014; it was like Ninja Turtles.&quot; And <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510012809/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2014/10/10/police-man-climbs-out-of-grate-throws-smoke-bombs-in-greenwich-village-restaurant/">another spoke to WCBS 2</a>, &quot;First thought was ISIS with everything going on. It&#x2019;s scary. It&#x2019;s nerve-wracking, as a native Long Islander coming to the city for dinner with friends and family. I&#x2019;m glad I didn&#x2019;t bring my daughter.&quot;</p>
