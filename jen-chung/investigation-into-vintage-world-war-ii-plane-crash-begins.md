<p>The vintage World War II plane, which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161007055903/http://gothamist.com/2016/05/27/wwii_plane_crash_hudson_river.php">crashed into the Hudson River on Friday night</a>, killing its pilot William Gordon, was being inspected this morning at the Wall Street heliport. Gordon&apos;s friends said he was a consummate pilot, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161007055903/http://nypost.com/2016/05/28/he-didnt-mess-up-pals-say-pilots-plane-caused-crash/">with one telling the Post</a>, &quot;Something had to have happened with the plane.&quot;</p>

<p>The plane, a P-47 Thunderbolt, was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161007055903/http://gothamist.com/2016/05/28/wreckage_of_vintage_wwii_plane_lift.php">lifted from the river yesterday</a>, and Gordon had been flying the plane to help promote the American Airpower Museum and Bethpage Air Show. (The plane is property of the museum.) But around 7 p.m., Gordon had some trouble with the plane and made a water landing in the river around West 79th Street&apos;s Boat Basin. A witness told us, &quot;The smoke was coming from the plane, and the plane was hanging down at a steep angle... It just went down.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161007055903/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2016/05/27/hudson-river-plane-crash/">Other witnesses said</a> that it appeared that Gordon, 56, was trying to unstrap himself from his harness but wasn&apos;t able to: &quot;You could see him trying to get out of the harness of whatever&#x2014; whatever he was strapped to, the seatbelt or harness or whatever, but he couldn&#x2019;t get out.&quot;</p>

<p>Gordon&apos;s body was found late Friday night, and the salvage operation for the plane took place yesterday. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161007055903/http://www.newsday.com/news/new-york/william-gordon-pilot-of-wwii-plane-that-crashed-in-hudson-to-be-honored-1.11850926">According to Newsday</a>, the U.S. Coast Guard, the Army Corps of Engineers and NYPD were all involved. Two NYPD divers, Mike Cocchi and Dan Corio, &quot;dove down to the crash site with &apos;zero visibility&apos; to secure a hoist around the front of the plane,&quot; Cocchi said. </p>

<blockquote>Knowing they&#x2019;d have little to no ability to see once below the surface, the men researched details about the plane online in order to feel their way around on a limited oxygen supply, while wary of the unexpected: they didn&#x2019;t know the condition of the airplane, whether there might be sharp objects, protruding wires, or other objects that might entangle the divers.

<p>They decided to wrap the cable around the plane by the engine, where the propellers are, which is the strongest part of the aircraft, he said. Once secure, the apparatus was hoisted into the air by an Army Corps of Engineers vessel.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>The plane will be taken to Delaware for the National Transportation Safety Board investigation. </p>

<p>Yesterday, the Bethpage Air Show paid tribute to Gordon with planes flying in a &quot;missing man&quot; formation. Gordon had been participating in aerobatic plane performances for decades; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161007055903/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/29/nyregion/pilot-in-deadly-hudson-river-crash-is-remembered-as-a-careful-and-dedicated-flier.html">his flying partner told the NY Times</a>, &quot;I knew every move he was going to make, and vice versa... You&#x2019;ve got to have a certain bond with each other, and we had that. We had that.&quot;</p>
