One of Ariel Devonish-Francis&apos; brothers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130610155224/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/bronx/woman-arrested-putting-stillborn-baby-garbage-article-1.1329659">told the Daily News</a> that he had no idea his sister was pregnant or that she was giving birth on Saturday. <p></p>

<p>Clifton Jones said, &quot;She kept constantly going back and forth to the bathroom &#x2014; I thought it was maybe something she ate. If I would have known, things would have been different.&quot;</p>

<p>Another brother, Rafael Francis,<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130610155224/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Body-New-Born-Baby-Found-Bronx-Buildings-Garbage-Room-205130141.html"> told NBC New York</a>, &quot;She must have been in shock,&quot; and that she &quot;wouldn&apos;t hurt a fly.&quot; Also: &quot;He said that while she only announced she was pregnant a few days ago, she had discussed keeping the baby.&quot;</p>

<p>Apparently Devonish-Francis, who was 32 weeks pregnant, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130610155224/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/bronx/bx_baby_dumped_Vs9CXdcVyHXrg3Yr8UkCeL">gave birth to the boy in the bathtub</a>. She later went to the hospital with her mother and admitted she threw the body in the trash. </p>

<p>Devonish-Francis, has been charged with unlawful disposal of a cadaver, a misdemeanor. The ME&apos;s office determined that the baby was stillborn.</p>
