Nikos was &quot;<strong>known for its wide selection of arts and science magazines as well as highbrow journals</strong>&quot; but the space will now make way for a more traditional magazine shop that sells water, soda and Lotto tickets--one devoted customer from Denmark who visits when he&apos;s in NYC said he was &quot;devastated.&quot; Back in March, blog thereisnogap, written by an independent bookseller, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160521062644/http://www.thereisnogap.com/2008/03/some-independent-new-york-bookstores.html">said</a>, the store &quot;has the best collection of literary journals that I&#x2019;ve seen in any of the magazine shops in the city. I picked up issue #68 of the Kyoto Review.&quot;   [<i>Image via thereisnogap</i>]</p>
