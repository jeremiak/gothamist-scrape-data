In a nutshell, the article points out how many LIRR employees apply for disability after retiring...and they end up getting those federal payments.  Back in 2004,<strong> 97% of employees who retired after the age of 50, applied for and received disability</strong>.</p>

<p>The article starts off at the Sunken Meadow golf course, citing how dozens of retired LIRR employees are enjoying the links: &quot;These golfers are considered disabled. At an age when most people still work, <strong>they get a pension and tens of thousands of dollars in annual disability payments &#x2014; a sum roughly equal to the base salary of their old jobs.</strong>&quot;  And these are workers from train operations (conductors, engineers, track workers) and white collar positions (deputy general counsel, claims manager) applying for disability, according to the Times.  </p>

<p>The article also points out how employees&apos; early retirement ends up costing the MTA, because of &quot;overtime, training of replacements and early pension payments.&quot; (All while the MTA is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428182318/http://gothamist.com/2008/03/29/mtas_budget_cri.php">facing serious budget issues</a>.)  Also interesting: How union contracts have various rules that allow some <strong>workers to earn many times their usual daily wage</strong>--one employee whose base salary is usually around $50,000 earned over $250,000 in 2006, and the Times has an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428182318/http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2008/09/19/nyregion/20080920_LIRR_GRAPHIC.html">interactive graphic illustrating how he earned</a> the <em>equivalent of four days pay in one</em>.  </p>
