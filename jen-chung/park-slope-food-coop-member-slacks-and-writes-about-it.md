Yes, Alana Joblin Ain wasn&apos;t able to keep up with the 2.75 hours required every four weeks to keep her as a Food Coop member in good standing, &quot;Flushed, defeated and taken aback &#x2014; I knew I owed the co-op some work, but I didn&#x2019;t know I had been blacklisted &#x2014; I slunk around the corner for a takeout burrito. But no amount of mushrooms and spinach could diminish my shame and guilt.&quot;<p></p>

<p>She also notes the lower prices that the Food Co-op offers&#x2014;&quot;The organic spinach that costs $2.97 at the co-op fetches $3.99 at the Whole Foods in Union Square; 17 ounces of Bionaturae Organic Extra Virgin Olive Oil costs co-op members $7.80 and Whole Foods shoppers $13.99&quot;&#x2014;the &quot;debt&quot; that piles up when one misses a shift&#x2014;&quot;The standard penalty...is two makeup shifts, and those two shifts must be served before your next regular shift, four weeks down the line.&quot;  </p>

<p>But she wonders if the growing membership is making things worse, from poor customer service, to making another (disgraced) member feel like there&apos;s nothing to contribute, &quot;Windexing a spotless fridge or scrubbing a gleaming bathroom felt useless. I&#x2019;d eat off the floor of the co-op bathroom.&quot; </p>
