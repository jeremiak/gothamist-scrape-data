So we wondered: why is Ground Zero still a hole in the ground?&quot; </p>

<p>It&apos;s a good, if depressing, summary of the problems so far: How plans have changed under three different governors and now four executive directors of the Port Authority.  Developer Larry Silverstein says, &quot;I describe this as a national disgrace. I am the most frustrated person in the world,&quot; while current Port Authority executive director Chris Ward explains how one delay can delay everything, &quot;This is like a game of pick-up sticks down here. Every single part of this project touches another piece.&quot; </p>

<p>We also appreciate how New Yorker architecture critic Paul Goldberger chimes in about the revised Freedom Tower design&apos;s concrete bunker, &quot;It was called by the governor the &apos;Freedom Tower.&apos; But I said at one point around then, I wondered if it shouldn&apos;t be called the &apos;Fear Tower&apos; instead.&quot;  Anyway, when asked whether the proposed buildings would be built, Ward would only say, &quot;<strong>What I can tell you is that downtown will come back.</strong>&quot;  </p>

<p>Last week, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408104923/http://www.observer.com/2010/real-estate/bloomberg-port-authority-put-wtc-money-or-&#x2018;just-get-out-way&#x2019;">Mayor Bloomberg criticized</a> the Port Authority for not taking <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408104923/http://gothamist.com/2010/02/19/silverstein_proposes_to_dump_world.php">Silverstein&apos;s financial proposals</a> seriously, &quot;The Port Authority has their constituency, their fiscal responsibility, but it&apos;s time to stop this craziness of everything and we&apos;ve just got to move forward here... I&apos;m not going to leave this world with that hole in the ground 10 years from now. Silverstein&#x2014;we asked him to come up with something, he&apos;s done and the Port Authority, it&apos;s their turn to do this. And I will push as hard as I can&#x2014;they either should do this or just get out of the way.&quot;</p>
