<p>Yes, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170626145146/http://www.orlandoweekly.com/Blogs/archives/2016/11/11/metaphor-alert-two-bald-eagles-got-stuck-in-an-orlando-storm-drain-last-night">two bald eagles stuck in a storm drain </a>were a metaphor alert after the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170626145146/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/09/arrival_of_cheeto_fuhrer.php">presidential election</a>. But here&apos;s a more optimistic metaphor alert: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170626145146/http://gothamist.com/tags/brucespringsteen">Bruce Springsteen</a> was stranded on a New Jersey roadside after his motorcycle broke down&#x2014;and he was rescued by a trio of bikers from the Freehold American Legion. </p>

<p>The Boss&apos;s problems with his Moto Guzzi bike occurred near Allaire State Park in Wall Township on Friday afternoon. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170626145146/http://www.app.com/story/news/local/new-jersey/2016/11/12/bikers-help-springsteen-stranded-side-road/93745436/">Dan Barkalow, 55, said</a>, &quot;I just pulled over and got off the bike and said &apos;Hey, I think I know you.&apos;&quot;</p>

<p>According to the Asbury Park Press, &quot;Barkalow was returning from a Veterans Day event with two fellow members of the Freehold American Legion, Bob Grigs and Ryan Bailey... The three men tried to get Springsteen&apos;s bike running, but were unsuccessful. Springsteen &#x2014; wearing a brown riding jacket and a red handkerchief &#x2014; then hopped on the back of Ryan Bailey&#x2019;s bike and they headed to the Original Mulligans Grill in Farmingdale. While the musician waited for his ride, he bought Barkalow and his friends a round of drinks, the Freehold man said.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We sat there and shot the breeze for a half hour, 45 minutes till his ride showed up,&quot; said Barkalow. &quot;Nice guy, real down to earth. Just talked about motorcycles and his old Freehold days.&quot;</p>

<p>Springsteen grew up in Freehold, which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170626145146/http://results.enr.clarityelections.com/NJ/Monmouth/64727/182890/Web01/en/summary.html">voted for Donald Trump</a>. Springsteen, who now lives in Colts Neck, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170626145146/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/07/video_bruce_springsteen_election_day_eve_lullaby.php">probably didn&apos;t</a>.</p>
