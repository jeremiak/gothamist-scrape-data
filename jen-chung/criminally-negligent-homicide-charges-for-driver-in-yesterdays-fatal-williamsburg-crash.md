Now, the 23-year-old driver has been hit with numerous charges, including criminally negligent homicide, vehicular manslaughter and DWI.<p></p>

<p>Police say that they received 911 calls at around 4:04 a.m. about a crash on the eastbound section on the bridge near the BQE interchange. When they arrived, they found an unconscious 21-year-old woman, Janice Brown, in the roadway, and EMS pronounced her dead at the scene. According to the NYPD, Brown was ejected from a 2003 Nissan Altima, which had been traveling at a high rate of speed and overcompensated a turn at the interchange, ultimately hitting a divider on the passenger side.</p>

<p>The car kept spinning and went into oncoming traffic lanes. The driver, Ayisha Dobson, decided to move the car and drove to Roebling Street by South 4th Street. She and the other passengers were treated for injuries at Bellevue. Dobson, a Bridgeport, CT resident, was charged with reckless manslaughter, vehicular manslaughter, criminally negligent homicide, DWI and reckless driving.</p>
