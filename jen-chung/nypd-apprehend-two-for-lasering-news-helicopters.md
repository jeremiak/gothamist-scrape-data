<p>The news helicopters of WCBS 2, WNBC 4 and WABC 7 were struck by lasers last night, and the crews helped the NYPD locate suspects. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160406063038/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/News-Chopper-4-Laser-Strike-Caught-on-Video-WNBC-Helps-Nab-Laser-Pointers-Brooklyn-New-York-City-346317872.html">NBC New York reporter Dennis Protsko said</a>, &quot;We could actually see him standing back outside the building with the laser in his hand shooting at us.&quot;</p>

<p>Protsko and his pilot were headed to downtown Brooklyn when they were struck over Prospect Heights. CBS 2&apos;s chopper <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160406063038/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2015/11/11/chopper-2-pilot-laser-brooklyn/">was hit while it was over Park Slope</a>: &quot; Joe Biermann saw a green laser bounce around several times inside the cockpit... &apos;When we were looking there, we got lasered,&apos; Biermann said. &apos;(At the same time), the NYPD was right next to us, so they hovered above the place - a green laser.&apos;&quot;</p>

<p>WABC 7&apos;s helicopter was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160406063038/http://abc7ny.com/news/laser-attack-targets-newscopter-7-arrest-made-in-new-jersey/1080319/">lasered while it was over Elizabeth, NJ</a>.</p>

<p>Protsko said it looked like the man who lasered them was laughing, which infuriated him, &quot;You get hit in the face like that, in the eyes, and you can go temporarily blind... We&apos;re talking about a helicopter that weighs almost two tons,&quot; he added. &quot;Imagine that coming down on your house because the pilot&apos;s vision is impaired. Even more serious if it was a jetliner.&quot; </p>

<p>Here&apos;s video of Protsko and the pilot being hit by the lasers, seeing two figures behind a  building and then, in a satisfying conclusion, watching cops flood the alley <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160406063038/http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/12/nyregion/2-arrested-in-laser-strike-on-helicopter.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;_r=1">behind 925 Fulton Street in Brooklyn</a>:</p>

<p>Two people were taken into custody by the NYPD, and one was arrested. One person was arrested in NJ for the WABC 7 incident. </p>
