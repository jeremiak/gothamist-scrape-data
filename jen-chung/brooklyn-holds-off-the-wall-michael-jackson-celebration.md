</div></div>					<p>Yesterday, Michael Jackson fans gathered in Prospect Park to celebrate Michael Jackson&apos;s 51st birthday, in a celebration thrown by Spike Lee. The party, moved from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160519213806/http://gothamist.com/2009/08/18/spike_lee_plans_king_of_pop_block_p.php">Fort Greene Park</a> to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160519213806/http://gothamist.com/2009/08/22/mj_bday_finds_new_prospects_in_dif.php">much larger Prospect Park</a>, attracted thousands of people who braved the initially dreary weather for a day of music and fun and writer-director <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160519213806/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/brooklyn/2009/08/29/2009-08-29_spike_lee_throws_michael_jackson_birthday_bash_in_brooklyn_.html">Lee told them</a>, &quot;I&apos;m like everybody else - somebody who loved his talent. We&apos;re here to celebrate Michael Jackson.&quot;</p>

<p>DJ Spinna kept the music flowing, Ed Lover and Tracy Morgan introduced songs, and the Reverend Al Sharpton paid tribute to the late singer.  Brooklyn Borough President Marty Markowitz was on hand to proclaim it Michael Jackson Day and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160519213806/http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2009/08/29/michael-jacksons-birthday-party-a-spike-lee-joint/&quot;">told the WSJ&apos;s Speakeasy blog</a>, &quot;<strong>Whatever Spike Lee wants in Brooklyn, Spike Lee gets.</strong>&quot;  Here&apos;s video of some of the celebrating:</p>

<p><object width="640" height="505"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/9J4PydMOuEM&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"><embed src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160519213806oe_/http://www.youtube.com/v/9J4PydMOuEM&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="640" height="505"></object></p>

<p>While many fans were from the borough and the city, some traveled far: The Daily News spoke to a California woman who said, &quot;I had to be here today. I went to Neverland, his house, his mother&apos;s house. I have to be wherever he is.&quot;  And Police Commissioner Ray Kelly seemed pleased with the crowd&apos;s behavior, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160519213806/http://fort-greene.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/08/30/in-celebration-of-mj/">telling the Local</a>, &quot;<strong>I think it&#x2019;s going extremely well. Initially, the weather held the crowd back. But [Michael] is an amazing entertainer, and you can see people are here to just show their appreciation for him.</strong>&quot;</p>
