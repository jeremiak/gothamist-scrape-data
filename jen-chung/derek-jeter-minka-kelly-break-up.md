Kelly, the fetching &quot;Friday Night Lights&quot; ingenue and star of the upcoming &quot;Charlie&apos;s Angels&quot; reboot, has<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120114175510/http://justjared.buzznet.com/2011/08/26/derek-jeter-minka-kelly-split/"> broken up with Yankees captain Derek Jeter</a>.  A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120114175510/http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20523078,00.html">source told People</a>, &quot;They care about each other and it was amicable. They&apos;re still friends.&quot; <p></p>

<p>The couple had been dating for three years, landing on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120114175510/http://gothamist.com/2009/11/19/derek_jeter_lands_on_post_cover_wit.php">cover of the Post together (with Kelly in a bikini</a>), and have weathered incidents such as that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120114175510/http://gothamist.com/2009/12/06/starbucks_barista_no_fan_of_derek_j.php">mean-Starbucks-barista</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120114175510/http://gothamist.com/2009/10/10/yankees_ladies_told_not_to_dump_on.php">one-of-A-Rod&apos;s-blond-girlfriends</a> and there were rumors the pair was going to get married last year.  In the HBO documentary about Jeter getting 3,000 hits, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120114175510/http://www.newsday.com/entertainment/pet-rock-1.811972/report-derek-jeter-minka-kelly-split-up-1.3122842">Kelly said</a>, &quot;When I met Derek I didn&apos;t know anything about baseball at all,&quot; with Jeter then joking, &quot;She&apos;s lying. She had a poster of me on her wall in high school.&quot;</p>

<p>We suppose this means Jeter is officially NYC&apos;s/Florida&apos;s most eligible bachelor.</p>
