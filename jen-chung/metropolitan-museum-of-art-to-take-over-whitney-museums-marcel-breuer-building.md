<p>The boards of the Whitney Museum and Metropolitan Museum of Art have decided to allow the Metropolitan Museum of Art to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502144752/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/12/arts/design/the-met-to-take-over-whitneys-breuer-building.html">take over the Whitney&apos;s famous Marcel Breuer building</a>.  As weird as it seems, the NY Times reports that the Whitney realized it couldn&apos;t afford to keep the Upper East Side space open while also operating a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502144752/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/26/whitney_announces_plans_to_open_dow.php">new museum in the Meatpacking District</a>, &quot;The agreement would serve both institutions: allowing the Whitney to preserve &#x2019;the landmark Breuer building, at Madison and 75th Street, while providing the Met with much needed space to showcase its modern and contemporary art, an area where the institution&#x2019;s holdings have long been considered its weakest link.&quot;</p>

<p>The Whitney is breaking ground on the new <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502144752/http://gothamist.com/2008/05/03/the_whitney.php">Renzo Piano-designed building soon;</a> back in 2008, when Leonard Lauder gave the museum a $131 million donation with the stipulation that it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502144752/http://gothamist.com/2008/03/19/whitney_museum_1.php">wouldn&apos;t be able to sell the Breuer building</a>.  According to the Times, &quot;Under the broad terms approved Tuesday and Wednesday by the museum boards, the Met would move into the Madison Avenue building in four years, when the Whitney&#x2019;s new museum is scheduled to open on Gansevoort Street.&quot;</p>

<p>The Met&apos;s director Thomas Campbell said, &quot;We&#x2019;re not taking modern and contemporary art out of our main building,&quot; and &quot;explain[ed] that the Met is able to show only a fraction of its holdings, which the department of 19th-century, modern and contemporary art numbers at more than 10,000 works, not including drawings and prints or photography.&quot;  <br>
The Whitney will still have some space uptown for offices.</p>
