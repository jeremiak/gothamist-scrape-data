                            <p>Last night, the Empire State scored its second Miss America in a row, with the crowning of Nina Davuluri as the beauty pageant winner. Davuluri, who hails from Fayetteville, NY, is the first Indian American winner in Miss America history. She told reporters that she&apos;s happy that some children &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203060007/http://www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/2013/09/fayettevilles_nina_davuluri_is_named_miss_america.html#incart_big-photo">can finally relate to a new Miss America</a>.&quot;</p>

<p>Davuluri performed an energetic Bollywood dance routine, which she&apos;s described as &quot;an intense, high-energy cardio number, but it&apos;s very expressive and reflects who I am.&quot; Check it out: </p>

<p><iframe width="640" height="480" src="//web.archive.org/web/20131203060007if_/http://www.youtube.com/embed/bEk4YpRjADM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>Of course, the win isn&apos;t without some controversy: Davuluri was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203060007/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/15/miss_new_york_accused_of_fat-shamin.php">reportedly recorded calling last year&apos;s winner, Mallory Hagan, &quot;fat as f---&quot;</a> after she won the Miss New York crown in July. (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203060007/http://gothamist.com/2013/01/13/new_miss_america_mallory_hagan_is_f.php#photo-1">Hagan was a Miss New York</a> and Miss Brooklyn.) And then Page Six revealed Davuluri, who admitted to previously struggling with bulimia, had a &quot;pudgy past&quot; and lost 53 pounds.</p>

<p>On the other side, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203060007/http://www.cnn.com/2013/09/16/showbiz/miss-america-racist-reactions/">racist comments started to flood Twitter</a>: &quot;Well they just picked a Muslim for Miss America. That must&apos;ve made Obama happy. Maybe he had a vote&quot; and &quot;Miss America? You mean Miss 7-11.&quot; CNN noticed that Fox News commentator Todd Starnes Tweeted, &quot;The liberal Miss America judges won&apos;t say this - but Miss Kansas lost because she actually represented American values. #missamerica.&quot;</p>
