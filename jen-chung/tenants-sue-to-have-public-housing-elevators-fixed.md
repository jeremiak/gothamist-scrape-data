<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2009_04_elep.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110820083957im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2009_04_elep.jpg" width="135" height="114" class="image-right"> </span>A group of tenants living in public housing is filing a federal class-action lawsuit against the city for its failure to maintain elevators.  The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110820083957/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/21/nyregion/21elevators.html?ref=nyregion">NY Times reports</a> that the lawsuit notes that the &quot;widespread and systemic failure to maintain the elevators in its buildings in operable working condition&quot; is a violation of disability and human rights laws. Scrutiny of the NYC Housing Authority&apos;s care of elevators came into greater focus after a child <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110820083957/http://gothamist.com/2008/08/19/boys_fatal_fall_down_elevator_shaft.php">fatally fell from a malfunctioning elevator</a> last year, but tenants have complained about malfunctioning elevators for years.  The Times offers many harrowing anecdotes from tenants, including: &quot;Phyllis Gonzalez, 61...refers to the times when both elevators go out in her building in the Chelsea Houses as &apos;double-headers.&apos; <strong>Ms. Gonzalez, who lives in a 12th-floor apartment and uses a wheelchair because of arthritis and other health problems, recalled the day a few years ago when, during a double-header, she went down 12 flights of stairs, sitting on one step at a time.</strong>&quot;  The tenants are not looking for monetary damages&#x2014;just for the NYCHA to fix the elevators in a timely fashion and provide for help the disabled and wheelchair-bound tenants when the elevators are out.</p>
