<p>Mayor Bloomberg appeared on Meet the Press to talk the economy, and he said Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson was the right man for the job (for right now).  Bloomberg <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629185234/http://www.ny1.com/content/top_stories/86081/mayor-wants-more-transparency-in-wall-street/Default.aspx">also touted more transparency</a>, &quot;The first thing we need is more disclosure, visibility. The problem is that nobody knows what any institution owns and what the terms of the securities they own are and what they are worth. If that was out in the public domain then there wouldn&apos;t be this crisis of confidence.&quot;  </p>

<p>Bloomberg also noted how NYC&apos;s been trying to saving, even during the boom times, and blasted partisanship.  You can watch the first 6+ minutes of his interview above--he even talks about how maybe he&apos;d be host of Meet the Press after Brokaw asked about a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629185234/http://gothamist.com/2008/09/10/bloomberg_continues_to_mull_term_li.php">possible third term</a>--but here are some other points:</p><ul><li>On the presidential candidates&apos; experience: &quot;They&apos;re going to face different problems than we have today.  So, when I look at them, I don&apos;t have this litmus test issue on different things, &quot;What are you going to do about A, B and C,&quot; because they are going to face D, E and F, whoever wins, when they&apos;re in office.&quot;</li></ul><p></p>
