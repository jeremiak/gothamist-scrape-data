But lightning struck, injuring five men.  Elber Guerra has second- and third-degree burns on 35% of his body (his clothes caught fire) while Rene Castro has less severe burns; three others were released.  Guerra doesn&apos;t remember being struck, but said his friends told him he &quot;was choking on my tongue, with blood coming out of my mouth. They had to open my clenched teeth to get the tongue.&quot;</p>
