<p>Last night, Mayor de Blasio <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140618184106/http://gothamist.com/2014/06/04/de_blasio_rangers.php">honored his Stanley Cup bet</a> with LA Mayor Eric Garcetti and sang &quot;I Love LA&quot; on Jimmy Kimmel Live. He prefaced the performance with this disclaimer: &quot;We New Yorkers make good on our bets but I don&apos;t have that great a singing voice, so I&apos;ve got some friends here to help me out.&quot; Cover your ears and hope there&apos;s no permanent damage to those kids&apos; ears:</p>

<p>After &quot;singing,&quot; de Blasio announced that Kimmel&apos;s audience would be getting &quot;the finest hot dogs&quot; from Gray&apos;s Papaya. </p>

<p>The Rangers lost the Stanley Cup to the Los Angeles King last Friday. LA Mayor Garcetti <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140618184106/http://laist.com/2014/06/16/video_mayor_garcetti_celebrates_kings.php">celebrated by dropping the F-bomb on live TV</a>.</p>
