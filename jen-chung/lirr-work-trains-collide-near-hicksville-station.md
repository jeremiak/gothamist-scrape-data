<p>Two work trains on the Long Island Rail Road hit each other just west of the Hicksville station. At least three (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427153222/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=resources/traffic&amp;id=9126903">possibly five</a>) workers were injured.</p>

<p>The MTA just  announced, &quot;LIRR service has been restored on one of two tracks between Mineola and Hicksville on the Port Jefferson and Ronkonkoma Branches with residual delays of 60 to 90 minutes.  Service was suspended earlier due to two LIRR work vehicles making contact with each other west of Hicksville Station.&quot;</p>

<p>The work trains&#x2014;which do not have passengers&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427153222/http://www.newsday.com/long-island/lirr-4-hurt-as-work-trains-collide-halting-service-1.5405133">struck each other at 11:03 a.m.</a> According to Newsday, &quot;One of the injured taken to hospital had a lacerated head; the other was in X-ray for possible broken bones, [MTA spokeswoman Marjorie] Anders said. Anders said none of the injuries were &apos;critical but that doesn&apos;t mean they are not serious.&apos;&quot; <br>

Last month, two Metro-North commuter trains <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427153222/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/18/70_injured_from_staggering_metro-no.php">hit each other in Connecticut</a>, injuring dozens.</p>
