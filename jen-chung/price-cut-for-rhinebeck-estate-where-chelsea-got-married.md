<p>The 50-acre Rhineback estate where Chelsea Clinton <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602130816/http://gothamist.com/2010/08/01/photos_newlyweds_chelsea_clinton_ma.php">got married in July</a> may <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602130816/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/25/chelsea_clintons_wedding_means_huds.php">be stunning,</a> but it&apos;s not selling!  The historic Astor Courts was on the market for $12 million before the Clinton-Mezvinsky nupitals, but then it went up to $13.5 million afterwards.  Now, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602130816/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/housing_bubba_bursts_SrwwnCVzjcB2ZT1nQLF3RK?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">Post reports</a>, &quot;With no takers, it&apos;s up for auction -- with a minimum cut-rate bid of just $7.5 million. The price says as much about the former president&apos;s declining star power as it does about the declining market.&quot; </p>

<p>The estate was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602130816/http://gothamist.com/2010/08/04/donald_trump_calls_someone_else_tac.php">recently being marketed</a> as the &quot;site of a recent celebrity wedding&quot; (a move even Donald Trump called &quot;tacky&quot;) but one broker with celebrity clients said, &quot;Star power is associated with who is in vogue. It works for some celebrities, but in this economy it comes down to value.&quot; </p>
