<p>Video shows a terrifying robbery at a Queens deli, where a robber brandished a gun, threatening a worker and his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016011739/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/9-year-old-girl-caught-middle-queens-deli-stickup-article-1.2965954">&quot;half-asleep&quot;</a> young daughter. The harrowing incident happened last month, and now police are hoping the public can help identify two suspects.</p>

<p>The incident occurred around 8:30 p.m. on Saturday, January 28th, at the Maspeth Deli and Grocery (59-66 56 Avenue). The NYPD says, &quot;[O]ne of the two individuals displayed a handgun and approached the 27 year-old male employee and the 9 year-old female who was sitting on his lap. The individual with the gun ordered the employee and the female to get down on the floor while he removed money from the cash registers. In addition he took a cigar box, which contained cash, from underneath the counter and gave it to the second individual, who then placed it inside his jacket.&quot;</p>

<p>The suspects fled on foot, going north on 56th Avenue, with about $3,000 in cash, police say. </p>

<p>The armed suspect was last seen wearing an orange knit cap, a blue coat, blue jeans and red sneakers. The other suspect was last seen wearing a dark colored hooded sweater, a baseball cap, a blue and white jacket, blue jeans and dark colored sneakers.</p>
