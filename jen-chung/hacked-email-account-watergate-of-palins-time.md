Violating the law, or simply invading someone&#x2019;s privacy for political gain, has long been repugnant to Americans&#x2019; sense of fair play. As Watergate taught us, we rightfully reject illegally breaking into candidates&#x2019; private communications for political intrigue in an attempt to derail an election.&quot;</p>
