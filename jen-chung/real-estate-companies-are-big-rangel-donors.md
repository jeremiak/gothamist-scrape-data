According to the Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks donations, Rangel &quot;has collected more money from real estate interests than all but two other members of Congress this election cycle,&quot; with many coming from developers who are reshaping Rangel&apos;s district with new developments--here&apos;s a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170407115413/http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2008/07/27/nyregion/27rangel.chart.gif">graphic</a>.  The article also suggests developers are supporting Rangel due position as chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, and there are also examples of Rangel helping tenants in certain situations.</p>
