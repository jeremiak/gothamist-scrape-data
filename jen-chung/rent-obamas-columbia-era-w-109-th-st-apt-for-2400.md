</div></div>					<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429111900/http://gothamist.com/2010/06/08/rent_obamas_walk-up.php#photo-1">Two years ago</a>, the Morningside Heights apartment where President Obama lived back when he was a Columbia University undergrad went on the rental market.  For $1850/month, the apartment offered two bedrooms, &quot;hardwood floors, exposed brick, nice marble bathroom, high ceilings, big windows.&quot;  Well, things have changed in 2012:  While the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429111900/http://www.citi-habitats.com/viewlisting.php?adID=770813&amp;scroll=1">listing uses many of the same photographs</a>, the apartment is now going for $2400/month.</p>

<p>The listing also tries to tempt those with big dreams, &quot;Live Like the President!!! Barack Obama&apos;s former apartment is now on the market for rent. Be a part of history and live where the President lived while he attended Columbia University. Who knows, you just might end up in the White House one day.&quot;  Of course, back in Obama&apos;s Columbia days, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429111900/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/01/20/recollections-of-obamas-ex-roommate/">there wasn&apos;t heat</a>.</p>
