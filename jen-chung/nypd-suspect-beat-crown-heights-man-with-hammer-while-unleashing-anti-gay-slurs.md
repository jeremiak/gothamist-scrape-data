<p>A Crown Heights man was brutally attacked on Monday morning by a hammer-wielding stranger. And the suspect allegedly uttered anti-gay slurs.</p>

<p>Police say that the attack took place at a Washington Avenue building in the 71st Precinct when a 33-year-old man was followed into his building. In the lobby, the man was hit on the head with a hammer and his cellphone was taken by the attacker.</p>

<p>The victim, Mitchell Pope, said that he was returning to his apartment <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160819050219/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Man-Robbed-Struck-With-Hammer-in-Brooklyn-Anti-Gay-Attack-279180661.html">when the assault began</a>: &quot;As soon as I got into the staircase, I was hit from the back unexpectedly. I fell down the stairs backwards, and he got on top of me and started hitting me.&quot;</p>

At first Pope thought the attacker might have been a construction worker on the property for a recent project. The next thing he knew, he was being attacked and pushed down a set of stairs.&quot; He added, &quot;I was afraid for my life, so I started screaming and fighting back.&quot; </p>

<p>Police say the suspect also made anti-gay remarks during the assault. Pope described his attacker as a &quot;heavier guy, black with a scruffy beard, he had a skully on, and a brown hoodie.&quot; Surveillance video shows the suspect carrying the hammer as he leaves the building. Anyone with information in regards to this incident is asked to call the NYPD&apos;s Crime Stoppers Hotline at 800-577-TIPS.
