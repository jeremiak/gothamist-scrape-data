<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170604213217/http://laist.com/2017/05/22/twin_peaks_returns_more_exhilaratin.php"><em>Twin Peaks</em> is back</a> with more garambozia and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170604213217/http://gothamist.com/2017/05/15/twin_peaks_metrocard.php">unexpected tie-ins</a> than Nadine Hurley could imagine. But once upon a time, the show&apos;s visionary creator, David Lynch, appeared on talk shows, begging for people to watch it&#x2014;and for ABC to change its time slot so people could even tune in.</p>

<p>In a February 27, 1991 interview with David Letterman, Lynch appeared on a rival network (it was <em>The Late Show with David Letterman</em> on NBC) to take his case to the public. At this point, <em>Twin Peaks</em> had been shuttled around a few time slots: It premiered on a Sunday night, then moved to Thursday nights until the first season finale, which was on a Wednesday night. Then, the second season premiered on a Sunday, but then the show aired on Saturday nights. </p>

<p>On the show, Lynch said, &quot;Those popularity polls, we&apos;ve been decreasing in them steadily. There may be lots of reasons, but it doesn&apos;t make any difference. Now we&apos;re sort of in trouble. We think that we have a good show and we can do well on a weeknight because we feel very strongly that people who like Twin Peaks are party people... They are not home on Saturday night. They don&apos;t want to be home on Saturday night. To have the show on then would be wrong.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You know, the truth of it is if you stop and think about it seems like it might be the kind of show that would be...you know, kind of have a limited run. And then would become a classic forever,&quot; Letterman pointed out. </p>

<p>&quot;That&apos;s okay, too. If it has to end, you know, that&apos;s alright but if it doesn&apos;t have to end that&apos;s even better,&quot; Lynch said. Then he he asked fans to write to then-ABC President Bob Iger and asked to give Iger&apos;s NYC office address. Letterman happily agreed, &quot;I love annoying these network weasels.&quot;</p>

<p>[<em>Disclosure: I actually wrote a letter to Bob Iger after reading this. I also turned my freshman year of high school locker into a Twin Peaks shrine and begged my family to visit Seattle and then take a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170604213217/http://laist.com/2017/05/17/visit_twin_peaks.php#photo-1">road trip to Snoqualmie Falls</a>. </em>] </p>

<p>It&apos;s possible that <em>Twin Peaks: The Return</em> is as narrow a cult hit as the original, given the low ratings (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170604213217/http://www.vulture.com/2017/05/twin-peaks-ratings-werent-good-who-cares.html">but really, who cares</a>). So let&apos;s just enjoy trying to decipher the puzzles and apparitions (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170604213217/http://ew.com/tv/2017/05/26/twin-peaks-david-lynch/">seriously, what was the creepy thing in the jail cell</a> a few down from Hastings?). Also, when Lynch met Elisabeth Moss and Jon Hamm at the Cologne Film Festival in 2010, he kept calling them &quot;Peggy&quot; and &quot;Don&apos;:</p>

<p>We would all watch a Lynch-written-and-directed episode of <em>Mad Men</em>, right?</p>
