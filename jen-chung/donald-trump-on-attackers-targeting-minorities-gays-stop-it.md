<p>Besides discussing universal healthcare (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170926044733/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/12/trump_open_to_keeping_the_parts_of.php">some of the Affordable Care Act might stay</a>) and how many undocumented immigrants he&apos;s planning on deporting (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170926044733/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/13/trump_deport_2_million_people.php">two or three million</a>), President-elect Donald Trump was grilled on a few more issues during his 60 Minutes interview. Like the incidents of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170926044733/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/11/mta_bus_muslim_hate_queens.php">people of color</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170926044733/https://twitter.com/jack/status/796844885919731713">the LGBTQ community</a> being harassed. Trump said, &quot;I am very surprised to hear that-- I hate to hear that, I mean I hate to hear that.&quot;</p>

<p>Stahl interviewed Trump on Friday, and in her voiceover, she notes, &quot;When we interviewed him... Mr. Trump said he had not heard about some of the acts of violence that are popping up in his name&#x2026; or against his supporters. Nor he said had he heard about reports of racial slurs and personal threats against African Americans, Latinos and gays by some of his supporters.&quot; </p>

After expressing his surprise about the attacks, Trump said he was only familiar with one or two incidents and didn&apos;t answer Stahl on whether he knew about them from social media. <blockquote>Donald Trump: But I think it&#x2019;s a very small amount. Again, I think it&#x2019;s--

<p>Lesley Stahl: Do you want to say anything to those people?</p>

<p>Donald Trump: I would say don&#x2019;t do it, that&#x2019;s terrible, &#x2018;cause I&#x2019;m gonna bring this country together.</p>

<p> Lesley Stahl: They&#x2019;re harassing Latinos, Muslims--</p>

<p>Donald Trump: I am so saddened to hear that. And I say, &#x201C;Stop it.&#x201D; If it-- if it helps. I will say this, and I will say right to the cameras: Stop it.</p></blockquote><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170926044733/http://www.cbsnews.com/news/60-minutes-donald-trump-family-melania-ivanka-lesley-stahl/">Here&apos;s the transcript</a>.<p></p>

<p>Same-sex marriage was also brought up: Stahl asked, &quot;Do you support marriage equality?&quot; and Trump said, &quot;It&#x2019;s irrelevant because it was already settled. It&#x2019;s law. It was settled in the Supreme Court. I mean it&#x2019;s done... These cases have gone to the Supreme Court. They&#x2019;ve been settled. And, I&#x2019;m fine with that.&quot;</p>

<p>But regarding another case settled by the Supreme Court&#x2014;Roe v. Wade&#x2014;Trump said, &quot;I&#x2019;m pro-life. The judges will be pro-life,&quot; and &quot;[H]aving to do with abortion if it ever were overturned, it would go back to the states. So it would go back to the states.&quot; </p>

That would mean some women would need to go to other states for abortions, Stahl pointed out, to which Trump said, &quot;Well, they&#x2019;ll perhaps have to go, they&#x2019;ll have to go to another state... It&#x2019;s got a long way to go, just so you understand. That has a long, long way to go.&quot;

<p>He refused to divulge his plans for ISIS&#x2014;&quot;I&#x2019;m not gonna say anything. I don&#x2019;t want to tell them anything. I don&#x2019;t want to tell anybody anything&quot;; &quot;All I can tell you is we&#x2019;re going to get rid of ISIS&quot;&#x2014;and claimed he&apos;ll rid himself of the<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170926044733/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/11/trump_transition_team_full_of_lobby.php"> lobbyists he&apos;s got on his transition team</a> at some point, but &quot;That&#x2019;s the only people you have down&quot; in D.C.&quot; to hire. </p>
