<p>Six teenagers, ranging in age from 14 to 18 years old, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150316070516/http://www.newsday.com/news/local/nassau/ny-lirobb0627,0,5611979.story">were arrested yesterday</a> for mugging, attacking, attempting to carjack, and overall menacing in Nassau County.

They also broke into garages to steal bats and crowbars.  Nassau County Police Detective Lt. Raymond Cote said, &quot;<strong>They decided they were going to go out to commit robberies and emulate the [lead] character Nico Belic in the particularly violent video game &apos;Grand Theft Auto.&apos; </strong>These teens have difficulty separating fact from fiction, fantasy from reality... It was quite alarming.&quot; </p>

<p>Initially, there were four teens who attacked and robbed the supermarket employee.  They were going to attack a group of teens, but then realized they were school classmates so they <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150316070516/http://www.nypost.com/seven/06272008/news/regionalnews/game_boy_havoc_on_li_117455.htm">invited them to join in</a>.  The suspects are: Dylan Laird, 17; Stephen Attard, 18; Samuel Philip, 16; Brandon Cruz, 15; Gurnoor Singh, 14; and Jaspreet Singh, 17.  Jaspreet signed was charged with possession of stolen property while the others were charged with first-degree robbery.   <br>
