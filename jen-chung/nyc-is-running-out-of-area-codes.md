										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2009_05_dial.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150613005531im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2009_05_dial.jpg" width="134" height="129" class="image-right"> </span>Move over, 646 and 347&#x2014;there may be new area codes in town.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150613005531/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/05/15/yet-another-area-code-or-more-for-new-york-city/?hp">CityRoom reports</a> that the NY Public Service Commission (the same agency that oversees utilities like Con Ed) has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150613005531/http://www.askpsc.com/askpsc/page/?PageAction=renderPageById&amp;PageId=3c3e4c3956f92d9c1515975795cea0e1">issued a report</a> with two options to deal with the shortage of potential 718 and 347 phone numbers to give out to folks for their cellphones, second cellphones, and whatever other devices.  Option 1: &quot;A new area code would be superimposed over the same geographic area covered by the existing 718/347 area codes,&quot; which covers all boroughs except Manhattan.  Option 2: &quot;A new area code would be superimposed over the same geographic area covered by the existing 718/347 area codes, as well as the area covered by the 212, 646 and 917 area codes,&quot; meaning the whole city would get the new area code. The PSC is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150613005531/http://www.askpsc.com/askpsc/page/?PageAction=renderPageById&amp;PageId=3c3e4c3956f92d9c1515975795cea0e1">accepting comments from the public</a>. And apparently the 646 will run out of numbers by 2014!  Remember when Elaine Benes tried to explain that it wasn&apos;t a NJ area code&#x2014;&quot;No, it&apos;s just like 212 except they multiplied every number by 3&#x2026; and added 1 to the middle number.&quot;</p>
