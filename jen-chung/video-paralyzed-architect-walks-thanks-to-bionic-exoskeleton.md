<p>On December 14, 2007, a crane&apos;s nylon sling, carrying seven tons of steel beams, broke and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160214102308/http://gothamist.com/2007/12/14/crane_collapses.php">fell 25 stories onto a construction trailer</a> at the site of the new Goldman Sachs headquarters.  Inside the trailer was Robert Woo, a Canadian architect, and he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160214102308/http://gothamist.com/2007/12/15/downtown_steel.php">was nearly killed by the crash</a> and doctors said <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160214102308/http://gothamist.com/2007/12/16/architect_injur.php">he might not walk again</a>. But recently Woo has been walking, thanks to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160214102308/http://www.eksobionics.com/">Ekso bionic</a> exoskeleton: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160214102308/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/11/03/walking-again-with-help-from-an-exoskeleton/">CityRoom visited Woo at Mount Sinai Medical Center</a> and took video.</p>

<p>Woo says that his three sons, who live in Canada with his wife, think that daddy is like a robot&#x2014;or a &quot;Transformer.&quot;  The Ekso bionic exoskeleton is not for home use (yet; a version may be ready in 2013) and Mount Sinai is considering buying the $100,000 model Woo tried out for the rehabilitation department.  City Room describes how the apparatus needs a human touch: There&apos;s a &quot;hand-held controller operated by a physical therapist, 15 sensors, a small computer, 2 lithium batteries strapped to Mr. Woo&#x2019;s back and 2 purring motors, resembling holstered shotguns, at his sides.&quot;  Ekso wants to develop a model that fit under patients&apos; pants.  </p>

<p>Woo, who had been designing a new house in Toronto, &quot;with elevators and upward slopes, but no stairs,&quot; sued Goldman Sachs and settled (he wouldn&apos;t discuss the terms).</p>
