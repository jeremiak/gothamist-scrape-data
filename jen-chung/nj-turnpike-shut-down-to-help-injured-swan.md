<p>A truck driver hauling debris managed to save a pair of swans earlier this morning from NJ drivers. Trucker&#x2014;and animal lover&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130825064740/http://www.annsacks.com/home.jsp">Fred Kowal told NBC New York</a> that he spotted a pair of swans between exits 16W and 15W. And one seemed injured, so he pulled over.</p>

<p>NBC New York reports, &quot;Standing protectively over the injured swan was another swan, believed to be a male. Kowal said the injured swan could walk, but cuts he observed on its webbed foot and leg apparently made movement uncomfortable.  He tried to herd the two birds underneath a guardrail and into the nearby marsh to safety, but the swan that had been standing ran into the main highway, forcing cars to a crawl as drivers tried to avert it.&quot;</p>

<p>After other unsuccessful attempts, the highway was eventually shut down and a NJ Turnpike official and another trucker helped Kowal use a broom to encourage the swans into the marsh. Kowal, who is a &quot;husband and father of three has a hairless cat named Jinxie and has owned several parakeets and tropical parrots over the years,&quot; stuck around to make sure they stayed there. What a hero!</p>
