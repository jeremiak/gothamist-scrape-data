A family spokesman said Kinkade died in his home in Los Gatos, California, in the Bay Area, of natural causes.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120413111515/http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gk4IEwizVGNQ58TySQe1fLxcGPbg?docId=3140d280431b4febbd303166a2689705">The AP&apos;s obituary explains</a>, &quot;Artist Thomas Kinkade once said that he had something in common with Walt Disney and Norman Rockwell: He wanted to make people happy.... He claimed to be the nation&apos;s most collected living artist, and his paintings and spin-off products were said to fetch some $100 million a year in sales, and to be in 10 million homes in the United States. Those light-infused renderings are often prominently displayed in buildings, malls, and on products &#x2014; generally depicting tranquil scenes with lush landscaping and streams running nearby. Many contain images from Bible passages.&quot;</p>

<p>Kinkade called himself the &quot;Painter of Light,&quot; saying, &quot;I&apos;m a warrior for light. With whatever talent and resources I have, I&apos;m trying to bring light to penetrate the darkness many people feel.&quot;  However, Kinkade and his associates created a money-making machine from &quot;light,&quot; by offering his paintings through galleries operated by franchisees, some of whom accused Kinkade and management <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120413111515/http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/1112584561.html?dids=1112584561:1112584561&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Aug+29%2C+2006&amp;author=Kim+Christensen&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=C.1&amp;desc=Painter+Said+to+Be+Focus+of+FBI+Probe">of ruining them</a>.  A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120413111515/http://fredericksburg.com/News/FLS/2006/092006/09212006/220020">lawyer for dealers who successfully won a $860,000 judgement from the firm managing Kinkade&apos;s empire said</a>, &quot;Most of my clients got involved with Kinkade because it was presented as a religious opportunity/ Being defrauded is awful enough, but doing it in the name of God is really despicable.&quot;</p>

<p>Being a businessman, Kinkade also tackled less pastoral subjects, from the old Yankee Stadium to the Indianapolis Speedway. He described the process for the Speedway painting, &quot;The passion I have is to capture memories, to evoke the emotional connection we have to an experience. I came out here and stood up on the bleachers and looked around, and I saw all the elements of the track. It was empty at the time. But I saw the stadium, how the track laid out, the horizon, the skyline of Indianapolis and the Pagoda. I saw it all in my imagination. I began thinking, &apos;I want to get this energy &#x2014; what I call the excitement of the moment &#x2014; into this painting.&apos; As I began working on it, I thought, &apos;Well you have this big piece of asphalt, the huge spectator stands; I&apos;ve got to do something to get some movement.&apos; So I just started throwing flags into it. It gives it kind of a patriotic excitement.&quot;</p>

<p>Joan Didion <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120413111515/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Kinkade#cite_note-didion-12">once wrote of Kinkade&apos;s work</a>, &quot;A Kinkade painting was typically rendered in slightly surreal pastels. It typically featured a cottage or a house of such insistent coziness as to seem actually sinister, suggestive of a trap designed to attract Hansel and Gretel. Every window was lit, to lurid effect, as if the interior of the structure might be on fire.&quot;  </p>
