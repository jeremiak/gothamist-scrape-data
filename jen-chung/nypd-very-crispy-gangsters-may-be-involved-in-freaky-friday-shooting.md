                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:365px; "> <img alt="2011_06_drogers.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20140307054742im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2011_06_drogers.jpg" width="365" height="273"> <br> <i>Donzell Rogers (via Post)</i></div> Police Commissioner Ray Kelly spoke about yesterday&apos;s Brooklyn shooting that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140307054742/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/18/brooklyn_house_party_shooting_leave.php">spilled out from a East New York house party</a>.  Police said that the fight was instigated when two men bumped into each other during a &quot;Freaky Friday&quot; party at 325 Wyona Street.  Now, the cops say the men may have been in gangs; Kelly said, &quot;We believe there&apos;s gang involvement here -- one group called the &apos;Very Crispy Gangsters&apos; who may have some involvement.&quot;<p></p>

<p>The shooting occurred after 3 a.m.  It&apos;s believed at least 20 shots were fired&#x2014;a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140307054742/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/06/18/man-killed-and-eight-wounded-as-party-ends-in-gunfire/">neighbor told City Room</a>, &quot;I heard so many gunshots I lost count. Then I heard people screaming.&quot; Another witness, Dennis Fitzgerald, was a little more <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140307054742/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2011/06/18/2011-06-18_brooklyn_shootout_at_freaky_friday_party_leaves_one_dead_eight_wounded.html">descriptive to the Daily News</a>: &quot;It was a massacre. It was like a zombie movie. People just staggering all bloody.&quot; Donzell Rogers, 20, who lived on Lincoln Place in Brooklyn, was pronounced dead at Brookdale University Hospital (Fitzgerald said, &quot;He was breathing like a fish out of water. Blood was coming out of his mouth. I knew he wouldn&apos;t make it.&quot;).  The other victims were all males, ages 17, (five are) 19, 20 and 33. </p>

<p>The party was promoted on Facebook and by flyers posted in the neighborhood.  Neighbors say that a woman, Ann Bryant, in the ground floor apartment was hosting the parties, and two previous ones weren&apos;t a problem.  According to the News, &quot;The violence began once the party became so packed it was nearly impossible to move. One man coming up the crowded back steps bumped into a man heading down, and words were exchanged. A third man trying to defuse the dispute was sucker-punched, landing on top of Fitzgerald. The man regained his balance, pulled a weapon from his waistband and opened fire, Fitzgerald said.&quot;</p>

He fell on people and regained his balance, and he spun around and pulled the gun out. Then he waved it in a circle in the air, and then he let it off.&quot; The Post reports, &quot;The armed madman then fired at random as he made his way to the back yard, leaving behind a trail of wailing, begging and stampeding partygoers... Some in the crowd broke down a 6-foot-tall wooden fence and draped sarongs over glass shards topping a cement wall next door as they vaulted to safety...  Some even left their shoes behind... After leaving the yard, the gunman re-entered the house and started shooting again.&quot;  The shooting was still going on when police arrived.</p>

<p>The party had a $5 cover; Bryant was questioned for charging for alcohol, but she told the Post, &quot;I can have liquor in my house. I wasn&apos;t charging for shots, the DJ was. She left with a wallet full of rent!. I was in the bedroom when the shots went off. I hid there until it stopped.&quot;</p>

<p>The police have three suspects in custody but none have been charged. The Very Crispy Gangsters are suspected in a shooting that left a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140307054742/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/03/escalating_gang_war_to_blame_for_st.php">10-year-old boy injured from the crossfire</a>.</p>
