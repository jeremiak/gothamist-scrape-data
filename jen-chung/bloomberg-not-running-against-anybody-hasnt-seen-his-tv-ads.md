										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2009_08_bloombox.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160308020439im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2009_08_bloombox.jpg" width="250" height="230" class="image-left"> </span>At an event where Mayor Michael Bloomberg, alongside  the city&apos;s Veteran&#x2019;s Affairs employees and NYC Service participants, helped put together care packages for overseas troops, the mayor was asked about the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160308020439/http://gothamist.com/2009/08/27/thompson_avella_have_democratic_deb.php">Wednesday night debate</a> between Democratic mayoral hopefuls City Comptroller Bill Thompson and City Councilman Tony Avella (the two Democrats spent much of the debate attacking the mayor).  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160308020439/http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hI6xk0UTd37Ca469MRtnG6bpzWMAD9ABDBFG0">Bloomberg said he didn&apos;t watch</a> the debate but apparently heard about it, suggesting the candidates &quot;wasted an opportunity&quot; in attacking him instead of giving reasons why they would be good for the city, &quot;I&apos;m not going to &apos;face&apos; either of them... I&apos;m running on a record, and I&apos;m trying to lay out the things that I would do if given another opportunity.&quot;</p>

<p>Regarding the fact that basically three-quarters of New York voters <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160308020439/http://gothamist.com/2009/08/26/bloomberg_campaign_pestering_their.php">have seen his TV ads</a> (and many find them annoying), <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160308020439/http://www.politickerny.com/5056/bloomberg-says-if-you-dont-his-ads-dont-watch">PolitickerNY caught this exchange</a>:</p><blockquote>The ads are &#x201C;somewhat unavoidable,&#x201D; said a reporter from the Associated Press.<p></p>

<p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;ve managed to avoid them,&#x201D; said Bloomberg.</p>

<p>&#x201C;You don&#x2019;t ever see your ads?&#x201D; the reporter asked.</p>

<p>&quot;I don&#x2019;t have time to watch television,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;I have a job that sort of requires me to work from sort of early in the morning till the middle of the evening. Then, catching up on all the work that I have to take home, I don&#x2019;t have a lot of time to watch television. But if I did, and I didn&#x2019;t like the ads, I guess I could turn it off or not watch.&quot;</p></blockquote>Spoken like a true media mogul!<p></p>
