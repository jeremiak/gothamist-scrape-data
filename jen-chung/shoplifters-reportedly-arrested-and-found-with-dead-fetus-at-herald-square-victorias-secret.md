<p>The tabloids are reporting on a grim discovery made at a midtown Victoria&apos;s Secret: The body of a dead fetus inside a bag carried by a possible shoplifter.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150802211923/http://nypost.com/2013/10/17/thief-caught-in-victorias-secret-carrying-stillborn-baby/">Post reports</a> that a guard spotted two women taking items from the racks at the Herald Square location: &quot;The guard stopped the women and called police to the store. It wasn&#x2019;t until the cops were cuffing the thieves that they made the grisly discovery - one of the women was walking around with a fetus in a shopping bag.&quot; </p>
