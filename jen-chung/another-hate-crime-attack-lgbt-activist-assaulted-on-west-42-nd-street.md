One man, Manuel Riquelme, 19, was arrested for assault as a hate crime and aggravated harassment as a hate crime. <p></p>

<p>The victim has been identified as Eugene Lovendusky, a LGBT activist. His friend, Alan Bounville, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717104610/http://thenewcivilrightsmovement.com/lgbt-activist-becomes-victim-of-anti-gay-violent-attack-in-nycs-hells-kitchen/news/2013/05/25/67502">wrote on Facebook</a>, &quot;...a group of 9-10 men attacked one of my dearest friends, Eugene Lovendusky. They yelled &#x2018;faggot&#x2019; at Eugene as he was punched in the jaw.&quot;</p>

<p>The attack occurred at 3:22 a.m. outside of 350 West 42nd Street. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717104610/http://origin.ny1.com/content/top_stories/182737/manhattan-teen-charged-with-city-s-latest-alleged-anti-gay-bias-attack">According to NY1</a>, &quot;Lovendusky and his boyfriend and another friend were leaving the XL nightclub and walking towards a nearby subway stop. Police say a group of nine teenagers, including Riquelme, passed the three men and started calling them anti-gay slurs. Riquelme allegedly hit Lovendusky in the face and knocked off the victim&apos;s glasses, according to police. After the alleged incident, Lovendusky called police and officers found the teens in a pizzeria at West 40th Street and Ninth Avenue.&quot; </p>

<p>Lovendusky had spoken <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717104610/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/21/photos_hundreds_march_to_protest_ha.php">during the rally against hate crimes</a> (and in memory of Mark Carson, who was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717104610/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/19/greenwich_village_hate_crime_murder.php">killed in the West Village on May 17</a>). There have been a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717104610/http://gothamist.com/tags/hatecrime">number of gay bashings</a> in recent weeks, prompting the NYPD to increase patrols. </p>
