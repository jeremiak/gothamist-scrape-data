First Republic bought the properties for $128 million but went bankrupt in 2009. That same year Citigroup sued Stern, claiming he was on the hook for all the money.&quot;</p>

<p>He pays for daily visits from cleaning ladies and has stacks of cash in his home, the source said. &#x201C;There are times he&#x2019;ll have 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 100 grand in the house,&#x201D; the associate said. Stern, who was holed up yesterday, could not be reached for comment. </p>

<p>He received several food deliveries and a masseuse stopped by to give his wife a rubdown.</p></blockquote>Stern bought his mansion in 2008 and started renovations&#x2014;but since he&apos;s bankrupt and there are liens against him, his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130510145832/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/sen-malcolm-smith-key-witness-moses-mark-stern-owes-citigroup-126-million-sources-article-1.1306763?localLinksEnabled=false">home is surrounded by stalled construction</a>: The News found &quot;on Wednesday the front yard was littered with construction debris. A car sat among fallen tree limbs and weeds in the backyard.&quot;<p></p>

<p>The other person involved in the probe was an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130510145832/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20130403/new-york-city/fbi-agent-posed-as-wealthy-investor-named-raj-snare-pols-bribery-plot">undercover FBI agent named &quot;Raj&quot;</a>, who posed as a developer willing to pay off politicians (pro-tip to politicians: NEVER ACCEPT BRIBES). At any rate, Stern&apos;s character is now being targeted by Smith&apos;s team: Defense lawyer Gerald Shargel said, &quot;The U.S. Attorney made it seem the roof had been blown off the presumption of innocence. Now 24 hours later we&apos;re seeing the case is based on a shaky foundation.&quot;</p>
