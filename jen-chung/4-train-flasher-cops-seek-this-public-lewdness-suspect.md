<p>According to the NYPD, the incident occurred at 7:35 a.m. on Thursday, January 28th, when the man lowered his pants and exposed himself to a female passenger on a southbound 4 train at Grand Central. Unfortunate witnesses say he then pulled up his pants, went into the next subway car, and exposed himself again to more female passengers.  </p>

<p>Photos of the suspect, described as being about 30 years old and 5&apos;9&quot; and wearing a black hooded sweatshirt, and blue jeans, were released. </p>

<p>Anyone with information in regards to this incident is asked to call Crime stoppers at 1-800-577-TIPS (8477).  The public can also submit their tips by logging onto the Crime stoppers website at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160613234613/http://WWW.NYPDCRIMESTOPPERS.COM/">WWW.NYPDCRIMESTOPPERS.COM</a> or by texting their tips to 274637 (CRIMES) then enter TIP577.</p>

<p>If you see or experience sexual misconduct in the subway (this includes seeing a masturbator, being groped, being grinded on, etc.), <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160613234613/http://mta-nyc.custhelp.com/app/ask_sh">you can report it to the MTA and police on this website</a>. There&apos;s also a place for you to upload photos and/or video. </p>
