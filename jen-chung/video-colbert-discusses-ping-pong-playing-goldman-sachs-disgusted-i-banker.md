<p>Greg Smith&apos;s<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120316175829/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/14/goldman_sachs_exec_calls_firm_toxic.php"> very public resignation from Goldman Sachs</a>&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120316175829/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/14/opinion/why-i-am-leaving-goldman-sachs.html?_r=3&amp;pagewanted=all">by way of a NY Times op-ed</a> slamming the money first, customers last culture at the firm&#x2014;got the late night comedy treatment.  Stephen Colbert led off The Colbert Report with it, noted Smith&apos;s ping-pong prowess as well as, &quot;<strong>Once he found out Goldman had a culture of greed, he left immediately after 12 years at the firm</strong>.&quot;</p>

<p>As for Smith&apos;s dismay, &quot;Over the last 12 months I have seen five different managing directors refer to their own clients as &apos;muppets,&apos; sometimes over internal e-mail... You don&#x2019;t have to be a rocket scientist to figure out that the junior analyst sitting quietly in the corner of the room hearing about &apos;muppets,&apos; &apos;ripping eyeballs out&apos; and &apos;getting paid&apos; doesn&#x2019;t exactly turn into a model citizen.&quot; May we offer this video:</p>
