<p>It&apos;s a Hillary homecoming: CNN and AP are calling the NY Democratic Primary for Hillary Clinton. </p>

<p>With 39% of precincts reporting, Clinton is leading 60.4% to Bernie Sanders&apos; 39.6%; much of upstate has yet to be tallied.</p>

<p>You can see maps by which candidate <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161005204342/http://www.nytimes.com/elections/results/new-york?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=b-lede-package-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news">won which county at the NY Times</a>; you can even <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161005204342/http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/04/19/us/elections/new-york-city-democratic-primary-results.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=b-lede-package-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news&amp;_r=1#11/40.8032/-73.9232">see who won what block</a>! </p>

<p>Of course, there&apos;s question about what was going on today at the polls: It was a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161005204342/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/19/ny_primary_live_updates.php">grueling day for voters and Board of Elections workers</a>, filled <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161005204342/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/19/comptroller_will_audit_nyc_board_of.php">with lots of problems</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161005204342/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/19/brooklyn_boe_court.php">aggravated voters</a>.</p>

<p>Sanders&apos; campaign voiced concerns about the reported voter issues today, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161005204342/https://www.yahoo.com/news/sanders-has-little-path-to-victory-left-after-a-014826184.html">spokeswoman Erika Andiola said</a>, &#x201C;From long lines and dramatic understaffing to longtime voters being forced to cast affidavit ballots and thousands of registered New Yorkers being dropped from the rolls, what&#x2019;s happening today is a disgrace. We need to be making it easier for people to vote, not inventing arbitrary obstacles &#x2014; and today&#x2019;s shameful demonstration must underline the urgent importance of fixing voting laws across the country.&#x201D;</p>
