Let&apos;s find a resolution to this conflict,&quot; &quot;I understand that perhaps I made a mistake - the biggest mistake of my life.

<p>Rodriguez&apos;s lawyer claimed that K-Rod <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623140846/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/09/14/mets-rodriguez-violates-protection-order-but-avoids-jail/">was &quot;unsophisticated&quot;</a> and didn&apos;t understand the court order included texting, &quot;There are no threats. There are no menacing comments. He professes his love to the mother of his children.&quot; The Mets only said,  &quot;Because this is a pending criminal matter, we refer all questions to the district attorney&apos;s office.&quot;</p>
