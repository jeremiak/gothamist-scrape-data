<p>After news that 75% of cabbies had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422144143/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/13/some_taxi_drivers_scammed_fares_out.php">overcharged passengers at least once</a>, some drivers are worried: Osman Chowdhury, who returned $500,000-worth of diamond jewelry left in his cab, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422144143/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/03/14/2010-03-14_good_hacks_blast_cheats.html">told the Daily News</a>, &quot;I feel very ashamed [of cheating drivers], When you&apos;re driving, people now look at you and think you&apos;re going to do something bad. The bad thing becomes the issue, and then the good things drivers do are forgotten.&quot;</p>

<p>In this instance, drivers charged twice the regular 40-cent per 1/5 mile NYC rate (measured on the meter under &quot;Code 1&quot;) by using the the 80-cent per 1/5 mile rate for Nassau and Westchester counties (&quot;Code 4&quot;)&#x2014;resulting in over $8 million in overcharges. And while 75% of drivers have overcharged at least once, the Taxi and Limousine Commission found that about 3,000 of the city&apos;s 36,000 cabbies overcharged 1,000 times. One woman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422144143/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/14/nyregion/14taxi.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">told the NY Times</a> about her bad experienced:</p><blockquote>Monica Gutierrez 39, said she got into a cab outside Saks Fifth Avenue on her birthday last May and asked the driver to take her to Brooklyn. He initially refused but then relented, only to activate the No. 4 setting when he turned on the meter. Ms. Gutierrez added that at the time she did not know what that meant.<p></p>

<p>Along the way he stopped the cab to make a call and left the meter running. Ms. Gutierrez said that when she reached her destination near Downtown Brooklyn, the fare was more than $30, far more than what the trip usually cost. She refused to pay, but she said her mother-in-law eventually gave the money to the driver.</p></blockquote><br>
She later filed a complaint with the TLC, but at the hearing the judge sided with the driver.<p></p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422144143/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/fare_fair_cab_credit_refunds_XN6qJfAj44CSC5wqtqxCiN">Post reports</a> that TLC Commissioner Matthew Daus wants to &quot;recover whatever he can of the more than $8.3 million scammed out of 2 million passengers in the past 26 months&quot; by working with banks to reimburse fares who paid with credit cars.  Which means the catch is that cash-paying customers&#x2014;the majority of cab passengers&#x2014;won&apos;t get a refund.  </p>
