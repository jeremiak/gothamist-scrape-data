title: Is "The Sloppy Tuna" A Brilliant Bar Name Or What?

<p>Once upon a time, there was a Montauk bar and restaurant named Nick&apos;s on the Beach.  But then Nick&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150902010038/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/montauk_gets_snooki_fied_DjqkAsQc2yWw0ZjDTa9JiJ">became... The Sloppy Tuna</a>.  Given that Urban Dictionary explains &quot;sloppy tuna&quot; as &quot;loose woman, easy lay [<em>Example: Yo, this club sucks! Lets sniff out some sloppy tuna down in the carboards!</em>],&quot; neighbors are not exactly thrilled.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150902010038/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/montauk_gets_snooki_fied_DjqkAsQc2yWw0ZjDTa9JiJ">Post says</a> that venue &quot;draws throngs of girls in Snooki-style skintight miniskirts and bikinis, along with buffed-out men.&quot; One neighbor &quot;[said] it&apos;s an old seafaring slur for prostitutes who wait at ports for sailors&quot; and professed her distaste, but someone who works at a nearby hotel said there was a kernel of truth to it, &quot;It&apos;s a huge, drunk crowd. It&apos;s a bunch of sloppy girls, so the name isn&apos;t that far off.&quot;  </p>

<p>The Sloppy Tuna&apos;s owner didn&apos;t want to explain what the name meant, but did tell the Post, &quot;Just come on down and have a good time.&quot; A Yelp review, from 2009, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150902010038/http://www.yelp.com/biz/nicks-montauk">noticed the strip pole and said</a>, &quot;Nick&apos;s is the love child of the Jersey Shore and Saratoga Springs, only set on Atlantic off the main drag on Montauk... While I can&apos;t condone any other of the reviewers, I will say the crowd was a mix of grizzly old dead heads, twenty somethings and young party-goers (think tight dresses with [heels] and Growing Up Gotti-esque blowouts).&quot;</p>
