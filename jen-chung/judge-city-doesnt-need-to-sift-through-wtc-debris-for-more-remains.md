                            <p><img alt="2008_07_remains.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130821072039im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2008_07_remains.jpg" width="244" height="161" class="right">A federal judge ruled in favor for the city, saying the city <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130821072039/http://www.nysun.com/new-york/judge-rules-for-city-on-search-for-september-11/81405/">is not &quot;required to re-sift through debris&quot;</a> from the World Trade Center in hopes of finding more human remains.</p>

<p>Some families felt the city should go back to Fresh Kills landfill--where almost 2 million tons of debris from the aftermath of the World Trade Center attacks were dumped--and go through the tons of debris so they could recover remains for burial.  The families, calling themselves the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130821072039/http://www.wtcfamiliesforproperburial.com/">World Trade Center Families for Proper Burial</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130821072039/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/08/nyregion/08remains.html?ref=nyregion">sued the city</a> and noted that even medical examiner Dr. Charles Hirsch believed there were still remains mixed in with the debris. Some victims&apos; relatives wrote an editorial in the Daily News in February, pointing out FEMA had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130821072039/http://www.nydailynews.com/opinions/2008/02/24/2008-02-24_911_victims_should_not_be_left_in_the_fr.html">dedicated $125 million to sift through the debris</a> but the program ended &quot;one year ahead of schedule and $58 million under budget.&quot;</p>

<p>However, judge Alvin Hellerstein agreed with the city that it would be impossible to know whether a loved one&apos;s remains were at Fresh Kills (according to the NY Times, the city&apos;s argument was, &quot;for good or ill, a plaintiff&#x2019;s property rights to claim a body for burial were predicated on knowing in fact that it belonged to a loved one&quot;) given how small the remains might be.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130821072039/http://www.nypost.com/seven/07082008/news/regionalnews/9_11_families_landfill_suit_gets_dumped_118910.htm">Hellerstein said</a>, &quot;<strong>Not every wrong can be addressed through the judicial process.</strong> The grave harm suffered by the plaintiffs in this case is undeniable. But the jurisdiction of a court is limited.&quot;</p>

<p>The city had claimed it had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130821072039/http://gothamist.com/2006/10/24/initial_wtc_rem.php">completed the search for WTC remains</a> prior to starting construction at Ground Zero, but some workers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130821072039/http://gothamist.com/2006/10/20/more_remains_fo.php">found fragments of bone while excavating in 2006</a>, starting a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130821072039/http://gothamist.com/2006/10/22/renewed_search.php">new search for remains</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130821072039/http://gothamist.com/2006/11/03/continued_prote.php">more criticism for the city&apos;s approach</a>.
