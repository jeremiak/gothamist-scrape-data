<p>A Brooklyn medical supply store was held up by an armed robber on Friday afternoon, police say, and surveillance video shows the suspect punching and kicking the manager who fought back. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170301130233/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2017/02/25/surgical-store-robbery/">She told WCBS2</a>, &quot;I honestly don&apos;t know what came over me. It was a fight or flight situation, I chose to fight.&quot;</p>

<p>The robbery took place around 3:40 p.m. on February 2, at the Belmont Medical &amp; Surgical Supply store at 14 Belmont Avenue in Brownsville. According to the NYPD, the suspect &quot;walked inside the location, entered the back room, displayed a black semi-automatic firearm and demanded money from two store employees. Victim #1, a 28-year-old female, refused to comply. The unknown individual then proceeded to punch and kick her about the body striking her two times to the head with his firearm causing a laceration. Victim # 2, a 44-year-old female, gave him $80 cash before he fled the establishment.&quot;</p>

<p>The manager, Oksana Aulova, 28, said they don&apos;t have a cash register, explaining to WCBS 2, &quot;We deal with insurances, so I don&#x2019;t know what he could have been thinking, because there&#x2019;s no cash.&quot; The other victim, her assistant, offered the suspect her own cash. WCBS notes how on the video, the suspect &quot;carefully counted the cash, then finally ran off when Aulova reached for a Taser.&quot;</p>

<p>Aulova received four stitches in her head. WCBS2 reports that detectives told her someone had been staking out the store for the robber in order to see when the women would be alone. &quot;It just angers me that somebody could come in and think that they could take advantage of two women, just because they&apos;re in an office,&quot; she told the website.</p>

<p>The suspect is described as about 40-50 years old, 5&apos;11&quot; tall, and 160 pounds. He was last seen wearing beige workboots, blue jeans, a brown jacket, and a brown skull cap with a light brown stripe.<br>
