Port Authority spokesman John Kelly &quot;said 250 to 300 passengers were evacuated from Terminal 1 at the airport around 6 p.m. and were allowed back in after 8 p.m.,&quot; according to the AP.</p>

<p>Bomb-sniffing dogs <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427141419/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/queens/terminal_at_jfk_evacuated_because_eESI2VzpEUrW79uCkiLItL?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">were on the scene</a> and it was ultimately determined that the bag was not a bomb.
