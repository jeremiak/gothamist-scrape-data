<p>Kickball players, rejoice:  City Councilman Stephen Levin is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150511170645/http://www.dnainfo.com/20120123/williamsburg-greenpoint-bushwick/mccarren-park-gets-930000-fight-hipster-lake-puddles">putting $930,000 towards fixing the constantly-flooded McCarren Park</a>.  One softball player tells DNAinfo, &quot;It&apos;s a nuisance, but it&apos;s also become a part of the landscape. People ride their bikes through it, kids are dying to play in it and the parents are like, &apos;Don&apos;t go in there!&apos; because it&apos;s so dirty,&quot; and reveals she and her friends call it &quot;Hipster Lake.&quot; Another park visitor&apos;s dog &quot;sat vomiting after slurping up a fetid puddle.&quot;</p>

<p>The plan would include rebuilding paths and drains.  The new kickball season is expected to begin in April, as long as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150511170645/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/21/brooklyn_kickball_saved_by_seeding.php">pesky seeding</a> isn&apos;t an obstacle.</p>
