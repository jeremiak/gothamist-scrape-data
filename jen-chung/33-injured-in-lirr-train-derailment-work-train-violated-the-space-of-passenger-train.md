<p>A Long Island Rail Road train from Penn Station derailed on its way to the New Hyde Park last night, when a work train sideswiped it around 9 p.m. Thirty-three people were injured, and Governor Andrew Cuomo said this morning that the work train <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016021428/http://www.newsday.com/long-island/transportation/cuomo-to-tour-lirr-derailment-scene-sunday-morning-1.12427557">&quot;violated the space&quot;</a> of the passenger train.</p>

<p>LIRR service between Jamaica and Hicksville <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016021428/http://www.mta.info/status/LIRR/PortJefferson/24600328">is suspended</a> until further notice.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016021428/http://www.newsday.com/long-island/transportation/cuomo-to-tour-lirr-derailment-scene-sunday-morning-1.12427557">According to Newsday</a>, &quot;The work train was on a track that was out of service and, although it was not a head-on collision, the equipment was obstructing the way of the passenger train near a switch... The work train, a yellow, one-car train, was performing scheduled maintenance on a second track on that train line Saturday. The two trains made contact at a switch near the New Hyde Park Station.&quot; MTA President Thomas Prendergast said last night, &quot;It appears that the contact was made with the first car. Kind of like a sideswiping.&quot;</p>

<p>About 600 people were on the train. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016021428/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/LIRR-Derails-in-New-Hyde-Park-396428241.html">One passenger told NBC New York</a>, &quot;So the train was going normally, it was going at its normal speed, and then it started to shake, but that&#x2019;s sort of normal, and then everyone started to sort of scream - so I realized something was wrong... And the train was really (going) back and forth and shaking &#x2026; and then I look out the window and I saw a spark or a fire type thing &#x2026; and then the train abruptly stopped and the car in front of mine was tilted, as if it wasn&#x2019;t fully on the track.&quot;</p>
