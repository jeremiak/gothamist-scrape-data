<p>Police have linked two separate crimes&#x2014;a carjacking and a robbery&#x2014;that occurred Greenwich Village and the West Village.</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2015_10_suvb.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160107094317im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2015_10_suvb.jpg" width="150" height="187" class="image-right"> </span>According to the NYPD, the first incident occurred around 3:35 a.m. on Saturday, October 17th, when the suspect approached an 18-year-old man getting out of a light-colored SUV (pictured right) in front of 35 East 9th Street: &quot;The suspect then engaged the victim in conversation at which point he displayed a silver firearm and demanded the victim&apos;s property. The suspect removed the victim&apos;s LG cellphone and fled westbound on East 9th Street in the SUV.&quot;</p>

<p>Then, fifteen minutes later at 3:50 a.m., police say that the same man followed a 26-year-old woman into her building on Hudson Street and demanded her bag. He then allegedly hit her in the head with his gun, took her bag and then fled. The victim refused medical attention.</p>

<p>Police released images and video of the suspect, described as 18-25 years old, and an image of the SUV.</p>
