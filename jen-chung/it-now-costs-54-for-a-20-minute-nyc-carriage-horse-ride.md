<p>Mayor Bill de Blasio has a fairly contentious relationship with the horse carriage industry. First he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161007060258/http://gothamist.com/2014/04/12/de_blasio_promises_to_ban_nyc_carri.php">promised to ban carriage horses</a>, then he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161007060258/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/18/carriage_horse_nyc_deal.php#photo-1">decided just to limit them</a>, but then the Council <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161007060258/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/04/horse_carriage_deal_falls_through.php">wouldn&apos;t even vote on that</a>... so now the drivers are getting a raise.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161007060258/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/04/horse_carriage_deal_falls_through.php">The Daily News reports</a>, &quot;The city Department of Consumer Affairs quietly hiked the price of a carriage ride last week, part of a Michael Bloomberg administration deal that had been on hold while de Blasio duked it out with the drivers over the possible ban. Drivers can now charge $54.08 for the first 20 minutes of a ride, and $21.63 for every 10 minutes after. Before the rate hike, the drivers were allowed to charge $50 for the first 20 minutes, and $20 for every 10 minutes after.&quot; </p>

<p>Forty minutes is apparently the average trip length, so you&apos;ll have to shell out just under $100.</p>

<p>NYCLASS, the animal rights group that supported de Blasio, is unhappy; executive director Allie Taylor told the News, &quot;Mayor de Blasio&#x2019;s failure to protect these animals is now complete. He rewards an industry that abuses animals and sends horses to slaughter, while claiming he is a champion of animal rights. It&#x2019;s pathetic, but expected at this point from a mayor who stands for nothing.&quot;</p>

<p>The FBI and Manhattan DA&apos;s office are currently investigating the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161007060258/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/22/nyclass_subpoenaed.php">six-figure donations NYCLASS made</a> to de Blasio&apos;s non-profit, Campaign For One New York, that existed to push his signature initiatives.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161007060258/http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2016/05/23/nyc-carriage-horse-rate-hike-.html">The Mayor&apos;s office said</a>, &quot;This raise is nothing more than the byproduct of a City Council bill that passed several years ago. No mayor has done more to protect horses and this rate increase does not stand in the way of the mayor&apos;s steadfast commitment to removing carriages from city streets.&quot;</p>
