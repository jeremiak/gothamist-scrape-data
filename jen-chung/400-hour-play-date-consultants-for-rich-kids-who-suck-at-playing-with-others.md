<p>Rich people do the darndest things! They buy $6.5 million apartments <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430052654/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/28/tiger_mom_real_estate_edition_chine.php">for their two-year-olds</a> (and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430052654/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/19/95_million_manhattan_apartments_wil.php">$95 million penthouses</a> for themselves). They <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430052654/http://gothamist.com/2013/05/14/are_rich_moms_using_disabled_guides.php">hire disabled guides to cut the line</a> at Disney World. They <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430052654/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/06/hilarious_ny_times_article_examines.php">venture below 59th Street</a>. And, now, they are paying $400/hour to &quot;recreation&quot; experts to help their toddlers to learn how to play with others.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430052654/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/muffy_can_play_AP6ELbpb1BiTQgonhOrCTJ?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Local">The Post has details on this trend</a>, which appeals to parents who are set on sending their kids to private schools like Trinity and Horace Mann:</p><blockquote>These pricy pre-planned play times are monitored by instructors who teach them the proper way to socialize with their well-heeled peers in order to maximize their chances of getting into New York&#x2019;s elite private schools.<p></p>

<p>&#x201C;Some kids need a little bit more work&#x201D; at learning how to play, said Suzanne Rheault, the CEO of one of the firms that organize play dates, called Aristotle Circle. &#x201C;Sometimes [parents] hear from our experts that there are some areas to improve.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Rheault&#x2019;s pricey play dates involve groups of three to five 4-year-olds playing in a room. The experts closely monitor how the kids share crayons, color, follow directions in Simon Says, and hold a pencil.</p></blockquote>Why are these kids so crappy at playing with others? It&apos;s because they have so many other classes, like Mandarin and music, that they have no idea how to be spontaneous. Isn&apos;t this really a cue for a nanny with a heart of gold?<p></p>
