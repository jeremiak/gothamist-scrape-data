<p>If you wanted to see &quot;The Scream,&quot; one of the most iconic images in the world, at the Museum of Modern Art, you have through Monday to do so! The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502152356/http://www.moma.org/visit/calendar/exhibitions/1330">exhibit ends on April 29</a>.</p>

<p>This 1895 pastel version by Edvard Munch, which has been at the museum since October, was purchased for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502152356/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/03/the_scream_sells_for_record_1199_mi.php">nearly $120 million last year</a> by the financier Leon Black. Black had bid for &quot;The Scream&quot; anonymously, but, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502152356/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304373804577521240470769420.html?mod=WSJ_hpsMIDDLENexttoWhatsNewsSecond">Wall Street Journal revealed him</a>, adding, &quot;His $750 million collection already includes drawings by Vincent van Gogh and Raphael, watercolors by J.M.W. Turner, cubist paintings by Pablo Picasso and ancient Chinese bronzes.&quot;</p>

<p>MoMA Chief Curator of Painting and Sculpture Ann Temkin says, &quot;The startling power of Munch&apos;s original work endures almost despite the image&apos;s present-day ubiquity. The visual subtlety and complexity of this composition can&apos;t be summed up in a clich&#xE9;.&quot; And fun fact: If you&apos;re a member, you get special viewing time&#x2014;9:30-10:30 a.m.&#x2014;before the museum opens.</p>
