Dupre was accompanied by Thomas &quot;TJ&quot; Earle, a NJ asphalt scion who lives 2 miles from Dupre in NJ...and who is very married. We guess she hasn&apos;t <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160630111114/http://gothamist.com/2008/07/09/ashely_dupre_is_moving_to_la.php">moved to LA</a> yet.</p>

<p>The Post reports the two retreated to the hotel after a &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160630111114/http://www.nypost.com/seven/07242008/news/regionalnews/kristen_finds_a_new_fun_guy_121302.htm">long day drinking, dining, shopping and snuggling together in limos</a>.&quot;  And there&apos;s judgment about Dupre&apos;s clothing: &quot;Earle quickly scooted off when he saw a photographer. He left behind Dupre, who casually strolled down Fifth Avenue, turning many heads with her revealing top and skirt, <strong>which seemed better suited to a night servicing a client than to a day shopping in Midtown</strong>.&quot; Hey, it was hot yesterday!</p>

<p>Earle refused to answer questions when he arrived back in NJ, but a neighbor told the Post Earle&apos;s wife (and the mother of their two children) is &quot;prettier by leaps and bounds&quot; than Dupre.  In other news, Spitzer was &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160630111114/http://www.nypost.com/seven/07242008/gossip/pagesix/a_rod_shops_121229.htm">greeted by snickers and smirks</a>&quot; at the David Barton Gym on the UES.</p>
