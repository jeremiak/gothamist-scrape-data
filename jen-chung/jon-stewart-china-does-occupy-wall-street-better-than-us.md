<p>Protesters in Hong Kong <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510012944/http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/10/01/world/asia/hong-kong-protest-photos.html?_r=0">have cleared out</a> after tens of thousands flooded the central business district last week, and The Daily Show&apos;s Jon Stewart observes that it&apos;s gone from &quot;massive anti-government rally to listless teen hang.&quot; But he analyzed the overall tenor of the Umbrella Revolution <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510012944/http://theweek.com/speedreads/index/269401/speedreads-jon-stewart-on-hong-kong-protests-china-is-beating-us-at-both-the-occupy-and-the-wall-street">and found</a> the protests rather impressive: &quot;They&apos;re beating us at both the &apos;occupy&apos; and the &apos;Wall Street&apos; &#x2014; it&apos;s not fair.&quot;</p>

He did point out that the daughter of Hong Kong&apos;s leader, Chief Executive CY Leung, is even more insane than our American socialites&#x2014;22-year-old Chai Yan Leung <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510012944/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/hong-kong-head-daughter-mocks-taxpayers-article-1.1962103">told commenters on her Facebook</a>, &quot;This is actually a beautiful necklace bought at Lane Crawford (yes - funded by all you HK taxpayers!! So are all my beautiful shoes and dresses and clutches!! Thank you so much!!!!)&quot; 

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510012944/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2777527/Daughter-Hong-Kong-Chief-Executive-facing-calls-quit-pro-democracy-protesters-takes-Facebook-thank-taxpayers-buying-expensive-necklaces-shoes.html">Then she added</a>, &quot;Actually, maybe I shouldn&apos;t say &quot;all of you&quot; - since most of you here are probably unemployed hence have all this time obsessed with bombarding me with messages... Actually considering the standard of English I&apos;ve skimmed through at times I doubt you&apos;d even understand what the term &apos;social media platform&apos; means... it&apos;s okay - your mother still loves you.&quot;</p>

<p>Making matters worse for Stewart, the &quot;Umbrella Revolution&quot; was going to be the name of his next album:</p>
