Besides just calling the protesters <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111020040228/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/19/daily_shows_john_oliver_visits_occu.php">an unruly and scary mob</a>, some are wondering why there hasn&apos;t been any attention about the anti-Semitism at Zuccotti Park, which is what <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111020040228/http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/post/occupy-wall-street-does-anyone-care-about-the-anti-semitism/2011/03/29/gIQA43p8rL_blog.html">Washington Post blogger Jennifer Rubin did</a> after seeing a video from Emergency Committee for Israel, whose board members include <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111020040228/http://tpmmuckraker.talkingpointsmemo.com/2011/10/charges_of_occupy_wall_street_anti_semitism_find_audience_on_the_right.php">notable conservatives Bill Kristol and Gary Bauer</a>.   </p>

<p>Of course, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111020040228/http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2011/10/anti-semites_with_signs.html">Daily Intel points out</a> that lots has been said about the alleged anti-Semitism (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111020040228/http://mediamatters.org/mmtv/201110110012">Rush Limbaugh</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111020040228/http://www.theblaze.com/stories/another-anti-semitic-outburst-at-occupy-wall-street-%E2%80%98the-jews-control-wall-st-%E2%80%99/">Glenn Beck&apos;s site</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111020040228/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970203499704576625302455112990.html">Wall Street Journal</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111020040228/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/11/opinion/the-milquetoast-radicals.html">NY Times</a>, etc), plus, &quot;The ratio of outraged published reports or commentaries about anti-Semites at OWS to actual anti-Semites at OWS is probably about ten to one. This video [from ECI]... tries to portray the movement as anti-Semitic by bringing a video camera to the rally and filming four people holding up anti-Semitic signs or saying something anti-Semitic. One of them is featured twice.&quot;</p>

<p>One protester at Zuccotti Park <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111020040228/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2011/10/18/conservative-group-condemns-perceived-anti-semitism-by-occupy-wall-street-protesters/?utm_source=home&amp;utm_medium=dl&amp;utm_campaign=conflicting-signs">told WCBS 2 the claims of anti-Semitism seemed far-fetched</a>, &#x201C;My 65-year-old mother has been coming in from New Jersey to be with us here. She&#x2019;s going through foreclosure and bankruptcy. She&#x2019;s not a crazy anti-Semite; she grew up in a Hasidic household.&quot; Still, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111020040228/http://laist.com/2011/10/18/lausd_condemns_sub_who_called_out_b.php">videos like the Los Angeles substitute teacher who told Reason TV</a> the problem was &apos;the Zionist Jews who are running these big banks and the Federal Reserve, which is not run by the Federal Government, they need to be run out of this country&quot; don&apos;t help perception.</p>
