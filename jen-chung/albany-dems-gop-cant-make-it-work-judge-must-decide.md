<p>Sigh, of course, the State Senate Democrats&apos; and Republicans&apos; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506164158/http://gothamist.com/2009/06/15/senate_democrats_talk_about_sharing.php">power-sharing deal talks</a> totally collapsed yesterday, leaving the fate of the State Senate&#x2014;and important state legislation&#x2014;in the hands of Judge Thomas McNamara who had all but begged the Senators to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506164158/http://gothamist.com/2009/06/15/no_one_knows_wtf_is_going_on_in_alb.php">get their acts together and work it out themselves</a>.  State Senator Pedro Espada Jr. (D-Bronx), who helped create this morass <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506164158/http://gothamist.com/2009/06/08/democrats_lose_control_of_state_sen.php">after last week&apos;s coup</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506164158/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/2009/06/16/2009-06-16_legislature_punts_decision_to_courts_its_up_to_judge_to_straighten_out_the_state.html">said</a>, &quot;We need judicial intervention.&quot;</p>

<p>The stagnation is due to the fact that Espada&apos;s fellow momentary dissident Democrat Hiram Monserrate (D-Queens) decided, after voting the Republicans to the majority and Espada as Senate president pro tempore, to go back to the Democrats, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506164158/http://gothamist.com/2009/06/15/hiram_monserrate_tells_daily_news_h.php">creating a 31-31 tie</a>.  And because we have no lieutenant governor who would cast the tie-breaker (thanks, Spitzer!), it&apos;s a damn mess.  The Post <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506164158/http://www.nypost.com/seven/06162009/news/regionalnews/lets_settle_this__heads_or_tails_174482.htm">suggests flipping a coin</a>.  </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506164158/http://wcbstv.com/politics/albany.coup.nys.2.1045693.html">There was name calling</a>: Senator John Sampson (D-Brooklyn), the Democrats&apos; new &quot;conference leader,&quot; said, &quot;There was no agreement reached. We thought they were unreasonable,&quot; while Dean Skelos (R-Long Island), the majority leader elected after the coup, said, &quot;They should be docked pay. They should hand it back voluntarily.&quot; Senator Bill Perkins (D-Harlem) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506164158/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/16/nyregion/16albany.html?ref=nyregion">said</a>, &quot;Welcome to the circus.&quot;</p>

<p>Both sides are waiting to hear what Judge McNamara says.  Whatever the decision will be, it&apos;ll probably be appealed.  And we leave you with what Senator Martin Golden (R-Brooklyn) said of Monserrate&apos;s flip-flopping, &quot;<strong>If you lie with dogs, sometimes you get fleas.</strong>&quot;</p>
