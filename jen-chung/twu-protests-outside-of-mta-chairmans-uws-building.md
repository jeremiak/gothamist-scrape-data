										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:250px; "> <img alt="051010walder.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424122841im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jsaxena/051010walder.jpg" width="250" height="166"> <br> <i>MTA/Patrick Cashin</i></div> Last month, it was reported that MTA Chairman Jay Walder had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424122841/http://www.observer.com/2010/real-estate/jay-train-takes-c-train-mta-chief-buys-uws">purchased a $1.6 million condo</a> at Central Park West and 96th Street.  The three-bedroom abode is near five subways (the B/C and 1/2/3), not to mention a number of buses, which makes it easy for Transit Workers Union members to protest!  TWU Local 100 president John Samuelson <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424122841/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/08/12/2010-08-12_exclusive_twu_attacks_ceos_lifestyle__including_16m_condo__home_in_france_some_d.html#ixzz0wPJVsXNB">told the Daily News</a> that Walder&apos;s pricey home, high salary and vacation home in France &quot;demonstrates he&apos;s a rich elitist completely out of touch with New York City transit workers and riders.&quot;<p></p>

<p>Walder, a former London Underground executive and McKinsey consultant, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424122841/http://gothamist.com/2009/09/11/new_mta_czar_gets_confirmed_after_h.php">makes $350,000/year</a>. Even though Walder&apos;s had a middle-class upbringing when compared with previous MTA chairmen (hello, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424122841/http://gothamist.com/2007/05/07/mta_chairman_pe.php">Peter Kalikow</a>), Samuelson tells the News, &quot;How many transit workers or riders are able to vacation in the South of France and can buy a condo on Central Park West?&quot;  The News adds, &quot;The TWU also has asked Paris transit leaders to demonstrate at Walder&apos;s stone house in the rolling French countryside.&quot; </p>

<p>Walder only said that the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424122841/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local&amp;id=7604260">impending layoffs of hundreds of station agents</a> were &quot;extremely painful,&quot; and sympathized, &quot;They all have families. They all have lives.&quot; Of course, he&apos;s also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150424122841/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/10/mta_chair_calls_union_work_rules_a.php">criticized union work rules</a> in the past as being &quot;shameful.&quot;</p>
