</div></div>					<p>There are just <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170416133403/http://gothamist.com/2017/03/16/melissa_mccarthy_the_rock_jimmy_fal.php">five more new <em>Saturday Night Live</em> shows</a> left for the season, and Louis C.K. kicked off the final stretch with his fourth time as host. For his monologue, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170416133403/http://gothamist.com/2015/06/21/louis_ck_said_f_you_lorne_michaels.php">he didn&apos;t discuss pedophiles</a>. No, he covered racist animals&#x2014;as in, the animal is the racist&#x2014; as well as a topic <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170416133403/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/13/louis_ck_jerkoff_tips.php">near and dear to his heart</a>: White guy privilege. </p>

<p>C.K. noted that he&apos;s had a lot of success, but it&apos;s only been four out of his 32 years doing stand-up. And now he&apos;s staying in five-star hotels, where he&apos;s miserable and he&apos;s becoming the kind of guy who calls housekeeping to complain that his laundry wasn&apos;t delivered within 24 hours &quot;like it&apos;s in the Constitution that you get your laundry.&quot; And when someone in housekeeping seemed unconcerned about his plight, he recalled thinking, &quot;Listen, ma&#x2019;am, first of all, you can hear in my voice that I&#x2019;m white... And by the way, I&apos;ll defend that right now... Because look, it&apos;s wrong that white people get preferential treatment. It&apos;s wrong. But as long as they do, what&apos;s going on at this hotel? I&apos;m supposed to get the best because I&apos;m white, which is awful and wrong, but where is it right now?&quot;</p>

<p>The politics of the day were addressed by the cold open, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170416133403/http://gothamist.com/2017/04/09/watch_alec_baldwin_play_donald_trum.php">with Alec Baldwin as President Trump in coal mining country</a>, as well as in the <em>O&apos;Reilly Factor</em> bit with Baldwin <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170416133403/http://gothamist.com/2017/04/09/watch_alec_baldwin_play_donald_trum.php">as O&apos;Reilly and Trump</a>. Weekend Update also hit at on current events; when remarking how Steve Bannon was removed from the National Security Council, Colin Jost then showed images of Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump and said, &quot;This time he probably <em>can</em> blame the Jews.&quot;</p>

<p>One particularly lively sketch was set in The Tenement Museum, with a group of high schoolers visiting&#x2014;Kate McKinnon and C.K. were the actors playing vintage racist Eastern European immigrants but C.K. kept breaking because his accent was so terrible. </p>

<p>The pre-taped segments were great: One imagined Beck Bennett as the writer who created the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170416133403/http://gothamist.com/2017/04/05/jenner_pepsi_tone_deaf_ad.php">tone-deaf Pepsi ad with Kendall Jenner</a>, while the other was a wonderful short film about a clown performing for a grown man. A third sketch was a tribute to &quot;Scott,&quot; whose social media posts about social issues really made all the difference.</p>

<p>The musical guest was The Chainsmokers, about as far away from C.K. as one can get. Next week, Jimmy Fallon hosts with a solo Harry Styles as the musical act. </p>
