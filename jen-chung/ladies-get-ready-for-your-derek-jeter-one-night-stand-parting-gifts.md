                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140303214631/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2011_11_sjbasebll.jpg"> <img alt="2011_11_sjbasebll.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20140303214631im_/http://gothamist.com/assets_c/2011/12/2011_11_sjbasebll-thumb-300x300-681617.jpg" width="250" height="250" class="image-left"> </a> </span>After apparently <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140303214631/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/31/derek_jeter_minka_kelly_appreciate.php">getting back together</a> to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140303214631/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/01/derek_jeter_minka_kelly_continue_lo.php">appreciate some art in Paris</a> late last year, now it seems that Minka Kelly has sworn off the Yankees captain: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140303214631/http://www.nypost.com/p/pagesix/minka_wilmer_warming_up_kXprxJHqDru2icGn2h3iWK">Page Six says</a> she &quot;continues to spend more time with playboy Wilmer Valderrama.&quot;  </p>

<p>Sources tell the gossip section that &quot;the spark fizzled again soon after that [for Kelly and Jeter]. Kelly has since moved to LA, while Jeter has focused on spring training in Florida. &apos;<strong>She&#x2019;s single and having a good time</strong>,&apos; a source said of Kelly, adding that she and Jeter &apos;headed in different directions after Paris.&apos;&quot;  Valderrama is known as a terrible ex-boyfriend to starlets&#x2014;during a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140303214631/http://cityrag.com/2006/03/wilmer_valderra/">2006 interview with Howard Stern</a>, he said Jennifer Love Hewitt was &quot;an eight,&quot; Ashlee Simpson was a &quot;screamer&quot; in bed, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140303214631/http://blog.sfgate.com/dailydish/2010/07/28/wilmer-valderrama-still-regrets-candid-howard-stern-radio-chat/">Lindsay Lohan was a &quot;fan of waxing.&quot;</a> Oh, and he also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140303214631/http://www.marksfriggin.com/news06/3-27.htm">described taking Mandy Moore&apos;s virginity</a>.</p>

<p>Anyway, if Kelly and Jeter have split for good, this can only mean Jeter will be giving out the morning-after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140303214631/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/13/after_you_sleep_with_derek_jeter_yo.php">gift baskets complete with autographed baseballs</a>. Ladies, perhaps you should wear that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140303214631/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/17/smells_like_dugout_yankees_will_rel.php">Yankees perfume</a> and those <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140303214631/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/24/yankees_high_heels_the_fck_me_or_do.php">Yankees f*ck me shoes</a>.</p>
