title: Judge Rules For Retroactive Rent Rollbacks At Stuy Town
---

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2010_07_stuytownr.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623144751im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2010_07_stuytownr.jpg" width="210" height="187" class="image-left"> </span>As Stuyvesant Town gets <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623144751/http://gothamist.com/2010/06/23/stuyvesant_town_up_for_foreclosure.php">ready for foreclosure</a>, a judge has ruled that current owner Tishman Speyer and past owner MetLife must pay back tenants retroactive rent rollbacks. The Rent Stabilization association&apos;s counsel was unhappy that the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623144751/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/judge_rules_rollbacks_renters_retroactive_Fi3ma59FDH0zQ6U7aP80IM?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">definition of &quot;retroactive&quot; wasn&apos;t determined</a>, because &quot;Do the rollbacks go back one year? Four years? Ten years?&quot;</p>

<p>Also, critics of the ruling point out that some of the tenants who rented at Stuyvesant Town at (illegal) market rates are wealthy and don&apos;t deserve this windfall.  In other words, don&apos;t blame the building for illegally deregulated rent-stabilized apartments and trying to make a lot of money on rent!  It&apos;s believed that Stuyvesant Town tenants were overcharged by $215 million; their rents are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623144751/http://gothamist.com/2009/12/15/stuyvesant_town_peter_cooper_villag.php">currently rolled back</a>.</p>

<p>Tishman had been pursuing a settlement, but MetLife&#x2014;which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623144751/http://gothamist.com/2006/10/17/stuytown_sold_t.php">sold the development to Tishman for $5.4 billio</a>n&#x2014;wanted to dismiss the tenants&apos; lawsuit, claiming that &quot;it had relied in good faith on a 1996 advisory letter issued by the New York State Division of Housing and Community Renewal (DHCR), which concluded that owners could seek luxury decontrol of housing units receiving J-51 tax abatements, so long as the receipt of the benefits was not the only reason the units were subject to rent regulation&quot; (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623144751/http://www.law.com/jsp/nylj/PubArticleNY.jsp?id=1202464292284">New York Law Journal</a>). The tax abatements are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623144751/http://gothamist.com/2009/10/22/stuy_town_tenants_win_major_lawsuit.php">what got Tishman into trouble</a>.</p>
