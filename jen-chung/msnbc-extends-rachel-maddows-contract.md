<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131226025554/http://gothamist.com/2009/04/24/rachel_maddow_talk_show_host.php">MSNBC talk show host Rachel Maddow</a> will be staying on the cable network for a while, as she agreed to extend her contract past the 2012 election.  The length of the contract wasn&apos;t disclosed, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131226025554/http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/08/02/maddow-agrees-to-a-new-contract-with-msnbc/#more-69133">Media Decoder says it&apos;s &quot;several years.&quot;</a> Maddow said, &quot;I&#x2019;m really, really happy in this job and to have the chance to extend it for a few more years, especially with the year we&#x2019;re about to have, is a real blessing... This deal was about wanting more years doing what I&#x2019;ve been doing.&quot;</p>

<p>Keith Olbermann, who encouraged MSNBC to hire Maddow in the first place, had been making public statements about wanting to work with her again, now<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131226025554/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/21/keith_olbermann_is_back_and_deems_v.php"> that he&apos;s at Current</a>.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131226025554/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/rachel-maddow-extends-msnbc-contract-217737">According to the Hollywood Reporter</a>, Maddow said she hadn&apos;t spoken to Olbermann since his departure from MSNBC and was her usual self-deprecating self when &quot;she disputed the charactirization that she is the &apos;face&apos; of MSNBC. &apos;I don&#x2019;t think we&#x2019;re a one-face network,&apos; she said. &apos;I actually think we have a mutually supportive and pretty cohesive atmosphere. I think that we&#x2019;re working together well. We internally compete for ratings and bookings and all that stuff but it&#x2019;s mutually supportive. So I like it. It&#x2019; s a fun place to work.&apos;&quot;</p>

<p>MSNBC, which is reportedly in talks to have the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131226025554/http://gothamist.com/2011/07/21/rev_al_sharpton_will_probably_join.php">Rev. Al Sharpton on a 6 p.m.</a>, has recently signed The Nation&apos;s Chris Hayes (a frequent substitute host for Maddow) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131226025554/http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/08/01/hayes-to-host-msnbcs-weekend-morning-show/">to a weekend show</a> and is very happy with the ratings that Tulane professor Melissa Harris-Perry got while subbing for Maddow last week. </p>
