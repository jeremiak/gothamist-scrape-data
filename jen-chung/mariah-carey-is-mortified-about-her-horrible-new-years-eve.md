<p>Mariah Carey has finally spoken out about her <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016022710/http://gothamist.com/2017/01/01/mariah_carey_nye.php">disastrous New Year&apos;s Eve performance</a>, in which she appeared incapable of singing three songs on live national television. After her management team <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016022710/http://gothamist.com/2017/01/02/listen_all_yall_that_was_amazing.php">slammed Dick Clark Productions</a> for sabotaging her, Carey praised the late music and TV personality, before telling Entertainment Weekly, &quot;I&#x2019;m of the opinion that Dick Clark would not have let an artist go through that and he would have been as mortified as I was in real time.&quot;</p>

<p>The diva also said that the outpouring of sympathy has been helpful: &quot;My true fans have been so supportive and I am so appreciative of them and everybody in the media that came out to support me after the fact because it really was an incredible holiday season that turned into a horrible New Year&#x2019;s Eve.&quot;</p>

<p>During <em>Dick Clark&apos;s Rockin&apos; New Year&apos;s Eve</em>, Carey apparently couldn&apos;t hear any music&#x2014;her team says <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016022710/http://www.tmz.com/2017/01/01/mariah-carey-new-years-eve-performance-sabotage-emotion/">her earpieces weren&apos;t working</a> throughout the night and that producers didn&apos;t fix the situation. Backing vocals and music played as Carey tried singing, but repeatedly gave up and ad-libbed. </p>

<p>Dick Clark Productions fired back, calling accusations that they deliberately wanted Carey to stumble were &quot;defamatory, outrageous and frankly absurd. In very rare instances there are of course technical errors that can occur with live television, however, an initial investigation has indicated that (Dick Clark Productions) had no involvement in the challenges associated with Ms. Carey&#x2019;s New Year&#x2019;s Eve performance. We want to be clear that we have the utmost respect for Ms. Carey as an artist and acknowledge her tremendous accomplishments in the industry.&quot;</p>

<p>Still, Carey&apos;s manager Stella Bulochnikov <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016022710/http://ew.com/tv/2017/01/02/mariah-carey-nye-what-really-happened/">insisted to EW</a> that after the production crew changed the earpieces, they still didn&apos;t work, &quot;The second stage manager said, &apos;It doesn&#x2019;t work here in the tent, it will work on the stage.&apos; She said, &apos;Great, let&#x2019;s go to the stage.&apos;&quot; When Carey got to stage, the earpieces allegedly still didn&apos;t work, but another production person said they would work when they went live. But they didn&apos;t.&quot;</p><blockquote> So, right when it goes live, she can&#x2019;t hear anything. The ears are dead. They&#x2019;re dead. So she pulls them out of the ear because if the artist keeps them in their ears then all she hears is silence. Once she pulled them off her ear she was hoping to hear her music, but because of the circumstances &#x2014; there&#x2019;s noise from Times Square and the music is reverberating from the buildings &#x2014; all she hears is chaos. She can&#x2019;t hear her music. It&#x2019;s a madhouse. At the point, there&#x2019;s no way to recover.<p></p>

<p>On the third song when she could hear her track playing it was so bad she said, &#x201C;F&#x2014; it, I&#x2019;ve had enough.&#x201D;</p></blockquote>Bulochnikov, who said producer Mark Shimmel &quot;begged&quot; Carey to do the show (&quot;I&#x2019;m begging you to do this. America needs this moment after Donald Trump, etc.&quot;), says the show should have cut to a commercial when Carey first had troubles. &quot;We live in this viral world where anybody will do anything for a viral moment,&quot; she added.<p></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016022710/http://pagesix.com/2017/01/03/mariah-carey-to-blame-for-nye-disaster/?_ga=1.105289605.729017374.1480337807">Now a &quot;production source&quot; tells Page Six</a> that Carey was practically MIA during soundcheck: &quot;It was totally [Carey&#x2019;s] screw-up... Her assistant came out for the sound check, not her... All her dancers were in step. Everybody else onstage heard the track. Even without [the earpiece] there were eight speakers onstage. It was not the sound people.&quot; Another source claims that Carey was off to the side during the sound check: &quot;At the very end &#x2014; no more than four seconds &#x2014; she goes up and goes, &#x2018;La-da-dee-da... Everything sounds great. Love you, New York,&#x2019; and left.&quot;</p>

<p>In her interview with EW, Carey said the incident is &quot;not going to stop me from doing a live event in the future. But it will make me less trusting of using anyone outside of my own team.&quot; This may be easier now that Carey has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016022710/http://www.etonline.com/news/206323_mariah_carey_no_longer_working_with_creative_director_anthony_burrell_following_nye_performance/">reportedly fired her creative director</a>, Anthony Burrell. A source told Entertainment Tonight &quot;that Burrell&apos;s decision to move the backup dancers offstage &apos;left Mariah without any support,&apos; as backup singers can be a source of support and help an artist pick up cues if their inner earpieces don&apos;t work and they can&apos;t hear the music.&quot;</p>
