<p>Stone, who has worked for Richard Nixon, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160210154658/http://www.time.com/time/europe/magazine/2000/1204/cover_riot.html">organized protests</a> during the 2000 Election Florida recount, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160210154658/http://gothamist.com/2007/08/23/a_funny_thing_h_3.php">may or may not have</a> left a<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160210154658/http://gothamist.com/2007/08/22/crazy_phone_cal.php"> voicemail for Spitzer&apos;s dad</a> calling his son a &quot;phony, psycho piece of s---&quot;, tells the News, &quot;This is not a hoax, a prank or a publicity stunt..This started out being about Spitzer. But now that it looks like he won&apos;t run, Kristin still wants to use her celebrity to highlight a reform agenda.&quot; </p>

<p>What kind of reform? Well, Davis calls herself a &quot;natural Libertarian,&quot; hates taxes, wants to legalize prostitution and marijuana (hello, revenue), and supports gay marriage while being a card-carrying member of the NRA!  Stone, who says GOP candidate Rick Lazio is &quot;a turkey,&quot; is also plotting to get Davis&apos;s Penthouse Pet friends involved, &quot;We&apos;ll get four, make them notary publics and have them, suitably attired, collecting signatures [for Davis to get on the ballot] at Grand Central Station during rush hour.&quot;</p>

<p>For what it&apos;s worth, Stone, who also claims he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160210154658/http://gothamist.com/2008/05/25/roger_stone_spi.php">tipped off the feds</a> about Spitzer&apos;s prostitute-loving ways, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160210154658/http://stonezone.com/">is angry</a> that Spitzer is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160210154658/http://gothamist.com/2010/01/29/video_spitzer_pontificates_on_love.php">denying that he wore black socks during sex</a>: &quot;Three independent sources all confirmed he did it with his droopy calf-length socks on.&quot;</p>
