<p>Today, Mayor de Blasio faces a critical test: Will he be able to throw out the ceremonial first pitch at today&apos;s Mets home opener without embarrassing himself? He <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425231506/https://twitter.com/BilldeBlasio/status/450458020464455680/">Tweeted this photograph</a> (above) at Mets starter Dillon Gee, &quot;Hey @DillonGee35 - how&apos;s my form? #letsdothis #GoMets cc: @JoeandEvan&quot;</p>

<p>De Blasio will be heading to Citi Field this morning to get ready for the Mets game against the Nationals&#x2014;he has a media availability at 11:45 a.m. and then the first pitch is at 1:06 p.m. (though on de Blasio time, it&apos;ll probably be around 1:22 p.m.). He&apos;ll watch at least some of the game.</p>

<p>Throwing the first pitch on opening day is a rite of passage for mayors. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425231506/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/03/31/new-york-today-the-mayors-first-pitch/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_r=0">CityRoom has some history</a>:</p><blockquote>We asked Sam Roberts, a longtime reporter for The Times, to remember first pitches gone by.<p></p>

<p>&#x201C;Koch hated baseball, never stayed more than a few innings at most,&#x201D; Mr. Roberts told us.</p>

<p>&#x201C;Dinkins, of course, liked tennis most.&#x201D;</p>

<p>&#x201C;Giuliani was a die-hard Yankees fan.&#x201D;</p>

<p>(Yet he too threw out ceremonial pitches at Mets games.)</p>

<p>&#x201C;Bloomberg was pretty indifferent.&#x201D;</p>

<p>&#x201C;Mayors are traditionally booed,&#x201D; Mr. Roberts said. &#x201C;I can&#x2019;t remember one that actually was cheered.&#x201D;</p></blockquote>De Blasio may be booed for how he handled the snow, charter schools or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425231506/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/21/nyregion/de-blasio-gingerly-acknowledges-red-sox-allegiance.html?pagewanted=all">his allegiance to the Red Sox</a>.<p></p>

<p>Here&apos;s President Obama throwing out the first pitch of the 2009 All Star Game, and Fox News quickly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425231506/http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2009/07/14/obamas-ceremonial-pitch-star-game-barely-reaches-catchers-mound/">pointed out it barely made the catcher&apos;s mound</a>.</p>

<p>Of course, that was nothing like Jon Stewart&apos;s admittedly shameful performance for the Mets:</p>

<p>And a Mets FYI: Daniel Murphy won&apos;t be in the starting lineup because <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425231506/https://twitter.com/CBarcaSTJ/status/450626605640323072">his wife went into labor</a>.</p>
