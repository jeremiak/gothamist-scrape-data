<p>Thanks to a Pepperdine University student&apos;s Tweet, now everyone knows that Derek Jeter and Minka Kelly are sorta back together.  Jaime Olaez <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120104091248/http://twitter.com/#!/JaimeOlaez/status/152529694003175424">wrote on Thursday</a>, &quot;Just saw @minkakelly with her boo Derek Jeter at the Musee d&apos;Orsay in Paris, France. How&apos;d ya like the art, you two?&quot; giving tabloids a late 2011 gift of new news.</p>

They went to all the different floors; they looked at Van Gogh. Derek was very low-key and was wearing a black-and-gray sweater. Minka looked very pretty. She was wearing white jeans, a brown jacket and boots.&quot; Olaez added, &quot;The funniest part was seeing tourists walk by wearing New York Yankees hats on. And some people didn&apos;t even notice them!&quot;</p>

<p>In Page Six&apos;s item about the pair, the column also reminds everyone that Jeter&apos;s parting gifts to women he, uh, romances overnight is a<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120104091248/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/13/after_you_sleep_with_derek_jeter_yo.php"> gift bag including a signed Derek Jeter baseball</a> and other baseball paraphernalia.</p>
