<p>Yesterday afternoon, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031001055/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/03/nj_transit_offers_contingency_plan.php">after inciting concern for weeks</a>, NJ Transit and the union representing rail workers announced that they had come to an agreement to avoid a strike that would have sent 105,000 commuters into a tailspin. Union representative Stephen Burkert said, &quot;We have reached a tentative agreement... The crisis is averted. We thank our members for having faith in us.&quot;</p>

<p>The two sides had disagreed over wage increases: The union, which was later backed by a federal panel, said that NJ Transit should give an annual 2.6% salary increase for six and a half years, but the beleaguered transit agency says its costs are too high and the salary increase could have prompted a fare hike. Thankfully, the parties met repeatedly and reached an agreement, narrowly avoiding Sunday&apos;s strike deadline.</p>

<p>No details about the deal have been revealed (no immediate fare hike will occur, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031001055/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/12/nyregion/nj-transit-and-rail-workers-union-said-to-reach-tentative-deal.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;_r=0">but there may be others ahead</a>), but what is certain that is that the NJ residents who rely on NJ Transit won&apos;t have to deal with the contingency plan. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171031001055/http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2016/03/breaking_nj_transit_rail_strike_averted.html#incart_river_home">NJ.com reports</a>, &quot;The nation&apos;s third-largest commuter railroad system, NJ Transit had acknowledged that its contingency plans would only have been able to accommodate 38 percent of its riders on shuttle buses hired to run from five park and ride lots set up across the state. The remaining riders, nearly 65,000, would likely have funneled as many as 10,000 cars an hour onto roads within 25 miles of New York during morning and evening rush hours, officials had said, jamming them into the already congested Lincoln and Holland Tunnels, and George Washington Bridge.&quot;</p>

They don&apos;t want to hurt the customers and inconvenience them. You can tell when people are spoiling for a fight. Neither side was spoiling for a fight.&quot; Instead, he blamed the media for creating &quot;hysteria.&quot;</p>
