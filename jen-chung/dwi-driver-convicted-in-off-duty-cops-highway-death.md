Robert Derian, who had a blood alcohol level of 0.12, had been driving his Jeep on the West Side Highwaywhen he hit 29-year-old Eric Concepcion.</p>

<p>Concepcion was on his motorcycle, and prosecutors said that road rage caused Derian to hit Concepcion&apos;s bike.  Concepcion&apos;s body was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623150934/http://www.nypost.com/seven/05022008/news/regionalnews/dwi_cop_killer_blotto__witness_109090.htm">dragged 3000 feet</a> along the road <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623150934/http://gothamist.com/2006/08/15/offduty_cop_kil.php">in August 2006</a>.  Derian&apos;s lawyer said it was an accident and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623150934/http://www.newsday.com/news/local/wire/newyork/ny-bc-ny--motorbikefatals0514may14,0,5197100.story">claimed the police exaggerated</a> because the victim was a fellow cop.  Derian faces up to 15 years in prison.  </p>

<p>In a separate case of a drunk driver fatally hitting an off-duty cop who was riding a motorcycle, Kevin Casado <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623150934/http://www.nypost.com/seven/05152008/news/regionalnews/judgment_day_for_dwi_cop_killers_110929.htm">began his 2-6 year prison sentence</a> for vehicular manslaughter yesterday.  He had a blood alcohol level of 0.18 when he crossed the double yellow line and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623150934/http://gothamist.com/2007/07/03/offduty_cop_kil_2.php">plowed into Officer Alexander Felix last July</a> in Inwood.  </p>

<p>Felix, a 3-year NYPD veteran who had also been an auxiliary cop for years, had just spent the weekend painting his future baby&apos;s room.  Casado told the court, &quot;I am sorry from the bottom of my heart.&quot;  </p>
