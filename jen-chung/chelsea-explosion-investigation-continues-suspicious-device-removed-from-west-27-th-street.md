					<p>As law enforcement agencies continue to probe the cause of the &quot;intentional&quot; blast that injured <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016020319/http://gothamist.com/2016/09/17/chelsea_explosion.php">dozens of people on a Manhattan</a> block last night, surveillance videos showing the blast have emerged.</p>

<p>You can see the blast in two videos from Orangetheory Fitness, located at 124 West 23rd Street in Chelsea&#x2014;the explosion happened around 131 West 23rd Street. One is from the inside vestibule, while another is from the street. Pedestrians can be see running after the explosion:</p>

<p>The explosion could be heard and felt from blocks away. &quot;Scared to death. It was that &#x2014; it went right through you, it was shaking the earth. Like an earthquake, it was really loud. I never heard anything so loud,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016020319/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2016/09/18/chelsea-explosion-investigation-continues/">Soleil Filomena said to WCBS 2</a>. One resident <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016020319/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/manhattan/blast-rips-chelsea-street-started-running-article-1.2796382">told the Daily News</a>, &quot;It was red, orange in the middle. It was a circle of fire. The whole block shook. The fire was up in the air. People were running for their lives.&quot;</p>

<p>Ryan McMillen, who was headed to the subway with her wife and children, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016020319/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/manhattan/blast-rips-chelsea-street-started-running-article-1.2796382">said</a>, &quot;It felt like a pipe bomb. It wasn&#x2019;t huge. It was some sort of a bomb. It wasn&#x2019;t a car backfiring ... I still feel it in my chest.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Altogether, 29 people were hurt in the explosion, but there were no life-threatening injuries. Some injuries seem related to shrapnel; one pedestrian told the News he saw people with, &quot;pieces of little metal, like half an inch, into their body, their face.&quot; A damaged dumpster was seen at the scene, and the NYPD Counterterrorism Unit Tweeted another person&apos;s photo of it:</p>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016020319/https://twitter.com/hashtag/Update?src=hash">#Update</a> re: Explosion (photo) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016020319/https://t.co/AtqllF3JEZ">pic.twitter.com/AtqllF3JEZ</a></p>&#x2014; NYPDCounterterrorism (@NYPDCT) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016020319/https://twitter.com/NYPDCT/status/777325696150634501">September 18, 2016</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//web.archive.org/web/20171016020319js_/http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></center>

<p>However, at the press conference, authorities did not confirm the blast occurred in or near the dumpster. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016020319/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/18/nyregion/chelsea-explosion-new-york-city.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Fnyregion&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=nyregion&amp;region=rank&amp;module=package&amp;version=highlights&amp;contentPlacement=1&amp;pgtype=sectionfront&amp;_r=0">From the NY Times</a>:</p>

<blockquote>Video captured before the explosion shows a man crossing &#x201C;the street in the direction of where the device was found,&#x201D; the same official said. But no video had yet been obtained clearly showing anyone placing the device in the spot where it detonated.

<p>&#x201C;We don&#x2019;t understand the target or the significance of it,&#x201D; the police official said. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s by a pile of dumpsters on a random sidewalk.&#x201D;</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016020319/http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/17/us/new-york-explosion/index.html">CNN reports</a> that a couple driving through Chelsea had their car &quot;lifted up by the force of the blast, damaging the left side of the vehicle.&quot; David Martinez said, &quot;I was driving a car and next thing you know I felt an explosion. I just blacked out, next thing I know I&apos;m in an ambulance.&quot; His partner, Brenda Abero, is pregnant and was uninjured. Martinez added, &quot;[I] Thought I was close to not seeing my son again, that was the scariest part.&quot;</p>

<p>Mayor Bill de Blasio said last night, &quot;The initial indications is this was an intentional act.&quot; He added that it did not appear to be related to terrorism in nature: &quot;There is no specific and credible threat against New York City at this point in time from any terror organization.&quot;</p>

<p>Police found a suspicious device on West 27th Street between 6th and 7th Avenues, prompting them to send a &quot;precautionary&quot; warning to residents on the street to stay away from windows. The device, which did not detonate, was removed safely and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016020319/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2016/09/18/chelsea-explosion-investigation-continues/">taken to the NYPD firing range</a> in the Bronx. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016020319/http://nypost.com/2016/09/17/explosion-rocks-chelsea-in-new-york-city/">According to the Post</a>, &quot;Police sources described the secondary device as a cooker with wiring and a cell phone attached inside a plastic grocery bag, which had been placed inside a garbage can.&quot;</p>

<p>Another suspicious package at 28th Street and 5th Avenue turned out to be garbage. Because the investigation is ongoing, the 1 and 2 trains are skipping 23rd and 28th Streets (the 3 isn&apos;t running this weekend) and the E and F trains are skipping 23rd Street.</p>

<p>The next press conference is at noon. The NYPD is asking for any tips, photos or videos regarding the explosion&#x2014;you can call 800-577-TIPS.</p>
