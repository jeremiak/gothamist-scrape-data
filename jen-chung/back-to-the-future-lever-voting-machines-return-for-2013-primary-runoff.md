                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="2013_06_levermachine.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130913164238im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2013_06_levermachine.jpg" width="640" height="467"> <br> <i> Photograph by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130913164238/http://www.flickr.com/photos/marklyon/8163100107/">Mark Lyon</a></i></div> <p></p>

<p>Because of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130913164238/http://gothamist.com/2012/11/06/a_scanner_crappily_jammed_voting_sc.php">problems with the electronic scanners</a> seen in last year&apos;s general election, our old beloved rusty lever voting machines are back, thanks to Governor Cuomo. But don&apos;t think for a second that he&apos;s happy about it.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130913164238/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/exclusive-gov-cuomo-oks-lever-voting-machines-article-1.1393566?localLinksEnabled=false">According to the Daily News</a>, he &quot;reluctantly signed a bill giving the city Board of Elections authority to use the machines in primary and runoff elections this year, although he called it a &apos;poor solution&apos; to the agency&#x2019;s woes. &apos;Nevertheless, circumstances require that I sign this bill into law,&apos; Cuomo wrote in a memo accompanying his approval.&quot;</p>

<p>Basically, the NYC Board of Elections says it can&apos;t recount ballots or even reset the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130913164238/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/09/man_vs_machine_state_senate_wants_t.php">scary modern</a> scanners between the primary on September 10 and a possible runoff, which would happen a few weeks later <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130913164238/http://www.ny1.com/content/top_stories/185172/lever-voting-machines-can-be-used-this-fall--gov-says">on October 1</a>. Thank God the NYC BOE <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130913164238/http://gothamist.com/2013/02/19/should_new_york_bring_lever_machine.php">didn&apos;t throw the old machines</a> away! Everyone loves a lever:</p>
