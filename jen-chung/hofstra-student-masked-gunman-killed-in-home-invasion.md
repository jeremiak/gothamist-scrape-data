	<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left"> <img alt="2013_05_hofstram.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130609233822im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2013_05_hofstram.jpg" width="365" height="275"> <br> <i style=" width:365px; ;display:block"> Police outside the home, via WCBS</i></div> Around 2 a.m. today, police say that an armed man wearing a ski mask <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130609233822/http://www.newsday.com/long-island/nassau/cops-2-shot-dead-at-house-rented-by-hofstra-students-1.5281087">forced his way</a> into a Uniondale home where four Hofstra students reside&#x2014;and after police arrived, gunfire broke out, leaving a female student and the suspect dead.<p></p>

<p>Details are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130609233822/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2013/05/17/police-hofstra-student-armed-suspect-killed-during-uniondale-home-invasion/">very vague at this point</a>. What&apos;s known is that one victim <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130609233822/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local/long_island&amp;id=9105968">was allowed to leave the house</a> and go to an ATM for cash&#x2014;she ended up calling 911. It&apos;s believed the gunman was holding her friend at gunpoint until she returned. Police arrived at 2:29 a.m., and that&apos;s apparently when the shooting began.</p>

<p>A neighbor told WCBS 2, &quot;I came home last night 10 minutes before it happened and I heard screams. I ran outside and police officers were like, &#x2018;go back inside your house, go back inside your house.&apos;&quot; Another said, &quot;I heard people fighting. They were screaming; one girl it sounded like she was pleading for her life, it was really scary.&#x201D;</p>

<p>The home is just south of Hofstra&apos;s campus and there&apos;s an elementary school across the street. </p>
