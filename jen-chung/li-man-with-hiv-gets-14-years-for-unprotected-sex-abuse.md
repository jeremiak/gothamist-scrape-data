Oceanside resident Robert Musmacker, who knew he was HIV positive since 2005, had pleaded guilty to 25 charges, including reckless endangerment, criminal sex acts and endangering the welfare of a child, and was also sentenced to 15 years of post-release supervision.</p>

<p>Prosecutors claimed that Musmacker, 37, used gifts of cell phones, alcohol and marijuana to lure his victims.  One spoke at the sentencing yesterday: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508151233/http://www.newsday.com/long-island/suffolk/prison-for-hiv-positive-li-man-on-sex-abuse-charges-1.2126420">Newsday reports</a>, &quot;The man... said he found out from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508151233/http://gothamist.com/2009/01/09/da_accuses_sex_offender_of_exposing.php">news reports</a> after Musmacker&apos;s December 2008 arrest on sex abuse charges that the former independent newspaper delivery depot employee was HIV positive.&quot;  The victim, who was 16 when he had sex with Musmacker, said, &quot;He messed me up... I trusted him... Why would he do that to us?&quot; and added, &quot;I think he&apos;s going to strike again.&quot;  </p>

<p>Musmacker had tried to withdraw his plea, claiming the prosecutor &quot;coerced&quot; him, but the judge didn&apos;t allow it.  Newsday also noted that Musmacker&apos;s mother wept at the sentencing and shouted at his victim; she told reporters, &quot;The moocher lied.&quot;  </p>
