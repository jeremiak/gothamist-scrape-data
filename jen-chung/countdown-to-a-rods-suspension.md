                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="2013_07_arod1.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130801011245im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2013_07_arod1.jpg" width="640" height="433"> <br> <i> Alex Rodriguez earlier this month (AP)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>He may be working on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130801011245/http://www.nypost.com/p/sports/yankees/with_mlb_ban_days_away_rod_smiles_LfKyGtuboXb3wz6ukM5uNL">rehabbing his strained quad</a> but Yankees star Alex Rodriguez is either about to settle for a suspension or face a possible lifetime ban from MLB over his relationship with a Miami clinic that offered HGH to athletes.</p>

<p>Last month, it was rumored he could face a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130801011245/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/04/a-rod_could_face_100_game_suspensio.php">100-game suspension</a>. Now The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130801011245/http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/i-team/deal-a-rod-faces-historic-ban-article-1.1411133#ixzz2aSOxwc1">Daily News reports</a>, &quot;Armed with voluminous evidence they believe would warrant lifetime banishment, Major League Baseball officials hope to know by Monday if Alex Rodriguez will agree to a deal that would effectively end the Yankee third baseman&#x2019;s career but possibly preserve a big portion of the remaining $100 million on his contract. If Rodriguez and his representatives reject a deal, the embattled superstar&#x2019;s suspension could be announced as early as late Monday or Tuesday. A source close to Rodriguez said the player was sticking to his story that he has done nothing wrong and was unwilling to cut a deal.&quot;</p>

<p>A-Rod and the Yankees have been publicly squabbling about whether he can return to the game while he&apos;s recuperating from injuries. Conspiracy theorists say the Yankees&apos; reluctance <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130801011245/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/27/is_a-rods_yankees_baseball_career_a.php">may have something to do with insurance</a> while A-Rod haters say he just wants to cash out.</p>

<p>Apparently Rodriguez could be banned for life if he doesn&apos;t accept the settlement. And the settlement sounds pretty good: &quot;According to a source familiar with the discussions between MLB officials and A-Rod&#x2019;s representatives, if Rodriguez accepted a settlement that would call for him to be suspended for the rest of this year and the entire 2014 season without pay, he would still have a chance to collect the $60 million the Yankees would owe him from 2015 to 2017.&quot;</p>
