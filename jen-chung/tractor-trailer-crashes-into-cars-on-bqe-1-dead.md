The vehicles were Brooklyn-bound, and the collision caused the tractor-trailer to jackknife across the divider and hit a Queens-bound car.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120330064140/http://www.wnbc.com/news/16359831/detail.html">One person is dead</a> and two others are seriously injured.  Traffic was initially closed in both directions, but now there&apos;s one lane open in each direction.</p>

<p>There are still considerable delays.  Officials are investigating how the accident occurred.</p>
