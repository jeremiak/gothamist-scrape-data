<p>The incident happened at 3:45 a.m., when Norman Shields, 48, entered the home and got into a fight with his ex, Natasha Bivens, 31. (Shields and Bivens have a four-year-old girl.)  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717101026/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2013/06/10/police-l-i-teen-stabs-moms-ex-boyfriend-to-death-in-domestic-dispute/">According to police</a>, &quot;An armed intruder, who turned out to be an ex-boyfriend of a female occupant of the house, entered the home and engaged in a physical confrontation with the female victim and her new boyfriend.&quot; </p>

<p>Bivens tried to stop Shields from entering a bedroom. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717101026/http://www.newsday.com/long-island/suffolk/cops-boy-13-fatally-stabs-his-mom-s-attacker-1.5445532">Newsday reports</a>, &quot;Shields fired one shot from the revolver he was carrying, but no one was struck by the bullet, [Det. Lt. Jack] Fitzpatrick said. At that point, the son, whose name was not made public, stabbed Shields several times on the left side of his body with a kitchen knife... Bivens&apos; current boyfriend fled the house at some point, Fitzpatrick said.&quot;</p>

<p>Shields, who had an extensive criminal record, died at Brookhaven Memorial Hospital Center. </p>
