As WCBS 2 puts it, that includes &quot;firefighters and police responding to emergencies or calls to service.&quot;  Currently, those city departments are using about 11,000 free E-ZPass tags, so if the MTA gets its way, then the city would need to pay for the approximate 300,000 crossings each year. (The MTA also emphasizes it wouldn&apos;t stop responders heading to a scene.)  A spokesman for Mayor Bloomberg called it &quot;<strong>an underhanded attempt to increase the city&apos;s already large subsidy of the MTA by charging the city for responding to emergencies or performing other essential services.</strong>&quot; Uh, the city&apos;s subsidy to the MTA hasn&apos;t really changed since 1990, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027035508/http://www.nysun.com/new-york/report-state-city-subsidies-for-mta-flat-or/83901/">according to the IBO</a>.</p>
