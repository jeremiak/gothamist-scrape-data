<p>A Chinese food deliveryman was fatally shot in the head on a Staten Island dead end street last night. Residents say the street is notoriously known for violent robberies, with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160330171621/http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2014/04/driver_shot_dead_while_deliver.html#incart_m-rpt-1">one woman telling the Staten Island Advance</a>,  &quot;It&apos;s a set-up&#x2014;they call delivery people, and when they come out here, they rob them... This has happened half a dozen times, if not more.&quot;</p>

<p>Police say they responded to a report about a shooting at 8:45 p.m. in front of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160330171621/https://www.google.com/maps/place/244+Grandview+Ave/@40.633887,-74.165453,17z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x89c24da6747683d1:0x151882a8c348222f">244 Grandview Avenue</a>. They found a man in his 50s with a gunshot wound to the head. The victim was pronounced dead at Richmond Medical Center.</p>

<p>One local resident named <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160330171621/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/restaurant-delivery-man-shot-head-dead-end-staten-island-street-article-1.1742742">Infinite Grover told the Daily News</a>, &quot;It&apos;s a tragedy. It&apos;s crazy someone would do something like that. How much could he have on him, $40? This guy was just trying to make a living. I think someone used the address because the street&apos;s a dead end. They knew there was no place to go.&quot; However, the News reports, &quot;Police said it was not immediately clear if the killer had placed the order or if the victim was ambushed during a routine delivery.&quot;</p>

<p>And the woman who mentioned the previous incidents to the Advance added, &quot;No one wants to deliver here anymore&#x2014;there&apos;s a Chinese restaurant, a Mexican restaurant, none of them want to come... It&apos;s scary because I have 3-year-old twins and I&apos;m pregnant. There&apos;s gunshots all the time.&quot; <br>
