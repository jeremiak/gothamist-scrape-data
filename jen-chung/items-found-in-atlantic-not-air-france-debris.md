<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2009_06_afdeb.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811130413im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2009_06_afdeb.jpg" width="130" height="109" class="image-right"> </span>Brazilian air force officials say that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811130413/http://gothamist.com/2009/06/04/air_france_flight_likely_disintegra.php">debris found</a> in the Atlantic Ocean <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811130413/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8083474.stm">does not belong to Air France Flight 447</a>, which disappeared after departing Rio de Janeiro for Paris on Sunday night.  Brigadier Ramon Borges Cardoso said, &quot;It has been verified that the material did not belong to the plane. It is a pallet of wood that is utilized for transport. It is used in planes, but on this flight to Paris, there was no wooden pallet.&quot; Additionally, the oil slick seen in the water <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811130413/http://edition.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/americas/06/04/plane.crash/index.html">was not from the flight either</a>&#x2014;it was larger than the amount of oil from the flight. A French official said, &quot;The clock is ticking on finding debris before they spread out and before they sink or disappear.&quot; The cause of the plane&apos;s disappearance hasn&apos;t been determined, but Airbus <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811130413/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/05/world/europe/05plane.html?ref=world">warned about &quot;malfunctioning speed indicators&quot;</a> yesterday. And a Spanish pilot said he saw an &quot;intense flash of white light, which followed a descending and vertical trajectory and which broke up in six seconds.&quot;</p>
