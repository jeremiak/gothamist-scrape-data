<p>Mari Gilbert, mother of a sex worker whose disappearance led to the discovery of a serial killer&apos;s Long Island mass grave, which was filled mostly with slain prostitutes, died on Saturday. Upstate NY police arrested her daughter Sarra Gilbert, who was charged with murder. </p>

<p>Jersey City resident Shannan Gilbert, 24, went missing, last seen running from a client&apos;s home, in May 2010, and, during the search for her, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016015611/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/14/fbi_sends_in_spy_planes_to_search_f.php">investigators ended up</a> finding 10 bodies in Gilgo Beach over many years. While authorities believe that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016015611/http://www.newsday.com/long-island/gilgo-beach-murders-complete-coverage-1.11186664">one person is behind the deaths of the prostitutes</a>, they say that Shannan Gilbert&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016015611/http://gothamist.com/2011/12/17/li_police_confirm_body_found_on_oak.php">death is unrelated</a> to the serial killings. </p>

<p>Mari Gilbert, 52, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016015611/http://www.newsday.com/long-island/mother-of-shannan-gilbert-killed-daughter-charged-cops-say-1.12084633">who Newsday describes as</a> &quot;a vocal advocate for her daughter after Shannan&#x2019;s death,&quot; apparently went to daughter Sarra Gilbert&apos;s home in Ellenville, where she was fatally stabbed. </p>

<p>The family&apos;s attorney in lawsuits related to Shannan Gilbert&apos;s death told Newsday that Sarra Gilbert had been &apos;hearing voices for several days&quot; and didn&apos;t believe that she was competent, adding she was &quot;not in control of her own faculties.&quot;</p>

<p>Earlier this year, Mari Gilbert <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016015611/http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/12/us/new-york-shannan-gilbert-case/">demanded that the police </a>take her daughter&apos;s murder seriously: &quot;This is my daughter Shannan. She was not perfect. No one is perfect. But she was loved. She was cared for. She does not deserve to be forgotten.&quot; She also told Newsday, &quot;I was very angry, as any parent should be, but as time went by I kind of realized that maybe that was her destiny to help other families.&quot;</p>
