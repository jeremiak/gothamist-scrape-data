<p>Colliton, who had made $500,000/year at white shoe law firm Cravath, Swain &amp; Moore, had paid a women to have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150404235744/http://gothamist.com/2006/03/03/lawyer_on_the_l.php">sex with her underage daughters</a> and was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150404235744/http://gothamist.com/2006/03/03/lawyer_on_the_l.php">suspected of having a &quot;harem&quot;</a> of underage girls in a Manhattan apartment--while his wife and family lived in Poughkeepsie.  Colliton was found in Canada, because he used his American Express card and the card company then told Canadian authorities.  </p>

<p>Colliton claims he wasn&apos;t on the run at the time, &quot;<strong>You&apos;re not a fugitive if you sign into a major chain hotel using your driver&apos;s license and your American Express card.</strong>&quot; For further emphasis, he told the Post, &quot;They no longer entertain a presumption of innocence. Instead, American Express puts on its Batman suit and says, &apos;We&apos;ll tell authorities his every move.&apos;&quot;   After being detained in Canada (and mistakenly released!), Colliton was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150404235744/http://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/04/nyregion/04lawyer.html">found at the St. Mark&apos;s Hotel</a> with $10,000 in cash and $2,000 in...AmEx gift cards.</p>

<p>He has also sued his former law firm over pay and the Manhattan DA&apos;s office, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150404235744/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2008/07/21/2008-07-21_ratted_out_by_american_express_charges_p.html">explaining to the Daily News</a>, &quot;When people stop violating my rights, that&apos;s when I will stop filing lawsuits.&quot;</p>
