										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2010_07_esl.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160521000716im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2010_07_esl.jpg" width="200" height="178" class="image-right"> </span>Macy&apos;s wooden escalators at the flagship Herald Square location have claimed another phalange:  A four-year-old&apos;s finger was &quot;sliced off by one of the store&apos;s famous old wooden escalators,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160521000716/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/child_finger_severed_at_macy_zM0QYdSKIfu05uuAYCsp9J?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">according to the Post</a>.  </p>

<p>The paper says, &quot;Maxlee Gell was riding with his mother, Natalia, on the third floor shortly after 7 p.m. when he stooped to pick up a bottle of water he dropped and &apos;his finger got caught in the escalator.&apos;&quot;  Cops were able to put the severed finger on ice and take it to Bellevue Hospital, &quot;where doctors were attempting to reattach it last night.&quot;  Macy&apos;s had no other comment except to say that the escalators are &quot;properly maintained.&quot; However, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160521000716/http://www.wpix.com/news/local/wpix-escalator-danger-macys,0,7919883.story">WPIX ran a report last December</a>, &quot;According to department of buildings violations, the Macy&apos;s flagship store has been guilty of shoddy escalator upkeep for years. In just the last two - records show Macy&apos;s owes more than $48,000 for failed escalator inspections.&quot;  </p>

<p>The wooden escalators are certainly relics of another time&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160521000716/http://www.forgotten-ny.com/STREET%20SCENES/wood.escalator/wooden.html">Forgotten NY has a piece on them</a>&#x2014;and there have been previous injuries: In 2005, a little girl&apos;s finger<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160521000716/http://gothamist.com/2005/10/17/macys_escalator_defingers_child.php"> was sliced off</a> when she tripped on them and, in 2006, a two-year-old&apos;s thumb <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160521000716/http://gothamist.com/2006/12/25/macys_escalator.php">was nearly severed</a> during the Christmas rush.  Here&apos;s video of them in action:</p>
