According to WCBS 2, the violence broke out at Nostrand Avenue and Fenimore Street around 12:30 a.m. today: &quot;Police say it started over some sort of dispute.&quot;<p></p>

<p>Police are investigating the incident and do not have any suspects in custody.  City Councilman Charles Barron said, &quot;You can&#x2019;t keep shutting down youth centers. You can&#x2019;t keep a neighborhood this impoverished and not expect violence.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Yesterday&apos;s shooting occurred during a &quot;Freaky Friday&quot; party on Wyona Street.  A 20-year-old man was killed during the gunfire&#x2014;at least 20 shots were fired&#x2014;that was apparently prompted when two men bumped into each other.</p>
