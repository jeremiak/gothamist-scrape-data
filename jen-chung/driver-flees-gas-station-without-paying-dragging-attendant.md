										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2011_04_gasstat.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503154656im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2011_04_gasstat.jpg" width="240" height="180" class="image-left"> </span>A gas station attendant was dragged by a car when its driver fled.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503154656/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local/new_jersey&amp;id=8075705">According to MyFoxNy</a>, &quot;Security camera video shows the employee holding onto the side of a Nissan Maxima, desperately trying to stop the driver. That is because the driver apparently had pumped $20 worth of gas and then drove off without paying.&quot; The incident occurred at a Fort Lee, NJ Lukoil station near the George Washington Bridge.</p>

<p>Attendant  Hassan Karaca, 50, did not suffer serious injuries after being  dragged 50 feet to the edge of the highway. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503154656/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local/new_jersey&amp;id=8075705">A witness said</a>, &quot;He was trying to get the money and the guy tried to take off, so he just kind of latched on. It was a foolish thing for him to do because the boss always told him, if anybody drives off, just let them go.&quot;</p>

<p>Another witness says the same guys in a Maxima with NY plates have hit the station before (&quot;He said last week they paid for gas, but made off with two cases of water without paying&quot;) and that there have been other pump-and-run incidents.  Gas prices have been rising&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503154656/http://www.democratandchronicle.com/article/20110416/BUSINESS/104160323">they hit $4 in Connecticut</a> (the average in NY is $3.98).</p>
