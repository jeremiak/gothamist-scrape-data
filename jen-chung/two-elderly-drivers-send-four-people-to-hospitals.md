A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170406071252/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/queens/woman_injured_after_mercedes_plows_rpoSCF6XSmuK4qBDT3SvvO?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">deli worker said</a>, &quot;It was like a gust of air went past my face. We heard a crash and I turned around. She [the motorist] missed me by a foot &#x2014; near death.&quot;<p></p>

<p>In the Queens crash, the Post says a customer, pinned under the Mercedes, was freed by firefighters; she&apos;s in &quot;critical but stable condition with non-life threatening injuries to her head and legs.&quot;  The driver was also taken to a hospital or observation, but&#x2014;surprise, surprise&#x2014;she probably won&apos;t be charged.</p>

<p>As for the Brooklyn incident, the<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170406071252/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/10/28/2010-10-28_driver_79_hits_three_in_brooklyn.html"> Daily News reports,</a> &quot;The 79-year-old was spotted driving against traffic on Dumont Ave. in a 1996 Mercury van before he jumped a curb and hit a cable box at Rockaway Ave. in Brownsville about 6 p.m.... The aging motorist then jammed the gearshift into reverse and sped across the intersection - hopping onto the sidewalk and hitting three teenagers as they stepped out of a corner store.&quot; Then he tried to reverse, but crashed into a parked car.  The pedestrians and driver were taken to the hospital with non-life threatening injuries; the driver&#x2014;surprise, surprise&#x2014;&quot;was not expected to be charged.&quot;  Let the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170406071252/http://www.westport-news.com/opinion/article/Should-elderly-drivers-be-retested-399215.php">&quot;should the elderly retake drivers&apos; tests&quot; debate begin</a>.</p>
