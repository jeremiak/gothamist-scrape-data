<p>Less than two weeks after announcing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150512161018/http://gothamist.com/2014/11/15/lasker_rink_will_not_open_this_ice-.php">it would not open this season</a>, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150512161018/http://www.laskerrink.com/">Lasker ice skating rink</a> in Central Park will in fact reopen tomorrow!</p>

<p>The NYC Parks Department issued a press release, noting the &quot;successful completion of repairs to its refrigeration system.&quot; Parks Commissioner Mitchell Silver said, &quot;We are thrilled to welcome back Lasker Rink for this winter season. The rink is a beloved neighborhood destination during the winter months, and it offers a fun and exciting way to stay active and enjoy the cold weather.  I applaud all of the NYC Parks employees who worked diligently to make the needed repairs.&quot;</p>

<p>Donald Trump, whose Trump Organization operates the rink, also had a statement, &quot;I know how hard the Parks Department and Commissioner Silver worked on fixing the mechanical problems at the Lasker Rink&#x2026; A job well done. The Trump Organization looks forward to continuing to provide a first-class skating experience to the many skaters, from beginners, and recreational to hockey players and seasoned figure skaters.&quot; </p>

<p>According to the Parks department:</p><blockquote>Last week, NYC Parks and its Citywide Services Technical Division began working on repairs to the rink&apos;s valves and concrete slab to identify and fix the source of its leaks, with the hope of reopening the rink to the public.  The success of these efforts allowed the refrigeration system to once again start making ice which is allowing us to re-open the rink so New Yorkers can enjoy skating at Lasker Rink during this winter season.<p></p>

<p>All hockey games, practices and skating lessons are slated to resume on Monday, December 1, after the holiday weekend.  During the period that Lasker Rink was closed, the Trump Organization along with NYC Parks worked with the community and other area rinks to try to accommodate hockey and skating groups who call Lasker Rink home. </p></blockquote>Lasker Rink is located at 110th Street and Lenox Avenue in Central Park.<p></p>
