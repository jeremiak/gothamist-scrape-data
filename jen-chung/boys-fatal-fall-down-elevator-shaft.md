The boy, who was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506164635/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local&amp;id=6336808">apparently with a friend</a>, fell from the 11th floor (at 70 Clymer Street), <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506164635/http://www.wnbc.com/news/17230972/detail.html?dl=mainclick">which is about 110 feet</a>.  The boy was pronounced dead at Brooklyn Hospital; according to WCBS 2, &quot;sources believe the boy may have been trying to escape from the elevator after it became stuck.&quot;  <b>UPDATE</b>: Apparently the boy and his 8-year-old brother were in the elevator, on their way to school, when the elevator became stuck.  There have been multiple complaints about the elevators in the buildings; City Council member David Yassky said, &quot;I cannot express the profound sadness I feel over the tragic loss of life in Williamsburg this morning. NYCHA has assured me they are working to get to the bottom of this situation, and I urge them to investigate fully what happened. For now, my thoughts and prayers are with this boy&apos;s family and the Williamsburg community.&quot;</p>
