<p>A fascinating new series about LGBT cinema&#x2014;before it was &quot;officially&quot; out&#x2014;starts next week at the Film Society of Lincoln Center. <em> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160720214437/http://www.filmlinc.org/series/queer-cinema-before-stonewall/">An Early Clue to the New Direction: Queer Cinema Before Stonewall</a></em> will showcase 23 films and 25 shorts, all made before 1969 and the Stonewall riots, that show how subtly or surprisingly boldly auteurs and actors represented sexual and gender identities.</p>

<p>Among the selections are <em>The Wild Party</em> (directed by Dorothy Arzner and starring Clara Bow), <em>Persona</em> (directed by Ingmar Bergmann with Liv Ullmann and Bibi Andersson),  Ed Wood&apos;s <em>Glen or Glenda</em>, Katharine Hepburn and Cary Grant-vehicle <em>Sylvia Scarlett</em> and <em>My Hustler</em> from Andy Warhol. </p>

<p>Programmer at Large (and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160720214437/http://www.lightindustry.org/">Light Industry</a> co-founder) Thomas Beard said, &quot;The subject of early queer cinema has long fascinated me; this survey has, in a sense, been in the works for over a decade. Now, the result of those years of research is manifest in the 30 programs that comprise the series, and I&apos;m thrilled that audiences will have a chance to revisit classics like Hitchcock&#x2019;s <em>Rope</em> while they also discover the many rare items on offer, like Jacqueline Audry&apos;s <em>Olivia</em> and Gregory Markopoulos&#x2019;s <em>Twice a Man</em>.&quot;</p>

<p>Here&apos;s a trailer, created by Zach Clark, for the series:</p>

<p>Beard also tells us, &quot;Since the series brings together many different styles of moviemaking&#x2014;classical Hollywood cinema, documentary, experimental film, grindhouse fare&#x2014;my hope is that the program will appeal to a wide range of audiences. Each screening is essential in its own way, though there&apos;s one in particular that I&apos;d like to single out: Leontine Sagan&apos;s Weimar touchstone <em>M&#xE4;dchen in Uniform</em>, a stirring parable of authoritarianism and the first great film about lesbian love.&quot;</p>

<p><em><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160720214437/http://www.filmlinc.org/series/queer-cinema-before-stonewall/#schedule">Queer Cinema Before Stonewall</a></em> starts Friday, April 22nd and runs through Sunday, May 1st.</p>
