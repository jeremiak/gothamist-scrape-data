<p>The Yazzie family, brothers Lee and Raymond and sister Mary Marie, have been creating beautiful pieces&#x2014;from bracelets to belt buckles&#x2014;for decades in New Mexico. Lee and Raymond specialize in silve, gold and stone inlay work while Mary Marie focuses on fine bead- and stonework. </p>

<p>One of the most stunning pieces are Lee Yazzie&apos;s &quot;corn&quot; bracelets, bracelets that look like they could be plucked from the field. Yazzie told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510011928/http://www.tannersindianarts.com/">Joe Tanner</a> after finishing his blue corn bracelet, &quot;I suppose I don&#x2019;t have to be ashamed for spending seven months of my life creating one piece of jewelry. I was thinking to myself, &#x2018;It takes Mother Nature three months to grow one ear of corn.&#x2019; So I guess that makes me half as good as Mother Nature!&quot; He was inspired by his brother&apos;s corn harvest, &quot;One time after we got the corn from the field and shucked it, I saw all those colors. After observing them, I picked one up and looked at it and said, &#x2018;Wouldn&#x2019;t it be nice if I could take this ear of corn, spin it around my wrist, and wear it?&apos;&quot; </p>

<p>There are hundreds of pieces of jewelry from several members of the Yazzie family, and the museum notes that they will show &quot;how the family&#x2019;s art flows from their Southwest environs and strong connection to their Navajo culture. With historic pieces from the museum&#x2019;s collections, the exhibition places Navajo jewelry making within its historical context of art and commerce, illustrates its development as a form of cultural expression, and explores the meanings behind its symbolism.&quot;</p>

<p>And in case you realize that you must have some finely crafted jewelry, the museum will have a special &quot;Glittering World Gallery Store&quot; featuring Native and Navajo jewelry; there will also be a few trunk shows from dealers like Joe Tanner.</p>

<p>&quot;Glittering World: Navajo Jewelry of the Yazzie Family&quot; opens today and runs through January 10, 2016. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510011928/http://www.nmai.si.edu/visit/newyork/">National Museum of the American Indian</a> is at One Bowling Green, inside the Custom House, and it&apos;s free.</p>
