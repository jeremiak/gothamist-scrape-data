Renate Gonzalez and Mitchell Woo are facing the bittersweet task of closing this iconic New York institution on 22nd and 10th while actively looking for sites to open a new Empire Diner.&quot;</p>

<p>The Empire Diner&apos;s note (full note after the jump) adds, &quot;Inasmuch as the Empire Diner will no longer be in its original location, the plan is to bring the Empire Diner Experience to neighborhoods around the world.&quot;  Last November, news of the Empire Diner&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171011055240/http://gothamist.com/2009/11/12/empire_diner_will_end_with_coffee_s.php">eventual closing was revealed</a>&#x2014;the property&apos;s owner apparently didn&apos;t want to renew the lease and the company behind Coffee Shop in Union Square is taking over the prefabricated diner&apos;s space. </p>

<p>Gonzalez <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171011055240/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/04/25/2010-04-25_sticking_a_fork_in_empire_diner.html">told the News</a>, &quot;We&apos;re very sad. I&apos;ve seen kids grow up in the neighborhood.&quot; Last year, the Cheyenne Diner, which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171011055240/http://gothamist.com/2008/04/06/last_look_at_th.php">closed in 2008</a>, was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171011055240/http://gothamist.com/2009/09/15/cheyenne_diner_finally_carted_off_t.php">moved to Alabama</a> while the Moondance Diner, closed in 2007, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171011055240/http://gothamist.com/2008/01/07/moondance_1.php">went to Wyoming</a>.</p>
