					<p>A man and a woman were killed during the J&apos;Ouvert celebrations in Brooklyn earlier this morning. At least four other people were injured as well, as thousands gathered for this pre-West Indian American Day Parade festivity. </p>

<p>Just before 4 a.m., at Empire Boulevard and Flatbush Avenue, three people were shot: a 17-year-old boy, Tyreke Borel, died from a gunshot wound to the chest while a 66-year-old was shot in the arm and a 72-year-old woman was injured as she tried to get away.</p>

<p>Then, around 4:15 a.m., Tiarah Poyau, 22, died after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016021119/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2016/09/05/jouvert-brooklyn-shootings-stabbing/">being shot in the face</a>. </p>

<p>Near Ocean Avenue and Eastern Parkway, a 23-year-old woman was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016021119/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/NY-Injuries-in-Shootings-West-Indian-Day-Parade-Labor-Day-Route-Police-392324411.html">reportedly stabbed in the back</a> at 4:20 a.m. And a man in his 20s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016021119/http://pix11.com/2016/09/05/2-shot-during-jouvert-celebration-in-crown-heights/">was apparently shot in the leg</a> at Clarkson and Rogers Avenues around 4 a.m.</p>

<p>Two people were killed during last year&apos;s J&apos;Ouvert, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016021119/http://gothamist.com/2015/09/07/report_gov_cuomos_deputy_counsel_sh.php">including an aide to Governor Andrew Cuomo</a>. Last week, Mayor Bill de Blasio had promised a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016021119/http://gothamist.com/2016/08/31/jouvert_2016_preparations.php">&quot;massive NYPD presence&quot;</a> to ensure this would be &quot;the safest J&apos;Ouvert ever.&quot; The NYPD&apos;s 71st Precinct also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016021119/http://gothamist.com/2016/08/27/nypd_to_jouvert_revelers_do_not_sho.php">distributed a flyer telling revelers</a>, &quot;Do not shoot anyone. Do not stab anyone.&quot;</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="2016_09_jouv3.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016021119im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2016_09_jouv3.jpg" width="640" height="426"> <br> <i> Police presence (David Torres)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>A huge number of police officers were seen at the start of the parade, with many along the route just trying to keep the floats moving.</p>

<p>Prospect Heights resident Jill Roberts lamented <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016021119/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/people-shot-ouvert-parade-brooklyn-article-1.2778145">about the violence to the Daily News</a>: &quot;I feel like I didn&#x2019;t have a J&#x2019;Ouvert&quot; and said &quot;she wished authorities would &apos;tell these people to go home.&apos;&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;It&apos;s not safe,&quot; Roberts added.</p>
