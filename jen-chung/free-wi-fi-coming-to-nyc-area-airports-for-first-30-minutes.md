<p>Finally, JFK, LaGuardia and Newark Airports will be offering free wireless Internet&#x2026; for about as long as you can stream an episode of Arrested Development.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508153013/http://www.northjersey.com/news/free-wi-fi-planned-for-region-s-airports-1.1040723">The Record reports</a>, &quot;The Port Authority is expected to announce a plan today to offer free Wi-Fi access to passengers in all of its air terminals, addressing one of travelers&#x2019; most common complaints, two sources familiar with the proposal said Tuesday. But that largesse will still have its limits. Under the plan, free access will be capped at 30 minutes. After that, the tab will start running again.&quot;</p>

<p>The agency currently uses Boingo, which has provided reliably terrible WiFi to NYC&apos;s subways. </p><blockquote>The change reflects revisions in a contract the Port Authority signed with a Los Angeles-based company called Boingo back in 1999 that locked it into a pay model for 25 years. After being pressed by New York City officials and an airport advocacy group, the Port Authority and Boingo agreed to relax that pay scale, which currently charges customers $4.95 an hour or $7.95 for 24 hours, a source familiar with the negotiations said.<p></p>

<p>The change, if approved by the Port Authority&#x2019;s commissioners this morning, is expected to go into effect at the end of 2014.</p></blockquote>The Global Gateway Alliance found that JFK, LaGuardia and Newark were among the five of the country&apos;s 20 busiest airports that didn&apos;t offer free WiFi. Further, places like Central Park and the Newark Rail station do offer free Wifi. The Port Authority earned $725,000 in WiFi fees last year, but the free WiFi plan will reduce that by about two-thirds. <p></p>

<p>It&apos;s unclear whether Vice President Biden <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508153013/http://gothamist.com/2014/02/06/biden_says_laguardias_like_a_third.php">finds this plan third-world</a>.</p>
