Real estate developer Donald Trump <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111117115929/http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0908/13558.html">threw his hat behind John McCain</a> last night on Larry King Live.  He said he&apos;s known McCain for a while, &quot;Also, this is not the right time for tax increases. And Obama wants to increase your taxes drastically.&#x201D;  Politico points out, &quot;Well, maybe not your taxes. But certainly The Donald&#x2019;s: Obama would repeal President Bush tax cuts for households making more than $250,000.&quot;  (Trump, check out <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111117115929/http://www.factcheck.org/askfactcheck/would_obama_tax_my_profits_if_i.html">FactCheck.org</a>!) Trump went on to say he didn&apos;t understand why Hillary Clinton wasn&apos;t chosen as Obama&apos;s running mate and said, &quot;He should have chosen Hillary, It would have been a much different race, I believe. Right now, it looks to me like McCain is probably winning.&#x201D;</p>
