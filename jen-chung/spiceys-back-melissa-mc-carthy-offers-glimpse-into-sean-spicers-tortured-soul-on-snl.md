</div></div>					<p>With Melissa McCarthy&apos;s return to host <em>Saturday Night Live</em>, fans of her <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170516202136/http://gothamist.com/2017/02/05/melissa_mccarthy_plays_sean_spicer.php">instantly legendary Sean Spicer impression</a> eagerly awaited another portrayal. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170516202136/http://gothamist.com/2017/05/12/video_melissa_mccarthy_spicey.php#photo-1">Photos and video of McCarthy, as Spicer</a>, in midtown Manhattan, rolling around behind the White House lectern, also stoked expectations. So it was time for SNL&apos;s Spicer to have some sort of personal reckoning.</p>

<div><center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Spicer indicates he feels personally victimized in this job.</p>&#x2014; Maggie Haberman (@maggieNYT) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170516202136/https://twitter.com/maggieNYT/status/863089856033021952">May 12, 2017</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//web.archive.org/web/20170516202136js_/http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></center></div>

<p>Not only did the sketch involve a White House press briefing and Spicer&apos;s existential road journey, it ended up being the one where Alec Baldwin&apos;s President Trump and McCarthy&apos;s beleaguered press secretary finally meet.</p>

<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170516202136if_/https://www.youtube.com/embed/sbpUcfpbnrs" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>Sarah Huckabee Sanders, played by Aidy Bryant, stomped to the White House press briefing room to speak to reporters, confirming that she&apos;s daughter of Governor Huckabee and &quot;a big Southern hamburger&quot; and &quot;Yes, obviously I&apos;m as hilarious as my daddy.&quot; After she explained she was filing in for Spicer, who was fulfilling his commitment in the Naval Reserve, a reporter pointed out that he was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170516202136/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2017/05/10/as-trump-fired-comey-his-staff-scrambled-to-explain-why/?utm_term=.6dbec016d2dd">hiding in the bushes</a>. </p>

<div><center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Spicey among the bushes. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170516202136/https://twitter.com/hashtag/SNLLiveCoastToCoast?src=hash">#SNLLiveCoastToCoast</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170516202136/https://t.co/gn5MxwuIW9">pic.twitter.com/gn5MxwuIW9</a></p>&#x2014; Saturday Night Live (@nbcsnl) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170516202136/https://twitter.com/nbcsnl/status/863610485077417986">May 14, 2017</a></blockquote> <script async src="//web.archive.org/web/20170516202136js_/http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></center></div>

<p>McCarthy&apos;s Spicer soon took over the briefing, and when the NY Times&apos; Glenn Thrush (Bobby Moynihan) asked him whether Trump was &quot;unhinged,&quot; McCarthy spat out, &quot;Oh my God, Glenn, do I come to your job and slap the seven or eight hot dogs out of your mouth? You&apos;re really gonna ask me that? It&apos;s offensive... If he&apos;s crazy, he&apos;s crazy like a fox with mental problems.&quot;</p>

<p>On Trump&apos;s ties to Russia, &quot;Spicer&quot; said, &quot;Let me just put this whole Russian thing to bed once and for all: Trump is innocent. How do I know? He told me so. He hired lawyers to agree with him.&quot; And then dollies came out: McCarthy&apos;s Spicer took out Russian nesting dolls, with Donald Trump on the outside (&quot;He&apos;s the biggest one and the most beautiful&quot;); then Jake the Dog from Adventure Time who was James Comey; then a Maleficent nesting doll (&quot;Hillary Clinton&quot;); then Vladimir Putin, who was quickly hidden; a Slimer doll (Steve Bannon); and finally, at the center, a little Pikachu, who was Jeff Sessions. </p>

<p>When asked if Trump would fire him, McCarthy&apos;s Spicer said, &quot;He wouldn&apos;t do that. He&apos;s my friend.&quot; The reporter (Sasheer Zamata) said, &quot;If he&apos;s your friend, why does he make you come out here and humiliate yourself every day?&quot;</p>

<p>So upset by this realization, &quot;Spicer&quot; takes his motorized lectern on a road trip to New York City, &quot;I need to find Trump. I promise I&apos;ll talk better.&quot; Riding around the city to a soundtrack of &quot;The Only Living Boy In New York,&quot; McCarthy&apos;s Spicer is dejected when he sees a New York Post cover that says, &quot;Is Spicer a Goner?&quot; and ends up eating gum from the sidewalk. When he gets to Trump Tower, he&apos;s told that Trump is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170516202136/http://gothamist.com/2017/05/04/trump_nyc_visit_traffic.php">never there anymore</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, &quot;Spicer&quot; shows up at the Trump National Golf Course in Bedminster, NJ (&quot;A Golf Course Somewhere In New Jersey&quot;), where Baldwin&apos;s Trump reassured him that he&apos;d never replace him with Huckabee Sanders. &quot;She doesn&apos;t have your special spice,&quot; Baldwin&apos;s Trump says before demanding that &quot;Spicer&quot; kiss him. &quot;I&apos;m famous, it&apos;s okay.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Is this like <em>The Godfather</em> where you kiss me and on one ever sees me again?&quot; McCarthy&apos;s Spicer asks.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; Baldwin as Trump respond, and then they start making out. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170516202136/http://gothamist.com/2017/02/07/trump_spicer_mccarthy_snl.php">Someone won&apos;t be happy about that</a>. Let&apos;s keep in mind that Spicer previously said that McCarthy&apos;s impression <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170516202136/http://gothamist.com/2017/02/06/sean_spicer_snl_notes.php">was &quot;cute and funny.&quot;</a></p>
