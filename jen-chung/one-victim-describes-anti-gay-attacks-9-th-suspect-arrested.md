The 17-year-old victim, who remained with his back to the camera, told reporter Carolina Leid that he was a member of the Latin King Goonies and his fellow gang members targeted him after they found out he had a sexual encounter with a 30-year-old man, &quot;They said you a f----t or something? What&apos;s wrong with you? You crazy or something?&quot; <p></p>

<p>The victim was beaten and sodomized (the gang claimed he broke  a rule), &quot;They put me in the middle of the chair. They asked me &apos;are you gay?&apos; I was like &apos;nah.&apos; They was like &apos;you did this?&apos; I said &apos;yea.&apos; &apos;You did this with the gay guy?&apos; I was like &apos;yea.&apos; That&apos;s when they started hitting me. Like beating me up. I was there for like an hour.&quot; (Another 17-year-old and the 30-year-old <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509194120/http://gothamist.com/2010/10/08/seven_latin_king_members_arrested_f.php">were also beaten and sodomized.</a>) He also said he regretted getting in the gang and, when asked what he would do now, he replied, &quot;Stay in school. Stay in school. Do my stuff. Stay off the street.&quot; Here&apos;s video:</p>
