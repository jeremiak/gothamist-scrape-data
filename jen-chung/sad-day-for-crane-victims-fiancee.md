---

	
										<p>Today was going to Janine Belcastro and Donald Leo&apos;s wedding day.  But Leo, a crane operator, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426150630/http://gothamist.com/2008/05/30/breaking_manhat.php">died in last month&apos;s crane collapse</a> on the Upper East Side.  The Daily News says Belcastro&apos;s sister and friend <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426150630/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/2008/06/20/2008-06-20_crane_horror_victim__love_were_to_walk_d-2.html">have taken her on a trip this weekend</a>.  A friend said, &quot;She&apos;s still too upset.  It&apos;s still too much for her.&quot;  </p>
