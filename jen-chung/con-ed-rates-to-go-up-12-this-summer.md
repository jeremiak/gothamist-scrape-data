The typical apartment electric bill averages $74 but that will go up $12 from last summer. Businesses can expect a nearly 18 percent increase on their bill.&quot; Okay, start praying we don&apos;t have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170405002730/http://gothamist.com/tags/july2010heatwave">another heat wave</a>.<p></p>

<p>Con Ed says it asked the government to reconsider the ruling, and Mayor Bloomberg said, &quot;These utilities have to be profitable or they can&apos;t raise money and can&apos;t improve the service. It&apos;s also very hard on people and businesses to pay higher energy costs,&quot; said the mayor.&quot; He also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170405002730/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/mike_to_rate_lapped_nyers_turn_down_bLBlcAxLRmvTjAm870bObO">explained how New Yorkers can deal with the rate hike</a>, &quot;<strong>Use less energy and it makes the problem less of a problem</strong>... People say, &apos;Oh, that greeny stuff, oh that environmental stuff.&apos; Well, you can think of it as that, but another way to think of it is, short-term, it&apos;s reducing your energy bill.&quot;</p>
