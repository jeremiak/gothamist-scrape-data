Nessie can&apos;t wait to welcome her new baby brother. We are filled with many emotions as we look to the future, but the most important one is hope. We are very grateful to you all for your amazing support.&quot;</p>

<p>On October 25, 2012, Marina Krim had returned to her Upper West Side home with daughter 3-year-old Nessie, because Yoselyn Ortega didn&apos;t bring Krim&apos;s other children, 6-year-old Lulu and 2-year-old Leo, to a class. Krim entered her darkened apartment and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130729104025/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/26/uws_nightmare_mom_discovered_childr.php#photo-1">found Lulu and Leo stabbed</a> in the bathtub, with Ortega apparently trying to stab herself. The children both died while Ortega survived her wounds and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130729104025/http://gothamist.com/2012/11/03/nanny_charged_with_murder_in_killin.php">was charged with murder</a>.
