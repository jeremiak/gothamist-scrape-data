<p>The MTA is warning customers that they are not in any way affiliated with a website claiming it will help riders on NYC subways and buses, Metro-North and Long Island Rail Road with their lost items. Especially since the website requires personal information, which is then used to generate a bill!</p>

<p>While that seems like a no brainer, at least one poor guy got duped. A Metro-North rider, Dave Smith, was trying to find his misplaced 3D printed fantasy football helmet; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508161604/http://nypost.com/2014/06/12/scammer-bilking-travelers-with-fake-lost-found-website/">according to the NY Post</a>, &quot;Smith said he initially went to Grand Central to the lost and found, but was told he had to file a claim online first. When he Googled &apos;Metro-North&apos; and &apos;lost and found,&apos; he went to the bogus site.&quot; Smith said, &quot;I thought it was unbelievable that Metro-North is charging me $50. I was pretty upset about the whole thing. I thought it was a Metro-North site. I thought their new policy was you have to pay 50 bucks. It&#x2019;s a scam.&quot;</p>

<p>Here&apos;s what the MTA says about &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508161604/https://lostpropertynyc.com/">NYC Lost Property</a>&quot;:</p><blockquote>The website implies that it contacts the MTA on behalf of the customers seeking lost property. However, the MTA&#x2019;s lost and found offices do not do business with lostpropertynyc.com or any other third party company claiming to act on behalf of people who have reported lost items. The MTA&#x2019;s lost and found offices return lost items only to those claimants who can identify that they are the rightful owners of the property. <br>
 <br>
&#x201C;Anyone looking to submit a claim for lost property needs to go through the MTA&#x2019;s official website,&#x201D; said MTA Police Chief Michael Coan. &#x201C;There is no charge to submit a claim to any of the MTA&#x2019;s lost and found units.&#x201D;<br>
 <br>
The MTA Police Department has launched a criminal investigation into the website.  Because the website is also soliciting information from taxi and airport customers, and the MTA has notified the New York City Taxi &amp; Limousine Commission and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.</blockquote>Further, the MTA wants riders to know they can &quot;can submit a lost property claim free of charge and directly to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508161604/http://web.mta.info/mta/lost_found.html">MTA online</a>, by phone, or in person. There is no charge for submitting a lost property claim to the MTA&#x2019;s lost and found offices.&quot;<p></p>

<p>Last year, MTA says its lost and found offices &quot;received 67,320 lost items, and returned 34,572 of them to their owners while fielding more than 73,000 queries about lost items from customers.&quot;</p>
