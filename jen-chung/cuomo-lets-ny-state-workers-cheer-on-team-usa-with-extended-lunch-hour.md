I&apos;m approving an extra hour for lunch today: http://on.ny.gov/TeamUSA  #USAvGER pic.twitter.com/2TVnzqbY1A.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>Dear Coach Klinsmann, 

<p>I was pleased to read your letter providing American soccer fans with a form excuse to their boss requesting time off to watch the USA-Germany match today.</p>

<p>The State of New York stands strongly behind Team USA. Therefore, I am approving an extra hour of an extended lunch today for every New York State employee, beginning at 12:00 PM, so they can root Team USA on to victory.</p>

<p>On behalf of all New Yorkers, I wish you and the entire team the best of luck. New York believes that we will win.</p>

<p>Best regards,</p>

<p>Governor Andrew M. Cuomo</p></blockquote><p></p>
