</div></div>					<p>Hey, looks like Gisele Bundchen is taking <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405014449/http://gothamist.com/tags/giselebundchen">Brandon Jacobs&apos; advice</a>: The supermodel closed fashion designer Alexander Wang&apos;s show on Saturday&#x2014;sending the crowd into a frenzy&#x2014;but she wasn&apos;t very chatty!  </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405014449/http://fashionista.com/2012/02/alexander-wang-fall-2012-90s-supermodels-and-a-glossy-sheen/">According to Fashionista</a>, it only seemed like any other fashion show... until the Brazilian was spotted: &quot;The day quickly went from ho-hum to holy shit. Gisele was walking in the Alexander Wang show! <strong>She kept press at arm&#x2019;s length backstage, telling photogs and reporters (who obviously gathered around her chair like the fawning subjects we all are) that she wasn&#x2019;t giving any sound bites today.</strong> I&#x2019;m assuming she didn&#x2019;t want to hear the word &#x201C;football&#x201D; at all, after her <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405014449/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/06/gisele_bundchen_post-super_bowl_fre.php">little outburst from last weekend</a>. Instead we all watched as she flirted with Guido Palau while he did her hair in the usual limp Alex Wang way.&quot;</p>

<p>Uh, &quot;little outburst&quot;?  She basically <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405014449/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/07/boston_hates_gisele_bundchen_for_br.php">belittled all her husbands work colleagues</a>!  Anyway, Runnin&apos; Scared <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405014449/http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/2012/02/new_york_fashio_1.php">wasn&apos;t too into the outfit Bundchen modeled</a>&#x2014;&quot;Gisele closed the show in a black skirt slit all the way up the thigh and a bulky black leather coat, which the petite model was, unfortunately, drowning in.&quot;&#x2014;but people seemed excited just to catch a glance of Gisele (though <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405014449/http://www.observer.com/2012/02/&#x201C;please-stay-seated&#x201D;-for-alexander-wang-and-gisele-bundchen/">they weren&apos;t sure it was her</a>, because her name was left out of the program).</p>
