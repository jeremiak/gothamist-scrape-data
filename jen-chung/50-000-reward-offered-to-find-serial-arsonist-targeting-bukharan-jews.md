<p>Police have added two more fires to the series of arsons under investigation in Forest Hills, Queens. Seven fires have been started in empty homes under construction or renovation&#x2014;five of them in an area that&apos;s home to the Bukharan Jewish community. The NYPD hasn&apos;t classified them as hate crimes, which is upsetting some residents. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160427031656/http://www.thejewishweek.com/news/new-york/arson-forest-hills-ignites-fear-bukharian-enclave-0">One said</a>, &quot;If seven Jewish homes had been burned in France within a month, there would be much more of an uproar.&quot; </p>

<p>Early Sunday morning, a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160427031656/http://gothamist.com/2015/12/06/another_fire_breaks_out_in_forest_h.php">fire was set for the second time</a> at 112-35 69 Road; later in the evening, the police added two more incidents (listed as #6 and #7): </p><blockquote>Incident #1 - At approximately 1930 hours on Sunday, November 8, 2015 at 68-60 112 Street.<br>
Incident #2 - At approximately 2210 hours on Sunday, November 15, 2015 at 112-35 69 Road.<br>
Incident #3 - At approximately 1830 hours on Tuesday, November 17, 2015 at 108-43 66 Avenue.<br>
Incident #4 - At approximately 2312 hours on Wednesday, November 25, 2015 at 108-43 67 Drive.<br>
Incident #5 - At approximately 0018 hours on Sunday, December 6, 2015 at 112-35 69 Road.<br>
Incident #6 - At approximately 2227 hours on Tuesday, October 20, 2015 at 70-35 113 Street.<br>
Incident #7 - At approximately 2000 hours on Tuesday, November 10, 2015 at 108-13 67 Road.</blockquote>The NY Times wrote about the extravagant homes <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160427031656/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/05/nyregion/05forest.html?hp&amp;_r=0">being built by Bukharan Jews in 2008</a>, &quot;There, Bukharians have been tearing down the neighborhood&#x2019;s sedate Tudor, Georgian and Cape Cod-style homes, paving over lawns and erecting white-brick edifices that borrow from old Europe, with sweeping balustrades, stone lions bracketing regal double doorways, chateau-style dormers and pitched roofs, Romanesque and Greek columns and ornate wrought-iron balconies accented with gold leaf that glints in the sun.&quot;<p></p>

<p>Rafael Nektalov, the editor of The Bukharian Times, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160427031656/http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/07/nyregion/sunday-fire-is-fifth-to-demolish-bukharian-home-sites-in-queens.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;_r=0">told the NY Times</a>, &quot;Our people, they&#x2019;re hardworking, hard-building. We want to have a beautiful life in beautiful buildings.&quot; </p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160427031656/http://www.timesledger.com/stories/2015/50/fhfire_web__2015_12_11_q.html">Bukharian Jewish Center is offering a $50,000 reward</a> to find the arsonist, and the NYPD is offering a $2,500 reward. Aron Borukhov told the Times-Ledger &quot;that cops [should] put a patrol at every construction site and 360-degree-view cameras at every intersection... He explained that because there is a permit posted at construction sites showing who the owner is, the arsonist knows who owns the houses.&quot; He pointed out, &quot;These fires are so big they are affecting houses on both sides. It&#x2019;s not just construction sites that are being burned. It is a very dangerous situation.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Police released video of the suspect, seen at the site of incident #4:</p>
