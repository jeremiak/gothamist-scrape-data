<p>The MTA released the chilling video on Friday.  The footage, taken on March 4 at the Ronkonkoma station, showed a man punching a woman who got off a train.  He then proceeds to harass and physically hurt the woman for several minutes around the station before throwing her in the back of his car.</p>
