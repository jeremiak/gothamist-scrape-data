The horrifyingly high cost of higher education is on display at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150421080836/http://collegecost.ed.gov/catc/Default.aspx">a U.S. Department of Education website</a> which allows students and their parents <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150421080836/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/30/education/30collegeweb.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">compare costs at various schools</a>.  The most expensive four-year college on the list is Bates College in Maine, which costs $51,300 (including room &amp; board), but number four is NY&apos;s Union College at $50,439 (including room &amp; board); number seven was Sarah Lawrence ($41,968; no room &amp; board), eight is Vassar College ($41,930; no room &amp; board) and ten is Columbia University ($41,316; no room &amp; board).  Here&apos;s the top 20:<br><br>

Tufts University MA $40,342 <br>(*denotes that fee includes room &amp; board)<br> <br>

The NY Times explains the website &quot;[shows] the institutions with the highest and lowest tuitions, the highest and lowest percentage tuition increases over the last two years, and the highest and lowest net price &#x2014; that is, the actual price full-time students pay, including room and board, after financial aid like grants and scholarships are taken into account.&quot; And by the way, Bates complained about the results, noting that some schools&apos; room &amp; board is listed separately. &quot;Bates&#x2019;s average net price, taking into account financial aid, is below that of more than 400 other institutions. Bates&#x2019; percentage increase in tuition and fees over the last three academic years is lower than that of more than 800 other institutions.&quot;<br>
