<p>The NoMad, the one-year-old acclaimed (and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151008012549/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/02/inside_nomad_a_deluxe_new_restauran.php#photo-1">rather sexy</a>) restaurant, has one of the most talked-about dishes in New York City: A $79 chicken for two, &quot;whole-roasted for two: Foie gras, black truffle, brioche.&quot; (Well, the foie gras, black truffle and brioche stuffing is piped under the chicken&apos;s skin and there&apos;s a side of the legs in a rich sauce with morels.) Today, Jeffrey Tascarella, the restaurant&apos;s general manager, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151008012549/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/31/nyregion/how-to-get-a-table-at-nomad.html?ref=nyregion&amp;_r=0">told the NY Times</a> why diners can&apos;t take the carcass home at the end of the meal.</p>

<p>He explained, &quot;<strong>If we gave the carcass away, then we wouldn&#x2019;t be producing the sauce for the chicken.</strong> It&#x2019;s a fragile ecosystem. The carcass question doesn&#x2019;t happen that often. The &apos;where is the rest of the chicken?&apos; misconception happens a lot. We sell about 80 chickens a night and a lot of people want to know &apos;where is the rest of my chicken?&apos;&quot; He added, &quot;Just want to take this platform to say: we&#x2019;re serving the entire chicken.&quot;</p>

<p>There&apos;s a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151008012549/http://dinersjournal.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/06/19/one-dish-at-the-nomad/">step-by-step explanation of how the chicken is cooked</a> from the Times, complete with mouthwatering photos. And <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151008012549/http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-06-13/nomad-scores-with-78-chicken-skip-tasting-menu-review.html">Bloomberg News&apos; food critic</a> Ryan Sutton proclaimed, &quot;The chicken will rock your socks,&quot; and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151008012549/http://thepricehike.com/post/27338946201/new-yorks-most-expensive-chicken-is-now-even-more">felt the dish was still worth it after its price was raised</a> from $78 to $79, which means it costs $102 after tax and tip (for two, but without appetizer, dessert or drinks).  </p>
