<p>This morning, Mayor Bill de Blasio will announce that while the huge Stuyvesant Town-Peter Cooper Village <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160320001618/http://www.wsj.com/articles/stuytown-is-going-on-the-market-1445214626">is being sold</a> (yet again), 5,000 apartments will be kept for middle class families. </p>

<p>It&apos;s believed the 11,000+ unit complex, which sprawls from 14th and 20th Streets and from First Avenue to the FDR, will be purchased by the Blackstone Group for $5.3 billion. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160320001618/http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/20/nyregion/stuyvesant-town-said-to-be-near-sale-that-will-preserve-middle-class-housing.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;_r=0">The NY Times reports</a>, &quot;The sale, to the Wall Street investment firm and one of the country&#x2019;s largest landlords, includes an unusual regulatory agreement with the administration of Mayor Bill de Blasio that would ensure that a block of 5,000 apartments would be affordable for the next 20 years for families of teachers, construction workers, firefighters and others who have traditionally made their homes at Stuyvesant Town.&quot;<br>
</p><blockquote>Under the new agreement with the de Blasio administration, 4,500 apartments would be reserved for middle-income families. A family of three earning up to $128,210 a year, for example, would pay a rent of $3,205 a month for a two-bedroom apartment. An additional 500 apartments would be set aside for families making less. For example, a family of three earning up to $62,150 a year would pay about $1,553 in rent for a two-bedroom.<p></p>

<p>Still, more than half the apartments in the complex, which sits east of First Avenue between 14th and 23rd Streets, now lease at market rents, or more than $4,200 a month for a two-bedroom apartment, a prohibitive sum for many middle-class families.</p>

<p>In return for maintaining the affordable block, the city agreed to waive $77 million in mortgage recording taxes and to provide Blackstone with a $144 million low-interest loan through the Housing Development Corporation. Blackstone also agreed not to pursue a condominium conversion or to build new towers on the tree-lined property.</p></blockquote><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160320001618/http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-10-19/blackstone-said-in-tentative-deal-to-buy-nyc-s-stuyvesant-town">Bloomberg News adds</a> that 1,400 rent-regulated apartments that were due to expire in 2020 will now expire in 2025. <p></p>

<p>The development was first created for World War II veterans. </p>

<p>Blackstone&apos;s purchase price is $100 million less than the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160320001618/http://gothamist.com/2006/10/17/stuytown_sold_t.php">$5.4 billion Tishman Speyer paid for it in 2006</a>. (The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160320001618/http://www.wsj.com/articles/stuytown-is-going-on-the-market-1445214626">Wall Street Journal calls</a> the Tishman deal &quot;one of the biggest real-estate disasters of the financial downturn.&quot;) CW Capital took over when Tishman ran out of money.</p>

<p>The Times takes us down memory lane: &quot;[Tishman], who put in very little of their own money, infuriated tenants as they showered hundreds of residents with eviction notices. They renovated vacant apartments and rapidly raised rents.&quot; A state court even ruled that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160320001618/http://gothamist.com/2009/10/23/landlords_scared_stuy_town_ruling_w.php">Tishman&apos;s rent increases were illegal</a>. And the new tenants rolling in meant some <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160320001618/http://gothamist.com/2009/06/04/are_new_stuy_town_tenants_pooping_i.php">long-time residents had to deal with drunk neighbors pooping</a> in the hallway. </p>

<p>City Council Member and Stuy Town resident Daniel Garodnick told the Times, &quot;This deal achieves our core goals of preserving the community as a stable home for New Yorkers today and into the future. This time, the buyer not only has a more patient and stable investment structure, but goes to great lengths to preserve long-term affordability.&quot;</p>
