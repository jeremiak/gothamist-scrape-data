<p>During <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140707034058/http://gothamist.com/2014/07/03/photos_video_last_nights_wild_light.php">last night&apos;s pounding thunderstorm</a>, a facade under the Brooklyn Bridge on the Brooklyn side collapsed, injuring numerous people.</p>

<p>It happened at Washington and Prospect Streets, near the exit ramp to Tillary Street and Cadman Plaza. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140707034058/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/wall-collapses-brooklyn-bridge-heavy-flooding-article-1.1853001">The Daily News reports</a>:</p><blockquote>Jerome Dilligard, 52, said his wife noticed water seeping out from between the heavy stones as they waited for the rain to stop. Dilligard, a retired correction officer, decided to run for their nearby car.<p></p>

<p>As soon as he left, the wall collapsed &#x2014; burying his wife Teresa, and their 8-year-old daughter Kaylah, as well as his 30-year-old daughter LaToya Jackson, her son Khmani, 10, and little Kiarra in debris.</p>

<p>The baby was thrown to the street, her grandfather said.</p>

<p>&#x201C;A stranger picked her up,&#x201D; Dilligard said. &#x201C;They were right under the wall when it came down.</p>

<p>&#x201C;My wife had to dig them all out. It&#x2019;s a miracle they got out with their lives.&#x201D;</p></blockquote><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140707034058/http://nypost.com/2014/07/02/collapse-at-brooklyn-bridge-injures-5-people/">According to the Post</a>, &quot;The damage affected a roughly 25-foot-wide section of the fabled span&#x2019;s facade. There was no word on what caused the stones to loosen, detach and fall.&quot;<p></p>

<p>The Department of Transportation told the News, &quot;We will immediately conduct a full inspection of all the facades, and will continue to thoroughly inspect our entire bridge inventory.&quot;</p>
