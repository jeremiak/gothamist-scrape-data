<p>Yesterday, at 5:40 p.m., a cyclist and pedestrian collided on the West Drive in Central Park, near Olmsted Way. According to police, the collision occurred in the bike lane.</p>

<p>An NYPD spokesman said that bicyclist was going south in the designated bike lane near West 72nd Street while there was a pedestrian about 50 feet south of Olmsted Way who was &quot;standing or walking very slowly&quot; in the bike lane. The bicyclist crashed into the pedestrian, and both were knocked to the ground.</p>

<p>The spokesman added that the bicyclist, who was wearing a helmet, suffered abrasion and minor injuries while the pedestrian has non-life-threatening injuries. (A photographer on the scene said that the pedestrian appeared to have a head injury and seemed badly hurt.) Both were taken to St. Luke&apos;s Hospital.</p>

<p>No charges have been filed, but the NYPD&apos;s Collision Investigation Squad was on the scene. In the past, Central Park cyclists <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140626034454/http://gothamist.com/2012/08/09/psycho_cyclists_petrifying_central.php">have been characterized as &quot;psychos&quot;</a> with the bikers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140626034454/http://gothamist.com/2012/09/10/central_park_cyclist_crackdown_cont.php">being ticketed for not obeying traffic rules</a> in the park. Many cyclists have pointed out that pedestrians and runners routinely break the same traffic laws (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140626034454/http://chasingwheels.blogspot.com/2011/02/46-lights-of-central-park.html">by going through red light</a>s) or push them into car traffic. </p>
