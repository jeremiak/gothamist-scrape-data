Fossella, who was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629173216/http://gothamist.com/2008/05/02/fossella_dwi.php">arrested for the DUI</a> in Alexandria, VA last year, was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629173216/http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2009/04/jury_trial_to_begin_this_morni.html">originally going to appeal</a> his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629173216/http://gothamist.com/2008/10/17/vito_fossella_convicted_of_drunk_dr.php">conviction</a>, but instead will face the mandatory sentence of five days in jail.  <p></p>

<p>The DUI arrest was initially a small scandal for Fossella, who was NYC&apos;s only Republican Congressional member.  But then the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629173216/http://gothamist.com/2008/05/04/press_descends.php">press became curiou</a>s about the friend who picked Fossella up from the stationhouse&#x2014;especially since Fossella said  he ran the red light to take his daughter to the hospital (his wife and children live in Staten Island).  It turned out the &quot;friend&quot; was the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629173216/http://gothamist.com/2008/05/08/vito_fossella_a.php">mother of his young love child</a> and the whole brouhaha ultimately prompted Fossella to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629173216/http://gothamist.com/2008/05/20/vito_fossella_a_2.php">announce he wouldn&apos;t run for re-election</a>.  City Councilman Michael McMahon, a Democrat, eventually won the House seat.</p>

<p>Fossella has said he is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629173216/http://gothamist.com/2008/12/15/fossella_has_farewell_brunch.php">retiring from politics</a>, but remains a well-liked figure among Staten Island Republicans.  Recently, he was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629173216/http://www.politickerny.com/2750/fossella-makes-case-bloomberg">boosting Mayor Bloomberg for re-election</a>, &quot;If there ever was a time we need Mike Bloomberg representing all of us in New York City, it&apos;s this year, it&apos;s now.&quot;</p>
