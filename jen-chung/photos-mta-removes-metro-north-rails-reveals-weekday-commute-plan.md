The investigation into the crash is also continuing, with the MTA starting the process of basically rebuilding tracks.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427153226/http://new.mta.info/new-haven-line-service-changes-are-place-while-we-work-around-clock-rebuild-damaged-tracks">The MTA says</a>, &quot;Beginning Monday morning, a shuttle train will operate between New Haven and Bridgeport with an express bus to Stamford, where more trains are available for New York City-bound customers.  For intermediate customers there is local bus service to/from Bridgeport, Fairfield Metro, Fairfield, and Westport.  (There will be no bus service to Southport and Greens Farms) A fleet of 120 buses has been assembled from CT Transit, MTA Bus and local companies.&quot; </p>

<p>The transit agency also warned, &quot;Customers should anticipate longer travel times and crowded buses and trains.&quot; The full details are below. Governor Dan Malloy of Connecticut <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427153226/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/20/nyregion/delays-from-connecticut-rail-crash-likely-to-last-days.html?ref=nyregion">noted that with the Metro-North issue</a>s, there may be more drivers on the wet roads, &quot;If there&#x2019;s any way to stay home, please stay home&quot; and said, &quot;Residents should plan for a week&#x2019;s worth of disruptions.&quot;</p>

<p>Malloy added, &apos;&quot;Putting this into perspective, there are 30,000 daily commuters whose trips will be disrupted by this accident. If they all got on the highway, the highway will become a parking lot, and if a significant proportion of them get on the highway, traffic is going to be greatly slowed.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427153226/http://www.stamfordadvocate.com/news/article/Crash-probe-plumbs-crews-computer-data-4529066.php">Malloy allow suggested</a> that those who work in NYC should consider &quot;staying there for the duration of the disturbance.&quot;<br>
 <br>
Additionally, the MTA gave an update about cleanup: &quot;Two eight-car trains needed to be removed from the scene so that reconstruction of the track,   overhead power lines, signal and power systems could begin. At 9 p.m. Saturday night, the National Transportation Safety Board, which is investigating the incident, authorized the removal of the rail cars. As of noon Sunday, seven of the cars had been towed to Bridgeport Yard and the other nine had been re-railed. Three of those will remain on Track 2 just west of the incident until the track in front of them is replaced. Then they will be taken to Bridgeport Yard, where the NTSB investigation is ongoing.&quot;<br>
 <br>
The MTA must basically rebuild 2,000 of new track, which will take about two days (this involves &quot;clearing debris, plowing the &apos;ballast&apos; or loose rock that stabilizes the ties, laying new ties and fastening the rail to the ties, essentially building about 2,000 feet of all new track. This work is expected to take about two days&quot;) and testing power. Full service won&apos;t resume until well into the work week at soonest. </p>

<p>Full Metro-North service will not resume until well into the work week.</p><blockquote>Service Plan in effect for Monday, May 20 and until further notice:<br>
