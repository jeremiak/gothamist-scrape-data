<p>The NYPD Hate Crime Task Force is investigating the slashing of a dozen cars&apos; tires in Brooklyn, because the vehicles&apos; owners are all Jewish.</p>

<p>The tire slashings all occurred on July 1st at around 9 p.m., police say, noting that the male suspect &quot;[punctured] the tires of twelve (12) vehicles on Lefferts Boulevard between Troy Avenue and Albany Avenue&quot; in Crown Heights. The authorities also released video:</p>
