<p>Bridgeport authorities say that last month Cherelle Baldwin, 21, rammed her Pontiac G6 into Jeffrey Brown, 24, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130614070641/http://www.ctpost.com/local/article/Bridgeport-woman-charged-in-crushing-death-4592397.php">&quot;against a garage&apos;s cinder-block wall.&quot;</a>  Bridgeport police spokesman William Kaempffer said, &quot;There was a significant impact when he was struck. The vehicle pushed in the cinder-block wall more than 10 inches.&quot; </p>

<p>Brown was the father of Baldwin&apos;s two-year-old son (who was not in the car at the time of the incident), and the police had been called to their home on previous occasions for domestic violence complaints. According to the Connecticut Post, &quot;Accident reconstruction specialists from the Trumbull Police Department assisted Bridgeport detectives and determined that the Pontiac Baldwin was driving traveled about 100 feet, accelerating all the while, before plowing into Baldwin, Kaempffer said, adding that &apos;there was no sign she attempted to brake.&apos;&quot;</p>

<p>Police became suspicious because Baldwin <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130614070641/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/connecticut-woman-crushes-lover-death-car-article-1.1369435?localLinksEnabled=false">allegedly changed her story numerous times</a>. She is being held on $1 million bail. </p>
