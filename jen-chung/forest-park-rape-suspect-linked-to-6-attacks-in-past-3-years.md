A law enforcement source <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160308035306/http://nypost.com/2013/09/05/nypd-hunts-violent-sex-predator-in-queens/">told the Post</a>, &quot;The description is dead-on, so it&#x2019;s definitely this one guy.&quot;</p>

<p>All the incidents took place at Forest Park. The earliest incident was on March 25, 2011 at 9:15 a.m., near Park Lane South, when the suspect grabbed a 54-year-old jogger, threw her to the ground, put his hand over her mouth and tried to take off her pants. She managed to fight him off and flee. </p>

<p>Then on September 7, 2011 at 8 p.m., the suspect grabbed a 13-year-old, this time at Park Lane South near Myrtle Avenue. He threw her to the ground, police say, and covered her mouth while tried to take off her shorts. The girl also managed to get away. Nearly a year later, on August 15, 2012 at 1 p.m., a 34-year-old woman was attacked at Park Lane South near Woodhaven Boulevard; the suspect grabbed her from behind and fondled her breasts. Her screams scared him off.</p>

<p>A 40-year-old woman was jogging in the park on November 28, 2012 at 8 p.m. near Park Lane South and Myrtle Avenue when the suspect touched her with his exposed genitals before fleeing.</p>

<p>On March 29 of this year, a 23-year-old woman jogging in the park at 7:25 p.m. was hit with a stun gun in the neck and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160308035306/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/30/23-year-old_female_jogger_tasered_d.php">sexually assaulted</a>.</p>

<p>The most recent attack occurred on Monday, August 26, when a 69-year-old woman, who was jogging in the park at 4:30 p.m., was chatted up by a man who then <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160308035306/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/31/69-year-old_female_jogger_tasered_s.php">used a stun gun to incapacitate her before raping her.</a>  </p>

<p>Apparently the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160308035306/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/01/sketch_released_of_queens_rape_susp.php">sketch released on Saturday</a> of the recent attack suspect didn&apos;t match the suspect sketch for the March 2013 incident. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160308035306/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/queens/police-release-updated-sketch-sicko-raped-69-year-old-woman-jogger-queens-park-article-1.1446809">Daily News reports</a>, &quot;After re-interviewing the most-recent victim, cops amended the sketch.&quot;</p>

<p>According to the Post, &quot;There was a nearly a one-year gap between two of the attacks from 2011 to 2012 &#x2014; and some investigators believe that the sicko was targeting victims out of state.&quot; The source suggested the suspect could have been in jail during that gap, &quot;We&#x2019;re considering it may be a pattern with cases from other states or cities.&quot;</p>
