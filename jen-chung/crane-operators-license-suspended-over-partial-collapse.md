<p>After a 250-foot crane <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426150501/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/27/crane_collapse_in_lower_manhattan.php">partially collapsed and ended up leaning</a> against a Financial Street building on Saturday night, the Department of Buildings has suspended the license of the crane operator.  A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426150501/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/listing_crane_lowered_MtzqQIiIH2rrDjYNoIzHhL">DOB spokesman said</a> that Christopher Cosban &quot;failed to leave the equipment in the safest position possible&quot; when he left the work site.  Um, can all other crane operators PLEASE leave equipment in the safest position possible before you head home?</p>

<p>The crane was set up in a plaza across from 80 Maiden Lane and was being used to move AC units at the building.  When the crane partially collapsed, residents from five buildings&#x2014;80, 83, 90, and 100 Maiden Lane and 2 Gold Street&#x2014;were evacuated as the authorities examined the crane. And the cops really didn&apos;t want anyone in the area&#x2014;reader Adrian Hopkins sent us this video: </p>

<p>Residents were allowed to return after the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426150501/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/28/partially_collapsed_crane_gets_disa.php">crane was removed</a>. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426150501/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/29/nyregion/29crane.html?ref=nyregion">NY Times adds</a>, &quot;Investigators said Mr. Cosban&#x2019;s lapse &#x2014; he did not lower the boom as far as it could go &#x2014; contributed to the accident but might not have been the sole cause. They said that they were looking into whether mechanical failure was a factor and that they might issue further citations.&quot; And OSHA is also investigating; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426150501/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/03/28/2010-03-28_operator_of_crane_that_collapsed_in_manhattan_has_license_taken_away_by_city_bui.html">they tell the Daily News</a>, &quot;We are looking at its mechanical operation, how it was set up and how it was operated.&quot; </p>

<p>Fun fact: 80 Maiden Lane houses the offices of the Department of Investigations, the agency that investigates corruption, including that of buildings officials like James Delayo, who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426150501/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/24/crane_chief_takes_2-6_year_plea.php">pleaded guilty to taking bribes</a> while he was a cranes inspector.  A DOI spokesperson told the Times, &quot;The irony of this crane collapse is not lost on D.O.I. Logistically, D.O.I. won&#x2019;t have to go far to gather the facts.&quot;</p>
