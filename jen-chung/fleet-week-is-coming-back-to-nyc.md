<p>Thank you, sailor! Last year, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140407232045/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/24/new_york_city_fleet_week_officially.php#photo-1">Fleet Week was cancelled</a> because of those idiots in Congress, but now it&apos;s BACK, baby. The celebration of the country&apos;s sea services returns on May 21, running through May 27.</p>

<p>Navy, Marine Corps and Coast Guard Team released a statement:</p><blockquote>  It is an unparalleled opportunity for the citizens of New York and the surrounding tri-state area to meet Sailors, Marines and Coast Guardsmen, as well as witness firsthand the latest capabilities of today&apos;s maritime services. The week-long celebration has been held nearly every year since 1984, and it is anticipated that nearly 1,500 Sailors, Marines and Coast Guardsmen will participate this year.<p></p>

<p>In addition to public visitation of participating ships and military band concerts, there will be numerous exhibits and military demonstrations throughout the week showcasing the latest technology of the maritime services and the skilled expertise of our service members.<br>
