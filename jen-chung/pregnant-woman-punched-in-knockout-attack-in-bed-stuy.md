---

	
										<p>A man has been arrested for punching a six-months pregnant woman walking in Brooklyn yesterday. And video shows the attack was sudden, much like the so-called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171015105345/http://gothamist.com/tags/knockoutgame">&quot;knockout game&quot; assaults</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171015105345/http://nypost.com/2014/08/14/pregnant-woman-sucker-punched-in-knockout-game-attack/">According to the Post</a>, Jannatul Ferdous, 34, was walking down a Bedford-Stuyvesant sidewalk with her sister at 3:45 p.m. yesterday when Willie Stephens, 33, &quot;allegedly snuck up behind her and socked her in the head. Ferdous was knocked unconscious during the sudden attack, but neither she nor her child were critically injured.&quot; She was taken to Woodhull Hospital.</p>

<p>Her sister was able to call the cops and give a description, and police found Stephens and charged him with assault. Police sources tell the Post the incident appeared to be a &quot;knockout game&quot; attack, where victims are randomly targeted and then sucker-punched.</p>

<p>Earlier this week, a 72-year-old man was sucker-punched in the West Village. He&apos;s been in the hospital with bleeding of the brain and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171015105345/http://gothamist.com/2014/08/13/72-yr-old_attacked_in_west_village.php">police are still looking for two suspect</a>. </p>
