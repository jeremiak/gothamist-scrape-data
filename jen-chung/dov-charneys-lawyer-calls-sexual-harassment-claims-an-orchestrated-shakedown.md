<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2011_03_ijulia.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110425000713im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2011_03_ijulia.jpg" width="365" height="272" class="image-left"> </span>American Apparel founder Dov Charney is continuing to fight back against the sexual harassment accusations from former employees. Citing sexually explicit emails and photographs allegedly sent by the accusers, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110425000713/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/national/worker_sat_for_shutterbug_dov_E49qGFUMpK4yWS8hDqZWHO#ixzz1HirW4cIK">Charney&apos;s lawyer Stuart Slotnick says</a>, &quot;This is an orchestrated shakedown by a group of former employees that are friends and roommates, and who, not incidentally, happen to have the same lawyer.&quot; </p>

<p>Yesterday, emails and photographs allegedly sent from Irene Morales, the first ex-employee who sued Charney for $260 million (claiming she was kept as a sex slave), <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110425000713/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/25/dov_charney_says_accuser_sent_sexua.php">were revealed</a> (Gawker <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110425000713/http://gawker.com/#!5785877/sex-lies-and-the-dov-charney-lawsuit-+-documents/gallery/1">has some of them</a>), with some saying, &quot;Daddy&apos;s got a little naughty girl waiting for him,&quot; and another offering to &quot;be your little slave.&quot; Slotnick says <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110425000713/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2011/03/25/2011-03-25_american_apparel_ceos_lawyer_says_emailed_nude_photos_show_female_exemployee_was.html">that Morales had been &quot;stalking Mr. Charney</a> and acted inappropriately by offering him sex acts in exchange for material possessions and money.&quot;</p>

<p>The second plaintiff, Kimbra Lo,<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110425000713/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/24/dov_charney_is_racking_up_those_har.php"> claims that Charney lured her to his home</a> last December for an interview, which took place on his bed, and that Charney eventually forced her to perform sexual acts on him. (Lo had worked for American Apparel in a New York store and says Charney was interviewing her to be a photographer or model.) But <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110425000713/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/worker_sat_for_shutterbug_dov_E49qGFUMpK4yWS8hDqZWHO?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">Charney&apos;s lawyer says she was a willing participant</a>, and the Post details some photographs and other correspondence: &quot;Kimbra Lo, 19, is seen in some shots splayed on the bed with her eyes closed and head tossed back... Lo also sent a series of flirty e-mails and texts to Charney in the weeks following the steamy interview, including confessions that <em>Lolita</em> was her favorite flick. A few hours later, Lo and Charney had two phone conversations lasting a total of almost two hours, according to records provided to The Post.&quot; </p>

<p>Lawyer Eric Baum, who is representing both Morales and Lo, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110425000713/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2011/03/25/2011-03-25_american_apparel_ceos_lawyer_says_emailed_nude_photos_show_female_exemployee_was.html">told the News that he couldn&apos;t verify the photographs or emails</a>, but said, &quot;It is not unusual for victims of sexual harassment or assault to grow so demoralized that they feel the only value they offer is as a sexual object. That in no way means they deserved to be harassed and assaulted.&quot;</p>

<p>Yesterday, Brooklyn Supreme Court justice did not dismiss Morales&apos; lawsuit and delayed her final ruling, but did suggest that the two sides go to arbitration since Morales had a signed releases with the company before leaving (another of Charney&apos;s lawyers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110425000713/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/09/american_apparel_responds_to_sex_sl.php">told us</a> that she &quot;acknowledged in writing that she had no pending claims against the company and signed a severance agreement which included a full release of claims and an agreement to submit any future claims to confidential binding arbitration&quot;). </p>
