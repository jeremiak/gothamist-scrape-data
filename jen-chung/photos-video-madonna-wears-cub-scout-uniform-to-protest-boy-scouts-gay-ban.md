	<p>Last night at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604150813/http://www.glaad.org/mediaawards">GLAAD Media Awards,</a> Madonna presented an award to Anderson Cooper, to recognize the silver-haired CNN correspondent&apos;s work in promoting equality. But, as expected, the Material Girl stole the show by dressing up as a Cub Scout&#x2014;hat, shirt with badges, and shorts&#x2014;and saying, &quot;I wanted to be a Boy Scout but they wouldn&apos;t let me join...I think that&apos;s fucked up... I can build a fire. I know how to pitch a tent...I have a very good sense of direction. I can rescue kittens from trees... Listen, I want to do good for the community. <strong>Most importantly, I know how to scout for boys!</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>The Boy Scouts had come under fire for not allowing gay scouts or gay scout leaders; one of GLAAD&apos;s special guests was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604150813/http://sfist.com/2013/01/28/boy_scouts_do_an_about-face_on_gay.php">Jennifer Tyrell</a>, the openly gay den mother who was ousted because of her sexual orientation. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604150813/http://www.advocate.com/politics/media/2013/03/17/watch-madonna-wants-be-boy-scout-glaad-awards">Madonna also discussed bullying</a>, &quot;When I think about young kids today in America who are being bullied and tortured, who are taking their own lives because they feel alone and judged, [like] outcasts and misunderstood, I want to cry a river of tears,&quot; noting,  &quot;I have teenagers of my own now and the idea of them or any young person experiencing that kind of pain is unfathomable to me. It&apos;s an atrocity to me. I don&apos;t accept it.&quot; Oh, and she wants to start a revolution:</p><blockquote>[The bullying epidemic] is no different from a white supremacist hanging a black man from a tree before the Civil Rights movement. It&apos;s no different than a member of the Taliban shooting a young girl in the head for writing a blog about the importance of female education. It&apos;s no crazier than an Iranian gay man being hanged for falling in love with a man. I don&apos;t know about you, but I can&apos;t take this sh*t anymore. That is why I want to start a revolution. Are you with me? It&apos;s 2013, people. We live in America -- land of the free, home of the brave -- that&apos;s a question, not a statement.</blockquote>The pop star spoke for 10 minutes, before asking Cooper to get to the stage so she could pinch his butt.<p></p>
