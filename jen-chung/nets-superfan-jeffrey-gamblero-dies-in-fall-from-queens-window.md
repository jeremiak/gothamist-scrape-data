<p>Jeffrey Gamblero, whose love of the Brooklyn Nets got him <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170213072714/http://gothamist.com/2014/12/03/james_dolan_goons_msg.php">thrown out of Madison Square Garden</a> earlier this month, has died from injuries sustained from a fall. He <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170213072714/http://nypost.com/2014/12/14/nets-super-fan-in-critical-condition-after-two-story-fall/">allegedly jumped out of a window</a> at his father&apos;s Queens home on Saturday night. </p>

<p>Gamblero, born Jeffrey Vanchiro, was a colorful character and a season ticket-holder at Nets games, whose passionate fandom <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170213072714/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/03/sports/basketball/brooklyn-nets-wear-black-but-their-most-visible-fan-dresses-in-neon.html">earned him a NY Times profile</a>. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170213072714/http://www.netsdaily.com/2014/12/2/7325183/nets-fan-gamblero-brooklyn-neon-leg-ejected-madison-square-garden">Nets Daily had described him</a>, &quot;If you&apos;ve been to a Nets game at the Barclays Center, you probably know Jeffrey Gamblero. He is the guy in the Nets&apos; jersey, wearing neon usually, and glasses dancing around the lower level of the stadium. He is a positive influence on the game and is well received by most of the people attending the game.&quot; </p>

<p>Gamblero was apparently distraught after MSG guards accused him of hitting other spectators with his prosthetic leg (which other witness discounted) and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170213072714/http://gothamist.com/2014/12/03/james_dolan_goons_msg.php" "="">forcibly ejected him from a game last week</a>. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170213072714/http://nypost.com/2014/12/14/nets-super-fan-in-critical-condition-after-two-story-fall/">His fiancee Kristi Evans told the Post</a>, &quot;Regarding the fall, all I can say is that he has been dealing with the stress and trauma of what happened at Madison Square Garden... It&#x2019;s been tough for him since then. He wasn&#x2019;t a crazy fan hitting people with his prosthetic leg. That was a lie. He&#x2019;s a good man.&quot;</p>

<p>Video showed guards dragging Gamblero out of the arena. </p>

<p>Evans <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170213072714/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/15/sports/basketball/nets-superfan-jeffrey-vanchiro-is-on-ventilator-after-two-story-fall.html?_r=0">also said to the NY Times</a>, &quot;After that, he was a completely different person. He was paranoid. He was erratic. He was frightened. He was horrified. He was a bit delusional. He was having a lot of trouble sleeping. He couldn&#x2019;t sleep at all. When he would sleep, or try to sleep, it would only take about 10 or 15 minutes before he would jump up screaming covered in sweat.&quot; </p>

<p>Gamblero <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170213072714/http://espn.go.com/new-york/nba/story/_/id/12030579/brooklyn-nets-superfan-jeffrey-gamblero-dies-jump-window">did go to Friday night&apos;s game</a>, and told Evans that he would spend the night at his father&apos;s house on Saturday night. Evans told ESPN, &quot;He&apos;s never, ever exhibited any suicidal tendencies. He jumped out of the bed, ran down the hallway ... and then threw himself out of a window headfirst and landed on his head.&quot;</p>

<p>According to the Times:</p><blockquote>Vanchiro&#x2019;s fianc&#xE9;e, Kristi Evans, who was with Vanchiro&#x2019;s family at New York Hospital Queens on Sunday, said that Vanchiro was sleeping at his father&#x2019;s home on Saturday night. In an interview at the hospital, Evans said that Vanchiro&#x2019;s father told her that Vanchiro awoke apparently disoriented and leapt from the building. She said that Vanchiro sustained severe brain damage and a fractured spinal cord in the fall, and that his brain had stopped functioning Sunday morning. The hospital listed Vanchiro&#x2019;s condition as critical as of 11:45 p.m. Sunday.</blockquote>Last night, Evans said that Gamblero had died:<br>

<p>Nets CEO Brett Yormark issued a statement, &quot;On behalf of ownership and the entire organization, I am terribly saddened to learn about Jeffrey&apos;s death. A proud Brooklynite, Jeffrey was a passionate Nets fan and one of our most visible and loyal supporters. I was delighted that he joined the team on our trip to London last season and always enjoyed his enthusiasm while dancing and cheering during Nets games at Barclays Center. The entire organization expresses our deepest condolences to his family and friends. He will be missed.&quot; </p>

<p>The Nets will honor Gamblero during Tuesday night&apos;s game against the Miami Heat at the Barclays Center.</p>
