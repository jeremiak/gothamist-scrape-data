Last night the paper <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528200614/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/25/nyregion/25paterson.html?ref=nyregion">dropped a long article</a> about how a Bronx woman accused her companion, Paterson&apos;s longtime aide David Johnson, of abuse&#x2014;but then abandoned legal action after she was allegedly harassed by state troopers,<em> and received a personal phone call from the Governor. </em> The assault allegedly occurred in the unidentified woman&apos;s apartment, which she shared with her 13-year-old son, on Halloween night 2009. The Times had mentioned the attack <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528200614/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/17/nyregion/17aide.html?pagewanted=1&amp;ref=nyregion">in their first piece</a>, but now we get the full, appalling reveal:<p></p>

<blockquote>According to the woman&#x2019;s account, Mr. Johnson confronted her in their bedroom, choked her, tore her Halloween costume off, pushed her into the dresser and then continued to choke her with one hand. In her account, she screamed for Mr. Johnson to stop and then screamed for the help of a friend who was visiting. 

<p>The woman said Mr. Johnson first took one telephone from her to prevent her from calling the police, and then chased her into another room when she went to find a second phone. Mr. Johnson then turned to the woman&#x2019;s friend and told her to leave, &#x201C;if you know what&#x2019;s good for you,&#x201D; according to the woman&#x2019;s account.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>Johnson was gone by the time the police arrived. Less than 24 hours later, a member of Paterson&apos;s state police detail paid the woman a little visit, even though the incident was written up as second-degree harassment, a misdemeanor, and under NYPD jurisdiction. (This security detail, which is 200-strong under Paterson, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528200614/http://gothamist.com/2008/07/26/could_spitzer_be_charged_in_trooper.php">also carried water for Governor Spitzer</a> to &quot;spy&quot; on then-Senate Majority Leader Joe Bruno.) State Police superintendent Harry Corbitt <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528200614/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/25/nyregion/25paterson.html?pagewanted=2&amp;th&amp;emc=th">tells the Times</a> such meetings are standard operating procedure whenever a high-profile person was involved in this kind of incident, and insists, &quot;We never pressured her, at least what I was advised; we never pressured her not to press charges. We just gave her options.&quot;</p>
