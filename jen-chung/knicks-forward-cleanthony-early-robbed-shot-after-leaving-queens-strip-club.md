<p>Knicks player Cleanthony Early was shot in the leg during a robbery this morning. The forward was apparently held up as he was leaving a strip club in Maspeth.</p>

<p>Early had left CityScapes Gentlemen&apos;s Club around 4 a.m. with a woman and got into an Uber. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160507193137/http://nypost.com/2015/12/30/knicks-cleanthony-early-shot-outside-strip-club/">According to the Post</a>, &quot;The cab drove a short distance to Maurice Avenue before three cars boxed in the vehicle at around 4:20 a.m... That&#x2019;s when the band of ski mask-wearing men ordered everyone out of the Uber car and robbed Early of some jewelry and an undisclosed amount of cash.&quot;</p>

<p>One of the robbery suspects shot Early in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160507193137/http://abc7ny.com/news/new-york-knicks-forward-robbed-shot-after-leaving-queens-club/1140530/">the right knee cap</a> and then the group fled.
