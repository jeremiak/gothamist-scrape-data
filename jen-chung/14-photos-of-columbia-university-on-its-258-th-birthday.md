</div></div>					<p>The New York Public Library <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522150818/https://twitter.com/NYPLMilstein/status/225263627618361346">noted on Twitter</a>, &quot;Today in 1754: King&apos;s College opens in NYC, it will eventually be renamed Columbia University. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522150818/http://bit.ly/M6UYJQ">http://bit.ly/M6UYJQ</a>.&quot;  Which means the school is 258 years young as of today&#x2014;let&apos;s celebrate with a short lesson...</p>

<p>King George II chartered the school to &quot;promote liberal education.&quot;  King&apos;s College was  first located in a small school house in lower Manhattan, and in 1755, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522150818/http://www.college.columbia.edu/cct_archive/mar04/columbia250_3.php">Trinity Church presented</a> &quot;King&#x2019;s College with a parcel of land bordered by Church Street, Barclay Street, Murray Street and the Hudson River, and intersected by Park Place.&quot;  After that it moved to a three-acre site on Park Place, by the Hudson River in 1760. Then after a seven-year suspension between 1776 and 1783 (you know, the Revolutionary War), the school reopened in 1784 as Columbia College.</p>

<p>In 1857, the school moved to Madison Avenue and East 49th Street, the former Deaf and Dumb Asylum, as a temporary site. Columbia acquired 18 acres in Morningside Heights in 1892 and then finally moved there in 1897.  Now, the school is planning more expansion&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522150818/http://gothamist.com/2010/06/24/court_upholds_columbias_manhattanvi.php">17 acres in Harlem (aka Manhattanville)</a>.</p>
