<p>According to the NYPD, the first incident occurred at 8:15 a.m., on Wednesday, December 9, when the victim was on the southbound platform of the Atlantic Avenue station. Investigators says she &quot;noticed the suspect staring at her and following her around the station. The suspect approached her, grabbed her arm and told her to come with him. The victim refused and the suspect fled the scene.&quot;</p>

<p>Then, yesterday, December 15th, also at 8:15 a.m., police say the victim was on the platform again when &quot;the suspect followed her and once again attempted to persuade her to leave with him. The victim refused and the suspect fled.&quot; </p>

<p>But she was able to take photos of the man, who is now wanted for stalking.</p>
