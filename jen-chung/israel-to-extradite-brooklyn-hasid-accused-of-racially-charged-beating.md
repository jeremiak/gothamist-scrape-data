<p>Shuchat was part of the Hasidic civilian patrol Shmira, and Shuchat and other members allegedly beat Charles, the 20-year-old son of a police officer&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140905062322/http://articles.nydailynews.com/2011-05-30/news/29618798_1_nypd-cop-brooklyn-man-extradition-hearing">apparently Charles was first</a> &quot;doused him with pepper spray&quot; by a white man a bicycle and then &quot;Shuchat [jumped] out of a GMC Envoy and beating him in the back and arm with a nightstick.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140905062322/http://gothamist.com/2008/05/22/police_brace_fo.php">At the time</a>, Brooklyn DA Charles Hynes said, &quot;You can&#x2019;t have a group, whether it&#x2019;s the Bloods, Crips or Shmira, acting like vigilantes.&quot;  But in 2008, Shuchat&apos;s uncle <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140905062322/http://articles.nydailynews.com/2008-05-16/news/17898933_1_police-officer-police-fear-neighborhood-patrol">questioned all the fuss</a>, &quot;They are looking for a scapegoat because this was a police officer&apos;s son. The kid doesn&apos;t even have a broken arm! Does that warrant all this? They are treating my nephew like a murderer.&quot;</p>

<p>Charles&apos; father Moses Charles told the News, &#x201C;That&#x2019;s great. My son is finally getting the justice he deserves. The system is actually working.&quot;</p>
