</div></div>					<p>The Fire Department has introduced its new &quot;shipboard simulator&quot; which allows them to replicate conditions firefighters would face on a boat or a ship. </p>

<p>During the Tuesday christening ceremony for the &quot;Port Security,&quot; Chief of Department Edward Kilduff said, &quot;We now have the tools to better protect our coastline. And this will only enhance our collaborations with the Coast Guard and other agencies in New Jersey and Connecticut.&quot;  </p>

<p>NYC has 520 miles of coastline, and a FDNY press release explains, &quot;The four-story, 132 foot-long ship simulator, includes multiple training locations which recreate conditions firefighters would encounter aboard a vessel, including engine room fires, galley (kitchen) fires, oil tanker emergencies and fires on the ship&#x2019;s deck. It will be used by FDNY members whose response area includes the coastline, as well as other agencies throughout the area... Shipboard fires pose unique challenges to firefighters because of the layout, restricted maneuverability of the closed quarters, ships&#x2019; crew responsibilities and water supply challenges, as well as potential hazmat situations - all factors for which firefighters must be prepared in advance.&quot;</p>

<p>The simulator, which is at the FDNY&apos;s Fire Academy, was funded through a FEMA program.</p>
