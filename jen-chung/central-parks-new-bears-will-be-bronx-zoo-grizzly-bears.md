<p>Last year, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160803034115/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/28/gus_the_central_park_zoo_polar_bear.php#photo-1">Gus the Central Park polar bear died</a>, leaving a huge, igloo-sized hole in New Yorkers&apos; hearts. Finally, the Wildlife Conservation Society has announced who will be taking over the empty exhibit: Two grizzly bears who have been charming visitors to the Bronx Zoo.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160803034115/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/01/nyregion/central-park-zoo-prepares-to-welcome-grizzlies.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;version=HpHeadline&amp;module=first-column-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news">The NY Times reports:</a> &quot;Prepare to meet your grizzlies: Betty and Veronica. These bears are not exactly new to the city: since 1995, they&#x2019;ve been on display at the Bronx Zoo.&quot;</p><blockquote>But that&#x2019;s part of how they got the job; the society wanted seasoned pros.<p></p>

<p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s a new species and a new exhibit,&#x201D; said Jim Breheny, the society&#x2019;s executive vice president for zoos and aquariums. &#x201C;That&#x2019;s why we&#x2019;re sending Betty and Veronica down there. They&#x2019;re really solid, they&#x2019;re responsive animals, they really like each other, have great relationships with their keepers. And they&#x2019;re beautiful.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Zoogoers accustomed to Gus&#x2019;s morose paddling are in for a change. &#x201C;These guys will come when they&#x2019;re called,&#x201D; Mr. Breheny said. &#x201C;They&#x2019;ll take food, they sit up on their haunches to get people&#x2019;s attention.&#x201D; The bear area is currently being rebuilt for the grizzlies, who enjoy water but are not big swimmers.</p>

<p>&#x201C;We had to make the pool more shallow so that the bears would wade into it,&#x201D; Mr. Breheny said. &#x201C;Grizzlies are more like a kid sitting in a wading pool splashing around.&#x201D;</p></blockquote>Betty and Veronica will be in the exhibit in November, but don&apos;t get too used to them&#x2014;the Times adds that they&apos;ll be replaced by three orphaned grizzly bears from Montana.<p></p>

<p>As for why there aren&apos;t polar bears, the WCS&apos;s Jim Breheny explained, &quot;A lot of zoos have made polar bears the poster animals for climate change, so there&#x2019;s a shortage now.&quot; Anyway, look how cool the Bronx Zoo grizzly bears are!</p>

<p>Still, we love you Gus.</p>
