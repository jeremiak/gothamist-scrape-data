<p>Michael Keaton playing an actor famous known for portraying an iconic superhero? And with Ed Norton, Emma Stone, Naomi Watts and Zach Galafinakis&#x2014;directed by Alejandro G. I&#xF1;&#xE1;rritu? We&apos;re down with all of that, and so is the Film Society of Lincoln Center, which has chosen I&#xF1;&#xE1;rritu&apos;s <em>Birdman or the Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance</em> as its closing night film this October.  </p>

<p>Here&apos;s the description of the film:</p><blockquote>Birdman centers on one-time action hero Riggan Thomson, played by Keaton, who attempts to be taken seriously as an artist by staging his own adaptation of Raymond Carver&apos;s What We Talk About When We Talk About Love. Thomson, however, must contend with a resentful daughter (Stone), a scene-hogging narcissist (Norton), a vulnerable actress (Watts), and an unhinged girlfriend (Andrea Riseborough) for co-stars, a manager who is coming undone (Galifianikis), as well as his own inner demon&#x2014;the superhero that brought him fame, Birdman.</blockquote>New York Film Festival Director and Selection Committee Chair, Kent Jones, said, &quot;Birdman is a knockout. It&#x2019;s consistently surprising and inventive&#x2014;you think the movie is going in one direction and then I&#xF1;&#xE1;rritu shifts gears and takes you somewhere else completely unexpected: the movie is like an intricate machine generating greater and greater amounts of beautiful radiant energy. The entire cast is amazing and they mesh perfectly, but I have to say that Michael Keaton is astonishing. He&#x2019;s always been a terrific and, in my opinion, underrated actor. Here he gets the role he deserves, and he makes the most of it. And, it&#x2019;s a great Broadway movie.&quot;<p></p>

<p>And here&apos;s the teaser trailer: </p>
