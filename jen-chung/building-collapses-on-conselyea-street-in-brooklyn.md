</div></div>					<p>We hear that a four-story building at on Conselyea Street, between Union and Lorimer, in Brooklyn collapsed around 1:30 p.m. Some workers were trapped, but all have been rescued. There&apos;s a little confusion about where the collapse occurred&#x2014;we were hearing it was either 31 or 36 Conselyea, but, via the Department of Buildings website, there&apos;s a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408141048/http://a810-bisweb.nyc.gov/bisweb/OverviewForComplaintServlet?requestid=5&amp;vlcompdetlkey=0001281732">complaint for 34 Conselyea today</a>: &quot;NYPD REPORTED A BUILDING COLLAPSED 2 WORKERS TRAPPED.&quot;  (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408141048/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local&amp;id=7356353">WABC 7 says </a>it&apos;s 34 Conselyea, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408141048/http://wcbstv.com/topstories/brooklyn.williamsburg.collapse.2.1597394.html">WCBS 2 reports</a> 31 Conselyea, 1010 WINS <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408141048/http://www.1010wins.com/Partial-Bldg--Collapse-in-Brooklyn/6682162">doesn&apos;t give</a> a street number.)</p>

<p>One worker is in serious condition while the other three are in stable condition.</p>
