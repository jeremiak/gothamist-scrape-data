<p>Police are searching for a man accused of criminal mischief for striking a vehicle parked in Brooklyn repeatedly with a &quot;blunt object.&quot; </p>

<p>According to the authorities, the incident occurred at 5 p.m. on November 13th, 2016 in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016021742/http://www.nyc.gov/html/nypd/html/precincts/precinct_061.shtml">61st Precinct</a>, which covers Sheepshead Bay, Gravesend, Kings Highway, Homecrest, Madison, Manhattan Beach, and Gerritsen Beach: &quot;An unidentified individual used a blunt object to smash the victim&apos;s car window while it was parked on Ocean Court.&quot;</p>

<p>The smasher, who appears to be covering his face with an orange or red scarf/shirt, fled in a Mercedes with NJ license plates, police say. (The video has no audio, so it&apos;s unclear if the man was screaming anything along the lines of &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016021742/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZV_vpkVTNA">YOU SEE WHAT HAPPENS LARRY</a>.&quot;)</p>
