<p>NJ Transit said, &quot;NEC, NJCL, RVL and MidTown Direct trains are subject to up to 40-minute delays, and expected to escalate.&quot; Here are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170426034515/http://www.mta.info/news/2017/04/25/lirr-pm-rush-hour-update">details from LIRR</a>:<br>
</p><blockquote>LIRR customers can anticipate delays and cancelations this evening due to an Amtrak power problem in one of the East River tunnels. All westbound service to Penn is suspended. NYC Transit is cross-honoring tickets on the E  train at Sutphin/Archer, Union Turnpike, 71st Ave. and Penn Station, as well as on the 7 train at 61st St., Woodside, &amp; between Penn Station and Atlantic Terminal on the 2 and 3 trains. Customers can take the subway to Atlantic Terminal for additional service to Jamaica.</blockquote>Earlier today, Amtrak said, &quot;Customers may experience delays between New York and New Jersey due to ongoing track inspections and maintenance at New York Penn Station. We apologize to customers for any delays as a result of this work.&quot;<span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2017_04_pennstation1.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170426034515im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2017_04_pennstation1.jpg" width="640" height="367" class="image-none"> </span><p></p>
