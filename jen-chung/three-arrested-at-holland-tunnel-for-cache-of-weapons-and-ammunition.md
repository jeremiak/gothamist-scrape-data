<p>The two men, who are in their 50s, and one woman in her 20s, were stopped at the Holland Tunnel on the New Jersey side this morning when officers noticed a cracked windshield. </p>

There is no known threat.&quot;</p>

<p>Also: &quot;One of the suspects allegedly told authorities the trio was en route to Queens to try to save a friend who is on heroin and being held against her will. Police are looking for the possible woman in Queens.&quot;</p>

<p>The Port Authority Police say the investigation is ongoing. We&apos;ll update as more information becomes available. </p>
