<p>The trouble began when the three-pound dog&apos;s owner and her friends refused to pay extra because they were using off-peak tickets during the on-peak westbound train to Babylon.  Then the conductor &quot;noticed the dog, which was not in a cage... LIRR rules say animals must be &apos;properly confined for shipment.&apos;&quot; Enter the cops! </p>

<p>The resolutions: The humans agreed to pay additional money for traveling during on-peak hours and the cops &quot;arranged for a special dispensation for the dog so the woman could get to a doctor&apos;s appointment in Jamaica.&quot;  The party got on a later train.</p>
