<p>Four years after the world found out that a NJ couple had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502102503/http://gothamist.com/2008/12/17/no_shoprite_cake_for_baby_hitler.php">named their son Adolf Hitler</a> Campbell&#x2014;and their other children, JoyceLynn Aryan Nation and Honszlyn Hinler Jeannie&#x2014;a judge has decided that the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502102503/http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2012/05/superior_court_judge_says_nazi.html">kids do not belong with their parents</a>.  </p>

<p>Back in 2008, Heath Campbell, a &quot;Nazi fan&quot; and Holocaust denier who decorates his home with swastikas, and his wife Deborah wanted to get a cake from Shop-Rite for their son saying, &quot;Happy Birthday Adolf Hitler.&quot;  The store declined, prompting the Campbells&apos; outrage, with Heath Campbell pointing out, &quot;There&apos;s a new president and he says it&apos;s time for a change. Well, then it&apos;s time for a change. They need to accept a name. A name&apos;s a name. The kid isn&apos;t going to grow up and do what [Hitler] did.&quot; (WalMart ended up personalizing the cake for the couple.) </p>

<p> NJ authorities removed the children from the Campbells&apos; care in 2009, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502102503/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/19/baby_hitlers_newborn_brother_taken.php">court records indicated there was tangible evidence of abuse or neglect</a>&#x2014;both parents allegedly suffer from physical and psychological disabilities and are unemployed&#x2014;not because of their names as the parents insisted.  The couple&apos;s fourth child, a son born last year, was also removed from their custody.</p>

<p>Heath and Deborah Campbell are now separated  Heath Campbell continued to deny that he abused the children and says he last saw the children in 2011 and wants them back, &quot;If have to give up my Nazism, then so be it. I&#x2019;ll do it. [The kids are] more my heart and soul and everything than anything.&quot;</p>
