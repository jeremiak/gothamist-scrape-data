										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2010_10_cablevision.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422214506im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2010_10_cablevision.jpg" width="200" height="136" class="image-left"> </span>Cablevision and News Corp. are <em>still</em> feuding over transmission fees, a situation that has left millions of Cablevision customers in New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania without Fox programming, like, oh, football games, the ALDS baseball games, Glee, House, The O&apos;Reilly Factor and Good Day, New York <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422214506/http://gothamist.com/2010/10/16/news_corp_yanks_channels_5_9_from_c.php">since October 16</a>.  And given the current tenor of &quot;negotiations,&quot; it seems that these lowly customers may miss the World Series.  Well, unless they decide to (illegally) watch Fox programs online&#x2014;the media company claims that when a Fox employee with Cablevision service called Cablevision, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422214506/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/10/26/2010-10-26_taped_call_by_fox_employee_to_cablevision_nets_suggestions_for_fox_viewing_on_il.html">Cablevision rep told them which websites streamed Fox shows</a>!</p>

<p>According to the Daily News, the Fox employee taped his conversation:</p><blockquote>&quot;Is there anyplace I can get these games?&quot; the Long Island-based customer asks.<p></p>

<p>The rep first suggests the customer try adjusting his HD set, which would allow him to legally get the Fox signal over the air.</p>

<p>The rep then goes on to give out two websites where the customer might find the events. The sites do not have the right to broadcast games.</p>

<p>&quot;You can watch them online,&quot; the rep says. &quot;You know about that?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;They pretty much have all the games,&quot; he says, repeating the site URL. &quot;This is one I got in an email from here.</p>

<p>&quot;Thank God for the Internet, right?&quot; the rep says.</p>

<p>Asked by the caller where the sites came from, the rep says: &quot;We have millions of people calling about these channels. We have a team that&apos;s like online trying to find things online for free. So they send us these emails.&quot;</p></blockquote><br>
Cablevision EVP of communications Charles Schueler said &#x201C;The FCC filing clearly demonstrates that News Corp. has acted in bad faith and outlines the FCC&#x2019;s authority to order binding arbitration and immediately end the Fox blackout of Cablevision customers.  News Corp. never engaged in real negotiations, they only made a &apos;take it or leave it&apos; proposal for Fox 5, and they timed the Fox blackout to leverage major national sporting events to force Cablevision to accept unreasonable demands.&quot;  <p></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422214506/http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/10/25/claims-of-good-faith-and-bad-in-cable-dispute/">However, News Corp. said</a>, &quot;From the genesis of our talks with Cablevision, Fox has negotiated in good faith. We have never made any &#x2018;take it or leave it&#x2019; demands, nor are we asking for $150 million in fees. For Cablevision to still be making those claims is yet another example of their ploy to secure an advantage through government intervention.&quot; MediaDecoder also reports, &quot;News Corporation&#x2019;s charge that in a personal meeting, the Cablevision president, James Dolan, made clear to the News Corporation president, Chase Carey, that &apos;Cablevision&#x2019;s preferred path was to continue to seek political or regulatory relief,&apos; rather than a negotiated settlement.&quot;</p>
