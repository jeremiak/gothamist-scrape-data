Even Sweeney called a cab from Arecibo at 6 p.m., and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508164223/http://www.ny1.com/content/top_stories/137832/baby-boy-safely-delivered-inside-cab-in-midtown">when she got in</a>, &quot;I was far enough in labor that I was like &apos;Please lock the doors,&apos; because I knew I was going to be stomping on them.&quot; The next thing she, her partner Inez Murray and cabbie Juan Hernandez knew, her water broke.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508164223/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/it_one_hack_of_premiere_oZEGop62sEjRg1V2N0i6fP">Hernandez said</a>, &quot;She started screaming. I told her, &apos;If it has to happen here, just push!&apos;&quot;</p>

<p>Murray said, &quot;She pushed one big push, and his head came out like a cork. And whatever happens to your lungs, he just gasped and I thought, &apos;At least he&apos;s breathing.&apos;&quot; Hernandez had called 911 and shortly after pulling over at 51st and 7th, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508164223/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2011/04/21/brooklyn-woman-even-sweeney-gives-birth-in-taxi-in-midtown/">WCBS 2 reports</a> that &quot;six police cars and an ambulance from New York Presbyterian were at the scene, along with a crowd of onlookers. EMT workers entered the cab, cut the baby&#x2019;s cord and sent the two moms on their way to Roosevelt Hospital.&quot;</p>

<p>According to the Daily News, Murray said, &quot;When they lifted her onto the stretcher, everyone broke out in applause. It was so New York.&quot; The couple, who already have a four-year-old daughter, named the baby Finn; Sweeney said, &quot;He is definitely going to be an adventurer and a New York man. Cops and EMTs were his first friends.&quot;</p>

<p>And so was Hernandez!  The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508164223/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/it_one_hack_of_premiere_oZEGop62sEjRg1V2N0i6fP">Post says</a> he didn&apos;t charge them for the ride and even followed them to the hospital to give them their belongings; the cabbie said, &quot;The cleanup took a while. But that was no big deal.&quot;</p>
