<p>The New York primary is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160617104800/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/29/sanders_tone_done_for_what.php">a very big deal this year</a>, with 291 delegates up for grabs and the winner still up in the air. Both Democratic candidates, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, are frantically campaigning here and upstate (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160617104800/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/05/upstate_ny_state_of_mind.php">wherever that is</a>) ahead of April 19th. They are even <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160617104800/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/05/battle_of_brooklyn_clinton_sanders.php">debating at the Brooklyn Navy Yard</a> next Thursday, April 14th. But Sanders is answering to a higher power on April 15th: He&apos;s going to the Vatican to talk about social, economic and environmental issues.</p>

<p>On Morning Joe today, Sanders called himself &quot;a big, big fan of the Pope&quot; (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160617104800/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fEUfbdPuRg">he is</a>),&quot;I was very moved by the invitation. Obviously there are issues we don&apos;t agree on&#x2014;women&apos;s rights and gay rights&#x2014;but he&apos;s played an unbelievable role in injecting a moral consequence into the economy... He is talking <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160617104800/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/26/pope_francis_attacks_idolatry_of_mo.php">about the idolatry of money</a>, the worship of money, the greed that&#x2019;s out there, how our whole culture is based on: &#x2018;I need more and more and more. And, I don&#x2019;t have to worry about veterans sleeping out on the street or elderly people who can&#x2019;t afford their prescriptions.&#x2019;&quot;</p>

<p>In a statement released by his campaign, the Senator said, &quot;I am delighted to have been invited by the Vatican to a meeting on restoring social justice and environmental sustainability to the world economy. Pope Francis has made clear that we must overcome &#x2018;the globalization of indifference&#x2019; in order to reduce economic inequalities, stop financial corruption and protect the natural environment. That is our challenge in the United States and in the world.&quot;</p>

<p>If elected, Bernie Sanders would be the first Jewish president, not to mention the first president who might have to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160617104800/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/28/inside_the_epic_park_slope_food_co-.php#photo-1">mediate the Park Slope Food Co-op debate about hummus</a>.</p>

<p>But does this mean Pope Francis is officially a Bernie Bro? Unclear, but the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160617104800/http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/270001-pope-spokesman-clarifies-trump-comment">Vatican spokesman has previously declared</a>, &quot;The Pope has clearly said he didn&#x2019;t want to get involved in the electoral campaign in the US.&quot; </p>
