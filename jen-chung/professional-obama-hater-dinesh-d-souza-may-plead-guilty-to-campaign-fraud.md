										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right"> <img alt="2014_05_dsouza.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20140523071241im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2014_05_dsouza.jpg" width="400" height="267"> <br> <i style=" width:400px; ;display:block"> Dinesh D&apos;Souza</i></div> Dinesh D&apos;Souza, a conservative pundit and the filmmaker who made a film about how President Obama has been carrying out his father&apos;s anti-colonial agenda, will be in federal court this morning for a hearing related to campaign fraud charges. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140523071241/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/20/nyregion/dsouza-expected-to-plead-guilty-to-charge.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">NY Times reports</a> that his trial was supposed to start today, but &quot;the United States attorney&#x2019;s office for the Southern District of New York sent out an advisory late Monday night that said a hearing had been scheduled on Tuesday, using language that typically indicates that a plea is expected to occur.&quot;<p></p>

<p>The Times does hedge this assessment by noting that &quot;decisions to plead guilty are subject to change at the last minute, and a defendant like Mr. D&#x2019;Souza could decide instead to go to trial.&quot; But last week, D&apos;Souza <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140523071241/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/05/15/dinesh-dsouza_n_5333002.html">failed to get the charges dismissed</a>. He is accused of asking people to make $20,000 in donations for Senate candidate Wendy Long, who was challenging Senator Kirsten Gillibrand. </p>

<p>Federal prosecutors claim that D&apos;Souza reimbursed the donors, which would mean he could face up to five years in prison if convicted. D&apos;Souza, his lawyer and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140523071241/http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/may/19/editorial-selective-prosecution-of-dinesh-dsouza/">supporters</a> claim that his position as an Obama critic had made him a target (the U.S. Attorney handling the case, Preet Bharara, is an Obama appointee and, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140523071241/http://foxnewsinsider.com/2014/02/24/preet-bharara-lead-prosecutor-dinesh-d&#x2019;souza-case-former-obama-donor">Fox News Insider points out</a>, an Obama donor).</p>

<p>D&apos;Souza, described by critics <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140523071241/http://www.salon.com/2014/01/25/far_right_phony_intellectualism_the_secret_of_dinesh_dsouzas_success/">as a &quot;phony&quot; far-right intellectual</a>, has also written many books about Christianity and was the president of a small NYC-based Christian college until he was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140523071241/http://gothamist.com/2012/10/19/professional_obama_hater_dinesh_dso.php">caught cheating on his wife with a married woman</a> (D&apos;Souza claimed he was separated).</p>
