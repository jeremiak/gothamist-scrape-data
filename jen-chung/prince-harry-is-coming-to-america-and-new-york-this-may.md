	<p>The British royal family announced that &quot;spare&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604141819/http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/gossip/prince-harry-planning-return-u-s-article-1.1298289?localLinksEnabled=false">Prince Harry will be visiting</a> the United States this May, stopping in Washington D.C., Denver, Colorado, Connecticut, New York and New Jersey. Obviously, they are trying to keep him far from Las Vegas, where he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604141819/http://www.tmz.com/2012/08/21/prince-harry-naked-photos-nude-vegas-hotel-party/">notoriously got naked</a> during a round of strip poker and also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604141819/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2193252/Prince-Harry-naked-Bachelorette-party-Vegas-hotel-reveal-Lets-WILD-night.html">crashed a bachelorette party</a>. Maybe he should <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604141819/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/05/chris_so_youve_been_doing.php">just crash a Todd P party</a>? </p>

<p>One of Harry&apos;s purposes for the visit is to go to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604141819/http://www.wtc.army.mil/about_us/warriorgames2013.html">Warrior Games</a> in Colorado Springs. His private secretary <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604141819/http://news.sky.com/story/1069418/prince-harry-returning-to-us-after-vegas-scandal">said</a>, &quot;Prince Harry wants to highlight once again the extraordinary commitment and sacrifice of our injured servicemen and women - our wounded warriors. Although a Prince, Harry is also an operational soldier - indeed he&apos;s a soldier&apos;s soldier - therefore throughout this briefing the recurring theme is to help recognise and bring a spotlight onto the work being done to help these outstanding young men and women.&quot;</p>

<p>Back during his 2010 visit to New York, he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604141819/http://gothamist.com/2010/06/26/prince_harry_joins_west_point_cadet.php#photo-1">joined West Point cadets in exercises</a>, played <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604141819/http://gothamist.com/2010/06/28/prince_harry_walks_plays_polo_falls.php#photo-1">polo on Governors Island</a>, and threw out the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604141819/http://gothamist.com/2010/06/27/prince_harrys_mets_game_pitch_barel.php#photo-1">opening pitch at a Mets game</a>&#x2014;R.A.

<p>Let&apos;s hope there are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604141819/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2192253/Prince-Harry-Vegas-pool-party-bikini-beauties-led-THOSE-naked-pictures.html">some ladies celebrating a upcoming wedding</a>, okay?</p>
