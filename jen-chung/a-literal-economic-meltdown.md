<p>Today, on the 79th anniversary of the 1929 Black Tuesday stock market crash, artists Nora Ligorano and Marshall Reese-- Ligorano/Reese-- installed an ice sculpture of the word &quot;Economy&quot; in Foley Square.  And the piece, called &quot;Main Street Meltdown,&quot; is a &quot;temporary monument&quot; and Ligorano explained, &quot;<strong>To see the word &apos;economy&apos; melting down is representational of our extreme time.</strong>&#x201D;</p>

<p>You can see the sculpture at Foley Square, south of Worth Street, between Centre and Lafayette Streets (across from the NY State Supreme Court building).  There&apos;s a photo of the sculpture partially melted after the jump--more photographs and video at their website, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170312033448/http://mainstreetmeltdown.com/">Main Street Meltdown</a>.
