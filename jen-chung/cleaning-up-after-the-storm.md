<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160210202706/http://gothamist.com/2008/06/10/thunderstorms_sweep.php">Last night&apos;s storms</a> provided a vivid light show and wreaked havoc in neighborhoods all across the city and Tri-State area.  There are downed trees and power lines, not to mention debris and fallen scaffolding, all over, thanks to powerful gusts of winds.  Crews <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160210202706/http://wcbstv.com/national/power.outage.con.2.745421.html">are working on clean up and repairs</a>.  Remember:  Do not go near any downed power lines and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160210202706/http://www.ny1.com/ny1/content/index.jsp?stid=1&amp;aid=82565">if you see any, call Con Ed or the police</a>.  </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160210202706/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=weather/forecast&amp;id=6198067">According to WABC 7</a>, the NYC power outage breakdown is Staten Island 24, Brooklyn 136, Queens 584, Manhattan 56, and  Bronx 1137.  There are 799 without power on Long Island, 5,663 in Westchester County (Rockland, Orange, Dutchess and Putnam Counties combine for about 2000 outages), and 19,518 in Connecticut.  In NJ, 100,000 PSE&amp;G; customers in NJ <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160210202706/http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2008/06/100000_pseg_customers_still_in.html">are still without power</a>, while about 14,000 JCP&amp;L; were without power last night (but it&apos;s unclear if it was restored this morning).  </p>

<p>There&apos;s also no service on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160210202706/http://mta.info/alert/alertmnr.htm">New Canaan branch of Metro-North</a>, and there are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160210202706/http://www.njtransit.com/sa/sa_servlet.srv?hdnPageAction=TravelAlertsTo#50873">1-2 hour delays on NJ Transit lines</a>.  Luckily the PATH line that was knocked out yesterday by a fire <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160210202706/http://www.myfoxny.com/myfox/pages/Home/Detail?contentId=6736261&amp;version=10&amp;locale=EN-US&amp;layoutCode=TSTY&amp;pageId=1.1.1">is back in service</a>.</p>

<p>As for the weather, the heat wave is supposed to be over: A high of 87 degrees is expected and humidity will be much lower, at 55%.  </p>
