As expected, people protesting the hikes were also present. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506164253/http://ny1.com/content/top_stories/98517/rent-guidelines-board-approves-preliminary-hike/Default.aspx">NY1 reports</a>, &quot;For one-year leases, the board is now looking at a hike of two percent to 4.5 percent. For two-year leases, the range is four percent to 7.5 percent.&quot; Last year, the board <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506164253/http://gothamist.com/2008/06/20/rent_stabilised_hikes_face_45_8_hik.php">agreed on hikes</a> of 4.5% for one-year leases and 8.5% for two-year leases. Landlords and building owners say that while those hikes seem big, they barely offset costs for heating oil and water.  Still, City Council Speaker Christine Quinn says she<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506164253/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/06/nyregion/06rent.html?ref=nyregion"> would ask the board to freeze rents</a>; one tenant organizer said, &quot;<strong>This would be an appropriate year to do that. This is the worst recession we&#x2019;ve seen since the Great Depression of the 1930s.</strong>&quot;</p>
