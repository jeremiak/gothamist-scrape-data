<p>A woman was killed at a NJ farmer&apos;s market yesterday when, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510014846/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2014/08/11/driver-in-custody-after-crash-that-killed-woman-at-nj-farmers-market/">WCBS 2 reports</a>, a truck driver plowed &quot;through a barricade and hit three people, including a woman who was dragged three blocks.&quot; Now the driver has been charged with vehicular homicide.</p>

<p>Vendors at the farmer&apos;s market in Hawthorne were getting ready to close (they end operations at 2 p.m.) when James Woetzel, 48, barreled his pickup truck into the area. One vendor, Bailey Hildebrandt, was hit by Woetzel and said, &quot;I hit the ground and just saw tomatoes flying up through the air... I just want to know why he didn&#x2019;t stop. The barriers are all there and you can see the tents.&quot; She suffered minor injuries and feels lucky she&apos;s okay.</p>

<p>And <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510014846/http://www.nj.com/passaic-county/index.ssf/2014/08/hawthorne_woman_dead_after_truck_tears_through_farmers_market.html#incart_m-rpt-1">Blythe Roth told the NJ.com</a> that Woetzel would not stop, &quot;I screamed and I ran after the car and I was just yelling stop, stop, stop, and they just kept going.&quot; </p>

<p>The victim was trapped under the truck; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510014846/http://pix11.com/2014/08/10/1-dead-after-pickup-truck-drives-through-nj-farmers-market/">one witness said</a>, &quot;You could hear her screaming/ Everyone was calling 911. It was frantic.&quot; The victim, believed to be a Hawthorn resident in her 60s, was pronounced dead at the scene.</p>

<p>Woetzel was charged with vehicular homicide and leaving the scene of a motor vehicle accident which resulted in death, and is being held on $200,000 bail. According to NJ.com, the driver was &quot;visibly upset.&quot;</p>
