</div></div>					<p>Ladies and gentlemen, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508151926/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/14/sneak_peek_fdnys_2012_calendar.php#photo-1">calendar you&apos;ve all</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508151926/http://gothamist.com/2010/12/29/fdny_beefcakes_pose_for_new_charity.php">been waiting</a> for is on sale, at the Fire Zone store and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508151926/http://www.FDNYFoundation.org/">online</a>: The FDNY Official 2012 Calendar of Heroes, featuring 12 New York City firefighters showing off their fine form against Big Apple backdrops.  Ever wonder what a Statue of Liberty tattoo looks like on a bulging bicep?  Well, check out Mr. May&#x2014;and we&apos;ve got photos of Mr. January and Mr. September, and Mr. December, too.</p>

<p>A portion of the proceeds from the calendar goes to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508151926/http://www.FDNYFoundation.org/">FDNY Foundation</a>, the FDNY&apos;s non-profit arm that educates the public about fire safety. FDNY Commissioner Salvatore Cassano said, &quot;We know this official FDNY calendar will raise funds and awareness about fire safety and will serve to remind everyone of ways to be fire safe year-round. The FDNY Foundation&#x2019;s important role in our fire safety education, and the great work of our members, has helped push civilian fire deaths to record lows in New York City.&#x201D; </p>

<p>The FDNY press release points out, &quot;This year&#x2019;s calendar features 12 current FDNY Firefighters, each bringing a seasonal fire safety message with their respective month, covering everything from space heater safety in the winter to fireworks safety in July.&quot;  Here&apos;s behind the scenes video of the shoot as well:</p>
