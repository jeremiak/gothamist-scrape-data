<p>A World War II plane flying south crashed into the Hudson River this evening. The NYPD, FDNY and NJ State Police are searching the river, and the pilot has not been found yet. <b>Update [more details below]</b>: The pilot&apos;s body was recovered late last night. </p>

<p>The crash occurred before 7:30 p.m., with the P47 Thunderbolt hitting the water closer to the NJ side. Jonathan Evans, 20, was at the West 79th Street Boat Basin on the Upper West Side and noticed the smoke at first, &quot;The smoke was coming from the plane, and the plane was hanging down at a steep angle... It just went down.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110091743/http://nypost.com/2016/05/27/plane-crashes-into-hudson-river/">The Post reports</a>, &quot;The aircraft left with two other planes from Republic Airport in Farmingdale Long Island. The other two planes returned safely. The vintage plane may have been in town for the Jones Beach air show on Saturday and Sunday.&quot;</p>

<p>The plane was from the American Airpower Museum, and a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110091743/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Plane-Hudson-River-381171841.html">spokesman told NBC New York</a>, that &quot;the plane was on a photo flight with at least two other planes along the river when there was some kind of mechanical issue, and the pilot decided to ditch in the Hudson, [Gary] Lewi said. It&apos;s not clear what the source of the problem was.&quot;</p>

<p>A massive response from NYC emergency responders gathered at the Boat Basin and across the river on the NJ side. At first, the NJ State Police had said the pilot, a male, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110091743/https://twitter.com/NJSP/status/736361798224490496">had been rescued</a> and was taken to the hospital with minor injuries, but later retracted the statement, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110091743/https://twitter.com/NJSP/status/736374137606811648">citing &quot;conflicting reports&quot;</a> and then saying the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110091743/https://twitter.com/NJSP/status/736376098846572545">NYPD would be the &quot;lead agency.&quot;</a></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110091743/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2016/05/27/hudson-river-plane-crash/">Witnesses spoke to WCBS 2</a> about seeing the pilot struggle; one said, &quot;When we looked to our left, the only thing we saw was the tail end of it, but we didn&#x2019;t hear no engine. But then we also saw the pilot - he came up, and he also just went back down, but he never came up.&quot; </p>

<p>Another added, &quot;You could see him trying to get out of the harness of whatever - whatever he was strapped to, the seatbelt or harness or whatever, but he couldn&#x2019;t get out.&quot;</p>

<p><b>Update</b>: The pilot has been identified as William Gordon, 56, of Key West, Florida. </p>

It&#x2019;s crushing.&quot; </p>

<p>Jeffrey Nager, who lives in Edgewater,<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110091743/http://www.newsday.com/long-island/william-gordon-pilot-of-wwii-plane-that-crashed-in-hudson-to-be-honored-1.11850926"> told Newsday</a>, &quot;I saw an old-time plane essentially going down. It was amazing to see. He came very close to the end of our complex. It looked like he was ditching the plane in the river, doing a Sully.&quot; Another vintage plane stayed over the area to help guide rescuers, he said.</p>
