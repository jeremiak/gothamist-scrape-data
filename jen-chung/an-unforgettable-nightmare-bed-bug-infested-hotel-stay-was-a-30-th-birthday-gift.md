<p>The hotel guest who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160507203807/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/02/hotel_bed_infested_bugs_ughhhhh.php">filmed the awful, bed bug-ridden Upper West Side hotel mattress</a>&#x2014;as well as the bites his girlfriend endured&#x2014;revealed that the hotel stay was a birthday gift from his mother. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160507203807/http://abc7ny.com/news/couple-from-california-describes-bedbug-nightmare-at-upper-west-side-hotel/1144366/">Elgin Ozlen told WABC 7</a>, &quot;We were expecting a vacation to remember the rest of our lives, and we will definitely remember it for the rest of our lives, but it won&apos;t be a pleasant memory.&quot;</p>

<p>Ozlen and his girlfriend are visiting from California; his mother gave them the trip for his 30th birthday, and &quot;the couple was supposed to take in the sights and sounds of the city, and see the ball drop on New Year&apos;s Eve in Times Square.&quot; Instead, their hotel, the Astor on Park, on Central Park West near West 107th Street, kept them busy: They changed rooms three times (the first two didn&apos;t have heat, he says) and their third room is where his girlfriend, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160507203807/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/bedbugs-bite-woman-stayed-central-park-west-hotel-article-1.2483496">the Daily News reports</a>, &quot;suffered about 75 bites and blemishes on her fingers, toes, arms and stomach from the ravenous bugs.&quot;</p>

<p>At around the 3 minute mark, Ozlen shows the bugs. Note the black fecal matter from the bed bugs in the mattress seams.</p>

<p>The News adds, &quot;The mess ruined the holiday and his 30th birthday &#x2014; both on Jan. 1. The couple missed their date to see the annual Radio City Music Hall Christmas show with the Rockettes.&quot; He told WABC 7, &quot;On my birthday, I&apos;m in the hospital, and I&apos;m washing the best clothes that I brought that I own for this vacation, and during that process many of the clothes became damaged, because they&apos;re not meant to be dried.&quot;</p>

<p>While the hotel has not commented, Ozlen claimed that when the general manager saw the situation, &quot;He was trembling, covering his mouth. He was disgusted. He started apologizing and offering us a different room. I told him, &#x2018;We&#x2019;re getting the hell out of this hotel!&#x2019;&quot; Apparently they received a refund. </p>

<p>Other hotel guests were shocked at the video, some were frightened about the prospect of staying another night there: &quot;It&apos;s disgusting. I don&apos;t really feel like sleeping here.&quot;</p>

<p>Ozlen said, &quot;It was an unforgettable nightmare. It didn&#x2019;t even feel real. And the fact that it was New York and my birthday made it even worse.&quot;</p>
