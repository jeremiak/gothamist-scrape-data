It turns out a former NYC police officer had jumped in front of an A train&#x2014;and that he was wanted for murdering his ex-girlfriend in NJ.<p></p>

<p>Arthur Lomando, 44, allegedly slashed Suzanne Bardzell yesterday at around 3:30 p.m. in Midland Park, NJ. Authorities say that Bardzell had pulled into her driveway when Lomando broke through her car&apos;s window and attacked her with a machete. </p>

<p>Then Lomando apparently headed to New York City, and at around 4:30 p.m., he allegedly threw himself in front of an oncoming train at the Washington Heights subway station. Bergen County Prosecutor John Molinelli Tweeted:</p>
