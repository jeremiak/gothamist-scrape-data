Emails released on Thanksgiving Eve! (NYC Mayor&apos;s Office)</i></div> <p></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016014346/http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/politics/2016/09/8/ny1-sues-city-hall-in-freedom-of-information-battle.html">With a lawsuit pending</a> to see the mayor&apos;s correspondence with one of his &quot;agents of the city&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016014346/http://gothamist.com/2016/05/20/power_corrupts_park_slopers_absolutely.php">who also happens to be a lobbyist</a>, the de Blasio administration released 1,500 pages of emails yesterday afternoon. Happy Thanksgiving!</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016014346/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/lawsuit-forces-de-blasio-release-agents-city-emails-article-1.2885624">The Daily News said</a>, &quot;The timing of their release &#x2014; one day before the holiday &#x2014; is suspicious. Pols typically try to bury news before a long weekend since people are distracted with festivities. They are a fraction of the emails between the mayor and his &apos;agents,&apos; who don&#x2019;t work for the government but his lawyers claim should be exempt from being made public because they are his top strategists.&quot;</p>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">&quot;Agent of the city&quot; emails so far: BerlinRosen is involved in all sorts of NYC business. And it takes a million emails to arrange a call!</p>&#x2014; Josh Dawsey (@jdawsey1) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016014346/https://twitter.com/jdawsey1/status/801559970705711105">November 23, 2016</a></blockquote>

<p>The emails are between City Hall and Jonathan Rosen, who co-founded PR firm Berlin Rosen, which does work with not only politicians but also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016014346/http://berlinrosen.com/our-clients">real estate companies</a> among other corporate firms. As NY1 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016014346/http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2015/04/1/ny1-exclusive--who-is-jonathan-rosen--the-most-powerful-man-in-politics---outside-city-hall.html">explained earlier this year</a>, &quot;BerlinRosen is deeply involved in the mayor&apos;s non-profit lobbying group, the Campaign for One New York. The organization has been raising private money to bolster mayoral initiative&#x2014;like the expansion of pre-K. Last year, the campaign raised $2.2 million. The American Federation of Teachers was the biggest donor with a gift of $350,000.&quot; (Good government groups <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016014346/http://gothamist.com/2016/07/07/de_blasio_legal_corruption.php">don&apos;t like this kind of set-up</a>.)</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016014346/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/23/nyregion/emails-released-by-mayor-de-blasios-office-detail-reliance-on-outside-agents.html">The NY Times reports</a> that the emails &quot;reveal a City Hall in regular contact with public relations firms over the minutia of press strategy: whether to remove a fence to make a better backdrop for an event in Harlem; a lengthy discussion of how to discredit rival cities in a bid to host the Democratic National Convention in Brooklyn; whether to solicit a politician to speak with a reporter.&quot; </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016014346/http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/politics/2016/11/23/mayor-s-office-releases-hundreds-of-pages-of-emails-between-de-blasio-and--agents-of-the-city-.html">From NY1</a>: </p><blockquote> Huge portions of emails were redacted. In others, Rosen&apos;s ties to private clients proved helpful. He appeared to provide the mayor with the cellphone number for developer Jed Walentas of Two Trees and wrote, &quot;Will you let me know if they connect? Thanks.&quot;<p></p>

<p>He was included in an email discussion with the mayor&apos;s campaign fundraiser, Ross Offinger, who sent over a list of business leaders to Rosen and top de Blasio aides. An aide to the mayor responded, &quot;Can we take this off official thread please.&quot;</p></blockquote><p></p>

Correspondence between City Hall aides and others outside the government is generally considered to be public... City Hall is releasing more emails to buttress its argument that it is only refusing to release emails that show internal deliberations between the men and Mr. de Blasio that don&#x2019;t involve their clients, a spokesman said.&quot;</p>

<p>Reporters and City Hall spokesman Eric Phillips bickered about the release of emails:</p>
