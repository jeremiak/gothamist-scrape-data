<p>Last night, Jimmy Fallon welcomed Barbra Streisand to The Tonight Show. It was quite an event, given that the last time she <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013657/http://barbra-archives.com/tv/60s/tonight_show_streisand.html">was on the program was in the 1963</a>. Besides singing some of her duets with Fallon, she got to sit at the host&apos;s desk. Streisand said, &quot;Are you kidding?&quot; and Fallon joked, &quot;Let&apos;s be honest &#x2014; you&apos;re never coming back here.&quot;</p>

<p>Of course, maybe this set-up was a way to flatter the Erasmus High alum, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013657/http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/09/11/barbra-streisand-is-going-to-be-on-the-tonight-show-for-the-first-time-in-50-years/">who famously favors her left profile</a>. Streisand interviewed Fallon a little, channeling <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013657/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102713/">Dr. Susan Lowenstein</a>. </p>

<p>She also insisted she&apos;s not a diva and said that she lives a simple life&#x2014;riding in a truck with husband James Brolin:</p>

<p>As for the singing, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013657/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/barbra-streisand-tonight-show-all-733023">here&apos;s the Hollywood Reporter&apos;s description</a>:</p><blockquote>In honor of Streisand&apos;s new album Partners, which features her singing duets with various high-profile vocalists, she sang a live medley of three tunes. Jimmy Fallon joined her by impersonating three of her duet partners from the album.<p></p>

<p>Streisand sang the first verse of Presley&apos;s &quot;Love Me Tender,&quot; and then Fallon joined her in an Elvis wig and sunglasses. &quot;My king,&quot; Streisand quipped as Fallon did his best on the chorus with Presley&apos;s signature inflection.</p>

<p>Next, Streisand performed &quot;I&apos;d Want It to Be You,&quot; with Fallon wearing a cowboy hat (natch) as The Voice judge Blake Shelton. &quot;That was actually good,&quot; Streisand told Fallon, sounding genuinely surprised.</p>

<p>They ended with a love song, singing &quot;It Had to Be You&quot; with Fallon filling in for crooner Michael Bubl&#xE9;. Fallon really got into the spirit and went in for a kiss, but Streisand wasn&apos;t feeling quite as swept away.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>And, for nostalgia, here&apos;s a 1963 performance of Streisand on The Judy Garland Show:</p>
