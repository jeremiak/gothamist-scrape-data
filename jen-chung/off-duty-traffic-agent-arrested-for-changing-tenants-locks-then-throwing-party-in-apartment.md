<p>Last night, an off-duty NYPD traffic agent was arrested for &quot;unlawful eviction&quot; and &quot;harassment.&quot; Who was she allegedly evicting unlawfully and harassing? Her tenant in the Rockaways!</p>

<p>An NYPD spokesperson says Shanna Hamilton, 31, was arrested at 10 p.m. for changing the locks on her tenant&apos;s apartment. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160406062024/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/off-duty-traffic-agent-busted-eviction-party-sources-article-1.2451262">The Daily News has more details</a>: &quot;Hamilton entered her tenant&#x2019;s apartment on Beach 98th St. in the Rockaways with several friends, changed the locks and proceeded to throw a party inside &#x2014; while the tenant was home, sources said. During the shindig, Hamilton threatened to throw her tenant off the balcony, the sources said.&quot;</p>

<p>The tenant then called the police. &quot;Locking the occupant out of the dwelling unit or changing the locks without giving tenant the keys&quot; and &quot;Using or threatening to use force to remove an occupant&quot; are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160406062024/http://www.tenant.net/Rights/illevict/illevict.html">considered two examples of unlawful eviction</a></p>

<p>Hamilton <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160406062024/http://nypost.com/2013/12/29/3-city-workers-arrested-within-3-hours-in-unrelated-incidents/">was arrested two years ago</a> for assault when she and her girlfriend got into an fight (the girlfriend was also charged with assault).</p>
