In a hearing about a lawsuit from S.I. lawmakers over the checks, Justice Philip Minardo said, &quot;This is a serious matter, and it affects hundreds of thousands of people, and it&apos;s not going to languish. If the Council and mayor do not agree, then...the court will decide.&quot;  Bloomberg, who contends the city can&apos;t afford the $256 million, said, &quot;I would like to send out the checks. The question is, what is the cost of doing that? <strong>If we do that, make no mistake about it, there will be fewer city employees, because that&apos;s where the city money goes, to pay employees who provide services</strong>.&quot; But City Council Speaker Christine Quinn <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623150503/http://www.politickerny.com/1019/christine-quinn-no-rebate-checks-christmas">said</a>, &quot;This shouldn&#x2019;t be in the courts...the checks should be sent out and we should stop wasting court counsel&#x2019;s time in court&quot; (but she did concede it would be impossible for the Dept. of Finance to send the checks by Christmas).  </p>
