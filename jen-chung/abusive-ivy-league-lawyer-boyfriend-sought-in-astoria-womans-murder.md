Jason Bohn, 33, had apparently beaten Thomas so badly in face and body that on June 7, she went to the 114th Precinct for a restraining order.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141226033156/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/queens/beau_hunted_in_exec_murder_iHYhSWNVEmI88qXnukUf8H">According to the Post</a>, Bohn called her while she was the police station, allegedly yelling, &quot;<strong>It&#x2019;s war! I&#x2019;ll dedicate my life to hunting you down like a dog in the streets. I am going to make your life impossible.</strong>&quot;<p></p>

<p>Bohn, a contract attorney (according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141226033156/http://www.linkedin.com/in/jbohn1">his LinkedIn</a>), and Thomas, a financial analyst at Weight Watchers, had lived in an apartment on 33rd Street, where <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141226033156/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/27/30-yr-old_woman_found_dead_in_astor.php">neighbors said he beat her</a>, &quot;He used to beat her all the time&#x2014;I&apos;ve heard her screaming and crying, and so have many of the other neighbors.&quot;  </p>

<p>Thomas did manage to get the restraining order and Bohn, who had also sent threatening emails to her, was charged with misdemeanor assault and aggravated harassment.  The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141226033156/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/queens/sources-police-heard-threats-made-murder-suspect-jason-bohn-queens-woman-found-dead-apartment-article-1.1103591">Daily News reports,</a> &quot;The Queens district attorney&#x2019;s office asked for $1,000 bail, but Bohn was released without bail and an order of protection was issued against him.&quot;  On Tuesday night, Thomas&apos;s body was found beaten and strangled; the building super <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141226033156/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2012/06/27/police-death-of-queens-woman-being-investigated-as-homicide/">said tenants heard her screams</a>, &quot;He&apos;s kill[ing] me. Somebody help me.&quot;</p>

<p>The News adds, &quot;He lived for years in Florida, sources said, and detectives believe he has left New York and shut off his cell phone, making tracking him difficult.&quot; Bohn graduated from Columbia University as an undergraduate and from University of Florida&apos;s law school&#x2014;Thomas&apos;s family said that she met him at a football game in Florida.  Thomas&apos;s mother told the Post, &quot;She was my only child and my mother&#x2019;s only grandchild. She was really enjoying New York. She loved her job and they loved her.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141226033156/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2012/06/27/police-death-of-queens-woman-being-investigated-as-homicide/">WCBS 2 says</a> that Thomas had recently sought shelter at a battered women&apos;s home: &quot;No one knows why she came back to the apartment Tuesday night, the spot where Bohn allegedly took her life.&quot;</p>

<p>On the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141226033156/http://www.jccany.org/site/News2?page=NewsArticle&amp;id=5349">Jewish Child Care Association&apos;s website</a> touting its scholarship success stories, there&apos;s an entry by Jason Bohn, a contract attorney who graduated from Columbia and University of Florida&apos;s law school:</p><blockquote> While I am originally from &#x201C;Da Bronx&#x201D;, I now live in Riverdale. My father was addicted to drugs and physically abusive. My mother was addicted to success and eventually abandoned me for a new life and family. I was thirteen years of age, depressed and extremely angry when I went to live at the Pleasantville Cottage School in Westchester County. Upon my arrival to Cottage 8, I was sincerely determined to do whatever it took to get kicked out. I was physically violent against fellow cottage members and disobedient to concerned staff members such as Andre and Clarence. I also went AWOL every other week to escape to the city. Retrospectively I can honestly say that I didn&#x2019;t give a &amp;%#@ about much. In reality, I was suicidal.</blockquote>Bohn attended one of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141226033156/http://www.jccany.org/site/PageServer?pagename=cottage_pcs">JCCA&apos;s treatment centers as a youth</a> and writes that he managed to put his life back together, thanking the JCCA for helping him with partly funding his studies at Columbia. <p></p>
