It&#x2019;s like the little kid ran into the car and the impact spinned him around and pinned in the fetal position underneath the car.&quot;<p></p>

<p>Johnson, her friend and two others ended up lifting the back of the cab to remove the boy, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811083526/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2011/07/07/2011-07-07_harlem_heroes_race_to_lift_car_after_boy_is_hit.html?r=ny_local&amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+nydnrss%2Fny_local+%28NY+Local%29&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader">10-year-old Jaden Torres</a>.  A pediatrician who lives nearby attended to him and told the Daily News, &quot;He was wedged under the rear of the car. He had a pulse ... but he was completely unresponsive.&quot;</p>

<p>Jaden is in stable condition at Harlem Hospital. No charges were filed against the driver.</p>
