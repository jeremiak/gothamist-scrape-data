Apparently this proposal will be included in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160301060841/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2008/11/08/2008-11-08_tolls_could_be_next_for_4_city_bridges.html">Ravtich Commission&apos;s recommendation</a> for ways for the MTA to raise revenue.  Governor Paterson <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160301060841/http://www.streetsblog.org/2008/09/16/ravitch-commission-faces-miserable-task-of-shoring-up-mtas-future/">convened the commission</a> after countless warnings from the agency about its dire financial situation.</p>

<p>If the MTA does pass a toll, many drivers will be unhappy.  The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160301060841/http://www.nypost.com/seven/11092008/news/regionalnews/new_tolls_eyed_for_east_river_bridges_137874.htm">NY Post has two quotes</a> from &quot;average New Yorkers.&quot; </p>

<p>Married father of two Walter Winds, Lower East Side side, &quot;crosses the Williamsburg Bridge to bring wife to and from work.&quot;  The Post estimates the tolls would cost about $400/month, prompting Winds to say, &quot;That&apos;ll make me go back to a life of crime; it&apos;s highway robbery.  That&apos;s too much of a burden.<strong> I could see if the money was going to fix roads or put lights up but it&apos;s not worth it if it&apos;s for the MTA.</strong>  That&apos;s $100 extra a week, where am I going to get that from?&quot;</p>

<p>And Adel Benbrika, who crosses the Brooklyn Bridge 2-4 times a day (the toll could also cost him $400/month) for his job at Atlantic Maintenance, worries, &quot;I&apos;m afraid I&apos;m going to lose my job because of this.  I&apos;m trying to support my family, I&apos;m trying to survive.&quot;</p>

<p>Still, the Straphangers&apos; Campaign&apos;s Gene Russianoff said, &quot;Desperate times require desperate measures. In the 25 years I&apos;ve been following their finances, this is the worst situation they&apos;ve ever been in.&quot;</p>
