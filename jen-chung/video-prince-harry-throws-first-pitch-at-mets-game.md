</div></div><p>Yesterday, Prince Harry visited Citi Field to throw out the ceremonial first pitch.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130529081214/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/it_ain_cricket_harry_VY9UEqhDkMqbaKChk9yIyM?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">According to the Post</a>, the throw &quot;barely cleared&quot; the plate, but the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130529081214/http://www.nydailynews.com/blogs/mets/2010/06/live-blog-prince-harry-edition.html">Daily News&apos;s Andy Martino</a> thought it was &quot;not a bad toss... high and inside to a righty hitter, but a good showing, especially from atop the mound.&quot;  </p>

<p><object width="640" height="505"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/picmiKmhfTU&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"><embed src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130529081214oe_/http://www.youtube.com/v/picmiKmhfTU&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="640" height="505"></object></p>

<p>Martino also wrote, &quot;He wrapped his arm around Barajas for the obligatory pictures. The Prince looked a tad nervous, at one point mock-wiping his brow before delivering the pitch. The Mets had prepared a jersey for him with &quot;Wales&quot; and the No. 22 on the back, but he did not wear it on the mound. He did pull on a Met cap en route to the mound, though.&quot;  Fun fact:  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130529081214/http://sports.espn.go.com/new-york/mlb/news/story?id=5331980">RA Dickey told Prince Harry</a> &quot;to bend his elbow during his throwing motion. Prince Harry originally was prepared to throw the baseball with his elbow stiff and unbent, like in cricket.&quot;</p>

<p>Yesterday, Prince Harry also visited UNICEF and then an event for his  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130529081214/http://www.sentebale.org/home/index.html">Sentebale Charity</a>, which benefits the people of Lesotho in Africa, in Greenwich, CT.  His cousin, Princess Beatrice, (daughter of Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson, Duchess of York), also attended the Sentebale event (the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130529081214/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1289993/Princess-Beatrice-beaming-blue-attends-cousin-Prince-Harrys-charity-event-New-York.html?ito=feeds-newsxml">Daily Mail exclaimed</a> she showed &quot;off a stunning pair of slender long legs&quot;).   Today, he will be playing at the Veuve Clicquot Polo Classic.  And on Friday, he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130529081214/http://gothamist.com/2010/06/26/prince_harry_joins_west_point_cadet.php">joined West Point cadets for some drills</a>.</p>
