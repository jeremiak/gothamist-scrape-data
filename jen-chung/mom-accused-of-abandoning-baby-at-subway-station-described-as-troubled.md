<p>The 20-year-old mother <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150410012157/http://gothamist.com/2014/07/08/baby_abandoned_at_columbus_circle_s.php#photo-1">who allegedly left her baby in a stroller on a crowded Manhattan subway platform</a> and then headed back onto a train was arraigned last night. Frankea Dabbs was charged with child abandonment and acting in a manner injurious to a child less than 17. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150410012157/http://nypost.com/2014/07/09/mom-who-left-baby-in-subway-struggling-over-beaus-slay-relative/">Upon seeing the TV cameras in the courtroom</a>, she said, &quot;Is that rolling? ... Tell <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150410012157/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay-Z">Shawn Corey Carter</a> I said &#x2018;f-k him. Piece of sh-t.&#x2019;&quot;</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150410012157/http://gothamist.com/upload/2014/07/2014_06_baby2.jpg"> <img alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150410012157im_/http://gothamist.com/assets_c/2014/07/2014_06_baby2-thumb-640x743-850077.jpg" width="320" height="371" class="image-right"> </a> </span>Dabbs is from North Carolina and it&apos;s unclear where she and the baby girl, who is 11 months old, had been staying in New York City. Dabbs&apos;s family says the young woman has had a very difficult life. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150410012157/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/woman-abandoned-baby-family-article-1.1858664">Her aunt told the Daily News</a>, &#x201C;Stuff is wrong with Frankea&#x2019;s mind. She walks around with dark shades.... She even sleeps in dark shades.&quot;</p>

<p>Dabbs&apos;s father said that his daughter&apos;s boyfriend, the father of baby Milani Love Edmonds, was killed during a robbery in North Carolina earlier this year.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150410012157/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/09/nyregion/woman-in-custody-after-baby-is-left-on-subway-platform.html">From the NY Times</a>:</p><blockquote>That Ms. Dabbs was in New York came as news to even her closest relatives. &#x201C;I heard that she was in Tillery, North Carolina, then Virginia,&#x201D; said [her father Franklin] Dabbs, who works at a food-processing plant. &#x201C;Then when I looked on the news she was in New York, getting arrested.&#x201D;<p></p>

<p>Before that, she had been living with an aunt in Southern California for several months. There were promises to return to school, but soon tensions boiled over. &#x201C;I really could not put up with her, her attitude,&#x201D; said the aunt, ShaRon Edmonds-Dent, 43, a tax preparer. &#x201C;I tried to help her.&#x201D;</p>

<p>She said she did not believe her niece had undergone any treatments for mental health issues. &#x201C;You would think she had mental health issues with her actions,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;But to be honest, Frankea is a regular, normal person.&#x201D;</p>

<p>At one point, Ms. Dabbs returned to prostituting herself, sleeping in a public restroom with her baby, or in a dingy hotel, Ms. Edmonds-Dent said. When the police confronted her there, Ms. Edmonds-Dent said, Ms. Dabbs jumped out the hotel window, the baby in tow. She was arrested in April, for misdemeanor child endangerment, court records show.</p></blockquote>The baby was found after 12:30 p.m. on Monday; a Good Samaritan who held the subway door for Dabbs and the baby saw the baby in the stroller, all alone, a little later. She stayed with the child for 20 minutes, in case the mother returned, and then contacted the police.<p></p>

<p>Dabbs is being held without bail. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150410012157/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2014/07/08/police-mom-in-custody-after-baby-abandoned-in-subway/">A police spokesperson said</a>, &quot;She felt she couldn&#x2019;t take care of the baby and thought she was leaving her in a safe public space.&quot;</p>
