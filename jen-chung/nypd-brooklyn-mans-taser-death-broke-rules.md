Chief department spokesman Paul J. Browne said an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528215918/http://www.wnbc.com/news/17550915/detail.html?dl=mainclick">airbag had been called to catch the victim</a>, Inman Morales, but the lieutenant who issued the order for another officer to stun the man did not wait.  </p>

<p>Morales, 35, who was apparently distraught as he stood naked on his fire escape and wielded a fluorescent light bulb, fell on his head outside his apartment building on Tompkins Avenue and later died at Kings County Hospital.</p>

<p>Browne also said, &quot;<strong>None of the ... officers on the scene were positioned to break his fall, nor did they devise a plan in advance to do so.</strong>&quot;  The guidelines say &quot;when possible, the [conducted energy device] should not be used&#x2026;in situations where the subject may fall from an elevated surface.&quot;  The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528215918/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/26/nyregion/26taser.html?ref=nyregion">NY Times reports</a>, &quot;The lieutenant who gave the order was placed on modified assignment...while the officer who fired the device was given administrative duties.&quot;  You can read the entire statement after the jump.</p>

<p>A witness <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160528215918/http://wcbstv.com/topstories/taser.death.nypd.2.825077.html">told WCBS 2</a>, &quot;The mother was screaming, &apos;He&apos;s gonna fall, he&apos;s gonna fall!&apos; And they said &apos;Ma&apos;am step back.&apos; They wouldn&apos;t allow the mother to talk to him.&quot;  </p>
