Not only did the girl suffer punctured lungs and a shattered pelvis, she apparently had signs of abuse as well as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130722011225/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/13/police_investigating_signs_of_physi.php">traces of marijuana and methadone</a> in her system. Now police have arrested her 19-year-old stepmother, Diane Metallus, and charged her with assault and child endangerment.<p></p>

<p>Prior to the fall, the girl had gone missing from her stepmother&apos;s family&apos;s home in the Gravesend Houses (the girl, her father and Metallus were visiting from Florida). <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130722011225/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/stepmom-whipped-girl-fell-window-cops-article-1.1402452?localLinksEnabled=false">According to the Daily News</a>, &quot;The 7-year-old ran away, but was found by police and returned a short time later, officials said. Outraged, Metellus whipped the child and told her to stay in the room where they were staying, according to sources.&quot;</p>

<p>Metallus allegedly kept her in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130722011225/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/19/nyregion/assault-charges-for-stepmother-after-a-girl-falls.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;_r=1&amp;">a room without window guards</a> and her family heard the girl&apos;s screams when she fell out of the window.</p>

<p>The NYPD and Administration for Children&apos;s Services <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130722011225/http://www.ny1.com/content/top_stories/185723/police-arrest-stepmother-of-girl-who-fell-six-stories-in-brooklyn">are investigating</a>. The girl also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130722011225/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/cops_bust_stepmom_fell_girl_floor_RmZUf9c84wbO6kH9rpeRFO">reportedly has signs of sexual abuse</a>, but investigators have not been able to speak with her yet.</p>
