<p>Forget the black-and-white cookie as the most <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160310015615/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlLPAIrmqvE">New York symbol of bi-color harmony</a> because that sometimes-stinky creature, the skunk, is becoming very noticeable uptown. One Upper Manhattan resident <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160310015615/http://www.myfoxny.com/story/23552091/skunks-take-manhattan">told Fox 5</a>, &quot;They just come out. There will be just like three or four of them hanging out in the park. They&apos;re everywhere.&quot;</p>

<p>Skunks have been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160310015615/http://gothamist.com/2009/09/27/skunks_invade_manhattan.php">regular figures for the</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160310015615/http://gothamist.com/2012/08/27/extra_extra_no_more_sweet_caroline.php">past few years</a>, after migrating to Manhattan from the Riverdale (!). Some people see them &quot;spilling into the streets.&quot; </p>

<p>Animal Control officials say they will only take action if the skunk is acting strangely (you know, rabid) and vets say skunks are fine unless you provoke them.</p>

<p>Mark Bailey, who lives in Washington Heights, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160310015615/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2013/09/27/upper-manhattan-residents-say-skunks-are-stinking-up-neighborhood/">told 1010 WINS</a>, &quot;I tell my friends down in midtown or Hells Kitchen that there&#x2019;s a skunk problem up here and they don&#x2019;t believe it. They&#x2019;re in front of every building&#x2026;they&#x2019;re not just in the parks, they&#x2019;re all over.&quot; </p>

<p>And Aaron Frischberg said, &quot;As far as I am concerned, one is too many. When the windows are open there is a distinct odor of polecat &#x2018;juice.&#x2019;&quot; Ahh&#x2014;can&apos;t wait for a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160310015615/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/29/lower_east_side_fragrance_accuratel.php">Washington Heights fragrance</a>!</p>
