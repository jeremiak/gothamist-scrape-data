Producers couldn&apos;t reach Denise&apos;s mom, Dextina Lincoln, so they called PS 22, and got in touch with music teacher and chorus leader Gregg Breinberg.&quot;  Denise said, &quot;He called my mom and my mom told me the good news, and I got really excited.&quot; </p>

<p>The 11-year-old met with producers and was cast in the commercial.  The video was shot in NJ on a city bus&#x2014;Denise says, &quot;In the commercial, in the city bus it looked like it was driving, but it was really being towed by a tow truck&quot;&#x2014;and then, on Sunday night, she and her mom stayed up to watch the commercial on national TV.  </p>

<p>Denise is now at I.S. 51&#x2014;here&apos;s her version of Adele&apos;s &quot;Rolling in the Deep&quot; with the PS 22 chorus:</p>
