<p>After dropping a new song with a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170626161043/http://sfist.com/2016/02/06/suddenly_more_interested_in_halftime.php">politically and racially charged video</a>, Beyonce <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170626161043/http://sfist.com/2016/02/07/super_bowl_50_coldplay_refuses_to_l.php">dominated Super Bowl 50</a> with a halftime guest appearance featuring dancers in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170626161043/http://sfist.com/2016/02/07/dressed_as_black_panthers_beyonces.php">Black Panthers-inspired outfits</a>. Of course, Rudy Giuliani wasn&apos;t going to take this kind of commentary from the world&apos;s most powerful celebrity.</p>

<p>On Fox &amp; Friends, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170626161043/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wDEbW1budc">Giuliani sputtered</a>, &quot;This is football, not Hollywood, and I thought it was really outrageous that she used it as a platform to attack police officers who are the people who protect her and protect us, and keep us alive. And what we should be doing in the African-American community, and all communities, is build up respect for police officers. And focus on the fact that when something does go wrong, okay. We&apos;ll work on that. But the vast majority of police officers risk their lives to keep us safe.&quot;</p>

<p>The Daily Show&apos;s Jessica Williams had a somewhat different opinion on the matter:</p>

</center><br>

<p>Addressing Fox Business talking head Stuart Varney&apos;s question, &quot;Why is race brought into the halftime show at a Super Bowl game?&quot; Williams pointed out, &quot;Race was brought in because Beyonc&#xE9; was brought in and, brace yourself, you might want to sit down for this, but Beyonc&#xE9; is...black!  As a black person, you walk around everyday constantly reminded that you are black. We&#x2019;re more likely to get paid less, we&#x2019;re more likely to get sent to prison, and we&#x2019;re more likely to win a dance competition. What? It&#x2019;s not all bad.&quot;</p>

<p>Williams also deftly dismantled Giuliani&apos;s statement that &quot;you&apos;re talking to middle America when you have the Super Bowl, so you can have entertainment. Let&apos;s have, you know, decent wholesome entertainment, and not use it as a platform to attack the people who, you know, put their lives at risk to save us.&quot; In response, the Daily Show&apos;s senior Beyonc&#xE9; correspondent said, &quot;You know what&apos;s in the middle of middle America? Ferguson, Missouri! But you&#x2019;re right, you know what? The fans deserve wholesome entertainment. Like watching 300 pound men give each other concussions while the crowd cheers like we&#x2019;re extras in Gladiator?&quot;</p>
