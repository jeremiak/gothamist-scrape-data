<p>Last week, a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160325043342/http://gothamist.com/2015/11/25/baby_lying_in_a_manger_queens.php">newborn boy was found in the nativity scene</a> of a Queens church. Authorities <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160325043342/http://gothamist.com/2015/11/26/mother_of_baby_abandoned_in_church.php">declined to press charges</a> against the mother after determining that she was trying to leave the infant in the secure, warm place. (According to NY State&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160325043342/http://ocfs.ny.gov/main/safe/info.asp">Safe Haven Law</a>, &quot;A parent is not guilty of a crime if the infant is left with an appropriate person or in a suitable location and the parent promptly notifies an appropriate person of the infant&#x2019;s location.&quot;) Now, the NY Post <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160325043342/http://nypost.com/2015/12/04/manger-mom-speaks-out-on-her-heartbreaking-decision/">has spoken to the mother, an 18-year-old immigrant</a>, who says, &quot;I knew if I left him in God&#x2019;s hands, he would be OK.&quot;</p>

<p>The woman said, &quot;I had just arrived to New York five months ago from Mexico, and nobody knew I was pregnant. I didn&#x2019;t even tell the baby&#x2019;s father in Mexico because I knew I was leaving.&quot; She lives with her mother in Queens and said her mother had no idea she was pregnant: &quot;Throughout the pregnancy, I wore loose-fitting clothes, but I didn&#x2019;t really gain that much weight.&quot;</p>

<p>She says that she gave birth alone: &quot;I was too scared to cut the umbilical cord, so I left it on. I picked him up and carried him out the door with the cord still dangling. I didn&#x2019;t have any baby clothes for him, but I needed to take him someplace safe.&quot;</p><blockquote>I&#x2019;m very religious, and I thought about the Holy Child of Jesus Church. I&#x2019;ve been there before, and the people there are good.<p></p>

<p>I knew if I left him in God&#x2019;s hands, he would be OK.</p>

<p>It was cold outside, and on the way there, I noticed his lips were turning purple. I thought, I don&#x2019;t want him to die, he must be cold.</p>

<p>I ran into the first store I saw and purchased a towel to wrap him in.</p>

<p>I rushed into the church and left him in the manger. He was crying. I just prayed he was warm enough. I knew the priest would find him, and somebody would help him.</p>

<p>I even went back the next day, just to make sure.</p></blockquote>The baby was discovered by the church&apos;s custodian, Jose Moran, who said, &#x201C;I was in the church sweeping. Then I hear a child crying. I didn&#x2019;t make much of it. I thought there was somebody in the church with a child.&quot; <p></p>

<p>While the Administration for Children&apos;s Services is determining the healthy baby&apos;s future, with numerous families <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160325043342/http://www.newsday.com/news/new-york/holy-child-jesus-church-parishioners-suggest-name-for-newborn-was-left-in-a-manger-1.11172720">interested in adopting the boy</a>, the mother confessed, &quot;I would love to be a mom one day, but right now, I don&#x2019;t feel I&#x2019;m ready. I don&#x2019;t know when the right time would be, but I do need a stable job first. It&#x2019;s my baby, and I am still thinking about keeping him. It&#x2019;s not an easy decision.&quot;</p>
