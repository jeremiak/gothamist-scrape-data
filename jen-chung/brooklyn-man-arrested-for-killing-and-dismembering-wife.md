Now authorities have arrested her husband, who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170222135458/http://nypost.com/2017/02/17/man-arrested-for-cutting-up-wife-tossing-body-parts-in-the-trash/">allegedly confessed</a> to fatally beating her and then chopping up her body.<p></p>

<p>Relatives of Diana Rodriguez-Martin, 43, reported her as missing when they hadn&apos;t heard from her since mid-January. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170222135458/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/brooklyn-man-admits-killed-wife-chopped-body-article-1.2975796">According to the Daily News, a police source told them that </a> her husband, Phillip Martin &quot;told family members his wife moved out in the middle of January and took the dog...But when police interviewed him on Thursday, he confessed to fatally punching and then dismembering his wife,&quot; according to their source. </p>

<p>Martin was charged with murder and concealment of a human corpse. However, police are still looking for her remains: Martin allegedly threw out pieces of her body in a dumpster. Yesterday, investigators <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170222135458/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Husband-Arrested-Murder-Dismember-Brooklyn-Woman-414141763.html">were removing items</a> from the couple&apos;s home at 58 Linden Boulevard.</p>

I would hear them arguing all the time, like, &apos;I&apos;ll kill you, I&apos;ll F-you up,&apos; always cursing and fighting, so I&apos;m kind of shocked.&quot;</p>

<p>Another was shocked, &quot;It&apos;s unfathomable, to live in such close quarters with someone who could be capable of these things. You know, it&apos;s just unfathomable.&quot; </p>
