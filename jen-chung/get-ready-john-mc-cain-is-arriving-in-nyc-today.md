<p>A reader in midtown Manhattan wrote:</p><blockquote>I just got word from our building that John McCain will be arriving sometime today at the Hilton at 54th and 6th for his and Palin&apos;s night in the Big Media Elite Den of Sin.  54th Street between 6th and 7th Avenues will be closed at times today and tomorrow, apparently.  If it&apos;s anything like Bush&apos;s visit a little while ago, there will likely also be limited pedestrian access and heavy police presence with snipers on roofs.</blockquote>Ah, yes, the McCain-Palin camp is getting ready for tomorrow&apos;s debate at Hofstra (where McCain has implicitly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140708033742/http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1008/14564.html">promised to mention Ayers</a>!) by coming to town.  Plus, on Thursday, he&apos;ll <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140708033742/http://www.nytimes.com/reuters/arts/entertainment-us-usa-politics-letterman.html">appear on Late Night with David Letterman</a>, though Dave <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140708033742/http://blogs.courant.com/roger_catlin_tv_eye/2008/10/letterman-on-mccains-return.html">expects to be canceled on again</a>.<p></p>

<p>Also, this afternoon, at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140708033742/http://www.booksofwonder.com/events.asp">Books of Wonder</a> on West 18th Street in Chelsea, McCain&apos;s daughter Megan will be &quot;debating&quot; with Bryan Collier.  Megan McCain has written a children&apos;s book about Walnuts&#x2014;<em>My Dad, John McCain</em>&#x2014;while Collier&apos;s book is <em>Barack Obama: Son of Promise, Child of Hope.</em></p>
