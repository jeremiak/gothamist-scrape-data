The establishment &quot;closes for just four days each year: Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Year&#x2019;s, and a certain spring day.&quot;</p><blockquote>A spokesman claims coincidence. &#x201C;We close that day every year for internal construction,&#x201D; he says. &#x201C;The last day of the first week of June.&#x201D; The Puerto Rican Day Parade is on the second Sunday of June each year. </blockquote>Snap!  And a regular confirms to NY that &quot;They tell you the day before&#x2014;they whisper it&#x2014;&#x2018;Don&#x2019;t come tomorrow.&apos;&quot;<p></p>

<p>Back in 2005, Mayor Bloomberg told swanky Fifth Avenue apartment buildings <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170324050021/http://gothamist.com/2005/06/10/mayor_asks_fifth_avenue_to_respect_puerto_rican_day_parade.php">not to board up their doors and windows</a> during the parade because it was insulting.  And last year, there were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170324050021/http://gothamist.com/2007/06/12/puerto_rican_da_1.php">over 200 arrests at the parade</a>, though there were questions over whether the arrests were warranted (some <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170324050021/http://gothamist.com/2007/06/13/more_questions.php">accused the police of sweeping up people</a>, the police said many were involved with gangs).</p>

<p>This year&apos;s parade is on Sunday, June 8.  It starts at 11 a.m., with the festivities traveling north on Fifth Avenue from 44th St. to 86th St.  This year&apos;s Grand Marshal is labor leader Dennis Rivera.</p>
