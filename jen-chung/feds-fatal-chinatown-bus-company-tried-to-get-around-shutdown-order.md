But apparently that couldn&apos;t keep Sky Express from trying to make some money: The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150513050207/http://www2.timesdispatch.com/news/state-news/2011/jun/04/4/tdmain01-us-sky-express-trying-to-evade-shutdown-o-ar-1084598/">Richmond Times-Dispatch reports</a>, &quot;The DOT&apos;s Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration issued a cease and desist order against Sky Express, saying that the company is now trying to operate under the names 108 Tours and 108 Bus.&quot; Yes, there are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150513050207/http://108bus.com/">even websites</a>.<p></p>

<p>According to the feds, Sky Express repainted or was in the middle of repainting buses as well as selling tickets.  The Times-Dispatch adds, &quot;The agency also announced that it has subpoenaed the records of three websites that have sold tickets for Sky Express and several other bus companies. Those websites include GotoBus.com, TakeTours.com and 2001bus.com, the agency said,&quot; (a list of more websites and groups is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150513050207/http://www2.timesdispatch.com/news/state-news/2011/jun/04/4/tdmain01-us-sky-express-trying-to-evade-shutdown-o-ar-1084598/">here</a>).</p>

<p>The bus driver, Queens resident Kin Yiu Cheung, faces charges of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150513050207/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/2011/06/03/2011-06-03_queens_man_who_fell_asleep_at_wheel_of_tour_bus_in_fatal_crash_charged_with_invo.html">four counts of involuntary manslaughter</a> as well as reckless driving; it&apos;s believed he fell asleep at the wheel.  Cheung allegedly told police that when he woke up, he made a hard left turn and the bus overturned.  The Times-Dispatch <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150513050207/http://www2.timesdispatch.com/news/2011/jun/04/2/tdmain01-affidavit-reveals-details-on-fatal-bus-cr-ar-1084596/">looked at the police affidavit</a>: &quot;A passenger told authorities after the crash that she had overheard Cheung on a cellphone complaining about how tired he was and about the fact that he didn&apos;t have much time between trips.&quot;  Chinatown bus drivers typically have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150513050207/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/17/nyregion/17drivers.html">grueling schedules and few places to rest</a>.</p>
