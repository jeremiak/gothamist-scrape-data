</div></div><p>AWWW, Willow the Colorado cat who went missing five years ago, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111030164703/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/15/wow_missing_colorado_cat_found_in_n.php">only to turn up in New York City last week</a>, was reunited with her family today.  Her owners, the Squires family, said the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111030164703/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/16/willow_the_cat_continues_to_charm_b.php">media attention on their cute calico</a> was &quot;surreal,&quot; but they welcomed it if it meant people would be encouraged to microchip their pets.  Matt Lauer couldn&apos;t resist a pun, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111030164703/http://twitter.com/#!/todayshow/status/117192887736872962">noting</a>, &quot;It&apos;s a story that&apos;s making big tabby-loid headlines here in New York.&quot;</p>

<p>Willow had run out of the Squires family&apos; house during a renovation project.  The family looked for her, but, after no luck, assumed she was eaten by coyotes.  Cut to last week, when someone brought in the kitty to a shelter, saying she was found on East 20th Street.  Animal Care &amp; Control found a microchip and contacted the Squireses&#x2014;and the media, launching many theories about how a cat could have traveled the 1,800 miles.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111030164703/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/16/the_mystery_of_willow_the_cat_solve.php">A Gothamist reader shed some light on that</a>.</p>

<p>The reader, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111030164703/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/16/the_mystery_of_willow_the_cat_solve.php">who said she once watched Willow for three months</a>, claimed that a Brooklyn resident skiing in Colorado saw Willow, thought she was a stray (a trip to a local vet did not show any microchip information, which is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111030164703/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/17/how_willow_the_cats_microchip_might.php">definitely possible due to differing microchip technologies</a>) and brought her back to New York.  Our reader added, &quot;She was brought to the shelter by someone who loved her very much, but was unable to give her all the time and attention she deserves.&quot;  If an owner attempts to surrender a cat at NYC ACC, it is a more involved process than someone saying a stray was found on the street.</p>

<p>The Squires family, who are considering <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111030164703/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/16/willow_the_cats_family_grateful_som.php">starting a foundation to educate people about microchipping pets</a> as well as a children&apos;s book, discussed how Willow could have possibly ended up in New York.  Jamie Squires said on the Today Show, &quot;We talked about it, even to [three-year-old daughter] Lola, and I don&#x2019;t think anyone is really ever going to know the actual truth of what actually happened to her. It&#x2019;s better just for us to think she&#x2019;s been off on some great adventure. We travel a lot as a family. It&#x2019;s good to think (Willow) was doing the same thing.&quot;</p>

<p>Here&apos;s video of the Today Show&apos;s segment, which includes a screenshot of Gothamist and a Law &amp; Order &quot;Chung Chung&quot; noise:</p>
