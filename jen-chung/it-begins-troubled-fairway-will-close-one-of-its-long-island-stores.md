<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170112051136/http://gothamist.com/2016/05/03/quintessential_nyc_grocery_chain_fa.php">A month after filing for bankruptcy</a>, Fairway is getting ready to close one of its stores.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170112051136/http://www.newsday.com/business/fairway-market-in-lake-grove-will-close-after-two-years-1.11962339">Newsday reports</a>, &quot;At the entrance of the Lake Grove Fairway supermarket on Friday two signs stated: &apos;Store closing. Everything must go.&apos; A manager at the store referred media inquiries to the corporate office, but did say that July 15 is the tentative closing date.&quot;</p>

<p>The store opened on July 23, 2014:</p>

<p>Two weeks ago, a bankruptcy court judge <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170112051136/http://www.wsj.com/articles/fairway-wins-court-approval-of-restructuring-plan-1465330405">approved the grocery chain&apos;s plans for restructuring</a>. The plan promises that all 4,000 employees will keep their jobs, and the company agreed that it would not change its current collective-bargaining agreements with the union. A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170112051136/https://6304fcf55e9ef542708f-186b32ec0437f2ca73607496115b9408.ssl.cf5.rackcdn.com/FWM-Confirmation-Press-Release-v-4-Final-7.40am-6.8.pdf">press release proclaimed</a>, &quot;Fairway is expected to emerge from bankruptcy during the week of June 20th, 2016 with approximately $50 million in cash, a substantial reduction of its debt by $140 million and a reduction of Fairway&apos;s annual debt service obligations by up to $8 million.&quot; </p>

<p>CEO Jack Murphy said, &quot;Thank you to all the customer who had continued to support Fairway. Our stores are open and stronger than ever.&quot; </p>

<p>The release also noted that a second Brooklyn store, replacing the Waldbaum&apos;s at the Georgetown Shopping Center in Bergen Beach, was still on track to open later this year. We&apos;ve contacted Fairway for comment. </p>

<p>Some of the analysis of &quot;what went wrong&quot; with Fairway was that the investment firm that brought the company to IPO <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170112051136/http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20160219/BLOGS02/160219864/fairway-market-is-on-the-brink-of-default-heres-what-went-wrong">had no experience with grocery stores</a> and it was also expanding at a time when Whole Foods and Trader Joe&apos;s, which have even bigger networks, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170112051136/http://www.marketwatch.com/story/new-york-grocer-fairway-nears-default-as-competitors-close-in-2016-03-02">are making a play for the same customers</a>. </p>

<p>There are currently 15 Fairway locations, including seven in NYC. </p>
