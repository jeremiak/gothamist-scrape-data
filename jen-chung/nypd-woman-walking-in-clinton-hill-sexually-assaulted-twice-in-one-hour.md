<p>Police say that a woman walking on a Brooklyn street was threatened and sexually assaulted twice by two different suspects in one hour.</p>

<p>Both attacks occurred on Sunday, August 31st. At 5 a.m., police say the 32-year-old woman was walking in front of 187 Gates Avenue when a suspect pushed her to the ground and sexually assaulted her. The suspect claimed he had a gun and would use it but did not display it.</p>

<p>Then, at around 6 a.m., the victim was in front of 58 Irving Place when a second suspect pushed her to the ground and sexually assaulted her. Again, the second suspect claimed to have a gun and said he would use it, but never displayed it. </p>

The similarities (between both sexual assaults) are hard to ignore.&quot;<br>
