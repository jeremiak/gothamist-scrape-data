The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522034744/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/city_shuts_hostel_tosses_tourists_IOLhNOG7etpo0EYmWlVUTP?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">Post says</a> &quot;order to vacate&quot; was issued because the building apparently only has one staircase while <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522034744/http://www.ny1.com/1-all-boroughs-news-content/top_stories/117439/dob-shuts-down-harlem-hostel--dozens-stranded">NY1 reports</a> the DOB says it&apos;s an illegal conversion. However, the owner says everything is on the up and up.</p>

<p>According to the DOB website, there are numerous violations for the building at 1961 Adam Clayton Boulevard (7th Avenue), like &quot;ILLEGAL CONVERSION PEOPLE LIVING IN BASEMENT MORE PEOPLE RENTING SINGLE BEDS THERE ARE BUNK BEDS AND THERE ARE MANY BEDS IN THE BASEMENT..THERE IS NOT ENOUGH LIGHT&quot; and &quot;CALLER STATES 4 TO 6 PEOPLE SLEEPING IN ROOM THAT IS LESS THAN 130 SQUARE FEET.&quot;  </p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522034744/http://www.l-hostels.com/">L Hostel</a>&apos;s owner said, &quot;I have the approved plan, and I was shocked by the fact that they are forcing us to kick people to the street with no reason.&quot;  One guest lamented, &quot;All the other hostels are kind of full because no one has been flying these last five days so it&apos;s hard already to find a place.&quot; And one Belgian tourist said she and her friends were initially stuck in Philadelphia, &quot;We decided, why stay in Philly? So we came here.&quot; </p>
