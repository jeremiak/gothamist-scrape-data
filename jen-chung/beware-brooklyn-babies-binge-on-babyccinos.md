<p>Since the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160824114141/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/02/babies_in_brooklyn_bars_makes_it_to.php">babies in bars debate</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160824114141/http://gothamist.com/2010/01/15/park_slope_parents_still_bringing_b.php">is so two years ago</a>, let&apos;s take up the latest baby-and-beverage craze in Brooklyn: Babyccinos, also known as steamed milk topped off with some froth. Burn your tongues, BABY!</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160824114141/http://www.brooklynpaper.com/stories/35/7/all_brooklynbabycinnos_2012_02_17_bk.html">According to the Brooklyn Paper</a>, &quot;Moms and dads in neighborhoods like Park Slope, Fort Greene and Prospect Heights are ordering the small, foamy, surprisingly grown-up beverages for their pint-sized offspring.&quot;  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160824114141/http://www.sitandwonder.org/">Sit and Wonder</a> co-owner Gemma Redwood offers babyccinos&#x2014;off the menu&#x2014;and sells them for $2.  Which sounds pretty good when a half-gallon of milk (probably about 10-13 babyccinos) can cost nearly $5!!  Another version of the babyccino is a decaf cappuccino, which sounds like a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160824114141/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/10/11/health/webmd/main2081503.shtml">horrible idea for children</a> (there&apos;s still caffeine in decaffeinated products, and caffeine is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160824114141/http://kidshealth.org/parent/growth/feeding/child_caffeine.html">linked to 60% of child obesity cases</a>).</p>

<p>The babyccino has been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160824114141/http://www.thebabywebsite.com/article.560.Babyccino.htm">around for nearly a decade</a>: Back in 2003, some British coffee joints were offering babyccinos at no cost while Australian cafes were using them to win adult coffee fiends; Starbucks has been offering them <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160824114141/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/20608492/ns/business-retail/t/starbucks-rethinks-stance-young-customers/#.TzvJm5hZ9SU">since at least 2007</a>.  But Gorilla Coffee is trying to hold the line, with Sean Chin saying, &quot;I have one customer who says that and it annoys the hell out of me. It is not on our menu &#x2014; which we are making an effort to stick to.&quot;</p>
