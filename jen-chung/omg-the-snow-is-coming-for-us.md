And on Long Island, 12-18 inches may be headed there, while NJ <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021221808/http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2009/12/nj_weather_forecast_major_snow.html">may expect 12-20 inches</a>.</p>

<p>An Accuweather meteorologist <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021221808/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2009/12/18/2009-12-18_weather_forecast_is_frightful_new_york_city_braces_for_blizzard_six_inches_of_sn.html">told the Daily News</a>, &quot;It may take a good chunk of the day for the storm to get from Philadelphia up to New York City, but it&apos;s coming. This will be the first widespread significant snow of the season.&quot; And a National Weather Service meteorologist said, &quot;It&apos;s going to be an all day thing. It&apos;s going to be on and off,&quot; but the snowfall <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021221808/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/six_and_the_city_winter_inching_VqNER3H2xbAdFmjnAwr11H">should start in the afternoon</a>.</p>

<p>Air travelers headed out today went to the airports today, in hopes of getting on earlier flights&#x2014; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021221808/http://wcbstv.com/topstories/flight.changes.northeast.2.1379770.html">one told WCBS 2</a>, &quot;We were going to try to get out of New York before the snowstorm. We&apos;re hopeful. There were three flights that we possibly could go on standby, so that&apos;s why we&apos;re here early&quot;&#x2014;while those not going anywhere went to buy salt, shovels and other supplies.  And retailers are worried, as the snow may prevent shoppers from coming in for holiday gifts.</p>

<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021221808/http://answers.polldaddy.com/poll/2406786/">How much snow do you think NYC will get by tomorrow morning?</a><span style="font-size:9px;">(<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021221808/http://answers.polldaddy.com/">polls</a>)</span>

<p>When it snows, you can share your photos with us by sending them to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171021221808/mailto:http://photos@gothamist.com">photos@gothamist.com</a> or tagging them &quot;gothamist&quot; on Flickr.  Fun fact from WCBS 2: &quot;The storm looks like it could very well drop a foot on New York City, but likely will not challenge the 14 inches dropped on Dec. 21-22, 2003. The most snow ever dropped in any one storm on NYC prior to Christmas was 16 inches on Dec. 19-20, 1948.&quot;</p>
