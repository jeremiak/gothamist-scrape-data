At the touch of the leather, I quiver and gasp.&quot;  But don&apos;t laugh&#x2014;women are apparently excited enough to do it with their dudes after reading this!</p>

<p>Since it&apos;s sent moms on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170328015824/http://www.nypost.com/p/entertainment/mamma_mia_TFCh9ZeqKU7QpYDnH2npoL">Upper East Side</a> and elsewhere into a frenzy and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170328015824/http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/46590258/ns/today-books/t/triple-x-trilogy-novels-has-women-talking-quietly/#.T1Db9nJAYiI">prompted a Today show segment</a>, publishers were in a bidding war for the U.S. rights to launch the &quot;Mommy porn&quot; in blockbuster style (it was first published by a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170328015824/http://www.prlog.org/11802565-fifty-shades-of-grey-by-james-finds-success-with-spots-on-two-new-york-times-best-sellers-lists.html">small Australian publishing house</a>).  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170328015824/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/10/business/media/an-erotic-novel-50-shades-of-grey-goes-viral-with-women.html">According to the NY Times</a>, &quot;Publishing executives said the word-of-mouth excitement accompanying &apos;Fifty Shades of Grey&apos; was reminiscent of that accompanying novels like &apos;The Da Vinci Code,&apos; &apos;The Kite Runner&apos; and &apos;Eat, Pray, Love.&apos;&quot;</p>

<p>While some women are raving about it (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170328015824/http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/213752663">sample 5-star review</a> on GoodReads: &quot; Usually, I give 3 stars to all novels with erotic twist, but this one took me by suprise. First of all, all sex parts weren&apos;t pathetic with lots of dumb, sleazy words. And everything actually has a meaning and a story behind&quot;), one Westchester woman told the Times, &quot;What I found fascinating is that there are all these supermotivated, smart, educated women saying this was like the greatest thing they&#x2019;ve ever read. I don&#x2019;t get it. There&#x2019;s a lot of violence, and this guy is abhorrent sometimes.&quot;  Or as another GoodReads reviewer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170328015824/http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/238254153">noted</a>, &quot;I don&apos;t know, this is like the BDSM version of Edward and Bella, and half of the time I don&apos;t know if I should be turned on or scared as hell. Probably both.&quot; And, yes, the book started as Twilight fan-fic.</p>

<p>The author, E.L. James, was unmasked by The Evening Standard as Erika Leonard, has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170328015824/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2110558/Bondage-writer-books-taken-America-storm-British-mother-two.html">referred to the book as her &quot;mid-life crisis.&quot;</a> Indeed: One UES mother of three <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170328015824/http://www.nypost.com/p/entertainment/mamma_mia_TFCh9ZeqKU7QpYDnH2npoL">told the Post</a>, &quot;It&#x2019;s just a fun escape from the daily mundane of trudging kids around and, you know, marriage... The person who recommended it to me said, &#x2018;It will make you want to have sex with your husband.&#x2019; And it did!&quot;</p>
