										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-right"> <img alt="2015_10_kcer.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20171030174338im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2015_10_kcer.jpg" width="300" height="405"> <br> <i style=" width:300px; ;display:block"> (Facebook)</i></div> The autopsy results are in for the Long Island dermatologist who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171030174338/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/05/dermatologist_death_chelsea.php">was left for dead</a> in a Chelsea apartment building vestibule. The NYC Medical Examiner&apos;s Office said that Kiersten Cerveny, 38, died of &quot;acute cocaine and alcohol intoxication.&quot;<p></p>

<p>Cerveny, a married mother of three who lived in Manhasset, was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171030174338/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/04/woman_found_dead_in_chelsea.php">found in the doorway of 221 West 16th Street</a> on the morning of October 4th. She had spent the previous night out with girlfriends at a downtown Manhattan hotel before going to a bar on the Lower East Side. Around 2 a.m., she and her friends met up with Marc Henry Johnson, 51, a TV producer, and later left the bar with Johnson, going to the West 16th Street building at 4:23 a.m. where James Holder lives.</p>

<p>At some point early Sunday morning, Holder and Johnson were seen on videotape carrying <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171030174338/http://abc7ny.com/news/timeline-new-details-revealed-leading-up-to-doctors-death-in-chelsea/1017856/">an &quot;incapacitated&quot; Cerveny down the stairs</a> and &quot;plac[ing] her in the lobby of the building.&quot; Around 8:30 a.m., Johnson allegedly called 911 to say there was an unconscious woman in the lobby, then fleeing when police arrived. Cerveny, who was fully clothed, died at Lenox Hill Hospital Annex.</p>

<p>Police had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171030174338/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/06/dermatologist_overdose.php">suspected an overdose</a> and Holder is a suspected drug dealer (his nickname is &quot;Pepsi&quot;). <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171030174338/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/07/doctor_chelsea_overdose.php">A friend of Cerveny&apos;s told the Post</a> that she wasn&apos;t a drug addict, &quot;She was a bit of a happy drunk, and every blue moon she would go out and tie one on, but she was a good girl... Once she had the second drink, she didn&#x2019;t make the best choices, and it would be up to us to make sure she got home safe.&quot;</p>

<p>Cerveny, who grew up in NJ and won the &quot;America&apos;s Junior Miss&quot; pageant, practiced dermatology in Brooklyn and Manhattan. She and her husband had three young children. A small funeral <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171030174338/http://nypost.com/2015/10/09/small-funeral-held-for-doctor-in-drug-overdose/">was held for her</a>  and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171030174338/http://www.fairchildsons.com/tribute/details/1314/Kiersten_Rickenbach_Cerveny/obituary.html">the funeral home says</a>, &quot;A fund will be established for the college education of Kiersten&apos;s three beautiful children.&quot;</p>
