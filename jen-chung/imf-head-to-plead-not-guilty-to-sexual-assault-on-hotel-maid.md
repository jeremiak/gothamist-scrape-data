</div></div>					<p>After being <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170410002350/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/14/imf_head_arrested_at_jfk_accused_of.php">arrested for allegedly forcing a hotel maid to perform oral sex</a> on him, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the head of the International Monetary Fund, is going to plead not guilty. His lawyer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170410002350/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/imf_boss_strauss_kahn_arrested_in_Kbd7uAi594vbej3oORXfcJ">Benjamin Brafman said</a>, &quot;He denies all the charges against him. And that&#x2019;s all I can really say right now</p>

<p>Strauss-Kahn was removed from an Air France flight to Paris that was 10 minutes from takeoff at JFK Airport yesterday after the alleged incident.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170410002350/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2011/05/15/2011-05-15_dominique_strausskahn_international_monetary_fund_chief_to_plead_not_guilty_in_s.html">According to the Daily News</a>, the 32-year-old maid at the Sofitel in Times Square recounted the attack to the NYPD: </p><blockquote>At about 1 p.m., she walked into Strauss-Kahn&apos;s $3,000-a-night-suite - Room 2806 - at the posh W. 44th St. hotel, thinking it was empty.<p></p>

<p>Strauss-Kahn, who is married to a New York-born journalist, emerged from the bathroom naked, chased her down the hallway in his suite and yanked her into a bedroom, where he sexually assaulted her, the maid told police.</p>

<p>She fought him off, but he dragged her into the bathroom, forced her to perform oral sex and tried to peel off her panties.</p>

<p>At one point, he tried to lock the suite&apos;s door, police said.</p>

<p>The woman escaped, scampered out of the room and alerted a hotel staffer, who called 911, according to cops.</p></blockquote>When police arrived, they found Strauss-Kahn&apos;s cellphone and other belongings there. Police spokesman Paul Browne said, &quot;It looked like he got out of there in a hurry.&quot; Port Authority police officers found him in the Air France flight&apos;s first class cabin, where <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170410002350/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/imf_boss_strauss_kahn_arrested_in_Kbd7uAi594vbej3oORXfcJ">he allegedly said, &quot;What&apos;s this all about?&quot;</a> <p></p>

<p>The 62-year-old, who does not have diplomatic immunity, is a member of France&apos;s Socialist Party and had been eyed as one of the leading challengers to President Nicolas Sarkozy during next year&apos;s election.  However, this accusation appears to have shattered his prospects:  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170410002350/http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/05/15/strausskahn-image-idUSLDE74E0AM20110515">Reuters reports</a>, &quot;The serious nature of the alleged crime means Strauss-Kahn&apos;s reputation will not be spared by a culture in France of turning a blind eye to the sexual antics of politicians, as was the case in 2008 when he emerged apologetic but unscathed from a scandal over an affair with an economist at the Fund,&quot; with a newsstand seller in Paris ominously saying, &quot;Whether it&apos;s true or not, he&apos;s dead.&quot;</p>

<p>And the NY Times, which called reaction in French politics and media as &quot;stunned disbelief and expressions of national humiliation,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170410002350/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/16/world/europe/16france.html?hp">rounds up what the various political parties are saying</a>: &quot; Bernard Debr&#xE9;, a lawmaker in Mr. Sarkozy&#x2019;s center-right UMP party, told French television that the arrest was &apos;a humiliation and an affront to the honor of France. Everyone will now say, &quot;Look at what the French do.&quot; &apos; Mr. Strauss-Kahn&#x2019;s political career, he added, &apos;must be ended &#x2014; he will be condemned.&apos; Fran&#xE7;ois Bayrou, a centrist politician who lost to Mr. Sarkozy in the last race, said he was amazed. <strong>&apos;If the accusations turn out to be true &#x2014; and even if they are proved false &#x2014; this is a degrading thing&apos; for France</strong>, he said.&quot;</p>

<p>But some believe Strauss-Kahn was set up: Christine Boutin of the Christian Democratic part said on French TV, &quot;I really believe that somebody set a trap for Dominique Strauss-Kahn to fall into. That he could be taken in like that seems astounding, so he must have been trapped.&quot;</p>

<p>Strauss-Kahn&apos;s nickname is &quot;The Great Seducer&quot; for his reputation with the ladies during his single days; three years ago (while married), he admitted to an affair with a staffer.  In recent months, he&apos;s been criticized for his lavish lifestyle, which his colleagues say it part of a smear campaign by Sarkozy.</p>

<p>The IMF, which said  it &quot;remains fully functioning and operational,&quot; appointed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170410002350/http://www.france24.com/en/20110515-imf-interim-head-lipsky-strauss-kahn-arrest-usa-france-police-justice-rape">deputy John Lipsky to act as interim head</a>.</p>
