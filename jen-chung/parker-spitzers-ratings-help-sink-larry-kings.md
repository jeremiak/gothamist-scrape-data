In its sixth outing, &#x201C;Parker-Spitzer&#x201D; drew 311,000 Total Viewers and 86,000 A25-54 viewers. That&#x2019;s lower than the previous low for the time period set by Campbell Brown earlier this year... At 9pmET, &#x201C;Larry King Live&#x201D; put up its lowest A25-54 demo viewership since July 2000.&quot;</p>
