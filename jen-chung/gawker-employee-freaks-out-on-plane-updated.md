<p>If you See Something, Say Something on as many social media platforms that your little hands can muster, and your friends will get in touch with the authorities for you! A Facebook status update from a man on a weekend fight to JFK Airport worried his friends enough to apparently contact the authorities. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160414071732/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/book_err_scare_UIq3FNE0OUxyNEvD430SzN"> According to the Post</a>, &quot;A jittery flier sparked a scare after posting about &apos;suspicious&apos; co-passengers on Facebook &#x2014; prompting his online pals to alert authorities, who then scrambled to meet the flight at Kennedy&quot;&#x2014;the authorities take &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160414071732/http://gothamist.com/2009/09/29/suspicious_middle_eastern_men_remov.php">suspicious passengers</a>&quot; very seriously&#x2014;&quot;When confronted, Delta passenger Benjamin Miller Rosen, 25, admitted, &apos;I get nervous on flights.&apos;&quot;  </p>

<p>Rosen <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160414071732/http://advertising.gawker.com/benrosen/">works for Gawker</a> as an advertising operations coordinator.  His <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160414071732/http://www.facebook.com/benmrosen/posts/10100117222317544">most recent Facebook message is</a>, &quot;Again, thanks so much for all your well wishes last night. I had to remove the post (sorry) but there will be more to come on the subject, so if you&apos;re still interested&#x2014;stay tuned.&quot;</p>

<p><b>Update</b>:  Port Authority spokesman Al Della Fave tells us that a passenger on Delta flight 1728 from Las Vegas made several posts on Facebook about the plane being in danger.  Two of the passengers&apos; friends then contacted the TSA and FAA, who in turn contacted Delta corporate.  When the plane landed at Terminal 3, JFK police as well as a member of the Joint Terrorism Task Force met the plane and interviewed the passenger who made the Facebook posts and a flight attendant.  </p>

<p>The passenger, who came up negative on background checks across various databases, was not charged as the authorities determined no crime was committed.  </p>

<p>Rosen is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160414071732/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz5a2xgqITc&amp;context=C48ab05bADvjVQa1PpcFNKa-dupI02u9Wt0nTU68OHSbBqrP0bhI8=">also a stand-up comedian</a>.</p>
