<p>Last week, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140630192252/http://gothamist.com/2014/06/24/video_heres_how_astoria_celebrates.php">residents in Astoria celebrated Greece&apos;s World Cup victory</a> by literally burning rubber. But today, for Brazil&apos;s and Colombia&apos;s triumphs to head into the quarterfinals, the neighborhood involved the police in festivities.</p>

<p>As you can see, cheering crowds spill onto Steinway Street. And, yes, they are surrounding police vehicles. Zachary Leven, who filmed the excitement, tells us the NYPD &quot;showed enormous restraint and were really quite good sports about the whole thing.&quot; The driver of an unmarked police vehicle even lets a reveler use his PA (at the 50 second mark). </p>

<p>If only <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140630192252/http://gothamist.com/2014/06/25/video_triumph_the_insult_comic_dog_1.php">Triumph could have been there</a>.</p>
