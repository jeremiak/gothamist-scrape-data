<p>Yesterday evening, police ended up shooting a man who refused orders to drop a heavy metal link chain that he was using to strike people. But that didn&apos;t stop him&#x2014;the cops also had to use pepper spray.</p>

<p>According to the NYPD, the man was at Third Avenue near 102nd Street in Manhattan, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130717103916/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/cops-blast-chain-nut-harlem-article-1.1363540">terrorizing random people</a>. Around 7:45 p.m., he lunged at a uniformed Housing officer who told him to stop and drop the chain. However, the chain-wielding attacker refused, so the officer fired once, hitting him in the stomach.</p>

<p>The police say, &quot;After falling backwards inside the open door of the store, the assailant got to his feet and, still armed with the chain, continued to advance on the officer and responding back up officers. The suspect was sprayed twice with pepper spray to no apparent effect, and was finally restrained by additional responding officers who surrounded him, brought him to the store floor, disarmed him and took him into custody..&quot;</p>

<p>The suspect was taken to St. Luke&apos;s Hospital. He was not carrying ID and his fingerprints weren&apos;t in the system. </p>
