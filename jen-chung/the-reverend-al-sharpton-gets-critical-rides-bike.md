<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160304155305/http://gothamist.com/2008/05/30/al_sharpton_rid.php">As previously mentioned</a>, the Reverend Al Sharpton joined last night&apos;s Critical Mass rally to highlight, per Times-Up!, a &quot;common pattern of NYPD harassment experienced by diverse groups of law-abiding citizens.&quot;  Bicyclists were joined by Sharpton, Sean Bell&apos;s father William Bell, his fiancee Nicole Paultre Bell and others protesting the fatal police shooting that left a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160304155305/http://gothamist.com/2006/11/26/police_under_fi.php">23-year-old man dead</a> on the day of his wedding.  </p>

<p>Sharpton was expected to be in a pedicab alongside bicyclists, but many were surprised when he mounted a bicycle and rode from Union Square along 14th Street to Fifth Avenue, south on Fifth Ave. to 12th Street, then east across 12th Street and back up University Place to Union Square. Reporters, photographers and his entourage chased him on foot (apologies for the shaky video!).  People shouted words of encouragement or simply did a double take when he pedaled by.  </p>

<p>More about the rally later in the day.  But a video of the Reverend getting some props from various people (after he spent 15 minutes posing for pictures with fans) is below:</p>
