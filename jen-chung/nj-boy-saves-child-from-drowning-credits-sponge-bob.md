In April, a Long Island girl <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151210183313/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/23/girl_saved_by_friends_knowledge_of.php">saved her choking friend</a> when she remembered the episode where SpongeBob Squarepants performs the Heimlich maneuver on Squidward, who accidentally swallowed his clarinet.  Now we learn that an 8-year-old NJ boy pulled a drowning 5-year-old from a lake, thanks again to the wonders of SpongeBob!</p>

<p>A number of families had been swimming in a manmade lake in Washington Township, NJ when little Andrew Gentile started to struggle as he swam in the six-foot deep area of the lake. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151210183313/http://www.courierpostonline.com/article/20100610/NEWS01/100610005/1006">Courier-Post reports</a> that his mother, who thought the water was shallow in that area, jumped in &quot;but she too couldn&apos;t feel the lake&apos;s floor and panicked.&quot;  Enter Reese Ronceray, who says, &quot;I just saw and then I just knew how to react, I jumped in,&quot; swam over to Andrew and grabbed him, putting Andrew&apos;s head in his arms.  Reese added, &quot;<strong>The hardest part was when we both went under, getting us back up to the surface.</strong>&quot;  </p>

<p>Reese said he learned the move from watching SpongeBob Squarepants&#x2014;and his swimming lessons probably helped too.  Gentile&apos;s mother is grateful for Reese&apos;s quick thinking and skills&#x2014;she calls him an &quot;angel&quot;&#x2014;and the 8-year-old has been celebrated at his school and on local radio stations.  But he just wants life to go back to &quot;normal.&quot;  The NYC Parks &amp; Recreation Department offers free swimming lessons&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151210183313/http://www.nycgovparks.org/sub_things_to_do/programs/ap_aquatics.html">check this website</a> or call 311 for more info (programs may start back up when the outdoor pool season opens at the end of the month).</p>
