</div></div>					<p>Yesterday afternoon, dog-owners and dog-lovers gathered in Fort Greene Park for the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408102009/http://www.fortgreenepups.org/events.html">10th Annual Great PUPkin Dog Costume Contest</a>.  Over 50 dogs entered the competition (yes, each pup got to walk around to show off their costumes), those gathered got to &quot;ooh&quot; and &quot;aww&quot; over the cute canines.</p>

<p>In this election year, first prize went to &quot;Joe the Plumber.&quot;  He was definitely the crowd favorite as <strong>he walked around squirting water out of a pipe on his back</strong>.  A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408102009/http://gothamist.com/2008/10/27/pupkin_time_brooklyns_costumed_dogs.php?gallery16172Pic=3#gallery">&quot;Stubborn Doggerpillar&quot;</a> (a dog dressed as a caterpillar) won second place and third place went to a pair of pups who were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408102009/http://gothamist.com/2008/10/27/pupkin_time_brooklyns_costumed_dogs.php?gallery16172Pic=5#gallery">&quot;Peas and Carrots.&quot;</a>   </p>

<p>Politics and other current events were themes for the first and second runners-up: First runner up was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408102009/http://gothamist.com/2008/10/27/pupkin_time_brooklyns_costumed_dogs.php?gallery16172Pic=6#gallery">&quot;Lucy Moosey and Petey the Polar Bear&quot;</a> --with owners dressed as John McCain and Sarah Palin-- and second runner up was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408102009/http://gothamist.com/2008/10/27/pupkin_time_brooklyns_costumed_dogs.php?gallery16172Pic=9#gallery">&quot;Bailout Golden Parachute.&quot;</a>  The third runner up brilliantly utilized bubble wrap--<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408102009/http://gothamist.com/2008/10/27/pupkin_time_brooklyns_costumed_dogs.php?gallery16172Pic=10#gallery">&quot;Lego Copter.&quot;</a>  Other entrants were dressed as that perennial favorite--the doggie bumblebee--and others touched on celebrity: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408102009/http://gothamist.com/2008/10/27/pupkin_time_brooklyns_costumed_dogs.php?gallery16172Pic=17#gallery">Michael Phelps</a>, Laverne (from Laverne &amp; Shirley) and even Brooklyn&apos;s own Borough President, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408102009/http://gothamist.com/2008/10/27/pupkin_time_brooklyns_costumed_dogs.php?gallery16172Pic=16#gallery">Marty Markowitz</a>.</p>

<p>But dogs weren&apos;t the only ones to make an appearance.  As a nice surprise to the audience, the last four-legged animal to walk the circle was a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150408102009/http://gothamist.com/2008/10/27/pupkin_time_brooklyns_costumed_dogs.php?gallery16172Pic=21#gallery">large pot-bellied pig</a>.</p>
