                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2009_04_pirate.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130808204209im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2009_04_pirate.jpg" width="240" height="196" class="image-left"> </span>Yesterday, a group of Somali pirates seized control of the American container ship Maersk Alabama off the coast of Africa. Though the crew managed to regain control of the ship (hence <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130808204209/http://www.nypost.com/seven/04092009/frontback.htm">today&apos;s Post cover</a>), the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130808204209/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/10/world/africa/10pirates.html?hp">NY Times reports</a>, &quot;the pirates were still holding the ship&#x2019;s captain as they fled the ship in an unpowered lifeboat.&quot;  </p>

<p>Now a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130808204209/http://wcbstv.com/national/americans.held.hostage.2.980377.html">U.S. naval warship is monitoring the lifeboat</a>, which is in the Indian Ocean, and the Navy says other warships are en route.  The Maersk line released a statement, &quot;We are working closely with all involved government agencies, particularly the U.S. Navy, which has arrived on the scene and is taking the lead in working toward the captain&apos;s release,&quot; which the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130808204209/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/04/09/AR2009040901304.html?hpid=topnews">Washington Post says</a> suggests that Captain Richard Philips is unharmed.  </p>

<p>This is the first time a ship with an American crew has been hijacked in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130808204209/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horn_of_Africa">Horn of Africa</a>.  The hijacking of the ship has prompted cruises to change their routes&#x2014;Staten Island resident <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130808204209/http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2009/04/staten_island_traveler_says_he.html">is currently on a cruise near Kenya</a>; Margaret Flynn wrote to the Advance, &quot;In addition to the changes in route, another precaution is that security personnel are posted at strategic points on the ship scanning the sea on four-hour watches.<strong> Of course, the ship has radar and other surveillance detection devices, but these small pirate craft may not be detected by these</strong>.&quot;  </p>
