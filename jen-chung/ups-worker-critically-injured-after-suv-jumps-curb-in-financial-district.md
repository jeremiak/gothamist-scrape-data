<p>A veteran UPS worker was critically injured yesterday afternoon while working his route when a SUV <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150518010201/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/UPS-Deliveryman-Struck-SUV-Lower-Manhattan-Beekman-147853655.html">jumped a curb and pinned him against a building</a>.  Mike Rogalle, who the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150518010201/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/veteran-ups-driver-struck-suv-manhattan-critical-condition-article-1.1063260">Daily News says</a> has been working for UPS for 39 years, was on the sidewalk near 15 Beekman Street &quot;when the driver of a red GMC Envoy lost control and zoomed onto the sidewalk, police and coworkers said.&quot;</p>

<p>According to NBC New York, &quot;A woman was behind the wheel of the SUV, and had two small children in her car when she hit the worker, witnesses said. It&apos;s not clear what caused the woman to suddenly swerve. She stopped at the scene and cooperated with police.&quot;  Witnesses said a man came out of the passenger side, holding a baby; the News reports, &quot;Sources at the scene said the man, whose name was not released, works as an FDNY Inspector at MetroTech in Brooklyn,&quot; while a witness said, &quot;He looked very upset,&quot; walking around with the baby, not knowing what to do. He walked in circles, the whole time with the baby in his hands.&quot;</p>

<p>Rogalle was taken to Bellevue Hospital in critical condition while the SUV&apos;s driver was removed from the scene on a backboard with a neck brace.  Witnesses told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150518010201/http://www.dnainfo.com/20120417/downtown/ups-worker-struck-critically-injured-on-beekman-street">DNAinfo</a> and the Daily News that Rogalle was a &quot;sweet heart&quot; and a &quot;great guy,&quot; and were just plain shocked, &quot;<strong>How could you go fast here on these streets? There&apos;s stop signs, there&apos;s construction and congestion. Look at the height of that curb! How fast could she have been going?</strong>&quot;</p>
