And for letting her <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170310004537/http://dcist.com/2012/01/gingrichs_ex-wife_newt_asked_for_op.php">claim he tried to convince her to have an &quot;open marriage&quot;</a> and for asking him about it at the debate? Gingrich told debate moderator, CNN&apos;s John King, &quot;Let me be quite clear. Let me be quite clear. The story is false. <strong>Every personal friend I have who knew us in that period said the story was false. We offered several of them to ABC to prove it was false. They weren&apos;t interested because they would like to attack any Republican</strong>.&quot; But now it turns out Gingrich was, um, false himself.</p>

<p>King <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170310004537/http://www.politico.com/blogs/media/2012/01/gingrich-admits-abc-claim-was-false-112344.html">reported last night</a>, &quot;Tonight, after persistent questioning by our staff, the Gingrich campaign concedes now Speaker Gingrich was wrong &#x2014; both in his debate answer, and in our interview yesterday.<strong> Gingrich spokesman R.C. Hammond says the only people the Gingrich campaign offered to ABC were his two daughters from his first marriage.</strong>&quot; So the only personal friends that Gingrich had during that period were his two daughters?</p>
