One notable suggestion, from former city transportation commissioner Luicius Riccio, was, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111117122230/http://www.nysun.com/new-york/congestion-pricing-is-popular-among-ideas/85907/">per the NY Sun</a>, &quot;that the <strong>city should consider selling the Williamsburg and Manhattan bridges for $1 to the MTA, which could then charge tolls on commuters and use the revenue to finance mass transit improvements</strong>.&quot;  Theodore Kheel, of Nurture New York&apos;s Nature (and good friend of Charles Rangel), also suggested some components of congestion pricing and reiterated <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111117122230/http://gothamist.com/2008/01/07/ted_kheel.php">his call to make the subways free</a>.   The Ravitch Commission, convened by Governor Paterson, will reportedly look at all the ideas--including &quot;congestion pricing lite&quot;--and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111117122230/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/2008/09/16/2008-09-16_extransit_big_sez_mta_should_buy_bridges.html">will issue a report later this year</a> about the state&apos;s growing transportation issues.  Two more hearings <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111117122230/http://www.streetsblog.org/2008/09/05/ravitch-commission-hearings-announced/">will be held this month</a>.</p>
