And, for what it&apos;s worth, when former governor Eliot Spitzer was investigated for <i>his</i> Troopergate scandal, his emails <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111117115823/http://gothamist.com/2007/12/18/spitzer_emails.php">were targeted</a> (and his personal ones <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111117115823/http://gothamist.com/2008/07/25/ethics_panel_says_spitzers_aides_br.php">were published</a>!).</p>
