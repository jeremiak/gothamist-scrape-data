<p>Back in September, it was announced that the Rainbow Room, the dining-and-dancing landmark on the 65th floor of 30 Rockefeller Plaza, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140928192915/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/17/landmark_rainbow_room_to_reopen_in.php">would return this year</a>. Now there are more details.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140928192915/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/07/dining/rainbow-room-will-reopen-in-october.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;_r=0">NY Times reports</a> that Brit Jonathan Wright will be executive chef. Wright has had stints at Belmond Le Manoir aux Quat&#x2019;Saisons in England, &quot;Raffles in Singapore, the Sandy Lane in Barbados, the Setai in Miami Beach and the Windsor Court in New Orleans.&quot; He told the Times, &quot;I&#x2019;ve always been attracted to unusual, special projects that I consider to be &#x2018;one of a kind.&apos;&quot; He also revealed that the menu will be &quot;contemporary American, with what Mr. Wright called French-influenced farm-to-table.&quot;</p>

<p>In a statement, Wright said, &quot;It is an honor to assume the position of Executive Chef for this historic New York City landmark. Cooking in New York City has always been a dream of mine, and the storied Rainbow Room embodies the glamour and allure that I, and so many others, closely associate with this great city. After more than two decades as a professional chef, I am thrilled to have the opportunity to cook on the ultimate stage in the ultimate city.&#x201D;</p>

<p>The restaurant will focus mainly on private functions, but the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140928192915/http://rainbowroom.com/">website confirms</a>, &quot;The Rainbow Room will be open to the public for Sunday Brunch and for &#xE0; la carte dining and entertainment on Monday evenings, beginning in early October.&quot; The Monday night &quot;entertainment&quot; means diners can dance on the famous floor, just like Holden Caulfield.</p>

<p>Further, The Rainbow Room says the cocktail terrace will open a little sooner than the restaurant: &quot;The former Pavilion has been renamed SixtyFive and will be a cocktail lounge with an outdoor terrace, open to the public Monday to Friday evenings starting in late September.&quot; </p>
