<p>When you&apos;re a famous reality baker, you get special treatment from the cops&#x2014;or at least that&apos;s what Buddy Valstro, the &quot;Cake Boss,&quot; thought yesterday morning <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510011918/http://gothamist.com/2014/11/13/cake_boss_buddy_valastro_arrested_f.php">when the NYPD pulled him over</a> for an alleged DWI. Prosecutors say the NJ resident told police officers, &quot;<strong>You can&apos;t arrest me! I&apos;m the Cake Boss!</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>Valastro was driving his discreet yellow Corvette when he was stopped on 10th Avenue near the Hudson Yards at 1 a.m. on Thursday. Apparently he had been weaving, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510011918/http://www.nj.com/hudson/index.ssf/2014/11/buddy_valastro_to_cops_you_cant_arrest_me_im_the_cake_boss_authorities_say.html#incart_m-rpt-1">the Star-Ledger reports</a>, &quot;Police said his face was flushed, and he was unsteady when he got out of his car.&quot;</p>

<p>Valastro also allegedly told the police, &quot;<strong>Can you just put me in a cab? You don&apos;t have to arrest me. I&apos;m not a bad guy.</strong>  Is there anything we can do?&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510011918/http://pagesix.com/2014/11/13/cake-boss-star-got-mouthy-with-the-cops-after-arrest/?_ga=1.109823173.1965030224.1401028033">According to the Post,</a> he blew a 0.108 blood alcohol on the Breathalyzer, above the 0.08 legal limit.</p>

<p>Valastro, who pleaded guilty and is due back in court in January, issued a statement yesterday, &quot;Please know that I want to share and explain to you what happened today and I look forward to doing so at a later date. I appreciate your support and understanding as we handle things privately as a family.&quot;</p>
