<p>There&apos;s a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120419031606/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/18/nyregion/at-brooklyns-is-318-the-cool-kids-are-the-chess-champs.html?_r=1&amp;ref=nyregion">very adorable story in the NY Times about I.S. 318&apos;s chess team</a>, which won the National High School Chess Championships.  That&apos;s right, this Williamsburg middle school team beat high schoolers.  And, still, the chess program is threatened by possible budget cuts!</p>

<p>All sixth grade students take a weekly chess class; in the seventh and eighth grades, they can take it as an elective. According to the Times:</p>

<blockquote>Most of I.S. 318&#x2019;s 1,650 students are from the Williamsburg area, said John Galvin, an assistant principal. But some come for the chess, including the three top players, Justus Williams, from the South Bronx; James Black, from Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn; and Isaac Barayev, from Forest Hills, Queens.

<p>James was 8 when his father brought home a chess set from Kmart, he recalled: &#x201C;It had little cards explaining what moves each piece could make.&#x201D;</p>

<p>His father, James A. Black, said he hoped chess would bring his son a college scholarship, and that it had already shaped his life. &#x201C;The group of people that he hangs with,&#x201D; Mr. Black said, &#x201C;it is everything. He thinks before he acts.&#x201D;</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>A documentary about the program, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120419031606/http://www.brooklyncastle.com/">Brooklyn Castle</a>, was made last year.  On the film&apos;s website, it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120419031606/http://www.brooklyncastle.com/take-action">encourages people to donate to the team</a>: &quot;Eighty-seven percent of the students on the I.S. 318 chess team are from homes with incomes well below the federal poverty line, which is currently just $22,000 for a family of four. The money you donate will help give these students educational experiences they would not otherwise be able to afford. Please help support I.S. 318&#x2032;s chess team. Their funding has been reduced every year for several years now and, as a result, they have had to make very deep cuts.&quot;</p>

<p>And here&apos;s a trailer for the film:</p>
