<p>The New York Film Festival is, as the New Yorker puts it, the &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013516/http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/09/08/fall-preview">key movie event</a> of the fall season,&quot; and there&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013516/http://gothamist.com/2014/08/13/ny_film_festivals_2014_lineup_jean-.php">plenty to choose from</a>. Options include Hollywood awards season fare (<em>Gone Girl</em>, <em>Foxcatcher</em> and <em>Inherent Vice</em>) and art house favorites (the Dardenne brothers&apos; <em>Two Days, One Night</em>), as well as a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013516/http://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/movie-week-all-about-eve">Joseph L. Mankiewicz retrospective</a>, a restored <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013516/http://www.filmlinc.com/nyff2014/films/once-upon-a-time-in-america">256-minute version of <em>Once Upon A Time In America</em></a> and a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013516/http://gothamist.com/2014/08/26/up_to_eleven_this_is_spinal_tap_wil.php">special 30th anniversary screening of <em>This is Spinal Tap</em></a>. And those who enjoy gambling should consider rolling the dice on the &quot;surprise screening,&quot; set for this Sunday, September 28.</p>

<p>The Film Society of Lincoln Center, which puts on the festival, is tight-lipped about what the film might be, only saying, it&apos;s a &quot;surprise screening of a highly anticipated 2015 release, from a NYFF favorite.&quot; Which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013516/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Films_of_the_New_York_Film_Festival">doesn&apos;t help us out too much</a> (Pedro Almodovar? Stephen Frears? The Coen Brothers? Agnieszka Holland?)! While there wasn&apos;t a surprise screening last year, the 2011 surprise screening was Martin Scorsese&apos;s <em>Hugo</em> and, in 2012, Steven Spielberg showed <em>Lincoln</em>. </p>

<p>The screening will be at 6 p.m., Sunday, September 28 at Alice Tully Hall&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013516/http://www.filmlinc.com/nyff2014/pages/nyff52-ticket-info">tickets are on sale now</a>. And here&apos;s a trailer for the festival:</p>
