U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara also specifically accused of Shahzad &quot;conspiring with the Pakistani Taliban to wreak death and destruction in Times Square.&quot;</p>

For instance, he &quot;received explosives training in Waziristan, Pakistan, from explosive trainers affiliated with Tehrik-e-Taliban, a militant extremist group based in Pakistan&quot; in December 2009 and received $5,000 in cash while <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130907120534/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/13/fbi_raids_li_boston_homes_in_times.php">in Massachusetts</a> from a co-conspirator on February 25, 2010 and $7,000 in cash <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130907120534/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/14/shahzad_allegedly_received_money_fr.php">in Rokonkoma</a>, at the same co-conspirator&apos;s direction, on April 10.  The money later went to purchase a 9mm Kel-Tec rifle, the Nissan Pathfinder, and explosives found in the Pathfinder.  </p>
