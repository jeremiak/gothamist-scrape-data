<p>Here&apos;s a fun treat for TV memorabilia fans or just fans of Norman Lear&apos;s groundbreaking sitcom, <em>All in the Family</em>: A jacket worn by fictional Queens resident Archie Bunker, played by the late Carroll O&apos;Connor, was appraised on <em><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170223013801/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/roadshow">Antiques Roadshow</a></em>. A woman bought it from an estate sale of O&apos;Connor&apos;s widow and paid just $40 for the plaid CPO coat!</p>

<p>The episode (which premieres Monday night) was filmed in Palm Springs, and the curious <em>Roadshow</em> attendee explained that when O&apos;Connor&apos;s wife&#x2014;Nancy Fields O&apos;Connor, a documentary producer&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170223013801/http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/nytimes/obituary.aspx?pid=173214146">died in 2014</a>, her daughter-in-law opened up their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170223013801/http://www.latimes.com/business/realestate/hot-property/la-fi-hotprop-carroll-oconnor-20150324-story.html">Malibu home</a> for the estate sale. She described going into a bedroom and realizing the coat looked like it was right out of Archie Bunker&apos;s wardrobe. She said to the daughter-in-law, &quot;These couldn&apos;t possibly be your father&apos;s in law&apos;s clothes,&quot; and got the reply, &quot;Yeah, my mom never threw anything away.&quot;</p>

<p>The attendee said that having the coat &quot;just takes me back to a time when my whole family was together, laughing and having a good time.&quot; And of course, there&apos;s a great reaction to the appraised value: $10,000 to $15,000!</p>

<p>And here&apos;s that famous scene with O&apos;Connor and Sammy Davis Jr., with the plaid coat in the background:</p>
