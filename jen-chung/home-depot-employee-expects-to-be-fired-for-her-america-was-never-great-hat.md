<p>The Staten Island Home Depot employee/folk hero who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016142900/http://gothamist.com/2016/05/19/america_was_never_great_hat.php">wore an &quot;America Was Never Great&quot; hat</a> probably won&apos;t be working there for much longer. Krystal Lake, 22, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016142900/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/21/nyregion/trump-hat-death-threats.html?_r=0">told the NY Times</a> that &quot;she expected to be fired from her job, which she has held for nearly two years.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016142900/http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2016/05/home_depot-workers_america_was_never_great_hat.html#incart_big-photo">On Sunday</a>, Lake wore the hat at the home improvement store&apos;s Forest Avenue location where a customer took her photograph and put it on social media. The image went viral, and Lake has received numerous death threats while Home Depot is getting threats of customer boycotts. </p>

<p>Home Depot has said employees are prohibited from wearing items that &quot;reflect political statements&quot; and added that if a manager had seen the hat, Lake would have been told to take it off. But Lake suggested that management turned a blind eye, &quot;For the past two months, there have been a few people I work with wearing &apos;Vote for Trump&apos; pins on their uniforms... But no one ever says anything to them.&quot;</p>

<p>A Home Depot spokesperson <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016142900/http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2016/05/home_depots_uniform_policy_say.html#incart_most-read_">told the Advance</a>, &quot;I&apos;m not going to be specific about a single individual, but I can tell you that if someone refuses to follow any of our policies -- not just dress code&#x2014;it can lead to termination... While we respect the personal opinions and beliefs held by associates and customers, the store (or wearing these things while working) isn&apos;t an appropriate place to promote or display personal opinions, beliefs, political and religious affiliations or any type of proselytizing.&quot;</p>

<p>The Times reports, &quot;Ms. Lake said that she called in sick on Thursday and that a manager had contacted her to ask about her well-being... She said she was set to graduate in two weeks with a degree in media studies from the College of Staten Island and wanted to pursue a career in music, radio, social media or journalism. She has already started looking for jobs in those fields.&quot; </p>

<p>Lake also plans to buy more hats.</p>

<p>As for her opinion of America, she said earlier in the week, &quot;The point of the hat was to say America needs changing and improvement. I don&apos;t think it&apos;s a positive message to say, &apos;Let&apos;s look to the past.&apos; ... I don&apos;t hate America. I know there are a lot of opportunities here. I just wish we would worry about making America better&#x2014; not &apos;great again.&quot;</p>
