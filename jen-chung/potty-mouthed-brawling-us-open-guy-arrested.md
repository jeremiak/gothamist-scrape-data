Well, Manhattan resident Joseph Pedevill is back in the news&#x2014;and it&apos;s allegedly over an interview one of his neighbors did with the NY Post!</p>

<p>Pedevill&apos;s neighbor, Peter Scheider, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429171808/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/queens/us_open_brawlers_bounced_qqYY6BxnIXdjKTz8B5QKTI">told the Post</a> in a September 4 article that the 27-year-old was &quot;an insane nut.&quot;  Now the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429171808/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/kill_er_serve_1gijza4w6ouzoRj7VBQdLP?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">Post reports</a>, &quot;Days after Scheider ripped him in The Post, Pedevill accosted him outside their building and screamed, &apos;You f- -king a- -hole!&quot; according to a criminal complaint.<strong> &apos;You are going to get it. You are going to see what is going to happen to you. I am going to kill you.&apos; </strong> The alleged threat violated the terms of the restraining order. Pedevill was arrested yesterday morning and released without bail.&quot;  </p>

<p>Scheider got a restraining order from Pedevill last year because he claimed Pedevill damaged his car.  Pedevill, who is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429171808/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/04/us_open_brawlers_file_harassment_ch.php">banned from the US Open for two years</a>, denied threatening his neighbor and added, &quot;It&apos;s not just me,. Other people in the building have problems with him.&quot; Video or it didn&apos;t happen.  </p>
