<p>Pringles are delicious and come in a wonderful cylindrical container that can be very good for storing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130512023120/https://www.tlgcanada.com/products.php?product=Can-Safe-%252d-Pringles-Potato-Chips-Can">valuables</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130512023120/http://www.google.com/imgres?um=1&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=N&amp;biw=1258&amp;bih=758&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbnid=JtqplFGolD1L2M:&amp;imgrefurl=http://weinterrupt.com/2011/06/our-most-humble-receptacle-pringles-pioneer-buried-in-his-can/&amp;docid=RD62yjcL5vAiDM&amp;imgurl=http://weinterrupt.com/wp-content/uploads/Pringles.jpg&amp;w=640&amp;h=551&amp;ei=Ui5jUaLSKLi14AO67YCgCw&amp;zoom=1&amp;ved=1t:3588,r:6,s:0,i:130&amp;iact=rc&amp;dur=303&amp;page=1&amp;tbnh=182&amp;tbnw=212&amp;start=0&amp;ndsp=19&amp;tx=95&amp;ty=22">cats</a>. But one NJ man took things too far when he allegedly tried using his Pringles can for his cocaine!</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130512023120/http://www.nj.com/bergen/index.ssf/2013/04/police_new_york_man_hid_2500_of_cocaine_in_pringles_can.html#incart_m-rpt-1">According to NJ.com</a>, a Palisades Interstate Parkway police officer stopped a BMW near exit 4 in Alpine because it had tinted windows and unclear plates. The driver, Rasheed Jerimine, allowed the officer to search the car and the cop &quot;found a yellow plastic bag that contained more than 100 small aluminum foil wraps, two digital scales and a Pringles can with a false bottom, police said. When he opened the bottom, [Officer] Peralta <strong>found 48 grams of cocaine inside two sandwich bags</strong>, police said.&quot; FWIW, 48 grams is less than 2 ounces.</p>

<p>Jerimine, a Spring Valley, NY resident, was charged with drug possession and distribution charges. Of course, the charges will probably be dropped when Pringles reveals this was all just an <em>edgy</em> viral marketing stunt. </p>
