<p>President Barack Obama will be in town later today, to chat with the ladies of The View, raise money and, of course, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120515040816/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/03/president_obama_to_speak_at_barnard.php">give the commencement speech at Barnard College</a>.  Tickets are needed for commencement (naturally, security at the campus will be tight)&#x2014;but don&apos;t worry, you can watch the speech live at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120515040816/http://barnard.edu/commencement/webcast">Barnard&apos;s website</a>, at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120515040816/http://WhiteHouse.gov/">WhiteHouse.gov</a> and on CSPAN.  <b>Update</b>: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120515040816/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/14/president_obama_at_barnard_receives.php">Here&apos;s a transcript of his speech</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120515040816/http://www.whitehousedossier.com/2012/05/13/obama-schedule-monday-14-2012/">According to White House Dossier</a>, here&apos;s the President&apos;s schedule:</p><blockquote>9:35 am || Departs White House<br>
10:45 am || Arrives New York<br>
1:10 pm || Delivers commencement address at Barnard College<br>
3:00 pm || Tapes an appearance on The View<br>
5:05 pm || Delivers remarks at a fundraiser, Rubin Museum of Art<br>
6:50 pm || Delivers remarks at a fundraiser; private residence<br>
8:30 pm || Departs New York City<br>
9:40 pm || Arrives White House</blockquote>Obama&apos;s decision to speak at Barnard came shortly after a firestorm over how conservative radio heavyweight Rush Limbaugh <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120515040816/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/02/troll_rush_limbaugh_cant_stop_wont.php">called a Georgetown Law student a &quot;slut&quot;</a> (the student, Sandra Fluke, was testifying why birth control should be covered by insurance).  After that incident, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120515040816/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/10/obama_discusses_birth_control_its_n.php">Obama said</a>, &quot;Whether you&#x2019;re a teacher, or a small businesswoman, or a nurse, or a janitor, no woman&#x2019;s health should depend on who she is or where she works or how much money she makes. Every woman should be in control of the decisions that affect her own health. Period.&quot;  And when confirming his speech at Barnard, a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120515040816/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/04/us/politics/obama-will-speak-at-barnard-graduation.html?_r=1">White House official said</a>, &quot;As the father of two daughters, President Obama wanted to speak to some of America&#x2019;s next generation of women leaders.&quot; <p></p>

<p>Of course, we wonder if Obama <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120515040816/http://sfist.com/2012/05/09/breaking_president_obama_announces.php">will discuss same-sex marriage</a>&#x2014;Mayor Bloomberg <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120515040816/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/13/bloombergs_blasts_ncs_ban_on_same-s.php">denounced North Carolina&apos;s ban on same-sex marriage</a> while delivering the commencement speech at UNC.</p>
