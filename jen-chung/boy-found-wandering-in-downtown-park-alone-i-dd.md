Now, the boy&apos;s been identified... and his mother is in a hospital.  <p></p>

<p>Relatives in NJ called police to identify him (police were reportedly going to speak to them last night). <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427135057/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2011/07/25/2011-07-25_toddler_abandoned_in_battery_park_city_nypd_asks_for_publics_help_to_identify_bo.html">According to the Daily News</a>, cops found his mother in the psych ward, &quot;The 20-year-old mother, whose name was not released, is in Bellevue Hospital, where she had been admitted as an emotionally disturbed person.&quot;  It&apos;s unclear whether she was placed there before the boy was found (which is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427135057/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/tot_found_wandering_downtown_GF3pgkrL4DmcQMOjtiWYjP">what the Post&apos;s sources suggest</a>) or if the cops tracked her down yesterday and then <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427135057/http://www.wpix.com/news/wpix-boy-found-nyc-park,0,5568318.story">took her to the hospital</a>.  </p>

<p>Trevon had Chicken McNuggets at Tribeca&apos;s police stationhouse (he was also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427135057/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/tot_found_wandering_downtown_GF3pgkrL4DmcQMOjtiWYjP">&quot;calmed down&quot; with a Giants blanket</a>), and the News says he was taken into temporary foster care, &quot;About 8:45 p.m. workers from the Administration for Children&apos;s Services took him from the stationhouse with a blanket over his head to shield him from TV news cameras waiting outside.&quot;</p>
