<p>After <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429171612/http://gothamist.com/tags/racino">years of development and various corruption allegations</a>, today a casino complete with over 2,000 slot machines and 2,000 electronic game tables<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429171612/http://origin.ny1.com/content/top_stories/149790/aqueduct-racino-lights-up--opens-to-public"> opened up</a> at the Queens Aqueduct Racetrack. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429171612/http://www.rwnewyork.com/">Resorts World New York</a> has a shuttle bus for eager gamblers (there&apos;s subway service to Aqueduct Racetrack Station only on race days, 11 a.m. to 7 p.m.).  However, the crowd is so big that our reporter on the scene has been waiting there for nearly two hours for the bus and the NYPD just put out a &quot;crowd control&quot; for Rockaway Boulevard &amp; 101 Street.  What recession?!?!</p>

<p>Until we get our report from Nicole Woszczyna (she&apos;s enduring the largest line ever to get onto a bus to play the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429171612/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/queens/sex_machines_XoAvu3s0XWw5eJj6xHKPWK">Sex and the City slot machine</a>), here are some tidbits: It&apos;s believed that over 1,300 jobs will be created, thanks to the opening of the casino, besides the construction work generated by the building.  Local business people seem pretty excited&#x2014;the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429171612/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/queens/2011/10/28/2011-10-28_place_yer_bets_starting_today_you_can_take_the_train_to_the_games.html">Daily News spoke to a few</a>. A barbershop owner said, &quot;We can&apos;t wait till it opens. It&apos;s going to bring people here from other cities, people who didn&apos;t even know where we were on the map. People do have concerns, saying the casino may also bring drugs and prostitution, but I&apos;m not sure that would even happen. For us it would mean more business,&quot; while a real estate broker thinks, &quot;This casino will do for us what the other casino did for Yonkers. People know where Yonkers is now.&quot;</p>
