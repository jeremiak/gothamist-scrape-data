</div></div>					<p>A police officer was killed and eight others were injured when a police van crashed in the Bronx this morning. </p>

<p>According to the NYPD, the van was traveling westbound on the Bruckner Expressway when it crashed near Bryant Avenue around 5:08 a.m.. One male officer was pronounced dead at Lincoln Hospital while the other cops were taken to St. Barnabas and Jacobi Hospitals. </p>

<p>A police spokesperson said the van&apos;s driver and passengers were all officers from the 47th Precinct heading to a detail, adding that the officer taken to Jacobi was a female who was originally in critical condition but is now in stable condition, &quot;Thank God.&quot;</p>

<p>One of the officers was ejected from the van. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013549/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2014/09/21/officer-dies-in-nypd-van-crash-in-hunts-point/">WCBS 2 reports</a> that one driver, William Soto, &quot;saw paramedics treating the van&#x2019;s driver, who was bleeding from the head.&quot; </p><blockquote>&#x201C;They put the neck brace on his neck,&#x201D; Soto said. &#x201C;They had another officer sitting on the ground. And I guess, for precuation, they put him in the ambulance afterwards. Then they had another officer standing; I guess, also for precaution, they had him on the board and also took him to the hospital.<p></p>

<p>&#x201C;Then a passerby told me, &#x2018;Oh, there was another cop laying in the middle of the highway on the Bruckner,&apos;&#x201D; Soto continued. &#x201C;He was all mangled up. So he might have been ejected out of the side doors somehow.&#x201D;</p></blockquote><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013549/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/1-Officer-Dead-8-Injured-in-NYPD-Van-Crash-Hunts-Point-Bronx-275924031.html">Soto told NBC New York</a> the driver looked &quot;like he was trying to gasp for air.&quot; <b>Update</b>: The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013549/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/22/nyregion/fatal-police-crash-in-the-bronx.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">NY Times says</a> the cop who was killed was riding in the van.<p></p>
