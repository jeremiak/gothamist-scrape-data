<p>Earlier this month, an upstate NY high school student lobbied to have his school yearbook senior class photograph consist of an endearing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013221/http://gothamist.com/2014/09/11/upstate_teen_demands_portrait_with.php">portrait of himself with his cat Mr. Bigglesworth and some lasers</a>. But the school declined, opting for uniformity. Nevertheless, Schenectady High School ultimately <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013221/http://gothamist.com/2014/09/17/teen_cat_lasers_yearbook.php">agreed to another compromise photograph</a>. And it&apos;s spectacular.</p>

<p>Student Draven Rodriguez had initially argued, &quot;I don&#x2019;t want to go in the yearbook with the generic &#x2018;I-look-like-everyone-else&#x2019; photo. I wanted a &#x2018;He looks great. Only he would try that&#x2019; photo.&quot; When the photograph went viral, the school <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013221/http://gothamist.com/2014/09/17/teen_cat_lasers_yearbook.php">reached a compromise with the teen</a>, opting to have him pose with Mr. Bigglesworth with school principal Diane Wilkinson and her dog Vivienne (and lasers). </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013221/http://www.buzzfeed.com/ryanhatesthis/laser-cat-meets-laser-chihuahua#1ay0fp1">According to Buzzfeed</a>, &quot;Vincent Giordano, the photographer behind the shoot, [said] Mr. Bigglesworth was very curious about all the lighting and camera gear and Vivienne was a little nervous at first. &apos;Diane and Draven were all laughs, they really enjoyed the photo session,&apos; Giordano said. &apos;Vivienne and Mr. Bigglesworth really broke the rules of cats and dogs and got along famously for a trouble free photo session!&apos;&quot; </p>

<p>The photograph will be part of the principal&apos;s page and will raise awareness about the ASPCA and rescue animals.</p>
