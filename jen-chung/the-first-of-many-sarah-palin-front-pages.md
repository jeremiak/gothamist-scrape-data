<p>With the first female on the Republican ticket, John McCain pulled off quite a feat by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140401031204/http://gothamist.com/2008/08/29/sarah_palin_is_the_first_republican.php">introducing Sarah Palin</a>, first term Governor of Alaka, as his running mate.  But with 66 days till the general election, the excitement of the choice will give way to many questions.</p>

<p>The resounding feeling is that McCain was bold enogh for him to &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140401031204/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/29/AR2008082903558.html?hpid=topnews">reclaim his maverick image</a>&quot;, but the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140401031204/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/30/us/politics/30assess.html?ref=politics">pick has its risks</a>. (One Republican operative <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140401031204/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/republican_race/2008/08/29/2008-08-29_brilliant_move_or_female_quayle.html">tells the Daily News</a>, &quot;I want to believe this is a game-changer, but when I close my eyes I see New Orleans in 1988. <strong>Democrats will have a field day typecasting her as Quayle in a pantsuit</strong>.&quot;)  The pair <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140401031204/http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0808/12988.html">only met once</a>--at a National Governors Association meeting in February--before they discussed this position on the phone this past Sunday.  The clip being played over and over again is her statement from July, wondering what a VP does:</p>

<p>As for the papers&apos; editorials, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140401031204/http://www.nypost.com/seven/08302008/postopinion/editorials/north_to_alaska_126762.htm">NY Post is excited</a> her reformer credentials and even suggests her experience as mayor of a town of 9,000 &quot;gives her substantially more executive experience than Barack Obama or Joe Biden combined.&quot; The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140401031204/http://www.nydailynews.com/opinions/2008/08/30/2008-08-30_a_mavericks_maverick.html">Daily News says</a>, &quot;Politically, she adds up,&quot; noting her down-to-earth mom-of-five persona--as well as appeal with social conservatives.  The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140401031204/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122004983609584755.html?mod=opinion_main_review_and_outlooks">Wall Street Journal calls</a> McCain-Palin a &quot;Reform Ticket,&quot; and believes she would &quot;<strong>bring some first-hand realism to the debate over drilling and the environment</strong>.&quot;  </p>

<p><img alt="2008_08_palinpitt.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20140401031204im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2008_08_palinpitt.jpg" width="280" height="244" class="left">The NY Times calls the selection of Palin &quot;<strong>heartening</strong>,&quot; because the GOP &quot;has hardly been a champion of diversity in recent memory,&quot; but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140401031204/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/30/opinion/30sat2.html?ref=opinion">points out</a>,  &quot;<strong>Governor Palin&#x2019;s lack of experience, especially in national security and foreign affairs, raises immediate questions about how prepared she is to potentially succeed to the presidency.</strong> That really is the only criterion for judging a candidate for vice president.&quot;  The Washington Post <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140401031204/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/29/AR2008082902273.html">has similar concerns</a>, noting that McCain considers foreign policy and national security to be America&apos;s top challenge.</p>

<p>And Hillary Clinton, who hoped to head into the executive office, said, &quot;We should all be proud of Governor Sarah Palin&apos;s historic nomination, and I congratulate her and Senator McCain. While their policies would take America in the wrong direction, Governor Palin will add an important new voice to the debate.&quot;  However, one of her supporters, Debbie Dingell (wife of Rep. John Dingell of Michigan), <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140401031204/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/29/AR2008082903611.html?hpid=topnews">told the WaPo</a>, <strong>&quot;This is just sheer political pandering. I don&apos;t think women are going to buy it.</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>Obama <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140401031204/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/08/30/60minutes/main4400811.shtml">said in a 60 Minutes interview</a> (which will air tomorrow night) that one of the reasons why he picked Biden is &quot;I want the counsel and advice of somebody who&apos;s not going to agree with me 100 percent of time - in fact, somebody what&apos;s independent enough that can push back and give me different perspectives and make sure that I&apos;m catching any blind spots that I have.&quot;</p>
