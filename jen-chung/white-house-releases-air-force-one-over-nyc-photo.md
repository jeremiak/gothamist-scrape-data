<p>The White House spent up to $357,000 for the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150918185217/http://gothamist.com/2009/04/27/department_of_defenses_plan_to_scar.php">Presidential Airlift Group</a>&#x2014;which includes the 747 that is Air Force One when the President is on board and a military fighter jet escort&#x2014;to fly over lower Manhattan and take pictures&#x2014;and <i>this</i> is the photograph they release?  It&apos;s really mediocre&#x2014;we guess they didn&apos;t want to spend the money/time to Photoshop it up. And why not at least give us a shot of the darn plane in front of the lower Manhattan skyline?  <em>Or is that too good for us?</em></p>

<p>The White House released the above photograph and a report about the seriously ill-advised plan to have the planes fly over lower Manhattan on April 27&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150918185217/http://gothamist.com/2009/04/27/buildings_evacuated_as_air_force_on.php">freaking out New Yorkers who remember 9/11</a>.  Plus, the White House aide who ordered the photo op, Louis Caldera, resigned from his position as director of the White House Military Office.  </p>

<p>Here&apos;s a link to the report (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150918185217/http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/politics/20090508_AF1_Report.pdf">PDF</a>): Apparently the Deputy Director George Mulligan sent an email to Caldera on April 24:</p><blockquote>Sir: per our conversation about [the airlift group&apos;s commandeer, Colonel] Scott Turner&apos;s plans to fly over the Statue of Liberty - it&apos;s scheduled for this Monday, April 27th. All has been coordinated. AF PA plan/statement is below and will be released only if asked. Will probably receive some local press, but WH shouldn&apos;t catch any questions about it. Provided in case you want to pass to Jim Messina or Robert Gibbs for awareness. This is an AF operation, in close coordination with FAA. Happy to discuss with you as necessary.</blockquote>Of course, deputy chief of staff Jim Messina and press secretary  Robert Gibbs weren&apos;t told.  <p></p>
