The provocative, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522103452/http://gothamist.com/2009/09/25/bibi_shows_the_proof_to_ajad.php">disbelieving</a> Iranian leader is back in the news for some remarks he made to the Iranian Intelligence Ministry, calling the September 11, 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center a &quot;complicated intelligence scenario and act.&quot;</p>

<p>He also said, &quot;The September 11 incident was a big fabrication as a pretext for the campaign against terrorism and a prelude for staging an invasion against Afghanistan.&quot;  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522103452/http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE6251AO20100306">According to Reuters</a>, &quot;He did not elaborate.&quot;  Ahmadejnijad has repeatedly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522103452/http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5ixeFBxfLzaSjs8Mb8cuFmtPOT6-wD9E9A7U80">brought up the attacks</a>, once saying, they were &quot;a result of mismanaging and inhumane managing of the world by the U.S.&quot;</p>

<p>When Ahmadenijad visited NYC in 2007, his request to visit Ground Zero was turned down. He later told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522103452/http://gothamist.com/2007/09/24/ahmadinejad_spe.php">an audience at Columbia University</a>, &quot;I wanted to speak with the press, the September 11 tragic event was a huge event. It led to a lot of other events after that. After 9/11, Afghanistan was occupied and then Iraq was occupied.&quot;</p>
