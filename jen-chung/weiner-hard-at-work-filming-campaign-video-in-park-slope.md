Several former Congressional aides, as well as outsiders whom Mr. Weiner has sought to recruit, have also turned him down.&quot; </p>

<p>He hired Danny Kedem, 30, as his campaign manager; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160904183813/http://www.politico.com/story/2013/05/anthony-weiner-hires-campaign-manager-91387.html">according to Politico</a>, &quot;Kedem&#x2019;s resume includes a handful of other congressional runs and mayoral races, as well as field organizing work on Hillary Clinton&#x2019;s presidential run.&quot; The Times mentioned Kedem&apos;s name to Jonathan Prince, a former White House staffer working for mayoral candidate Bill Thompson, who said, &quot;Never heard of him before.&quot; </p>
