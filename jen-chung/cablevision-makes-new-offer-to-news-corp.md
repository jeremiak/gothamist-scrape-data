Simply put: we agree to pay the rate Fox charges Time Warner Cable for carriage of WNYW-Fox 5 New York and WTXF-Fox 29 Philadelphia for a period of one year.  This is higher than the rate we pay any other New York broadcast station.  This solution is in the best interest of not only baseball fans but of all Cablevision customers and Fox viewers.  We look forward to a positive response.&#x201D; </p>
