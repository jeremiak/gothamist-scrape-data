<p>According to the NYPD, at around 6:44 p.m. outside of 490 Eighth Avenue (between 34th and 35th Streets), two men, a 22-year-old and a 28-year-old, were walking down the street when a group of four men started to &quot;verbally harass&quot; them with &quot;anti-gay remarks. Members from the group further approached the victims, pushed them to the ground and began punching [the 28-year-old] in the face, causing him to sustain a nasal fracture. [The 22-year-old] sustained bruising to his right hand. Both victims were treated and released from Bellevue Hospital.&quot; </p>

<p>The 28-year-old, fashion designer Nick Porto, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506173805/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/cops_probing_alleged_bias_attack_osCzlJm6t53STXzlueawMP?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20Manhattan">posted on Facebook</a>, &quot;My partner Kevin [Atkins] and I got jumped yesterday in broad daylight in midtown. A group of Knicks fans were upset about the game and they just decided to &#x2018;fag bash&#x2019; the two of us. They broke my nose and his wrist, and broke several hundreds of dollars worth of personal property.&quot;</p>

They made fun of my jeans &#x2014; I made the jeans myself, for that day.&quot; He says he turned around to ask why they were yelling at him, and that&apos;s when the attack started, &quot;Fists started flying. I was on the ground, and the only thing I could do, I reached out and grabbed someone&apos;s hair.&quot; Porto was also regretful, &quot;It&apos;s my fault, I spoke back to them &#x2014; that Kevin was hit. He didn&apos;t deserve it whatsoever. I was that idiot that should have just walked away.&quot;</p>

<p>The police describe the persons of interest as Hispanic men in their 20s and released surveillance images of one person of interest as a being about 6&apos; with brown hair and a tattoo on his left forearm, last seen wearing a white t-shirt, white sneakers, jeans and a &quot;Knicks&quot; #7 jersey.</p>
