<p>Earlier this week, a woman was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150410012049/http://nypost.com/2014/07/09/woman-trapped-in-a-hyperbaric-chamber/">trapped in a hyperbaric chamber</a> at a Manhattan spa. Now, it turns out the woman was beloved performance artist Laurie Anderson.</p>

<p>Earlier news reports explained that the then-unidentified woman had an oxygen therapy treatment at Pure Flow in Chelsea, but became uncomfortable. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150410012049/http://nypost.com/2014/07/09/woman-trapped-in-a-hyperbaric-chamber/">According to the Post</a>, she &quot;tried to unzip herself from inside the blue hyperbaric tube at Pure Flow on West 15th Street near Eighth Avenue around 9 a.m. &#x2014; but the zipper got stuck and she panicked, authorities said. As she struggled to breath, she shouted to employees but nobody heard her, the sources said. She frantically began texting a friend, who called 911 at around 9:15 a.m., authorities said.&quot; </p>

<p>A firefighter found the stressed-out singer standing by herself when he entered the room where Anderson and other customers pay $100 for an hour of oxygen treatment.</p>

<p>Pure Flow owner Andrew Barile said the woman was inside the chamber for about 45 minutes and suggested she fell asleep and became disoriented after waking up.</p>

<p>&#x201C;There was a miscommunication on the timing,&#x201D; he said, denying any malfunction.</p></blockquote>Anderson is the widow of rock legend Lou Reed, and the Daily News&apos;s front page acknowledges this (under LeBron James):<p></p>

<p>A certified hyperbaric tech told the Daily News, &quot;It was probably safe for her to use her phone, but she should never have been left alone. That&#x2019;s a real danger.&quot;</p>
