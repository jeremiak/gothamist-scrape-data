</div></div>					<p>One of the people injured during <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144943/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/14/chris_brown_tweets_photo_of_injured.php">Chris Brown and Drake&apos;s brawl at WiP</a> earlier this morning told TMZ she was hit by a flying bottle&#x2014;and offered up some bloody pictures! </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144943/http://www.tmz.com/2012/06/14/chris-brown-fight-innocent-bystander-bottle-photos/">According to the gossip site</a>, &quot;Hollie C. -- a 24-year-old Australian tourist... went to club W.i.P. Wednesday night with some friends.  Hollie tells us she was hanging out and having a good time when the brawl exploded between Brown&apos;s entourage and Drake&apos;s entourage.&quot;  She said, &quot;Within a few moments of noticing glass being thrown around, I saw a glass bottle headed towards me; consequently hitting me in the head... I immediately started to bleed and proceeded to fall in and out of consciousness.&quot;</p>

<p>Hollie says she went to the hospital by herself and got 16 stitches and a tetanus shot. She did file a police report after leaving the hospital, but said, &quot;I had to take the subway home with no money or jacket. Nobody would even sit beside me. My friends were so scared because they did not know where I was.&quot; </p>

<p>And now the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144943/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/chris_brown_injured_rihanna_bar_xVPvdF4q1rudKWQ7udnnQO?utm_source=SFnewyorkpost&amp;utm_medium=SFnewyorkpost">Post says that the brawl started</a> when &quot;Drake taunted Brown in a note, &apos;I&apos;m f--kng the love of your life [Rihanna], deal with it.&apos;&quot; A source said, &quot;They were on opposite sides of the room, Drake went over to the middle of the club to talk to someone, then words were exchanged with Chris and his entourage... It looked like Drake&apos;s entourage started it. Both Chris and Drake had their own security with them.&quot; </p>

<p>However, Drake&apos;s spokesperson said, &quot;Drake did not participate in any wrongdoing of any kind last night at W.i.P. He was on his way out of the club when the altercation began. He did not engage in any activity which resulted in injury to person or damage to property.&quot;</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506144943/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/14/chris_brown_tweets_photo_of_injured.php">police are investigating the incident</a>, which injured at least four other people.  Brown had sparked talk of a brawl when he Tweeted a photo of his gashed chin.</p>
