<p>Today is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130609234726/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saul_Bass">Saul Bass</a>&apos;s 93rd birthday. You may not know who Saul Bass is, but you&apos;ve probably seen his work at some point&#x2014;he designed the opening title sequences and posters for films&#x2014;like Alfred Hitchcock&apos;s North By Northwest, Psycho and Vertigo&#x2014;as well as the corporate logos to United Airlines and AT&amp;T.; Which is why Google&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130609234726/http://www.google.com/">Google Doodle</a> is all about Bass. There&apos;s a great animation, too!</p>

<p>The films referenced in the Doodle are <em>Psycho, The Man With The Golden Arm, Advise and Consent, Spartacus, West Side Story, Vertigo, North By Northwest, Anatomy Of A Murder, Ocean&apos;s 11</em> and <em>Around The World In 80 Days.</em> </p>

<p>Bass, who was born in the Bronx, was known for his crisp graphic style and his title sequences helped propel themes of movies. For instance, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130609234726/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tek8QmKRODw">opening for Psycho shows spliced bars</a>, echoing not only the murderous actions but also the numerous cuts in the famous montage scene. His design for The Man With The Golden Arm&#x2014;which is about heroin addiction&#x2014;features a <em>foreboding</em> arm.</p>

<p>In his later years, Bass collaborated a lot with Martin Scorsese, for <em>Casino, Goodfellas</em> and <em>The Age of Innocence</em>&#x2014;here is <em>The Age of Innocence</em> opening:</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130609234726/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saul_Bass">Steven Spielberg said</a>, &quot;Saul Bass wasn&#x2019;t just an artist who contributed to the first several minutes of some of the greatest movies in history; in my opinion his body of work qualifies him as one of the best film makers of this, or any other time.&quot; <br>
