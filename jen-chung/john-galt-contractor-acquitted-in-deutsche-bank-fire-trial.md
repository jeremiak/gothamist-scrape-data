<p>The third defendant for the Deutsche Bank fire trial was found <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203125425/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/07/nyregion/final-defendant-is-acquitted-in-deutsche-bank-fire-trial.html?ref=nyregion">not guilty of manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide</a> today.  Michael Alvo was the third and final defendant to be acquitted of charges related to the tragedy that took the lives of two firefighters trying to put out the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203125425/http://gothamist.com/2007/08/19/two_firefighter.php">2008 seven-alarm fire</a>.  </p>

<p>The Deutsche Bank building was being dismantled (it was damaged from the 9/11 attacks) when one of the construction workers&apos; lit cigarette ignited a blaze.  Firefighters were unable to put out the fire because a huge chunk of the standpipe had been removed.  Alvo, the abatement director, was charged in 2008 and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203125425/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2011/07/06/2011-07-06_no_ones_guilty_in_deustche_bank_blaze_business_supervisor_acquitted_in_deaths_of.html#ixzz1RLhar56w">was relieved by the verdict</a>, &quot;It&apos;s been a rough time. I just want to get on with my life and make a living again.&quot;</p>

<p>Justice Rena Uviller delivered the good news to Alvo, but she still found Alvo&apos;s employer, the questionable construction contractor, John Galt Corp, guilty of reckless endangerment, which would mean a $5,000 fine.  </p>

<p>Last week, another Galt employee, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203125425/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/29/supervisor_acquitted_in_deutsche_ba.php"> Salvatore DePaola</a>, and one from Bovis Lend Lease,  Jeffrey Melofchik, were acquitted of charges.</p>
