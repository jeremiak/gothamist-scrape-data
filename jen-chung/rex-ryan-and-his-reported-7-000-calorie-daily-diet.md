Yesterday, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150106050650/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/ryan_worth_his_weight_in_gold_Fy1W4Ect6LCWRfP7Rl5q2I">Post reported</a> that the inspirational, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150106050650/http://gothamist.com/2009/11/18/should_coaches_cry.php">sometimes emotional</a> rookie coach eats <em>7,000 calories a day</em> to keep his 350-pound figure: &quot;The coach celebrated Sunday&apos;s triumph over the San Diego Chargers by scarfing down a cheesesteak and a beer on the charter flight back home. He was then offered a choice of barbecue chicken, flank steak or a Cobb salad.&quot; Of course&#x2014;a barbecue chaser is required after unlikely victories!<p></p>

<p>A nutritionist put into <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150106050650/http://wcbstv.com/sports/jets.rex.ryan.2.1436640.html">perspective for WCBS 2</a>: &quot;Imagine eating a healthy balanced diet for five days and then pushing it all into one day. That&apos;s about 7,000 calories... That&apos;s on average about 5,000 extra calories a day, which equals an extra 10 pounds a week. Meaning the average person could gain 10 pounds a week from consuming that many calories.&quot;  Other calorie equivalents:  33 McDonald&apos;s hamburgers, 26 Starbucks caramel frappucchinos, 34 Hershey milk chocolate bars. Pass the Alka-Seltzer, please.</p>

<p>Apparently Ryan, who is 6&apos;4&quot;, wanted to lose some weight this season, but the Garden State prevented that: &quot;During training camp last July, Ryan said that moving to Jersey had led him to pack on a few dozen extra pounds, noting, &apos;<strong>There are so many Italian restaurants</strong>.&apos;&quot;  And while some might question Ryan&apos;s diet, one fan told WCBS 2, &quot;<strong>Wow! That&apos;s a little too much. But he seems to be doing his job. It works</strong>.&quot; </p>
