Due to customer demand, the last car of the four AM peak trains and the first car of the six PM peak trains are designated quiet cars.  LIRR President Helena Williams said, &quot;As more and more electronic devices enter our lives - smart phones, cell phones, DVD and music players, tablets - many of our customers have asked for some relief from the noise they can create during their commute to and from work and other activities. This pilot is meant to respond to customers who seek quiet during their travels on the LIRR and is part of our overall effort to improve customer service.&quot;</p>

<p>Per the MTA, &quot;The four morning rush hour trains are the 5:22 AM, 6:28 AM, 7:18 AM and 8:54 AM departures from Far Rockaway to Atlantic Terminal. The six evening rush hour trains are the 4:31 PM, 5:11 PM, 5:49 PM, 6:27 PM, 6:59 PM and the 7:56 PM departures from Atlantic Terminal to Far Rockaway. The program is voluntary in nature with customers self-monitoring.  Conductors in these designated cars will hand out special &apos;Shh&apos; cards to customers who are non-compliant.&quot;  We guess these folks won&apos;t be sitting in the quiet cars:</p>
