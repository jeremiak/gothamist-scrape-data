</div></div>					<p>A driver jumped a curb and slammed the car into pedestrians and a Forever 21 store near Herald Square. One person was pinned against the building; a total of six people were injured, according to the FDNY.</p>

<p>The crash occurred just before 10 p.m. on West 34th Street near 6th Avenue. Angel Aguilar, who walked into the store just 10 seconds before the crash, told us, &quot;The woman that was pinned was saved by the glass window. She flew through it. The glass saved her life.&quot; He added, &quot;One man was laying on the far side and he couldn&apos;t move.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510011138/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2014/12/10/several-people-injured-when-car-hits-forever-21-store-in-herald-square/">WCBS 2 says</a> the car, a Ford Mustang, hit many other vehicles:</p><blockquote>One witness told CBS2&#x2019;s Aiello that one of the injured victims was pinned between the car and the window of the store. The witness said a woman at the wheel suddenly started driving crazily, and the sight created havoc.<p></p>

<p>&#x201C;She must have freaked out. She backed up, took off, went around on the other side of the street, went through the intersection, skidded out, fishtailed, then fishtailed again the other way and smacked into all the cars waiting at the light on that side of the street,&#x201D; said witness Matty Thomas. &#x201C;Cut across, she jumped the curb, and literally five bodies flying in the air.&#x201D;</p></blockquote>The FDNY characterized the victims as having serious but not life-threatening injuries; they were taken to Bellevue and other ares hospitals. <p></p>

<p>The NYPD is currently investigating the crash. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510011138/http://nypost.com/2014/12/10/alleged-drunk-driver-plows-over-pedestrians-in-midtown/">Post, which says the driver is male, reports</a>, that the driver &quot;was taken into custody under suspicion of drunk driving.&quot;</p>

<p><b>Update</b>: The driver was charged with DUI and leaving the scene of an accident, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510011138/http://nypost.com/2014/12/10/alleged-drunk-driver-plows-over-pedestrians-in-midtown/">per the Post</a>. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510011138/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/suspected-drunken-driver-injures-5-34th-st-crash-article-1.2041371">Daily News has this depiction of the chaos</a>:</p><blockquote>As the man driving the SUV stepped out to check the damage, the woman threw her car into reverse, apparently trying to pull a U-turn. She then abandoned the maneuver and continued to head east, slamming the SUV a second time and then shooting down E. 34 St. in the wrong lane, police and witnesses said.<p></p>

<p>The woman then stepped on the gas and clipped a car as she crossed Sixth Ave., before smashing into a Chevy Impala head on and sending it rolling backward into a yellow cab, police and witnesses said.</p>

<p>She was totally out of control ... I thought we all were going to die.</p>

<p>&#x201C;The car came at me like out of a movie. She was skidding like a snake across 34th St.,&#x201D; said the driver of the yellow cab, Kuljit Singh, 44. &#x201C;She was totally out of control ... I thought we all were going to die.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Then the convertible jumped the sidewalk, plowing into the pedestrians and smashing through a plate-glass window at the bloody end of the demolition derby.</p>

<p>Witnesses said the pedestrian who took the brunt of the impact appeared to be badly injured.</p></blockquote><p></p>
