</p><ul><li>Regarding how sports teams like the Yankees, Mets, and Nets get hundreds of millions in tax-free financing from the state and city governments, Assemblyman Richard Brodsky <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611053532/http://www.nysun.com/new-york/soviet-style-tactics-said-to-be-used-to-help-yanks/79966/">said</a>, &quot;These decisions are being made in secret in these Soviet-style meetings and it is outrageous.&quot;  <br>
</li><li>Bettina Damiani, a project director for Good Jobs New York, asked the Sun, &quot;Doesn&apos;t the mayor have better things to do than be asking Washington for money to help the Yankees?&quot; <br>
</li><li>Assemblyman Hakeem Jeffries, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611053532/http://ny.metro.us/metro/local/article/Yankees_hit_a_nerve_with_400M_request/12632.html">per Metro</a>, said, &quot;These sports teams are private companies that appear addicted to keeping their hands in the government cookie jar.&quot;<br>
</li><li>Another from Brodsky: &quot;What&apos;s at stake here is a much bigger issue than whether you like or dislike the Yankee Stadium deal. Stadiums soaking a lot of the tax-exempt financing, and we can&apos;t fund the capital plan of the MTA and we&apos;re short capital money on schools and hospitals.&quot;</li></ul>The NY Times looks at how NYC&apos;s two baseball teams and the Nets <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611053532/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/13/nyregion/13stadium.html?ref=nyregion">have benefited from tax-free bonds</a> and how the state and city are lobbying DC to make sure those projects do get benefits--for instance, the Yankees have received $900+ million in tax-free bonds, $200 million in subsidies, and new parking garages, parkland and more built by the city for $300+ million.  <p></p>

<p>And the Village Voice&apos;s Neil deMause has a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611053532/http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/archives/2008/06/yankees_to_city.php">good explanation of the tax-free bond situation and what it means</a> to the teams, the city &amp; state, and IRS.  deMause did co-write, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611053532/http://www.fieldofschemes.com/">Field of Schemes</a>: How the Great Stadium Swindle Turns Public Money into Private Profit. <br>
