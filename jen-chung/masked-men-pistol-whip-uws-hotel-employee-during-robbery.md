<p>A hotel manager was injured when three males &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160803051542/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/17/nyregion/upper-west-side-hotel-robbery.html?_r=0">stormed</a>&quot; into a Manhattan hotel this morning. </p>

<p>NYPD investigators cordoned off the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160803051542/https://www.choicehotels.com/new-york/new-york/rodeway-inn-hotels/ny209">Rodeway Inn</a> on West 71st Street, near Central Park West, this morning as cops searched for the perpetrators. Apparently the hotel manager was pistol whipped, while at least one other person was injured during the 8 a.m. incident.</p>

<p>The suspect fled with an unknown amount of cash. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160803051542/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/masked-robbers-pistol-whip-hotel-manager-armed-robbery-article-1.2566400">According to the Daily News</a>, &quot;The crooks burst into the lobby of the Rodeway Inn on W. 71st St. just past 8:05 a.m. and smacked the hotel manager in the head with a pistol, demanding cash from a safe, cops said. When the manager opened the safe, the robbers, wearing blue jeans and ski masks, grabbed its contents and fled.&quot;</p>

<p>Hotel guests and workers were not allowed inside the hotel as officers, firefighters and other first responders flooded the scene. &quot;This is going to take a while,&quot; a police officer stationed at the entrance told one woman who had gone out for coffee and was trying to get back to her room.</p>
