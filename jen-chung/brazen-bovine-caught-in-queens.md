<p><img alt="2008_09_cowloose.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20111117122119im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2008_09_cowloose.jpg" width="130" height="110" class="right">Last night, a reader told us, &quot;A friend who was on 111st &amp; Jamaica Ave... saw a bull running on the streets chased by NYPD.&quot;  Well, it was actually a cow (Newsmap called it a &quot;baby cow&quot;), and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111117122119/http://www.nypost.com/seven/09182008/news/regionalnews/cops_catch_cow_on_lam_129637.htm">Post reports</a>, &quot;<strong>The brazen bovine first showed herself on Atlantic Avenue in Woodhaven, Queens, being chased by an urban cowboy - who disappeared along with the animal before cops arrived</strong>&quot; around 9 a.m.  </p>

<p>Then, at 10 p.m., the cow reappeared at Hillside and 121st Street.  Cops followed the cow on foot for nine blocks, before corralling her at 107th and Park Lane.  Per <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111117122119/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local&amp;id=6398657">WABC 7</a>, &quot;One officer was kicked and sustained a minor injury in the udder madness.&quot;  Animal Care &amp; Control took the animal.</p>

<p><b>Update</b>: The Post now reports the <strike>cow</strike> bull <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111117122119/http://www.nypost.com/seven/09182008/news/regionalnews/cow_dies_after_queens_dash_129700.htm">died 45 minutes after being captured</a>.  Animal Care &amp; Control&apos;s Richard Gentiles said, &quot;There were no visible signs of injury or trauma so it&apos;s difficult to determine the cause of death... It was being monitored all the time, but it died 45 minutes after it arrived at our facility.&quot;  He added that the bull would have had a future of grazing ahead, &quot;Farm animals that come into our facility are taken to farm sanctuaries.&quot;</p>

<p>And here&apos;s video of the chase:</p>

<p>Last year a cow was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111117122119/http://gothamist.com/2007/09/19/udder_madness_i.php">also spotted in Queens</a>, prompting the Daily News to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111117122119/http://gothamist.com/2007/09/21/map_of_the_day_122.php">create a cow-spotting map</a>.</p>
