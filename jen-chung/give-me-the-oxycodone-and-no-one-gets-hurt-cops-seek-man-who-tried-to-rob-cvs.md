<p>A man apparently desperate for Oxycodone tried to rob a Queens pharmacy on Thursday, and now police are hoping that the public can help identify him.</p>

<p>The incident occurred around 7:20 p.m. on March 16 at the CVS Pharmacy at 72-09 Northern Boulevard. According to the authorities, the suspect walked into the store, walked to the service counter and gave a note to an employee that read &quot;Give me the Oxycodone and no gets hurt.&quot;</p>

<p>However, police say that the store employee refused the demand, so the suspect then picked up the note and fled without taking anything.<br>
 <br>
Surveillance video and images of the suspect were released. He is described as being about 30 years old and 5&apos;11&quot; and was last seen wearing a black hooded sweatshirt, black sweatpants, a black skull cap and grey sneakers.<br>
