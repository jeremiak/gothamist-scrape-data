<p>A woman waiting for a subway in Manhattan who was groped and then pushed into the subway tracks Friday morning is speaking out after the attack. Bonnie Currie spoke to WCBS 2 from her hospital bed, &quot;He pushed me as hard as he could push me onto the subway tracks,&quot; she told the station.</p>

<p>The incident occurred around 4:20 a.m. at the 14th Street F/M train station. Currie said, &quot;I screamed for help, and luckily, there were two people that were there in that hour - in that early hour - which was so lucky, and they pulled me off of the tracks.&quot;</p>

<p>The 22-year-old had just walked down to the platform. &quot;This guy, he came up behind me and he grabbed one of my boobs with one hand, and he grabbed my vagina. I told him to f--k off, and he pushed me onto the train tracks,&quot; Currie said<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170420181957/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/man-gropes-shoves-22-year-old-woman-nyc-subway-tracks-article-1.3055363">in an interview with the Daily News</a>.</p>

<p>After the Good Samaritans helped pull Currie up, she was taken to a hospital for her injuries; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170420181957/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2017/04/14/greenwich-village-subway-attack/">she &quot;said she broke her left wrist</a>, tore a ligament in her left shoulder and suffered deep bruising to her left femur.&quot; </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170420181957/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2017/04/14/greenwich-village-subway-attack/">Currie is thankful for the two people</a> who saved her&#x2014;&quot;I put my arms up, and one man took one arm, and the other took the other, and they pulled me up out of the track&quot;&#x2014;and said that she&apos;s been replaying the incident in her mind. &quot;Like, is there anything that I could have done differently, which I just don&#x2019;t think that there is. It could have been anyone.&quot;</p>
