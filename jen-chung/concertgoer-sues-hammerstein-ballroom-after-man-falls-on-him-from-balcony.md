<p>A man who attended a concert at Hammerstein Ballroom&#x2014;because his friend&apos;s girlfriend couldn&apos;t use a ticket&#x2014;is now suing the venue because he was injured. And it wasn&apos;t a slip-and-fall or anything like that: Yosef Allen says that another attendee toppled from the second floor balcony and landed on top of him, leaving him &quot;horribly injured.&quot;</p>

<p>The incident occurred during a performance of the French electronic music group Justice last October. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502140032/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/concert-fan-hit-falling-spectator-sues-article-1.1471967">According to the Daily News</a>, &quot;The unidentified fan was apparently fine - witnesses said he was smiling and flashing metal fingers after the fall&quot; while Allen suffered injuries to his &quot;back, neck, and head.&quot; His lawyer Glenn Faegenburg said his client <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502140032/http://nypost.com/2013/09/30/man-sues-hammerstein-ballroom-after-patron-landed-on-him-in-2-story-fall/">&quot;absorbed the impact&quot; </a>and that Allens&apos; spine was fractured in numerous places and he needed two surgeries for his knee. </p>

<p>Allen missed six months of work at B+H Photo, and Faegenburg said, &quot;In total, he missed almost six months of work&#x2014;and his mind doesn&apos;t feel as sharp as it used to. The speed with which he can call up words has been affected.&quot; The lawsuit criticizes Hammerstein Ballroom for letting the concertgoer who fell go, and permitting concertgoers in general be &quot;unruly&quot; and consume &quot;excessive amounts of alcohol&quot; as well as &quot;failing to furnish proper guardrails on the upper levels and balconies.&quot; Here&apos;s a view of that concert from the balcony&#x2014;it&apos;s apparently a 30 foot drop:</p>

<p>Allen is seeking unspecified damages.<br>
