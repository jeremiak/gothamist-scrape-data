</div></div>					<p>Last night and into early today, first responders engaged in a complicated mission to rescue a construction worker who was trapped in mud&#x2014;75 feet underground in a Second Avenue subway tunnel near East 95th Street. At one point, the mud was up to his chest. One firefighter <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429134528/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/20/nyregion/subway-worker-is-trapped-in-waist-deep-mud.html?ref=nyregion&amp;_r=0">called it a &quot;nightmare.&quot;</a></p>

<p>Around 8:30 p.m., the man, an on-site supervisor, got his foot stuck in a frame. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429134528/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local/new_york&amp;id=9033886">FDNY Chief Donald Hayde said</a>, &quot;The worker had fallen into a slurry, water and soil mixture, and it became exactly like quicksand. He also had approximately four pieces of plywood on top of him.&quot;</p>

<p>Early in the rescue, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429134528/http://pix11.com/2013/03/19/frantic-rescuers-used-their-hands-to-keep-worker-from-sinking-into-mud">PIX 11 reported</a>, &quot;In a desperate and ongoing attempt to save a construction worker who became trapped in mud and debris, first responders used their hands, buckets and small tools to keep the man from slipping deeper into the muck, according to the FDNY.  They were finally able to tie a rope around the worker&#x2019;s chest and anchor it so he couldn&#x2019;t slip under.&quot; However, though he was secure at 10 p.m., he couldn&apos;t be lifted up.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429134528/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/20/nyregion/subway-worker-is-trapped-in-waist-deep-mud.html?ref=nyregion&amp;_r=0">NY Times described the coordination</a>&#x2014;and drama:</p><blockquote>The effort was an ordeal: Consolidated Edison brought in a truck equipped with an industrial vacuum to assist. A firefighter on the scene said emergency workers were descending into a hole on the east side of Second Avenue using ropes, but were getting stuck in the soft mud of the tunnel floor. He said they were using plywood to try to shore up the walls, and that rescuers hoped to extract the worker using the basket. Many of the initial efforts to free the worker failed, officials said.<p></p>

<p>The Fire Department spokesman said that about 130 Fire Department emergency responders were working to free the man, and about 11 p.m. he said that the worker was conscious and talking, and that a doctor was with him. He was given drugs to keep him calm, officials said. Stephen Harding, a Fire Department chaplain, was also by the man&#x2019;s side throughout the ordeal.</p></blockquote>Finally, at 12:30 a.m., the man was pulled out and taken to WeillCornell for hypothermia.  Three firefighters also suffered injuries&#x2014;Hayde said, &quot;We had a member from Rescue 1 who was heavily involved in removal. He actually got pinned in the mud. He&apos;s presently at the hospital with an ankle injury. We had to get him out. It was just very difficult.&quot;<br>
