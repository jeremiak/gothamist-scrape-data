<p>Last month, <em>Saturday Night Live</em> announcer Don Pardo <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013626/http://gothamist.com/2014/08/19/don_pardo_rip_snl.php">passed away at age 96</a>, after being the show&apos;s voice for 39 years. Now, SNL creator Lorne Michaels has decided to bring back former performer and incredibly talented impressionist Darrell Hammond to be its second announcer.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013626/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/19/business/media/darrell-hammond-to-replace-don-pardo-as-the-announcer-for-saturday-night-live.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;_r=0">Michaels told the NY Times</a>, &quot;There were a lot of sweet ideas about carrying on with Don somehow. Because everyone has a Pardo impression. But he had the greatest run and he&#x2019;s a completely beloved figure. So I thought: Don&#x2019;t turn this into something else. That period ended.&quot; </p>

<p>Michaels emphasized that Hammond will not be mimicking Pardo. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013626/http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/tv/2014/09/18/darrell-hammond-don-pardo-saturday-night-live-announcer/15780171/">In an interview with USA Today</a>, Michaels described Hammdon as &quot;staggeringly versatile... I just knew it wouldn&apos;t be anybody who sounded like Don or replicated him. It can&apos;t be what it was, but it could sort of be in the same tradition. And it will be nice to have Darrell around. He understands the show and will probably be helpful in ways we haven&apos;t yet figured out.&quot;</p>

<p>Hammond actually subbed for Pardo on a few occasions. From the Times:</p><blockquote>Most memorably, in a show from 1999, when Mr. Pardo found at dress rehearsal that he was developing an incapacitating case of laryngitis, Mr. Hammond not only performed the introduction (&#x201C;Live from New York&#x2026;&#x201D;) but played Mr. Pardo (in voice only) in the opening monologue with host James Vanderbeek. (In a later interview, Mr. Pardo said he heard from his sister-in-law the next day, praising him for his comic repartee with the host.)</blockquote>Here&apos;s Hammond as Pardo making passes at Van Der Beek:<p></p>

<p>In other SNL news, Mike O&apos;Brien will no longer be a performer but he&apos;s remaining a writer. </p>
