The 30-year-old, described as a violent schizophrenic, was also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429201407/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/10/18/2010-10-18_schizophrenic_eric_bellucci_charged_with_seconddegree_murder_as_slain_parents_ar.html">put on suicide watch at the request</a> of his lawyer, who said, &quot;We&apos;re erring on the side of caution. It&apos;s an extremely tragic situation.&quot;  </p>

<p>His parents, Arthur and Marian Bellucci, were buried yesterday, and hundreds of mourners attended the funeral at Holy Child Church, where Rev. Alan Travers said, &quot;You were instantly shocked by life taken in this dastardly deed. What kind of comprehensible statement can be made in the face of such a stupefying fate?&quot;  Bellucci&apos;s brother Brian and sister Vanessa (she discovered their parents stabbed bodies in their home) were present, as were many relatives who spoke of the couple&apos;s love and kindness.  Marian Bellucci&apos;s brother said, &quot;They caught him before he could kill anyone else. Eric should never get out of jail.&quot;</p>

<p>Bellucci is being represented by John Q. Kelly, who, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150429201407/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/staten_island/killer_son_shun_R1a74U1IjcFjWi69YebO4M?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=#ixzz12qCq6mpv">the Post reports</a>, &quot;represented the mother of Aruba murder victim Natalee Holloway and the sister of O.J. Simpson&apos;s slain ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson. He said he had been retained to represent Bellucci, but would not say who hired him.&quot; </p>
