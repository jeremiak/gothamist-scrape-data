Uptown A &amp; D resume local service only. Expect delays. #ServAdv,&quot; and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427164803/http://twitter.com/NYCTSubwayScoop/status/21615377720">then</a>, &quot;Earlier incident @ 116th St which affected uptown A, B, C &amp; D appears from accounts so far to have been a customer suicide.&quot;</p>
