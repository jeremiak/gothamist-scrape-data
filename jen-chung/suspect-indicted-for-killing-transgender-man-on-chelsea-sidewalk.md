<p>The Manhattan District Attorney announced that a suspect had been indicted in the death of a transgender man who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170520185256/https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20170505/midtown/transgender-woman-dies-head-injury-nypd-seventh-avenue">was found on a Manhattan sidewalk</a> last month. </p>

<p>D.A. Cy Vance said that Kenneth Bostick, 59, was struck &quot;with such force that it left a skull injury that caused the victim&#x2019;s senseless and tragic death 12 days later.&quot; </p>

<p>Authorities say that Joseph Griffin, 26, approached Bostick around 10 p.m. on April 25 on Seventh Avenue between 27th and 28th Streets and allegedly struck him with a &quot;long, metal object.&quot; Then, 90 minutes after fleeing the scene, Griffin allegedly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170520185256/https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20170509/chelsea/brenda-bostick-transgender-attack-homicide-seventh-avenue-nypd">ran into traffic</a> and climbed onto a taxi cab that had stopped and proceeded to smash the windshield. </p>

<p>Bostick was discovered unconscious outside 343 Seventh Avenue near West 29th Street in Chelsea on April 25 and was taken to a hospital, where he was pronounced braindead on May 4.  </p>

<p>Police initially identified Bostick as a female victim named Brenda Bostick, but the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170520185256/http://www.villagevoice.com/2017/05/11/still-no-arrest-in-killing-of-kenneth-bostick-transgender-man-widely-misgendered-in-initial-reports/">Village Voice spoke to a social services provider</a> who said Bostick identified as male. The provider said, &quot;For the people who knew him and worked with him, the media&#x2019;s constant reference to him as &#x2018;she&#x2019; is extraordinarily painful and difficult.&quot; </p>

<p>Griffin was charged with first-degree manslaughter for Bostick&apos;s death as well as third-degree criminal mischief for the taxi cab incident. Vance said, &quot;My Office is committed to ensuring that justice is served in Bostick&#x2019;s memory.&quot; </p>
