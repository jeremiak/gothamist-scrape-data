<p>Stamford resident and Hofstra graduate Joseph &quot;Joey&quot; Comunale, 26, was last seen on Saturday night at 418 East 59th Street; his father reported him missing on Tuesday morning. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016020622/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/manhattan/grim-signs-point-foul-play-man-vanished-nyc-party-article-1.2874483">Police sources told the Daily News</a> that Comunale was seen at the Grand Sutton tower apartment building on Saturday night, accompanied by three women and two men from New Jersey. The group was reportedly attending a party hosted by the son of &quot;a well-known jeweler&quot; who resides in the building. </p>

<p>Around 6:30 p.m. on Sunday, long after the women were reportedly seen leaving, the host allegedly requested a luggage cart from the front desk. According to the News, video surveillance showed a man &quot;wheeling out two pieces of luggage.&quot;</p>

<p>The resident, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016020622/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2016/11/15/stamford-man-missing/">WCBS 2 reports,</a> &quot;asked a doorman how long surveillance videos are kept on file.&quot;</p>

<p>The police brought in search dogs last night, and a garbage bag with bloody clothing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016020622/http://nypost.com/2016/11/16/police-suspect-foul-play-after-26-year-old-goes-missing-in-midtown/">were found near the building</a>. The luggage cart <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016020622/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Investigators-Find-Bloody-Clothes-Sheets-After-Hofstra-Grad-Disappears-at-NYC-Luxury-Apartment-Building-401435426.html">may also have blood on it</a>.</p>

<p>The building resident is being questioned by police now.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016020622/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2016/11/15/stamford-man-missing/">A neighbor said</a>, &quot;It&#x2019;s a very, very normal building and very, very nice people in general that live there, so I&#x2019;ve never heard of any issues of this kind.&quot;</p>
