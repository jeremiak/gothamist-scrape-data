<p>A female subway rider became the unwitting focus of a creepy perv who is now wanted for public lewdness.<br>
 <br>
According to the NYPD, the incident occurred at 3:30 a.m. on Thursday, March 24th, while inside a southbound J train at the Myrtle-Broadway subway station: The man allegedly &quot;blew kisses to the 27-year-old female victim then placed his hand down his pants and touched his genitalia while staring at her.&quot;</p>

<p>The woman took photographs and shared them with the authorities, and it&apos;s pretty clear it was a terrible subway ride:</p>
