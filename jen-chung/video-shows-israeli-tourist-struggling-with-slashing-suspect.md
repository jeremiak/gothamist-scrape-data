<p>The police are searching for the suspect who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161002181310/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/08/hasidic_man_stabbed_bleecker.php">slashed an Israeli tourist</a> at a downtown Manhattan subway station.</p>

<p>The attack occurred early yesterday morning. The victim, a 55-year-old man <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161002181310/http://jpupdates.com/2016/04/08/nypd-hasidic-man-stabbed-multiple-times-at-manhattan-train-station/">from Jerusalem</a> who does not speak English, had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161002181310/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/NYC-4-6-Trains-Skip-Bleecker-Street-Subway-Station-Man-Slashed-375004761.html">reportedly met</a> with a diamond salesperson in the Diamond District in midtown when he got lost and ended up sitting on a bench at the Bleecker Street 6 station. He fell asleep and was allegedly awoken around 3:30 a.m. by a man who was trying to rob him. </p>

<p>An NYPD spokesperson said the victim was wearing traditional Hasidic clothing, and the suspect was &quot;using a sharp object to cut open his pockets.&quot; The victim resisted, and was slashed in the face and hands during the struggle.</p>

<p>The suspect fled, but police released this surveillance video from the station: <br>

<p>The victim managed to emerge from the station, and NBC New York reports some good Samaritans helped him; one said, &quot;We just saw him coming up the subway steps and he was bleeding really heavily. We helped him out. We put pressure on his wrists.&quot; The victim was taken to Bellevue Hospital and is in stable condition.</p>
