<p>Firefighters and other emergency responders were called to a West Side hospital earlier this morning after a man, who apparently jumped to his death, landed on the oxygen line to the emergency room.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160504080851/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/manhattan/person-dies-falling-oxygen-tank-midtown-article-1.2489821">The Daily News reports</a>, &quot;The man fell from an adjacent building and landed on the tank at Mount Sinai St. Luke&apos;s Roosevelt Hospital on 10th Ave. around 1:51 a.m., according to police. Upon falling, the tank&apos;s line was ruptured, stopping a flow of oxygen to the hospital and causing an evacuation of the emergency room to the lobby. The emergency room was temporarily shut down.&quot;</p>

<p>The leak was contained and contractors are working on fixing the situation. Officials <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160504080851/http://nypost.com/2016/01/08/jumper-lands-on-nyc-hospitals-oxygen-tank-severing-supply/">assure the NY Post</a> no patients were injured as a result of the incident, and &quot;portable oxygen tanks are being used until a private contractor can repair the damages.&quot;</p>
