WABC 7 says the delays are &quot;at airports east of the Mississippi River.&quot; The problem is at a &quot;National Airspace Data Interchange Network facility south of Atlanta,&quot; so the processing for all flights is at a facility in Salt Lake City. But don&apos;t worry--the FAA hasn&apos;t lost contact with planes and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611050254/http://www.usatoday.com/travel/flights/2008-08-26-faa-flight-delays_N.htm?loc=interstitialskip">can still speak to pilots</a>.  So far, delays at LaGuardia are over an hour, 41 minutes at JFk and 15 minutes at Newark.</p>
