</div></div>					<p>Earlier this morning, two police officers fired at a man who allegedly pointed a gun at them in East Harlem.</p>

<p>According to the NYPD, at 2:01 a.m., two uniformed police officers in a marked cruiser responded to a 911 call about a disorderly group at 215 East 102nd Street at the Washington Houses. When they arrived, the police saw the group and started to question a man. The man fled and police saw that he had a firearm.</p>

<p>The police say the officers chased the armed man: &quot;[D]uring the foot pursuit the suspect turned and pointed his firearm at the officers. Both officers discharged their service firearms at the suspect.&quot; The suspect was transported to NY Cornell Hospital with multiple gunshot wounds and is in critical but stable condition. His .22 caliber RG revolved was found at the scene. </p>

<p>Both officers were treated for tinnitus at St. Luke&apos;s Hospital. Police say the investigation is continuing and charges are pending. </p>
