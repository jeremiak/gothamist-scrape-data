<p>Police are searching for a man who stole a jacket from a Brooklyn thrift store and tussled with a guard as he fled the establishment.</p>

<p>The incident occurred last Thursday, September 29th, around 6:05 p.m. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016021759/http://gothamist.com/2016/05/19/the_best_thrift_stores_in_nyc.php">at Urban Jungle</a>, a thrift store at 120 Knickebocker Avenue in Bushwick. According to the NYPD, the shoplifter took a &quot;burgundy Carhartt jacket&quot; from a shelf and apparently stuffed it up the back of his shirt. When he tried to walk out with it, a security guard confronted him. But the jacket thief &quot;forced his way past the guard&quot; and fled. He was last seen speeding off in a black sedan headed northbound on Knickerbocker Avenue.</p>

<p>The guard sustained minor injuries but refused medical treatment. </p>

<p>Police released video of the suspect, who is described as being in his 30s, about 5&apos;5&quot; and 200 pounds and last seen wearing a white shirt and dark pants.</p>
