</p><blockquote>1: On Tuesday, August 8, 2015 at approximately 1315 hours, a suspect approached the 13 year-old victim as he was walking and offered him money if he could help him carry his bags. The victim agreed to help him and as they entered the walkway of Seton Falls Park in the vicinity of Baychester Avenue and Crawford Avenue, he grabbed the 13 year-old male victim&apos;s buttocks.<p></p>

<p>2: On Thursday, September 17, 2015 at approximately 0645 hours, a suspect approached the 15 year-old male victim while he was walking and offered him money to help him carry his bags. The victim agreed, at which point the suspect led him to an isolated area inside Seton Falls Park where the suspect exposed himself, began to masturbate, and asked the victim to have sex with him. The suspect then proceeded to touch the victim&apos;s groin area over his clothing.</p>

<p>3: On Saturday, October 3, 2015 at approximately 1125 hours, the 12 year-old victim was walking inside Seton Falls Park when he was approached by a suspect who grabbed him by the arm. The suspect pulled the victim into a wooded area, where he observed the suspect grab his own waistband.</p></blockquote>Then, as the police investigated, they found out Boyden allegedly &quot;sent a photo of his genitals to the 13 year-old male victim&quot; and &quot;then called the victim and offered him money for sex.&quot; Boyden was charged with distributing indecent material to a minor, acting in a manner injurious to a child and aggravated harassment for this incident. <p></p>
