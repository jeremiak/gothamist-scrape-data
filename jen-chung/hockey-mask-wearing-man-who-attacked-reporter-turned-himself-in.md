<p>Last Friday night, WABC 7 reporter CeFaan Kim was taping a segment about a rape in the Lower East Side when a random man wearing a hockey mask suddenly interrupted and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170309173747/http://gothamist.com/2017/03/04/man_in_hockey_mask_attacks_reporter.php">was, eventually, seen shoving Kim</a>. The alleged attacker, Key&apos;Jonta Foster, told <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170309173747/http://nypost.com/2017/03/05/masked-man-who-pushed-reporter-says-he-wanted-publicity/">the NY Post</a> that he was trying to promote his rap album. Though he bragged on Twitter that he wouldn&apos;t turn himself in, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170309173747/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/manhattan/rapper-surrenders-police-scuffle-wabc-tv-reporter-article-1.2990396">he surrendered to police yesterday</a>.</p>

<p>Video from the incident doesn&apos;t show the entire exchange between Kim and Foster, because the camera pans upward. When the camera moves back onto the men, you see them struggling with each other:</p>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">This is the man who attacked me last night during a live broadcast. If anyone has seen him around please give the 7th precinct a call. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170309173747/https://t.co/enkqQe0mxC">pic.twitter.com/enkqQe0mxC</a></p>&#x2014; CeFaan Kim (@CeFaanKim) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170309173747/https://twitter.com/CeFaanKim/status/838102907962736641">March 4, 2017</a></blockquote>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170309173747/http://nypost.com/2017/03/05/masked-man-who-pushed-reporter-says-he-wanted-publicity/">Foster told the Post,</a> &quot;The reason I did it was because I knew I&#x2019;d get negative feedback from it. I can always flip that,&quot; adding, &quot;White guys bomb video reporters all the time. A black man tries to get air time and then gets beat up by the reporter. I&#x2019;m gonna do what I gotta do and seize an opportunity.&quot;</p>

<p>In <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170309173747/https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20170306/lower-east-side/majesty-da-rebel-wanted-for-shoving-reporter-on-live-tv">an interview with DNAinfo</a> yesterday, Foster insisted, &quot;When the camera was looking up was when he grabbed me... I just shifted everything and pushed him off of me. I was like &apos;You&apos;re doing too much.&apos; I think he overreacted.&quot; He also &quot;believes Kim was intimidated by the Jason mask he was wearing.&quot;</p>

<p>He faces a misdemeanor assault charge, according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170309173747/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/manhattan/rapper-surrenders-police-scuffle-wabc-tv-reporter-article-1.2990396">the Daily News</a>. Kim thanked the police and tipsters:</p>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Thank you <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170309173747/https://twitter.com/NYPDnews">@NYPDnews</a> for professionalism beginning to end, responding officers to top brass. And to countless who provided flood of tips.</p>&#x2014; CeFaan Kim (@CeFaanKim) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170309173747/https://twitter.com/CeFaanKim/status/838981152329383937">March 7, 2017</a></blockquote>
