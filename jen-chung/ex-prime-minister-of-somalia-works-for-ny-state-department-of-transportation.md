Mohamed Adullahi Mohamed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120605081136/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/07/nyregion/after-serving-as-somalias-prime-minister-back-to-work-in-buffalo.html?_r=1&amp;ref=nyregion">spoke with the NY Times</a> about being back in his war-torn homeland, &quot;Every morning when I was brushing my teeth I heard bullets hitting the metal over my window. It was like, pop pop pop pop. The first day I was shocked. But after that I knew the bullets would not get through, so I continued brushing.&quot;<p></p>

<p>Mohamed, who had been making sure NYS DOT contracts comply with non-discrimination policies, became Somalia&apos;s prime minister <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120605081136/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/15/world/africa/15somalia.html">in November 2010</a>, resigning <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120605081136/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13830470">this past June</a>, with BBC News reporting that he initially refused to step down but later agreed &quot;in the interest of the Somali people.&quot; (BBC News also added, &quot;Somalia has been without an effective central government since the fall of the Siad Bare regime in 1991, as rival factions constantly fight for power.&quot;)  But, according to the Times, this is how he ascended to the position:</p><blockquote>On Oct. 14, 2010, after a meeting with Somalia&#x2019;s president in Mogadishu, Mr. Mohamed was appointed prime minister, and by November he was on the job, governing a country ravaged by terrorism and on the brink of dire famine.<p></p>

<p>&#x201C;I called my wife every other night so she would know I&#x2019;m still here,&#x201D; he said. His interior minister was killed by a suicide bomb carried by the minister&#x2019;s niece.</p>

<p>&#x201C;It was a risk,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;But if you want to do good things, a position like that comes with a level of personal risk.&#x201D; His salary was the same as what he earns at the Transportation Department, from which he took a one-year leave of absence.</p></blockquote>Mohamed, 49, had worked for the Somali ministry in D.C. in the 1980s, but when he criticized the Somali government, he applied for asylum in the U.S.  <p></p>

<p>A foreign police expert told the Times, &quot;[Mohamed] came in talking tough on corruption&quot;&#x2014;a big issue in Somalia&#x2014;&quot;&quot;And there was quite a lot of public demonstration of support for him. But there&#x2019;s little evidence of any improvement made. The ultimate verdict is that his heart was in the right place; he went in and was immediately fed to the sharks.&quot; Another said, &quot;If the argument is that he fought corruption, it&#x2019;s either a smoke screen or he&#x2019;s absurdly incompetent. Corruption grew during his tenure as prime minister.&quot; Well, NY State is awesome with corruption.</p>

<p>His coworkers are happy he&apos;s back&#x2014;one said, &quot;We weren&#x2019;t sure he&#x2019;d return to D.O.T., because once you do something grand like that, to come back to this humble work is something else.&quot; </p>
