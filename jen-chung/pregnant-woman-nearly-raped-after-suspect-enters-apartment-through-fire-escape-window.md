<p>Police are searching for a man who tried to rape a pregnant woman in her Bronx apartment earlier this month. Police say he entered the home through the kitchen window after climbing onto the fire escape.</p>

<p>The incident occurred before 1:30 a.m. on November 6th, near Taylor Avenue. Authorities say a 20-year-old woman was in her apartment &quot;when the individual used a fire escape and entered the apartment through a kitchen window. The individual demanded the victim to touch his penis and the victim complied.&quot; Police say the man proceeded to masturbate, and subsequently fled back the way he came.  </p>

<p>The woman, who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161125092340/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/bronx/suspect-attempted-rape-asked-pregnant-bronx-woman-sex-article-1.2884276">reportedly just moved</a> into the apartment, went to Jacobi Hospital for an evaluation. </p>

<p>Apparently the suspect had &quot;a black scarf around his face, shined a flashlight at her, and asked if they could have sex,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161125092340/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/bronx/suspect-attempted-rape-asked-pregnant-bronx-woman-sex-article-1.2884276">according to the Daily News</a>:</p><blockquote>She told him no, and said she was pregnant, and when he told her to perform a sex act on him, she cried out, &#x201C;No, the baby, the baby! Don&#x2019;t hurt me!&#x201D; sources said.<p></p>

<p>He then told her to strip, which she did, and masturbated in front of her, then went to the bathroom and got some toilet paper to clean up, sources said.</p>

<p>The man then said he wanted her to be his girlfriend and asked for her number, sources said. Terrified, she complied, then told him to come back in a few days, hoping that would prevent him from hurting her, sources said.</p></blockquote>After he left, she went to a neighbor to call for help.<br>
 <br>
Police release video of the suspect, who is described as being 200 pounds and 5&apos;7&quot; and was  last seen wearing a light colored hat, dark colored pants, black and white shoes, and a light colored jacket. <p></p>
