But now she <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504170438/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/nj_woman_attempting_to_become_world_pco3O4qPWiCg3yjEWaxx9N">tells the Post</a> that it might be an impossible dream. Donna Simpson, 42, who is currently 604 pounds, says, &quot;When you have a 3-year-old daughter and you&#x2019;re trying to run a household, things like this tend to be a fantasy... This whole thousand-pound goal has gotten blown way out of proportion&quot;</p>

<p>In the Daily Mail interview, Simpson said, &quot;My favorite food is sushi, but unlike others I can sit and eat 70 big pieces of sushi in one go... I do love cakes and sweet things, doughnuts are my favorite,&quot; and revealed that she supported her $750/week food bill with money from her website &quot;where men pay her to watch her eat fast food.&quot; She explained, &quot;I love eating and people love watching me eat. It makes people happy, and I&apos;m not harming anyone.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504170438/http://www.myfoxny.com/dpp/news/dpgonc-donna-simpson-attempting-to-become-worlds-fattest-woman-fc-20100315">MyFoxNY visited Simpson</a> in her home last night: She says that one of her online fans sent her his credit card numbers to buy food!</p>
