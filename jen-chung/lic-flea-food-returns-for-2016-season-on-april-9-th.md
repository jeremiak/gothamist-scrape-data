<p>Outdoor flea season is about to get lit: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160904031442/http://licflea.com/">The LIC Flea &amp; Food market</a> just announced that it will be back, starting the weekend of April 9-10. And the All-Queens Beer Garden is returning as well.</p>

<p>Over 80 antiques, vintage goods and food stalls will be participating. Organizers say that the vintage offerings will be &quot;significantly expanded from last year&quot; with vendors like RI-PURPOSE, Maggiebeth Vintage, and Halltown Homestead. And the food will continue to reflect Queens&apos; diversity: Oconomi&apos;s Japanese Vegetable Pancakes, Butcher Bar&apos;s Wood Smoked BBQ, Jessy&apos;s Empanadas and Noodle Code&apos;s Guilin-style noodles will be there.<br>
 <br>
&quot;Now in our fourth year, you can expect to find popular vendors from our past and unique new vendors you won&#x2019;t be able to find anywhere else,&quot; said Joshua Schneps of LIC Flea &amp; Food. &quot;With a wide range of unique products and specialty items, and incredible views of the Manhattan skyline, the vibrant experience offered by LIC Flea &amp; Food will be unlike anything else, providing a fun destination for the entire family&#x2014;New Yorkers and visitors alike.&quot;</p>

<p>The flea is located at the corner of 5th Street and 46th Avenue (walkable from 7, N, Q, E, M and G trains and LIC East River Ferry stop). The Brooklyn Flea is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160904031442/http://gothamist.com/2016/03/15/the_brooklyn_flea_is_coming_to_dumb.php">opening April 3 in DUMBO this year</a>.</p>
