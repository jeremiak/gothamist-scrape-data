<p>Another local resident <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016020703/http://www.fox5ny.com/news/197842328-story">complained about the LIE exit</a>, &quot;This area in general is very dangerous. A lot of people are speeding on and speeding off of the highway in this two-block area. There have been other fatalities. What is it going to take before some type of measures are taken?&quot;</p>
