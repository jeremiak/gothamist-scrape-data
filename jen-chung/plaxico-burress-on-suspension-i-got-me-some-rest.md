Newsday reports Burress, who was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611052348/http://gothamist.com/2008/09/24/giants_suspend_burress.php">punished for missing team meetings</a>, said, &quot;I didn&apos;t lose any sleep over it.  I got me some rest. I was able to get away for a little while, chill out and relax. Things like that happen.&quot;  He also added that his absence from the meetings was due to issues around taking his son to school, &quot;Maybe I would have put a phone call in, but as far as things like that, I&apos;m always going to put [things like his son] first. That&apos;s one thing people have to understand. I don&apos;t have any regrets over it.&quot;</p>
