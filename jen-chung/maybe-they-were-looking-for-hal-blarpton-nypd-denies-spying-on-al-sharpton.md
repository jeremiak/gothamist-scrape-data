<p>On Monday, NYPD chronicler Leonard Levitt (who is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120216055938/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/18/nyclu_and_nypd_confidential_blogger.php">feared by the NYPD brass</a>) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120216055938/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/len-levitt/nypd-al-sharpton_b_1273094.html">reported</a>, &quot;An NYPD informant spied on the Rev. Al Sharpton&apos;s National Action Network [NAN] as the group was organizing large-scale protests of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120216055938/http://gothamist.com/2008/04/25/sean_bell_shoot_7.php">Sean Bell case acquittals</a>, a police document shows. The confidential informant infiltrated a NAN meeting on May 3, 2008, and reported back to the NYPD&apos;s Intelligence Division, according to a document marked &apos;secret,&apos; which was obtained by NYPD Confidential. The informant had attended the NAN meeting a week after a Queens judge had acquitted three detectives of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120216055938/http://gothamist.com/2006/11/26/police_under_fi.php">fatal 50-shot killing of Bell and the wounding</a> of two of his friends in November, 2006.&quot;</p>

<p>The informant was dispatched to report on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120216055938/http://gothamist.com/2008/05/07/sean_bell_civil.php">Sharpton&apos;s planned civil disobedience pray-ins</a>, a protest against the acquittals.  Additionally, Levitt noted, &quot;The NYPD had continually spied on Sharpton in the 1980s after he came to prominence for championing the case of Tawana Brawley, a black girl who falsely claimed to have been raped by hooded white men. Two undercover police officers who spied on black protest groups in the 1980s told this reporter in 1998 that the department was so intent on discrediting Sharpton that they were tasked by their superiors to spread rumors that he was homosexual.&quot;</p>

<p>While <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120216055938/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/30/paul_browne_deathwatch_will_lying_n.php">NYPD &quot;spokesman&quot; Paul Browne</a> did not respond to Levitt&apos;s queries for comment, Browne did respond to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120216055938/http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/politics/2012/02/5268842/asked-about-reported-spying-incident-paul-browne-says-nypd-wasnt-af">one from Capital New York&apos;s Azi Paybarah</a>: &quot;I emailed Browne to ask about the alleged spying incident, asking whether the department had an officer or informant providing information to them about Sharpton&apos;s activities without his knowledge. Brown&apos;s responded: &apos;<strong>Neither the Rev. Sharpton nor the National Action Network, but a separate individual who was present was the subject of the NYPD Intelligence Division&#x2018;s interest at the May 3, 2008 meeting in question.</strong>&apos;&quot; Ohhhh&#x2014;a &quot;separate individual.&quot;... maybe his name was &quot;Hal Blarpton.&quot;  Russell Simmons <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120216055938/https://twitter.com/#!/UncleRUSH/status/169567065412337664">Tweeted his support of Sharpton</a>, &quot;Dear @TheRevAl Sharpton-- we got your back. #NYPDStopSpyingOnTheRev&quot;</p>
