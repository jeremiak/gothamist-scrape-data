<p>Attorney Generals from New York, Massachusetts and Kentucky are joining forces to protest a petition that&apos;s trying to make &quot;ringless robocalls&quot; exempt from consumer protections under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act. NY AG Eric Schneiderman said, &quot;New Yorkers are already the victims of countless unwanted phone solicitations. The federal government has a basic responsibility to protect American consumers. That certainly doesn&#x2019;t mean making it even easier for companies to spam them with costly, unsolicited, ringless robocalls.&quot;</p>

<p>The NY Times tackled the incredibly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170605203657/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/03/business/phone-ringless-voicemail-fcc-telemarketer.html">annoying phenomenon in a recent article</a>&#x2014;you know, when you suddenly notice there&apos;s a new voicemail on your cellphone but you didn&apos;t even hear/feel the phone ring even though you&apos;ve been holding it the entire time! The companies behind the surprise messages are claiming that since they aren&apos;t technically calls, they don&apos;t need to heed consumer marketing laws. From the Times:</p><blockquote>But consumer advocates, technology experts, people who have been inundated with these calls and the lawyers representing them say such an exemption would open the floodgates. Consumers&#x2019; voice mail boxes would be clogged with automated messages, they say, making it challenging to unearth important calls, whether they are from an elderly mother&#x2019;s nursing home or a child&#x2019;s school.<p></p>

<p>If unregulated, ringless voice mail messages &#x201C;will likely overwhelm consumers&#x2019; voice mail systems and consumers will have no way to limit, control or stop these messages,&#x201D; Margot Freeman Saunders, senior counsel at the National Consumer Law Center, wrote in the organization&#x2019;s comment letter to the Federal Communications Commission on behalf of more than a dozen consumer groups. &#x201C;Debt collectors could potentially hijack a consumer&#x2019;s voice mail with collection messages.&#x201D;</p></blockquote>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170605203657/https://www.fcc.gov/general/telemarketing-and-robocalls">Telephone Consumer Protection Act</a> (TCPA), the FCC says, &quot;restricts the making of telemarketing calls and the use of automatic telephone dialing systems and artificial or prerecorded voice message.&quot;<p></p>

<p>The FCC is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170605203657/https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/search/filings?q=(proceedings.name:((02-278*))%20OR%20proceedings.description:((02-278*)))&amp;sort=date_disseminated,DESC">accepting public comments</a> about changes to the TCPA, and the letter from the attorney generals (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170605203657/http://www.mass.gov/ago/docs/press/2017/reply-comments-concerning-ringless-voicemail.pdf">PDF</a>) notes that people aren&apos;t able to block the &quot;unwanted messages.&quot; Those who rely on prepaid cellphones or have limited minutes would incur expenses while checking the voicemails. </p>

<p>Among the supporters of the ringless voicemail: The Republican National Committee, which, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170605203657/http://www.cbsnews.com/news/ringless-marketing-calls-robocalls-voicemails-fcc/">CBS News reports</a>, &quot;said regulating the practice might affect political outreach campaigns.&quot; RNC chief counsel <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170605203657/http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/zorn/ct-ringless-voicemail-20170602-column.html">told the FCC</a>, &quot;Needlessly subjecting voicemails to (current restrictions) would sweep in, restrict and chill nonintrusive political messages delivered to voicemail servers &#x2014; including to individuals who expect and desire political communications. (Prohibiting them) would raise significant constitutional issues and must be rejected.&quot;</p>

<p>One Delaware resident <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170605203657/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/03/business/phone-ringless-voicemail-fcc-telemarketer.html">told the Times</a> how he was fed up with the messages: &quot;When I checked my voice mail, it made me really angry. It was literally a telemarketing voice mail to try to sell telemarketing systems.&quot;</p>
