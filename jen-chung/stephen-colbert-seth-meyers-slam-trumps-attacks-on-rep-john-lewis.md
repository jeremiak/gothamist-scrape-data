<p>Donald Trump&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170914134014/http://gothamist.com/2017/01/14/donald_trump_calls_civil_rights_ico.php">shocking and hypocritical attacks</a> on Congressman and civil rights icon John Lewis got the late night talk show treatment yesterday.  Stephen Colbert mocked Trump&apos;s Tweet calling Lewis &quot;all talk, talk talk - no action&quot; on <em>The Late Show</em> by saying, &quot;Yes, well said. John Lewis is all &#x2018;talk, talk, talk.&#x2019; Unlike a real leader like Trump who&#x2019;s all tweet, tweet, tweet.&quot;</p>

<p>Lewis, ahem, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170914134014/http://gothamist.com/2017/01/16/trump_spicer_boo_hoo.php">&quot;started&quot;</a> Trump&apos;s tirade by honestly telling &apos;Meet the Press&apos; that he didn&apos;t feel Trump was a &quot;legitimate president,&quot; what with all the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170914134014/https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjnxbrBqsnRAhVETCYKHfUFAPcQFggaMAA&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.washingtonpost.com%2Fworld%2Fnational-security%2Ftop-us-cyber-officials-russia-poses-a-major-threat-to-the-countrys-infrastructure-and-networks%2F2017%2F01%2F05%2F36a60b42-d34c-11e6-9cb0-54ab630851e8_story.html&amp;usg=AFQjCNF6NwSdjPXS1Q4JQ8nU5bB7FpOdpA&amp;sig2=zoCfKC4uzdmPEO1X63KSiw&amp;bvm=bv.144224172,d.eWE">Russian interference in the election</a>. Trump retaliated by demeaning Lewis, claiming his Atlanta district was &quot;crime infested&quot; and saying the 76-year-old, who marched with Martin Luther King Jr. and was nearly beaten to death by Alabama State Troopers in 1965, was &quot;Sad!&quot; </p>

<p>Colbert asked, &quot;So Trump spent the Martin Luther King weekend attacking a civil-rights leader who marched and was beaten with Dr. King. What&#x2019;s he going to do on Easter?&quot; </p>

<p>On <em>Late Night</em>, Seth Meyers sharply pointed out that, &quot;If you&#x2019;re wondering whether it&#x2019;s racist to assume Lewis&#x2019; district is &#x2018;crime-infested and falling apart&#x2019; just because he&#x2019;s black, the answer is a hard yes. Of course, as usual, Trump isn&#x2019;t even being consistent. He felt a little differently about Lewis&#x2019; district, which includes most of Atlanta, back in 2006 when he wanted to build a high-rise there, saying, &#x2018;It&#x2019;s a great location in a great city, I&#x2019;ve loved Atlanta for years.&#x2019; I guess I&#x2019;m not surprised; Trump changes positions more often than a porn star with a bad back.&quot;</p>

<p>Meyers also questioned Vice President-elect <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170914134014/http://www.cbsnews.com/news/mike-pence-responds-to-donald-trump-john-lewis-disagreement/">Mike Pence&apos;s attempt to clean up the mess</a> on the Sunday morning talk show circuit, &quot;So, Trump says, &#x2018;go f*ck yourself&#x2019; and Pence says, &#x2018;No, he&#x2019;s just inviting you to engage in some constructive self-love.&apos;&quot; </p>

<p>Last September, Lewis was on the <em>Late Show with Stephen Colbert</em>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170914134014/http://theweek.com/speedreads/646296/rep-john-lewis-fights-racial-injustice-crowdsurfs-colberts-late-show">where he told the audience</a>, &quot;Sometimes you have to find a way to get in the way, get [in] trouble, good trouble, necessary trouble&quot; to fight injustice.</p>

<p>Lewis is also good at crowd-surfing:</p>
