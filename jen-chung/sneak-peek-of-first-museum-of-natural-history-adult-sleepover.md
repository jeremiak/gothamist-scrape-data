</div></div>					<p>Tonight is the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510015156/http://gothamist.com/2014/07/08/night_at_the_museum.php">first-ever adults-only sleepover</a> at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510015156/http://amnh.org/">American Museum of Natural History</a>! </p>

<p>Our deputy editor Jen Carlson is embedded at the scene among the 150 people who are lucky enough to sleep under the (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510015156/http://gothamist.com/2014/07/09/photos_how_to_clean_a_giant_blue_wh.php">very clean</a>) Giant Blue Whale in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510015156/http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/permanent-exhibitions/biodiversity-and-environmental-halls/milstein-hall-of-ocean-life">Milstein Hall of Ocean Life</a>.</p>

<p>The evening kicked off with a champagne reception and music in  Theodore Roosevelt Memorial Hall and was followed by a three-course dinner.</p>

<p>Then, there&apos;s a flashlight tour; a special presentation of The Power of Poison exhibition (this is the last weekend!); a midnight viewing of Dark Universe Space Show, narrated by Neil deGrasse Tyson; and a live animal demonstration! </p>

<p>Attendees, who paid $375 for the event (or $325 if a member) were told, &quot;After lights-out, Museum staff will patrol sleeping locations to ensure that all participants have a sound sleep. Please be advised that if your snoring is disturbing others, you will be awakened and asked to move to another sleeping location. &quot; Also, they can&apos;t wear pajamas (just &quot;comfortable clothes&quot; for sleeping in). Apparently the AMNH will decide whether to hold more adult-only sleepovers after this one, so let&apos;s hope everyone is just cool.</p>

<p>So seethe with jealousy&#x2014;and then do seethe some more in the morning when Jen files her report with more photographs. </p>
