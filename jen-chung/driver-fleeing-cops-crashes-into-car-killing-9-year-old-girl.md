Kenneth Palache, 62, was charged with criminally negligent homicide, leaving the scene of an accident resulting in death, leaving the scene of an accident (failure to show a license) and aggravated unlicensed operation of a motor vehicle.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150511175246/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/9-year-old-girl-dies-crash-caused-motorist-fleeing-traffic-stop-article-1.1779389">The Daily News reports</a> that Palache, a resident of Huntington, NY, had been pulled over at Remsen Avenue and Avenue L in Canarsie because police said &quot;his Honda Odyssey matched a description of an SUV involved in a nearby hit-and-run crash.&quot;</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150511175246/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2014_04_rebeccaram.jpg"> <img alt="2014_04_rebeccaram.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150511175246im_/http://gothamist.com/assets_c/2014/05/2014_04_rebeccaram-thumb-450x450-841305.jpg" width="325" height="325" class="image-right"> </a> </span>But Remsen allegedly fled the traffic stop, traveling southbound on Remsen and colliding into a Hyundai Elantra at Avenue N and Remsen Avenue as well as Toyota Siena (the Hyundai and Toyote were traveling westbound). Nine-year-old Rebecca Ranmarine, who was in the Hyundai, was taken to the Brookdale Hospital, where she was pronounced dead. </p>

<p>Rebecca and her family had just attended church services and were going to dinner. She was in a family friend&apos;s car, while her parents <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150511175246/http://nypost.com/2014/05/04/child-killed-after-minivan-crashes-into-family-car/">were in another car following behind</a>. Her mother Abiola Ranmarine told the News, &quot;I saw the EMS try to take my daughter out of a mangled car. She was lifeless and had blood all over.&quot;</p>

<p>A witness said that the jaws of life were used to open the Hyundai. Passengers in the Hyundai and Toyota were treated for minor injuries. </p>

<p>Father Richard Ranmarine said that the cops<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150511175246/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2014/05/05/police-driver-charged-in-brooklyn-crash-that-killed-9-year-old-girl/"> told him Palache had a suspended license</a>: &quot;If killing someone is worth you driving on a suspended license that&#x2019;s ignorant on your part, because you take a 9-year-old life and you&#x2019;re driving on a suspended license.&quot; He added, &quot;You&#x2019;re not supposed to bury your kids. I&#x2019;m not angry right now. I don&#x2019;t know why, but I&#x2019;m not angry. I&#x2019;m just hurt because I lost my daughter.&quot;</p>

<p>His wife said, &quot;She was a rambunctious 9 -year-old. She loved to dance, she wanted to be a pediatrician.&quot;</p>
