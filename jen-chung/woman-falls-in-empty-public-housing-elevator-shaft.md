Jolanda Joyce, 28, told NY1 said, &quot;I turned around to get my phone from a friend and I opened the elevator door and <strong>I took a step and I just fell. There was no elevator there.</strong>&quot;  She also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506164629/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2008/10/30/2008-10-30_woman_falls_12_feet_down_an_upper_east_s.html">said to the Daily News</a>, &quot;I just didn&apos;t want the elevator to come down and kill me.&quot;  Joyce has severe bruising all over her body and will need physical therapy; NY1 also notes her claim is being investigated: &quot;Sources also cited witnesses who observed Joyce and her companion forcibly opening the elevator doors when the elevator was not present.&quot; The NYC Housing Authority refused to release the building&apos;s elevator maintenance records. In August, a 5-year-old trying to escape a stalled public housing elevator <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506164629/http://gothamist.com/2008/08/20/community_mourns_childs_death_in_fa.php">fell to his death</a>.</p>
