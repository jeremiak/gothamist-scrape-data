</div></div>					<p>Today, the Brooklyn Nets confirmed they are the Brooklyn Nets&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160526195657/https://twitter.com/#!/brettyormark/status/196917119156367360">Nets CEO Brett Yormark Tweeted</a>, &quot;We are the brooklyn nets. #hellobrooklyn&quot;&#x2014;and showed off their logo, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160526195657/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/25/is_this_the_new_logo_of_the_brookly.php">which was leaked by someone</a> working at the Barclays Center last week.  Anyway, you know those <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160526195657/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/26/confirmed_this_is_the_new_brooklyn.php">complaints about the logo being, well, not that great</a>? Blame Jay-Z, because the Nets say he created it.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160526195657/http://www.nba.com/nets/">On the Nets&apos; website</a>, it says, &quot;The Brooklyn Nets today introduced their black and white color scheme and new logo as the team prepares for its exciting relocation to Barclays Center for the 2012-13 NBA season. Created by JAY Z, the Brooklyn Nets&#x2019; brand identity celebrates the history and heritage of the city.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160526195657/http://www.nba.com/nets/news/brooklyn_wait_no_more_120428.html">And from the Nets&apos; blog</a>, in a post written by Ben Couch:</p><blockquote> The Brooklyn Nets have arrived. As a born-and-raised Brooklyn resident, whose parents still live here and work minutes away from the Barclays Center, it&apos;s a day I&apos;ve been waiting for since the proposal was first floated in 2003. And it&apos;s a day that brings a new look to professional sports, a timeless one grounded in city history: the signage of New York&apos;s unparalleled subway system.<p></p>

<p>The new primary logo - created by Brooklyn&apos;s own JAY Z - retains the shield from its previous iteration, and adds that iconic Brooklyn &apos;B&apos; to the basketball that has been part of every logo since the franchise&apos;s 1967 inception as the Americans. The Dodgers had their lettermark, and the Nets have added another model for the borough to bear. &quot;Brooklyn,&quot; of course, is spelled out below. Nets CEO Brett Yormark called this &quot;the new badge for Brooklyn,&quot; and JAY Z believes the design&apos;s boldness demonstrates confidence in the new direction.</p>

<p>The secondary logo, of the &apos;B&apos; inside a basketball, surrounded by the words &quot;Brooklyn New York&quot; immediately popped an image into my head: &quot;Planet Brooklyn.&quot; It&apos;s hard to explain the pride native Brooklynites feel for their home (&quot;BK,&quot; &quot;Bucktown,&quot; the &quot;Brooklyn Zoo&quot;), how outsiders don&apos;t get it and never really will; one measure might be trying to think if you&apos;ve ever met someone from Brooklyn who said they were from &quot;New York.&quot; </p></blockquote>The Nets&apos; Twitter account, which had been @netsbasketball, is now <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160526195657/https://twitter.com/#!/brooklynnets">@brooklynnets</a>.  <p></p>

<p>There are also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160526195657/http://www.nba.com/nets/brooklyn/nets_tv.html">some videos on the Nets&apos; site</a>&#x2014;there may or may not be Aeroflot ads&#x2014;pumping up Brooklyn Pride.  And, FYI, stuff is already on sale at Modell&apos;s and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160526195657/http://www.netsstore.com/nets-merchandise.php">online</a>.</p>
