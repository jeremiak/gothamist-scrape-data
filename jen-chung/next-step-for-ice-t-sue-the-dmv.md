<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:280px; "> <img alt="2010_07_cutespart.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120604152053im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2010_07_cutespart.jpg" width="280" height="219"> <br> <i>The dog that started it all</i></div> A few weeks ago, right after dropping his bulldog at the vet&apos;s for knee surgery, Ice T was arrested for driving with a suspended license near the Lincoln Tunnel.  Ice T said <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120604152053/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/20/ice-t_arrestedfor_driving_on_suspen.php">it was bullshit</a> and blamed an overage rookie cop (which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120604152053/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/22/pba_enters_ice-t_vs_punk_bitch_cop.php">raised the ire of the PBA</a>).   Now Ice T says he&apos;s suing...the DMV.<p></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120604152053/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/26/ice-t_tells_fans_hes_not_breaking_t.php">During his webcast</a> with Final Level Twitter Gang followers, Ice T claimed that the license was deemed suspended because the computer said his insurance lapsed in 2008.  He also said the cop decided not to give him a ticket but to arrest him &quot;because he could.&quot;  But the rapper-actor isn&apos;t going after the man, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120604152053/http://www.tmz.com/2010/08/03/ice-t-coco-arrested-nypd-arrest-court-dmv-suspended-license-no-insurance-video/">telling TMZ</a>: &quot;At the end of the day, after I get this dismissed &#x2026; I either can sue the DMV or the insurance company &#x2026; and that&#x2019;s when I have my revenge.&quot;  </p>

<p>It doesn&apos;t seem like Ice T got into any scrapes with the law as he took puppy Spartacus to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120604152053/http://twitter.com/FINALLEVEL/status/20233051191">get his stitches out today</a>&#x2014;or when he was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120604152053/http://twitter.com/FINALLEVEL/status/20230819051">partying with Will Ferrell</a> last night.  Spartacus <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120604152053/http://twitter.com/CuteSpartacus/status/19695364949">himself Tweets</a>, &quot;It will take a couple weeks before I&apos;m not Crip walkin anymore.&quot;</p>
