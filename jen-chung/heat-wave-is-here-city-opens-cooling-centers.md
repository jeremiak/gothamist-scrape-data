And this week is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160713091341/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/02/holiday_heat_wave_on_the_horizon.php">expected to bring &quot;Baked Apple&quot; conditions</a>.  According to the National Weather Service, &quot;A WARM RIDGE ALOFT AND SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE MID ATLANTIC STATES WILL KEEP HOT AND INCREASINGLY MORE HUMID CONDITIONS ACROSS THE AREA THROUGH MID WEEK.&quot;  Ugh.  The city is opening 100 cooling centers today and 500 more tomorrow; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160713091341/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local&amp;id=7536769">Mayor Bloomberg said</a>, &quot;The threat of heat exhaustion is real, and that&apos;s why we&apos;ve opened these cooling centers.&quot; And, after the jump, are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160713091341/http://www.nyc.gov/html/oem/html/pr/10_07_04_cooling_centers.shtml">suggestions on how to beat the heat</a> from the Office of Emergency Management (stay hydrated!).  </p>
