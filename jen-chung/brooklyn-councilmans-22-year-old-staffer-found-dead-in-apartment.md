An autopsy is being performed today, but a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130329231918/http://www.brooklynpaper.com/stories/34/18/dtg_reichbach_2011_5_6_bk.html">source tells the Brooklyn Paper</a> that she overdosed on prescription drugs. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130329231918/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2011/04/29/2011-04-29_hope_reichbach_aide_to_city_councilman_found_dead_in_brooklyn_apartment.html">Levin issued a statement</a>, &quot;Hope was a wonderful, vivacious, and tough young woman and a beautiful soul who cared deeply about her community and her family. We are deeply saddened by her passing and will miss her more than words can ever describe.&quot;</p>

<p>The Brooklyn Paper also reports, &quot;Reichbach was last seen at her last act of official civic duty, overseeing Levin&#x2019;s Boerum Hill traffic task force meeting at the Belarusian Church on Atlantic Avenue on Wednesday night.&quot;  Police <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130329231918/http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2011/04/29/council-members-chief-of-staff-is-found-dead/?mod=WSJBlog&amp;mod=WSJ_NY_NY_Blog">discovered her body</a> when they were called to her home on Schermerhorn Street yesterday.</p>

<p> Reichbach, who grew up in Boerum Hill and attended Hunter College High School and NYU, was the daughter of Brooklyn Supreme Court Justice Gustin Reichbach. She had run for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130329231918/http://www.hopeforbrooklyn.com/home/">52nd district leader last year</a> on a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130329231918/http://brooklynheightsblog.com/archives/22157">reform platform</a>, but she lost to incumbent Jo Anne Simon. (Reichbach was still encouraged by the fact that she <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130329231918/http://www.facebook.com/hopeforbrooklyn/posts/126522817399357">got 40% of the vote</a>.) City Council Speaker Christine Quinn and Levin also said, &quot;A bright young woman who was at the start of a career in public service is gone too soon.&#x201D;</p>
