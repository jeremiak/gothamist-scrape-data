<p>When Governor Cuomo announced that the NY Department of Motor Vehicles would have a special <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405014456/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/06/are_you_getting_a_giants_super_bowl.php">Super Bowl XLVI Champions license plate for order</a>, that surprised some NY state lawmakers, because they&apos;ve been trying to get a license plate to commemorate 9/11 first responders and victims.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405014456/http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5j86VCoS2Bnls9Wsy_dkYCgH_Yyog?docId=7f0efa6919a6472686fc00a68d19f2a6">Republican Assemblyman James Tedisco said</a>, &quot;I&apos;m happy that the Giants won the Super Bowl as much as the next New Yorker, but who are the real heroes our state should first be celebrating with distinctive plates, the athletes on the gridiron or the first responders and the people who lost their lives on Sept. 11?&quot;</p>

<p>The state hasn&apos;t issued commemorative plates since 2004, because of a lawsuit from a pro-life group that sued to get a &quot;Choose Life&quot; plate.  According to the AP, &quot;Gov. Andrew Cuomo&apos;s administration says the Super Bowl plates don&apos;t violate the moratorium because they are a reworking of a 1987 Giants Super Bowl commemorative plate with a new date and logo.&quot; </p>

<p>Tedisco, State Assemblyman William Scarborough (D), and State Senator Kenneth LaValle (R) announced the bill, which would direct revenue to 9/11 victims&apos; charities, today with the father of a 9/11 victim. Steven Cafiero, whose son worked in the south tower, said, &quot;The Giants win of the Super Bowl is potentially a temporary one year reign. The tragedy of 9/11 with respect to our fallen heroes and those who survived is eternal. Are we more interested in yesterday&apos;s game than that ill-fated day we should never forget. Or have we forgotten?&quot; </p>
