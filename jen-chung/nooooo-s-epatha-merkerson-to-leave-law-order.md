Epatha Merkerson, Jesse L. Martin</i></div> <p></p>

<p>S. Epatha Merkerson, who portrays the beloved Lieutenant Anita Van Buren on <em>Law &amp; Order</em>, told Entertainment Weekly that she will be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510003614/http://ausiellofiles.ew.com/2010/04/01/s-epatha-merkerson-departs-law-order/">leaving the show after this season</a>, &quot;It&#x2019;s a graceful way to go. It&#x2019;s the end of my contract this year, and the storyline has been so perfect. I&#x2019;ve given it my best for 16 years. It&#x2019;s time to move on. I&#x2019;m doing other things and this will be a great way to leave what has been an extraordinary gig.&quot;</p>

<p>It&apos;s unclear what the fate of Van Buren, who has been dealing with cervical cancer, will be (they are only getting scripts for the final episodes now).  Merkerson said she didn&apos;t have a preference, &quot;Van Buren is a hell of a character. How ever they decide to take her out it&#x2019;ll be worthy of the character. Either way it&#x2019;ll be great for me because I get to act it. [Laughs]&quot; She says she&apos;s looking forward to other opportunities&#x2014;she&apos;s currently producing a documentary and, in recent years, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510003614/http://gothamist.com/2005/09/18/emmys_coverage_2005_worst_night_ever.php">won awards</a> for her performance in the TV movie <em>Lackawanna Blues</em> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510003614/http://theater.nytimes.com/2008/01/25/theater/reviews/25sheb.html?fta=y">raves</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510003614/http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/theatre/2008/02/04/080204crth_theatre_als">for the play</a> <em>Come Back, Little Sheba</em>.</p>

<p>When asked about her favorite memory, Merkerson said, &quot;That&#x2019;s a hard one. I loved singing three-part harmony with Jerry [Orbach] and Jesse [Martin]. Jerry and Jesse knew every song that was ever recorded from Broadway. The thing that I hold dear is that even with everyone coming and going, I still keep in touch with most everyone. They&#x2019;re still very much a part of my life, and I don&#x2019;t think that will change.&quot; A very special memory for us is when we <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510003614/http://gothamist.com/2004/03/25/law_order_gothamist_intent.php">visited the set of Law &amp; Order</a> in March 2004: Right before they filmed a scene, Merkerson, Martin and Orbach were happily singing, and their joy seemed to pump up the crew.  </p>

<p>Merkerson has been the show&apos;s longest-running full cast member (she&apos;s followed by Sam Waterston), but did you know she appeared in an episode during the show&apos;s first season as the mother of two victims? And another fun fact: Leslie Hendrix, who plays M.E. Rodgers has been on the show since 1992!</p>
