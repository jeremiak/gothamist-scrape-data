It&apos;s believe the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425172752/http://www.1010wins.com/Three-Alarm-Fire-Damages-Queens-Church--Houses/6931282">fire heated up power lines</a>, causing a fire at the church across the street, the People Life Christian Fellowship church.  A three-alarm fire broke out at the church, which had to be evacuated because firefighters were worried about a possible collapse.  FDNY Deputy Chief <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425172752/http://www.ny1.com/6-bronx-news-content/top_stories/117849/three-alarm-fire-tears-through-queens-church/">told NY1</a>, &quot;Fires in churches are very difficult to fight due to the large amount of concealed spaces. So it got too dangerous to continue with the interior operation we pulled the fire units out and went to an exterior operation.&quot; Fire officials <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425172752/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/queens/2010/04/30/2010-04-30_untitled__2tree30m.html">suspect the high winds</a> caused the maple&apos;s branch to break.</p>
