<p>According to police (who referred to him as &quot;Cake Guy&quot;), he was arrested at 1 a.m. on 10th Avenue. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510011932/http://www.tmz.com/2014/11/13/cake-boss-buddy-valastro-arrested-drunk-driving-dwi-new-york/">TMZ reports</a>, &quot;Cops noticed the TLC star&apos;s 2014 yellow Corvette weaving on 10th Ave in Manhattan. They cops lit &apos;em up, pulled Buddy over and smelled a strong odor of alcohol. We&apos;re told Buddy flunked multiple field sobriety tests. He was cuffed, taken to the cop shop and booked.<strong> A law enforcement source tells us Buddy &apos;blew well above the legal limit.&apos;</strong>&quot; </p>
