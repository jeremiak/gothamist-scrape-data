<p>Besides <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130620173335/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/02/schvitzy_rider_jewish_motorcycle_gr.php#photo-1">Jews on hogs</a>, politicians were at yesterday&apos;s Israel Day Parade. And the 2013 mayoral race&apos;s only Jewish candidate appeared&#x2014;to a very mixed reception.</p>

<p>Idiot social media addict <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130620173335/http://gothamist.com/tags/anthonyweiner">Anthony Weiner</a> marched along Fifth Avenue to some cheers and a bunch of boos and heckling. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130620173335/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/06/02/weiner-gets-mixed-reception-at-israel-day-parade/?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">NY Times reports</a> that one man repeatedly yelled, &quot;Tweet me a picture, Weiner!&quot; which Weiner ignored. The Daily News and Post had more outraged comments:</p><ul>	<li>Many spectators cheered Weiner and wished him luck, but others yelled, &#x201C;Go home, Anthony!&#x201D; &#x201C;Where do you get the nerve?&#x201D; and &#x201C;You don&#x2019;t represent us!&#x201D;&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130620173335/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/election/weiner-booed-israel-parade-article-1.1361249">Daily News</a></li><br>
	<li>&#x201C;<strong>The thing you most need in a mayor ... is moral integrity, and this man has trampled on integrity</strong>,&#x201D; said Sandy Lebowitz of Midwood, Brooklyn, once Weiner&#x2019;s political base. &#x201C;How dare he come here because it&#x2019;s [politically] convenient.&quot;&#x2014;Daily News</li></ul><p></p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="2013_05_weinerparade.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130620173335im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2013_05_weinerparade.jpg" width="640" height="490"> <br> <i> Weiner at the parade (AP)</i></div> <p></p>

<ul>	<li>&#x201C;<strong>He abused the rights of women!</strong>&#x201D; jeered Staten Islander Paul Lebowitz, referring to sexually explicit pictures Weiner tweeted of himself, forcing his resignation from Congress in 2011. &quot;He abused women all over New York City and all over the world by doing what he did. He has no right to be here. He doesn&#x2019;t represent New York.&quot;&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130620173335/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/kosher_weiner_leads_the_vey_hP5nQsNXeiTZZmpZJ9jSOK?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Local">Post</a></li>
	<li>&#x201C;In some ways, your community is the one that&#x2019;s going to judge you the harshest,&#x201D; said one prominent Jewish leader, who said Weiner&#x2019;s tweeted crotch picture and other social media faux pas were &#x201C;embarrassing&#x201D; to many Jews. &#x201C;<strong>There&#x2019;s a Yiddish word for it: shonda. It&#x2019;s like a shame to the community</strong>.&#x201D;&#x2014;Daily News</li>
<li>&#x201C;<strong>He doesn&#x2019;t have a tremendous amount of common sense based upon what he did over the Internet</strong>,&#x201D; Mr. Gerber said when asked his thoughts on Mr. Weiner. &#x201C;And if he doesn&#x2019;t have enough common sense to control his own personal affairs, what is he going to do as an elected leader of the City of New York?&#x201D;&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130620173335/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/06/02/weiner-gets-mixed-reception-at-israel-day-parade/?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">NY Times</a></li>
	<li>&#x201C;We elect people for their morals. <strong>When you&#x2019;re immoral, you don&#x2019;t belong in a position of power or to be elected by the people,</strong>&#x201D; added Phil Rosenblatt. &#x201C;Do I send naked pictures of myself to other people? I don&#x2019;t think so.&#x201D;&#x2014;Post</li></ul>At any rate, Weiner trumpeted his stance on Israel, &quot;When people describe me as being hawkish on Israel, I don&#x2019;t disagree. I mean, I think there should be zero space between the Israeli imperatives in that part of the world and what US policy should be. Frankly, they are an island of democracy in a sea of tyrannical regimes.&quot;
