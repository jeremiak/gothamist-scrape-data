Gurmeet Singh, 40, was charged with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420034132/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/taxi-driver-gurmeet-singh-raped-female-passenger-knifepoint-cops-article-1.1003720?localLinksEnabled=false">rape, robbery, menacing and sex abuse</a>.</p>

<p>According to police, a woman who had been drinking hailed a cab on North 6th Street to take her to Manhattan.  She fell asleep&#x2014;only to wake up to find &quot;her hands had been bound with a scarf and the driver was raping her,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420034132/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/woman_in_cabby_rape_nightmare_OcKAbri7P0PzCK9GzmnaZP#ixzz1M8vA8QAd">according to the Post</a>. The victim also said the driver took her cell phone and $20 in cash before pushing her out of the cab at Rodney Street and South 1st. The woman reported the attack to police and was treated for cuts to her face and hands.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420034132/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/cabdriver_busted_in_KDNjvVwlg1d5RBzoPrRSaO">Post reports</a>, &quot;Singh was finally nabbed after a woman in Harlem was raped by a cabdriver on Sept. 23, and investigators got a partial identification of either the cab&#x2019;s plate or medallion number, police sources said.&quot; Then police reportedly matched Singh to the Williamsburg rape using DNA evidence.  Apparently Singh has not been charged in the Harlem rape yet.</p>
