<p>So that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160826191523/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/31/video_new_video_shows_victims_of_po.php">suspected kidnapping of the couple</a> in Washington Heights that turned out to be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160826191523/http://gothamist.com/2013/04/01/is_possible_manhattan_abduction_act.php">a prank for a surprise birthday getaway</a>? Apparently these chuckleheads were inspired by the scene in Old School where the fraternity pledges are kidnapped. Let&apos;s compare the videos, okay?</p>

<p>Here&apos;s the surveillance footage from last Friday:</p>

<p>And here&apos;s the scene in Old School:</p>

<p>Witnesses in Washington Heights were alarmed by the couple&apos;s screams&#x2014;plus the men chasing the couple, the speeding van, and the guy in the car wearing a mask. But one of the &quot;victims&quot; mother <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160826191523/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/nypd_kidnap_panic_gee_pranks_lot_N4cXYbpHiQAgAt8UYrUQgM?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Manhattan">told the Post</a>, &#x201C;They kept talking about, &#x2018;Let&#x2019;s do it like the movie &#x2018;Old School!&#x2019; It was really very innocent. Then, when it was all over the media, they were shocked.&quot;</p><blockquote>DeJesus&#x2019; daughter Melody, 29, spearheaded the plan to abduct her boyfriend, Cristian Joe...<p></p>

<p>The plan was set in motion when Joe, a software developer who turned 30 March 26, learned that Melody and other pals from St. John&#x2019;s University were preparing a surprise party for him.</p>

<p>To &#x201C;throw him off,&#x201D; DeJesus and five others plotted to snatch Joe and DeJesus off the streets of Washington Heights, where she has an apartment, sources said.</p>

<p>Joe&#x2019;s investment-banker roommate Hamlet Pena, 29, rented a black 2010 Town and Country minivan, sources said. And the pals rented a house in Lake Harmony, Pa., for the weekend.</p>

<p>At around 7 p.m. Friday, Joe and DeJesus, who was carrying two heavy bags, were walking along Haven Avenue near West 173rd Street when a minivan zoomed up and two men popped out.</p></blockquote>The cops confirmed these birthday extremists&apos; stories via emails and polygraph tests. Joe told the Post, &quot;It was all pretty exciting. I&#x2019;m not really willing to talk about it right now. I&#x2019;m just going to try to relax for the rest of the day.&quot;<p></p>
