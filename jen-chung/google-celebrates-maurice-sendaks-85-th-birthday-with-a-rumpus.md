                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2013_06_googlesnadk.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130730162437im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2013_06_googlesnadk.jpg" width="640" height="322" class="image-none"> </span></p>

<p>Today would have been the 85th birthday of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130730162437/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/08/maurice_sendak_where_the_wild_thing.php">Maurice Sendak</a>, the beloved author of classics like &quot;Where the Wild Things Are&quot; and &quot;In The Night Kitchen&quot; who died last year. So Google is honoring the wonderful curmudgeon&#x2014;who told fans begging for a sequel to <br>
&quot;Where the Wild Things Are&quot; to &quot;Go to hell&quot;&#x2014;with a very fun animated Google Doodle. Go to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130730162437/http://Google.com/">Google.com</a>&#x2014;you&apos;ll probably enjoy it more than <em>The Internship</em> and it&apos;s free!</p>
