</div></div>					<p>The main takeaway from last night&apos;s New York gubernatorial debate: THE RENT IS TOO DAMN HIGH.  Of course, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150710072559/http://gothamist.com/2005/10/26/rent_is_too_damn_high.php">we&apos;ve known that since 2005</a>, because Jimmy McMillan has been making his Rent Is Too Damn High Party platform known to New York City <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150710072559/http://gothamist.com/2009/10/06/rent_is_too_damn_high_party_under_p.php">for a while</a>, but during the debate, heavily favored Democratic candidate  Andrew Cuomo was compelled to chime in, &quot;I&apos;m with Jimmy, the rent is too damn high.&quot;  (Video below, plus the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150710072559/http://ny1.com/content/127353/story">full 90-minute debate is here</a>)</p>

<p>The second takeaway: It was debate as silly season theater; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150710072559/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/19/nyregion/19debate.html?ref=nyregion">as the NY Times put it</a>:</p><blockquote>The first &#x2014; and possibly last &#x2014; debate in the New York race for governor unfolded as 90 minutes of political theater verging on farce Monday night, with a format that allowed even cursory discussion of issues like taxes and schools to be interrupted by random one-liners and sometimes inexplicable answers.<p></p>

<p>Kristin Davis, a former prostitution madam, made frequent brothel jokes.</p>

<p>Jimmy McMillan, the candidate of the Rent Is Too Damn High Party, responded to a question about same-sex marriage by declaring &#x201C;If you want to marry a shoe, I&#x2019;ll marry you.&#x201D;</p>

<p>And Carl P. Paladino, the Republican candidate, startled those watching by accidentally walking off stage during the closing statements, in search of the men&#x2019;s room.</p>

<p>&#x201C;When you gotta go, you gotta go,&#x201D; Mr. Paladino&#x2019;s campaign manager, Michael R. Caputo, said afterward, by way of explanation.</p></blockquote><br>
Paladino and Cuomo<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150710072559/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/jokers_wild_in_debate_debacle_Lecj5Mqn1jAqFtJZJZex7L"> opted not to directly criticize each other</a>, instead laying most of the blame at Albany&apos;s doorstep.  Cuomo said, &quot;I know this state like nobody else on this stage. I understand the disgust with Albany, and I share it,&quot; while Paladino said, &quot;My critics, they want to say I&apos;m angry. No, I&apos;m passionate about saving the state of New York. Our government doesn&apos;t need a tweaking. It needs a major overhaul, now.&quot; This left Freedom Party candidate, City Councilman Charles Barron, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150710072559/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/10/18/2010-10-18_andrew_cuomo_carl_paladino_and_zany_band_of_gubernatorial_candidates_trade_barbs.html">to attack Cuomo</a>, saying, &quot;Cuomo will be the king of layoffs,&quot; (Cuomo responded,  &quot;If they go with you Charles, they&apos;d have no jobs&quot;). <p></p>

<p>Warren Redlich, the Libertarian candidate, said, &#x201C;I&apos;ve never been caught with a prostitute, my dad wasn&apos;t governor, and I&apos;ve never been convicted of a crime,&quot; while Davis came armed with numerous zingers: &quot;The key difference between the MTA and my former escort agency is that I operated one set of books and my former agency delivered on time and reliable service&quot;; calling Albany politicians &quot;the biggest whores,&quot; she said she was the only one with the experience to handle them; and she said Paladino&apos;s stock transfer tax plan would make businesses flee &quot;quicker than Carl Paladino at a gay bar.&quot;</p>

<p>Afterwards, Paladino&apos;s spokesman Michael Caputo said that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150710072559/http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1010/43807.html#ixzz12oHqrIBd">he thought McMillan &quot;won the debate.&quot;</a>  </p>
