<p>Jeremy Lin posted a photograph of himself after his arthroscopic surgery&#x2014;Lin Recovery&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150527012038/http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=143485982446637&amp;set=a.122124374582798.16479.100003557086903&amp;type=1&amp;theater">on Facebook</a>, &quot;Praise God for a successful surgery! Now on the road to recovery! Lets gooo. Much love to all the fans for your support and kind words.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150527012038/https://twitter.com/#!/JLin7/status/186967720829526017">Lin also Tweeted</a>, &quot;Be on the lookout...gonna have a random Q&amp;A; with the fans tonight on http://facebook.com/jeremylin7 when the painkiller drugs wear off lol.&quot;<br>
 <br>
On Saturday, the Knicks point guard <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150527012038/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/31/linterrupted_jeremy_lin_out_for_res.php">announced he&apos;d be out for the rest of the season</a> to deal with his knee (he also posted on Facebook, &quot;Thanks for all the love! Ill return from this surgery stronger and better than before...and hopefully in time for the playoffs! Ecclesiastes 3:1&amp;11&quot;).  Well, at least <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150527012038/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/02/youll_find_jesus_looking_like_a_hip.php">Jesus is in Times Square</a>!</p>

<p>It&apos;s suspected the Knicks waited to disclose Lin&apos;s knee woes <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150527012038/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/02/lincredibly_linconsiderate_knicks_a.php">in order for season ticket holders to buy playoff tickets thinking Lin might play</a>.<br>
