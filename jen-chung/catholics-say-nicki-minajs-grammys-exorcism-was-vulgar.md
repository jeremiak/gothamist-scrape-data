<p>Nicki Minaj made up for her <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170506170846/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/05/madonnas_super_bowl_halftime_lfmao.php#photo-7">tame Super Bowl halftime appearance</a> by staging an mock exorcism during her Grammys performance last night.  Shockingly, Catholics are unhappy!</p>

<p>Bill Donohue of the Catholic League issued his criticism (read the whole statement below), &quot;Perhaps the most vulgar part was the sexual statement that showed a scantily clad female dancer stretching backwards while an altar boy knelt between her legs in prayer.... Whether Minaj is possessed is surely an open question, but what is not in doubt is the irresponsibility of The Recording Academy. Never would they allow an artist to insult Judaism or Islam.&quot; Wait, is the Catholic League just upset that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170506170846/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/07/did_the_pope_perform_an_exorcism.php">Pope Benedict wasn&apos;t invited to perform the exorcism</a>? Let&apos;s take a look: </p>

No exorcism is going to let people forget that.&quot; Perhaps the View&apos;s Sherri Shepherd <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170506170846/https://twitter.com/#!/SherriEShepherd/status/168923450637959169">put it best</a>, &quot;Watching Nicki Minaj ... I didn&apos;t know whether to dance or pull out my Bible and lay hands on the tv... 2 old for the #Grammys...&quot;</p>

<p>On the other hand, everyone is still talking about it, along with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170506170846/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/13/this_years_who_is_arcade_fire_who_i.php">trying to figure out who this Bon Iver guy is</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170506170846/http://www.catholicleague.org/is-nicki-minaj-possessed/">Catholic League statement from Bill Donohue</a>: <br>
</p><blockquote>Nicki Minaj, fresh off looking like a fool with Madonna at the Super Bowl, showed up last night on the red carpet at the Grammys with a guy dressed like the pope. This was just a prelude of what was to come.<p></p>

<p>Minaj&#x2019;s performance began on stage with a mock confessional skit. This was followed by a taped video depicting a mock exorcism. With stained glass in the background, she appeared on stage again with choir boys and monks dancing.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most vulgar part was the sexual statement that showed a scantily clad female dancer stretching backwards while an altar boy knelt between her legs in prayer. Finally, &#x201C;Come All Ye Faithful&#x201D; was sung while a man posing as a bishop walked on stage; Minaj was shown levitating.</p>

<p>None of this was by accident, and all of it was approved by The Recording Academy, which puts on the Grammys. Whether Minaj is possessed is surely an open question, but what is not in doubt is the irresponsibility of The Recording Academy. Never would they allow an artist to insult Judaism or Islam.</p>

<p>It&#x2019;s bad enough that Catholics have to fight for their rights vis-&#xE0;-vis a hostile administration in Washington without also having to fend off attacks in the entertainment industry. The net effect, however, will only embolden Catholics, as well as their friends in other faith communities.</p></blockquote><p></p>
