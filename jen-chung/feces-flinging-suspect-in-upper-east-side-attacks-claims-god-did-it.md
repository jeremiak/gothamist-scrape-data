---

	
										<p>A 42-year-old homeless man was arrested in connection with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016012053/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/30/ues_feces_attack.php">a disturbing Manhattan assault involving feces</a>. As he was being escorted from a police building, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016012053/http://abc7ny.com/news/feces-flinging-suspect-arrested-says-god-did-it/1409518/">Ekwan Hill told reporters, &quot;God did it.&quot;</a></p>

<p>Hill was charged with assault and forcible touching for a Monday incident: Police say that he followed a 27-year-old woman walking on East 74th Street between First and York Avenues before stuffing a bag of feces down her shorts. The attack was caught on surveillance video:</p>

<p>Then the authorities noted that a 33-year-old woman was smeared in the face and torso by a man on East 91st Street. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016012053/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/feces-flinging-man-nabbed-brooklyn-completely-deranged-article-1.2695736">The Daily News reports</a>, &quot;Cops nabbed [Hill] at a Brooklyn homeless shelter Thursday night after a block-by-block search near the crime scenes failed to flush out the mad pooper. A tip from a security guard led officers to the Myrtle Ave. Men&#x2019;s Shelter in Bedford-Stuyvesant, where Hill was munching away on his dinner, sources said.&quot;</p>

<p>After he was shown footage of the attacks, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016012053/http://nypost.com/2016/07/01/homeless-poop-pervert-says-god-did-it-after-arrest/">Hill allegedly admitted to police</a>, &quot;That&apos;s me.&quot; Further, police <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016012053/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/feces-flinging-man-nabbed-brooklyn-completely-deranged-article-1.2695736">apparently found latex gloves and a shirt</a> matching the one the suspect was wearing at his shelter locker.</p>

<p>While walking from the police precinct, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016012053/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/NYC-Police-Arrest-Homeless-Man-Feces-Attacks-Shoved-Down-Pants-385166151.html">Hill mentioned Louis Farrakhan</a>, &quot;It&apos;s a Farrakhan. Sometimes they bring you here, they enlighten you. What they do to you, they try to turn you into a slave on Earth.&quot;</p>

<p>Hill, who is being held on $90,000 bail, has 21 prior arrests, but no record of psychological incidents. A homeless shelter resident told the News, &quot;He&#x2019;s really borderline delirious &#x2014; bad body odor, talks to himself, keeps to himself. Those feces he threw was probably his own. He&#x2019;s an outcast type of dude.&quot;</p>

<p>NYPD Chief of Detectives Robert Boyce called the victims, who helped ID Hill, &quot;Tough ladies. Right now they&#x2019;re doing fine. Obviously the ghastliness of the crime has upset them.&quot;<br>
