LIRR President Helena Williams said, &quot;I appreciate the challenges our customers faced during the past week and I thank them for their patience during what has been a difficult time. I would also like to thank the hundreds of railroad employees who worked around the clock to put the damaged signal and switch system back together while keeping service going and assisting our customers throughout the week.&quot;</p>

<p>LIRR had repaired and tested the crucial switch and signal system at the Jamaica station by yesterday.  The agency, which also notes, &quot;The LIRR - the nation&#x2019;s busiest commuter railroad - operates more than 700 trains into and out of its Manhattan and Brooklyn terminals on a typical weekday,&quot; has been trying to update the switch system for years and it&apos;s part of an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170503060113/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local&amp;id=7637502">already existing $150 million upgrade effort</a>.</p>

<p>Some riders didn&apos;t believe the LIRR&apos;s promise of a normal commute today&#x2014;one told WCBS 2, &quot;I&#x2019;m not too sure about that.&quot; Overall, it&apos;s pretty good: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170503060113/http://www.newsday.com/long-island/nassau/lirr-morning-commute-off-to-smooth-start-with-two-exceptions-1.2245427">Newsday reports</a> there have been only two delays (for unknown reasons), &quot;The 7:07 a.m. train from Huntington to Port Jefferson was running 29 minutes late, officials said, delayed by a delayed westbound train. That westbound train, scheduled to run from Port Jefferson to Hunterspoint Avenue was running 16 minutes late. No cause for that delay was given by officials.&quot;</p>
