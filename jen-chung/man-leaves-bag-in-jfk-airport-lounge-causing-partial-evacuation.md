										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2011_07_suitcase.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427141412im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2011_07_suitcase.jpg" width="210" height="210" class="image-left"> </span>A black suitcase found in a business class lounge at JFK Airport prompted the Port Authority to bring in the bomb squad and canine units&#x2014;and even evacuate part of Terminal 8, resulting in a 2.5 hour shut down, this morning.  And, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427141412/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2011/07/25/port-authority-police-respond-after-man-leaves-bag-in-business-class-lounge-at-jfk/">according to WCBS 2</a>, it seems that the suitcase may have simply been forgotten there.  </p>

<p>The Port Authority located the passenger who was on a plane headed for San Francisco: &quot;The man who boarded the flight did not check any bags or bring any carry-on bags aboard, which apparently raised suspicions.&quot;  The black suitcase left in the lounge had very few items in it, and none of the items were harmful.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427141412/http://www.mercurynews.com/breaking-news/ci_18544367">The TSA said</a>, &quot;Out of an abundance of caution, the check-in area and security checkpoints were closed.&quot;</p>
