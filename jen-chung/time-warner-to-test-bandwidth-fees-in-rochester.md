<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2009_04_twcable.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623151306im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2009_04_twcable.jpg" width="200" height="247" class="image-left"> </span>With music and movie downloads prompting its customers to use loads of bandwidth, Time Warner Cable is testing out a controversial tiered-pricing plan for bandwidth usage in Rochester, NY, plus North Carolina and Texas:  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623151306/http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Midmarket/Time-Warner-to-Offer-150-Unlimited-Bandwidth-668524/">According to eWeek</a>, &quot;In addition to 5, 10, 20 and 40GB caps, the company said this week that it would offer a 100GB tier for heavy users. Prices (so far) would range from $29.95 to $75.00 a month, and users would be charged an extra dollar for every additional gigabyte they download, up to a maximum of $75. <strong>An &apos;unlimited&apos; bandwidth plan, therefore, tops out at $150.</strong>&quot;  </p>

<p>The tiered plan was offered after healthy skepticism over why this plan is needed: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623151306/http://blog.wired.com/business/2009/04/time-warner-cab.html">Wired found</a> that TWC&apos;s broadband costs decreased 12%, while their revenues increased by 11%; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623151306/http://blog.wired.com/business/2009/04/bowing-to-press.html">Wired now thinks</a> &quot;it&apos;s still just a ploy to get consumers to sign up for a more expensive plan than they need... it&apos;s bad for innovation and a step backward for the net.&quot;  </p>

<p>The Bits Blog&apos;s Saul Hansell <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623151306/http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/04/08/time-warner-cable-profits-on-broadband-are-great-and-will-grow-because-of-caps/">spoke to TWC COO Landell Hobbs earlier in the week</a>; Hobbs claimed it was fair to charge heavy users more for their bandwidth use, but Hansell writes, &quot;The question of what is &apos;fair&apos; is somewhat more abstract than just saying someone who uses more should pay more. After all, people who watch more hours of cable television don&#x2019;t pay more than those who don&#x2019;t.&quot; And as a commenter pointed out, the trial is not occurring in FIOS markets (which is why <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623151306/http://www.dslreports.com/shownews/Rochester-NY-Versus-Time-Warner-Cable-101836?nocomment=1">Rochester is hoping FIOS will come its way</a>).</p>
