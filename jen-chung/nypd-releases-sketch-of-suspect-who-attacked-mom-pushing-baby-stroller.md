                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2013_09_rapsuspft.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130930135815im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2013_09_rapsuspft.jpg" width="249" height="303" class="image-right"> </span>Last Friday, a 33-year-old woman who was jogging while pushing her 8-month-old baby in a stroller was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130930135815/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/27/woman_with_baby_in_stroller_beats_a.php">attacked in Fort Tryon Park by a man</a> with a broken bottle. Her assailant remains at large, and the police have released a sketch of the suspect. <br>
 <br>
Here&apos;s how the NYPD described the incident, which occurred just after 9 a.m., as an attempted rape: The NYPD received 911 calls about a woman who was attacked on the bike path near the Henry Hudson Parkway in the park. When police arrived, they found the victim, who said she had been pushing her stroller when a man called out to her from behind. The man approached her with a broken bottle and then struggled with her. </p>

<p>They fell to the ground&#x2014;the stroller was knocked down, too&#x2014;and the woman defended herself with a bicycle pump by beating him on the right side of his head causing a laceration. The suspect fled.</p>

<p>The victim, Mary Jane Jarman, described what went through her mind <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130930135815/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local/new_york&amp;id=9264771">in an interview with ABC 7</a>: &quot;I just kept going. Nothing was going through my head except hit him hit him hit him... I was protecting [my baby] for sure. I was not going to go down like that. I was protecting him with my life. I was prepared to kill this man.&quot;</p>

<p>The suspect is described as being approximately 35 years old, 5&apos;9&quot; tall, weighing 160 pounds, wearing a blue thermal shirt and blue jeans. Anyone with information in regards to this attempted rape is asked to call the NYPD&apos;s Crime Stoppers Hotline at 800-577-TIPS.
