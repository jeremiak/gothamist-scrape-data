<p>The National Transportation Safety Board and other authorities are investigating a fatal small plane crash that occurred yesterday morning on Long Island, at Gabreski Airport in Westhampton Beach. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170302023848/http://www.newsday.com/long-island/suffolk/faa-single-engine-plane-crashes-at-westhampton-beach-airport-1.13179270#autoplay=true?pts=950146">According to Newsday</a>, &quot;The FAA said the pilot of the plane, a vintage propeller aircraft built in 1948 and previously used by the military, was practicing touch-and-go maneuvers when it went down.&quot;</p>

<p>Two people were killed, while another person in the plane was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170302023848/https://twitter.com/NYGovCuomo/status/836003399137112064">saved by four National Guardsmen</a>, who had been in a helicopter and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170302023848/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2017/02/26/suffolk-county-plane-crash/">responded to the scene</a>. The survivor was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170302023848/http://abc7ny.com/news/ntsb-investigating-deadly-plane-crash-in-suffolk-county/1775194/">airlifted to a hospital</a>.</p>

<p>The pane was a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170302023848/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Navion">Ryan Navion</a> plane. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170302023848/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/26/nyregion/small-plane-crashes-on-long-island-killing-two.html">From the NY Times</a>:</p><blockquote>The Navion is a popular single-engine plane that was made after World War II. According to Ron Judy, an aircraft mechanic in Oklahoma who is a past board member of the American Navion Society, 1,200 Navions are still registered in the United States, including only about a half-dozen F models like the one that crashed.<p></p>

<p>Students typically do not learn to fly on the Navion. More experienced pilots are better able to handle its retractable landing gear and some other features.</p>

<p>It was unclear whether the pilot in Sunday&#x2019;s crash was a first-time flier. &#x201C;The Navion is very easy to fly after you learn the systems,&#x201D; Mr. Judy, who owns two Navion aircraft, said in a phone interview. &#x201C;But retractable landing gear is not recommended as a first airplane. It&#x2019;s one more thing to think about.&#x201D;</p></blockquote><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170302023848/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2017/02/26/suffolk-county-plane-crash/">WCBS 2 reports</a> that the survivor is &quot;aircraft owner and animal rights activist Richard Rosenthal... His condition isn&#x2019;t known at this time, but he&#x2019;s expected to be alright.&quot;<p></p>
