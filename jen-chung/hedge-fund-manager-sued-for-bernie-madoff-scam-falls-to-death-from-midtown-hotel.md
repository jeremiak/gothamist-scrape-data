<p>A hedge fund manager who was once sued for investing with Ponzi schemer Bernie Madoff died in an apparent suicide Monday afternoon. The body of Charles Murphy, 56, was found on a fourth-floor rooftop of the Sofitel at 45 West 44th Street in Midtown Manhattan.</p>

<p>Witnesses said they saw &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170330164708/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/manhattan/man-plunges-death-24th-floor-nyc-hotel-article-1.3010877?utm_content=bufferf3e75&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=NYDailyNewsTw">a man wearing what appeared to be a dark business suit</a>&quot; jump from the 24th floor, landing on a hotel terrace. &quot;The impact of the landing shattered concrete tiles,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170330164708/http://nypost.com/2017/03/27/man-leaps-to-death-from-sofitel-hotel/">the Post reports</a>.</p>

<p>Murphy had worked at Fairfield Greenwich Hedge Fund, which had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170330164708/http://gothamist.com/2008/12/13/madoffs_billions_in_fraud_casts_a_w.php">invested $7.5 billion with Madoff</a>, whose pyramid scheme unraveled in 2008. He was among the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170330164708/https://h2o.law.harvard.edu/cases/5052">defendants in a lawsuit</a> against the firm, which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170330164708/https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324894104578103620671495216">eventually settled for $80 million</a>. </p>

<p>Before the Madoff-related troubles, Murphy was apparently on the upswing: He paid <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170330164708/http://observer.com/2007/08/banker-buys-bronfman-townhouse-for-recordbooze-family-paid-3m-in-94-sold-for-33m/">$33 million for 7 East 67th Street</a>, which the Observer called, &quot;a record sale for a New York mansion smaller than 26 feet wide.&quot; Then, in 2009, while he was unemployed, Murphy heard that a neighbor was selling their townhouse for $25 million, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170330164708/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/25/realestate/25deal1.html">the NY Times reports</a>:</p><blockquote>Rather than quietly savoring the good fortune of his neighbor, Janna Bullock, a developer who specializes in restoring town houses, Mr. Murphy sprang into action, according to several people familiar with the transaction.<p></p>

<p>He called the successful selling broker, Richard Steinberg of Warburg Realty, and suggested that it might be worth his time to try to interest the buyer, a Russian industrialist, in his house. Maybe he would find it more appealing, with its distinctive Ionic columns and four-story glass atrium in the rear, and buy it instead.</p>

<p>Mr. Murphy did not succeed in snagging the sale.</p></blockquote>He then reportedly tried to sell the townhouse <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170330164708/https://therealdeal.com/2016/03/11/hedge-funder-wants-50m-for-ues-townhouse-with-a-colorful-past/">for $37 million in 2009</a> and then put back <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170330164708/http://ny.curbed.com/2016/3/11/11204014/upper-east-side-nyc-mansion-for-sale">on the market last year for $49.5 million</a>. After a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170330164708/http://ny.curbed.com/2017/2/22/14695388/upper-east-side-townhouse-price-reduction">few price cuts</a>, 11,500 square-foot home is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170330164708/http://www.corcoran.com/nyc/Listings/Display/3652702">currently for sale at $36.5 million</a>.<p></p>

<p>Murphy was currently working as a hedge fund manager at  Paulson &amp; Co; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170330164708/https://www.ft.com/content/e1a18e99-e1e6-3614-b944-d7a4dcd34b21">John Paulson said</a>, &quot;We are extremely saddened by this news. Charles was an extremely gifted and brilliant man, a great partner and a true friend. Our deepest prayers are with his family.&quot;</p>

<p>A Daily News reporter who went to the townhouse <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170330164708/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/manhattan/man-plunges-death-24th-floor-nyc-hotel-article-1.3010877?utm_content=bufferf3e75&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=NYDailyNewsTw">was told</a>, &quot;Go away, leave the family to grieve.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170330164708/http://nypost.com/2017/03/27/man-leaps-to-death-from-sofitel-hotel/">According to the Post</a>, &quot;A parking attendant at a nearby garage said Murphy&#x2019;s wife, Annabella Murphy, crashed their Honda Odyssey last summer but could not afford to fix it. &apos;She didn&#x2019;t even have enough money to pay for the damage,&apos; the attendant said.&quot;</p>
