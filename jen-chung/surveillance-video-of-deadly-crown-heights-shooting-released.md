It shows suspect Leroy Webster exiting a building on Park Place, shooting and killing Eusi Johnson, and then how police fire at Webster as he tries to reenter the building.  However, it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160713000635/http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/2011/09/video_of_the_cr.php">does not show</a> slain neighbor Denise Gay, who<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160713000635/http://gothamist.com/2011/09/08/nypd_its_possible_a_police_bullet_k.php"> may have been killed by a police bullet</a>.<p></p>

<p>Initially police believed that Gay was killed by Webster, who was using a 9mm, but ballistics testing showed that the bullet is actually more similar to a bullet used in a Glock&#x2014;which is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160713000635/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/police_release_shocking_footage_6LdcNz6TKriN9rK3WplIkM?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">what some of the police officers used</a> (and the police fired 73 shots at Webster). Police spokesman Paul Browne said that witnesses saw Webster&apos;s victim, Johnson, with a gun, though a gun has not been found. &quot;Was it one of the officers&#x2019; Glocks?&quot; Browne rhetorically asked. &quot;Possibly. Was it from the gun witnesses said Mr. Johnson had, but has not been recovered? Possibly.&quot;</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160713000635/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/09/nyregion/killer-of-denise-gay-an-innocent-bystander-is-still-a-mystery.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">NY Times spoke to a witness</a>, Lars Johnson, who &quot;thought it was quite likely that officers on Franklin Avenue fired the shot that killed Ms. Gay. He said that while some officers stood across from Mr. Webster&#x2019;s stoop, others stood at the end of the block, at Franklin Avenue. Between Ms. Gay&#x2019;s stoop and Mr. Webster&#x2019;s stoop is a tree that might have kept Ms. Gay out of view of the officers on Franklin, Mr. Russell said.&quot;  </p>

<p>A former police firearms instructor told the Times &quot;the number of shots fired &#x2014; 73 &#x2014; and the number that missed their mark &#x2014; all but 2 &#x2014; was not unusual. He said that the fact that two police officers were shot made &apos;for more frayed nerves,&apos; which he said decreased accuracy. He added that the shooting also occurred at close range, and that the closer officers were to a threat, the more bullets they were likely to fire.&quot;</p>
