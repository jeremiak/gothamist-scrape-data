Apparently a woman was chatted up by Hugues Akassy at the Time Warner Center on Sunday (he &quot;complimented her on her looks&quot;) and he &quot;asked if she&apos;d meet him later.&quot; Cut to Tuesday night, when they met at the park: &quot;As promised, he&apos;d prepared a picnic, which they ate near the 79th Street Boat Basin. Around 9:30, Akassy told her he wanted to take her to an area of the park with a scenic city view, according to police sources. Instead, he raped her, according to the criminal complaint.&quot;  The victim ran away and some other park-goers helped her call the cops; Akassy was arrested at West 72nd Street and West End Avenue.  He&apos;s being held on $100,000 bail.  </p>
