<p>It&apos;s a clear and sunny&#x2014;but cold&#x2014;opening day for the Yankees today, and the MTA is giving riders a chance to head to Yankees Stadium in vintage style. A Lo-V (low-voltage) train is leaving 42nd Street-Grand Central at 11:30 a.m. </p>

<p>The train consists of four cars from 1917; these cars were in use into the 1960s. You can get the Nostalgia Train on the uptown express platform at 11:30 a.m.</p>

<p>For those of you heading to the game, let&apos;s say this again: It&apos;s gonna be really cold.</p>

<p>Dr. Robert Glatter, emergency physician at Lenox Hill Hospital, gave us some tips. &quot;It&apos;s really important to wear layers in this weather. Wear a hat and gloves and cover your face,&quot; he said, emphasizing the significant heat loss from the head. &quot;A full face mask, where you protect your ears and scalp&quot; would be ideal.</p>

<p>&quot;Older people and young children are apt to lose heat much faster,&quot; Dr. Glatter continued. &quot;When you&apos;re older, it&apos;s hard to regulate temperature, which puts them at risk of hypothermia.&quot;</p>

<p>Adults should (obviously) also bundle their children. He said, &quot;Kids won&apos;t notice they&apos;re cold because they&apos;re having too much fun.&quot; </p>

<p>Another group at risk while watching a cold weather game are those taking anti-psychotic, anti-depressants or sedatives because those medication affect how one regulates temperature.  </p>

<p>Actually, anyone can potentially develop hypothermia if sitting in 40 degree-or-below conditions for a prolonged amount of time, if you&apos;re sitting in the sun and sweating. Dr. Glatter recommends, &quot;Drinking warm fluids&quot;&#x2014;and avoiding alcohol. &quot;Alcohol causes blood vessels to dilate and it speeds up heat loss.&quot; Water is a fan&apos;s best bet to stay hydrated; coffee will dehydrate you too much, and some sports drinks have a lot of caffeine. </p>

<p>So, wash down your hot dog with water if you dare unwrap your scarf from your face.</p>
