<p>The NYPD has a list of all the streets that are going to be closed for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025133515/http://gothamist.com/2016/07/01/map_nyc_2016_july_4_fireworks.php#photo-1">tonight&apos;s Macy&apos;s July 4th Fireworks extravaganza</a> over the East River, which is basically a cheat sheet for where to head for viewing spots. </p>

<p>Here&apos;s what&apos;s going to be closed: </p>

<p><strong>In Manhattan</strong><br>
- FDR Drive between Battery Park Underpass and East 63rd Street South Street between Whitehall Street and Robert F. Wagner Sr. Place FDR Drive Service Roads between Cherry Street and 63rd Street Water Street between Whitehall Street and Fulton Street<br>
- Pearl Street between Fulton Street and Robert F Wagner Sr Place Whitehall Street between Water Street and South Street<br>

- East 48th Street between 1st Avenue and FDR Drive East 49th Street between 1st Avenue and FDR Drive East 53rd Street between 1st Avenue and FDR Drive</p>

<p><strong>In Brooklyn</strong><br>
- Area bounded by Atlantic Avenue on the South Old Fulton Street on the North Hicks Street on the East; East River on the West (All Inclusive)<br>
- Old Fulton Street between Hicks Street and Prospect Street<br>
- Cadman Plaza West between Prospect Street and Tillary Street<br>
- Front Street between Old Fulton Street and Jay Street<br>

<p><b>In Queens</b><br>
- Area bounded by 44th Drive on the North Borden Avenue on the South Vernon Boulevard on the East; East River on the West (All Inclusive)<br>
- Center Boulevard between Borden Avenue and 54th Avenue<br>
- 2nd Street between Borden Avenue and Newtown Creek /Dead End Vernon Boulevard between 54th Avenue and Newtown Creek/Dead End 54th Avenue between Center Boulevard and Vernon Boulevard</p>

<p>In other words, Battery Park; Battery Park City; Roosevelt Island; and Hunter&apos;s Point South Waterfront Park are not places to see the fireworks.</p>

<p>Macy&apos;s adds, &quot;All Manhattan, Queens and Brooklyn access blocks will close as viewing areas fill up. Spectators will be re-directed to open access blocks as appropriate. All access points are subject to change up until the day of the event by NYPD. All spectators should note that lawn chairs, blankets, backpacks/containers or other large bags will not be permitted into the public viewing locations for security purposes. Spectators are subject to search by NYPD.&quot;</p>

<p>The fireworks start at 9:25 p.m., but the tailgating/jockeying for spots <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025133515/http://gothamist.com/2015/07/05/photos_waiting_for_the_fireworks_in.php#photo-1">starts hours before</a>.</p>
