(WABC 7)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>A Manhattan nail salon owner defended her customers and store from an armed robber on Wednesday night. Annie Sheng, who owns Peony Nails Spa at 542 LaGuardia Place, just down the street from Washington Square Park, says it started when a man wearing a cap and a plaid shirt in her store around 8:30 p.m.; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028111618/http://abc7ny.com/news/nail-salon-owner-fends-off-armed-robber-shoves-gun-down-his-pants/1484895/">WABC 7 reports</a> that besides Sheng, there were 10 customers, two children and her staff in the store. </p>

<p>Sheng asked him if he needed any help and that&apos;s when he threatened her for the money. She told ABC 7, &quot;He came my way and said, don&apos;t talk I have a gun, give me your money.&quot;</p>

<p>As he approached her behind the cash register counter, Sheng <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028111618/http://nypost.com/2016/08/25/nail-salon-worker-shoves-gun-down-would-be-robbers-pants/">said</a> the robber reached for his gun, so she acted: &quot;I see him try to go get it and I push it [his arm] and just push him,&quot; shoving him in the body and then shoving the gun down his pants.</p>

<p>The robber walked out of the store, and Sheng followed him to the door and then called the police:</p>

<p>Sheng, who told reporters she wasn&apos;t scared, is 5&apos;4&quot; and about 120 pounds. The attempted robber is about 5&apos;11&quot; and 160 pounds. Police say the suspect &quot;fits the description&quot; of a man wanted for other armed robberies at nail salons, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161028111618/http://nypost.com/2016/08/25/nail-salon-worker-shoves-gun-down-would-be-robbers-pants/">according to the Post</a>.</p>

<p>Her 10-year-old daughter said, &quot;She should have done it but at the same time, it was dangerous.&quot;</p>
