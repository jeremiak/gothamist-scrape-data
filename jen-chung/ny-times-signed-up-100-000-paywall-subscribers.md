So far, the Times has signed up about 100,000 subscribers (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110424064658/http://mediamemo.allthingsd.com/20110421/the-new-york-times-sells-100000-digital-subscriptions-in-three-weeks/">not including the subscribers through the Lincoln ads</a>) since the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110424064658/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/28/nytimescom_paywall_is_up_there_may.php">20 articles-free-then-paywall introduction three weeks ago</a>; its press release states, &quot;So soon after the launch, the Company does not yet have visibility into conversion and retention rates for these paying customers after the initial promotional period, although early indicators are encouraging.&quot; What&apos;s less encouraging: First quarter net income <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110424064658/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/22/business/media/22times.html?_r=1&amp;partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">dropping 57% versus last year</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110424064658/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/22/business/media/22times.html?_r=1&amp;partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">According to the NY Times</a> (the paper), &quot;The weakness in print advertising, coupled with an unexpected drop in revenue at About.com, led to earnings of 4 cents a share before special items are excluded, compared with 8 cents a share in the period a year ago.&quot;  And the Times (the company) says the About.com issues&#x2014;a 10% decrease in revenue&#x2014;are due to a Google algorithm change.</p>

<p>Anyway, back to the digital paywall: The Times apparently had hoped to sign up 300,000 subscribers (subscriptions cost $15-35 per four week period), and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110424064658/http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/2011/03/21/nyt-reveals-its-paywall-hopes/">Reuters&apos; Felix Salmon says</a>, &quot;300,000 subscribers paying on average $200 per year (some will pay more; others will not renew every four weeks for a whole year) works out at $60 million &#x2014; or less than 20% of the NYT&#x2019;s digital advertising revenues. It&#x2019;s a big enough number that I can certainly see why the NYT spent a long time considering this move. But it&#x2019;s not so big as to be a no-brainer.&quot; But he&apos;s doubtful the Times can get to 300,000.</p>
