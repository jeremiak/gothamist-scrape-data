<p>Poor Matt Harvey. The Mets starter <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509174211/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/16/video_mets_ace_matt_harvey_asks_bas.php">and ace reporter</a> had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509174211/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/27/matt_harveys_season_is_over_breakin.php">injured his UCL</a> last year and ended up getting <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509174211/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/07/sports/baseball/dr-frank-jobe-who-pioneered-tommy-john-surgery-dies-at-88.html">Tommy John surgery</a>. Today was the sixth month anniversary, so Harvey Tweeted a photograph of himself in recovery, flipping the bird, &quot;I can&#x2019;t believe it&#x2019;s been 6 months already #tommyjohn&quot;</p>

<p>And now he&apos;s deleted his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509174211/https://twitter.com/mattharvey33">entire Twitter account</a>. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509174211/http://deadspin.com/matt-harvey-tweets-bird-flipping-picture-immediately-d-1566110140">Deadspin says</a>, &quot;It&apos;s a silly and harmless picture, but Harvey, or someone within the Mets organization, thought that its existence was offensive enough to warrant Harvey deleting his entire Twitter account. Hey, at least the account went out in style.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509174211/http://ftw.usatoday.com/2014/04/matt-harvey-twitter-photo-bird/">USA Today&apos;s FTW blog opines</a>, &quot;To Harvey&#x2019;s credit, he&#x2019;s made no secret of his love for New York City. He is one of the rare ballplayers who braves the taxes to make his offseason home in Manhattan, and he has clashed with the Mets to be able to do his rehab in the city. <strong>And in these parts, the gesture&#x2019;s as much a daily greeting as an indication of ill-will.</strong>&quot; </p>

<p>Maybe Harvey was just tired of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509174211/http://www.nj.com/mets/index.ssf/2014/01/matt_harvey_goes_toe-to-toe_with_yankees_fan_on_twitter.html">arguing with Yankees fans</a>? Anyway, Mets fans, you still have Jay Horwitz&apos;s Twitter:</p>
