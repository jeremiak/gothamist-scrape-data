Now spin is coming from the Kennedy camp and their version is that the 52-year-old had a seizure.<p></p>

<p>A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150323004148/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/kerry_seizure_gQQrqjYtJIckvXRGC1Q1CL">Kennedy source tells the Post</a>, &quot;They think she may have had some sort of seizure... This is terrifying for her because she doesn&#x2019;t know why it happened,&quot; suggesting that the condition may be a previously undiagnosed one.</p>

<p>State police say that Kennedy hit a tractor-trailer on I-684 in Westchester County <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150323004148/http://www.lohud.com/article/20120713/NEWS/307130090/Kerry-Kennedy-charged-impaired-driving?odyssey=mod|breaking|text|Frontpage">&quot;while driving erratically.&quot;</a> She apparently left the scene&#x2014;with a flat tire&#x2014;and state police found her and her disabled car later.  Kennedy was charged with driving while ability impaired by drugs but a spokesman said, &quot;Kerry Kennedy voluntarily took breathalyzer, blood and urine tests - all of which showed no drugs or alcohol whatsoever in her system. The charges were filed before the test results were available.&quot;</p>

<p>The source says the blood and urine tests taken at Northern Westchester Hospital came back negative, but the police are still waiting for their results.  Kennedy&apos;s cousin Patrick famously crashed in Washington D.C. in 2006 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150323004148/http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/05/washington/05cnd-kennedy.html?pagewanted=all">while apparently on Ambien</a>&#x2014;it was 2:45 a.m. and he told cops he was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150323004148/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_J._Kennedy#Capitol_Hill_intoxicated-driving_accident">late for a Congressional vote</a>.</p>
