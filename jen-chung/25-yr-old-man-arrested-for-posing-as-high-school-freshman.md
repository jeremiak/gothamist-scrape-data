<p>Yesterday, a NJ high school was a little freaked out when a man walked into the office and asked to enroll as a student. Apparently <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203044741/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0151738/">Garry Marshall didn&apos;t pull any strings</a> in advance. </p>

School officials were concerned, because the 6-foot-1, 265-pound man before them was clearly not a young teenager, police said. To avoid conflict, they handed Walden a packet of enrollment forms and told him to have his parents fill them out.&quot;</p>

<p>The school alerted the police, who found Walden on a street and arrested him after they found that he had &quot;outstanding warrants from traffic tickets in Andover and Sparta.&quot; It&apos;s unclear why he was trying to enroll in the high school, but authorities are still investigating.</p>
