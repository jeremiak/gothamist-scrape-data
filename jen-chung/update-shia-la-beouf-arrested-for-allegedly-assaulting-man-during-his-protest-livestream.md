<p><strong>[UPDATES BELOW]</strong> Actor-<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170130015827/http://laist.com/2014/02/11/shia_labeouf_sets_up_shop_at_galler.php">turned-artist</a>-<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170130015827/http://gothamist.com/2017/01/20/shia_labeouf_anti-trump_livestream.php">turned-activist</a> Shia LaBeouf was arrested today after scuffling with someone outside of the Museum of the Moving Image in Queens. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170130015827/http://www.tmz.com/2017/01/25/shia-labeouf-arrested-nyc/">According to TMZ</a>, &quot;Cops tell us a guy walked in front of the mounted camera and said something -- possibly regarding Trump -- but whatever it was, Shia got pissed.&quot;</p>

<p>On inauguration day, LaBeouf <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170130015827/http://gothamist.com/2017/01/20/shia_labeouf_anti-trump_livestream.php">launched a four-year art installation/protest/livestream</a>&#x2014;to protest the presidency of Donald Trump&#x2014;outside the Astoria cultural institution. The piece, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170130015827/http://www.hewillnotdivide.us/">HE WILL NOT DIVIDE US</a>, invites &quot;the public... to deliver the words &apos;HE WILL NOT DIVIDE US&apos; into a camera mounted on a wall outside the Museum of the Moving Image, New York, repeating the phrase as many times, and for as long as they wish...  In this way, the mantra &quot;HE WILL NOT DIVIDE US&quot; acts as a show of resistance or insistence, opposition or optimism, guided by the spirit of each individual participant and the community.&quot; </p>

<p>At some point around midnight, LaBeouf is accused of grabbing a 25-year-old man&apos;s scarf, &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170130015827/http://pagesix.com/2017/01/26/shia-labeouf-released-from-jail-after-anti-trump-clash/?_ga=1.142587444.729017374.1480337807">causing a scratch to the man&#x2019;s face&quot; and then pushing him</a> down. You can see the police approaching LaBeouf to arrest him:</p>

<p>&quot;Shia took a hit for us. There were all these Nazis here, he came out and tried to protect us,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170130015827/http://www.tmz.com/2017/01/25/shia-labeouf-arrested-nyc/">other protesters reportedly said</a>.</p>

<p>An NYPD spokesman said that LaBeouf was charged with misdemeanor assault and harassment. When he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170130015827/http://pagesix.com/2017/01/26/shia-labeouf-released-from-jail-after-anti-trump-clash/?_ga=1.142587444.729017374.1480337807">was released</a> from the 114th Precinct, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170130015827/http://abc7ny.com/news/actor-shia-labeouf-arrested-during-anti-trump-protest-outside-museum-in-queens/1721554/">he waved at the press and yelled</a>, &quot;He will not divide us!&quot;</p>

<p><b>Update</b>: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170130015827/http://www.tmz.com/2017/01/26/shia-labeouf-assault-protest-fight-video/">TMZ found video at the time</a> of the event: It &quot;doesn&apos;t capture the entire incident, but there&apos;s definitely a scuffle between Shia and another guy. At one point in the video you hear someone say, &apos;He hit me!&apos;&quot;</p>

<div><iframe src="//web.archive.org/web/20170130015827if_/http://cdnapisec.kaltura.com/p/591531/sp/59153100/embedIframeJs/uiconf_id/6740162/partner_id/591531?iframeembed=true&amp;playerId=kaltura_player_1413478522&amp;entry_id=0_td1la39t" width="640" height="405" allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" style="width: 640; height: 360px;"></iframe></div>

<p><br>Then there&apos;s another video &quot;where Shia seems to whack a guy in the chest, shake his hand and then yank him away.&quot;</p>

<p><iframe src="//web.archive.org/web/20170130015827if_/http://cdnapisec.kaltura.com/p/591531/sp/59153100/embedIframeJs/uiconf_id/6740162/partner_id/591531?iframeembed=true&amp;playerId=kaltura_player_1413478522&amp;entry_id=0_yytfnrls" width="640" height="405" allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" style="width: 640; height: 360px;"></iframe></p>

<p>Earlier this week, LaBeouf got into a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170130015827/http://gothamist.com/2017/01/23/video_shia_labeouf_gets_into_intens.php">shouting match with a white supremacist</a> during the livestream. LaBeouf&apos;s interests and antics have resulted in both art projects&#x2014;like a livestream of him <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170130015827/http://gothamist.com/2015/11/12/shia_day_3_still_got_it.php">watching all his movies at the Angelika</a>&#x2014;and innocent victims (a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170130015827/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/26/labeouf_lookalike_roughed_up.php">man was sucker-punched</a> because he looked like LaBeouf last year). In 2014, he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170130015827/http://gothamist.com/2014/09/10/shia_labeouf_pleads_guilty_to_being.php">pleaded guilty to being a jerk</a> at the Broadway musical, <em>Cabaret</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Update: </strong> Another video shows LaBeouf shoving a man who says, &quot;Hitler did nothing wrong.&quot; It&apos;s unclear if this is the incident that led to his arrest.</p>
