<p>A little girl who was apparently on her way to ballet class died this morning after the car she was riding in crashed into a garbage truck in the Bronx. An NYPD spokesman the young child &quot;was seated properly&quot; in the vehicle.</p>

<p>The crash occurred around 10 a.m., when a car with four people going north on Bruckner Boulevard near 136th Street apparently swerved into another lane because of a &quot;pothole or other damage in the road,&quot; the spokesman said. The car was then struck by a garbage truck.</p>

<p>&quot;The truck landed on the top of the rear passenger side of the car, crushing the girl, witness Ana Trinidad said&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170429202327/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Crash-Bruckner-Boulevard-Bronx-Garbage-Truck--420811323.html?_osource=SocialFlowTwt_NYBrand">to NBC New York</a>. Also: &quot;The mother was hysterical, saying her baby was under the truck, Trinidad said. The drivers were telling the garbage truck driver to back up, but he appeared to be in shock and got out of the truck to see what happened, Trinidad said.&quot;</p>
