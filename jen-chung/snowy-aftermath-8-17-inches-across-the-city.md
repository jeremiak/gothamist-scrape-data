<p>After sending meteorologists, local officials, and groceries into overdrive, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522041949/http://gothamist.com/2010/02/10/snowmageddon_strikes.php">Snowmageddon</a>/<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522041949/http://gothamist.com/2010/02/10/snow_kidding_aside_snow_is_here.php">Snowpocalypse</a> 2010, NYC Edition, arrived yesterday, depositing substantial amounts of snow in the five boroughs.  The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522041949/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/gotham_great_f6GzUvazjeNMOyz8IDsjfK">Post reports</a>, &quot;By late last night, Staten Island had been socked with as much as 17 inches of snow. A foot fell in parts of The Bronx, while sections of Queens and Brooklyn were buried under 13 inches, and Central Park had 10.&quot;  Which meant there was plenty of snow for kids to sled or make snowballs on their snow day&#x2014;but, no, it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522041949/http://www.1010wins.com/Bouncing-Back-from-the-Storm/6338113">wasn&apos;t a blizzard</a>. </p>

<p>Snowfall at JFK and Laguardia Airports was 9 inches and 8 inches respectively; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522041949/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/12/nyregion/12storm.html?ref=nyregion">according to the NY Times</a>, &quot;At the three major airports in the New York area, flights that were scheduled for Thursday morning were in limbo. Officials at LaGuardia and Kennedy airports said several airlines &#x2014; including Southwest and Continental &#x2014; had canceled all or many of their morning flights, and they warned passengers, even those with later flights, to call ahead before heading to the airport.&quot;  </p>

<p>Mass transit is running normally (okay, there are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522041949/http://mta.info/">some service changes and delays</a> on the subways) today and things were pretty smooth yesterday, since the MTA told passengers ahead of time about snow service, such as  the evening rush hour on commuter trains <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522041949/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/02/10/2010-02-10_whiteout_on_the_way_city_in_for_1216_inch_snowfall_40_mph_wind_gusts_.html">starting around 1 p.m. yesterday</a>.</p>
