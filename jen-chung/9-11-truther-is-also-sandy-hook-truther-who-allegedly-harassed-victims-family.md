<p>This past weekend, the family of Victoria Soto held a 5K run in her honor. Soto was a first-grade teacher at Sandy Hook Elementary school who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171023225542/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/15/heroic_teachers_and_staff_protected.php">died while trying to protect her students</a> during the 2012 massacre. The event, however, was marred by a Brooklyn man who apparently approached Soto&apos;s family and insisted the fatal shootings never happened. </p>

<p>Matthew Mills, 32, was arrested for breach of peace. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171023225542/http://www.ctpost.com/news/article/Police-Truther-tried-to-disrupt-race-for-slain-6620218.php">According to the Connecticut Post</a>, &quot;Mills approached Vicki&#x2019;s Soto&#x2019;s younger sister, Jillian. They said Mills shoved a photograph in the younger Soto&#x2019;s face and began angrily charging that not only did the Sandy Hook tragedy not take place, but that Vicki Soto never existed.&quot;</p><blockquote>Police said the photo was of the Soto family, including Vicki Soto, sitting on a seawall in Stratford.<p></p>

<p>Jillian Soto became very upset at Mills&#x2019; actions and repeatedly asked him to leave her alone, but he persisted until officers arrived, police said. He then ran off, police said, and was captured following a short foot chase with officers on Main Street.</p></blockquote>Mills <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171023225542/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/brooklyn-man-harassed-family-slain-newtown-teacher-article-1.2430266">told the Daily News he politely asked a question</a>, &quot;I went to the race to specifically talk to her, but I waited until the end, and I donated also. They&#x2019;re making me out to be a bad guy. I just asked one question.&quot;<p></p>

<p>Why does Mills, who posted $2,500 bond, think the Sandy Hook massacre didn&apos;t happen? &quot;I try not to speculate. There are shootings all the time with no conspiracies related to them. But this conspiracy about the photo has really caught on online. &#x2026;People say the rocks don&#x2019;t match up, the shadows don&#x2019;t match up,&quot; he explained to the News. &quot;I just wanted to put to rest whether these four kids were really there together on those rocks that day or not. It&#x2019;s not for shock value.&quot;</p>

<p>In 2014, Mills <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171023225542/http://gothamist.com/2014/02/03/911_truther_got_past_high_security.php">interrupted the post-NY/NJ Super Bowl press conference</a> to say, &quot;Investigate 9/11. 9/11 was perpetrated by people within our own government.&quot;</p>
