<p>[<strong>UPDATE: </strong>NBC has obtained video, below, of the moments before <em>and</em> after the teens fell through the ice.] A group of teenagers were apparently trying to take a selfie on an iced-over Central Park pond&#x2014;but, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508050737/http://gothamist.com/2017/02/20/forecast_spring_arriving_about_a_mo.php">with the unseasonably warm weather</a>, the ice broke and the kids fell into the frigid water. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508050737/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/manhattan/teens-rescued-falling-ice-central-park-pond-article-1.2977676">A witness said told the Daily News</a>, &quot;They were taking a selfie and they all went down together... I was very scared.&quot;</p>

<p>The incident occurred at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508050737/http://www.centralparknyc.org/things-to-see-and-do/attractions/pond.html?referrer=https://www.google.com/">pond near Central Park South</a>, between Fifth and Sixth Avenues. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508050737/http://abc7ny.com/news/7-teens-rescued-after-falling-into-icy-pond-in-central-park/1764194/">According to WABC 7</a>, &quot;A witness said he saw the group go out onto the ice, where they were taking selfies and jumping on the ice&#x2014;then they broke through the surface. Seven fell into the water when the ice cracked and had to be rescued.&quot;</p>

<p>Two men skateboarding nearby were among the good Samaritans to help fish the teens, whose ages are reportedly between 13 and 16 years old, out. Bennett Jonas wrote on his Instagram: </p><blockquote><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508050737/https://www.instagram.com/p/BQwsFMJjhxa/?taken-by=ethanturnbull">@ethanturnbull</a> and I tonight went out to Skateboard around Central Park. Passing a frozen lake we saw a group of 6 kids go though the ice. We ran over and immediately we&apos;re put in the toughest situation I think We will have to go through. 6 kids screaming for help being pulled down by each other, soaking backpacks and huge jackets. I had to make a decision to get in the middle of that or watch them drown. When I got about waste deep two of the kids jumped on top of me and pulled me under. I had to pick them both up and throw them to Ethan. I then grabbed a ladder and pulled the next 2 in. Behind them were two lifeless bodies that I knew I couldn&apos;t get too. I swam out and grabbed the last two guys and was able to get them to shore and keep them alive.</blockquote>He added, &quot;I feel humbled and grateful that God called me to be there tonight, I&apos;m still shaking and am completely shook by what I experienced, but I&apos;m alive and so are 6 other kids who got very lucky tonight.&quot;<p></p>

I think after tonight we can reinforce to the people that playing on ice is not a good idea... [They] are all okay. They are suffering from some mild hypothermia.&quot; </p>

<p>FDNY divers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508050737/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/manhattan/teens-rescued-falling-ice-central-park-pond-article-1.2977676">searched the pond for an hour</a>. Schof described the operation:</p><blockquote>When FDNY members arrived on scene, there were approximately seven people coming out of the water. EMS units rendered first aid and our Rescue units put three divers in the water for about an hour to search the area. Conditions were very murky, they didn&apos;t have a lot of visibility down there. They were working off of a 50 ft rope so they did cover a lot of area.</blockquote><p></p>

<p>The FDNY added, &quot;There is no such thing as safe ice. Kids and adults should never walk on frozen water, regardless of the temperature outside. Ponds and lakes in our city parks may seem frozen, but they are never solid enough for anyone to safely walk on. By venturing out onto frozen water, you risk not only your life, but the lives of first responders.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 11:10 a.m.:</strong> Here&apos;s shocking video that two tourists from Paraguay <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170508050737/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/NYC-Kids-Recover-After-Skateboarders-Rescue-From-Icy-Pond-Central-Park-414319903.html">provided to NBC NY</a>; it shows the teens playing on the ice and then struggling for their lives as the tourists continue to document the incident without helping:</p>
