Six-year-old Nikiyah Torres, who suffers from epilepsy (her parents had been waiting to see what their family doctor said about the swine flu vaccine) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111111203039/http://wcbstv.com/local/swine.flu.nyc.2.1281183.html">told WCBS 2</a>, &quot;<strong>He just gave me the needle, without asking me what is my name</strong>.&quot;<p></p>

<p>The little girl<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111111203039/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/education/2009/10/30/2009-10-30_sorry_bout_the_shot_public_school_nurses_give_swine_flu_vaccine_to_kids_without_.html"> told the Daily News</a>, &quot;My stomach was hurting, and I was itching,&quot; and was taken to the hospital from her school, PS 335 in Brooklyn.
