<p>New York City, Long Island, and southern Westchester County are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427141415/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local&amp;id=7641738">under a tropical storm watch</a>, which means we could see 39- to 73 mile per hour winds, as Hurricane Earl heads closer to the U.S..  Winds of 100 mph are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427141415/http://www.accuweather.com/blogs/news/story/36521/hurricane-earl-100mph-winds-to-1.asp">expected to hit the Outer Banks</a> in North Carolina tonight, and then Earl will continue north.  Hurricane warnings was issued for Massachusetts and Connecticut was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427141415/http://www.courant.com/news/weather/ctn-weather-thursday-0902,0,7459903.story">issued a tropical storm warning</a>. </p>

<p>On Long Island, the Red Cross is prepping shelters while Long Island Power Authority is &quot;bringing in 1,600 line workers from out of state to supplement its own force of 500 workers.&quot; One LIPA official explained to the WABC 7 why it&apos;s hard to bring back power when it goes out, &quot;The electric system is what we call radial. In other words, there&apos;s not an opportunity to have a lot of redundancy in the electric system because it&apos;s a peninsula on an island.&quot;  And on the Jersey Shore, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427141415/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2010/09/02/hurricane-earl-leads-to-long-island-n-j-tropical-storm-warnings/">waves are getting rough</a>, but there are no plans to evacuate.</p>

<p>Of course, the prospect of Earl <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427141415/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/09/01/2010-09-01_as_hurricane_earl_bears_down_on_east_coast_nyc_surfers_get_ready_to_ride_the_wav.html">excites some people: Surfers</a>. Those catching waves at Rockaway Beach yesterday told the Daily News, &quot;It&apos;s gonna be double overhead on Friday - double your height!&quot; and &quot;Somewhere between New Jersey and Montauk, it&apos;ll be good. As the storm gets closer, the waves will definitely get bigger.&quot;</p>
