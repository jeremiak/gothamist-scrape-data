</div></div>					<p>This is the second-to-last day of the Metropolitan Museum&apos;s record-breaking <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171015223548/http://blog.metmuseum.org/alexandermcqueen/">Alexander McQueen show, <em>Savage Beauty</em></a>. If there was a frenzy yesterday, with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171015223548/http://gothamist.com/2011/08/05/dozens_outside_of_metropolitan_muse.php">dozens already outside the museum by 7:45 a.m.</a>, well, then today things are at fever pitch, because a huge line had formed outside the Met by 7:30 a.m.  You snooze, you lose!</p>

<p>As <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171015223548/http://twitter.com/#!/mattheworley/status/99844217655926784">one person Tweeted</a>, &quot;There is a 2 hr. line outside to get to a 2 hr. line inside to get to a 2 hr. line for the exhibit.&quot;  But visitors who manage to make it through the wait say the show, which is a retrospective of the late designer&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171015223548/http://gothamist.com/2011/06/04/skip_the_line_visit_the_mets_mcquee.php">intricately tailored and wildly imaginative work</a>, is well worth it.  Just look at this <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171015223548/http://blog.metmuseum.org/alexandermcqueen/dress-horn-of-plenty/">dress made from duck feathers</a>!  </p>

<p>We hear that the Metropolitan Museum of Art had closed some galleries in order to pull security guards to help manage the McQueen crowds.  Also, the museum had been allowing members, as well as people who sign up for memberships while in line (yesterday morning, Met Museum staffers were offering memberships to line-waiters), to cut the line.  However, yesterday&apos;s crowds surged, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171015223548/http://www.dnainfo.com/20110805/upper-east-side/met-denies-members-right-skip-huge-alexander-mcqueen-lines">forcing the Met to stop the linecutting</a>, which pissed off some members, like a new mother who left her three-month-old baby for the first time&#x2014;she told DNAinfo, &quot;Had I known there was no membership line I would have arranged my childcare accordingly.&quot; </p>

<p>The Met<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171015223548/http://www.metmuseum.org/member/"> now has a message on its website</a>: &quot;Due to extremely high attendance, we regret that we are no longer able to offer Members priority access to Alexander McQueen: Savage Beauty.  Please note that Memberships are not refundable.&quot; Or as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171015223548/http://twitter.com/#!/nicolettemason/status/99843882849812481">another person Tweeted</a>, &quot;Sorry, but if you waited til the last minute to see McQueen at The Met and you&apos;re complaining about the line...&quot;</p>

<p>The museum is open <a href="" http:="" blog.metmuseum.org="" alexandermcqueen="" "="">until midnight tonight and tomorrow night</a>. </p>
