</div></div>					<p>On a blustery (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150523083637/http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/more-sports/kenyans-wilson-kipsang-mary-keitany-win-nyc-marathon-article-1.1996971">50 mph winds!</a>), frigid day, thousands of runners competed in the NYC Marathon. Mary Keitany won the women&apos;s race, with a time of 2:25:07, while Wilson Kipsang of Kenya held off Ethiopia&apos;s Lelisa Desisa Benti for a finish of 2:10:59. </p>

<p>Desisa tried to pass Kipsang during the final leg, in Central Park. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150523083637/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/03/sports/new-york-marathon-2014-wilson-kipsang-a-kenyan-wins-on-late-sprint.html">As the NY Times describes it</a>, &quot;As Desisa, the younger challenger, tried to surge ahead, his left arm pushed Kipsang&#x2019;s arm away. That turned a windy, tactical race into, well, hand-to-hand combat. And the look on Kipsang&#x2019;s face said everything. He glared at Desisa. His next move was to dig into his finishing gear and sprint ahead in the final turn of the course in Central Park, a surge that sent him flying through the finish line, seven seconds ahead of Desisa. Only then did his defiance turn into a smile.&quot;</p>

<p>Kipsang also won the World Marathon Majors title, for winning three marathons in two years, which means a bonus of $500,000 in addition to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150523083637/http://www.tcsnycmarathon.org/about-the-race/prize-money-and-bonus-awards">NYC Marathon purse of $100,000</a>. Keitany also received $100,000 for winning her race.</p>

<p>An estimated 50,000 runners registered for the race. Among them were some celebrity newbies, like tennis star Caroline Wozniacki who was raising money for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150523083637/http://www.nyrr.org/charities-clubs-and-community/team-for-kids">Team for Kids</a>:</p>
