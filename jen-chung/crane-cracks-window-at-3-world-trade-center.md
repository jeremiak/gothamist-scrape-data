<p>The lower Manhattan building is under construction, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016014645/http://pix11.com/2016/08/11/wrecking-ball-crashes-into-3-world-trade-center-building-under-construction/">PIX 11 reports</a>, &quot;OEM officials initially called it as a wrecking ball, but sources are describing it as a block that was part of a crane at the construction site.&quot;</p>

<p>Apparently Tishman Construction crews were trying to prep the crane for a storm, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016014645/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2016/08/11/3-world-trade-center-wrecking-ball/">according to WCBS 2</a>, &quot;a gust of wind blasted in [and] sent a weighted ball attached to the crane&#x2019;s line into the glass curtain wall at the base of 3 World Trade Center.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016014645/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/3-World-Trade-Center-Wrecking-Ball-Crash-Window-389940792.html">Tishman Construction said</a>, &quot;Although a glass panel was cracked, nothing fell or is in danger of falling. Further, there were no injuries and the incident was completely contained within the site perimeter. Safety inspectors and authorities are on site and looking into the incident. The panel will be replaced.&quot;</p>

<p>3 World Trade Center, designed by Richard Rogers, will be 80 stories. It is scheduled to open in 2018.</p>
