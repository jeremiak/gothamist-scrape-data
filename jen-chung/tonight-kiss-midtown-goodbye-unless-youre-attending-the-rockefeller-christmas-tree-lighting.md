<p>If your office is in Midtown, you&apos;ll probably need to plan an after-work drink far far from Midtown, because tonight is the annual <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160406052140/http://gothamist.com/2015/11/05/tree_died_for_freedom.php">bloody</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160406052140/https://www.rockefellercenter.com/whats-happening/2015/12/2/2015-rockefeller-center-tree-lighting/">Rockefeller Christmas Tree lighting ceremony</a>. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160406052140/http://www.nbc.com/christmas-in-rockefeller-center">extravaganza</a>&#x2014;Mary J. Blige! Sting! Carly Rae Jepsen! Mayor de Blasio!&#x2014;begins at 7 p.m., but the NYPD warns that the &quot;heavy traffic&quot; will start at 3 p.m. and won&apos;t end until 11 p.m.</p>

<p>The following streets will be closed to cars starting at 3 p.m., until after the tree is lit: 48th, 49th, 50th, and 51st Streets between Avenue of the Americas and Fifth Avenue. As for pedestrians, the NYPD says, &quot;Spectators are urged to use mass transit to attend the event and are reminded that umbrellas, backpacks and/or large bags are prohibited.&quot; Also, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160406052140/http://gothamist.com/2015/11/27/dad_given_summons_for_flying_drone.php">don&apos;t bring your freaking drone</a> what is wrong with you.<br>
 <br>
Once the tree is lit, the 30,000 energy efficient LED lights will staying flickering every day from 5:30 a.m. to 11:30 p.m. through January 7, 2016. However, on Christmas Day, the tree will be blazing for 24 hours and on New Year&apos;s Eve, it will go dark at 9 p.m.</p>

<p>Last year, the tree lighting coincided with the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160406052140/http://gothamist.com/2014/12/03/eric_garner_grand_jury.php">decision not to indict NYPD cop Daniel Pantaleo</a> in the death of Eric Garner, sparking <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160406052140/http://gothamist.com/2014/12/04/eric_garner_chokehold_protest.php#photo-1">outraged protests outside Rockefeller Plaza</a> during the ceremony.</p>
