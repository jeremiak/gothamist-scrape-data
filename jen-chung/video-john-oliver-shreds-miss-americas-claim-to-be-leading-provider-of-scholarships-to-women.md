<p>Last week, Miss New York <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170409212336/http://gothamist.com/2014/09/15/miss_new_york_america.php">was crowned Miss America</a>, and while the win was an unusual three-peat for the Empire State, non-native New Yorker John Oliver was not satisfied with the victory.</p>

<p>On Last Week Tonight, Oliver pointed out that many contestants actually do very well given the insane questions they are faced. For instance, one judge asked, &quot;The savagery of the ISIS threat to our security was demonstrated by the gruesome videos of two journalists and an aid worker being beheaded. What should our country&#x2019;s response be?&quot; Oliver&apos;s reaction: &quot;That&#x2019;s right&#x2014;they asked one of the contestants to solve ISIS. And she only had 20 seconds to do it!&quot;</p>

<p>While Oliver was incredibly impressed with the answer (&quot;Holy shit&#x2014;that&apos;s better than I could do in that amount of time&quot;), he wasn&apos;t impressed with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170409212336/http://www.missamerica.org/scholarships/purpose.aspx">Miss America&apos;s claim</a> as  the &quot;national&apos;s largest scholarship program for young women with $45 million made available annually.&quot; Because that $45 million number seemed like bullshit: Last Week Tonight could only find $4 million in funds&#x2014;it seems like Miss America is doing some fancy calculating:</p>

<p>Oliver recommended other groups that offer scholarships to women: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170409212336/http://societyofwomenengineers.swe.org/">Society of Women Engineers</a>; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170409212336/http://www.rankinfoundation.org/">Jeanette Rankin Women&#x2019;s Scholarship Fund</a>; and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170409212336/http://www.patsyminkfoundation.org/">Patsy Mink Foundation</a>.</p>
