<p>The NYPD is currently in their second day of a &quot;citywide initiative to address the use of cell phones/texting while driving and failing to yield to pedestrians.&quot; The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140518114330/http://gothamist.com/2014/05/13/heads_up_assholes_nypd_cracks_down.php">first day was Tuesday</a>, which was most notable for the NYPD&apos;s arrest of Alec Baldwin after he was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140518114330/http://gothamist.com/2014/05/13/alec_baldwin_arrested.php">stopped for bicycling the wrong way</a> on Fifth Avenue.</p>

<p>The NYPD explained &quot;that the use of a hand held cell phone and texting while driving a vehicle is illegal. Driving while operating, talking, or texting on a cell phone or other similar hand-held device is extremely dangerous and endangers the safety of both drivers and pedestrians. In addition, preserving the right of way for pedestrians is a primary focus of the NYPD&#x2019;s traffic safety mission. Motor vehicle operators are also reminded that yielding to pedestrians at intersections is paramount to the safety of all New Yorkers.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140518114330/http://www.transalt.org/">Transportation Alternatives</a>&apos; Noah Budnick lauded the crackdown, &quot;It shows that the goal is changing people&#x2019;s behavior not writing the most number of tickets. Writing tickets is important, but the point isn&#x2019;t to set-up an &apos;I gotcha&apos; situation and nab people. The point is to compel people to make safe decisions.&quot;</p>

<p>The jackass in the photograph above was busy checking out his phone for many minutes on the LIE yesterday, and was even observed watching a movie. But I guess he wasn&apos;t sweating it, because his car had &quot;MD&quot; license plates.</p>
