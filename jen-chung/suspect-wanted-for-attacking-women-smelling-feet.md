<p>Police are hoping the public can help them find a man who went on a violent rampage at the end of last month, attacking two women in separate incidents on August 30 in the Bronx.</p>

<p>At 1:10 a.m., at  Sedgwick and Bailey Avenues, an 18-year-old was choked and forced to the ground by a man, who then &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131203074504/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local/new_york&amp;id=9236884">removed the woman&apos;s shoes and began to smell her feet</a>.&quot; The woman struggled to stand and the attacker fled. </p>

<p>Then, 20 minutes later on Park View Place, police say the same suspect grabbed a 24-year-old, choked her and tried to open her pants. He fled when she struggled.</p>
