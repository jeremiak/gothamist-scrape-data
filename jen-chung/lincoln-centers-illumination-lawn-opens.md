</div></div>					<p>Today, Lincoln Center opened up its Illumination Lawn, as part of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025131629/http://www.dillerscofidio.com/lincoln-center.html">its renovations</a> by Diller Scofidio + Renfro.  The lawn, which is near West 65th Street between Broadway and Amsterdam, replaces a footbridge that used to connect Lincoln Center with Juilliard and the Walter Reade Theatre and underneath the lawn will be the future site of a restaurant. The NY Times&apos; architecture critic <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025131629/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/21/arts/design/21lincoln.html?ref=arts">Nicolai Ouroussoff calls</a> the lawn &quot;the project&#x2019;s most dazzling space, [it] warps up on two sides, so that climbing it can make you feel as if you were about to float off into the air on a carpet of green.&quot;</p>

<p>Other components of the renovated Lincoln Cener include <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025131629/http://gothamist.com/2009/02/20/alice_tully_hall_renovations_raptur.php">Alice Tully Hall</a> and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025131629/http://gothamist.com/2009/10/02/lincoln_center_fountain_returns_wit.php">beloved fountain</a>.  And fun fact: Lincoln Center and the city are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161025131629/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/20/arts/music/20liability.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">negotiating over liability for future slip-and-falls</a>. </p>
