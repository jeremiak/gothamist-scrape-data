										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2010_02_bidenmtp.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501165031im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2010_02_bidenmtp.jpg" width="240" height="180" class="image-left"> </span>Vice President Joe Biden <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501165031/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/35393664/ns/politics/">appeared on morning talk shows today</a> and hit a number of topics&#x2014;including the 9/11 terror trial as well as his predecessor, Dick Cheney. Of where Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and the other alleged 9/11 terror plotters may eventually be tried, Biden said that a military tribunal <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501165031/http://wcbstv.com/topstories/september.11.trial.2.1494017.html">has not been ruled out</a>.  Of Cheney, Biden said, &quot;Let me choose my words carefully here... Dick Cheney&apos;s a fine fellow. He&apos;s entitled to his own opinion. He&apos;s not entitled to rewrite history. He&apos;s not entitled to his own facts.&quot;</p>

<p>Biden specifically mentioned Cheney&apos;s criticism of Christmas Day bomber Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, who was read his Miranda rights, pointing out that Cheney had recommended that shoe bomber Richard Reid&#x2014;during the Bush administration&#x2014; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501165031/http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0210/32399.html">be given a civilian trial</a>.  And the Vice President <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501165031/http://wcbstv.com/national/biden.dick.cheney.2.1494022.html">refuted Cheney&apos;s claims</a> that the United States is less safe, pointing out that during Obama&apos;s term so far, &quot;We&apos;ve eliminated 12 of their top 20 people. We have taken out 100 of their associates. They are in fact not able to do anything remotely like they were in the past. They are on the run. I don&apos;t know where Dick Cheney has been. Look, it&apos;s one thing, again, to criticize. It&apos;s another thing to sort of rewrite history. What is he talking about?&quot;</p>

<p>Biden also said that he was confident that KSM would be convicted on Meet the Press&#x2014;here&apos;s video:</p>
