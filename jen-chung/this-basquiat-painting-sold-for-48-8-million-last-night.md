<p>Last night&apos;s contemporary art auction at Christie&apos;s broke numerous records for the artists. For instance, a 1982 painting by Jean-Michel Basquiat called &quot;Dustheads&quot; was expected to sell for around $25-35 million&#x2014;but it went to $48.4 million. The night&apos;s sales totaled $495 million; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928040221/http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-05-15/basquiat-s-dustheads-sells-for-record-49-million.html">dealer Asher Edelman said</a>, &#x201C;<strong>It was amazing. Nobody knows what to do with their money, I guess.</strong>&#x201D;</p>

<p>Another record was set for Jackson Pollock&#x2014;his &quot;Number 19&quot; from 1948 sold for $58 million (estimate was $35 million). A collector told Bloomberg, &quot;You have a lot of foreign money, a lot of hedge-fund money. Stocks could go down 50 percent. If this goes down, it will eventually go back up. These are historical pieces.&#x201D;</p>
