<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2011_03_plazahotel.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110325125657im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2011_03_plazahotel.jpg" width="170" height="217" class="image-left"> </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110325125657/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/business/realestate/residential/exclusive_russian_composer_lands_oiWYcIFoCUodva7taQ0mGK">According to the Post</a>, this is the biggest condominium sale ever: Russian composer Igor Krutoy bought a 6,000-square foot apartment at the Plaza Hotel for $48 million ($3,000 per square foot!). And, &quot;While it has sweeping views of Central Park, it is not even a full-floor unit.&quot; Egads!</p>

<p>But there may be a method to the madness:  &quot;Sources told the Post that Krutoy was willing to shell out the big bucks because he was tired of losing out. Krutoy had previously lost other apartments he was interested in buying at fancy 15 Central Park West and the Time Warner Center by bidding too low.&quot;  When rumors of a $40+ million deal floated last month, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110325125657/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703786804576138650849433420.html?mod=WSJ_NY_RealEstate_LEFTTopStories">Wall Street Journal gave</a> a little more information on Krutoy&apos;s background, &quot;Mr. Krutoy has recorded more than 100 songs in Russia and has collaborated with many music stars from that country, selling millions of albums world-wide. Last March, he played at Radio City Music Hall with opera star Dmitri Hvorostovsky.&quot;<br>
