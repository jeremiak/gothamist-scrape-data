<p>Reality star Teresa Giudice will be spending serious time in prison, a federal judge decided. Giudice was sentenced to 15 months in prison for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013113/http://gothamist.com/2014/03/04/real_housewives_of_prison_teresa_gi.php">committing numerous types of fraud</a> with her husband. She said tearfully <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013113/http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2014/10/real_housewives_teresa_giudice_sentenced_to_15_months_in_prison_joe_gets_41_months.html#incart_maj-story-2">before receiving the sentence</a>, &quot;I&#x2019;m so scared. I&#x2019;m blessed, but today I am also humbled. I fully take responsibility for my actions. This is not how I was raised. I am more sorry than anyone will ever know.&quot;</p>

<p>Her husband, Joe Giudice, was sentenced to 41 months in prison and may be deported (he&apos;s an Italian citizen). Teresa Giudice will serve her sentence first, starting in January, and when she&apos;s completed her time, then Joe Giudice will go to prison. This is to ensure their children have at least one parent.</p>

<p>Joe Giudice told U.S. District Judge Esther Salas, &quot;I stand here humiliated before the court and my family and society. I disgraced many people, including my wife and four daughters. I take full responsibility for my actions. I promise to be a better person.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013113/http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2014/10/real_housewives_teresa_giudice_sentenced_to_15_months_in_prison_joe_gets_41_months.html#incart_maj-story-2">From NJ.com:</a></p><blockquote>Joe Giudice&apos;s lawyer Miles Feinstein delivered a long tribute on his client&apos;s behalf, asking Salas to consider leniency because Joe took responsibility for the crimes in an attempt to exonerate his wife. &quot;That is the mark of a real man,&quot; he said.<p></p>

<p>He talked at length about the recent death of Joe&apos;s father Frank, who died from a massive heart attack &quot;in Joe&apos;s arms,&quot; and how devastated his client has been since then. Though mostly stoic throughout the hearing, at this point Joe Giudice took a tissue offered by his wife and wiped away tears.</p>

<p>&quot;Nobody can say Joe Giudice is not a good and considerate son,&quot; Feinstein said. &quot;He&apos;s a low-key and loving individual. This is the real Joe. Not the &apos;Housewives&apos; Joe.&quot;</p>

<p>He also read a letter from Joe&apos;s mother Filomena, who could not be in court due to health problems. &quot;My son needs a slap on the wrist, not to be taken away from his family.&quot;</p>

<p>Salas later responded: &quot;It&apos;s not a slap on your wrist you need, Mr. Giudice. Uh-uh. You need to understand the laws of this country and that they need to be respected.&quot;</p></blockquote>The Bergen Record <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013113/http://www.northjersey.com/news/real-housewives-star-teresa-giudice-gets-15-months-in-federal-prison-1.1101133">detailed Salas&apos;s annoyance at the couple</a>: <blockquote>Salas lectured the couple about &quot;glaring omissions&quot; in both of their financial disclosure forms. Salas read off recreational vehicles, home furnishings, cars, construction equipment &#x2014; all not reported to the probation office by the couple but listed on federal prosecutor&apos;s documents.<p></p>

<p>The judge questioned why Teresa says she has no jewelry on the forms, but her attorney defended that statement, saying her costume jewelry is worth very little. The couple listed $25,000 in furnishings for their $3 million Montville home, an assertion that her attorney said was accurate. He explained that most of the furnishings seen on TV are brought in by the production company.</p>

<p>The judge then went on to list seven other items not listed on any court documents that were later discovered by government investigators.</p></blockquote>The couple is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510013113/http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2014/10/real_housewives_teresa_giudice_sentenced_to_15_months_in_prison_joe_gets_41_months.html#incart_maj-story-2">millions in debt</a>.<p></p>
