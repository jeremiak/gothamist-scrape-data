The lawyer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120217221007/http://www.ctpost.com/news/article/Son-wants-to-evict-98-year-old-mom-3337069.php">assigned by a court to represent Mary Kantorowski said</a>, &quot;This is just a despicable situation. Mary has been living here happily paying all the expenses for the house and now her son, Peter, comes along and is telling her, `Get the hell out,&apos; so he can sell it.&quot;</p>

<p>Mary Kantorowski received the eviction notice <em>on her birthday</em>.  She said, &quot;My husband worked hard, difficult jobs to buy this house. He built the garage and did a lot of work on the house and he told me never to leave it.&quot; </p>

<p>Her son <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120217221007/http://www.wtnh.com/dpp/news/fairfield_cty/98-yr-old-woman-evicted-by-her-son">Peter Kantorowski claims</a> that he &quot;doesn&apos;t like the way she&apos;s living over there.&quot; While he hasn&apos;t visited her in the home in eight months, he says she&apos;s had many falls, &quot;At her age, at 98, I&apos;m sure that she should be with people of her peers, she should have her meals on time.&quot;  But these details from the CT Post suggest something besides concern:</p><blockquote>According to Probate Court records, in 1996 Mary and her husband, John, agreed to transfer the house to a trust administered by Peter Kantorowski on the condition that Mary would live there until her death, and upon her death, the house would go to Peter and his younger brother, Jack. However, in July 2005, Peter Kantorowski quitclaimed the house from that trust to another he and his wife control, giving him ownership of the house....<p></p>

<p>[Attorney Richard] Bortolot, who is not being paid to represent Mary Kantorowski, said shortly after serving his mother with eviction papers, Peter Kantorowski attempted to put the house up for sale. He was stopped by subsequent Probate Court proceedings. During one of those proceedings, it was determined Peter Kantorowski had wrongly taken on his mother&apos;s power of attorney, using her money for his expenses.</p></blockquote>Mary Kantorowski said of the eviction, &quot;I didn&apos;t think he would do it,&quot; and her other son Jack said, &quot;I just don&apos;t understand him at all, what&apos;s happening with him, there are no other words to call him, he&apos;s just a scumbag.&quot; <p></p>

<p>But Peter Kantorowski has this irresistible invitation, &quot;I have this big house in Trumbull and she is welcome to come live with me. I took care of my mother-in-law until she died in my house.&quot; </p>
