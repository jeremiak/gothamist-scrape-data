<p>Banksy is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160229142751/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/17/nypd_intent_on_bringing_banksy_to_j.php">apparently in the crosshairs of the NYPD</a>, if you believe the NY Post (it&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160229142751/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/17/banksy_bed_stuy.php">unclear if Banksy does</a>). Last night, notable homegrown NYC graffiti artist <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160229142751/http://cope2.net/">Cope2</a> posted an intriguing image of what he says was a collaboration between himself and Banksy in the South Bronx&#x2014;a stencil of a pig with &quot;NYPD!&quot; on it and COPE&apos;s tag above it.</p>

<p>Cope posted the image on Instagram, but it seems to be gone (see a screengrab below). However, he also Tweeted it at Fox News and the NY Post:</p>

<p>Banksy enthusiast Nic Garcia told us he thinks it&apos;s authentic, given &quot;how clean and crisp the stencil is.&quot; Our own graffiti expert Jake Dobkin agreed, &quot;The stencil looks right, and Banksy has been trying to repair his relationship with old school graffiti artists since the Robbo fiasco in 2009&quot; when Banksy <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160229142751/http://twistedsifter.com/2012/01/banksy-vs-robbo-war-in-pictures/">covered up London graffit artist King Robbo&apos;s work</a>.</p>

<p>&quot;Also Cope has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160229142751/https://www.google.com/search?q=cope+faile+graffiti&amp;espv=210&amp;es_sm=91&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ax9hUqLRJ_Sz4AOjk4HYBQ&amp;ved=0CAcQ_AUoAQ&amp;biw=1436&amp;bih=728#es_sm=91&amp;espv=210&amp;q=cope+shepard+fairey&amp;tbm=isch">done a bunch of collaborations with Shepard Fairey</a>, who&apos;s friends with Banksy,&quot; Dobkin said, &quot;so this would&apos;ve been easy for him to set up.&quot;</p>

<p>Cope had incurred the wrath of the city and NYPD with his prolific tagging of subway trains (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160229142751/http://instagram.com/p/fkaS6XCbL2/">here&apos;s an example</a>)&#x2014;he was arrested in 2010 for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160229142751/http://gothamist.com/2010/10/02/cope2_busted_for_tagging_subway_tra.php">tagging a train in the Bronx</a>. He once <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160229142751/http://gothamist.com/2005/08/18/cope2_leaves_a_message.php">left an expletive-filled message</a> on anti-graffiti City Council Member Peter Vallone Jr.&apos;s voicemail, because Vallone opposed a block party for the launch of a graffiti video game, claiming it would inspire more graffiti. A judge eventually ruled the party could go on, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160229142751/http://gothamist.com/2005/08/23/eckos_graffiti_party_is_on.php">wryly noting</a>, &quot;By the same token, presumably, a street performance of &apos;Hamlet&apos; would be tantamount to encouraging revenge murder.&quot;</p>

<p><b>Update</b>: It looks like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160229142751/http://animalnewyork.com/2013/no-cope2-did-not-do-a-collabo-with-banksy/">it&apos;s not a collaboration</a>&#x2014;WHY GOD!!!</p>
