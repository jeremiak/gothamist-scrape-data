</div></div><p>Occupy Wall Street protesters took advantage of the beautiful weather by protesting&apos;s Mitt Romney&apos;s fund-raiser at the Waldorf-Astoria.  Armed with signs ranging from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120314225048/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/14/mitt_romney_really_wants_to_get_rid.php">&quot;Kiss My Grits&quot;</a> to &quot;Romney Is The 1%,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120314225048/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/martin-zabell/hundreds-protest-mitt-1-r_b_1345744.html">from &quot;Taxes Aren&apos;t For Everyone&quot; to &quot;Will Work For Caviar&quot;</a> as well as people dressed as grim reapers with Romney masks and &quot;Job Cremation&quot; urns, it was a festive event with one woman shouting, &quot;I want to feel what it&apos;s like to have a $2,500 lunch and write it off my taxes&quot; and another asking, &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120314225048/http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/post/occupy-romney/2012/03/14/gIQABmITCS_blog.html">Who needs some trickle-down champagne?</a>&quot; Oh, and one 83-year-old woman brought a wooden spatula and told the Washington Post&apos;s Ezra Klein, &quot;It&#x2019;s a vaginal probe. Since he&#x2019;s so in favor of it, I&#x2019;ve brought it to him as a gift.&#x201D;</p>

<p>And the Reverend Billy Talen was there: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120314225048/http://www.politicker.com/2012/03/14/occupy-wall-street-protests-mitt-romney-at-the-waldorf-astoria/">According to Politicker</a>, Talen yelled, &#x201C;Hallelujah! We are the 99 percent! The corruption of our elected officials makes it impossible to do anything about homelessness, foreclosures and evictions &#x2026; the illegal wars, the climate change.&quot; And one admitted Romney donor said, &quot;What do I think about the race? The Republicans are their own worst enemy.&quot;</p>

<p>Klein also reports, &quot;Many protesters insisted, however, that being anti-Romney didn&#x2019;t mean they were pro-Obama &#x2014; at least for the time being. Leonard, the college professor, had volunteered for Obama&#x2019;s 2008 campaign but became disillusioned thereafter by the president&#x2019;s support for Wall Street bailouts, along with his more recent decision to codify indefinite military detention. &apos;For the first time, I stepped back and decided I&#x2019;m not going to knee-jerk support Obama,&apos; he told me, while adding that he&#x2019;s &apos;leaving the door open.&apos;&quot; </p>

<p>FWIW: Former Senator Al D&apos;Amato<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120314225048/http://www.politico.com/blogs/burns-haberman/2012/03/damato-for-romney-117430.html"> loves Romney</a>, &quot;Governor Romney is a successful businessman. He understands how our economy works and has a proven record of creating jobs. We need a man with his experience to take charge and lead our economy or we&#x2019;ll have four more years of the most liberal, tax and spend administration we have ever seen. I urge my fellow Republicans to unite behind Gov. Romney and make him our nominee.&quot;</p>
