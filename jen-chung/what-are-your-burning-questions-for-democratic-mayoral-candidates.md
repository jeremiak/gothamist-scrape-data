<p>There just over three weeks until the primary election, and the mayoral candidates are racing around town trying to woo voters. If you haven&apos;t seen a candidate at one of their public events&#x2014;like City Council Speaker Christine Quinn at the Seaside Summer Concert Series, former Comptroller Bill Thompson at Heavenly Vision Christian Center or Comptroller John Liu EVERYWHERE&#x2014;you <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506012831/http://www.google.com/moderator/#16/e=208860">can submit a question for us to ask them</a> at this Wednesday&apos;s Official Campaign Finance Board Mayoral Debate for the Democratic candidates!</p>

<p>Gothamist and our partners, NY1 News, NY1 Noticias, WNYC, Citizens Committee for New York City, Citizens Union, Hispanic Federation, and Transportation Alternatives, are the debate, and questions from the public have been used during the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506012831/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/13/spitzer_and_stringer_continue_attac.php">Democratic Comptroller</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506012831/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/16/public_advocate_debate.php">Democratic Public Advocate</a> debates. FWIW, you can ask if women <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506012831/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/19/susan_sarandon_invokes_vagina_to_ex.php#photo-1">should vote with their vaginas</a>, but Weiner probably won&apos;t want to answer a questions about men voting with their penises. </p>

<p>You&apos;ll have until noon on Wednesday, August 21 to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506012831/http://www.google.com/moderator/#16/e=208860">submit questions here</a> and then we&apos;ll send them onto the moderators. You will be able to watch/listen to the debate in different ways: Via TV on NY1/NY1 Noticias; via radio on WNYC; and via online on Gothamist. Or head to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506012831/http://www.nyccfb.info/debates/schedule-2013.html">one of the CFB&apos;s watch parties</a> (see the column at far right). We&apos;ll also be liveblogging!</p>
