The attacker managed to choke the victim so she passed out and take her clothes off, but he left when he heard noises from the other person living in the apartment.  He did take her wedding ring, passport, camera and cell phone, and is seen leaving the building--with flowers and bike--around 4:45 a.m.  The building is supposed to have an &quot;attended lobby,&quot; but the doorman apparently wasn&apos;t around during the attack.</p>
