<p>Hey, to all the 2 train riders who think their commutes suck most&#x2014;you have some statistical proof now!  The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425160708/http://straphangers.org/">Straphangers Campaign</a> released a study of the nearly 5,000 alerts the MTA issued last year and found that the 2 train had the &quot;most controllable significant incidents in 2011.&quot;  </p>

<p>According to the Straphangers, the MTA issued 4,937 alerts last year, and after removing &quot;irrelevant alerts,&quot; the advocacy group dug into the remaining 4,580 alerts.  They grouped them into two types: &quot;The first was &#x201C;controllable,&#x201D; including such things as signal or mechanical problems. The second was &#x201C;uncontrollable,&#x201D; such as police activity or sick passenger. The Campaign concluded it was not fair to hold transit officials accountable for many of these uncontrollable incidents. As a result, the Campaign eliminated all 1,613 alerts of uncontrollable incidents &#x2014; 35% of the total 4,580 alerts.&quot;  Leaving 2,967 controllable tips of incidents.  Here&apos;s what they found:</p><ul>	<li><em>The 2 line had the most controllable significant incidents in 2011. The 2 line accounted for 251 out of 2,967, or 8% of all controllable significant incidents.</em></li><li><em>The 5 line came in a close second, with 247 controllable significant incidents. This was also 8% of all controllable significant incidents.</em></li><em>	<li>The G line had the fewest controllable significant incidents in 2011. The G line accounted for 45, or 2%, of all controllable significant incidents.</li>	<li>The most frequently occurring type of controllable significant incidents in 2011 was signal problems. This reason accounted for 36% of all controllable significant incidents.</li>	<li>Manhattan was the borough in 2011 with the most controllable significant incidents. The borough accounted for 43% (1,279 total) of all controllable significant incidents.</li>	</em><li><em>The Bronx was the borough in 2011 with the fewest controllable significant incidents. The borough accounted for 11% (333 total) of all controllable significant incidents.</em></li></ul>Cate Contino, coordinator for the Straphangers, said, &quot;Some riders will see this as a poor level of performance. Others may grudgingly view this amount of incidents as tolerable. Either way, 2011 will serve as a baseline for future years, showing whether significant incidents have gotten worse, better or stayed the same.&quot;  <p></p>

<p>The Straphangers Campaign also wants more information to find out: &quot;Is there a relationship between the number of significant incidents and the amount of service provided by line? Are there explanations for why signal and mechanical problems constitute more than two-thirds of all significant controllable incidents? Is there a relationship between the number of significant incidents and whether a line shares part of its right-of-way? Are the number of alerts increased on lines undergoing major rebuilding, due to related service problems?&quot; </p>
