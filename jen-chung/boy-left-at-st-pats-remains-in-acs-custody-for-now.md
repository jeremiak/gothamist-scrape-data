However, he will remain in the custody of the city&apos;s Administration for Children&apos;s Services as the authorities continue to investigate his situation, which includes two jailed parents.  A source <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422144526/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/04/24/2010-04-24_granny_finally_sees_abandoned_boy_3.html?r=ny_local&amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+nydnrss%2Fny_local+(NY+Local)&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader">told the Daily News</a>, &quot;There are all of these moving parts to unravel.&quot;  <p></p>

<p>Fons&apos; mother Erin Comeau had been arrested for using a counterfeit $100 bill in Florida, leaving Nathaniel to her friends&apos; care. It&apos;s believed that Eleanor Black and William Scott drove to New York (the couple once lived in Brooklyn) and that Black dumped him at the church. Nathaniel approached a guard, saying, &quot;Hi, my name is Nate,&quot; with a note in his pocket that had the number of a Florida detective and the words &quot;Call immediately.&quot;  </p>

<p>The NYPD is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422144526/http://gothamist.com/2010/04/23/boy_left_at_st_pats_will_see_his_gr.php">looking for Black and Scott</a>, who are also suspected of being part of the counterfeiting ring. Black&apos;s father, &quot;serving time for violating parole after spending most of his life in prison for the 1968 murder of an NYPD cop,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422144526/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/st_pat_plea_from_jailed_dad_vFKqCEN1VeVbXStta5jKdI?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">told the Post</a>, &quot;She should just surrender and tell them that she made a mistake.&quot;</p>

<p>Before Don and Frieda Fons saw their grandson, Frieda Fons told the News, &quot;We are very excited. We are hoping to come out with Nate.&quot;  But an ACS spokeswoman said, &quot;He will remain safely in the city&apos;s care for the time being. We have the responsibility of carefully assessing the safest placement for Nathaniel, and that may take some time.&quot; The Fonses&apos; son Bill <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150422144526/http://www2.tbo.com/content/2010/apr/21/212144/missing-jacksonville-boy-found-alone-st-patricks-c/">is in jail for violating</a> his parole when he failed to register as a sex offender.</p>
