<p>A relative of one of the smaller boat&apos;s passengers said, &quot;They were in a small craft docked, dropped anchor at the Statue of Liberty, and what had happened a larger watercraft, much larger, went through them and hit them.&quot;  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427153317/http://wcbstv.com/local/boat.accident.new.2.1786063.html">WCBS 2 reports</a>, &quot;A wake from a large speedboat may have caused the larger boat to collide with the victims&apos; vessel.&quot;  A U.S. Parks Police spokesman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427153317/http://www.myfoxny.com/dpp/news/local_news/serious-boating-accident-in-new-york-harbor-20100702-akd">told MyFoxNY</a>, &quot;It was apparent that one boat had actually overcome and rode up over another boat, and actually landed on that boat.&quot;</p>

<p>The most critically injured passenger had brain and head injuries and rescue crews were seen performing CPR on him; the 30-year-old was pronounced dead at Jersey City Medical Center hospital. The two other passengers had &quot;bumps and bruises&quot; and were able to walk onto a rescue boat on their own.  A JCMC doctor told NBC New York, &quot;Obviously there was some significant force that struck the [killed] individual and the other two didn&apos;t receive the same type of impact.&quot;</p>

<p>The driver of the 30-foot-boat boat, who was with a woman and his three children, was arrested after failing a Breathalyzer test. </p>
