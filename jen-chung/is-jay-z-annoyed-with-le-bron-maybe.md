[During the time that LeBron was making his decision] he didn&apos;t even take [Jay Z&apos;s] calls. It made [Jay Z] look like he couldn&apos;t deliver to the Nets management... If [Jay Z] would have landed a star player, he could have been seen as a legitimate asset to the team. Now they see him as just dead weight.&quot;  </p>

He knew that no 25-year-old kid with James&apos; profile was going to spend years in Newark. But he&apos;s pissed, or at least disappointed, that LeBron didn&apos;t consult with him.&quot;  </p>

<p>Jay-Z is an investor with the Nets, but he does play a public role by discussing the team when he&apos;s on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623151912/http://gothamist.com/2010/06/26/new_york_city_has_a_bad_case_of_leb.php">talk shows like the Late Show with David Letterman</a>.</p>
