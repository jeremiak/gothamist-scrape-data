The store&apos;s guard, Kenneth Meeks, 45, was arrested after the shooting and charged with assault, criminal possession of a weapon (firearm) and reckless endangerment while Gerald Spears, 23, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120523182150/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20120523/crown-heights/suspect-crown-heights-shooting-that-wounded-12-year-old-boy-nabbed">turned himself in last night</a>.  <p></p>

<p>Spears is reportedly being questioned and hasn&apos;t been charged, but according to the store&apos;s owner, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120523182150/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/22/pedestrian_killed_in_brooklyn_hit-a.php">surveillance video apparently shows</a> that Spears showed his gun to Meeks.  The father of the 12-year-old victim, Brian Harper, said that Spears fired at Meeks, so Meeks, who has over a dozen prior arrests, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120523182150/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/shoe-store-shoot-out-leaves-12-year-old-shot-article-1.1082858?localLinksEnabled=false"> took his own gun out and fired back</a>.  Owner Sang Han <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120523182150/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/shoe-store-shoot-out-leaves-12-year-old-shot-article-1.1082858?localLinksEnabled=false">told the News</a> that Spears, who has 18 prior arrests, &quot;He comes in 10 times a day. He&#x2019;s a young guy with a hot temper.&quot;</p>

<p>The boy, Julian Harper, who was injured was looking around with his father when the confrontation occurred. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120523182150/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/brooklyn_security_guard_charged_3rkHdI6ivl1ApTEy44HemI">Harper told the Post</a> he was there to buy his son sneakers, &quot;Before I knew it, I heard pow! pow! pow! It was the Wild West in there... I did my best to protect my son. I tried to act like a shield for him... I pulled my son close to my body and wrapped myself around him. We braced ourselves against a shoe display. And I held him tight and prayed that nothing hit us.&quot;  </p>

<p>It turned out that a bullet went through Harper&apos;s pant leg and into the boy: &quot;I told him not to look and that it was going to be OK.<strong> He didn&#x2019;t make a sound, but he was bleeding... He wasn&#x2019;t crying. He was being real brave.</strong>&quot;  And the other victim, Christopher Townsend, 34, said, &quot;I was just in there looking at shoes, hats and clothes. The bullets just rang out.&quot;  Apparently 31 shots were fired.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120523182150/http://www.facebook.com/soscrownheights">Save Our Streets Crown Heights held a rally</a> outside the store (though the store isn&apos;t in their catchment), reminding people, &quot;Talk to your family and neighbors about gun violence. Remember what we chanted at the response today, &apos;You save my child, I&apos;ll save yours! You watch my block, I&apos;ll watch yours.&apos;&quot;</p>
