										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="2015_11_debasiocity.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160307221439im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2015_11_debasiocity.jpg" width="640" height="426"> <br> <i> Mayor de Blasio in Queens yesterday (NYC Mayor&apos;s Office)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>After <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160307221439/http://chicagoist.com/2015/11/16/michigan_indiana_governors_say_they.php">27 governors announced</a> that they will refuse to accept Syrian refugees, the city&apos;s leaders are speaking up. Mayor Bill de Blasio said, &quot;We should not close our borders to any group of people fleeing the atrocities and horrors of terrorism. To do so is to hand terrorists a victory over our democracy, strengthened over the years by Americans who died or risked their lives for it.&quot;</p>

<p>He continued, &quot;We are a strong country. We can protect our country with the appropriate and intensive screening and accept refugees seeking our protection at the same time. New York City is a proud immigrant city, and we will not turn our back on that history or the people being persecuted and fleeing war.&quot;</p>

<p>The Mayor also commented on NJ Governor Chris Christie&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160307221439/http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2015/11/christie_to_obama_nj_wont_accept_syrian_refugees.html#incart_river_home">letter to President Obama</a>, explaining, &quot;The threat posed to New Jersey by ISIS is very real. I write to inform you that I will not accept any refugees from Syria in the wake of the deadly terrorist attack in Paris.&quot; De Blasio said, &quot;Because Chris Christie is an elected official, his comment is an embarrassment to this country. If he were in any other profession, it would be dismissed out of hand for the callous, heartless and prejudiced statement that it is.&quot;</p>

<p>The Star-Ledger points out, &quot;In September, Christie said &apos;the United States should play their role&apos; in taking in refugees. He repeated those statements until he did an about-face on accepting refugees in October when he appeared on Fox News with Sean Hannity.&quot;</p>

<p>De Blasio also got to say something about presidential candidate and real estate mogul Donald Trump&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160307221439/http://www.cnn.com/2015/11/16/politics/donald-trump-paris-attacks-close-mosques/">suggestion that mosques be shut down</a>; de Blasio pointed out, &quot;First and foremost, we always will abide by the U.S. Constitution which prohibits discrimination against religions. We will adhere to the words of our Founding Fathers, not Donald Trump. Mosques don&apos;t commit acts of terrorism. People do. NYPD will investigate the crime, not close down places of worship. Finally, NYPD is recognized today as having the top anti-terrorism unit in the world. Our anti-terrorism efforts continue to evolve and improve as we&apos;ve become more knowledgeable about activities across the globe.&quot;<br>
 <br>
Finally, he also released a statement about Muslims in NYC, &quot;Muslim New Yorkers are a crucial ally in the fight against terrorism. ISIS does not discriminate and has killed members of many races and religion. The Muslim community is as deeply concerned about terrorism as other communities are. NYPD investigates the crime, not a group of people. That will not change.&quot;<br>
 <br>
City Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160307221439/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/mark-viverito-opposition-letting-refugees-appalling-article-1.2437787?cid=bitly">called into the Brian Lehrer Show,</a> upset at the rhetoric, &#x201C;What we&#x2019;re seeing now at the national level is a very ugly discourse... I think that what we&#x2019;re seeing on behalf of these governors is really appalling and that we&apos;re much better than that as a country.&quot;</p>

<p>Anyway, it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160307221439/http://chicagoist.com/2015/11/17/despite_declarations_governors_have.php">might not be legal for governors to block refugees</a>.</p>
