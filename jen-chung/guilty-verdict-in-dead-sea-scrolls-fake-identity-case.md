										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2010_09_deadsea.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20140519004005im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2010_09_deadsea.jpg" width="206" height="170" class="image-left"> </span>One of the weirder cases involving<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140519004005/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/28/overzealous_defense_of_dads_dead_se.php"> paternal pride, ancient texts and the Internet</a> has concluded (well, until the appeal):  A NY lawyer was found guilty of dozens of charges, including  identity theft, criminal impersonation and aggravated harassment, for trying to defend his scholar-father&apos;s stance on who wrote the Dead Sea Scrolls.  Raphael Haim Golb was reortedly in &quot;shock&quot; over the verdict and his lawyer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140519004005/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/10/01/2010-10-01_dead_sea_troll_is_convicted_for_impersonating_nyu_prof.html">Ron Kuby criticized the jury&apos;s decision</a>, &quot;Today what happened was the district attorney of New York County and the trial court made hurting somebody&apos;s feelings a criminal act.<strong> In New York, hurting people&apos;s feelings or being annoying is not a crime. We call that Monday</strong>.&quot;</p>

<p>Well, it&apos;s possible the jury felt hat Golb&apos;s impersonation of NYU Professor Lawrence Schiffman crossed the line from &quot;hurting feelings&quot; to &quot;criminal impersonation&quot; when Golb, using an email address he created to pose as Schiffman, sent an email to NYU saying &quot;Schiffman&quot; plagiarized his work. Golb claimed that his email was meant as &quot;parody&quot; and that no professor would send an email to his university confessing plagiarism.  </p>

<p>As for the controversial disagreement about the DSS, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140519004005/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/01/nyregion/01scrolls.html?ref=nyregion">we turn to the NY Times</a>: </p><blockquote>The prevailing theory on the origin of the Dead Sea Scrolls, rebutted by Mr, Golb&#x2019;s father, is that they were written by a Jewish sect known as the Essenes who lived near the caves where the scrolls were found.<p></p>

<p>In a statement, Mr. Schiffman expressed regret that &#x201C;academic debate was replaced by cyber crime and identity theft as a means of advancing a particular scholarly point of view.&#x201D;</p>

<p>&#x201C;Let us hope,&#x201D; he added, &#x201C;that the field of Dead Sea Scrolls research can get back to its real business &#x2014; interpreting the ancient scrolls and explaining their significance for the history of Judaism and the background of early Christianity.&#x201D;</p></blockquote><br>
Golb could face up to four years in prison.<p></p>
