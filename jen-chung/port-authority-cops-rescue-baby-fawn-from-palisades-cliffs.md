<p>A baby deer that was stuck on a New Jersey cliff was rescued by a pair of Port Authority police officers who heard its cries. And there&apos;s video of Operation Fawn Freedom. </p>

<p>Around 10:30 a.m. on June 2, 2017, Port Authority police officers who were on duty on the George Washington Bridge walkway heard the fawn in distress on the Palisades Cliffs. The baby was separated from its mother and was stranded on a cliff face, according to PA spokesman Joseph Pentangelo. He added that PA Police Officer Andrew Vignapiano retrieved the deer while PA Police Officer Kevin Leonard secured the line from above. </p>
