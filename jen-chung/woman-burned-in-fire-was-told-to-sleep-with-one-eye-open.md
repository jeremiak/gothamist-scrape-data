										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:200px; "> <img alt="2010_09_bxfire.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150303210842im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2010_09_bxfire.jpg" width="200" height="144"> <br> <i>(MyFoxNY)</i></div> Yesterday morning, firefighters responded to a suspicious fire in a two-story house in the West Farms section of the Bronx which left eight people injured, including a 22 -year-old woman and her 2-year-old son who were found unconscious in a basement apartment.  Now it turns out the woman was being threatened by a former tenant, who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150303210842/http://www.wpix.com/news/wpix-eight-injured-in-bronx-fire,0,268199.story">allegedly sent a text message</a> saying the victim &quot;better sleep with one eye open.&quot;<p></p>

<p>Tenant Toshanda Staples and her son &quot;suffered severe burns,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150303210842/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/bronx/mom_and_tot_badly_burned_in_suspicious_wobIYJx0Hl1bPK8vbttJ8I?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">according to the Post</a> (a firefighter even said he &quot;thought they were dead&quot;).  The paper adds, &quot;Residents said Staples had gotten into a fistfight yesterday morning with a former tenant, who lost and promised revenge. &apos;<strong>She was sending text messages to people saying, you should sleep with one eye open</strong>,&apos; said Staples&apos; sister Amarie Rodriguez.&quot; And a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150303210842/http://www.wpix.com/news/wpix-eight-injured-in-bronx-fire,0,268199.story">resident told WPIX</a> that the fistfight started when Staples believed the other woman had shoved her son.</p>

<p>The FDNY is still investigating the cause of the fire.  The Department of Building <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150303210842/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/09/15/four-are-severely-hurt-in-bronx-fire/">issued violations to the homeowner</a> &quot;for work without a permit, illegal occupancy and illegal hardware.&quot; Apparently there were 14 single-room occupancy units (three in the basement).</p>
