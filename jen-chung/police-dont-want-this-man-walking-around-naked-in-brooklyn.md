<p>Police have released video of a man wanted for public lewdness in Brooklyn. The security camera video, captured last month, shows the man walking along a sidewalk completely naked.</p>

<p>Cops say they received a report at 6 a.m. on August 12th about a male &quot;seen naked walking on a public sidewalk in the vicinity of East 52 Street, between Avenue J and Avenue I&quot; in the Flatlands section of Brooklyn.<br>
 <br>
The suspect is described as being approximately 25-35 years old and 5&apos;6&quot;-5&apos;9&quot;.</p>

<p>On August 29th, at East 55th Street and Avenue I, a 23-year-old woman was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171015041657/http://gothamist.com/2016/08/30/naked_man_rape_brooklyn.php">nearly raped by a naked man</a> who threw her to the ground and groped her. The woman was able to get away, and her attacker reportedly said, &quot;Pray for me.&quot; </p>

<p>It&apos;s unclear if the two incidents are related, but they did occur blocks apart from each other.<br>
 <br>
Anyone with information in regards to this incident is asked to call the NYPD&apos;s Crime Stoppers Hotline at 800-577-TIPS or for Spanish 1-888-57-PISTA (74782)<br>
