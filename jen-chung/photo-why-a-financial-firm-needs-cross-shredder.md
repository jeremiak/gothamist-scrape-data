<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none" style=" width:640px; "> <img alt="2012_01_crossshred.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120224212145im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2012_01_crossshred.jpg" width="640" height="353"> <br> <i>Tien Mao/Gothamist</i></div> <p></p>

<p>Some office workers tossed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120224212145/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/07/paper_chase_canyon_of_heroes_big_me.php#photo-2">whole pieces of paper</a> out of their windows during the Giants&apos; ticker tape parade on Tuesday&#x2014;and some of those <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120224212145/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/08/good_job_social_security_numbers_th.php">papers included medical information with Social Security numbers</a>.  Other companies probably thought they were fine because they used shredded paper... but this photo shows that one firm probably needs a cross shredder, because this is clearly a stock call option.  Probably with enough digging and tape, you could put together the whole document!</p>
