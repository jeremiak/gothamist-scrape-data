<p>There&apos;s been a young topless woman walking around the East Village for the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503231536/http://evgrieve.com/2012/05/there-is-woman-who-has-been-walking.html">past few weeks</a> and, finally, she has spoken, confirming that she&apos;s baring her boobs to remind everyone that women have the right to go free-ranging in New York (so she&apos;s not just trying to avoid ghastly tan lines). NSFW photo below.</p>

<p>EV Grieve posted <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503231536/http://evgrieve.com/2012/05/there-is-woman-who-has-been-walking.html">photos</a> earlier today and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503231536/http://ny.racked.com/archives/2012/05/18/a_brief_conversation_with_a_topless_new_yorker_about_her_outfit.php">Racked got an interview</a> with the activist, Moira Johnston, who explained, &quot;I&apos;m going topless today. It&apos;s to raise awareness that&apos;s it&apos;s legal for woman to be topless anywhere a guy can be without a shirt since 1992 here in New York State.&quot; (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503231536/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/13/topless_woman_busted_by_cops_bares.php">Holly Van Voast</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503231536/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/28/video_going_topless_on_the_d_train.php">knows that</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503231536/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/19/video_topless_paparazzo_flashes_mat.php">firsthand</a>.)  Johnston continued, &quot;I&apos;ve been going topless for a couple weeks now,&quot; and said of the reaction, &quot;I get a lot of support. Well, there&apos;s mixed reactions, because people aren&apos;t used to seeing it in our culture yet.&quot;</p>

<p>And it seems she&apos;s been arrested&#x2014;and released by the cops&#x2014;too!</p>
