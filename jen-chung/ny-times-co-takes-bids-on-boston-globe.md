                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2009_06_bgbid.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130807090139im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2009_06_bgbid.jpg" width="145" height="98" class="image-right"> </span>After the Boston Globe&apos;s largest union <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130807090139/http://www.boston.com/business/ticker/2009/06/globes_largest_1.html">rejected a contract</a> on Monday, the Globe&apos;s owner, the New York Times Co., <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130807090139/http://www.boston.com/business/articles/2009/06/10/times_co_seeks_globe_bids/">is now seeking bids</a> for the newspaper.  According to the Globe, the Times Co. was interested in getting bids no matter how the Guild, which represents &quot;nearly 700 editorial, advertising, and business office staff,&quot; voted, but a potential bidder said, &quot;<strong>That doesn&apos;t mean they have said they are going to sell it. They&apos;ve just said they are willing to entertain bids. But it sure indicates an interest</strong>.&quot; In the meantime, because the Guild fell short of voting for the contract with concessions, the Times Co. will save $10 million by imposing a 23% pay cut.  Three other unions for the mailers, the pressmen, and the delivery truck drivers had agreed to concessions.  The Times Co. has projected it will lose $85 million with the Globe without cost savings.</p>
