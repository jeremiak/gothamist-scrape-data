There was hair-pulling and French fries-stealing.</p>

<p>Police say the incident on March 31st happened in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160308215654/http://www.nyc.gov/html/nypd/html/precincts/precinct_046.shtml">46th Precinct</a>: At 3:15 a.m., two 16-year-old girls were sitting on the train when a large group of teen girls  approached them.  The group &quot;began to taunt the victims and assault them. The group then took one of the victim&apos;s french fries and then pulled them, by the hair, off the train at the East 176 Street stop where the group removed one of the victim&apos;s cell phone.&quot;</p>

<p>While the victims refused medical attention, one of them did manage to take some video of the group (below). The victims also said they didn&apos;t know any of the girls in the group.
