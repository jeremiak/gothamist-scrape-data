If you&apos;re <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141016231836/http://www.forbes.com/profile/dmitry-rybolovlev/">Dmitry Rybolovlev</a>, that is.<p></p>

<p>The sale of former Citigroup head Sandy Weill&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141016231836/http://gothamist.com/2011/11/10/ex-citi_chair_lists_15_cpw_apartmen.php">sumptuous 15 Central Park West penthouse apartment</a>&#x2014;Weill said the proceeds would go to charity&#x2014;excited the real estate world and then reports that Rybolovlev, who made his fortune in fertilizer, purchased the apartment for equestrian college student daughter Ekaterina caused a frenzy, because the daughter&apos;s people put out a statement <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141016231836/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2076017/Ekaterina-Rybolovleva-22-buys-88m-New-York-apartment.html">explaining</a> the apartment would be used &quot;when visiting New York.&quot;  Now the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141016231836/http://www.observer.com/2011/12/help-rybovovlev-buys-8-35-15-cpw-apartment-for-daughters-security-detail/">Observer says a two-bedroom on the third floor</a>&#x2014;one without Central Park views, was purchased for &quot;her private security detail.&quot;</p>

<p>Some more details about what the help has to live in: &quot;There is a washer/dryer, a corner living room and a marble powder room. The five-fixture master bath includes a soaking tub, perfect for relaxing after a long day of babysitting russian heiresses. According to city records, the seller is Corbett Price, a healthcare executive who sits on the board of his alma mater, the Ohio State University. Mr. Price paid $4.99 million for his home back in January 2008, making him yet the latest seller in the building to double their money in only a few years.&quot;</p>

<p><b>Update</b>: Ryboloblev&apos;s spokesman tells us the Observer story is untrue: &quot;Neither Dmitry Rybolovlev, nor his daughter Ekaterina Rybolovleva, nor any companies connected to them have purchased apartment 3F at 15 Central Park West, New York City. The reports suggesting that they have are completely inaccurate. There have never been any plans or even any discussions about purchasing this apartment.&quot; The Observer, though, claims its sources say it is so. <br>
