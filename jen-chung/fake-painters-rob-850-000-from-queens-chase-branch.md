That sum is the most netted in any city heist this year, sources said.&quot;</p>

<p>Apparently a bank employee at the 96-19 101st Avenue Ozone Park branch let the fake painters in while other real employees were being let in.  The Post&apos;s source says the robbers &quot;forced the three employees at gunpoint down to the safe in the bank&apos;s basement and ordered them to open it up&quot; and then tied them up with duct tape. </p>

<p>Lately, most bank robberies have been suspects <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130426073700/http://gothamist.com/tags/bankrobbery">approaching tellers or customers at ATMs</a>.</p>
