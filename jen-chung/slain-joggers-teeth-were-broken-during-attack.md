<p>Investigators say that the woman w<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170325204133/http://gothamist.com/2016/08/04/jogger_queens_rape_murder.php">ho was raped and killed during her evening jog</a> in a Queens park was viciously beaten as well. &quot;Her teeth were broke. She was black and blue,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170325204133/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/queens/jogger-karina-vetrano-brutally-beaten-raped-article-1.2738297">a police source told the Daily News</a>. </p>

<p>Karina Vetrano, 30, went for her usual run at 5 p.m. in Howard Beach on Tuesday night, but her father grew anxious when she didn&apos;t return home or return any of his calls. Around 7 p.m., Philip Vetrano asked a neighbor and assistant NYPD chief for help and, after a search, police tracked his daughter&apos;s cellphone <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170325204133/http://gothamist.com/2016/08/03/missing_jogger_found_dead_in_howard.php">to Spring Creek Park, in a marshy expanse</a> near 161 Avenue and 78 Street. </p>

<p>Vetrano&apos;s father, who accompanied police during the search, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170325204133/http://gothamist.com/2016/08/04/jogger_queens_rape_murder.php">was the first to find her body</a>.</p>

She was beaten quite severely, which would suggest she put up a big fight,&quot; and sources told the NY Post, &quot;While [the killer] was strangling her, he pressed his hands so hard into her neck that later on when they found the body, police could see the outline of his hand in her neck&quot; and that she was found &quot;scratches and marks all over her body, which was in bad shape.&quot;</p>

<p>And the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170325204133/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/05/nyregion/grieving-and-hunting-for-an-evil-person-after-a-jogger-is-killed.html?_r=1">NY Times reports</a> that Vetrano&apos;s was &quot;clothing askew and her fists [were] still clutching the reeds she was dragged into.&quot;</p>

<p>Police spoke to Vetrano&apos;s ex-boyfriend, who she broke up with recently. He reportedly has an alibi and is not a suspect.</p>

<p>&quot;We plan to chop down just about every weed at that location until we are satisfied that we got all the evidence,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170325204133/http://nypost.com/2016/08/04/slain-jogger-fought-for-her-life-during-gruesome-attack/">Boyce emphasized</a>. Officers were seen using machetes as well as a tractor and lawn mower to clear the park.</p>

<p>Her <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170325204133/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/queens/jogger-karina-vetrano-brutally-beaten-raped-article-1.2738297">father was also spotted</a> at the crime scene yesterday.</p>

<p>Vetrano, who had a master&apos;s in speech pathology from St. John&apos;s and was working at Vetro Restaurant and Wine Bar, turned 30 last month. She usually jogged with her father, but his back prevented him from running on Tuesday night. He apparently told her to avoid the park; other residents have mentioned &quot;hobos&quot; living there. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170325204133/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/05/nyregion/grieving-and-hunting-for-an-evil-person-after-a-jogger-is-killed.html?_r=1">From the Times</a>:</p><blockquote>On Thursday, even hardened homeless people nearby expressed surprise that Ms. Vetrano would jog in the area. They described it as a remote place where screams could be drowned out by planes overhead.<p></p>

<p>Mohamed Yasseen, who lives under the Cross Bay Bridge, spoke about an encampment where perhaps a dozen homeless men lived and often drank. He said he would not dare venture there, for fear of being attacked.</p>

<p>&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t go back there,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t know who is back there.&#x201D;</p></blockquote><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170325204133/http://pix11.com/2016/08/05/wake-to-be-held-for-slain-queens-jogger-friday-nypd-antes-up-reward-for-possible-clues/">A neighbor told PIX 11</a>, &quot;I hope they catch the guy, you gotta hang him.&quot;<p></p>

<p>A wake for Vetrano is being held today at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170325204133/http://jamesromanellistephen.com/book-of-memories/2667792/Vetrano-Karina%20Anne/service-details.php">James Romanelli-Stephen Funeral Home</a>. A funeral is being held tomorrow at St. Helen Church.<br>
