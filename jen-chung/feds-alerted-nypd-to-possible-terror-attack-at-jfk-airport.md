<p>The federal authorities have been looking into a threat that mentioned attacks at Los Angeles&apos; airport as well as NYC&apos;s JFK Airport. And naturally authorities are on high alert for possible threats, given that it&apos;s the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426134311/http://gothamist.com/2013/09/11/nyc_commemorates_12th_anniversary_o.php">12th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks</a>. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426134311/http://abcnews.go.com/US/terror-threats-mar-911-anniversary/story?id=20224581">ABC News reports</a>, &quot;In the hours leading up to the twelfth anniversary of the 9/11 attacks, federal authorities repeatedly said they had found no specific, credible threats to the U.S. homeland. But that doesn&apos;t mean they haven&apos;t been busy chasing down specific threats with&#x2014;at best&#x2014;questionable credibility.&quot;</p>

<p>A man apparently told the FBI and Department of Homeland Security that al Qaeda was planning an attack. He claimed &quot;three Columbia University students have already been recruited to wear explosives-laden suicide vests and detonate them at the New York airport, according to the notice. The bombing in New York would be followed by a second attack involving men posing as New York City taxicab drivers, the alert said the man told authorities.&quot;</p>

<p>The feds are &quot;highly suspect&quot; about the informant, noting that he said he could divulge more information if he was paid. ABC News adds, &quot;However, because his information was so specific, the FBI and DHS passed it along out of an abundance of caution, sources said.&quot; The FBI said, &quot;The FBI and our Joint Terrorism Task Force receive hundreds of threats daily, and we work around the clock with our partners to protect this city and nation. We remain on a heightened state of alert, but stress that there is no specific or credible threat at this time.&quot;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426134311/http://laist.com/2013/09/11/former_tsa_screener_arrested_after_1.php">TSA screener at LAX was arrested</a> for making threats citing the 9/11 anniversary. </p>
