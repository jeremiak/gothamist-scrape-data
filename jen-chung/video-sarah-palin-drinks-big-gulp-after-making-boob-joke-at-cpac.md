<p>Yesterday, American patriot Sarah Palin appeared at CPAC, the annual conservative pow-wow (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604123603/http://dcist.com/2013/03/fashion_recommendations_for_cpac_ye.php">no leggings or dressy shorts, please</a>). And, as expected, she brought down the house with her folksy blend of &apos;Obama is terrible, Obama probably isn&apos;t American, and Obama is a liar.&apos; But don&apos;t worry: she also made sure to mock Mayor Bloomberg.</p>

<p>Last week, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604123603/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/12/sarah_palin_revels_in_big_sodas_vic.php">Palin welcomed news</a> that Bloomberg&apos;s attempt to ban the sale of sugary drinks over 16 ounces (at certain establishments) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604123603/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/11/judge_stops_bloombergs_soda_ban.php">had been blocked</a>. So at CPAC, she paused to reveal a Big Gulp from the lectern and drank from it, &quot;Bloomberg is not around, our Big Gulps are safe. We&apos;re cool. Shoot, it&#x2019;s just pop with low-cal ice-cubes in it.&quot;</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="2013_03_spalinbg2.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604123603im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2013_03_spalinbg2.jpg" width="640" height="426"> <br> <i> Sarah Palin drinks &quot;pop&quot; at CPAC (Getty Images)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>And right before the Big Gulp moment, she discussed gun ownership, &quot;You should have seen what Todd got me for Christmas. Well, it wasn&#x2019;t that exciting. It was a metal rack, case for hunting rifles to put on the back of a four-wheeler. Then though, I had to get something for him to put in the gun case, right. So, this go around, he&#x2019;s got the rifle, I got the rack.&quot; Watch the boob-and-pop moments here: </p>

<p>Of course, the weird thing of Bloomberg&apos;s soda ban is that Big Gulps and 7-Eleven <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604123603/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/13/snap_nanny_bloombergs_soda_ban_coul.php">would have been exempt</a> from the ban. But why should Palin know anything about policy? Anyway, Bloomberg is actually pretty libertarian about the soda stuff&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130604123603/http://gothamist.com/2012/07/09/bloomberg_on_anti-soda_ban_sentimen.php">last year he said</a>, &quot;If you want to kill yourself, I guess you have a right to do it.&quot;</p>
