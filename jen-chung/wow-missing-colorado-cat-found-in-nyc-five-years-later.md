<p>The <em>feline</em> good story of the week: Willow, a cat that went missing from a Boulder, Colorado family, was found on the mean streets of New York&#x2014;five years after her disappearance!  One of her humans, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110915200416/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/missing_years_colo_cat_is_found_IO6bKF0KOQrH44MaLiPhoI">Jamie Squires, told the Post</a>, &quot;To be honest, there are tons of coyotes around here, and owls. She was just a little thing, five and a half pounds. We put out the &apos;Lost Cat&apos; posters and the Craigslist thing, but we actually thought she&apos;d been eaten by coyotes.&quot;  But, luckily, they microchipped her!</p>

<p>Animal Care &amp; Control called the Squireses after a man found Willow on East 20th Street and brought her to a shelter. When the staff checked to see if the calico cat was microchipped, they got the family&apos;s information. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110915200416/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2011/09/14/2011-09-14_willow_the_cat_goes_missing_in_colorado_turns_up_in_manhattan_five_years_later.html">Jamie Squires said</a>, &quot;When we first heard the voicemail, we couldn&apos;t believe it. My husband and I didn&apos;t want to tell the kids until we knew it was definitely her. They emailed the photo and it was her. The kids are so excited.&quot;</p>

<p>The family says that Willow went missing during a home renovation project, and it&apos;s unclear how Willow made it to NYC.  ACC is touting the importance of microchipping your pets (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110915200416/http://gothamist.com/2010/08/09/heres_why_you_should_microchip_your.php#photo-1">yes, do it!!!</a>) and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110915200416/http://www.dnainfo.com/20110914/murray-hill-gramercy/missing-cat-turns-up-manhattan-five-years-after-vanishing-colorado">Jamie Squires said</a>, &quot;It just makes sense. If I could, I would microchip my children.&quot;</p>

<p>ACC is working on getting Willow back to Colorado; in the meantime, she is staying with a foster family.  Awww.</p>
