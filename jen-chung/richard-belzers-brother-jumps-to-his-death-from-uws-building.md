<p>This morning, a man identified as the brother of actor Richard Belzer was found dead in an Upper West Side building courtyard. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510015250/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brother-actor-richard-belzer-jumps-death-manhattan-building-article-1.1885264">Daily News reports</a>, &quot;Belzer&#x2019;s body was found at 6:45 a.m. in the courtyard of 250 W. 94th St., cops said. Visibly shaken building workers said they believe Belzer &#x2014; who lived on the 11th floor &#x2014; jumped from the roof of the 15-story high-rise called The Stanton.&quot;</p>

<p>Leonard Belzer was 73, and a building worker told the News, &quot;I&apos;m surprised. It&apos;s very sad,&quot; but added, &quot;He was sick. He had health issues,&quot; while another worker said, &quot;[He] had issues with his heart... I had to put him on a bus to the hospital a couple of times&quot; and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510015250/http://nypost.com/2014/07/30/older-brother-of-law-order-actor-jumped-to-his-death/">a third told the Post</a> that he had stomach problems.</p>

<p>Belzer was also bereft after his wife, Emily Squires, the first female director for Sesame Street, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510015250/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/27/arts/television/emily-squires-sesame-street-director-and-producer-dies-at-71.html?_r=0">died in 2012</a>. He and Squires wrote a book called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510015250/http://www.amazon.com/Spiritual-Places-Around-York-City/dp/1931044031">Spiritual Places In And Around New York City</a>.</p>

<p>He once hosted a radio program called the Comedy Hour. Here&apos;s an interview he did with Bill Hicks:</p>
