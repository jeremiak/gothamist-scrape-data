Glenmark said the pills were distributed between Sept. 21 and Dec. 30. The ingredients of the pills are norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol.... A month&apos;s supply of birth control pills contains three different medications that are each taken one a day for a week, and a week&apos;s worth of inert pills. If the pills are taken out of order, they may not work, which could result in an unwanted pregnancy. Glenmark&apos;s pills were intended to be taken in this order: seven off-white tablets, seven light blue tablets and seven blue tablets, followed by a week of green placebo pills (pictured above). When taken properly, birth control pills are nearly 100 percent effective.&quot;</p>
