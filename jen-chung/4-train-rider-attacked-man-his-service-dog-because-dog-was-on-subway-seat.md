<p>A 30-year-old man and his service dog were both punched on a 4 train yesterday afternoon. The assailant, Herman Williams, was apparently upset that the dog was sitting on a subway seat.</p>

<p>A police spokesman said that Williams approached the man and asked him to move his dog and when the man didn&apos;t move his dog &quot;enough,&quot; Williams struck the dog in the head. Then the dog&apos;s owner stood up, and Williams allegedly punched him in the mouth. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160428000651/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/exclusive-subway-psycho-punched-dog-owner-cops-article-1.2452670">The Daily News reports</a> that three of the victim&apos;s teeth were knocked out.</p>

<p>Williams was arrested at the 161st Street-River Avenue stop and charged with assault, menacing and harassment, plus unlawful possession of marijuana (he was apparently found with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160428000651/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/exclusive-subway-psycho-punched-dog-owner-cops-article-1.2452670">four small bags of marijuana and two marijuana cigarettes</a>&quot;). </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160428000651/http://web.mta.info/nyct/rules/rules.htm">According to the MTA</a>, service animals are allowed on the subway, but &quot;&apos;Service animal&apos; means a guide dog, signal dog, or other animal individually trained to perform tasks for the benefit of a person with a disability that such person is unable to perform due to such disability, such as guiding persons with impaired vision, alerting persons with impaired hearing to sounds, pulling a wheelchair, retrieving dropped items or providing rescue assistance. The term service animal does not include a therapy animal or animal used for emotional support.&quot;</p>
