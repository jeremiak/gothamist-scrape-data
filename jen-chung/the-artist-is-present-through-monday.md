</div></div>					<p>Marina Abramovi&#x107;&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502152426/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/15/marina.php">performance art retrospective</a> at the Museum of Modern Art closes on Memorial Day, which means if you&apos;ve been wanting to sit across from her, you&apos;ll have to go today, tomorrow or Monday.  We wonder if <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502152426/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/11/marina_2.php">superfan Paco Blancas</a> will be there for a final good-bye.  </p>

<p>Just hope that there aren&apos;t too many VIPs (past celebs include <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502152426/http://www.flickr.com/photos/themuseumofmodernart/4604428513/">Alan Rickman</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502152426/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/10/franco_3.php">James Franco</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502152426/http://www.flickr.com/photos/themuseumofmodernart/4638676053/in/set-72157623741486824/">Kim Cattrall</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502152426/http://www.flickr.com/photos/themuseumofmodernart/4621916382/">Bjork</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502152426/http://www.flickr.com/photos/themuseumofmodernart/4621301845/in/set-72157623741486824/">Matthew Barney</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502152426/http://www.flickr.com/photos/themuseumofmodernart/4479611106/">Lou Reed</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502152426/http://www.flickr.com/photos/themuseumofmodernart/4639413452/">Marisa Tomei</a>) vying to sit down, because the famous have been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150502152426/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/13/the_artist_is_present_for_vips.php">whisked to the head line of the line in the past</a>.
