<p>The saga of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022065911/http://gothamist.com/2016/01/17/pro_tip_dont_buy_fake_hamilton_tick.php">fake <em>Hamilton</em> tickets</a> that bitterly disappointed would-be theatergoers has resulted in an indictment: Manhattan District Attorney Cy Vance announced that a 32-year-old man has been officially charged with numerous crimes, including ten counts of criminal possession of a forged instrument. Vance said, &quot;Scammers pick the hottest tickets in town in order to trap unwitting victims. As a Grammy- and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022065911/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/18/lin-manuel_miranda_wins_pulitzer.php">Pulitzer-winning</a> musical that is sold out through January 2017, <em>Hamilton</em> fits the bill.&quot;</p>

<p>According to the Manhattan DA&apos;s office, Anthony Huger, 32, advertised the fake tickets on Craigslist and sold or tried to sell them on three occasions; in one instance, a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022065911/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/28/woman_sets_up_craigslist_sting_afte.php">victim set up a sting</a>. From a press release:</p><blockquote>On January 8, 2016, a husband and wife from Westchester County contacted the defendant through his Craigslist ad, and agreed to meet him the next day at the corner of West 79th Street and Broadway in order to purchase three tickets for Hamilton for $450. The victims only discovered that the tickets were forged when they were denied entrance to the Richard Rodgers Theatre, where Hamilton is currently playing.<br>
 <br>
Similarly, on February 12, 2016, a Manhattan resident responded to HUGER&#x2019;s Craigslist ad, and agreed to meet him at the corner of West 100th Street and Broadway in order to purchase two Hamilton tickets for $300. After the victim paid the defendant in cash, the victim&#x2019;s wife suspected the tickets may have been forged, and contacted officers in the NYPD&#x2019;s 17th Precinct. Working with the officers, the victim&#x2019;s wife contacted HUGER, and arranged to meet in person to purchase four additional tickets. Officers observed the defendant attempt to sell her forged tickets, and placed the defendant under arrest. Two additional forged tickets were found on the defendant&#x2019;s person.</blockquote>Huger, who is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171022065911/http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/theater-arts/city-parolee-caught-selling-fake-tickets-hamilton-article-1.2607339">currently on parole</a>, pleaded not guilty to the charges.<p></p>

<p>Vance added, &quot;I urge theatergoers only to purchase tickets through authorized vendors, and to beware of deals that seem too good to be true. We will continue to work hand-in-hand with our partners in the NYPD to combat these opportunistic scammers.&quot; </p>

<p>Let&apos;s put all this behind us and just enjoy <em>Hamilton</em> creator Lin-Manuel Miranda&apos;s reaction to getting a Tweet from Weird Al:</p>
