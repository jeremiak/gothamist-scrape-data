<p>Police are investigating the killing of a 23-year-old man on a Queens sidewalk yesterday afternoon. </p>

<p>Authorities say that officers responded to a 911 call about a man who was stabbed outside of  43-28 Judge Street in Elmhurst at 12:18 p.m. and, when they arrived, they were told that the victim, Jan Carlos Salcedo had been stabbed in the torso and taken to Elmhurst Hospital by private means. </p>

<p>Salceo, who lived in the Bronx, died at the hospital. <br>

<p>A man visiting family who lives on the same street <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016015710/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/man-fatally-stabbed-queens-home-thanksgiving-afternoon-article-1.2886503">told the Daily News</a>, &quot;I just saw somebody put a guy in a car, and he left. I didn&apos;t know what happened. This is a really quiet neighborhood. This is really unexpected.&quot;</p>

<p>The suspects fled, apparently dropping a knife by a car near the intersection Ithaca Street and Elmhurst Avenue.</p>

<p>Salcedo&apos;s brother also spoke to the News, &quot;He was a really nice person, he didn&apos;t deserve that. Everything is new to us right now, I don&apos;t know anything because I was at work when it happened. I found out during work and I just came out.&quot;</p>
