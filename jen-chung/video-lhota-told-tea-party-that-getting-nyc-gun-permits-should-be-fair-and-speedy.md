<p>Earlier this year, Republican mayoral candidate Joe Lhota <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131011002651/http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2013/04/post_495.html">told members of the Staten Island Tea Party</a> that New Yorkers should be able to get gun permits in a &quot;fair and speedy&quot; manner. But the issue has picked up more traction because of the Tea Party&apos;s government shutdown antics&#x2014;and because a newly-obtained video shows that Lhota is kind of a liar.</p>

<p>On October 1st, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131011002651/http://www.ny1.com/content/news/190088/lhota-appears-sympathetic-to-some-tea-party-positions-in-video">NY1 reports</a> that Lhota characterized his April meeting with the Tea Party members as involving a &quot;huge, verbally violent discussion of gun control and what it means to New York City.&quot; However, one of the Tea Party members gave NY1 a video of the meeting, which shows Lhota telling them, &quot;The city of New York, though, goes to an extreme with their, bureaucracy is not even strong enough of a word, it&apos;s almost a level of harassment at a certain point, and it needs to change. There&apos;s something that should be fair and speedy about being able to get a gun permit.&quot;</p>

<p>SITP co-founder Frank Santarpia <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131011002651/http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2013/10/de_blasio_and_lhota_spar_over.html">told the Staten Island Advance</a>, &quot;It was friendly banter back and forth.&quot; Santarpia also understands that Lhota is trying to beat Bill &apos;Pinko Commie Sandinista&apos; de Blasio but is &quot;disappointed [Lhota] found the need to triangulate on the back&quot; of the SITP.</p>

<p>For his part, Lhota claimed that he was telling the SITP that the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131011002651/http://politicker.com/2013/10/joe-lhota-defends-fair-and-speedy-gun-permit-remark/"> gun permit renewal process needed to be speedy</a>, &#x201C;The question was about being able to get a new permit. You know, you need to have one every year-these are people who legally have guns who have shown that they have a need for it. What&#x2019;s gone on is, those people who legitimately need it, it&#x2019;s getting harder and harder and harder for getting the renewal license, which is required and should be required once a year.&quot;</p>
