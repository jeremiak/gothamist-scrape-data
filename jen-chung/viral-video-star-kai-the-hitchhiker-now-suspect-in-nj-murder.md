<p>Earlier this year, a bushy-haired hitchhiker named Kai become an online sensation after video emerged of him explaining he stopped a man from attacking a couple by hitting him with a hatchet. Now Kai McGillvary is wanted for the murder of a New Jersey man.</p>

<p>Union County authorities say that McGillvary is suspected of killing 73-year-old attorney Joseph Galfy Jr., who was found dead in his Clark, NJ home on May 13. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131217214301/http://www.nj.com/union/index.ssf/2013/05/drifter_internet_figure_sought.html#incart_river_default">Star-Ledger reports</a> that McGillvary, 24, &quot;cut his hair in an attempt to alter his appearance [and] was last seen at a light rail station in the Haddonfield area.&quot; He is also considered armed and dangerous.</p>

<p>It&apos;s unclear how Union County authorities came to suspect McGillvary, an itinerant drifter. Here&apos;s the video that launched McGillvary to Internet stardom:</p>

<p>McGillvary is already charged with murder and has bail set at $3 million even though he hasn&apos;t been located. There&apos;s a $5,000 reward for information that leads to his arrest.</p>
