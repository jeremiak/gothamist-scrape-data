He also told her that to save his career, she should check into a mental hospital and say she was crazy or go to jail for lying about the abuse.&quot; He also allegedly yelled, &quot;<strong>It&apos;s over, it&apos;s over, you should hang yourself</strong>,&quot; and &quot;hit his wife&apos;s hand several times with a copy of The Journal News with a story about his criminal case.&quot; </p>
