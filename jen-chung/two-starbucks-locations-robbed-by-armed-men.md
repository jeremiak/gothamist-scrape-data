The first robbery was at Broadway and West 98h Street on August 29 at 5:30 a.m., while the second was on Third Avenue at 41st around 8 p.m. this past Sunday.  &quot;In both cases, the men walked in, pulled out guns, tied up the employees who were in the store, and then hit the cash registers and safes, police said.&quot;    Understandably, employees at the Third Avenue location didn&apos;t want to talk about the incident.</p>
