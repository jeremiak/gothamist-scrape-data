<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130909210925/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/mega-millions-jackpot-winnings-york-total-a-million-article-1.1053866?localLinksEnabled=false">One hundred forty-two people</a> (not <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130909210925/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/31/17_second-place_mega_millions_ticke.php">100 as previously noted</a>) had lottery tickets that were one number away <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130909210925/http://gothamist.com/2012/03/31/sorry_ny_mega_millions_winning_tick.php">from the winning combination</a>. So a little crying over Lady Luck is to be expected, right?</p>

<p>Queens restaurant owner Diancai Zhou <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130909210925/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/doh_PHXuZbzsngv0meaMGScdNJ">told the Post</a>, &#x201C;<strong>Arrrrrrghh! That could have been $640 million if only I had that one number!</strong>&#x201D; He, his employees at Fuji, and friends had pooled together for tickets, so now they will split $250,000.  Another one of the group&apos;s almost winners, Ivy Song, said, &quot;I feel lucky and unfortunate at the same time... Why couldn&#x2019;t I get that number? I&#x2019;d travel the world and I wouldn&#x2019;t have to think about money ever again. But this money will help me a lot. I&#x2019;m going to splurge on my children.&quot;</p>

<p>There were 16 other second-place winners in NY State.  One deli owner in Borough Park who sold one of them <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130909210925/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/mega-millions-jackpot-winnings-york-total-a-million-article-1.1053866">told the Daily News</a>, &quot;This is great news. We&#x2019;re a lucky place now and this will be good for business.&quot;</p>

<p>For everyone else whose tickets are just taking up space in your wallet or purse, the Post has this handy rundown of what tickets are worth:</p><blockquote>* Five numbers, not Mega Ball, but multiplier: 3 prizes of $1 million<br>
* Five numbers, but not the Mega Ball: 1581 prizes of $250,000<br>
* Four numbers and the Mega Ball: 897 prizes of $10,000<br>
* Four numbers but not the Mega Ball: 40,423 prizes of $150<br>
* Three numbers and the Mega Ball: 46,887 prizes of $150<br>
* Two numbers and the Mega Ball: 780,589 prizes of $10<br>
* Three numbers but not the Mega Ball: 2,086,571 prizes of $7<br>
* One number and the Mega Ball: 4,669,851 prizes of $3<br>
* Just the Mega Ball: 8,727,236 prizes of $2</blockquote>The three winning tickets were sold in Kansas, Maryland and Illinois.  The winners have not come forward yet, probably because they are consulting lawyers (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130909210925/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/11/206_million_lottery_winner_has_come.php">it&apos;s serious business</a>, winning millions and millions).<p></p>
