But our embedded reporters noticed that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150818075001/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/07/paper_chase_canyon_of_heroes_big_me.php#photo-2">whole pieces of paper were thrown out of windows</a>, instead of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150818075001/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/06/city_prepares_for_ticker-tape_mess-.php">locally-sourced confetti</a> or shredded paper&#x2014;in fact, in some instances, it seemed like someone opened up a new ream of paper and threw a stack of sheets out.  Now, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150818075001/http://insideedition.com/">Inside Edition</a> has discovered that at least some office workers were throwing papers with people&apos;s personal information&#x2014;like SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS&#x2014;out during the revelry!</p>

<p>In a segment that airs today at noon (channel 5, MyFoxNY), Inside Edition&apos;s Paul Boyd dug through some of the celebratory detritus with a former FBI investigator, &quot;Sensitive documents were being thrown out of windows&#x2014;information regarding people&#x2019;s medical records and social security numbers, and even information about a 54-year-old woman&#x2019;s mammogram, all with specific details you probably wouldn&#x2019;t want aired in public.&quot;</p>

<p>Offices: GET SHREDDERS.</p>
