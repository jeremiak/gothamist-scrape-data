<p>The recent implosion of ousted Fox News chief Roger Ailes will become fodder for a TV mini-series. And the producer is the same one as <em>The Purge</em> movies, because let&apos;s face it, for many women at Fox News, Ailes&apos;s reign was a real-life horror story. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161023044109/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/20/business/media/ex-fox-chairman-roger-ailes-to-be-subject-of-tv-mini-series.html?smid=tw-share">According to the NY Times</a>, Tom McCarthy, who directed and co-wrote the Oscar-winning film, <em> Spotlight</em>, will be an executive producer while Jason Blum, known for horror movies like &apos;The Purge,&apos; will produce. Blum also had a hand in HBO&#x2019;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161023044109/http://gothamist.com/2015/03/16/watch_robert_durst_confess_that_he.php">Emmy Award-winning &#x201C;The Jinx,&#x201D;</a> about allegedly murderous real estate scion Robert Durst.  </p>

<p>Gabriel Sherman, the <em>New York</em> magazine journalist whose years of reporting on Ailes allegedly drove the executive to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161023044109/http://money.cnn.com/2016/08/26/media/gabriel-sherman-fox-news-opposition-research/">scheme on how to get back at him</a>, is also part of the project. </p>

<p>&quot;[Blum&apos;s production company] Blumhouse did not say whether a TV network had agreed to license the series, nor did it give a time frame for when the series might become available,&quot; Variety reports.</p>

<p>Ailes was accused of sexually harassing female Fox News employees in a series of damning allegations resulting from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161023044109/http://gothamist.com/2016/09/02/gretchen_carlson_ailes_update.php">Gretchen Carlson&apos;s lawsuit</a> against him. Carlson, who claimed she was unfairly fired as well, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161023044109/http://gothamist.com/2016/09/06/fox_news_gretchen_carlson_20.php">settled with Fox News for $20 million</a>. Ailes has insisted he is innocent and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161023044109/http://gothamist.com/2016/07/21/roger_ailes_officially_forced_out_o.php">received $60 million</a> from Fox News for his exit.</p>
