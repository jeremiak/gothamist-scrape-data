He said his probe found &quot;substantial evidence of improprieties and possible fraud by the financial architects of the new Yankees Stadium.&quot; Last week, the Daily News&apos; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111117122411/http://www.nydailynews.com/money/2008/09/11/2008-09-11_yanks_land_deal_aint_fair_ball.html">Juan Gonzalez had a column</a> noting the city&apos;s assessment of the land <strong>worked out to be $275/square foot -- but city assessors previously valued it at $25/square foot</strong>.  The IRS noted the different valuations ($40 million vs. $204 million) and may investigate further.  And speaking of new Yankee Stadium, WCBS 880 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111117122411/http://www.wcbs880.com/Sneak-Peek-Inside-New-Yankee-Stadium-PHOTOS/2992266">went on a tour and took some photos</a>.</p>
