                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="2013_06_weinercongress.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130813081428im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2013_06_weinercongress.jpg" width="640" height="436"> <br> <i> Weiner in 2009 (Getty Images)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>So the NY Times still hasn&apos;t posted its &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130813081428/http://observer.com/2013/06/the-new-york-times-inadvertently-posts-a-weiner-sexting-story-online/">sexting partners of Anthony Weiner</a>&quot; story, but the apparent &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130813081428/http://gothamist.com/tags/anthonyweiner">Anthony Weiner is a jerk</a>&quot; narrative still gets ink with a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130813081428/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/13/nyregion/weiners-record-in-house-intensity-publicity-and-limited-results.html?ref=nyregion&amp;pagewanted=all">long, front-page article about Weiner&apos;s history in Congress</a>: &quot;In 12 &#xBD; years in Congress, he sponsored and wrote only one bill that he steered to enactment: a measure pushed by a family friend who gave his campaigns tens of thousands of dollars in donations.&quot;</p>

<p>There&apos;s also his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130813081428/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/23/nyregion/23weiner.html?_r=0">&quot;petulant&quot;</a> behavior as a boss:</p><blockquote>He sometimes asked aides to call air-traffic control to see if his plane could be moved up in the departure order.<p></p>

<p>In a car, he was difficult. Mr. Weiner would take the front passenger seat, argue over directions and insist on making every yellow light, pointing to the car ahead and declaring: &#x201C;If he makes it, you make it.&#x201D;</p>

<p>His staff had the highest turnover in the New York City delegation, and some aides complained about his behavior. In 2005, he became so irritated with a staff member that he threw a salad against the wall, then left the room as the dressing slowly dripped, leaving a stain. Another time, arguing with an aide, Mr. Weiner threw his BlackBerry against a wall, then blamed the aide for the broken phone.</p>

<p>&#x201C;It was like &#x2018;The Devil Wears Prada,&#x2019; &#x201D; recalled Stacey E. Fitzpatrick, a lawyer in Seattle who worked for Mr. Weiner on the City Council.</p></blockquote>While he does get credit for some things, like getting the Army Corps of Engineers to repair beach erosion on the Belt Parkway and getting Newtown Creek declared a Superfund site (it was an &quot;impulsive&quot; suggestion), many of his Congressional colleagues kinda hated him because he would only participate in events if he could bask in the spotlight. Former Rep. Zachary Space (D-Ohio) told the Times, &quot;It was like he had a megaphone surgically attached to his mouth. His unwillingness to be a team player did compromise his ability to be an effective congressman. I don&#x2019;t care if you&#x2019;re a congressman, or president, or mayor or a city councilman &#x2014; you can&#x2019;t do it yourself.&quot;<p></p>

<p>Weiner has previously said, &quot;I make no apologies for the idea that I am a hard-driving, aggressive problem solver for people. I think the overwhelming number of city workers have that same spirit.&quot; Well, he apparently thinks he&apos;ll be able to force someone (probably City Council Speaker Christine Quinn) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130813081428/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/weiner_to_uft_runoff_with_me_xQdOCJtZOGNCu4kTsi7HEP?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Local">into a runoff</a>.<br>
