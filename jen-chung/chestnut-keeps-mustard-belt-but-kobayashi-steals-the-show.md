</div></div>					<p>There are a few more details about the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170923153234/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/04/tsunami_strikes_kobayashi_arrested.php">strange arrest of competitive eater Takeru Kobayashi</a> after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170923153234/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/04/nathans_hot_dog_eating_contest_is_o.php">Nathan&apos;s Famous Hot Dog Eating Contest</a>.  Kobayashi, who claimed he was not participating in the event he won six times because of a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170923153234/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/01/kobayashi_contest_organizers_are_tr.php">dispute with Major League Eating organizers</a> (hence the &quot;Free Kobi&quot; shirt), had been watching the event from the crowd.  Apparently the crowd&apos;s chanting of his name inspired him to rush the stage; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170923153234/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/kobayashi_released_from_jail_yxYXa2udq2emvq7y3ME3aO?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">he said</a>, &quot;I went as a spectator to cheer on my buddies that I used to eat with. Everyone in the crowd kep chanting &apos;let him eat, let him eat&apos;. So I jumped onto the stage to prove that I am still the champ, but I was arrested.&quot; </p>

<p>His lawyer claims that a Nathan&apos;s rep gestured for him to come onto the stage.  Only he was arrested for obstruction of governmental administration; resisting arrest; trespassing and disorderly conduct. A judge freed the 32-year-old who pleaded not guilty to charges. Staying on message, Kobayashi said, &quot;I am very hungry. I wish there were hot dogs in jail.&quot;</p>

<p> One spectator <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170923153234/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/07/04/2010-07-04_joey_jaws_chestnut_wins_nathans_july_fourth_hot_dog_eating_contest.html">told the Daily News</a>, &quot;He&apos;s trying to upstage Joey,&quot; referring the the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170923153234/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/04/nathans_hot_dog_eating_contest_is_o.php">four-time champion Joey Chestnut</a>. &quot;He should have just competed and signed the contract.&quot; The <a href="" http:="" www.nypost.com="" p="" news="" local="" brooklyn="" kobayashi_arrested_as_chestnut_nabs_gjrysmpkzynakhvd2agmwo?cmp="OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=&quot;">Post&apos;s witnesses were split</a>, with one thinking, &quot;I thought he was going to congratulate Chestnut as he was lifting up his belt,&quot; but another said, &quot;For all I know, he was going up there to punch him out.&quot;  Punch Chestnut out for eating 14 less hot dogs than <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170923153234/http://gothamist.com/2009/07/04/joey_chestnut_retains_mustard_belt.php">he did last year</a>?  </p>

<p>George Shea, MLE chairman, said, &quot;It was extremely unfortunate and a little bizarre. It makes you think about his thought process. It was not appropriate.&quot; However, Kobayashi&apos;s manager insisted, &quot;He just wanted a chance to eat and break the record and prove that he was the real champion. Unfortunately, he was unable to reach an agreement with the organizers.&quot;  While we&apos;re not sure if Kobayashi would have bested Chestnut, we do think it would have been a more exciting contest.  </p>

<p>For his part, Chestnut claims he was dehydrated, which impaired his performance, &quot;It&#x2019;s all right. I beat the competition. If anyone else was here, I would have beaten them too.&quot; And before he knew of his archrival&apos;s arrest, Chestnut said of Kobayashi, &quot;If he was real man, he&#x2019;d be on the stage. There was no reason for him not to be here.&quot;</p>
