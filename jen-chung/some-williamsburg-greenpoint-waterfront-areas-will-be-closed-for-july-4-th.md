<p>Do you live in Williamsburg or Greenpoint&#x2014;and were you thinking of going to the pier to watch the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140707034053/http://gothamist.com/2014/04/14/de_blasios_new_york_fireworks_comin.php">East River fireworks</a>? Well, you better come up with a different plan!</p>

<p>A reader noticed this sign indicating that parts of the Williamsburg waterfront would be closed starting tonight through July 5 morning. The Parks Department confirmed this and gave us a few more details:</p><blockquote>This year&apos;s fireworks will be staged at the Brooklyn Bridge and to the south. Waterfront areas to the north such as in Williamsburg and Greenpoint will only have partial or obstructed views. The recommended public viewing areas are at Brooklyn Bridge Park and the Brooklyn Heights promenade.<br>
 <br>
On the 4th of July, the following park areas will be closed to the public:<br>
 <br>
* North 5th Street Pier.<br>
* Transmitter Park&apos;s Pier.  The rest of the park will be open.<br>
* The upper portion (sloped roof) of Bushwick Inlet Park, and direct access to the water&apos;s edge at that park.<br>
* Direct access to the water&apos;s edge at Grand Ferry Park.</blockquote>You can also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140707034053/http://gothamist.com/2014/07/01/nyc_fireworks_2014.php">try catching the fireworks</a> from the South Street Seaport or east side of Lower Manhattan. Or on TV!<p></p>
