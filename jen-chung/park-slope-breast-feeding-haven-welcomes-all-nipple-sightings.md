Covering up artwork that features nipples!  A painting of a topless woman at Tea Lounge on Union Street was briefly censored, thanks to a concerned employee.<p></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504141036/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204616504577173281977936026.html?mod=WSJ_NY_MIDDLELEADNewsCollection">According to the Wall Street Journal</a>, cafe owner Jonathan Spiel &quot;was surprised by the mini-tempest in his tea shop and blamed the abundance of caution on a misunderstanding with his staff,&quot; explaining the paintings, including the one in question, were &quot;done by an employee of mine. Originally I&apos;d asked him to make sure there was nothing uncomfortable which a little kid might ask his mom about. I don&apos;t want to offend people or cause that tension.&quot; Right, like kids at Tea Lounge <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504141036/http://www.yelp.com/biz/tea-lounge-brooklyn#hrid:6FEMD-DXlHh3SLoac7FLBg">have never seen nipples before</a>.</p>

<p>So when another employee asked David Mitchell Aronson to, uh, adjust the painting, Aronson agreed&#x2014;and also covered up male subjects&apos; nipples.  After the mini-outcry (one mom said, &quot;It&apos;s absolutely ridiculous because this is such a liberal hangout, and there are so many breast-feeding mothers in here&quot;), Spiel bared the boobs, but did admit that a no-lady-nipples-in-art ban did extend to...photography.</p>
