<p>President Obama will be visiting the area tomorrow and some people suggest he&apos;ll make one of his familiar, populist meal pit stops&#x2014;in May, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504170315/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/13/in_buffalo_obama_orders_wings_gets.php">he had wings in Buffalo</a>&#x2014;at a NJ subway sandwich shop.  Besides being in Manhattan to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504170315/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/26/bfd_obama_in_nyc_for_wednesday_view.php">tape a segment for <em>The View</em></a>, the President will be<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504170315/http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2010/07/president_obama_schedules_talk.html"> giving a speech about the economy</a> in Edison, NJ.  </p>

<p>While there&apos;s no official word on where Obama will be eating, the rumor is that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504170315/http://www.tasteesubshop.com/">Tastee Sub Shop</a> is a likely destination.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504170315/http://www.1010wins.com/Edison-Sub-Shop-Is-Ready-If-Obama-Gets-Hungry/7779343">According to 1010WINS</a>, &quot;Employees aren&apos;t talking and referred questions to the White House, which didn&apos;t respond for comment. But a customer says he&apos;s been told the shop will be closed until 3 p.m. Wednesday.&quot;  And for those of you unfamiliar with subs, 1010WINS also explains, &quot;Subs get their name from the torpedo-like roll that the cold cuts are served on. They typically include lettuce, tomato, onions, oil and vinegar. Customer usually order by number. The most expensive item on the menu is the No. 6, which is a roast beef sub for $8.83.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504170315/http://www.freshmilc.com/recommendations/grub-spot-tastee-sub-shop-edison-nj/">One fan raves,</a> &quot;[They] don&#x2019;t use Boar&#x2019;s Head &#x2026; there&#x2019;s no fancy gourmet sandwiches with &apos;fresh mozz and roasted red peppers atop a pile of sauteed spinach.&apos;  No hefty price tags that make you question what you&#x2019;re paying $10 for.  Just a simple sub shop where you can rely on GREAT tasting subs at an extremely [affordable] fare.  Your choice of white or wheat rolls and a plethora of deli meats to choose from.  You might want to give yourself a few extra minutes though&#x2026; there&#x2019;s always a line hanging out the door at this place.  They are open until 11 PM and will most certainly conquer your appetite.&quot;  And a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504170315/http://www.yelp.com/biz/tastee-sub-shop-edison#hrid:Y5fraDjLSaiQOwOkN-QcGw">Yelper says</a>, &quot;I think I ate here at least once a week from 1996 - 2000 -- THE BEST SANDWICH SHOP EVER!!!&quot;</p>
