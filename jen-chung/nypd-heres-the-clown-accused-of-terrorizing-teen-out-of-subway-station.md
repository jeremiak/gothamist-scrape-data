<p>Last week, while the country was in the grips of serious <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016014911/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/06/clowns_national_nightmare.php">Clown Fear</a>&#x2014;which has given way to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016014911/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/13/donald_trump_i_couldnt_have_attacke.php">This Fucking Guy Fear</a>&#x2014;an NYPD spokesperson said a person in a clown mask flashed a knife and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016014911/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/06/clown_knife_subway_nope.php">chased a teenaged boy out of a Manhattan subway station</a>. Now, the cops have released surveillance footage of the suspect, who is wanted for menacing.</p>

<p>The 16-year-old boy told the police that he was trying to exit a northbound 6 train at the 96th Street station on Lexington Avenue on Wednesday, October 5th at about 1:55 p.m. when a belligerent man blocked the door. Here&apos;s how the NYPD described it: &quot;The victim and the unidentified male made physical contact as the victim stepped onto the platform. As the victim continued to exit the station, he turned around and noticed the male approaching him while displaying a knife. The victim continued to exit the station running to the street when the unidentified male fled to parts unknown.&quot;</p>

<p>Here&apos;s footage of the suspect entering the station before the alleged encounter; the NYPD says he&apos;s wearing &quot;multi-color clown/performance-style clothing&quot;. He is also wearing a hat and bears a passing resemblance to a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016014911/https://www.google.com/search?q=mark+rylance+hat&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1189&amp;bih=709&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjdm7O3vtjPAhWDWT4KHcxUA9AQ_AUIBigB">younger Mark Rylance</a>.</p>
