<p>A Queens woman gave birth in the back of a car on the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway Sunday afternoon, with help from an NYPD Highway officer and the Uber driver who picked her up. Officer Raphael Mohammed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170325111356/http://abc7ny.com/family/officers-help-mother-deliver-baby-on-bqe/1786340/">revealed the baby was breech</a>, &quot;Once I got my hands on the baby, the baby was a little lifeless - very cool, purple. And that&apos;s when I also realized that the umbilical cord for the child was around the neck.&quot;</p>

<p>The mother had called for the car, driven by Athanasios Tsakalos (who only joined Uber six months ago), in Astoria and wanted to go to Maimonides Medical Center with her two-year-old daughter. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170325111356/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2017/03/05/exclusive-queens-uber-driver-helps-deliver-baby-on-bqe/">He told WCBS 2</a>, &quot;She told me to stop and call the ambulance because she&#x2019;s going into labor. You know, I start panicking at this point because I never really went through this before.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Tsakalos added that he had the toddler sit in the front passenger seat and gave the mother some towels. &quot;The body, the legs, the arms, were out already by the time the cop came there,&quot; Tsakalos told CBS 2. &quot;I told him to please just take over and he put on the gloves.&#x201D;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170325111356/http://abc7ny.com/family/officers-help-mother-deliver-baby-on-bqe/1786340/">In an interview with WABC 7</a>, Mohammed, a former paramedic, explained, &quot;I got me to create an airspace for the baby to start breathing, and once that airspace was created, I was also able to loosen the umbilical cord that was wrapped around the neck. By doing those two things, I realized that the baby started to gasp for air and started to move.</p>

<p>Another officer, Highway Patrol Officer Randal McFarland, helped divert traffic and later he and Mohammed escorted the mother, baby and big sister to Wyckoff Hospital.</p>
