<p>Yesterday, the FBI announced a new addition to its <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120412005744/http://www.fbi.gov/wanted/topten">Top 10 Most Wanted Fugitive List</a>: According to the fed, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120412005744/http://dcist.com/2012/04/one-time_dc_teacher_lands_on_fbis_m.php">former D.C. teacher Eric Justin Toth</a> &quot;is wanted for allegedly possessing child pornography in Washington, DC. It is alleged that in June of 2008, pornographic images were found on a school camera that had been in Toth&apos;s possession. Toth also allegedly produced child pornography in Maryland. Toth has often been described as a computer &apos;expert&quot;&apos; and has demonstrated above-average knowledge regarding computers, the use of the Internet, and security awareness. Toth has the ability to integrate into various socio-economic classes, and is an expert at social engineering. He possesses an educational background conducive to gaining employment in fields having a connection to children. Toth may advertise online as a tutor or male nanny.&quot;</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120412005744/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/11/us/osama-bin-laden-replaced-on-fbis-most-wanted-list.html">NY Times has an interesting article today about Toth&apos;s appearance on the list</a>, saying he took the place of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120412005744/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/01/president_obama_about_to_make_annou.php">Osama bin Laden</a>: &quot;It was the first time since 2009 that the F.B.I. had added a fugitive to the list. &apos;We have had a couple of vacancies on the list that we&#x2019;ve been trying to fill,&apos; said Kevin L. Perkins, the F.B.I.&#x2019;s acting executive director for criminal and cyber operations, referring to the spots left by bin Laden and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120412005744/http://laist.com/2011/06/23/whitey_bulger_one_of_fbis_10_most_w.php#photo-1">Boston crime boss James (Whitey) Bulger</a>, who was arrested last June.&quot; The FBI had wanted to add a fugitive who killed three cops in Puerto Rico, &quot;But then that person was caught.&quot;</p>

<p>Perkins said of Toth, &quot;He has a mole under one of his eyes. He is tall and lanky. He is the type of person that I hope, with a little exposure from being on the Top 10 list, will lead to individuals calling in, saying, &#x2018;That guy works in a day care center,&#x2019; or is a teaching assistant or works down the street.&quot;</p>
