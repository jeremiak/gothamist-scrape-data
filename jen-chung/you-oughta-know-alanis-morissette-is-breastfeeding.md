<p>Alanis Morissette:  Seventeen years ago, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120523190350/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPcyTyilmYY">she was singing</a>, &quot;I wish nothing but the best for you both/ An older version of me/ Is she perverted like me/ Would she go down on you in a theatre/ Does she speak eloquently/ And would she have your baby/ I&apos;m sure she&apos;d make a really excellent mother.&quot; Now <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120523190350/http://www.nydailynews.com/gossip/alanis-morissette-considers-attachment-parent-breastfeed-son-stop-article-1.1081587?localLinksEnabled=false">she&apos;s talking up breastfeeding her 16-month-old son</a>: &quot;I&apos;ll breastfeed and I&apos;ll be breastfeeding until my son is finished and he weans.&quot; Which could be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120523190350/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/13/video_mayim_bialik_will_stop_breast.php">until high school</a>.</p>

<p>With all the hubbub about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120523190350/http://gothamist.com/tags/attachmentparenting">attachment parenting</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120523190350/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/10/heres_a_three-yr-old_breastfeeding.php">breastfeeding</a> (and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120523190350/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/11/times_breastfeeding_mom_duh_i_dont.php">breastfeeding on the cover of Time</a>), is it any wonder that other celebrities are talking it up?   Morissette, who is not a doctor but has played <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120523190350/http://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2009-07-05-morissette-weeds_N.htm">one (an obstetrician!) on TV</a>, continued, &quot;I think it afford the child, when he grows up, to have a lot less therapy to go to. For me, I protect his safety and his well-being and his attachment. That stage of development is a very important stage.&quot;  Okay, but when he&apos;s older, tell him that the situations in <em>Ironic</em> are not really ironic&#x2014;his English teachers will thank you (or you&apos;ll thank him, if you&apos;re homeschooling him):</p>
