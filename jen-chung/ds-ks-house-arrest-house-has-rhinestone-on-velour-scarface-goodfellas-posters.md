										<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none" style=" width:640px; "> <img alt="2011_05_pitchdsk.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405013604im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2011_05_pitchdsk.jpg" width="640" height="481"> <br> <i>&quot;Artwork&quot; inside 153 Franklin Street (Pitchfork Reviews Reviews)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>Sure, you&apos;ve seen the staged real estate listing photographs of 153 Franklin Street, also known as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405013604/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/26/dominique_strauss-kahn_moves_to_swa.php#photo-1">maison d&apos;alleged sexual assaulter and ex-IMF head</a> Dominique Strauss-Kahn.  But have you seen the &quot;rhinestone-on-velour&quot; Scarface and Goodfellas posters inside?  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405013604/http://www.pitchforkreviewsreviews.com/post/5870772281/the-technical-difficulties-that-prevented-me-from-djing">Pitchfork Reviews Reviews</a> did and writes, &quot;So Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the Jew who may have just temporarily dislodged Benjamin Netanyahu to become the #1 worst contributor to the public image of Jews worldwide, is on house-arrest in a $14,000,000 house with pretty big rhinestone-on-velour pictures of Scarface and Goodfellas inside it. There is some deeper meaning to be extracted from this I think, but I don&#x2019;t know how to phrase it.&quot;</p>

<p>Pitchfork Reviews Reviews had been at the swank townhouse&#x2014;which is on the market for $13,995,000&#x2014;nine days ago for a launch party for Dan Abrams&apos; new website, Mogulite.  PRR was supposed to DJ, but the broker, who was making sure no damage was being done to the property, couldn&apos;t figure out the iPod situation: &quot;A Coldplay song plays and my dream of remotely DJing a party in a $14,000,000 house has been deferred. If you are reading this right now Dominique Strauss-Kahn and you have figured out how to configure the iPod dock-TV-speaker system nexus, you should shoot the real estate broker an email about how to do it because he is going to have to show that house again after you leave. Sorry if that sounds callous/ominous/fatalistic.&quot;</p>

<p>In the meantime, Srauss-Kahn&apos;s new TriBeCa neighbors had some remarks (complete with eye-rolling!) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150405013604/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2011/05/26/2011-05-26_dominique_strauss_kahn_new_digs.html">for the Daily News</a>: &quot;He must really be suffering in there with the spa and private theater. It&apos;s the height of hypocrisy. House arrest does not mean a luxury townhouse&quot; and &quot;Please, God, no. They should have found a place for him in jail. This will disrupt all our lives.&quot;</p>
