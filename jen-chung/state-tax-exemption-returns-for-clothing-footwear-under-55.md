<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2009_07_reg.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629182259im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2009_07_reg.jpg" width="110" height="110" class="image-left"> </span>Last fall, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629182259/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/28/state_sales_tax_exemption_ends_on_f.php">state tax exemption for clothing and footwear under $110 ended</a> (thanks to New York&apos;s horrible budget situation), meaning that New York City residents have been paying 4.375% sales tax&#x2014;4% for the state, 0.375% for the commuter tax&#x2014;on those items.  Today, there&apos;s a little bit of relief, with the state tax exemption coming back, but only for clothing or footwear items under $55.</p>

<p>To sum up, here&apos;s how the city explains the tax situation: &quot;Clothing and footwear under $110 are exempt from New York City&apos;s 4.5% sales tax. Starting on April 1, 2011, clothing and footwear under $55 will be exempt from the entire sales tax.&quot;  See what other items are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629182259/http://www.nyc.gov/html/dof/html/business/business_tax_nys_sales.shtml">subject to tax here</a>.</p>

<p>Some shoppers are psyched, but one store manager (Shoemania in Union Square) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110629182259/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2011/04/01/new-york-shoppers-enjoy-new-tax-holiday/">complained to WCBS 2</a>, &quot;&#x201C;Even when they come to the register they always say &#x2018;Why should I pay for this amount of money when I go to New Jersey and pay less amount for taxes&#x2019;?&quot;</p>
