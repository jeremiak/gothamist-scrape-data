With <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623135537/http://www.tmz.com/2009/04/11/white-house-obama-family-dog/">TMZ&apos;s report yesterday</a> about a Portuguese water dog heading to the White House, the White House has now granted the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623135537/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/04/11/AR2009041102484.html?hpid=artslot&amp;sid=ST2009041102652">Washington Post the exclusive</a>: &quot;The girls named it Bo -- and let it be noted that you learned that here first. <strong>Malia and Sasha chose the name, because their cousins have a cat named Bo and because first lady Michelle Obama&apos;s father was nicknamed Diddley, a source said. (Get it? Bo... Diddley?)</strong>&quot;<p></p>

<p>The WaPo&#x2014;which has a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623135537/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/04/11/AR2009041102484.html?hpid=artslot&amp;sid=ST2009041102652">pretty extensive article</a> about the dog, possible leaks about the dog, and First Family preparations&#x2014;notes, &quot;Bo&apos;s a handsome little guy. Well suited for formal occasions at the White House, he&apos;s got tuxedo-black fur, with a white chest, white paws and a rakish white goatee,&quot; and reports that the family met a lei-wearing Bo a few weeks ago.  A staffer cooed, &quot;He&apos;s sooooo cute. It&apos;s very exciting. They had a great meeting.&quot;</p>

<p>Bo, a 6 month old purebred pup, is a gift from Senator Ted Kennedy, who has three Portuguese water dogs (Bo is related to his dogs). He lobbied the Obamas to pick a Portie, because their coats don&apos;t shed and make them a better choice for people with allergies, as the Obama daughters do.  Bo was apparently returned to the breeder, so the Obamas are &quot;rehoming&quot; him. President Obama was inclined to get a rescue dog from a shelter, but also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623135537/http://gothamist.com/2008/11/07/presidentelect_obama_holds_his_firs.php">acknowledged his daughters&apos; health concerns</a> would be a factor. And the WaPo explains, &quot;<strong>As for the rescue pledge, the Obamas came up with a solution intended to lend a serious symbolic note: They&apos;re going to make a donation to the D.C. Humane Society</strong>.&quot;</p>
