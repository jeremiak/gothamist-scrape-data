<p>The woman who was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170530174213/http://gothamist.com/2017/05/29/grand_central_slashing.php">slashed on the face</a> while riding the subway in Manhattan over the weekend is speaking out about the attack. Anna Martinez told WCBS 2, &quot;As soon as the door opened, all I seen was just like her arm come towards me... When it happened, all I kept thinking was my son&#x2014;you know, he was crying. I couldn&apos;t pick him up. I was bleeding.&quot;</p>

<p>Police say that Martinez was cut by Jacqueline Sanjurjo, 53, while both women were on a downtown 5 train on Saturday morning. Martinez was riding the train with her one-year-old son, who was in a stroller, when Sanjurjo seemingly randomly decided to attack. </p>

<p>Martinez said that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170530174213/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2017/05/29/5-train-subway-slashing-victim/">she entered the 125th Street 4/5/6 station</a>, as did Sanjurjo, &quot;When I paid and came in through the gate, she came in through the gate. When I got on the elevator, she got on the elevator. We went downstairs to the lower level to take the 5 Train.&quot;</p>

<p>She noticed that Sanjurjo wasn&apos;t wearing pants. &quot;That was strange enough for me,&quot; Martinez said in her WCBS 2 interview.</p>

<p>While investigators say Sanjurjo may have struck because Martinez was trying to move away from her, Martinez disputes that account, explaining that the subway conductor told everyone to exit the subway at 42nd Street-Grand Central Terminal. When she got up, Martinez said that Sanjurjo slashed her.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170530174213/http://nypost.com/2017/05/30/mom-slashed-by-maniac-im-too-scared-to-ride-the-subway/">The Post reports</a>, &quot;It took cops nearly 10 minutes to show up, allowing Sanjurjo to escape and throw away her weapon, according to Martinez. &apos;She wouldn&#x2019;t have been able to get away and get rid of the weapon if they had come quicker,&apos; the mom said.&quot;</p>

<p>Sanjurjo was eventually apprehended by police and charged with assault, criminal possession of a weapon and acting in a manner injurious to a child.</p>

<p>Martinez needed 30 stitches for the laceration. She also suffered nerve damage. She told the Post, &quot;I was born in New York City. I have been taking the train and buses my whole life... I won&#x2019;t be taking the train &#x2014; not at all. I&#x2019;m afraid.&quot;</p>
