</div></div>					<p>Get ready to &quot;awwwww&quot;! Buffalo&apos;s NBC affiliate, WGRZ, has this <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509233116/http://northbuffalo.wgrz.com/news/environment/bambi-protects-mother-goose/54141">heartwarming story about a pair of unlikely friends</a>&#x2014;a goose who lost her companion and an incredibly intuitive deer at a cemetery.  &quot;[The goose] spends the day sheltering her eggs from the cold spring air inside an empty cemetery urn chosen as home.  The loss of her male partner now makes her vulnerable to any would-be predators who choose to approach the nest.  But, in an unlikely twist of fate, an adult deer has befriended the mother goose, taking over the role of protector.&quot;</p>

<p>Apparently it&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509233116/http://online.wsj.com/article/AP18bdfa7cb21c4f49aa4e855663b7bc3d.html">unusual for a goose and a deer</a> to pay attention to each other.  Yet, WGRZ reports, &quot;The deer now spends its days near the urn acting as guardian when needed&quot; and even &quot;places itself between [an approaching] person and the nesting goose.&quot; </p>
