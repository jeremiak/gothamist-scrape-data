<p>Chick-fil-A may have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027165653/http://gothamist.com/2015/10/01/inside_chickfila_nyc.php">delicious chicken sandwiches and waffles fries</a>, but its <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027165653/http://thinkprogress.org/lgbt/2012/07/26/589841/memo-to-the-media-and-the-ambivalent-chick-fil-a-condemns-discriminates-and-campaigns-against-lgbt-people/">history of funding anti-gay organizations</a> means that New Yorkers are caught between supporting LGBT rights and being able to Instagram their tasty lunch. Luckily, now we have chef-turned-raconteur Anthony Bourdain to help ease the troubled consciences of Chick-fil-A fans who are not homophobes.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027165653/http://www.adweek.com/news/television/anthony-bourdain-food-porn-youtube-stars-and-his-intolerance-gluten-free-diets-171669">AdWeek interviewed Bourdain</a> (at Hop Kee in Chinatown), and asked him, &quot;How about government getting involved in where and how we eat? Mayor Bill de Blasio called on New Yorkers to boycott Chick-fil-A given the owner&apos;s anti-LGBT views.&quot;</p>

<p>Bourdain replied:</p><blockquote>Are we looking for nice people to run our companies? We&apos;re going to be looking pretty hard. I&apos;m not going to go eat at that restaurant or I&apos;m not going to patronize that business because I don&apos;t like what they institutionally support&#x2014;I don&apos;t like the chairman of the board, I don&apos;t like who created the company, whatever. There&apos;s a whole lot of reasons to just make a personal decision and not go eat at a business and give them your money. I come from a restaurant business where you&apos;re lucky if the guy working next to you isn&apos;t like an armed robber. I support your inalienable right to say really stupid, offensive shit and believe really stupid, offensive shit that I don&apos;t agree with. I support that, and I might even eat your chicken sandwich.</blockquote>To be fair, Mayor de Blasio <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027165653/http://gothamist.com/2016/05/04/bad_chicken.php">never called on a Chick-fil-A boycott</a>; he said, &quot;What the ownership of Chick-fil-A has said is wrong. I&apos;m certainly not going to patronize them and I wouldn&apos;t urge any other New Yorker to patronize them. But they do have a legal right&quot; to be in business.<p></p>

<p>Bourdain probably prefers the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161027165653/http://gothamist.com/2015/07/09/shake_shack_chicken_sold_out.php">Shake Shack Chicken Sandwich</a> anyway&#x2014;Shake Shack is <a 2016="" href="&lt;a href=" http:="" gothamist.com="" 04="" 07="" bourdains_favorite_nyc_spots.php"="">&quot;one of his top five NYC restaurants</a>.</p>
