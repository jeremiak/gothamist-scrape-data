<p>A New York Congressional member has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120605104342/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/05/nyregion/representative-hayworths-adviser-quits-after-acid-hurling-remark.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">accepted the resignation of her campaign adviser </a>who wrote on Facebook, &quot;Let&#x2019;s hurl some acid at those female democratic Senators&quot; who don&apos;t agree with their views.  </p>

<p>Jay Townsend, campaign spokesman for Rep. Nan Hayworth, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120605104342/http://www.nationalmemo.com/gop-spokesman-lets-hurl-some-acid-at-those-female-democratic-senators/">made the comment on May 26</a>, responded on Facebook to a commenter named Tom, &quot;When is Tommy boy going to weigh in on all the Lilly Ledbetter hypocrites who claim to be fighting the War on Women? Let&#x2019;s hurl some acid at those female democratic Senators who won&#x2019;t abide the mandates they want to impose on the private sector.&quot;  (The Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120605104342/http://sfist.com/2012/04/17/happy_equal_pay_day.php">was signed into law in 2009</a>.)</p>

<p>Hayworth&apos;s campaign <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120605104342/http://www.lohud.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=2012306020024&amp;nclick_check=1">tried to reject the controversy</a>, but finally, this past weekend, Townsend <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120605104342/https://www.facebook.com/RunningForOffice">wrote on Facebook</a>, &#x201C;On May 26, I posted a stupid, thoughtless, and insensitive comment on a Facebook page... The mistake was mine and mine only, and the post in no way was intended to represent the views of anyone for whom I have worked or represented.&quot;</p>

<p>Hayworth said, &quot;Jay Townsend has offered, and I have accepted, his resignation from his position with my campaign. Now, let&#x2019;s return to talking about issues that really matter to families: job creation, spending restraint and economic development.&quot;  The NY Times reports that there are four Democrats who want to challenge her: &quot;Sean Patrick Maloney, an aide to former Gov. Eliot Spitzer; Mayor Tom Wilson of Tuxedo Park; Rich Becker, a town councilman in Cortlandt; and Mayor Matt Alexander of Wappingers Falls.&quot;</p>
