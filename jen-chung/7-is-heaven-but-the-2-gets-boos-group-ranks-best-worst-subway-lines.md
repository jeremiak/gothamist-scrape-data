<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150826054836/http://straphangers.org/statesub14/release.html">latest annual report from a subway riders&apos; advocacy group</a> has resulted in news that will shock no 2 train rider: The 2 line is the<em> worst.</em> The Straphangers Campaign also deemed the 7 train the best line this year.</p>

<p>The Straphangers Campaign considers these factors&#x2014;&quot;the amount of scheduled service; the regularity of train arrivals; mechanical failures of subway cars; chance of getting a seat at the most congested point during rush hour; cleanliness of subway car floors and seats; and in-car announcements&quot;&#x2014;and then develops a rating on a $2.50 scale. So the 7 train received a $2.00 rating, while the 2 got a lousy $1.30:</p><blockquote>The 7 ranked highest because it tied for best in the system on frequency of service &#x2014; and also performed above average on three measures: delays caused by mechanical breakdowns; seat availability at the most crowded point during rush hour; and subway car cleanliness. The line did not get a higher rating because it performed below average on regularity of service and subway car announcements. The 7 runs between Times Square and Main Street Flushing in Queens...<p></p>

<p>...The 2 performed below average on three measures: regularity of service; delays caused by mechanical breakdowns; and seat availability during rush hour. The line did not get a lower rating as it tied for best in the system on subway car announcements and performed near average on subway car cleanliness and amount of scheduled service. The 2 operates between Brooklyn College in Brooklyn and Wakefield in the Bronx.</p></blockquote>Let&apos;s look at what the other lines got:<p></p>
