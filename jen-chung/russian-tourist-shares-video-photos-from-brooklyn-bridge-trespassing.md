<p>If you were wondering what a selfie taken from one of the Brooklyn Bridge towers looks like, here you go! Russian tourist Yaroslav Kolchin <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510012642/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/brooklyn-bridge-selfie-landed-russian-tourist-jail-spectacular-article-1.1976018">shared his pictures with the Daily News</a>, admitting, &quot;It was beautiful. It was the best point to look and enjoy (the view).&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510012642/http://gothamist.com/2014/08/24/video_man_arrested_for_mid-day_stro.php">Totally worth getting arrested</a>!</p>

<p>As you can see from the image, Kolchin manages to capture the Manhattan skyline, the bridge&apos;s Manhattan towers and his peace sign. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510012642/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/brooklyn-bridge-selfie-landed-russian-tourist-jail-spectacular-article-1.1976018">He also took photos</a> of his sneakers enjoying the view, his walk up the cables and a cop who came to apprehend him. Kolchin reiterated that the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510012642/http://gothamist.com/2014/10/10/brooklyn_bridge_climber_in_russia_b.php">Russian police don&apos;t care about stuff like this</a>, declaring, &quot;In Russia, this is normal thing to do. I was a little bit scared, but it was my last day in New York. I want to save memories of my trip and take beautiful pictures.&quot; But didn&apos;t the fact that the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510012642/http://gothamist.com/2014/08/26/tourist_scaled_brooklyn_bridge_for.php">door up the cable was locked</a> suggest that the area was off-limits? </p>

<p>The August 24 stunt was an embarrassment to the NYPD, which was already reeling from the German artists who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510012642/http://gothamist.com/2014/07/22/surrender_brooklyn_mysterious_white.php">swapped the flags atop the Brooklyn Bridge towers for bleached out flags</a> in July. Kolchin was finally <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510012642/http://gothamist.com/2014/10/10/brooklyn_bridge_climber_in_russia_b.php">allowed to leave New York City last week</a>, when a judge accepted his community service work.</p>

<p>Kolchin explained on his Facebook page (translated), &quot;I pleaded guilty only on one [charge], oddly enough, prohibiting the entry of the bridges. :) To prove innocence and on it would be tantamount to saying that &apos;it was not me, you got me confused with someone else.&apos;&quot; Which would have been impossible since there&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510012642/http://gothamist.com/2014/08/26/tourist_scaled_brooklyn_bridge_for.php">video of him on the bridge</a>.</p>
