<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:365px; "> <img alt="2011_04_iphone4sub.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110501214032im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2011_04_iphone4sub.jpg" width="365" height="285"> <br> <i>Japanese iPhone 4 fans (AP)</i></div> Just a week after the NYPD announced that iPhones&#x2014;especially the iPhone 4&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110501214032/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/22/your_iphone_4_is_very_attractive_to.php">are targets for subway thefts</a>, the cops announce that they arrested a man for stealing an iPhone 4 on a 4 train.  And the iPhone 4&apos;s owner turned out to be an undercover cop.  Kasseim Thomas, 47, was busted in the Bronx, but cops started noticing him when he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110501214032/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2011/04/30/2011-04-30_career_pickpocket_pinched_on_subway_by_nypd_after_pilfering_smartphone.html">was getting on and off a train</a> at 59th Street and Lexington&#x2014;Lt. Kevin Callaghan said, &quot;That raised our suspicion level. That&apos;s how pickpockets work on the trains.&quot;<p></p>

<p>A group of cops were on the Lexington Avenue line to look for pickpockets accused of previous crimes.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110501214032/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2011/04/29/man-accused-of-swiping-iphone-from-undercover-cop-aboard-4-train/">According to WCBS 2</a>, &quot;Callaghan said Thomas &#x201C;began to crowd the plainclothes officer&#x201D; and <strong>had a sweatshirt over his hand as he reached into the cop&#x2019;s backpack and removed the iPhone</strong>.&quot; Thomas has dozens of arrests for grand larceny and Callaghan said, &quot;He a habitual offender, who just does his jail time, comes back out and regresses right back to the stuff he knows.&quot;  </p>

<p>Callaghan added, &quot;People are very engrossed in using their iPhone or BlackBerry.  They don&#x2019;t seem to think it&#x2019;s a problem. People just have to be cognizant of who&#x2019;s around them and that these valuables are attractive to criminals.&quot; Also, just don&apos;t let strangers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110501214032/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/22/your_iphone_4_is_very_attractive_to.php">hold your precious gadgets when they ask you to</a>, okay?</p>
