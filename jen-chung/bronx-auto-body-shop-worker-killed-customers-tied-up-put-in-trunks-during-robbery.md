<p>An employee at a Bronx auto body shop was found dead last night, with a zip tie around his neck, hours after two robbers stormed the business. Police say two customers who were there at the time were also tied up and put into trunks.</p>

<p>The incident occurred at 1631 Stillwell Avenue; the NYPD says that police responded to a 911 call about a robbery around 8:50 p.m.:</p>

<blockquote>Upon arrival, officers were informed that two male suspects wearing masks, gloves and hoodies, entered the location. The suspects then tied up two customers and placed them inside of the trunks of two vehicles. The customers were able to free themselves, and when they did, the suspects and a male employee were no longer at the location. 

<p>At [11:16 p.m.], police located the employee&apos;s vehicle parked in front of 6071 Broadway, within the confines of the 50 Precinct. An adult male was found seated in the back seat of the vehicle, unconscious and unresponsive, with a zip tie around his neck.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>The employee was pronounced dead at Montefiore Hospital. </p>
