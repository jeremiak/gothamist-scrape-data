Most people think Strahan&apos;s return is unlikely--even Giants coach <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611053510/http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/football/giants/2008/08/25/2008-08-25_tom_coughlin_says_michael_strahans_mind_.html">Tom Coughlin said</a>, &quot;His mentality was different last year. The last time I talked with Michael (two weeks ago in Albany) he had accepted his new challenge and was very happy about that.&quot;  But new Jets quarterback Brett Favre <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110611053510/http://www.newsday.com/sports/football/ny-spgiants265816881aug26,0,852098.story">thinks Strahan is the way to go</a>, &quot;If I were a Giant, <strong>I&apos;d do whatever I could to get him out and have him back on my team</strong>.&quot;</p>
