</div></div>					<p>The Brooklyn man accused of killing a female jogger last summer apparently had a &quot;hatred of women,&quot; a police source <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170402214502/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/queens/chanel-lewis-20-arrested-killing-jogger-karina-vetrano-article-1.2964701">told the Daily News</a>. Chanel Lewis, 20, was charged with second-degree murder in the death of Karina Vetrano. During his court appearance, Vetrano&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170402214502/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/NYC-Brooklyn-Man-20-Charged-With-Murder-in-Death-of-Karina-Vetrano-412862713.html">grieving mother shouted</a>, &quot;He&apos;s a demon! He&apos;s a demon, he can burn in hell.&quot;</p>

<p>Vetrano, 30, was an avid runner and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170402214502/http://gothamist.com/2016/08/03/missing_jogger_found_dead_in_howard.php">left her house at 5 p.m.</a> on August 2nd to jog in her Howard Beach neighborhood. Her father, Philip Vetrano, was her usual running buddy but didn&apos;t join her this time due to an injury. He started to worry when he couldn&apos;t reach her by 7 p.m., and called a neighbor in the NYPD. That night, Vetrano joined police on a search that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170402214502/http://gothamist.com/2016/08/06/slain_joggers_earphones_sneaker_fou.php#photo-1">tracked his daughter&apos;s cellphone to Spring Creek Park</a>, where he found his daughter&apos;s body in a tall, weeded area.</p>

<p>The young woman&apos;s teeth were broken and police <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170402214502/http://gothamist.com/2016/08/05/slain_jogger_howard_beach.php">found signs of sexual abuse</a> in what appeared to be a brutal attack. NYPD Chief of Detectives Robert Boyce said that she &quot;put up a ferocious fight right until the end,&quot; also noting, &quot;She also had bruising on her body, we believe from being dragged through those woods&quot; and that she had weeds in her hands: &quot;She was grabbing onto anything she could at that point.&quot;</p>

<p>Yesterday, when announcing that Lewis was in custody, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170402214502/http://gothamist.com/2017/02/05/person_of_interest_karina_vetrano.php">Boyce said</a>, &quot;Karina helped us to identify this suspect, thanks the DNA we recovered from under her nails.&quot; </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170402214502/http://nypost.com/2017/02/06/jogger-murder-suspect-i-strangled-her-because-i-was-angry/">According to the Post</a>, Lewis told detectives that he was walking to get food in Howard Beach, Queens when he &quot;happened to cross paths&quot; with Vetrano on a path in Spring Creek Park. He allegedly confessed, &quot;I was angry. I had some issues at home. I just lost it. When I saw her, I just hit her and kept hitting her. I hit her and choked her.&quot;</p>

<p>Authorities had been looking for leads in Vetrano&apos;s murder for months, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170402214502/http://gothamist.com/2016/12/15/karina_vetrano_killer_profile.php">offering a profile put together with help</a> from the FBI in December. Vetrano&apos;s family raised over $285,000 in reward money as well. </p>

<p>Police zeroed in on Lewis when, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170402214502/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/queens/chanel-lewis-20-arrested-killing-jogger-karina-vetrano-article-1.2964701">the Daily News reports</a>, &quot;Lt. John Russo, who works in the Chief of Detectives office and also lives in Howard Beach, remembered something.&quot;</p><blockquote>Russo had seen Lewis lurking around parked cars in Howard Beach in late May. Russo called 911, as did another resident who saw Lewis holding a crowbar and skulking around someone&#x2019;s backyard. When patrol officers arrived, Lewis was gone. The following day, Russo spotted Lewis again, and cops arrived to question him.<p></p>

<p>Months later, Russo was immersed in the Vetrano murder case, poring over leads, tips, and investigative files.</p></blockquote>When police found Lewis over the weekend, he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170402214502/http://abc7ny.com/news/nypd-karina-vetranos-fight-led-to-suspected-killer/1739723/">voluntarily gave a DNA sample</a>, which apparently matched what was found at the crime scene. <p></p>

<p>The Daily News&apos; source explained, &quot;[Lewis] doesn&apos;t have a criminal record&quot; but &quot;he&apos;s thought of hurting women or attacking women. He&apos;s expressed a deep-seated aggression towards women. But it was nothing he&apos;s ever acted on&quot; prior to August 2nd. </p>

<p>The profile of her killer said, &quot;Anyone encountering him may have observed him to be disheveled in appearance with possible scratches or cuts to his hands, arms, neck, or face. It could have appeared that he was in some type of fight or accident. He may have given any of a variety of excuses for his appearance.&quot; </p>

<p>Lewis&apos;s father, Richard Lewis, said that his son claimed he was attacked by muggers and went to the hospital on August 3rd for his injuries. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170402214502/http://nypost.com/2017/02/06/jogger-murder-suspect-i-strangled-her-because-i-was-angry/">Lewis&apos;s father also</a> &quot;displayed a diploma showing that Chanel graduated last year from the private Martin De Porres HS in Rockaway Park, whose student body comprises &apos;children experiencing emotional and behavioral problems,&apos; according to its site.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170402214502/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2017/02/06/karina-vetrano-murder-suspect-held-without-bail/">Richard Lewis called</a> his son &quot;wonderful&quot; and refused to believe the accusations, tells reporters, &quot;Whatever I heard, he wouldn&#x2019;t have done it. He lives in an area where a lot of people do a lot of things, a lot of hurt and try to push it on other people.&quot;</p>

<p>While Lewis reportedly confessed to beating Vetrano, he did not admit to the sexual assault. Queens D.A. Richard Brown said, &quot;This is truly a very sad case in which a beautiful and talented young woman senselessly lost her life. Thanks, however, to the persistence of the hard-working detectives of the NYPD, assisted by members of my staff, the person allegedly responsible for her brutal murder finally has been brought to justice. At this time he is being charged with intentional murder in the second degree, although the investigation is continuing and a grand jury may consider additional criminal charges when the case is presented to them.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170402214502/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2017/02/05/karina-vetrano-family-speaks/">Phil Vetrano said</a>, &quot;I&#x2019;m not gonna say it&#x2019;s a good day, but we can move forward now. We are at a place we were never at. We know who did this.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170402214502/http://pix11.com/2017/02/05/at-a-loss-for-words-parents-of-howard-beach-jogger-karina-vetrano-react-to-arrest-in-murder-case/">And Cathy Vetrano added</a>, &quot;Our sorrow is so endlessly painful that hearing the news is not what I expected. There&apos;s no happiness, but we&apos;re grateful to the New York City police department.&quot;</p>
