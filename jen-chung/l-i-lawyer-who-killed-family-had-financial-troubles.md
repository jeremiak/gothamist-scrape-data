<p>Police sources say that William Parente apparently <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160402055030/http://www.newsday.com/news/local/ny-lipare2412686264apr23,0,573604.story">was in financial trouble</a> when he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160402055030/http://gothamist.com/2009/04/22/li_lawyer_kills_family_himself_in_m.php">killed his wife and two daughters</a> (before killing himself) in a Maryland hotel room.  Papers found in the hotel room indicted that investors wanted their money back from the lawyer&apos;s investment scheme. A friend told Newsday that &quot;he took calls from the worried investors, who had given Parente as much as $6 million and as little as $50,000&quot; and the Post suggests Parente <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160402055030/http://www.nypost.com/seven/04232009/news/regionalnews/family_slay_was_ponzi_massacre_165769.htm">may have handled $20 million</a> of investor money.</p>

<p>Parente, wife Betty and their daughters Stephanie and Catherine lived in Garden City, and the 59-year-old lawyer worked out of a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160402055030/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/23/nyregion/23hotel.html?ref=nyregion">small office on Lexington Avenue</a> in midtown Manhattan.  The family had been visiting Stephanie, a student at Loyola College in Maryland, when Parente decided to end their lives.  The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160402055030/http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/local/bal-te.md.hotel23apr23,0,1334932.story">Baltimore Sun says</a> Stephanie was surprised by the visit, since she had just seen them during Easter break.  Parente killed them one by one&#x2014;over many hours&#x2014;by first bludgeoning them and then strangling them.  Later, after answering a call from Stephanie&apos;s friend who wondered where she was (he said she was staying with them for the night), Parente cut himself and bled to death in the hotel bathroom.  </p>

<p>Lawyer Bruce Montague of Queens thought his investments with Parente were in short-term real estate loans.  He had demanded his near $450,000 back after the Madoff scandal broke but Parente took a while to pay him back, only recently giving him six checks. The checks bounced, leading Montague to send a letter to Attorney General Andrew Cuomo suggesting he investigate the possible fraud.  Montague released a statement through a colleague, &quot;<strong>All monies involved were private money that can be replaced. What Mr. Parente did to his family is a great tragedy and unforgivable.</strong>&quot;  </p>

<p>A family friend who placed flowers in front of the Parente home told the Post, &quot;A lot of people have financial problems now. Why did he crack? Why did this happen? <strong>I can&apos;t imagine what Betty felt as he came towards her.</strong>&quot;</p>
