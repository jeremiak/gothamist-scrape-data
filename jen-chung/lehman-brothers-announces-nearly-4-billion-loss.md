Per CNN Money, &quot;It was Lehman&apos;s biggest quarterly loss since the firm went public in 1994, exceeding a $2.8 billion loss announced in June,&quot; (analysts were expecting a $1.99 billion loss).  The investment bank is planning a major restructuring, spinning off most of its real estate assets and selling its investment management division. However, an analyst <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110811101757/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/11/business/11lehman.html">said of the spinoff</a>, &#x201C;<strong>It&#x2019;s not a good sign. It&#x2019;s really a sign of the illiquidity in the markets &#x2014; that no one wants to buy these assets.</strong>&#x201D;</p>
