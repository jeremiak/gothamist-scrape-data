</div></div>					<p>Now that polls show <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505202248/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/13/bill_de_blasio_is_now_leading_the_p.php">him in first place</a> (or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505202248/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324139404579014934170825144.html">tied for first place</a>), Democratic mayoral candidate Bill de Blasio pulled out the celebrity big guns last night, at a fundraiser at Susan Sarandon&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505202248/http://newyork.spingalactic.com/">SPiN ping-pong club</a>. Sarandon explained her support for de Blasio over City Council Speaker Christine Quinn, &quot;<strong>As a woman, you can&#x2019;t just vote your vagina</strong>.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505202248/http://www.nydailynews.com/blogs/dailypolitics/2013/08/susan-sarandon-hosts-ping-pong-fundraiser-for-bill-de-blasio">According to the Daily Politics</a>, Sarandon was &quot;interested in Christine Quinn&#x2019;s campaign to be the city&#x2019;s first woman mayor but soured on her over her stance on paid sick days and role in overturning term limits.&quot; </p>

<p>She said, &quot;As a mother, I&#x2019;m more interested in other things... I love New York. I love everything about New York... For me, it&#x2019;s worth whatever it takes to make New York safer, happier, more robust. If we lose the middle class in a city that has...400,000 millionaires, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150505202248/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/15/de_blasio_keeps_beating_up_defensel.php">46% of New Yorkers</a> are living at the poverty line or below the poverty line, this doesn&#x2019;t make for a good future for our city.&quot; She had noted she was born in NYC but her family (she was the oldest of nine) moved to NJ because the city was too expensive. </p>

<p>Cynthia Nixon was also on hand, as were de Blasio&apos;s wife Chirlane McCraya and children Chiara and Dante. Yes, they did play ping-pong! </p>

<p>Sarandon and Nixon, as well as Rosie Perez and Harry Belafonte will be with de Blasio today at a &quot;Hospitals Not Condos&quot; at 7th Avenue and Greenwich Avenue at noon, to call for quality healthcare for everyone.</p>
