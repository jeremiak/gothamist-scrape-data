<p>A Parks Department crew cleaning up the beach in Patchogue, Long Island found a bottle with a message inside it last November. The workers had been cleaning up the mess of debris from Hurricane Sandy when one noticed that the green bottle had a note inside it. The message had a NYC phone number, so parks employee Brian Waldron called it&#x2014;and discovered that the bottle had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130820171757/http://www.newsday.com/long-island/suffolk/note-found-amid-li-sandy-debris-is-from-dead-teen-sidonie-fery-1.5666517">been thrown into the water 12 years ago</a> by a 10-year-old girl who died a few years ago at age 18.</p>

Sidonie died in 2010 when she fell off a cliff in Switzerland, where she attended boarding school.<p></p>

<p>Waldron left a message at the phone number, and Fery&apos;s mother, Mimi Fery, called him back, crying. She told the AP, &quot;I was just sobbing when I heard they had found it. These are very, very kind people.&quot; She also described her daughter as &quot;very artistic and vivacious,&quot; adding that she was teased by other children for her Persian heritage (Sidonie was born on September 11, 1991).</p>

<p>The village of Patchogue will present Mimi Fery with the bottle, as well as a bottle of sand from the area where the bottle was retrieved, in a ceremony this weekend. A plaque will also be dedicated in her daughter&apos;s memory.</p>
