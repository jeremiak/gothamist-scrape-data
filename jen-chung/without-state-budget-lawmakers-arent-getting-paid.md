<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130510043609/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jsaxena/032910albany.jpg"> <img alt="032910albany.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130510043609im_/http://gothamist.com/assets_c/2010/03/032910albany-thumb-300x200-492829.jpg" width="200" height="133" class="image-left"> </a> </span>Because the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130510043609/http://gothamist.com/tags/statebudget">state budget</a> was due on April 1 but hasn&apos;t been approved yet, state law prohibits legislators from getting paid.  And, guess what, going almost four months without pay is hard!  But, don&apos;t worry, many lawmakers understand if you don&apos;t care: Assemblyman Michael Gianaris (D-Queens), who is dipping into his savings to pay for his mortgage, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130510043609/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/22/nyregion/22nopay.html?ref=nyregion">tells the NY Times</a>, &quot;People are rightfully fed up with the lack of effectiveness in state government. I would quickly forgive them for not having sympathy for our personal plight.&quot;</p>

<p>While some lawmakers have outside jobs&#x2014;for instance, Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver works at law firm Weitz &amp; Luxenberg (yes, the personal injury one) but he&apos;s<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130510043609/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/2010/05/25/2010-05-25_pols_back_financial_disclosure__then_clam_up.html"> never disclosed his salary</a>&#x2014;others, like Gianaris, hold down their elected position as their sole job.  Assemblyman Jose Rivera (D-Bronx) said, &quot;[Senate conference leader <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130510043609/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/sampson_playing_law_firm_shel_game_6WnR9nbadkhH0KEdxDf7nL">John] Sampson</a> and Silver, they are doing very well. They don&#x2019;t need their paycheck. We depend on our salaries to pay our rent.&quot; How is he making the bills? His wife&apos;s pension.</p>

<p>The Times adds, &quot;Even lawmakers who have working spouses say losing a chunk of their $79,500 yearly income hurts. Michelle Schimel, an assemblywoman from Long Island, said that although her husband had a job at Infosys International, they needed both their incomes to pay their mortgage, college loans for their two sons and other household expenses.&quot; She said, &quot;<strong>I may end up being the first assemblywoman to foreclose on a mortgage</strong>,&quot; but added, &quot;I signed up for this.&quot;</p>

<p>In the meantime, Governor Paterson is trying to get the Legislature to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130510043609/http://www.timesunion.com/AspStories/story.asp?storyID=952978&amp;category=STATE">come back to Albany to finish the budget</a>. The Senate Democrats&apos; spokesman said, &quot;The Senate and Assembly are meeting themselves because the governor says he will not negotiate.&quot;</p>
