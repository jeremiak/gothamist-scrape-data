<p>After <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161222215803/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/20/world/europe/berlin-attack-christmas-market.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=a-lede-package-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news">12 people were killed</a> in Germany yesterday when a truck driver drove through a Berlin holiday market, the NYPD has heightened their presence at various holiday markets in NYC. </p>

<p>The police department shared an image on social media, showing officers armed with machine guns at one market, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161222215803/https://www.instagram.com/p/BOOOvvtAGPE/?taken-by=nypd">with the message</a>, &quot;Our prayers go out to the families of those who lost their lives today in Berlin, those injured, and all who are affected by this tragedy. The #NYPD is monitoring the events in Germany and around the world today. &#x202A;In the cold, during the holidays and every day of the year, this is your #NYPDprotecting.&quot;</p>

<p>Deputy Commissioner of Counterterrorism John Miller said today on CBS This Morning: &quot;We don&#x2019;t see any specific credible threat either going towards the holiday season or in New York. We have made a lot of adjustments based on these kind of attacks.&quot; Miller mentioned the NYPD&apos;s outreach <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161222215803/http://gothamist.com/2016/11/15/nypd_thanksgiving_day_parade_will_b.php">to truck rental agencies</a>, asking them to alert authorities about any customer exhibiting suspicious behavior while trying to rent trucks under 26,000 pounds without a commercial driver&apos;s licenses. </p>

<p>Miller also said that while the police can consider increasing security in high-profile public places, the largest terrorist attack on U.S. soil after 9/11 was the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161222215803/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/12/approximately_20_people_killed_at_g.php">Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando</a>. &quot;[There&apos;s a] randomness of the targeting,&quot; Miller said, explaining that the NYPD has to be &quot;flexible.&quot; </p>

<p>Berlin authorities have detained a man who immigrated from Pakistan last year, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161222215803/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-38379157">but are now uncertain</a> if he is the suspect who drove the truck.</p>
