We spoke to World Science Festival co-founder, Brian Greene, who is also professor of physics and mathematics at Columbia University (and author of The Elegant Universe), about the festivities.</em></p>

<p><strong>Last year&apos;s festival was entirely sold out and this year&#x2019;s festival is looking to be similarly well-attended. Does this signal that the American public is becoming more interested in science and math?</strong> It&apos;s a great question. I think one way of interpreting that is that there&apos;s a resurgence of interest in math and science. The other is that the interest was always there&#x2014;it just required programming that was accessible and compelling to really bring it out. That interest has just been largely untapped, and what we&apos;ve helped to do is to be the impetus for that interest and enthusiasm to bubble up to the surface.</p>

<p><strong>A major theme of the festival is tying science to art. What role does art have in understanding science?</strong> I think it has a huge role on two levels. One is both artists and scientists are trying to do the same thing. They&apos;re trying to understand the world and the universe better; they just do it from different angles. It&apos;s great when you allow them to meld together so that the insights of each can help take the other further. The other way I think putting art and science together is crucial is the philosophy of the festival&#x2014;you need to create many avenues of entry into science because you&apos;ve got many different kinds of people you want to reach. For the science enthusiast, programs that are more pure science will reach them, but for the person whose attention is more focused on the arts and when they hear science they want to run the other way, if you have dance or music or theater or film or performance art that has an organic link to science, you can bring in a whole new group of people that can get excited about science. That&apos;s what we try to do with those programs. </p>

<p><strong>Well one of the programs is &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110424060316/http://www.worldsciencefestival.com/2009/wall-e">WALL-E&apos;s World</a>.&quot; The movie was a huge hit and you&apos;re taking ideas from that and bringing them down to what they mean in terms of science.</strong> Sure, and that&apos;s another direction. I was referring more to the kinds of programs like the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110424060316/http://www.worldsciencefestival.com/2009/watching-wilson-and-watson">one Anna Deavere Smith is doing</a>. She&apos;s an actress and performance artist and she&apos;s going to portray James Watts and E.O. Wilson. And that&apos;s such an unusual union of art and science to learn about two great scientists through a performance piece. But &quot;WALL-E&apos;s World&quot; is another approach, which is, as you say, to take something that has been wildly popular in popular culture and use it as an avenue of entry into science. You can do it with <em>Star Trek</em>; we&apos;re doing it with <em>Battlestar Galactica</em>, where you appeal to the base of individuals for whom those films or TV programs are exciting, but you bring them further into the science. </p>
