</div></div>					<p>Our state government in Albany may not be able to pass a budget <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428165755/http://gothamist.com/tags/statebudget">within one, two or three months</a>, but our pork barrel spending is <em>unparalleled</em>. So unparalleled that chase scenes in the upcoming Angelina spy thriller <em>Salt</em> were filmed in Albany: Director Phillip Noyce <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428165755/http://www.nbclosangeles.com/blogs/popcornbiz/Thanks-For-Cool-Stunts-in-Salt-Go-To-New-York-Taxpayers-98843779.html">told NBC Los Angeles</a> that even though one sequence is set in D.C., Albany was a terrific substitute, &quot;Due to excessive pork barreling over the years, the capital of New York has built up the most elaborate freeway system you have ever seen,&quot; and mentioned &quot;one overpass to nowhere which just stopped... It was really convenient to one (movie) sequence. It&apos;s a tragedy (for taxpayers) but great for filming.&quot;</p>

<p>Action in the movie then shifts to New York City&#x2014;you remember them <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428165755/http://www.bittenandbound.com/2009/03/14/angelina-jolie-filming-salt-in-nyc-photos/">filming here</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428165755/http://www.silive.com/entertainment/tvfilm/index.ssf/2009/04/angelina_jolie_filming_movie_o.html">last year</a>.  </p>
