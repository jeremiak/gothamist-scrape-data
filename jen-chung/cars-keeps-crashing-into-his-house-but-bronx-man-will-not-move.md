<p>You know how a livery cab <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508164155/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/27/car_slams_into_bronx_house.php">crashed into a Bronx home&apos;s garage on Monday morning</a>? Well, according to the homeowner, Steve Campbell, this is the second time it&apos;s happened (the previous time, the car went <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150508164155/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2012/02/27/out-of-control-livery-cab-crashes-into-bronx-home/">THROUGH THE HOUSE into an adjoining apartment</a>).  However, he told the NY Times, &quot;Why should I move? You could go anywhere and get hit by a car.&quot;</p>

<p>Campbell&apos;s home is on the corner of Taylor Avenue and a Cross Bronx Expressway Service Road, and his surveillance camera caught the incident.  Campbell says the livery cab &quot;was speeding, I could see that on the tape, he was going at least 50 miles per hour.&quot;  This is how the Times describes the incident:</p><blockquote> At 8:27 a.m., a black livery cab on a Cross Bronx Expressway service road swerved to avoid another car, then continued to go quickly through the intersection of Wood and Taylor Avenues.<p></p>

<p>The cab jumped a curb and crashed into a parked van and a post in front of Mr. Campbell&#x2019;s home; it then mowed down a white metal fence that surrounds the house and slammed through the door of the empty garage.</p></blockquote>And the van&apos;s owners were apparently warned that it was a terrible corner to park at.  <p></p>

<p>The livery cab has not been charged.</p>
