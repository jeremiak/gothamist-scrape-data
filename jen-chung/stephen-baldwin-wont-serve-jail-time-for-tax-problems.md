<p>Baldwin <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130315001343/http://gothamist.com/2012/12/06/stephen_baldwin_was_arrested_on_tax.php">was arrested in December</a> for allegedly repeatedly failing to file his New York State personal income tax returns from 2008-2010. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130315001343/http://www.lohud.com/article/20130311/NEWS03/303110026/Stephen-Baldwin-plea-deal-Rockland-tax-case-video?odyssey=mod|breaking|text|Frontpage">According to the Journal News</a>, &quot;The tentative agreement calls for Baldwin to pay back &apos;close to&apos; all of the $350,000 he owes for not paying his income taxes in 2008, 2009, and 2010... If Baldwin pays the tax in a year, the felony charge will be discharged, [his] lawyer said. If he takes longer, he can work out a 5-year payment plan that will include probation.&quot;</p>

<p>His lawyer Russell M. Yankwitt says the baby Baldwin will plead guilty to the charge at the end of the month, &quot;He takes responsibility for what happened,&quot; and explained why things got messed up, &quot;[Baldwin] relied on others, to his detriment.&quot;</p>
