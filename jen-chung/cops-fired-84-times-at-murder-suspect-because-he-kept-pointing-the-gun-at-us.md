<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:335px; "> <img alt="2012_04_shootingharm.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120426234227im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2012_04_shootingharm.jpg" width="335" height="188"> <br> <i>Via WABC 7</i></div> On Tuesday, police officers fired at a murder suspect who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120426234227/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/24/13-yr-old_girl_fatally_shot_cops_wo.php">allegedly fired once at them in Harlem</a>.  It turned out that the suspect, Steven Murray, fired once while the two cops <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120426234227/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/25/cops_fired_84_times_at_man_who_kill.php">returned fire to the tune of 84 shots</a>.  Now <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120426234227/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/he_kept_pointing_gun_says_harlem_24k9JhaC5OBSj3Mnz1ksML?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20Manhattan">one of the cops has explained why</a>: &quot;He kept pointing the gun at us. He&#x2019;s a bad dude.&quot;<p></p>

<p>That&apos;s what Officer Joseph P. Robinson told the Post. Robinson fired 45 shots at Murray while Sgt. Alex Mesa fired 39 times.  Mesa said, &quot;Thankfully, I&#x2019;m fine. I&#x2019;m just glad everything turned out OK. I do feel bad for the victims,&quot; referring to Murray&apos;s 13-year-old sister, who was fatally shot in the head, and Murray&apos;s mother, Christine Fryar, who was shot many times but survived.</p>

<p>Murray had 14 entrance and exit wounds. Witnesses say they heard the police, who were canvassing the area, ask Murray to drop his weapon. Former NYPD Chief Louis Anemone <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120426234227/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/louis-anemone-nypd-chief-department-believes-volume-police-bullets-harlem-shooting-aberration-a-article-1.1067741">writes in the Daily News today</a>, &quot;As the NYPD&#x2019;s former chief of department, I can assure New Yorkers that the volume of bullets in Tuesday&#x2019;s shooting was an aberration &#x2014; but probably a necessary one. And I can also guarantee the Police Department will look closely at the officers&#x2019; actions and evaluate whether every single round discharged was appropriate under the circumstances,&quot; adding, &quot;The officers properly took cover, and from a distance of approximately 70 feet returned fire until the suspect was no longer threatening them with a gun. The poor lighting, the distance between the officers and suspect, the absence of civilians in the area and the suspect&#x2019;s refusal to comply with repeated orders account for the number of rounds fired.&quot;</p>
