<p>The 16-year-old who managed to elude the security at the World Trade Center and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510015223/http://gothamist.com/2014/03/20/teen_on_wire.php">head up to the spire</a> of 1 World Trade Center <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510015223/http://nypost.com/2014/07/30/wtc-scaling-teen-cops-to-misdemeanor-in-plea-deal/">pleaded guilty to misdemeanor base jumping yesterday</a>. </p>

<p>According to the NY Post, Justin Casquejo took a plea deal that requires him to complete 23 days of community service. </p>

<p>Casquelo managed to get to the massive construction site by finding a hole in a fence at 4 a.m. on a Sunday in March. Even without an ID, an elevator operator took him to the 88th floor and walked up the stairs to the top, past a sleeping guard. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510015223/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20140320/financial-district/teen-climbs-top-of-wtc-after-breaking-through-security-papd-says">One worker told the Post</a>, &quot;He came here and he ran hog wild.&quot; After an hour on top of the tallest building in NYC, he almost made it out without detection, until one construction worker stopped him on his way down. </p>

<p>Casquejo allegedly told cops, &quot;I walked around the construction site and figured out how to access the Freedom Tower rooftop.&quot; Later, he Tweeted, &quot;I seriously apologize to anyone who may have been insulted or felt disrespected by my actions. It was not my intention to do so.&quot;</p>

<p>The guard <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510015223/http://gothamist.com/2014/03/26/fired_half-blind_1_wtc_guard_agrees.php">was fired</a>. A few days after Casquejo&apos;s urban exploration, it was revealed that a group of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510015223/http://gothamist.com/2014/03/25/video_watch_wtc_base_jumpers_dive_o.php#photo-1">BASE jumpers jumped from 1WTC in September</a>. So two CNN employees decided to see if they could break into the site&#x2014;and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510015223/http://gothamist.com/2014/03/25/2_cnn_employees_arrested_for_trying.php">they got arrested</a>.</p>
