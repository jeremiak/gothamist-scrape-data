<p>Yesterday was a big day for NYU, as it announced that its president John Sexton would leave the school in 2016&#x2014;and that it will cease its practice of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430035034/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/18/congrats_nyu_students_youre_paying.php">loaning millions to faculty for their second homes</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430035034/http://nyulocal.com/on-campus/2013/08/14/sexton-to-depart-after-2016-nyu-backtracks-on-vacation-home-loans/">NYU Local reports</a>, &quot;In a university-wide email [yesterday], the Board of Trustees acknowledged for the first time that John Sexton would not continue serving as President after 2016. The Board will begin a search for a new president within the next three years, and is committed to including student and faculty representation in the process.&quot; The Board&apos;s email said, &quot;John Sexton&#x2019;s agreement with the University to serve as President extends to 2016, and he has made clear that he will not serve beyond that.&quot;</p>

<p>Sexton, who makes $1.5 million a year, has ushered in huge growth for the university, prompting <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430035034/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/19/nyu_padma_lakshmi_expansion.php">criticism from West Village neighbors</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430035034/http://nyulocal.com/on-campus/2013/05/21/tisch-faculty-vote-no-confidence-in-nyu-president-john-sexton/">ire from faculty</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430035034/http://nyunews.com/2013/03/25/ucats/">workers</a>, who have voted no-confidence in Sexton numerous times. </p>

<p>The Board also said it would stop offering loans for faculty&apos;s second homes, a practice that had extended to Sexton himself (he got a $1 million loan for his Fire Island getaway) and other highly-placed administrators and professors. However, the school will still offer loans for primary residences, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430035034/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/15/nyregion/facing-criticism-nyu-will-cease-loans-to-top-employees-for-second-homes.html?ref=nyregion">with Board chairman Martin Lipton explaining</a>, &quot;This is a matter of extreme importance to us. No university can prosper if there&#x2019;s disruption, if there&#x2019;s unhappiness in the family.&quot; </p>

<p>Earlier this year, Andrew Ross, President of the NYU chapter of the American Association of University Professors, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150430035034/http://wallstreetonparade.com/2013/06/nyu-channels-wall-street-new-documents-show-lavish-pay-perks-and-secret-deals/">told Wall Street On Parade</a>, &quot;When our students are often working two jobs and piling up debt on their credit cards just to scratch together tuition, it&#x2019;s highly questionable for the proceeds to be distributed as extravagant compensation packages and mulltimillion dollar loans to top administrators. In fact, for a non-profit educational institution, it&#x2019;s quite offensive.&quot;</p>
