<p>As rumors heat up that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427162419/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/20/report_tonight_show_headed_back_to.php">Jimmy Fallon will replace Jay Leno</a> as the Tonight Show host (and the show <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427162419/http://gothamist.com/2013/03/22/so_albany_tonight_show_with_jimmy_f.php">will move back to NYC</a>), <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427162419/http://laist.com/2013/03/20/jimmy_fallon_makes_nice_to_jay_leno.php">Leno and Fallon</a> turned the chatter into comedy <strike>gold</strike> bronze. In a segment on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon, Leno finishes his show and is bombarded with questions about Fallon. Fallon, who has been looking out the window, then gets a call from Leno:</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427162419/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/jay-leno-jimmy-fallon-sing-432254">According to the Hollywood Reporter&apos;s sources</a>, &quot;[The] musical bit was Fallon&apos;s idea. After Leno agreed to do it, Fallon&apos;s producers flew to L.A. to film his part in the segment. The collaboration is an important and arguably the first savvy PR step in NBC&apos;s late-night saga as it signaled that there are no hard feelings between the two hosts.&quot; The pair are singing to the melody of &quot;Tonight, Tonight&quot; from West Side Story&#x2014;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427162419/http://www.vulture.com/2013/04/leno-fallon-tonight-tonight-duet-transcribed.html">Vulture transcribed the lyrics</a>: </p><blockquote>Fallon: Only you, every night you throw to me, Jay Leno. In the news, all they do is say &apos;I&apos;m replacing you.&apos; They think I can woo the demo.<p></p>

<p>Leno:  So the network says, &apos;Here&apos;s an idea. Pack your bags, take a hike, NBC-ya.&apos;</p>

<p>Fallon:  Tonight, tonight, who&apos;s gonna host Tonight? Is it gonna be Jimmy or Jay? Tonight, tonight, where will they tape tonight? In New York? Will it stay in LA?</p>

<p>Leno:  Tonight, tonight, my ratings were all right. Twenty years, and I&apos;m still in first place. Tonight, tonight, I&apos;ve got Fox on the line. Or maybe I could take over for Dave?</p>

<p>Both:  Tonight, tonight. Why do they say we fight? I like you. You like me. We&apos;re okay. Tonight, tonight, who cares who hosts Tonight? We both just want our line the next day.</p></blockquote>Anyway, Leno still probably thinks <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150427162419/http://laist.com/2013/03/28/jay_leno_calls_nbc_a_big_number_two.php">NBC is full of number two</a>.<p></p>
