Thanks to a reputation as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170314065226/http://gothamist.com/2010/06/29/feds_arrest_suspected_russian_spies.php">a NYC party girl</a>, as well as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170314065226/http://gothamist.com/2010/06/30/alleged_russian_spy_anything_can_ha.php">plenty of photographs on social networking sites</a>, she has emerged as the tabloids&apos; favorite  alleged spy to write about. Which also means that her <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170314065226/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/02/russian_spy_babes_ex_her_dad_was_ex.php">ex-husband</a> can share topless photos of her and discuss their sex life.  <p></p>

<p>British tabloid News of the World publishes the NSFW photos (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170314065226/http://www.newsoftheworld.co.uk/news/865615/Mile-high-sex-games-with-my-spy-in-the-sky-Anna-Chapman.html">NSFW link</a>) and includes quotes from psychologist-in-training Alex Chapman like &quot;Anya was great in bed and she knew exactly what to do. She was awesome. For the first few months we met for sex about five days a week. We loved it&quot; and &quot;We were having so much fun. We also experimented with sex toys&quot;&#x2014;like nipple clamps and whips.  </p>

<p>He also remembered, &quot;I found her Russian accent such a turn-on. She was the most beautiful person I had ever met, with an extraordinary body, and I was infatuated with her,&quot; but &quot;In the end I felt I didn&apos;t really know her.&quot; The pair, who married in 2002 and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170314065226/http://gothamist.com/2010/07/02/russian_spy_babes_ex_her_dad_was_ex.php">broke up in 2006</a>, also had sex on a plane and never had a joint checking account. </p>

<p>Chapman&apos;s attorney spoke to the Associated Press, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170314065226/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/2010/07/03/2010-07-03_anna_chapman_accused_of_being_russian_spy_is_mortified_by_facebook_pics_fears_de.html">saying</a>, &quot;She was embarrassed by some of the photos that were obviously taken from her Facebook pages. The truth is she [is] probably no different than your typical single 28-year-old woman in New York City. She runs a successful business, goes out at night. She dates men, enjoys a social life.&quot;</p>
