<p>Mayor Bloomberg is speaking from the Blue Room of the City Hall to announce his desire to run for mayor again.  (Live webcast <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171102011405/http://www.nyc.gov/html/om/html/live_press_event.html">here</a>.)  First, he began by noting how he was saddened to hear about police lieutenant <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171102011405/http://gothamist.com/2008/10/02/lieutenant_in_fatal_taser_incident.php">Michael Pigott&apos;s death this morning</a> and how it compounds the tragedy of Iman Morales&apos;s death.  He said Pigott left behind three children, a loving wife and an admirable career.&quot;</p>

<p>Changing topics, Bloomberg says, &quot;I love this city...I have loved every day I have served as Mayor.  There&apos;s nothing better than being able to make a difference in people&apos;s lives.&quot;   He emphasizes how the financial crisis has left NYC in an uncertain future.  Bloomberg doesn&apos;t think the job will be done when his second term is done, and points to his experience  as why he&apos;d be the person to continue to lead the city.  He said he&apos;s spoken with City Council Speaker Christine Quinn and that his administration will work with her team on a bill, and if the City Council passes it, he <b>will run</b> for mayor again.  And he&apos;ll let the voters decide whether they want to vote for him.</p>
