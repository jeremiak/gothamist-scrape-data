<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-left" style=" width:260px; "> <img alt="2010_03_taxis03.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130530200605im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2010_03_taxis03.jpg" width="260" height="173"> <br> <i>Photograph by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130530200605/http://www.flickr.com/photos/klingon65/4346231451/">klingon65 on Flickr</a></i></div> After it was revealed that the majority of taxi cab drivers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130530200605/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/13/some_taxi_drivers_scammed_fares_out.php">had overcharged passengers</a>, the Taxi and Limousine Commission <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130530200605/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/14/after_massive_fraud_will_cabbies_re.php">hoped to issue refunds</a> to those who had paid by credit card. But now Mayor Bloomberg says  they shouldn&apos;t hold their breath.  He <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130530200605/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/03/19/refunds-from-taxi-scam-not-likely-mayor-says/">said on the John Gambling radio show</a>, &quot;You&#x2019;re talking about eight bucks for a ride instead of five bucks for a ride, and how are you going to go and ever get the monies and get them back to the people?&quot;<p></p>

<p>Bloomberg also said that it would be a lot of work to track down those customers who paid with credit, because the TLC would need to work with the credit cards&apos; financial institutions, &quot;I mean, it would cost you more to do it than you save. Would it be nice if you could do it cost-free? Yes, no argument about that. The main thing is to stop it from happening and to go after a handful of the most egregious cases and prosecute them so that everybody else understands that we&#x2019;re not going to walk away.&quot;</p>

<p>Out of the approximately 36,000 cabbies who charged passengers double the usual NYC rate (also known as Code 1) by using the fare for Nassau and Westchester County (Code 4&#x2014;there is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130530200605/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/18/taxis_get_fare_setting_alerts.php">now an alert about the codes</a> being programed in the taxi TV&apos;s), the TLC says 3,000 overcharged passengers at least 100 times and will probably face prosecution. As for the &quot;less egregious&quot; offenders, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130530200605/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/mack_at_hack_cheats_LFVH5hfGRpRD5dbPwej6iP">the Post says</a> TLC officials will impose &quot;significant penalties&quot; on them, since taking away their licenses means losing thousands of cabbies off the road.  </p>
