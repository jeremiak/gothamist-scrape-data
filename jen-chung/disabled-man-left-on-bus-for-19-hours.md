Edwin Rivera, who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160216043550/http://www.1010wins.com/Disabled-Man-Survives-Frigid-Nite/3585950">doesn&apos;t speak</a>, should <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160216043550/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/2009/01/01/2009-01-01_mentally_disabled_young_man_spends_night.html">have been dropped off at home</a> yesterday afternoon, after attending a program for the disabled, but apparently the driver forgot and brought the vehicle to the bus depot in Brooklyn.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160216043550/http://wcbstv.com/topstories/missing.cerebral.palsy.2.898300.html">WCBS 2 reports</a> that his parents reported him missing, but the bus company didn&apos;t find him when they searched last night.  His parents joined the search this morning and found him&#x2014;and his mother was happy and annoyed, &quot;<strong>I&apos;m so relieved and I&apos;m so mad at the bus company for leaving him. He&apos;s not a kid. He&apos;s almost 6&apos;2&quot; how do you miss him?</strong>&quot;  Criminal charges may be filed against the driver.</p>
