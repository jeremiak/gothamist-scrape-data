<p>While many New Yorkers may have vehemently disagreed with his ideology, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160523063221/http://dcist.com/2016/02/_antonin_scalia_the_famously.php">Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia&apos;s death</a> has been met with respectful sorrow around the city. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160523063221/https://twitter.com/SenSchumer/status/698648675090833409">Senator Charles Schumer said</a>, &quot;Sad news indeed. While we disagreed on many issues, Justice Scalia was a brilliant man &amp; a great son of Queens with a genuine joy for life.&quot;</p>

<p>Mayor Bill de Blasio ordered that all flags be lowered from last night until sunset on February 22nd. He said of Scalia: &quot;We mourn tonight for the loss of Justice Antonin Scalia. He grew up in Queens, went to school in Manhattan and became the country&apos;s first Italian American Supreme Court Justice. He was proud to be a New Yorker, and New Yorkers were proud to have one of their own serve as a Supreme Court Justice. The First Lady and I send our thoughts and prayers to his wife, children and other family members.&quot;</p>

<p>Even the Reverend Al Sharpton extended his sympathies:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I also extend to them my condolences. I hope others who disagreed with him as firmly as I have, will refrain from ugliness.

<p>One of the best interviews with Scalia was a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160523063221/http://nymag.com/news/features/antonin-scalia-2013-10/#print">2013 piece by New York magazine&apos;s Jennifer Senior</a>. Here&apos;s an excerpt:</p><blockquote><strong>You&#x2019;ve got grandkids. Do you feel like the Internet has coarsened our culture at all? </strong><br>
I&#x2019;m nervous about our civic culture. I&#x2019;m not sure the Internet is largely the cause of it. It&#x2019;s certainly the cause of careless writing. People who get used to blurbing things on the Internet are never going to be good writers. And some things I don&#x2019;t understand about it. For example, I don&#x2019;t know why anyone would like to be &#x201C;friended&#x201D; on the network. I mean, what kind of a narcissistic society is it that &#xAD;people want to put out there, This is my life, and this is what I did yesterday? I mean &#x2026; good grief. Doesn&#x2019;t that strike you as strange? I think it&#x2019;s strange.<p></p>

<p><strong>I&#x2019;ve gotten used to it.</strong><br>
Well, I am glad that I am not raising kids today. And I&#x2019;m rather pessimistic that my grandchildren will enjoy the great society that I&#x2019;ve enjoyed in my lifetime. I really think it&#x2019;s coarsened. It&#x2019;s coarsened in so many ways.</p>

<p><strong>Like what?</strong><br>
One of the things that upsets me about modern society is the coarseness of manners. You can&#x2019;t go to a movie&#x2014;or watch a television show for that matter&#x2014;without hearing the constant use of the F-word&#x2014;including, you know, ladies using it. People that I know don&#x2019;t talk like that! But if you portray it a lot, the society&#x2019;s going to become that way. It&#x2019;s very sad.</p>

<p>And you can&#x2019;t have a movie or a television show without a nude sex scene, very often having no relation to the plot. I don&#x2019;t mind it when it is essential to the plot, as it sometimes is. But, my goodness! The society that watches that becomes a coarse society.</p></blockquote>She also got him to reveal that he got into hunting after his son married a woman from Louisiana whose family hunts (Scalia died while on a hunting trip), he had no idea what a poker &quot;tell&quot; was, and that he enjoyed some pop culture (&quot;<em>Seinfeld</em> was hilarious. Oh, boy. The Nazi soup kitchen? No soup for you!&quot;).<p></p>

<p>On the other hand, Scalia stood in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160523063221/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/27/photos_video_celebrating_domas_down.php#photo-1">way of progress</a> for much of his career. Gay City News&apos; headline was less forgiving: &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160523063221/http://gaycitynews.nyc/antonin-scalia-determined-foe-gay-rights-advances-dies-79/">Antonin Scalia, Determined Foe of Gay Rights Advances, Dies at 79</a>.&quot;</p>
