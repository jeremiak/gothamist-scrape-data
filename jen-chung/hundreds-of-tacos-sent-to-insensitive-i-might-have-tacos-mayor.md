<p>So you know how East Haven, CT mayor Joe Maturo&apos;s plan for reaching out the Latino community, which has been intimidated by the local police for years (well, at least according to the Department of Justice&apos;s investigation), <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602101016/http://gothamist.com/2012/01/25/in_wake_of_racist_cop_scandal_ct_ma.php">was to go and have some tacos</a>?  Well, activists just sent his office 500 tacos.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602101016/http://www.wfsb.com/story/16600448/immigration-groups-sends-hundreds-of-tacos-to-east-haven-mayors-office">According to WFSB</a>, Reform Immigration for America said anyone who &quot;texted &quot;Taco&quot; to 69866 it would send a taco on their behalf.&quot;  Maturo issued a statement saying the food would be donated to a soup kitchen, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602101016/http://www.wtnh.com/dpp/news/new_haven_cty/hundreds-of-tacos-delivered-to-east-haven-mayor-maturo">adding</a>, &quot;The events of the past few days have focused our Town, and my administration, on the need to deal sensitively and compassionately with the challenges currently facing our Town.  We will continue to address those challenges while also striving to provide the services our residents have come to expect.&quot;</p>

<p>Maturo also issued a<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602101016/http://www.wpix.com/news/wpix-mayor-maturo-official-statement,0,2958824.story"> statement to apologize for his bone-headed remarks</a>, &quot;My sincerest apologies go out to the East Haven community and, in particular, the Latino community for the insensitive and off-collar comment that I made to WPIX reporter Mario Diaz yesterday regarding the recent events affecting our community and our police department. Unfortunately, I let the stress of the situation get the best of me and inflamed what is already a serious and unfortunate situation. I regret my insensitive comment and realize that it is my job to lead by example.&quot;</p>

<p>But Maturo&apos;s critics are unconvinced: Congressman Chris Murphy Tweeted, &quot;Apologizing to people who might have been offended is not an apology, Mayor Maturo,&quot; and Hartford Mayor Pedro Segarra told the Courant, &quot;As Mayor, I stand strongly behind the men and women who protect and serve our city and encourage our residents to work as partners toward the best interests of our communities... That cannot happen if accusations of discrimination are dismissed and disregarded. Many have worked diligently to correct the painful history of racism in this country, and Mayor Maturo&apos;s comments are a disappointing example of how far we still have to go to.&quot; And James Rawlings, president of the Greater New Haven NAACP, added, &quot;<strong>When people say things quickly, that&apos;s when they&apos;re more inclined to say what they really believe.</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>Four East Haven police officers are accused of violating the civil rights of community members by allegedly targeting Latinos, intimidating, harassing and sometimes beating them. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120602101016/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/26/nyregion/on-latino-abuse-mayor-says-i-might-have-tacos.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">NY Times has a look </a>at the trouble-plagued recent history of the East Haven police department: &quot;The police in East Haven have been under a microscope since 1997, when officers shot an unarmed black man, Malik Jones, at close range, an issue still alive in court appeals.&quot;</p>
