<p>Those hoping to see a possible Triple Crown winner at this weekend&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612104914/http://www.belmontstakes.com/">Belmont Stakes</a> will have to wait for next year:  Kentucky Derby and Preakness winner I&apos;ll Have Another will not be racing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612104914/http://espn.go.com/horse-racing/triplecrown2012/story/_/id/8025449/another-race-belmont-trainer-says">because of a swollen left front tendon</a>.  Trainer Doug O&apos;Neill&apos;s brother Dennis told the AP that after a scan this morning, the tendon seemed &quot;kind of tender... the horse is sound and happy, but it&apos;s not worth it.&quot;</p>

<p>In an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120612104914/http://www.belmontstakes.com/story/2012/06/08/i%E2%80%99ll-have-another-wraps-up-friday-training-early-at-belmont-park/">article posted on the Belmont Stakes website</a>, by the New York Racing Association, Doug O&apos;Neill said this morning, apparently before making the decision to keep the horse out of the race, &quot;He is fit and ready to go and we are just trying to let him bring as much energy to the table tomorrow as possible. We thought giving him an easy day the day before would be a good move. He stayed with coach Lava Man just to keep everything off-speed. I was very pleased with it. Perfect. We are ready to roll.&quot;  Here&apos;s video of I&apos;ll Have Another this morning:</p>

<p>O&apos;Neill will be holding a press conference at 1 p.m. The second favorite is Dullahan, whose trainer Dale Romans said, &quot;I thought this was going to be one of the greatest races in history, and I wanted the opportunity to be part of it. But this is bigger than that.&quot;</p>
