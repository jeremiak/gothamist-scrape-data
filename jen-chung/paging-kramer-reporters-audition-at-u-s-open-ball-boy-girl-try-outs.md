<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140604114706/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/06/24/want-to-be-a-ball-boy-at-the-u-s-open-get-in-line/?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">CityRoom sent Matt Flegenheimer</a> who explained, &quot;Organizers said they expected about 350 applicants for the 80 available slots, with a median age of 16. Anyone 14 or older can sign up. The hourly wage is $7.75.&quot;  He showed some promise (none of the balls he threw hit anyone), but was too hunched over during the ball collecting drill.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140604114706/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/2011/06/24/2011-06-24_ace_reporters_gonna_forget_about_serving_as_ball_boy_at_us_open_not_his_game.html">Daily News&apos; victim was crime reporter Kerry Burke</a>:</p><blockquote>I was fresh from a late-night arson in the Rockaways, pushing 50 and not exactly in shape - but, hey, an ink-stained wretch can dream, can&apos;t he?<p></p>

<p>Before hitting Arthur Ashe Stadium, I had done my usual training: climbing tenement stairs to victims&apos; homes, carbo-loading on stakeout pizza and hydrating with post-crime scene tallboys.</p></blockquote>He admits, &quot;I threw fire. With no control whatsoever. More than once, U.S. Open staff had to duck for cover,&quot; prompting someone to tell him, &quot;Watch out for the umpires. We haven&apos;t given them helmets yet.&quot;  Aww.<p></p>
