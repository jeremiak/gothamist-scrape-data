<p>This evening it was reported that both President Barack Obama and President-elect Donald Trump were recently told that Russian intelligence officials allegedly have information that could be used to compromise or blackmail Trump. <b>Update</b>: Trump has Tweeted that this is &quot;FAKE NEWS.&quot;</p>

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170402223407/https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/818990655418617856">January 11, 2017</a></blockquote> <script async src="//web.archive.org/web/20170402223407js_/http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></center></center>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170402223407/http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/10/politics/donald-trump-intelligence-report-russia/index.html">According to CNN</a>, Obama and Trump were shown &quot;classified documents... [that] included allegations that Russian operatives claim to have compromising personal and financial information about Mr. Trump.&quot;</p><blockquote>The allegations were presented in a two-page synopsis that was appended to a report on Russian interference in the 2016 election. The allegations came, in part, from memos compiled by a former British intelligence operative, whose past work US intelligence officials consider credible. The FBI is investigating the credibility and accuracy of these allegations, which are based primarily on information from Russian sources, but has not confirmed many essential details in the memos about Mr. Trump.</blockquote><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170402223407/https://www.buzzfeed.com/kenbensinger/these-reports-allege-trump-has-deep-ties-to-russia?utm_term=.qi0DeQMbJ#.txyWaB2X4">Buzzfeed then published a dossier</a>, compiled by a person who is allegedly a former British intelligence official, that makes &quot;explosive &#x2014; but unverified &#x2014; allegations&quot;: &quot;The dossier, which is a collection of memos written over a period of months, includes specific, unverified and potentially unverifiable allegations of contact between Trump aides and Russian operatives, and graphic claims of sexual acts documented by the Russians.&quot;<p></p>

<p>For example, there&apos;s an allegation that Trump paid prostitutes to perform a &apos;golden shower show&apos; in front of him on a bed the Obamas slept on at the Ritz Carlton in Moscow. </p>

<p>Buzzfeed noted that &quot;the documents have circulated for months, and acquired a kind of legendary status among journalists, lawmakers, and intelligence officials who have seen them.&quot; Expect to see some tweets from Trump in 3, 2, 1...</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170402223407/https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/10/fbi-chief-given-dossier-by-john-mccain-alleging-secret-trump-russia-contacts?CMP=share_btn_tw">Guardian claims</a> that the FBI was given the dossier by Senator John McCain: &quot;The Guardian has not been able to confirm the veracity of the documents&#x2019; contents, and the Trump team has consistently denied any hidden contacts with the Russian government. But an official in the US administration who spoke to the Guardian described the source who wrote the intelligence report as consistently reliable, meticulous and well-informed, with a reputation for having extensive Russian contacts.&quot;</p>

<p>Trump&apos;s lawyer, Michael Cohen, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170402223407/https://mic.com/articles/165050/michael-cohen-trump-s-lawyer-emphatically-denies-claims-about-trump-golden-shower#.KelY5lA3i">denied the golden shower claim</a>, telling Mic, &quot;Somebody is having a lot of fun at your expense.  It&apos;s so ridiculous on so many levels. Clearly the person who created this did so from their imagination or did so hoping that the liberal media would run with this fake story for whatever rationale they might have.&quot;</p>
