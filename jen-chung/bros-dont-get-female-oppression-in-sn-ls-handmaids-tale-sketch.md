<p>Hulu&apos;s adaptation of Margaret Atwood&apos;s  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170507192906/http://gothamist.com/2017/04/25/handmaids_tale_hulu.php"><em>The Handmaid&apos;s Tale</em></a> has been getting raves (and got <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170507192906/http://variety.com/2017/tv/news/the-handmaids-tale-renewed-season-2-hulu-1202407505/">a confirmed second season</a>) for its depiction of a dystopian society where women&apos;s rights are suppressed by a totalitarian government. Last night, Saturday Night Live delved into a lesser-explored part of the series: How the bros reacted when everything changed.</p>

<p>In the pre-filmed segment, which hewed closely to the show&apos;s cinematography, four Handmaids (Cecily Strong, Sasheer Zamata, Aidy Bryant and Vanessa Bayer) are debating whether to join the newly formed resistance (&quot;It&apos;s too dangerous!&quot;) run into some guys they used to know. Mikey Day&apos;s oblivious bro says, &quot;Girl squad! What the freak is up?&quot; and Chris Pine&apos;s character follows up, &quot;You missed my Cinco de Mayo half birthday! What&apos;d you do, flake or what?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Do you not know? It&apos;s the Republic. Everything is different now,&quot; answers Strong&apos;s Handmaid.</p>

<p>Pine&apos;s bro is puzzled, &quot;Different how?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We are Handmaids,&quot; Bayer&apos;s partially blinded Handmaid explains and the others detail how the government took their money, jobs and kids.</p>

<p>After a long pause, the bros acknowledge some of it. Pine&apos;s bro says, &quot;I think I actually read something about that. But, I&apos;ve super busy with work lately.&quot;</p>

<p>Later, another bro (Alex Moffat) joins them but is shocked at how the girl squad has changed. When he&apos;s filled in on how women have no more rights, he says, &quot;I heard a little something about that. I didn&apos;t know if it was like for sure happening. Is there a protest or something?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes! Several years ago,&quot; Zamata&apos;s Handmaid replies.</p>

<p>Moffat&apos;s bro sighs, &quot;I meant to go to that.&quot; </p>

<p>Finally, a bro soldier (Kyle Moony) arrives, &quot;Girl squad! This is going to sound awkward, but I have to take you to the government to torture you, but after that we&#x2019;re going to play tipsy putt-putt. You all should come through!&quot;</p>
