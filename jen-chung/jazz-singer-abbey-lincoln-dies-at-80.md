Long recognized as one of jazz&#x2019;s most arresting and uncompromising singers, Ms. Lincoln gained similar stature as a songwriter only over the last two decades... Her singing style was unique, a combined result of bold projection and expressive restraint.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407152652/http://www.npr.org/programs/jazzprofiles/archive/lincoln.html">NPR&apos;s profile of Lincoln</a> features Lincoln discussing her upbringing, work during the civil rights movement, and career and you can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150407152652/http://www.vervemusicgroup.com/artist/default.aspx?aid=2854">hear some of her music</a> at the Verve Music website.</p>
