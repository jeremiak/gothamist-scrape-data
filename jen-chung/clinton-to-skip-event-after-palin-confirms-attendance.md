<p><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20111117113852im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2008_09_hillsarah.jpg" class="left">It would have been the first time Senator Hillary Clinton and Alaska Governor Sarah Palin appeared together (for real, not <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111117113852/http://gothamist.com/2008/09/14/snl_is_back.php">for funny</a>).  But once Clinton learned that Palin would be attending the same rally at the U.N., organized by a number of Jewish groups to, per Newsday, &quot;show U.S. opposition to Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad,&quot; Clinton <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111117113852/http://www.newsday.com/news/local/politics/ny-usclin0918,0,1100449.story">decided she rather not go</a>.</p>

<p>Clinton spokesman Philippe Reines said, &quot;<strong>[Palin&apos;s] attendance was news to us, and this was never billed to us as a partisan political event. Senator Clinton will therefore not be attending</strong>,&quot; which gave the McCain-Palin camp a chance to say, &quot;<strong>Governor Palin believes that the danger of a nuclear Iran is greater than party or politics. </strong>She hopes that all parties can rally together in opposition to this grave threat.&quot;  </p>

<p>Some Democratic strategists <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111117113852/http://wcbstv.com/campaign08/sarah.palin.hillary.2.819890.html">think Clinton&apos;s decision was wrong</a>, noting how she has many Jewish constituents.  And City Councilman Dov Hikind said, &quot;This is not about politics. This is demonstration. This rally is about unity against Iran that is a sponsor of terrorism.&quot; </p>

<p>However, Newsday reports &quot;organizers admitted Wednesday they probably didn&apos;t think through the political implications of giving a platform to Palin or that Clinton&apos;s camp would see it as violating the nonpartisan spirit of the event.&quot;  An adviser to one of the sponsor groups said, &quot;We did not see that coming, but that may be right, and that&apos;s our mistake.&quot;  Organizers are reportedly considering whether to invite another Democrat to balance the event.</p>

<p>Additionally, Palin <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111117113852/http://www.nysun.com/national/sourcel-palin-to-attend-un-general-assembly/85997/">may attend the U.N. General Assembl</a>y--it&apos;ll be Barracuda in the City!</p>
