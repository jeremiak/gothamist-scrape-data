<p>The NYPD is giving &quot;special attention&quot; to NYC mosques after an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016011536/http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/29/americas/quebec-mosque-shooting/index.html">apparently &quot;coordinated attack&quot;</a> on a Canadian mosque has left six people dead and eight injured. </p>

<p>People were worshipping at the Centre Culturel Islamique de Qu&#xE9;bec in Quebec City last night when, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016011536/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/quebec-city-mosque-shooting-sainte-foy/article33821479/">the Globe and Mail reports</a>, &quot;two gunmen dressed in black and wearing ski masks walked into the mosque and started shooting. One man, who did not want to give his name, said he was in the mosque after the evening prayer when a man walked in and started shooting &apos;everything that was moving.&apos;&quot;</p>

<p>The survivor said, &quot;It was someone who mastered weapons because it was calm. He killed and he killed. It was really horrible.&quot;</p>

<p>Two men have been arrested so far, and the killings have been called a &quot;terrorist attack&quot; by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau:</p>

<p>Shortly after the incident, the NYPD released this statement: &quot;NYPD has directed special attention be given to all mosque/house-of-worship locations citywide. Critical Response Command (CRC) personnel have been assigned to extended tour coverage at certain mosque locations. The NYPD is monitoring the situation in Quebec.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016011536/https://twitter.com/NYCMayor/status/825903925916266497">Mayor Bill de Blasio also said</a>, &quot;Our prayers tonight are with the people of Quebec City as they deal with a terrible attack on a mosque. We must stand together,&quot; and Tweeted:</p>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The awful attack in Quebec is not an outlier. Today, a mosque in Texas was burned to the ground. We must stop those who seek to divide us. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016011536/https://t.co/8LklzkoltM">pic.twitter.com/8LklzkoltM</a></p>&#x2014; Bill de Blasio (@NYCMayor) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016011536/https://twitter.com/NYCMayor/status/825926191848759296">January 30, 2017</a></blockquote>
