<p>At an &quot;intimate&quot; lunch celebrating the premiere of his new film <em>Caf&#xE9; Society</em> at the Cannes Film Festival, Woody Allen spoke to a select group of film reporters. Inevitably, he addressed the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171030065034/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/my-father-woody-allen-danger-892572">scorching opinion piece</a> that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171030065034/http://gothamist.com/2016/05/11/woody_allen_sexual_assault_allegations.php">his son Ronan Farrow</a> just penned for the Hollywood Reporter, which asserts his father did sexually abuse his sister Dylan Farrow. Allen explained he had nothing to say, &quot;I never read anything about me.&quot;</p>

<p>Ronan Farrow&apos;s essay detailed how the media appeared to be complicit in allowing Allen to continue on without serious questioning about Dylan Farrow&apos;s insistence that he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171030065034/http://gothamist.com/2014/02/01/dylan_farrow_writes_open_letter_abo.php">sexually assaulted her when she was a young child</a>. So the few reporters who attended the lunch tried to remedy that. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171030065034/http://www.vulture.com/2016/05/woody-allen-on-ronan-farrow-cannes-rape-joke.html">Vulture&apos;s Kyle Buchanan wrote</a>, &quot;I sat at a table with Variety&apos;s Ramin Setoodeh and Vanity Fair&apos;s Julie Miller, among other reporters, and when Allen came to speak with us, it wasn&apos;t long before conversation turned to the controversy. Allen told Miller that he hasn&apos;t read Ronan Farrow&apos;s article.&quot;</p><blockquote>&quot;I never read anything about me,&quot; he demurred. &quot;Any of these interviews I do, anything. I said everything I had to say about that whole issue in the New York Times, I don&#x2019;t know if you read it, some time ago. I have moved so far past that. You know, I never think about it. I work, and that&#x2019;s the end of it for me. I said I was never gonna comment on it again because I could just go on endlessly.&quot;<p></p>

<p>When Setoodeh asked him if he planned to read the article, Allen continued to hold his ground. &quot;I never read anything,&quot; he said again. &quot;I never read what you say about me, or the reviews of my films. I made the decision 35 years ago to never read a review of my movies, never read an interview, never read anything. Because you could easily become obsessed with yourself ... I&#x2019;ve been very productive over the years by not thinking about myself, and not obsessing over myself.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But this isn&#x2019;t a critic,&quot; said Setoodeh. &quot;It&#x2019;s your son.&quot;</p>

<p>Allen shrugged. &quot;I&#x2019;ve said all I have to say about it.&quot;</p></blockquote>Ronan Farrow had also detailed how many media organizations seemed to dismiss his sister&apos;s claims because they do not want to anger Allen&apos;s powerful publicist and lose access to the relatively reclusive filmmaker. And proving that point, the Hollywood Reporter <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171030065034/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/cannes-woody-allen-says-he-893105">was apparently prohibited from the luncheon</a>: THR reached out to Dart to explain why she banned the publication from the event&#x2014;she responded: &apos;It&apos;s only natural that I would show displeasure when the press &#x2014;  this case, The Hollywood Reporter &#x2014; goes out of its way to be harmful to my client.&apos;&quot;<p></p>
