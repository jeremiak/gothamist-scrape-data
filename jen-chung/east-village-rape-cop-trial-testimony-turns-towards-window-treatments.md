<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2011_04_blinds.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110410045802im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2011_04_blinds.jpg" width="200" height="200" class="image-left"> </span>A friend and neighbor of an East Village woman who claims that two police officers raped her testified yesterday, saying that the alleged victim&apos;s windows&apos; blinds and curtain were shut, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110410045802/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2011/04/08/2011-04-08_second_witness_testifies_victim_says_she_was_raped_after_alleged_attack_by_polic.html">which was &quot;very unusual.&quot;</a>  Megan O&apos;Leary <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110410045802/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/blinds_sided_tVQfkWDAKrBDW1PC9PTTgM">explained that the blinds in the kitchen window</a>, which could be seen from a window in the stairwell, &quot;were always open so we could see each other in passing,&quot; but when she saw her friend after the alleged rape, &quot;the blinds were drawn and shut.&quot;  Also, her living room window curtains were closed, and they were usually tied back.</p>

<p>Police officers Kenneth Moreno and Franklin Mata are accused of raping the woman on December 7, 2008 after a cab driver called 911 to report an intoxicated passenger. Moreno, who allegedly raped the woman, and Mata, who is accused of acting as a lookout, were seen visited the woman&apos;s East VIllage apartment repeatedly over the course of a few hours.  At one point, they even <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110410045802/http://gothamist.com/2009/05/03/cops_made_fake_911_call_to_return_t.php">allegedly faked 911 call</a> so they could remain in the area.  </p>

<p>The accuser had been celebrating a job promotion at Southpaw in Brooklyn when she apparently became very intoxicated.  While O&apos;Leary testified the alleged victim <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110410045802/http://www.dnainfo.com/20110408/lower-east-side-east-village/friend-of-alleged-rape-cops-victim-notes-irregularities-at-womans-apartment-after-incident">didn&apos;t seem that intoxicated during the evening</a> (another friend said the accuser <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110410045802/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/06/witnesses_woman_allegedly_raped_by.php">was stumbling</a> there), she admitted she lost track of her friend and only saw her the next morning.  According to DNAinfo, O&apos;Leary said her friend was &quot;very upset&quot; and said she had been raped, saying, &quot;I can&apos;t believe this happened... I can&apos;t believe they did that.&quot;</p>

<p>The accuser is scheduled to testify on Monday, and the defense is seizing upon surveillance video <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110410045802/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/08/video_shown_in_rape_cop_trial_victi.php">showing her walk into her apartment building</a>&#x2014;with the cops following&#x2014;without any assistance to show she wasn&apos;t that intoxicated. Moreno&apos;s lawyer Joseph Tacopino, who has previously said his client <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110410045802/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/05/cop_didnt_rape_woman_merely_succume.php">only kissed her shoulder</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110410045802/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2011/04/08/surveillance-video-has-nypd-rape-trial-defense-salivating/">told WCBS 2</a>, &quot;Thank God for that videotape... If we didn&#x2019;t have that video, you would get the impression that she&#x2019;s being dragged into the building unconscious. And, uh, you know: picture says a thousand words I think I&#x2019;ve heard before.&#x201D;  Moreno admitted on a recording the accuser made (for the Manhattan DA&apos;s office) that he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110410045802/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/01/incriminating_tape_allowed_in_east.php">wore a condom</a> during their encounter (Tacopino has claimed he only said that so she wouldn&apos;t make a scene) and also offered to be her boyfriend if she stopped drinking.</p>

<p>The accuser <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110410045802/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/06/witnesses_woman_allegedly_raped_by.php">did vomit twice during the cab ride</a> from Brooklyn, and someone who saw her in the apartment building with the cops said that she <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110410045802/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/08/video_shown_in_rape_cop_trial_victi.php">appeared intoxicated</a>, though she was able to climb the stairs by herself. </p>
