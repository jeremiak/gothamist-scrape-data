<p>Many victims of Bernard Madoff&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160305151647/http://gothamist.com/2008/12/12/financial_advisors_50_billion_ponzi.php">$17 billion Ponzi scheme</a> will be getting payouts. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160305151647/http://abcnews.go.com/US/payback-bernie-madoff-ponzi-scheme-victims-1m/story?id=34585122">ABC News reports </a>that &quot;a majority of the people who had valid claims to being a Madoff victim&quot; will be getting about $1 million back.</p>

<p>The Securities Investors Protection Corporation (SIPC) CEO Stephen Harbeck told ABC News that &quot;anyone who invested up to $1,161,000 will &apos;be made completely whole&apos; in the latest round of distribution payments, per a new motion filed in a New York bankruptcy court today. Harbeck said that will affect a majority of the people who had valid claims to being a Madoff victim... For those who invested more, Harbeck said they could get back at least 61 cents on the dollar for their investments if their claim has been approved.&quot;</p>

<p>Harbeck said, &quot;Coming out of a Ponzi scheme with 61 percent of what you started out with is a major victory.&quot;</p>

<p>Apparently $11 billion of the fake investment fund was recovered, and ABC News says &quot;the biggest chunk [came] from the bank accounts of a deceased alleged co-conspirator of Madoff&#x2019;s, Jeffrey Picower. Picower&#x2019;s widow agreed to turn over $7.2 billion to the victims, virtually every dollar her husband made in the Madoff scheme - more than Madoff himself, officials said.&quot;</p>

<p>Madoff ran his Ponzi scheme for decades, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160305151647/http://gothamist.com/2008/12/14/madoffs_victims_range_from_big_firm.php">seducing investors big and small</a> with too-good-to-be-true returns (because they weren&apos;t true). For instance, one client got a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160305151647/http://gothamist.com/2009/05/13/lawsuit_filed_against_madoff_client.php">950% return on the investment</a>. He confessed in December 2008, setting in motion the sale of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160305151647/http://gothamist.com/2009/09/09/madoffs_penthouse_apartment_goes_on.php">his real estate</a>, investigations into f<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160305151647/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/29/peter_madoff_perp_walk_ponzi_scheme.php">amily members who worked</a> at the firm, and questions about the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160305151647/http://gothamist.com/2009/09/05/sec_releases_477-page_report_on_how.php">SEC which completely bungled concerns</a> about Madoff&apos;s firm. </p>

<p>Sentenced to 150 years in federal prison, Madoff has been behind bars as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160305151647/http://gothamist.com/2010/12/11/bernard_madoffs_son_mark_found_dead.php">one son committed suicide</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160305151647/http://gothamist.com/2014/09/03/andrew_madoff_bernard_madoffs_remai.php">another died of cancer</a>. Two films about him, one starring Richard Dreyfus and an HBO one with Robert De Niro, are in production.<br>
