<p>Aww, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120210201617/http://gothamist.com/2011/05/04/mike_tyson_pontificates_upon_pigeon.php">pigeon enthusiast</a> (seriously, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120210201617/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/12/mike_tyson_threw_his_first_punch_ov.php">man LOVES pigeons</a>) and sometime-actor Mike Tyson was seen enjoying the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120210201617/http://gothamist.com/2012/02/07/crowds_gather_for_giants_ticker_tap.php#photo-1">Giants&apos; ticker tape parade</a> yesterday.

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120210201617/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/mike-tyson-window-ritz-carlton-giants-fans-gather-downtown-article-1.1018892">Daily News reports</a>, &quot;The budding movie star made an unusual cameo before the start of Tuesday&#x2019;s Big Blue victory parade up the Canyon of Heroes. While several flatbed trucks carrying media members idled on West St. right outside the Ritz-Carlton Hotel, a familiar tattooed face suddenly appeared in one of the windows of a lower-level room.... Sure enough, when the man in the window turned his head, the familiar jagged tattoos around his left eye were visible in the sunlight. The Brooklyn-born Tyson waved a few times before another person in his hotel room shut the curtains. Perhaps Tyson didn&#x2019;t want anyone to see the tiger in his hotel room.&quot; Or disturb his singing of some classic Phil Collins!</p>
