He was rescued (in a paint can, thanks to construction workers) and eventually adopted into a loving home.  Now we hear that he&apos;s &quot;very, very cuddly and loves to play&quot;&#x2014;and he&apos;s much bigger now, but still cute and freckly (pictured).  If you&apos;re thinking about adding a furry friend to your household soon, head to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623142604/http://www.petfinder.com/shelters/emptycages.html">Empty Cages Collective adoption event</a> in Park Slope tomorrow&#x2014;there will be kittehs of all sizes.</p>
