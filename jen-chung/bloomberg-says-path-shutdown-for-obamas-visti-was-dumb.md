<p>So President Obama&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120618032525/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/15/obama_visits_1_wtc_thanks_construct.php">Commander-in-Chief-induced gridlock</a> is behind us, but Mayor Bloomberg is still sore about something.  Why <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120618032525/http://gothamist.com/2012/06/14/obama_in_town_today_for_1_world_tra.php">PATH train service</a> between NYC and NJ was shut down for the big cheese.</p>

<p>On his radio show with John Gambling this morning, Bloomberg seemed to be surprised that the PATH was shut down for the visit and said, &quot;The MTA kept the subways running, certainly.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120618032525/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20120615/financial-district/bloomberg-questions-path-shutdown-during-obama-visit">According to DNAinfo</a>, &quot;When Gambling noted that the Secret Service had requested the suspension, the mayor scoffed. &apos;You don&#x2019;t have to say yes. You know, this is our city,&apos; he said.&quot;</p>

<p>The Port Authority then scoffed at the Mayor; spokesman Steve Coleman explained, &quot;When dealing with the safety and security of the President of the United States and the First Lady, we follow the direction and recommendations of the U.S. Secret Service and the Port Authority Police Department.&quot;<br>
