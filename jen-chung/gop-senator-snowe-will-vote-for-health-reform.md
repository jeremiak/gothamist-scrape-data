During a Senate Finance Committee meeting, she said, &quot;Is this bill all that I would want? Far from it. Is it all that it can be? No. But when history calls, history calls... The mark before us produces some bipartisan landmark reforms. It bolsters what works in the system and engenders quality and competition.&quot;</p>
