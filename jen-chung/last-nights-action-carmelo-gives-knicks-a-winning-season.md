Anthony had 34 points in the victory over Indiana, even though he initially wanted to sit out of the game after injuring his wrist. But then &quot;I made a 3 and said, &#x2018;Na, don&#x2019;t worry about it.&apos;&quot; Amar&apos;e Stoudemire sat out for the second game with an ankle injury.<p></p>
