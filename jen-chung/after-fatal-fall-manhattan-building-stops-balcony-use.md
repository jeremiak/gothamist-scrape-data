                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> <img alt="2010_03_nytowers.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130804064858im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2010_03_nytowers.jpg" width="250" height="206" class="image-left"> </span>Yesterday morning, police say a man&apos;s body was discovered outside New York Tower, a 38-floor apartment building on 330 East 39th Street.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130804064858/http://www.ny1.com/1-all-boroughs-news-content/top_stories/115235/manhattan-man-falls-24-stories-from-balcony">According to NY1</a>, Connor Donohue, 24, fell to his death from the 24th floor, and now the Department of Buildings has ordered that that all residents should stop using the building&apos;s balconies.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130804064858/http://a810-bisweb.nyc.gov/bisweb/OverviewForComplaintServlet?requestid=2&amp;vlcompdetlkey=0001276269">complaint for the building says</a>, &quot;NYPD REPORTED A MAN LEANING ON A BALCONY RAIL FELL. THE RAIL GAVE WAY,&quot; and that the building was hit with a partial vacate order (&quot;FAILURE TO MAINTAIN BALCONIES AS PER CODE. STOP ALL USE OF ALL BALCONIES AND 3FL SETBACK, PROVIDE PE REPORT&quot;).  NY1 reports, &quot;Officials with the Department of Buildings say the fatal fall might have been caused by a faulty railing on the balcony. They say it appears the fencing and the post of the railing was loose and may have been damaged prior to the incident.&quot; </p>

<p>The building was ordered to investigate the stability of all balconies.  One resident told the station, &quot;I have no comment on how I feel about the building. I mean, if they knew then that&apos;s pretty bad, but they might not have known so. It&apos;s a pretty old building too so hopefully they&apos;ll just fix it for the future.&quot;</p>
