</div></div>					<p>If you&apos;ve spent three and a half hours <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110105419/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/03/us/politics/hillary-clinton-fbi-emails.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=first-column-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news&amp;_r=0">being interviewed by the FBI</a> in a probe that doesn&apos;t help your historic presidential campaign, obviously the only thing you can do afterwards is see the hottest show in Broadway history. And that&apos;s what Hillary Clinton did last night, heading to the Richard Rodgers Theatre to see <em>Hamilton</em>. And, yes, Bill &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110105419/http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/bill-clintons-bad-judgment">Just Watch Me Screw Up My Wife&apos;s Chances</a>&quot; Clinton came along, too. </p>

<p>This was not Clinton&apos;s first time seeing the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110105419/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/13/tonyw_2016_hamilton.php#photo-1">Tony- and</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110105419/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/18/lin-manuel_miranda_wins_pulitzer.php">Pulitzer Prize</a>-winning show: the Democratic presidential nominee, the former President and daughter Chelsea Clinton saw it at the Public Theatre <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110105419/http://www.playbill.com/article/a-presidential-performance-president-clinton-and-family-attend-broadway-bound-hamilton-at-the-public-com-343011">back in early 2015</a>. However, now that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110105419/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/09/bernie_sanders_hamilton.php">fellow <em>Hamilton</em> fan Bernie Sanders</a> is out of the way, Clinton is using the Broadway production as part of a huge fundraiser.</p>

<p>On July 12th, the cast is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110105419/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/hamilton-fundraise-hillary-clinton-additional-906388">putting on an extra show at 11:30 a.m. for Clinton&apos;s campaign</a>, offering tickets starting at $2,700 and going up to $100,000! She&apos;s also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110105419/https://www.hillaryclinton.com/forms/hamilton">offering a free ticket to a supporter</a>.</p>

<p>Still, the show&apos;s creator and star Lin-Manuel Miranda and other leading actors, Leslie Odom Jr. (who won a Tony for playing Aaron Burr) and Philippa Soo (nominated for a Tony as Hamilton&apos;s wife Eliza) are giving their final performances on July 9th (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110105419/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/02/hamilton_cast_change_hot_take.php">not that it matters</a>), so maybe the Clintons wanted to experience it one more time. It appears that Miranda&apos;s father, Luis Miranda Jr., and mother, Luz Towns-Miranda, hosted Clinton, as well as State Senator <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161110105419/http://gothamist.com/2016/06/29/espaillat_claims_victory.php">Adriano Espaillat</a> and City Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito:</p>
