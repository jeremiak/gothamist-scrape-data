Tomorrow, a new book about the sociopathic man and his family, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111101203636/http://www.hachettebookgroup.com/books_9780316198936.htm">Truth and Consequence</a>: Life Inside the Madoff Family, by Laurie Sandell&#x2014;with cooperation from his Ruth Madoff and son Andrew Madoff&#x2014;will be released.  Copies have been obtained in advance by media outlets&#x2014;the Associated Press <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111101203636/http://hosted2.ap.org/APDEFAULT/terms/Article_2011-10-27-People-Madoff/id-e6b39abe539244b49dda674534e2e587">got one on Thursday</a> and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111101203636/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/meet_the_worst_family_on_earth_AxKrZplAx3m8CnZiRQNlHK?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=">Post found one</a>.  Revelations include how Madoff was obsessed with making sure his office blinds were perfectly lined up, he sent his son a suicidal-seeming text message, and he was a real charmer with his son&apos;s fiancee.</p>

<p>The Post describes Madoff&apos;s straightforward social skills:</p><blockquote>As a family, the Madoffs were like a club, impenetrable and distrusting of outsiders. When son Andrew&#x2019;s future fianc&#xE9;e, Catherine Hooper, met his parents for the first time at his brother Mark&#x2019;s 44th birthday party in 2008, she was greeted strangely by Bernie.<p></p>

<p>&#x201C;I want you to know that he&#x2019;s not from money, despite what you see. I know you think he&#x2019;s a rich guy, but we&#x2019;re from nothing. My father was broke. We&#x2019;re humble people,&#x201D; he said.</p>

<p>&#x201C;If you&#x2019;re here for money -- think again.&#x201D;</p>

<p>...And one day, when Ruth, Andrew, Catherine and Bernie were lounging on the yacht, he complimented Catherine&#x2019;s body, adding, &#x201C;But she could have been heavier on top.&#x201D; Ruth and Andrew pretended not to hear.</p></blockquote>Madoff also screamed at Hooper for leaving her new Dior purse on a table on Madoff&apos;s yacht, &#x201C;The bottom of your bag has round metal feet on it! If the boat moves, those feet are going to leave a mark on the table.&quot;  It&apos;s unclear how Madoff feels about scuff marks on the furniture in federal prison, where he is serving a 150-year sentence (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111101203636/http://gothamist.com/2011/10/27/bernard_madoff_understands_why_clie.php">he does like it there</a>, though, and maybe the feds have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111101203636/http://www.theonion.com/articles/federal-government-to-reduce-madoffs-sentence-if-h,26390/">some other ideas for him</a>).<p></p>

<p>The book also has Andrew Madoff claiming he wanted to leave the firm, but his father laid a huge guilt trip: &quot;In hindsight, it&#x2019;s obvious that the fact that we were there provided cover. He used us as a shield ... Maybe the people at the firm who were in on it would have panicked if they&#x2019;d seen us jumping ship.&quot;</p>

<p>Andrew Madoff and Catherine Hooper <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111101203636/http://abcnews.go.com/Business/madoff-family-company-offers-disaster-plans-wealthy/story?id=13196234">now run a &quot;high-end disaster management&quot; firm</a>.  Andrew Madoff and other relatives were accused of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111101203636/http://gothamist.com/2009/10/02/finally_madoffs_sons_brother_niece.php">using his father&apos;s company as a personal piggy bank</a>&#x2014;Andrew Madoff specifically is alleged to have take $60 million in ill-gotten gains. </p>
