<p>Right after President Donald Trump fired FBI Director James Comey on Tuesday, NBC News anchor Lester Holt <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170517034232/http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/trump-reveals-he-asked-comey-whether-he-was-under-investigation-n757821">interviewed the president,</a> who complained, &quot;[Comey&apos;s] a showboat, he&apos;s grandstander, the FBI has been in turmoil.&quot; For its cold open, Saturday Night Live offered up part two of the interview, with Alec Baldwin&apos;s Trump admitting, &quot;I fired [Comey] because of Russia. I thought, he&#x2019;s investigating Russia, I don&#x2019;t like that, I should fire him.&quot;</p>

<p>Holt, played by Michael Che, responded, &quot;You&apos;re admitting that? But that&apos;s obstruction of justice... Did I get him? Is this all over?&quot; Then &quot;Holt&quot; finds out from a producer, &quot;No I didn&apos;t? Nothing matters? Absolutely nothing matters anymore?&quot;</p>

<p>Trump, played by Baldwin, even confessed, &quot;I tape a lot of people. I tape whoever I want, whenever I want. Some people have called me a serial tape-ist and it&apos;s true, I am.&quot;</p>

<p>Before Baldwin&apos;s Trump launched into his discussion about Comey, he said, &quot;I won this election fair and square... It&apos;s one of my favorite hits, and my fans love when I play the hits. It&apos;s like when you go to a Beyonc&#xE9; concert&#x2014;they want to hear only &apos;Single Ladies&apos; and not that &apos;Sandcastles&apos; crap, OK?&quot;</p>

<p>There was a cameo from House Speaker Paul Ryan, played by Mikey Day, wearing an ice cream shoppe worker uniform, to offer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170517034232/http://www.cnn.com/2017/05/11/politics/trump-time-magazine-ice-cream/">two scoops of ice cream</a> to &quot;Trump,&quot; who later discussed inventing the phrase <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170517034232/http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/05/trump-explains-economics-to-the-economist-hilarity-ensues.html">&quot;priming the pump.&quot;</a> But Che&apos;s Holt brought it back to Comey&apos;s dismissal, asking that the president, &quot;Can you just reassure us all that you&apos;re not going to pick someone crazy like Judge Judy&quot; to replace Comey.</p>

<p>&quot;I can promise you this right now, whoever I chose is going to be so bonkers you&#x2019;re going to wish like hell it was Judge Judy, okay?&quot; Baldwin&apos;s Trump replied. </p>

<p>Then &quot;Holt&quot; begged him to think about the optics, &quot;Every single day, it&apos;s something nuts. Your presidency is like the craziest show on TV and it&apos;s on 24 hours a day. We can&apos;t keep up.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Too bad because this show is going to run for eight years&#x2014;even though it should have been canceled months ago,&quot; Baldwin as Trump said. &quot;We have plenty of fun plot twists coming up. A lot of your favorite characters will be coming back ... Kim Jong un, Carter Page ... I don&#x2019;t want to give away too much, but in an upcoming episode we will find out that Kellyanne has been dead this whole time.&quot;</p>
