But <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120529120402/http://www.northjersey.com/news/crime_courts/149561605_Nutley_police__Child_burns_in_tanning_booth.html">Nutley, NJ police arrested her</a> for child endangerment because a school nurse found little Anna with a severe sunburn&#x2014;and Anna said &quot;I went tanning with Mommy.&quot;<p></p>

<p>Krentcil, 44, says that her daughter got burned from playing outside and clarified that the fair-skinned child does go to the salon but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120529120402/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2012/05/01/nj-mom-accused-of-putting-6-year-old-daughter-in-tanning-bed/">doesn&apos;t actually tan</a> on the tanning bed: &quot;She&#x2019;s 6 years old. Yes, she does go tanning with mommy, but not in the booth.&quot; GET IT?  Further, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120529120402/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/NJ-Mother-Arrested-Daughter-Tanning-Booth-Girl-5-Burns-Body-Nutley-149738155.html">she told NBC New York</a>, &quot;It&apos;s like taking your daughter to go food shopping. There&apos;s tons of moms that bring their children in.&quot;</p>

<p>The frustrated mother, who was released on $25,000 bail, said she&apos;s been going to the tanning salon for 10 years and never before have her visits been called into question, &quot;My daughter&apos;s a beautiful girl who loves school, who had to go through this, and I think it&apos;s traumatizing for a little girl who did nothing wrong but got a little sunburned.&quot;  And she admitted, &quot;I&#x2019;ve been tanning my whole life, going to the beach, tanning salons and so forth.&quot;</p>

<p>In NJ, children under 14 are not allowed to use tanning beds/booths.  For children between the ages of 14 and 17, they may do so with written parental consent. The Bergen Record also reports that the &quot;Camden County Sheriff&apos;s Department wanted Krentcil on unrelated charges.&quot;</p>

<p><b>Update</b>: The tanning salon owner thinks that Krentcil <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120529120402/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/02/tanorexic_nj_mom_tans_about_20_days.php">has been using self-tanner</a>.</p>
