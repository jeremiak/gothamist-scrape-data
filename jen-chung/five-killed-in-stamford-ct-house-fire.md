Two adults escaped, but the fire was so consuming that firefighters were unable to reach other occupants in time. A neighbor said, &quot;We heard this screaming at 5 in the morning. The whole house was ablaze and I mean ablaze.&quot; He <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170316032026/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/26/nyregion/house-fire-kills-5-in-stamford.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">told the Times</a>, &quot;The flames were coming through the top floor, and I thought, &#x2018;Nobody could possibly survive this.&#x2019;&quot;<br>

She has three children.&quot;  </p>
