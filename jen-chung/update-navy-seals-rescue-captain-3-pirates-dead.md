Bainbridge and &quot;was then flown by helicopter to another Navy ship, and has contacted his family and received a routine medical examination,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130928020423/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/13/world/africa/13pirates.html?hp">according to the NY Times</a>.<p></p>

<p>The Maersk line spoke on behalf of the captain&apos;s family, &#x201C;This is truly a very happy Easter for the Phillips family. They are all just so happy and relieved.&#x201D; And President Obama said was happy that Phillips was rescued and called his courage was a &quot;model for all Americans&quot;.</p>
