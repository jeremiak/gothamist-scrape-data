The duo wrote songs like &quot;Ain&apos;t No Mountain High Enough&quot;, &quot;You&apos;re All I Need To Get By&quot;, &quot;Ain&apos;t Nothing Like the Real Thing&quot;, &quot;Reach Out and Touch (Somebody&apos;s Hand),&quot; &quot;I&apos;m Every Woman,&quot; and, their hit, &quot;Solid.&quot;<p></p>

<p>His &quot;longtime friend and former publicist Liz Rosenberg&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111124165001/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2011/08/22/ap/entertainment/main20095752.shtml">spoke to the AP</a> and said he died in NYC hospital; &quot;he had been suffering from throat cancer and had undergone radiation treatment.&quot;  The couple owned a West 72nd Street restaurant and bar, Sugar Bar, and this past May, Simpson serenaded Ashford for his birthday:</p>

<p>Ashford, who was born in 1942 in South Carolina, met Simpson while they were in the choir at Harlem&apos;s White Rock Baptist Church in 1963.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111124165001/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashford_%26_Simpson">According to Wikipedia</a>, &quot;They started their career in the mid-1960s, writing for artists such as The 5th Dimension (&quot;California Soul&quot;), Aretha Franklin (&quot;Cry Like A Baby&quot;), and Ray Charles (&quot;Let&apos;s Go Get Stoned&quot; and &quot;&apos;I Don&apos;t Need No Doctor&quot;). Their work with Charles brought them to the attention of Motown chief Berry Gordy. Joining the Motown staff in 1966, Ashford &amp; Simpson were paired with the vocal duo of Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell, and they wrote and/or produced all but one of the late-1960s Gaye/Terrell singles, including hits such as the original version of &quot;Ain&apos;t No Mountain High Enough&quot;, &quot;Your Precious Love&quot;, &quot;Ain&apos;t Nothing Like the Real Thing&quot;, and &quot;You&apos;re All I Need to Get By.&quot;&quot;  </p>
