<p>Earlier today, the Georgia State Board of Pardons and Paroles <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111125144756/http://www.ajc.com/news/atlanta/board-says-it-thoroughly-1184933.html">refused to grant Troy Davis clemency</a>, setting in motion Davis&apos; execution by lethal injection tomorrow night.  Tonight, an &quot;emergency demonstration&quot; will be held at Zucotti Park (aka Liberty Plaza) at 4:30, organized by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111125144756/http://www.iacenter.org/">International Action Center which notes</a>, &quot;Zucotti Park is the site, located off Broadway a few blocks north of Wall Street, of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111125144756/http://gothamist.com/tags/occupywallstreet">Occupy Wall Street encampment</a>, a protest against Wall Street&apos;s war on the poor.  That makes it the place to be for protest against the racist execution of Troy Davis.&quot;  Also, signs and placards will be available.</p>

<p>Davis was found guilty of killing an off-duty police officer in 1989.  However, numerous witnesses have recanted their testimony and there&apos;s little physical evidence.  Last Saturday, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111125144756/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/17/us/supporters-rally-to-save-troy-davis-from-execution-in-georgia.html?pagewanted=all">NY Times looked at the groundswell of support</a> to stop Davis&apos; execution&#x2014;much of it driven by social media&#x2014;and one supporter, cookbook author Nancie McDermott, said, &quot;I think if my brother or son or dear friend from college were about to be put to death, and there was no physical evidence, and seven of nine witnesses had recanted and testified to coercion in that original testimony, would I shrug and say, &#x2018;The jury made its decision?&#x2019; I just want people, particularly all the churchgoing people like me, to look me in the eye and tell me, just once, that this is justice.&quot;</p>

<p>Off-duty cop Mark Allen MacPhail was working a security detail (his second job) in a Savannah parking lot, when he was shot while trying to help a homeless man who had been pistol-whipped.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111125144756/http://www.ajc.com/news/atlanta/board-says-it-thoroughly-1184933.html">His family believes that Davis is guilty</a> and has asked the parole board to go ahead with the execution for closure.  However, this is the fourth time Davis&apos;s execution has been scheduled and MacPhail&apos;s mother said, &quot;We&apos;ve been here three times before. This is our fourth time [to face an execution date] so you get kind of weary of it and [I] don&#x2019;t know if I can believe this. We are ready to close this book and start our lives. This has been a long haul.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111125144756/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/21/us/troy-davis-is-denied-clemency-in-georgia.html">MacPhail&apos;s widow also said</a>, &quot;He has had ample time to prove his innocence, and he is not innocent. We have laws in this land so that there is not chaos. We are not killing Troy because we want to. We&#x2019;re trying to execute him because he was punished.&quot;</p>

<p>The Georgia State Board of Pardons and Paroles said, &quot;The board members have not taken their responsibility lightly and certainly understand the emotions attached to a death penalty case. [The board] considered the totality of the information presented in this case and thoroughly deliberated on it, after which the decision was to deny clemency.&quot;</p>

<p>Davis&apos;s lawyers are looking at other options.</p>
