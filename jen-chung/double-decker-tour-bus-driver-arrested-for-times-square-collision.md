William Dalambert, 58, was charged with driving while his ability was impaired.</p>

<p>Apparently Dalambert, who was driving the red Gray Line bus, &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510014947/http://7online.com/traffic/dwai-charges-in-times-square-double-decker-bus-crash/242563/">sideswiped a GMC Yukon and a CitySights bus before ending up the on the sidewalk</a>.&quot; The blue CitySights bus was parked at the time.</p>

<p>A total of 15 people were injured, five by the traffic light that fell after the Gray Line bus struck it. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510014947/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/06/nyregion/double-decker-buses-collide-in-times-square.html?ref=nyregion&amp;_r=0">One man told the NY Times</a> he was walking away when he heard &quot;something falling from the sky... We raced across the street. A man on the ground said he could not feel his leg.&quot; The traffic light also nearly hit a child in a stroller.</p>

<p>The injures were not life-threatening, but the Gray Line tour guide&apos;s head was trapped under the dashboard. The FDNY said, &quot;We are very, very fortunate there weren&apos;t many more injuries.&quot;</p>
