<p>Police are looking for a man who allegedly stabbed a girl who was walking to school earlier today in Whitestone, Queens. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160427030902/http://nypost.com/2015/12/16/madman-slashes-teenage-girl-on-her-way-to-school/">The girl&apos;s aunt said</a>, &quot;It was so deep &#x2026; there was so much blood.&quot; [<b>Update</b>: Police released surveillance video of the attacker; see it below.]</p>

<p>According to the NYPD, the incident occurred just after 8 a.m. at 147th Street and 13th Avenue, a residential street. The 16-year-old victim was approached by a man who pushed and then stabbed her in the left cheek and neck. </p>

<p>NYPD Chief of Detectives <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160427030902/http://abc7ny.com/news/police-16-year-old-girl-slashed-while-on-way-to-school-in-queens/1124866/">Robert Boyce said</a>, &quot;It came out of nowhere.&quot;</p>

<p>The girl, who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160427030902/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2015/12/16/queens-girl-slashed-in-face/">moved from China eight months ago</a> and attends Whitestone Academy, then went to her home nearby and called 911. Her aunt told the Post, &quot;This is terrible. She was on the way to school, only an eight-minute walk, when she was attacked. She was carrying a cup of hot chocolate. The guy ran off and dropped the box cutter.&quot; She added her niece was in terrible shape, &quot;My daughter could barely look at her, it was so deep. We hope he gets caught.&quot;</p>

<p>The victim was taking to LIJ Hospital, where she is in stable condition. Police retrieved a boxcutter from the street:</p>
