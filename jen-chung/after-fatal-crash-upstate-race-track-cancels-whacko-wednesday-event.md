<p>Two days after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510014827/http://gothamist.com/2014/08/10/nascars_tony_stewart_fatally_hits_d.php">fatally striking another driver</a> during an upstate New York dirt track race, NASCAR driver Tony Stewart has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510014827/http://www.si.com/nascar/2014/08/11/tony-stewart-nascar-racer-dirt-track">pulled out of another dirt track race</a> scheduled for this weekend. Organizers at the Plymouth Speedway in Indiana said, &quot;Tony Stewart will NOT be racing at Plymouth Speedway this Saturday,&quot; and added that they &quot;extend our deepest condolences and prayers to the family of Kevin Ward, Jr. and thoughts and prayers to Tony Stewart and his family.&quot;</p>

<p>Ward, 20, was killed by Stewart&apos;s car on Saturday night at Canandaigua Motorsports Park. Ward had gotten out of his car and pointed at Stewart. Ward&apos;s friend, Tyler Graves, saw the confrontation unfold and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510014827/http://www.sportingnews.com/nascar/story/2014-08-10/tony-stewart-sprint-car-hits-driver-fight-incident-trouble-investigation-new-york-watkins-glen-kevin-ward">told the Sporting News</a>:</p><blockquote>&quot;Tony pinched him into the frontstretch wall, a racing thing,&quot; Graves said. &quot;The right rear tire went down, he spun on the exit of (Turn) 2. They threw the caution and everything was toned down. Kevin got out of his car. &#x2026; He was throwing his arms up all over the place at Tony for most of the corner.<p></p>

<p>&quot;I know Tony could see him. I know how you can see out of these cars. When Tony got close to him, he hit the throttle. When you hit a throttle on a sprint car, the car sets sideways. It set sideways, the right rear tire hit Kevin, Kevin was sucked underneath and was stuck under it for a second or two and then it threw him about 50 yards.&quot;</p></blockquote>Stewart has been cooperating with the authorities and has been interviewed twice. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510014827/http://www.timesunion.com/news/crime/article/As-probe-begins-Stewart-steps-away-from-the-track-5680595.php">The Times Union reports</a>, &quot;On Sunday, Ontario County Sheriff Philip Povero said that investigators also don&apos;t have any evidence at this point in the investigation to support criminal intent. But he also said that criminal charges have not been ruled out.&quot;<p></p>

<p>A former state and federal prosecutor told the Times Union, &quot;I think even with the video, it&apos;s going to be tough to prove that this was more than just an accident and that it was even culpable negligence, which he should&apos;ve known or should&apos;ve believed that by getting close to this guy, that it was going to cause the accident.&quot; Stewart released a statement yesterday afternoon, &quot;There aren&apos;t words to describe the sadness I feel about the accident that took the life of Kevin Ward Jr. It&apos;s a very emotional time for all involved, and it is the reason I&apos;ve decided not to participate in today&apos;s race at Watkins Glen. My thoughts and prayers are with his family, friends and everyone affected by this tragedy.&quot;</p>

<p>Canandaigua Motorsports Park cancelled its &quot;Whacko Wednesday&quot; event, and promoter Jeremie Cochran said in a statement, &quot;First and foremost I offer my sincerest and deepest condolences to the Ward family. Kevin Ward Jr was a spirited competitor and loved by so many. This is a tremendous loss to this family and the racing family as well. I have spoken to the family and they spent prayer time at the track Sunday in the early morning hours. Godspeed #13!&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510014827/https://www.facebook.com/CMP.Racing">He added</a>, &quot;I had to have our Facebook Page taken down early Sunday morning due to insensitive and hateful comments. I plead with you to be respectful so we can keep this page active for you to keep informed.&quot;</p>
