<p>Last night, Christie&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150826055321/http://gothamist.com/2012/05/08/rotho_pollock_de_kooning_paintings.php#photo-2">auction of postwar and contemporary art</a> hit record numbers, led by sale of the 1961 Mark Rothko painting &quot;Orange, Red, Yellow&quot; for $86.9 million. That payout for the  93&quot; x 81&#xBC;&quot; painting shattered the 2007 price paid for the 81&quot; by 55.5&quot; Rothko, &quot;White Center,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150826055321/http://gothamist.com/2007/05/16/rothko.php">which David Rockefeller sold for $72.8 million</a>. What recession!?</p>

<p>Christie&apos;s had estimated that the 59 paintings sold last night would sell for a high of $330 million, but with works from Rothko, Jackson Pollock, Gerhard Richter, Barnett Newman, and Alexander Calder, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150826055321/http://www.christies.com/sales/post-war-contemporary-new-york-may-2012/evening-sale.aspx">sale brought in $388.5 million</a>, 59-lot sale. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150826055321/http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-05-09/rothko-painting-sells-for-record-86-9-million.html">Bloomberg News points out</a>, &quot;It exceeded Christie&#x2019;s $384.7 million tally in May 2007, the previous contemporary auction champ.&quot;  A New York dealer said, &quot;Billionaires have gone global. It&#x2019;s very healthy for the market, obviously.&quot;</p>

<p>Pollock&#x2019;s &quot;Number 28&quot; from 1951, sold for $23 million (including fees), which was a record price for a Pollock.  And Newman&apos;s &quot;Onement V&quot; sold for $22.4 million, well above its $10-15 million estimate and a record for a Newman.  The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150826055321/http://www.christies.com/about/press-center/releases/pressrelease.aspx?pressreleaseid=5553">auction also resulted in records</a> for artists, like Gerhard Richter and Alexander Calder. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150826055321/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/09/arts/design/rothko-painting-sells-for-record-nearly-87-million-at-christies.html?_r=1&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;ref=arts&amp;adxnnlx=1336573253-/XxvOi1CMWf+BY9bR22Vfg">NY Times reports</a>, &quot;Fresh material from celebrated collections made the difference. But beyond that, as Marc Porter, chairman of Christie&#x2019;s, put it, &apos;this is the most popular collecting category we have globally, with the richest and deepest number of buyers.&apos;&quot;</p>

<p>Another dealer told Bloomberg News, &quot;I&#x2019;ve never seen people wanting to shop so badly. People didn&#x2019;t want to be under-bidders. They wanted to win.&quot;</p>
