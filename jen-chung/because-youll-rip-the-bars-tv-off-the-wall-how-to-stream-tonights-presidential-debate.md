<p>Here we are: Two days after Donald Trump revealed (in 2005) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016013707/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/07/trump_what_this_time_oh_god.php">his sexual assault secrets</a>, less than 30 days until the presidential election and hours before the second debate between Trump and Hillary Clinton. While tonight&apos;s town hall-style meeting has the makings of a great showdown perfect for watching in a bar or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016013707/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/07/whats_all_this_about_a_new_way.php">movie theater</a> with others, it&apos;s okay if you want to be alone because you&apos;re worried about Trump&apos;s trash-talking (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016013707/https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/785106800572063744">see this Tweet</a>) or you do your best shimmying at home&#x2014;there are many ways to stream the debate.</p>

<p>Via LAist, these are Twitter accounts to follow: &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016013707/https://twitter.com/PolitiFact">@PolitiFact</a> for their instant fact-checks, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016013707/https://twitter.com/MerriamWebster">@MerriamWebster</a> for their gloriously snarky live definitions, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016013707/https://twitter.com/sosadtoday?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">@SoSadToday</a> for general (non-election related) existential ennui.&quot; </p>

<p>If you want an alternative to the debate, because you&apos;ll just get the Hot Takes later, we highly recommend Ava DuVernay&apos;s excellent documentary, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016013707/https://www.netflix.com/title/80091741"><em>The 13th</em> which is streaming on Netflix</a>, which looks at mass incarceration and decades of systemic racism. The New Yorker&apos;s Richard Brody <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016013707/http://www.newyorker.com/goings-on-about-town/movies/13th">calls it</a> &quot;brilliantly analytical and morally passionate.&quot; Or, check out <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016013707/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/06/best_political_docs_streaming_2016.php">any of these</a> fine streaming political documentaries.</p>
