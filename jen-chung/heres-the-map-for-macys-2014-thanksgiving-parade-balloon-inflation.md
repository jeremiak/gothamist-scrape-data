<p>You can watch the team from Macy&apos;s Thanksgiving Day Parade get the huge character balloons ready on Wednesday night on the Upper West Side.  Sure there&apos;s a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510011506/http://gothamist.com/2014/11/24/thanksgiving_travel_hell.php">Nor&apos;easter on the way</a>, but that&apos;ll just make it more exciting, right? </p>

<p>There are six new balloons this year: Paddington Bear (he has a new movie coming out); a new Pikachu ballon; the PIllsbury Doughboy; Red Mighty Morphin Power Ranger; lava spewing Skylanders Eruptor; and the beloved Thomas the Tank Engine. </p>

<p>The balloons will come to life outside of the American Museum of Natural History starting at 3 p.m.: You enter at West 79th and Columbus Avenue and enter the viewing area which takes you south to West 77th, then east to Central Park West, and then up CPW to West 81st Street.</p>

<p>Old guard balloons are Adventure Time with Finn &amp; Jake; Diary of A Wimpy Kid; The Elf on the Shelf; Hello Kitty; Papa Smurf; Ronald McDonald; Snoopy and Woodstock; Spider-Man; SpongeBob SquarePants; and Toothless of How to Train Your Dragon. Plus, there are new <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510011506/http://web.wm.edu/americanstudies/370/2005F/sp4/home_paradefeatures_other.htm">balloonicles</a>!</p>

<p>if you go, it&apos;s a fun <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510011506/http://gothamist.com/2013/11/27/photos_video_pikachu_hello_kitty_an.php">but crowded time</a>.</p>
