You could hear things breaking, almost like glass breaking.&quot; Another said the plane &quot;almost tipped over.&quot; See video of the collision below&#x2014;the Bombardier nearly rotates 90 degrees!<p></p>

<p>A third Delta passenger told the News, &quot;The plane was rocking, first to the right, then to the left.&quot; The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509165114/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbus_A380">Airbus A380</a> is the largest passenger airliner in the world, holding over 500 passengers; the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509165114/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombardier_CRJ700_series">Bombardier CRJ-700</a> is a commuter plane that holds about 70 passengers.  So for someone on the A380, the collision felt differently&#x2014;CNN correspondent Jim Bitterman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509165114/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local/new_york&amp;id=8066927">was on the Air France flight</a>,  &quot;It felt to me like maybe they hit a rough patch of pavement or something like that. But the pilots immediately stopped the plane, and within I would say a minute or two, the fire trucks started arriving around the plane.&quot; </p>

<p>Luckily, there were no injuries on either planes.   Both planes were grounded and the FAA will be investigating the damage.  </p>

<p>And here&apos;s audio of the air traffic controllers and pilots&#x2014;the Delta plane said, &#x201C;All emergency trucks we&#x2019;ve been hit by Air France. Once again all emergency equipment call 33 evacuate Alpha and Mike.&#x201D;</p>
