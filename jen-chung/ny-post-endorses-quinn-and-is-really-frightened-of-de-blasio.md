title: NY Post Endorses Quinn And Is Really Frightened Of De Blasio

                            <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"> </span></p><div class="image-none"> <img alt="2013_08_quinnbloom.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20131006152046im_/http://gothamist.com/attachments/jen/2013_08_quinnbloom.jpg" width="640" height="427"> <br> <i> Bloomberg and Quinn in 2010 (Getty Images)</i></div> <p></p>

<p>After the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131006152046/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/22/daily_news_endorses_bloomberg_erm_q.php">Daily News</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131006152046/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/25/times_endorses_quinn_for_mayor.php">Times</a> weighed on the Democratic mayoral race in the past few days, the NY Post has finally gone and endorsed City Council Speaker Christine Quinn. But don&apos;t get the Post wrong&#x2014;all three of the Democratic frontrunners (Quinn, Public Advocate Bill de Blasio and former Comptroller Bill Thompson) pretty much stink, but Quinn&apos;s the least offensive to the conservative tabloid&apos;s sensibilities. </p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131006152046/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/ny_can_go_back_to_bad_old_days_AFBbYTi7m5Px2gMmckG7wM?utm_source=SFnewyorkpost&amp;utm_medium=SFnewyorkpost">Post writes</a>:</p><blockquote>If we were seeing today the Chris Quinn that we saw a few years ago, this would be a more enthusiastic endorsement. As speaker, Quinn often showed courage and responsibility by siding with Mayor Bloomberg, as well as by opposing the dangerous proposals of her far more radical council members.<p></p>

<p>Ever since her mayoral campaign kicked in, however, she has lurched hard to the left, embracing the kind of ridiculous nostrums for which she had previously shown considerable and rightful contempt.</p>

<p>A perfect example: the ill-advised mandatory paid sick-leave bill, which for years she courageously refused to bring to a council vote, only to reverse herself last spring when she was sharply criticized by her mayoral opponents and the unions.</p>

<p>Similarly, she first declared unconditionally she would retain Ray Kelly as police commissioner. Then she made her proposal for an NYPD inspector general, a new and unnecessary layer of oversight. That turned the race into a referendum on the police, and stop-and-frisk came under withering political attack. Hard to imagine Ray Kelly would take her up on the job offer now.</p></blockquote>But Thompson and de Blasio are radioactive to the Post in their own ways: Thompson has support from the United Federation of Teachers (the Post HATES the UFT) and de Blasio will tax rich people and turn NYC into Detroit, &quot;De Blasio is so far out of the mainstream that even the thought of him as mayor should frighten every New Yorker. <strong>A de Blasio mayoralty would be an express train right back to the bad old days of the 1970s.</strong>&quot;<p></p>

<p>On the Republican side, the Post also endorses Joe Lhota, even though &quot;has fallen short in articulating a compelling and passionate message that makes clear what is at stake in this election.&quot;<br>
