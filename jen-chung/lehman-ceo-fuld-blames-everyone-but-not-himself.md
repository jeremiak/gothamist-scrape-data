<p>Richard &quot;Dick&quot; Fuld, the CEO who led the once-storied Lehman Brothers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170427081314/http://gothamist.com/2008/09/15/panic_on_wall_street_lehman_files_f.php">into bankruptcy</a>, was defensive when <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170427081314/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5gdEcjmRX-8TBixxBcvwI2O8N3pLw">questioned by the House Oversight Committee yesterday</a>.  The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170427081314/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/07/business/economy/07lehman.html">NY Times reports</a> he &quot;blamed the news media. He blamed the short-sellers. He blamed the government, as well as what he characterized as an &apos;extraordinary run on the bank.&apos;&quot; but &quot;<strong>never really blamed himself</strong>.&quot;  Fuld did take responsibility for the collapse, and said he&apos;d wonder for the rest of his life how he could have done something differently.</p>

<p>Regarding fat cat pay, when Chair Henry Waxman asked him, &quot;You&apos;ve been able to pocket close to half a billion dollars [since 2000] and my question to you is that fair for a CEO of a company that&apos;s now bankrupt? It&apos;s just unimaginable to so many people,&quot; Fuld said, &quot;I think for the years you&apos;re talking about here<strong> I believe my cash compensation was close to 60 million and the amount I took out of the company over and above that was closer to 250 million. Still a large number though.</strong>&quot;  </p>

<p>Additionally, journalist Vicky Ward <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170427081314/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/financetopics/financialcrisis/3150319/Richard-Fuld-punched-in-face-in-Lehman-Brothers-gym.html">confirmed that Fuld had been punched</a> in the face last month, citing two sources (see <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170427081314/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/10/06/lehmans-richard-fuld-punc_n_132360.html">video of Ward on CNBC</a>).  On September 22, Dealbreaker had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170427081314/http://www.dealbreaker.com/2008/09/dick-fuld-spotting.php">posted some rumors</a> about Fuld being hurt in some way (run over by a cab, panic attack)--&quot;Dick Fuld had audacity to use the Lehman gym [on Sunday] and got punched in the face.&quot;</p>

<p>Today, AIG executives will speak to the committee.</p>
