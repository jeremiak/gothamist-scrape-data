An officer from Westchester County chased the man from Pelham Manor into the Bronx, after spotting him on the 4-wheeler.&quot;  Witnesses say the victim, Wardell Johnson, 43, had been in a &quot;violent struggle&quot; with the cop.  <p></p>

<p>Apparently Johnson had bought the ATV in Connecticut for his son and was driving it home to Harlem.  The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151106194651/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2010/10/13/2010-10-13_pelham_manor_cop_kills_atv_rider_in_bronx.html">Daily News reports</a> that the Westchester cop &quot;tried to pull him over in Westchester County about 6 p.m... The pursuit continued into the Bronx, where the yellow ATV ran out of gas near Baychester Ave., cops and witnesses said. That&apos;s when the Harlem mechanic hopped off the unregistered ATV and ran away, cops and witnesses said.&quot;  </p>

<p>The cop<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151106194651/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2010/10/12/atv-chase-leads-to-bronx-police-involved-shooting/"> reportedly tried to subdue</a> Johnson with his expandable baton and Mace in the backyard of a house on Edson, but ultimately shot him.  WPIX adds, &quot;Police are speculating that the man may have attempted to take the police officer&apos;s gun.&quot;  </p>

<p>Johnson&apos;s father told the News, &quot;He never owned a gun. I can&apos;t see no reason shooting him.&quot; The News also reports, &quot;Johnson has prior arrests that include DWI, possession of marijuana and driving without a license.&quot;</p>
