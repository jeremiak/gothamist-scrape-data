<p>After Kentucky Derby and Preakness champion <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150610012527/http://laist.com/2014/06/07/california_chrome_triple_crown_0607.php">California Chrome lost</a> his bid <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150610012527/http://gothamist.com/2014/06/07/california_chrome_will_vie_for_the.php">to win the Triple Crown</a> at Belmont yesterday, his owner raged, calling other horses who didn&apos;t run all the races &quot;cowards.&quot; And today Steve Coburn <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150610012527/http://espn.go.com/horse-racing/triplecrown2014/story/_/id/11051377/california-chrome-owner-steve-coburn-continues-rant-vs-triple-crown-system">continued his ranting, telling ESPN,</a> &quot;It says Triple Crown. You nominate your horse for the Triple Crown. That means three. Even the Triple Crown trophy has three points on it. So when you earn enough points to run in the Kentucky Derby, those 20 horses that start in the Kentucky Derby should be the only 20 allowed to run in the Preakness and the Belmont for the Triple Crown.&quot;</p>

<p>Yesterday, Chrome finished fourth, after Tonalist, Commissioner and Medal Count. After the race, Coburn (who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150610012527/http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2014-06-06/sports/bs-sp-schmuck-belmont-stakes-california-chrome-060-20140606_1_california-chrome-steve-coburn-belmont-stakes">looks like Wilford Brimley</a>) told reporters, &quot;I&#x2019;m 61 years old, and in my lifetime, I&#x2019;ll never see another Triple Crown winner because of the way they do this. I look at it this way: If you can&#x2019;t make enough points to get in the Kentucky Derby, you can&#x2019;t run in the other two races... This is a coward&#x2019;s way out... If you&#x2019;ve got a horse, run him in all three. &#x2026; Those 20 horses that start in Kentucky are the only 20 eligible to run in all three races.&quot;</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150610012527/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/08/sports/with-triple-crown-at-stake-horse-racing-balances-ambition-and-compassion.html?ref=sports&amp;_r=0&amp;assetType=nyt_now">Times&apos; Harvey Araton wrote</a>:</p><blockquote>Missing the fact that an illness had contributed to Tonalist&#x2019;s inability to qualify for the Derby, Coburn&#x2019;s campaign for equitable conditions came a little late, after the fact. In the run-up to the Belmont, he didn&#x2019;t foresee any problems with the field. He pretty much guaranteed a victory.<p></p>

<p>All of a sudden, out of the winner&#x2019;s circle for the first time this spring, he was crying conspiracy.</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>Still, Coburn decided to continue his all-advised complaints today. In the ESPN interview, he also said, &quot;These people nominate their horses for the Triple Crown and then they hold out two [races] and then come back and run one. That would be like me at 6-2 playing basketball with a kid in a wheelchair. They haven&apos;t done anything with their horses in the Triple Crown. There were three horses in this race that ran in the first two&#x2014;California Chrome, Ride on Curlin and General A Rod&#x2014;none of the other horses did.  You figure out. You ask yourself, &apos;Would it be fair if I played basketball with a child in a wheel chair?&quot;</p>

<p>Later, on Good Morning America, he insisted his analogy wasn&apos;t offensive, &quot;No, I&apos;m just trying to compare the two. Is it fair for me to play with this child in a wheelchair? Is it fair for them to hold their horses back?&quot; He also is fine with being considered a &quot;sore loser.&quot;</p>
