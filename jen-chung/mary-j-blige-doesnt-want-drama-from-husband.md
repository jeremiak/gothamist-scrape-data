Blige smacked her husband for checking out a waitress at her CD release party this week and warned him, &apos;You ain&apos;t going Chris Brown on me,&apos; witnesses said.&quot; Blige&apos;s spokeswoman said of her client and Blige&apos;s husband Kendu Issacs, &quot;They&apos;re as happy as can be. They&apos;re spending the holidays together with their three children. Everything&apos;s great,&quot; while a friend of Blige says maybe &quot;haters&quot; may have &quot;misunderstood a joke Mary and Kendu were sharing.&quot;</p>
