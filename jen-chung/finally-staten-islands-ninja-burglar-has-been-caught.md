<p>The mystery of the Staten Island Ninja Burglar&#x2014;an elusive criminal suspected in a string of break-ins in wealthy parts of the borough who once reportedly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160904052012/http://gothamist.com/2007/09/07/staten_island_n.php">escaped a homeowner who stabbed him</a>&#x2014;has spawned police investigations, theories and even a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160904052012/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staten_Island_Ninja">Wikipedia page</a>. Now the Staten Island District Attorney is holding an afternoon press conference to announce a suspect has finally been arrested. And now it appears that he&apos;s less ninja, more career criminal.</p>

<p>Robert H. Costanzo, 46, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160904052012/http://www.courant.com/news/connecticut/hc-farmington-burglar-staten-island-ninja-0420-20160419-story.html">pleaded guilty to a vicious armed burglary in Connecticut</a> and was then turned over to NYC police. The Hartford Courant reports, &quot;Costanzo admitted that [in 2014] he roused a 66-year-old woman from bed while her husband slept and ordered her at knifepoint to open a safe from which he stole $75,000 worth of jewelry. When the woman initially refused Constanzo&apos;s order, he struck her.&quot; </p>

<p>Costanzo is also a convicted rapist who is on the New York sex-offender registry. He was convicted of rape in New York in 1992 and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160904052012/http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1996-05-17/news/9605161057_1_robert-costanzo-kissimmee-four-rapes">also admitted to raping four women</a> in Florida in the early 1990s. According to the Orlando Sentinel, &quot;All the women were home alone in the early morning hours when a burglar raped them at knifepoint, records state.&quot;</p>

<p>The Ninja Burglar&apos;s crime spree started in May 2007 and ended around January 2008. In one incident, a homeowner fought off the nunchuks-wielding intruder. In another, a homeowner ran into the burglar, who was dressed in all black, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160904052012/http://gothamist.com/2007/09/22/return_of_state.php">and started screaming</a>, &quot;The Ninja is here! The Ninja! The Ninja!&quot;; she later told the Staten Island Advance, &quot;I knew it was the Ninja Burglar from reading the Advance and not my husband playing some trick.&quot;</p>

<p>In April 2008, the police<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160904052012/http://gothamist.com/2008/04/22/ninja_burglar_c.php"> closed the book on the case</a>, deporting an Albanian man who was believed to be connected to the burglaries.</p>
