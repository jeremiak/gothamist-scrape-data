<p>Prepare to swoon: The FDNY&apos;s Official 2015 Calendar of Heroes goes on sale today and firefighters from the calendar will be in Times Square. And, for the first time, one of the firefighters included is a woman!</p>

<p>Danae Mines, an 11-year veteran at Engine Co. 60 in the Bronx, is one of 41 women in the FDNY. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510015719/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/woman-featured-fdny-calendar-heroes-article-1.1866827">She told the Daily News</a> it&apos;s been a dream to be in the calendar but, &quot;I was told that it was all guys. They said if I made it in the calendar, I would look like a pinup girl.&quot; Mines is wearing a tank top&#x2014;but don&apos;t worry, the dudes are shirtless. The firefighter on the cover is Joseph Conforti of Ladder Company 163 in Queens.</p>

<p>The Calendar of Heroes firefighters will be at Broadway between 42nd and 43rd streets between 11 a.m. and 1 p.m. and they are signing purchased copies (this is the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510015719/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/23/photos_fdny_brings_calendar_hunks_t.php#photo-1">scene from last year</a>). The calendars, which are $15.95 each and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510015719/http://fdny-firezone.hostedbyamazon.com/dp/B00LH9BU5W">are available at the FDNY Foundation</a>, feature 13 active firefighters; the FDNY adds, &quot;Each month brings a fire safety message ensuring that each person who purchases the calendar can remain fire safe all year long.&quot; </p>
