Trevonne Winn, a South Carolina resident who was in town visiting his relatives, was talking on his cell phone when a man suddenly fired at him around 7:45 p.m. on Saturday.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141225041614/http://www.ny1.com/content/top_stories/137975/mistaken-identity-killing-caught-on-surveillance-video?ap=1&amp;MP4">NY1 reports that there&apos;s surveillance video of Winn being killed</a>&#x2014;it&apos;s pretty haunting&#x2014;&quot;The video shows a hooded man in dark clothing walk out of a nearby store, stand around for a few minutes and then fire two shots point blank.&quot;</p>

<p> The station also spoke to his mother, who came from S.C., &quot;This is my child, this is my first-born child. I have to come all the way down here to find out that my child is dead and lying on the sidewalk here. The person that said you shot my son, you said you messed up and didn&#x2019;t mean to shoot him. I&#x2019;m here and I&apos;m here to stay and I&apos;m going to find out what happened.&quot;  She added, &quot;I don&#x2019;t know how they do it in New York, but in South Carolina, if something like this goes on, somebody is going to say something.&quot;</p>

<p>His relatives think it was a case of mistaken identity.  Winn had a 16-month-old daughter and was expecting another child. His girlfriend Andreaka Broom <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141225041614/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2011/04/24/man-24-killed-in-brooklyn-shooting/">said he didn&apos;t have any enemies</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141225041614/http://www.wbtv.com/story/14505508/rock-hill-man-shot-left-to-die-on-new-york-street?clienttype=printable">said</a>, &quot;For the sake of my kids, his mother, his family can you just please bring us closure and turn yourself in.&quot;</p>
