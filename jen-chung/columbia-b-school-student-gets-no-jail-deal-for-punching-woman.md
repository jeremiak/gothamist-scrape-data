Sinha <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120529111902/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20110427/harlem/columbia-mba-student-pleads-not-guilty-attacking-woman-nypd-officer">also kicked a police officer</a> in the face during the incident.  Now, prosecutors have given him a no-jail, no-probation plea deal.<p></p>

<p>When Sinha, whose <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120529111902/http://articles.nydailynews.com/2011-04-07/news/29408576_1_psychiatric-ward-cop-stranger">father has diplomatic ties</a>, was taken into custody after the attack, he was treated at Bellevue&apos;s psychiatric ward and his lawyer characterized the episode as his &quot;first psychotic break.&quot; According to the Post, Sinha pleaded guilty to the misdemeanor assault (a change from his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120529111902/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20110427/harlem/columbia-mba-student-pleads-not-guilty-attacking-woman-nypd-officer">not guilty plea last year</a>): He &quot;will stay in school, in therapy and out of jail under a deal worked out with prosecutors.&quot;  His lawyer said, &quot;Everyone realized there was nothing intentional, because he had no real control over it at that time. Now that he is aware, he is receiving treatment.&quot;  </p>

<p>Additionally, the Post reports, &quot;Sinha will return to his native India when his student visa expires upon his graduation in May.&quot;</p>
