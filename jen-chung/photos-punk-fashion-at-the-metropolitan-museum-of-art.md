The exhibit covers punk fashion from the early 1970s through today and features &quot;approximately one hundred designs for men and women,&quot; including &quot;original punk garments and recent, directional fashion to illustrate how haute couture and ready-to-wear borrow punk&apos;s visual symbols.&quot; Like seeing a shirt that says &quot;SPERM&quot; in one of the most refined spaces in New York City!</p>

<p>The museum&apos;s press release explains, &quot;Focusing on the relationship between the punk concept of &quot;do-it-yourself&quot; and the couture concept of &quot;made-to-measure,&quot; the seven galleries will be organized around the materials, techniques, and embellishments associated with the anti-establishment style. Themes will include New York and London, which will tell punk&apos;s origin story as a tale of two cities, followed by Clothes for Heroes and four manifestations of the D.I.Y. aesthetic&#x2014;Hardware, Bricolage, Graffiti and Agitprop, and Destroy. Presented as an immersive multimedia, multisensory experience, the clothes will be animated with period music videos and soundscaping audio techniques.&quot; </p>

<p>Costume Institute curator <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506005924/http://www.metmuseum.org/about-the-museum/press-room/exhibitions/2012/punk-chaos-to-couture">Andrew Bolton explains</a>, &quot;Since its origins, punk has had an incendiary influence on fashion. Although punk&#x2019;s democracy stands in opposition to fashion&#x2019;s autocracy, designers continue to appropriate punk&#x2019;s aesthetic vocabulary to capture its youthful rebelliousness and aggressive forcefulness.&quot; In other words, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506005924/http://blog.metmuseum.org/alexandermcqueen/bumster-skirt-highland-rape/">hail to the bumster</a>! And check out how Johnny Rotten <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506005924/http://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2013/punk/images">inspired a Junya Watanabe sweater</a>.</p>

<p>The designers in the exhibit include: &quot;Miguel Adrover, Thom Browne, Christopher Bailey (Burberry), Hussein Chalayan, Francisco Costa (Calvin Klein), Christophe Decarnin (Balmain), Ann Demeulemeester, Dior, Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana (Dolce and Gabbana), John Galliano, Nicolas Ghesqui&#xE8;re (Balenciaga), Katharine Hamnett, Viktor Horsting and Rolf Snoeren (Viktor &amp; Rolf), Christopher Kane, Rei Kawakubo (Comme des Gar&#xE7;ons), Karl Lagerfeld (Chanel), Helmut Lang, Martin Margiela, Malcolm McLaren, Alexander McQueen, Franco Moschino and Rossella Jardini (Moschino), Kate and Laura Mulleavy (Rodarte), Miuccia Prada, Gareth Pugh, Zandra Rhodes, Hedi Slimane (Saint Laurent), Stephen Sprouse, Jun Takahashi (Undercover), Joseph Thimister, Riccardo Tisci (Givenchy), Gianni Versace, Junya Watanabe, Yohji Yamamoto, and Vivienne Westwood.&quot; </p>
