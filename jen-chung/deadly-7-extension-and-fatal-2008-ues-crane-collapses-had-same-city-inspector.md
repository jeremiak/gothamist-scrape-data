<p>It&apos;s bad enough that officials are saying the 170-foot crane that collapsed at the 7 Extension site in Midtown, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426150650/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/04/photos_show_fatal_crane_collapse_af.php#photo-1">killing one worker and injuring others on Tuesday night</a>, had a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426150650/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/06/crane_that_killed_worker_at_7_train.php">&quot;faulty&quot; hoisting system and other flaws</a> and that the Department of Buildings was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426150650/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/04/city_council_speaker_christine_quin.php">supposed to inspect the crane on Thursday</a>.  Now the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426150650/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/crane_lame_brain_LsKuHK1N8CgM2JiJe0qExO?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=Manhattan">Post reports</a>, &quot;The Buildings Department inspector who never checked the cable that snapped during this week&#x2019;s fatal crane collapse was also the last city worker to look at the Upper East Side tower crane that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426150650/http://gothamist.com/2008/05/30/breaking_manhat.php#photo-1">killed two people in a 2008 disaster</a>.&quot;</p>

<p>At the 7 extension site on 34th Street and 11th Avenue, a cable holding the crane&apos;s boom snapped, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426150650/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/deadly-crane-buildings-department-a-mystery-article-1.1057050?localLinksEnabled=false">sending the boom crashing onto the site</a>. Worker Michael Simermeyer, 23, was killed.</p>

<p>The Post further explains that inspector Patrick McGarrigle &quot;has never operated a tower crane. He spent 15 years installing signs and billboards, and had a license to operate a mobile crane, he said in the deposition. He joined the Department of Buildings in 2004, and right away went to work inspecting cranes.&quot;  McGarrigle tried to inspect the crane in January, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426150650/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/04/city_council_speaker_christine_quin.php">since the crane&apos;s boom was in use</a>, another inspection was scheduled for Arril 5.  A lawyer representing victims of the 2008 incident told the Post, &quot;To not conduct a test because the crane was in operation is absolutely ridiculous.&quot;</p>

<p>It&apos;s also been reported that the contractor operated the crane <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150426150650/http://gothamist.com/2012/04/05/da_investigates_fatal_midtown_crane.php#photo-2">has been accused of mob ties</a>.</p>
