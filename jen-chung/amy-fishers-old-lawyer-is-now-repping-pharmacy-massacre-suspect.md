In fact, it&apos;s a &quot;Long Island Lolita&quot; kind of profile:  Eric Naiburg, who represented Amy Fisher in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130321234506/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/young/amy_fisher/index.html">attempted murder of Mary Buttafuoco</a>, is now representing David Laffer, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130321234506/http://gothamist.com/2011/07/07/why_li_man_cant_serve_jury_duty_hes.php">recent jury duty decliner</a>.  <p></p>

Fisher ended up pleading guilty to aggravated assault and served six years in prison.  </p>

<p>In a video for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130321234506/http://naiburgobedinandweissman.com/attorney-eric-naiburg.html">his law firm</a>, Naiburg explains why he takes on high-profile suspects, &quot;It is rare for both me and any criminal practitioner to say that there is not one redeeming quality of an individual... Generally, there is a real defense... There is always something to hang on to.&quot;</p>
