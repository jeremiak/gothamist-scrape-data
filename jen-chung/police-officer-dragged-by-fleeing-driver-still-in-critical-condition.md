NYPD Commissioner James O&apos;Neill said that Officer Dalsh Veve is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170607115348/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/05/nyregion/police-commissioner-quietly-visits-injured-new-york-officer-dragged-by-car.html?_r=0">&quot;still&quot; in critical condition, and mentioned his family</a>, &quot;They have a little girl. It&#x2019;s really difficult. My heart goes out to them.&quot;<p></p>

<p>Veve and other officers had responded to a call about shots fired near near Tilden Avenue and East 53rd Street in Brooklyn just before midnight on Saturday, June 3rd. The shots turned out to be fireworks, police said, and Veve approached a black Honda across the street that was parked at a fire hydrant. </p>

<p>The driver sped off, taking Veve with them, dragging him on East 53rd Street. Veve got free nearly three blocks away, and the Honda then crashed on East 53rd Street between Snyder and Church Avenue. </p>

Moments later, plain clothes officers run up to help Officer Veve. They realize he&apos;s in need of immediate help, so they loaded him into an unmarked police car.&quot;</p>

<p>The NYPD says Veve discharged his service revolver twice, and the driver, a 15-year-old male, was apparently struck once in the face. The teen later took himself to Brookdale Hospital; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170607115348/https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20170605/east-flatbush/nypd-injury-dalsh-veve-driver-stolen-car">DNAinfo reports</a>, &quot;He had not been charged as of Monday morning because he was still hooked up to an intubator and unable to speak to detectives, NYPD Chief of Detectives Robert Boyce said. He could be charged with attempted murder and felony assault Monday afternoon, he added, but it was the DA&apos;s decision whether that would be as an adult or as a minor.&quot;</p>

<p>Two of the car&apos;s three passengers were <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170607115348/https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20170605/east-flatbush/nypd-injury-dalsh-veve-driver-stolen-car">charged with hindering prosecution</a>; the third was cooperating with authorities.</p>

More tests have to be done to see if Veve has brain activity, said the source, who didn&#x2019;t want to be named.&quot;</p>
