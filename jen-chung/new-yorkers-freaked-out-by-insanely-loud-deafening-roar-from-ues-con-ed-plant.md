<p>On Tuesday night Upper East Side residents and residents of other neighborhoods were alarmed by a rumbling roar, similar to airplanes flying close to the ground, as steam poured from the Con Ed powerhouse.

<p>The Con Ed plant is on East 75th Street by the FDR Drive, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016021258/http://abc7ny.com/news/what-was-that-noise-its-con-ed-releasing-steam-on-the-upper-east-side/1719260/">according to WABC 7</a> the company &quot;said that 310 lbs of pressure was released from steam plant that supplies steam system to hundreds of buildings in Manhattan below 96th Street. The utility said that it was a defective steam valve which then triggered a safety valve/safety system and that is what caused steam and loud noise.&quot;</p>

<p>One woman <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016021258/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Con-Edison-Plant-White-Steam-Loud-Noise-Upper-East-Side-Manhattan-411705215.html">told NBC New York</a>, &quot;I have a friend who lives really close so we got our bags, packed just to go over to her place, just until we could hear something about this one the news... It sounded like a helicopter was landing on top of our building. So we got freaked out, we all ran outside.&quot;</p>

<p>Another said, &quot;I decided to go back inside and run and get at least our purse and our keys and a coat and start walking away.&quot;</p>
