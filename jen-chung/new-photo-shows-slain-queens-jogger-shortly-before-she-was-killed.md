<p>A surveillance image has surfaced showing a 30-year-old woman shortly before she was sexually assaulted and brutally murdered in Queens last month. The image shows <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016022019/http://gothamist.com/tags/karinavetrano">Karina Vetrano</a> jogging on a Howard Beach street at 5:46 p.m., not long before she was slain.</p>

<p>The television program <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016022019/http://crimewatchdaily.com/">Crime Watch Daily</a> obtained the photo for its feature on Vetrano&apos;s still-unsolved murder. Vetrano, an avid runner, had left her house at 5 p.m. on August 2nd. Her father, Philip Vetrano, usually joined her during her jogs, but stayed home due to an injury. He became worried when he couldn&apos;t reach her by 7 p.m., and called a neighbor in the police department. Vetrano soon joined the NYPD on a search that tracked <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016022019/http://gothamist.com/2016/08/06/slain_joggers_earphones_sneaker_fou.php#photo-1">her cellphone to Spring Creek Park</a>, where he  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016022019/http://gothamist.com/2016/08/04/jogger_queens_rape_murder.php">found his daughter&apos;s body</a> in a tall, weeded area.</p>

<p>Karina Vetrano&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016022019/http://gothamist.com/2016/08/05/slain_jogger_howard_beach.php">teeth were broken</a> and police found signs of sexual abuse. NYPD Chief of Detectives Robert Boyce told Crime Watch Daily, &quot;She also had bruising on her body, we believe from being dragged through those woods.&quot; He also noted how her hands found with weeds in them, &quot;She was grabbing onto anything she could at that point.&quot; </p>

<p>Police found DNA from under Vetrano&apos;s nails, but it hasn&apos;t matched anyone in crime databases. The NYPD also released a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016022019/http://gothamist.com/2016/08/31/slain_queens_jogger.php">sketch of a person of interest</a> they think has information about the murder. The authorities are offering a $20,000 reward for information leading to an arrest and conviction while friends and family have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016022019/http://gothamist.com/2016/08/14/queens_jogger_father_interview.php#photo-1">raised over $270,000</a> to supplement that reward. </p>

<p>Her parents have been desperate to find her killer; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171016022019/http://gothamist.com/2016/08/08/slain_joggers_mother_to_killer_your.php">Cathy Vetrano said</a>, &quot;My daughter was a force to be reckoned with. And I guarantee you, you motherf-----, that you will be reckoning with that force, not only for the rest of your pathetic life, but for the rest of eternity as you f------ burn in hell.&quot;</p>
