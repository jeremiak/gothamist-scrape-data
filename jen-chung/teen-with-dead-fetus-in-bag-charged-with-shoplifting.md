<p>More details have emerged about the teens who were caught <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150923131221/http://gothamist.com/2013/10/17/shoplifters_reportedly_arrested_fou.php">allegedly shoplifting yesterday at the Herald Square Victoria&apos;s Secret</a>&#x2014;with a dead fetus in a bag. Tiana Rodriguez, 17, and Francis Estevez, 17, were both charged with petit larceny and criminal possession of stolen property. Rodriguez is believed to be the mother, and she had posted on Facebook on Wednesday, &quot;These Cramps, SON.&quot;</p>

<p>According to the police, they were called to the store at 1:24 p.m. because security officers had pulled the teens aside and checked their bags because of a &quot;strong odor and found a fetus inside the bag&quot; of Rodriguez.  The fetus was a boy and some say that it was six or seven months along. </p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150923131221/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/dead-fetus-found-bag-midtown-store-article-1.1488876">Daily News reports</a> that she &quot;told police she suffered a miscarriage the day before. Rodriguez, already the mother of a young, healthy son, was taken to Bellevue Hospital.&quot; The News adds that police are looking at her friend&apos;s home in Queens, thinking the baby was born there.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150923131221/http://nypost.com/2013/10/17/thief-caught-in-victorias-secret-carrying-stillborn-baby/">A shopper told the Post</a>, &quot;It makes me feel sick. I don&#x2019;t understand the thought process, to have a baby in a bag and then shoplift,&quot; and was unhappy at Victoria&apos;s Secret, &quot;I think it&#x2019;s very strange that they didn&#x2019;t shut down the store. I feel a level of disrespect.&quot;</p>

<p>The police are still investigating while the ME&apos;s office conducts an autopsy on the fetus.</p>
