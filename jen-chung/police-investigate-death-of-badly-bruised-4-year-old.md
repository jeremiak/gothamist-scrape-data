The child, Jayden Lenescar, was in cardiac arrest and later pronounced dead Kings County Hospital. Now the police are investigating his death as a homicide.</p>

<p>The boy&apos;s mother, Myrna Chen Phang, had called 911 about the boy&apos;s condition.  She had custody of the boy but Jayden&apos;s father Mackenzy Lenescar took care of him on the weekends, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623131907/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/24/nyregion/24child.html?ref=nyregion">according to Lenescar&apos;s sister</a>.  The ME&apos;s office is determining cause of death, but the police believe the amount of bruising on Jayden&apos;s body <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623131907/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/abused_klyn_boy_dead_NI5iDYCEPG2xMHztwwHQ2M">is suspicious</a>.  The NY Times reports, &quot;An official at the city&#x2019;s Administration for Children&#x2019;s Services, which was investigating the death, said it appeared that the agency had not had any previous dealings with the family.&quot;  </p>

<p>Lenescar was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623131907/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2009/10/24/2009-10-24_cops_quiz_dad_in_slay_of_4yrold_who_had_bruises_all_over_his_body_as_mystery_dee.html">questioned by police</a> last night, but a source says they don&apos;t think he was involved.  Relatives and neighbors are expressing shock about the death; Jayden&apos;s uncle Karl Henry said, &quot;We&apos;re not a family that abuses children. I don&apos;t think this is possible,&quot; while an aunt said, &quot;His mom didn&#x2019;t beat him.&quot;</p>
