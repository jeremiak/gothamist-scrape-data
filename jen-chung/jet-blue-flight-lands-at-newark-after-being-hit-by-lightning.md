<p>A JetBlue flight from Boston to Florida was diverted to Newark Airport after it was struck by lightning last night. The Airbus 320 was carrying 148 passengers and five crew members. </p>

<p>According to a JetBlue spokesperson, the plane, which took off before 9 p.m. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509164751/http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/JetBlue-Airplane-Lightning-Boston-Circling-JFK-Kennedy-Airport-Queens-210664831.html">&quot;encountered lightning&quot;</a> landed at Newark around 11 p.m. </p>

<p>However, a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150509164751/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/emergency_jet_land_VkuiM52ohDtfX9wadeW3tJ?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20Local">source told the Post</a>, &quot;<strong>The jet was hit by multiple lightning strikes that caused multiple systems failures</strong>.&quot; The Post also reports, &quot;The plane initially diverted to Kennedy Airport, but was too heavy to land because it was carrying a nearly full load of fuel. It circled for more than an hour to burn off the extra fuel, the law-enforcement source said.&quot;</p>
