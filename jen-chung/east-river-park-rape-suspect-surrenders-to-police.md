The victim turned around and started to run in the opposite direction when the suspect grabbed her hair, put his arm around her throat and pulled her into the amphitheater area where he raped her.&quot;</p>

<p>Police say that Niles stole the victim&apos;s credit card and used it at a deli; footage from the store was released. </p>

<p>Yesterday, Niles turned himself in, and the investigation revealed that around 6:45 p.m. that same day, a 56-year-old woman said she was walking by the FDR Drive and Grand Street when Niles allegedly approached her, tried to talk to her &quot;before grabbing her buttocks and fleeing the location on a bicycle.&quot;<br>
 <br>
Nlles has been charged with rape, robbery and identity theft as well as forcible touching. </p>
