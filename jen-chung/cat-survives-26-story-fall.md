<p>WABC 7 had this crazy story over the weekend:  A cat <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503000908/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/bizarre&amp;id=6839225">fell 26 stories from a lower Manhattan building</a>&#x2014;and survived!  And the cat&apos;s name is...<em>Lucky</em>!  Apparently Lucky&apos;s owner had left a window in her apartment open 6 inches wide&#x2014;which is more than enough for any enterprising cat to wander through.  Lucky decided to walk out onto the ledge, but he slipped.</p>

<p>What&apos;s also amazing is that a window washing crew across the street took pictures!  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503000908/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/gallery?section=news&amp;id=6838948&amp;photo=1">See them here</a>&#x2014;WABC 7 describes them, &quot;First of Lucky perched dangerously on the ledge, and then a stomach-turning shot of Lucky midair. <strong>Finally, they captured Lucky, after landing, on his feet on a neighbor&apos;s balcony 26 stories below</strong>.&quot;  Lucky was hospitalized briefly and seems to be fine and as cute as ever, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503000908/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/bizarre&amp;id=6839225">judging by the video</a>.</p>

<p>If you have any pets, do not leave unscreened windows open more than a inch.  Here&apos;s the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503000908/http://www.aspca.org/pet-care/cat-care/high-rise-syndrome.html">ASPCA on high rise syndrome</a>.</p>
