<p>The NYPD has released video of the hit-and-run motorist who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160821042621/http://gothamist.com/2016/02/28/accident_roundup.php">killed a bicyclist in Park Slope</a> on Sunday morning. Investigators say there is visible damage to the vehicle and they&apos;re hoping the public can help them track down the driver.</p>

<p>According to the NYPD, the driver ran a red light around 4:56 a.m. near the intersection of 9th Street and Fifth Avenue, hitting a 41-year-old man on a bike as he crossed Fifth Avenue. The driver fled the scene, driving south on Fifth Avenue. </p>

<p>The victim died at Methodist Hospital. </p>

<p>Police say the driver&apos;s vehicle is &quot;a late model 4 door Nissan Altima, light brown or tan in color, with damage to the passenger side of the vehicle. The car is missing its passenger side mirror, its bumper is broken and the passenger side headlight and fog light are inoperable.&quot;</p>

Khalifa Salem, who works behind the counter at Fifth Avenue Deli and Smoke Shop, said a minivan swerved off the street and crashed into the storefront in 2013. Two months ago, he added, a dog was hit. And on Sunday afternoon, two cars collided outside the store.&quot;<br>
