<p>The body of actor James Gandolfini <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130729115430/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news&amp;id=9149147">arrived in New Jersey last night</a>. Gandolfini <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130729115430/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/19/james_gandolfini_has_died_at_51.php">passed away</a> while vacationing in Rome last week, and his family <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130729115430/http://gothamist.com/2013/06/23/james_gandolfinis_body_returning_to.php">thanked the Italian and U.S. government</a> for helping expedite the process of returning the body. </p>

<p>Specifically, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130729115430/http://variety.com/2013/tv/news/clintons-help-gandolfini-family-speed-return-of-body-to-u-s-1200500972/">his family thanked</a> Secretary of State John Kerry, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and former President Bill Clinton. (Bill Clinton and James Gandolfini <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130729115430/http://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/lawmaker-news/307213-james-gandolfini-bill-clinton-and-their-friend-the-german-watchmaker">were friends</a>.) </p>

<p>The funeral for Gandolfini will be held on Thursday at 10 a.m. at the Cathedral of St. John Divine in Morningside Heights. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130729115430/http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/gandolfini-funeral-set-thursday-new-york-article-1.1380988?localLinksEnabled=false">Daily News notes</a> that Gandolfini was Catholic and St. John the Divine is an Episcopalian church, adding that many other famous people (Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia, James Baldwin, Nikola Tesla, Mayor John Lindsay, Dizzy Gillespie, Jim Henson, George Balanchine) also had funeral services there. Our guess: The seating capacity for St. Patrick&apos;s Cathedral in Midtown is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130729115430/http://www.aviewoncities.com/buildings/nyc/stpatrickscathedral.htm">about 2500</a>; St. John the Divine&apos;s nave <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130729115430/http://www.emporis.com/building/cathedral-of-st-john-the-divine-new-york-city-ny-usa">can hold 6,000</a>. Plus, it&apos;s probably easier to manage traffic uptown, versus in Midtown. </p>
