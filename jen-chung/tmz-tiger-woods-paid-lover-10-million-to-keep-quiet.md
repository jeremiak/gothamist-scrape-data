Compare Rachel&apos;s settlement with what other [alleged mistresses] received, if they got anything at all. We&apos;re told several mistresses got several hundred thousand dollars, and others got nothing. That speaks volumes about how much Rachel knows.&quot;</p>

Instead, she&apos;s laid low, not participating in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110512035024/http://www.vanityfair.com/online/daily/2010/03/tiger-woodss-inconvenient-women.html">Vanity Fair&apos;s feature about the Tiger lovers</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110512035024/http://gothamist.com/2010/03/11/tiger_woods_flings_wear_bikinis_dis.php">Howard Stern&apos;s Tiger Woods Mistress Pageant</a>.  This all a far cry from when she <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110512035024/http://gothamist.com/2009/12/05/alleged_tiger_mistress_is_unrecogni.php">appeared on the cover of the NY Post back in 2001</a>&#x2014;holding a photograph of her fiance who died in the Twin Towers.</p>
