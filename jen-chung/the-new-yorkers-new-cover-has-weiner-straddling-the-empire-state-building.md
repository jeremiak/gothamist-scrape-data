<p>Anthony Weiner has <em>finally made it</em> onto the cover of The New Yorker. But of course it took <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503145421/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/24/the_sexually_annotated_weiner_email.php">newly-surfaced sexts</a> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503145421/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/25/step_right_up_see_more_nsfw_pics_of.php">really NSFW ones</a>) with a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503145421/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/26/video_sydney_leathers_speaks.php">young woman</a> for him to receive this honor. </p>

<p>Artist John Cuneo <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503145421/http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/culture/2013/07/cover-story-john-cuneo-weiner-carlos-danger.html">tells The New Yorker</a>, &quot;With a topic like Anthony Weiner, how can you find anything broad or funny that he hasn&#x2019;t already personally breached... Free association made me think of the Empire State Building, and then King Kong, the iconic image of him straddling it. And then Weiner sexting, his head tilted and looking a certain way&#x2014;I just stumbled upon the image as I was sketching. But all I could think about while working on this piece was, &#x2018;Will Weiner still be in the race by the time it runs?&#x2019;&quot;</p>

<p>Weiner says he&apos;s staying in (even those his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503145421/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/25/new_poll_shows_weiner_going_limp_li.php">poll strength is flagging</a>), but the New Yorker&apos;s Amy Davison <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503145421/http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/closeread/2013/07/anthony-weiner-his-sex-messages-and-his-wife.html">wrote earlier this week</a>, &quot;The issue here isn&#x2019;t prudery but his pettiness, recklessness, and shaving of the truth. Asked about his lies to [wife Huma] Abedin, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503145421/http://gothamist.com/2013/07/23/anthony_weiner_carlos_danger.php">he said</a>, &apos;She knew all along, this process, as I was more and more honest with her, I told her everything.&apos; Where are the rest of us on the &#x201C;more and more honest&#x201D; continuum? Maybe all politicians lie; maybe many husbands do. But, as voters, do we have to listen?&quot;</p>
