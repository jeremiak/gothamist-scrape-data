<p>Forty years ago today, <em><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150108215611/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Godfather">The Godfather</a></em>, Francis Ford Coppola&apos;s adaptation of Mario Puzo&apos;s bestselling novels opened in five NYC movie theaters. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150108215611/http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/03/15/a-day-to-toast-the-godfather-and-new-york/">NY Times&apos;  Clyde Haberman notes that fact</a> plus many others about the ground-breaking film in his column today. For instance: &quot;The Corleone family compound, supposedly on Long Island, was actually in the Emerson Hill section of Staten Island. Luca Brasi, he who winds up sleeping with the you-know-what, is stabbed in the Edison Hotel. Michael Corleone makes his bones as a hitman at a restaurant in the Bronx. He and Kay stay at the St. Regis Hotel. There are shots of East Harlem, Mott Street, Radio City Music Hall and the old Best &amp; Co. store on Fifth Avenue.&quot;</p>

<p>The &quot;Corleone mansion&quot; was in the news <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150108215611/http://gothamist.com/2011/01/20/godfather_house.php">over a year ago</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150108215611/http://gothamist.com/2010/12/02/godfather_mansion_for_sale.php">when it hit the market</a>, but we found this tidbit about the restaurant where Michael Corleone kills Solozzo and Captain McCluskey interesting.  While the scene was filmed at Louie&apos;s Restaurant, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150108215611/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2012/03/15/40-years-later-owners-of-bronx-restaurant-have-no-regrets-in-turning-down-role-in-the-godfather/">1010 WINS reports</a>, &quot;Coppola originally wanted it Mario&#x2019;s Restaurant on Arthur Avenue, since the eatery was mentioned in Mario Puzo&#x2019;s novel.&quot;</p>

<p>However, Mario Migliucci refused&#x2014;his son explained that he wanted the focus on the food, &quot;He didn&#x2019;t want that stigma here... We&#x2019;re still in business, we&#x2019;re going on our 93rd year. So what does it tell you? Did it hurt us? No.&#x201D;  1010 WINS adds, &quot;The same can&#x2019;t be said for Louie&#x2019;s. The restaurant closed down shortly after the Godfather shoot.&quot;</p>

<p>Anyway, on March 16, 1972, Times film critic Vincent Canby&apos;s review began, &quot;Taking a best-selling novel of more drive than genius (Mario Puzo&apos;s &quot;The Godfather&quot;), about a subject of something less than common experience (the Mafia), involving an isolated portion of one very particular ethnic group (first-generation and second-generation Italian-Americans), Francis Ford Coppola has made one of the most brutal and moving chronicles of American life ever designed within the limits of popular entertainment.&quot; And here&apos;s Pauline Kael&apos;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150108215611/http://www.potatoships.com/paulineadobe/index.htm">review of the film in The New Yorker</a>.</p>
