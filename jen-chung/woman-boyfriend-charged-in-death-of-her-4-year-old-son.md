Myrna Chen Phang, 25, and Steven Dadaille, 26, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140331231453/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/kid_slay_mother_charged_wsYMabrv24erxvEhzgWXML">allegedly beat</a> little Jayden Lenescar for two days, using their fists, a clothes hanger and belt.  The boy&apos;s grieving father Mackenzy Lenescar said, &quot;The only way I will feel anything is if someone could bring my son back.&quot;</p>

<p>Phang had called 911 on Friday afternoon, because Jayden was unconscious; he was later pronounced dead at the hospital.  According to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140331231453/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2009/10/24/2009-10-24_mother_boyfriend_blame_each_other_in_brutal_death_of_4yearold_jayden_lenescar.html">Daily News</a>, &quot;Phang and Dadaille... implicated each other in the child&apos;s ghastly death, according to sources. Each gave finger-pointing written and video statements asserting their innocence and blaming the other before police charged both of them with the murder, sources said.&quot;  However, Dadaille told reporters, as he was being escorted from the precinct, &quot;I didn&apos;t kill no baby.&quot;  </p>

<p>Police had initially questioned Lenescar, but determined he was not involved.  He tells the News he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140331231453/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2009/10/24/2009-10-24_weeping_dad_of_.html">last saw his son</a> two weeks ago and, according to the Post, attempted to speak with his son on the phone on Thursday night, but Phang claimed he was sleeping.  He said, &quot;He was only 4 years old. We didn&apos;t have enough time together. He was a quiet boy. He was a good boy. He didn&apos;t deserve this.&quot;  And his sister was shocked, &quot;I can&apos;t understand it. Myrna&apos;s a good mother, I can&apos;t think that anything would get her so mad that she&apos;d beat him like that.&quot;</p>
