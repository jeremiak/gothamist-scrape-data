<p>The police are asking for the public&apos;s help in locating two men suspected of robbing $100,000 from a woman in the East Village.</p>

<p>According to the NYPD, yesterday at 5:30 p.m., two men attacked and robbed the woman when she left her home. The police say, &quot;As the victim walked from her first floor apartment, the two suspects followed behind her, with one of them placing the victim in a choke hold, causing her to fall to the ground. Both suspects made off with the woman&apos;s pocketbook, containing her cell phone, credit cards and personal property, as well as a Bank of America bag (black with a red stripe across the top) which contained USC.&quot;</p>

Also, the police are considering the possibility that the men knew she was carrying all that cash.</p>
