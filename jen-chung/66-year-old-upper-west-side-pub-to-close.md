Another neighborhood joint closing isn&apos;t surprising, but it&apos;s a little depressing, given how owner Charlie Campbell found out: &quot;<strong>he only got the bad news when he saw the location advertised for lease on the Web site of real estate brokerage CB Richard Ellis.</strong>&quot;  Apparently the landlord is doubling the rent to $350,000/year for the 800-square foot space.  An Emerald Inn patron lamented, &quot;We used to have all these ma-and-pa shops,&quot; but these days, there are higher-end and trendier neighbors--like a sleek Lancome location next store and Intermix and Magnolia Bakery across the street. We hope mom-and-pop stores, like Stationary Toys World on West 72nd (between Amsterdam and Columbus), can weather through it.</p>
