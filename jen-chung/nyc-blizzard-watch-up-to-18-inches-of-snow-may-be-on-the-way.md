<p>Uh, so the &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170712124513/http://gothamist.com/2017/03/10/time_smarches_on.php">significant, potentially major, snowstorm</a>&quot; that we mentioned on Friday? Now New York City, along with Long Island, southern Westchester, metro New Jersey and southern Connecticut, are under a Blizzard Watch&#x2014;and the National Weather Service says that 12 to 18 inches of snow may arrive!</p>

<p>Carrie Buccola, a meteorologist at the NWS&apos;s Upton location, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170712124513/http://www.newsday.com/news/weather/long-island-blizzard-watch-for-monday-night-through-tuesday-evening-nws-says-1.13243880">told Newsday</a>, &quot;It looks like this could have the most snow we&#x2019;ve had all season.&quot; </p>

<p>The timing of the blizzard, according to the NWS, will occur &quot;late Monday through Tuesday evening,&quot; making travel &quot;dangerous&quot; and there&apos;s a &quot;potential for power outages.&quot; The temperates will be in the upper 20s, and winds will be from the Northeast, at 15-25 mph, with gusts up to 40 mph. Visibility may be only a quarter of a mile or less. Also expected: Parents desperately scrambling to figure out if there&apos;s going to be a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170712124513/http://gothamist.com/2017/02/08/snow_day_nyc_schools_closed_thursda.php">snow day</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170712124513/http://forecast.weather.gov/showsigwx.php?warnzone=NJZ006&amp;warncounty=NJC017&amp;firewxzone=NJZ006&amp;local_place1=West%20New%20York%20NJ&amp;product1=Blizzard+Watch&amp;lat=40.7859&amp;lon=-74.0098#.WMVI4BLytjs">NWS winter weather message adds</a>, &quot;A Blizzard Watch means there is a potential for falling and/or blowing snow with strong winds and extremely poor visibilities. This can lead to whiteout conditions and make travel very dangerous.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170712124513/http://nypost.com/2017/03/11/blizzard-watch-issued-for-nyc-ahead-of-monster-noreaster/">Accuweather meteorologist Rob Miller told the Post</a>, &quot;It&#x2019;s a big storm coming up the coast. And they produce a lot of snow.&quot;</p><blockquote>The exact path of the &#x201C;classic Nor&#x2019;easter&#x201D; will determine how much snow falls in the city, Miller said. A move to the west as the storm travels up the coast could warm the air and turn some of the precipitation to rain. A shift to the east could push the worst of the snow out to sea.<p></p>

<p>But the computer models used for forecasts point to the city and the surrounding suburbs taking a major wallop, Miller explained. &#x201C;In the past 24 hours, computer guidance has been remarkably consistent,&#x201D; he said.</p></blockquote>You know what it&apos;s time for:<p></p>
