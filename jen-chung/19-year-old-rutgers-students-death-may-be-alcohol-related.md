On its website, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150511041142/http://www.begnbark.com/about.html">she wrote</a>, &quot;[M]y passion for animal welfare flourished after I adopted my now 4 year old calico kitty, Dakota. I soon after began volunteering and fostering for a local shelter, learning so much about animals as well as all the possibilities the field could bring me. Also, the experience left me with my tabby cats Tegan, 3 years old, and Parker, a year old. I hope to live my life being a voice for those who do not have one, and it gives me such satisfaction to be there for your companions! I can truly ensure that any animal left in my care will be treated as though they are my own. To include providing all the love and attention given by their own family.&quot;</p>

<p>Beg &apos;n Bark&apos;s owner Brenda Janner told NJ.com, &quot;She was a very nice girl, a very smart girl, always happy, bubbly, and had a lot of energy. She was very positive. You could tell she enjoyed doing what she was doing. She had a passion for it.&quot;</p>
