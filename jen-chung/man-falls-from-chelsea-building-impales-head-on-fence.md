A section of the railing was still attached to his scalp when he arrived at Bellevue Hospital.&quot;<p></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140420213943/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/05/30/2010-05-30_he_tumbles_off_balcony_impales_head___survives.html">According to the Daily News</a>, Blossom &quot;was causing a ruckus outside on the third-floor balcony on Sixth Ave. near W. 26th St. when the cops were called around 4 a.m., sources said. As cops arrived, Blossom - of Williamsburg, Brooklyn - tripped and fell off the balcony, only to land a floor below with his head impaled by a fence on the platform, cops and family said.&quot; A cop told the Post that he was screaming that he &quot;hated everyone,&quot; and Post sources say that Blossom, who is in the band Alaska Alaska and went to the party with a bandmate, first fell &quot;onto the second-floor balcony of an adjoining apartment building, landing head first on the fence.&quot;</p>

<p>Doctors were able to remove the piece of fence from Blossom&apos;s head. His mother told the Post, &quot;He is out of surgery and making some jokes. The doctor tells us that he was very lucky.&quot; But he&apos;s in a lot of pain: Blossom reportedly moaned, &quot;I just f---ing want to scream,&quot; from his hospital bed. </p>
