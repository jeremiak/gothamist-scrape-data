<p>Sarah Jessica can do it all: She&apos;s a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506145136/http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/sarah-jessica-parker-thrill-recognized-carrie-bradshaw/story?id=14428677">fashion icon</a>. She&apos;s hosting a fundraiser for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506145136/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkY_vX3jI5E">&quot;that guy&quot;</a> (President Obama) later this week.  And she shows her kids how <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506145136/http://gothamist.com/2009/10/15/bloomberg_nypd_cant_enforce_jaywalk.php">unenforceable laws</a> don&apos;t matter.</p>

<p>Little Tabitha and Marion Broderick were getting lessons on being true New Yorkers yesterday when they were pushed in their strollers by Parker and their nanny.  Those kids have no fear when it comes to crazy New York drivers&#x2014;and Parker knows the NYPD isn&apos;t going to bother writing them a ticket. (They&apos;re too busy <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150506145136/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/15/cop_tickets_cyclists_for_hanging_to.php">cracking down on cyclists</a> with tote bags on their handlebars.)</p>
