<p>Recent New York transplant Taylor Swift is getting ready to launch her new album, 1989, later this month and she&apos;s releasing a few songs in advance of that. Today, she &quot;teased&quot; the third single, &quot;Welcome to New York,&quot; with an explanation.</p>

<p>From <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150511041147/http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/taylor-swift-debuts-song-york/story?id=26316546">Good Morning America</a>:</p><blockquote>&#x201C;I wanted to start the album with this song because New York has been an important landscape and location for the story of my life in the last couple of years,&#x201D; Swift, 24, said...<p></p>

<p>&#x201C;I dreamt about moving to New York. I obsessed about moving to New York and then I did it,&#x201D; said Swift, who has been living in NYC since April when she reportedly purchased a $19.9 million penthouse in Manhattan&apos;s TriBeCa neighborhood.</p>

<p>&#x201C;The inspiration that I found in that city is kind of hard to describe and hard to compare to any other force of inspiration I&#x2019;ve ever experienced in my life,&#x201D; she said.</p>

<p>Swift&#x2019;s new album, &#x201C;1989,&#x201D; will be released on Oct. 27. It is the fifth studio album for the music superstar...</p>

<p>&#x201C;I approached moving there with such wide-eyed optimism and sort of saw it as a place of endless potential and possibilities,&#x201D; Swift said of New York City. &#x201C;You can kind of hear that reflected in this music and this first song especially.&#x201D;</p></blockquote>Reached for comment, native New Yorker Jake Dobkin wonders, &quot;Is that like a jingle for a new sandwich at Subway?&quot; then added, &quot;God, the &apos;80s had Madonna and we have this. Come, come nuclear bombs.&quot; <p></p>

<p>But don&apos;t worry, she only carries her cat like that because Meredith Grey <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150511041147/http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/taylor-swift-explains-carries-cat-olivia-benson/story?id=25755359">doesn&apos;t like cat carriers</a>&#x2014;Swift was just walking from apartment building to the car!</p>
