<p>Last month, a few Long Island lawmakers called for a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503153436/http://gothamist.com/2009/05/12/long_island_lawmakers_order_stateho.php">study to examine the possibility of Long Island statehood</a>.  Suffolk Comptroller Joseph Sawicki had said, &quot;The state of Long Island has always been a romantic idea, its been fun to talk about and exciting to discuss. Now, it&apos;s become a matter of economic survival,&quot; and pointed out that Albany gets $3 billion more from Long Island than it gives back.  Last night, Samantha Bee of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503153436/http://www.thedailyshow.com/index.jhtml">the Daily Show</a> decided to tackle the issue, speaking with Suffolk County Legislator Edward Romaine (pro-Long Island as the 51st State), State Senate Carl Marcellino (con-Long Island as the 51st State), and a three, um, typical Long Island guys who suggest that the Long Island state bird could be &quot;flipping the bird.&quot;</p>

<p><br>Remember: NYC <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503153436/http://gothamist.com/2008/01/30/the_war_between.php">gives Albany $10+ billion more</a> than it gets back!</p>
