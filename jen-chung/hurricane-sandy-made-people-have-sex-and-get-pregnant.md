<p>Years from now, a group of children will learn that the only reason why they&apos;re around is because their parents were bored and decided to have sex during a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130619033540/http://gothamist.com/tags/hurricanesandy">terrible storm</a>.</p>

<p>The NY Times has a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130619033540/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/27/nyregion/preparing-for-hurricane-babies.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">story on the so-called &quot;Hurricane Sandy babies&quot;</a> who were conceived during the dark days after the storm hit:</p><blockquote>Late last October, Hurricane Sandy pumped six feet of water into the lobby of a residential building in downtown Jersey City, trapping Meaghan B Murphy and her husband, Patrick, in their apartment and leaving them without electricity for days.<p></p>

<p>Ms. Murphy, 37, deputy editor of Self magazine, is expected to give birth to her third child at the end of July. &#x201C;We were content with two children; three were not in the plan,&#x201D; she recalled. &#x201C;But with no power, no TV, no lights, even without that much food, there was not much else to do.&#x201D;</p>

<p>&#x201C;And my husband is so handsome,&#x201D; she added of Mr. Murphy, a 33-year-old private client manager for a bank. &#x201C;I couldn&#x2019;t resist.&#x201D;</p></blockquote>Hospitals are expecting about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130619033540/http://www.nypost.com/p/entertainment/hurricane_sandy_baby_bump_vFpviEEXjG3CeV6e1gzwFP">10-30%</a> more births this summer, versus last year. Dr. Warren Licht, the former chief medical officer and now a specialist at the hospital&#x2019;s Women&#x2019;s Health Center,  said, &quot;It makes perfect sense, that during a period of a prolonged loss of electricity, people take comfort in creating their own.&#x201D; And Dr. Jacques Moritz, director of the division of gynecology at St Luke&#x2019;s-Roosevelt Hospital Center said, &quot;This is just old basic physiology. There&#x2019;s no Internet and no cable. What else is there to do?&#x2019;&quot; Internet&#x2014;the technology god&apos;s form of abstinence? <p></p>
