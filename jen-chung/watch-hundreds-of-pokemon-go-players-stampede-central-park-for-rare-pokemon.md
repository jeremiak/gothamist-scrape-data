<p>This is officially the second weekend in which Pok&#xE9;mon Go&apos;s infiltrated almost every part of our lives (you know, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161225175151/http://gothamist.com/2016/07/15/pokemon_go_nyc_gym_map.php">our homes</a>; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161225175151/http://gothamist.com/2016/07/13/pokemon_donuts.php">our stomachs</a>; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161225175151/http://gothamist.com/2016/07/12/manhattanhenge_pokemon_go.php">our Manhattanhenges</a>; our precious relationships <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161225175151/http://gothamist.com/2016/07/12/pokemon_go_catches_cheater.php">with actual human beings</a>). But it may be the <em>first</em> weekend of some mob scenes&#x2014;watch what happened when a huge group descended on Central Park for the elusive Vaporeon.</p>

<p>A Vimeo user Woodzys uploaded this footage:</p>

<p>Commissioner Bratton <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161225175151/http://gothamist.com/2016/07/14/bill_bratton_millennials_are.php">is probably very upset</a>.</p>

Woodzys explained, &quot;What happens when hundreds of people are gathered at the edge of Central Park to play Pokemon Go at 11 p.m.&apos;ish and a Vaporeon shows up in the park? Well....this!&quot; Woodzys added, &quot;I didn&apos;t catch the front of the pack that was sprinting into the park like a herd of wildebeest. Special shout out to the guy at the start of the video that jumped out of his car, left the engine running, and darted off to claim the grand prize.&quot;</p>

<p>Please, let us soon have the first &quot;Man&apos;s Car Stolen While He Playing Pok&#xE9;mon Go&quot; story, to complement the &quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161225175151/http://gothamist.com/2016/07/14/pokemon_nope.php">Man Totals Car While Playing Pok&#xE9;mon Go</a>.&quot;</p>

<p>Anyway, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161225175151/http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Vaporeon_(Pok%C3%A9mon)">Vaporeon</a> is a pretty rare Pokemon to find in the wild&#x2014;it&apos;s one of Eevee&apos;s evolutions.

And this scene does mimic Nintendo&apos;s Pok&#xE9;mon Go ad that shows a crowd in Times Square (2 minutes, 2 seconds in):</p>

<p>There will be a bunch of bar crawls and other group <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161225175151/http://gothamist.com/2016/07/12/pokemon_go_is_people.php">Pok&#xE9;mon Go events next weekend</a>!
