Police say they were burned by some Drano that had been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130925033544/http://nypost.com/2013/09/21/two-children-accidently-burned-by-drano-on-queens-bus/">dripping from another rider&apos;s backpack</a>.<p></p>

<p>Apparently JFK Airport employee Ivan Ivanov, 32, was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130925033544/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/queens/children-suffer-acid-burns-queens-bus-article-1.1463473">transporting cleaning supplies</a> to his home when the spill occurred. The Daily News reports, &quot;Ivanov, who was transporting the harmful liquid in a flimsy plastic bottle, had placed his backpack onto the bus floor. Minutes later, the chemical ate through the bottle and then his bag &#x2014; and dribbled onto the boys, the source said.&quot;</p>

<p>Ivanov was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130925033544/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2013/09/22/two-children-accidentally-burned-by-cleaning-solution-on-queens-bus/">taken into custody</a> and charged with reckless endangerment. The News says, &quot;He was overheard telling a cop he didn&#x2019;t know what kind of substance he was transporting.&quot;</p>
