<p>Police are focusing their efforts on an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510011831/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/18/nyregion/police-investigate-fatal-subway-push.html?ref=nyregion&amp;_r=0">&quot;all-out manhunt&quot;</a> to find the man who shoved a subway passenger to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510011831/http://gothamist.com/2014/11/16/cops_man_fatally_struck_by_train_ma.php">his death on Sunday</a>. And they have apparently identified the person of interest.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510011831/http://nypost.com/2014/11/17/suspect-in-custody-in-deadly-subway-push/">According to the Post</a>, &quot;The suspect was identified as homeless thug Kevin Darden &#x2014; who has more than 30 arrests, including for trying to set his brother&#x2019;s house on fire. The 35-year-old vagrant, who has done at least one stint in prison, was most recently arrested Nov. 9 in Midtown for pick-pocketing, sources said.&quot;</p>

<p>On Sunday, at the 167th Street D train in the Bronx, Wai Kuen Kwok and his wife were waiting for a subway to take them to Chinatown. (They were reportedly going to buy groceries and have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510011831/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2014/11/18/cbs2-sources-police-close-to-arrest-in-deadly-bronx-subway-attack/">lunch to celebrate her birthday</a>.)  At 8:45 a.m., when a southbound train pulled into the station, Kwok was shoved into the train&apos;s path. </p>

<p>The train&apos;s operator, James Muriel, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510011831/http://nypost.com/2014/11/17/subway-driver-laments-of-push-victim-nothing-i-could-do/">described the awful incident to the Post</a>, &quot;I see a body flying across the tracks. I knew that it wasn&#x2019;t an ordinary jump on the tracks. The guy didn&#x2019;t go straight down, he was actually in the air. I slammed the brakes when he was in the air. By the time I got to him he had just fallen onto the tracks, there was just nothing you can do. I need 300-400 feet to get a train to stop. It&#x2019;s a 100-ton train.&quot; </p>

<p>Muriel <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510011831/http://7online.com/news/person-of-interest-identified-by-police-in-deadly-bronx-subway-push-motorman-speaks-out/397382/">said that Kwok&apos;s body actually hit the windshield</a>, &quot;I then returned to the platform and the victim&apos;s wife cried in my arms, begging me for help.&quot; </p>

<p>Kwok, 61, was pronounced dead at the scene while his wife was taken to the hospital for trauma. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150510011831/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/18/nyregion/police-investigate-fatal-subway-push.html?ref=nyregion&amp;_r=0">The NY Times reports</a>, &quot;On Monday, Chief Joseph Fox, speaking at a Metropolitan Transportation Authority meeting, expressed sympathy to the family of Mr. Kwok and assured them of a round-the-clock search &apos;until we identify who did this and bring them to custody,&apos; Mr. Fox said before presenting a monthly safety report.&quot;</p>

<p>Darden was spotted getting onto a Bx35 bus after the incident. Police released surveillance video of him:</p>

Muriel also told the Post, &quot;I would like to apologize to the family. There was nothing I could have done.&quot;</p>
