<p>Cuomo said, &quot;The travel ban issued earlier today allowed emergency teams to make significant progress in clearing the roads. As crews continue to respond to the storm and the severity of weather conditions decrease, we are lifting the travel ban so New Yorkers can resume their daily routines. Public safety is of paramount importance and we encourage New Yorkers to continue exercising caution while traveling.&quot;</p>
