<p>Sometimes people can&apos;t handle the truth, especially when it&apos;s about their own bigotry! A Congressman from North Carolina is slamming <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170626130937/http://gothamist.com/2016/04/08/the_boss_cancels_nc.php">Bruce Springsteen for canceling a concert</a>, after The Boss objected to the state&apos;s awful, discriminatory law against the LGBT community.</p>

<p>On Friday, The Boss announced that he could no longer hold a concert in Greensboro on Sunday, noting, &quot;As we also know, North Carolina has just passed HB2, which the media are referring to as the &#x201C;bathroom&#x201D; law. HB2 &#x2014; known officially as the Public Facilities Privacy and Security Act &#x2014; dictates which bathrooms transgender people are permitted to use. Just as important, the law also attacks the rights of LGBT citizens to sue when their human rights are violated in the workplace. No other group of North Carolinians faces such a burden.&quot;</p>

<p>He explained, &quot;To my mind, it&#x2019;s an attempt by people who cannot stand the progress our country has made in recognizing the human rights of all of our citizens to overturn that progress... Some things are more important than a rock show and this fight against prejudice and bigotry &#x2014; which is happening as I write &#x2014; is one of them. It is the strongest means I have for raising my voice in opposition to those who continue to push us backwards instead of forwards.&quot;</p>

<p>Rep. Mark Walker, a freshman Republican who represents Greensboro, complained to the Hollywood Reporter, &quot;Bruce is known to be on the radical left, and he&apos;s got every right to be so, but I consider this a bully tactic. It&apos;s like when a kid gets upset and says he&apos;s going to take his ball and go home.&quot; </p>

<p>North Carolina&apos;s House Bill 2 (or &quot;HB2&quot;) is the Public Facilities Privacy &amp; Security Act (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170626130937/http://www.ncleg.net/Sessions/2015E2/Bills/House/PDF/H2v0.pdf">PDF</a>), which prohibits local governments from passing laws allowing transgender individuals from using public restrooms associated with their gender identity. Walker claims he&apos;s on the right side, &quot;I choose to stand with our sheriffs, who support this bill, which doesn&apos;t target the LGBTQ community; it targets imposters. It&apos;s a little crazy to think sexual predators wouldn&apos;t be devious enough to pull something off if they were free to go into any bathroom they want.&quot;</p>

<p>Walker also threatened to become a Belieber, because Justin Bieber has an upcoming concert in North Carolina, &quot;I&apos;ve never been a Bieber fan, but I might have to go. Maybe artists who weren&apos;t &apos;born to run&apos; deserve a little bit more support.&quot;</p>

<p>E Street Band member Steven Van Zandt further explained why Springsteen and the rest of the band <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170626130937/http://www.towleroad.com/2016/04/steve-van-zandt/">agreed to cancel the  show</a>, &quot;We just felt the issue was just too important. This really vile and evil discrimination is starting to spread state to state and we thought we better take a stand right now and catch it early and maybe try and stop it. At least set some kind of example for others.&#x201D;</p>

<p>It&apos;s believed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170626130937/http://myfox8.com/2016/04/09/refunds-starting-monday-for-people-who-bought-bruce-springsteen-tickets-in-person/">about $100,000 in net revenue was lost</a> due to the canceled concert.</p>
