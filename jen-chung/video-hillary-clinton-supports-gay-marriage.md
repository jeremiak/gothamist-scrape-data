<p>Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton announced that she&apos;s for same-sex marriage&#x2014;which means she&apos;s ready for 2016, right? </p>

<p>The Human Rights Campaign released a video with Clinton describing her efforts in telling the world that &quot;gay rights are human rights and human rights are gay rights&#x2014;and America will be a leader in defending those rights... America is at its best when we champion the freedom and dignity of every human being.&quot; </p>

<p>On the topic of gay marriage, she said, &quot;Full and equal citizens and deserve the rights of citizenship. That includes marriage. That&apos;s why I support marriage for lesbian and gay couples. I support it personally and as a matter of policy and law.&quot; She added, &quot;A few years ago, Bill and I celebrated as our own daughter married the love of her life, and I wish every parent that same joy.&quot; </p>

<p>Earlier this month, her husband and former President Bill Clinton said that the Defense of Marriage Act, which says marriage is between one man and one woman, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428114304/http://sfist.com/2013/03/08/bill_clinton_finally_admits_doma_sh.php">should be overturned</a>.  Also, just last week, conservative Republican Senator Rob Portman announced <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150428114304/http://chicagoist.com/2013/03/15/conservative_republican_rob_portman.php">his support for gay marriage</a>&#x2014;a reversal prompted by the fact that his son is gay.</p>
