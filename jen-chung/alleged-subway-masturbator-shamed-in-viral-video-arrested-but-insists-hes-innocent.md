<p>A man <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108001446/http://gothamist.com/2016/08/16/subway_perv_shamed_by_hero.php" "="">seen in a viral video</a> getting shamed off of a subway train for allegedly masturbating has been arrested. Would you be shocked to hear this isn&apos;t his first arrest for public lewdness?</p>

<p>On August 15th, straphanger Deanna Carter was riding on a northbound 2 train near Times Square when she saw a man moving his arm up and down near his crotch area, shielded by a backpack. She posted a video on Facebook with this unambiguous message: &quot;TELL ME WHY THIS DUDE WAS RUBBING HIS PENIS SITTING ACROSS FROM ME. I WENT OFF! I&apos;M SO MAD RIGHT NOW. GOT HIS FACE ON VIDEO THO. HE BETTER HOPE I NEVER SEE HIS NASTY ASS AGAIN!&quot;</p>

<p>In the footage, she is heard telling the man: &quot;Get the fuck off this train with that freaky shit. You wanna rub your dick, you rub your dick when you get off the motherfuckin&apos; train, do we understand each other?&quot;</p>

<p>Kevin Cuffe, 23, was arrested this week and charged with public lewdness&#x2014;and the police connected him to a second incident. On December 16, 2015, another subway rider filmed Cuffe allegedly masturbating, this time on a southbound 2 train in the Bronx. </p>

<p>Nicole De&apos;Chabert posted the video to Facebook and warned, &quot;Ladies plz watch ur surroundings on the NYC subways, He was exploited many months after my footage and another video by a NY woman that went viral, because me &amp; her stepped up he was caught but released with a misdemeanor so he&apos;s liable to still be doing this lewd act. He goes by the name Kevin Cuff..#perverts #creeps be aware Ladies .p.s. no he&apos;s not autistic he was evaluated.&quot;</p>

<p>De&apos;Chabert saw Carter&apos;s video <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108001446/http://pix11.com/2016/08/24/suspected-masturbator-shamed-off-nyc-subway-in-now-viral-video-arrested/">and told PIX 11</a>: &#x201C;When I looked very closely I said, that&#x2019;s the same guy I&#x2019;ve seen many months ago over the holiday season.&quot; </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108001446/http://nypost.com/2016/08/24/cops-arrest-perv-who-was-caught-fondling-himself-on-subway/">The Post reports</a>, &quot;Cuffe has two prior arrests, both of which are sealed, police said.&quot; </p>

<p>A police source tells Gothamist, &quot;He&apos;s a developmentally delayed kid who got locked up last year for the same thing in the Bronx.&quot;</p>

<p>However, Cuffe insists he&apos;s innocent. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108001446/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/bronx-perv-busted-allegedly-masturbating-subway-trains-article-1.2764579">He spoke with the Daily News</a> and claimed he wasn&apos;t masturbating in the August 15 video, &quot;I was just looking at her and then she just started yelling at me, cursing me out. She kicked me off the train.&quot; Cuffe wasn&apos;t aware of the December video, claiming, &quot;I don&#x2019;t think I did it that time, either. I just want to see the video.&quot;</p>

<p>Carter, who insists that Cuffe was aroused and touching himself, was upset and then incensed because the train was full of passengers, including little girls, one of whom asked her mother what the man was doing. &quot;I apologize for my language. I know it was very, very, very abrasive,&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108001446/http://abc7ny.com/news/graphic-video-angry-subway-rider-shames-suspected-fondler/1473413/">she said in an interview with WABC 7</a>, but &quot;if it happened again, I would do it again.&quot; </p>

<p>Carter says the little girl&apos;s mother thanked her.</p>

<p>Public lewdness is a misdemeanor, and Cuffe was released on his own recognizance. His next court date is October 20th. </p>

<p>We&apos;ve reached out to Carter for comments following the arrest, and will update if we hear back.</p>
