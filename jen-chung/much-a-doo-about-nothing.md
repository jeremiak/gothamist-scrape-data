Why, P. Diddy stepping into dog poo!</p>

<p>Perhaps Post editors decided we needed a shot of levity as we worry about the economy, so they go with a &quot;POO DIDDY&quot; cover headline and then <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111117121900/http://www.nypost.com/seven/09202008/news/regionalnews/diddy_the_crap_star_129938.htm">DIDDY THE CRAP STAR</a> for the article.  The moniker &quot;P. Doody&quot; is also offered.  </p>

<p>The multi-tasking mogul who is also known as Sean Combs stepped into the offending dog poop at West 44th Street between 8th and 9th Avenues.  One worker told the Post, &quot;<strong>He stepped right out the Jeep and right into it, and he wasn&apos;t happy. It was hysterical.</strong>&quot;  </p>

<p>Apparently he was very aware of the attention  his not-watching -where-he -walks ways:  &quot;After spotting lensmen snapping photos of his embarrassing predicament, Combs asked them not to publish their shots.&quot;</p>

<p>Earlier this year, the city <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111117121900/http://gothamist.com/2008/05/05/fido_fines_doub.php">raised fines for not picking up dog poop</a> to $100.  And the blog New York Shitty <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111117121900/http://www.newyorkshitty.com/?cat=4">covers egregious non-scoop behavior</a>.</p>
