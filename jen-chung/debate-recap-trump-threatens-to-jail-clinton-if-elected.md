<p><b>Move Over, Tricky Dick:</b></p>

<p>Trump said to Clinton, &quot;If I win, I am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation. Because there has never been so many lies, so much deception, there has never been anything like it.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>A president is not typically authorized to order specific criminal investigations of individuals, let alone a public pledge to investigate a political opponent. Former Attorney General Eric Holder tweeted that President Richard Nixon&apos;s attorney general &quot;courageously resigned&quot; after being asked to fire a special prosecutor investigating the Watergate scandal.

<p>When Attorney General Elliot Richardson refused, Nixon went on to fire several members of his cabinet in what became known as the &quot;Saturday Night Massacre.&quot;</p></blockquote><p></p>

<p><b>Saying something nice:</b></p>

<p>One of the town hall participants&#x2014;all of whom were undecided&#x2014;tried to end the debate on a positive note, asking, &quot;My question to both of you is&#x2014;regardless of the current rhetoric&#x2014;would either of you name one positive thing that you respect in one another?&quot;</p>

<p>Clinton jumped on the question and said, &quot;His children are incredibly able and devoted, and I think that says a lot about Donald. I don&apos;t agree with nearly anything else he says or does, but I do respect that, and I think that is something that as a mother and her grandmother, is very important to me.&quot;</p>

<p>And Trump admitted, &quot;She doesn&apos;t quit. She doesn&apos;t give up. I respect that. I tell it like it is. She is a fighter&quot; though &quot;I disagree with much of what she is fighting for.&quot;</p>

<p><b>Kellyanne Conway really is like her SNL counterpart:</b></p><b>

<p>Last night, Saturday Night Live had a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170721025929/http://gothamist.com/2016/10/09/lin-manuel_miranda_hosts_saturday_n.php#photo-9">skit imagining the Trump campaign manager&apos;s day off</a>&#x2014;filled with yoga, roller skating, grocery shopping and baths with her husband&#x2014;but constantly interrupted by Trump&apos;s unhinged remarks. And Conway liked it!</p>

<p>After the debate, Conway spoke to Chris Matthews and tantalized everyone with possible future bombshells:</p>

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Trump campaign manager: &quot;I&apos;m with the campaign until the bitter end -- unless...&quot;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170721025929/https://twitter.com/HardballChris">@HardballChris</a>: &quot;Unless what?&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170721025929/https://t.co/I6V9eK0fLm">https://t.co/I6V9eK0fLm</a></p>&#x2014; NBC Nightly News (@NBCNightlyNews) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170721025929/https://twitter.com/NBCNightlyNews/status/785315669571096576">October 10, 2016</a></blockquote>

<p>Later Conway clarified by saying that her status on the campaign might change because of her own personal situation, if her family needs her. But everyone can dream, right?</p>

<p><b>In the end...</b></p>

<p>Most commentators believe that Trump managed to fire up his base, but didn&apos;t connect with undecided women who are still aghast at the leaked tape. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170721025929/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/10/us/politics/donald-trump-women-hillary-clinton.html?action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=span-abc-region&amp;region=span-abc-region&amp;WT.nav=span-abc-region&amp;_r=0">From the NY Times</a>: </p><blockquote>Diane Crawford, 62, a resident of Greenfield, Iowa, was struck by how eagerly Mr. Trump sought to change the subject to Mrs. Clinton&#x2019;s spouse and his infidelities.<p></p>

<p>&#x201C;He just kept throwing Bill Clinton in there,&#x201D; she said, &#x201C;and Bill Clinton is not running for president.&#x201D;</p>

<p>A skeptic of Mrs. Clinton&#x2019;s heading into the debate, Ms. Crawford said she had changed her mind during those tense exchanges. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m not hesitant any longer to support Hillary,&#x201D; Ms. Crawford said. &#x201C;She showed her leadership ability with her response.&#x201D;</p></blockquote>Republican strategist Liz Mair opined: <p></p>
