<p>Deankarte Ditchfield-Agboh, 33, apparently <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503154720/http://cliffviewpilot.com/palisades-park-head-of-auto-group-charged-with-abandoning-smashed-burning-lamborghini-near-gwb/">crashed the vehicle</a>, but it&apos;s unclear where the crash took place. A truck driver <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503154720/http://www.northjersey.com/news/update-cops-locate-ticket-driver-in-lamborghini-crash-and-burn-near-gwb-1.1032708">who was on the bridge heading to NJ told the Record</a> that the convertible had been speeding past him, with the top down. </p>

<p>Truck driver Todd Greene explained, &quot;By the time I got to the other side, I was running over car parts in the roadway and I saw the wreck,&quot; adding that the airbag had deployed and a &quot;a woman [was] trying to open the driver&#x2019;s door to get the driver out.&quot;</p>

<p>Greene also said, &quot;It was a pretty nice car. It looked like a new one.&quot; It was not burning when he passed by.</p>

<p>Ditchfield-Agboh is the president and CEO of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150503154720/http://www.ecautogroup.com/">East Coast Auto Group</a>. He has not commented on the incident. The manufacturer&apos;s price for the car is $333,000 to $365,800.</p>
