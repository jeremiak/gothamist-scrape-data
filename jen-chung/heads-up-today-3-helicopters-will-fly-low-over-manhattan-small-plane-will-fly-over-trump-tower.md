<p>In order to avoid the kind of natural confusion/alarm that ensued when <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170402033942/http://gothamist.com/2016/12/13/white_house_north_security.php">Blackhawk helicopters were circling midtown Manhattan late last year</a>, the NYC Emergency Management office has announced that there will be <em>two</em> flyovers in Manhattan today&#x2014;one with three helicopters, another with a small aircraft:</p>

<p>The NYPD issued an advisory about the helicopter flyover, saying it would be over midtown Manhattan. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170402033942/https://a858-nycnotify.nyc.gov/notifynyc/">Notify NYC says</a> the midtown flyover will be conducted by &quot;a small aircraft (a tan/brown/yellow PA 27 Aztec with Tail #N170TA)... in the vicinity of Trump Towers in Manhattan. This flyover will be conducted again April 2 and 3, at approximately 9:30 AM - 12:30 PM.&quot; </p>

<p>The December 2016 Blackhawk helicopter flyover was to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170402033942/http://gothamist.com/2016/12/21/where_is_our_rescue_plane.php">practice rescue missions from Trump Tower</a>. </p>
