<p>How much lower can the fight to be Governor of New York go?  Because at this point, it&apos;s about balls and mud.  After releasing an ad that shows a<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160730102847/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/18/paladino_encourages_you_to_think_of.php"> grimy Andrew Cuomo in the shower</a> (ew), Republican candidate <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160730102847/http://paladinoforthepeople.com/">Carl Paladino&apos;s team</a> has a new Shephard Fairey-style &quot;Hope&quot; poster with a stencil of Cuomo&apos;s head and &quot;Cojones&quot; (a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160730102847/http://gothamist.com/2010/09/20/paladino_bullies_cuomo_for_debate_h.php">reference that Cuomo doesn&apos;t have the balls to debate</a>). And the NY State Democrats have entered the fray with a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160730102847/http://www.goprealitycheck.com/paladino">&quot;PaladinoFacts.com&quot; website</a> complete with Paladino-as-pig-at-the-trough, since the millionaire developer has benefited from tax breaks.  </p>

<p>Let&apos;s see, there&apos;s still over 40 days until the election&#x2014;that&apos;s plenty of time for more insane Photoshop!</p>
