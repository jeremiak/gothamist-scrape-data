<p>Shortly after the NYPD asked the public for helping identifying someone suspected of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130918041441/http://gothamist.com/2013/08/07/video_cops_say_this_man_sexually_as.php">sexually assaulting a four-year-old girl inside a McDonald&apos;s play structure</a>, the cops have made an arrest. And the suspect is a 14-year-old boy.</p>

<p>The boy was charged with criminal sexual act. Because he is a minor, his name hasn&apos;t been released and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130918041441/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/14-year-old-boy-busted-sex-assault-4-year-old-mcdonald-queens-police-article-1.1420966">&quot;his case will be handled with Family Court.&quot;</a> </p>

<p>The alleged incident is alarming: The child was assaulted, police say, inside the tubular play structure at a McDonald&apos;s on Hillside Avenue and Avon Street. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130918041441/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/queens/year_old_girl_molested_in_mcdonald_bgFsCKffXsnRS84xfll3mK?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_content=">Post&apos;s sources say the suspect</a> had walked into the location at 6:45 p.m. and headed &quot;for the play area where he hid until the child encountered him and he ran off around 8:25 p.m... The man forced the girl to perform oral sex until she fled down the slide and told her mom what happened, sources added. The enraged and distraught mother begged a security guard for help but he did nothing as the suspect tried to flee out an emergency exit, sources said.&quot;</p>

<p>Both the Post and Daily News say the mother tried the grab him, but he escaped. </p>

<p>The police are also looking into whether this attack is linked to a March incident at the same McDonald&apos;s, when a nine-year-old was fondled.</p>
